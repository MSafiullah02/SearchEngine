            "text": "Interestingly, despite years of study, a comprehensive understanding of the function of eosinophils and their role in health and disease remains elusive. The basic characteristics of eosinophils are understood: among these, the aforementioned staining properties, the fact that they develop from pluripotent progenitors in the bone marrow, and observations related to proliferation, activation, and recruitment to tissues in response to characterized stimuli, such as the cytokines, interleukin (IL)-5, and eotaxins 1, 2, and 3, the latter known by their systematic names, CC chemokine ligand (CCL)11, CCL24, and CCL26. Most researchers also agree that, under homeostatic conditions, eosinophils spend only a brief time in the peripheral blood and reside in one of several distinct peripheral tissues, notably in the gastrointestinal tract. However, when inflammation ensues, eosinophil development in the bone marrow is accelerated, and large numbers of eosinophils leave the bone marrow, enter the bloodstream, and eventually are recruited to and accumulate in any one of a number of peripheral tissues where survival is prolonged (Foster et al., 2001).",

            "text": "At this writing, much of our understanding of eosinophil function both in health and in disease remains uncertain. For example, the long-held belief that eosinophils promote immunity to helminth parasites has been called into question by recent results from mouse model studies, some of which suggest that eosinophils may be serving to promote the needs and longevity of specific parasites (Fabre et al., 2009). Likewise, eosinophils are recruited to and activated in lung tissue as part of the pathophysiology of specific types of asthma (Wenzel, 2012). While the weight of evidence suggests that these cells are contributing to pathophysiology (Wegmann, 2011; Jacobsen et al., 2007), recent studies on antimicrobial functions of these cells suggest that dysregulated eosinophilia and recruitment to the airways may also relate to their roles in promoting host defense (Rosenberg et al., 2009). Finally, recent work suggests that eosinophils are crucial for basic metabolic stability via their role in supporting tissue macrophages (Wu et al., 2011; Wynn, 2015). However, although there are now numerous eosinophil-deficient mouse strains, there are no known specific natural eosinophil-deficiency states to help us decipher the importance of these cells in a human host in vivo.",

Eosinophils can be readily distinguished from the more prevalent neutrophils in peripheral blood by virtue of their bilobed nuclei and large specific granules (Figure 1\n). Large specific granules of human eosinophils contain four major proteins: the eosinophil peroxidase (EPX), major basic protein (MBP), and ribonucleases eosinophil cationic protein (ECP) and eosinophil-derived neurotoxin (EDN) (reviewed in Acharya and Ackerman, 2014). These granules also store numerous cytokines, enzymes, and growth factors. Other prominent features include primary granules that contain Charcot-Leyden crystal protein (galectin-10) and lipid bodies, which are the sites of synthesis of cysteinyl leukotrienes, thromboxane, and prostaglandins. Eosinophils have been identified and characterized in all vertebrate species, but their morphology, repertoire of cell surface receptors, and intracellular contents can vary significantly from one another (Balla et al., 2010; McGarry, 2013; Lee et al., 2010).",

Likewise, Siglec-8 on human eosinophils has a functional ortholog, Siglec-F/Siglec-5 that is not directly homologous with respect to gene sequence.

Mouse EoPs have a unique surface antigen profile (cluster of differentiation (cell surface antigens on leukocytes) (CD)34+Lin\u2212Sca\u2212c-kitloIL-5R\u03b1+); the cells appear as immature, with scattered granules. In contrast, human EoPs are defined by the antigen profile CD34+CD38+CD45RA\u2212IL-3R\u03b1+IL-5R\u03b1+ with similar morphology and potential to differentiate into mature eosinophils as the aforementioned mouse EoPs (Mori et al., 2009).",

Notable interactions are those that involve members of the GATA family, including GATA-1 and GATA-2, also CCAAT-binding proteins, such as C/EBP\u03b1 and C/EBP\u03b5, as well as PU.1. Expression and overexpression of GATA-1 or GATA-2 promote eosinophil commitment and differentiation in myeloid progenitor cells, and deletion of a GATA-binding enhancer site in the mouse Gata1 gene results in unique loss of the eosinophil lineage (Yu et al., 2002). Functional interactions between GATA-1, PU.1, and C/EBP\u03b5 have been reported in eosinophil promyelocyte cell lines, and more recently, Bedi et al. (2009) identified both activator and repressor isoforms of C/EBP\u03b5 that modulate the differentiation of human CD34+ progenitor cells into eosinophils in vitro. However, all of these transcription factors also have roles in supporting the development of other hematopoietic lineages. Although there are no known transcription factors that are uniquely dedicated to promoting eosinophil lineage commitment, a recent report by Bettigole et al. (2015) identified an unexpected and critical role for the developmental regulator, XBP1, in promoting development of mature eosinophils from committed progenitors.",

Interestingly, human mast cells and eosinophils both express the cell surface protein, Siglec-8, which has been identified as a means to deplete eosinophils in vivo (Kiwamoto et al., 2012). The bidirectional signaling that occurs between eosinophils and mast cells involves several immunomodulatory mediators, including: stem cell factor; granule proteins; cytokines including GM-CSF, IL-3, IL-5, and tumor necrosis factor; nerve growth factor; and mast cell proteases. Actual physical coupling of eosinophils and mast cells has been observed both in vitro and in vivo and results in prolonged eosinophil survival (Elishmereni et al., 2011). There are also numerous disease states, including nonclonal disorders such as eosinophil esophagitis, atopic dermatitis, and allergic asthma, as well as clonal disorders, such as mastocytosis and chronic eosinophilic syndrome, in which mast cells and eosinophils coexist in large numbers, although their interactions remain to be fully elucidated (Gotlib and Akin, 2012; Kovalszki and Weller, 2014).",

The role of eosinophils in helminth infection has been reviewed extensively (Anthony et al., 2007; Klion and Nutman, 2004; Behm and Ovington, 2000). The historic view, that eosinophils have antihelminth properties, arose largely from studies carried out in vitro that documented the antiparasitic activities of the eosinophils and their granule proteins. The results from studies carried out in vivo are not clear-cut. As but one example, the helminth, Schistosoma mansoni, while not a natural mouse pathogen, can infect inbred mice and can elicit a profound Th2 cytokine-mediated pathology and accumulation of eosinophils in tissue; however, eosinophil depletion had no significant impact on primary disease (Sher et al., 1990; Swartz et al., 2006). Interestingly, in Strongyloides stercoralis and Angiostrongylus cantonensis infection models, eosinophil depletion resulted in prolonged survival of tissue-based larval forms (Sasaki et al., 1993; Rotman et al., 1996). Recent human studies are likewise not fully consistent with a role for eosinophils in an antiparasite role (Ericksson et al., 2007).",

Likewise, Linch et al.

Although asthma typically involves dysregulated eosinophil recruitment, and eosinophils are generally perceived as promoting disease pathology in this setting, the outcome of eosinophil\u2013virus interactions has not been fully explored. A recent concept to emerge is that eosinophils and their secretory mediators may play a role in promoting antiviral host defense. Among these studies, Domachowske et al. (1998) showed that eosinophil secretory mediators decrease the infectivity of RSV for target host epithelial cells, and Adamko et al. (1999) found that eosinophils elicited by allergen sensitization were responsible for diminished viral loads associated with parainfluenza infection in a guinea pig asthma model. Accelerated clearance of RSV from the lungs of eosinophil-enriched mice has been reported (Phipps et al., 2007), and eosinophils degranulate and protect mice when challenged with an otherwise lethal infection with the rodent pneumovirus pathogen, pneumonia virus of mice (Percopo et al., 2014). Similarly, while eosinophils have not typically been associated as a primary response to respiratory virus pathogens, Gorski et al. (2013) described a period of eosinophil recruitment to the lung tissue in influenza-infected mice, notably, after virus clearance had taken place. Mechanistically, this has been attributed to NKT cells as well as alveolar macrophages as endogenous sources of IL-33 acting on group 2 innate lymphoid cells, which then can produce IL-5 and recruit eosinophils to the lung.",

This question has been explored in a series of experiments by Knudson et al. (2015) using formalin-fixed RSV antigens. Among their conclusions, the airway hyperreactivity and mucus accumulation observed as part of the hypersensitivity response to formalin-fixed RSV antigens is not at all eosinophil-dependent.",

Specifically, the authors provide evidence consistent with the view of eosinophils as immunomodulatory cells and further suggest that they are recruited to tissues primarily as a beneficial response at sites of ongoing cell and tissue destruction and concomitant cell proliferation. These features are common to sites of allergic inflammation (lung, skin, gastrointestinal tract), to lung and liver granulomata associated with helminth infection, responses to pathogens, as well as other sites at which eosinophilic infiltration may be observed (e.g., solid tumors, muscle degeneration; see Table 1). Interestingly, many of the factors recently identified that influence eosinophil responses, both directly and indirectly, are signals from tissues undergoing remodeling (e.g., epithelial cytokines, alarmins), as we continue to explore the actions, functions, and unique capabilities of eosinophils in each of these settings.",
