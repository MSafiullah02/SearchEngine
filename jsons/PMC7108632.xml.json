The lifetime risk of developing PD is 1.5% (1). A subset of PD cases are familial. Mutations in PARK2, the gene encoding the cytosolic E3 ubiquitin ligase Parkin, are the most frequent cause of autosomal recessive PD, probably through a loss-of-function mechanism (2). In addition to its role in familial PD, Parkin deficiency may also contribute to the pathogenesis of sporadic PD, as Parkin is progressively inactivated in the aging human brain as a result of posttranslational modifications (3\u20136).",

This has long been puzzling, given the cytosolic localization of Parkin. However, recent work in a variety of experimental models has shown that Parkin translocates from the cytosol to depolarized mitochondria and ubiquitinates a large number of mitochondrial outer membrane (MOM) proteins, thus triggering selective macro-autophagic removal of the damaged mitochondria (mitophagy) (11\u201319).",

Coimmunoprecipitation and western blotting confirmed the interaction of overexpressed Parkin with USP15 (Supplementary Data), but not USP11.

To assay Parkin function, we employed a widely used HeLa cell model of Parkin-mediated mitophagy (11,12,15,17). When HeLa cells, which do not express endogenous Parkin, are transfected with Parkin and treated with mitochondrial uncouplers such as carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP) or valinomycin for 24 h, depolarized mitochondria are eliminated by autophagy in a Parkin-dependent manner (11,12,15,17). To search for an effect of DUBs on Parkin-mediated mitophagy, HeLa cells were transfected with Parkin alone or cotransfected with Parkin and USP15 or a panel of other DUBs: USP11, which was present in our initial proteomic screen; USP4, the closest homolog of USP15 (59% sequence identity and 73% similarity at the amino acid level); USP30, the only DUB that is anchored into the MOM, facing the cytosol with its catalytic domain (21); UCH-L1, a DUB for which a genetic link with PD has been suggested (22); Ataxin-3, a DUB reported to bind with Parkin (23); and A20, a DUB involved in the NF-\u03baB pathway (24), in which Parkin has also been implicated (25) (Fig. 1). Interestingly, USP15 strongly inhibited Parkin-mediated mitophagy, while the other DUBs had no effect (Fig. 1A and B). Western blot showed that the expression levels of transfected USP4, USP11, USP30, UCH-L1, Ataxin-3 and A20 were at least as high as that of USP15, ruling out stronger expression of USP15 as the reason for its unique effect (Fig. 1C). The inhibitory effect of USP15 on Parkin-mediated mitophagy was demonstrated using both the MOM protein Tom20 (Fig. 1A and B) and the matrix protein Hsp60 (Supplementary Data) as mitochondrial markers.\n",

However, many clinical PARK2 mutations do not completely abolish the E3 ligase activity of Parkin (28\u201330), so that PD patients with PARK2 mutations often have diminished but non-zero Parkin activity levels. We wondered whether USP15 knockdown would promote Parkin function in PARK2 mutant PD patient cells with reduced but non-zero Parkin activity. We used fibroblasts from a PD patient with compound heterozygous PARK2 mutations (c.8_171del/c.535_871del; p.V3EfsX3/p.G179LfsX) (31). In protein extracts from control human fibroblasts, Parkin exists as a major 52-kDa full-length species and a minor 42-kDa species that lacks the N-terminal ubiquitin-like (UBL) domain and originates from an internal translation initiation site at codon 80 of the PARK2 gene (32) (Fig. 3A). Both full-length Parkin and Parkin lacking the UBL domain are capable of inducing mitophagy (25). In the PARK2 mutant cells, total Parkin protein levels were reduced to 30.3\u00b110.8% of control levels (n = 3), with complete absence of 52-kDa Parkin and residual expression of the 42-kDa, UBL-lacking Parkin species generated through the internal start site from the c.8_171del mutant allele (Fig. 3A). In contrast to control fibroblasts, the PARK2 mutant fibroblasts showed little mitochondrial clearance after exposure to CCCP or valinomycin for 48 h (Fig. 3B\u2013E). Strikingly, however, this mitophagy defect of the PARK2 mutant fibroblasts was rescued by knockdown of USP15 (Fig. 3F\u2013I). This rescue was reversed by simultaneous RNAi-mediated knockdown of residual Parkin in the mutant fibroblasts (Supplementary Data).\n",

PINK1 has also been implicated in mitophagy (12\u201314) and enhances the E3 ligase activity of Parkin in response to mitochondrial depolarization (13,33\u201335). Studies in Drosophila and human cells have revealed that overexpression of Parkin can rescue some of the mitochondrial phenotypes caused by PINK1 deficiency, further supporting the view that PINK1 and Parkin function, at least in part, in the same pathway (36\u201338). To assess whether knockdown of USP15 can also compensate for impaired PINK1 function, we examined fibroblasts from a PD patient with homozygous PINK1 mutations (c.1309 T>G). This mutation results in substitution of tryptophan at position 437 by glycine. This residue is located within the kinase domain of PINK1 and is highly conserved across species. Interestingly, these PINK1mutant fibroblasts showed reduced mitophagy (Supplementary Data), indicating that the W437G mutation impaired PINK1 function.

We considered the possibility that USP15 might modulate Parkin function by deubiquitinating Parkin itself. However, we found no evidence that USP15 deubiquitinates Parkin in basal conditions or after exposure to valinomycin (Fig. 5A and B). We also investigated whether USP15 inhibited the translocation of Parkin from the cytosol to depolarized mitochondria. However, USP15 had no effect on the CCCP-induced translocation of transfected Parkin in HeLa cells (Fig. 5C and D). Moreover, subcellular fractionation and western blotting indicated that USP15 did not prevent the CCCP-induced translocation of endogenous Parkin in HEK293 cells (Fig. 5E). These experiments also showed that a substantial portion of endogenous USP15 in HEK293 cells was present in the mitochondria-enriched fractions in basal conditions (Fig. 5E), consistent with the immunocytochemical colocalization experiments in neurons (Fig. 4F); the amount of USP15 in the mitochondrial fractions did not increase after mitochondrial depolarization (Fig. 5E).\n",

Indeed, RNAi-mediated parkin knockdown in flies expressing a GFP version that specifically localizes to mitochondria (mitoGFP) resulted in the appearance of large clumps of intense mitoGFP signal in adult indirect flight muscles (Fig. 8A\u2013C), consistent with the previous work (42).

Mitochondrial membrane potential in parkin RNAi flies was reduced, as shown by labeling of neuromuscular junction synapses with the potentiometric dye JC-1 (Fig. 8E and F) (43).

Control 1 was a healthy male born in 1949; control 2 was a healthy female born in 1967; control 3 was a healthy male born in 1944; control 4 was a healthy female born in 1938. The clinical history of the PD patient with compound heterozygous PARK2 mutations, a female born in 1970, has been published (31). The patient with PINK1 mutations was a female born in 1941 who developed early-onset PD at the age of 38, presenting initially with a right-sided arm and leg tremor, bradykinesia and rigidity. She responded well to levodopa. As the disease progressed, she developed motor fluctuations. Twenty years after disease onset, she required bilateral pallidotomy to treat her severe dyskinesias. She was the eldest of seven children, born to consanguineous parents. She has one other sister who developed PD at the age of 46 years. Her twin brother and sister died in early childhood and another sister and two brothers remain unaffected. PINK1 mutations were identified by DNA extraction from blood using JET Quick Spin Columns according to the manufacturer's instructions (Astral Scientific Australia). The purified DNA was then subjected to a PCR cycle to incorporate the dye labeled terminators (Applied Biosystems, Australia). The PCR conditions were as detailed: 25 cycles at 96\u00b0C 10 s, 50\u00b0C 5 s and 60\u00b0C 4 min. The PCR reactions were then cleaned and final reaction samples were sequenced using an ABI 3730 capillary sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Australia). Human fibroblasts were grown in DMEM F12 (Invitrogen) supplemented with fetal bovine serum (10%, Greiner Bio-One), non-essential amino acids (1%) penicillin (100 U/ml), streptomycin (100 \u00b5g/ml) and sodium bicarbonate (0.12%) at 37\u00b0C in a 5% CO2 humidified atmosphere. Human fibroblasts were transfected with 50 nm siRNA using the Neon Transfection System (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. CCCP (Calbiochem), valinomycin (Sigma), bafilomycin A1 (Sigma) or DMSO were added 24 or 48 h after transfection.",
