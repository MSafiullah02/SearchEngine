Based on genomic sequencing the subfamily Coronavirinae is further subdivided into four genera \u2014 Alphacoronavirus, Betacoronavirus, Gammacoronavirus, and Deltacoronavirus.[1] Over the last 20 years, betacoronavirus genera have produced two epidemics SARS CoV (2002-03), MERS CoV (2014-16).[2] An acute respiratory illness broke out in Wuhan, China in December 2019. A novel virus belonging to the genera betacoronavirus found to be causing this disease Corona Virus Disease-2019 (COVID- 19)) is presently classified as severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus. On February 1, 2020, WHO declared COVID-19 as a public health emergency of international concern. On the day of writing this editorial (04/04/2020), SARS-CoV-2 has infected 1,083,211 patients worldwide and 3,108 patients were infected in India. The case fatality rate of SARS CoV is 14-15%, MERS CoV is 35% and the rate of SARS- CoV- 2 is around 2.5% suggesting that SARS- CoV- 2 is less deadly than its cousins as on date.[3]",

SARS- CoV- 2 spreads via air-borne droplet particles/aerosols (coughing and sneezing) or direct contact with the secretions of the infected individual producing human to human transmission. The droplet particles do not travel beyond 2 meters and do not remain in the air. Thus far, there is no evidence of intrauterine transmission or transmission during delivery.[245] SARS- CoV- 2 has been extracted from stool samples however faeco-oral transmission has not been documented.[6] Basic reproduction number (R0) indicates the ability of an organism to spread. R0 of SARS- CoV- 2 is 2-2.5. The serial interval (SI) is the time taken for successive cases to be infected. The mean serial interval for SARS- CoV- 2 is 3.96 days (4-7 days) which much lower than 8.4 days documented for SARS CoV.[67] Majority of infections (approximately 81%) are mildly symptomatic, although these patients can spread the disease. R0, SI and large number of mildly symptomatic patients are epidemiologically significant and responsible for the exponential spread of the virus.",

In the brain, the above receptors are seen in endothelium and smooth muscle cells of blood vessels. Animal studies (rat) have shown that the receptors are also seen in neurons.[10] Speculation that ACE inhibitors/Angiotensin receptor blockers upregulates ACE 2 receptor and increases the susceptibility to infection lacks evidence. It is advised that patients continue the ACE inhibitors/Angiotensin receptor blockers medications [Figure 2].[11]",

It may also involve the peripheral nervous system causing Guillain Barre syndrome and muscle injury.[131516171819] The respiratory failure may also result from virus-mediated destruction of medullary neurons.[20] These manifestations described are far from complete as our understanding of the neurotropism and neurovirulence of the virus is likely to unfurl as the pandemic progresses [Figure 3].",
