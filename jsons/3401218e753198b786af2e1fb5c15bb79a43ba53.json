Specifically, the intensity of COVIDrelated social media activity from different Italian regions at the beginning of the epidemic (21-24/2/2020), predicts well the total number of deaths reached almost a month later (21/3/2020) in each region. It should be noted that at the time of the initial twitter reaction no tabled regional data on the epidemic was readily available. By the 24 th February 2020 only two regions reported death cases and only three reported infected subjects.",

There have been proposed several different modeling tools and intuitions for the forecasting of the severity of the infection (1-4) and, despite some success, there is a shared understanding that forecasting the spread and growth of the epidemic is a challenging task. As the spreading mechanism is not yet fully understood and modelled, predicting the contagion and growth within countries and the regions in each country, before data is available, is essentially impossible. However, this task is extremely useful in order to establish targeted confinement areas, hence containing the virus more effectively while reducing the economic and social disruptions due to the lockdown. The knowledge of this would also allow to allocate resources efficiently across regions. In the present work we use data from twitter activity in different Italian regions to estimate crowd perception of the severity of the event. We then relate the intensity of social media interest with the severity of the infection in the same region in terms of the number of deaths registered the following month.

Social media reaction has been adjusted by dividing by the population active on social media in each region, as per the data reported by ISTAT (7, 8) . This controls for a bias towards larger regions, although one should be mindful of the higher variance expected in regions with lower tweet volume. We note that regional data for the epidemic was first available on the 24 th February 2020, hence after the social media reaction, and at that time most regions still reported no cases, hence not allowing for statistically robust forecasting. The crowds therefore reacted on partial information that was not trivially obtainable from publicly available data. We point out that we used the number of deaths in our model instead of confirmed cases, as we have noticed these to be highly dependent on the number of samples taken which would require a non-trivial rescaling. The dependence on samples strengthens the relation with regional population spuriously.",

We observe an initial peak in late January, perhaps due to the epidemic in China, but with little differentiation between regions. We then observe a second peak of interest from social media in late February. This appears to be sparked by the endogenous growth of the infection in Italy being measured and reported. At the time (21-24/2/2020) only nationwide epidemic data were available and regional or province breakdowns were only scattered across the news. In Figure 2 we colour-code Italian regions according to the ISTAT \u2020 characterisation of Northern, Central and Southern. We observe how northern, central and southern regions cluster in order, with regions most hit by the epidemic ranking higher. This seems to suggest that the initial reaction of users on social media had efficiently processed data scattered throughout news channels and performed an accurate risk assessment which is observable in the adjusted social media reaction.",

We report in Table 1 It can be inferred from Table 1 that adjusted tweet volume is a better regressor than log population. This is shown by both the higher R 2 value in regression 1 with respect to regression 2, and by the significant p-value for tweets in regression 3.
