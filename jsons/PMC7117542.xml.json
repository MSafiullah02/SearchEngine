Since the first biosensor was developed by Updike and Hicks [1], a variety of biosensors have been developed [2]. Recently, Tong et al. have discovered the novel aggregation-induced emission (AIE) phenomenon [3] and applied it to biosensor technology. Among the AIE dyes, tetraphenylethylene (TPE) is synthesized by simple reactions and emits very efficiently in aggregated or crystal states. The water-soluble cationic TPE derivatives can be used as bioprobes for detection of proteins, DNA, and RNA [4]. The TPE compounds bearing adenine and thymine moieties can be used as chemosensors for Ag+ and Hg2+, respectively [5]. Moreover, sugar-phosphole oxide conjugates were synthesized as \u201cturn-on\u201d fluorescent sensors for lectins [6].",

Compound 1 was converted to tetrapropargyl compound 2 by reaction with 3-bromo-1-propyne in the presence of K2CO3 in acceptable yield. The chemical structures and molecular masses of compounds 1 and 2 were confirmed from their NMR and mass spectra. Lactosyl and 6\u2032-sialyllactosyl moieties were introduced into compound 2 by click chemistry between the propargyl group of TPE derivative and the azide group of aglycon of oligosaccharide compounds (12-azidododecyl \u03b2-lactoside and 12-azidododecyl 6\u2032-sialyllactoside) using CuSO4 and sodium ascorbate as shown in Scheme 1B. 12-Azidododecyl \u03b2-6\u2032-sialyllactoside was obtained by enzymatic reaction from 12-azidododecyl \u03b2-lactoside using ST6 in 70% yield. Because the solubility of TPE derivative and12-azidododecyl \u03b2-lactoside to water was low, they were dissolved in DMSO and added to the reaction solution. TLC analysis (chloroform\u2013methanol\u2013H2O, 5:4:1) of these mixtures showed no sign of the starting compound 2. Analysis of the MALDI-TOF mass spectrum of Lac-TPE and \u03b12,6SL-TPE revealed a peak at m/z 2777.6 ([M+Na]+) and 4030.9 ([M-4H+5Na]+), respectively.",

We examined whether influenza virus could be specifically detected by the fluorescence oligosaccharide probe, because the influenza virus possesses HA molecules at a high density (about 1000 molecules/virus) on its surface [23]. Fig. 1\nshows the fluorescence spectrum of Lac-TPE and \u03b12,6SL-TPE in the presence of different concentrations of influenza virus A/WSN/33 in 10 mM Tris\u2013HCl, pH 7.6. Fluorescence enhancement of \u03b12,6SL-TPE was observed in the presence of influenza virus. On the other hand, fluorescence of Lac-TPE was not enhanced in the presence of influenza virus. These results suggest that AIE may have been caused by binding of influenza virus to 6\u2019-sialyllactose moiety ligated to \u03b12,6SL-TPE. It is interesting that whether the TPE derivatives bind to one virus particle or viral aggregates to induce such fluorescence enhancement by AIE effect. This AIE effect is mainly caused by the restriction of intramolecular rotation of C\u2013C single bond [24]. The \u03b12,6SL-TPE may bind to the HA molecules on the surface of an influenza virus and freeze its intramolecular rotation.",

The emission of less than 400 nm light depends on the self-luminosity of the 96-well microtiter plate. However, after addition of influenza virus A/WSN/33, the emission band at 460 nm increased. Actually, the difference of fluorescence between the absence and presence of influenza virus can be distinguished by the naked eye under UV illumination as shown in Fig. 2. Moreover, we examined detectable amounts of influenza virus. The fluorescence intensity of \u03b12,6SL-TPE at 460 nm increased significantly as a function of increasing amounts of influenza virus as shown in Fig. 3\n.
