            "text": "Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4) is a multifunctional protein that exerts biological activity through pleiotropic actions including: protease activity (1), association with adenosine deaminase (ADA) (2), interaction with the extracellular matrix (3), cell surface coreceptor activity mediating viral entry (4), and regulation of intracellular signal transduction coupled to control of cell migration and proliferation (5). The complexity of DPP4 action is amplified by the panoply of bioactive DPP4 substrates, which in turn act as elegant biochemical messengers in multiple tissues, including the immune and neuroendocrine systems. Biological interest in the DPP4 enzyme has heightened after the approval of highly selective DPP4 inhibitors for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. Several excellent reviews have highlighted results of clinical trials using DPP4 inhibitors to treat type 2 diabetes (6); others have compared the structures, pharmacokinetic differences, and comparative efficacy of unique DPP4 inhibitors (7) or summarized cardiovascular (8\u201310), renal (11), or safety data (12) surrounding the use of DPP4 inhibitors. In this review, we approach the literature from a different perspective, highlighting the biology of the DPP4 enzyme and critically assessing experiments reporting the identification and role(s) of DPP4 substrates. We emphasize studies identifying DPP4 substrates and in turn assess our knowledge of how DPP4 inhibitors, acting through these substrates, transduce their pleiotropic actions in both preclinical and clinical studies. Given the clinical relevance of DPP4 biology for the treatment of diabetes, we focus most of our attention on mechanisms of action most relevant to the pathophysiology and treatment of diabetes and its complications. Readers interested in reviews summarizing clinical trial data are encouraged to consult several excellent recent summaries (6, 7).",

It was later determined to be identical to the T-cell activation antigen cluster of differentiation (CD)-26, rat liver membrane glycoprotein gp110, and the mouse thymocyte-activating molecule (14\u201316). The 70-kb human gene identified in 1992 (17\u201319) is located on the long arm of chromosome 2 (2q24.3) and comprises 26 exons that encode a 766-amino acid protein; the classic serine protease catalytic site is encoded by two exons, exons 21 and 22, respectively. In the mouse, Dpp4 is found on chromosome 2 (2C2\u20132D), and interestingly, exon 21 and exon 22 are present as a single 156-bp exon (19, 20). DPP4 is widely expressed in numerous tissues including endothelial cells in multiple vascular beds (21), rendering the enzyme highly accessible to peptide substrates circulating through the gut, liver, lung, and kidney (22). The human gene encodes two predominant mRNA transcripts, a larger 4.2-kb mRNA whose distribution is widespread, and a 2.8-kb transcript restricted to the placenta, kidney, lung, and liver. Furthermore, multiple minor splice variants of the DPP4 gene have been described; however, the functional significance, if any, of the various mRNA transcripts, which may contain different 3\u2032-untranslated sequences or poly A tails, for translation of the classical bioactive DPP4 protein remains unclear (19, 20).",

The position and identity of the residues essential for catalytic activity within the C-terminal region of these related enzymes are highly conserved in prokaryotes and eukaryotes despite other significant differences in sequence (23). Further enzymatic complexity is engendered by the functionally related DASH (dipeptidyl peptidase 4 activity and/or structure homologs) enzymes that replicate the enzymatic activity of DPP4 despite differences in structure and localization, thus explaining DPP4-like activity that persists after genetic deletion or pharmacological inhibition of DPP4 (24).",

Only six N-terminal amino acids are predicted to extend into the cytoplasm. The active site, Ser 630, is flanked by the classic serine peptidase motif Gly-Trp-Ser630-Tyr-Gly-Gly-Tyr-Val (23, 25, 26). Chemical cross-linking experiments performed in Caco-2 cells and native gel analysis of DPP4 isolated from seminal fluid demonstrated that dimers are the predominant species (27). Further studies analyzing recombinant DPP4 produced from baculoviral-infected Sf9 insect cells demonstrated that DPP4 exhibits a much smaller amount of enzymatic activity in the monomeric form, with activity significantly increasing upon homodimerization (28). Mutation studies demonstrated that the C-terminal loop of DPP4 is essential for both dimer formation and optimal catalytic efficacy (27).",

The soluble form was first identified in serum and saliva (36) and has been detected in cerebrospinal and seminal fluid and bile. sDPP4 can also activate intracellular signaling pathways and increases the proliferation of human lymphocytes, independent of either its catalytic activity (38) or the binding of ADA (38). sDPP4 impairs insulin-mediated activation of Akt in human adipocyte, skeletal muscle, and smooth muscle cells in vitro (39). Remarkably, some of the actions attributed to sDPP4, such as regulation of T-cell migration or up-regulation of costimulatory molecules such as CD86, require functional catalytic sDPP4 catalytic activity (40, 41). The mechanisms through which sDPP4 activates signal transduction, possibly through interaction with the mannose 6-phosphate/IGF-2 receptor (41) or via other molecular interactions (42), are poorly understood.",

The importance of cytokines for DPP4 activity was demonstrated in chronic B lymphocytic leukemia cells, where interferons \u03b1, \u03b2, and \u03b3 stimulated STAT1\u03b1 to bind the GAS (interferon \u03b3-activated sequence) consensus sequences in the promoter of the DPP4 gene, leading to up-regulation of both intracellular and cell-surface DPP4 expression as well as DPP4 activity (46).",

In human adipocytes isolated from visceral depots, both inflammatory stimuli (TNF-\u03b1) and insulin increased the release of sDPP4 despite a lack of change in DPP4 mRNA expression (39). Analysis of DPP4 mRNA expression in visceral adipose from obese human subjects demonstrated relative increases in DPP4 mRNA transcripts and enhanced release of sDPP4 from cultured adipocytes ex vivo (49). Nevertheless, whereas many studies have measured sDPP4 and associated its levels with different disease states, very little insight has been provided into the mechanisms regulating the shedding and biological activity of sDPP4 under these conditions. Studies in Dark Agouti rats demonstrated that kidney extracts exhibited the highest DPP4 activity (kinetic assay Gly-Pro-pNA substrate, presented per gram of wet weight) of any organ tested. High activity was also found in spleen, lung, thymus, and liver, whereas medium levels of activity were found in the intestine, aorta, and bone marrow. Interestingly, plasma DPP4 activity was not reduced after kidney transplantation from a Dpp4-deficient congenic Dark Agouti donor rat into a wild-type recipient rat, suggesting that the kidney is not an important source of sDPP4. Further studies in which Dpp4-deficient congenic Dark Agouti donor rats were lethally irradiated and received transfer of wild-type bone marrow demonstrated that 10 weeks after surgery, bone marrow was the source of 47% of sDPP4 activity in plasma; however, the marrow-derived cell type responsible was not determined (50). These studies highlight our limited understanding of the cell types and tissues that contribute to generation of sDPP4 plasma activity in vivo.",

Although glycosylation may contribute approximately 18\u201325% of the total molecular weight (17, 52), mutational analysis has determined that the glycosylation sites are not required for dimerization, catalytic activity, or ADA binding (53). However, N-terminal sialylation facilitates trafficking of DPP4 to the apical membrane (54). Interestingly, molecular analysis of DPP4 isoforms isolated from the rat kidney brush border membrane reveals extensive heterogeneity in the oligosaccharides of DPP4 (55). A single study of sialylated DPP4 isoforms from peripheral blood mononuclear cells of HIV-infected subjects correlated the extent of sialylation with increasing patient age (56). This interaction has been proposed to alter the ionic charge of DPP4 antigens because highly sialylated DPP4 is more readily inhibited by cationic peptides. Desialylation of DPP4 with Vibrio cholera neuraminidase increased DPP4 activity; hence, the extent of sialylation may represent another mechanism for control of DPP4 activity (37, 57).",

Diabetes is characterized by a lack of suppression of glucagon in the postprandial state that contributes to aberrant metabolism of glucose and lipids. Mass spectrometry analysis demonstrated that incubation of purified porcine DPP4 with glucagon in vitro resulted in formation of glucagon [3\u201329] and glucagon [5\u201329]. In human serum, glucagon can be metabolized to glucagon [3\u201329] ex vivo, and a DPP4 inhibitor (Ile-thiazolidide) prevented formation of this cleavage product in vitro (70). Nevertheless, the degradation of glucagon in porcine plasma is not affected by DPP4 inhibition with valine-pyrrolidide, and glucagon degradation was not modulated in anesthetized pigs treated with DPP4 inhibitors (71). Furthermore, the physiological or therapeutic significance of this enzymatic cleavage is unclear because DPP4 inhibitors universally decrease levels of intact glucagon in rodents and humans via potentiation of GLP-1 action, and circulating levels of glucagon [3\u201329] and glucagon [5\u201329] have not been reported in animals or humans treated with a DPP4 inhibitor.

In contrast, equimolar doses of native GLP-2 potently increased SB mass in F344 mutant DPP4 rats (84), illustrating the importance of endogenous DPP4 for inactivating GLP-2 in rodents. Furthermore, DPP4-resistant analogs of GLP-2 exert potent intestinotrophic effects in rodents and humans (84, 85), and plasma levels of intact bioactive GLP-2 [1\u201333] are increased after treatment of animals (86, 87) with a DPP4 inhibitor. Hence, GLP-2 is a physiological substrate of DPP4.

DPP4 cleaves GIP to release the dipeptide (Tyr-Ala) (90\u201392). GIP [3\u201342] is unable to activate the GIP receptor and, at pharmacological levels, functions as a weak antagonist in vitro. Nevertheless, whether GIP [3\u201342] functions as a physiologically relevant antagonist in vivo is uncertain (93, 94). GIP is a physiological substrate for DPP4 because plasma levels of intact GIP [1\u201342] are increased in animals (95) and humans (96) after administration of DPP4 inhibitors, and levels of intact GIP are increased in Dpp4\u2212/\u2212 mice (52).",

Clinically, treatment of healthy human male subjects with sitagliptin (25\u2013600 mg) for 10 days did not produce increased concentrations of serum IGF-1 or IGF-binding protein 3 as measured by ELISA (102). Furthermore, Dpp4\u2212/\u2212 mice or rats do not exhibit increased organ growth or body size.

PACAP [1\u201338] is cleaved by DPP4 in vitro, and a C-terminal variant, PACAP [1\u201327], is also weakly cleaved by DPP4 (66, 110). PACAP signals through a family of structurally related PAC-1R, vasoactive intestinal peptide pituitary adenylate cyclase activating pepdite (VPAC) 1R, and VPAC-2R receptors (113), and both PAC-1R and VPAC-2R have been localized by in situ hybridization to islets. PACAP is a direct regulator of insulin secretion at concentrations as low as 10\u221214 mol/L, placing it among the most potent insulinotropic peptides described (114). The presence of multiple PACAP isoforms, as well as a family of related receptors that also recognize vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), renders generation of a PACAP-specific antagonist highly challenging (113). Although Pac1r\u2212/\u2212 mice exhibit a complex metabolic phenotype, they display significant glucose intolerance and defective insulin secretion after both oral and iv glucose and impaired insulinotropic responses to PACAP, but not VIP, consistent with the importance of endogenous PACAP for control of insulin secretion (115). Circulating levels of PACAP [1\u201338] remain elevated after iv administration in Dpp4\u2212/\u2212 mice, with markedly reduced generation of PACAP [3\u201338] (110). Similarly, the DPP4 inhibitor valine-pyrrolidide potentiated the insulinotropic actions of coadministered synthetic ovine PACAP [1\u201338] in mice (67). However, whether circulating or local concentrations of endogenous PACAP [1\u201338] are increased in the presence of a DPP4 inhibitor or altered in Dpp4\u2212/\u2212 mice remains unclear, and it is difficult to ascertain due to the low concentrations of PACAP isoforms in vivo.",

NPY and related peptides (peptide YY and pancreatic polypeptide) exert their biological actions through a family of structurally related receptors (Y1R-Y5R) (116). Cleavage of native NPY [1\u201336] by DPP4 generates NPY [3\u201336], which has a strong affinity for the YR2/Y5R receptors, and considerable data demonstrate that cleavage of NPY [1\u201336] in vitro modulates NPY receptor selectivity (Figure 3). Nevertheless, enzymatic cleavage of NPY is complex, with at least five peptidases identified that cleave NPY in vitro (117). Although plasma immunoreactive NPY levels were elevated in Dpp4\u2212/\u2212 mice with experimental colitis, these analyses did not distinguish between intact and cleaved forms of NPY (118). Furthermore, there are little data assessing whether envisioned changes in levels of endogenous NPY [1\u201336] vs NPY [3\u201336] in circulation and/or tissues after DPP4 inhibition accounts for a component of the relevant biological effects observed after DPP4 inhibition in vivo.",

SDF-1 is widely expressed in numerous cell types, and SDF-1 expression and secretion are often induced concomitant with cellular injury. Both SDF-1 isoforms are cleaved by soluble or cellular DPP4, which inactivates their antiviral and chemotactic properties in cell-based assays in vitro (127). Because SDF-1 activity enhances migration of hematopoietic and endothelial progenitor cells to sites of ischemic injury, DPP4 inhibitors have been employed to enhance tissue healing, most commonly in the setting of myocardial or vascular ischemia. Importantly, DPP4 inhibition reduces N-terminal degradation of SDF-1 and potentiates SDF-1 action in vivo by enabling enhanced activation of its receptor, CXCR4, with greater stem cell mobilization to sites of injury (128). As is the case with many low abundance DPP4 substrates, quantification of levels of intact vs DPP4-cleaved SDF-1\u03b1 in vivo is challenging, due to the lack of sensitive assays for discriminating SDF-1\u03b1 [1\u201367] from SDF-1\u03b1 [3\u201367].",

Dpp4\u2212/\u2212 mice exhibit approximately 2-fold higher levels of circulating SP, implicating an essential biological role for DPP4 in control of SP biology (132). Although potentiation of SP activity has been postulated to underlie the pathophysiology of nasopharyngitis or neurogenic inflammation occasionally reported with use of DPP4 inhibitors, SP is also rapidly cleaved by angiotensin-converting enzyme and neutral endopeptidase, and levels of intact vs cleaved SP are very low and difficult to quantify in vivo. Furthermore, the extent of cutaneous inflammation induced by exogenous intradermal administration of SP in human subjects was not modified by coadministration of sitagliptin (133). Although pharmacological infusion of SP potentiates vascular release of norepinephrine and increases heart rate in human studies, there is currently no firm clinical evidence that DPP4 inhibition potentiates the cardiovascular activity of endogenous SP in human subjects.

            "text": "Interest in the therapeutic potential of inhibiting DPP4 for the treatment of metabolic disorders followed observations that GLP-1 [7\u201337]/GLP-1 [7\u201336] amide, and not GLP-1 [1\u201337], were potent glucose-dependent stimulators of insulin secretion (73), yet native GLP-1 [7\u201337]/[7\u201336] amide exhibited a very short circulating half-life, and continuous infusion was required to optimally control glycemia (139). In 1993, Mentlein et al (91) identified DPP4 as the enzyme responsible for hydrolysis of the incretin hormones GLP-1 [7\u201336] and GIP [1\u201342] in vitro, findings subsequently extended to rats by Kieffer et al (90). Furthermore, the rapid N-terminal cleavage of GLP-1 and GIP by purified DPP4 or rat serum was substantially reduced by coincubation with the DPP4 inhibitor diprotin A and diminished in the presence of serum from DPP4-deficient Fisher 344 rats. Infusion of [125 I]GIP [1\u201342] or [125 I]GLP-1 [7\u201336]NH2 into DPP4 rats resulted in substantially less N-terminal cleavage of these peptides (90), illustrating the critical role of DPP4 for incretin inactivation in vivo. Simultaneously, Deacon et al (72) demonstrated cleavage of GLP-1 [7\u201336] amide to GLP-1 [9\u201336] amide in human plasma in vitro, with these actions sensitive to the DPP4 inhibitor diprotin A, findings consistent with those reported by Pauly et al (140) analyzing the degradation of GIP and GLP-1 by human serum in vitro. Furthermore, the circulating levels of both intact and cleaved GLP-1 isoforms were lower in the fasting state and rose after meal ingestion in human subjects (72). Subcutaneous or iv administration of native GLP-1 in normal and diabetic human subjects led to rapid degradation of the intact GLP-1 [7\u201336] amide and accumulation of the DPP4-generated metabolite GLP-1 [9\u201336] amide (141). Collectively, these findings highlighted the role of DPP4 as a key determinant of the enzymatic cleavage and inactivation of GLP-1 both in vitro and in vivo; hence, GLP-1 is a major physiological substrate for DPP4.",

Treatment of rats with Ile-thiazolidide inhibited DPP4 activity, improved oral glucose tolerance, and enhanced the insulin response to glucose, findings consistent with the potentiation of endogenous GLP-1 and GIP activity in vivo (143). Notably, DPP4 inhibition improved glycemia not only in lean insulin-sensitive rats, but also in obese Zucker rats with marked glucose intolerance, demonstrating that inhibition of DPP4 activity produced glucoregulatory actions in experimental models of dysglycemia (143). Similarly, acute administration of NVP-DPP728, a selective inhibitor of DPP4, to lean and obese insulin-resistant Zucker rats improved oral glucose tolerance and augmented the increases in plasma insulin levels, in association with increased plasma levels of intact GLP-1 and no change in gastric emptying (144).

The Fischer rat (F344/DuCrj and F344/CRG; Charles River Japan and Germany, respectively) exhibits loss of DPP4 activity due to a G633R substitution near the DPP4 active site (145), which results in degradation of the immature DPP4 protein in the endoplasmic reticulum (146). The Japanese rat exhibits enhanced glucose tolerance, increased levels of circulating GLP-1, and enhanced insulin secretion under basal conditions (75, 147). Both the F344/DuCrj and F344/CRG rats demonstrate a reduction in body weight, associated with decreased food and water intake (148). The F344/DuCrj exhibits favorable metabolic phenotypes including improved oral glucose tolerance, increased insulin secretion, and higher levels of intact plasma GLP-1. Notably, the DPP4 inhibitor valine-pyrrolidide did not modify glucose tolerance of F344/DuCrj rats but improved glucose tolerance in control F344/Jcl rats (75).

Second, DPP4-deficient rats and Dpp4\u2212/\u2212 mice do not represent models of selective inactivation or deficiency of the catalytic subunit; rather, these animals exhibit reduced expression (F344 rats) or complete genetic elimination (Dpp4\u2212/\u2212 mice) of the entire DPP4 protein.

The critical importance of DPP4 as the glucoregulatory target for DPP4 inhibitors is exemplified by studies in F344/DuCrj rats treated with valine pyrrolidide, which demonstrated no improvement in glucose tolerance compared with reduction in glycemic excursion in control rats (75). Similarly, valine pyrrolidide improved glucose tolerance in wild-type mice but failed to lower glucose in Dpp4\u2212/\u2212 mice (52).

Many DPP4 substrates, including GLP-1, GLP-2, NPY, PYY, SDF-1\u03b2, interferon \u03b3-induced protein-10 (IP-10), and interferon-inducible T-cell \u03b1 chemoattractant, are also target substrates for DPP8 and/or DPP9, albeit with much lower efficiencies compared to DPP4. NPY, BNP, SP, and PYY as well as GLP-1 and GIP may all be hydrolyzed by FAP; however, no overlap in the enzymatic specificity of chemokine truncation was observed (154). The relative importance of ubiquitously expressed DPP8/DPP9 as potential mediators of toxicity emanating from the use of nonselective DPP4 inhibitors remains a subject of some uncertainty (152). Lankas et al (155) assessed the consequences of administering selective inhibitors of DPP4, DPP8/9, or quiescent cell proline peptidase in rats, dogs, and wild-type and Dpp4\u2212/\u2212 mice. Selectivity was assessed in vitro against the respective recombinant human enzymes. After 4 weeks of treatment with L-threo-isoleucyl thiazolidine 1, rats demonstrated lung histiocytosis and thrombocytopenia. Dogs given the same treatment exhibited acute central nervous toxicities after one or two doses including seizure, tremor, and ataxia were observed at lower doses (155) with bloody diarrhea in dogs observed after more prolonged therapy. After 5\u20136 weeks of treatment in dogs, mortality was significantly increased, and additional toxicities including anemia, thrombocytopenia, splenomegaly, and multiorgan pathology were observed. The allo isomer (allo-isoleucyl thiazolidine) was shown to exhibit 10-fold greater potency for inhibition of DPP8/9, potentially accounting for some of the observed preclinical toxicities (155). Subsequent studies employing DPP8/9 selective inhibitors produced thrombocytopenia, splenomegaly, lymphadenopathy, lymphocyte necrosis, and mortality in rats and bloody diarrhea, emesis, and tenesmus in dogs (155). Notably, splenomegaly, bone marrow myeloid hyperplasia, and excess mortality were observed in both wild-type and Dpp4\u2212/\u2212 mice treated with high doses of DPP8/9 selective inhibitors (155). Furthermore, Val-boro-pro and DPP8/9 selective inhibitors reduced cytokine release and T-cell proliferation, whereas DPP4-selective inhibitors had no effect in these assays in vitro.",

First, these studies assessed structurally distinct compounds profiled in different enzymatic assays in vitro and separate groups of animals in vivo, and we do not have external validation of the relative toxicities of the various compounds studied in independent laboratories. Importantly, measuring plasma and even tissue levels of various inhibitors may not reveal whether various inhibitors differentially pass across cell membranes and penetrate intracellular compartments. Because many of the enzymes such as DPP8/9 may not be similarly accessible to all compounds, some of the experimental differences observed may reflect differences with which various compounds access and interact with the enzymes residing in key cellular subcompartments (158). None of the studies routinely assess the extent to which enzyme activities are selectively reduced in tissues and within cells in vivo, a challenging task given the large number of cellular enzymes with related enzymatic profiles and activities. Intriguingly, Dpp9\u2212/\u2212 mutant mice with a Ser-Ala point mutation at the catalytic site (S729A) exhibit normal enzyme expression, reduced DPP9 enzymatic activity, and normal embryonic development (159); although Dpp9\u2212/\u2212 mice are born with the expected Mendelian frequency, they exhibit neonatal mortality and die shortly after birth. Hence, selective genetic ablation of murine DPP9 catalytic activity, a scenario distinct from partial inhibition of DPP9 activity, produces major organ toxicities in vivo (159). Even less is known about the consequences of selective genetic or chemical reduction of DPP8 enzyme activity in vivo, and it seems clear that toxicology data generated in rodents may not always be readily extrapolated to primates.",

Although these actions would not be predicted to be impaired by pharmacological inhibition targeting the protease activity, genetic evidence demonstrates that some actions of DPP4 not involving substrate cleavage do require catalytic DPP4 activity (40, 41).

Acute administration of four structurally distinct DPP4 inhibitors (valine pyrrolidide, SYR-106124, LAF237, and TP8211) improved oral glucose tolerance and increased levels of plasma insulin in wild-type mice and in both Glp1r\u2212/\u2212 and Gipr\u2212/\u2212 mice. In contrast, none of the DPP4 inhibitors lowered glycemia or increased plasma levels in acute studies with double incretin receptor knockout (DIRKO; Glp1r\u2212/\u2212:Gipr\u2212/\u2212) mice (163). To assess whether the development of insulin resistance and glucose intolerance unmasked the importance of additional DPP4-sensitive glucoregulatory substrates beyond GLP-1 and GIP, Flock et al (164) administered vildagliptin in the drinking water continuously for 8 weeks to high-fat-fed C57BL/6 wild-type and DIRKO mice. Vildagliptin improved glucose tolerance and increased levels of plasma insulin in wild-type mice, but no improvement in glycemia or changes in plasma insulin levels were detected in vildagliptin-treated DIRKO mice, demonstrating the requirement for GIP and GLP-1R signaling for transduction of the chronic glucose-lowering actions of DPP4 inhibitors (164). In contrast, selective changes in expression of genes regulating hepatic lipid metabolism were seen in both wild-type and vildagliptin-treated DIRKO mice.",

Although GLP-1 and GIP receptors on islet \u03b2-cells are logical candidates, levels of intact circulating GLP-1 and GIP are low, and a considerable proportion of intact GLP-1 and GIP is degraded shortly after secretion from gut endocrine cells (165). Studies in rodents using doses of sitagliptin sufficient to inhibit intestinal but not systemic DPP4 activity implicate local intestinal-neural GLP-1R-dependent mechanisms for potentiation of glucoregulatory actions of DPP4 inhibitors (166); however, the existence and potential importance of similar circuits in humans is difficult to determine. Furthermore, selective genetic restoration of GLP-1R signaling only in Glp1r\u2212/\u2212 \u03b2-cells, but not in the brain or most neurons, is sufficient to normalize glucose intolerance in Glp1r\u2212/\u2212 mice (167). Hence, elucidation of potential sites, including peripheral and central neuronal circuits and islet cells contributing to DPP4-dependent glucoregulation, is challenging. Collectively, the available data demonstrate that GLP-1 and GIP are necessary and sufficient to explain the glucoregulatory actions of DPP4 inhibitors in mice; however, additional DPP4 substrates may be involved in mediating other metabolic nonglycemic actions ascribed to DPP4 inhibition.",

Aulinger et al (175) assessed the importance of endogenous GLP-1 for the glucose-lowering effects of sitagliptin in human diabetic subjects (mean HbA1c, 6.2%; BMI, 27.7 kg/m2). Subjects were studied using oral and iv glucose tolerance tests and acute administration of sitagliptin or placebo, in the presence or absence of iv exendin [9\u201339] (175). Sitagliptin increased fasting levels of intact GLP-1 and GIP, and consistent with tonic feedback inhibition of GLP-1 secretion by active GLP-1, exendin [9\u201339] further increased fasting levels of active GLP-1 in the presence of sitagliptin. Exendin [9\u201339] partially reversed (by about 50%) the glucose reduction observed with sitagliptin treatment during the oral glucose tolerance test (175). Sitagliptin alone suppressed levels of plasma glucagon during the oral glucose tolerance test, whereas coadministration of exendin [9\u201339] led to significant increases in plasma glucagon levels in sitagliptin-treated subjects. These findings are consistent with an important role for augmentation of GLP-1R signaling in the DPP4 inhibitor-mediated suppression of glucagon secretion and oral glucose tolerance (175). The partial, but not complete, reversal of sitagliptin-mediated improvements in glycemic control with exendin [9\u201339] is entirely consistent with mouse studies implicating a key role for both GLP-1 and GIP in the glucose-lowering actions of DPP4 inhibitors (52, 163).",

Although the EXAMINE trial reported no statistically significant increase in hospitalization for heart failure in patients randomized to alogliptin, a small numeric excess of heart failure events was noted in alogliptin-treated subjects. The Vildagliptin in Ventricular Dysfunction Diabetes (VIVIDD) trial (194) was conducted in patients with type 2 diabetes and functional heart failure (Class I-III, New York Heart Association). There were no differences in left ventricular function reported after 1 year in patients randomized to vildagliptin or placebo, but an increase in left ventricular end-diastolic volume was reported for patients randomized to vildagliptin (195). Therefore, the current clinical trial data in patients with established cardiovascular disease does not support the data from preclinical studies suggesting that DPP4 inhibitors are cardioprotective.",

In prospective clinical trials, where flow-mediated dilatation (FMD) of the brachial artery was measured in patients with type 2 diabetes treated with sitagliptin (50 mg/d) or the \u03b1 glucosidase inhibitor, voglibose (0.6 mg/d), endothelial function was significantly improved after 12 weeks of treatment (197). In contrast, data from other clinical trials assessing changes in vascular function after treatment with DPP4 inhibitors reveal different outcomes. Men with type 2 diabetes that received sitagliptin (50 mg/d) for 6 weeks exhibited significantly attenuated FMD, whereas treatment with voglibose (0.9 mg/d) had no effect on FMD. Furthermore, both sitagliptin (50 mg/d) and alogliptin (25 mg/d) significantly reduced FMD in subjects with type 2 diabetes (198). Hence, it is not possible to make clear conclusions about the effects of DPP4 inhibitors on endothelial function in diabetic subjects.",

However, van Poppel et al (211) found no effect of 4-week therapy with vildagliptin vs acarbose on plasma cytokine levels or cytokine production ex vivo in mononuclear cells from subjects with type 2 diabetes. Moreover, no significant differences in plasma levels of TGF-\u03b2, plasma cytokine or chemokine levels, or proportions of major B- and T-cell lymphocyte subsets, including numbers of regulatory T cells, were observed in healthy human subjects treated with placebo or sitagliptin 100 mg daily for 28 days (212). Despite considerable evidence linking DPP4 to control of retroviral entry, selective inhibition of DPP4 activity in HIV-positive human subjects treated with sitagliptin, 100 mg daily, for up to 26 weeks had no effect on CD4+ T cells, levels of plasma HIV RNA, or plasma chemokine levels (213). Hence, although multiple studies report modulation of inflammation and immune parameters after reduction of DPP4 activity, most studies examining anti-inflammatory actions of DPP4 inhibitors do not control for the indirect beneficial consequences of improving metabolic control. Furthermore, some of the effects of DPP4 in mediating viral entry or immune function are independent of its catalytic activity. Hence, it remains unclear whether partial selective reduction of DPP4 enzymatic activity directly regulates inflammation or the cellular immune response in preclinical and clinical settings.",

Multiple studies in rats and mice demonstrate renoprotective actions of DPP4 inhibitors in experimental kidney injury, often associated with a reduction in albumin excretion, reduced expression of inflammatory markers, and decreased oxidative stress. Liu et al (218) demonstrated that sitagliptin improved renal blood flow and endothelium-dependent relaxation in renal arteries and decreased blood pressure in rats with spontaneous hypertension, findings attenuated by inhibition of cAMP or GLP-1R signaling. However, in most studies, the molecular mechanisms through which DPP4 inhibition attenuates renal injury have not been identified. Similarly, several clinical trials demonstrate reduction of microalbuminuria in subjects with type 2 diabetes treated with DPP4 inhibitors (219); however, there are little mechanistic data linking reduction of DPP4 activity to improvements in kidney function independent of changes in glucose, inflammation, or blood pressure.",

Furthermore, despite the potential importance of DPP4 for cleavage of target substrates, many putative DPP4 substrates are cleaved by multiple enzymes, and their disappearance from plasma is largely regulated by renal and, to a lesser extent, hepatic clearance. Hence, identification of a dominant role for DPP4 in controlling peptide bioactivity is often challenging. New methodologies using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry-based technology to perform global peptide profiling are discovering novel DPP4 substrates by directly measuring changes in levels of intact vs cleaved peptides in response to genetic deletion or catalytic inhibition of DPP4 (223\u2013226). These types of analyses should expedite identification of multiple new physiological DPP4 substrates and will generate new hypotheses surrounding the mechanisms of action of DPP4 inhibitors. The combination of modern peptide profiling technology with state of the art biochemistry represents a powerful promising approach for deciphering the mechanisms and key substrates transducing classical and novel actions of DPP4 inhibitors in animals and humans.",
