Of the 83 children admitted between April 2009 and March 2010 with H1N1 virus infection to a tertiary children's hospital in a European setting, five children aged between 2 and 10 years had neurological symptoms. Four patients had seizures and encephalopathy at presentation. One patient presented with ataxia; one developed neuropsychiatric manifestations, and two developed movement disorders during the disease course. Early neuroimaging showed evidence of acute necrotising encephalopathy (ANE) in one case and nonspecific white matter changes in another. Initial neuro-imaging was normal for the other three, but interval MRI showed increased signal in bilateral periventricular distribution in one and significant cerebral volume loss in the other. Clinical outcomes varied: two recovered fully while three had residual seizures and/or significant cognitive deficits. Conclusion An analysis of our patients along with all reported cases reveal that seizures and encephalopathy were common neurological presentations associated with pandemic 2009 H1N1 influenza virus infection in children requiring hospital admission. Neuroimaging suggestive of ANE, basal ganglia involvement and volume loss appears to be associated with worse neurological outcome.",

Thus, the variation of incidence ranging from 2% to 15% from various studies is likely to reflect either the referral bias of the reporting institution or the inclusion of patients with underlying seizure disorder or neurological conditions. Seizures and altered sensorium were the most common neurological symptoms, occurring in four of five patients in our series. Four of the five patients presented with encephalopathy, of which two met the criteria for encephalitis. Three of our patients required intensive care support for control of seizures and one for encephalopathy. Such severity of neurological complications associated with 2009 H1N1 influenza virus accords with that reported in the largest American series where ten out of 18 patients required intensive care admission [7] . Two of our patients developed both seizures and movement disorders; one developed neuropsychiatric manifestation during the disease evolution and is only the second reported case of this complication associated with the 2009 H1N1 pandemic strain [11] . Movement disorders following viral encephalitis have generally been associated with basal ganglia involvement [20, 21, 37] . Interestingly, while two of the cases reported here developed a movement disorder in the convalescent phase, neither had evidence of basal ganglia involvement on neuroimaging. The abnormal movements improved in both cases at follow-up.",

Acutely, only two of our five cases had abnormal neuroimaging: one showed evidence of ANE and another showed non-specific white matter changes. Although initial neuroimaging was normal for the other three patients, the interval MRI was abnormal in two. One showed increased signal in periventricular distribution bilaterally, the other revealed significant loss of cerebral volume. Normal acute imaging followed by brain atrophy is well described with IAE, most patients being left with marked neurological sequelae [2, 46] , as in our patient.

IV zanamivir was supplied on a compassionate basis by Glaxo-Smith-Kline (Brentford, England) and is thought to carry the same efficacy as oseltamivir [19] . Although the use of antiviral medications can decrease the risk of complications from influenza [6, 27] , specific neuro-therapeutic effect is uncertain [25] . In line with previous reports, it was not possible to determine whether antiviral treatment decreased the severity or improved neurological outcome in this series or in the other reported cases. IVIG was given in three patients for potentially immunomodulatory effects, indicated by the severity of presentation. While the timing of IVIG administration may influence its likelihood of conferring benefit, this series is too small to allow any inference to be drawn. There was little evidence of benefit in two patients. The third patient, with ANE, made complete recovery (case 2). This clinical outcome is unusual when compared with reported cases [2, 23, 24, 26, 33, 45] but cannot be attributed to any individual therapeutic intervention given the complex multi-therapeutic interventions the child received concurrently.",

While we await the emerging epidemiology of H1N1 and other strains of influenza in coming seasons, early consideration of influenza strains as a cause when children present with neurologic symptoms is advocated, given the potential for significant long-term sequelae especially in previously healthy children (57% of reported cases; 34/59). Normal neuroimaging at presentation should not be over-interpreted; interval imaging is advocated if recovery is not swift. Neuroimaging suggestive of ANE, basal ganglia involvement and volume loss appears to be associated with worse neurological outcome. Whether early treatment with antiviral drugs improves neurologi-cal outcome is unknown, but until there is evidence to guide management, early antiviral therapy is advocated. The role of immunomodulatory adjuvant therapy, however, remains speculative and likely should be reserved for the most severe cases.",
