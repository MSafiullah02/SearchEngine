            "text": "Gastrointestinal (GI) hemorrhage is an important cause of blood loss anemia and a potentially life-threatening condition in dogs.1 It is reported less frequently in cats. It may be acute or chronic, occult (no visible blood) or overt (grossly visible blood), and can vary from mild, self-limiting states to severe life-threatening conditions. Significant GI hemorrhage can often be detected during history and physical examination. However, on occasion even acute severe GI hemorrhage may be overlooked if signs localizing blood loss to the GI tract are not present or if concurrent disease obscures the diagnosis.2,3 In addition, because even mild cases may progress to life-threatening events, it is important to rapidly identify patients with GI hemorrhage and institute therapies to prevent their deterioration.",

In general, these can be divided into three broad categories: diseases causing ulcers, diseases causing coagulopathies, and diseases associated with vascular anomalies.
