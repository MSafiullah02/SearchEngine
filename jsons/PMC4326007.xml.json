Since then, the developments in virology and genomics have completely changed the concept of viruses. We now realize that viruses are ubiquitous and enormously abundant, in terms of both infecting all known cellular life forms and being present in all explored environments. Actually, viruses appear to be the most abundant biological entities on the planet, substantially outnumbering cells in most well-studied habitats [1, 2\u2022, 3\u2022]. The genetic diversity of viruses is enormous as well: the majority of distinct genes in the biosphere seem to reside in viral genomes [4]. Beyond their quantitative dominance, virus genome sizes, gene repertoires and particle sizes and shapes are extremely variable. Moreover, viruses exploit all theoretically conceivable strategies of genome replication and expression, in contrast to the uniform replication-expression cycle of cellular life forms.",

This interaction is commonly pictured as an arms race in which the hosts constantly evolve new means of defense which viruses perpetually evolve to evade [7]. Although this scenario captures important aspects of virus\u2013host coevolution, there is more to the story. Not only do viruses hijack host genes for counter-defense and other functions, but cellular hosts as well routinely recruit viral genes for diverse roles. Viruses that evolve at high rates might comprise the principal source of novel genes in the biosphere [8]. In particular, genetic material coming from virus-like retro-transcribing elements apparently dominates vertebrate and plant genomes [9, 10].",

The only variation on this theme is occasional reverse transcription of RNA that is typically non-essential for genome replication, an important exception being the telomere synthesis in eukaryotes. In a sharp contrast, viruses exploit effectively all possible combinations of DNA and RNA interconversions: the replicating genome that is incorporated into virions can be represented by either RNA or DNA, and the replication-expression cycles of RNA viruses can include a DNA intermediate and vice versa (Figure 1\n) [11, 12]. Furthermore, the selfish elements with the smallest known genomes, the viroids, are autonomously replicating small non-coding RNAs [13].",

The virus genome sizes is tightly linked to the genome structure and replication-expression strategy: the genomes that are larger than \u223c30 kb always consist of dsDNA, conceivably due to physical constraints on genome stability and topological malleability.

This exploration is feasible because viruses, being the ultimate parasites, possess small genomes that can be efficiently replicated as all forms of nucleic acids.

Therefore, it is tempting to think of the virus world as the primordial genomic \u2018laboratory\u2019, perhaps the direct descendant of a pre-cellular stage of evolution [12]. However, the emergence of different classes of viruses through the \u2018escape\u2019 of different forms of host nucleic acids is conceptually plausible as well.

In each sequenced virome, the great majority of the sequences represent \u2018dark matter\u2019, that is, have no detectable homologs in the current databases, and there is no sign of saturation as sequencing progresses [4, 23, 24]. Although complete viral genomes typically contain a greater fraction of genes with homologs than viromes, these genomes also encompass numerous ORFans, that is, genes that are restricted to a narrow virus group [25]. Analysis of the phyletic spread of bacteriophage genes using the Phage Orthologous Groups (POGs) has shown that an overwhelming majority of the POGs include a small number of phages and viruses of archaea, whereas none are represented in the majority of the analyzed genomes (Figure 2\n) [26\u2022]. This seemingly unlimited diversity of virus genes contrasts the case of cellular organisms that include a substantial core of common genes [27]. Although precise estimates of the total gene pools of viruses and cellular organisms require better sampling and more sophisticated models of evolution than those currently available, it is almost certain that a majority of the distinct genes in the biosphere reside in viral genomes.

These \u2018viral hallmark genes\u2019 encode the essential viral functions including the capsid protein of icosahedral viruses, RNA and DNA polymerases, distinct helicases involved in genome replication, integrases that catalyze insertion of viral DNA into host genomes, and several others (Figure 3).

The parsimonious explanation of these findings appears to be that the hallmark genes became isolated from the cellular genomes at the earliest stages of evolution and ever since comprised the framework of the temporally and spatially continuous, expanding virus world. By contrast, the confinement of the hallmark genes to the virus world is hardly compatible with the escaped genes scenario. Furthermore, this \u2018ancient virus world\u2019 hypothesis [12] implies the primordial origin of diverse viral replication-expression strategies as opposed to the derivation of these strategies from elements of cellular information processing systems. Specifically, positive-strand RNA, retrotranscribing, ssDNA and dsDNA virus-like elements all can be inferred to have evolved within the primordial gene pool. The dsRNA and negative-strand RNA viruses that carry their replication machinery within the virions are likely to have evolved later. In particular, negative-strand RNA viruses probably originated in animals, with a subsequent horizontal transfer to plant hosts [29\u2022].",

Under this scenario, positive-strand RNA viruses are indeed direct descendants of the primordial RNA-protein world whereas the reverse-transcribing elements provide the means for the transition to the DNA world. The pre-cellular stage of evolution can be envisaged as a pool of small, virus-like genetic elements in which all the genomic strategies evolved and the separation between viruses and cellular life forms was precipitated by the gradual accretion of small dsDNA elements into large molecules (Figure 4\n) (the nature of the primordial compartmentalization is beyond the scope of this article; several models have been developed). The capsids might have evolved at this stage of evolution and would protect genomes of the primordial genetic elements and facilitate their dissemination [12]. This model goes beyond the notion that viruses coexisted with cells at all stages of evolution by suggesting that evolution of life actually started with a virus-like stage, with the advent of modern-type cells being a comparatively late event [30].",

It has been argued that the fundamental divide among life forms lies between viruses, the capsid-encoding organisms, and cellular, ribosome-encoding organisms [31]. A related concept of the capsid as the viral \u2018self\u2019 is compatible with the extremely broad presence of the icosahedral virus capsid protein (the jelly roll fold) [32] in diverse viruses infecting bacteria, archaea, and eukaryotes although numerous distinct capsid proteins exist as well [33\u2022]. Given the autonomy, vastness and diversity of the virus world, and its connectedness through the hallmark genes, the placement of the primary divide among life forms between viruses and cells appears unassailable. However, this division fails to give justice to the virus world that by no means is limited to typical capsid-encoding viruses. On the contrary, each of the major classes of viruses shows clear evolutionary connections to capsid-less genetic elements that are established through shared hallmark genes (and some additional genes) (Figure 3, Figure 4).",

Moreover, all prokaryotic reverse-transcribing elements are capsid-less, clearly indicating that retroviruses are derived forms. In addition, through the integrase, these elements are linked to the ubiquitous dsDNA transposons all of which are capsid-less. The rolling circle replicating ssDNA viruses show a clear-cut relationship with numerous plasmids that replicate via the same mechanism and with which they share two hallmark genes [35\u2022\u2022]. In the case of plant geminiviruses, evidence has been presented in support of a particular direction of evolution: these viruses appear to have emerged via recombination between a bacterial plasmid and a plant RNA virus [36]. The opposite direction of evolution is exemplified by the positive-strand RNA viruses that gave rise to at least three distinct groups of capsid-less RNA elements, the narnaviruses, the endornaviruses and the hypoviruses [37].",

This coevolution is often described as arms race [7], and undoubtedly, this description reflects a key aspect of the interaction between the virus world and the cellular life forms. Indeed, all cellular organisms, with the exception of the most degraded intracellular parasitic bacteria, possess multilayered systems of antivirus defense, or more broadly defined, defense against invasion of foreign genetic material. Most if not all cellular organisms employ multiple principles of defense that include firstly, innate immunity, secondly, adaptive immunity, and thirdly, programmed cell death (induction of dormancy). Until recently, the two latter systems were considered eukaryotic innovations. However, the discovery of the prokaryotic system of heritable adaptive immunity, CRISPR-Cas (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats [CRISPR] and CRISPR-Associated genes) [38\u2022, 39] and the detailed characterization of the toxin\u2013antitoxin (TA) systems that mediate cell death or induce dormancy [40, 41] have drastically transformed the entire concept of the evolution of antivirus defense. These findings show that all three major branches of antivirus defense are intrinsic to the survival of all cellular life forms and most likely emerged at the earliest stages of evolution (although innovation and diversification of these systems in multicellular eukaryotes are certainly spectacular). Moreover, comparative analysis of prokaryotic genomic loci encoding defense systems strongly suggests that the three branches of defense intimately interact, with cells \u2018making decisions\u2019 to proceed either via the route of active immune response or via the route of damage control by programmed cell death, depending on the genotoxic stress level [42, 43\u2022\u2022].

The prokaryotic TA systems are typically encoded in small, compact operons that are transferred on plasmids and show addictive properties, that is, the toxin kills cells that lack the TA genes [46]. Restriction-modification systems, the principal innate immunity machinery in prokaryotes, similarly show mobile, selfish behavior [47]. Bacterial phage-defense islands, such as Staphylococcal pathogenicity islands (SaPIs), engage in a particularly striking form of selfish behavior. These defective prophage-like elements are excised from bacterial chromosmes, circularized and induced to replicate by helper phage infection with which they then interfere [48\u2022\u2022, 49\u2022].",

Large viruses (e.g. dsDNA bacteriophages or animal poxviruses) encode multiple proteins that counteract immunity mechanisms or prevent programmed cell death [50, 51]. The repertoire of viral counter-defense proteins is constantly growing, and in large viruses, such genes appear to comprise the majority [52]. The study of the counter-defense, especially in viruses of prokaryotes, is only starting in earnest, and undoubtedly, numerous novel mechanisms that target specific defense systems of the host remain to be discovered [53\u2022, 54\u2022\u2022]. Remarkably, some bacteriophages incorporate host CRISPR-Cas systems and deploy them against other host phage-defense islands [55\u2022\u2022]. Even small viruses often encode dedicated counter-defense genes, such as RNA interference suppressors that were identified in numerous plant RNA viruses [56, 57], whereas other small viruses encode dual function \u2018security proteins\u2019 that counteract programmed cell death [58]. Thus, the coevolution of multiple layers of defense and counter-defense is immanent to virus\u2013host interaction and hence to life itself.",

            "text": "A major consequence of the evolution of antivirus mechanisms is the subsequent recruitment of the respective genes for distinct cellular functions. In both prokaryotes and eukaryotes, such functions involve DNA repair that, similar to defense, employs various nucleases and helicases. Another striking example is the recruitment of CRISPR-Cas for control of bacterial gene expression [62\u2022\u2022]. The extent of such conversion of defense systems in prokaryotes remains to be elucidated. In eukaryotes, conversion has taken truly dramatic forms. The quintessential eukaryotic regulation system, RNA interference, is thought to have evolved from an ancestral system of defense against RNA viruses [63]. Some of the key nucleases involved in RNA processing and degradation in eukaryotes evolved from prokaryotic toxin nucleases [64\u2022\u2022, 65\u2022]. Most of the proteins involved in DNA and protein (above all, histone) modification and chromatin remodeling in eukaryotes apparently evolved from prokaryotic ancestors that are involved in antivirus defense [66\u2022]. Thus, the entire phenomenon of epigenetic inheritance that is central to the eukaryotic life appears to be a derivative of antivirus defense systems. Moreover, under a plausible evolutionary scenario, the nucleus itself evolved as a defense device against prokaryotic self-splicing introns that invaded the proto-eukaryote genome to later give rise to spliceosomal introns [67, 68]. In the same vein, the mechanism of programmed cell death that is essential for normal development in plants and animals [69] originally evolved as a distinct strategy of antivirus defense (see above) that already implies a primitive form of cell differentiation. As generalized by Aravind and colleagues [64\u2022\u2022], \u201cbiological conflict systems served as evolutionary \u2018nurseries\u2019 for innovations in the protein world\u201d, and such innovations were central to major evolutionary transitions, in particular eukaryogenesis.",

Notably, the introns, an intrinsic feature of eukaryotic gene architecture and an essential source of protein diversity in complex eukaryotes, are recognized to originate from self-splicing Group II introns of prokaryotes that are reverse-transcribing selfish elements [74, 75]. Moreover, the majority of the genomic DNA in many animals and plants (up to two-thirds in humans and 90% in maize) appears to derive from mobile elements, primarily retrotransposons [76, 77\u2022]. Although most of these elements are non-functional, some are inevitably recruited for various roles, in particular regulatory ones, and given the extreme abundance of retroelements, the overall contribution of such recruitment appears to be quite substantial [9, 76]. Beyond these general trends, striking examples of key gene recruitment from selfish elements include the telomerase, an RT that is required from chromosome end replication in all eukaryotes and apparently was recruited from a bacterial Group II intron [34\u2022\u2022, 78], and syncytins, membrane proteins that are essential for placental development in mammals and were derived from retrovirus envelope glycoprotein-encoding genes [79\u2022].",

Mathematical modeling of evolution shows that the emergence of genomic parasites is a fundamental property of any evolving replicator system that exceeds a certain threshold of minimal complexity [81]. In game theoretical terms, cheaters inevitably evolve as soon as there is a chance to cheat, that is, when functions evolve that can be utilized for replication in trans, such as a replicase [82, 83]. The extant analogies include the evolution of defective interfering particles that parasitize on many viruses after shedding the capsid protein genes and scavenging capsids from the host virus [84], and in vitro evolution experiments in which minimal viral genomes evolve that may not encode any proteins at all [85]. Thus, the evolution of any replicator system that exceeds minimal complexity is a story of host\u2013parasite arms race and cooperation.",

In a simple, unstructured host\u2013parasite system, the inevitable outcome is stochastic extinction of both viruses and hosts. However, compartmentalization and, perhaps paradoxically, evolution of defense mechanisms stabilize the coevolving system as a whole [83]. Accordingly, cellular life forms evolved elaborate compartmentalization along with multiple defense strategies, embarking on the perennial arms race. Under this scenario, virus-like genomic parasites and the onset of the arms race far antedate the advent of modern-type cells and were key factors in the emergence of the cellular organization of life. Moreover, the first genomic parasites that consisted of RNA might have been the driving force behind the origin of DNA genomes because mathematical modeling suggests that dedicated information storage devices such as DNA can stabilize coevolution in a host\u2013parasite system [86\u2022].",
