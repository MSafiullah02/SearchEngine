These strategies often involve rapid changes in gene expression, which temporarily alter the phenotype of cells and allow them to survive. A more complex and persistent example of stress response is sporulation, in which the bacterial genome is isolated in a protected space (spore) until environmental conditions improve, at which point spores will germinate to form vegetative cells with reproductive capacity (Setlow 2014) . Among Grampositive bacteria, B. subtilis and a few similar species are the most commonly used experimental systems, and many studies have been conducted to assess the process and morphology of sporulation (Higgins and Dworkin 2012) .",

            "text": "It is challenging for B. subtilis to form spores; their formation is controlled by a series of regulatory and structural genes whose expressions themselves are tightly regulated (Bejerano-Sagie et al. 2006) . When nutrients are depleted, sporulation is triggered by the activation of histidine sensor kinases, including KinA, KinB, and KinC, which shuttle phosphate through an extended phosphorelay, resulting in p h o s p h o r y l a t i o n o f t h e m a s t e r r e g u l a t o r o f sporulation,transcription factor Spo0A (Molle et al. 2003) . KinA is the major kinase responsible for initiation of sporulation and KinA (or KinB) overexpression during exponential growth is sufficient to induce entry into sporulation (Fujita and Losick 2005) . In fact, inducing KinA synthesis beyond a certain level leads toentry into sporulation regardless of nutrient availability (Eswaramoorthy et al. 2010) . The effect of a kinC mutation on sporulation is weaker than that of kinA or kinB (Lopez et al. 2009 ). Phosphorylated Spo0A can directly activate or inhibit the transcription of many genes; it indirectly controls genes involved in asymmetric cell division and those involved in the activation of sporulation-specific sigma factors and ultimately promotes spore formation (Hilbert and Piggot 2004) . The formation of spores can be roughly divided into the following steps Higgins and Dworkin 2012) : In harsh environments, B. subtilis cells begin to form dormant spores that resist adverse environments, and the activity of \u03c3 H begins to increase. Cells then divide unequally using specific asymmetric septum to form large mother cells and a small forespore. The mother cell is necessary for spore formation, but it is eventually lysis and the prospore eventually produces a mature spore. Mother cell and prospore express different \u03c3 factors; \u03c3 E factors are expressed in mother cells, while \u03c3 F factors are expressed in prospores (Losick and Stragier 1992) , and phosphorylated Spo0A can induce the activation of \u03c3 E and \u03c3 F factors . After unequal division is completed, the maternal plasma membrane gradually encapsulates the forespore, so the outer membrane of the forespore encapsulates two layers of membrane structure. After that, the activated or synthesized \u03c3 G and \u03c3 K begin to induce gene expression in the forespore and mother cell. Lastly, specific structures such as spore crust, cortex, and spore coat are gradually synthesized. The cortex is composed of peptidoglycan (PG), which is located between the inner and outer membrane of spore, and spore PG precursors are synthesized in the mother cell (Popham 2002) . The spore coat is formed in the mother cell and covers the outer surface of the prospore (Henriques and Moran 2007; Kim et al. 2006) . Dipicolinic acid (DPA) synthesized in the mother cell gradually fills the forespores, which could help the forespores dehydrate continuously, the mother cell lyses, and mature spore is generated (Fig. 2) (McKenney et al. 2013 ).",

SpoIVA binds and hydrolyzes ATP, allowing it to self-assemble into cable-like structures (Setlow 2012; Ramamurthi and Losick 2008 ) that form a basement layer that serves as a platform for coat assembly. Other proteins involved in assembly are SpoVID that directly interacts with SpoIVA (Mullerova et al. 2009; Wang et al. 2009 ) and SafA, which is necessary for the encasement of the spore (Mullerova et al. 2009 ). SafA was found to affect the localization of about 16 inner coat protein fusions (McKenney et al. 2010 ) substantiating its central role in coat assembly. Three layers of the B. subtilis spore coat are observed in thin-section electron microscopy: an inner coat, an outer coat, and crust (Warth et al. 1963; McKenney et al. 2010) . The outer coat is indispensable for spore formation, yet its specific functions remain unclear. Compared with the outer coat of spores, the inner coat is a selective permeability barrier that protects spore DNA from being destroyed by some chemical agents (McKenney et al. 2013) . The spore coat makes spores resistant to chemical reagents and external lysozymes, and prevents the nuclei from being degraded or ingested by protozoa (Setlow 2006) ; however, the resistance to heat, radiation, and some other chemical reagents is poorly understood (Borch-Pedersen et al. 2016 ).",

The structure of the PG is similar to that in vegetative cell wall, but in cortex, the structure is relatively loose, which is extremely important for maintaining spore resistance and dormancy (Aguilar et al. 2007; Higgins and Dworkin 2012) . Because some amino acid residues of N-acetylmuramic acid of PG in the spore cortex are replaced by short peptides, the degree of cross-linking of PG in cortex is lower than that of PG in vegetative cell wall (Popham 2002) . In addition, B. subtilis spore-cortex PG was found to be O-acetylated, a common PG modification that reduces sensitivity to the innate immune anti-microbial lysozyme (Laaberki et al. 2011 ). However, since lysozyme is unable to penetrate the outer coat (Driks 1999) , this modification would not appear to be useful. ",

Its expression and assembly require the assistance of a variety of regulatory factors and proteins (Kodama et al. 2011; Zilhao et al. 2004 ). The expression of cotB is regulated by the maternal cellspecific sigma factors and transcription regulators GerE and GerR (Cangiano et al. 2010 ). CotB has a strongly hydrophilic C-terminus, which is composed of three serine-rich repeats; the serine residues accounts for more than 50% of the CotB C-terminus. Some studies have shown that CotB modification requires the involvement of CotG and CotH , and CotG is known to interact directly with CotB. Mutation of cotG results in the accumulation of a 46-kDa CotB protein in cells, but the specific mechanisms for this remain unclear. CotH, or proteins regulated by CotH, can prevent CotG from being hydrolyzed by proteases in the cell before assembling into spores, and it has an indirect regulatory effect on CotB ). Isticato et al. deleted the amino acid residue in position 105 of the CotB Cterminus (CotB\u0394105), used CotB\u0394105 as an anchoring protein, and integrated the tetanus toxin gene into the amylase gene locus of the cotB-deleted B. subtilis genome. It was found that exogenous protein could not be expressed in spores, which proved that the fusion protein could not be assembled on the surface of spores in the absence of the original cotB gene (Henriques and Moran 2007) . Therefore, the cotB, cotG, and cotH genes of B. subtilis should be retained when CotB is being used as an anchor to display exogenous proteins.",

In contrast, overexpression of cotH allows the accumulation of CotC in the mother cell compartment, suggesting that CotH, or a CotH-dependent factor, acts to prevent degradation of CotC in the mother cell and then allows its assembly within the coat (Baccigalupi et al. 2004 ). The mechanism of assembly of CotC is of interest, as the abundant CotC protein has been used as a vehicle for the display of heterologous proteins at the spore surface (Isticato et al. 2007 ). At present, heat-labile enterotoxin B subunit, urea, ethanol dehydrogenase, \u03b2-galactosidase, proinsulin, enolase, and trehalose synthase have all been successfully displayed on the spore surface using CotC as molecular carrier, which improves their tolerance to harsh environments (Hinc et al. 2010b; Romero et al. 2007 ).",

Like CotC, the expression of CotG is also indirectly regulated by GerR because GerR can activate SpoVIF, which plays an active role in GerE and GerE-dependent genes (Cangiano et al. 2010) . The assembly of CotG on spore surfaces is mainly as 32-and 36-kDa proteins. Thirty-two kilodalton CotG may be formed by abnormal migration of unmodified initial proteins. Thirty-six kilodalton CotG may be produced by extensive cross-linking of proteins when proteins are assembled into the spore coat (Eichenberger et al. 2004) . Like CotB and CotC, CotG assembly also requires cotH expression. CotH protects CotG from protease hydrolysis before sporulation, which is essential for the formation and assembly of CotG (Naclerio et al. 1996; Zilhao et al. 2004 ). Therefore, cotH should be retained when CotG is used as anchoring protein to display exogenous proteins (Saggese et al. 2014 ).",

Sun et al. (2018) displayed CsPmy on the spore surface using CotC as anchoring protein. The expression of CsPmy on the spore surface was analyzed by SDS-PAGE, Western blot analysis, and immunofluorescence assay, and the results showed that CsPmy was successfully expressed on spore surfaces and the fusion protein had good thermostability. Specific IgGs in sera and intestinal mucosa were increased after intraperitoneal and intragastrical immunization. Oral immunization with B. subtilis spore expressing CsPmy on the surface was a promising, safe, and needle-free vaccination strategy against clonorchiasis (Mingmongkolchai and Panbangred 2018) . In addition, CsPmy, CsCP, TP20.8, CsTP22.3, and CsLAP2 have also been successfully displayed on spore surfaces for immunization against clonorchiasis sinensis (Tang et al. 2017; Zhou et al. 2008a ).

They are characterized by high catalytic efficiency, high specificity, and low pollution in the production process. It can be difficult to separate enzymes from substrates, and the reaction conditions are usually strictly controlled. This leads the enzymes to be easily inactivated and makes their reuse difficult. However, enzymes can be easily separated from their substrates by displaying them on the surface of spores. The excellent stress resistance of spores can enhance the stability of enzymes in complex environments and promote the reuseabilty of enzymes. He et al. produced D-allulose by using D-psicose 3epimerase (DPEase) expressed and displayed on the surface of B. subtilis spores. DPEase was fused at the C-terminus of the anchoring protein, CotZ, via a peptide linker, and trophic genes were used as selection markers during chromosomal integration. The optimal temperature and pH of the fusion protein CotZ-DPEase were 55\u00b0C and pH 7.5-8.0, respectively, and the anchored DPEase exhibited high thermostability. Under optimal conditions, 60% of the yield was maintained after five cycles of utilization. Therefore, this biocatalyst system, capable of expressing and immobilizing DPEase on the spore surface of B. subtilis, was an appropriate alternative for D-allulose production (He et al. 2016) . Lipases expressed in microbial hosts have great commercial value, but their applications are restricted by the high costs of production and harsh conditions used in industrial processes. Chen et al. successfully displayed the thermophilic lipase Tm1350 on the B. subtilis spore surface. The results showed that spore surface-displayed Tm1350 had more stable enzyme activity than free enzyme. Meanwhile, recycling experiments showed that the recombinant spores could be used for up to three reaction cycles without a significant decrease in catalytic rate (84%) (Chen et al. 2015a ). These studies have played a positive role in development of the application of spore surface-displayed enzymes in the industrial field.",

B. subtilis spore surface display provides feasible avenues to improve industrial production efficiency, while providing for food and biological safety. At the same time, there are still some problems in spore surface display, such as the limited number of anchoring proteins on the spore surface, which is not conducive to a large number of exogenous proteins.
