These proteins are SARS coronavirus peptidase (2GTB) [11], SARS-COV-2 Protease (6LU7) [10], Spike Glycoprotein (6VSB) [8], NSP-9 replicase protein (6W4B) [12] and NSP-15 endoribonuclease (6VWW) [13]. ModRefiner was used for structure refinement and energy minimization of these protein receptors [19]. The refined protein structures were used to predict their active site residues using Metapocket 2.0 [20] and subsequently exploited for docking analysis. Medicinal compounds, known for antiviral and the immunomodulatory activity [14\u201316,18], were selected as ligands and prepared with the PRODRG server [21] prior to docking. The entire docking study was facilitated by Autodock vina equipped with Raccoon2 (a virtual screening plugin), and the ligands were focused at the predicted active site of the viral protein receptors to perform site-specific docking to procure potential inhibitors. The successful ligands obtained from screening analysis were further investigated for ADMET (absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion and toxicity) properties facilitated by GUSAR [22] and SwissADME database [23].",

These compounds (ligands) when focused at the active site of a particular protein (receptor) establish different types of chemical bonds with their active residues. These chemical bonds include hydrogen, Vanderwaal, salt bridges, \u03c0\u2013\u03c0 interaction, \u03c0-sigma bond, \u03c0-sulfur and many other hydrophobic interactions. Among these bonds, hydrogen bonds play a critical role in protein\u2013ligand interaction and lower the binding energy in order to stabilize the docked complex [24]. It is already established that when a protein active site is blocked by a chemical substrate (ligand) this abrogates its functional enzymatic activity. This approach was adopted to find novel inhibitors for SARS-COV-2 by inhibiting critical proteins responsible for virus attachment and replication. More than 300 medicinal compounds with immunomodulatory and antiviral activity were added to the Raccoon2 plugin of Autodock vina to perform virtual screening to obtain promising inhibitors for SARS-COV-2 proteins. Both target proteins and compounds were prepared for docking studies by subjecting them for energy minimization and structure refinement. Molecular docking was performed by exposing these compounds to the predicted active site residues of these viral proteins. The results obtained from this analysis were filtered based on compounds interaction with the active site residues, low binding energy and hydrogen and hydrophobic interaction. It was observed that, among these medicinal compounds, only six compounds showed promising interaction with the active site of SARS proteins as summarized in Table 1 and molecularly represented in Figure 1 and Supplementary Figures 1, 3, 5 and 7, respectively.",

Some compounds showed similar binding affinity for the active residues of these viral proteins to establish hydrogen bonds, such as in the case of peptidases (2GTB), Threonine-111 and Asparagine-151 were favored by Arzanol, Ferulic acid and Thymohydroquinone while Threonine-199 by Genistein, and Resveratrol as shown in Figure 2. For protease (6LU7), compounds like Arzanol, Genistein and Rosmanol preferred Asparagine-142 and Glutamine-189 for interaction (Supplementary Figure 2), whereas in spike glycoprotein (6VSB), all the compounds except Arzanol shared a common residue Serine-591 for bond formation (Supplementary Figure 4). Among nonstructural proteins, Arginine-40, Serine-60 of NSP-9 replicase (6W4B) protein are involved in forming hydrogen bonds with all compounds except for Genistein that has chemical affinity for Valine-42 (Supplementary Figure 6). For NSP-15 endoribonuclease (6VVW), Tyrosine-279 was the common binding residue for Arzanol and Rosmanol (Supplementary Figure 8). The binding energy observed for these compounds was approximately 5\u20137.0 kcal/mol and they were further subjected for ligand conformational analysis, which was predicted by the LigRMSD database [25]. The prime purpose of root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) analysis is to evaluate experimentally solved ligand structure against predicted docked ligand conformations. The predicted value of the RMSD for these compounds was approximately 0.9\u20131.5 \u00c5, which is considered successful and stable. A value beyond 2 \u00c5 indicates instability and aberrancy in ligand conformation and docking parameters.",

The lipophilicity of arzanol had a LogPO/W value of 3.42 that indicates high sublingual absorption, whereas for other compounds the value remained in between 1.3 and 2.8 suggesting high oral, intestinal and central nervous system absorption. All these compounds possess high gastrointestinal absorption and water-soluble capability and ferulic acid, resveratrol and thymohydroquinone are permeable to the blood\u2013brain barrier. Out of six compounds, two of them; ferulic acid and resveratrol are CYP1A2 inhibitors, which increases the drug half-life of these compounds and also avert serious drug interactions.

WHO approved chloroquine on an emergency basis and hydroxychloroquine based on promising in vitro and clinical results [26]. But in hindsight, these drugs are highly toxic, capable of jeopardizing patient\u2019s health by disrupting essential heart and neurological functions [27,28]. On the other hand, hundreds of different anti-HIV protease inhibitors have been reported that are capable of terminating SARS-COV-2 viral replication and RNA extension. However, these viruses possess proof-reading and other coping mechanisms to attenuate the interaction, thus making these antiprotease drugs inefficient as evident from recent clinical trials [9,28,29]. To address these problems, we utilized a novel approach by gathering medicinal compounds with antiviral and immunomodulatory activity to check their inhibitory interaction against critical SARS-COV-2 proteins. The viral proteins include structural proteins such as spike glycoprotein that allow these viral particles to attach themselves to ACE-2 receptor of the host cell, whereas nonstructural proteins (NSP-9, NSP-15) facilitate viral replication and proteases modulate the production of different proteins through proteolytic cleavage of SARS-COV-2 polyproteins. This study aimed to obtain novel drug candidates that have the capability to interact with the active site of all of these viral proteins and should possess efficient pharmacokinetic profile with low toxicity to ensure safety during administration.",

These structurally refined molecules were used and added to raccoon2 virtual screening plugin of Autodock vina to perform virtual screening of these ligands and to filter out possible drug candidates establishing hydrogen bonds, other than Vanderwaal interaction, with the active site residues of these viral protein receptors. Only six medicinal compounds: arzanol, ferulic acid, genistein, resveratrol, rosmanol and thymohydroquinone formed hydrogen bonds with these viral proteins. These compounds were further analyzed for ligand RMSD to evaluate their interaction stability through LigRMSD [25]. The predicted value of RMSD of these compounds was in between 0.9\u20131.5 \u00c5, which is considered adequate and stable [30].",

Medicinal compounds combined with standard antiviral medications, synergistically ameliorate the inhibitory action on antiviral proteins [32], reduce toxic effects [33] promote tissue repair and alleviate patients\u2019 symptoms [16]. Incorporating these compounds with temporary approved anti-SARS drugs as adjuvants might develop and sustain good immunological response against this lethal infection. Another probable action of these compounds is to encourage phagocytotic functions, regulate the proliferation of macrophages and neutrophils and expedite the development of adaptive immunity by promoting T-cells cytokine production, natural killer cells activity and dendritic cells stimulation, which in reality takes 4\u20137 days for activation [14,16]. Such intervention might be able to build immunity and ameliorate the deplorable condition of SARS-COV-2-affected individuals.",
