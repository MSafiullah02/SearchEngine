To better understand the host selection of beta coronaviruses, the relationship of spike glycoprotein between SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 and other closely related beta coronaviruses has been analyzed. The result showed that bat SARS\u2010like CoV RaTG13, with 96.2% overall genome sequence identity,\n18\n is an inner joint neighbor of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 (Figure 2). In October 2019, it was reported that Sendai virus and coronavirus were the dominant viruses in the virome data of Malayan pangolins.\n19\n It is noteworthy that SARS\u2010CoV was the most widely distributed coronavirus in the pangolin samples. We blasted the SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 reads and found that the spike protein sequence was present in pangolin SARS\u2010like CoV (numbered SRR10168377 here). The S protein in pangolin SARS\u2010like CoV SRR10168377 (marked as red star) possesses only 75% similarity with SARS\u2010CoV\u20102, partly because there were more than 220 residues in the S2 subunit that had not been read in the virome data.

Studying selective stress may be helpful for assessing the variability and potential for host changes of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102. Based on a report,\n20\n the selective pressure analysis showed that genes (ORF10 and ORF7a) have a greater selective pressure, and Spike has an average pressure relative to the whole genome (Figure S2). The spike RBD\u2010receptor interaction is a key factor determining the host range of coronaviruses. The RBD sequences of spike protein from SARS\u2010CoV, bat, or pangolin SARS\u2010like CoV and SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 were aligned (Figure 3). There are some deletions from 473 to 490 residues in bat SARS\u2010like CoV, which are located in the external subdomain, and it seems that these viruses do not infect humans naturally, given that there is no direct evidence showing that bat SARS\u2010like CoV has ever infected humans. Interestingly, the SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 RBD sequence from 329 to 521 possesses 93% identity with pangolin SARS\u2010like CoV SRR10168377, which has higher than 89% similarity with bat SARS\u2010like CoV RaTG13 (Figure 3). Pangolin SARS\u2010like CoV SRR10168377 has only 85% similarity with bat SARS\u2010like CoV RaTG13, indicating that if focusing on only the spike RBD, pangolin SARS\u2010like CoV SRR10168377 has a higher probability to cross host barriers and infect humans.",

The difference in the whole structure of spike protein between SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 (red) and SARS\u2010CoV (green) was alimented, the coverage of the threading alignment was 0.83 (the number of aligned residues divided by the full\u2010length protein), and the normalized Z score of the threading alignment was 6.27 (>1 means a good alignment). The external subdomain in RBD has also been identified. The interaction model of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 with human ACE2 was then calculated by the PRISM 2.0 database (Figure 4B), which was generally similar to the structure of SARS\u2010CoV S protein binding with human receptor ACE2 (Figure 4C). Based on our results and two recent reports,\n21\n, \n22\n we noticed that SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 numbering S protein may bind to ACE2 through Leu455, Phe486, Gln493, Asn501, and Tyr505, only quartier is same as SARS\u2010CoV. In the external subdomain of SARS\u2010CoV, residues L472, N479, and T487 (SARS\u2010CoV numbering) are the main interfacing positions; mutations of these sites support S adaptation for binding to the human ACE2 better than civet ACE2.\n23\n At the residue position of 82 in the mouse receptor, asparagine of bat (Rhinolophus pearsonii) ACE2 may disrupt the interaction with Leu472 of SARS\u2010CoV RBD by steric interference hydrophobic contact, while Met82 in human receptor may interact with position 472 of RBD. Residues K479 and S487 in civet SARS\u2010CoV can effectively recognize civet ACE2, but bind with human ACE2 much less efficiently.\n23\n The residue Thr487 in RBD binds to Tyr41 and Lys353 in human ACE2 by van der Waals contacts,\n25\n and threonine at position 487 enhanced the affinity of most RBDs for civet and human ACE2.\n24\n Residues in positions 479 and 487 in SARS\u2010CoV correspond to the sites 493 and 501 in SARS\u2010CoV\u20102, respectively. Residues Tyr493 and Asp501 in bat SARS\u2010like CoV RaTG13 were replaced with Gln493 and Asn501 in SARS\u2010CoV\u20102, respectively, same as pangolin SARS\u2010like CoV SRR10168377.",

More than five substitutions were observed in turtle (Chrysemys picta bellii, Chelonia mydas, and Pelodiscus sinensis), pangolin (Manis javanica), and bat (both Rhinolophus sinicus and R. pearsonii) receptors in contrast to the theoretical infection\u2010permissive species, such as human, gorilla, and macaca (Table 1). Mouse and dog also have multiple (\u22655) substitutions while cat and hamster only contain three mutations in the region. It was showed that Lys31, Tyr41, and Lys353 mutations substantially interfere with the S1\u2010Ig association.\n24\n It is noteworthy that at position 41, all maintain tyrosine in all observed species, expect bats (both R. sinicus and R. pearsonii) substituted by histidine; at position 353, all contain lysine expect mouse, which contains His353. The turtle receptor at position 31 contains glutamine or glutamic acid and mouse receptor contains asparagine; other observed species all contain lysine, same as humans. Substitution of His353 with Lys353 in mouse ACE2 allows SARS\u2010CoV to infect murine cells,\n14\n indicating the importance of residue Lys353 binding with receptor. In addition, considering the function of position 41 in the interaction with receptor, tyrosine may possess higher affinity with Asn501 of RBD than histidine. From this perspective of Asn501 in RBD domain with the sites 41 and 353 of ACE2 receptor, it seems that turtles and pangolins are closer to humans than bat, indicating that turtles and pangolins may be the potential expanded hosts of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102.

Previous findings suggested that the snake is a probable wildlife animal reservoir for SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 based on its relative synonymous codon usage bias resembling snake compared with other animals.\n31\n Civets and dromedary, as the intermediate hosts of zoonotic SARS\u2010CoV and MERS\u2010CoV, live in different time and space environments. They nevertheless transmitted the coronaviruses to humans, which makes it difficult to find the intermediate hosts of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 in the short term. Analysis of the viral receptor\u2010binding sequences and host receptors helps to quickly target the possible intermediate hosts of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102. Compared with the illegally traded pangolins, turtles in the markets are more common and popular. This study provides information and possibilities that like snakes and pangolins, turtles (C. picta bellii, C. mydas, and P. sinensis) may also act as the potential intermediate hosts transmitting SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 to human, although much more needs to be confirmed.",
