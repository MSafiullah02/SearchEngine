The antibody\u2013antigen system is one of the most essential among all PPIs and plays a unique role in the study of PPIs. Antibodies are large proteins that serve important roles in the immune system by counteracting antigens\u2014chemicals recognized as alien by the human body. On the tip of an antibody, there is an antigen-binding fragment that contains a paratope for recognizing a unique antigen via its epitope; more specifically, a paratope consists of a set of complementarity-determining regions that have the highest conformational flexibility among sites on an antibody1. The high selectivity of antibody\u2013antigen recognition mechanism and the flexibility of antibodies as large proteins make antibodies a suitable platform for designing counteractants of target molecules. Antibodies have been widely used as therapeutic agents to treat human diseases. Antibody therapy has several advantages over traditional therapy, including longer serum half-life, higher avidity and selectivity, and the ability to invoke desired immune responses2\u20134. Antibody therapy also brings hope of curing several previously incurable diseases and there are ongoing efforts in the direction of HIV vaccine development5 and cancer therapeutic antibodies6,7.",

Force-fields for proteins can also be used to compute the binding free energy, representing van der Waals interactions, hydrophobic packing, electrostatics and solvation effects. These approaches include FoldX (FOLDEF)19, Discovery Studio (CHARMMPLR)20 and Rosetta14.

Instead of having bounding cubes of different sizes around the binding and mutation sites, topological barcodes for different samples are in the same range of filtration values, which improves the scalability in comparison with the direct use of the original 3D data.

This dataset contains 7,085 entries, including single- and multi-point mutations. By selecting only single-point mutations and excluding mutation entries without energy-change values, 4,947 data points were chosen from SKEMPI 2.0 (denoted set S4947). David et al. recently applied their updated mCSM-PPI2 method48 to the SKEMPI2 dataset. They filtered only single-point mutations and selected 4,169 variants in 319 different complexes (denoted set S4169). Set S8338 was derived from set S4169 by setting the reverse mutation energy changes to the negative values of its original energy changes. We applied our TopNetTree model to sets S4947, S4169 and S8338. We tested set S4947 with the regular tenfold cross-validation, achieving an average RP of 0.82 and an r.m.s.e. of 1.11 kcal mol\u20131 for the tenfold cross-validation. We followed the method of tenfold stratified cross-validation used in mCSM-PPI2 paper for sets S4169 and S833848.
