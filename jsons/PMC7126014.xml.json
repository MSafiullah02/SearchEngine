Compounds with promising activity can be used directly as drugs or as leads for the synthesis of new drugs. During the last few years, efforts have been made to increase the number of compounds with antiviral activity. Clinical use of the currently available antiviral drugs has use restrictions as narrow spectrum of activity, limited therapeutic usefulness and variable degrees of toxicity [10]. Furthermore, the therapeutic potency of most of the antiviral agents encountered so far is counterbalanced by their severe side effects in humans and, in some cases; the efficacy of these drugs is limited by increase of viral resistance [11]. Therefore, the search for antiviral compounds with high efficacy, low toxicity and minor side effects must continue to improve drug therapy.",

Rotaviruses affect nearly the population regardless of level of hygiene, quality of water, food and sanitation. Generally, the estimated incidences of rotaviruses in developed and developing countries are similar. The infections may be asymptomatic or may present mild vomiting and/or diarrhea, but can also cause severe disease leading to potentially fatal dehydration. Currently, the goals of treatment of rotaviruses gastroenteritis are to prevent and treat dehydration, and prevent nutritional damage during and after diarrhea episodes [21]. Recently, two rotavirus vaccines have entered in the market: RotaRix (GlaxoSmithKline) and RotaTeq (Merck/CSL) and several issues could be resolved with these new vaccines [22].",

According to the Coulson and Liakatos et al. [24], [25] the rotavirus entry into host cell is a multi-step process, requiring at least three virus host-cell interactions. The rotavirus initially binds to host cell-surface glycoconjugates, followed by interactions independent of sialic acid, believed to be part of the lipid domains in which integrins are thought to play an important role. The understanding of these interaction mechanisms between virus and cell is relevant, since it can contribute to a rational selection of compounds to be tested in antiviral assays.",

These effects in vitro from the structural aspects represent only preliminary results since the antiviral or cytotoxic activity of flavonoids is related to multiple factors. Concomitantly, metabolism studies should be carried out due to the fact that several flavonoids can degrade to variable extents in the digestive tract. A screening of bioactive compounds, synthetic or isolated from natural sources, and the evaluation of their SAR, allied to technological advances, are required to develop more effective and safer new drugs than those already available.",
