Activated lymphocytes and monocytes can then extravasate across the BBB without regard to their antigenic specificity. The entry of T cells in particular is dependent on the expression of LFA-1. Lymphocytes that identify their antigen are selectively retained within the CNS while the remaining cells depart. Although multiple cell types within the CNS can probably present antigen to activated T cells, it is controversial whether any serve as primary activators of naive T cells.",

The pattern of cytokines produced depends on the type of infection and on the genetic background of the host. Nevertheless, data from several systems suggest that skewing of T cell responses towards the production of type 2 cytokines is more likely in the CNS than in other organs. Both the lack of proliferation and the preferential release of interleukin 4 (IL-4) and IL-10 may be due to the effects that brain-derived gangliosides exert on T cells.",

As intracellular pathogens, their tropism for different neural cells and effect on host cell function determine the severity of disease. The paucity of MHC antigen expression within the CNS can make the cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL)-mediated clearance of viruses difficult and may predispose to chronic or relapsing infections. Their capacity to establish latency also allows viruses to avoid detection by the immune system. In other circumstances, antiviral antibodies can shut off virus production by infected neurons in a noncytolytic manner and promote recovery from disease. During chronic CNS infection caused by human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), the long-term production of inflammatory mediators such as tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 (TNF\u03b1) may promote the development of neurological symptoms.",

Organisms that cause acute meningitis are usually encapsulated; this inhibits phagocytosis and activation of complement through the classical pathway. As a result, these bacteria survive in the bloodstream longer and are more likely to invade the CNS. Once in the subarachnoid space, favorable conditions (i.e. limited intrinsic host defense, abundant nutrients) allow for rapid bacterial multiplication. Cytokines, particularly IL-1 and TNF\u03b1, are secreted in response to bacterial products and induce endothelial expression of adhesion molecules important for neutrophil egress. The production of other chemotactic stimuli including IL-8 also recruits neutrophils, but low levels of opsonins, antibody and complement in the CSF limit bacterial phagocytosis by these infiltrating cells. These responses combine to produce BBB dysfunction, leakage of protein and cerebral edema. Slow-growing bacteria adapted to survive inside macrophages, such as mycobacteria, induce mononuclear inflammatory responses and cause subacute or chronic disease.",

The greater frequency of these disorders in patients with impaired cell-mediated rather than humoral immunity implies that the former is the primary means of host defense against fungal pathogens that invade the CNS. In the setting of deficient cellular immunity, fungi can grow unchecked in the CSF without eliciting an inflammatory response.

The cysticerca of Tania solium induces an intense inflammatory reaction which may induce seizures. The organisms are eventually killed, leaving behind calcified nodules.
