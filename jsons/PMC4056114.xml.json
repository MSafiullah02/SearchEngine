Activation of NF-\u03baB occurs in response to diverse stimuli, such as endotoxin, which bind to cell-surface receptors that in turn activate the canonic and/or noncanonic signaling pathway. This signaling cascade ultimately results in the phosphorylation and inactivation of the cytosolic inhibitor I\u03baB complex, which then dissociates, allowing NF-\u03baB to translocate to the nucleus to initiate gene transcription [5]. Inhibition of NF-\u03baB reduces injury in preclinical models of ALI, including ischemia-reperfusion [6], endotoxemia [7], and cecal ligation and puncture-induced sepsis [8]. However, NF-\u03baB also exerts important cytoprotective effects, promoting cell survival, resolution of inflammation, and wound repair [9]. Of interest, NF-\u03baB signaling plays a central role in the host response to lung bacterial infection [10]. Consequently, inhibition of NF-\u03baB may constitute a double-edged sword, particularly in pneumonia-induced ALI/ARDS, in which immune competence is essential to eradication of the infectious agent [11].",

We used a gene-based therapy approach, via intrapulmonary delivery of three different doses of adenoassociated viral vector encoding the NF-\u03baB inhibitor I\u03baB\u03b1 gene (AAV-I\u03baB\u03b1), to modulate the NF-\u03baB signaling pathway in the lung. We hypothesized that pulmonary overexpression of the NF-\u03baB inhibitor I\u03baB\u03b1 would (a) attenuate the severity of the lung injury induced by acute E. coli pneumonia; but would (b) worsen the severity of prolonged E. coli pneumonia-induced lung injury; and (c) a dose-response relation would exist, with higher AAV-I\u03baB\u03b1 doses having the greatest effect.",

NF-\u03baB is a dimer of a number of related proteins, including RelA (also known as P65), p50, p52, RelB, and cRel, with the RelA and p50 heterodimer, the most common form. On cell activation, by stimuli such as gram-negative bacterial endotoxin, diverse signaling pathways are activated, which converge to phosphorylate and activate the I\u03baB kinase complex proteins (IKK), which then phosphorylate and inactivate the I\u03baB proteins, which dissociates from NF-\u03baB. The active NF-\u03baB translocates to the nucleus and binds to specific cognate-binding sequences in the promoter or enhancer regions of different target genes to initiate transcription [5].",

Selective inhibition of vascular endothelial NF-\u03baB activity in endotoxemic transgenic mice reduced lung inflammation and increased survival [32]. Of interest, this approach improved survival and systemic organ function, but did not alter bacterial clearance, in septic mice [32]. However, others have found inhibition of NF-\u03baB signaling to exert detrimental effects in the setting of infection. Inhibition of hepatocyte NF-\u03baB activity reduced Listeria monocytogenes clearance, decreasing murine survival [11]. In contrast, clearance of pseudomonas bacteria from the mouse lung was enhanced by pulmonary overexpression of the RelA subunit of NF-\u03baB [33], suggesting that the NF-\u03baB pathway plays a pivotal role in maintaining immune competence and is essential to eradication of the infectious agent [11].",

            "text": "The contrasting effects of NF-\u03baB inhibition in acute versus prolonged pneumonia generate a number of important insights. First, the finding that NF-\u03baB inhibition reduced the severity of acute pneumonia and decreased the host response induced ALI suggests that any benefit in this setting is mediated via a decreased host response to the instillation of E. coli [37]. This is consistent with the concept that in the early phases of pneumonia, secreted toxins, and the host immune response may be the predominant source of injury [37,38]. This is supported by the fact that NF-\u03baB inhibition is protective in nonseptic inflammatory ALI models. Second, this effect was dose dependent, with lower and intermediate I\u03baB\u03b1 doses protective and the beneficial effects ablated at higher doses. This suggests a U-shaped dose-effect curve, reducing the therapeutic utility of approaches to inhibit NF-\u03baB in the setting of acute pneumonia. Third, I\u03baB\u03b1 worsened the severity of prolonged pneumonia, substantially increasing lung bacterial loads, and resulting in a persisting pulmonary inflammatory response. I\u03baB\u03b1, by inhibiting the early host response to E. coli instillation, may have led to a persistence of infection, ultimately worsening lung injury. Finally, the beneficial effects of NF-\u03baB inhibition in acute pneumonia were lost at the highest dose. The reasons for this is unclear, but may include NF-\u03baB inhibition mediated reduction in lung epithelial repair [20], apoptosis of airway epithelial cells [16] and effects on lung macrophage function [39].",
