China\u2019s perceived success in controlling SARS stands in stark contrast with Taiwan\u2019s troubled response to its own SARS outbreak. Why does Taiwan, a geographically small, densely populated country with a democratic government, wealthy and modern knowledge-based economy, fail to effectively respond to SARS whereas big, heavily populated, relatively under-developed and authoritarian China succeeds? Does regime type explain China\u2019s relative success, and to the extent that regime type matters, what can be done to compensate for China\u2019s \u2018authoritarian advantage\u2019 in crisis response?",

Such crises include massive events such as hurricane Katrina, the 2011 Japan earthquake and tsunami or the 9/11 attacks on the United States that explode on the scene, or more insidious crises such as the spread of a previously unknown infectious disease that only slowly makes itself evident. Of the two types of novel crises the insidious type is often far more dangerous. The danger lies in the likelihood that the leadership will fail to recognize the insidious crisis as a crisis because it develops only slowly and seems amenable to existing response strategies. As a result, the leadership may become aware of the crisis only after it has become widespread or more threatening [2]. SARS is an example of insidious crises. It at first went unrecognized and only slowly did the leadership come to realize the immensity of the threat it represented.",

These are centralized decision making powers, public support for government initiatives, and government ability to shape the tone of the crisis in the mass media. Utilizing its authoritarian advantage, China\u2019s regime was able to effectively centralize decision making powers, rally public support and control the message presented by the mass media with the end result an effective pandemic response.

After initial hesitation, the Chinese leadership concluded that the SARS outbreak represented a significant threat to China. The leadership therefore recentralised power, establishing clear lines of control from the central level to the township level. While local governments occasionally disregarded central government decisions, by and large, the centre was able to control policy implementation. Thus, local health officials were required to provide daily reports up a clear chain of command to the centre. These reports were made available online. When the newly established (2001) Chinese CDC proved insufficiently effective in responding to SARS, the central government transferred responsibility for SARS to the MoH. In an unusual step for the PRC, the minister of health was replaced with a vice-premier (Wu Yi).

As the incidences of SARS rapidly increased, Taiwan\u2019s SARS Prevention and Relief Committee could no longer review all potential SARS cases in a timely fashion with official SARS classifications taking over twelve days (during which patients were often placed in general hospital rooms). Recognizing that this was too slow, the TCDC began cooperating with the Bureau of National Health Insurance regional offices in north, south and central Taiwan. These regional offices took over case review responsibilities and established a far more efficient set of local SARS expert committees. However, these multiple SARS committees lacked clear bureaucratic lines of control. As a result, communication between central and local SARS epidemic control centres was poor, with the failure to establish a central coordination and control mechanism contributing to the confusion. Essentially working independently, local governments improvised responses to the increasing number of SARS patients.",

This spokesperson would avoid speculative statements, relying instead on the best evidence-based information available, and would emphasize that responding to disasters is an ongoing process requiring flexibility. The spokesperson would also have to make clear that contradictions or changes in recommendations are part of the process of an ongoing pandemic response and do not indicate unreliable information. At the same time, the outlet would make this spokesperson available for interviews and discussion in the standard media. These might be accompanied by the requirement that any editing of actual recommendations or pandemic specific information be cleared with the outlet to insure that information was not taken out of context.",

Rather the priority must be to ensure that the state, when faced with a potential crisis situation, has developed options that compensate for the authoritarian advantage.",
