Through this mechanism, estrogen could increase vulnerability to more than one RNA virus associated with increased risk of schizophrenia including borna disease virus, 6 mumps, 7 influenza, 8 and coronaviruses. 9",

            "text": "Estrogen's blockage of the stimulation of T-cells by dendritic cells 5 may explain the negative association between rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and schizophrenia. 10 To explain this well-established negative association, Torrey and Yolken 11 proposed an association of infectious etiologies of schizophrenia and RA, including Toxoplasma gondii, herpes viruses, and retroviruses, whereby ''once a person gets one of the diseases then they are relatively immune to the other.'' In contrast, the author's estrogen theory is that increased estrogen of pregnancy enhances infection with T gondii and viruses. The low incidence of RA in schizophrenia, the author holds, is not directly associated with infectious diseases but instead results from increased smoking by individuals with schizophrenia that suppresses inflammatory cytokines and the similar effects of atypical and conventional antipsychotics. [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] RA also usually remits during pregnancy, which in the past has been attributed to rising levels of estrogen, 18 but may also result from rising levels of cortisol, norepinephrine, and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin that suppress inflammatory cytokines. 19 The relationship of some autoimmune disorders like RA to schizophrenia in the context of increased estrogen is best illustrated by Sjogren's syndrome in parents of schizophrenia patients. Sjogren's syndrome is associated with increased aromatase activity, which is correlated with higher disease activity and elevated serum estrogen levels. 14 Inflammatory cytokines stimulate aromatase that converts androgen precursors to 17-beta estradiol so that Sjogren's is associated with elevated serum estrogen levels. 14 In a study that examined the prevalence of autoimmune disorders in the parents of schizophrenia patients, the incidence of Sjogren's in parents of schizophrenia patients was nearly 4 times normal and was most strongly associated with schizophrenia of 19 autoimmune diseases studied. 20 Correlation of a medical condition known for high serum estrogen in the parents of persons with schizophrenia is consistent with the theme of this review that inappropriate prenatal estrogen exposure causes schizophrenia.",

Supporting this view are animal research models of schizophrenia that combine stress and genetic susceptibility. 33 Furthermore, stress responses are modulated in the limbic portion of the brain by estrogen's effect on the estrogen receptors (ERs) ER-alpha and ER-beta. 34 Plasma estrogen levels in male rats are also under genetic control, as shown by Lewis rats in which stress increases plasma estrogen and in Fischer rats in which stress decreases plasma estrogen. 35 ",

The discussion above described how increased estrogen could not only explain increased viral infection in schizophrenia but also the association of schizophrenia with autoimmune diseases, stress, and urban factors. Based on this and on previous work, 1 the author proposes that inappropriate prenatal estrogen exposure is the unifying pathological characteristic of schizophrenia whether from excessive dose, timing and/or duration of estrogen exposure, and/or modification of estrogen receptor function. As described above, the distribution of ER-alpha and ER-beta was recently described in human cortex and hippocampus from gestation to adulthood. 36 A test of the current theory could begin with a comparison of ERalpha and ER-beta distribution in brains with schizophrenia compared with normal.",
