In 1980, before widespread vaccination, measles caused an estimated 2.6 million deaths each year worldwide.3 In 2000, measles was declared eliminated from the United States (ie, continuous disease transmission was absent for more than 12 months).4 Today, most of the measles cases in the US are brought here by international travelers because measles continues to be a common disease in many parts of the world. Unvaccinated travelers transmit the disease when they are exposed to others who are not vaccinated. In 2014, the US experienced a record number of measles cases (603 cases as of October 31, 2014).4 According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), this is the highest number of cases in the US since measles was declared eliminated.",

A well-coordinated, well-prepared, and well-equipped public health system is essential, necessitating partnerships and collaboration among public health agencies, hospitals, clinicians, and laboratorians. Timely recognition of emerging infections will require early warning systems for rapid problem detection and prompt investigation and control to avert a public health crisis. A worldwide approach is crucial with a focus on strengthened response capacity and expanded international collaboration and communication. Nations must commit to the provision of adequate resources to address underlying socioeconomic factors. None of this will be possible without education. As we learn what poses a threat, we can alter our behavior to reduce the risk. Although multiple high-tech solutions are available to reduce the spread of infectious diseases, it is most important to remember hygiene basics and that we each play a significant role in reducing infections.",
