In this study 14 patients that had relapsed or were refractory to salvage SRS, experienced local control of 95%, 91%, and 75% at 3, 6, and 12 months post-SRS [9] . Collectively, this data supports the use of GKRS as a viable treatment for adults diagnosed with PCNSL. However, several questions remain to be answered including what outcomes can be achieved through the use of GKRS in patients that have developed PCNSL due to HIV [1, 7] . Immunocompromised patients have consistently been shown to have the highest mortality rates when provided with all existing treatments and significantly higher adverse events with the use of whole-brain radiation and/or methotrexate [5, 6] . Neurosurgeons and oncologists have a responsibility to utilize existing evidence-based information to improve the treatment outcomes and quality of life of these patients. In the Infectious disease outbreaks such as COVID-19, providing counseling and information for potentially utilizing GKRS as a first-line treatment option in PCNSL is clearly warranted in light of this evidence, and minimize the compromise of social distancing during cancer care delivery.",

In reports by Alvarez-Pinzon et al and Kenai et al., no CNS lymphoma patients treated with GKRS at various stages were noted to have a local recurrence at last follow-up, despite several instances of distal failure. Remarkably, response rates to GKRS were greater, with more than 80% of lesions diminishing or disappearing on MRI follow-up, resulting in better cognition and overall clinical performance status.",
