Consequently, they can directly antagonize pathogens and thus exert beneficial effects without directly affecting the metabolism of the host. An overview of the probiotics with such traits, tested up to date in clinical trials for the prevention or treatment of URTIs and otitis, is presented in this review. Their mechanical properties in the respiratory tract as well as at other locations are also cited. Species with interesting in vitro properties towards pharyngeal cells or against common respiratory pathogens have also been included.

Probiotic treatment aims to direct the composition of the microbiota from potentially harming to a microbiota that would be beneficial to the host. Probiotics can be used as means of prevention by reducing the risk for overgrowth of potential pathogenic bacteria, thus suppressing colonization by the latter (Ouwehand et al. 2002) . They also aim to restore lost bacteria or metabolic activities in colonized organs or to stimulate the immune response (Kalliomaki and Isolauri 2003) . Probiotics have been shown to be beneficial at different sites of the human bodyoral cavity, respiratory tract, gastrointestinal tract and urogenital tract. They have well established positive effects in the treatment of diarrhoea, including antibiotic associated and traveller's diarrhoea, vaginitis and functional gastrointestinal disorders [for review see (Allen et al. 2010; MacPhee et al. 2010; Girardin and Seidman 2011) ]. Nowadays, various probiotic strains are commercialized with the aim to prevent or to treat these types of diseases.

Furthermore, adherent probiotics occlude the access of recently arrived pathogens to the epithelium and thus exert competitive exclusion (O'Toole and Cooney 2008) . Size can also be an important factor. Large-sized probiotic bacteria could exert better competitive exclusion of pathogens than small-sized ones by masking specific receptor sites for pathogenic micro-organisms on the cell surface by steric hindrance (Merk et al. 2005) . Competition for nutrients results from the depletion by probiotics of nutrients from the environment that would otherwise be available for the pathogens. Additionally, they may bind and render unavailable to pathogens limited substances, such as iron (Oelschlaeger 2010) .

In the trial conducted by Rautava and collaborators, the association of the two probiotics also reduced the risk of early acute otitis media, as well as the use of antibiotics. This effect may have been mediated via both reduction of colonization by pathogens by local inhibition and immunomodulation throughout the common mucosa-associated immune system (Rautava et al. 2009 ). However, Taipale and co-authors reported no difference in the incidence of otitis media or in the use of antibiotics (Taipale et al. 2011) . A significant difference in the rate and duration of respiratory illnesses between the probiotic and the placebo group upon administration of Bif. animalis subsp. lactis Bb-12 was also absent in the trial conducted by Weizman and colleagues (Weizman et al. 2005) . Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis Bi-07 was administered alone or in combination with Lact. acidophilus NCFM in another clinical trial.

A higher affinity for binding sites would allow them to exclude attached pathogens that could subsequently be eliminated through co-aggregation. On the other hand, strong adherence to host cells would allow the probiotic to occupy any free space on the epithelial surface. Thus, they could slow down the multiplication of the pathogens by competing with them for space and nutrients. In the case of URTIs, most clinical trials are destined to prevent disease in the healthy population or to prevent recurrence in disease-prone patients.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "This review aimed to underline the importance of the mechanical properties of probiotics in their action against pathogens with a special interest on the probiotics that have shown to be effective in the prevention of URTIs and otitis. The properties of a probiotic being strain specific, what we know up to date is only a small part of the potential offered by these 'friendly bacteria'. This review might help the choice of probiotic species for the development of novel probiotic applications. Of the 16 here-cited species, almost half are lactic bacteria belonging to the Lact. genus (Lact. rhamnosus, Lact. acidophilus, Lact. delbrueckii, Lact. paracasei, Lact. plantarum, Lact. casei and Lact. helveticus) and the Bifidobacterium genus (Bif. animalis, B. longum and B. bifidum). Some species, as Lact. rhamnosus and Lact. acidophilus, have been extensively studied compared to others that have been tested in few clinical trials. These extensively studied species have well-documented mechanical properties and seem to offer a bigger chance of success in the search of new strains. The mechanical properties of the less studied probiotics are less well known, but their potential should not be underestimated. Finally, it could also be interesting to investigate the less frequently used in URTI studies Streptococcus genus (Strep. salivarius, Strep. mitis, Strep. oralis and Strep. sanguinis).", "cite_spans":
