Patients with symptoms of URTI underwent nasopharyngeal aspiration, whereas patients with LRTI (i.e., pneumonia) underwent bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), when clinically possible. Patients with pneumonia but no signs of URTI did not undergo nasopharyngeal aspiration. Patients (both outpatients and inpatients) whose nasopharyngeal aspirate (NPAs) specimens tested positive for respiratory viruses were asked to return to the clinic (or undergo an inpatient sampling) at least weekly for further clinical assessment and microbiological analysis until all symptoms resolved and the virus was not detected in a NPA.",

We used labeled antibodies to influenza A and B viruses; parainfluenza viruses 1, 2, and 3; RSV; and adenoviruses. If the samples did not contain respiratory epithelial cells, the finding was considered to be inconclusive. For viral culture, specimens were inoculated into each of 4 cell lines: human fibroblasts (MRC5), human epithelial cells (Hep-2 and A-549), and Madin-Darby canine kidney cells. Cultures were incubated for 2 weeks (4 weeks for detection of cytomegalovirus) on a roller drum at 35\u040aC. Viruses were identified on the basis of cytopathic effect in cell cultures and confirmed by staining with fluoresceinconjugated monoclonal antibodies [10] . BAL samples were also processed for routine aerobic, anaerobic, mycobacterial, and fungal culture and for parasite examination.",

A first episode of infection was defined as the period during which the patient had symptoms of URTI and/ or LRTI, regardless of whether a respiratory virus was isolated. A further episode(s) of infection required the presence of a symptom-free period and negative results of testing of the NPA for any respiratory viruses isolated during the previous episode. A polymicrobial infection was defined as the isolation of 11 respiratory virus during the same episode or another clinically relevant pathogen from a BAL fluid specimen or a lung sample. A diagnosis of nosocomial respiratory virus infection was considered if a patient had been in the hospital for \u04433 days and if symptoms of the infection developed during hospitalization. A URTI was defined by the new onset of nasal, pharyngeal, or laryngeal irritation, and an LRTI (or pneumonia) was defined by the development of a new pulmonary infiltrate in patients with signs and symptoms of LRTI (cough, rales, wheezing). Death due to pneumonia was defined as death due to respiratory failure during the episode of respiratory virus infection. Progression of a URTI to an LRTI was defined as onset of pneumonia in patients with a prior or concurrent URTI, whereas patients who had pneumonia without a URTI were considered to have an isolated LRTI.",

These respiratory viruses are the most commonly found viruses in studies that involve HSCT recipients [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] , although their relative proportions vary between studies, probably because of the epidemic situation in the population during the study period. A large epidemic of influenza A virus infection occurred during our study period, and the isolates recovered from patients closely reflected the respiratory viruses isolated in the community, as shown in figure 1. The 7 enteroviruses found in our study confirm that these viruses also cause LRTI and URTI in these immunocompromised hosts [7, 11, 12] . However, we found no cases of infection with rhinoviruses or coronaviruses. The viral culture technique used in the study can detect infections with rhinoviruses but not coronavirus infections [6, 7, 10] .
