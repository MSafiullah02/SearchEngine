Their disadvantages include high toxicity (vomiting, arthralgia, hepatitis, pancreatitis and cardiac dysrhythmias), high cost [11], resistance issues in India [13,14] and in HIV patients [4, 15, 16] and intravenous administration during hospitalization. The intravenous alternative drug, Amphotericin B, alone or in liposomal formulations [13,14,17], causes fever, nephrotoxicity and hypokalemia [18]. It also requires hospitalization but is not related to major resistance problems. Paromomicin, of comparable efficacy to Amphotericin, induces nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity. Pentamidine therapy in India was halted because of its decreased cure rate and adverse side effects [17, 19]. Recently, oral therapy with Miltefosine showed 94% of success rates in India [20] but only 50% of cure rates in Brazil [21]. The same compounds are used for the therapy of canine leishmaniasis in Europe, with controversial success [22]. The use of combined therapies reduces time and cost of treatment and avoids the selection of resistant parasites [14, 23]. Protozoan parasites lack de novo purine synthetic pathways and have developed robust salvage pathways, where no single enzyme is predicted to be essential [24]. The inhibitory potential of iminoribitols substituted with aromatic groups against nucleoside hydrolases (NH) of protozoan parasites was established in the 90s and led us to test them here [25\u201327]. The nucleoside hydrolase NH36 of L. (L.) donovani is also the main antigen of the Leishmune vaccine used for prevention and therapy of canine visceral leishmaniasis [5, 7, 8].",

(L.) donovani recombinant NH36 enzymatic activity [29]. IA and IH inhibited the NH36 enzymatic activity with Ki = 0.080 \u03bcM for IA and 0.019 \u03bcM for IH. Inhibition of the growth of L. (L.) infantum chagasi and L. (L.) amazonensis promastigotes in vitro was obtained using nanomolar to micromolar concentrations of IA, IH, DIH, DIG, SMIH and SMIG. As transition state analogues of N-ribosyl transferases they are stable chemical mimics of the enzymatic transition state and bind tighter than the respective substrate molecules. Of these, IA, IH and SMIH at 10 \u03bcM concentration inhibited 95% of the intracellular replication of L. (L.) infantum chagasi amastigotes in vitro causing no apparent damage to macrophage viability. IA and IH were less toxic and more potent than Glucantime [29].",

Using the mean average of IgG absorbances + 2 SD of serum of normal uninfected mice we obtained the cut-off values: 0.168 for day 1, 0.147 for day 15 and 0.184 for day 30 after infection, respectively. All these cut-off values obtained the Youden index = 1 a value which indicates the absence of false positive and false negative results. The set of antibody means of normal uninfected and of infected mice differ by 15 (day 1), 10 (day15) and 5 (day 30) standard deviations, respectively, indicating the accuracy of the test. The anti-NH36 IgG1 antibody absorbencies were enhanced only in the infected untreated controls (P < 0.0001) where the increases were 69% and 64% higher than in IA treated mice (days 1 and 15, respectively). There was a slight decrease to 57% at day 30 following chemotherapy (Fig 4B). IgG1 antibody responses suggested that the efficacy of immucillins in control of infection is compatible with that of Glucantime. However, the results of the IgG2a subtype indicated that a stronger antibody response is induced by immucillins (Fig 4C). Immucillins and Glucantime generated high anti-NH36 IgG2a responses (Fig 4C) if compared to untreated infected controls, which remained at basal levels (P <0.001). IgG2a increases in the IA, IH and SMIH groups (79\u201377%) started from 1 day following chemotherapy, with no decline until day 30, suggesting a rapid onset of infection control. Glucantime treatment, resulted in a slower IgG2a response (67% at day 1) (P < 0.001), and reached maximal values only at day 30. IA and IH were more potent than Glucantime and IH induced an IgG2a stronger response than SMIH (day 1 and 15) (Fig 4C).",

To explore this hypothesis we treated normal uninfected mice with each immucillin or with Glucantime, and incubated their splenocytes in vitro in the presence of lysate of L. (L.) infantum or NH36 (Fig 6). The secretion of IFN-\u03b3 in response to lysate or NH36 was enhanced only on day 15, in mice treated with all drugs. Immucillins promoted a higher IFN-\u03b3 than Glucantime (Fig 6). The response of uninfected animals (Fig 6) however, was 35% lower than in uninfected animals (Figs 5 and 6) and transient. Different from infected animals (Fig 5), a slight enhancement of TNF-\u03b1 secretion was observed in uninfected mice, only on day 1, which did not last (Fig 6). This was induced in response to the lysate by all drug treatments, and to NH36, only in SMIH treated mice (Fig 6). As expected, the IL-10 secretion of normal mice was reduced by 47% and 73%, in response to lysate and NH36, respectively, when compared to those of infected saline-treated controls (Fig 5). The IL-10 response was mainly increased in SMIH treated mice, to lysate, and in Glucantime treated animals, in response to NH36 (Fig 6). We conclude that the overall cytokine response of immucillin and Glucantime treated uninfected animals suggests that immucillins might also have a moderate but direct effect on T cells which contributes to the cure of VL.",

Noteworthy, IL-10 levels in Glucantime treated mice (509 pg/ml) were higher than in IA treated mice (113 pg/ml; p<0.05). Levels of IFN-\u03b3 were 3 times higher (~1500 pg/ml) than those of TNF-\u03b1 (~500 pg/ml) (Fig 6).

The direct action of IA, IH and SMIH on mice lymphocyte responses partially contribute to the success of chemotherapy of VL. IA induces a TH1 response, followed by IH. Although all immucillins were strongly therapeutic in mice, a superiority of IA was observed in most of the variables. This probably explains why IA is the most effective against VL in hamsters where SMIH show no therapeutic effect.",

IA showed the highest curative effect in mice and also promoted cure of VL in hamsters. The enhancement of anti-NH36 IgG antibodies in all infected groups, confirmed that NH36 is an important marker of VL infection, not only in dogs [44] but also, in BALB/c mice. Of note, the anti-NH36 IgG1 antibodies increased only in the infected untreated controls and were reduced by day 30, when the spontaneous control of infection occurs [45]. In agreement with our results with immucillins, much higher levels of IgG1 were found in infected, than in cisplatin treated BALB/c mice [30, 31] or uninfected controls [30] soon after complete chemotherapy. The lower levels of IgG1 and higher titers of IgG2a anti-NH36 antibodies, which correlate to the decreased parasite burden, suggested a pronounced switch to the TH1 response, promoted by the treatments with IA, IH followed by SMIH or Glucantime. Glucantime induction of the IgG2a humoral response was however slower than that of immucillins. Of note, the enhancement of the IgG2a response by immucillins was 80%, by Miltefosin, 75% [46] and by cisplatin, only 50\u201355% [30, 31].",

            "text": "Supporting the hypothesis of the switch to a TH1 response, the treatment with IA, IH and SMIH immucillins causes IFN-\u03b3 to be the predominant secreted cytokine, an effect also observed after treatment with cisplatin [30, 31], and low but detectable levels of TNF-\u03b1, which are correlated with resistance to infection and parasite death [47]. Treatment with immucillins or 1,3,4-tiadiazolium-2 aminide compounds [48] induced also higher IFN-\u03b3 responses than Glucantime. IL-10 is the hallmark of pathology in VL, and was 72% reduced, 1 day after complete treatment with immucillins, and was 50% and 75% reduced at the same time following treatment with cisplatin [30, 31] or 1,3,4-tiadiazolium-2 aminide [48], respectively. As previously described [47, 49\u201352] the TH2 response in VL is best represented by IL-10 but not by IL-4. Most reports in literature use promastigote lysate antigen for stimulation of cytokine expression. We showed that NH36 is equally potent reinforcing its relevance as a Leishmania infection marker [44, 53, 54]. In our investigation, the remarkable change observed in the immune response could be due to the decreasing in parasite load or to direct immunologic changes induced by immucillins. Such changes have been shown with antimony [55]. Although IFN-\u03b3 secretion was high after immucillin treatment in infected animals, 35% lower IFN-\u03b3 secretion was also observed in uninfected animals treated with immucillins, either in response to leishmanial antigens or to immucillins. A lower but significant secretion of TNF-\u03b1 and decreased response of IL-10 were also observed. These results suggest that immucillins are capable of inducing a TH1 response through their direct effect on T cells. This effect may contribute to the successful chemotherapy of VL.",

            "text": "Sodium antimony gluconate (SAG) has been shown to activate both the innate and adaptive immune system by indirectly activating pathways for ROS and NO generation [55], imparting in this way resistance to leishmania infection and reinfection. SAG induces proliferation of T cells but not of B cells and upregulates the IFN-\u03b3 receptors [55]. We showed that pre-treatment with IA, IH and SMIH induced significantly high secretion of IFN-\u03b3, followed by TNF-\u03b1 with a low secretion of IL-10. Enhancements in proportions of CD4+-T and CD19+ B cells at all times and a transient increase in CD8+ T cell frequencies were also promoted by previous treatment only with IA. The increase of CD4+ T cell frequencies by immucillins is noteworthy since resistance to Leishmania (L.) infantum infection has been shown to be related to the function and frequencies of CD4+ T cells [56\u201359]. A lower and transient lymphoproliferative effect was determined by Glucantime in our model. IH showed equal stimulation of CD4+ T, CD8+T and CD19+ B cell expansions in previously treated and untreated mice. Differently, SMIH decreased the CD4+ and CD8+ T cell frequencies but enhanced the proportions of CD19+ B cells. These preliminary results might explain the direct induction of a TH1 response and the strong Leishmania antibody response promoted by IA and IH, which contributed to their success in cure of mice VL. Despite the induction of an IFN-\u03b3, TNF-\u03b1, IL-10 and antibody response similar to IA and IH, SMIH did not stimulate T cell proliferation and apparently acts via its potent leishmanicidal toxicity [29]. SMIH impaired stimulation on CD4+ T cell proliferation might also explain its lack of efficacy in hamsters, a more susceptible host. We conclude that, as suggested for Glucantime and Pentamidine, the efficacy of IA and IH immucillins is also partially T-cell dependent [60].",

As described for cisplatin [32], animals treated with the other immucillins and Glucantime also exhibited favorable liver and spleen weight profiles. Most importantly, infected controls developed ~3000 LDU units in livers on day 21 after infection, similar to mice infected with L. (L.) infantum chagasi [33] or L. (L.) donovani [30\u201332, 46]. Treatment with IA, IH, SMIH or Glucantime caused a decrease in parasite burden starting from day 1 after complete chemotherapy and removing 85\u201389% of the amastigotes by day 30. IA showed the strongest efficacy (89%) while cisplatin caused reductions of 50% [32], 75% [30] or 80% [31] and Miltefosin [46], of 50%. The early control of infection, may reflect both the direct anti-Leishmania therapeutic efficacy of immucillins and their stimulatory effect on the TH1 response.

In contrast to what proposed previously [55], these [30\u201332] and our results suggest that the severe increase of liver enzymes after chemotherapy of VL with Glucantime, is due to the direct hepatotoxic effect of the drug, rather than to the killing of parasites, as serum GOT is released into blood when the liver or heart is damaged [68]. In agreement with that, Kato et al., [69] reported swollen and apoptotic hepatocytes in animals treated with Glucantime. Therefore, while all the current medications against VL are associated with hepatic toxicity [68, 70], we demonstrated that the treatment of mice with immucilins is not.",

Glucantime treatment has raised the levels of blood creatinine [66, 74, 75] and urea nitrogen [73]. Additionally, a defect in urine concentration has been attributed to the antagonist effect of antimonials on neurohypophysis hormone [66]. The hamster model is more susceptibility to L.
