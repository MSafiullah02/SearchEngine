            "text": "Respiratory viruses are among the most important causes of human morbidity and mortality worldwide (Nair et al., 2010, Pavia, 2011). Clinically indistinguishable, respiratory virus infections require accurate laboratory diagnosis to guide treatment effectively and prevention decisions. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and other molecular assays are now routinely used for diagnosis of respiratory virus infections (Beck and Henrickson, 2010, Kehl and Kumar, 2009), but the large and increasing number of viruses makes laboratory testing with individual (singleplex) virus assays challenging. Conversely, multiplex PCR assays that combine multiple individual assays in a single reaction facilitate more rapid, high throughput and cost-effective testing and are generally preferred in the clinical setting (Elnifro et al., 2000, Jansen et al., 2011).",

These included 26 laboratory reference virus strains and field isolates and 265 geographically (U.S., Central and South America and Africa) and compositionally diverse specimens [nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs (223), nasal washes and aspirates (21), sputum (1), lung autopsy tissue (1) and unidentified (19)] collected from children and adults with acute respiratory illnesses (ARIs) acquired between 2008 and 2011 and previously testing positive for respiratory viruses by the in-house singleplex assays. All residual samples and extracts were stored at \u221270 \u00b0C. Whenever possible, archived specimens were selected to achieve a proportional representation of viral loads. Forty-six mock human specimens spiked with moderate-to-low concentrations of virus were available from the 2010 Quality Control for Molecular Diagnostics (QCMD, Glasgow, Scotland) external quality assessment (EQA) programs for rhinovirus/coronavirus, adenovirus, parainfluenza viruses, human metapneumovirus/respiratory syncytial virus, and influenza A & B viruses (Wallace, 2003). Pooled nasal wash specimens from 20 consenting healthy new military recruits was kindly provided by Dr. Lisa Lott, Eagle Applied Sciences, L.L.C., San Antonio, TX. Finally, a subset of 308 nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPAs) from an etiologic study of 1162 children < 2 years of age hospitalized with ARI at a tertiary hospital in S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil, between March 2008 and September 2010, were selected from the seasonal peaks of respiratory virus circulation for each of the study years based on local surveillance data. The NPAs were collected directly into liquid nitrogen, aliquoted and transferred to \u221270 \u00b0C and retained until retrieved for this study.

Individual assays within each pool are distinguished by use of different probe fluorophores, with the exception of the EV and PeV assays, where both probes are ROX-labeled and therefore cannot be distinguished. Each kit also contains a positive plasmid control pool and detailed instructions on test performance. The FTDRP assay was performed following the manufacturer's recommendations. Briefly, 194 \u03bcL of 2\u00d7 RT-PCR buffer was combined with 23.3 \u03bcL of each primer/probe pool and 15.5 \u03bcL of 25\u00d7 enzyme mix (AgPath-ID\u2122 One-Step RT-PCR Kit, Applied Biosystems), and 15 \u03bcL of each mixture was then added to 14 wells of a PCR plate (12 sample reactions plus one positive and one negative virus control). Ten \u03bcL of sample TNA extract or controls were then added to the respective wells of each primer/probe pool. The following cycling conditions were performed on a 7500 Fast Dx Real-Time PCR Instrument (Applied Biosystems): 15 min at 50 \u00b0C, 10 min at 95 \u00b0C and 40 cycles of 8 s at 95 \u00b0C and 34 s at 60 \u00b0C. Threshold cycle (Ct) values were determined by manually adjusting the fluorescence baseline to fall within the exponential phase of the amplification curves and above any background signal. A positive test result was considered a well-defined curve that crossed the threshold cycle within 40 cycles. Positive and negative virus plasmid controls provided in the kit were included in all runs to monitor assay performance. The BMV internal control was spiked into clinical specimens to monitor sample extraction and reverse transcription. Previously extracted TNA samples were evaluated for RNase P only.",

It is notable that these three FTDRP assays are combined in the same reaction mix and these three viruses showed the highest co-detection rates by singleplex in-house in these specimens. It is possible that competing amplification reactions in some specimens containing multiple virus targets may have reduced the sensitivity of some assays for low abundant targets.

Although this complicated efforts to evaluate the FTDRP EV/PeV and RV assays, several conclusions can be drawn from these findings. The FTDRP EV/PeV assay appeared to be more sensitive and specific than the in-house assay for detection of some EV strains, including the recently emergent EV68 (CDC, 2011), although cross-reactions with some RV strains identified in the archived sample collection could not be ruled out. Of particular concern, the FTDRP RV assay was insensitive with some sequence confirmed RV species B and C strains.
