The advent of the quinolones and respiratory tract macrolides has led to a tremendous reduction in the morbidity and mortality from the once-feared Legionnaire disease because of the high mortality seen in the original American Legion outbreak. As a result, the physician-clinician has the capability to initiate empiric therapy that covers the most likely pathogens of CAP with only one or two broad-spectrum antibiotics. The empiric broad-spectrum therapy eradicates the offending pathogen and assures a favorable outcome.",

Unfortunately, the test only can reliably detect one species, Legionella pneumophila, and only one serogroup. Nevertheless, it has significant advantages over direct fluorescent antibody testing for Legionella, antibody serology, and culture, including its relatively low cost and rapid performance. Most importantly, the results affect management at the point of care. As a result, the urinary antigen test now is the most common method used to make the diagnosis of Legionnaire disease. A dramatic increase in the proportion of cases of Legionnaire disease diagnosed as a result of the urine antigen test has occurred worldwide. In Europe, only 15% of cases were diagnosed with use of the urine antigen test in 1995 compared with > 90% in 2006.11 Among the 10,753 cases of Legionnaire disease reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention between 1980 and 1998, a significant increase was seen in the proportion of patients with a positive urine test; diagnosis as a result of urine antigen testing increased from 0% to 69% over this period, and the proportion likely is higher today.",

An advantage of the urinary antigen test is its simplicity of collection and the rapidity of the test results. These tests are much less influenced by prior antibiotic therapy than sputum culture. Because the specificity is high (99.1%, as shown in the metaanalysis), the message of relevance to the clinician is that when a test result is positive, initiating anti-Legionella antibiotic therapy is imperative. However, as the metaanalysis1 also has shown, the sensitivity is not as high (74%), even with the more sensitive commercially available tests. At least one-quarter of patients with confirmed legionellosis can have a negative test result. The sensitivity also is affected by the course of the infection. In milder cases, the disease may not be sufficiently advanced such that the amount of antigen in the urine is not detectable. Although the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported12 that the urine antigen test is more sensitive than a culture, we found15 that when performed properly with selective and dye-containing media, culture is useful as a \u201cgold standard.\u201d",

Surprisingly, L longbeachae is common in Australia and New Zealand for reasons that are uncertain. Consequently, the urinary antigen is less valuable in these countries. Other serogroups, especially in hospital-acquired infections, also can cause disease, particularly L pneumophila serogroup 6. The urinary antigen is insensitive for these other species and serogroups, so the diagnosis of legionellosis due to other serogroups of L pneumophila or other species depends on the recovery of the organism from the culture or from serologic antibody tests.",

The key is to resurrect the use of culture (or to develop rapid diagnostic tests that can identify all the Legionella species and serogroups) and to strengthen the role of the clinical microbiology laboratory. Although dramatic progress has been made in molecular biology, with increasing roles for nucleic acid amplification, sequencing, and typing methods, there remains a need for validation of these newer tests. The results of molecular diagnostic assays must be correlated with clinical findings and culture results.",

To do so, the full clinical microbiology armamentarium with the newer molecular tests must be exploited. The return of the sputum Gram stain, sputum culture, and blood cultures also would provide information that allows the use of penicillin for pneumococcal pneumonia.22 With the advent of sensitive rapid tests for viral pathogens (especially influenza), empiric antibacterial agent therapy, which is ineffective while promoting drug resistance, can be replaced by effective antiviral therapy. If there truly is to be a golden era of clinical microbiology and a reduction in antibiotic misuse and overuse, we will need to be smarter in the use of all of the weapons at our disposal, including traditional tests and the newer molecular-based tests.",
