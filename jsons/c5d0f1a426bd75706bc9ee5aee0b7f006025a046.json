The phylogeny is independently supported by a recently published multiple DNA marker-based molecular phylogeny. The more basal Scalpellinae appeared in the Aptian (Early Cretaceous, 120 Mya), and derived Amigdoscalpellinae were already present by the Campanian (Late Cretaceous, 78 Mya), represented by Catherinum anglicum sp. nov. and Amigdoscalpellum bellulum from the UK Chalk.

The out-group Cretiscalpellum possesses two pairs of plates in the position of the carinolatus: an upper pair, usually rhomboidal in outline (Fig. 4I) , and a lower pair (subcarinolatus of Withers, 1935: fig. 29 ), which are nearly equilaterally triangular (Fig. 4J) , and overlap the subcarina.

NHMUK IC 1198. Comparative morphology of carinolatus in out-group Cretiscalpellum and Scalpellinae to illustrate morphological variation and phylogenetic trends. Note the overall progression in morphology from the out-group (Q, R), through Arcuatoscalpellum arcuatum (P, Q), to Diotascalpellum (D. rubrum, K, L), involving differentiation of the inframedian latus surface. In the more derived R. regium (G, H), R. darwini (I, J), and R. gigas (M, N) the umbo is incurved, has migrated to a more dorsal position, and a low internal shelf has developed adjacent to the upper latus. In Arcoscalpellum (Arcoscalpellum michelottianum, D, E; Arcoscalpellum quadratum, F), the umbo is more incurved, the apex subapical, and a upper latus surface has developed (see Fig. 10 Group 2 In R. regium (Figs 6P, Q, 13G, H; see also Pilsbry, 1907, pl. 2, figs 3, 10) , R. darwini (Fig. 13I, J) , and the Late Cretaceous species Regioscalpellum maximum (J. de C. Sowerby) (Fig. 18N , O, P, S) a low, concave polymetric flange has grown inwards from the umbo of the carinolatus, and then is inflected sharply to extend for about two-thirds along the length of the upper latus margin (ulm, Fig. 10J , blue coloured); in life, this is covered with thick tissue. The ridge of this structure adjacent to the umbo contacts the base of the carina. Additionally, the umbo has become more incurved, and the dorsal margin more convex. There is no specialized contact between the paired carinolatera. Discrete lateral (green, adjacent to lm), peduncular (ps), and inframedian (ims) surfaces have developed (Fig. 10J) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 499, "end": 507, "text": "(Darwin)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 683, "end": 695, "text": "(Hoek, 1883)", "ref_id": "BIBREF38"}, {"start": 723, "end": 738, "text": "(Pilsbry, 1907)", "ref_id": "BIBREF56"}, {"start": 823, "end": 836, "text": "(Dixon, 1850)", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 900, "end": 922, "text": "Withers, 1953, pl. 26,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 980, "end": 995, "text": "(Thomson, 1873)", "ref_id": "BIBREF67"}, {"start": 1028, "end": 1040, "text": "(Hoek, 1883)", "ref_id": "BIBREF38"}, {"start": 1072, "end": 1084, "text": "(Hoek, 1883)", "ref_id": "BIBREF38"}, {"start": 1115, "end": 1127, "text": "(Hoek, 1883)", "ref_id": "BIBREF38"}, {"start": 1163, "end": 1178, "text": "(Darwin, 1851b)", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 1269, "end": 1284, "text": "(Darwin, 1851b)", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 2134, "end": 2167, "text": "Pilsbry, 1907, pl. 2, figs 3, 10)", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 49, "end": 57, "text": "Fig. 13O", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}, {"start": 412, "end": 421, "text": "(Fig. 13K", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}, {"start": 508, "end": 517, "text": "(Fig. 18A", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}, {"start": 923, "end": 930, "text": "fig. 13", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}, {"start": 2075, "end": 2082, "text": "Fig. 10", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}, {"start": 2181, "end": 2194, "text": "(Fig. 13I, J)", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}, {"start": 2272, "end": 2281, "text": "(Fig. 18N", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}, {"start": 2488, "end": 2496, "text": "Fig. 10J", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}, {"start": 2895, "end": 2905, "text": "(Fig. 10J)", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}], "section": "Group 1"}, {"text": "In Arcoscalpellum michelottianum (Figs 2C, 6K, L, 13D, E), Arcoscalpellum quadratum (Dixon, 1850) (Fig. 13F) , and Arcoscalpellum sociabile (Figs 2D, 6F, G) the internal flange has become an external upper latus surface (uls, blue coloured in Fig. 10L ), the upper margin of which contacts the upper latus.

Although the changes superficially appear to represent a continuous morphocline, the introduction of synapomorphies is actually concentrated at three nodes, which represent major evolutionary steps in plate morphology. The most basal of these, node 6, involves 27 character changes, and with 100% bootstrap support is positioned at the base of a derived group that includes Amigdaloscalpellum, Catherinum, and Weltnerium, included in Amigdoscalpellinae subfam. nov.

The more derived character state is a symmetrical contact, in which either a few ridges oppose precisely (e.g. Ca. recurvitergum; Fig. 7S ), or in which the articulation is divided into a more basal, flat, slightly protruding contact surface and and upper, depressed, and more horizontal contact, a lower extension of the carinal surface (e.g. Catherinum novaezelandiae; Fig. 7N ). 3. The nature of the contact between the scutum and upper latus. Plesiomorphically (e.g. Fig. 2 ), this is a simple, straight contact with no overlap, but in more derived taxa the slightly recurved apex of the upper latus rests in a groove on the scutum (e.g. Fig. 3A , B, E-G). A notch is present in the upper latus margin of the scutum at the same level ( Fig. 8C-D) . 4. A sharp, acuminate, incurved umbonal tip on the scutum, incorporating the primordial valve, is present in more derived forms ( Fig. 8C-D) . 5. The shape of the scutum changes during the evolutionary history of the scalpellids, from a subtriangular plesiomorphic form, in which the basaloccludent and basal-upper latus margins are at nearly right angles (Fig. 8A, E) , to become progressively more trapezoidal (Fig. 8C, D, G, H) . This is brought about by the increasingly acute basaloccludent angle and the increasingly obtuse basalupper latus angle (Fig. 1F ). 6. The shape of the rostrum, and the extent and geometry of its external and internal surfaces. In Amigdoscalpellum and Catherinum, the rostra are oval, elongate, and very small, less than half the height of the rostrolatera. In the derived Weltnerium, the rostrum has a trapezoidal external surface, and the rostrum has the same height as the rostrolatera. 7. The shape and proportional size of the internal depression, between the umbo and the scutal adductor, which serves to accommodate dwarf males. In basal amigdoscalpellines, this is a U-shaped notch, extending variably inwards from the occludent surface. 8. Surface sculpture. The basal amigdaloscalpelline Amigdoscalpellum possesses a ubiquitous radial sculpture of raised, rounded ridges on all plates except the carina (e.g. Am. truncatum and Am. rigidum). Species of Catherinum have variable sculpture, from entirely smooth to possessing variably developed radiating ridges, which increase during ontogeny (Young, 2007) .
