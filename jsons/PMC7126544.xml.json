Coronaviruses broadly infect vertebrates including humans, birds, bats, snakes, mice and other wild animals [1,2]. Since the mid-1960s, seven known human coronaviruses (HCoVs) have been identified [3,4]. Four commonly detected HCoVs are 229E, OC43, NL63 and HKU1. In one study, 229E and OC43 accounted for approximately 15\u201329% of respiratory pathogens with relatively low virulence in humans [3,5]. Another epidemiological study in adults estimates that coronavirus causes about 15% of common colds [6]. Other significant causes of upper respiratory infections include influenza virus, rhinovirus, parainfluenza virus, Group A Streptococci, EBV and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV).",

MERS-CoV was isolated from a male patient who died from acute pneumonia and renal failure in Saudi Arabia in 2012 [7], and was subsequently responsible for 2494 cases and 858 deaths from 27 different countries (case-fatality rate: 34.4%) [8]. Both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 were first recognized in China. SARS-CoV caused a total of 8422 probable SARS cases, 919 SARS-related deaths (case-fatality rate: 11%) and spread to 32 different countries or regions between November 2002 and August 2003 [9]. Since December 2019, the SARS-CoV-2 has infected 73,230 people and caused 1871 deaths (case-fatality rate: 2.6%) and has spread to 25 countries, according to the State Council Information Office in Beijing, China (updated as of Feb. 17, 2020) [10]. As of this date, the number of confirmed and suspected cases is still increasing, as is the number of deaths, although there is a significant increase in the number of recovered patients as well.",

There are accessory genes interspersed within the structural genes at the 3\u2032 end of genome [12], some of which have been shown to play an important roles in viral pathogenesis [13].

Droplet spread can occur when an infected person sneezes or coughs, whereupon virus containing droplets are propelled up to 3 feet through the air and are deposited on the mucous membranes of the mouth, nose, or eyes of persons who are nearby. A recent report suggests that transmission through the ocular surface is also possible [24]. The other avenues for the spread of the virus are shaking hands with an infected person, touching an infected object/surface, frequent touching of the nose or mouth or coming into contact with a patient's excreta. Another avenue is through \u201chidden transmission\u201d [19], in which asymptomatic infected individuals or carriers unknowingly transmit the virus to unsuspecting contacts.",

For SARS-CoV, the mutation rate in the SARS-CoV genome was estimated to be 0.80\u20132.38 \u00d7 10\u22123 nucleotide substitutions per site per year, and the nonsynonymous and synonymous substitution rates were estimated to be 1.16\u20133.30 \u00d7 10\u22123 and 1.67\u20134.67 \u00d7 10\u22123 per site per year, respectively, which are similar to that of other RNA viruses [28]. The various CoVs of animal origin undergo evolution and genetic recombination either within the host species or upon jumping from one species to another. Such changes thus have the potential to lead to variants that have high pathogenic potential when transmitted to humans [[29], [30], [31]]. Recently, two mutations of the S protein and N protein SARS-CoV-2 may explain its zoonotic transmission [32]. Genomic alignment of 54 SARS-CoV-2 genomes identified two hotspots of hypervariability at positions 8789 (synonymous variant) and 28,151(Ser/Leu change), located in the polyprotein and ORF8 genes respectively [33].",

A variety of other agents, including antiviral peptides and corticosteroids have been shown to be effective in vitro and/or in animal models [40,41]. However, clinical evidence does not support the use of corticosteroid treatment for SARS-CoV-2 lung injury [42]. Vaccines that have been developed are either not effective, or in some cases have been reported to be involved in the selection of novel pathogenic CoVs via recombination of circulating strains [12,22,40].

The initial cases were animal handlers in Guangzhou city having close contact with wild game food. It was suggested that civets could serve as an intermediate amplification host. Three months later, the SARS pandemic was rapidly and globally disseminated due to person-to-person transmission of the virus. On the February 21, 2003, a medical professor from Foshan in Guangdong province who was considered a \u201csuper-spreader\u201d went to Hong Kong to visit his relatives. During his stay in Hong Kong, he transmitted the virus to 2 family members, 4 health care workers (HCWs) and 12 other nearby residents. Because of international travel and transmission to HCWs, these patients spread the SARS-CoV to Hong Kong and other countries including Vietnam, Singapore and Canada. Eventually, 8422 people were infected in 32 countries and 919 (11%) died [9]. In China, 5328 cases were reported and 349 (6.5%) perished between November 16, 2002 and June 3, 2003 [9].",

The outbreak peaked within 6 weeks on the April 25, 2003 when 173 newly suspected SARS cases were hospitalized daily [46]. On the June 20, 2003, the last batch of 18 SARS patients recovered and were discharged from hospital, signaling the end of the pandemic in Beijing. The prompt resolution of the outbreak in Beijing was attributed to the rapid adoption of a series of effective control measures.1.Thousands of local and military health workers were deployed for emergency management of the outbreak. Large quantities of emergency supplies including personal protective equipment (PPE) and medical apparat were sent to front-line medical sectors. These people and materials were key to winning the war against SARS.2.More than 100 fever clinics were set up in all secondary and tertiary hospitals in Beijing. People visiting the fever clinics had a physical examination including body temperature, white blood cell count and chest radiograph. Fever clinics played an important role in screening and triage.3.All actively ill patients with SARS were concentrated in designated hospital wards. On the May 1, 2003, a new 1000-bed SARS hospital (Xiaotangshan Hospital, Beijing) was built and put into operation immediately. The advantages of having such a facility was that it was more conducive to the centralized management of SARS patients, and at the same time, it reduced transmission of the virus to healthy people.4.During the period of the SARS outbreak, more than 60,000 HCWs received medical training in the management of patients with SARS, infection control and the use of PPE.5.Multiple measures were taken to reduce person-to-person transmission, including isolation of patients with SARS, tracing and quarantine of close contacts, transit site surveillance and closing poorly maintained facilities that could enhance spread of the virus.6.Information dissemination was critical. Timely and accurate reporting of the status of the epidemic and scientific guidance on prevention and infection control played important roles in stabilizing people and overcoming the epidemic [[45], [46], [47], [48]].\n",

To date, many reports have described possible original and intermediate hosts (Fig. 1\n). Researchers found that the SARS-CoV-2 showed a higher sequence homology to Bat-CoV-RaTG13 that was previously detected in Rhinolophus affinis from Yunnan Province than Bat-SL-CoVZC21 and Bat-SL-CoVZC45, which suggested that the Chinese chrysanthemum bat is the origin of SARS-CoV-2. More recently, the pangolin was believed to be the likely intermediate host due to the fact that there appeared to be approximately 99% sequence homology between SARS-Co V-2 and the consensus sequence derived from >1000 metagenomic samples from the pangolin species [62].",

It is worth noting that a nucleic acid fragment of the SARS-CoV-2 was detected by Guangzhou Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on a doorknob touched by a confirmed patient [69].

[74], fifteen cases of childhood infection had been identified as of January 30, 2020, including 8 boys and 7 girls, ranging in age from 8 months to 12 years. Of the 15 pediatric cases, 13 had a clear history of family clustering in Wuhan. At present, several confirmed pregnant women in Wuhan have given birth during the illness. On February 2, 2020, Wuhan local media reported that a confirmed pregnant woman gave birth to a newborn by cesarean section under strict level three protection, but the newborn's throat swab was positive for the nucleic acid virus test [75]. However, Chen et al. tested the SARS-CoV-2 in amniotic fluid, cord blood, neonatal throat swab, and breastmilk samples from six confirmed SARS-CoV-2 pregnant women, and all samples tested negative for the virus, which suggests that there is currently no evidence for intrauterine infection caused by vertical transmission in women who develop COVID-19 pneumonia in late pregnancy [76]. No cases of newborns or child deaths have been reported. The NHC has called for close monitoring of outbreaks in children and pregnant women [77].",

For patients with underlying diseases, attention should be paid to the detection of invasive fungal infections. The differential diagnosis also includes non-infectious diseases such as vasculitis, dermatomyositis, and organizing pneumonia. It should be noted that often patients with viral pneumonia may test positive to multiple viruses, and the potential lethality of a combined SARS-CoV-2/influenza virus infection should not be ignored.",

The poor sensitivity of the current tests makes diagnosis and epidemic control more challenging. Sampling techniques, extraction and detection of viral nucleic acids, and diagnostic reagents may affect the test results. More attention should be paid to the sensitivity and specificity of diagnostic reagents, and diagnostic decisions should rely on comprehensive judgment based on the clinical manifestations, laboratory results and imaging examinations of patients.

Further phylogenetic analysis has posited that SARS-CoV-2 is a product of recombination with previously identified bat coronaviruses, but a recent report has subsequently identified a bat CoVs sequence, RaTG13, with 92\u201396% sequence identity with the novel virus, demonstrating that RaTG13 is the closest relative of the SARS-CoV-2 and forms a distinct lineage from other SARS-CoVs. This rejects the hypothesis of emergence as a result of a recombination event [94,96]. Even though there are high similarities between SARS-CoV-2 S and RaTG13 S, there are two distinct differences: one is an \u201cRRAR\u201d furin recognition site formed by an insertion residues in the S1/S2 protease cleavage site in SARS-CoV-2, rather than the single Arginine in SARS-CoV [[97], [98], [99], [100], [101]]; the other difference is the presence of 29 variant residues between SARS-CoV-2 S and RaTG13 S, 17 of which mapped to the receptor binding domain (RBD) [97].",

In similar fashion to SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 also uses ACE2 to gain entry into host cells. Hoffmann et al. found that the cellular protease MPRSS2 blocks entry by cleaving the spike protein and may constitute a treatment option [118]. Zhou et al. also confirmed that SARS-CoV-2 is able to use all but mouse ACE2 as an entry receptor for ACE2-expressing cells, but not cells without ACE2, indicating that the cell receptor for SARS-CoV-2 could be ACE2, and not other coronavirus receptors such as aminopeptidase N and dipeptidyl peptidase 4 [94]. Huang also showed that the affinity of the SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD binding to ACE2 is less than that of SARS-CoV through Monte Carlo algorithm [119]. However, Wrapp et al. found that SARS-CoV-2 S binding to ACE2 has approximately 10- to 20- fold higher affinity than SARS-CoV S, which can provide one explanation why SARS-CoV-2 has more human-to human spread compared to SARS-CoV [97].",

This process consists of the S1 subunit binding to the host cell receptor, triggering of the prefusion trimer's instability, and shedding of the S1 subunit, resulting in a highly stable post-fusion conformation of the S2 subunit [121]. During the binding of the subunit S1 to its cognate receptor, it is important to note that the S1 subunit exists in 2 different states, a \u201cdown\u201d conformation and an \u201cup\u201d conformation state, which corresponds to a receptor-inaccessible state and an unstable receptor-accessible state, respectively [[122], [123], [124], [125]].

The new facilities further enhance the local public health capacities. Hospitals offer online consultants and medical services to symptomatic patients and suspected patients, which help reduce the frequency that patients go to hospitals and thereby reduce the risk of being infected. Health care workers, including military medical teams, from across the Chinese mainland arrived in Hubei to provide much needed assistance.

Since the emergence of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, basic research on coronaviruses and advances in vaccine preparation technology can significantly shorten the development time of new coronavirus vaccines. However, the difficulties and challenges of developing an effective vaccine have been discussed earlier, and the key to a successful vaccine program is to vaccinate people before an outbreak occurs, not begin to develop the vaccine during the outbreak. Development of animal models that faithfully mimic SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans is critical not only in providing a more refined understanding of the pathogenic mechanisms involved but also to serve as a screening model for potential chemotherapeutic agents and vaccines.",

Early recognition of the problem, early identification of infected patients and early mobilization of healthcare resources are critical in limiting morbidity and mortality. When an outbreak occurs, it is very important to rapidly identify and characterize the pathogen, in order to be able to develop diagnostic assays. In the early stage of the disease epidemic, summarizing the clinical characteristics and treatment efficacy, formulating the diagnosis procedures, defining suspected cases and locations, determining transmission patterns, isolating contagious patients and formulating the appropriate quarantine strategy are all necessary and need to be implemented promptly.",

In addition, actively mobilizing the population to participate in epidemic prevention and control is critical, and this can be achieved by accurate information dissemination and ongoing updates. Real-time updating the information of the epidemic situation can help to alleviate panic and reduce societal anxiety. A strong public health surveillance system to guide the response to the outbreak is important in the face of a lack of effective therapeutics or vaccines. Big data and artificial intelligence systems are tools that can be used to fully integrate the information, conduct comprehensive research and analyze public health risks. Last but not least, use of the Internet and the media to conduct health education for the people, publicize the correct knowledge of prevention, and offer online consultation to guide patients to seek medical treatment correctly are additional strategies that can be implemented to achieve viral containment.",

This not only involves quarantining measures within China but also internationally, as countries canceled flights into China, quarantined their own nationals as they returned from China and installed thermal scanners to detect ill people. But the quarantine measures inside China are certainly eye-opening. The entire city of Wuhan was shut off, and this was extended to every other city in China. In effect, the entire country was told to stay home, creating an enormous impact on the economy and on people's daily lives. Roads and stores became deserted (Fig. 10\n). In Ningbo, each household was only permitted to send one person out for groceries every other day. Schools were closed till the end of March. Everyone wears masks. The objective was to starve the virus, to eliminate hosts. Yet even with these measures, new cases continued to appear. The quarantine measures in China have obviously come under a great deal of scrutiny, with so called \u201cexperts\u201d weighing in, some saying that it will not work, that isolating a city deprives it of medical resources. Whatever the criticism, it is humbling to think of what may have happened without these draconian measures. It is also difficult to comprehend if such measures could actually take place in other parts of the world, or if the implementation of these changes could have taken place as quickly. For example, hand shaking is not part of Chinese culture, but it is almost automatic in other parts of the world, and it is normally done without even thinking. This is the first thing that would have to stop to help contain the virus.",

It is possible that medical teams were already working on the sequence at that time. It is also quite possible that officials did not initially sound the alarm publicly because they did not want to cause a panic. Perhaps this was the wrong decision, but these decisions are difficult in times of crisis and it is of course easy to second guess. It is easy to understand that this can be perceived as withholding information and why the public would be frustrated.
