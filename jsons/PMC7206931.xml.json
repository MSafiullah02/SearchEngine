In addition, we sought to determine whether the effect of ACE inhibitors and statins noted in the overall study was also seen when the analysis was confined to a subgroup of patients who might have an indication for these agents. Thus, the association of ACE inhibitor use with in-hospital death was examined in the subgroup of patients with hypertension, and the association of statin use with in-hospital death was examined in the subgroup of patients with hyperlipidemia, with the use of age- and sex-adjusted logistic-regression analysis.

The endocytic event up-regulates the activity of ADAM metallopeptidase domain 17 (ADAM17), which cleaves ACE2 from the cell membrane, resulting in a loss of ACE2-mediated protection against the effects of activation of the tissue renin\u2013angiotensin\u2013aldosterone system while mediating the release of proinflammatory cytokines into the circulation.21 The stress of critical illness and inflammation may unite in destabilizing preexisting cardiovascular illness. Vascular endothelial cell dysfunction, inflammation-associated myocardial depression, stress cardiomyopathy, direct viral infection of the heart and its vessels, or the host response may cause or worsen heart failure, demand-related ischemia, and arrhythmias.22 These factors may underlie the observed associations between cardiovascular disease and death in Covid-19.",

Therefore, a cause-and-effect relationship between drug therapy and survival should not be inferred. These data also offer no information concerning the potential effect of initiation of ACE inhibitor or statin therapy in patients with Covid-19 who do not have an appropriate indication for these medications. Randomized clinical trials evaluating the role of ACE inhibitors and statins will be necessary before any conclusion can be reached regarding a potential benefit of these agents in patients with Covid-19.",
