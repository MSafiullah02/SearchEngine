International travel and ecological and human behavioral changes are considered to be factors responsible for the emergence of infectious diseases [10]. The ease of world travel has added layers of complexity to the containment of emerging infectious diseases (EIDs) within their areas of origin [11]. Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and the recent 2009 H1N1 influenza are examples of an epidemic and a pandemic, respectively, that resulted from convenient international air travel. A MERS outbreak that occurred in South Korea was also begun by a single imported case [12, 13].",

Hospital preparedness for a MERS response plan has been developed including clinical triage, using proper infrastructure to prevent transmission, strengthening the infection prevention and control system, accelerating laboratory capacity for early detection, and periodical education and training of HCWs on case management along with personal protective equipment, as well as environmental cleaning. Algorithms describing actions in response to a case or suspected case of MERS-CoV infection were developed. Simulation drill exercises have been conducted annually.

Personal protective equipment including N95 respirators was provided to HCWs who were involved with the patient as much as possible. With strict adherence to infection control measures, no secondary SARS transmission occurred in the institute [17]. However, SARS reminded us that our response system needed improvement. BIDI and the Ministry of Public Health of Thailand realized that a standard airborne isolation unit is essential in preparedness for future outbreaks of new EIDs. Development of the hospital infection control system was also accelerated. After this wake-up call, an airborne isolation unit with 5 negative pressure rooms was built with support from the Thai government. This unit is currently an important part of the environmental control for EIDs, including the MERS response of our institute.",

Implementation of standard and contact precautions is recommended from both guidelines. However, the CDC includes airborne transmission precautions whereas the WHO has recommended the use of surgical masks when caring for MERS patients and particulate respirators for aerosol-generating procedures (Table 1) [25, 26]. Although spread of MERS-CoV is more likely to occur via droplets and contact [28], the CDC recommendations are based on an expert review that contends that maximum precautions are required due to the high case fatality rate associated with MERS [29]. This discordance in recommendations may lead to confusion among healthcare providers. Nonetheless, we may never be able to know what kind of protective gear against MERS-CoV is the best in practice because conducting any randomized control trial would be unethical [30]. BIDI has opted for implementation of the maximum precautions stipulated in CDC guidance due to the gaps of present knowledge about the potential for airborne transmission of the novel coronavirus. In our institute, rapid isolation was done upon receiving laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection. We placed the patients in an airborne infection isolation room, and precautions to prevent airborne and contact transmission were strictly implemented. HCWs who were working with any MERS patient and/or their body fluids were protected by using an N95 respirator that had been fit tested, a gown, disposable gloves, eye protection, and a disposable cap. Hand hygiene was performed before entering and after leaving patients\u2019 rooms or after examining their specimens. We identified no transmission from any of our MERS patients to any of our HCWs [9].",

Environmental contamination may have led to infection among HCWs without contact with SARS patients [32]. In a MERS outbreak in South Korea, a number of those infected by the index MERS case of South Korea resided in the same hospital but in different wards or on different floors, making fomite transmission possible [33]. A recent study demonstrates that MERS-CoV remained viable for up to 48 hours under low temperature and low humidity conditions [34]. We have thus placed importance on environmental factors during the hospitalization of MERS patients. Environmental cleaning has been included in the MERS preparedness protocol of our institute.
