In a study of 642 confirmed cases during the early outbreak in the United States in April 2009, 60% of patients were \u2264 18 years of age. Among those with available data, 18% had history of recent travel to Mexico, whereas 16% were identified from school outbreaks. The most common presenting symptoms were fever (94%), cough (92%), and sore throat (66%); 25% of patients had diarrhea, and 25% had vomiting. Of the 399 patients for whom hospitalization status was known, 36 (9%) required hospitalization and two died.12 In a study of 863 confirmed cases in Ontario, Canada, cough, fever, sore throat, and gastrointestinal symptoms were reported in 92%, 91%, 41%, and 24% of patients, respectively, with a hospitalization rate of 3.6% and a case fatality ratio of 0.2%.13\n",

The median age of the 22 patients was 31 years and median duration of illness was 6 days. These findings confirm that bacterial lung infections are occurring among patients with fatal cases of pandemic A(H1N1) infection and underscore both the need for early recognition/treatment of bacterial pneumonia in patients with influenza and the importance of pneumococcal vaccination for persons at increased risk for pneumococcal pneumonia.25 The indications for hospitalization are listed in Table 3\n.26\n",

Patients with illnesses compatible with pandemic A(H1N1) virus infection but with negative rapid influenza diagnostic test results should be treated empirically based on the level of clinical suspicion, underlying medical conditions, severity of illness, and risk for complications. If a more definitive determination of infection with influenza virus is required, testing with real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) or virus isolation should be performed.27 In patients who require invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV), tracheal aspirates may offer higher diagnostic yield than nasopharyngeal flocked swab (Fig 2\n). Sequential sampling is important because it increases opportunities for positive diagnosis and facilitates understanding of viral load/clearance during illness course, in addition to monitoring development of antiviral resistance.",

Healthy patients with uncomplicated illness need not be treated with antivirals. For patients who initially present with severe illness or whose condition begins to deteriorate, treatment with oseltamivir should commence as soon as possible and antiviral treatment should be provided even if started later than 48 h. If oseltamivir is unavailable or cannot be used for any reason, zanamivir may be given. This recommendation applies to all patient groups, including pregnant women, and all age groups, including young children and infants.15 The Food and Drug Administration in the United States has approved emergency use of intravenous peramivir for treatment of severe cases,28 whereas zanamivir dry powder should not be administered by nebulization as the lactose sugar in this formulation can obstruct proper functioning of mechanical ventilator equipment.29\n",

            "text": "For patients with underlying medical conditions that increase the risk of more severe disease, the WHO recommends treatment with either oseltamivir or zanamivir as soon as possible after symptom onset, without waiting for the results of laboratory tests. About 30% to 40% of severe cases globally have occurred in previously healthy children and adults, usually under the age of 50 years. Some of these patients experience a sudden and very rapid deterioration in their clinical condition, usually on day 5 or 6 following the onset of symptoms. Clinical deterioration is characterized by primary viral pneumonia and failure of multiple organs, including the heart, kidneys, and liver. These patients require management in the ICU. In cases of severe or deteriorating illness, clinicians may consider using higher doses of oseltamivir and for a longer duration (eg, 150 mg bid for 10 days for adults) than is normally prescribed.15, 30\n",

            "text": "In summary, antiviral agents and pandemic vaccines are important modalities in the control of a pandemic, but their efficacy is limited by timing of administration and supply. Oxygen therapy and NPPV should be applied in health-care facilities with good ventilation and respiratory protection for the HCWs, but most patients with severe respiratory failure will require IMV. A lung-protective ventilation strategy and a conservative fluid management approach are recommended for patients with ARDS. Rescue therapies, including ECMO, may be considered only after application of standard ICU management practices. Low-dose systemic steroids may be considered for patients with refractory septic shock. The role of passive immunotherapy and immunomodulating agents, such as IV Ig, statins, gemfibrozil, and NAC, requires further investigations. Nonpharmacologic measures, such as early case isolation, household quarantine, school/workplace closure, good community hygiene, and restrictions on travel, are useful measures in controlling an influenza pandemic during the early phase.",
