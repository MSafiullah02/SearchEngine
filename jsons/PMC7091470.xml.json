Seriously-ill patients may develop dyspnea and/or hypoxemia one week after the onset of symptoms, and critically-ill patients can quickly progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome, septic shock, severe metabolic acidosis, coagulopathy, and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome.3",

Her SARS-CoV-2 reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test was positive and although she developed tachypnea, she did not develop significant hypoxemia. After admission, a computed tomography (CT) scan (Figure A) revealed the typical COVID-19 findings of patchy peripheral and subpleural ground-glass opacities4 in the left lower lobe/lingula junction. The right middle lobe of the lung also showed a small subpleural opacity of uneven density and blurred margins. Two days after admission, a repeat CT scan showed (Figure B) the number, density, and size of the lesions. Because of concern about potential further progression of the COVID-19 pulmonary manifestations, an uncomplicated elective Cesarean delivery was performed. The RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 was negative in the neonate.\n",
