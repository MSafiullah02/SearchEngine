In the course of an evaluation of respiratory tract specimens recovered from children with respiratory symptoms [1], it was found that one of the coronavirus-positive samples was obtained from a child with Kawasaki disease. This, as well as the previous detection of an unidentified antigen in tissue and macrophages from children with Kawasaki disease [2], led the investigators to explore a possible association of the novel coronavirus with Kawasaki disease.",

IFN-\u03b1-2b was initially administered at a dosage of 100 \u03bcg weekly, with a decrease to 50 \u03bcg weekly beginning at week 32. In a modified intention-to-treat analysis, combination therapy was associated with more frequent end-of-treatment clearance of HbeAg than was monotherapy (44% vs. 29%; P = .01), but subsequent relapses eliminated this advantage. Thus, 26 weeks after the end of treatment, 49 (36%) of 136 patients who were assigned to receive monotherapy and 46 (35%) of 130 who were assigned to receive combination therapy were HBeAg negative. Patients infected with genotypes A and B had better outcomes than did those infected with genotypes C and D. Similar results were obtained when suppression of viral DNA in serum or alanine aminotransferase concentrations were analyzed, leading to the conclusion that pegylated IFN-\u03b1-2b was effective for the treatment of HBeAg-positive chronic hepatitis B virus infection and that the addition of lamivudine to the treatment regimen provided no additional benefit.",

The innate response involves the recognition of pathogen-associated molecular patterns by cell surface receptors with relatively broad specificity, resulting in signals that trigger mobilization of antimicrobial effectors. The innate response is independent of immunological memory. The adaptive immune response, in contrast, depends on epitope binding to specific receptors. The innate response is effective even in the immunologically naive host, whereas the adaptive response depends on some degree of \u201cimmunologic education\u201d and requires a minimum of several days to become active. The innate immune response to viral pathogens requires a secondary intracellular event, such as IFN production, and, consequently, its appearance is delayed for hours. Bienasz proposes a third aspect of host response to viral pathogens\u2014intrinsic immunity\u2014which acts immediately on the virus-cell interaction.",

TRIM5\u03b1, a \u201crestriction factor\u201d that may account for the resistance of most nonhuman primates to infection with this human retrovirus, binds to incoming retroviral capsids.
