There is no definitive and approved treatment for cardiorespiratory sequels of these COV infections. Although from a pathophysiological point of view there is a deep understanding of the immune response to the virus, there is no approved treatment for immunomodulation in these patients thus it seems that treatment of immune system problems such as systemic pulmonary inflammatory responses associated with COV is necessitating. Immunity based treatment can be a good alternative and savior therapy to some antiviral treatment. As we know cytokine storms in lung tissue in most deadly events in patients with COV infection. Therefore, in cases of COV induced pneumonia, it is important to control cytokine production and inflammatory response. Although this strategy is challenging due to a lack of clear immune response and endangering the host defense, it does not seem impossible. In an attempt to address these issues from a therapeutic perspective, we describe our hypothesis about one of the most challenging theories of immunotherapy in COV viruses.Fig 1.\nFig 2.\nHypothesis:Replication of RNA viruses such as the COV family is accompanied by excessive production of interferons, neutrophils and macrophages which brings about a massive immune response, referred to as \u201ccytokine storm\u201d. This overproduction negatively affects the balance of the inflammatory responses and the normal function of cytokines.\n",

Further activation of these receptors can apply a suppressive effect on the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. [3] (Figure-1). Among the nicotine receptor subtypes, the subunit 7(\u03b1-7) is the most prominent due to its high expression in immune cells (B cells, macrophages, T cells, and target cells) and its association with humoral and intrinsic immunity. Therefore, evaluation of pharmacological approaches to activate \u03b1-7nAChR for inhibition of immunologic phenomenon such as cytokine storm can be helpful. Nicotine is a non-selective agonist of this receptor that mimics acetylcholine binding to stimulate vagal activity and decrease cytokine function and block the inflammatory pathway. The general algorithm of this idea was illustrated in Figure-2. Hence, comprehension of this theory can provide better therapeutic guidance for the treatment of coronavirus infections, especially COVID-19.",

            "text": "We describe one of the trends in the decline of the cytokine storm. It seems that lethality and uncontrolled complications of coronaviruses are due to the lack of control of the cytokine storms. Although the pathogenesis of coronaviruses is complex and requires specific treatment, previous studies have shown the efficacy of neutralizing anti-inflammatory cytokines in inflammatory conditions caused by COVID-19 [1]. Dose-dependent anti-inflammatory effects of the 7nAChR-1 agonist have been demonstrated, and previous studies have shown that activation of this receptor can have an anti-inflammatory role and immune cells regulating [4]. Nicotine is agonist of mentioned receptor but cannot be used clinically due to its toxicity, addictive nature, and lack of specificity. Other agonists of 7nAChR-1 receptors in this group, such as GTS-21, produce the same nicotine effects without nicotine problems. Also some studies have reported limited use of GTS-21 in the clinical phase and have shown that this agent can cause a decrease of cytokine levels and significantly reduced inflammatory biomarker after infection [3], [5]. It has been thought that a nicotine agonist compound like GTS-21 is able to suppress the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines during infection of COVID-19. In fact, these nicotine agonists can control allergic inflammation induced by innate immune and cellular immune pathways. Taken together according to mentioned literature review it can be concluded that GTS-21, as potent 7nAChR-1 receptor agonist, will act as an anti-inflammatory agent against COVID-19- infection-induced cytokine storm and inflammatory disturbances in respiratory system and reduced the risk of death in infected subjects.",
