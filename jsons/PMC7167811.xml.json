The synthesis of peptide aldehydes has recently been reviewed 18. The oxazolidine linker satisfies the following criteria for a general linker for the immobilisation of aldehyde functionality: (i) it is low cost and easy to construct, (ii) it is chemically stable (long shelf life), (iii) it does not require preformation (i.e. the aldehyde couples directly to the solid phase), (iv) aldehyde attachment is generic and (v) it cleaves under mild conditions that leave no residue upon evaporation, allowing biological screening without further purification. The linker has been used to synthesise several peptide aldehydes including fellutamide B 19 and a library of reversible SARS coronavirus main protease inhibitors 20.",

The Multipin method of peptide synthesis is an effective, low cost, simultaneous multiple synthesis technology, which gives researchers ready access to large numbers of peptides. The key to the method is that peptide synthesis and biological screening are totally integrated; no single peptide is given individual attention except at the coupling stages of the process. Synthesis has traditionally been performed on plastic pinsarranged in an 8 \u00d7 12 microtitre plate format, thus permitting the simultaneous preparation of sets of 96 peptides (or multiples thereof) 21. The fundamental advantage of this technology, which is an alternative to beaded cross\u2010linked resins, is the ease of handling large numbers in multiple parallel synthesis. Syntheses were performed on a hydrophilic graft polymer (polyamide), which is suited to aqueous chemistries and as described by Rademann et al. 20, is far superior to hydrophobic polymer matrices such as polystyrene resins and surfaces.",

            "text": "As shown in Scheme 1, the protected amino acid aldehyde is attached to the solid phase by condensation with a threonine residue 1 to form a support\u2010bound oxazolidine system 2. The oxazolidine is stable to non\u2010aqueous acid and to base, and as the secondary amine is difficult to acylate, it can tolerate subsequent peptide synthesis. Others have protected the secondary amine with a Boc group to eliminate possible acylation of this amine during peptide chain extension 20. Although this would be important for longer syntheses, and the synthesis of peptidomimetics requiring the use of more activated electrophiles, we found this extra protection step unnecessary for this short library synthesis. We do, however, recommend this advance made by Rademann 20 for future syntheses. Being stable to non\u2010aqueous acid, TFA may be used to remove acid\u2010labile protecting groups prior to release of the aldehyde function (i.e. cleavage). Importantly, the linker allows for side\u2010chain deprotection and subsequent removal of residual compounds such as TFA, organic solvents and scavengers before mild cleavage of the peptide aldehyde 4 using aqueous TFA (0.1%), containing acetonitrile as a cosolvent. The two\u2010step cleavage conditions allow for a shorter (30 min) TFA treatment because there is no concentration of product with no evidence of Pbf protecting group remaining on cleaved peptides. The mild cleavage conditions allowed for direct testing of all 400 unpurified peptide aldehydes in a protease assay.",

Arginine is particularly well suited to this design criterion because it is the preferred substrate P1 cleavage amino acid for a number of proteases. To prepare for library synthesis, we synthesised the peptide aldehyde leupeptin as a control sequence. Leupeptin is a naturally occurring microbial peptide aldehyde derived from the culture filtrates of different streptomyces. Importantly, all C\u2010terminal arginine peptide aldehydes partially exist in the hydrated form as demonstrated by the [M + H + H2O] + peak in all MS run (Table 2). Lewis and Wolfenden 22 demonstrated this originally in their work on the active site of papain, whereas Gancsik et al. 23 extended this work using 13C NMR spectroscopy. The hydrated form also exists in N\u2010terminal aldehydes as demonstrated by Rademann, Meldal and Bock 24 and Groth and Meldal 25. Hence, in aqueous solutions, peptide aldehydes exist as an equilibrium state between the aldehyde and hydrated forms.
