Comparison of the sequences of the viruses found in different animals should make it possible to trace the evolution of the SARS virus and determine which animal passed the disease to humans. Yi Guan, another member of the Hong Kong team, says that related viruses have so far been found in about half-a-dozen species \u2014 which he declines to name until the work has been published.",

Later the virus was found to reside in fruit bats13, so farmers could take measures to isolate their livestock from this natural reservoir. \"Once you find the source, you can find out how to manage it better,\" says John Mackenzie, a virologist at the University of Queensland in Brisbane, Australia.",

As with efforts to investigate the epidemiology of SARS in people, progress may depend on the development of improved diagnostic tests.

Preliminary evidence suggests that SARS followed a different model, apparently crossing over to people from wild animals, rather than livestock.

For instance, in many parts of the country, the diet is lacking in the trace element selenium. A team led by Melinda Beck of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill found that when the coxsackievirus B3 infects mice deficient in selenium, it mutates at a much higher rate and can become more virulent14. Beck suspects that this phenomenon may explain the high incidence of Keshan disease, a weakening of the heart muscle, in some Chinese populations15. She has also observed increased mutation rates in flu viruses infecting selenium-deficient mice16. \"The fact that China has widespread selenium-deficient areas may play a role in the emergence of new viral strains,\" Beck claims.",
