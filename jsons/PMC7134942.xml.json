            "text": "Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a common, disabling disorder that appears after the exposure to a traumatic experience (Nemeroff et al., 2006). Post-traumatic stress leads to a pattern of symptoms that include a delayed response to an acute stressful and a life-threatening event or situation, such as combat exposure during war time (Lavoie, Talbot, & Mathieu, 2011). These symptoms may appear either during or immediately after the occurrence of the event, or several days later. The symptoms include initially intense fear, helplessness, or horror. Later, the individual develops a response to the stressful event that is characterized by persistently re-experiencing the event, with resultant symptoms of numbness, avoidance and hyper-arousal (Risser, Hetzel-Riggin, Thomsen, & McCanne, 2006). According to the fourth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV), diagnostic criteria for PTSD require the onset of 17 characteristic symptoms following exposure to an extreme stressor (Criterion A1) and a reaction to that stressor that involves fear, helplessness, or horror (Criterion A2). Further, post-traumatic symptoms must be present for more than one month and include intrusive recollections of the traumatic event (Criterion B; at least 1 symptom), avoidant symptoms (Criterion C; at least 3 symptoms), and hyperarousal symptoms (Criterion D; at least 2 symptoms) (American Psychiatric Association, 2000). A few years later, the fifth edition of the DSM (American Psychiatric Association, 2013) proposed four distinct diagnostic clusters instead of three: re-experiencing symptoms (at least 1 symptom), avoidant symptoms (at least 1 symptom), negative alterations in cognitions and mood (at least 2 symptoms), and arousal symptoms (at least 2 symptoms). According to both editions of the DSM, symptoms of PTSD must persist for more than one month and must cause clinically significant distress or impairment in functioning.",

The combination of the stressful hospital environment during a war time and the individual experiences outside the work could expose nurses and other health care providers to a greater number of traumatic stressors which subsequently could lead to PTSD (Hodgetts, Broers, Godwin, Bowering, & Hasanovic, 2003). Hospital personnel are considered at high risk for severe injuries and mortality as part of their work, especially during war time. They will deal with masses of wounded people who are admitted to the hospital in a relatively short time. The increased number of admissions and the type of casualties during war time creates an extreme pressure on hospital personnel (Ben-Ezra, Palgi, & Essar, 2008).",

Several studies revealed that hospital personnel exposed to war experience had developed PTSD. For example, one study revealed that > 30% of American nurses who served during Vietnam war experienced PTSD-related symptoms (Paul, 1985). Another study revealed that 3.3% of those nurses who still in active duty had PTSD 20 years after the war (Stretch, Vail, & Maloney, 1985). A more recent study revealed that 10.5% of Israeli physicians and 35.7% of nurses who were working in Ramabm Hospital in Haifa during the war between Israel and Lebanon (July 12, 2006-August 14, 2006) experienced PTSD (Ben-Ezra et al., 2008). Nurses who were involved in Vietnam War with chronic PTSD reported abandoning nursing career, on-going, struggles with anger, involving in relationships in which they could not receive love, and a foreboding sense in their current lives (Buechler, 2007). Furthermore, being under direct threat toward one's life, family members, and friends while treating others is known to enhance emotional distress, burnout, and other negative consequences among mental health workers (Dekel & Baum, 2009).",

In another study, results revealed that about 70.1% of children and adolescents between the ages of 9 and 18 years who were exposed to the on-going Israeli-Palestinian conflict to have PTSD (Thabet, Abu Tawahina, El Sarraj, & Vostanis, 2008).

These results are very close to those reported in our previous studies where 291(89.8%) participants had a high level of PTSD. There are several potential reasons for the similarity of the results of the two studies. First, there were no specific treatment and/or counselling programs offered to the health care professionals with a few exceptions as only 34 (13.6%) of participants were offered some kind of help and counselling by some international organizations that are working in the Gaza Strip. A second possible reason could be that participant did not seek treatment. According to Yehuda (2002), usually victims of PTSD are hesitant to seek treatment. A final possible reason could be related to the fact that these health care professionals had experienced several offensive attacks against the Gaza Strip in the last decade, which will allow them to anticipate a new attack at any given time. Such anticipation will put them under continues threats to pass through a similar experience. According to Yehuda (2002, p. 108), \u201cmany persons with prior exposure to traumatic events may have a recrudescence of PTSD symptoms triggered by news of catastrophic events and their distressing effects.\u201d",

A previous study that was conducted by (Alhajjar, 2014) revealed that 69.4% of nurses reported to have PTSD after the Israeli offensive against Gaza Strip in 2008. Shamia, Thabet, and Vostanis (2015) used the Gaza Traumatic Events Checklist, PTSD Checklist, and Posttraumatic Growth Inventory. The aim of their study was to establish the association between war traumatic experiences, PTSD symptoms and post-traumatic growth among nurses in the Gaza Strip, 2 years after the 2008 war against Gaza Strip. Their results revealed that 19.7% of the nurses in the Gaza Strip reported full PTSD. In another study conducted by Ben-Ezra et al. (2007) who examined posttraumatic symptoms among nurses and doctors at the last few days of the war erupted between Israel and Lebanon, they found that 10.5% of physicians and 35.7% of nurses had high levels of PTSD symptoms. Ben-Ezra et al. concluded that nurses were 5.28 times more likely to endorse high levels of PTSD symptoms. The prevalence of PTSD among participants of Ben Ezra et al. is much less than reported in our study. Both studies revealed that nurses were at higher risks than doctors to develop PTSD. A few other studies reported higher prevalence of posttraumatic stress among nurses in comparison to doctors after exposure to single trauma (Grieger et al., 2003, Luce et al., 2002, Maunder, 2004).",

            "text": "Such differences can be attributed to several reasons. First, as nurses spend more time with their clients than doctors do, they have more sympathy to their patients and they will be subject to more traumatic narratives as part of their duty, which can lead to more identification with their clients (Ben-Ezra et al., 2007). According to Regehr, Goldberg, and Hughes (2002), such sympathy and identification is assumed to put nurses at higher risk to develop PTSD. Second, as part of their medical training, doctors are exposed to cadavers and dead bodies which help them to develop coping strategies which resolved in higher resilience during the exposure to victims during war time (Weiniger et al., 2006). Finally, nurses have different responsibilities while taking care of the health status of their clients with less forensic responsibility and authority compared to doctors. Therefore; there is a higher possibility that doctors will perceive control over the event in such situations which may reduce their feelings of helplessness in comparison to nurses (Luce et al., 2002). The high prevalence of PTSD among nurses and other health care providers in this study and other studies (Alhajjar, 2014, Ben-Ezra et al., 2007, Ben-Ezra et al., 2008) may question the common notion of resilience among hospital nurses and other health care providers (Luce et al., 2002).",

Such high prevalence rates may have negative consequences in the coming future on nurses and doctors, who constitute the back bone of the Palestinian health care system. Literature has connected PTSD with negative health outcomes (Wolfe, Schnurr, Brown, & Furey, 1994) and adverse psychological disorders (Gibbons, Hickling, & Watts, 2012) such as the existence of acute depression (Hickling et al., 2011, O'Donnell et al., 2004), anxiety, and adverse psychosocial impact (Hickling et al., 2011, Weinberg and Creed, 2000). Similarly, Weinberg and Creed (2000) added that health workers with post traumatic distress are more vulnerable to psychiatric disorders and ongoing social stress outside of work. Furthermore, the analysis of a study conducted by Niiyama et al. (2009) revealed that only 17% of nurse recovered from traumatic stress while the other 83% had persistent traumatic stress. Moreover; studies showed that prevalence of PTSD is associated with burn out syndrome, which together has a great impact on work and non-work related activities and perceptions (Mealer et al., 2009).",

Although in our previous study (Abu-El-Noor et al., 2016) we called for immediate interventions from health care policy makers and hospital administrations and to offer adequate treatment and counselling for those affected by the war stress and to take further interventions to improve their mental health, to reduce the incidence of chronic PTSD and other possible psychiatric disorders, improve their job satisfaction and reduce burn out to retain them in their professions, but on the ground, there were no actions taken. The only actions that were taken were sporadic interventions that were taken by international organizations, such as Doctors of Spain. We believe that this was not enough. There are several possible reasons that health policy makers did not intervene to offer help and counselling to health care providers affected by the war. First, it is possible that health policy makers are not aware of the impact of PTSD. A second possible reason is lack of financial resources. Gaza Strip passes through crises and under siege for the last decade. Financial resources are very limited; therefore, priorities are in a continuous dramatic change. Meeting physical needs such are water, food, and electricity supplies come first in the priority list of the government. A third possible reason is that international health organizations are not engaged in offering such help as they are also considering meeting physical needs as a priority. Only a few number of organizations had offered counselling to health care professionals after the war. A final possible reason could be related to the gap between research and policy makers as some policy makers don't take seriously the results of research studies into their considerations. The literature described the gap between research and practice in health care and public health as large and troubling (Glasgow and Emmons, 2007, Lenfant, 2003). Again, we encourage our health policy makers to reconsider their policy and to intervene to save these doctors and nurses from chronic complications to PTSD.",
