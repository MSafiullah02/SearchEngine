            "text": "Newcastle Disease Virus (NDV), a prototype of paramyxovirus, is an avian enveloped RNA-negative strand virus that causes respiratory disease in domestic fowl, leading to huge economic losses in the poultry industry. The envelope of NDV contains two associated glycoproteins that mediate viral entry: the hemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN) and fusion (F) proteins. HN is the receptor-binding protein that recognizes and binds to sialoglycoconjugates at the cell surface [1] and also has receptor-cleaving (sialidase) activity [2]. Based on crystallographic studies of the HN of NDV, two sialic acid-binding sites have been described [3], [4], site II being located at the dimer interface and activated after engagement of site I to its receptor [4], [5]. Site I exhibits both receptor-binding and sialidase activities while site II only has receptor binding activity [4]. Moreover, the triggering of F protein requires the presence of its homotypic attachment protein through its fusion promotion activity.",

Moreover, recent studies suggest that viruses with pH-independent fusion proteins may use endocytosis for entry (revised in [8]). Different families of viruses may use several different endocytic routes [9], [10], [11], the major pathway being the clathrin-mediated endocytosis used by viruses such as Semliki Forest and Sindbis alpha virus [12] or Hantaan virus [13]. Recent reports indicate that HIV also uses this route productively [14]. Caveola-mediated endocytosis is the second best characterized pathway used by SV40 and Ebola viruses to enter cells [15], [16], [17], [18]. Although most viruses have been described to enter the cell through a unique mechanism, there are increasing reports showing that many viruses are able to use alternative uptake pathways to infect different target cells or even simultaneous entry mechanisms in the same cell type ([8], [19] and references therein).",

            "text": "With the exception of the fusion protein of the human metapneumovirus (HMPV), which depends on low-pH [20], paramyxovirus fusion proteins are activated at neutral pH, which suggests that viral entry occurs by direct fusion at the plasma membrane [2]. Nevertheless, recent reports point to the notion that the pH requirement for fusion does not necessarily imply the location of membrane fusion (revised in [21], [22]). Some members of the paramyxoviruses such as Sendai, Nipah, human metapneumovirus and human respiratory syncytial virus (hRSV) [23], [24], [25], [26] utilize the endocytic machinery for entry. Furthermore, as assessed by a R18 dequenching assay, our previous studies revealed the enhancement of NDV fusion with Cos-7 at acidic pH [27] and the colocalization of NDV with the early endosome marker EEA1 [28]. These findings prompted us to suggest that the entry of NDV would occur through caveola-mediated endocytosis as an additional mechanism to direct fusion with the plasma membrane [28]. To gain further insight into the molecular mechanisms of NDV entry, the present study focuses on the characterization of the NDV entry mechanism through the use of low-pH treatment of several cell lines that differ in the expression of sialoglycoconjugates at their surface and by analyzing the effect of different substances that either interfere with endocytosis or endosomal acidification on NDV interaction with cells. NDV entry showed to be sensitive to endosomal acid pH, and dynamin and protein kinase C inhibitors blocked NDV fusion and infectivity. Our data support the idea that NDV may penetrate HeLa and ELL-0 cells both by direct fusion at the cell surface and through receptor-mediated and dynamin-dependent endocytosis, at least in these cell lines.",

Next, we wished to determine whether syncytium formation was also stimulated by exposure to low pH in both virus-infected and HN/F transfected cells. HeLa and ELL-0 cells were infected with NDV at a moi of 1 for 1 h at 37 \u00b0C. Then, cells were treated with three pulses (3 min each) of pH 5.0- or pH 7.4-buffered PBS, with 1 h interval between each pulse. At 24 h post-infection syncytia were quantified (Fig. 2A). As expected, syncytium formation was enhanced about 2 times as compared with the control in both cell lines. These data correlate with the enhancement of viral infectivity observed after infection with the recombinant NDV rNDV-F3aa-mRFP (Fig. 3\n), as discussed later. Additionally, to determine whether HN protein was essential for fusion after acidic pH treatment, HeLa cells were transfected with F and/or HN vectors; at 24 h post-transfection, cells were treated with three low-pH pulses, as above. When the cells were cotransfected with both F and HN plasmids, syncytium formation was increased 3.5 times after low-pH exposure (Fig. 2B) in comparison with the controls; acidic pH treatment increased both the number and the size of the syncytia (micrograph in Fig. 2B). Nevertheless, NDV F protein did not promote the formation of syncytia in the absence of HN when treated with low pH (Fig. 2B).",

Then, fluorescence-labeled erythrocytes were added and allowed to fuse for 1 h at 25 \u00b0C, 29 \u00b0C, 31 \u00b0C or 37 \u00b0C. As shown in Fig. 4\n, fusion did not occur at 25 \u00b0C either at neutral pH or after low-pH treatment, although we did observe an increase in RBCs binding to transfected cells at acidic pH at this temperature (Fig. 4A, R18 panel, and Supplementary Fig. S2), which might contribute to the enhancement of fusion at fusion-permissive temperatures. Nevertheless, at the suboptimum temperatures of 29 \u00b0C and 31 \u00b0C, the extent of fusion after treatment at pH 5.0 was similar to that of fusion at 37 \u00b0C at neutral pH. Finally, as seen in Fig. 2, after low-pH treatment fusion was increased about 2-fold at 37 \u00b0C. In all cases, transfer of the two probes \u2013 R18 and calcein \u2013 was similar, indicating that the enhancement of fusion due to the pulse of acidic pH had a similar effect on hemifusion (transfer of R18 from the membrane of the erythrocytes to the membrane of the cell) and on complete fusion (transfer of calcein from the cytoplasm of the erythrocyte to the cytoplasm of the cell). As mentioned above, these data support the hypothesis that acid pH would decrease the energetic barrier needed for protein activation prior to the triggering of fusion, although this hypothetical decrease was not enough to allow fusion at 25 \u00b0C. Therefore, acidic pH might increase the number of F proteins that undergo the conformational changes leading to membrane fusion, even though the presence of HN protein would still be required.",

            "text": "The enhancement of NDV fusion and infectivity by exposure to acidic pH reported above (Fig. 1, Fig. 2, Fig. 3) is in agreement with our previous results [27], [28] and strongly supports a role for low pH in NDV entry and the notion that a certain percentage of NDV may enter cells by endocytosis, at least in certain cell lines such as HeLa, ELL-0 and Cos-7. Since in the course of an infection a virus would encounter low pH after endocytosis and trafficking through the endocytic pathway, we wanted to further explore the possible endocytic entry of NDV studying the effect of different substances that interfere either with endocytosis or endosomal acidification (Table 1). First, we incubated the target cells in the presence of bisindolylmaleimide I (BIM), a highly selective, cell-permeable, and reversible protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitor [37], [38]. In most of the cells, cell viability as assayed by a Trypan blue exclusion method was higher than 90%, except in GM95, where a strong cytopathic effect of the drug was observed (about 60% of cell death, data not shown). We analyzed the effect of BIM preincubation on NDV infectivity under three different conditions: i) drug was present during infection and then withdrawn from the culture medium (Virus + BIM); ii) drug present for the duration of the assays, i.e., during infection and for 24 h post-infection (Virus + BIM/BIM); and iii) drug was added at 1 h post-infection (Virus/BIM). The data are summarized in Fig. 5\n; since BIM per se is a compound that exhibits red fluorescence, the background (Fig. 5A, BIM) was subtracted from the red fluorescence due to the mRFP expression occurring after rNDV-F3aa-mRFP infection. The inhibitory effect of BIM was not observed when the drug was added post-infection, meaning that it must act during an early stage of the infection. The data concerning inhibition (approximately 26% of inhibition as compared with the control) correlated well with the observed enhancement of viral fusion in both cell lines after the low-pH exposure shown in Fig. 3. The infectivity of NDV in GM95-treated cells was also reduced after BIM treatment, but the observed reduction could have been be due to the negative effect of the drug on cell viability. According to our results, NDV could penetrate in HeLa and ELL-0 cells through receptor-mediated endocytosis, since the inhibition of PKC reduced NDV infectivity by 30% in comparison with the control (Fig. 5). Similarly, the activity of PKC is essential for the entry of different non-enveloped [39] or enveloped viruses, such as influenza virus [38], alphavirus, rhabdovirus, poxvirus and herpes virus [40], which has been related to the entry through receptor-mediated endocytosis. Furthermore, we have previously suggested that caveolae/rafts could be a possible platform for NDV entry [28], [41] and caveolae seem to be the major cell surface locations for PKC [42], [43].",

            "text": "We also analyzed the effect of dynasore, a drug that inhibits the GTPase activity of dynamin 1, which has been implicated in clathrin- and caveola-mediated endocytosis [44]. Owing to the high toxicity of this drug in MEB4, GM95, CHO and Lec1 cells, these experiments were only performed in HeLa and ELL-0 cells, in which cell viability was higher than 95% after dynasore treatment (data not shown). The fusion of NDV with treated-HeLa and ELL-0 cells was almost completely abrogated (Fig. 6A), as was infectivity, when assayed both by fluorescence microscopy after rNDV-F3aa-mRFP infection (Fig. 6B) and by FACS (Fig. 6C). Nevertheless, the binding of NDV to drug-treated cells was not modified (data not shown). However, the addition of dynasore at 10 min post-infection resulted in only a minor decrease in infection, with no effect if added at 20 min post-infection (Fig. 6D), implying that the main role of dynamin was exerted during the early infection steps and again supporting a role of endocytosis in NDV entry. The rate of fusion and infectivity inhibition exerted by dynasore (more than 80%) was higher than that of BIM (Fig. 5) and than the observed enhancement of NDV fusion and infectivity after low-pH exposure (Fig. 1, Fig. 2, Fig. 3, Fig. 4). Dynamin is essential not only for the fission of endocytic vesicles in the endocytic pathways but also for membrane fusion [45], being involved in fusion pore expansion [46], [47]. Additionally, dynamin has been implicated in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton [48], which could account for the stronger negative effect of dynasore preincubation of cells on NDV activities. The drug might negatively affect not only endocytic entry but also the direct fusion of NDV with the cell plasma membrane. In sum, the data regarding the effect of dynasore on NDV fusion and infectivity discussed above indicate that, at least in HeLa and ELL-0 cells, NDV needs dynamin activity, as described for other viruses such as HIV [14], HPV16 and BPV1 [49].",

The data concerning the effect of the three different compounds on NDV activities are summarized in Fig. 7\nand in Table 2\n. The treatment of cells with one of the three compounds strongly inhibited virus\u2013cell fusion, resulting in an approximately 80% reduction in virus\u2013cell fusion after concanamycin A and monensin treatments, whereas chloroquine preincubation reduced viral fusion by about 60% (Fig. 7A). Similarly, the three drugs strongly reduced NDV infectivity (Fig. 7B, C, D). The negative effect of chloroquine was not observed if the drug was withdrawn when the virus was added (Fig. 7C, CQ 1 h) or was added at 5 h post-infection (Fig. 7C, CQ post-infection), meaning that the negative effect would be exerted at the early steps of the viral cycle. Viral binding to the cell surface was unaffected by any of the three compounds (Table 2). Nevertheless, in ELL-0 and HeLa cells fusion and infectivity inhibition by inhibitors of endosomal acidification (Fig. 7 and Table 2) were stronger than the enhancement observed after acid-pH treatment (Fig. 1, Fig. 3). In HeLa and ELL-0 cells, inhibition of virus infectivity resulting from monensin treatment was largely prevented by exposure to acidic pH (Supplementary Fig. S3). Moreover, concanamycin A, monensin and chloroquine would interfere with processes other than NDV fusion in endosomal compartments. In addition to raising the endosomal pH, it has been reported that chloroquine has multiple effects on mammalian cells [53]. Chloroquine inhibition of SARS-CoV infection is proposed to be exerted due to the interference with the terminal glycosylation of the viral receptor [54]. In addition, trafficking events other than NDV entry itself might be disturbed, since vesicular ATPase is involved in the regulation of trafficking events in endosomal compartments.",

Uninternalized virions as well as cell surface glycoproteins from virions that have fused directly with the plasma membrane would be digested by proteinase K, contrary to endocytosed virions that became protected from digestion. In ELL-0 cells a significant proportion of HN glycoprotein became protected after 6 min of incubation at 37 \u00b0C (Fig. 8A), which correlates with use of an endocytic pathway for virus entry. We also carried out the experiments with HeLa and MEB4 cells (Fig. 8B) looking for HN protection at 10 min after the initiation of entry. Although total digestion of viral glycoproteins was not observed at 4 \u00b0C (Fig. 8B, lanes 6 and 8), after incubation at 37 \u00b0C for 10 min we detected an increase in the proportion of non-digested viral HN (Fig. 8B, lanes 5 and 7), strongly supporting that a percentage of virus would also use endocytosis for entering both cell lines.",

            "text": "Class I viral fusion proteins can be activated by at least three different triggers: low pH, receptor binding at neutral pH, or receptor binding followed by low pH [55], [56]. Moreover, the fusion protein of the human metapneumovirus is activated by proteolysis and by acidic pH [20], [25]. The use of the endocytic pathways for paramyxovirus entry has been suggested as a common entry mechanism for the Pneumovirinae subfamily [25]. As stated above, NDV is able to fuse with cells at neutral pH; nevertheless, here we have shown in HeLa and ELL-0 cells (Fig. 1, Fig. 2, Fig. 3, Fig. 4) an enhancement of viral fusion and infectivity of approximately 30% after a brief pulse of low-pH, in agreement with our previous data [27], [28]. Although acid pH is not an absolute requirement for NDV infection, an acid pH environment would facilitate the conformational changes needed for fusion by decreasing the energetic barrier, as suggested above. This hypothetical decrease would not be enough for the activation of F in the absence of the homotypic HN (Fig. 2B), a phenotype that we have previously observed in N211A, I463A and I463F protein F mutants [57]. Another possibility is that acid pH would increase the fusion promotion activity of HN protein. As mentioned above, the second HN binding site, site II, is activated upon receptor binding to site I and exhibits higher receptor avidity than site I [5]. As speculated for the paramyxovirus HPIV3 [58], low pH may facilitate the exposure of site II and thus increase the fusion promotion activity of the protein since site II has been shown to be essential in HPIV3 and NDV F activation [59], [60].",

Similarly, some viruses utilize different cellular entry pathways to infect different target cells, such as herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1), which can enter cells through the plasma membrane as well as by low-pH and neutral-pH endocytosis, depending on the cell line and receptor(s) [19], [34], [61].

This discrepancy may be explained by different possibilities: i) NDV does not enter MEB4 nor GM95 by endocytosis, and the negative effect of raising the pH in endosomes would be related to the interference with trafficking events other than NDV entry itself as discussed above; ii) the endocytic entry of NDV into MEB4 (with GM3 as the only ganglioside at the cell membrane) and GM95 (without gangliosides) cells may follow a different mechanism from that of HeLa and ELL-0 cells. Contrary to ELL-0 and HeLa cells, inhibition of virus infectivity resulting from monensin treatment was not prevented by exposure to acidic pH (Supplementary Fig. S3) supporting that the inhibition of endosomal acidification would have additional post-entry effects in these cell lines. Nevertheless, further experiments will be conducted to test these hypotheses.",

ELL-0 and HeLa cell membranes are abundant in \u03b12,6 sialic acid compounds in comparison with the other cell lines ([63] and data not shown). Thus, it is tempting to speculate that this difference might be involved in diverse entry mechanisms of NDV into the host cell: only when the virus engages the proper molecule could be endocytosed, after which the viral envelope would fuse in the endocytic compartments. The binding of NDV to sialic acids in \u03b12,6 specific linkages could allow the endocytic entry of NDV, and could be directly required either for endocytic internalization or to facilitate subsequent molecular changes enabling endocytosis. Further experiments will be needed to clarify this point.",
