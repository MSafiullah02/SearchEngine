The difference of the properties means the different internal structures of the network; moreover the different internal structures of the network bring about the difference of the systemic function.

An important discover in the complex network researching is that the average path length of the most of the large-scale real networks is much less than our imagine, which we call ''Small-world Effect''. This viewpoint comes from the famous experiment of ''Milgram Small-world'', the experiment required the participators to send a letter to one of their acquaintances making sure the letter reach the recipient of the letter, in order to figure out the distribution of the path length in the network, the result shows that the number of the average passing person is just six, in addition the experiment is also the origin of the popular theory ''6\u00b0of separation''.",

So the regular networks and random networks can not reflect the property of the realworld, it shows that the realworld is not well-defined neither is complete random. Watts and Strogatz found a network which contains both small-world and high-aggregation in 1988, which is a great break in the complex network researching. They connected every side to a new node with probability p,through which they build a network between regular network and random network (calling WS net for short), it has less average path length and larger convergence factor, while the regular network and random network are special case when p is 0 and 1 in the WS net.",

The advantage of NW model is that the model simplifies the theory analysis, since the WS model may have orphan nodes which NW would not do. In fact, when p is few while N is large, the results of the theory analysis of the two models will be the same; we call them small-world model now.",

In order to explain the foundation of the Scale-free network, Barab\u00e1si and Albert found the famous BA model, they thought the networks raised before did not consider the two important property of the realworld-growth property and connection optimization, the former means the new nodes are constantly coming into the network, the latter means after their arriving the new nodes prefer to connect the nodes with large degree. Not only do they make the simulation analysis of the generating algorithm of the BA model, but also it has given the analytic solution to the model using the way of the mean field in statistical physics, as the result put: after enough time of evolution, the distribution of BA network don't change with time, degree distribution is power-law with its index number 3 steadily.",
