After reading the paper, my immediate reaction is that the paper is an outstanding contribution to the field of social indicators because it carefully charts the history of the social indicators movement and highlights some important future research directions. As it is a \u201cheavy weight\u201d paper written by two gurus in the field of social indicators, it is a \u201cmust read\u201d paper by students and researchers in the field of social indicators research.",

The paper starts by describing the social indicators movement in the 1960s and its evolution in the past half of a century such as the development of different social indicators systems and academic journals. Then the authors describe the contemporary state of social indicators, quality of life and well-being studies and conclude that \u201cnumerous composite indices exist at all levels of analysis\u2014from international comparisons to national-level indices to subnational/regional levels and for various sub-populations\u201d (p. 28) and five examples are presented to illustrate such indicators.

I will discuss the progress of the Social Indicator Movement with reference to the tasks that social indicators researchers should accomplish as described by Solomon et al. (1980). Concerning paradigms of research on social progress, we argue that quality of life research in different paradigms generates different pictures on \u201csocial progress\u201d. Regarding puzzles in social indicators research, we consider several issues, including the role of qualitative data, role of evaluation in social programs, feasibility of assessing social progress, choice of social indicators to be used, interpretations of findings, methodological debates and explanations for social change. We will then examine, how social indicators research findings can inform policy according to its original promise. Finally, future research directions will be highlighted.",

            "text": "Solomon et al. (1980) suggested a list of tasks to be undertaken at the initial stage of the Social Indicators Movement. It would be interesting to ask the extent to which such tasks are accomplished after roughly 36 years.\nTask 1\u2014\u201cStudying objective life conditions and subjective life quality experience and their inter-relationships\u201d As pointed out by Land and Michalos (2015), many frameworks for measuring objective life conditions have been developed and numerous studies have been conducted. Similarly, many studies on subjective life quality experience have been conducted. However, studies on the inter-relationships between these two domains seem not to have been the primary focus in the field. Thus, it is important to find ways to align these two domains in future.\nTask 2\u2014\u201cBeyond description of conditions and experiences and to explore relationships amongst interdependent factors\u201d While models of objective indicators and experiences of life quality have been constructed and tested, more work is needed to explore the \u201cinterdependent\u201d factors.\nTask 3\u2014\u201cTo examine life quality not just on the societal level but also group and individual levels, and investigate their inter-relationships\u201d While most of the existing studies have examined quality of life at the societal level, there are comparatively fewer studies examining group and individual life quality. There are even fewer studies investigating the inter-relationships amongst quality of life on the different levels.\nTask 4\u2014\u201cTo understand how individuals and groups participate to create their life quality\u201d Most of the related studies focus on quality of life outcomes (social indicators of outcomes) with few studies examining how people create their life quality and the related process. There is a need to focus more on the human agency.\nTask 5\u2014\u201cTo treat quality of life as a dynamic process than a static state\u201d Although objective social indicators are usually collected over time, researchers usually regard the construct as static state. Explanations of the changes are commonly ad hoc in nature. Moreover, longitudinal research on subjective life studies is not common.\nTask 6\u2014\u201cFoster cross-cultural comparisons and encourage institutions and international organizations to collaborate\u201d There are emerging studies examining cross-cultural comparisons but the development is still in its infancy (Shek et al. 2005a; Shek 2010, 2011). Collaboration amongst institutions and international organizations is growing but is yet to mature.\nTask 7\u2014\u201cTo stimulate quality of life research in places without related research tradition\u201d We have seen some progress in non-Western contexts, such as studies conducted in Asia (Chua et al. 2010; Ip and Shek 2014). However, the five illustrative examples given by Land and Michalos are all projects in English speaking communities.\nTask 8\u2014\u201cReflection and recognition about cultural differences\u201d This is a neglected aspect in the movement. Social indicators researchers have commonly assumed that the indicators are universally valid, and can be used in different cultures. Even though some social indicators researchers recognize cultural differences, the related reflection is not substantial.\nTask 9\u2014\u201cPromoting inter-disciplinary projects\u201d We witnessed inter-disciplinary collaboration amongst sociologists, political scientists, social workers, and social policy scholars who were more focused on the \u201cmacro\u201d aspect of quality of life. However, the link between macro and micro disciplines (such as Psychology) remains to be achieved. For example, epidemiological studies are commonly conducted in psychology, psychiatry or mental health. However, such findings are seldom mentioned in social indicators research.\nTask 10\u2014\u201cRegard biophysical and social environment and their perception as basic elements of quality of life\u201d Most studies have actually mostly done this. However, the spiritual dimension, despite its importance, is not commonly included in social indicators research.\nTask 11\u2014\u201cConduct projects that have relevance for decision-makers\u201d Some studies have attempted to do this, although some social indicators research (particularly those involving ranking of different sites) simply promote understanding without much relevance to decision-makers.\n",

The choice of research paradigm does not only dictate the research methods but also the interpretations of findings (Neuman and Kreuger 2003). Hence, it is important to reflect about social indicators research conducted within different paradigms. To be simple, we can regard paradigm as a lens through which we can see and understand the reality, such as social progress. It addresses the issue of ontology (i.e., the nature of reality one assumes, including whether it exists or not), epistemology (i.e., the question of \u201chow do we know?\u201d) and methodology (i.e., ways through which the reality can be known).",

In terms of paradigm, it is a product within positivism or post-positivism (Denzin and Lincoln 1998, 2011). Positivistic or post-positivistic research on social progress demands the use of social science methods involving deductive logic and precise observations with the research objectives of discovering and testing generalizable nomothetic universal laws, which can predict human behavior. Researchers adopting a positivistic or post-positivistic paradigm typically assume that social reality is stable over time and preexisting regularities can be scientifically studied. Through precise instruments and objective research methods, social indicator researchers can know the reality just like pressing a button of the camera. To maintain neutrality in research, common sense and values do not enter into the picture of positivistic social indicators investigation.",

First, while positivistic research assumes that we can understand social reality in a \u201csocial vacuum\u201d, there is growing criticism of this \u201ccontext stripping\u201d view and there is a call for contextual understanding of observed social phenomena. Second, the dualist assumption of the separation between theories and observations of facts is questionable and many researchers argue that \u201cfacts\u201d are in fact theory-laden (i.e., thinking shaped by some existing preoccupation). Third, the thesis that it is possible to be totally objective may not be tenable because values and facts are value-laden and inter-dependent. Finally, there is the criticism that it is impossible to have impartial observers because inquirers might influence the observation process (Denzin and Lincoln 1998, 2011).",

Instead of relying on hypothetical-deductive models and supposedly \u201cobjective\u201d observations, the purpose of research is to understand social reality that cannot be fully understood in terms of causal laws. As it is assumed that social reality is fluid and there are no preexisting regularities, individual interpretations and social constructions are important. According to this paradigm, common sense is an important source of understanding and values are indispensable in the research process. In contrast to the positivistic practice of using precise measurement, interpretive and constructionist social scientists commonly use interviews, narrative research, natural observations, qualitative studies, and ethnography. Hence, profiles based on social indicators are regarded as \u201cnaive realism\u201d because social reality is always fluid and thus beyond the description by static statistical indicators. Statistical models can generate good maps but such maps are without \u201cblood and flesh\u201d and \u201clived experience\u201d that cannot help people understand the experience of individuals and social groups.",

Besides looking at the underlying power relations that cannot be seen on the surface, critical social scientists help people build a better world for themselves.

In fact, because of its dynamic nature, exploitation, inequalities and injustice cannot be fully reflected in statistical measures.

Greene et al. (1989) also noted five reasons to combine quantitative and qualitative methods in a single study. First, mixing methods (especially triangulation) can help to seek convergence of findings. For example, it is possible to show by using statistical data and subjective interviews that ordinary people cannot afford to buy a flat. Second, complementarity mixed methods study is able to bring out different opinions about a phenomenon. For example, while quantitative housing affordability index suggests that housing is not affordable, qualitative interview data can give some indication how paying the high mortgage affects negatively people\u2019s lives. Third, researchers can combine qualitative and quantitative methods in a developmental manner where the first method helps to inform the second method. For example, based on the housing affordability index information which suggests that housing is a problem, researchers can then carry out field observations about the lived experiences of people. Fourth, mixed methods research can help to deal with contradictions in findings with the emergence of fresh perspectives (i.e., initiation). For example, researchers can use qualitative methods to understand the contradiction observed in the quantitative data, such as increase in income but decrease in happiness. Finally, mixed methods can be used to add more understanding to a study (i.e., expansion). For example, qualitative research can be carried out to understand the information provided by the housing affordability index.",

Interestingly, two observations can be highlighted on the use of social indicators in the evaluation of social programs. First, comparing with description and monitoring functions of social indicators, the evaluation function of social indicators has been given relatively weaker weight. One possible explanation is that macro social indicators such as indicators at the national level may not be sensitive measures for social programs, which may be more individualistic and community-based. It also takes time for social intervention programs to create outcomes, which can impact on changes in social indicators. Nevertheless, for specific areas such as welfare, security and health, social indicators have been frequently used to reflect the effect of social intervention\u2014poverty rates have been used to reflect the effectiveness of poverty alleviation programs; substance abuse rates have been used to reflect community anti-drug programs; infection diseases rates have been used to reflect flu shot programs.",

An important precondition, however, is that there is a societal or even political consensus about three key issues: first, about the dimensions that are relevant for welfare considerations; second, about good and bad conditions; third, about the direction in which society should move\u201d (p. 158).",

With rapid industrialization and urbanization, we witness the global warming effect, which might adversely affect the climate of the earth.

First, for cross-sectional studies utilizing social indicators, it is difficult to locate the causal relationships between changes in policies and social indicators outcomes. Because data are collected at a single time point, it would be impossible to ascertain the cause-effect relationship. Second, for longitudinal studies using macro social indicators, explanations may become post hoc in nature, if no a priori models are proposed. Third, as sample size based on social indicators at the national level is small (such as income per capita in different countries and places), multivariate statistical analyses may not necessarily meet the assumptions of multivariate statistics. Fourth, for subjective quality of life studies, it would be easier to propose models because data are usually collected at the individual level. Nevertheless, we also need good theoretical models on the determinants of subjective well-being, which are not commonly seen in the field. In short, we need more effort to formulate models that can account for changes in social indicators across time and place.",

First, application of findings to social intervention appears to be not sufficient. Brown and Corbett (1997) pointed out that social indicators have five basic policy uses where the \u201chierarchical typology of uses which incur progressively exacting demands: description, monitoring, setting goals, outcomes-based accountability and evaluation\u201d (p. iii). According to Noll (2004), \u201cwhile social indicators and social reports have successfully been used as descriptive monitoring tools, their application and use for purposes like setting goals and priorities, or the choice and evaluation of political programs still seems to be problematic and questionable\u201d (p. 176).

For example, in the area of substance abuse, rise in the substance abuse figures in the last quarter would alert the law enforcement agencies to see whether there are any changes in the supply of or demand for drugs and what additional initiatives should be stepped up. Similarly, rise in suicide rates among the elderly would prompt the Government to re-think about the elderly policies and whether adequate support is given for old people. In the area of health, statistics on infectious diseases would engender quick response from the Government to curb the problem as early as possible. In short, the relevance of social indicators related to social problems may capture greater attention of the Government than social indicators related to the general well-being of the place.

Besides, vocational uncertainties caused by the use of automation and information technology have reduced the demand for labor and employment opportunities.

As a start, it would be conceptually stimulating to examine the concept of quality of life and the role of social indicators in different disciplines so that some conceptual integration can be achieved.
