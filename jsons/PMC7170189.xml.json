In Latimer KS, Mahaffey, Prasse KW (eds): Duncan and Prasse's Veterinary Laboratory Medicine: Clinical Pathology. 4th Ed. Iowa State University Press, Ames, 2003)II.Neutropenia can be secondary to increased margination, sequestration, hemophagocytic syndrome, and immune-mediated damage to circulating neutrophils or granulo-cytic precursors in the bone marrow.III.Neutropenia can be a negative prognostic indicator associated with increased mortality; the more severe the neutropenia, the greater the risk of infection (Aroch et al., 2005).IV.Neutropenia resulting from tissue utilization in excess of marrow production can occur with severe, localized bacterial infections involving body cavities, the uterus, the respiratory or gastrointestinal (GI) tracts, or during generalized septicemia.V.Neutropenia can be associated with neutrophil toxicity.VI.Marrow suppression resulting in decreased leukocyte production may arise with the following:A.\nTotal body ionizing radiationB.Myelosuppression with chemotherapeutic agents (see Chapter 72)1.Examples include cyclophosphamide, daunomycin, dimethyl myleran, doxorubicin, 6-thioguanine, azathioprine, cisplatin, carboplatin, chlorambucil, melphalan, methotrexate, mitoxantrone, and combination therapy with vincristine and L-asparaginase.2.The marrow neutrophil proliferation-mitotic pool is most sensitive to chemotherapeutics.a.Differentiated cells in the maturation-storage pool are unaffected, so release of mature neutrophils continues for 5 to 10 days.b.A neutropenic nadir often occurs during these 5 to 10 days as a result of decreased marrow production and the short (6-hour) lifespan of the circulating neutrophil.\n3.Chemotherapy-induced thrombocytopenia occurs in 1 to 2 weeks (circulating lifespan of platelets is 10 days).4.Anemia is uncommon.\nC.Estrogen toxicosis in dogs1.Sources of estrogen exposure include the following:a.Diethylstilbestrol or estradiol cyclopentylpropionate therapy used for mismating, urinary incontinence, or infertility in females may be a cause.b.With exogenous estrogen therapy for perianal gland tumors in males, pancytopenia can occur with the neutropenia.c.Excessive endogenous estrogen with interstitial and Sertoli cell tumors (males) and granulosa cell tumors (females) can also be associated with pancytopenia.\n2.Sequential hematological abnormalities in canine estrogen toxicosis consist of the following:a.Immediate leukocytosis followed by rapid leu-kopeniab.Thrombocytosis followed by rapid thrombocytopeniac.Slow development of anemia and pancytopenia within 1 month\n\nD.Prolonged (14 to 21 days) chloramphenicol therapy in cats: leukopenia and neutrophils with D\u00f6hle bodiesE.Idiosyncratic drug reactions with either neutropenia or pancytopenia1.Antibiotics: cephalosporins, trimethoprim-sulfadiazine2.Thiacetarsamide3.Griseofulvin4.Phenobarbital5.Phenylbutazone6.Albendazole7.Captopril8.Medicated skin cream (Noxzema)\n9.Methimazole10.Trimeprazine tartrate\nF.\nInfectious causes of neutropenia or pancytopenia (see Chapters 112 and 115)1.Parvovirus infection of dogs and cats (feline panleukopenia)2.Feline leukemia virus (FeLV)3.Feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV)4.Canine ehrlichiosis\n\nVII.Neutropenia or pancytopenia from significantly decreased hematopoiesis can result from the following:A.Reduction or complete effacement of the marrow space with bone marrow necrosis (rare) or myelophthisic diseaseB.Causes of myelophthisic disease in dogs and cats1.Myelofibrosis (see Chapter 66)2.Osteopetrosis: rare3.Myeloproliferative diseases or myelodysplasia (see Chapter 66)4.Multicentric lymphoma (lymphosarcoma [LSA]) (see Chapter 69)5.Disseminated granulomatous disease (e.g., systemic mycoses)6.Metastatic neoplasia\n\nVIII.Neutrophils shift rapidly from the circulating to marginated pool, especially during episodes of anaphylaxis or endotoxemia in dogs (pseudoneutropenia).IX.Hemophagocytic syndrome is a rare event.A.Hematology findings consist of cytopenias involving two or more of the hematologic cell lines and circulating fragments of erythrocytes.B.Bone marrow aspirate reveals increased numbers of macrophages containing phagocytized hematopoietic precursors, and predominantly erythroid precursors, with fewer neutrophils and platelets.\nX.Uncommon causes of neutropenia include the following:A.Immune-mediated neutropenia can be idiopathic, drug-related, or associated with other immune-mediated diseases (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus).1.Presumptive diagnosis can be made with clinical response to immunosuppressive doses of corticosteroids and with termination of therapy in cases of drug-related neutropenia.2.Definitive diagnosis requires demonstration of antineutrophil antibodies, which is difficult owing to fragility of the neutrophils and potential release of intracellular enzymes.\nB.Canine cyclic hematopoiesis, a genetic disorder specific for gray-coated collies, is characterized by continuous, abnormal 2- to 4-day cycles of neutropenia.1.Affected dogs exhibit recurrent infections by 8 weeks of age.2.Death usually occurs by approximately 3 years of age from septicemia or systemic amyloidosis.\nC.Inherited vitamin B12 (cobalamin) malabsorption in giant schnauzers results in failure to express the necessary receptor for normal intestinal cobalamin absorption.1.Cobalamin deficiency induces maturation abnormalities in hematopoietic precursors.2.Characteristic findings consist of neutropenia, neutrophil hypersegmentation, nonregenerative anemia, nucleated red blood cells (nRBCs) with nuclear:cystoplasmic asynchrony, thrombocytosis, and rare giant platelets.\n\n\n",
