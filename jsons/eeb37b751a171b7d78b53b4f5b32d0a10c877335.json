            "text": "Telehealth is broadly defined as \"the use of electronic information and communications technologies to provide and support health care when distance separates participants,\" 1 where the \"technologies include videoconferencing, the internet, store-and-forward imaging, streaming media, and terrestrial and wireless communications.\" 2 Physician access to telehealth had increased in the years prior to the outbreak of COVID-19 in March 2020, and the growth of telehealth was largely attributed to factors such as rapid advancements in technology and transformations in the organization and delivery of health care. [3] [4] [5] Nearly two-thirds of hospitals reported having a computerized telehealth system in 2016, up from 55% only two years earlier, and the American Telemedicine Association estimated that around 15 million patients received some care via telehealth annually. [6] [7] [8] The growing availability of telehealth has brought the potential to increase patient access to care, improve health outcomes, and reduce costs. 4, [9] [10] [11] The potential for telehealth to expand patient access to medical care is strongest in rural regions or other areas that face provider shortages. 5, 12 For pediatricians, there are a broad range of possible applications of telehealth including quality control, education, practice, consultation, and research. 13 Correspondingly, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), in its 2015 policy statement on telehealth, proposed that telehealth could increase access to high-quality pediatric care and recommended that pediatricians work to reduce barriers to providing telehealth to their patients. 12 Even as the infrastructure and technology required to provide patient care via telehealth has expanded in recent years, only a few studies have provided national estimates of the prevalence of telehealth use among physicians. Estimates from these available studies indicate that telehealth usage rates among physicians remained low. Data from the 2016 Physician Practice Benchmark Survey of the American Medical Association estimated that 15% of all physicians worked in practices that used telemedicine for some kind of patient interaction, and that percentage was estimated at 12% for pediatricians; overall, this survey found that physicians in solo practices were least likely to report telehealth use relative to those who reported working in group practices or as hospital employees. 14 Similarly, a 2014 survey by the American Academy of Family Physicians found that 15% of family physician respondents reported using telehealth services in the past 12 months, and barriers to using telehealth included lack of training, lack of reimbursement, cost of equipment, and potential liability issues. 15 Another study measuring barriers to telehealth adoption in pediatrics identified reimbursement as the greatest barrier, followed by time investment, provider interest, and state regulations. 16 This manuscript was written prior to the global outbreak of COVID-19, which has rapidly and dramatically altered the landscape for use of telehealth in the United States. 17 With the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been a quick rise in telehealth use among physicians, and forecasts for the expected number of telehealth visits in 2020 were revised sharply upwards. [18] [19] [20] [21] A March 2020 survey of primary care providers found that while physicians were using more telehealth and that patients were accepting of telehealth visits, concerns remained regarding payment for these services. 22 The societal and regulatory changes that have led to a massive surge in telehealth use are potentially short-lived, although it is also possible that the response to the pandemic will permanently alter how health care is delivered in the US going forward.",

To capture telehealth usage, the survey asked respondents, \"During the past 12 months have you A) used telehealth or B) referred any of your patients for a telehealth consult?\" (response options for both items A and B included \"yes\" and \"no\"). We combined these two utilization measures into one variable that is coded \"1\" if the respondent reported any telehealth in the past 12 months, and \"0\" otherwise; this \"any telehealth\" variable is our primary outcome measure and the dependent variable in our multivariable logistic regression analysis.",

Our finding here is consistent with previous estimates of the prevalence of telehealth use among physicians in general. 14, 15 In our survey, pediatricians in rural areas, pediatricians in the West region of the US, pediatricians in medical school or hospital settings, and pediatric subspecialists were the most likely to report having used telehealth. These findings also reflected previous research that has found that subspecialists and providers in rural areas are more likely to use telehealth. 9, 13 Taken together, these results suggest that while overall use of telehealth by pediatricians was limited, it may play an important role in better connecting patients in underserved, rural areas to pediatric care. 5 The survey results on perceived barriers provided some insight into the overall low rates of telehealth use, as our analysis found that a majority of respondents indicated that financial issues are major barriers to incorporating telehealth into their practice. Nearly 6 out of 10 respondents identified \"insufficient payment for telehealth services\" and \"inability to bill for services rendered\" as barriers, respectively. These results are unsurprising, given that payment and reimbursement policies for telehealth remain fragmented across states, and this inconsistency across geography and payers was identified by the US Department of Health and Human Services as a key policy challenge for expansion of telehealth. 5, 24 Pediatrics is unique in this regard in that, in contrast to adult populations like those covered by Medicare and the Veteran's Administration, there are no federal programs providing uniform payment coverage for telehealth services for pediatrics. Reliance on Medicaid and private payers increases the stateby-state variability of coverage and limits the ability to address payment issues for pediatric telehealth at the federal level. However, the trend in telehealth policy, even prior to COVID-19, is that states and private payers are increasingly incorporating payment for telehealth services, which would create a more favorable payment environment for telehealth in the future. 24, 25 Relatedly, over half of respondents noted the \"cost of purchasing/maintaining equipment/services\" as a barrier, but continued advancements in telehealth technology should continue to drive down the material costs associated telehealth. 4, 25 Collectively, these results on barrierscoupled with our finding that a majority of non-users would consider using telehealth if they were paid for the visits or consultssuggest that financial issues are at the forefront of physicians' decision-making process around adopting telehealth.",

Specifically, we found that as the number of perceived barriers increased, the likelihood of having used telehealth decreased significantly. For example, among those who reported no barriers, 34% reported having used telehealth, but this decreased to 13% among those who reported 4-6 barriers. This relationship provides evidence that in order to encourage pediatricians to incorporate telehealth, the full range of potential financial, quality, implementation, administrative, and technical barriers should be addressed and remedied.",

            "text": "Dramatically increased telehealth use has played a critical role in the response to the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States, allowing some patients access to care while avoiding in-person visits to physicians' offices and hospitals. 18 In March 2020, the American Academy of Pediatrics released guidance for pediatricians related to telehealth policy, noting that it was \"working at all levels to strongly advocate for changes that will eliminate burdens on pediatricians seeking to begin or expand use of telehealth care.\" 17 The federal government, in addition to many state governments, has taken temporary actions to broaden access to telehealth, including relaxing regulations, waiving some state licensure requirements, and expanding Medicare, Medicaid, and Children's Health Insurance Programs eligibility for telehealth payment. 20, [27] [28] [29] [30] It is unclear if the elevated levels of telehealth use will persist, particularly if the temporary government measures related to payment are not extended once the COVID-19 crisis subsides. While the survey data analyzed here were collected well before the outbreak, financial barriers were the top reported barriers to telehealth adoption, indicating that extending actions taken to reduce barriers to payment could encourage more pediatricians to continue to incorporate telehealth into their practice. Clinicians report mixed reviews of the transformation to virtual care during the COVID-19 pandemic; an April 2020 survey of primary care physicians found more telehealth use but also frustrations with implementation (including billing problems and patients' lack of access to technology). 31 Thus, while telehealth is being adopted by many medical providers to provide patient care during the response to COVID-19, the extent to which barriers to successful implementation can be identified and remedied will likely play a large role in determining if gains in telehealth use will continue post-pandemic.",

Most respondents reported that financial concerns are a major barrier to incorporating telehealth into their practice, and the perception of more barriers was independently associated with a lower likelihood of having any telehealth experience in the past year. Among non-users, however, most reported that they would use telehealth if financial barriers were resolved. Given that multiple barriers to telehealth incorporation remain across a variety of domains, reducing those impediments will be instrumental in promoting future telehealth adoption among pediatricians. Future surveys will be useful to help track adoption rates, examine if pediatricians continue to use telehealth once the COVID-19 crisis has passed, and evaluate the persistence of barriers to telehealth use by pediatricians. .0001 Note: Dependent variable is any telehealth use in past 12 months (1=yes, 0=no); n=550 ; * p<.05; ** p<.01; *** p<.001 a.
