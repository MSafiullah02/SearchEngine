            "text": "The COVID-19 contagion has developed at an alarming rate in the US and as of April 24, 2020, tens of thousands of people have already died from the disease. In the event of an outbreak like such, forecasting the extent of the mortality that will occur is crucial to aid the implementation of effective interventions. Mortality depends on two factors: the case fatality rate and the case incidence. We combine a cohort-based model that determines case fatality rates along with a modified logistic model that evaluates the case incidence to determine the number of deaths in all the US states over time; the model is also able to include the impact of interventions. Both models yield exceptional goodness-of-fit. The model predicted a range of death outcomes (79k to 246k) all of which are considerably greater than the figures presented in mainstream media. This model can be used more effectively than current models to estimate the number of deaths during an outbreak, allowing for better planning.",

Subsequently, the outbreak has spread to 212 [2] 4 countries, including the United States, where the first case of COVID-19 was detected 5 in Washington state on January 20, 2020 [3] . As of April 24, 2020, the U.S has 6 reported 830053 cases and 42311 deaths [4] . 7 As the pandemic progresses, determining its prognosis is essential to inform the 8 adoption of adequate mitigation efforts. Many have attempted to forecast the trajectory 9 of the epidemic in the United States, and at the forefront is the White House 11 Dr. Fauci suggested that the US would likely face 100,000 to 200,000 deaths, with 12 millions of cases [7] . However, on April 9 he said the estimate had been revised down 13 to 60,000 [8] . Moreover, a model by the University of Washington, closely followed by 14 the White House, projects 67,000 deaths as of April 24, 2020 [9] , in line with Dr. 15 Fauci's statement [8] . 16 It is well-known that there is a wide variance in the sizes of outbreaks between states 17 as well as the resulting incidence of deaths. The primary reason for the variance is the 18 uncertainty in the prediction of infections and the fatality rate of infected individuals. improved models to determine both the cumulative case incidence and the case fatality 21 rate. We calculated the case fatality rate (CFR) for each state using a cohort-based 22 approach, which has demonstrated greater accuracy than traditional methods [10] . 23 Additionally, the number of cumulative cases in each state is predicted using a modified 24 logistic model. Combining the two, we are able to forecast the number of cumulative 25 deaths by state. Additionally, we analyze the drivers of deaths and discuss implications 26 on policy formation. 27 ",

            "text": "There are three principal measures of disease lethality: the case fatality rate (CFR), 41 infection fatality rate (IFR) and mortality rate (MR). The mortality rate is represented 42 by the proportion of cumulative deaths to the total at-risk population. This is 43 ultimately indicative of the probability of any individual's mortality among the total 44 population. The CFR uses the same numerator (cumulative deaths) but instead divides 45 it by the number of cumulative confirmed cases. The case fatality [14] rate is the 46 proportion of individuals who die from a disease among all individuals diagnosed with 47 the disease within a specified timeframe [15] . That is, it reveals the percentage of 48 individuals that die among all individuals who test positive for the disease. The IFR is 49 similar to the CFR, except it represents the ratio of deaths to the total number of 50 people who are infected; it accounts for all infected individuals regardless of whether 51 their disease is reported or not. In an ideal scenario, where zero individuals with 52 COVID-19 went unnoticed, and surveillance was faultless, the IFR and CFR would be 53 equivalent. However, this is not truly plausible; testing is limited, asymptomatic 54 infections commonly are not surveilled, and not all instances of the disease are 55 accounted for in reality. As a result, the CFR that we calculate will be much higher 56 than the IFR and the mortality rate.",

However, it is difficult to find conclusive 220 evidence that any of these factors are directly accountable for the outbreak. It is very 221 likely that luck played a large role in determining where clusters appeared. There is 222 ample evidence that super-spreading events, or SSE's, can cause sizable outbreaks [25] . 223 For instance, officials in New York stated that as many as fifty infections could be 224 traced back to a single man in Westchester County [26] . 225 We propose two principal explanations for the discrepancy between the death tolls 226 forecasted by the University of Washington model and that of our model: the 227 differences in both the procedure for calculating CFR and the procedure for calculating 228 mortality. Our cohort-based method to determining CFR's predicts case fatality rates 229 more accurately at every stage of the outbreak than other models because it explicitly 230 accounts for the onset-to-death interval.
