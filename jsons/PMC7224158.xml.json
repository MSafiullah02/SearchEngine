They are widely used in textile industry and because of their chemical complexity and low biodegradability; the wastewater treatment is very demanding. Different methods are applied to remove these organic compounds from the water sources: biological, physicochemical (adsorption, coagulation/flocculation, reverse osmosis) or chemical treatments (chlorination and ozonation). However, these methods have certain limitations. The biological treatments are not effective in the case of stable and resistant azo dyes. Only few unstable azo dyes can be degraded under aerobic conditions. On the other hand, anaerobic degradation causes aromatic amines generation which are toxic and carcinogenic [7]. The physicochemical treatments often cause formation of secondary pollution, generating large amounts of sludge and transferring pollutants from water to solid phase. Therefore, incomplete degradation and necessity for additional operations including final degradation of the waste and adsorbent regeneration limit the application of these treatments [8]. Chemical treatments like chlorination can result in complete decolourisation of dyes, but chlorinated organic by-products are very hazardous [9]. Ozone oxidizes dyes as well, but its extreme oxidizing effects can harm the atmosphere. Thus, ozonation system must include a control unit which prevents excessive use of chemicals [10].",

Plasma systems can be generally divided into thermal or non\u2013thermal plasma. Thermal plasma typically needs more power than non\u2013thermal and creates high flux of heat, which can be used for degradation of very resistant organic molecules. In the case of non\u2013thermal plasma, electrons are at temperatures as high as 11,000 K, and are colliding with gas molecules at temperatures as low as the room temperature, promoting the generation of chemically active species [18].",

These systems have strong oxidizing ability and include simple feed conditions such as temperature and atmospheric pressure. During the treatment, various complex chemical reactions (collision, addition, dissociation and transformation reactions) can be initiated in the polluted solution [26]. Among above mentioned types of non-thermal plasma devices, plasma needle may be easily operated under atmospheric pressure and room temperature and do not require expensive vacuum systems. Its simple configuration provides very easy to work and it can be applied to a wide range of vessels for treatment. Plasma needle is non-aggressive oxidation method which produces chemically active species at low gas temperature, thus meets all the necessary conditions for the treatment of organic materials, living tissues (wound sterilization, cancer treatment and other biomedical applications) and delicate materials which are unable to withstand vacuum or are thermally sensitive (heat- sensitive polymers, foodstuffs).",

We have developed plasma needle setup to study the effects of flow rate, feed gas composition (Ar and Ar/O2 mixture), and the eventual UV influence on the oxidation process.

C0 and Ct represent the initial dye concentration and the dye concentration at reaction time t. The RO 16 concentration of each treated sample was determined using a calibration curve which is previously established with prepared standards and theirs related absorbances. It can be observed that RO 16 decolourisation was faster for the increased flow rate of Ar (4 slm) and almost total decolourisation was achieved after 90 min. It is obvious that generation of radicals in plasma depends on gas flow rate. The higher is the flow rate, the faster is the decolourisation. However, the efficiency of radicals generation and plasma chemistry can be also tailored by changing the feed gas composition. For that purpose, in Fig. 4 is presented the kinetics of RO 16 decolourisation when 10% O2 was introduced into Ar flow rate of 1 slm.",

            "text": "The introduction of O2 into the feed gas evidently influenced the oxidation process kinetics. The better efficiency of the RO 16 oxidation with the addition of O2 can be a consequence of at least two reasons. The most apparent reason is that higher amount of active species, like OH\u00b7, can be formed when O2 is introduced in Ar because of the lower energy of the first ionization of O2 (12.1 eV) compared to Ar (15.8 eV). In their work, Gumuchian et al. [24] measured amount of OH\u00b7 in different compositions of feed gases and concluded that in Ar/O2 feed gas mixture, the concentration of OH\u00b7 was the highest [24]. Beside this, atomic oxygen can react directly with organic pollutants, and together with O2 can produce very reactive ozone (Eq. 6). Nevertheless, in the paper of Miyazaki et al. [54] it was shown that very small amount of ozone was produced if the Ar concentration in Ar/O2 feed gas mixture is equal or higher than 80%. Since in our experiments 90% of Ar, was used, we suppose that ozone contribution in these experiments is not of great importance. Evidently, the presence of O2 in the feed gas significantly improves the oxidation potentials of plasma needle, presumably due to the formation of more reactive species (Eqs. 2, 15\u201316).",

In the presence of H2O and O2 molecules, highly reactive radicals such as OH\u00b7, O2\u00b7\u2012 and HO2\u00b7, generated through processes of photodegradation, substantially contribute to the degradation of organic molecules/pollutants. However, the most important contribution and benefits among these processes arise from reactions accompanying generation of hydroxyl radicals. These radicals are considered as very strong and nonselective oxidizing species [59, 60]. The presence of functional groups at the surface of TiO2 affects the formation of hydroxyl radicals. Infrared spectroscopy is used to analyse the surface of TiO2. The IR spectrum of TiO2 nanopowder is presented in Fig. 8a in the range from 500 to 4000 cm\u22121. The main bands of O\u2012H groups and H2O are denoted with arrows. Namely, a wide band around ~ 3400 cm\u22121, corresponds to stretching vibration of the O\u2012H bond involved in hydrogen bonding O\u2012H\u22efO, whereas the band around ~ 1600 cm\u22121 can be ascribed to the bending mode of the water molecules H\u2012O\u2012H.",

This acid reacts with OH\u00b7 radicals, generated at the water/TiO2 interface, forming a highly fluorescent product: 2-hydroxyterephthalic acid (TA-OH), with intensive peak at about 425 nm [61]. Since PL peak intensity is proportional to the amount of generated OH\u00b7 radicals, by monitoring the changes in the intensity of 425 nm peak the hydroxyl radicals could be detected indirectly. From the Fig. 8b, it can be observed that the intensity of 425 nm peak increases in time, meaning that the concentration of hydroxyl radicals also increases [61, 62]. The spectrum labelled as \"0 min\" represents the pure TA solution recorded prior the UV irradiation source. These results clearly demonstrated that with increasing illumination time the increasing amount of OH\u00b7 radicals are formed at TiO2/water interface, responsible for dye degradation.",

Namely, after 15 min more than 40% of dye was degraded under the PC treatment, whereas under PT the photodegradation of dye reached only15%. It is also evident that the time for complete decolourisation reduced from 150 to 120 min. Similar effect was observed with increased feed gas flow rate (4 slm) when the time for complete RO 16 decolourisation was shortened from 90 min (PT) to 60 min (PC).
