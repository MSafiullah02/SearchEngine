            "text": "Maintainability is one of the most important features of software systems [10]. Though, defining maintainability has been a topic of interest for many researchers over decades. A software application might fulfils all the traditional requirements and yet be of little use if the cost of maintaining it is too high. For such reason, maintainability has been considered one of the requirements that must be imposed to software products [3]. Several authors have investigated the models and metrics used for the best estimation of maintainability also known as prediction or software maintainability prediction models. Traditional models based on their accuracy of prediction have been represented by Shafiabady et al. [22]. Moreover, an analysis of the evolution of software maintenance models over the four past decades has been introduced by Lenarduzzi et al. [14]. Defining the right tools on code analysis to perform research studies on software maintenance prediction is also a crucial aspect and has received much attention in the last few years [18]. Recent papers [2, 5, 11, 15, 19] have identified tools that are available and can be used to apply maintenance models published in the studies in this area.",

            "text": "During the years, several models have been proposed for measuring the maintainability of software. A considerable amount of studies have employed different models and techniques for predicting software maintenance using basic metrics and models: McCall\u2019s model in 1976 [20], Barry Boehm\u2019s quality model presented in 1978 [1], Sneed-Mercy Model in 1985 [23], Li-Henry Model in 1993 [16], Marcela Genero Model in 2004 [8]. Later, slightly different techniques were used from simple statistical models such as regression [25] to machine learning [7, 24], and deep learning [9, 13]. To predict maintainability of software, different metrics have been proposed in literature. Among the large variety of metrics, the most used ones are the OO metrics depth of the inheritance tree (DIT), response for a class (RFC), number of children (NOC), coupling between objects (CBO), lack of cohesion of methods (LCOM), and weighted method per class (WMC) [4]. Other metrics are popular, such as: number of methods (NOM), lines of code (LOC), number of semicolons in a class (SIZE1), number of properties (SIZE2), and CHANGE metrics as dependent variable to predict software maintainability by calculating the changed number of lines in the class during maintenance process [16]. Investigating different primary studies and secondary studies from the literature, we have found out that even if there are a number of different methods to predict maintainability, almost all the studies built their models from scratch and do not extend existing ones.",

In particular, it measures the independent path through a source code as a proxy of its complexity. The higher the value, the more complex is the system and this fact results in difficulty to maintain the code. We have measured the average of CC which is stated by McCabe to be cyclomatic complexity per function in a file and is calculated as the sum of the CC of all function definitions, divided by the number of function definitions in the file.Lines of code (LOC): it is used to measure the size of a software by counting the number of lines included in a program. There are multiple ways to count the lines of code but in this work we focus on the simplest definition that consider the physical lines of code of the source files.Maintainability index (MI): it is based on Halstead Volume (HV) metric, the cyclomatic complexity (CC) metric, and the average number of lines per code per module (LOC) metric. The higher this value, the more maintainable the software results [21]. If MI of software increases it means that the software can be maintained easily, otherwise if it decreases the degree of difficulty to maintain the software is high [12]. Values of MI index as follows:MI < 65: difficult to maintainMI 65\u201385: maintainableMI > 85: good maintainability\n\n",

It is stated that the reason that MI formula with comments does exist is because the formula to find comments is not standardized and comments are considered to be subjective from developer to developer and do vary from project to project. In such cases it is recommended to use the MI without comments as reported from official source development of the JHawk tool. However, we think that comments are an important part of the source code, therefore we considered them in our study.",

We are interested to understand the strength of such correlation. To measure the strength of relationship in our data variables we use Spearman rank correlation for the reason that it does not assume any linear relation between variables and it does not assume any specific distribution of data.
