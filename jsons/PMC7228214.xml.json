The analysis displayed that most pp1ab proteins have not changed; only six amino acid changes were detected (Table S2). We consider an amino acid change if two or more sequences have the same mutation. One of these mutations (L3606F), placed in the position 37 of nsp6 protein (L37F), is shared by ten sequences from viruses isolated in China, USA, France, Hong Kong, Italy, and Singapore (Table S2). Coronavirus nsp6 is a transmembrane protein that is associated with nsp3 and nsp4 proteins to form the organelle\u2010like replicative structures (double\u2010membrane vesicles).\n9\n Prediction of transmembrane helices (TMHs) segments in nsp6 protein showed that L37F does not alter the secondary structure of the adjacent transmembrane domains (Figure S1). In fact, the mutation L37F is predicted to be outside of the membrane as part of an unstructured coil segment (32SLFFFL/FYEN) that connects the first (12\u201031 residues) and the second (41\u201060 residues) TMHs (Figure S1). Strikingly, the position 37 of nsp6 protein is a Val residue that is conserved in all analyzed sarbecoviruses (Data S1), except in SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 (Leu). So the mutation of the aliphatic Leu residue for the aromatic Phe residue in this conserved position probably has functional implications; although Leu and Phe are both hydrophobic residues, the Phe residue could also perform cation\u2010\u03c0 interactions that could affect the protein\u2010protein interactions in the L37F mutant. The structural impact of this mutation can not be determined since experimental data in the Protein Data Bank are not available for homology modeling of nsp6 using a single or multiple templates (eg, SWISS\u2010MODEL server, Phyre2, etc.).",

We found the same results when we compared the pp1ab of members of the genus Betacoronavirus (Table S3; Data S1).

Phylogenetic analysis based on genome sequence showed that both viruses collected from pangolins are clustered in the clade 2 (Figure 2). The pairwise comparison of pp1ab protein showed that the protein of Pangolin\u2010BetaCoV\u2010Guandong\u20102019 is 94% identical to those of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 while the pp1ab of Pangolin\u2010BetaCoV\u2010Guangxi\u20102017 has an identity of 92%. Since both pangolin viruses are grouped in clade 2 and their pp1ab proteins are identical to those of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102, we analyzed the alignment of its pp1ab protein to determine if the AS\u2010SCoV2 is present (Figure 1). The homologous region of AS\u2010SCoV2 pp1ab of Pangolin\u2010BetaCoV\u2010Guandong\u20102019 has 34 aa that showed an identity of 35%, whereas the homologous region of AS\u2010SCoV2 in Pangolin\u2010BetaCoV\u2010Guangxi\u20102017 have 36 aa which are completely different from those of sarbecoviruses (Figure 1). These findings suggest that the pp1ab of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 is more closely related to pp1ab of Bat\u2010SL\u2010CoV\u2010RaTG13 than to pp1ab of coronaviruses isolated from Chinese pangolins. Since the region that encodes the pp1ab protein represents about 71% of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 genome, we suggest that it is less likely that the novel human coronavirus has been arising directly from the viruses isolated from pangolins.",
