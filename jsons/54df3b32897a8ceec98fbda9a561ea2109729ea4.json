Nevertheless, compared with X-ray screening, which has normally been recommended, endoscopic screening is better at fi nding small lesions, fi at finding cancer at its earlier stages, making it more easily and economically treat-fi able, and allows on-the-spot biopsies. Opportunistic, individually initiated screening by endoscopy is more and more in demand. Therefore, its excellent efficacy needs to fi be matched by improved toleration, improved safety, and improved manpower effi-fi ciency so that it can be standardized and utilized to its full diagnostic, therapeutic, and quality-of-life potential.",

However, there are some problems which still have to be solved, such as toleration, safety, and manpower, before mass screening by endoscopy can ever be considered.

On the other hand, the detection rate by X-ray screening was 0.094% and its ratio of early cancer was 68.4%. The ratio of early cancer was the same, but when the overall cancer detection rate was found to be 0.14% in subsequent tests, the detection rate by endoscopy was shown to be 3-4 times that by X-ray, which proves that endoscopy is very precise [1] ( Table 2 ). An endoscopy examination used to be the second test to check the details of a lesion after X-ray detection and to make a fi nal diagnosis, but based on nationwide endos-fi copy screening research, endoscopy is now known to be the most precise method of checking the gastrointestinal tract.",
