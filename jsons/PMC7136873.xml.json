Previous studies have focused on the underlying diseases (hypertension, diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases) of the patients who have died (1,5). Surprisingly, little attention has been paid to patients without underlying diseases who have died.",

The diameter of the largest lesion was 6.7 cm. Approximately 4.3% of his lung volume was involved. One week later, he was admitted to the hospital for continued fatigue, fever, and hemoptysis. His blood oxygen saturation was 62%, and he received bedside endotracheal intubation. His condition quickly worsened with a procalcitonin level of 0.59 ng/ml, plasma cytokines IL6 of 340.40 pg/ml, and lactate dehydrogenase of 1196 U/L.

Extensive GGOs and pulmonary consolidation on chest CT suggested acute respiratory distress syndrome and massive lung infections with alveolar damage. In the second patient, the CT scan and laboratory studies initially showed evidence of only mild disease. However, the disease developed rapidly. Excessive immune responses led to severe pulmonary damage, potential multiple organ dysfunction syndrome, and eventual death. Based on these observations, if the chest CT suggests acute respiratory distress syndrome, the prognosis is guarded. In contrast, if the chest CT shows only minor pulmonary inflammation, laboratory results (eg, proinflammatory cytokines) should be carefully monitored.",
