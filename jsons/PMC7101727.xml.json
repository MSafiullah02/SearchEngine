            "text": "Allogeneic stem cell transplantation (alloSCT) has made a variety of otherwise infaust diseases curable (Forman et al. 1999). The prognosis after alloSCT has improved substantially over the last decades and the development of the \u2018reduced-intense-conditioning\u2019 (RIC) or \u2018non-myeloablative conditioning\u2019 therapy protocols allows successful transplantation of elderly or heavily pre-treated patients (Niederwieser et al. 2003). In addition, introduction of a variety of drugs into supportive therapy led to a further improvement of prognosis. This includes antimycotic and antiviral therapy (Marr et al. 2002; Mora-Duarte et al. 2002; Yahav et al. 2009). In addition, improvement of molecular diagnostic facilitates early detection of rare or otherwise difficult to diagnose infections (Busemann et al. 2012). The identification of an appropriate stem cell donor is no problem in Europe since large registries have been established. The long-term outcome after alloSCT depends on a variety of factors such as underlying disease, donor\u2019s HLA-match, patient\u2019s age and performance and complications, e.g. manifestation of acute or chronic Graft-versus-Host disease (GvHD). Generally, there is a broad range of overall survival from >80% down to <10%. In general, for all patients, long-term survival after alloSCT has been reported for less than 50% (Gooley et al. 2010). Vice versa, from this fact, it can be clearly deduced that a significant proportion of the other half of all alloSCT patients might benefit from appropriate palliative care measures during their end of life period.",

            "text": "The most important element in the concept of alloSCT is a curative treatment approach under acceptance of considerable to life-threatening side effects and a substantially lowered quality of life for a limited period. In contrast to the common patients of standard intensive care units, patients undergoing an allogeneic transplantation start usually in a relative good healthy condition. The following treatment, however, is extremely physical and mental demanding, and associated with a considerable therapy related morbidity and mortality. In contrast, palliative care wants to control the symptoms of the illness and to preserve the best quality of life for the remaining lifetime of the patient (Joske and McGrath 2007). Both approaches seem to be very controversial. The staff of each discipline, SCT and palliative care, may not have the best opinion about the other group (Chung et al. 2009). However, even in the field of alloSCT, the symptom control has an irreplaceable role. Myeloablative conditioning may lead to a mucositis requiring a substantial analgesic therapy, graft-versus host disease can induce severe diarrhoea and damages of the integument (Deeg 2007). Nausea and vomiting under conditioning may be very intensive and need special prophylactic measures and a management by a dedicated team of experts (Bearman et al. 1989). In conclusion, the concepts of alloSCT and palliative care are not as controversial as it may seem at a first and unreflected view.",

Even for the staff of the transplant program, it might be difficult to recognise this point of no return. Physicians, nurses and other professionals even have to abandon the curative concept and to accept that the patient will die from his disease or from related complications. In contrast to oncologists, taking care of patients suffering from solid tumours, there are publications suggesting that haematologists hesitate to switch the therapy goal to symptom control and to consult the palliative care team (Lafond et al. 2015; LeBlanc et al. 2015). To address the important question what means end of life care in alloSCT patients, we have retrospectively analysed the charts of 123 patients who have died after alloSCT in our unit.",

Two patients were allografted for solid tumours or other diagnoses, respectively. The median pre-treatment consisted of 5 (range 0\u201327) cycles of chemotherapy and the median Sorror-score was 3 (range 0\u20139), indicating a high-risk situation for at least 50% of patients (Table 1) (Sorror 2009; Sp\u00e4th et al. 2014).\n",

Patients with disseminated breast cancer or colorectal cancer, for instance, have a life expectancy of years under modern systemic therapy of their disease (Sievers et al. 2016; Zeichner et al. 2016).

Patients are mainly at home. Despite the time interval from diagnosis to death in our investigation with a median 19.1 (4.5\u2013208.3) months differs not necessarily from that of patients suffering from metastatic carcinomas, the therapy objective remains clearly curative until the failure of allogeneic transplantation becomes evident.",

The use of laxatives increased only slightly to 10.6% at the last assessment. This is in accordance with the observation that obstipation is no major problem after SCT. In addition, the consumption of opioids seems to be generally lower after SCT than in advanced solid tumours, despite even after alloSCT an increase of use during clinical course was recognised as described for patients with solid tumours (Gagnon et al. 2015).",

The shift is very abrupt and the course is remarkably shorter than in patients with solid tumours. A proportion of SCT-patients has no opportunity to be discharged from hospital and to spend time in their familiar surrounding at home before death. In consequence, the psychosocial and spiritual needs of SCT-patients may be different from those of classical palliative care patients (Roeland et al. 2010). The authors suggest the intensification of cooperation between transplant and palliative care team and related professional groups to allow a timely interdisciplinary reaction, if a patient cannot be cured anymore.",
