Ingestion of sporulated Eimeria oocysts from the environment leads to the development of enteric disease. Each of the seven species of Eimeria that cause disease in chickens preferentially infects different regions of the intestinal tract and can result in lesions of varying severity, including thickening of the intestinal wall, petechial hemorrhages, and necrosis, to name a few (Conway and McKenzie, 2008a). Worldwide, the costs arising from coccidia challenge, treatment, and control are estimated to total at least 3 billion US dollars annually (Williams, 1999; Alonso, 2014; Blake and Tomley, 2014). Not only is coccidia infection alone an expensive burden for the poultry industry, but infection with Eimeria maxima is known to be a predisposing factor for necrotic enteritis (NE) caused by Clostridium perfringens infection (Timbermont et al., 2011). Lesions resulting from the subclinical form of NE cause reduced nutrient absorption and feed conversion, and cost producers $6 billion in 2015 (Wade and Keyburn, 2015).",

            "text": "\nEimeria infection occurs when a susceptible chicken ingests a sporulated oocyst from the environment (Chapman, 2003; Shirley et al., 2005; Conway and McKenzie, 2008a; Chapman et al., 2013; Swayne et al., 2013; Blake and Tomley, 2014). For every oocyst ingested, it is estimated that several hundred thousand may be produced, which are then available for ingestion and infection of other chickens in the poultry house (Sharman et al., 2010). Historically, coccidiosis has been treated via the use of anticoccidials, including ionophores and chemicals. Although anticoccidial treatments are effective in protecting against disease outbreaks, development of drug resistance, current external pressures on the industry, and regulatory changes have producers turning towards vaccination (Shirley et al., 2007; Newman, 2012; Blake and Tomley, 2014; Chapman, 2014). Coccidia vaccines contain live, sporulated oocysts of varying mixtures and concentrations of Eimeria species, and they are given in a low dose to initiate an immunologic response in the bird (Danforth, 1998; Williams, 2002; Tewari and Maharana, 2011). Unlike other coccidian parasites, infection with Eimeria is self-limiting, as oocysts produced in the intestine are not capable of auto-infection of the host chicken and must be excreted and re-ingested for further infection (Cowper et al., 2012; Wilhelm and Yarovinsky, 2014). The immune response to Eimeria infection is species specific and requires multiple exposures to oocysts of each Eimeria sp. to achieve sufficient protective immunity (Rose and Hesketh, 1979). Thus, vaccine companies rely on the concept of \u201cvaccine oocyst cycling\u201d in the litter to gain protective immunity in a poultry flock (Joyner and Norton, 1973).",

Vaccine coverage is essential, as chicks that do not ingest oocysts at day of hatch will later be exposed to oocysts in the litter, and this higher dose of oocysts can result in clinical infection and gut lesions. Gel vaccination technology for coccidia has been posited as an alternative to spray vaccination. Gel beads containing Eimeria oocysts have been shown to be protective when delivered in the feed (Danforth et al., 1997; Jenkins et al., 2012; Jenkins et al., 2013). Now, coccidia vaccines in gel diluents are being applied to day-old chicks at the hatchery with a gel applicator bar (Ritzi et al., 2016). There are multiple manufacturers of gel diluents as well as multiple viscosities of individual gel products. Some gels are only slightly more viscous than water, but create more stable droplets on the chicks when applied. Other gels are extremely viscous and create very defined and gelatinous drops on chicks. The higher viscosity of gel diluents compared to water spray may increase the available vaccine for ingestion.",

The birds vaccinated by gavage were shedding higher numbers of total and E. maxima oocysts than any of the experimentally vaccinated groups in the first cycle. When vaccinating by oral gavage, the oocyst suspension is deposited directly into the crop, resulting in more efficient delivery of the oocysts to the intestinal tract. This controlled vaccination method also produced the least variation of total oocyst shedding numbers in the first cycle, as all chickens vaccinated were ensured to receive a proper vaccine dose. The spray, MV gel, and LV gel methods require chicks to actively ingest oocysts both from preening and from pecking in the hatchery basket, resulting in a potential loss of vaccine. Both gel vaccines produced less variation in oocyst shedding during the first cycle compared to the variation seen in the spray vaccinated group, perhaps indicating that the gel beads provide a more stable vehicle for vaccine delivery than a liquid spray. Furthermore, the MV gel vaccinated chickens shed numerically higher total and E. maxima oocysts in the feces than the spray and LV gel groups in the first cycle, which is consistent with the higher doses of oocysts for that application method.",

In addition, the spray, gavage, and less viscous gel groups all had lower variation within the groups for oocyst shedding in the second cycle, and all coefficient of variation values for those groups were very similar. This decrease in variation compared to the first cycle of oocyst shedding may be attributed to the exposure of chickens that did not receive vaccine to the sporulated oocysts in the litter from the first cycle of shedding, leading to more consistent infection and shedding of all birds within the groups. However, the birds vaccinated by the more viscous gel method were shedding significantly lower numbers of total oocysts than the other vaccinated groups, although 100% of the birds in that group were shedding oocysts at all time points except for day 12. Although the temperature of each colony room that each group was held in remained consistent, it is possible that there was reduced humidity in the more viscous gel room, leading to lower sporulation rates of the oocysts shed in the first cycle and therefore lower doses of oocysts ingested by those birds, however this is only speculation.",

In addition, the percentage of birds in each group positive for E. maxima shedding was low until day 15. This is also seen in the increased variation seen within the gavage, more viscous gel, and less viscous gel groups compared to the first cycle of E. maxima shedding, as there were very few birds within those groups shedding E. maxima oocysts during the second cycle. It is possible that the start of shedding for the second cycle was delayed, and higher numbers would have been seen had fecal collection continued beyond 15 days. This trend can be seen in Figure 2D, where the percentage of chicks shedding E. maxima increased every day.",

There was no difference in pre-challenge body weight between any of the groups, which runs counter to the common industry concern of reduced performance when using live coccidia vaccines. In future experiments, further performance analysis could be performed to better understand the effect of coccidia vaccination on body weight gain. Following challenge, the mean body weight gains of the vaccinated groups were not significantly different from the non-challenge controls, indicating protection. The mean body weight of the negative control group was significantly increased compared to the non-vaccinated challenged control group, showing that the challenge had an influence on body weight for non-vaccinated birds. Interestingly, the MV gel group, which showed significantly reduced oocyst shedding in the second cycle compared to the other groups, did not significantly differ in average body weight gain from the non-vaccinated, challenged control group. This illustrates the importance of re-exposure to oocysts in the litter in order to achieve complete protection.",

The spray group did not have significantly different scores from the other vaccinated groups, but did have a significantly higher mean gross lesion score than the negative control group. However, since it was not different from the other vaccinated groups it is reasonable to claim that protection was achieved. The oocyst count scores and the microscopic lesion scores of the vaccinated groups were all statistically the same as the mean score of the positive challenge control group. However, interpretation of these scores is difficult, considering that the birds were all kept on litter during the 7 days post-challenge, and could have continued to cycle vaccine oocysts during this time, rendering it nearly impossible to distinguish between vaccine and challenge oocysts present in the mid-intestine. Although the positive challenge control group did not differ significantly in oocyst count and microscopic lesion scores from the vaccinated/challenged groups, it is possible that the E. maxima scored for the positive control assays was present from challenge, whereas the E. maxima seen in the vaccinated/challenge groups may have been from vaccine.

The gel application methods had oocyst numbers in each dose consistent with the gavage preparation (where vaccine is not mass applied). Contrastingly, there was a loss of oocysts during vaccination for the spray method, which is consistent with other reports showing that infectious bronchitis virus vaccine is lost when applied by spray (Roh et al., 2015). While these differences in total oocysts delivered to chicks varied between application methods, there was no difference in body weight gain or protection from challenge between birds vaccinated using water spray, more viscous gel bar, less viscous gel bar, or gavage. This demonstrates that when these methods are used properly and chickens are exposed to an appropriate dosage of coccidia vaccine, protection will be achieved, regardless of the vaccine application.",
