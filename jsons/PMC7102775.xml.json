The association of Zika virus with Guillain\u2013Barre syndrome was first proposed by Duong et al. [2]. Zika virus infection in pregnant women is also a known cause of serious birth defects in children. In February 2016, the World Health Organization declared Zika virus infection a public health emergency and an international issue [3], [4]. In Korea, 3347 Zika virus diagnostic tests were conducted in 2016, and 16 of them were diagnosed as Zika virus infections. Zika virus is designated and managed as a legal infectious disease since 2016 in Korea [5], [6]. Between 2016 and 2017, 28 patients with Zika virus infection were reported from a national surveillance system. An analysis on demographic, epidemiological, and clinical characteristics of those infected with Zika virus indicated that they had traveled overseas, for mostly short-term visits, to Southeast Asian countries [5].",

Moreover, the estimated rate of asymptomatic Zika infection, as described in other arboviruses such as West Nile virus and dengue, is reportedly high [4]. Recently, a case was reported in which an experimenter was infected with Zika virus due to a needle stick injury in the laboratory setting [6], [8]. Therefore, there is a renewed need for attention to blood-borne diseases for health care workers (HCWs), who are at high risk for exposure to infections through blood or body fluids such as Zika virus, HIV, and Ebola virus [9], [10]. Nursing students experience nursing care at the clinical site during their clinical practice [11]. Consequently, they are also involved in clinical practice related to blood-borne infections during the practice period. However, nurses lack expertise regarding this situation and lack interest in self-protection against the associated risk of infection, leading to a greater risk of exposure to blood-borne infections [12]. Nursing students\u2019 recapping habits could last even after they become nurse. Indeed, it is difficult to change inappropriate nursing habits once they have developed, which may lead to an increase in the incidence of blood-borne infections after students start working as nurses [11].",

Furthermore, since the Aedes aegypti mosquitoes are not found in South Korea, the public tends to be aware of the seriousness of Zika virus infection [5], [6]. Because Zika virus can spread through blood and body fluids, nurses and other HCWs are at risk of exposure to Zika virus during their work. As the number of Zika virus-infected patients is increasing worldwide, nursing students engaging in clinical practice could also be exposed to the risk of Zika virus infection [9], [10]. Therefore, Zika virus infection-prevention measures in hospitals must include not only HCWs but also nursing students. The present study is meaningful in that it examined the actual condition of Zika virus-related knowledge, attitudes, practices, and risk perceptions in nursing students, who are the future experts who will cope with new blood-borne infections.",

Additionally, OSHA and CDC advise HCWs to follow the standard precaution to prevent the blood-borne spread of Zika [9], [10], including hand hygiene, use of PPE, and prevention of needle\u2013stick injuries [8]. However, as reported by Kim et al. [19], nursing students are at higher risk of exposure to needle-stick injuries than other HCWs because they lack expertise and proficiency. Therefore, nursing students should acquire proper knowledge on blood-borne diseases and should pay more attention on their exposure. In the present study, the average nursing students\u2019 level of knowledge on infection control related to Zika virus was relatively low. Studies on general knowledge of Zika virus in nursing students have been limited. As the rate of correct understanding of Zika virus was 58% among nurse practitioners in the United States [14] and only 35% (against the 80% cut-off level) among doctors [13], it is evident that knowledge about Zika virus is generally low not only among nursing students but also among other HCWs. However, by subcategory, nursing students\u2019 knowledge level regarding clinical infection prevention practice was relatively high. Nursing students were well informed that the Zika virus could be transmitted through the blood. Nursing students had learned the standard precaution in their fundamentals of nursing [20]. Therefore, scores regarding the prevention of infection and attitude toward preventive measures such as the use of PPEs, not recapping syringe needles, and the use of the needle waste container were relatively fair. The lowest scores were obtained on the subcategories of treatment and symptoms. Nursing students did not have adequate knowledge about the symptoms of Zika virus, except for fever, and were not well aware of the possibility of Guillain\u2013Barre syndrome (the rate of correct answers was 25.9%). Further, 81.9% of the nursing students responded that they did not have educational experience related to Zika virus. These results suggest the need for education to promote knowledge about Zika virus among nursing students, which includes women of childbearing age. Further, such education should be provided systematically as a part of the curriculum to protect nursing students, who are future nurses, from Zika virus infection. In particular, education in areas of little knowledge, such as treatment and symptoms, should be considered. According to the previous study [13], female gender was a significant predictor of knowledge in Indonesian physicians. However, in the present study, data analysis on the differences based on gender was not performed. Approximately 90% of nursing students are women in South Korea [21]. In the present study, 11% of the participants were men.",
