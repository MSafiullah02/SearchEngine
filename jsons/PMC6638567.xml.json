            "text": "The Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) was first documented in 2012 and has been found to be more challenging to control than the previously identified Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) that emerged nearly a decade earlier.1 The history and current therapeutic options for both SARS and MERS, as well as the less severe infections by human coronavirus strains 229E, OC43, NL63 and HKU1 have recently been reviewed in detail.2 Briefly, following its initial identification, MERS spread within the Middle East and beyond, with cases continuing to arise on a sporadic basis, particularly in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.3, 4 There was also a major outbreak of MERS in South Korea in 2015. It was started from a returning traveler and spread through hospitals and infected a total of 186 people, 36 of which died.5 Travel-related cases have been particularly challenging, as patients traveling from the Middle East present flu-like or pneumonia-like symptoms in other countries unprepared to recognize and treat MERS.6 As of January 2019, the WHO reported 2279 confirmed cases of MERS, resulting in 806 fatalities across 27 countries, with continuing reports of new episodic cases.7 The mortality rate of MERS is 35.5%, which is much higher than was the case for SARS (approximately 10%). Camel to human transmission appears to be the primary source of infection,8, 9 with several studies implicating bats as the primary reservoir from which MERS-CoV originated.10, 11, 12 Although an effective camel vaccine may ultimately be the best control strategy,2, 3 none appears likely in the near future. Person-to-person transmission occurs primarily from close contact in health-care settings or among stricken family members.13, 14 Although therapeutic options for the treatment of MERS-CoV infections have been the subject of recent reviews,4, 15, 16 the continuing emergence of new cases of MERS-CoV combined with the high fatality rate and the potential for future viral mutation makes development of effective therapeutics a continuing priority.1\n",

The overall systematic screening process is summarized in Fig. 1\nA, with compound numbers from each library listed in Table 1\n. The primary screens were done in duplicate using a Tecan liquid handling robot. The Z\u2019-factors varied between 0.53 and 0.80 (average 0.67), indicating high quality of the screening campaign. The replicate plot of percent inhibition from duplicate data shown in Fig. 1B also illustrates the good quality of the screens. A total of 48 primary hit compounds exhibited greater than 35% inhibition at 50 \u00b5M compound concentration (shown in the red square in Fig. 1B). After careful examination of each hit compound structure, compounds that were either toxic or contained reactive functional groups were eliminated. Thirty compounds were cherry-picked and retested in triplicate for their percent inhibition by continuous enzymatic assays. Based upon reproducible percent inhibition results, 23 compounds were selected and re-ordered from their commercial vendors for further hit validation.",

The IC50 values in this work refer to the inhibition of the MERS-PLpro protease activity rather than inhibitory activity of MERS-CoV replication. The IC50 values of compounds 1 and 6 were 25 \u00b5M and 20 \u00b5M, respectively. This reduced the number of hits to 12 compounds with IC50 values below 55 \u00b5M. It is known that the enzymatic functional assay alone can be biased in selecting true positive hits. Consequently, the twelve selected compounds were subjected to a direct binding analysis with the MERS-PLpro enzyme by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) for further validation. The SPR sensorgrams of compound 6 at a series of increasing concentrations are shown in Fig. 2B as an example. Compound 6 possesses slow association and slow dissociation rates at 3.23 \u00d7 103 M\u22121 s\u22121 and 3.00 \u00d7 10\u22122 s\u22121, respectively, resulting in a binding affinity (KD) of 9.3 \u00b5M, and suggests that binding may be controlled through a gating mechanism. Of the initial 12 compounds, seven showed direct binding to the MERS-PLpro protein with a varying range of binding affinity (KD) between 7.6 and 112 \u00b5M. Most of the seven compounds had KD values comparable to IC50 values within 0.5 to 2-fold ranges (Fig. 2C). Of the seven validated hits, two compounds came out of a library of FDA-approved drugs, which are Pranlukast (compound 1) and Sulfasalazine (compound 2). Pranlukast is a cysteinyl leukotriene receptor-1 antagonist used for antagonism of bronchospasms caused by an allergic reaction to allergens in asthmatic patients and Sulfasalazine is being used to treat multiple diseases including rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. Two hits (compounds 3 & 4) were from the diverse sets of the Maybridge library, and the Chembridge library produced three hits (compounds 5\u20137).",

The best fit model was determined to be competitive inhibition for both compounds 1 and 6 with Ki values of 127 \u00b5M and 36.6 \u00b5M, respectively (a Dixon plot of 6 is shown in Fig. 3\nA as an example). The IC50 values of 1 and 6 were determined utilizing a fixed substrate concentration of 50 \u00b5M and remained similar at both 25 and 20 \u00b5M, differing significantly from the Ki values listed above when both the substrate and inhibitor concentrations were varied, (Fig. 3B). It appears that compound 1 does not inhibit MERS-PLpro at higher substrate concentration. This may suggest that the substrate can compete out compound 1 easier than compound 6, as confirmed by competition SPR. The KD values of compounds 1 and 6 alone were 14.1 \u00b5M and 7.6 \u00b5M. respectively. In the presence of 500 \u00b5M substrate, the binding of compound 1 was completely abolished, while that of compound 6 was 7-fold weaker (Fig. 3C). This indicates that the substrate competes with both compounds, with compound 1 more easily substituted by the substrate than compound 6, in agreement with enzymatic assay results.",

Hence, compound 6 was selected for further characterization, including reversibility studies. In addition to the observed dissociation in Fig. 2B, the reversibility of compound 6 was investigated via three different methods: dialysis, desalting and dilution. After complete inhibition of MERS-PLpro enzyme by compound 6, both inhibited and control samples (DMSO) were dialyzed overnight in order to remove compound 6 and recover enzyme activity. Unfortunately, the activity of the active enzyme control was completely lost after dialysis. Second, we utilized a desalting column to remove compound 6, also resulting in the deactivation of active control sample. Thirdly, we set up both enzyme and compound 6 at very high concentrations and gradually diluted both active control and inhibited sample in the exact same manner and measured enzyme activity at each dilution step. If compound 6 behaves as an irreversible inhibitor, the enzyme activity should not recover once it is fully inhibited. (However deleted) The enzyme activity gradually recovered, providing support for compound 6 being a reversible inhibitor (Fig. 3D). The interaction between MERS-PLpro and compound 6 was also monitored by a 2D Transverse Relaxation Optimized Spectroscopy TROSY [1H\u201315N] NMR spectra using uniformly 15N-labeled His-tagged MERS-PLpro (Fig. 4\n). Although sequential assignment has not been carried out on apo-MERS-PLpro, we observed more than thirteen peaks that either shifted (green dotted boxes with arrows) or disappeared (green solid boxes) upon compound 6 binding to MERS-PLpro. The loss of 1H\u201315N resonances may be attributed to either exchange broadening as compound 6 binds and dissociates or a conformational change in the MERS-PLpro backbone.",

We have searched analogs of 6, but only the four analogs of compound 6 shown in Fig. 5\nA were commercially available. Based on activities of the five structural analogues, a preliminary structure-activity relationship (SAR) was obtained (Fig. 5B). The core functionality of our new lead scaffold is a benzene sulfonamide, and a separate six-membered nitrogen-containing ring is bound to the sulfonamide moiety at the R1 location highlighted in blue. The pyrimidin-2 with two methyl groups at ortho and para-positions has better inhibitory activity (6, 73% inhibition) than piperazine-2,6-dione (6a, 16% inhibition) or piperidine (6b, 7% inhibition) moieties. However, it is unclear if either the methyl on the pyrimidin-2 or the heterocycle core itself is crucial for the maintenance of the activities. At the R2 location shown in pink, the amino group at the para-position of benzene is essential for activity. When the amino group was replaced by methyl group (6c), the inhibitory activity decreased significantly to 11%, and the inhibitory activity was almost completely lost (2% inhibition) when the amino group was acetylated (6d). Given the limited number of structural analogs of 6, the preliminary SAR simply underscores key structural features integral to the inhibitory activity.",

This led us to screen a 352-compound Zenobia small fragment library in the presence of the lead compound 6 in an effort to increase inhibitory activity. The same fluorescence-base enzyme assay was used to screen the Zenobia library in attempts to search additional small fragments that can enhance inhibitory activity of 6. Of the 352 fragment compounds, 11 fragments exhibited over 60% inhibition (>10% inhibition enhancement) at 50 \u00b5M concentration in the presence of 20 \u00b5M compound 6. Some fragments showed the opposite effect, decreasing the inhibitory activity of compound 6, probably by competing for the same enzymatic binding site. Five fragments among the 11 selected fragments did improve the apparent IC50 values of compound 6, with improvements ranging from 1.3-fold to 3-fold better (Table 2\n). The IC50 value of each fragment alone was also determined without compound 6 present, and they varied significantly between 71.6 \u00b5M (ZT834) and 239 \u00b5M (ZT626). Fragments ZT426 and ZT470 exhibited moderate enhancement with 1.3-fold and 1.4-fold improved IC50 values for compound 6, while another two fragments, ZT537 and ZT834, enhanced the inhibitory activity of 6 slightly better, at almost 2-fold. Interestingly, the least effective fragment ZT626 by itself had the best activity enhancement for compound 6, reducing the IC50 value by 3-fold to 6.6 \u00b5M. This suggests compound 6 and ZT626 might inhibit MERS-PLpro additively. In addition, the binding affinity of compound 6 in the presence of constant concentration of ZT626 (200 \u00b5M) was determined to be similar (10.8 \u00b5M) to compound 6 alone (9.3 \u00b5M), suggesting that ZT626 probably binds to a different location from the 6 binding site (Figs. 6\nand 2B). Fig. 6A also shows that ZT626 readily dissociates from MERS-PLpro, indicating that its binding is also reversible.",

The primary HTS assay was performed by a Tecan Freedom EVO 200 robot equipped with a Te-Mo 3 \u00d7 3 96-channel Liquid Handler dispenser and a 384-pin stainless steel pin tool (V&P Scientific) with a 200 nL capillary capacity. All assays were done in duplicate in black 384-well plates (Matrix Technologies) at room temperature. The MERS-PLpro enzyme was purified as described28 and was prepared in assay buffer (50 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 0.01% Triton X-100 (v/v), 0.1 mg mL\u22121 BSA, and 2 mM DTT). 30 \u00b5L of enzyme solution (400 nM final concentration) was dispensed into wells, and then 200 nL of 10 mM compound (50 \u00b5M final concentrations) were added and incubated for 5 min. Enzyme reactions were initiated by adding 10 \u00b5L of substrate Z-Arg-Leu-Arg-Gly-Gly-AMC (Bachem Bioscience) at 50 \u00b5M final concentration dissolved in assay buffer and incubated for 6 min. Enzyme reactions were stopped by adding 10 \u00b5L of 10% SDS as a stop solution, and fluorescence intensity was monitored at 360 nm (excitation) and 450 nm (emission) with a Tecan Genios Pro microplate reader.

The MERS-PLpro structure was optimized through the Protein Preparation Wizard in the Schr\u00f6dinger Suite.30 All hydrogens and charges were added in the OPLS3 force field. Restrained minimization was performed on the added hydrogens. Meanwhile, the LigPrep module in the Schr\u00f6dinger Suite31 was used to create the 3D structures of compound 6 as well as to perform the geometric optimization. Molecular docking was performed by GOLD v5.2.222 using the above prepared MERS-PLpro and compound 6. Ubiquitin was extracted before performing docking, and the active site for MERS-PLpro was defined as being within a 10 \u00c5 radius around the catalytic residue Cys111 for the docking of compound 6. The MERS-PLpro was maintained static, while compound 6 was flexible with \u201cflip amide bonds\u201d, \u201cdetect internal H bonds\u201d, and \u201cflip ring corners\u201d set to on during ligand conformations searching. Other parameters applied default values in GOLD. Then three different binding poses for compound 6 were chosen for the following MD simulations and subsequent MM/PBSA calculation to predict binding affinities using the AMBER14 suite of programs.23 Preparation of the MD simulations included assigning Restrained Electrostatic Potential (RESP) atomic partial charges to compound 6 using HF/6-31G* and Gaussian 09 in the R.E.D. online server,32 and then assigning the general AMBER force field33 (GAFF) parameters to the above prepared ligand. A 10 \u00c5 octahedral TIP3P water molecule box was added to each of the complex systems using Cl- counter-ions to neutralize the system. The Amber FF14SB force field was applied for the system. The systems were first minimized using 10,000 steps of steepest descent minimization followed by another 10,000 steps of conjugate gradient minimization. After heating from 0 K to 300 K over 100 ps, the systems were equilibrated over 100 ps at constant pressure (1 bar) and temperature (300 K) with a restraint of 10 kcal mol\u22121 \u00c5\u22122 on the complex and then subsequently without any restraint. Then 5 ns NPT production runs without positional restraints were performed at 300 K and 1 bar for the systems. The atomic coordinates were saved every 2.5 ps. During the MD simulation, all bonds involving hydrogen atoms were constrained to their equilibrium distance using the SHAKE algorithm,34 and a time step of 2 fs. The python script, MMPBSA.py,35 included in AMBER 14, was used to perform the MM/PBSA calculations using the 1200 frames from the last 3 ns of the 5 ns simulation trajectory file.
