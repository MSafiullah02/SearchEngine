Despite the lasting prominence of early investigations into measles, cholera, plague, typhoid fever, malaria, and yellow fever (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) , the intellectual tradition of modern epidemiology stems largely from studies of chronic diseases dating to the post-World War II era, when such conditions came to surpass infectious diseases in morbidity and mortality in highincome countries amid improvements in living conditions and the introduction of numerous antibiotics and vaccines. This epidemiologic transition co-occurred with a shift in focus for epidemiologic research (and training programs) toward the multifactorial etiology of chronic conditions (7) . In parallel, early 20th-century work on the \"dependent happenings\" of communicable diseases (8) (9) (10) (11) yielded to the development of today's core biostatistical methods for chronic diseases, premised on the independence of outcomes among subjects (12) (13) (14) .",

Cluster-randomized trial designs, for example, have become commonplace for evaluating infectious disease interventions, quantifying indirect effects resulting from contagion (28) . Classical models of ecological dynamics have been adapted to address the transmission and control of infectious agents, while our expanding ability to integrate such models with epidemiologic data through Bayesian statistics has enhanced their relevance to policymaking (29) (30) (31) . Most recently, sequencing and phylogenetic analysis have afforded an unprecedented view into the population structure and dynamics of pathogens (32, 33) .",

Although such passive systems of disease reporting have proven invaluable, their limitations, such as incomplete, often inconsistent detection of cases and delayed detection of outbreaks, are well documented (35) . As a result, active surveillance systems that do not depend on providers and laboratories to report have been developed and promoted.",

Such systems, while expensive to develop and maintain, are of great value, especially when they collect biological specimens (e.g., isolates of bacterial and viral pathogens) for typing and support analytic epidemiologic studies (e.g., casecontrol studies of vaccine effectiveness (37) ). Nevertheless, these systems, too, may have limitations, particularly in their ability to detect in a timely fashion outbreaks caused by novel microbial agents, prompting interest in alternative methods.

Data such as emergency department visits, medication sales, online search queries, and social media postings have also been suggested as real-time indicators of outbreak activity, although their integration into public health responses remains a subject of debate (54) (55) (56) . The need to overcome reporting biases is a central challenge, because observations may be too nonspecific to distinguish between meaningful and spurious signals in settings with high technological capacity while also being insensitive to even high-risk events in resource-poor settings (57, 58) . Although nontraditional data sources have, in some applications, supported inferences about epidemic dynamics (59) , limited information about cases from such sources remains a barrier. For instance, models fitted from news reports of recent measles and mumps outbreaks have yielded considerable underestimates of vaccine coverage (60) (61) (62) , underscoring the importance of field investigations.",

Limited reductions in influenza-related deaths among elderly persons amid increases in influenza vaccine coverage during the 1990s provided an important indication that the \"healthy vaccinee\" effect accounted for astonishing and implausible protection against all-cause mortality among elderly influenza vaccine recipients in cohort and case-control studies (121) (122) (123) . Newer methods continue to improve public health inferences obtained from time-series data. In a recent evaluation of invasive pneumococcal disease incidence, trends expected under continued use of 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine provided a counterfactual condition for measuring the impact of the switch to a 13-valent vaccine targeting emerging serotypes (124) . Bayesian averaging of models encoding differing pre-and postvaccination trends and change points provides a generalized strategy for defining such counterfactual comparisons (125) . Other signals of transmission intensity in surveillance data, such as age of infection and sub-or multiannual periodicity, may provide additional insights while reducing sensitivity to fluctuations in reporting effort (126, 127) .",

For instance, high compliance with vaccine schedules may limit variation in individuals' vaccination status and exposures, necessitating large samples to detect factors influencing vaccine performance (128) . Because re-emergence most likely reflects the expansion of 1 or several pathogen clades, limited pathogen diversity may hinder the application of conventional approaches to identifying microbial determinants of vaccine escape (129, 130) . Novel methods to distinguish null from vaccine-driven mutations in antigencoding regions (102, 131) may streamline efforts to identify vaccine escape, while mathematical modeling provides a basis for comparing candidate hypotheses with observations (26, 27) .",

Whereas patients traditionally have been enrolled in antimicrobial treatment studies on the basis of target bacterial species infections or clinical syndromes, it is uncertain within what strata such trials may yield transportable inferences. Rather than merely the infecting pathogen's baseline resistance or susceptibility phenotype, strata may be defined by factors such as pathogen lineage, mutational barriers to resistance development (142) , and presence of horizontally transferable resistance elements in cocolonizing agents or environmental sources (143) .

However, these postulates have long been recognized as inadequate, particularly for illnesses caused by viruses, and thus of largely historical interest (159) ; for instance, the notion that a pathogen should be absent from healthy individuals is incompatible with the prominence of carriage and asymptomatic infection in the natural history of numerous pathogens. A growing appreciation of the complexity of the human microbiome, and the likelihood that intricate mixtures of microorganisms at diverse body sites may be either the cause or consequence of both detrimental and beneficial physiological states, has further highlighted the difficulty of linking a given health outcome to infection by a single microorganism.",

The best causal understanding of such relationships has come from randomized trials demonstrating that infection-preventing interventions are efficacious against downstream chronic illness, such as peptic ulcers due to Helicobacter pylori and chronic wheeze due to respiratory syncytial virus (161, 162) . Natural experiments following the same intuition have provided additional evidence of such relationships, such as measles-induced immunosuppression (163) , malnutrition and stunting due to enteric infection (164) , and complex or chronic otitis media due to tissue damage from acute early-life disease (165) . Such relationships have proven difficult to probe in the absence of a randomized or natural experiment, because of the likelihood that confounding factors influence individuals' risk for initial infection as well as chronic sequelae. New paradigms for ascribing an etiologic role to microorganisms and resulting host responses are clearly needed and may prove important in efforts to quantify the health impacts of infectious disease interventions.",

At the same time, advances in epidemiologic and statistical methods, together with the growing availability of data from diverse sources, have provided new tools and approaches for studying infectious diseases. The infectious disease epidemiologists of the future will need a solid grounding in the biology of infection and the host immune response, as well as training in the increasingly sophisticated approaches to causal inference; the manipulation and analysis of large-scale data sets, including pathogen genome sequences; and mathematical modeling, together with the behavioral and social determinants of health. Integration of these elements into epidemiology training programs (e.g., through coursework in Bayesian statistics and phylogenetics) represents an increasingly important consideration for academic departments.",
