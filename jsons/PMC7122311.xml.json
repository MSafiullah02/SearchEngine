The incidence and accuracy of diagnosis of chronic lung diseases, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and pulmonary fibrosis, continue to increase worldwide. Lung diseases affect both the individual and the surrounding society extensively, with impact of these diseases on the family, work place and health economics, including increasing costs for health care while a majority continues to be incurable. For most chronic lung diseases little progress has been made, in recent years, in the development of therapeutic strategies for managing these burdensome pathologies. There is an urgent need to increase our understanding of the mechanisms underlying these diseases and for innovative approaches that will lead to the clinical breakthroughs that are currently lacking.",

Specialised cells that reside within, and in relation with, defined regions of the extracellular matrix (ECM) make up the main building blocks of these components. As one of the few organs that are directly exposed to environmental insults, the lung has an effective endogenous repair system that enables homeostasis to be maintained within the tissue. Whilst the exact mechanisms underlying most chronic lung diseases are not well understood, in many instances it is recognised that an aberration of the inherent repair process probably contributes to the pathophysiology that results in the diseased outcome [3\u20139]. The lung has a slow yet constant cell turnover that nevertheless cannot always cope with the loss of tissue and cells during (severe) injury or chronic disease [5]. During ageing, the respiratory system undergoes structural remodelling affecting both elements of the ECM and the cells, which leads to loss of elasticity and enlargement of alveolar spaces, with eventual airway narrowing because of loss of elastic recoil [10]. The result is a lung more susceptible to both acute and chronic insults, which becomes dysfunctional and with a lower breathing capacity that debilitates the patient [11].",

            "text": "The pathological changes in COPD are observed in the central airways, small airways, alveolar space and vasculature [20\u201322] (see Fig. 1.1). The central airway alterations include goblet cell hyperplasia, which are associated with the enlargement of mucus-producing glands and squamous cell metaplasia [23]. These changes are related to enhanced mucus production and cough in chronic bronchitis. The small airways, usually defined as airways with less than 2 mm internal diameter without cartilage, are considered the major site of increased airflow resistance in most patients with COPD [24]. Small airway wall thickening is observed, with increased smooth muscle mass and infiltration of inflammatory cells, and some alterations of epithelial cell differentiation leading to a variable shift of club- and ciliated cells to more goblet cells. This small airway wall thickening together with the loss of peri-bronchial elastic recoil is considered as the predominant cause of airflow limitation [10, 21]. Infiltration of the small airway walls mainly by macrophages and (CD8) T lymphocytes can contribute to the severity of airway limitation [24]. The presence of macrophages and T lymphocytes, particularly CD8+ T cells, may in addition contribute to changes of the alveolar walls in COPD [25\u201327]. The chronic presence of these inflammatory cells leads to damage of the alveolar walls, and eventually, because of the lack of tissue repair in COPD [28, 29], could lead to emphysema. Alteration of the pulmonary vasculature is now also considered as a vital component of COPD. This is caused by smooth muscle hypertrophy, which is associated with increased deposition of elastin and collagen [23, 30, 31] accompanied by apoptosis of the endothelial cells in the arterioles [32], induced by the hypoxic conditions in the COPD lung.",

Smoking cessation is the most effective intervention in any treatment plan for COPD, stopping smoking could decrease the risk of death by 18% [33]. Several kinds of medications are used to treat the symptoms and complications of COPD [34]. Bronchodilators, with long-acting and short-acting forms, can relax the muscles of the airways to help relieve coughing and shortness of breath and make breathing easier [35]. Theophylline can help improve breathing and prevent exacerbations, although with strong side effects [36]. Anti-inflammatory medications, inhaled glucocorticosteroids are commonly combined with long-acting bronchodilators to reduce inflammation in the airways and reduce mucus production [37]. Antibiotics have been successfully used for treatment and prevention of acute exacerbations of COPD [38]. Oxygen therapy and pulmonary rehabilitation programs also provide additional therapies for people with moderate or severe COPD. Surgery is an option for COPD patients with severe emphysema who are not helped sufficiently by medications alone, including lung transplantation.",

            "text": "Classically IPF was thought to be driven by a chronic inflammatory process; however, although inflammation likely still contributes to the pathogenesis, increasing evidence indicates that an uncontrolled healing response can gradually evolve into a pathologic fibrotic response when important regulatory mechanisms are disrupted and persistent inflammation follows. The persistent inflammation can result in a local milieu of pro-fibrotic cytokines and growth factors such as IL-13 and TGF-\u03b21 [52\u201354]. The pro-fibrotic environment causes fibroblasts to transform into myofibroblasts which are the main producers of ECM which stay active in the presence of TGF-\u03b2, resulting in scarring and destruction of the lung architecture [53]. Increasing research results indicate that the fibrotic response is also driven by abnormally activated alveolar epithelial cells (AECs) [43]. AECs produce mediators that induce the formation of fibroblast and myofibroblast foci through the proliferation of resident mesenchymal cells, attraction of circulating fibrocytes and stimulation of epithelial to mesenchymal transition. The mechanisms that link IPF with ageing and aberrant epithelial activation are unknown; recent research results suggest that the abnormal recapitulation of developmental pathways and epigenetic changes may have a role in driving these changes [44].",

Nintedanib is a small molecule inhibitor of the receptor tyrosine kinases of the PDGF receptor, FGF receptor and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor, which are believed to play important roles in the pathogenesis of IPF [51, 56]. Pirfenidone has multiple, different, not fully understood, mechanisms of action; however, it appears to have antifibrotic properties via regulation of pro-fibrotic growth factors such as TGF-\u03b2 and tumour necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) [51, 57, 58]. Both drugs slow the progression or reduce the risk of acute exacerbations of IPF but do not stop or reverse pathophysiology, meaning the search for a cure continues and lung transplantation remains the only treatment for IPF that improves quality of life and survival [55, 59, 60].",

The obstruction is driven by remodelling of the artery walls including hypertrophy in the medial layer, proliferation and fibrotic (ECM deposition) changes in the intima and thickening of the advential layer accompanied by inflammatory infiltrates [69, 74]. In more severe disease, the so-called complex or plexiform lesions develop with a glomeruloid vascular process and a dilated venous part added to the obstructed arteriole [69] (see Fig. 1.1). Vasoconstriction, associated with overproduction of endothelin-1 (vasoconstrictor) or underproduction of nitric oxide or prostacyclin (or both) (vasodilators), is often a disease characteristic.

More than 1700 mutations have been recognised in the CFTR gene that lead to CF [82]. These mutations are divided into six classes depending on how the change affects the protein synthesis, trafficking, function or stability of the CFTR [83]. The CFTR, expressed apically in epithelial cell membranes, is a transmembrane channel that is important for regulating cellular salt and fluid homeostasis. It is a chloride (Cl\u2212) and bicarbonate (HCO3\u2212) ion channel. Mutations in this channel result in disrupted flow of Cl\u2212 and HCO3\u2212 through epithelial cells of multiple organs, resulting in aberrant functioning of those organs.",

These mutations result in the accumulation of a thick, sticky mucus in the airways driving chronic inflammation and enabling recurrent respiratory infections usually initiating soon after birth. Animal studies reflect the pathological changes in the airways, also suggesting the trachea is narrowed. The neutrophil influx, in response to the ongoing airway inflammation, leads to further inflammation as a result of the release of neutrophil elastase and other pro-inflammatory cytokines [87, 88]. This vicious cycle drives remodelling of the airway wall tissues, resulting in air trapping and bronchiectasis (see Fig. 1.1).",

Airway inflammation is addressed with steroids and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, while \u03b2 agonists are used in combination with hypertonic saline to reduce the viscosity of the mucus and relax the airways. More recently there have been exciting developments of therapeutics aimed at \u201ccorrecting\u201d and \u201cpotentiating\u201d CFTR. Vertex Pharmaceuticals have obtained FDA approval for the use of VX-770 (CFTR corrector, ivacaftor, trade name Kalydeco) [90, 91] and VX-809 (CFTR potentiator, lumacaftor) [92] for clinical use in CF patients with specific mutations [93]. Combination therapies that aim to improve the functionality and stability of the CFTR at the epithelia cell surface are now being developed [94]. These approaches have made significant advances and improvements in the quality of life for many patients with CF, but they are not effective for all mutations of CFTR. These approaches help to reduce the ongoing inflammation, but it is not clear if they are able to address the structural remodelling in the lung tissues.",

            "text": "The pathophysiology of ARDS is recognised to occur in three overlapping phases [96, 97] with a characteristic and pathognomonic histopathology termed diffuse alveolar damage (DAD). The initial injury to the lung causes a disruption of the alveolar endothelium and epithelial cell barrier accompanied by oedema in the airspaces [98]. In the case of an infectious origin, neutrophils and macrophages are the major cell types that infiltrate the airspaces, but with many aetiologies inflammation is inconspicuous. In a somewhat later phase, there is also leakage of thrombin and protein amongst others leading to hyaline membranes. There are also vascular changes leading to the formation of microthrombi and changes in vasomotor tone. The last phase is a repair phase in which the alveolar epithelium is regenerated through proliferation of the type II cells and differentiation to type I cells. This enables restoration of the permeability of the basal membranes and allows fluid clearance from the airspaces. The vascular changes also reverse during this stage. The final stage can be complete resolution but very often is characterized by impressive thickening of alveolar septa by fibroblast proliferation without obvious collagen fibrosis with subsequent severe lung function problems and often a poor prognosis. In some cases a fibrotic phase can follow where collagen and other ECM proteins are deposited resulting in a partially stable fibrotic lung. The factors regulating the fibrotic/fibroblastic phase in DAD/ARDS are not known but mechanical ventilation, in particular with high pressure and high oxygen concentration is thought to be an important pathogenetic component [99].",
