This model strongly predicted the actual US distribution of Covid-19, accounting for 94.8% of spatial-temporal variation in total infections and 99.3% in Covid-19 related fatalities from March 15, 2020. US counties with higher population density, poverty index, civilian population, and minorities, especially African Americans had a higher number of confirmed infections adjusted for county population. Social distancing measured by the change in the rate of human encounter per km 2 relative to pre-covid-19 national average was associated with slower rate of Covid-19 infections, whereas higher testing was associated with higher number of infections. The number of people infected was increasing, however, the rate of increase in new infections was starting to show signs of plateauing starting from the second week of April. Our model projects 2.11 million people to test positive for Covid-19 and 122,951 fatalities by June 1, 2020. Importantly, our model suggests strong social differences in the infections and deaths across US communities, and inequities in areas with larger African American minorities and higher poverty index expected to show higher rates of Covid-19 infections and deaths. Preventive steps including social distancing and community closures have been a cornerstone in stopping the transmission and potentially reducing the spread of the disease. Crucial knowledge of the role of social characteristics in the disease transmission is essential to understand current disease distribution, predict future distribution, and plan additional preventive steps.",

The social transmission model will utilize county-level population demographics, focusing on population density, number of minorities, and age distribution, and social characteristics, 2 such as, poverty index 3 and number of non-professional civilian population, and social distancing using rate of unique human encounters per Km 2 relative to US national pre-COVID baseline. This social transmission model will allow us to study the contribution of population density and social characteristics on the distribution of Covid-19 in US communities. Importantly, studying Covid-19 infections and deaths using our social transmission model will allow us to better understand the predictors of current disease distribution across US communities, the ability to predict future distribution across US communities and develop a national-level estimate, and most significantly identify the US communities that require the most resources to slow the infection and death rates.

The CDC provides the specimens tested in the CDC labs and public health labs in 49 states, New York City, Puerto Rico, USAF, and 15 California Counties.

A county-level model was developed in several steps; the first step using time since March 1, 2020 and latitude and longitudinal coordinates for counties explained about 16% variation in the rate of confirmed infections. The addition of population demographics, social characteristics, and social distancing explained around 98% of variation in Covid-19 infections. 11 This model also included splines for time since March 1, 2020, population density, and latitude and longitude. In a separate model, we included testing characteristics and found the predictive models to be unstable due to large county-level missing data and underreporting and severe lags; these additional variables were therefore, excluded from our Intel MKL for parallel mathematical computing using 18 cores. 12",

This population dynamic suggests that young residents may be more likely to be asymptomatic carriers of the coronavirus. In areas with higher number of middle aged adults, those 40-60 years old had lower rate of infection, perhaps suggesting that more social distancing is being maintained in the middle age groups than the younger age groups with those of older ages showing a high susceptibility for infections due to the higher number of chronic health conditions associated with age.",

Daily new hospitalization in the US had been around 2,000 new hospitalization cumulative over the states (Figure 1D). However, on May 1 st , new Covid-19 related hospitalizations showed a dramatic increase to around 10,000 on that day, which fell back to 2,000 new hospitalizations.

According to our model, US counties with high population density have high rates of Covid-19 infections and deaths, with rates of infections and deaths increasing exponentially.

These densely populated communities had twice the number of non-Hispanic Blacks than communities that were less densely populated as is also reflected in our social contagion model, where rates of infections and deaths were dramatically higher in US counties with large number of non-Hispanic Blacks.",
