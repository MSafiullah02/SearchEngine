Due to drastic precautionary steps taken in China, the disease has been contained to some extent of late, however, it has rapidly spread over to the rest of the world (ROW henceforth), causing serious concern. It is expected that because of the current awareness, efficient treatment and preventive measures in operation, the number of deaths may be controlled soon, but long term effects on academic activities, commerce, social life, sports, tourism etc. are anticipated.",

In this work, the ongoing outbreak is studied using the data in [17] where the number of total cases, number of new cases and some other relevant information are available for China and other parts of the world. The data are available in the form of daily reports (starting from January 21, 2020; the onset of the disease happened much earlier in China) of new cases and total cases for different countries. Fig.  1 shows the number of countries affected as a function of time (starting date January 13, 2020 for this data), the total number at present is close to 90.

However, the fit may not be appropriate when all the data are included as the epicenters might have shifted elsewhere. Indeed we find the data at larger d to be more scattered.

The cumulative data for China show reasonably good agreement with the empirical form obtained in [18] . Also, the numerical values of the timescales T Ch and T ROW , associated with the cumulative number of affected persons, are found to be quite close, consistent with the fact that the data are for the same virus. The epidemic is still in the rising stage outside China. The most in-triguing result is the inverse square law dependence of the number of cases against distance from the epicenter. This could have some connection with the gravity law in social dynamics.",
