Enteric bacteria and viruses have been recovered from indoor air and environmental surfaces in areas surrounding toilets.18, 36, 37 We reported that aerosolized simian rotavirus SA-1138 survived best at midrange RH.39, 40 These results contradicted a prior study by Moe and Harper,41 in which the UK strain of calf rotavirus was reported to survive best at low and high RH, but not at high temperature.41 Subsequent studies on human rotavirus,39 murine rotavirus, and a UK strain of calf rotavirus, aerosolized under the same experimental setup, confirmed the behavior of all strains of rotaviruses are similar in airborne state.39, 40 Furthermore, studies of different picornaviruses (poliovirus type 1 [Sabin] and human rhinovirus) and a human coronavirus (an enveloped virus) that used the same experimental conditions produced results that were consistent with the published literature, suggesting that the experimental design did not introduce bias toward the behavior of aerosolized rotaviruses.39, 42, 43\n",

The use of aerosol-generating procedures, such as intubation, bronchoscopy, and oxygen delivery vents, may promote dispersal of SARS via enhanced release in mists of exhaled pulmonary gases.34, 51 Our earlier work on the behavior of aerosolized human coronaviruses 229E further substantiates the potential role of air in their aerial spread.39\n",

There are also a variety of fungal components that have been identified in air, including mycotoxins, ergosterols, glucans, and microbial volatile organic compounds, and these require unique analysis methods.64 Taken together, these findings provide a foundation for the definition of sick building syndrome.68 High humidity within sick houses and buildings allows for growth of fungi indoors, particularly species of Aspergillus, Penicillium, and Cladosporium and Stachybotrys chartarum, an indoor mold that was associated with sick building syndrome several decades ago.64, 68, 69 These fungi can be found in dust, furniture, carpets, and ventilation systems at concentrations ranging from 0-1,000 colony-forming unit (CFU)/m3.64 In fact, carpet has been described as a sink for fungi, but it is also a source for resuspension of fungal particles into the air.64 Various respiratory conditions (eg, wheeze, cough, asthma) have been linked to fungi and their biologic components in the indoor environment.64 Fungal species found outdoors include Cladosporium and Alternaria spp, which are responsible for triggering hypersensitivity reactions, including rhinitis, sinusitis, and asthma.27, 64\n",

The air-decontaminating claims of many such technologies are not based on testing under field-relevant conditions with pathogens relevant to human health, and scientifically valid and standardized protocols to generate field-relevant data for label claims for review by regulatory and public health agencies and the public at large remain unavailable. Here, we address this gap in the development of a test platform for standardized testing of commercially available devices for decontaminating indoor air of vegetative bacteria that represent airborne human pathogens. We know of only one guideline that directly relates to this topic.71 It specifies the size of a sealed enclosure for experimental contamination of the air with aerosols of vegetative bacteria to assess technologies for their temporary reduction. Therefore, the text that follows relates directly to that guideline.",

A suspension of S aureus in a soil load was nebulized into the chamber with the muffin fan operating for 5 minutes to evenly distribute the airborne bacterial particles. A 2-minute air sample was then collected from the chamber using an STA sampler to determine the initial level of airborne contamination. Ten minutes were allowed to elapse for circulation of the airborne bacteria in the chamber. The muffin fan was then turned off and the airborne bacteria were allowed to settle for 30 minutes. At the end of this period, the Petri plates were retrieved and eluted for CFU to determine the titer of microbial contamination deposited on each one. Such testing allowed us to determine the levels of airborne bacteria that could settle on the plates without air decontamination procedures.",

Although classic airborne spread of pathogens occurs via droplet nuclei, droplets can potentially contaminate environmental surfaces, depending on their size and prevailing environmental conditions, thereby creating secondary vehicles for pathogens. Therefore, targeting airborne pathogens could potentially provide an additional advantage by reducing environmental surface contamination. Our preliminary findings indicate that a reduction in the level of viable airborne bacteria using active air decontamination can also reduce bacterial contamination on environmental surfaces in the same setting. Therefore, targeting airborne pathogens could entail additional benefits, such as preventing or reducing the deposition of harmful microbes on secondary vehicles that include frequently touched environmental surfaces and also preventing or reducing their resuspension from these surfaces back into the air via a variety of indoor activities (Fig 1).8, 12, 17, 75, 76 Further studies should investigate the role air decontamination may play in reducing the contamination of environmental surfaces and its combined impact on interrupting the risk of pathogen spread in both domestic and institutional settings.",
