            "text": "R apidly evolving, modern information technologies have provided a host of options to improve communication across all fields, including medicine. Telehealth broadly refers to the use of electronic information and telecommunications technology to deliver and support health-related services including both clinical and nonclinical as well as provider education or medical training via the internet, video conferencing, wireless communications, streaming multimedia video, and store-and-forward telemedicine. Under the umbrella of telehealth is telemedicine, which specifically refers to the delivery of clinical care to a patient without an inpatient visit, often performed via secure HIPAA AQ : 6 compliant video conferencing. It is typically used for follow-up visits of established patients, management of chronic conditions, specialist consultations, and medication management. More specifically, in a peerreviewed article describing modern telemedicine, Sood et al 1 branch of e-health that uses communications networks for delivery of healthcare services and medical education from one geographical location to another.\" The authors also explained that telemedicine can also be used as a way \"to overcome issues like uneven distribution and shortage of infrastructural and human resources.\" Furthermore, telehealth can provide a safe means of delivering clinical care when the dangers of interpersonal contact outweigh the benefits of standard patient visits, as we are currently experiencing during the coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) pandemic.",

            "text": "Telehealth services have been used in several documented roles within orthopaedic practice including remote consultations, outpatient care, postoperative evaluations, and rehabilitation. [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] Despite such publications highlighting utilization and benefits of telemedicine, to the authors' knowledge, it is not widely regarded as a standard service or patient expectation among most orthopaedic practices in the United States. Furthermore, there are a specific set of challenges associated with implementing telehealth services including the need for additional technological equipment, medical provider training, additional staff, patient education, altered reimbursement schedules, and absence of in-person physical examination, among others. Furthermore, there is a challenge to adhere to the HIPAA compliance, which often AQ : 7 requires careful implementation of secure communication channels. However, given the unprecedented evolution of the COVID-19 pandemic, the federal government has suspended the established HIPAA compliance requirements and related telecommunications for telehealth services. In addition, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services announced expansion of telehealth services on an emergency basis via the 1,135 waiver authority and Coronavirus Preparedness and Response Supplemental Appropriations Act. This waiver allows for Medicare coverage of \"office, hospital and other visits furnished via telehealth across the country and including in patient's places of residence starting March 6, 2020.\" 7 This has greatly increased the providers' ability to maintain continuity of care for patients at a time when social distancing, self-isolation, and quarantine have become the new norm.",

Consistent with our hypothesis, we identified a notable increase in new telehealth offerings in orthopaedic departments throughout the United States, with a positive correlation to COVID-19 disease burden as depicted by the heat map analysis (Figures 1 and 2) . The epicenter of the novel COVID-19 outbreak emerged in December 2019 from Wuhan, People's Republic of China, and has rapidly spread across the globe, requiring the World Health Organization (WHO) to officially declare COVID-19 a pandemic on March 11, 2020. Per the WHO, \"a pandemic is the worldwide spread of a new disease\" with the WHO reporting 638,146 confirmed cases and 30,105 confirmed deaths in 203 countries. 8, 9 In the United States, the CDC reports the burden of disease as 122,653 total cases with 2,112 confirmed deaths across all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, Guam, Northern Marianas, and the U.S. Virgin Islands as of March 29, 2020. 10 In response to the rapid spread of COVID-19, national guidelines were issued by the White House Coronavirus Task Force on March 16, 2020, with a series of recommendations to slow the spread of disease. 11 Simultaneously, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the American College of Surgeons, the U.S. Surgeon General, and the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons issued recommendations to delay elective surgeries in response to the rapidly evolving pandemic. [12] [13] [14] These collective recommendations have been issued during an unprecedented time requiring rapid adjustment in how the orthopaedic community continues to deliver high-quality patient care. As such, the Office for Civil Rights at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services announced an historic expan-sion of telehealth access to combat the COVID-19 pandemic. 15 Given these measures, we identified that 63.1% of the ERAS participant orthopaedic institutions are providing telehealth services with an additional 22.5% currently setting up telehealth capabilities. Furthermore, 83% of the 106 institutions currently providing telehealth visits have only recently implemented such services in direct response to the COVID-19 pandemic with 68.9% using Epic. This clearly demonstrates the rapid and appropriate implementation of telehealth services by academic orthopaedic institutions throughout the country with the Northeast and South regions markedly more likely to offer telehealth services. This is distinctly portrayed via the heat map ",

In response to the pandemic, a significant increase in telehealth services have been realized in specific \"hot spot\" regions with a 550% increase in the state of New York and a 900% increase in California. The concept of using telehealth services to improve patient care is not new in orthopaedic practice. Sathiyakumar et al 16 compared patient satisfaction between telemedicine and in-person follow-up appointments for orthopaedic trauma patients. A total of 24 patients were enrolled and randomized to each group with a total of four follow-up appointments during a 6-month period. The authors reported no difference in patient satisfaction between telemedicine and in-person clinic visits; however, no one in the telemedicine group took time off from work and spent markedly less time on their visits compared with the clinic follow-up group with most patients (75%) agreeing to future follow-up visits with telemedicine. In addition, Sharareh and Schwarzkopf 17 found that patients receiving telemedicine visits after total joint arthroplasty reported higher satisfaction with less calls to the clinic staff. Similarly, in a systematic review by Gilbert et al, 18 patients readily accepted the idea of using real time video conferencing for their visits with orthopaedic surgery providers.",
