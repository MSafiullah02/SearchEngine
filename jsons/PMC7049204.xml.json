However, complications such as pin loosening and infection have been reported in patients fixed using the halo-vest brace [2].",

The decrease in O-C2 angle shifts the mandible posteriorly with the tongue root, resulting in a reduction in the pharyngeal space. This backward movement of the tongue root presumably causes oropharyngeal stenosis and impairment of adequate motion of the epiglottis. In addition, Kaneyama et al. [19] recently reported the pharyngeal inlet angle (PIA), which also correlates with pharyngeal space, as a predictor of dysphagia in patients who underwent occipitocervical fusion.",

Based on FILS level, patients were classified into non-dysphagia (FILS level: 10) and dysphagia (FILS level: 1\u20139) groups. FILS is defined as follows [20]: Level 1, no swallowing training; Level 2, swallowing training not using food; Level 3, swallowing training using a small quantity of food; Level 4, easy-to-swallow food less than the quantity of a meal, but predominantly with alternative nutrition; Level 5, easy-to-swallow food orally ingested for 1\u20132 meals, but alternative nutrition also given; Level 6, easy-to-swallow food for 3 meals, but alternative nutrition used; Level 7, easy-to-swallow food orally ingested in 3 meals with no alternative nutrition given; Level 8, patient eats three meals, only excluding food that is particularly difficult to swallow; Level 9, no dietary restriction, and patient ingesting three meals orally, with medical considerations; and Level 10, normal.",

The coefficient ratios suggested that O-C2 angle may provide the greatest contribution to the incidence of dysphagia among the items examined. However, other components of occipitocervical alignment such as translation forward or back in the horizontal plane and/or angulation at different areas of cervical spine may also affect the incidence of dysphagia. Further studies are warranted to clarify other radiographic measurement items affecting swallowing functions.",
