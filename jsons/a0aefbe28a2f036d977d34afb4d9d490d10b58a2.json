One study based on analysis of normal kidney cells indicated that ACE2 and TMPRSS genes were high co-expression in podocytes and proximal straight tubule cells, which play critical roles in urine filtration, reabsorption and excretion. 20 According to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECdC), about 80% of COVID-19 infection cases is mild, while 14% patients experience severe infection and 6% patients develop to critically ill. 21 As the SARS-CoV-2 mainly first induced respiratory tract infection, the duration and accumulation of SARS-CoV-2 in the circulation, maybe key courses to attack extra-pulmonary organs include kidney.
