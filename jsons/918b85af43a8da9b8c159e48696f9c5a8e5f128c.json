As confirmed case numbers continue to rise nationwide, health systems are urgently diverting resources and personnel toward the surge of patients who have been hospitalized because of COVID-19. Various governmental agencies and other organizations, such as the American College of Surgeons (ACS), have called for the postponement of all elective procedures and have issued guidelines for the triage of new patients [3] [4] [5] [6] . Certain orthopaedic acute operations, including those for the treatment of fracture, dislocation, and infection, may continue. However, with the supplies of personal protective equipment (PPE) expected to dwindle and hospital bed utilization rising, it is crucial to understand the potential risk of COVID-19 to the orthopaedic workforce.",

This finding is particularly concerning given the high proportion of older practitioners in the U.S. workforce. In an analysis of U.S. Census Bureau American Community Survey data between 2014 and 2018, Buerhaus et al. estimated that 29% (336,000) of the >1.2 million physicians in the U.S. are \u202155 years of age 11 . This estimate is further supported by the Federation of State Medical Boards (FSMB) physician census, with 30.3% (297,915) of licensed physicians in 2018 being \u202160 years of age 12 . Together, these findings encourage additional safety precautions and limited patient contact in order to protect this vulnerable population.

Older age has been considered to be an important factor related to increased disease severity and mortality, particular with the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. However, we were unable to control for other influential factors such as a history of asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), or immunosuppression in our geospatial mapping. We acknowledge that the contracting of COVID-19 and its severity may be influenced by existing comorbid conditions (e.g., smoking status, pulmonary disease, hypertension) 17 and that younger populations also have been severely affected in certain cases 17 . Nevertheless, the ageassociated risks of COVID-19 have been demonstrated, and it is unknown how the health of orthopaedic surgeons compares with that of an age-matched general population. Furthermore, the majority (92.3%) of orthopaedic surgeons are male 18 , which has emerged as another risk factor for COVID-19 severity 17 . The case fatality rate of COVID-19 for males in China was reported as 2.8%, as compared with 1.7% for females 19 , and New York City, California, and Italy have mimicked this mortality difference by sex 20 .",

Rather, our findings may suggest that the high proportion of these providers in areas of high rates of disease prevalence may increase their susceptibility if they are to continue to care for patients with COVID-19 in those geographic areas. Unfortunately, given that we were only able to extract state-level data, our analysis does not consider age distributions for specific cities versus rural and suburban areas. As cities such as New York City (New York) and counties such as Orleans Parish (Louisiana) are experiencing most of their states' confirmed cases, our analysis is limited by the potential for ecological fallacy. However, we still contend that these findings on a statewide level can provide meaningful information for those on the front lines of infection mitigation across the nation. Our utilized data did not distinguish between whether providers were engaged in care on a full-time or parttime basis 21 . A recent Orthopaedic Practice in the United States (OPUS) survey found that 88.9% of orthopaedic surgeons surveyed who were \u202160 years of age were practicing on a parttime basis 18 . This finding may explain why the orthopaedic workforce carries a disproportionate number of providers in the older age range. We additionally cannot be proscriptive to health systems that might inherently need older physicians to serve in front-line roles given the depletion of either specialty-specific (e.g., critical care or emergency room-trained) providers or younger care providers who have succumbed to COVID-19 themselves or who have been impacted by an overwhelming patient burden 22 . The present study further outlines key recommendations for the deployment of older physicians first to virtual care roles; only if the health system is sufficiently stressed to the point where the front line is failing should older physicians be deployed in this capacity. Our institution at this time has held back surgeons \u202160 years of age from front-line work. We also point out that states with exceedingly high proportions of older orthopaedic surgeons may benefit from specifically recruiting younger physicians from other states with lower COVID-19 caseloads. This process has already begun, with multiple states waiving licensing requirements in order to allow providers to practice across state lines 23 . Despite these limitations, we believe that the present study is the first to compare the distribution of older orthopaedic providers to that of COVID-19 confirmed cases across the U.S.",

In their survey of Additionally, while general wards (79.2%) and public places in the hospital (20.8%) were the most common suspected sites of exposure, Guo et al. reported that operating rooms were believed to be sites of exposure for 12.5% of those infected 24 . Therefore, additional precautions should be taken when performing procedures on patients with confirmed or 25 . Their strategy involves performing sterile decontamination procedures before entering the operative suite, consistently utilizing N95 or FFP2 respirators, minimizing the use of power tools during procedures, using suction devices to minimize aerosol spread, and bathing following each operation. Although the ideal method of reducing COVID-19 spread remains to be determined, the strategy proposed by those authors may be a promising riskreduction strategy and therefore should be heavily considered if older physicians continue to operate in the midst of this crisis. Along with these safety precautions for all orthopaedic providers, our findings suggest that shifts in practice organization should be considered to minimize contact between older providers and infected patients. One promising option would be through the implementation of telemedicine services. Related technologies have tremendously expanded across medical specialties given current social distancing mandates 26,27 and can allow older orthopaedic providers to continue helping patients without increasing their risk of contracting the illness. Additionally, restricting interaction between providers caring for patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 and those providing inpatient care to other patients can prevent spread among orthopaedic teams. This measure was recently suggested by Liang et al., who detailed the segregation of inpatient and outpatient teams in order to minimize cross-contamination among their orthopaedic personnel 28 . Furthermore, older orthopaedic surgeons may serve an important role in resident training during this time 29 , with various platforms currently available for remote education 30, 31 . Therefore, although older providers may be protected by removal from direct patient care, there are various options for their continued service to the orthopaedic community.",

            "text": "It is important to note that the present study does not imply that COVID-19 infection among younger providers is in any way less severe or less important to minimize. Similarly, we do not aim to provide blanket advocacy regarding the protection of older providers by deploying younger orthopaedic surgeons preferentially to the front lines. The current situation has been trying for all age sectors of the population, with difficult decisions that have both ethical and societal implications being made daily 23 . Our findings serve to educate health-care systems about the proportion of older, high-risk orthopaedic providers as well as to encourage practice restructuring to reduce disease spread among higher-risk providers as a whole, if possible. While we use age as a surrogate of risk in this model, guidelines should be followed with regard to adequate PPE dissemination, shifting to telemedicine, maintaining social distancing between care team members, and ensuring training on preventative measures for all providers in the field of orthopaedics who may be at risk, regardless of the level of that risk. Therefore, we believe that our findings do not imply that any particular ethical position should be taken but rather that they provide insight into the risk posed to our nation's workforce, especially among those with well-reported risk factors. Specifically, it should remain up to the individual health-care system, considering the local workforce characteristics and burden of disease, to choose which surgeons are deployed at this time and in what capacity. As a profession, we must also consider the long-term consequences of further exacerbating the age distribution of ortho-paedic surgeons if younger surgeons are disproportionally impacted by COVID-19 because of earlier deployment.",

            "text": "Given the high percentages of older orthopaedic surgeons nationwide, our analysis highlights that special precautions should be taken to ensure the safety of older physicians involved in the care of patients affected by COVID-19. In order to reduce their exposure to the virus, orthopaedic providers should consider shifting toward providing orthopaedic care remotely/virtually or in acuity-appropriate sites of care in relation to purported disease exposure and transmission. Additionally, older orthopaedic surgeons can continue to play a vital role in other ways, including systems management, leadership, acute orthopaedic surgical care provision, resident education, and clinical and epidemiology-focused research in order to serve the orthopaedic community safely. While the high proportion of orthopaedic surgeons \u202160 years of age may prove problematic during the COVID-19 pandemic, there are further implications for workforce management and patient access to care in the future because of the aging of this demographic group and a potentially critical gap in the total number of practicing orthopaedic surgeons in the U.S. 21 . Current orthopaedic practices should continue to develop and implement ways of reducing virus transmission among members of their care team, and we must advocate for protecting those who are most vulnerable to disease. n ",
