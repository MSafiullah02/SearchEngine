Simon had emigrated from Sweden to Minnesota, and in 1898 he built a farmhouse there for his new bride, not long before Selma gave birth to their first child, Ella. She was just 17 when their first child arrived. Many more children followed. Seven more arrived in the coming years, including Ralph, Lester, Carrie, Ted, Florence, Elmer, and Alvin (Fig. 16-1\n). It was a hard life filled with long days of difficult work. As their family grew, Selma had her older children, Ella and Ralph, to help with the chores.",

The holidays were approaching and with the signing of the armistice ending World War I, peace was on the horizon. Though the \u201cGreat War\u201d was ending, a new battle was emerging. It would eventually kill far more people than any war in history. The influenza pandemic of 1918\u20131919 became the worst influenza outbreak in modern history, infecting about one-third of the global population (Burnet and Clark, 1942, Frost, 1920). The case\u2013fatality rate for most influenza pandemics is generally less than 0.1%. However, the 1918 influenza strain had case\u2013fatality rates estimated to be greater than 2.5% (Marks and Beatty, 1976, Rosenau and Last, 1980). As a result, the global death estimates from this pandemic are about 50 million (Johnson and Mueller, 2002).\n",

The infection swept through the family, sickening the parents and all eight children. Those who were less ill cared for the others. The eldest daughter, 19-year-old Ella, took care of her father and the other children, while her mother Selma and one of her brothers maintained the farm. In late November, 13-year-old Lester died, followed 5 days later by his 40-year-old father, Simon. The children were given little time to say goodbye to their brother and father. Their bodies were placed in wooden coffins and hastily buried by the local undertaker. Selma became a single mother at the age of 36. She and the surviving children, ranging in age from 1 to 19 years, were left to carry on in that chilling Minnesota winter (CDC, 2006a). These kinds of losses played out millions of times around the world in 1918 and 1919 and left countless legacies of suffering and courage, the depth and breadth of which will never be fully known.",

The amount of change can be subtle or dramatic, but eventually as drift occurs, a new variant strain becomes dominant. This process allows influenza viruses to change and reinfect people repeatedly through their lifetime and is the reason influenza virus strains in vaccine must be updated each year.Antigenic shiftProcess in which the existing H (hemagglutinin) and N (neuraminidase) are replaced by significantly different H and Ns. These new H or H/N combinations are perceived by human immune systems as new, so most individuals do not have preexisting antibody protection to novel viral strains. This is one of the reasons pandemic viruses can have such a severe impact on the health of populations.AntiviralDrug used to prevent or cure a disease caused by a virus by interfering with the ability of the virus to multiply or spread from cell to cell.\nAsymptomaticInfected but presenting no symptoms of disease.Avian influenza (also AI or bird flu)A highly contagious viral disease with up to 100% mortality in domestic fowl caused by influenza A virus subtypes H5 and H7 (see Hemagglutinin). Low-pathogenic AI causes few problems and is carried by many birds with no resulting problems. Highly pathogenic AI kills birds and if transmitted to humans, can also be fatal. There is little or no human immunity, however humans are rarely affected.Community-based measuresActivities to increase social distance that may include measures applied to whole neighborhoods, towns, or cities (eg, snow days, establishment of clinics, and community-wide quarantine).Containment measuresMeasures taken to control disease exposure at specific sites or buildings that may include cancellation of public events (eg, concerts, sports events, and movies), closure of office buildings, apartment complexes, or schools, and closure of public transit systems. These measures can also involve restricting entrance to buildings or other sites (eg, requiring fever screening or use of face masks before entry).EpidemicDisease occurring suddenly in humans in a community, region, or country in numbers clearly in excess of a typical presentation of the disease.H5N1Variant of avian influenza, which is a type of influenza virulent in birds. H5N1 was first identified in Italy in the early 1900s and is now known to exist worldwide. Both low and highly pathogenic variants exist in different regions of the world.HemagglutininImportant surface structure protein of the influenza virus. Hemagglutinin is an essential gene for the spread of the virus throughout the respiratory tract that enables the virus to attach itself to a cell in the respiratory system and penetrate it. Hemagglutinin is referred to as the \u201cH\u201d in influenza viruses (eg, H1N1). See also \u201cNeuraminidase.\u201dHPAIHighly pathogenic form of avian influenza. Avian flu viruses are classified based upon the severity of the illness and HPAI is extremely infectious among humans. The rapid spread of HPAI, with outbreaks occurring at the same time, is of growing concern for human health as well as for animal health. See also \u201cLPAI.\u201dInfluenzaSerious viral disease caused by influenza viruses that infect the respiratory tract.IsolationState of physical separation and restriction of movement between persons or groups to prevent the spread of disease. Isolation measures can be undertaken in hospitals or homes, as well as in alternative facilities.LPAILow pathogenic form of avian influenza. Most avian flu strains are classified as LPAI and typically cause little to no clinical signs in infected birds. However, some LPAI virus strains are capable of mutating under field conditions into HPAI viruses. See HPAI.MutationAny alteration in a gene from its original natural state. This change may be disease causing or a benign, normal variant.NeuraminidaseImportant surface structure protein of the influenza virus. Neuraminidase is an essential enzyme for the spread of the virus throughout the respiratory tract that enables the virus to escape the host cell and infect new cells. Neuraminidase is referred to as the \u201cN\u201d in influenza viruses (eg, H1N1). See also \u201cHemagglutinin.\u201dPandemicWorldwide outbreak of a disease in humans with case numbers clearly in excess of normal.PathogenicCausing or capable of causing disease.Prepandemic vaccineVaccine created to protect against currently circulating H5N1 avian influenza virus strains with the expectation it would provide at least some protection against new virus strains that might evolve.ProphylacticPharmaceutical or a procedure with properties capable of prevention or protection against a disease or condition (eg, vaccines, antibiotics).QuarantineTime period of physical separation or restriction of movement decreed to control the spread of disease. Before the era of antibiotics, quarantine was one of the few available means of halting the spread of infectious disease. Quarantine is still used today as needed. Individuals may be quarantined at home or in designated facilities.\nSeasonal fluRespiratory illness caused by the influenza virus transmitted from person to person. Most individuals have some immunity, and a vaccine is available. Seasonal flu is also known as the common flu or winter flu.VirusOne of the many simple, submicroscopic infectious agents of plants, animals, and bacteria that causes disease. Viruses consist essentially of a core of RNA or DNA surrounded by a protein coat. Unable to replicate without a host cell, viruses are typically not considered living organisms.Widespread or community-wide quarantineRefers to the closing of community borders or the erection of a real or virtual barrier around a geographic area (a cordon sanitaire) with prohibition of travel into or out of the area.\n",

            "text": "Influenza pandemics occur when a dramatic reassortment of the genetic structure of the virus makes it unrecognizable to the human immune system. Throughout the past century there were four pandemics: 1918, 1957, 1968, and 2009 (Cox and Subbarao, 2000). The severity of seasonal or pandemic influenza is caused by the genetic structure of the virus. There are three types of influenza viruses: A, B, and C. Influenza A is the most dangerous for humans and influenza C is the least dangerous. The specific structure of the influenza virus is expressed by the proteins it carries. Hemagglutinin proteins of the virus are the components that enable the virus to penetrate a foreign body. There are 16 different hemagglutinin proteins possible. Neuraminidase is another key protein of the virus. Neuraminidase has nine protein varieties. These two proteins are the defining factors for each strain of influenza and are the basis for the \u201cH_N_\u201d designation. For example, there have been concerns over H5N1 as a potential candidate for a future influenza pandemic. Another terminology used in discussing the various strains of viruses refers to the pathogenicity in animals. Influenza virus strains are referred to as being either low pathogenic or high pathogenic. For several years, a low-pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) H5N1 strain has been present in North America, while there has been a highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 strain present in Asia (Badae et al., 2013; Inamasu et al., 2012; Manning, 2006).",

            "text": "Influenza symptoms typically include fever, muscle pain, runny nose, and cough. Those who die from seasonal influenza frequently have chronic medical conditions or weaker immune systems and die from secondary illnesses such as pneumonia. The primary differences during an influenza pandemic are the disease severity and the populations affected (see Table 16-1\n). Not only will the case\u2013fatality ratio be excessive during a pandemic, but often those most severely affected are different demographically. In the 2009\u20132010 influenza A H1N1 pandemic, a study of 100 deaths revealed a high incidence of viral pneumonia and diffuse alveolar damage. These findings were similar to other findings in influenza outbreaks but different than \u201ctypical\u201d seasonal influenza deaths (Sheih et al., 2010). There were also a higher incidence of deaths in patients with morbid obesity, pregnancy, and sleep apnea. Rather than populations with weaker immune systems having more severe illness, those with healthier immune systems can be more susceptible. When the human immune system is fighting an infection, cytokines are responsible for activating the immune functions and also stimulating production of more cytokines. It is a looped system that keeps the immune system balanced to fight illness effectively while minimizing damage to healthy cells. Some highly pathogenic strains of influenza produce a \u201ccytokine storm\u201d where cytokines and immune cells become hyperstimulated and damage the healthy cells of an infected respiratory tract. During the 1918 pandemic, many individuals between the ages of 18 and 40 with healthier immune systems had more severe illness due to cytokine stimulation. As the immune system began damaging the healthy cells of the respiratory tract, it led to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (Kobasa et al., 2004, Osterholm, 2005). ARDS killed many within several days. Others succumbed over a longer period of time due to secondary bacterial infections of the lungs. These infections were ushered in by viral damage to the epithelial cells of the respiratory tract. Although the epithelial cells usually sweep the respiratory tract clean, as they are damaged by influenza viruses, bacteria from the mouth can make their way down the respiratory tract and cause secondary illnesses.",

The first shipments of vaccine to leave those facilities would take several months to develop. Some vaccine is cultured in eggs using a time-consuming process (Morse et al., 2006). This production schedule cannot be changed using the current technologies and manufacturing approaches. Newer flu vaccine production methods include a cell-based approach approved in the United States by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2012. The first approved cell-culture flu vaccine was called Flucelvax. Instead of incubating eggs, vaccine viruses are cultured mammalian cells, purified and tested for use in vaccine. In most cases, to achieve necessary immunity with any inactivated virus, two doses are necessary to activate and sustain an immune response. The newest and fastest process uses recombinant technology. Approved in 2013 under the name, Flublok, the recombinant vaccine is one produced without using egg products or actual virus. Instead, Flublok uses an influenza virus protein made through genetic modification of a virus that infects insect cells. The virus produces an influenza protein that stimulates the immune response (FDA, 2015).",

Gilmour and Hofmann (2010) also found nearly three-quarters of those who had not been vaccinated reported they did not think it was necessary. Delays in vaccine distribution and delivery, relying on specialty care physicians for vaccinations (other than obstetricians) and a longer pandemic locally decreased vaccine rates (Davila-Payan et al., 2014).

The primary nonpharmaceutical intervention is hand washing. It is the most effective, most underrated measure to prevent illness. Isolation of those who are sick from those who are healthy is another fundamental nonpharmaceutical measure. Isolating sick patients in hospitals or at home should be undertaken with appropriate personal protective equipment if available. During a pandemic, hospitals may be full, and many who are able to care for themselves, or who have an adequate support system to provide care, should isolate themselves from others to reduce the risk of additional virus transmission. There are also those who are not yet ill but may have been exposed to the virus. These individuals may choose self-quarantine. Others with no illness or known exposure may choose social distancing by not attending social functions, limiting time in crowds, and/or wearing protective face masks.

These pandemic phases provide a global snapshot of a pandemic based upon the monitoring of virological, epidemiological, and clinical data. The phase determination is one of three pandemic preparedness and response tools used by the WHO to communicate and coordinate a pandemic response. The WHO director-general can also declare a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) or issue a Pandemic Declaration. Each of these declarations is accompanied by temporary recommendations or regulatory actions for member states (WHO, 2013).1.Interpandemic: The period between pandemics where WHO and member states support preparedness activities and capacity development.\n2.Alert: Issued when a new influenza subtype with pandemic potential is identified. Global influenza risk assessments are carried out according to international health regulations. Member states are asked to increase overall vigilance and initiate advisory groups and partner networks. Antiviral measures may be staged and prepared for use to control the introduction and spread of a novel virus.3.Pandemic: Issued when a novel influenza strain spreads globally. Risk assessments are accomplished using virologic, epidemiologic, and clinical data. A pandemic is declared and responses are initiated by member states and supported by WHO based upon a global risk assessment.4.Transition: Global risk drops, prompting stepdowns in global actions and response activities. Based upon ongoing global risk assessments, responses are scaled and consideration is given to modify or terminate the PHEIC.\n",

This facilitates better federal, state, and local planning and enhances response coordination. The CDC framework has six defined intervals (Fig. 16-11\n):1.Investigation Interval: A novel influenza virus with the potential to be a human health threat is identified and investigated anywhere in the world.\n2.Recognition Interval: A novel influenza virus displays potential for ongoing human-to-human transmission. This may include increasing numbers or clusters of human cases.3.Initiation Interval: The virus displays efficient and sustained human-to-human transmission. This is most apparent in institutional or family outbreak attack rates (>20%) and in the number of transmission generations (3 or more linked cases).4.Acceleration Interval: Consistently increasing influenza cases demonstrating established disease transmission.5.Deceleration Interval: Consistently decreasing influenza cases demonstrating the pandemic has passed its peak and is no longer accelerating.6.Preparation Interval: Low numbers of influenza cases resulting in scaling back response activities, focusing on recovery and preparation for subsequent waves.\n",

The strategy to accomplish this is to institute community measures to delay and compress the outbreak peak (see Fig. 16-8). As interventions are instituted, some cases of illness will be delayed and others prevented. As a result, the cases in a given region can be spread over a longer period of time.

No intervention is without some economic or social cost. If individuals are isolated or quarantined, and there is no support system in place to provide essentials such as groceries and prescriptions, or services such as child care for ill parents of small children, there can be social disruption in addition to extended health effects. Economic protection measures may need to be considered to allow those who are ill to work from home or at least to have some assurance taking sick days will not result in job loss. A variety of consequences must also be considered when closing schools and day care centers or when discouraging public gatherings. Children are at increased risk of influenza transmission in both preschool contacts and school-age contacts. Viboud et al. (2004) found there was also an increased risk in contacts exposed to preschool index patients and school-age index patients compared with those exposed to adult index cases. However, there are substantial economic and social outcomes to school-related measures. If children are not in school or day care, some parents will be unable to work. Parents are also likely to congregate children who have been kept out of school in order to have child care and to provide a diversion for the children, thereby negating the desired social distancing. If mass transit and congregate gatherings are discouraged, a variety of industries will suffer. Social distancing interventions may be important to public health but must be used judiciously. If the impact is seen as too severe, the political and social consequences may be too burdensome and the public may not comply. On the other hand, if interventions are established too late, they may be ineffective.Nonpharmaceutical Intervention Examples\n1.Isolation of the sick at home or in healthcare settings. Limiting visitors especially those from high-risk groups (young, elderly, and those with chronic illnesses).2.Voluntary quarantine of households with confirmed or probable influenza.3.Closure of daycares, K\u201312 schools, colleges, and congregate institutions.

If there are substantial numbers of adult losses, the secondary impact may be the loss of primary caregivers for children in some urban communities. If the losses are more among the working population, there are essential businesses and services that may be short-handed and unable to perform indispensable functions. This inoperability will result in a long-term economic ripple as production decreases, investment capital is diminished and further production is reduced. The healthcare sector is particularly vulnerable because healthcare workers will be repeatedly exposed. The system may suffer excessive losses, compromising the availability of staff or the standard of care. Even when the pandemic has resolved, critical infrastructure may take some time to fully recover. There are many unknowns in predicting what special challenges may result from a pandemic, making it critically important to push forward in the planning, training, and exercising of processes to include the recovery component addressing these possibilities.
