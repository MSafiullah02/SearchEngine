On March 11, 2020 the World Health Organization declared SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, considering the over 118,000 cases of the coronavirus illness in over 110 countries around the world (World Health Organization, 2020). The first case of SARS-CoV-2 infection in Northern Italy was assessed on 7 February, 2020 in a Chinese subject recently returned from Wuhan, but the infection has become epidemic in Northern Italy since February 21, 2020, when autochthonous cases have been identified (Spiteri et al., 2020) .

            "text": "February 25 th 2020 after fever 38\u00b0C and vomiting at home; at the hospital admission, he showed only a mild leukopenia, fever 37.5 \u00b0C, pharyngeal hyperemia and inflammation of the upper respiratory tract and no signs and symptoms of pneumonia, with normal serum inflammation markers. Based on this clinical picture an infection of the upper respiratory tract was postulated making radiographs unnecessary. No suspicion and no specific risk factors of SARS-CoV-2 infection was formulated, as the virus was not yet spread to Parma province. In order to assess the presence of respiratory bacteria and/or viruses, a nasopharyngeal aspirate, a nasal swab and a pharyngeal swab were sent to the Microbiology and Virology Units of the same hospital. The nasal swab and the pharyngeal swab resulted positive for Staphylococcus aureus. The nasopharyngeal aspirate was tested: (i) by immunofluorescence assay (IFA) to detect Respiratory Syncytial virus antigens directly in sample exfoliated cells; (ii) by the same technique after a 24 hour-incubation of Allplex\u2122 Respiratory Panels assay (Seegene INC., Seoul, Korea). All the above mentioned tests gave negative results. In parallel, the same sample was inoculated in cell monolayers for the detection of cytopathogenic respiratory viral agents (De Conto et al., 2019). Upon daily microscopic observation, a cytopathic effect was detected in VERO and LLC-MK2 cells at day 10 post-infection (Figure 1 A-D). As a first identification level, electron microscopy of the inoculated cell supernatants after 1% formaldehyde inactivation, ultracentrifugation and negative staining according to standard procedures (Calderaro et al., 2014), enabled the detection of viral particles belonging to the Coronaviridae family (Figure 1E). Subsequently, a real-time RT-PCR assay for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid was performed according to the protocol of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention of Atlanta, USA, which confirmed the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA at a low cycle threshold (N gene, 15.43 for VERO cell extract; N gene, 15.51 for LLC-MK2 cell extract). The concomitant presence of other respiratory viruses was excluded by applying the same, above mentioned, molecular assay on the inoculated VERO and LLC-MK2 cell extracts. According to the naming convention proposed by the Coronaviridae Study Group of the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (Coronaviridae Study Group of the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses, 2020), the cell culture isolate was named: SARS-Cov-2/human/Parma/1/2020. The presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA was assessed by the real-time RT-PCR assay retrospectively performed on the aliquot of nasopharyngeal aspirate of the same patient stored at -80\u00b0C.",

Moreover, this result could allow to improve diagnosis using innovative tools such as the Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry assay for respiratory viruses (Calderaro et al., 2016). Furthermore, the cultivability of this agent also provides a precious tool to obtain large virus amounts for further studies, such as experimental trials for the development of new antiviral drugs and comparative genomic analyses with the SARS-CoV-2 viral strains isolated from the adult and paediatric population of different places in order to contribute to understand differences, if any, helping to know why young people are mildly affected.
