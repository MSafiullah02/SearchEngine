Previous studies on HPIV-4 have reached varying conclusions about its clinical relevance. Some reports suggest that HPIV-4 has minimal clinical impact, whereas others find associations with significant illnesses [7, 11, 12, 14]. Most of these studies have had small sample sizes, did not exclude patients with concurrent viral infections, did not use sensitive detection methods, or relied on laboratory-developed PCRs that may have different performance characteristics [10, 12, 14\u201316]. Due to the large number of patients included in our study without any known coinfections, we were able to ascertain several clinical features of the virus. HPIV-4 was the only HPIV that did not cause croup. HPIV-4, along with HPIV-3, was associated with hypoxia, lower respiratory tract infections, abnormal radiographic findings, abnormal lung findings, and neurologic presentation. This is well demonstrated in the literature for HPIV-3 and has been suggested for HPIV-4, although minimal data are available [7, 11\u201316]. In agreement with other studies, we found an association of HPIV-1\u20134 with febrile seizures in otherwise healthy children [19]. CRP was mildly elevated for both HPIV-3 and -4. Elevated CRP has been reported with HPIV infection, although not for specific HPIV types [3]. There was an increased incidence of otitis media in HPIV-4; however, numbers were low. Patients with HPIV-4 had similar admission rates and mortality as those with HPIV-1\u20133.",

HPIV-2 has previously been suggested to have biennial, annual, or biannual peaks, with most studies limited by sample size [2, 12, 18]. HPIV-3 also showed biannual peaks. Previous studies have reported that HPIV-3 tends to peak annually in spring; however, in years when HPIV-1 is low, HPIV-3 may show an extended season or have an additional autumn peak [18, 20, 21]. We were able to appreciate this relationship between HPIV-1 and HPIV-3. The autumn of 2009 represented an exceptionally high peak of HPIV likely secondary to increased testing during the 2009 influenza A(H1N1) outbreak.",

Use of rapid and sensitive diagnostic testing such as PCR for respiratory viruses has the potential to limit additional diagnostic studies and decrease the use of antibiotics in children. Previous studies have suggested that for children without underlying medical conditions, rapid testing for viral respiratory pathogens does not change diagnostic testing, admission rates, length of stay, or antibiotic use [24\u201327]. However, many of these tests were not rapid enough to impact clinical care, and rapid diagnostic testing, such as rapid PCR, may be more useful in directing diagnostic testing and treatment in medically complex patients, although its role has not been fully explored.",
