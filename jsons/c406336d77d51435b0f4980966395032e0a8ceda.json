            "text": "Modern supply chains are very complex, with physical, financial, and information flows occurring simultaneously in order to ensure that products are delivered in the right quantities, to the right place in a cost-effective manner. Maintaining uninterrupted supply chain flows is a prerequisite for the success of a supply chain in the marketplace. But there are always associated risks in each of these flows which require suitable strategies to mitigate them. The issue of risks in supply chains has assumed importance in wake of the understanding that supply chain failures are fatal to the existence of all the partners' in a supply chain. The severity of supply chain failures are more felt by small and medium enterprises (SMEs) who form the majority at tier II and tier III levels of a supply chain. This is because of the limited resources and lack of adequate planning to counter supply chain risks. Management of risk in supply chains is a multi-criteria decision making problem. The research presented in this chapter proposes a Fuzzy-AHP based framework to prioritize various risks in supply chains. An exhaustive literature review complimented with the experts' opinion was undertaken from the perspective of SMEs to formulate a hierarchical structure of risks in supply chains. A fuzzy analytic hierarchical process (F-AHP) is then utilized to ascertain the relative weightings which are subsequently used to prioritize these risks. Understanding the priorities would help the firms to accord importance and develop suitable strategies to manage supply chain risks according to their relative importance. This provides effective management of scarce resources available to SMEs to manage risks resident in their supply chains.",

The consequences of failing to manage risk have also become more severe. In addition to the direct impact on revenue and profit, disruptions in supply or demand can hurt a firm's trading partners (e.g. customers and suppliers), since the interconnectedness of a supply chain has a ripple effect that affects the entire supply chain ecosystem (Shi, 2004) . It is also reported that companies experiencing such disruptions under-perform their peers significantly in stock performance as well as in operating performance as reflected in costs, sales, and profits Singhal, 2003, 2005) . Thus, management of risk is, or should be, a core issue in the planning and management of any organization (Finch, 2004) .",

In industries moving towards seamless supply chains the issue of supply chain risk handling and risk sharing along the supply chain is a topic of growing importance (Agrell, 2004; Gunasekaran et al., 2004) . A key feature of supply chain risk is that, by definition, it extends beyond the boundaries of the single firm and, moreover, the boundary spanning flows can become a source of supply chain risks (J\u00fcttner, 2005) . Thus, to assess supply chain risk exposures, companies must identify not only direct risks to their operations, but also the potential causes or sources of those risks at every significant link along the supply chain Souter, 2000) .

In recent times the complexity has increased many-fold due to firms' focus on their core competence and increased dependence on outsourcing. Top executives at Global 1000 firms now consider supply chain disruptions and their associated operational and financial risks to be their single most pressing concern (Craighead et al., 2007). Risk management in supply chain cannot be equated to disaster response. Rather, it means keeping an increasingly complex process moving efficiently at the lowest total cost and without compromising the quality of the product or customer satisfaction (Hauser, 2003) . Supply chain risk management (SCRM) is defined as \"the process of risk mitigation achieved through collaboration, co-ordination and application of risk management tools among the partners, to ensure continuity coupled with long term profitability of the supply chain\" (Faisal et al., 2007a) . SCRM is still a fairly new field of research and studies related to the topic are scarce (Ojala and Hallikas, 2006; J\u00fcttner, 2005) . It should also be noted that risks cannot be completely eliminated from supply chains but strategies can be developed to manage these risks if the dynamics between the variables related to risks in a supply chain are understood (Faisal et al., 2006) . It is important for supply chain managers to recognize that in taking action to reduce known risks, they are changing the risk profile for that organization and for others in the network (Peck, 2005) . Thus, for mitigating risk in supply chains it is required to expend the risk management focus from the companies' own sites to suppliers and sub-suppliers. There is a need to work together in risk identification, assessment, management and business continuity planning and also of formal assessment of how suppliers are working with those issues and by putting requirements into contracts (Normann and Jansson, 2004). Risk management skills which includes, awareness of risk signals, developing risk management plans, and improving end to end information visibility are essential requirements for supply chain management success (Giunipero and Pearcy, 2000; Christopher and Lee, 2004) . While revisiting single-sourcing decisions and changing inventory management policies will likely help maintain continuity during future crises, experts have clearly demonstrated, and logistics managers have candidly admitted, that firms need to vastly improve their disaster management planning for managing risk in supply chains (Hale and Moberg, 2005 ).",

Rather, they should prioritize these 18 best practices as some of these actions can be taken with a minimal level of investment and should yield immediate benefits. There should be a plan that identifies the short-term actions that can he deployed with a minimum of investment and establish a roadmap for deploying intensive project-team resources, business intelligence systems, and improved supply chain infrastructure. SAM framework (Kleindorfer and Saad, 2005) for supply chain risk management comprise three main tasks that have to be practiced continuously and concurrently as the foundation of disruption risk management. The three tasks are: Specifying sources of risk and vulnerabilities, Assessment, and Mitigation (SAM). Further, to implement the three SAM tasks introduced above, the authors have formulated a set of 10 principles, derived from the industrial risk management and supply chain literatures.

The literature in the risk management field indicates that the primary sources of risk to the business organization may be categorized into exogenous and endogenous (Ritchie and Brindley, 2000) . In a supply chain, risks can be classified into two types: risks arising from within the supply chain network and risks external to it. For the former, the attributes are due to the interaction between firms across the entire supply chain network. This set of internal risks can encompass supply risk, demand risk, and trade credit risk for instance. External risks, on the other hand, arise from the interactions between the supply chain network and its environment, such as international terrorism, and natural disasters like SARS ( (2005) risks in supply chains are classified under four sub-chains, physical, financial, informational, and relational. Physical sub-chain, represent traditionally viewed logistics, in the form of transportation, warehousing, handling, processing, manufacturing, and other forms of utility activities. Financial sub-chain working in parallel deals with the supply chain's flow of money while informational sub-chains parallel the physical and financial chains through the processes and electronic systems used for creating events and triggered product movements and service mobilization. Relational sub-chains relate to the chosen linkages between buyers, sellers, and logistics parties in between them.",

Traditionally, most of the earlier definitions of risk in supply chains found in literature took only the physical flow of goods into consideration (Spekman and Davis, 2004). Many of the risk in the physical flow are difficult to anticipate and consequently formal risk management approaches fails to mitigate them. Prominent among this class are those risk which have a low probability of occurrence but high impact like disruption risks. Supplier capacity constraint is a form of risk in physical sub-chain. Constraints exist that restrict a supplier's ability to make rapid changes to varying demands (Zsidisin et al., 2000) . Risk in physical sub-chain can also exist in form of fluctuations of demand, such as those caused by the \"bullwhip effect\" and may tax a supplier beyond its abilities. A supplier may not have extra equipment, available employees, or the ability to obtain necessary inputs to handle rapid spurts in demand. On the other hand, it may also be difficult for suppliers to utilize excess \"slack\" during order declines, which makes it difficult to attain profits from excess capacity. Phys-ical sub-chain is also impacted by quality-related risks that can cause significant detrimental effects on the purchasing organization, with a cascading effect through the supply chain to the final consumers. Each link within a supply chain is dependent on the other links to meet product or service requirements. Quality failures can stem from the failure of suppliers to maintain capital equipment, lack of supplier training in quality principles and techniques, and damage that occurs in transit (Zsidisin et al., 2000) . Risks in physical sub-chain may be further classified as shown Table 4 .2. ",

Financial risks also include factors like settlement process disruption, improper investments, and not bringing cost transparency to the overall supply chain (Cavinato, 2004) . In case of strategic alliances the risk of financial stability of alliance partners is crucial for supply chain success (Giunipero and Eltantawy, 2004) . According to Peck (2005) , managing risks in financial sub-chain is not an easy task as disruptions due to macroeconomic vacillations like currency fluctuations or due to strained relations among nations are difficult to predict and are beyond the direct control of supply chain managers and business strategists. A better understanding of the causal relationship between supply chain performance and financial measures is critical to both supply chain and financial managers (Tsai, 2008) . Financial risks can also present themselves through the risk of reworking stock and penalties for non-delivery of goods (Christopher and Lee, 2004) . When a firm has operations in multiple countries, changes in foreign exchange rates can have a significant impact on both the income statement and the balance sheet. Price changes for commodities such as oil and electricity can have an impact on supply chain costs and price changes for commodities like steel and copper can affect the cost of goods sold. Labor-intensive enterprises in many developing countries have felt great pressure from the rise of labor-related costs, such as wages and costs to improve working conditions. A January 2006 report by American Chamber of Commerce in China found that rising labor costs significantly decreased margins in 48% of U.S. manufacturers in China (Jiang et al., 2007) . Changing economic scenario in key markets are also a major source of risk in financial sub-chain e.g. recent recession in US economy has severely dented the profit margins of many of the firms in India that used to have major chunk of their products being exported to US markets. Major risks in financial sub-chain are represented in Table 4 .3.",

In addition to this, AHP is easier to understand and can effectively handle both qualitative and quantitative data (Dur\u00e1n and Aguilo, 2008) . The AHP attracted the interest of many researchers for long because of its easy applicability and interesting mathematical properties (Sasamal and Ramanjaneyulu, 2008). AHP involves the principles of decomposition, pair wise comparisons, and priority vector generation and synthesis. Though the purpose of AHP is to capture the expert's knowledge, the conventional AHP still cannot reflect the human thinking style. In spite of its popularity, this method is often criticized because of a series of pitfalls associated with the AHP technique which can be summarized as follows (Dur\u00e1n and Aguilo, 2008 ):",

Due to the fact that uncertainty should be considered in some or all of the pairwise comparison values, the pairwise comparison under traditional AHP, which needs to select arbitrary values in the process, may not be appropriate (Yu, 2002) . Thus the use of fuzzy numbers and linguistic terms may be more suitable, and the fuzzy theory in AHP should be more appropriate and effective than traditional AHP in an uncertain pairwise comparison environment (Kang and Lee, 2007) . Fuzzy set theory bears a resemblance to the logical behavior of human brain when faced with imprecision (Cakir and Canbolat, 2008) . It has the advantage of mathematically representing uncertainty and vagueness and provides formalized tools for dealing with the imprecision intrinsic to many problems (Chan and Kumar, 2007) . Although the purpose of the original AHP was to capture expert knowledge, conventional AHP did not truly reflect human cognitive processes-especially in the context of problems that were not fully defined and/or problems involving uncertain data (so-called \"fuzzy\" problems) (Fu et al., 2006) . Laarhoven and Pedrycz (1983) therefore introduced the concept of \"fuzzy theory\" to AHP assessments. This socalled \"fuzzy analytic hierarchical process\" (fuzzy AHP) was able to solve uncertain \"fuzzy\" problems and to rank excluded factors according to their weight ratios. The research presented in this chapter prefers Chang's extent analysis method (Chang 1992 (Chang , 1996 since the steps of this approach are relatively easier than the other fuzzy AHP approaches and similar to the conventional AHP B\u00fcy\u00fck\u00f6zkan, 2008; Chan and Kumar, 2007) . Fuzzy-AHP has been widely used for prioritization purposes like prioritization of organizational capital , key capabilities in technology management (Erensal et al., 2006) , prioritization of human capital measurement indicators , adoption of electronic marketplaces (Fu et al., 2006) , and supply base reduction (Sarkar and Mohapatra, 2006) .",

(2008) is adopted in this chapter. The scale is depicted in Fig. 4 .2 and the corresponding explanations are provided in Table 4 .4. Figure 4 .2 shows the triangular fuzzy numbers M = (l; m; u/ where l \u00c4 m \u00c4 u, l and ustand for the lower and upper value of the support of M , respectively, and m is the mid-value of M . Similar to the importance scale defined in Saaty's classical AHP (Saaty, 1980) , five main linguistic terms are used to compare the criteria: \"equal importance (EI)\", \"moderate importance (MI)\", \"strong importance (SI)\", \"very strong importance (VSI)\" and \"demonstrated importance (DI)\". Further, their reciprocals: \"equal unimportance (EUI)\", \"moderate unimportance (MUI)\", \"strong unimportance (SUI)\", \"very strong unimportance (VSUI)\" and \"demonstrated unimportance (DUI)\" have also been considered. For instance, if criterion A is evaluated \"strongly important\" than criterion B, then this answer means that criterion B is \"strongly unimportant\" than criterion A. Adapted from B\u00fcy\u00fck\u00f6zkan (2008) The proposed model was evaluated for small and medium enterprises (SMEs) cluster. A group of experts consisting of academics and professionals were asked to make pairwise comparisons for the sub-chains and their related risks mentioned in Sect. 4.5. A questionnaire (see Appendix A) is provided to get the evaluations. The overall results could be obtained by taking the geometric mean of individual It is observed that for the physical sub-chain poor quality, capacity inflexibility, transportation risks, product technological changes are more important than other risks.",
