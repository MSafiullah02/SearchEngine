The model is investigated with numerical simulation that demonstrates the importance of quick measure in identifying the infected and the subsequent quarantine of his/her neighbors. The model also provides a theoretical framework for the estimation of the cost involved in the containment of the epidemics. Based on a general estimate of the cost, we demonstrate the procedure for the calculation of the optimal set of parameters in our isolation and quarantine strategy through numerical simulation on a model social network. We find an important parameter \u03c0 which is a combination of several general parameters for the SIR model so that when \u03c0 > 0, the isolation and quarantine strategy will fail to contain the outbreak. The procedure outlined provides some general guidance in the selection of strategies in the containment of real epidemics, where the balance between social cost and risk must be carefully handled.",

The effectiveness of this measure is determined by the strength and the efficiency of the practice. Typically, the time taken to identify and to isolate those infected and the imposed quarantine period [14, 2, 6, 12] are the two most commonly used parameters in the execution of the strategy of containment. One generally expects that a very conservative and strict quarantine strategy is likely to contain the spreading. However, in the process of the implementation, the issues involving ethical, legal and socioeconomic concern [7, 8] must be properly addressed to avoid excessive measures in the isolation and quarantine at an unacceptable social cost. Here we seek a general model to describe the mathematical consequence of slow identification of the infected (large time delay for isolation) and the short quarantine period, thereby deriving a general guideline for the calculation of the optimal time delay (not the shortest) and the proper quarantine period (not too long but sufficient to contain the epidemics). The social network is modeled by a random network for simplicity [3] . In the random network, any two nodes are linked with a constant probability p equal to the average degree over the number of nodes (p = k /N). However, the procedure outlined in our simulation can be applied to others networks, in particular the real social network if known. We show with an example the general methodology in the computation of the optimal set of parameters by balancing the cost and the effectiveness of quarantine.",

Assuming that the virus is mildly pathogenic but highly contagious, we apply a quarantine strategy to control the outbreak. After a time delay T I , an infected individual is identified and will be isolated and his/her nearest neighbors will also be quarantined and released after T Q days. We simulated the various outbreak patterns in the parameter space of T I and T Q to evaluate the effectiveness of different quarantine criteria. The data shown in Fig.2 (b-d) are averaged data over 500 simulations for each set of input parameters (T I , T Q ). The cost for the isolation of the infected is assumed to be twice the cost of the quarantine for his/her neighbors: total cost is proportional to \u03bcI + Q. In Fig.2a , when T I is small, (T I = 2, 3 days), the outbreak can be contained in the first 50 days, with the total number of infected minimized. However, when the time involved in identifying the infected, which is equivalent in our model to the time de-lay in the isolation of the infected goes above 4, (T I > 4), we have \u03c0 > 0 and the outbreak cannot be contained. If the quarantine period is constant, for example 4 days, the isolation measure will help to limit the transmission of virus and mitigate the outbreak. The more efficient the isolation, (in our model this is represented by a short time T I ), the smaller the scale of the outbreak.

We see that generally the scale of the outbreak decreases with the quarantine period, which is common sense. Fig.2c shows that the ratio of the number of quarantined and infected steadily increases with the quarantined period, which means high percentage of healthy individuals are under quarantine, thus to strengthen the quarantine measure and mitigate the outbreak. This is quite reasonable. However, a long quarantine period may be too costly to be implemented.

Also, we must remember that the cost changes for the viruses with different virulence. Thus, the first step in any control measure is to identify the virus. Now, let's assume that virus has been identified. We can then illustrate the method of computation as follow. If we assume that the ratio of the cost per infected individual over the cost per quarantined individual is \u03bc, then the social cost will be proportional to \u03bcI + Q, where I is the number of infected individual and Q is the number of individuals quarantined. Since both I and Q can be counted in our numerical simulation, we can estimate the social cost involved for given \u03bc, and the two parameters in our strategy: T I and T Q . Thus, for each given \u03bc, we can obtain a three dimensional plot of social cost versus T I and T Q . An example for the optimal quarantine period is shown in Fig.2d for \u03bc = 2. The optimal quarantine period that achieves the minimum social cost (for \u03bc = 2) can be numerically obtained for a given T I . This optimal period T Q is shown in Fig. 2d . Thus, for an assumed value of \u03bc and time delay T I , one can follow this procedure of estimating the optimal period for quarantine. Usually, the ratio \u03bc is difficult to estimate and require more social studies. However, the time delay parameter T I can be readily obtained based on data of outbreaks in the past. Consequently, one can estimate the optimal period of quarantine as a function of social cost \u03bc through our model, based on known input value of T I .",

Since time is always needed to find the infected individual, there is always a time delay in his/her isolation. This time delay parameter, T I , should be as short as possible in order to contain the outbreak at its initial stage. Nevertheless, T I can not be zero since instantaneous identification is technically impossible. We therefore incorporate this finite T I in our model and consider the effectiveness of various periods of quarantine in the containment of the outbreak. From our mathematical model, we find a critical parameter \u03c0 that provides an indicator to measure the efficiency of a quarantine policy in the limitation and containment of an outbreak. For \u03c0 > 0, the outbreak can not be contained with simple quarantine measure, though quarantine can still re-duce the scale of the outbreak. For \u03c0 < 0, the measure is efficient and the outbreak can be contained.",

            "text": "Besides the introduction of the critical parameter \u03c0, we also investigate the optimal period of quarantine, taking into account of the social cost involved. In principle, an outbreak can always be controlled with a sufficiently long quarantine period. However, the social cost involved in a long quarantine period can be too high to be practical [14, 2, 12, 7, 8] . In order to balance the cost issue with an effective containment of the outbreak, we illustrate the procedure to calculate the optimal quarantine period that achieves the minimum social cost for a given T I through a simple example. When deciding on the proper measure for the control of the out-break at its early stage, a policy maker must make a compromise between two competing factors: the cost of taking risk on public health and the social cost incurred by quarantine on the economy. Since the quarantine time is a critical factor in containing the outbreak at the initial stage, we here provides a practical procedure for its estimation.",

One important variation is to consider isolation measure that takes into account of hubs or community structures in social network that may be the centers of outbreak. In this connection, the actual location where isolation and quarantine measures are applied is important, as recently discussed in [15] . The details of the dynamics process of virus spreading can also be further investigated in networks of various topologies using techniques in non-equilibrium statistical physics [9, 10, 11] .",
