Treatment was discontinued because of upper respiratory symptoms as often in each of the interferon groups as in the placebo group. However, it was possible to distinguish clinically between \"colds\" on placebo and low-dose interferon and \"reactions to treatment\" on high-dose interferon. The features of the reactions to treatment were a protracted build-up of local symptoms and minor epistaxis. None of the volunteers on the high-dose interferon were thought to have a definite cold, but viruses were isolated from four out of six volunteers on low-dose interferon who had definite colds.

However, in controlled trials at the MRC Common Cold Unit (Salisbury, UK), volunteers treated with various interferon preparations and challenged with saline instead of virus had more local upper respiratory symptoms than those treated with placebo, suggesting that interferons themselves may cause local reactions [Scott, 19821 .

At each visit, volunteers were assessed clinically according to the schedule used at the MRC Common Cold Unit [Beare and Reed, 19771 . Because it was suspected that the interferon itself might cause reactions and because it was not known in advance whether it would be possible to distinguish between colds and reactions, treatment was discontinued when symptoms had been present for 48 hours. At this time two clinical assessors (G.M.S. and J.K.O.) judged whether the syndrome was like or unlike a classical cold on the basis of clinical experience. Such an assessment, independent of the clinical score, is standard practice at the MRC Common Cold Unit [Beare and Reed, 19771 . Nasal washings and throat swabs were cultured in HeLa, primary baboon kidney, MRCS, and MRC C16 cells in the presence of 2 X lo3 neutralising units of calf antilymphoblastoid interferon. Negative specimens were passaged once. Throat swabs were cultured for streptococci. Pre-and post-trial sera from all volunteers were examined for interferon neutralising activity.

Table I shows some characteristics of the four groups of volunteers. Random allocation produced some imbalance in characteristics that might have influenced outcome (sex, age, history of hay fever, smoking, previous exposure to intranasal interferon). However, the numbers are small and there was no obvious influence of these factors on outcome in terms of the number of volunteers who subsequently discontinued treatment. In the case of two volunteers in group C, inadvertent premature ending of therapy was followed shortly by upper respiratory symptoms. One completed 22 days of treatment and developed symptoms one day afterwards: the other had a break of six days after ten days of treatment and developed upper respiratory symptoms on the day that the new bottle was dispensed. The other volunteers completed 28 days of treatment unless they had significant symptoms. Definite reactions thought to be unlike a cold were diagnosed in 5 out of 16 given the highest dose of interferon, but in none of 17 given placebo (P = 0.02, Fisher's exact test, two-tailed). However, the differences between the groups in the proportion of volunteers who stopped treatment because of possible or definite colds as opposed to reactions do not achieve statistical significance. The times at which volunteers discontinued treatment in each group are presented using life tables in Figure 1 . Although each interferon group appeared to do worse than the placebo group, log rank analysis revealed no significant differences between the groups (P = 0.49), nor a significant trend with increasing dose (P = 0.22). Nine volunteers had mild symptoms but did not discontinue treatment, either because they were thought by the volunteers too trivial to merit a special visit or because they did not fulfill the criteria for withdrawing treatment.

Six volunteers had apparent reactions to treatment that manifested as protracted symptoms with nasal discomfort and nose bleeding but without much rhinorrhoea. It had been suggested that low doses of interferon might protect volunteers against wild as opposed to experimental virus exposure, but treatment with the lowest dose of interferon clearly failed to protect against clinical colds, as rhinoviruses or coronaviruses were isolated from four of these volunteers. The small numbers in this trial do not allow us to evaluate whether a small dose of interferon might ameliorate a cold rather than prevent it totally. However, the highest dose caused unwanted upper respiratory symptoms, particularly a dry uncomfortable nose with nose bleeding.
