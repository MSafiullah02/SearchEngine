Without virus infection, ATA did not cause apparent cell lysis at concentrations up to 1000 \u00b5M (row 1, Figure 1a). When EV71-infected cells were treated with ATA at various concentrations, ATA showed effects on the protection of lysis of Vero cells in a dose-dependent manner (rows 2\u20134, Figure 1a, experiments in triplicate). Subsequently, the effect of ATA was further confirmed using the plaque reduction and viral yield reduction assays. In the plaque reduction assay, Vero cells were infected with EV71 (TW/2231/98) at a titre of \u223c50\u2013100 pfu per well of cells in 6-well plates. After virus adsorption for 1 h, ATA was added to Vero cells at various concentrations. ATA dose-dependently reduced the number of pfu (Figure 1b).

The CC50 (cytotoxic concentration at which 50% of cell viability was inhibited) of ATA in Vero cells was 211 \u00b5M as determined by MTS assay (data not shown).27 Therefore, the selective index (SI = CC50/EC50) of ATA ranged from >3 to >75 based on different assays.28",

As shown in Figure 1(c), ATA treatment substantially reduced the titres of EV71 viral progeny produced in infected cells. When cells were treated with ATA at 16 \u00b5M, a decrease in viral yield of >60% was evident. The declines in viral yields were 97% and 99% when ATA was applied to treat the virus-infected cells at 64 and 250 \u00b5M, respectively. These results showed that ATA could effectively reduce the production of viral progeny in EV71-infected cells.

Then, culture supernatants were removed for determination of the virus yields after approximately one viral replication cycle.16 The yields of viral progeny were normalized based on the vehicle control (same volume of DMSO added at T0). In Figure 2, at T\u22121 and T1, upon ATA treatment, the viral yields in the EV71-infected cells were reduced by 60%. The antiviral effects of ATA started to decrease when ATA was added after the T3 timepoint. When the EV71-infected cells were treated with 120 \u00b5M ATA, a similar phenomenon was observed. Therefore, ATA's anti-EV71 activity was most prominent when it was applied during the early stage of the EV71 replication cycle. Overall, the time of addition experiment indicated that ATA exerts its antiviral effects during the earlier events in the virus replication cycle but not at the viral absorption stage. However, the exact underlying mechanism of inhibition of EV71 by ATA needs further clarification. In this study, we experimentally examined the effects of ATA on the following key steps involved in virus replication: (i) translation of the IRES-mediated viral polyprotein; (ii) the proteolytic activity of viral proteases 2A and/or 3C; and (iii) the viral 3D RdRp elongation activity.",

The level of SEAP activity in the culture supernatant of cells co-expressing GAL4-SEAP and M3-3C-VP16 was significantly enhanced with the treatment with a known 3C protease inhibitor, AG7088, showing that the assay can be used to monitor the activity of 3C protease inhibitors.

In the presence of ATA, UMP incorporation into the RdRp reaction products was clearly inhibited (Figure 4b). When ATA was added to the RdRp reaction at concentrations <0.2 \u00b5M, no inhibition was observed. However, ATA began to inhibit RdRp activity at 0.8 \u00b5M. At 12.0 \u00b5M, ATA reduced the RdRp elongation activity by almost 90% of the control and the IC50 was estimated to be 6.3 \u00b5M. Thus, the results suggested that ATA inhibits the 3D RdRp encoded by EV71.",

Recently, Chen et al.14 also reported that ATA was an NS5B replicase inhibitor of HCV. Results in this study demonstrated that ATA is able to effectively inhibit EV71 replication through the inhibition of the elongation activity of the virus-encoded 3D polymerase (RdRp). It is noteworthy that the inhibition of EV71 by ATA may not be due solely to RdRp inhibition, and further investigations are needed to explore if ATA also affects other viral or cellular functions that are important for EV71 replication. Overall, results from this study will prove to be important for the development of more potent agents against EV71.",
