In other words, \"if air transport were a country, its GDP would rank as 21st in the world, roughly equal to that of Switzerland and more than twice as large as that of Chile or Singapore\" (IATA 2014b).

Airline passenger, goods, and postal services have become an intrinsic part of the modern and globalized economy. Statistics show that there is a strong interdependence between the airline industry and the world economy; for instance, the movement of cargo volume is consistent with the fluctuations in international trade. 4 The economy provides resources such as labor, education and skill, capital and energy to airlines, while airlines in turn provide services and generate jobs 5 and revenues by deploying these productive resources. More fundamentally, by transporting people and goods to locations where they are needed the most, air transportation lubricates the wheels of the world economy. As part of the two-way causal relationship, economic growth fuels the demand for airline travel, as is evident in the People's Republic of China (PRC), India, and several other emerging economies.",

These choices of strategy make firms profitable and sustainable in the competition within the industry (Porter 1986 ). Porter argued that, \"to achieve competitive success, firms must process a competitive advantage in the form of either lower costs or differentiated products that command premium prices.\" \"To sustain advantage, firms must achieve a competitive advantage over time, through providing higher quality products and services or producing more efficiently\" (Porter 1990, pp. 10) . \"Competitive advantages statements help distinguish companies by highlighting what they offer to the customer using tangible terms and concepts\" (Porter 1990) .",

Airlines' sustainable competitiveness in the global market is in fact the result of successful coordination between an overall business strategy and a well-designed marketspecific strategy, which is chosen on a case-by-case basis depending on the market dynamics of each destination. Success in one particular route or city therefore does not guarantee similar results in the global market competition. Thus, instead of looking at specific routes or particular country pair comparisons, our analysis will include various strategies of main airlines such as alliances, pricing, aggregate flying frequency, and flying hours to reflect the airlines' overall strategies of their operation and sales in the global market for a period of 15 years.",

The second objective is to estimate the level of efficiency for individual airlines and changes in the efficiency of international airlines, and how this is related to their allocation factors both from production and cost function perspectives, namely, output maximization and cost minimization objectives, both of which are aimed at maximization of profits. The third objective is to investigate the components that affect the airlines' efficiency and temporal changes in relation to several characteristics such as firm's size, geographical location, specializations, and alliance memberships.

First, while there are many studies that analyze airline efficiency or productivity for specific routes, destinations or countries, there are only few studies which look at the overall population of major airlines from countries around the world. Second, there are few studies that link competitiveness in both production and cost, and jointly investigate the two as complementary. Looking at both sides of efficiency will improve the scope of interpretation by appropriately addressing the issue of the efficiency in airlines, while simultaneously reflecting on the ongoing process of airlines' entry and exit from the highly evolving and competitive market. Such an approach is less likely to make a biased estimation on the global competitiveness of airlines. Third, this study uses up-to-date estimation methods and long time series of individual airlines covering substantial numbers of airlines from each region of the world including the Asian region, where there have been relatively fewer studies. Each of these three contributions is valuable in its own right, and we hope collectively they will make a valuable contribution to the literature by providing a clear picture of the performance and strategic decision-making of the industry.",

In principle, we selected one carrier per country, but taking into consideration demand and market size, we included 4 carriers from the United States, 3 from China, and 2 from Japan. Some airlines were excluded from the data analysis and estimation procedure due to limitations in the data availability. The airlines' performance-related data was primarily collected from the Korean Government Official Statistics site (www.airportal.go.kr) as well as each airline's homepage.
