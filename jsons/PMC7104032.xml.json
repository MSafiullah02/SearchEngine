Nebulizers (for medications in solution) and spacers (for metered-dose inhalers, MDIs) are among the most widely used modalities. Several studies have shown that MDI-spacers are as effective as, or better than, nebulizers in aerosol delivery in children [1], [2], [3], [4], [5]. Nebulizers use require a power supply, take more time, are not conveniently portable, are generally more expensive, require maintenance, and need more supervision [6]. In contrast, spacers are easier to use, require less effort and time, do not require dose preparation or electricity for delivery, are portable, and require lower medication doses compared to nebulizers [7].",

The study results indicate the need for hospital policy modification to enhance conversion to MDI-spacer as the delivery method of choice for BDs and ICSs whenever applicable for hospitalized children. We believe that this will lead to better utilization of hospital resources without negatively affecting the pharmacological effect of medications. In fact, this simple practice change will lead to wiser utilization of respiratory therapists' time and efforts, which can be utilized for other important aspects of patient care. This is of extreme importance, especially with the significant shortage in respiratory therapists across hospitals globally. Cost savings is also expected as a result of the lower cost of medications, elimination of the need for nebulizer machines and disposable nebulizer kits, prevention of unnecessary use of oxygen treatment, and, more importantly, reducing the need for the cost of respiratory therapist overtime shifts. Although these savings are theoretically plausible, there is a lack of solid evidence to confirm those assumptions. We note that conversion to MDI-spacer might raise the concern of increasing costs due to spacer expenses, but this might not be a valid concern because these devices can be provided for patients for long-term use.",

In one study, 168 infants (aged 2\u201324 months) were randomized in a double blind trial comparing MDI-spacer- to nebulizer-administered albuterol for wheezing episodes in the emergency department [11]. Patients in the spacer group had a significantly lower admission rate (5% versus 20% in the nebulizer group), received fewer treatments, had a lower mean increase in heart rate and were less likely to receive steroids. Lower admission rates in the spacer group were found primarily in children with more severe asthma exacerbation [11]. Another randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in an emergency department at a children's hospital included children 1\u20134 years of age with moderate to severe acute asthma. The spacer was as effective as the nebulizer in terms of clinical score, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation but produced a greater reduction in wheezing (P = 0.03). Heart rate increased to a greater degree in the nebulizer group (11.0/min vs. 0.17/min for spacer, p < 0.01). Fewer children in the spacer group required admission (33% vs. 60% in the nebulizer group, P = 0.04, adjusted for sex). No differences were observed in rates of tremor or hyperactivity [12]. Interestingly, this study showed cost savings in spacer group. Such cost benefits have been reported in studies of American adults, documenting a 30%\u201350% annual cost savings for asthma therapy with substitution of spacers for nebulizers [13], [14], [15], [16]. A meta-analysis and systematic review showed that patients who received beta-agonists by MDI-spacer showed a significant decrease in admission rate compared with those by nebulizer (OR, 0.42; 95% CI, 0.24\u20130.72; P = 0.002); this decrease was even more significant among children with moderate to severe exacerbations (OR, 0.27; 95% CI, 0.13\u20130.54; P = 0.0003). Additionally, measures of severity (eg, clinical score) significantly improved in the group that received beta-agonists by MDI-spacer in comparison to those who received nebulizer treatment (standardized mean difference, \u22120.44; 95% CI, \u22120.68 to \u22120.20; P = 0.0003) [17].",

            "text": "Conversion to MDI-spacer might encounter difficulties such as lack of awareness of healthcare practitioners, patient and/or caregiver disbelief that nebulizers are more effective, shortage of the proper size and type of spacers, and need for effective patient education to ensure proper device use. In a Canadian study, a national survey on barriers to MDI-spacer use in pediatric emergency departments revealed that MDI-spacer are infrequently used to treat patients with acute asthma in Canadian pediatric emergency departments despite the fact that most emergency staff believe that they are effective. The largest perceived barriers to MDI-spacer implementation include concerns regarding safety and costs, feasibility of providing and sterilizing spacers, and parental expectations for use of nebulizers. Other barriers included staff beliefs regarding the effectiveness of MDI-spacer, changes in nursing workload, and lack of a physician champion for change [18]. A report on US children's hospital's strategy to implement conversion to MDI-spacer showed increase spacer use from 25% to 77% among all non-intensive-care patients receiving albuterol and from 10% to 79% among patients with asthma (p < 0.001) [19]. The strategy includes the following 4 distinct interventions to plan and implement this conversion program: literature review, product selection, policy and operational changes, and staff training.",

The majority of children (82%) said that they preferred using spacers because it was quicker (29%) or easier to use (53%) [20]. In another study of young patients, 86% of children and 85% of parents preferred the spacer [12].",
