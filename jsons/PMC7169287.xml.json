In both of these cases spontaneous eye disease can complicate experimental or toxicologic work. In addition, ocular lesions in rodents and specifically the rat may often be associated with systemic diseases of importance, both for the individual animal and for the experimental colony. Thus, ocular disease in this species has importance both from a scientific, a laboratory management and an animal welfare perspective. In addition, the rat can make a friendly and intelligent pet, and as such more and more people are keeping rats as pets. They may, in this context, be presented to the veterinarian and, of course, to the veterinary ophthalmologist, should an ocular condition be diagnosed. It is thus important that veterinary ophthalmologists are aware of the range of ocular lesions seen in this species and of possible therapeutic options in such cases.",

Understanding the unusual phenomenon of red tear production in this less familiar species demands comprehension of basic anatomy and physiology of tear production in the rat, as well as pathologic changes in disease. Seeing disease in the context of normal physiologic processes is a key point in the investigation of any ocular disease in any species, but perhaps this is particularly so regarding disease involving an unusual process in a less familiar species. For chromodacryorrhoea, investigation requires the consideration of a number of factors, both infectious and noninfectious, which contribute to excess porphyrin production in the rat Harderian gland, the underlying problem in chromodacryorhoea.",

            "text": "The rat eye has three tear\u2010producing glands: the intraorbital, the extraorbital and the Harderian, the latter associated with the third eyelid. Studies in basic biology show that the rat, in common with a number of rodent species, normally produces porphyrin\u2010pigmented and lipid\u2010laden tears predominantly from the Harderian gland.\n1\n, \n2\n This production is controlled by parasympathetic innervation and can be prevented by the parasympatholytic action of atropine.\n3\n Thus, factors which increase parasympathetic drive increase the level of Harderian porphyrin production and can cause chromodacryorrhoea, the overflow of red tears. These stain both the periorbital fur and the fur of the front paws, since rats regularly wipe their eyes with their front paws. Diseases such as mycoplasmosis and silalodacryoadenitis, considered further below, are important causes of chromodacryorrhoea. Thus, red periocular staining in a group of laboratory animals, or less commonly in pet rats, should be a warning sign of potentially severe systemic disease. Other predisposing factors include nutritional deficiencies or other physiologic stresses. It might appear somewhat anomalous that stressors, which must surely increase sympathetic innervation, aggravate a parasympathetically mediated condition. A further influencing factor is prolonged light exposure. As will be discussed further below, prolonged exposure to artificial light has several deleterious effects on the rat eye. One of these is Harderian gland pathology with swelling and necrosis.\n4\n, \n5\n Porphyrin content is reported to be decreased in these circumstances, but photodynamic effects of Harderian gland porphyrins have damaging effects and photic injury is considered to be a key pathogenic route in ocular surface damage in prolonged light exposure.\n6\n\n",

A 23\u2010g hypodermic needle or capillary tube can be inserted under the upper eyelid at the lateral canthus and directed medially while compressing the jugular vein (Fig. 2). This procedure can be performed many times in experienced hands without apparent detriment.\n7\n Other reports, however, have suggested that postbleeding exophthalmos is seen,\n8\n that hemorrhages and subsequent inflammatory foci are found in the puncture track\n9\n and that dark focal areas in the nasal fundus subsequent to orbital bleeding may be sequelae of orbital hemorrhage.\n6\n This may be related to intraspecies differences: the anatomy of the orbital venous drainage is different in the rat from several other rodents.\n9\n While the large sinus in the hamster, gerbil and mouse is easily sampled, the smaller plexus of the rat renders sampling less satisfactory and many consider that the lateral tail vein should be used in preference. In addition to the relatively minor clinical signs after bleeding noted above, more substantial inflammatory disease with subsequent necrosis of the Harderian gland has been reported as associated with orbital bleeding in rats.\n10\n This inflammatory disease can be distinguished from that associated with the sialodacryoadenitis (SDA) virus by its localization: foci of inflammation are seen in acini adjacent to the extraocular muscles rather than the generalized nature of inflammation in SDA as discussed further below.",

Here conjunctivitis and periorbital swelling are the first signs, followed by sneezing and cervical swelling, this last sign associated with both lymphoadenopathy and salivary gland swelling. This condition is highly contagious and yet is generally self\u2010limiting. These two characteristics mean that the subacute or chronic form is commonly seen throughout colonies rather than an acute form of the disease. The classic epizootic disease, first described in 1961,\n15\n has high morbidity and low or absent mortality. Nevertheless, it is clearly a major problem in an otherwise pathogen\u2010free colony. Ocular signs may be primary but are often secondary to reduced tear production associated with reactive lacrimal gland hyperplasia. Considerable ductal squamous metaplasia together with periacinar fibrosis occurs during gland repair after inflammation. It is these changes which result in subsequent lacrimal inadequacy.\n16\n Resulting keratitis and conjunctivitis lead to chromodacryorrhoea and self\u2010mutilation with attendant further periorbital swelling. The lesions seen in this disease are a manifestation of the reaction between host and infectious agent in the context of the conditions in which the animal is housed. Thus, the disease varies between different strains\n17\n and in different environments.\n18\n Experimentally immuno\u2010suppressed animals had delayed onset of signs with less glandular damage, but also a longer time to resolution of lesions.\n19\n While this may seem of purely academic interest, these findings have important clinical implications. The introduction of a naive group of rats to a subclinically affected animal house, with the attendant mild immuno\u2010suppression linked with moving and rehousing, may provoke a clinical onset of acute disease in these animals. This can result in prolonged shedding of virus, further compromising the situation in an infected colony. Diagnosis of the disease is normally readily achieved through observation of classic pathognomonic signs, but detection of coronavirus antigen or serologic testing of animals are also possible if confirmation is required.\n20\n Widespread serologic testing has shown the agent to be present in 45% of colonies within the UK, although incidence of overt disease is lower, as might be expected of a chronic subclinical infection.\n21\n\n",

Clinical features of mild microphthalmos in these rats include microcornea, engorged episcleral vessels and abnormal vasculature in the iris and posterior segment, as well as reduced globe size (Fig. 3). Spontaneous inherited microphthalmos may thus complicate research programs into other ocular abnormalities or in toxicology studies.

One such lesion is a sharply demarcated pale linear retinal defect seen in young rat pups. Incidence increases from 0.3% in weanling rats to 3% at 14 weeks of age. Thus, these should probably be considered as early acquired lesions. Hubert and colleagues describe them histopathologically as focal outer retinal thinning rather than the generalized photoreceptor loss found in the dystrophic animals noted below.\n59\n Other workers have, however, described these lesions as retinal dystrophy\n60\n or degeneration.\n61\n One study has suggested that the focal atrophy represents retinal detachment and reattachment.\n62\n\n",

Environmental and body temperature is important in defining the rate of degeneration, as is age at onset of photic damage. Even in standard lighting, over one tenth of 2\u2010year\u2010old rats were found to have lesions, although the relationship between light\u2010induced and age\u2010related retinal degeneration is not particularly well substantiated. Retinal changes such as alterations in vessel caliber, fundic reflectivity and optic disc pallor can be observed ophthalmoscopically after 7 days of continuous light but electroretinography demonstrates changes after only 1 day of this light regime.\n65\n Measurement of pupil diameter also shows alterations at an earlier stage than does fundoscopy and is useful, given that it is more readily achieved than electroretinography. The diagnosis of this phototoxic change can be substantiated by noting simple correlates of the disease such as increased degeneration in animals in top cages in a stack, or in clear plastic\u2010roofed as opposed to metal\u2010topped cages. Now that the problem is well understood and widely known, the most common cause of photic retinal damage is a malfunction in light timing switches caused by mechanical faults or simply through human error. Even given the understanding of the etiolopathogenesis of this condition it can all too easily complicate and confuse retinal research: the changes seen in the WAG/Rij rat were first thought to be an inherited degeneration\n66\n but later discounted as a light\u2010induced retinal change.\n67\n Interestingly, even in strains with a defined inherited trait, light has a significant effect. In the RCS rat, discussed further below, environmental light levels have a profound effect on the rate of degenerative change, dark\u2010reared animals having significantly less severe and more protracted degenerative processes than those kept in the light.\n68\n\n",

While the rd and rds mice have perhaps led the field, the rat has had an important part to play also. One of the first conditions fully investigated was retinal degeneration in the Royal College of Surgeons (RCS) rat.\n69\n This model is characterized by degeneration of rod outer segments from around 2 weeks postnatally when outer segment debris accumulates between photoreceptors and the RPE. Chimeric RCS/wild type rats showed that the cause of retinal disease lies in the pigment epithelium and not the neurosensory retina: photoreceptors adjacent to normal RPE developed normally while those for which mutant RCS RPE provided phagocytotyic function were seen to degenerate.\n70\n Subsequent in vitro studies have confirmed this finding.\n71\n Other neuroretinal degenerations in the rat include the photoreceptor degeneration in the Osbourne\u2010Mendel rat,\n72\n but these have not been investigated to the same extent as analogous conditions in the rd and rds mouse.
