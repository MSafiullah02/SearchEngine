Sanarelli (1898) named the disease \u201cinfectious myxomatosis of rabbits\u201d and, since no microbial agents were detected, proposed that the disease was caused by a newly recognized group of infectious agents known as \u201cfilterable viruses.\u201d The virus which caused the first known outbreak of myxomatosis is believed to have originated from the Forest rabbit (Sylvilagus brasiliensis) in which the virus causes relatively mild disease. Transmission from wild to domestic rabbits probably occurred by mosquitoes of the genus Aedes (Aragao, 1943; Fenner and Ratcliffe, 1965).",

The disease was first recognized in North America in 1928 when natural outbreaks of a fatal disease of rabbits occurred in several rabbit colonies near San Diego, California (Kessel et al., 1931). The virus which caused the first outbreaks in southern California may have been introduced into the United States from Mexico by importation of infected domestic rabbits (Vail and McKenney, 1943).

The virus was first introduced into Australia in 1926 and used only in experimental studies aimed at determining its feasibility as a control measure for rabbits. In 1950, the virus was released into the wild rabbit population where it decimated the rabbit population of the continent by 1953. The disease is now endemic in the wild rabbit population of Australia, where it occasionally assumes epidemic proportions when climatic conditions favor vector activity. Within a decade following release of Myxoma virus into the rabbit population, it became evident that through natural selection genetically resistant strains of rabbits had emerged. In these rabbits, a virulent strain of Myxoma virus caused only 25% mortality compared to 90% mortality in non-resistant strains of rabbits (Fenner and Ratcliffe, 1965). This selective pressure continues with regional increases in resistance of Australian rabbits (Williams et al., 1990).",

Heat-inactivated Myxoma virus has been reactivated by fibroma virus (Berry and Dedrick, 1936, Fenner, 1962), further demonstrating the close relationship between these two viruses. The Berry-Dedrick phenomenon of poxvirus reactivation was confirmed by Smith (1952), who demonstrated a spectrum of virulence for strains of myxoma and fibroma viruses. Fenner and Marshall (1957), in a study involving 92 strains of virus, established a virulence spectrum ranging from strains causing over 99% mortality in European rabbits to others causing less than 30% mortality. The most virulent strains were the Standard Laboratory, Lausanne, and California strains, whereas the least virulent were the neuromyxoma and Nottingham strains. Ecological pressures such as those previously described in Australia could have been responsible for the emergence of many of these strains of viruses. In many instances, however, viruses have been manipulated in the laboratory to the point of permanent modification (Kilham, 1957, Kilham, 1958). The entire genome of the Lausanne strain has been sequenced (Cameron et al., 1999). Infection of Oryctolagus cuniculus with Myxoma virus has provided a model system for elucidating the immunopathogenesis of poxvirus in the host (Stanford et al., 2007).",

Myxoma virus is readily propagated at 35\u00b0C on the chorioallantoic membrane of embryonated hens\u2019 eggs, forming distinct pocks (Fenner and McIntyre, 1956). Different strains of virus cause pocks of various sizes, the variation being sufficiently distinct to allow tentative strain identification. The South American strains cause large pocks, whereas the California strains produce small focal lesions on the membrane (Fenner and Marshall, 1957). The virus can also be propagated in cell cultures derived from rabbits and other species, including chicken, squirrel, rat, hamster, guinea pig, and human (Andrewes and Porterfield, 1989; Woodroofe and Fenner, 1965). Distinct differences in plaque size on rabbit kidney cell cultures can be demonstrated between the South American and California strains, the former causing much larger plaques (Woodroofe and Fenner, 1965). The most sensitive method for isolation of Myxoma virus under laboratory conditions is inoculation of the skin of European rabbits (Fenner and McIntyre, 1956).",

            "text": "Myxomatosis is endemic on four continents: Australia, Europe, North America, and South America. In Brazil and Uruguay, the virus is endemic in wild rabbits (Sylvilagus), particularly Sylvilagus brasiliensis (Aragao, 1943). A similar situation may exist in Panama and Colombia, where the strains of virus are similar in virulence to South American strains, but antigenically more closely related to the California strains (Fenner, 1965). In the forested area of Argentina, the virus is also endemic in Sylvilagus rabbits, but in the southern part of the country and in Chile the principal reservoir is the wild European rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus) (Fenner and Ratcliffe, 1965). The California strains of Myxoma virus, also known as the California rabbit fibroma virus (Andrewes and Porterfield, 1989), are endemic in wild rabbits (Sylvilagus), especially Sylvilagus bachmani, which serves as the principal source of infection for domestic rabbits (Marshall et al., 1963). A similar situation exists in Mexico, where Sylvilagus bachmani has been shown to be the reservoir in Baja California (Lic\u00f3n Luna, 2000). In Australia, the Myxoma virus has been endemic in wild European rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus) since its introduction into the rabbit population in 1950. Following the introduction of the virus into France in 1952, myxomatosis has become established in most countries of Europe, the wild European rabbit serving as the predominant host species. In Europe, Myxoma virus and Rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus occur endemically in the same free-living populations of Oryctolagus cuniculus (Calvete et al., 2002) and seropositivity to both viruses occurs significantly suggesting the possibility of predisposition (Marchandeau et al., 2004). In rabbit farms in Belgium, the Netherlands, and Germany, the seroprevalence of Myxoma virus was higher in herds with recurrent respiratory or digestive diseases (Marlier et al., 2001).",

The source of virus is usually the superficial layers of the skin, especially of the eyelids and at the base of the ears (Fenner and Woodroofe, 1953), where surface-feeding arthropods obtain the virus and serve as mechanical vectors. Experimentally, virus can spread by contact in the absence of arthropod vectors, and such transmission may occur under natural conditions in rabbit warrens (Mykytowycz, 1958, Mykytowycz, 1961). An outbreak in Hungary at a rabbit farm was attributed to airborne transmission as the disease occurred in winter when mosquitoes and fleas were uncommon (Farsang et al., 2003). Windborne spread was suspected in France (Arthur and Louzis, 1988). Transmission of Myxoma virus by contaminated spines of thistles (Circium vulgare) has been described (Dyce, 1961, Mykytowycz, 1961). The claws of predatory birds and carrion feeders, such as buzzards and crows, may be contaminated with virus, and such birds may play a role in dissemination of the virus (Borg and Bakos, 1963).",

The flea reproduced in wild rabbit populations and transmitted both introduced and field strains of Myxoma virus (Shepherd and Edmonds, 1977, Sobey and Conolly, 1971). As a result of flea introduction, myxomatosis has become more prevalent in drier tableland areas (Parer and Korn, 1989), and outbreaks of myxomatosis have shifted from summer to spring (Shepherd and Edmonds, 1978, Shepherd et al., 1978). In France, there is evidence that mosquitoes of the genus Anopheles are the principal vectors of summer epidemics. The rabbit flea, Spilopsyllus cuniculi, is probably a major vector, especially during winter months when mosquito activity is low (Fenner and Ratcliffe, 1965).",

            "text": "Myxomatosis in Britain is characterized by milder seasonal fluctuations in disease incidence than in Australia, California, and France (Ross and Tittensor, 1986). Mosquitoes play a minor role as vectors, whereas the rabbit flea, Spilopsyllus cuniculi, which is less influenced by seasonal changes, is the major vector (Andrewes et al., 1959, Armour and Thompson, 1955, Lockley, 1954, Mead-Briggs, 1964). The Myxoma virus in Britain has not undergone the rapid loss of virulence observed with the Australian and French viruses. The increase in resistance to myxomatosis in wild rabbit populations has resulted in the appearance of more virulent strains of Myxoma virus (Ross and Sanders, 1987). While mildly virulent strains have emerged in Britain, the predominant strains are moderately virulent (Chapple and Bowen, 1963, Chapple and Lewis, 1964, Fenner and Chapple, 1965), with recent estimates of between 47% and 69% mortality in infected rabbits (Ross et al., 1989). The different evolution of Myxoma virus in Britain has been attributed to the fact that the virus is predominantly flea-transmitted. The flea is less seasonal and less mobile than the mosquito. That fleas move in large numbers from dead animals while moving only occasionally from live ones would seem to favor transmission of virulent virus strains (Fenner and Marshall, 1957). The proportion of infective fleas produced is inversely related to the survival time of rabbits following infection (Mead-Briggs and Vaughan, 1975). The flea is also an effective reservoir of virus, possessing a longer life span than mosquitoes. The life span of active female mosquitoes is usually 2\u20133 weeks, whereas fleas have been known to feed actively for over 1 year. The Myxoma virus can persist for 105 days in rabbit fleas with no rabbit contact in artificial burrows (Chapple and Lewis, 1965).",

A similar study examined the pathogenesis of two Californian strains of Myxoma viruses (MSW and MSD) in European rabbits and found that both susceptible rabbits and rabbits that had naturally acquired innate resistance, experienced acute fatal infections with the MSW strain, whereas, the MSD strain caused classical signs of myxomatosis in both strains of rabbits (Silvers et al., 2006).",

Although nodules on the ears, head, and legs have been reported (Kessel et al., 1934), other workers have been unable to induce nodule development (Fenner and Marshall, 1957).",

From 3\u20134 days following inoculation or natural infection with virus, a primary tumor may become evident, and generalized tumors usually appear by the sixth or seventh day. Edema of the eyelids occurs followed by mucopurulent blepharoconjunctivitis, often resulting in complete closure of the eyes. Mucopurulent nasal discharge and pronounced edema of the base of the ears, the perineal region, the external genitalia, and lips are frequently seen. By the tenth day, hard convex lumps may cover the body, head, and ears and occasionally the legs. The lumps are not sharply demarcated but may become markedly congested and ultimately necrotic in rabbits surviving for 2 weeks. Dyspnea is often seen in protracted cases, but appetite may be maintained until shortly before death. Terminal convulsions frequently precede death, which usually occurs 8\u201315 days after infection. Infection with less virulent South American and Australian strains results in milder disease with less edema and nasal and ocular discharge, more clearly demarcated nodules, and lower mortality. The laboratory-attenuated neuromyxoma virus induces a mild disease with little or no mortality (Hurst, 1937b).",

In France and Belgium, two forms of the disease are recognized, nodular and amyxomatous forms (Marlier et al., 1999).

Infection with the California viruses may be harder to diagnose, however, owing to the frequent absence of skin nodules and other signs of disease. Diagnosis should be confirmed by virus isolation. Intracutaneous inoculation of young susceptible rabbits with fresh tissue collected from lesions free of bacterial contamination results in lesions at the site of inoculation within 1 week. The virus can be isolated by chorioallantoic membrane inoculation of 11\u201313-day-old embryonated chicken eggs followed by incubation at 35\u00b0C for 4\u20136 days. Distinct focal pocks develop if the virus is present. The South American viruses cause large pocks, the California virus intermediate-sized pocks, and the fibroma virus minute pocks. Virus isolation on chicken embryo fibroblast, Vero or RK13 cells can also be accomplished. A cytopathic effect typical of poxviruses usually develops in 1\u20132 days but may take up to 7 days with some strains. The virus isolated can be identified as Myxoma virus by direct fluorescent antibody test (Takahashi et al., 1958, Takahashi et al., 1959), the plaque-neutralization test (Woodroofe and Fenner, 1965), the agar-gel diffusion microprecipitation test (Fenner, 1965), or the indirect immunoperoxidase test (Marlier et al., 1999).

An assessment of the Borgi strain vaccine of Myxoma virus was reported during an outbreak of myxomatosis in Greece (Kritas et al., 2008). Two-month-old vaccinated pregnant does were obtained by two commercial rabbitries, only one of which had vaccinated resident does. Within several weeks of their arrival, an explosive outbreak of myxomatosis with high morbidity and mortality occurred on both farms in both unvaccinated and vaccinated rabbits, both imported and resident, with the Lausanne strain of Myxoma virus. Since vaccinated rabbits were affected within 6 months of vaccination, the efficacy of the vaccine was questionable.",

Furthermore, the vaccine exhibited limited horizontal transmission, either by direct contact or fleas, as uninoculated rabbits also exhibited seroconversion. Although the observation period was brief (32 days), the vaccine appeared to be both safe and efficacious. An attenuated strain (SG33) was used in a field trail in juvenile rabbits in France and vaccinated rabbits had a 1.8-fold greater odds of surviving than unvaccinated rabbits over 4 years of surveillance (Guitton et al., 2008). In a field trial in Zaragoza province in northeast Spain, young European rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus) born in the current year and unvaccinated, were 13.6 times more likely to die than rabbits vaccinated against both myxomatosis (POX-LAP) and Rabbit hemorrhagic disease (CYLAP-VHD), over a 90-day observation period after vaccination (Calvete et al., 2004).",

            "text": "The transmissible tumor-inducing agent now known as rabbit or Shope fibroma virus was isolated from an Eastern Cottontail rabbit (Sylvilagus floridanus) in 1932 (Shope, 1932a). The virus was transmissible to Eastern Cottontail and European rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus), producing localized fibromas in both species. Shope (1932a) described the gross and microscopic lesions of both the natural and experimental disease and identified the causative agent as a virus antigenically related to Myxoma virus (Shope, 1932b). Similarities between Rabbit fibroma and Myxoma viruses have subsequently been confirmed by cross-immunity tests (Shope, 1936), ether sensitivity (Andrewes and Horstmann, 1949, Fenner, 1953), virus-reactivation studies (Berry and Dedrick, 1936), microprecipitation procedures (Fenner, 1965), and sequence comparison (Willer et al., 1999). The Rabbit fibroma virus, initially believed to cause only localized benign fibromas, was later shown to cause severe generalized disease in newborn European (Duran-Reynals, 1940, Joiner et al., 1971) and Eastern Cottontail rabbits (Yuill and Hanson, 1964). The disease is historically considered a benign endemic disease of wild Sylvilagus rabbits, of little economic significance to commercial rabbit producers or laboratory investigators. However, an outbreak of fibromatosis in a commercial rabbitry resulting in high morbidity and mortality in newborn rabbits was reported in 1971 (Joiner et al., 1971). Thus, the disease can be a threat to commercial rabbits in areas where it is endemic in wild rabbit populations and outdoor husbandry practices permit contact with arthropod vectors.\n",

The complete genome of Rabbit fibroma virus has been sequenced (Willer et al., 1999). The chemical and physical characteristics of fibroma virus have been summarized by Gross (1983). The virus can be propagated on the chorioallantoic membrane of chicken embryos, but characteristic lesions as observed with Myxoma virus are not produced (Gross, 1983). The virus has been propagated in cell cultures derived from rats, guinea pigs, and humans (Chaproniere and Andrewes, 1957) and also in rabbit cell cultures derived from Eastern Cottontail and domestic rabbits (Constantin et al., 1956, Hinze and Walker, 1964, Kasza, 1974, Kilham, 1956, Padgett et al., 1962). Fibroma virus in cultured rabbit kidney cells induces pronounced changes in cell growth and morphology, and inoculation of virus-transformed cells into the cheek pouch of hamsters results in tumor formation (Hinze and Walker, 1964).",

Experimentally, several species of mosquitoes as well as triatomes, fleas, and bedbugs can serve as vectors (Dalmat, 1959, Kilham and Dalmat, 1955, Kilham and Woke, 1953). Infected mosquitoes are capable of infecting wild Sylvilagus rabbits (Kilham and Dalmat, 1955). Experimental and circumstantial evidence suggests that the principal mode of transmission for fibroma virus is biting arthropods, a situation similar to that described for myxomatosis. Infection may also occur by direct contact with skin injuries being a predisposing factor (Grilli et al., 2003).",

A closely related virus, isolated from fibromas in Sylvilagus bachmani, failed to induce lesions in other Sylvilagus species (Marshall and Regnery, 1960). This virus, considered a strain of Myxoma virus, is a related virus named California Rabbit fibroma virus (Andrewes and Porterfield, 1989). The European rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus) is susceptible to fibroma virus (Shope, 1932a) as is the Snowshoe hare, Lepus americanus (Yuill, 1981), but the European hare, Lepus europaeus, is refractory to the virus (Fenner and Ratcliffe, 1965). Whereas the European rabbit is readily infected, it does not serve as a good source of infection for mosquitoes because of low virus concentrations in the skin (Fenner and Ratcliffe, 1965).",

The tumors observed in natural fibromatosis of Eastern Cottontail rabbits are almost invariably on the legs or feet, usually one to three tumors occurring on an infected rabbit. Tumors may occur on the muzzle and around the eyes, and measure up to 7 cm in diameter and 1\u20132 cm in thickness. The tumors are subcutaneous, unattached to underlying tissues, and may persist for several months, and in some instances for nearly a year (Kilham and Dalmat, 1955). Other clinical signs are usually absent, the tumor-bearing rabbit remaining apparently normal throughout the disease. Metastases do not occur (Shope, 1932a). The clinical signs in experimentally infected European rabbits resemble those in Sylvilagus rabbits. However, regression of tumors is usually more rapid than in Sylvilagus rabbits. Inoculation of newborn European rabbits frequently results in fatal systemic infections (Duran-Reynals, 1945). Systemic infections of adult European rabbits have also been described (Hurst, 1937c), but the usual result of infection is the development of localized benign tumors. In the only reported natural outbreak of fibromatosis of European rabbits, diffuse subcutaneous induration involving the underlying tissues occurred (Joiner et al., 1971). Subcutaneous tumors were the predominant sign in adult rabbits but suckling rabbits had lethargy and loss of condition, in addition to the skin lesions. Hyperemia and edema of the external genitalia of male and female rabbits were also observed.",

The pathological changes in the only reported natural outbreak of fibromatosis in European rabbits were described by Joiner et al. (1971). The earliest gross lesion in experimentally infected Sylvilagus rabbits is a slight thickening of the subcutaneous tissue, followed by development of clearly demarcated soft swellings usually evident 6 days after inoculation. The tumors enlarge, increase in density, and usually reach maximum size by 12 days. The average size of the tumors is 4\u20136 cm with a thickness of 2 cm. Tumors may persist for months before regressing, leaving the rabbit essentially normal. Experimentally infected newborn Sylvilagus rabbits may die of generalized fibromatosis.

Many tumor cells may have large intracytoplasmic inclusions characteristic of poxvirus infections. Mononuclear leukocyte cuffing of vessels adjacent to the tumor may be observed, and a pronounced accumulation of lymphocytes at the base of the tumor is often seen. Degeneration of the overlying epidermis may result from pressure ischemia, followed by necrosis and sloughing of the epithelium and tumor. In many instances, however, the tumors regress without epithelial sloughing. Regression is usually complete within 2 months after appearance of tumors.

Histopathological differentiation is also easily accomplished, especially when intracytoplasmic inclusion bodies are observed. Historically, subcutaneous inoculation of young European rabbits with a tumor cell suspension was used to differentiate the two viruses. Rabbit fibroma virus induces local fibromas, whereas Myxoma virus causes severe systemic and often fatal disease. Virus isolation in cell cultures or on the chorioallantoic membranes of chicken embryos should be attempted to confirm the diagnosis. The virus can be identified by serum neutralization tests (Yuill, 1981).",

A smaller outbreak had occurred in 1930. Rabbits developed an erythematous rash followed by cutaneous eruptions closely resembling the pocks seen in human infection with variola virus (smallpox). The disease was extremely contagious and caused high mortality, especially in young rabbits and pregnant females. Belgian hares were also susceptible to the disease. The causative agent of the disease was a poxvirus (Pearce et al., 1936, Rosahn et al., 1936a).",

This disease was also caused by a poxvirus closely related to vaccinia virus (Jansen, 1946). A second outbreak of the disease in Holland was reported by Verlinde and Wersinck (1951). The second outbreak of rabbitpox reported in the United States occurred in New York (Christensen et al., 1967) and was also of the pockless type first observed by Jansen (1947) in Holland. Another serious outbreak of the disease, resulting in mortality of 95%, occurred following the introduction of supposedly inactivated rabbitpox virus of the Dutch (Utrecht) strain into the rabbit colony of a medical school (Christensen et al., 1967). Various aspects of the infection have been reviewed by Fenner et al. (1989). Rabbitpox virus infection in rabbits can serve as a model for human smallpox infection as a fatal systemic disease developed with a low inoculum and inoculated rabbits naturally transmitted the virus to susceptible rabbits by aerosol (Adams et al., 2007).",

The biological properties of the Utrecht (Jansen, 1941) and Rockefeller (Greene, 1934a) strains of rabbitpox viruses are indistinguishable from certain neurovaccinia strains (Fenner, 1958, Fenner et al., 1989). The close antigenic relationship between rabbitpox virus and vaccinia virus, taken together with the fact that all reported outbreaks of rabbitpox have occurred in laboratory colonies, suggests that rabbitpox may be a laboratory variant of vaccinia virus (Greene, 1935a, Verlinde and Wersinck, 1951). Wittek et al. (1977) used genome mapping to show that rabbitpox virus (Utrecht strain) was a strain of vaccinia virus.

Within infected colonies, the spread of disease is extremely rapid, and, in the outbreak of 1932, removal and isolation of infected rabbits failed to prevent the disease from spreading throughout the colony (Greene, 1934a). The virus appears to spread by nasal discharges, which usually appear on the third day after infection. Airborne droplets may be inhaled or ingested by susceptible rabbits (Bedson and Duckworth, 1963). Recovery from infection does not appear to result in establishment of a carrier state, as recovered rabbits can be safely mated with susceptible rabbits and clean colonies derived from recovered stock (Greene, 1934a). Arthropods have not been shown to play a role in the epidemiology of rabbitpox infection. In general, the primary sources of infection resulting in outbreaks of disease have not been determined, although the origin may have been rabbits inoculated with vaccinia virus (Greene, 1935a).",

The virus initially infects and multiplies in the nasal mucosa and later in lymph nodes of the respiratory tract and in the lungs and spleen. Fever and a profuse nasal discharge usually occur 2\u20133 days after infection. Another early sign is enlargement and induration of the lymph nodes, especially the popliteal and inguinal nodes, which usually persist throughout the course of disease. Widely distributed skin lesions usually appear about 5 days after infection, initially as an erythematous macular rash which becomes papular and may progress to nodules up to 1 cm in size. These nodules eventually form dry, superficial crusts. Macules and papules may also occur on the mucous membranes of the oral and nasal cavities. Extensive edema of the face and oral cavity is often observed, as is focal necrosis of the hard palate and the gums. Hemorrhages in the skin may occur in severe cases.",

The peracute form is unusual with the Rockefeller strain, but natural outbreaks of rabbitpox of the pockless type (Jansen, 1941, Jansen, 1946, Jansen, 1947, Christensen et al., 1967), without erythema or skin lesions, have occurred. In the first Dutch outbreak, some rabbits died within 1 week after infection, with only anorexia, fever, and lethargy (Jansen, 1941). In the first American outbreak of pockless disease, rabbits developed conjunctivitis and diarrhea and died 7\u20139 days after experimental infection (Christensen et al., 1967).

Although infectious virus could not be demonstrated in lymphocytes from infected Sylvilagus rabbits, it could be detected after in vitro cocultivation with rabbit kidney cells (Hinze and Wegner, 1973, Wegner and Hinze, 1974). The virus is strongly cell-associated (Ley and Burger, 1970), and both B and T lymphocytes are infected (Kramp et al., 1985). The virus can be propagated in cells of both Eastern Cottontail and domestic New Zealand White rabbits but not in cells from humans, monkeys, hamsters, mice, nor in chicken embryos. The highest concentrations of virus are obtained by the use of primary kidney cell lines established from newborn or juvenile Eastern Cottontail rabbits (Cohrs and Rouhandeh, 1982, Medveczky et al., 1984). The virus possesses no antigenic relationship to Leporid herpesvirus 2 or to four other Leporid herpesviruses (Hinze, 1971a). The genome of the virus is similar to those of Herpesvirus saimiri and Epstein-Barr virus, in that it contains a variable number of repetitive DNA elements at both ends (Heine and Hinze, 1972, Cohrs and Rouhandeh, 1987, Rouhandeh and Cohrs, 1987, Medveczky et al., 1989).\n",

In experimentally infected Eastern Cottontail rabbits, herpesvirus was not recovered from feces, urine, milk, ejaculates, or conjunctival and genital secretions, but was isolated from the oral secretions of one of 15 infected rabbits (Spieker and Yuill, 1977a). Shedding of infectious virus in oral secretions, unrelated to age, sex, or season, was demonstrated in naturally infected Eastern Cottontail rabbits (Hinze and Lee, 1980). The tonsils are the likely site of persistent infection and virus is released into the oral cavity. Transplacental transmission of virus was not found (Spieker and Yuill, 1977a). Transmission by insect vectors was not detected (Spieker and Yuill, 1977b). Repeated attempts to infect domestic New Zealand White rabbits have met with failure (Hinze, 1971a).

Comparison of the reported characteristics of virus III with Herpesvirus cuniculi, however, indicates that they are identical (Nesburn, 1969). Virus III was isolated during attempts to find the etiologic agent of varicella (chicken pox). When inoculated into rabbits, the agent induced fever, exanthema, skin vesicles, corneal lesions, and intranuclear inclusions reminiscent of varicella infection (Rivers and Tillett, 1923). Convalescent sera from human varicella patients failed to inactivate the virus (Rivers and Tillett, 1924a). A similar virus was isolated from serially passaged normal rabbit testicular tissue during investigations of the etiology of rheumatic fever (Miller et al., 1924). McCartney isolated the virus while working on scarlet fever in England (Topacio and Hyde, 1932), and the agent has also been isolated by Doerr in Switzerland (Andrewes, 1928).",

Neutralizing antibodies to the virus were detected in 6% of 196 rabbits from Connecticut and Maryland (Swack and Hsiung, 1972). Nesburn (1969) was unable to reisolate the virus from over 100 batches of primary rabbit kidney cell cultures prepared since initial isolation of the virus.

Experimentally, intradermal inoculation of rabbits with virus resulted in pronounced erythema at the site of inoculation after 4\u20137 days, which usually disappears within 2 weeks (Rivers and Tillett, 1924a). Occasionally, generalized reactions with anorexia, diarrhea, emaciation, fever, and skin vesicles have been reported. Intradermal inoculation may result in erythematous papules, whereas corneal scarification caused swelling and vesiculation of corneal cells (Topacio and Hyde, 1932). Intratesticular inoculation of rabbits results in acute orchitis and fever within 3\u20134 days (Andrewes, 1928). Intramuscular and subcutaneous inoculation of rabbits failed to induce clinical signs; however, corneal scarification with virus resulted in mild punctate keratitis (Nesburn, 1969).

Morbidity was approximately 50%, with 29% mortality. Some rabbits died acutely with anorexia, the only sign observed prior to death. Recovered virus administered intranasally or by the cornea to New Zealand White rabbits caused severe acute disease within 4 days of inoculation with one out of four affected animals being euthanized due to severity of the disease.

Acute mortality associated with unidentified herpesviruses was reported in four adult Oryctolagus cuniculus in two rabbitries in Canada (Onderka et al., 1992, Swan, 1991). Acute death without clinical signs occurred in some rabbits as well as conjunctivitis, nasal discharge, edematous eyes and faces.

However, it is unclear if the herpesviruses responsible for these outbreaks are Gamma herpesviruses or Alpha herpesviruses related to LHV 4.",

Spontaneous cases of HHV-1 encephalitis presumably transmitted from humans to pet domestic European rabbits have also been reported (Grest et al., 2002, Gruber et al., 2009, M\u00fcller et al., 2009, Weissenb\u00f6ck et al., 1997). In each of these reports, rabbits with HHV-1 encephalitis were in close contact with a person with herpes labialis before they developed illness. The rabbits presented with neurological signs including anorexia, tonic-clonic spasms, circling, incoordination, ataxia, seizures, and opisthotonus. One rabbit also had a history of epiphora of the left eye, conjunctivitis, bruxism, and hypersalivation (M\u00fcller et al., 2009). Pathological findings included non-suppurative meningoencephalitis and large, eosinophilic intranuclear inclusion bodies in the neurons and glial cells. Diagnosis was confirmed by immunohistochemical labeling with polyclonal antibodies specific for HHV-1 (Grest et al., 2002, Gruber et al., 2009, Weissenb\u00f6ck et al., 1997), in situ hybridization using a DNA probe for HHV-1 (Gruber et al., 2009, M\u00fcller et al., 2009, Weissenb\u00f6ck et al., 1997), or PCR specific for the UL42 gene of HHV-1 (Grest et al., 2002, Gruber et al., 2009, Weissenb\u00f6ck et al., 1997).

They demonstrated the filterability of the infectious agent, transmitted it to other Eastern Cottontail rabbits as well as domestic European rabbits, and described the histopathology of the disease (Shope, 1935). Rabbit papillomatosis was initially considered a natural benign disease of Sylvilagus rabbits only; however, spontaneous outbreaks of papillomatosis in Oryctolagus cuniculus indicate that the disease has greater relevance (Hagen, 1966). Soon after discovery of the virus, it was also shown to cause malignant neoplasms histologically resembling squamous cell carcinomas (Kidd and Rous, 1940, Rous and Beard, 1934, Rous and Beard, 1935). This was the first recognition of an oncogenic virus in mammals. The disease has served as a model system to elucidate the role of viruses in the pathogenesis of cancer in humans and animals (Evans and Thomsen, 1969, Evans et al., 1962a, Evans et al., 1962b, Georges et al., 1984, Kreider and Bartlett, 1981, Kreider and Bartlett, 1985, Smith and Campo, 1985) and potential therapeutic interventions (Gambhira et al., 2007).",

            "text": "The virus is the type species of the genus Kappapapillomavirus (formerly Papillomavirus) of the family Papillomaviridae (Fauquet et al., 2005) and possesses the characteristic circular DNA genome, icosahedral structure, and other chemical and physical properties of this family (Gross, 1983, Kass and Knight, 1965, Murphy et al., 1981). The complete genome contains 7863 nucleotides (Giri et al., 1985) and consists of ten genes. All of the papilloma viruses have two capsid proteins (major L1 and minor L2) and although the C terminus of L1 is exposed on the surface of the viron, suggesting it may have an important role in immune responses, both proteins encode virus-neutralizing epitopes (Campo, 2003). The virus is antigenically distinct from other members of the genus Kappapapillomavirus. Nuclear (Yoshida and Ito, 1968) and cytoplasmic (Ishimoto et al., 1970) viral antigens have been demonstrated by immunofluorescence in virus-inoculated normal skin cells and virus-induced papillomas. However, the significance of these findings is difficult to interpret since controls for rabbit kidney vacuolating virus, a passenger virus (Hartley and Rowe, 1964), were usually not included (Kreider and Bartlett, 1981). The virus can be maintained by serial propagation in the skin of Sylvilagus rabbits, inoculated intracutaneously or scarified with virus (Shope and Hurst, 1933). Intramuscular inoculation does not result in clinical papillomatosis. Dogs, cats, pigs, goats, rats, mice, and guinea pigs are refractory to the virus. The skin of embryonic rats is susceptible to the virus, and typical papillomas develop following inoculation (Greene, 1953b); however, few papillomas develop, and they regress unless the host is immunosuppressed (Kreider et al., 1971). Cellular proliferation or neoplastic transformation by the virus has been reported in rabbit skin cell cultures (Coman, 1946), skin cultures derived from neonatal domestic European rabbits (DeMaeyer, 1962), and explants of embryonic rabbit skin (Greene, 1953a). Transplantation of transformed skin cultures into rabbits resulted in the formation of papillomas (Coman, 1946, Kreider, 1963). (see also Chapter 16).",

Contact transmission of papillomatosis may occur, but transmission of the virus by the rabbit tick (Haemaphysalis leporis-palustris) is probably the most common natural mode (Larson et al., 1936). Transmission by mosquitoes and reduviid bugs has been demonstrated experimentally (Dalmat, 1958). In commercial rabbitries, the mosquito may be the principal vector between wild Sylvilagus and domestic European rabbits (Hagen, 1966). This hypothesis is strengthened by the observation that in natural cases of disease in domestic European rabbits, lesions were confined to the relatively hairless parts of the body around the eyes, ears, and anus, areas where mosquitoes are more apt to feed. Nematodes may be involved in the natural transmission of virus (Rendtorff and Wilcox, 1957). Experimentally, papillomas were induced when papilloma virus and larvae of the nematode Nippostrongylus muris were applied to rabbit skin, but not by virus or nematode larvae alone.

The warts begin as red raised areas at the site of infection, grow to become typical papillomas with rough rounded surfaces, and may later develop into large, keratinized horny growths (Shope and Hurst, 1933). The virus was initially believed to cause only transient papillomatosis, but it was later shown that in naturally infected Sylvilagus rabbits papillomas may become malignant squamous cell carcinomas (Syverton and Berry, 1935). This phenomenon was later shown to be a relatively frequent occurrence in both naturally and experimentally infected Sylvilagus rabbits, as 25% of infected rabbits developed carcinomatous lesions following infection (Syverton et al., 1950). In approximately 35% of naturally infected rabbits, papillomas regress within 6 months after infection. In natural outbreaks of papillomatosis of domestic European rabbits in southern California (Hagen, 1966), papillomas most commonly occurred on the eyelids and ears. Experimentally induced papillomas develop more slowly in domestic European rabbits than in Sylvilagus rabbits, reach a stationary phase, and then occasionally regress (Syverton, 1952).\n",

A variant virus that contains the regressive E6 gene has a high rate of regression (Hu et al., 2002). Certain MHC haplotypes have been associated with regression or persistence in domestic European rabbits (Salmon et al., 2000). In one study, papillomas persisted when a regressive viral strain was used if rabbits were immunosuppressed with cyclosporine A treatment, but regression also varied with the strain of rabbit as more papillomas regressed in outbred New Zealand White rabbits than inbred EIII/JC rabbits (Hu et al., 2005). Once immunosuppression was removed, most papillomas regressed in outbred rabbits (67\u201389%), whereas only 13% regressed in inbred rabbits, highlighting the importance of multiple factors in persistence of papillomas. Rous and Beard, 1934, Rous and Beard, 1935 recognized the malignant potential of rabbit papillomavirus when they demonstrated that intramuscular inoculation of papillomatous tissue into domestic European rabbits resulted in invasive squamous cell carcinomas. In experimentally infected domestic European rabbits, 75% developed carcinomas if kept longer than 6 months (Syverton, 1952). Sylvilagus rabbits have a three-fold lower incidence of carcinomas than European rabbits (Rous and Beard, 1935, Syverton et al., 1950).\n",

Rabbits can be immunized by two intraperitoneal inoculations with glycerinated rabbit papilloma suspensions (Shope, 1937). Domestic rabbits with experimentally induced papillomas resist challenge with virus derived from papillomas of cottontail rabbits (Hagen, 1966).

They transmitted the virus to both domestic European and Sylvilagus rabbits and by cross-immunity tests and tissue-susceptibility studies demonstrated that it was distinct from the Cottontail rabbit (Shope) papillomavirus. They also showed that virus is frequently present in the mouths of rabbits without lesions and that tattooing or licking of tar stimulated lesion development in such carrier rabbits (Parsons and Kidd, 1943). A spontaneous outbreak in New York of rabbit oral papillomatosis, involving several breeds of domestic European rabbits, was described (Weisbroth and Scher, 1970).

The virus causes vacuolar cytopathic effects in cell cultures. The virus resembles the Cottontail rabbit papillomavirus but is a distinct virus. It does not produce papillomas when inoculated into rabbits and does not immunize rabbits against Cottontail rabbit papillomavirus. The virus is slightly smaller than the viruses of the genus Papillomavirus and resembles Polyomavirus in size, morphology, and DNA composition (Crawford and Follett, 1967). The virus has been classified as a member of the genus Polyomavirus within the family Polyomaviridae (Fauquet et al., 2005). Ultrastructurally, the virus is a typical Polyomavirus in its replication pattern (Chambers et al., 1966). The virus is not pathogenic for either domestic European or Eastern Cottontail rabbits or any other animal species. Inoculation of both neonatal and adult domestic and Eastern Cottontail rabbits by several routes did not induce disease (Hartley and Rowe, 1964). Antibodies to the virus have been found in wild Sylvilagus rabbits in Kansas and Maryland, but not in domestic European rabbits (Hartley and Rowe, 1964). The virus thus appears to be a fairly common non-pathogenic virus of Sylvilagus rabbits, causing only latent infections. Intranuclear inclusions consistent with rabbit kidney vacuolating virus have been found as an incidental finding in New Zealand White rabbits (Percy and Barthold, 2007). Although a contaminant of rabbit papillomas, the virus appears to have no role in the pathogenesis of papillomatosis (Goldman et al., 1972, Ito et al., 1968, Kreider and Bartlett, 1981).",

The virus was detected in primary rabbit kidney cultures stained with acridine orange although no cytopathic effect was observed. The virus failed to replicate in pig kidney, calf kidney, calf testicle, or human embryonic lung cells. Antisera to several swine and bovine adenoviruses failed to neutralize the virus, whereas a partial antigenic relationship to human adenoviruses was demonstrated by complement fixation and immunodiffusion tests. The virus agglutinated rabbit but not human erythrocytes. A serological survey of 30 Oryctolagus cuniculus from four rabbitries in Quebec revealed that three rabbits from three colonies had antibodies to bovine adenovirus type 1 (Descoteaux et al., 1980).",

Of 46 rabbit sera, collected from various sources in the United States, 75% had antibodies detected by immunofluorescence or hemagglutination inhibition assays (Metcalf et al., 1989). In Switzerland, over 70% of 132 rabbit sera from various commercial breeding colonies had antibodies in the hemagglutination inhibition test (Metcalf et al., 1989). Experimental inoculation, orally or intravenously, induced anorexia, listlessness, and catarrhal enteritis in 1-month-old rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus) (Matsunaga and Chino, 1981). Pathologic changes included catarrhal enteritis with hyperemia, exfoliation of the small intestinal epithelial cells, and increased secretion of intestinal mucus. Virus was detected in feces, small intestine, liver, pancreas, spleen, appendix, and mesenteric lymph node. Rabbits developed hemagglutination-inhibiting antibodies.",

Within each serogroup, rotaviruses are classified into serotypes, defined by reactivity against the outer capsid proteins VP4 (P type) and VP7 (G type). Since the glycoprotein VP7 appears to be immunodominant, classification of VP7 serotypes is more advanced and within group A, 15 serotypes (1\u201315) have been identified. All rabbit rotaviruses recovered to date have been serotype 3 (G3) (Tanaka et al., 1988, Thouless et al., 1986). Serotype 3 contains the largest and most diverse number of rotaviruses and is common to humans and several other animals.

Litters in such colonies have transplacentally acquired maternal antibodies to rotavirus at birth. In the absence of rotavirus infection, the antibodies fall to undetectable levels by 60 days of age. In colonies with endemic infection, shedding of rotavirus in the feces is detected in rabbits 4\u20137 weeks old (Peeters et al., 1984), followed by the appearance of naturally acquired antibodies in rabbits greater than 6 weeks old (DiGiacomo and Thouless, 1986). Subsequently, infected rabbits demonstrate antibodies for long periods. Hence, in infected colonies, rabbits usually acquire infection when maternal antibodies have declined to low concentrations, which usually coincides with weaning. Both sexes appear equally susceptible. Rotavirus infection in domesticated European rabbits has been reported in New Zealand White, Dutch, and Californian rabbits, suggesting no difference in breed susceptibility (Bryden et al., 1976).",

In another study, 11% of 18 fecal samples contained virus (Kudron et al., 1982). Rotavirus was detected in 9% of 106 fecal samples from healthy rabbits, 1\u20132 months old, from four rabbitries (DiGiacomo and Thouless, 1986). Hence, transmission probably occurs by fecal\u2013oral spread. Rabbits inoculated orally with rotavirus shed virus in the feces for 6\u20138 days, beginning 2\u20135 days after inoculation (Blutt et al., 2003, Castrucci et al., 1984, Conner et al., 1988, Hambraeus et al., 1989; Petrie et al., 1978; Thouless et al., 1988). Furthermore, uninoculated control rabbits maintained in the same room with inoculated rabbits also acquired rotavirus infection (Conner et al., 1988, Thouless et al., 1988). As fomite transmission appeared unlikely because of the handling of uninoculated rabbits first, it was concluded that rabbits were infected by airborne transmission of virus. In gastrically inoculated rabbits, rotavirus RNA was also detected in sera 4 days after inoculation (Blutt et al., 2003). Experimentally, rabbits were also infected with simian rhesus rotavirus (Ciarlet et al., 2000b).",

In outbreaks of diarrhea associated with rotavirus infection, rabbits 30\u201380 days old are usually affected (Castrucci et al., 1985, Peeters et al., 1984, Sato et al., 1982). Rabbits exhibit severe mucoid or watery diarrhea, anorexia, and dehydration, with mortality of 60\u201380%.

About 20% of litters were affected, with 98% mortality within 1\u20132 days after onset of signs. A similar disease was reported in a specific pathogen-free colony in which litters 7\u201321 days old exhibited watery diarrhea and lethargy (Schoeb et al., 1986).

Hence, in endemically infected colonies, other factors, including other infectious agents, may enhance the pathogenicity of rotavirus (Peeters et al., 1984). That rotavirus may be only mildly pathogenic is supported by experimental studies. In general, orogastric inoculation of rabbits, 1\u201322 weeks old, with rotavirus did not result in diarrhea, although some rabbits developed soft or fluid feces for 2\u20134 days (Conner et al., 1988, Hambraeus et al., 1989, Petric et al., 1978, Thouless et al., 1988). Whereas inoculation of one rotavirus strain induced diarrhea, depression, anorexia, and mortality in rabbits (Castrucci et al., 1984), this could not be repeated (Hambraeus et al., 1989). Inoculation of rabbits of various ages revealed that partially formed to liquid stools developed in 1-week-old rabbits but not in rabbits \u22652 weeks old (Ciarlet et al., 1998).

However, in both of the reports, the presence of other infectious agents was not examined. Peeters et al.

Histologically, the small intestine shows moderate to severe villous atrophy, more marked in the ileum. Apical enterocytes on the tips of villi are swollen, rounded, and desquamating; occasionally tips are denuded. The lamina propria is usually infiltrated with lymphocytes and occasional neutrophils. Lesions in the cecum are limited to focal areas of enterocyte desquamation. In outbreaks involving preweanling rabbits, gross lesions are most pronounced in the ileum (Peeters et al., 1982). Microscopically, there is villous atrophy and attenuation or desquamation of epithelial cells at the apical tips of jejunal or ileal villi (Peeters et al., 1982, Schoeb et al., 1986).

            "text": "Diarrhea caused by rotavirus is diagnosed from clinical signs, histopathology, detection of the virus, and demonstration of antibodies. Clinical signs and pathological findings alone are not diagnostic, although villous atrophy and degeneration and desquamation of enterocytes at the tips of villi in the small intestine are characteristic features. Rotaviral diarrhea must be differentiated from other diarrheal diseases of rabbits such as coccidiosis, salmonellosis, Tyzzer disease, clostridial enterotoxemia, enteric coronaviral enteritis, and colibacillosis. In weanling rabbits with severe disease, the possibility of dual infections should be considered, since rotavirus infections are usually mild. Electron microscopy (Ciarlet et al., 1998, Peeters et al., 1984, Schoeb et al., 1986) or a capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay can be used to detect rotavirus in feces (Blutt et al., 2003, Conner et al., 1988, De Leener et al., 2004, Hambraeus et al., 1989, Thouless et al., 1986, Thouless et al., 1988). A commercial human rotavirus detection kit, utilizing immunochromatography, tested with fecal samples from rabbits with diarrhea was shown to be applicable, as positive results were confirmed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and restriction endonuclease analysis (Fushuku and Fukuda, 2006). The electropherotype of rotaviruses can be determined by extraction of nucleic acid from feces and electrophoresis in polyacrylamide gel (De Leener et al., 2004, Herring et al., 1982). Cytoplasmic fluorescence can be observed at the tips of ileal villi using indirect immunofluorescence (Petric et al., 1978). Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), immunohistochemistry, and in situ hybridization can be used to detect rotavirus in formalin-fixed tissues (Tatti et al., 2002). Serum antibodies to rotavirus can be detected by enzyme immunoassay (Conner et al., 1991, Hambraeus et al., 1989, Kelkar et al., 2004, Thouless et al., 1988). Rabbits with rotaviral diarrhea usually have no or low concentrations of antibody to rotavirus, with a subsequent rise 2\u20134 weeks after onset of signs (Bryden et al., 1976, Sato et al., 1982). Unaffected littermates develop high antibody concentrations, reflecting concurrent subclinical infections.",

Infection appears to be acute and self-limiting. Experimentally, virus is shed in the feces for about 1 week following inoculation (Castrucci et al., 1984; Conner et at., 1988; Hambraeus et al., 1989, Petric et al., 1978, Thouless et al., 1988). Recovered rabbits are refractory to challenge with homologous (Castrucci et al., 1984, Ciarlet et al., 1998, Conner et al., 1988, Conner et al., 1991, Hambraeus et al., 1989) or heterologous rotaviruses (Hambraeus et al., 1989). Hence, cessation of breeding or quarantine of the colony for 4\u20136 weeks, to prevent the introduction of susceptible rabbits, should permit the infection to run its course. As seropositive dams are not infectious, their offspring should remain free of infection after maternal antibodies disappear. Early weaning of rabbits with high concentrations of passively acquired maternal antibodies and removal to isolated facilities offer the possibility of rederiving rabbits free of infection. Prevention of rotavirus infection depends on barrier maintenance of rabbits.",

            "text": "During the 1960s in Scandinavia, increased mortality in European rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus) inoculated with the Nichols strain of Treponema pallidum (Jorgensen, 1968) was attributed to a virus, named the Stockholm agent, present in rabbit testicular emulsions (Gudjonsson et al., 1970). As the principal necropsy finding was pleural effusion, the name pleural effusion disease was suggested (Fennestad et al., 1975). Later, it was shown that the major target organ was the heart, and the name infectious cardiomyopathy was suggested, since the etiologic agent appeared to be a coronavirus (Small et al., 1979). The resemblance of the clinicopathological features to feline infectious peritonitis, a systemic coronavirus infection of cats, was noted (Osterhaus et al., 1982). The failure to propagate the agent in vitro has precluded more definitive characterization. It is unclear whether the agent is a naturally occurring pathogen of rabbits or a virus from another species adapted to rabbits in contaminated treponemal stocks. However, the disease may be useful as a model for virus-induced cardiomyopathy (Alexander et al., 1992, Alexander et al., 1993, Baric et al., 1990, Edwards et al., 1992).",

Rabbits developed fever, circulatory insufficiency with pulmonary edema, and pleural effusion and had high mortality (Gudjonsson and Skog, 1970; Gudjonsson et al., 1970). Subsequent inoculation of rabbits with pulmonary tissue and pleural fluid from dead rabbits, previously inoculated with treponemes, resulted in a similar syndrome (Gudjonsson et al., 1970). Differential filtration of pleural fluid and serum from rabbits revealed an infectious particle size of 25\u201350 nm, which is ether-sensitive and inactivated at temperatures of 65\u00b0C or above but not at 56\u00b0C (Fennestad and MacNaughton, 1983, Gudjonsson et al., 1972, Small et al., 1979). Sera from rabbits contained pleomorphic virus particles, round or elliptic, 75\u2013100 nm in diameter, bearing club-shaped projections 15\u201320 nm long (Small et al., 1979), whereas plasma from rabbits contained high concentrations of pleomorphic virus-like particles measuring 51\u201398 nm in diameter with projections 8\u201313 nm long (Osterhaus et al., 1982). Infectious sera, passed in various cell lines, produced a cytopathic effect in primary rabbit kidney and newborn human intestine cells (Small et al., 1979). However, the cellular pathogenic effect was lost after two passages. Disease was not induced in mice, hamsters, or guinea pigs (Gudjonsson et al., 1970, Small et al., 1979).",

Prior incubation of the agent with antisera to CCV, FIPV, TGEV, or 229E virus reduced mortality in rabbits following inoculation. However, prior immunization of rabbits with CCV, FIV, or TGEV had little effect on survival. Immunofluorescent staining of cardiac tissue from diseased rabbits with antisera to 229E virus revealed antigen in myocardial interstitial tissue, and rabbits surviving infection developed antibodies to the virus in a complement fixation assay (Small et al., 1979). In another study, however, surviving rabbits failed to demonstrate antibodies against 229E virus in an enzyme immunoassay and neutralization test, and against OC43 virus in a complement fixation test (Fennestad and MacNaughton, 1983).",

By the end of the 1960s, however, mortality had increased to 35\u201340% owing to contamination of treponemal stocks with virus (Fennestad, 1985, Jorgensen, 1968). There is no difference in disease among breeds (Gudjonsson and Skog, 1970) or between rabbits in the United States and Sweden (Gudjonsson et al., 1970). The agent was detected in T. pallidum-infected rabbit tissues from Europe, the United States, and Japan (Fennestad et al., 1980). Nine isolates, obtained from treponema-infected rabbits in various countries, exhibited a wide range in pathogenicity when inoculated into rabbits (Fennestad et al., 1986). Whereas virtually all rabbits had fever, mortality ranged from 0 to 88%, and all surviving rabbits resisted challenge with a virulent strain. Two of four dams from litters inoculated at 6\u20139 days of age became infected, whereas uninoculated littermates or introduced cagemates failed to develop infection after exposure for several months (Fennestad et al., 1981).

During this early phase, acute deaths can occur without clinical signs of illness (Alexander et al., 1999). Clinical signs are often consistent with those of congestive heart failure including anorexia, weight loss, atony, tachypnea, and dyspnea. Iridocyclitis has been reported. With virulent strains, a third of infected rabbits die 3\u20135 days after inoculation, although deaths can occur until 14 days (Baric et al., 1990, Fennestad, 1985, Fennestad and MacNaughton, 1983, Fennestad et al., 1975, Fennestad et al., 1986, Fledelius et al., 1978, Gudj\u00f3nsson and Skog, 1970, Gudjonsson et al., 1970, Small et al., 1979). Generalized or hindquarter muscular weakness was also reported in rabbits surviving the acute phase of infection (Gudjonsson et al., 1970, Small et al., 1979). During the acute phase of infection, rabbits have a transient lymphopenia, followed by heterophilia (Fennestad et al., 1975). Red cell indices were also reduced but returned to normal by 6 weeks after inoculation. There was a transient hypoalbuminemia; however \u03b3-globulin increased significantly (Fennestad et al., 1975). Serum potassium and lactate dehydrogenase were elevated transiently. ECG abnormalities have been reported during the acute phase (days 3\u20135) including tachycardia in 74% of the infected rabbits, depressed R wave voltages (16%), reduced T wave voltages (45%) and QT (corrected) prolongation (32\u201342%) and correlated positively with mortality (Alexander et al., 1995, Alexander et al., 1999). Ninety percent of rabbits had persistent tachycardia in the subacute phase (days 6\u201312 after infection), ECG changes persisted, and echocardiographic changes in the subacute phase correlated positively with mortality. Surviving rabbits usually returned to normal in 3\u20134 weeks. However, ECG abnormalities persisted after day 30 in some rabbits, reflecting the development of dilated cardiomyopathy (Alexander et al., 1999). Reinoculation of surviving rabbits was without effect, indicating development of resistance to the agent (Fennestad, 1985, Fennestad and MacNaughton, 1983, Fennestad et al., 1986, Gudjonsson et al., 1970).",

The pleural cavities contain 2\u201350 ml of fluid, with or without fibrin, and few cells; ascites may also occur in rabbits dying after the first week. There are subepicardial and subendocardial hemorrhages. Other findings may include hepatosplenomegaly and congested lymph nodes. The heart weight is increased, and there is dilation of the right ventricle followed by dilation of the left ventricle. The cause of death appears to be congestive heart failure (Alexander et al., 1992, Alexander et al., 1993, Baric et al., 1990, Edwards et al., 1992, Small et al., 1979). In fatal cases, there is lymphoid depletion of the splenic follicles, focal degenerative changes of the thymus and lymph nodes, and mild proliferative changes of renal glomeruli (Christensen et al., 1978, Small et al., 1979). In rabbits that survive the acute phase, there is multifocal to diffuse myocardial degeneration and necrosis, focal hepatic necrosis, and proliferative changes in the spleen, lymph nodes, interstitial pulmonary tissue, and renal glomeruli. Lesions similar to those in the heart can occur in the diaphragm (Small et al., 1979). A mild non-suppurative, non-granulomatous anterior uveitis develops during the acute phase of infection and regresses within 4 weeks (Fledelius et al., 1978). At 65 days after infection, myocarditis is evident, and about one-third of rabbits had evidence of right- and/or left-sided cardiac dilation (Baric et al. 1990). After 2 years, rabbits had pulmonary lymphoid hyperplasia, lymphoid hyperplasia of lymph nodes and spleen, siderosis in the spleen, necrosis and periportal inflammation in the liver and interstitial fibrosis of the myocardium (Fennestad et al., 1986). No evidence of circulating or tissue immune complexes was found (Fennestad et al., 1981, Fennestad et al., 1986).",

Rabbits inoculated with virus-contaminated T. pallidum stocks that elicited no or mild disease without mortality were protected from disease when challenged with stocks contaminated with more pathogenic virus (Fennestad, 1985, Fennestad and MacNaughton, 1983, Fennestad et al., 1980, Fennestad et al., 1986, Gudjonsson et al., 1970). This indicated that some T. pallidum stocks were contaminated with a non-pathogenic variant of the virus, which was able to confer protection. Furthermore, isolates decreased in pathogenicity, as a function of time, in rabbits that survived acute infection (Fennestad, 1985, Fennestad et al., 1986). Convalescent sera from rabbits that survived infection partially protected challenged rabbits against mortality but not disease (Fennestad et al., 1981, Gudjonsson et al., 1970, Small et al., 1979). Passage of contaminated T. pallidum stocks through hamsters removed the agent responsible for disease (Fennestad et al., 1980, Skovgaard Jensen, 1971). Subsequent reintroduction of these T. pallidum stocks in rabbits was without effect. Similarly, inoculation of rabbits, with popliteal lymph nodes from surviving rabbits, transferred treponemes but not the agent (Gudjonsson et al., 1970).",

In rabbits inoculated orally, pleomorphic particles 60\u201390 nm, with surface projections of 10 nm, were detected in the feces (Osterhaus et al., 1982). Electron microscopy of fecal samples using antisera to rabbit coronavirus revealed immune aggregates of viral particles with morphological features of coronaviruses (Descoteaux et al., 1985). Analysis of structural polypeptides by immunoblotting revealed that antisera to avian infectious bronchitis virus (AIBV) and TGEV detected many of the same epitopes as antisera to the rabbit coronavirus (Descoteaux et al., 1985). Immune sera to 229E, but not AIBV nor porcine hemagglutinating encephalitis virus, inhibited the hemagglutination activity of the rabbit coronavirus.

In an experimental study, the small intestines were congested and the cecal contents watery (Descoteaux and Lussier, 1990).

            "text": "Rabbits with diarrheal disease are usually recently weaned and 3\u201310 weeks old (Eaton, 1984, LaPierre et al., 1980). Because the rabbit coronavirus agglutinates erythrocytes, the hemagglutination activity of the feces provides an indication of the presence of virus (LaPierre et al., 1980). Coronavirus particles can be demonstrated in the feces by electron (Eaton, 1984, LaPierre et al., 1980, Osterhaus et al., 1982, Peeters et al., 1984) and immunoelectron (Descoteaux and Lussier, 1990, Descoteaux et al., 1985) microscopy. The latter technique is more sensitive in detecting virus particles (Descoteaux et al., 1985). At necropsy, the cecal contents are fluid (Descoteaux and Lussier, 1990, Eaton, 1984); histologically, there is intestinal villous atrophy (Descoteaux and Lussier, 1990). Adult rabbits may have antibodies in the hemaglutination inhibition assay (LaPierre et al., 1980). As experimental inoculation of rabbits with coronavirus failed to mimic the field disease with its high morbidity and mortality, consideration should be given to the existence of co-pathogens (Descoteaux and Lussier, 1990, Osterhaus et al., 1982). In two studies where other agents were considered, coronavirus was associated with Esherichia coli and Clostridium perfringens infections (Eaton, 1984, Peeters et al., 1984).",

It was also being considered as a potential biological control agent for rabbits. The virus escaped and spread, first to other rabbits on Wardang Island, and then to the mainland. It resulted in significant mortality immediately, reducing rabbit populations in some areas by 95% (Mutze et al., 1998). It is currently endemic throughout Australia. In 1996, the New Zealand government was asked to consider the use of RHDV as a biological control agent (Thompson and Clark, 1997). The government denied these requests; however, RHDV was introduced to New Zealand illegally by farmers hoping to reduce local rabbit populations and is now widely distributed in both the North and South Islands of New Zealand (O\u2019Keefe et al., 1999, Thompson and Clark, 1997).",

The virus is non-enveloped, spherical, and 28\u201334 nm in diameter and has a buoyant density of 1.32\u20131.38 g/cm3. The icosahedral capsid has 32 cylindrical capsomeres, 5\u20136 nm in diameter, comprised of four structural polypeptides. The virus is a member of the family, Caliciviridae, and is the type virus of the genus, Lagovirus (Green et al., 2000). RHDV was completely sequenced and has a positive strand RNA genome of 7437 kb (Meyers et al., 1991a). The genomic organization is similar to EBHSV with two open reading frames (ORF) rather than the three ORFs found in other caliciviruses (Wirblich et al., 1996). The first ORF encodes non-structural proteins as well as the large capsid protein and the second ORF encodes an additional capsid protein. One subgenomic RNA (2.2 kb) is present (Ohlinger et al., 1990, Parra and Prieto, 1990). Amino acid identity between RHDV and EBHSV is approximately 76% (Wirblich et al., 1994). The virus agglutinates erythrocytes of humans and guinea pigs, but not rabbits. Non-hemagglutinating strains of RHDV have been identified (Tian et al., 2007). While the majority of strains of RHDV have a high level of amino acid identity, antigenic variants have been described (Capucci et al., 1998, Asgari et al., 1999, Shirrmaier et al., 1999).",

In a separate study, infectious virus was injected into bovine liver and then the liver was exposed outdoors to ambient temperatures (2\u201334\u00b0C) (Henning et al., 2005). Sufficient viral particles were present at the longest time point studied, 91 days, to infect rabbits when inoculated undiluted. Viral infectivity is unaffected by treatment with ether, chloroform, exposure to pH 3, or heating at 50\u00b0C. However, the virus is inactivated by 1% sodium hydroxide or 0.4% formaldehyde at ambient temperature, 4\u00b0C or 37\u00b0C. The virus fails to grow in many primary and established cell lines but has been adapted to a transformed rabbit kidney cell line (Ji et al., 1991, Xu, 1991). Rabbits may be the only species susceptible to infection, as inoculation of guinea pigs, hamsters, rats, or mice failed to induce disease. Experimentally, inoculation of European hares (Lepus europaeus) failed to induce disease (Lavazza et al., 1996, Smid et al., 1991).",

Contaminated fomites, such as feed, water, utensils, and animal attendants, may be important in transmission as well. Transmission by insects has been suggested as an explanation for the spread of RHDV from Wardang Island to the mainland. Laboratory experiments demonstrated that RHDV can be transmitted by blowflies (Phormia sp.), bushflies (Musca vetustissima) and mosquitoes (Gould et al., 1997, McColl et al., 2002). Transmission by the lesser brown blowfly, Calliphora dubia was suggested by evidence that RHDV RNA was detected in fly feces after flies were fed a meal from a RHDV-infected liver (Asgari et al., 1998). There is no evidence of vertical transmission. Fecal shedding by carnivores after ingestion of RHDV-infected carcasses has been suggested as a potential mode of spread. Serological evidence of infection in foxes has been demonstrated in several studies, although no infectious particles have been demonstrated (Fr\u00f6lich et al., 1998, Leighton et al., 1995; Philbey et al., 2005). Experimentally, the routes of entry, in order of importance, are oral, conjunctival, nasal, and skin trauma. In China and Europe, epidemics of disease usually begin in November and end in March. Although Oryctolagus cuniculus appears to be the only species susceptible to disease, hares in China also appear to be infected and capable of transmitting the virus to rabbits experimentally (Xu, 1991).",

Using another set of sera, collected between 1975 and 1987 from laboratory-maintained rabbits, antibodies were detected in 32 of 42 sera (76%). This suggests that rabbit colonies in Czechoslovakia harbored a viral agent with characteristics similar to those of Rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus, but with lower pathogenicity, several years before the syndrome was recognized in China.",

During outbreaks, the number of rabbits affected usually peaks in 2\u20133 days and lasts 7\u201313 days. After viral introduction, rabbits die suddenly with few clinical signs. Rabbits become febrile and exhibit depression, lethargy, and anorexia. Other clinical signs include tachypnea, cyanosis, abdominal distention, and constipation or diarrhea. Because the disease is acute, clinical signs may be brief and often are unnoticed. In the terminal stage, rabbits become hypothermic, recumbent, and have convulsions and epistaxis. Surviving rabbits exhibit depression, anorexia, and fever which usually abates in 2\u20133 days. In endemic areas, the form of disease observed in surviving rabbits is more common. Hematologic evaluation usually reveals a lymphopenia, a gradual decline in thrombocytes, and prolonged prothrombin and thrombin times. A paracoagulation test with protamine sulfate gives a strong positive reaction. Fibrin degradation products can be detected in most moribund rabbits.",

Small single or multiple intranuclear inclusion bodies can be found in degenerate hepatocytes. There is often little inflammation in necrotic areas. Many tissues, especially the lungs, spleen, and kidneys, may have varying degrees of congestion and hemorrhage due to microinfarction or major venous thrombi. Acute coagulative necrosis due to microinfarction may be found in any organ. Microinfarcts in the brain account for the terminal neurological signs. Pulmonary venous thrombosis accounts for the frothy serosanguinous discharge from the nares seen terminally. A segmental necrotizing enteritis with severe crypt necrosis and villous atrophy can be found (Gregg et al., 1991).

Virus can be detected with RT-PCR using multiple tissues including blood (Gall et al., 2007, Guittr\u00e9 et al., 1995, Shien et al., 2000, Vende et al., 1995, Wang et al., 2008, Yang et al., 2008). No satisfactory in vitro isolation methods have been described, and rabbit inoculation is the only method available to isolate or propagate a new strain of virus (O. I. E. 2008). Immunocapture RT-PCR was developed to simplify the tissue processing required to analyze numerous samples (Le Gall-Recul\u00e9 et al., 2001). By electron microscopy, viral particles, 28\u201334 nm in diameter, are frequently found in hepatocytes (Valicek et al., 1990, Xu and Chen, 1989). The hemagglutination test, with type O human erythrocytes, is useful for detection of virus in suspensions of liver, lungs, spleen, and kidneys, from infected rabbits (Shien et al., 2000, Xu and Chen, 1989). Antisera or monoclonal antibodies to the virus can detect virus in hepatocytes in infected rabbits by immunoenzyme and immunofluorescence tests (Berninger and House, 1995, Capucci et al., 1991, Carrasco et al., 1991, Gregg and House, 1989, Gregg et al., 1991, Park and Itakura, 1992, Rodak et al., 1990b, Rodak et al., 1991, Stoerckle-Berger et al., 1992). Serological tests include the hemagglutination inhibition test and the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, the latter being preferable because of increased sensitivity and specificity (Chasey et al., 1995, Cooke et al., 2000, Rodak et al., 1990b). Both indirect sandwich ELISAs and competitive-ELISAs have been developed for detection of antibodies (Guittr\u00e9 et al., 1995). Seroconversion to RHDV without clinical signs of disease is suggestive of RCV infection and should be interpreted with caution (Capucci et al., 1997).\n",

            "text": "Measures to prevent introduction of the virus include restricted access and disinfection of all equipment entering or leaving a facility (Xu and Chen, 1989). Cages and equipment can be disinfected with 0.5% sodium hypochlorite or 1% formalin. Rabbits from endemic areas should not be introduced directly into the colony, but quarantined for at least 1 month and tested serologically for anti-RHDV antibodies. Similarly, colonies with disease should be quarantined and depopulated, since surviving rabbits shed virus for at least a month and possibly longer (Gregg and House, 1989, Gregg et al., 1991). Antiserum has been shown to be protective (Du, 1990, Huang, 1991). Tissue-derived vaccines, inactivated with formaldehyde (Du, 1990, Du et al., 1986, Huang, 1991, Xu and Chen, 1989) or \u03b2-propiolactone (Arguello Villares, 1991, Smid et al., 1991), have been shown to be safe and efficacious in preventing disease. Resistance develops within 1\u20132 weeks after vaccination and lasts for 5\u201315 months. Although disease may be prevented in vaccinated rabbits, persistent infection may develop on exposure to the virus (House et al., 1990). Thus, vaccinated rabbits infected with virus should be considered infectious and should not be introduced into previously unexposed rabbitries. Additional vaccines have been developed, including those combining protection against both RHDV and myxomatosis (Bertagnoli et al., 1996, Calvete et al., 2004, Fern\u00e1ndez-Fern\u00e1ndez et al., 2001, Torres et al., 2001). Since the decline of rabbit populations in southern France and the Iberian peninsula has affected the survival of rabbit-prey species (Marchandeau et al,. 2000), vaccination of free-living rabbits has been undertaken in a field trial on an island off Spain and subsequently on the mainland (Calvete et al., 2004, Torres et al., 2001).",

Sequencing of the genome (Gould et al., 1997, Le Gall et al., 1996; Meyers et al., 1991b; Nowotny et al., 1997, Parra et al., 1993, Rasschaert et al., 1995, Wirblich et al., 1994) revealed that RHDV and EBHSV have similar genomic organization and are both members of the family, Caliciviridae, and the genus, Lagovirus, however they represent two distinct species (Green et al., 2000).

Thirty-eight percent of hares tested in Poland were positive for EBHSV antibodies (Fr\u00f6lich et al, 1996), 29% in Germany (Fr\u00f6lich et al., 2003) while 73% of hares shot by hunters in Slovakia had anti-EBHSV antibodies, suggesting some variation in the prevalence of infection.",

Contamination of feed and water with excreta from infected hares is probably a common mode of transmission (Gavier-Widen and Morner, 1991). Among wild and farmed hares in Denmark and Sweden, mortality is seasonal, beginning in October and continuing through March (Gavier-Widen and Morner, 1991, Henriksen et al., 1989), presumably as there are more young susceptible hares at the end of the breeding season. Recent evidence from Finland indicates that the majority of the cases occurred in the spring and summer, with a minor peak in October and November (Syrj\u00e4l\u00e4 et al., 2005). The hare population in Finland was lowest in winter and this may influence transmission. In England, excess mortality in wild hares was reported in September through November (Chasey and Duff, 1990).",

Death occurs 5\u201324 h after onset of signs, and affected hares rarely recover. The reported morbidity is 75%, and mortality approaches 100% (Gavier-Widen and Morner, 1991, Henriksen et al., 1989).

Gross examination of hares reveals marked pulmonary congestion and edema, as well as hepatic congestion and hemorrhages. Moderate splenomegaly and gastric ulceration are detected in some hares. A catarrhal to necrotizing conjunctivitis may be present. Microscopically, there is diffuse acute coagulation necrosis of hepatic periportal and midzonal areas, accompanied by formation of acidophilic bodies (GavierWiden and Morner, 1991; Henriksen et al., 1989). In many hares, there is basophilic stippling in the cytoplasm of hepatocytes in periportal areas, representing granular calcification. Many livers have microvacuolar fatty degeneration. About one-fourth of affected hares have splenic cellular depletion and hyaline-like changes in the sinuses and cords, and about one-third have renal tubular necrosis and calcification. In the brain, cerebral neurons and cerebellar Purkinje cells exhibit granulovacuolar degeneration. In apparently healthy hares with antibodies to the virus, hepatic vacuolar degeneration, tracheitis, and hyperplasia of splenic follicles are observed (Marcato et al., 1991).",

Currently, similar viruses have been isolated from Italy (RCV), Eire (Lambay Island strain), and Australia (RCV-A1) (Capucci et al., 1996, Forrester et al., 2007, Strive et al., 2009). Genome organization is similar to RHDV and EBHSV in that there are two open reading frames as opposed to three which are found in other caliciviruses (Capucci et al., 1996, Strive et al., 2009). RCV is most closely related to RHDV with an amino acid identity of 91% of the capsid protein, VP60. The amino acid identity to EBHSV was 75% in the same study (Capucci et al., 1996). The average identity of the full-length sequence of RCV-A1 when compared to RHDV was 87%. Phylogenetic analysis of RCV, the Lambay Island strain, and the Ashington strain (England) suggests that these isolates are more closely related to each other than to other strains of RHDV (Capucci et al., 1996, Forrester et al., 2007, Strive et al., 2009). Interestingly, the Ashington strain was isolated from a rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus) with typical signs of RHDV. Antigenically, sera from rabbits infected with RCV cross-reacted with anti-RHDV antibodies, but not anti-EBHSV antibodies (Capucci et al., 1996). Sera from ten of 11 healthy rabbits on Lambay Island, Eire, also cross-reacted with antibody to RHDV (Forrester et al., 2007) and RT-PCR detected virus sequences shown to be closely related to RCV from two serum samples.",

Viral RNA was detected in Peyer\u2019s patches, spleen, and less frequently in liver. Experimental inoculation of Oryctolagus cuniculus with RCV by oronasal route resulted in seroconversion by day 6 after inoculation (Capucci et al., 1996). Uninoculated cagemates of infected rabbits were seropositive 1\u20132 days later, presumably from contact. Rabbits housed in the same room that had no contact with the infected rabbits did not seroconvert. RT-PCR detected viral antigens from the intestine of infected rabbits 3, 5, 6, and 7 days after inoculation but not from the liver or spleen. Western blot analyses of intestinal extracts were also positive. Infection with RCV provided complete protection from challenge with RHDV. Inoculation of hares with RCV resulted in no seroconversion and 5 days after inoculation all organs were negative for RCV by RT-PCR. Hares previously inoculated with RCV and then challenged with EBHSV were not protected from disease.",

The agent causes a cytopathic effect and syncytia in monkey and hamster kidney cell cultures. Experimentally, suckling mice are susceptible to the virus, but weaned mice, guinea pigs, domestic European and Eastern Cottontail rabbits failed to develop signs or lesions, although antibodies developed, following inoculation. Sera from eight of 25 (32%) Eastern Cottontail rabbits trapped in the same area as the original rabbit had antibodies to the virus. Antibodies to the virus were not detected in sera from seven other species trapped in the same area, Oryctolagus cuniculus, or humans. The virus resembles the paramyxoviruses in size, nucleic acid type, and in ether and heat sensitivity. Neither hemagglutination nor hemadsorption were observed, and the ultrastructure of the virus has not been described. The virus is serologically distinct from the known paramyxoviruses.",

Sendai virus is the type species of the genus Respirovirus, family Paramyxoviridae (Fauquet et al., 2005) and a primary pathogen of mice (Percy and Barthold, 2007). A serological survey of 23 breeding and laboratory colonies, in metropolitan Tokyo and Ibaragi, Chiba, Saitama, Kanagawa, Shizuoka, and Nagano prefectures, revealed that 85 of 160 (53%) Japanese White or New Zealand White rabbits had antibodies to Sendai virus (Iwai et al., 1986). Ito et al. (1987) also detected antibodies to Sendai virus in rabbit sera in studies comparing antigenic relationships among paramyxoviruses. Intranasal inoculation of Oryctolagus cuniculus with Sendai virus resulted in infection as rabbits shed virus for 3\u20137 days after inoculation, and viral antigen was detected by immunofluorescence in the nasal cavities (Machii et al., 1989). Although rabbits showed no clinical signs and had only a moderate increase of goblet cells in the nasal epithelium, antibodies to the virus developed. One of three uninoculated rabbits exposed to inoculated rabbits acquired infection. These studies suggest that Oryctolagus cuniculus is susceptible to Sendai virus and that this or a related virus may be endemic in rabbit colonies. Experimentally, genetically modified Sendai viruses have been used in gene therapy in rabbits (Nakamura et al., 1998).",

Clinical disease in infected hares has not been reported. Experimental infection of European rabbits results in viremia and antibody formation without clinical disease (Hammon and Sather, 1966, Simkova, 1962). Thus, domestic European rabbits are useful as sentinels of viral activity since they develop antibodies and can serve as a source for recovery of virus (Kolman et al., 1966, McKiel et al., 1966\n). A serological survey in Finland revealed that 5% of Mountain hares (Lepus timidus) and none of the Lepus europeaus tested had antibodies against Inkoo virus (Brummer-Korvenkontio, 1973).

Cache valley virus has a wide geographic distribution in North America (Blackmore and Grimstad, 2008), whereas Tensaw virus is found predominantly in the Southeastern United States (Bigler et al., 1975) and Northway virus in Alaska and California (Campbell et al., 1990, Campbell et al., 1991, Walters et al., 1999, Zarnke et al., 1983). Recent evidence suggests these host ranges may not be as restrictive as earlier thought (Sahu et al., 2002). The amplifying hosts for all of these viruses are unclear, however antibodies recognizing Cache valley virus have been found in Desert cottontails (Sylvilagus audubonii), Eastern cottontails (Sylvilagus floridanus), and Black-tailed jackrabbits (Lepus californicus) (Blackmore and Grimstad, 2008). Antibodies to Tensaw virus have been found in the Swamp rabbit (Sylvilagus acquaticus) (Calisher et al., 1986), Marsh rabbit (Sylvilagus palustris) (Bigler et al., 1975), and New England cottontail rabbit (Sylvilagus transitionalis) (Sudia et al., 1969) and those to Northway virus in the Snowshoe hare (Lepus americanus) (Zarnke et al., 1983). Experimental infection of Eastern cottontail rabbits with Cache valley virus resulted in transient viremia of insufficient magnitude to infect mosquitoes (Coquillettidia perturbans) suggesting that this species may not be an important vertebrate host for this virus (Blackmore and Grimstad, 2008). In contrast, rabbits and hares may be important hosts for Tensaw and Northway viruses as experimental infection of New England cottontail rabbits (Sylvilagus transitionalis) with Tensaw virus resulted in viremia of sufficient magnitude to infect mosquitoes (Anopheles quadrimaculatus) (Sudia et al., 1969). Living near Snowshoe hares (Lepus americanus) was found to be a significant risk factor for human serologic reactivity to Northway virus (Walters et al., 1999).",

Antibodies to St. Louis encephalitis virus have been detected in Snowshoe hares (Lepus americanus) (Yuill et al., 1969). Experimentally, Eastern cottontail rabbits (Sylvilagus floridanus) have been shown to be susceptible to WNV infection (Tiawsirisup et al., 2005). WNV is a mosquito-transmitted pathogen of significant public health importance (Hayes et al., 2005). The major route of infection of humans is by the bite of a mosquito infected by ingesting a blood meal from an infected bird. In general, mammalian hosts of WNV are dead-end hosts and do not develop viremia of sufficient magnitude to infect mosquitoes (Bowen and Nemeth, 2007). However, certain species, including Eastern cottontail rabbits (Sylvilagus floridanus), develop viremia which infects mosquitoes (Culex pipiens and\nCulex salinarius) and therefore, may contribute to the endemic cycle of WNV in North America (Tiawsirisup et al., 2005). Infection in rabbits occurs without clinical signs. Powassan virus is a tick-borne virus of emerging public health concern in the United States, Canada, and Russia (Ebel, 2010). Antibodies to Powassan virus have been found in Snowshoe hares (Lepus americanus) (McLean et al., 1961, Zarnke and Yuill, 1981). Snowshoe hares experimentally infected with the virus develop no clinical symptoms, but become viremic for 1\u20133 days. Other vertebrates, including red squirrels (Tamiasciurus hudsonicus), chipmunks (Tamias amoenus), groundhogs (Marmota monax), and white-footed mice (Peromyscus leucopus) may be more important in perpetuating the virus than Snowshoe hares (Ebel, 2010).",

Picobirnaviruses are non-enveloped bisegmented, double-stranded RNA viruses of 35\u201340 nm in diameter. Members of this family of viruses have been found in the feces of many different hosts, including humans, pigs, rabbits, dogs, rats, snakes, and birds (Fregolente et al., 2009). They are thought to be opportunistic gastrointestinal pathogens associated with clinical disease in humans (Giordano et al., 1999). These viruses have been associated with gastrointestinal disease in HIV-infected humans (Giordano et al., 1999; Grohmann et al., 1993) and may be important pathogens or co-pathogens in immunosuppressed rabbits. The picobirnavirus genome detected in rabbits consisted of two segments; 2.3 kbp and 1.85 kbp (Gallimore et al., 1993). The first segment contains one major ORF and two smaller ORFs and has been partially sequenced (Green et al., 1999). This segment is thought to encode a capsid protein while the second segment appears to encode an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (Rosen et al., 2000). Picobirnaviruses do not replicate in tissue culture, although they were successfully detected in the feces of rabbits inoculated orally with rabbit Picobirnavirus (Gallimore et al., 1993, Ludert et al., 1995). No clinical signs of disease resulted, however, anti-Picobirnavirus antibodies developed (Gallimore et al., 1993).",

            "text": "Rabies virus, the type species of the genus Lyssavirus and family Rhabdoviridae (Fauquet et al., 2005), is a neurotropic virus that infects mammals resulting in a generally fatal, progressive encephalomyelitis (Manning et al., 2008). It is found in high titers in the saliva of clinically ill animals and is typically transmitted through a bite. Rabies virus infections in rabbits and hares are rare, as these species often do not survive encounters with rabid animals. From 1971 to 1984, seven rabid rabbits were reported to the CDC, including four Eastern cottontails (Sylvilagus floridanus) (Fishbein et al., 1986), while in the next 9 years, 17 cases of rabies in rabbits were reported to the CDC (Childs et al., 1997). Of these 17, 11 were domestic European rabbits (Oryctolagus cunniculus) and the others were unknown. Four viruses were typed and shown to be either raccoon or skunk variants of rabies virus. In 1995, raccoon-variant rabies was reported in seven domestic European rabbits in New York State (Eidson et al., 2005). Rabies is typically diagnosed by fluorescent antibody test on brain tissue, however, strains may be further identified using monoclonal antibodies or genetic means such as nucleic acid probes, PCR, and DNA sequencing (O. I. E., 2008).",
