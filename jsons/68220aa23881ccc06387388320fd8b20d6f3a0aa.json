If the spread of infection is not controlled, the R0 of SARS-CoV-2 is such that it will sweep swiftly through the susceptible population, resulting in a large number of very ill persons within a short period of time, which overloads the health system and causes it to collapse. However, it is clearly possible to slow down transmission through social and physical distancing, as has been demonstrated in Sri Lanka. If the infection is allowed to spread slowly, a large proportion of infected persons will recover without requiring hospital care (or not even fall ill at all), some will require hospitalization, and a few, especially the elderly and others with co-morbidities, will die. The availability of beds and ventilators in hospital intensive care units (ICU), to care for critically ill patients is a major constraining factor, and Sri Lanka will need to closely monitor and control the rate of spread of infection so that the requirement for ICU beds and ventilators remains within the available capacity. This paper proposes a theoretical basis for estimating the limit within which the reproduction number should be constrained, in order to ensure that the infection spreads slowly, and the COVID-19 case load remains within the capacity of Sri Lanka's health system.",

The flattening out of the case load could be attributed to the strict social distancing and lockdown of cities in the country. Figure 2 illustrates the behavior of the caseload in these 2 phases using a log linear model with (with an exponential function of time) for the period to day 8, and after day 8 using a linear model (with a linear function of time).

            "text": "-19 is the disease caused by a new coronavirus (SARS CoV-2) that emerged in China in December 2019. Although it causes an asymptomatic or mild infection in most instances, it can cause severe respiratory illness or even death. Transmission is mainly via droplets released into the air when an infected person coughs or sneezes. However, aerosol and fomite transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is also possible, since the virus can remain viable and infectious in aerosols for hours and on surfaces up to days, depending on the inoculum shed (van Doremalen et al, 2020). There is no vaccine at present, nor is there any antiviral agent of proven efficacy; the principle preventative measures relate to social distancing and personal hygiene. The basic reproduction number (R0) is a central concept in infectious disease epidemiology, representing the average number of new infections generated by an infectious person in a completely susceptible population. For COVID-19, R0 has been estimated by the WHO to be 1.4 -2.5. Others have placed it higher, at a median of 2.79 with an interquartile (IQR) range of 1.16 (Liu et al 2020). For comparison, seasonal flu has a reported median R0 of 1.28 (IQR, 1.19-1.37), while measles has an R0 of 12-18",

The first of the 4 scenarios presented above suggests that the ICU bed requirement would not exceed 300 over a 6-month period if R is kept at 1.2. In this scenario, the number of new infections would rise very slowly at a level below that seen at present, with extremely stringent measures to enforce social distancing. It is therefore very unlikely to occur when social distancing measures are relaxed. The second scenario (R=1.5) envisages a situation where the number of new infections rise more rapidly from 16 on Day 7, to 20 on Day 14, 36 on Day 30 and 104 on Day 60 (the number of symptomatic cases would be half these values). At this level of transmission, which",
