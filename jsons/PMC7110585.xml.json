This pleomorphic renal adenocarcinoma had multiple metastases to the lung, liver, greater omentum, right renal pelvis, and systemic lymph nodes. The tumor cells were pleomorphic with a large number of giant cells and arranged in tubular and cystic patterns. It was confirmed of renal origin by immunohistochemistry with strong positive CD10 and cytokeratin.13 Two cases of transitional cell carcinoma arising from the renal pelvis, with 1 completely replacing the kidney, have been reported.

From a study evaluating more than 100 rabbit uroliths, the most common were calcium carbonate (69.4%), compound (23%), and mixed (3.3%).19 Radiographs are usually confirmatory because calcium carbonate is radiopaque (Fig. 7\n). The predominance of calcium-based uroliths is most likely caused by the unique calcium metabolism of rabbits. Excess dietary calcium is absorbed unregulated, resulting in increased plasma calcium concentrations and excretion of excess calcium in the urine. Therefore, serum and urinary calcium levels are related to dietary intake. Urinary calcium can bind with other constituents when conditions are met for crystallization, such as dehydration, changes in pH, and urine retention, to form both the sludge (which can appear as thick white to yellow material) and uroliths. Abnormal accumulations of calcium (sludge) are more common in older rabbits, possibly because of decreased mobility or water consumption.34 There are rare reports of uroliths composed of silica, struvite, and calcium sulfate dehydrate or gypsum.35 The gypsum urolith was associated with the rabbit eating gypsum-based plaster that was covered by a white paint containing barium sulfate.",

The problem relates to difficulties in establishing a diagnosis, and the observation that many affected rabbits recover spontaneously without treatment.42 Rabbits with severe renal disease secondary to E cuniculi may not harbor renal organisms, and treatment is focused on managing acute or chronic renal failure. Treatment of E cuniculi has relied on benzimidazoles, such as fenbendazole,42 but recently severe disease and deaths have been reported in rabbits treated with this class of drugs.43 Benzimidazoles are radiomimetic and toxicity has been observed in many species; Graham and colleagues43 recently reported deaths in 13 rabbits treated with various dosages of several drugs, including fenbendazole, albendazole, and oxibendazole. Clinical signs in rabbits were nonspecific and histopathology showed depletion of all bone marrow cell lines. For this reason, treatment should not be approached lightly, and serial monitoring of the complete blood count may be beneficial.",
