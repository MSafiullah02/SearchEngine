The question we ask here is whether more of fewer Stop mutations are observed at all of the altered Ser/Leu sites combined, rather than at individual sites. This increases our sample size by approximately 100-fold, thereby further increasing our statistical power. To model the frequency of 'false' stop codons due to sequencing error, we use a Poisson background noise model (a standard for estimating independent rare errors under minimal additional structural assumptions, which has already been used to model NGS error rates in the context of minority variant discovery) 1,2 . Since sequencing errors are nucleotide-context dependent 3 , and the number of stop codons that can be reached by a single mutation is different for different 1-to-stop codons, we model , the number of observed stop codons for sample at site , as an observation of the random variable:",

Only samples from the same run are compared, to ignore noise due to batch effect. Each codon site that had a 1-to-Stop codon in the wild type genome (and thus the identical codon, in the identical context, in the 1to-Stop construct) was considered. The nucleotide contexts coincide with the 1-to-Stop codons (UUA, UUG, UCA and UCG), since a mutation that produces a stop codon must change the middle nucleotide in the codon. To produce a single confidence interval for the stop codon error rate for each sequencing run, the confidence intervals for the different nucleotide contexts, UUA , UUG , UCA and UCG , were averaged with weights proportional to the number of codon sites for each context. Thus, considering the 1-to-Stop codon sites, if the sequencing error rates were at the upper endpoints of the 95% confidence intervals, the contribution of sequencing errors to the stop codon frequency as it was computed (sum over all Leu/Ser) would be ~10 \u22126 \u00d7 100 = 10 \u22124 for the 1-to-Stop virus, which is still more than 10 times below the observed frequencies.",
