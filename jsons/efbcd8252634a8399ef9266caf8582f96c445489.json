The PVP-I gel forming nasal spray (IVIEW-1503) and PVP-I gel forming ophthalmic eye drop (IVIEW-1201) rapidly inactivated SARS-CoV-2, inhibiting the viral infection of VERO76 cells. No toxicity was observed for the PVP-I formulations. Significant inactivation was noted with preincubation of the virus with these PVP-I formulations at the lowest concentrations tested. It has been demonstrated that both PVP-I formulations can inactivate SARS-CoV-2 virus efficiently in both a dose-dependent and a timedependent manner. These results suggest IVIEW-1503 and IVIEW-1201 could be potential agents to reduce or prevent the transmission of the virus through the nasal cavity and the eye, respectively. Further studies are needed to clinically evaluate these formulations in early-stage COVID-19 patients.",

SARS-Cov-2 has a unique pathogenesis because it causes both upper and lower respiratory tract infections (9) . SARS-CoV-2 is classified as a novel betacoronavirus belonging to the sarbecovirus subgenus of Coronaviridae family. The genome sequence of SARS-CoV-2 is about 89% identical to bat SARS-like-CoVZXC21 and 82% identical to human SARS-CoV. It has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 uses the same cell entry receptor, ACE2, to infect humans as SARS-CoV, so clinical similarity between the two viruses is expected, particularly in severe cases (10) .",

It is most contagious when people are symptomatic, however, it may also spread when a person is asymptomatic (13). Nasal cells are identified as the key entry point for SARS-CoV-2 (14) . Goblet and ciliated cells in the nose have high levels of the entry proteins ACE-2 and TMPRSS2 that SARS-CoV-2 uses to get into human cells. The virus exploits existing secretory pathways in nasal goblet cells sustained at a pre-symptomatic stage. Nasal carriage is likely to be a key feature of transmission, therefore drugs administered intranasally could be highly effective in limiting spread. The two key entry proteins ACE2 and TMPRSS2 were also found in cells in the cornea of the eye, ocular as another route of infection (14, 15) . With SARS-CoV-2 detected in human tears, ocular secretions might be a potential for human to human spread (16) . There is controversy on whether the eye could be a transmission route for COVID-19, however, even if COVID 19 positive patients have no virus shedding through tears, the eye remains a potential portal of entry for ocular and systemic disease from the virus (16) . Therefore, developing nasal and ocular treatment to reduce and prevent transmission of the debilitating virus is a viable while potentially highly effective strategy.",

It is a powerful disinfectant with broad-spectrum application and is effective against viruses, bacteria, fungi, and mold spores. PVP-I products have been used as disinfectant for the inactivation of various bacteria and viruses for years because of their strong bactericidal and antiviral activities. Povidone-iodine (PVP-I) is routinely used in ophthalmology and general surgery. PVP-I has been used in acute and chronic treatment of a variety of human indications. There have been numerous clinical studies demonstrating the safety of PVP-I in a variety of topical applications in ophthalmology, otology, rhinology and dermatology (18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24) . PVP-I in nasal usage was also well documented, including both single use (24, 25) and multiple applications. 3M Company introduced PVP-I based skin and nasal antiseptic (Povidone Iodine Solution 5% w/w [0.5% available iodine] USP). It has rapid, broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity, which reduces nasal bacteria, including S. aureus, by 99.5% in just one hour and maintains this reduction for at least 12 hours (26, 27) . In the clinical setting, rhinologists and oral surgeons commonly use higher concentrations of PVP-I for various antimicrobial therapies as it offers an affordable, potent, well-tolerated and widely available antiseptic option with little to no cross-resistance. Gluck and colleagues reported a phase I study (n=35) assessing tolerability and local effect of a PVP-I spray (PVP-I 2.2 or 4.4%) in single and repeated (3 times a day for 3 days). No safety-relevant finding or serious adverse events were reported, no evidence for cyto-nor genotoxicity obtained (28) .",

Sixty healthy rats (60) were selected for the test and equally distributed into four test groups and two recovery groups (control and high dose). Intranasal administration of the formulation at dose levels of 25, 50 and 75 \u00b5l and saline control at dose levels of 75 \u00b5l were evaluated. The saline control or the test substance was administered into the right nostril via a 200 \u00b5l pipette twice daily (approximately 12 hours apart). The animals were observed at least once daily for viability, signs of gross toxicity, and behavioral changes, and weekly for a battery of detailed observations. All main study animals were subjected to a necropsy of the upper respiratory tract and related sinuses at study termination (Day 29).",

Its mechanism has been used to prevent the transport of virions to the replication site by altering pH and block viral endocytosis to hosts (49) . However, in a recent COVID-19 trial consisting of 36 patients, 14 patients treated with hydroxychloroquine have continued to show symptoms of upper or lower respiratory tract infections (50) . Although hydroxychloroquine has increased potency and tolerable safety profile compared to chloroquine, potential adverse effects such as electrolyte imbalance and fatal dysrhythmias could take place (50) . Another possible therapy, Remdesivir \u00ae , a nucleotide analogue, inhibits viral RNA polymerase and was developed as a substance to combat ebolaviruses, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV (49, 52, 53) . With significant results in in vitro testing against SARS-CoV-2, the therapy appears to be another potential prophylaxis. PVP-I is a low-cost topical medication which could significantly reduce the burden on the existing health care system if it is proven to be effective in reducing viral load. Presently, the estimated cost of managing a patient with proven positivity for COVID 19 but without any complications is $9,673. For a patient with complications or co-morbidity it is $13,767 and for a patient with major complications or co-morbidity it increases to $20,292 (54) . If we only assess the deceased patients (281,399 by May 10, 2020) and presume that they were hospitalized without complications prior to their death, the amount globally spent to treat this condition would be over 2.72 billion USD. This still does not include testing costs or healthcare costs for those patients with mild to moderate complications.",

Simulated tear fluid consisted of NaHCO 3 (CAS 144-55-8), NaCl (CAS 7647-14-5), CaCl 2 (CAS 7440-70-2), KCl (CAS 7447-40-7) (Spectrum Chemicals, New Brunswick, NJ) and water. Simulated nasal fluid consisted of NaCl, CaCl 2 , KCl and water. In addition, ethanol (CAS 64-17-5) (Spectrum Chemicals, New Brunswick, NJ) was used as supplied. Povidone-iodine (1-vinyl-2-pyrrolidinone polymers, iodine complex], USP, CAS 25655-41-8) is supplied by Ashland. Virus strains and cell culture SARS-CoV-2 (strain USA_WA1/2020, prepared by Natalie Thornburg, CDC and provided by WRCEVA, University of Texas Medical Branch) virus stocks were prepared by growing virus in VERO 76 cells (ATCC \u00ae , CRL-1587, ATCC, Manassas, Virginia).

Formulation Development Both formulations (IVIEW-1201 and IVIEW-1503) are brownish aqueous gel forming solutions of containing 1.0% and 0.6% (w/w) polyvinylpyrrolidinone-iodine complex (Povidone-Iodine), [1-vinyl-2-pyrrolidinone polymers, iodine complex], respectively. IVIEW-1201 is packaged in polypropylene (PP) plastic eye drop bottle; and IVIEW-1503 is packaged in amber glass bottle equipped with Aptar nasal spray pump for intranasal application. We have developed a proprietary PVP-I based sustained release platform technology (41,42) to produce in-situ gel forming formulations where the effective concentration of PVP-I is maintained by the equilibrium between solution PVP-I and the gel bound components resulting in a long-lasting, less toxic pharmacological effect in the eye and nasal cavity. The in-situ gel forming PVP-I composition is formulated with ion-sensitive in-situ gel forming materials such as Deacetylated Gellan Gum (Gelrite \u00ae ) to increase the residence time of the dosage form in the eye and on the nasal mucosa. Preparations of PVP-I with gellan gum are dropped into eyes or sprayed into nasal cavity; gel formation takes place, induced by the electrolytes (Na + , K + , Ca 2+ , etc.) of the tear fluid or nasal fluid (43).",

Repeated topical dosing of each povidone iodine-containing formulation was associated with brief behavioral signs of irritation after each drop (squinting and pawing of eyes), transient signs of mild ocular irritation, and persistent corneal staining. In Groups 2 and 3, mild to moderate ocular irritation was observed, characterized primarily by conjunctival involvement, and was more pronounced on Day 1 after the last dose, then lessened with time. A dose response with the irritation was observed whereby Group 3 (1.0% PVP-I) showed more signs of irritation, including transient corneal involvement, than Group 2 (0.6% PVP-I). At the end of Day 1, the mean global staining score was highest for Group 2 (0.6% PVP-I) for both fluorescein and rose Bengal staining as compared to Group 3 (1.0% PVP-I). The corneal staining in Group 2 (0.6% PVP-I) was lower at the Day 4 exam; the fluorescein staining plateaued between Days 4 and 7, whereas the rose Bengal staining continued to decrease in intensity. On Days 4 and 7, the staining in Group 2(0.6% PVP-I) was lower than the staining for Groups 3 (1.0% PVP-I). The fluorescein and rose Bengal staining scores for Groups 3 (1.0% PVP-I) did not change dramatically from Day 1 last dose scores. In conclusion, the repeated topical administration of povidone iodine-containing gel forming formulations over 7-days was associated with mild and transient signs of ocular irritation. Corneal staining with both fluorescein and rose Bengal was observed in both Group 2 (0.6% PVP-I) and Group 3 (1.0% PVP-I). After the last dose on Day 1, the Group 2 (0.6% PVP-I) mean global staining score was higher than Group 3 (1.0% PVP-I). However, the staining in Group 2 (0.6% PVP-I) decreased by Day 4 such that the scores were lower than the staining in Group 3 (1.0% PVP-I), which changed little from the Day 1 observations. There were no associated histological findings. The results suggest that the 0.6% PVP-I and 1.0% PVP-I gel formulations (Group 2 and 3) are associated with transient irritation and mild toxicity limited to the superficial ocular tissues with a slight dose response suggested after Day 1. The lack of meaningful histological signs of corneal damage or inflammation support that the clinical observations are not associated with permanent changes after 7 days of dose administration.",

The development of IVIEW-1503 was to decrease the mucociliary clearance using mucoadhesive in-situ gel forming formulations to prolong the residence time of the drug in the nasal cavity. Because human nasal mucosa is covered with a layer of approximately 0.1 ml of mucus, which consists of sodium, potassium and calcium ions, a solution-gel phase transition will occur with ion-sensitive gel formulations.",

            "text": "Europe, it was found that paucisymptomatic patients, because of high viral loads in upper respiratory tract samples, might potentially transmit the disease during the very first days of infection despite having a mild presentation or symptoms of the disease (55). It therefore seems critical to reduce viral loads at the beginning of the infection, not only for the inhibition of virus evolution for the infected patient, but also for the prevention of virus transmission towards contacts of infected patients. In addition, it would be important to determine whether there is a significant symptomatic improvement in the quality of life scores with the use of povidone-iodine nasal spray or irrigation. Further development of a long-acting PVP-I gel forming nasal spray, or a PVP-I nasal irrigation formulation, to treat patients infected with COVID-19 in the early stages to lessen the severity of the infection and possibly prevent it from progressing into a severe stage would be important. Conclusion In this study, PVP-I formulations were shown to inactivate SARS-CoV-2 virus efficiently in both dose-and time-dependent manner. This suggests that PVP-I could potentially be used as a disinfectant for SARS-CoV-2 virus. More importantly, IVIEW-1503 PVP-I nasal formulation may potentially be used to inactivate SARS-CoV-2 virus in the nasal cavity thereby preventing infection of the airways. Subsequent development of IVIEW-1201 PVP-I ophthalmic formulation can also possibly be used to inactivate SARS-CoV-2 virus in the eyes and further prevent viral infection. Further human clinical studies to evaluate these sustained release PVP-I gel forming formulations against COVID-19 to assess both safety and efficacy are warranted.",
