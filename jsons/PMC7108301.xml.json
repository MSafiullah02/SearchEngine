            "text": "It seems unlikely that technical approaches for the same purpose, that is, the discovery of viruses, should differ between fields. However, the huge new interest in virus discovery has made researchers use opportunities within reach. In mammalian and avian viruses, the incentive coming from the medical field has triggered huge investments in technology. Paramount virus discoveries in human medicine, starting from hepatitis B virus in the 1960s through human immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis C virus, and human herpes virus 8 in the early 1990s, have reassured us in our belief that undiscovered viruses would be agents difficult to culture or entirely unculturable. On the contrary, cell culture has been a key technology in the arthropod virus field and it has been long known that unclassified, unknown viruses are routinely cultured from insects and victims of arbovirus infections alike. As a matter of fact, the historical classification of arbovirues in groups a (alphaviruses), b (mainly flaviviruses) and c (other viruses) includes the presumption that a large part of isolates will not be classifiable using traditional methods such as serology. Out of this background, arbovirus researchers have covered continents in their fieldwork and spent decades on collecting viruses.",

            "text": "Consequentially, while the investigation of original field samples has come into focus in the mammal and bird virus field, arbovirus researchers have gone back to their collected cultures, particularly those that remained untypable [14, 15]. The collection maintained at the World Reference Center for Emerging Viruses and Arboviruses (WRCEVA) at University of Texas Medical Branch is probably the largest and surely the most prominent of such collections. Other groups have followed similar technical approaches in that they used cell culture as a first-line tool to gain virus isolates, before applying methods aimed at their further characterization [16, 17, 18, 19]. There have been a number of important recent studies based on RT-PCR, but these were mainly aimed at the description of novel regions of distribution of known viruses, or close relatives thereof [20, 21, 22, 23]. On the contrary, and in spite of demonstrated technical feasibility, there is today not a single exemplary study applying undirected, hypothesis-free deep sequencing on original field samples of arthropods. All studies based on this promising methodology used cell culture isolates as their primary entry point (Figure 1\n).",

Well-known members of this so-called insect-specific group include cell fusing agent virus, Kamiti River virus, and Culex flavivirus (reviewed in [24]). These insect-specific viruses are thought to be maintained in insects only, and to represent ancestral or primordial forms of the vector-borne flaviviruses. Insect-specific flaviviruses have been divided into Aedes-associated and Culex-associated viruses, respectively. Recent findings of related flaviviruses in mosquito species of other genera [25, 26] suggest a much higher diversity of yet-to-be discovered insect-specific flaviviruses. Interestingly, a clade of potentially insect-specific viruses that replicate in mosquito cells but not in vertebrate cells or newborn mice was discovered within the diversity of mosquito-borne viruses. This clade currently has now three members including Nounan\u00e9 virus isolated from Uranotaenia mashonaensis mosquitoes originating from the Ta\u00ef National Park in C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire [27], Lammi virus isolated from Aedes cinereus mosquitoes collected in Finland [28], and Nanay virus, a virus recently isolated from Culex ocossa collected in the Amazonian rainforest near Iquitos, Peru [29]. The diversity of mosquito-associated flaviviruses was further extended by the detection of flavivirus-like sequences integrated within the genomes of Aedes mosquitoes [30].",

The case of Schmallenberg virus is only one example why we should continue studying the diversity of arthropod-associated bunyaviruses [9, 35]. More examples are provided by severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome virus (SFTSV), a novel tick-borne phlebovirus from China isolated from Haemaphysalis longicornis ticks, as well as its cousin in North America, the Heartland virus [36, 37, 38, 39]. Interestingly, also for the SFTSV and Heartland virus clade, closely related sister taxa named Bhanja virus, Palma virus and Lone Star virus, have now been described in Haemaphysalis intermadia, H. puncatata, Rhipicephalus decoloratus, R. geiyn, R. pulchellus, and Amblyomma americanum, respectively [40, 41, 42].",

Goul\u00e9ako virus did not grow in various primate, bat, bird, rodent, and amphibian cell lines but grew to high titres in mosquito cells suggesting this agent to constitute the first putative insect-specific bunyavirus. Furthermore, a novel clade in phylogenetic sister relationship to orthobunyaviruses and almost equidistant to the established bunyavirus genera has been discovered in mosquitoes originating from C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire and Uganda [44, 45\u2022]. These viruses termed Herbert virus, Tai virus and Kibale virus did also not infect vertebrate cells but replicated well in mosquito cells. Goul\u00e9ako virus, Herbert virus, Tai virus and Kibale virus may represent clades of insect-specific viruses in co-ancestral relationship to the vertebrate-infecting phlebo- and orthobunyaviruses, respectively. The diversity of the newly described bunyaviruses suggests the existence of further taxa in these clades, as well as the existence of novel clades in basal phylogenetic relationship to other bunyavirus genera (Figure 2\n).",

The monogeneric family now contains at least four virus species that seem only to be able to infect insect cells, but not vertebrate cells [49]. The order Nidovirales heretofore comprised three families of fish-, bird-, and mammal-infecting viruses, namely the Coronaviridae (subfamilies Coronavirinae and Torovirinae) and the Arteriviridae. A third family included crustacean-infecting viruses, the Roniviridae. The now expanded nidovirus phylogeny with roniviruses and mesoniviruses branching from deepest tree nodes suggests an origin in arthropods for the whole order Nidoviales [46\u2022\u2022, 49] (Figure 2).",

            "text": "Reasons for a seemingly wider genetic range of novel arthropod viruses may be technical. Virus culture as employed in most studies should amplify diverse novel viruses \u2014 in contrast to molecular biology techniques with their inherent sequence bias. However, studies combining cell culture and next generation sequencing on mammalian and bird viruses still yield a rather limited diversity of novel viruses. Moreover, while a large range of vertebrate cell lines is available, most arthropod-based virus isolation studies relied on only one cell line, namely C6/36 cells from Aedes albopictus. These cells have recently been shown to be deficient in elemental RNA interference (RNAi) components suggesting the cells to be much more susceptible for virus infections [56]. But again, also for mammal and bird viruses there are several cell lines available with defects in their interferon system facilitating virus infection and replication. It is therefore unlikely that differences in our ability to culture viruses could suffice as an explanation for the higher genetic diversity in novel virus discoveries in insects, as opposed to vertebrates. Notably, while undirected studies based on next generation sequencing are not available for arthropods, they have indeed been conducted intensely for mammals and birds. Even if some of those studies mentioned sequence reads that could neither be ascribed to the host genome or transcriptome, nor to known viral families, the absence of discoveries of highly divergent novel taxa including novel families in mammals and birds is striking. The obvious and most likely explanation is sampling bias. Our current coverage of host diversity is highly limited. In mammalian and bird virus discovery, huge efforts have been spent historically on human hosts, as well as companion and livestock animals [12]. Triggered by findings of important zoonotic agents such as SARS-CoV, Hanta-, and influenza viruses, the array of mammal and bird species of interest has been extended to wild rodents, bats, and migratory birds [1, 2]. Many of the more important recent findings of novel vertebrate viruses have been made there, confirming conjectures that taxa with huge social group sizes, population turnover, and migratory behaviour favour the emergence and maintenance of viruses.",
