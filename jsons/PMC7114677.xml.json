Phylogenetic analyses based on molecular data classified bats into the suborders Yinpterochiroptera and Yangochiroptera (Teeling et al., 2016; Teeling et al., 2005). The Yinpterochiroptera suborder includes the non echolocating Pteropodidae family and the echolocating Rhinolophoidea family. The Yangochiroptera consist of the remaining echolocating microbat families. The two suborders diverged over 50 million years ago (Lei and Dong, 2016; O'Leary et al., 2013; Simmons et al., 2008). Members of both suborders serve as reservoir or suspected reservoir hosts for a number of zoonotic viruses that are highly pathogenic in humans (Calisher et al., 2006; Moratelli and Calisher, 2015), yet cause no clinical disease in bats that are naturally or experimentally infected. The long co-evolutionary history of bats and their viruses has been speculated to have shaped the unique host-pathogen relationship (Schountz et al., 2017).",

            "text": "Although bats have been linked with a number of viruses, identifying wildlife reservoirs can be a challenging process, requiring extensive ecological sampling. Evidence that a pathogen is permanently maintained in a population, often in the absence of disease, is required to confidently identify its reservoir (Calisher et al., 2006; Haydon et al., 2002). Detection of fragments of viral genomes, combined with serological evidence for viral exposure in multiple individuals of a species are generally the first lines of evidence to associate a host with a pathogen (Halpin et al., 2011; Li et al., 2005; Swanepoel et al., 2007; Young et al., 1996). Additional evidence in the form of virus isolation and the ability to link a reservoir to a spillover event is necessary to confirm the association. Examples of bat viruses that are confirmed or speculated to have \u2018jumped\u2019 from bats into humans and agricultural animals include coronaviruses (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus [SARS-CoV], porcine epidemic diarrhea [PEDV] virus), filoviruses (ebolaviruses and Marburg virus), and henipaviruses (Nipah and Hendra viruses) [reviewed by (Moratelli and Calisher, 2015)]. Consistent with the definition of a wildlife reservoir, infection of bats by some of these viruses results in viremia and viral shedding in the absence of clinical disease (Halpin et al., 2011; Schuh et al., 2017). The spillover of some of these viruses to other susceptible hosts, including humans, can result in severe disease and mortality due to the lack of therapeutics and vaccines.",

            "text": "The emergence of zoonotic diseases is increasing globally and mammals, including bats, are major sources of emerging and re-emerging pathogens (Plowright et al., 2015). The drivers of disease emergence include anthropogenic changes to the environment (e.g., agricultural intensification), climate change and the encroachment of human populations into wildlife habitats (Tait et al., 2014). The biological characterization of a newly identified virus often begins with its isolation in cultured cells. Although detection of virus-specific antibodies by serology and the use of molecular methods, such as viral sequencing, are often readily achievable, virus isolation from bats has been far more challenging. For example, bats are implicated as the reservoirs of ebolaviruses based on the detection of viral genome, serological evidence and their confirmed role as a reservoir for the closely related Marburg virus. However, ebolaviruses have yet to be isolated from bats to definitively link them to spillover events (Leroy et al., 2005). Identifying wildlife reservoirs and the viruses they host will require the development of better laboratory tools for virus isolation to study replication kinetics and virus-host interactions. In this perspective, we discuss the importance of reservoir species specific cell lines as tools to study emerging wildlife pathogens with a focus on bats.",

Different primary cells from bats have been studied and some immortalized cell lines have also been generated (Table 1\n). Established cell lines from non-reservoir host species are convenient tools for virus isolation but do not always support propagation or isolation of viruses from wildlife. For example, a bat herpesvirus isolated from cell lines established from the Schreiber\u2019s long-fingered bat, Miniopterus schreibersii, failed to replicate in cells from a variety of other species, including cells from the black flying fox, Pteropus alecto (Zhang et al., 2012). The henipavirus Cedar virus was isolated from primary cells of its putative natural reservoir, P. alecto whereas other cell lines showed no visible cytopathic effect (Marsh et al., 2012). Similarly, the paramyxovirus Menangle virus was isolated using the same P. alecto kidney cell line (Barr et al., 2012).",

For a cell to be suitable for virus propagation, it must bear an appropriate receptor to bind with an incoming virus and it must be permissive. Because viruses differ in their cellular tropisms, working with a few cell lines with epithelial or fibroblastic characteristics limits our ability to isolate or study viruses that may have a tropism towards cell types that are more difficult to immortalize. Current cell lines may lack receptors required by viruses to replicate when cells are infected at low multiplicity of infections. For example, bat cells from various species were resistant to infection with vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) pseudotypes bearing the SARS-CoV spike protein until the cells were transfected to express the human SARS-CoV receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) (Hoffmann et al., 2013). Although the lack of appropriate receptors on cell lines makes it difficult to isolate some viruses, this lack of susceptibility to infection can also help us understand the early events in virus infection. For instance, differences in the susceptibility of cells from a variety of bats to filoviruses also led to the identification of unique amino acid substitutions in the filovirus receptor, Neimann-Pick type C1 (NPC1), providing insight into the host range of ebolaviruses (Ng et al., 2015). Similarly, Widagdo et al. have shown that dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4, CD26), a cellular receptor for MERS-CoV, is expressed in specific cell types in different tissues which also varies between bat species (Widagdo et al., 2017). These studies demonstrate the need to develop cell lines from different organs and bat species and clone them for a variety of cell types as viral receptors may not be equally distributed.",

Propagation of viruses in cell lines other than those of the natural host may lead to accumulation of adaptive mutations or attenuate the virus (Combe and Sanjuan, 2014), which in turn has implications for assessing host-pathogen interactions either in vivo or in vitro. For example, although wild type Marburg virus causes no disease in mice, it can be adapted to mice by serial passage to cause lethal disease (Qiu et al., 2014). Deep sequencing of Marburg virus after adaptation to mice and following propagation in Vero E6 cells has revealed the sequential mutations associated with each passage as the virus adapts to a new host either in vivo or in vitro (Wei et al., 2017). This is also thought to have occurred with Tacaribe virus, which was isolated from artibeus bats and passaged 20 times in newborn mice, resulting in point mutations and deletions (Malmlov et al., 2017; Sayler et al., 2014).",

Thus, viruses isolated from bats should be studied at different relevant physiological temperatures. Propagation of viruses at temperatures other than the nominal of the reservoir species may also lead to the generation of attenuation mutants; a strategy that has been used for vaccine development for decades. There is evidence that arthropod viruses found in mosquitoes and ticks accumulate mutations when grown at different temperatures (Lemm et al., 1990). Thus, propagation of viruses in susceptible cell lines [reviewed by (Hare et al., 2016)] and at optimized temperatures may minimize mutations and produce viruses similar to wild type virus found in wildlife reservoirs or arthropod vectors [reviewed by (Prescott et al., 2017)].",

A problem with propagating this virus in bat cells was achieving high virus titre to perform experimental infection studies in bats, perhaps because bat cells appear to have constitutive type I IFN activation (Zhou et al., 2016b). It may be necessary to develop interferon-deficient bat cell lines to propagate bat viruses.

However, primary cells have finite numbers of cell division before undergoing senescence, thus, it can become problematic for long-term studies. Immortalized cells frequently accumulate chromosomal aberrations over time; therefore, caution must be exercised when maintaining cell stocks. Nonetheless, they are convenient and often receptive to genetic manipulations, including transfection of plasmids and targeted changes (e.g., CRISPR), and often the only cells available that are capable of supporting replication.

Over 200 viruses have been identified in bats and additional new viruses are discovered on a regular basis (Moratelli and Calisher, 2015; Schountz, 2014). Few viruses have been documented to cause disease in bats in addition to rabies and related lyssaviruses (Davis et al., 2012; Davis et al., 2013; McColl et al., 2002). Experimental inoculation of Jamaican fruit bats with high doses of Tacaribe virus caused significant morbidity and mortality similar to natural infection of artibeus bats (Downs et al., 1963). However, the inoculated bats did not transmit the virus. Based on their observations, Cogswell-Hawkinson et al. speculate that Jamaican fruit bats may not be a reservoir host for Tacaribe virus (Cogswell-Hawkinson et al., 2012). Lloviu virus, a filovirus was isolated from dead bats in Spain (Negredo et al., 2011). These examples appear to be exceptions to the usual resistance to viral disease displayed by most bats. Bats have been hypothesized to have evolved unique aspects of their immune systems, such as a strict control of the inflammatory process (Banerjee et al., 2017) and constitutive expression of antiviral interferons (Zhou et al., 2016b) to better survive infections with these viruses. Testing this hypothesis has been possible, in part through the establishment of well characterized cell lines (Schountz et al., 2017).",

These cell lines have been used to cultivate viruses that are speculated or confirmed to have spilled over from bats. These cell lines have also allowed researchers to study the innate immune responses to viruses. Cytokines produced in response to activation of selected innate immune response pathways in bat cells have led to a better understanding of how bats might respond to viral infections in the wild. Bat cells can respond to viruses or viral antigens through the production of antiviral interferons and interferon stimulated genes (Biesold et al., 2011; Omatsu et al., 2008; Zhou et al., 2011; Zhou et al., 2013). The use of bat cell lines has also led to the discovery of viral proteins that counteract the innate immune response in these cells (Virtue et al., 2011). Less work has been performed on the adaptive immune responses of bats using cell lines, in part due to the lack of research on bat T and B cells. However, a recent report used P. alecto cell lines to examine the repertoire of self and Hendra virus epitopes presented by MHC class I molecules (Wynne et al., 2016). More research is needed to establish in vitro and ex vivo cultures of immune cells from representative bat species.",

Several cell lines have been developed from bats, including some that support the replication of viruses from different families (Table 1). However, to better characterize bat immune responses, we need to develop cell lines or a system where we can continuously establish immune cells in vitro. Current wildlife cell lines are composed primarily of epithelial or fibroblast cell types, which limit the responses generated following infection. These cells may lack many of the receptors and cytokine responses of specialized immune cells. Isolating and developing representative immune cell lines will allow the study of both adaptive and innate immune responses of bats. This also involves developing species and cell-type specific reagents that will allow characterization and culture of immune cells in vitro. Recently, immune cells from black flying foxes have been functionally and phenotypically characterized (Martinez Gomez et al., 2016), along with the establishment of bone-marrow derived dendritic cells and macrophages using black flying fox reagents developed in the laboratory (Zhou et al., 2016a). Systems such as these will further allow exploration of the adaptive immune response in potential reservoir bat species. More efforts are required to generate similar cell types in other bat species. Sharing of resources will play a key role in expanding our understanding of the unique immune response in bats.",

There are several technologies that can be used to immortalize these primary cells. Immortalized cell lines replicate indefinitely in culture and provide researchers with valuable tools to study viruses and cell-virus interactions. Some of these bat cell lines have been established using existing technology such as simian virus 40 large T-antigen and human hTERT expression systems (Ali and DeCaprio, 2001; He et al., 2009; Xie et al., 2015), whereas others have been generated by using novel technologies such as a bat polyomavirus large T-antigen to immortalize cells (Banerjee et al., 2016) and other bat specific reagents to generate dendritic cells and macrophages (Zhou et al., 2016a). Polyomavirus large T-antigen binds to and attenuates the tumor suppressor protein p53 and proteins of the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor family (pRb, p130 and p107) promoting cell cycle progression. Gamma-herpesviruses have also been used to immortalize cells of the immune system, such as B lymphocytes (Liang et al., 2011). These novel technologies or combination of cell immortalization techniques can be modified for the generation of cell lines from representative cell and tissue types from less studied species of bats and other neglected wildlife reservoirs.",

The advantages of developing cell lines do not end at studying the immune responses and isolating viruses. These cell lines can be used to propagate isolated viruses to high titre for the development of diagnostic kits and potential vaccines. Studying pathogen-host interactions may also allow us to identify biomarkers associated with viral infection that could be used to predict and prevent spillover to other susceptible hosts.

Establishing a wild-caught bat colony is challenging but achievable with sufficient resources to house and maintain the bats. Although studies using wild-caught outbred bats potentially provide the best representation of what occurs naturally during virus infection, it can be difficult to obtain reproducible data using wild caught animals due to their high genetic diversity. The current infection status and history of viral infections in wild caught bats is also difficult to determine which in turn may affect the outcome and interpretation of experimental infections. There is therefore a need to establish inbred laboratory colonies of bats of known infection status. As much of the knowledge that has been obtained regarding the host responses of bats has been gained from studies using bat cell lines, experimental infections of captive bats provide an opportunity to test whether observations made in vitro also apply in vivo. Studies in captive animals are also necessary to confirm the role of bats as \u2018reservoirs\u2019 by carrying out long-term experiments to detect virus shedding and the lack of associated pathology in bats with known infection status (i.e. laboratory bred bats). This was recently attempted with Egyptian rousette bats that were infected with Marburg virus. The bats shed virus between 5 and 19 days post infection (Schuh et al., 2017), but longer term studies might be necessary to further establish bats as reservoirs. Thus there is a need to develop more reliable animal models with known infection status.",

Bats are genetically diverse and results from studies done in one bat species may not represent other species of bats. Thus, there is a need to study other species of bats to gain deeper insights into bat-microbe co-evolution, bat immune system and ecological interactions of bats. Bats host more zoonotic viruses per mammalian species (Luis et al., 2013; Olival et al., 2017), even more than rodents, the largest group of mammals. Collaboration between laboratories will be required to develop cell lines from different bat tissues, bat specific reagents and to establish laboratory bat colonies to explore the length and breadth of microbe-host interactions in these ecologically important mammals (Fig. 1\n).",

Viruses display tropism towards different cell types and there is a need to generate cell lines representative of the multitude of cell types found in bats to increase the chances of isolating the viruses that they carry. Alternatively, genetically modified cell lines can be generated that do not express antiviral interferons from these cell types for virus isolation. These cells may be used to propagate bat-borne viruses to high titres for ex vivo, in vitro and in vivo experiments. Generating cell lines from a variety of different tissues and bats will allow researchers to explore virus susceptibility and virus-host interactions in these intriguing mammals. Generation of outbred (wild-caught) and inbred (laboratory bred) bat colonies with known infection status will enable systemic immune response studies with relevant viruses isolated from bats. The ability to resist infections with some of these viruses may be an effect of several evolutionary adaptations, which can be better dissected by studying the systemic responses in bats.",
