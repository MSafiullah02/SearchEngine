Researchers have reviewed and elucidated what years of research on small groups and teams can tell us about the processes that contribute to team effectiveness. Using that knowledge they have identified leverage points for making teams more effective such as team learning, cohesion, efficacy and group potency [8]. Furthermore, a study examining relationships among work teams with respect to team composition (ability and personality), team process (social cohesion), and team outcomes (team viability and team performance) found that interpersonally oriented personality characteristics, such as conscientiousness, agreeableness, extraversion, and emotional stability can also be important predictors of team effectiveness [1].",

Group decision support systems (GDSS) eventually evolved to consider not only the role of the ultimate decision-maker, but also the communication between everyone in the decision-making group [3, 5, 14]. Turban et al. [14] have identified the major components that make up these systems. Some of them, such as database analysis and visualization, constitute independent fields of research within computer science. Others, such as support for Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM), more appropriately fall under management science [13]. In recent years, researchers have explored Internet-based algorithms and workflows for decision-making at scale [9, 11]. Furthermore, inferring consensus among members of a group in a data-driven fashion has long been a goal in anthropology and social psychology. [12] demonstrates the use of Cultural Mixture Modeling (CMM) for inferring consensus among members of heterogeneous multidisciplinary professional teams in an example decision-making process. The findings of their study inform team decision-making based on shared beliefs and team composition.",

Our pilot implementation was designed to support a real collaborative ranking carried out by University of Maryland undergraduate students. Our goals in this work are two-fold. First, we wanted conduct a user study of Decidio to identify its effectiveness and potential areas of improvement.

The tool uses the Python-based Flask web server for its backend and the React Javascript Library for its frontend. This iteration of Decidio was designed to 1) make the ranking of options more efficient, and 2) ensure that the deliberation on team preference would fairly represent the opinions of all members on the team. The tool therefore supports the following features: Linking users and teams: Decidio supports grouping users into teams. Every user is assigned to a team.Adding a list of options: An administrator can add a list of options which will be visible to all the users.Individual ranking: Users can individually view the list of options added by the administrator and can submit their own preferred ranking order. Individual rankings are submitted for every user.Group ranking: Groups can collectively choose a final set of rankings in Decidio\u2019s group ranking page. Updates made to the ranking by any member in a group are displayed in real-time to everyone in that group.Displaying statistics about individual rankings: Decidio displays basic statistics for the group, generated from the individual ranking phase when the users are working on the group rankings. This feature helps users make decisions which encompass opinions of everyone in the group.Analysis of user behavior through logs: Decidio logs highly granular interactions in the tool. Based on the logged activity, we can classify users into different categories like operators, leaders, followers, etc. We describe these terms in Sect. 3 in more detail.\n",

Each team sat at a separate circular table in the same classroom during the discussion. Students logged into Decidio via their personal laptops and navigated to the group project ranking dashboard. The important components of the dashboard are shown in Fig. 2 and Fig. 3. This dashboard is distinguished from the individual ranking dashboard in that 1) all users in a team have equal control over modifying and submitting a unified project ranking and 2) users are presented with the results of individual rankings for all team members. Below, we describe the flow of group ranking: Collaborative Ranking. Each user is able to update the team ranking with the same interaction used for the individual ranking process. When the ranking changes, this change is published to the dashboard of each team member, and the dashboard will automatically refresh to reflect the changes.Staging. Users can choose to stage their team\u2019s ranking at any point during Collaborative Ranking by clicking a button on the web page. When a ranking is staged, further modifications to this ranking are frozen and the staged ranking is displayed for review by team members. Any user is able to unstage the ranking after it has been staged, which will return all users to Collaborative Ranking.Approval and Submission. When a ranking has been staged, users can click to indicate whether they approve of the ranking for submission. The tool indicates to all users the number of team members who have approved the ranking, warning users when approval is not unanimous. However, the tool does not prevent submission based on the approval status. A user can submit at any time by clicking a button on the dashboard.\n",

Collectively, this showed us the need and the importance of \u201croles\u201d in group decision making.Individual and group project rankings changed with understanding of the projects: In general, project presentations in class prior to group ranking helped students gain knowledge on projects. Group discussion that followed allowed them to communicate their understanding and validate assumptions with their group. This showed us that the presentations and discussions held in class influenced the group\u2019s final project rankings. This validated that a mental model which is an internal representation of knowledge changes with individual\u2019s understanding of the present state of a system and that the development of a \u201cshared\u201d understanding of the problem within groups is key in group decision making [4].Groups used various techniques for deciding on the final project rankings: As a standard discussion protocol was not established for QUEST, groups used a variety of techniques to arrive at the final project ranking. These include making a pros and cons list (8), voting on projects (6), brainstorming ideas, taking-turns or going around the table to discuss implications and levels of interest for each project (10).

It showed only actions related to the submission of individual project rankings.Fig. 4a demonstrates this workflow.Regular Workflow: The regular workflow is the one where users submit individual rankings, approve and/or submit group project rankings. Their flow is mostly linear and does not involve updating the project rankings, staging the project rankings and unstaging the temporary final rankings. Figure 4b demonstrates this user\u2019s workflow.Active Operator Workflow: Workflows containing repeated updates to project rankings indicate that the user is an \u201cactive operator\u201d for the group. Each group typically had one or two members actively updating the project order in Decidio. By mapping active operators to their roles from the survey, we found that 11 out of 17 active operators considered themselves to be the facilitators of their groups. Figure 4c demonstrates an active operator workflow.Irregular Workflow: Irregular workflows contain cycles. i.e, the users have performed staging and unstaging operations. This workflow seems to indicate that the group didn\u2019t have the approval of all its group members (no consensus) and had to revise their project rankings by going back and forth between staging and unstaging before proceeding to submit. However, we note that one group exhibiting this workflow claimed via our survey that they had a consistent consensus throughout the ranking process. For this reason, we suspect that there are other explanations for the irregular workflow, such as user errors while navigating the software. Figure 4d demonstrates this type of workflow.\n",

It\u2019s an extrapolation, albeit a reasonable one, to connect the \u201cOperator\u201d workflow described in Sect. 4.2 to the subjective notion of team leadership, for example. We recognize that the \u201cOperator\u201d may have been acting as a sort of team note-taker or secretary for the session rather than the leader of the discussion. Second, we did not test with a control group. This nuances the results from the user survey, as we\u2019re not able to draw a comparison to a team who collaborates on a ranking with a default method (e.g., pen and paper). Finally, it is difficult to generalize results about user behavior in the tool when each team consists of a different mix of personalities and individual ranking preferences. For example, a team with insignificant differences between individual preferences for projects may not have much to disagree about, even if their personalities would suggest a higher likelihood of conflict.",
