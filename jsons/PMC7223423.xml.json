Informed by the preliminary literature review, the following databases were determined to be relevant to this meta-analysis: PsycINFO, Academic Search Complete, MEDLINE, Psychological and Behavioral Sciences Collection, CINAHL Plus, and Humanities International Complete. The preliminary literature review indicated that the following search terms would provide a sufficiently wide nomological network of variables: mindfulness, mindfulness-based cognitive therapy, mindfulness-based stress reduction, acceptance and commitment therapy, dialectic behavior therapy, stress management, yoga, meditation, mindfulness-based compassion training, compassion, and self-compassion. All the possible combinations of the intervention and self-compassion variables were used in the literature search with no search constraints.",

As explained previously, mindfulness-based interventions have common core components that theoretically translate across intervention types. Health care professional terms were not used in the article search because of the many different terms used to describe this population. By not including these terms, all studies in this area were screened for health care professional participants. We also included students in training who are seeing patients. The purpose of this decision was to include all health care professionals who are providing patient care. Even though the skill levels and experiences vary, burnout and compassion fatigue, which may affect patient care, has been documented across all included participant groups. Overall, the rationale for the wide scope of intervention type and health care professional participants allowed us to gather the most information we could about the possible relationships among interventions and outcomes.",

All disagreements were discussed and coding rules were updated as necessary. The search results produced 683 articles, all of which were screened for inclusion by two independent raters. Cohen\u2019s kappa was calculated to determine interrater reliability. The interrater reliability for title selection was k = .80, p < .0001 and 206 articles were retained for further review. The interrater reliability for abstract selection was k = .85, p < .01 and 74 articles retained for full-text review. At this stage, seven additional articles were identified in a review of references. Both raters reviewed 20 of these 81 articles in order to establish an agreement rate of 95%. The remaining studies were reviewed independently by each coder for full-text review. See Fig. 1 for a flowchart of article selection. Two raters independently coded nineteen data points (i.e., means, standard deviations, effect sizes) from five articles and demonstrated a strong reliability (k = 1.00). The remaining data points were coded by one researcher.",

Morris and DeShon (2002) established that the denominator of Becker\u2019s d should be adjusted by the pre-treatment to post-treatment correlation in order to render a more accurate estimate of the population parameter. Smith and Beretvas (2009) demonstrated that using a pre-treatment-post-treatment correlation\u2013adjusted pooled standard deviation in the denominator was superior to Becker\u2019s formula which used only the pre-treatment standard deviation (Smith and Beretvas 2009).",

The sampling variance of drm was then calculated as Variance drm = (1/n)(n-1/n-3) [1 + (nd2rm] \u2212 d2rm/[c(n-1)]2, where c(n-1) = 1 \u2212 (3/(4(n-1) \u2212 1).

Among the studies included in this meta-analysis, none reported the pre-treatment to post-treatment correlation. We were able to impute the pre-treatment to post-treatment correlation using alternative data. Our review of all included articles indicated that 9 provided pre-post-t test results that could be used to calculate the pre-treatment to post-treatment correlation using Morris and DeShon\u2019s (2002) two formulas: SDdifference = n(Mpost \u2212 Mpre)2/t2pre-post and r = SD2pre + SD2post \u2212 SDdifference/2(SDpre \u00d7 SDpost).

Jamovi version 1.0.5 was used to conduct moderator analyses and to generate forest plots and funnel plots (The Jamovi Project 2019). In all, the following cumulative effect sizes were calculated: pre-post-treatment for treatment groups, pre-post for control groups, pre-treatment to follow-up for treatment groups, pre-post-comparison between treatment and control groups, and treatment versus control group comparisons at post-treatment (note: treatment versus control group comparisons at follow-up were not conducted because there were too few effect sizes). Confidence intervals were generated for all cumulative effect sizes. Heterogeneity of the cumulative effect sizes were evaluated using Qtotal (Huedo-Medina et al. 2006). Since Qtotal can be underpowered with small samples, I2 was also calculated (Higgins and Thompson 2002). The formula for I2 was [Qtotal \u2212 (k-1)/Qtotal] \u00d7 100. In cases where the Qtotal < k-1, I2 was truncated to zero, as recommended by Higgins and Thompson (2002).",

Disagreements between raters were resolved by discussion. Additional sub-analyses were conducted to examine possible effects of risk of bias and study quality.",

However, for exploratory purposes, several possible moderators were conducted for pre-post-treatment overall effect size for the treatment groups. These moderators included participant characteristics (e.g., students vs. professionals; medical field vs. psychological field), intervention characteristics (e.g., manualized interventions vs. modified interventions; 12 or less total interventions hours vs. more 12 total intervention hours), and risk of bias. One moderator was identified as significant, indicating that studies with a retreat had a significantly larger effect size than those without a retreat. No other moderator analyses indicated that other methodological variations were associated with different levels of intervention effects (see Table 6). A moderator analysis was also conducted to investigate the effects of randomization for the post-treatment versus post-control comparison and was nonsignificant.",

            "text": "First, many studies did not meet inclusion criteria for the current meta-analysis due to insufficient data presented. Future studies should report, at the least, means, standard deviations, sample sizes, and pre-post correlations among dependent variables. Second, as more studies are published on this topic, possible outcome moderators may be identified, as the moderator analyses were likely underpowered (Hedges and Pigott 2001). Third, there may be other unmeasured moderators that can help distinguish aspects of interventions that may be associated with effectiveness and thereby better inform clinical practice (e.g., intervention type, duration, content, home practice). Specifically, it would be important for future researchers to explore differences in outcomes after inventions with explicit versus implicit focus on teaching self-compassion. A fourth limitation was the analysis of only self-report measures. It would be important to have a better understanding of whether change in self-compassion corresponds with change in objective indices of self-care and patient care behaviors. A fifth limitation was the broad scope of our inclusion criteria for types of health care professionals and types of interventions. While our purpose was to evaluate the extent to which mindfulness interventions influenced self-compassion in professional caregivers who are at risk of compassion fatigue and burnout, regardless of their job title and years of work, we may have missed important nuances between interventions and specific types of health care providers. Sixth, results from the study quality ratings indicated that many studies did not use a randomized control trial design and did not sufficiently report their methodological procedures. It is recommended that primary researchers refer to standardized reporting guidelines, such as Jadad et al. (1996), to increase methodological quality. Finally, there is a lack of active control group comparisons which limits the external validity of our findings. Moreover, it makes it difficult to determine whether mindfulness-based techniques per se are promoting improvements in self-compassion over and above nonspecific intervention and group variables such as social support, empathy, and problem-solving. The proposed recommendations parallel previous researchers\u2019 conclusions, more studies are warranted to better understand the effects of specific intervention components and \u201cdosage,\u201d as well as the need for more rigorous study designs (Burton et al. 2017; Dharmawardene et al. 2016).",

Previous research has shown that health care professionals experience high rates of stress, burnout, and compassion fatigue, which have been correlated with poorer patient satisfaction and more medical errors. Future studies with rigorous methodological designs evaluating the impact of increased self-compassion via mindfulness-based interventions on objective indictors of self-care, quality of patient care, and job performance would be beneficial. Studies evaluating the differences between key variables, such as interventions with implicit versus explicit compassion skills and levels of training (students vs. employees), are warranted. Additionally, self-compassion as a protective factor for burnout and compassion fatigue in this population should be investigated.",
