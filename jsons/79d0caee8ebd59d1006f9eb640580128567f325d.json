            "text": "The patterns of propagation of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak of 2003 were not explained by conventional epidemic models that assumed homogeneity of infectiousness. Instead, the existing datasets were best matched by models that used negative binomial distributions in which a small proportion of cases were highly infectious (Lloyd-Smith et al., 2005 , McDonald et al., 2004 , Shen et al., 2003 . Data and modelling supported the existence of 'superspreaders' which played a crucial role in propagating the disease by being very efficient at transmitting SARS-CoV-1, such that in the absence of superspreading events most cases infected few, if any, secondary contacts (Stein, 2011) . Almost a decade later emerged the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), with analogous infection dynamics involving superspreading events (Hui, 2016) . Similarly, early modelling and data suggested that a small proportion of cases of COVID-19 were responsible for most transmission, which is evidence that superspreaders also play an important role for SARS-CoV-2 (MacKenzie D, 2020, Frieden and Lee, 2020). Explanations of this superspreader status included high viral shedding due to poor immunocompetence, underlying diseases or co-infection, or elevated contact rate due active social behaviour (Lloyd-Smith et al., 2005 , McDonald et al., 2004 , Shen et al., 2003 , Wong et al. 2015 .",

By the end of February, over 50 countries outside China had confirmed the infection, but only three of these, South Korea, Italy and Iran, presented notable spread. In South Korea, during the first month of viral propagation there were only two to three reports of new infections per day.

A few weeks later, several other countries underwent a similar exponential growth in the number of cases, despite many of them taking drastic measures to control the epidemic. A notable case was the USA, Page 5 of 10 J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 4 where the infection was propagating slowly since January 20th until early March, when the daily growth in the number of cases went suddenly from being of one digit to surpassing 30%, remaining above that geometrical growth rate for almost 20 days. This explosive spread began in New York City, where the number of cases reached 20000 in just over two weeks. In contrast, in most countries the infection has been propagating at a slow to moderate pace (e.g. Thailand, Singapore, Egypt, Finland, Japan, Australia, among many others). In general, there have been also contrasts in the apparent case-fatality rate (deaths/reported) depending on the speed of propagation, being much lower in countries with slow spread (e.g. 0.1 % in Singapore, 1.4% in Australia, 1.8% in Thailand) compared with those where the transmission was notably high (e.g. 14% in Italy, 12% in Spain, 7% in USA). This difference might be too large to be explained solely by detection bias.",

Independent superspreading events due to individual variation cannot explain this large-scale heterogeneous pattern of transmission. The occurrence of superspreaders may not be at random and may depend on other superspreaders. It is proposed that infections caused by contact with superspreaders are more likely to result in new superspreaders than those caused by transmission from a less infectious individual. The mechanism by which this would be possible is by exposure to differential viral load. The primary mode of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 appears to be through exposure to respiratory droplets and direct contact with infected individuals and their contaminated environment (Xiao et al., 2017; van Doremalen et al., 2020) . Droplets may contain a few or a million viral particles, and this differential load determines how much the environment is contaminated and the infective dose a susceptible person is exposed to. A case with a high intensity of infection has the potential of being a superspreader due to high viral shedding. Susceptible people exposed to this hypothetical superspreader would be exposed to a high viral dose. Infections resulting from exposure to high loads of virus are expected to be of high intensity, as a large quantity of viral particles initiating replication in synchrony might overwhelm the mechanisms of resistance, and the poor control of viral replication may therefore result in a new potential superspreader. This hypothesis has support from veterinary research.",

This would be due to extensive cell damage caused by large amounts of virus and also due to the resulting immune response.

Therefore, a case resulting from an exposure to high viral loads has the potential to develop severe disease and also of being highly infectious.

Given equal resistance (ability to limit the infection), exposure to high viral loads will result in severe disease in the less tolerant and high infection intensity with few manifestations in the more tolerant. The latter case is of special concern, because in these individuals the clinical signs would be mild or absent, and therefore are likely to be undetected, exposing many people to high viral loads. On the other hand, severe cases may be important sources of disease in hospitals . For example, in J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 6 Argentina, 17% of the cases reported to date are healthcare workers (Infobae, 2020) .
