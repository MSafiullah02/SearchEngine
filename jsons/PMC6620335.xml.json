It is hard for clinicians to differentiate viral gastroenteritis from gastroenteritis caused by bacterial agents on the basis of clinical manifestations alone7. Although viral gastroenteritis manifests abruptly with vomiting and watery diarrhea, often accompanied by low-grade fever and abdominal cramps, these clinical manifestations are always shared by bacterial gastroenteritis6\u20138. Thus, further evaluation of differences in sex, infection source, transmission route, symptoms as well as clinical laboratory tests between viral and bacterial gastroenteritis has clinical significance. In addition, Shanghai is an international metropolis that had 24.2 million residents and 320 million tourists in the year of 2017, and high population density is a major factor promoting acute gastroenteritis epidemics2,3,9\u201312. So far, long-term acute gastroenteritis surveillance data with a large sample size from Shanghai are still scarce. Furthermore, the pathogenic spectrum of acute infectious gastroenteritis prevalent in the local area remains unclear.",

Bacterial identification is the systematic work of a multisectoral collaboration in China\u2019s Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and it is difficult to detail all processes in this report. Briefly, detection was carried out via classic bacterial isolation, culture, and identification in combination with molecular diagnostic strategies2. In addition, bacterial samples were subjected to VITEK\u00ae 2 Compact (bioM\u00e9rieux, France) for simultaneous microbial identification. The above technologies covered the most common diarrhea-related bacteria, including Vibrio cholerae, Salmonella, Shigella, Vibrio parahemolyticus, Yersinia enterocolitica, Campylobacter jejuni, Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC), Enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC) and others2. To learn the pathotypes of diarrheagenic E. coli, suspected E. coli colonies on SMAC or MacConkey plates were further analyzed by PCR using primers targeting the genes eae, bfp, stx1, stx2, ipaH, pCDV, eltA and estA. A first PCR detection was performed with stx1/stx2 and eae primers focusing on the identification of STEC or EPEC. Positive eae and negative stx1/stx2 samples were then examined by PCR with bfp primers to differentiate tEPEC from aEPEC. Negative eae and stx1/stx2 samples were further screened by PCR using pCVD432 primers for plasmidic EAEC sequences, ipaH primers for detecting invasion plasmid antigen genes of EIEC, and detection of the eltA and estA genes of ETEC labile and stable enterotoxins18,19. The diagnosis of epidemic dysentery and cholera was performed according to the Laboratory Methods for the Diagnosis of Epidemic Dysentery and Cholera recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the World Health Organization5.",

The noninflammatory gastroenteritis is mostly caused by viral infection with milder disease; while, inflammatory gastroenteritis is more severe and always resulted from infection of invasive or with toxin-producing bacteria1,24\u201326. In addition, fever and abdominal pain are two common symptoms in acute gastroenteritis caused by Salmonella infection24; our data showed that 22.2% identified bacterial cases were Salmonella infection (Fig. 2). Thus, higher prevalence of fever and abdominal pain in acute bacterial gastroenteritis were observed. Ingesting unsafe food at restaurants was a common transmission route for both sexes and was more frequently associated with bacterial gastroenteritis; which is consistent with that bacterial infections are more often associated with foodborne transmission24\u201326 and acquired easily at places with high population mobility27,28. White blood cell count was higher in bacterial cases only in females with low OR of 1.02, suggesting the relative pathology of infectious acute gastroenteritis differed between sexes.

In bacterial gastroenteritis, age and vomiting were associated with males with ORs of 0.99 and 0.61, respectively; for ease of understanding, these associations were translated to females, and age and vomiting were associated with females with ORs of 1.01 and 1.64, respectively, meaning that with a 1-year old increase, the female/male ratio will increase 1.01 times, and vomiting is more frequently associated with female patients. The age quartiles of female and male bacterial cases are 27.6, 36.9 and 57.2; and 28.1, 34.9 and 49.9 years old respectively; the 2nd and particularly the 3rd quartiles of female age were older; which is why female/male ratio will increase 1.01 times with a 1-year old increase. Red cell-positive fecal matter remained an independent factor that was more frequently observed in males with OR of 1.71 (Table 4); in addition, the above sex stratification analysis showed that red cell-positive fecal matter was an independent factor that was more frequently observed in bacterial cases only in males with OR of 3.28 (Table 3). These two analysis methods mutually confirmed that red cell-positive fecal matter is common in males with bacterial infections. Bacteria, such as Vibrio parahemolyticus and Salmonella, predisposing to cause inflammatory infections with bloody stool24\u201326, which could be used to explain why bloody stool is more frequently observed in bacterial infections, but could not interpret gender difference. Since the proportions of Vibrio parahemolyticus and Salmonella infections were similar between males (49.9% and 52.5%) and females (50.1% and 47.5%), higher bloody stool rate in male cases should not be caused by differences in rates of bacterial infection. Although we could not give a reasonable explanation to partial gender differences; these evidences have clinical significance and will guide translational study to interpret a pathological mechanism. In fact, gender differences exist widely in clinical medicine and have been paid more and more attention in recent years30. In viral cases, only domiciliary register remained an independent factor associated with males; the migrant/local resident ratio was 2.29 times higher in males than in females, suggesting the prevalence of viral gastroenteritis is relatively higher in migrant workers.",

Our data showed that Caliciviridae (norovirus GII and GI) and Reoviridae (rotavirus A) constituted more than 80% of viral infections. Since a norovirus vaccine is still under development36, rotavirus vaccination needs to be implemented in local areas.

Second, based on our sampling rates, pathogens were only identified in 9.2% (1031/11243) of patients, and more effort should be made to improve the representative accuracy of our results. Third, in the stratified and logistic regression analyses, we only considered mixed viral cases and mixed bacterial cases and did not subgroup the subjects by bacterial classification, virus classification or by multiple infections due to the restrictions of sample size. Since all of the above factors might influence the symptoms and clinical examinations of acute gastroenteritis, our analyses may be influenced by related bias.",
