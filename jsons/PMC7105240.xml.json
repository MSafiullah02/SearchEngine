            "text": "Infection of cats with feline coronavirus (FCoV) can have two different outcomes. Cats infected with avirulent FCoV-strains usually develop mild enteritis, while virulent FCoV-strains can cause progressive and usually fatal vasculitis known as feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) [1]. FIP is one of the most common infectious causes of death in young cats because neither effective treatment nor vaccine is available. It is an enigmatic disease and its pathogenesis is not fully understood. Recent work of our research group gave new insights into the interaction of infected monocytes (the in vivo target cell of the virus) with the immune system. We demonstrated that the virus has developed multiple mechanisms to evade the host's humoral immune system. Once the virus is replicating in a monocyte, it will ensure that it is protected from the omnipresent antibodies by inhibition of viral protein expression in the plasma membrane. This is achieved by intracellular retention of viral proteins or antibody-induced internalization of proteins that reached the plasma membrane [2], [3]. Both mechanisms offer protection from recognition by antibodies and thus from antibody-dependent complement-mediated lysis (ADCML) and cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) [4], [5]. ADCML can occur either through the formation of membrane attack complexes or through effector cells which carry a complement receptor (neutrophils, monocytes or macrophages). ADCC is executed by neutrophils, monocytes, macrophages or natural killer cells.",

            "text": "These immune-evasion mechanisms could explain why FIPV infected cells are not eliminated despite high antibody titres found in most infected cats. The internalization pathway was fully characterized and was found to be dependent on (among others) myosin light chain kinase (MLCK) [6]. ML-7, in full 1-(5-iodonaphthalene-1-sulfonyl)-1H-hexahydro-1,4-diazepine hydrochloride, a potent and selective MLCK inhibitor was found to be a good candidate for in vivo blocking of the immune-evasive internalization and might thus form the basis of a new and innovative anti-immune evasion therapy. With ML-7, the immune-evasion mechanisms of FIPV can be blocked and by doing so, the cat will be enabled to overcome the infection. The anti-immune evasion therapy is a completely new approach for the control of chronic viral diseases. It offers the following potential advantages, compared to other existing antiviral therapies: (1) continuous administration of the chemical is not required; (2) there are no associated problems related to resistance; (3) it can lead to elimination of the virus; (4) it can be applied for different viruses using this immuno-evasion process. ML-7 is a chemical that has been developed in 1987 at the Mie University in Japan to study the function of MLCK. It is the most active of a family of naphthalene derivatives, as a selective MLCK inhibitor [7]. Its structure is shown in Fig. 1\n, as well as that of ML-9, a related MLCK inhibitor. Up till now, no patents were filed on the compound, which is currently commercially available at most large chemical companies such as Sigma\u2013Aldrich, Calbiochem, Alexxis and VWR.",

            "text": "To design an effective dosage regimen of the compound ML-7 in the treatment of FIP viral infections in cats, determination of major pharmacokinetic parameters, such as C\nmax (peak plasma concentration), T\nmax (time to reach peak concentration), t\n1/2 (half-life of elimination) and AUC (area under the plasma concentration versus time curve) must be achieved. These parameters can be evaluated on plasma concentration versus time profiles of the drug after administration to a sufficient number of animals. For this purpose, a reliable and sensitive analysis method of the drug in plasma must be available. The development, and subsequent validation, of such a method for the determination of ML-7 in feline plasma is presented and discussed in this paper. To our knowledge, the determination of ML-7 \u2013 or a related component \u2013 in animal plasma, has not been published yet. Also the determination of ML-7 in other body fluids and/or tissues of human or animal origin has not been described yet, demonstrating the novelty of our approach. For the clean-up of the plasma samples, two major strategies were followed and evaluated. The first one is based on a liquid\u2013liquid extraction with ethyl acetate, while the second one involves a solid-phase extraction (SPE) step on an Oasis\u00ae MCX (mixed-mode cation exchange sorbent) cartridge. Extracts were then injected onto an UPLC (ultra performance liquid chromatography) instrument and components were measured by ESI-MS/MS (electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry). Since the extraction with ethyl acetate was shown to be very prone to a variable matrix effect, the method with clean-up on an MCX cartridge was retained for further validation experiments. It showed thereby good performance characteristics. It was sensitive enough with a limit of quantification (LOQ) of 1 ng ml\u22121 and a limit of detection (LOD) of 0.4 ng ml\u22121 that could be established. Finally, it was shown to be of practical use for the monitoring of plasma concentration time profiles of ML-7 after administration (intravenous, subcutaneous, oral) of a drug formulation to cats, used for pharmacokinetic analysis. The method also showed potential for the quantitative analysis of ML-7 in plasma of other animal species, and in human plasma.",

The best signal was obtained in the positive ion mode, probably because the components incorporate e.g. 2 N-atoms that can be easily protonated. In MS, a major ion at m/z 417.07 and 325.29 was observed for ML-7 and ML-9 respectively, corresponding to the protonated molecules [M+H]+ of both components (molecular mass of respectively 416.28 and 324.83 as base). For ML-9, clearly also an ion lower in intensity at m/z 327.30 was observed due to the 37Cl-isotope. The CID product ion spectra of both components show a predominant ion at m/z 98.97, which was therefore used in the MRM transition for quantification. According to the Mass Frontier 6.0 software (HighChem, Ltd., Bratislava, Slovakia) this corresponds to the 1,4-diazepine moiety of the components, after protonation and charge site rearrangement (rHc (\u03b3)). This software has a module \u201cFragments and Mechanisms\u201d which is an expert system providing information about basic fragmentation and rearrangement processes based on literature, starting from a user-supplied chemical structure. A major product ion with higher m/z was also observed, at m/z 253.10 and 160.93 for ML-7 and ML-9 respectively, according to Mass Frontier corresponding to the iodonaphthalene and chloronaphthalene moieties of the components, after protonation and inductive cleavage (i). Also several common fragments at lower m/z were present in the product ion spectra: m/z 43.94, 55.88, 57.03, 58.10, 68.01, 68.96, 69.98, 82.03 and 85.02.

The \u201cwithin-day\u201d precision (RSD) of the analysis method, evaluated on the same 3 levels, was even excellent, taking into account the RSDmax values given by the Horwitz equation (see Table 3). The same behaviour was also observed for samples spiked at 10 ng ml\u22121 (n\n = 3), but using blanks of different origin and with a different behaviour during extraction (blanks 2 and 3, see Section 2.5), indicating the robustness of the method (see Table 3).

Therefore, extraction recovery and matrix effect were evaluated on canine, rabbit, chicken, porcine, bovine, and human plasma. The results are summarized in Table 4\n. As can be seen, the method gives extraction recoveries ranging from 67.6 to 81.3% and from 70.3% to 82.2% for ML-7 and ML-9 respectively, for canine, rabbit, chicken, porcine and human plasma, the lowest values corresponding to canine plasma, while the highest recoveries were obtained for human plasma. These recoveries are comparable to the ones found for feline plasma (see Table 3). Only for bovine plasma, extraction recovery was significantly lower, close to 40%. This is due to the fact that the pellet after the ultracentrifugation step of the plasma sample after the addition of 100 \u03bcl 1 N HCl solution was very substantial and with a gelatinous aspect, resulting in a more important loss of analyte during this step, compared to the plasma of other species. However, this lower extraction recovery remains reproducible (RSD = 3.5%, n\n = 3). A minor modification of the pre-SPE step might be considered for bovine plasma to increase this lower extraction recovery. The matrix effect is very acceptable for the plasma of all different animal species tested, as well as for human plasma, with the least-positive results being a 15.3% increase of the ML-7 signal in the case of chicken plasma, and a 9.9% decrease of the ML-9 signal in the case of rabbit plasma. The overall ratio of the ML-7 to the ML-9 signal, which is actually used for quantification, of all samples involved in the experiment summarized in Table 4, is 66.1 \u00b1 3.4, giving an RSD = 5.1%, indicating that the quantification of ML-7 is relatively independent of the origin of the plasma, indicating that the method is more generally applicable, and is not designed to be limited for feline plasma only. This can be of interest, since at least also for dogs, systemic corona virus infection has been reported [20].",

However, the method remains rather simple and not very time consuming, allowing the analysis of a sufficient number of samples in a reasonable time period. Validation of the method showed its good performance characteristics, possibly also for plasma of other animal species and human plasma.
