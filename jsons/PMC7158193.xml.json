CMV is best known as an opportunistic pathogen in patients with a suppressed immune system, including those with AIDS, and after solid organ or bone marrow transplantation.2 Primary infections in healthy persons are generally self-limited. Symptoms vary with the immune status of the patient and the site of infection. The most common clinical symptoms are diarrhea (either bloody or watery), abdominal pain, fever, and weight loss.2 A rare, but important, entity associated with pediatric CMV infection is hypertrophic gastropathy and protein-losing enteropathy resembling M\u00e9n\u00e9trier's disease.",

The distribution is often patchy, and the rectum may be spared.42 Atypical findings include mucosal erythema and friability without pseudomembranes. Typical histologic findings may be seen, however, in the absence of gross pseudomembranes. Histologically, the classic features of pseudomembranous colitis-\u201cvolcano\u201d lesions with intercrypt necrosis and ballooned crypts-give rise to the laminated pseudomembrane composed of fibrin, mucin, and neutrophils (Fig. 4-8A-C\n). The ballooned glands are filled with neutrophils and mucin, and they often lose the superficial epithelial cells.43 The degenerated goblet cells often spill into the lumen of degenerated and necrotic crypts, and they mimic signet ring cell carcinoma. In fact, this feature is helpful to distinguish the condition from ischemic colitis, as the latter does not normally show this feature. More severe and prolonged pseudomembranous colitis may lead to full-thickness mucosal necrosis. Less characteristic lesions, usually focal active colitis with occasional crypt abscesses but lacking pseudomembranous features, have been well described in association with a positive C. difficile toxin assay.43\n",
