In 2009, essentially all of the seasonal H1N1 strains carried the histidine 275 to tyrosine (H275Y) oseltamivir-resistance mutation. These strains were sensitive to both the adamantanes and zanamivir. In contrast, essentially all seasonal H3N2 strains carried the S31N adamantane-resistance mutation and were sensitive to the NA inhibitors. Interestingly, the 2009 A (H1N1) pandemic strain resembled the H3N2 subtype in terms of its resistance profile, and was generally sensitive to the NA inhibitors and resistant to the adamantanes (Table 36.1).\n",

The use of single-tube RT-PCR containing both forward and reverse primers allows amplification of genomic RNA (negative-stranded) as well as viral complementary and messenger RNA (both positive-stranded). In contrast, the use of a separate RT reaction with a single primer would allow subsequent amplification of only the negative- or positive-stranded RNA species. For example, an RT reaction with only the forward matrix primer would generate complementary DNA (cDNA) only from the genomic, negative-stranded matrix RNA.\nThe correct answer is E.\nThe signs and symptoms of respiratory viral illnesses are not specific enough to make a definitive diagnosis. Respiratory virus panels often cover influenza A and B, respiratory syncytial virus, metapneumovirus, adenovirus, and parainfluenza 1, 2, and 3. Some tests also detect rhinoviruses and coronaviruses. These panels are particularly important for hospitalized patients where results not only guide patient care but also isolation and infection control.\nThe correct answer is A.\nViral pneumonia is a serious complication of influenza A viral infections but may be difficult to distinguish from a secondary bacterial pneumonia. Appropriate diagnosis requires testing a lower respiratory tract specimen, such as bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid, for viral and bacterial pathogens. Interestingly, 2009 A (H1N1) can present with predominantly lower-tract disease, so testing BAL or endotracheal (ET) aspirate specimens should be considered in patients with severe respiratory illness even in the absence of viral detection in nasopharyngeal swabs [14].\n",
