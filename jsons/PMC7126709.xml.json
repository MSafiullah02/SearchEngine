            "text": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) has been linked to increased mortality in several studies [1]. Autopsy studies in dementia have shown infection and cardiovascular events as the most common causes of death, with cancer being a less common cause [2], [3]. Some data suggests that cancer is less common in patients diagnosed with or suspected of suffering from AD [4]. Suicide as cause of death in AD is less investigated, as well as passive forms of self-harm, although small studies [5], [6] have shown both to be more frequent in patients with AD.",

Nevertheless, other studies have shown benefits from short-term antipsychotic treatment in reducing Behavioural and Psychological Symptoms in Dementia (BPSD), although studies with long follow-up have been sparse [9]. We have previously shown that lifetime cumulative antipsychotic drug dosages and all-cause mortality are associated [10], suggesting that the negative effects on mortality by antipsychotics could not be outweighed by the effects of antipsychotics on BPSD. So far, no studies have investigated the effects of cumulative antipsychotic treatment in patients diagnosed with AD for specific causes of death. As cardiovascular events and infection are the two most common causes of death in this population, we chose to include these as outcome measures. The choice to include cancer was undertaken, as antipsychotics have been proposed to increase the risk of cancer development, and as cancer is a common cause of death in elderly patients. Lastly, we chose to include intentional self-harm, as this outcome is very rare, and would most likely only be investigated utilizing larger datasets, as ours.",

No patients currently exposed would be in the baseline cumulative dosage group with zero DDDs, causing current exposure and cumulative drug dosage groups to be associated. When conducting the analyses without current exposure as an explanatory variable, we showed higher cumulative drug dosages being associated with an increased mortality rate for infection and cardiovascular related deaths. We believe the divergent findings are a result of a collider bias, which could have led to false conclusions, had the secondary analyses without current exposure as explanatory variable not been conducted. The findings of increased mortality rate associated with cumulative dosages of antipsychotic drugs for cardiovascular and infection related deaths are in line with results from other studies [2], [3]. In our study, cancer related deaths are not associated with higher cumulative dosages of antipsychotic drug treatment. This finding is reassuring, although previous studies have proposed antipsychotics as carcinogenic [14], [15]. As opposed to the other disorders investigated, our study population is selected given that they are generally older and have not yet died from a cancer related illness. Studies have suggested cancer to be less common in patients diagnosed with AD [4], perhaps resulting in the lack of association between cumulative antipsychotic dosages and mortality related to cancer. Secondly, the possible effects of antipsychotics on the risk of developing cancer would most likely not be dramatic, and time from exposure to a possible cancer related death could be long, resulting in some patients dying from other causes. This would be opposed to the effects of antipsychotic drugs on cardiovascular related deaths, where time from exposure to effects is shorter, as shown in studies on patients with dementia, as well as other psychiatric disorders [8], [16]. The specific background for the increased occurrence of cardiovascular events are unknown, but antipsychotic drugs are known to increase the risk of hypotension, increase blood lipids, as well as increase the risk of lowered insulin sensitivity or even diabetes, all being associated with an increase in cardiovascular events longer term [17], [18].",

This finding is likely caused by a survival bias, in which survivors of treatment are being exposed for a longer period, and thereby are able to receive higher dosages of medication. An alternative interpretation could be that clinicians are able to determine which patients benefit from antipsychotic treatment and continue treatment in patients where the risk-benefit ratio is positive. Several short-term randomized controlled trials have been conducted on the effects of antipsychotics on aggression and psychosis in patients diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease, predominantly showing decreased levels of symptoms after treatment [19]. An explanation for our results could be that in patients with severe BPSD, where antipsychotic drugs are efficacious, the increased mortality rate of current antipsychotic exposure could be partly balanced by a lowered mortality rate caused by the lowered level of BPSD. No previous studies have investigated the effects of cumulative dosages of antipsychotic drug on specific cause mortality in AD, but findings of decreased mortality appear in studies of schizophrenia and bipolar affective disorders where the effects of cumulative drug dosages have been investigated [20], [21].",

These findings confirm the established concern about the use of antipsychotic drugs in patients diagnosed with AD, but also highlight the need for further investigations of long-term effects of treatment, and possible sub-groups who could benefit from treatment.",
