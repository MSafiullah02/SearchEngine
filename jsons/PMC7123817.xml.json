Nearly 10% of cancer patients will at some point be afflicted with a life-threatening condition justifying ICU admission [14, 32]. The most common reason for transfer to a critical care ward is organ failure [134, 162]. Acute organ failure may be related to co-morbid illness, cancer treatment, or the malignancy itself. Any organ may be affected, yet respiratory failure is the most frequent and most feared indication for ICU admission [133, 162].",

The importance of expeditious diagnostic precision is reviewed in the context of the outcomes of respiratory failure. The increased use of high resolution computer tomography (HRCT) has greatly aided in narrowing the differential diagnosis of respiratory failure in oncology patients which leads to more efficient use of invasive diagnostic modalities. We will review some classic patterns on HRCT that suggest specific diagnoses with a high sensitivity and specificity. In terms of management, we review the literature on the utility and risks of invasive mechanical ventilation in immunocompromised cancer patients and further discuss the impact of current noninvasive ventilation strategies in this population. Finally, we will offer a general approach to diagnosis and management of respiratory failure in patients with active malignancy.",

In general the number of cases of acute respiratory failure is on the rise. In 2009 there were 1,917,910 cases of ARF in the United States resulting in 381,155 deaths and in inpatient cost of 54 billion dollars [166]. This translated into 784 cases of respiratory failure per 100,000 people, or an incidence of 0.7% [166]. Respiratory failure occurs in 5% of patients with solid tumors, 20% in those with hematologic malignancies, and in up to 50% of those undergoing bone marrow transplant [42]. For those cancer patients that survive respiratory-related critical illness, the estimated cost per year of life gained is nearly 83,000 dollars for patients with solid tumors and 189,000 dollars for patients with hematologic malignancy [151]. This figure is projected to increase with the use of novel antineoplastic treatments such as adoptive cell therapy with chimeric antigen receptor redirected T-cells (CAR-T) as such therapy itself is associated with a price tag of over 400,000 dollars [19]. Short-term survival of respiratory related critical illness in cancer patients has improved. However, the effects of chronic respiratory complications remain unclear. ",

The use of RT has increased, in part as it is tolerated well, generally with few side effects. The lung is radiosensitive and toxicity may occur as collateral damage with an incidence of up to 28%. The incidence is less frequent when radiation is used for treatment of breast cancer [115]. Clinically, the lung has two distinct pathologic responses to ionizing radiation. Radiation pneumonitis is an acute or subacute reaction which occurs within 6 months of thoracic radiotherapy. Risk for acute radiation pneumonitis depends on concomitant use of certain chemotherapy agents, prior radiation, total dose and field size, as well as host factors such as prior chronic lung disease [52]. Dyspnea, cough, and fever develop prior to radiographic changes. Pulmonary function tests demonstrate restrictive ventilatory defect. Reduction in the diffusion capacity (DLCO) is the most sensitive maker of acute and subacute radiation injury [126]. Depending on the degree of lung tissue damaged, the course may be self-limited or progress to severe acute lung injury and fulminant hypoxic respiratory failure [82]. CT correlation can be used to assess the severity of disease. Oxygen and concomitant chemotherapy may worsen the lung injury [168]. The areas of RP tend to develop fibrosis over time [49].

Fibrosis may cause distortion of the interstitium or traction of the airways. Fibrosis may alter the function of the mucociliary elevator and predispose patients to infection [126].

The presentation is often subacute or chronic and insidious as opposed to acute. It is estimated that up to 20% of patients treated with cytotoxic drugs may develop respiratory symptoms [158]. Numerous drugs are associated with various forms of pulmonary toxicity and the diagnosis should be considered in any cancer patient with new respiratory failure and pulmonary opacities on chest imaging. Drug-induced damage may be dose dependent or idiosyncratic [131]. Databases such as Pneumotox (https://www.pneumotox.com/drug/index/) have been established detailing the many histopathologic and radiologic findings associated with numerous agents. These resources are invaluable in formulating a differential diagnosis and it is often useful to correlate a specific radiographic pattern to a drug in question. In terms of pathophysiological mechanism, bleomycin toxicity is well understood and serves as an archetype for our understanding of drug-induced pulmonary toxicity. Bleomycin damages capillary endothelium and type I pneumocytes leading to free radical damage and exaggerated inflammatory response. Given the release of free radicals, oxygen therapy may worsen the lung injury. This is an unfortunate paradox as the very supportive care used in hypoxemia may be detrimental [46, 168, 171]. The clinical and/or radiographic pattern is variable and not specific to any drug. Common features include: organizing pneumonia, eosinophilic pneumonia, cardiac and noncardiac pulmonary edema, bronchoconstriction, diffuse alveolar hemorrhage, radiation recall, and more [92, 148, 150].

It has been reported after engraftment of in bone marrow recipients and is associated with acute and chronic graft versus host disease [4]. It may also occur in the context of lung cancer or hematologic malignancy including acute and chronic leukemias, myelodysplastic syndrome, t-cell leukemia, Evans syndrome, and Hodgkin disease [167].

Risk also increases with advanced stage of cancer and tumor type. Of the solid tumors, brain, pancreatic, and stomach cancers are most associated with thromboembolic disease. Of the hematologic malignancies, AML is the most frequent culprit of thrombosis [186]. Most pulmonary emboli originate in the proximal veins of the lower extremities. Pulmonary embolism may be classified as acute or chronic, by size, or by hemodynamic characteristics [95, 96]. Low molecular weight heparin is the agent of choice for treatment [96, 105]. In cases of massive pulmonary embolism with hemodynamic compromise, the American College of Chest Physicians suggests use of thrombolytics or catheter directed thrombolysis (Grade 2B and 2C recommendations) [96]. Use of thrombolytics is contraindicated in the stable patient [96], though there is much debate if hemodynamically stable patients with high risk of deterioration (submassive PE) benefit from clot lysis [119]. Often patients with malignancy have contraindications to anticoagulation. These patients may benefit from placement of a filter within the inferior vena cava. However, recent evidence notes that in patients that can receive anticoagulation, the concomitant use of such filters may not prevent recurrence of pulmonary embolism [120]. ",

Chest radiograph may or may not reveal infiltrates. Partial pressure of oxygen in an arterial blood gas may be spuriously low due to local metabolic activity of neutrophils.

Yet this procedure yields a diagnosis in approximately 50% of patients [39, 40, 114, 138, 177]. Some studies quote a higher diagnostic yield of nearly 90% in the bone marrow transplant population [165]. More recent data suggest that bronchoscopy changes the course of management in only 18% of cases [15]. The procedure is not without risk although the complication rates of bronchoscopy are generally low and occur in less than 1% of patients. However, in the hypoxemic cancer patient, the risk of complications increases tenfold. Open lung biopsy or video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery may provide a specific diagnosis more frequently than bronchoscopy. Yet the complication rates may be even higher with a surgical approach. Often the critically ill cancer patient is of poor protoplasm for undergoing surgery with general anesthesia [168]. In essence, the moderate diagnostic yield of bronchoscopy (or surgery) must be weighed against the risk of complications. The primary concern is worsening hypoxemia to the degree requiring invasive mechanical ventilation. This complication is a near death sentence asmechanical ventilation in those with hematologic malignancy portends a mortality rate ranging from 44% to 100% [14]. Those with solid malignancy have improved outcomes undergoing mechanical ventilation compared to patients with hematologic disease. Given this risk, multiple simultaneous noninvasive modalities (echocardiography, computed tomography, etc.) should be considered prior to bronchoscopy. Noninvasive testing without bronchoscopy is noninferior to FO-BAL in identifying a cause of ARF in patients with cancer and may in fact identify the cause of ARF more quickly than FO-BAL [15].",

Acute cardiogenic pulmonary edema is present in 10% of cancer patients with ARF. Given the wide prevalence of coronary artery disease and the use of cardiotoxic agents such as anthracyclines, pericardial effusions and cardiogenicpulmonary edema should be ruled out in all cancer patients with acute respiratory failure. History, exam, and review of medications may increase suspicion for acute heart failure. Interestingly, plasma brain natriuretic peptide may be spuriously elevated in patients with malignancy (sources). Therefore, caution is warranted in the use of BNP in cancer patients. Echocardiography is the diagnostic modality of choice to suggest the presence of cardiac dysfunction. Bedside ultrasound may reveal evidence of extra-vascular lung water or pleural effusions [137].",

The Karius Digital Culture\u2122 is a clinically validated test that can rapidly detect more than 1,250 bacteria, viruses, fungi, and parasites from a single blood draw. It has been demonstrated to have high diagnostic yield of fastidiously difficult to culture pathogens, as well in those patients who have already received broad spectrum antibiotics. A pilot study revealed probable infectious culprits (including Aspergillus fumigatus) in 18 patients with neutropenic fever, even in patients with no definitively positive blood cultures (need to add the source). This testing modality seems promising, but more research is needed before becoming mainstream, especially at the cost of 2,000 USD.",

The sensitivity and specificity of thoracic computed tomography is greater in the evaluation of suspected infection. In addition it also provides detailed patterns such as nodules, infiltrates and consolidation, cysts, cavitation, and more, which can guide physicians in establishing a differential diagnosis and in planning invasive diagnostic procedures. For example, with the appropriate history of a patient with Hodgkin\u2019s disease or a patient on corticosteroids, a diffuse bilateral process with hilar ground glass opacities and interlobular septal thickening (crazy-paving) with cysts of varying size should be considered infection with Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia until proven otherwise.

In 2000, Antonelli et al. evaluated the use of NIV in postoperative solid organ transplant recipients. While cancer patients were not included, use of NIV in these immunocompromised patients following transplantation improved PaO2 and reduced the rate of fatal complications. In addition, those treated with NIV less often required escalation to mechanical ventilation [8]. The following year, a single center, randomized controlled trail of 52 immunocompromised hypoxemic patients demonstrated that noninvasive positive pressure ventilation delivered by face mask reduced mortality and reduced complications when compared to oxygen therapy alone [89]. The population in this study was overwhelmingly comprised of patients with hematologic cancers. This study noted a 93% case mortality rate in those patients treated with oxygen alone. Over the subsequent decade, survival of cancer patients in the ICU improved, even among those undergoing mechanical ventilation. Along with this trend, fewer studies demonstrated benefit of NIV in hematology patients. Often the etiology of respiratory failure was not taken into account, nor was time on onset of ARF to trial of noninvasive ventilation controlled. Patients with cardiogenic pulmonary edema and hypercapnic respiratory failure were included, the presence of which may have further confounded the ability to parse out which patients truly benefited from an early trial of NIV [64].",

There was no mortality difference between the two groups, nor was there a difference in escalation to ICU level care or implementation of invasive mechanical ventilation [184]. Studies in patients without cancer presenting withhypoxic respiratory failure due to community acquired pneumonia and without associated organ dysfunction have shown benefit with the use of NIV [36, 72, 97].

Hypoxic respiratory failure de novo is often prolonged and not immediately reversible. In contrast to hypercapnic respiratory failure or type I respiratory failure from cardiogenic pulmonary edema, NIV without substantial inspiratory support does not reduce the work of breathing in most cases of hypoxia [103]. The inspiratory demand is increased in settings of hypoxia. This flow demand imparts more diaphragmatic inspiratory effort, ergo vast reductions in intrapleural pressure. Combining large negative pleural pressure with increased inspiratory pressures produces enormous swings in transpulmonary pressure and tidal volumes which may worsen diffuse lung injury [94]. In addition, many causes of type I respiratory failure are anatomically heterogeneous resulting in over distention of smaller, healthier sections of lung. Respiratory compliance is associated with the volume of this remaining functional lung. Recent data from a post hoc observational analysis of nine randomized trials have associated driving pressure (tidal volume divided by respiratory system compliance) as a surrogate marker of \u201cadjusted lung size.\u201d In this study, the relative risk of death increased in a near linear fashion with increasing driving pressures, even when tidal volume is kept within a \u201clung protective\u201d window of 6 ml/kg ideal body weight [7]. Higher driving pressures in NIV are associated with patient intolerance, leak around the mask, as well as gastric over distention with possible aspiration [103].",

Benefits in patients with cancer have been demonstrated in the palliative arena [67, 83, 106]. Yet the place of this modality of support is not firmly established. A randomized controlled trial reported survival benefit in type I respiratory failure when HFNC was used in lieu NIV or standard oxygen therapy [74]. This was not borne out in a 2017 study specifically examining the use of HFNC in patients with hematologic malignancy and solid cancers. In this group, HFNC reduced the likelihood of intubation but had no significant effect on mortality [17]. Currently the HIGH study is enrolling patients to evaluate the survival benefit of HFNC in immunocompromised patients. This will be the largest multicenter, randomized controlled trial to date evaluating HFNC in cancer patients. The study completion date is estimated December 2018 [18].",

Such risks include high illness severity scores, presence of ARDS or multifocal lung involvement, prolonged duration of NIV, septic shock or concomitant use of vasoactive agents, male gender, high respiratory rate, and presence of documented pulmonary infection [11, 71] Within the last 2 years, predictive models have been created to assess a patient\u2019s risk for failing NIV. The HACOR score is one such model. This validated score ranging from 0 to 25 points takes into account the following variables of heart rate, acidosis, level of consciousness, oxygenation, and respiratory rate. Rate of failure of NIV in a patient scoring <5 is only 18%, whereas a score >5 predicts failure of NIV in 78% [65].",

If used for hypoxemia, NIV should be restricted to areas of high monitoring (ICU level care) and performed early with a time sensitive trial and only in the absence of risk factors that portend high likelihood of failure. Such use is consistent with the use of NIV in the general population as outlined by the American Thoracic Society and European Respiratory Society. Otherwise NIV should be utilized in situations of established benefit such as hypercapnic respiratory failure, cardiogenic pulmonary edema, and in those patients with respiratory failure in the postoperative setting [146]. Many patients present advance directives that preclude the use of mechanical ventilation. In these patients, it is reasonable to utilize NIV or even HFNC. Much as in ARDS, there is no place for non-invasive ventilation in cancer patients with hypoxemic respiratory failure and high risk of NIV failure. Such patients should simply be intubated and mechanically ventilated. ",

Aside from physiologic challenges of respiratory failure, anatomic difficulties are frequent in the cancer population. This is exemplified in the case of a patient with head and neck squamous cell cancer and acute upper airway obstruction. Such anatomical distortion needs to be considered to minimize potential complications and avoid a situation in which one cannot oxygenate nor ventilate. The rate of complications of airway management differs by clinical setting. Failed intubation happens rarely (1 in 2000) in elective surgical cases in the controlled arena of the operating theatre. This number is far more frequent in the emergency department and ICU setting and failed intubation may occur in one of every 50 ICU patients [53]. In every patient requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation predictors of difficulty anatomy and physiology should be sought prior to initiating rapid sequence intubation (RSI). Indeed, RSI may be detrimental to securing the airway in selected patients with severe hypoxemia, right heart failure, hemodynamic instability, or profound obesity [123]. For initial evaluation of the difficult anatomic airway, the mnemonic LEMON is often used. This approach has the clinician evaluate for anatomical difficulties by Looking externally for unusual anatomy, body habitus, scars, etc., Evaluating incisor distance, the length from hyoid to mentum, and the thyroid to mouth, and assessing jaw mobility and mouth opening. Next the Mallampati score is determined on the classic I\u2013IV scale. Class III and above predict a difficult intubation. Obstruction sought out next, especially in the patient with head and neck cancer. Finally, impairment in Neck mobility also presents an anatomic challenge to successful first pass endotracheal intubation. Neck mobility in cancer patients may occur due to prior surgery or as sequela of radiation therapy. If the difficulty anatomic airway is predicted and time allots, it is prudent to seek airway expertise or consider an awake, fiber optic intubation.",

Three physiologically difficult characteristics have been described including hypoxemia, hypotension, and right heart failure. Hypoxemic patients are at risk for rapid desaturation during intubation. Tissue hypoxia implies impaired oxygen delivery or grossly exaggerated oxygen consumption, often both. In a patient with central obesity, the oxygen reserve or functional residual capacity (FRC) is reduced, and when this patient is struck with hypoxia, the time to desaturation during RSI is rapid. It is suggested that if time permits, every patient undergo a period of preoxygenation prior to intubation [172], preferably with NIV [21]. Note that the indication for NIV in this instance is for preparation for mechanical ventilation. NIV has been shown to improve preoxygenation and end-tidal oxygen far better than standard oxygen alone [21, 164]. Once apneic, implementation of \u201cdiffusion respiration\u201d or apneic oxygenation provides a buffer against hypoxia by providing a steady flow of oxygen though the upper airway which passively diffuses to the alveoli as oxygen is taken up into the blood stream [173]. HFNC is purportedly an ideal method of diffusion respiration [183]. While prolonged NIV and HFNC may not be appropriate therapy for hypoxemia, their place may be upheld in preparation for securing the airway for mechanical ventilation.",

This combination especially frequent and challenging in the cancer patient as hypotension is common. Side effects of chemotherapy predispose to volume loss by vomiting and dehydration [29]. Sequestration of intravascular fluid into the interstitium occurs later in disease as protein-calorie malnutrition becomes common. Sepsis, cytokine storm from novel therapy, pulmonary embolism, blood loss, and more may contribute to a state of poor perfusion which in turn imparts increased oxygen extraction and subsequent hypoxemia. Hypoxemia may contribute to tissue hypoxia and subsequent metabolic acidosis. This acidic milieu can impair the effect of native catecholamines and thereby worsen hypotension [30]. The negative intrathoracic pressure of spontaneous respiration acts to pull blood from the venous reservoir and increase venous return. Transition to positive pressure increases intrathoracic pressure and reduces this venous return. As such, a patient teetering on the brink may be subject to further hypotension as a result of commonly used induction agents or the implementation of positive pressure ventilation [75, 76]. As many as 30% of critically ill patients experience cardiovascular collapse following intubation [135]. This in turn contributes to longer runs of mechanical ventilation and increased ICU stay which can be detrimental to the immunocompromised cancer patient [75, 76, 86, 124]. Assessment of volume status and appropriate resuscitation and consideration of vasopressor infusion may be appropriate in the peri-intubation phase of the critically ill cancer patient requiring endotracheal intubation [123].",

Such physiology may develop as a result of pulmonary emboli,pulmonary hypertension, or cor pulmonale from any cause of hypoxemia in the cancer patient. Much like the pulmonary circulation, the right ventricle is a low-pressure, high-compliance pump. However, it has limited ability to adapt to acute insult. Hypotension due to right heart failure needs careful evaluation prior to initiation of positive pressure ventilation as increased intrathoracic pressure also increases right ventricular afterload. Hypoxia from ARF induces pulmonary vascular vasoconstriction which places further strain on an ailing RV. Measures normally thought of to restore perfusion pressures such as volume resuscitation or vasoactive agents may further impede RV function and perpetuate poor LV filling and hypotension. If RV dysfunction is suspected prior to intubation, bedside echocardiography should be performed to evaluate for signs of RV failure. In this situation, avoidance of hypoxemia with preoxygenation and apneic oxygenation are a must, and consider \u201cblood pressure neutral\u201d drugs for induction. Initial ventilator settings should target a lower mean airway pressure (if possible) until further stabilization. If available prior to intubation, one may consider application of inhaled nitric oxide or inhaled epoprostenol to improve V/Q mismatch and augment RV unloading and LV filling [123]. ",

A \u201clung-protective\u201d strategy should be implemented with tidal volumes of 4\u20138 ml/kg ideal body weight, as well as selecting a modest level of positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) and making best efforts to limit plateau pressures (in a volume targeted mode of ventilation) to less than 30 cmH20 [1]. Such remains the current standard of care despite studies over the last decade challenging this dogma. Once severe hypoxemia occurs, emphasis should be on providing adequate oxygenation while attempting to reduce or eliminate ventilator-induced lung injury. Whether pressure or volume targeted therapy is used, selection of appropriate PEEP may be especially important in the patient with suspected chemotherapy or radiation-induced lung injury as it may obviate the need for injurious levels of inspired oxygen [37, 80, 117]. While the three major studies in this area (ALVEOLI, LOV and EXPRESS) reported no survival benefit, they did demonstrate improvements in PaO2/FiO2. Many strategies to select PEEP area available, including incremental trial of PEEP, decremental selection of PEEP, and observation of the pressure-time curve during constant flow volume targeted ventilation (stress index) [80]. For simplicity, the ARDS Clinical Trial Network has created a table with suggested degrees of PEEP based on requirements for FiO2 (Table 5).",

            "text": " Whether or not to admit a patient with potentially severe illness to the ICU is a central dilemma faced by intensivists. Preconceived notions are difficult to abolish. Twenty years ago mechanical ventilation following bone marrow transplanted was associated with a mere 2\u20136% chance of survival. In this study from 1992, the authors elaborated that of 348 bone marrow transplant patients requiring mechanical ventilation, none survived if they required mechanical ventilation for more than 9 days [59]. Further studies in the early 1990s demonstrated high mortality rates of cancer patients in medical intensive care units [35, 151]. This perpetuated a mentality that admission of such patients to the ICU was futile care. Indeed attitudes toward the care of critically ill oncology patients vary by medical subspecialty [130]. Whereas intensivists may focus on organ failure and retain pessimistic notions of the outcomes of critically ill cancer patients [25], oncologists emphasize aspects of cancer therapy and tend to overestimate survival of oncologic patients with acute respiratory failure [50]. Therefore, a multidisciplinary approach with frequent communication between ICU teams, oncology, and palliative care is vital to minimize misconceptions and clarify viewpoints of patient care. Such comprehensive multidisciplinary care is associated with improved survival in this population [101].",

Excluding individuals with hematopoietic stem cell transplant, oncology patients requiring mechanical ventilation for ARF have a 40% mortality rate. For perspective, a 2004 study identified a 38% mortality rate for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients undergoing mechanical ventilation for exacerbation of COPD [100].

Similarly, adult HCT recipients that require endotracheal intubation have mortality rates near 70% [6]. Variation between studies may be attributed to differences in indication for mechanical ventilation. However, several factors have been identified that portend an especially poor prognosis. These include respiratory failure from a poorly reversible cause [159], underlying chronic pulmonary illness [24], severe hypoxemia prior to intubation (PaO2 <50 mmHg) [81], and prolonged need for mechanical ventilation [69].
