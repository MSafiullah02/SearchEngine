Barczak, 1,2 and Shiv Pillai In December 2019, several cases of pneumonia of unknown origin were reported in Wuhan, China. The causative agent was characterized as a novel coronavirus, initially referred to as 2019-nCoV and renamed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) (Zhou et al., 2020b) . This respiratory illness, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has spread rapidly by human-to-human transmission, caused major outbreaks worldwide, and resulted in considerable morbidity and mortality. On March 11, 2020, WHO classified COVID-19 as a pandemic. It has stressed health systems and the global economy, as governments balance prevention, clinical care, and socioeconomic challenges.",

Coronaviruses are enveloped positivesense, single-stranded RNA viruses with mammalian and avian hosts. Human coronaviruses include 229E, NL63, OC43, and HKU1, which are associated with mild seasonal illness, as well as viruses responsible for past outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). Genetic analyses implicate bats as a natural reservoir of coronaviruses and other animals as potential intermediate hosts in the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 (Andersen et al., 2020) .",

The S protein binds to the ACE2 enzyme on the plasma membrane of type 2 pneumocytes and intestinal epithelial cells. After binding, the S protein is cleaved by a host membrane serine protease, TMPRSS2, facilitating viral entry (Hoffmann et al., 2020) .",

In severe cases, there is likely an initial delay in the antiviral response and subsequently increased production of inflammatory cytokines with an influx of monocytes and neutrophils into the lung, leading to cytokine storm syndrome. These cytokines, including interleukin (IL)-1, IL-6, IL-12, and tumor necrosis factor-\u0251, lead to increased vascular permeability and may contribute to respiratory failure (Prompetchara et al., 2020) . Another hallmark of severe disease is lymphopenia, which may be due to direct infection of lymphocytes or suppression of bone marrow by the antiviral response. Neutralizing IgM and IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 can be detected within 2 weeks of infection; it is still unknown whether patients are protected from reinfection (W\u00f6lfel et al.., 2020; Prompetchara et al., 2020) .",

It can spread over longer distances when aerosolized. Once infection is established, the clinical course of COVID-19 is variable, making both case identification and triage difficult. Notably, asymptomatic and presymptomatic transmission has been described. For those who become symptomatic, the incubation period, the time from exposure to symptom onset, is 4-5 days on average (Li et al., 2020) . The most common symptoms include cough, fever, and fatigue. For a minority of patients, the disease worsens approximately 5-10 days after symptom onset, resulting in complications such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and other end organ failure (Zhou et al., 2020a) . Patients over 60 and those with comorbid conditions, including cardiovascular disease, underlying respiratory conditions, and cancer, are at higher risk for these severe complications and death. In comparison, children have a milder clinical course (CDC, 2020).",
