            "text": "The recent Surviving Sepsis Campaign: Guidelines on the Management of Critically Ill Adults with Coronavirus Disease 2019 consensus statement agrees that; following admission for COVID-19, each patient may progress at a variable rate to either recovery, with minimal oxygen requirements and no ventilatory support, or a worsening of the disease process and the need for an escalation in NIV and mechanical ventilation. 6 When COVID-19 progression is identified, the current critical care management recommendation is to initiate early endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation. 6 This recommendation aims to avoid emergent intubation in a rapidly decompensating patient should worsening hypoxemia develop if intubation is delayed. This recommendation is also aimed at source control, decreasing the risk of cross contamination from droplet and aerosolized viral particles to other patients and health care workers (HCW). 6 All persons under investigation (PUI) for COVID-19 and all COVID-19 positive patients should wear a mask. 6, 7 It is also recommended that all HCWs should wear droplet and contact personal protective equipment (PPE) to provide a mechanical barrier to droplet spread and ideally be greater than 2 meters from the patient. 6, 7 Additional airborne PPE is required during any aerosol generating medical procedures (AGMP) in these patients. 6, 7 These recommendations are based on reports that 11% of critically ill patients in Wuhan required High Flow Nasal Cannula (HFNC) and this increased the risk of viral aerosolization and droplet transmission . 3, 6, 8, 9 While HFNC poses significant risks for providers, patient mortality associated with mechanical ventilation is also significant. Mortality among COVID-19 patients over 65 years of age in the Seattle was at least 62%. 10 A recent report from the experience in New York found the mortality associated with intubation and mechanical ventilation in 5700 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 was 76% in the those aged 18 to 65 years and 97% in patients over 65 years of age. 11 The usual features of typical ARDS, recently termed the H-type, in COVID-19 patients are a progressive deteriorating lung compliance requiring increased inspired oxygen concentration(FiO 2 ), high positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP), prone ventilation, sedation with paralysis and inotropic support. 12 There is growing evidence that a subset of COVID-19 patients present with atypical ARDS which has recently been termed to L-Type ARDS: severe hypoxemia but well-preserved pulmonary mechanics, good lung compliance and low lung congestion. 12, 13 (Table 1) The respiratory support requirements for COVID-19 patients with L-type atypical respiratory ARDS physiology may require different respiratory support principles than that usually provided to patients presenting with the typical H-Type classic ARDS. 14 As a result, several have advocated a ventilation strategy focused on the principle where less is more. [12] [13] [14] [15] Mechanical ventilation should be delivered with low tidal volumes, low plateau pressure and a low PEEP level, 15 albeit with a higher inspired fraction of oxygen (FiO 2 ). 14 It is postulated that the hypoxemia in this subset of COVID-19 patients with more compliant lungs may be due to a large shunt secondary from the loss of the protective mechanism of lung perfusion regulation and the loss of pulmonary hypoxic vasoconstriction and microthrombi in pulmonary vascualtrure. 12, 16 As a result of the coagulopathy seen in this disease, anticoagulation in the treatment algorithms is an important therapeutic modality in COVID-19. 17 The fact that many of these COVID-19 patients with L-Type ARDS with good lung compliance show improved oxygen saturation during prone positioning, may be related to improved lung perfusion and the force of gravity affecting pulmonary blood flow. 12",

These MAGPs include; NIV and HFNC bag-mask ventilation, endotracheal intubation or tube suctioning, bronchoscopy, transport, tracheostomy tube change, and high-frequency oscillatory ventilation, etc. 6, 20, 21 We do know that NIV can play a significant role in respiratory support. A recent systematic review and metanalysis concluded that NIV can improve survival in the acute care settings when it is applied early for respiratory failure, however the benefit is lost when it is used too late in respiratory deterioration. 18 Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is a mode in NIV used to treat hypoxemic acute respiratory failure (hARF). This mode of respiratory support delivers a constant positive airway pressure during both inspiration and expiration. 22, 23 Helmet CPAP is an important and evidence-based airway adjunct. 18, 19, 24, 25 While it is not intended to replace endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilatory support in the critically ill patient, it can be used for more patients than intubation and confines aerosolized viral particle spread within the helmet. Determining which patients will undergo rapid progression from mild respiratory disease, or the L-type better compliance form of respiratory failure, to overt H-Type ARDS in COVID-19 is often not clear in the early course of the disease. 13, 14 Recent literature suggests that although only 10-14% of COVID-19 patients need ICU, 60-70% of those will develop progressive ARDS and 20-25% will require endotracheal intubation and ventilation. 6, [26] [27] [28] Helmet CPAP, as used in Italy, can play a significant role in helping to determine patient severity.",

It further enables patient self-proning to improve oxygenation, which limits the need for multiple personnel to perform this in the intubated patient The helmet allows for a safe means of containing droplet and aerosolization of virus particles by the use of a heat moisture exchange (HME) filter on the inspiratory and expiratory limb of the helmet. The comfort of the helmet also limits the need for sedation and subsequent inotropic support when compared to endotracheal intubation. With the use of the helmet, the need for rapid early intubation can often safely be delayed while a patient is observed carefully for any improvement in disease or deterioration in their condition.

If observed, the patient should undergo endotracheal intubation because any increased work of breathing and the generation of excessive negative intrathoracic pressure to move air has been shown to cause a self-inflicted lung injury (SILI). 14, 35 Determining patient breathing effort during progression of respiratory disease is not always easy. To more precisely quantify patient breathing work effort, esophageal manometry although not commonly used, may be needed in these patients to measure the generation of changes in intrathoracic pressure . 34 Esophageal pressure changes of 5 to 10 cmH 2 O may be well tolerated. However, if an esophageal pressure change greater than 15 cmH 2 O is generated, the risk of self-inflicted lung injury (SILI) is increased and endotracheal intubation should be performed promptly. 14 If endotracheal intubation is delayed in this situation, and a further sudden clinical deterioration occurs, it can be associated with hypoxemia, cardiovascular collapse and an emergent endotracheal intubation may be required, which puts the HCW team at risk during the MAGP. 6, 7, 36 Naturally it is not practical to monitor respiratory effort with manometry in a pandemic situation.",

            "text": "The first helmet prototypes were developed in 1991 by Maurizio Borsari. One of the problems with CPAP helmets available in other parts of the world is that they are not all FDA approved and most U.S. physicians are unfamiliar with the helmet. (Figure 1 ) However, the concept and fitting of the mask is relatively simple. Patients typically can sit up or lie down on some pillows. It is likely that the CPAP helmet NIV, is best used in the early phase of the disease or during recovery after extubation. The CPAP helmet consists of a transparent plastic hood that surrounds the patient's head. The helmet does not have any pressure points on the face, thereby reducing patient discomfort and improving device tolerance without the risk of skin necrosis. 25 The helmet allows the patient to see, read, talk, and interact more easily than other NIV respiratory devices. It is available in various sizes that can fit small children and adults. 23 It has a soft latex free collar constructed of silicon-polyvinyl chloride that creates a pneumatic seal around the patient's neck. The presence of two or more inlet and outlet ports enable connections of standard respiratory inspiratory and expiratory limb tubing. A high efficiency particulate (HEPA) filter is placed on the expiratory limb of the circuit to minimize exhaled aerosolized viral particles. 8 Additionally, there is a distal variable CPAP valve. The extra ports allow a sealed site for the insertion of a naso-gastric tube, or the administration of a nebulizer. This port also enables the patient to drink from a straw. A monitor controls the gas flow in the helmet (n= 30-60 liters to prevent rebreathing and CO 2 retention), temperature and FiO 2 . The presence of a zip in the helmet allows easy access if needed. The noise level in the CPAP helmet is equal 100 dB which can be reduced with a HME filter on the helmet gas inspiratory limb. 38 Helmet CPAP requires a fairly cooperative patient with an intact neuromuscular system but tolerance appears to be excellent especially in those patients who feel claustrophobic with a tight fitting CPAP face mask. Armpit straps can be replaced with a counterweight system that results in better patient comfort and humidification can be added to the system. 8 Occasionally, it may be necessary to reduce anxiety with the administration of very light sedation.",

Patients were randomized to receive CPAP via helmet or a face mask. The trial was terminated early because the helmet arm was found to be superior. The intubation rate was 61.5% (n = 24) for the face mask group and 18.2% (n = 8) for the helmet group (absolute difference, -43.3%; 95% CI, -62.4% to -24.3%; P < .001). The number of ventilator-free days was also significantly higher in the helmet group (28 vs 12.5, P < .001). At 90 days, 15 patients (34.1%) in the helmet group died compared with 22 patients (56.4%) in the face mask group (absolute difference, -22.3%; 95% CI, -43.3 to -1.4; P = .02). Adverse events included 3 interface-related skin ulcers for each group (ie, 7.6% in the face mask group had nose ulcers and 6.8% in the helmet group had neck ulcers). 25 A further systematic review in 2016 that included 11 studies involving 621 patients, found that the overall hospital mortality was 17.53 % in the helmet NIV group versus 30.67 % in the control group. Use of the helmet CPAP was associated with lower hospital mortality (OR 0.43, 95 % CI 0.26 to 0.69, p=0.0005), intubation rate (OR 0.32, 95 % CI 0.21 to 0.47, P<0.00001), and complications (OR 0.6, 95 % CI 0.4 to 0.92, P=0.02). In contrast, there was no significant difference in gas exchange and ICU stay (P >0.05). Subgroup analysis found the helmet reduced mortality mainly in hARF patients (P<0.05) and a lower intubation rate was shown. Additionally, the effect of the helmet on PaCO 2 was",
