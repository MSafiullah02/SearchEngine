The use of biological threat agents in biological warfare has a long history, but the recent use of anthrax spores in bioterrorism has urged the need for responding to such threats. The design of efficient and reliable detection and identification systems is a part of bioterrorism preparedness and response. Classical microbiology, immunoassays, and nucleic acid-based methods including molecular forensics are laboratory approaches for detecting and identifying various biological threat agents. These are supplementary methods needed for verification. However, the analysis results depend on the sample collection and handling. This chapter briefly summarizes some biological warfare and bioterrorism events, the threat posed by bioterrorism. Also, various methods and systems suitable for detection and identification of biological Biological warfare is the deliberate dispersion of infectious microorganisms (i.e., bacteria, rickettsiae, fungi, and viruses) or toxins with the intent to be produced naturally by microorganisms, plants, or animals, or even synthesized chemically. Biological weapons (BWs) are weapons containing infectious biological material and are regarded as weapons of mass destruction (WMD), or more appropriately as weapons of mass casualty [reviewed delivery system such as a physical weapon (i.e., standard munitions, threat agents, with emphasis on environmental samples, are described. in 1, 2].

For civilian purposes such equipment is used for production of beer, yoghurt, vaccines, and antibiotics. There are several barriers in obtaining an effective BW, and two of the major challenges are (i) the development of a sufficiently virulent and infectious strain for the seed stock and (ii) the selection of the most appropriate dissemination method of the biological threat agent. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has established a list of biological agents and toxins that may pose a severe threat to public health and safety (http://www.cdc.gov/od/sap). The requirements for including the agent or toxin to this \"select agent list\" are based on the effect on human health of exposure, the degree of contagiousness, the availability and effectiveness of medical treatment, and the vulnerability of various populations. Since October 2005, the reconstructed 1918 pandemic influenza virus has been added to this list. Table 1 provides examples of potential biological threat agents. The Australia Group has provided guidelines and control lists for national export of equipment, technology, and biological material that could contribute to BW activities (http://www.australiagroup.net/). [9] . There is a strong focus on the use of anthrax as a BW. This is due to the great stability of the anthrax spores ( 80 years), > the effectiveness as an infectious agent by inhalation, and the easy dissemination of the spores. Many experts believe that biological threat agents may be more useful for obtaining panic and anxiety causing serious psychological impact instead of resulting in high preserved tissue samples [10, 11] . The 1918 flu virus killed approximately 40 million people and might be regarded as one of the most effective bioweapon known. Newly emerging (e.g., SARS, Hendra, Nipah, and avian flu) and re-emerging (e.g., West Nile, human monkeypox, multidrug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis) pathogenic microorganisms are of global concern urging the needs for national preparedness plans, and the development and production of vaccines, antivirals, and other therapeutics.

            "text": "detection, while identification is the determination of the precise nature of the biological agent. Many systems can only detect, and not identify the biological agent. The identification system is usually dependent on specific signatures (DNA, protein) of the microorganism. Identification of S. typhimurium as the causing strain for the deliberate outbreak of salmonellosis by the Rajneeshee Cult took 4 days, but it took more than a year to identify and confirm that only a single strain of S. typhimurium had been used (in addition to the confession by one of the cult members about the deliberate release). This illustrates that, in some cases, identification may be time-consuming. Many bacterial threat agents occur naturally, and some may be closely related to other bacteria found in the environment. Thus, it is necessary to distinguish between terrorist events, naturally occurring outbreaks, and background levels. False positives (i.e., alarm, but no agent) may arise when the biological detector device responds to detect and identify an interfering substance in the sample (contamination), which is not the actual biological agent. If a biological agent exists, but below an instrument's threshold value for detection and identification, a false negative may occur. Thus, the detection and identification schemes need to be carefully designed. A biological point detector for environmental (air) monitoring contains several components (Figure 2) . A trigger may determine in real time any change in the biological background in air and discriminate between a biological threat agent and other particles in air, i.e., nonspecific detection. Particle sizers may be used as a trigger, exemplified by the Model 3321 Aerodynamic Particle Sizer from TSI and the Fluorescence Aerodynamic Particle Sizer FLAPS2 from Defence R&D Canada. The FLAPS2 measures the intrinsic fluorescence produced by living microorganisms. Using an ultraviolet (UV) laser, the wavelength 266 nm excites fluorescence from the amino acids tryptophan and tyrosine, while 355 nm excites fluorescence ranging (LIDAR) may also be used as a trigger and for detecting potential biological threat clouds. LIDAR is regarded as a detect-to-warn system false alarms. So far, LIDAR is not sufficiently operative during full daylight and needs good environmental conditions to function efficiently. A collector is used for concentrating the biological particles in air usually into a liquid. Spores, bacteria, and viruses are usually together or detecting ACPLA is to collect large enough air samples through a collector. The impinger SpinCon\u00ae air sampler from Sceptor Industries collects particles at a flow rate of 450 l/min in the range of 0.2-10 \u00b5m into a liquid. OMNI 3000, based on the SpinCon\u00ae technology, and the Biotrace Intelligent Cyclone Air Sampler (ICAS) collects air with a flow rate of 300 and 750 L/min, respectively. The BioCapture 650 from MesoSystems is a portable handheld air collector, suitable for first responders, sampling at a flow rate of 200 L/min. The efficiency of air collection is also dependent on the size of the particles. FFI is using both the SpinCon\u00ae and OMNI 3000 air collector for outdoor and indoor sampling of air (Figure 3) . These air samples are spiked with biological threat agents for polymerase chain characterize to a certain extent the biological origin of the aerosols. Even",

            "text": "Real-time PCR is the most commonly used nucleic acid-based method for specific and sensitive identification of biological threat agents. PCR may detect as low as 10-100 cells, but this method usually requires a clean sample. Disruption of bacterial cells and spores is often needed in order to make the DNA available for amplification in the PCR assay. An effective sample preparation may also reduce the presence of false negatives since impurities from the sample may inhibit the PCR assay. Specific identification by PCR is obtained by using specific primers and probe combinations. Each probe (e.g., TaqMan probes, fluorescence resonance energy transfer [FRET]-prober, and molecular beacons) has a different method of separating the fluorophore from the quencher when reporting the amplification process. Different reporter dyes (fluorophores) may be attached to the probes allowing simultaneous identification of several biological threat agents (multiplex identification). The PCR assay should include internal controls to avoid false positive signals. Internal controls may consist of either a plasmid or a DNA fragment in which the amplified DNA sequence is Several real-time PCR assays have been outlined for a number of biological threat agents, and commercial kits containing the specific reagents are available. The target genes and regions for PCR identification are specifically chosen for each microorganism. For Bacillus anthracis, several genes located on the virulence pXO1 and pXO2 plasmids, respectively. However, plasmid-free B. anthracis cells will only be identified by PCR when using specific chromosomal targets. The closest relative of B. anthracis is the opportunistic human pathogen B. cereus (soil bacterium) and the insect pathogen B. thuringiensis. These are functionally different, mainly distinguish by plasmid-encoded genes.

FFI has identified one unique chromosomal target for specific identification of B. anthracis (unpublished results). Several real-time PCR SmartCycler from Cepheid and the LightCycler from Roche Applied assays for identification of various biological threat agents listed in Table 1 have been established at FFI (exemplified in Figure 4 ) using either the 86 8.2. NUCLEIC ACID-BASED METHODS Science ( Figure 5 ). Idaho Technologies and Smiths detection (Bio-Seeq) have developed handheld PCR devices suitable for military use and first responders, such as Ruggedized advanced pathogen identification device (RAPID), and RAZOR, and Bio-Seeq, respectively. Bruker Daltonik GmbH has constructed a microarray system based on PCR for bioidentification. For review of various nucleic acid detection assays and systems see [18, 19, 21] . TM (Lightcycler ) using specific primers and probes (19) . PCR can detect DNA from both viable and dead cells, and thus, culturebased methods are needed for the assessment of bacterial viability. Nucleic acid sequence-based amplification (NASBA) is a method in which RNA Biodetection equipment for use in a battlefield is different from the use in a civilian community. If deployed in the right place and at the right time, valuable information of a bioterrorism event would be provided. The Joint Biological Point Detection System (JBPDS) is an automatic point detector for real-time identification of biological threat agents within 15 min and suitable for military use. It contains a trigger, collector, detector, and identifier, and will be used by the US Air Force and Marine Corps. Integrated systems for identification of various biological threat agents in large areas (e.g., arenas, airports) and postal service systems have been constructed, such as the Autonomous Pathogen Detection System (APDS) from Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory and the BioHazard Detection System (BDS) from Northrop Grumman, respectively.",

There have been many attempts to develop biosensors based on electrochemics, micro-fluidics, nanocrystals (quantum dots), and optics, combined with immuno-and nucleic acid-based assays, Classification of bacterial strains is often based on the identification of DNA polymorphisms. When the genetic diversity within a bacterial species is high, it is often adequate to sequence only a few number of DNA instead of DNA is amplified (reviewed in [30] [31] [32] ). NASBA can be used to detect viable cells since mRNA is specifically detected and amplified. The design of specific primers and molecular beacons is crucial for the NASBA assay. NASBA has been widely used for virus diagnostics, and only few reports describe the use of this technique for bacterial detection. This technique has been used together with liposomal-based biosensors to identify B. anthracis, Escherichia coli, and Cryptosporidium parvum [33] [34] [35] . FFI has used NASBA for identification of Vibrio cholerae in water samples [36] . but only few are commercially available (reviewed in [37, 21] ).",

Still, it is strongly believed that some terrorist organizations and certain states, which are parties to the Convention, do possess BW programs. It is generally believed that biological threat agents are easily acquired and that epidemic upon the residents. During the French and Indian Wars (17th century) blankets containing pus or dried scabs from patients infected with smallpox were given to the Native American tribes in order to transfer the disease. The Germans used biological agents for sabotage during the First World War such as infecting animal feed and horses intended for export. The Japan's biological warfare program during the Second World War included experiments using plague, cholera, and plague on prisoners,The use of biological agents in warfare has a long history [reviewed in 1].
