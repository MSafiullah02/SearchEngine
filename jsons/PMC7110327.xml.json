These exacerbations are associated with substantial morbidity, lead to approximately 2 million hospital admissions annually, cause respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation in some patients, and are an important cause of death in COPD [1]. Exacerbations are caused by a wide range of factors, including viral infection, bacterial infection, allergy, fluid overload, environmental factors and others [1], [2]. In order to develop successful strategies to better treat and prevent exacerbations, it will be important to elucidate more precisely the etiology of exacerbations. Unfortunately, the etiology of exacerbations is difficult to determine with certainty in individual patients.",

Viral pathogens have been identified by viral cultures, analysis of clinical samples by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and by serological tests. Since these assays are not routinely performed, the diagnosis of a viral infection is generally a presumptive, clinical diagnosis by the practicing physician. Several studies which utilized assays to identify viral pathogens have established that viral infection is associated with a significant proportion of exacerbations of COPD [3], [4], [5], [6], [7]. One study demonstrated that respiratory tract viral infections were present in 23% of hospitalizations in adults with COPD and in 45% of those admitted during winter months [3].",

A goal of the present study is to assess the immune response to non-typeable H. influenzae isolated from the sputum of patients experiencing exacerbations. Several studies have used this approach [8]. However, one must be cautious in interpreting these studies because recent work has established that the immune response to non-typeable H. influenzae in COPD is directed at strain-specific antigens [9], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14]. Therefore, in order to detect a human immune response to non-typeable H. influenzae, it is critical that the homologous infecting strain be used as the source of antigen in the immunoassays.",

Eleven of the 35 exacerbations (31.4%) were associated with the development of new serum IgG to the homologous isolate detected in whole cell ELISA. Although the demonstration of new serum IgG to non-typeable H. influenzae provides supportive evidence that the organism in the sputum was etiologic, no gold standard exists for unequivocally identifying the organism as the cause of an individual exacerbation. Some patients who experience exacerbations due to bacteria may develop an immune response which is not detected by using whole cell ELISA with serum. For example, a mucosal immune response can occur independent of a systemic immune response [32], [33]. Indeed, in a recent study, analysis of systemic and mucosal antibody responses to Moraxella catarrhalis isolated during exacerbations of COPD revealed instances of the development of mucosal IgA responses in the absence of serum IgG responses to the homologous isolate [34]. Similarly, cell-mediated immune responses to antigens of non-typeable H. influenzae may occur in adults with COPD independent of antibody responses [35]. Therefore, the absence of a new serum IgG response does not exclude the possibility that the exacerbation was caused by non-typeable H. influenzae. Furthermore, it is possible that colonization with an isolate of non-typeable H. influenzae may induce an immune response, even in the absence of a clinical exacerbation.",

First, the homologous isolate was used as the antigen in ELISA for all assays. A serious limitation of a large number of published studies on the immune response to non-typeable H. influenzae is the use of laboratory strains or heterologous isolates to detect immune responses [8]. The antibody response following infection with non-typeable H. influenzae is predominantly directed at strain-specific epitopes [9], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14]. Therefore it is important to use homologous isolates to measure immune responses to non-typeable H. influenzae as was done in this study. Second, adult human serum contains \u2018background\u2019 antibodies to many antigens of non-typeable H. influenzae. These antibodies are cross reactive with antigens on other bacteria and do not bind to the surface of non-typeable H. influenzae; thus, the antibodies are unlikely to mediate protective immune responses. The present study utilized whole bacterial cells in ELISA to increase the likelihood that antibodies which bind to the intact bacterial cell were detected.",

While a trend in this direction was observed, the data did not support this hypothesis. This study showed that exacerbations may be caused by virus alone, non-typeable H. influenzae alone, or virus and non-typeable H. influenzae simultaneously. In the case of evidence of simultaneous infection by virus and non-typeable H. influenzae, several interpretations are possible. First, the exacerbation may be caused by virus and H. influenzae is a colonizer that induces an immune response. Second, a viral infection may be the initial inciting event in the exacerbation and secondary infection with non-typeable H. influenzae occurs. This scenario has been proposed in several respiratory tract infections including otitis media, sinusitis and exacerbations of COPD. Third, a virus may be causing upper respiratory tract infection while the lower respiratory tract symptoms characteristic of an exacerbation are caused by non-typeable H. influenzae. It is not possible to draw a conclusion regarding these possibilities based on the data in the present study.",

A total of 45.7% of these exacerbations were associated with evidence of viral infection and approximately one third were associated with the development of serum IgG responses to the homologous isolate of non-typeable H. influenzae; overall, two thirds of exacerbations were associated with a viral infection or a rise in serum IgG to the homologous isolate of non-typeable H. influenzae. The data indicate that exacerbations may be caused by virus alone, non-typeable H. influenzae alone, or virus and non-typeable H. influenzae simultaneously.
