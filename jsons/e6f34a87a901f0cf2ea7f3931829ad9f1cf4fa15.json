Spatial variations were observed for both COVID-19 death outcomes and long-term ambient air pollutant levels. County-level average NO 2 concentrations were positively associated with both COVID-19 case-fatality rate and mortality rate in single-, bi-, and tri-pollutant models (p-values<0.05). Per inter-quartile range (IQR) increase in NO 2 (4.6 ppb), COVID-19 case-fatality rate and mortality rate were associated with an increase of 7.1% (95% CI 1.2% to 13.4%) and 11.2% (95% CI 3.4% to 19.5%), respectively. We did not observe significant associations between long-term exposures to PM 2.5 or O 3 and COVID-19 death outcomes (p-values>0.05), although per IQR increase in PM 2.5 (3.4 ug/m 3 ) was marginally associated with 10.8% (95% CI: -1.1% to 24.1%) increase in COVID-19 mortality rate.",

First identified in 2019 in Wuhan, the capital of Hubei Province, China, the COVID-19 pandemic has since rapidly spread globally. As of April 29, 2020, there have been 1,027,799 cases and 58,489 deaths confirmed in the United States 2 . Despite substantial public health efforts, the observed COVID-19 case-fatality rate (i.e. the ratio of the number of COVID-19 deaths over the number of cases) in the US is estimated to be 5.8% 3 . Although knowledge concerning the etiology of COVID-19-related disease has grown since the outbreak was first identified, there is still considerable uncertainty concerning its pathogenesis, as well as factors contributing to heterogeneity in disease severity around the globe. Environmental factors, such as urban air pollution, may play an important role in increasing susceptibility to severe outcomes of COVID-19. The impact of ambient air pollution on excess morbidity and mortality has been well-established over several decades [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] .",

Hence, it is plausible that prolonged exposure to air pollution may have a detrimental effect on the prognosis of patients affected by COVID-19 16 . As is usual in the early literature on emerging hazards, questions remain concerning the generalizability and reproducibility of these finding, due to the lack of control for the epidemic stage-ofdisease, population mobility, residual spatial correlation, and potential confounding by co-pollutants.",

To address these analytical gaps and contribute towards a more complete understanding of the impact of long-term exposures to ambient air pollution on COVID-19-related health consequences, we conducted a nationwide study in the USA (3, 122 counties) examining associations between multiple key ambient air pollutants, NO 2 , PM 2.5 , and O 3 , and COVID-19 case-fatality and mortality rates in both single and multi-pollutant models, with comprehensive covariate adjustment.

In this analysis, the main COVID-19 death outcomes included two measures, the county-level COVID-19 case-fatality rate and mortality rate. The COVID-19 case-fatality rate was calculated by dividing the number of deaths over the number of people diagnosed for each US county with at least 1 or more confirmed case, which can imply the biological susceptibility towards server COVID-19 outcomes (i.e. death). The COVID-19 mortality rate was the number of COVID-19 deaths per million population, and it can reflect the severity of the COVID-19 deaths in the general population.",

These results provide additional initial support for the interpretation that long-term exposure to NO 2 , a component of urban air pollution related to traffic, may enhance susceptibility to severe COVID-19 outcomes. These findings may help identify susceptible and high-risk populations, especially those living in areas with historically high NO 2 pollution, including the metropolitan areas in New York, New Jersey, Colorado, and Michigan. Given the rapid escalation of COVID-19 spread and associated mortality in the US, swift and coordinated public health actions, including strengthened enforcement on social distancing and expanding healthcare capacity, are needed to protect these and the other vulnerable populations. Although average NO 2 concentrations have decreased gradually over the past decades, it is critical to continue enforcing air pollution regulations to protect public health, given that health effects occur even at very low concentrations 8 .",

NO 2 can be emitted directly from combustion sources or produced from the titration of NO with O 3 . NO 2 and nitric oxide (NO) have relatively short atmospheric lifetime, thus having larger spatial heterogeneity compared to more regionally distributed pollutants such as PM 2.5 and O 3 . As a result, the spatial distribution of NO 2 represents the intensity of anthropogenic activity, especially emissions from traffic and power plants. As a reactive free radical, NO 2 plays a key role in photochemical reactions that produce other secondary pollutants, including ozone and secondary particulate matter. In our analysis of three major air pollutants, however, NO 2 showed strong and independent effects with COVID-19 case-fatality rate and mortality, meaning that the effects of NO 2 may not be mediated by PM 2.5 and O 3 . Even so, we cannot rule out the possibility that NO 2 is serving as a proxy for other traffic-related air pollutants, such as soot, trace metals, or ultrafine particles. Long-term exposures to NO 2 have been associated with acute and chronic respiratory diseases, including increased bronchial hyperresponsiveness, .

The impact of long-term exposure to PM 2.5 on excess morbidity and mortality has also been well-established [4] [5] 8 . An early unpublished report that explored the impacts of air pollution on mortality found that 1 \u03bc g/m 3 PM 2.5 was associated with 8% increase in COVID-19 mortality rates in the USA 39 . The study was conducted in a single pollutant model and did not investigate on COVID-19 casefatality rates. In contrast, we found only marginally significant associations between COVID-19 mortality rates and PM 2.5 . Specifically, the magnitude and strength of this association observed in the current analysis were weaker, mainly due to our control of the spatial trends and residual autocorrelation, which may have confounded the previous study findings 34 . In addition, PM 2.5 was not associated with COVID-19 case-fatality rate across all single and multipollutant models, indicating that it may have less impact on biological susceptibility to severe COVID-19 outcomes compared to NO 2 .",

First, the cross-sectional study design reduced our ability to exploit temporal variation and trends in COVID-19 deaths, an important determinant in establishing causal inference. Towards this end, time-series analyses of air pollution and COVID-19 case-fatality rates and corresponding mortality rates will be important; these data will only be available in the future. Second, actual death counts are likely underestimated, particularly during the early stages of the outbreak, with highly dynamic reported fatality rates, increasing from 1.8% to 5.8% in the past two months. However, results using data from only the most recent four weeks were largely unchanged, suggesting that differential errors in reporting or testing for COVID-19 may not have exerted much influence on these findings. Third, although we controlled for many potential confounders such as population density, we cannot rule out the possibility that NO 2 might be a proxy of urbanicity.

We also conducted sensitivity analysis by using air pollution data averaged between 2000 to 2016. To assess the impact of potential bias of individual covariates, we fit models by omitting a different set of covariates for each model iteration while comparing effect estimates. Statistical tests were 2-sidedand statistical significance was determined with an alpha of 0.05. All statistical analyses were conducted used R version 3.4.",

After data acquisition from these sources, we compared the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases and deaths in each US county (identified by the Federal Information Processing Standards, FIPS code) across all databases for accuracy and consistency. In case of discrepancy, countylevel case and death number were corrected by manually checking the data reported from the corresponding state and local health department websites. We calculated county-level COVID-19 casefatality rate by dividing the number of deaths over the number of people diagnosed with COVID-19 for each US county with at least 1 or more confirmed case, as reported by April 29, 2020. Of all the data reported as of April 29, 2020, confirmed cases and deaths with unassigned counties were excluded in the analysis.Air pollution: Three major criteria ambient air pollutants were included in the analysis, including NO 2 , a traffic-related air pollutant and a major component of urban smog, PM 2.5 , and O 3 . We recently estimated daily ambient PM 2.5 , NO 2 , and O 3 levels at 1 km 2 spatial resolution across the contiguous US an ensemble machine learning model with ground measurements, satellite-data products, chemical transport model output, meteorological and land-use information as predictors 22,23 . We calculated the daily average for each county based on all covered 1 km 2 grid cells, and then further calculated the annual mean (2010-2016) for PM 2.5 and NO 2 and the warm-season mean (2010-2016) for O 3 , defined as May 1 to October 31, as surrogates for long-term PM 2.5 , NO 2 , and O 3 exposures, respectively.

The travel distance mobility data were released from the Descartes Labs and mapped by the GeoDS Lab using anonymized location data from smartphones (Warren and Skillman, 2020; Gao et al., 2020). The travel mobility index was a measure to compare the daily individual-level travel distance pattern to that in February. To enhance privacy, individual data are de-identified and aggregated to the county level. We calculated the county-level mean mobility index from March 1, 2020 to April 29, 2020 to represent the dramatic mean human mobility changes in reaction to the COVID-19. County-level socioeconomic status (SES) in 2015 was measured by social deprivation index, which is a composite measure of area-level deprivation based on seven characteristics, including income, education, employment, housing, household characteristics, transportation, and demographics. SDI has commonly served as an area-level composite measure of SES in other studies of health and health outcomes. Countylevel sociodemographic covariates in 2017 such as percentage of elderly (age\u226560) and percentage of male were derived from Area Health Resource Files, and population density was derived from the 2018 US Census.
