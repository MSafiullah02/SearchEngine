            "text": "The SARS-CoV epidemic of 2003 is a prime example of how quickly an emerging infectious disease can spread. When reviewing pediatric data available from this epidemic, which occurred from November 2002 through July 2003, the factors most strongly associated with pediatric infections included close contact with adult SARS-CoV patients [1]. In a study looking at pediatric SARS-CoV patients in Toronto, Canada between February and June 2003, SARS-CoV was found to be a relatively mild illness in previously healthy children, resulting in only mild respiratory symptoms, supported in other published reports from pediatric patients from Hong Kong [1\u20133]. While there were serious diagnostic limitations to these studies, including the lack of serologic data and true confirmation of positive cases, data from all available pediatric studies suggest the majority of pediatric cases had contact with infected adults, resulting in less severe clinical courses in younger patients (<12 years of age) as compared to teenagers and adult patients, many of whom required mechanical ventilation. SARS-CoV case fatality rate in pediatric patients was estimated to be <1% in patients less than 25 years of age, compared to a case fatality rate of >50% in patients >65 years of age [4].",

            "text": "MERS-CoV is a more recently described coronavirus, and while similar to SARS-CoV, presents with more severe clinical symptoms [5]. First isolated in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in 2012 from a Saudi businessman who died of pneumonia [6], this respiratory disease has remained primarily isolated to the Arabian Peninsula, with the exception of one significant outbreak in South Korea in 2015 [7]. Isolated from infected camels with confirmed camel-to-human transmission, the exact mode of transmission remains undetermined. Similar to SARS-CoV, hospital acquired infections play an important role in the spread of the virus [5, 8]. Interestingly, a large MERS-CoV outbreak occurred in South Korea in 2015 resulting from the exposure to a single infected patient in a crowded emergency room, resulting in MERS-CoV infections in 82 individuals (33 patients, 8 healthcare staff, and 41 visitors), highlighting the need for improved preparedness in early identification and isolation of patients with highly hazardous communicable diseases [8]. Much like with SARS-CoV, pediatric data are limited, as MERS-CoV is primarily a disease seen in the adult population. Of reported pediatric cases, MERS-CoV infections in previously healthy children typically result in non-specific clinical symptoms including fever, cough, shortness of breath and breathing difficulties, and pneumonia, which can progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome and subsequent multi-organ failure [9\u201312]. From June 2012 through April 2016, only 31 cases (2 known fatalities) of children with MERS-CoV were reported in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, compared to a total of 1561 adult cases of MERS-CoV, with 633 fatalities from June 2012 through February 2017. Of the children with more severe symptoms who progressed to death, both had pre-existing conditions (cystic fibrosis and nephrotic syndrome) [10]. Due to non-specific clinical symptoms of both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV which are similar to other common respiratory pathogens including influenza and Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV), a travel and family history is critical in identifying and isolating these patients rapidly upon arrival to any emergency center or primary care setting for proper diagnosis and treatment [13, 14].",

Preparedness efforts are therefore time-consuming, costly, and challenging, but potential solutions exist [18]. Travel screening at all points of entry is critical. High-risk travel screening in busy pediatric institutions is a difficult but an essential part of identifying patients with potential HHCDs and properly isolating those patients to limit the spread of disease.

While caring for any critically ill child carries specific challenges, the added burden of doing so under the unique stressors of special isolation can be overwhelming, and special attention should be spent on building guidelines and screening tools to ensure that the right team is chosen to care for these special patients and that the proper support is available for the team. In training specialized care teams to care for these children, each institution must decide whether to do this based on the recruitment of volunteers only or if this training is to be mandatory, particularly for staff working in high-risk areas including the emergency center and pediatric intensive care unit. While critical care skills are ideal in the recruitment of these \u201c special response teams,\u201d a varied skill set ranging from acute care nurses to ICU nurses, as well as physicians with varied backgrounds, should be considered. Individuals should be carefully screened for behavioral components key to performing well on such a highly specialized team, including the ability to work well with others, self-control, and the ability to remain calm under pressure. In dealing with critically ill children, a pediatric care providers\u2019 first instinct is to sacrifice self for patient, and this cannot be the case in a caring for a child with a HHCD. The ability to follow strict orders to ensure team safety is key combined with the ability to troubleshoot and think creatively in situations likely never before faced when caring for children. Additionally, members chosen for these specialized teams should undergo full health screens, including potentially fitness and agility testing, as working in personal protective equipment for prolonged periods in environments of high-stress can be incredibly taxing. Human resources should be involved in creating employee policies including sequestration or home monitoring, furlough, pay and benefits, housing for providers, housing for infected employees, food, childcare, and emotional and spiritual support. These actions and policies provide reassurance, a sense of safety, and reduce employee stress. Health and wellness programs and employee assistance programs offering counseling and employee heath teams should be incorporated in the support staff available for all team members of a special response team. Caring for children admitted with HHCDs, potentially in pandemic situations, is likely to cause great amounts of stress, and being able to combat stress and teach caregivers how to manage it is of highest priority in maintaining a healthy team [20].",

It is the policy at this institution that parents and family will not be allowed into the unit but are provided with a private family room for respite, where videoconferencing is available. These decisions should be made in consultation with a team including infectious disease experts, state and/or local public health authorities, risk management, and the clinical care staff who will be involved in caring for the child. Additionally, if the decision is made to allow family visitation, this should be closely observed. The ability of families to follow instructions, including appropriate donning and doffing of personal protective equipment, should be carefully considered and may require a case-by-case evaluation. The impact of family visitation must also be balanced with the risk this may bring to staff members caring for the patient. While it is difficult enough to care for a child with a HHCD in full personal protective equipment (PPE) , adding family members to the room increases the responsibility of staff to care for and monitor not only the patient, but the family member in addition. It is also important to note that competency in PPE takes practice and suggested quarterly training, and it may be unrealistic to expect family members to be able to don and doff safely without the risk of contamination. Lastly, the decision to allow families to visit children in strict isolation may differ from pathogen to pathogen. The visitation guidelines which apply to a child diagnosed with Ebola virus may differ from those diagnosed with respiratory viruses, such as MERS-CoV.",

This includes first and foremost offering support, including social work, child life, and chaplain services. Creating \u201cmemory tokens\u201d may be useful, though careful consideration must be paid to which items these could be, as only materials which can be successfully autoclaved can be removed from the biocontainment area in cases such as viral hemorrhagic fevers [21]. Photographs and video may assist in helping the family say goodbye, as well as providing items of comfort (e.g., a favorite toy). In the case of some pathogens, such as Ebola virus , it may not be feasible to return these items, and this should be discussed with the family in advance. As with all pediatric end-of-life care, honest and open communication is essential to this process along with allowing the family to grieve, even if isolated from their child.

Also important in the design of the unit was the ability for parents and families to be able to communicate with their children; therefore cameras were installed to allow family members to observe the room from a dedicated family room, located outside of the unit, when staff feels it is appropriate to do so. Additionally, rooms were built with high visibility so that medical staff could observe both the patient and the staff caring for the child easily from the outside.
