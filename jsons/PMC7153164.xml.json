            "text": "Aging has long been considered as a major socioeconomic problem. It leads to consecutive worsening of the overall organismal health, which in turn results in steady increase of public expenses in medical and social fields (Upadhya et al. 2015; Rolf 2015). The mere fact that the overall life expectancy is steadily increasing and that almost all human populations are characterized by a growing number of elderly people turns this problem into a huge burden (Guerrero et al. 2015; McKenzie et al. 2015). Hence, it is of utmost importance for all governments to assure healthy aging of its elderly people which sounds as an impossible task without full comprehension of the general mechanisms of aging. The last has been a challenge for scientists in the field of gerontology for many years, even for decades. And this is not surprising at all. Aging is a complex biological process which leads to loss of functional reserve of multiple organ systems and to increased susceptibility to stress and age-associated maladies like cancer, neurodegenerative diseases, diabetes, etc. It is also associated with increased incidence of genetic mutations and prevalence of chronic diseases which finally lead to functional dependence and an inadequate life (Campisi 2000; Miquel 2014). Determined by a combination of genetic and environmental factors, the process of getting old is highly individualized and yet poorly understood. Extensive studies are under way with the main emphasis being set on elucidation of the intimate molecular mechanisms of the aging process.",

            "text": "Recently, some researchers in the field of aging (L\u00f3pez-Ot\u00edn et al. 2013) have been able to shortlist the nine most common hallmarks of the aging process and denoted them as major. These nine major hallmarks include genomic instability, telomere attrition, epigenetic alterations, loss of proteostasis, deregulated nutrient sensing, mitochondrial dysfunction, cellular senescence, stem cell exhaustion, and altered intercellular communication. Deep understanding of these common aging features could be a major step toward development and application of specific pharmaceutical approaches, the aim of which would be to ameliorate, slow, and successfully manipulate the process of getting old. Of course, scientists in the field are far from getting involved in the search for the elixir for eternal life, but do endeavor to spend lots of efforts in order to get a clearer picture of the most intimate mechanisms of aging. The task could be very hard because these well classified hallmarks of aging seem interdependent making studies in the field even more complicated. For example, DNA damage could lead to genomic instability but could be a consequence of it. Many factors, some extrinsic like UV irradiation, chemicals, and genotoxins, and others, intrinsic like ROS (reactive oxygen species) production, account for DNA damage and are one of the main culprits for the aging of the cells and the organism (Garinis et al. 2008). The picture gets even more complicated since the metabolic stress that all cells undergo could be the primary cause for increased ROS production. Apparently following this line we enter in the vicious circle of trying to understand who is who and what is the cause and what the consequence of aging. No doubt, therefore, that the complexity of aging is considered as \u201cone of the major stumbling blocks of all biological investigations of aging\u201d (Martin 2005).",

            "text": "Each of the 60 trillion cells that make up the human body (with some minor exceptions like the human erythrocytes) contains 2 m of genomic DNA in its nucleus. This is quite a huge amount of genetic material that has to be packed and organized in the confined space of the cell nucleus (Fig. 2.1). The organization of DNA and, importantly, its proper functioning recently turned into one of the most interesting puzzles in biology. Two important issues have to be solved by the cells. The first is about the way the genomic DNA is packaged to fit the limited space in the cell nucleus which is only 10 \u03bcm in diameter, and the second question is about the way DNA works in this very compacted state. As a matter of fact almost all articles regarding chromatin, epigenetics, and DNA start with one and the same sentence, and it goes like that: \u201cDNA is not naked in the cells but is organized together with histone proteins in chromatin.\u201d Indeed chromatin is the platform where DNA meets histones\u2014the last are considered to be at the heart of DNA compaction, its regulation, and dynamics (Hayes et al. 1990; Littau et al. 1965; Wolffe 1998). Together with it they build the nucleosomes. Each nucleosome consists of two molecules of each of the four core histones (H2A, H2B, H3, and H4), around which 147 bp of DNA are wrapped together. The nucleosome represents the basic repeat unit of chromatin (Richmond et al. 1984; Luger et al. 1997). It is widely accepted that this is the first level of chromatin compaction. By a physical point of view, the nucleosome represents an obstacle to all processes that require access to the molecule of DNA.\n",

            "text": "Therefore, chromatin has to be modified, reorganized, and de-compacted in order DNA to be transcribed, replicated, and repaired. This process of chromatin reorganization is done by specialized enzyme complexes, called chromatin modifying and chromatin remodeling complexes, which can chemically modify histones and can slide nucleosomes along the molecule of DNA. Nucleosomes are not only basic units of chromatin compaction but also exert important regulatory functions and manipulate the activity of the genome. They form nucleosome arrays, which in relation to the electron microscopic images have poetically been called the \u201cbeads-on-a-string\u201d structure (Thoma and Koller 1977; Rattner et al. 1982). The diameter of this structure is approximately 11 nm and represents the second level of chromatin compaction. Regarding the size of the eukaryotic genome, it is obvious that this level of compaction is quite insufficient for stuffing DNA in the nucleus. It has been further shown that chromatin additionally compacts and forms 30 nm in diameter fibers (Robinson and Rhodes 2006). Such folding of the nucleosome arrays into a compact filament with a diameter of about 30 nm in a salt-dependent manner was reported in numerous in vitro studies (Finch and Klug 1976; Thoma et al. 1979; Widom and Klug 1985; Huynh et al. 2005; Robinson et al. 2006). Evidence for the presence of the 30 nm chromatin fiber in nuclei has also been provided from X-ray diffraction and electron microscopy analyses (Langmore and Schutt 1980; Andersson et al. 1982; Marsden and Laemmli 1979). 30 nm \u201cfiber-like\u201d structures were detected when chromatin fragments were released from human cell nuclei and were also visualized by atomic force microscopy of reconstituted chromatin and of chromatin fragments from yeast nuclei (Georgieva et al. 2012, 2015; Prieto et al. 2012; Gilbert et al. 2004).",

            "text": "However, in contrast to the nucleosome structure, which is relatively well understood, the detailed organization of these 30-nm diameter rod-like structures is considered as quite controversial. Recently, their existence in vivo has been questioned thus opening ardent discussions of how exactly chromatin is structured above the 11-nm chromatin filaments (Fussner et al. 2012; Maeshima et al. 2014). The dispute probably has been induced by the different methodologies exploited for studying of this particular level of chromatin organization. It is true that some of the most meaningful results on this structure were obtained by in vitro experiments (Robinson et al. 2008; Robinson and Rhodes 2006; Routh et al. 2008). Though, for more than four decades, lots of data were obtained by both in vivo and in vitro experiments favoring the existence of the 30 nm chromatin fibers. Interestingly, the obtained results have proposed the existence of at least two different rod-like fibers in the nuclei of eukaryotes: the first with a diameter of 30 nm (the so-called \u201cone-start model\u201d) and the second with a diameter of 24\u201326 nm (the \u201ctwo-start model\u201d), both, as noted by Grigoryev and coworkers (2009) able to appear consecutively in a single fiber. Importantly, in a critical review by Ghirlando and Felsenfeld (2013), it was stated that the 30 nm fiber is not an indicator of the transcriptional status of chromatin but rather represents a structurally more compacted state of organization.",

However, the findings from live microscopy and other experiments that enable tracking of chromatin dynamics in vivo have revealed large-scale chromatin motions and have proved the functional significance of these motions for the cells and the organism (Gasser 2002; Chuang et al. 2006). Three principle types of chromatin motion were recognized and were accepted as general. Interestingly, the three appeared quite different in time scale, range, and frequency of the movements as well as in energy dependence (Soutoglou and Misteli 2007). Moreover, it has been shown that these chromatin spatial rearrangements influence cellular fate and aging of the organisms (Chandra et al. 2015).\n",

According to the conventional view of the three-dimensional (3D) genome organization within the nucleus, heterochromatin preferentially localizes at the nuclear periphery, whereas euchromatin preferentially resides in the nuclear interior. A remarkable exception of this conventional nuclear architecture is the inverted chromatin organization in photoreceptor cells of the nocturnal mammalian eye. Using FISH, some authors were able to characterize in detail the higher-order chromatin dynamics during terminal differentiation of rod cells of mouse retinas (Solovei et al. 2009). Interestingly, at birth rod nuclei have a conventional architecture, but postnatal differentiation of rod cells is accompanied with global spatial movement of higher-order chromatin structures and with the establishment of the so-called \u201cinverted\u201d nuclear organization.",

This dynamics assures both accurate expression of the genetic information as well as promises genomic stability. For example, in the time course of the cell cycle, from mitosis through interphase up to the next mitosis, chromatin undergoes global structural reorganization\u2014from fully condensed mitotic chromosomes through less condensed, more diffused interphase chromatin conformation and then again to compacted chromosome entities. In order to meet the requirements of DNA-related processes, chromatin is not expected to be steadily and uniformly compacted across the genome in vivo, but to be dynamically modulated by local differences in chromatin components including numerous architectural and regulatory proteins as well as complex combinations (cross-talks) among diverse set of epigenetic modifications. No doubt that the regulation of chromatin dynamics comes through a variety of mechanisms including DNA methylation (Karymov et al. 2001; Ma et al. 2005), posttranslational modifications (PTMs) of histones (Ito 2007; Gelato and Fischle 2008), histone variants (Happel and Doenecke 2009; Clausell et al. 2009), recruitment of chromatin remodeling complexes (Corona et al. 2007; Clapier and Cairns 2009), and noncoding RNAs (Li 2014; Dhanasekaran et al. 2013). All these epigenetic regulators act in concert to exert the complex mechanisms that modulate chromatin conformation which in turn regulates gene expression in development, differentiation, aging, and disease. For example, these epigenetic marks as well as the level of chromatin condensation are distinct between normally proliferating, cancerous, and senescent cells (Oh et al. 2013; Rodriguez-Paredes and Esteller 2011).",

            "text": "As we have already discussed, the nature of chromatin is very contradictory. At one hand, it is regarded as a static unit that guards the genome and protects the genetic material against DNA damage. On the other hand, chromatin appears quite dynamic. It \u201cbreaths in\u201d and \u201cout\u201d with the surrounding environment and thus allows the cells to adapt by changing the expression of certain genes. In some cases, this dynamic property appears to counter the aging process and to extend organismal lifespan (Longo and Kennedy 2006; Gotta et al. 1997; Kennedy et al. 1997). However, the stochastic component of chromatin structure might also contribute to the breakdown of nuclear, cellular, and tissue functions and consequently to lead to aging and age-associated diseases (Lazarus et al. 2013; Sedivy et al. 2008). Generally, aging involves major changes in chromatin structure and organization (Zane et al. 2014; Pegoraro and Misteli 2009; Mu\u00f1oz-Najar and Sedivy 2011). It has long been believed that during aging, nuclei show loss of heterochromatin (Ishimi et al. 1987). Global changes in chromatin organization have been found to be associated with aging including the formation of senescence-associated heterochromatin foci (SAHF) in euchromatic DNA and a gradual loss of perinuclear heterochromatin (Oberdoerffer and Sinclair 2007). Deterioration of chromatin organization triggers in turn transcriptional alterations, accumulation of DNA damage, and increased genomic instability (Pegoraro and Misteli 2009; Feser and Tyler 2011; O\u2019Sullivan and Karlseder 2012).",

It has been speculated that these SAHF silence proliferation-promoting genes and thus lead to senescence-associated phenotypes (Corpet and Stucki 2014). Remarkably, although SAHF appear to result from the condensation of almost entire chromosomes, DNA sequences that are typically contained in constitutive heterochromatin, such as pericentromeres and telomeres, actually appear to be excluded from the bulk of the condensed chromosomes (Zhang et al. 2009a; Narita et al. 2003). This was further proven by other authors who have shown that the shortened telomeres in mice lacking telomerase have reduced heterochromatin compared to telomeres from normal cells (Benetti et al. 2007a). The molecular mechanism of SAHF formation remains poorly understood although histone chaperones Asf1a and HIRA have been reported to play a role in their formation (Zhang et al. 2005). Other authors have even suggested that SAHF are a novel type of chromatin condensation involving alterations in the way by which DNA interacts with its binding proteins (Funayama et al. 2006).",

            "text": "Recently, some interesting dynamics of DNA methylation during aging have been explored (Zane et al. 2014; Mu\u00f1oz-Najar and Sedivy 2011; Lazarus et al. 2013). It has been demonstrated that there is a consistent reduction in global DNA methylation during aging (Singhal et al. 1987; Wilson et al. 1987) while at certain places, namely the CpG islands of gene promoters, DNA methylation is increased with age (Kim et al. 2005). In general, global DNA demethylation in aging occurs mainly at repetitive DNA elements and in genomic regions with facultative heterochromatin which leads to overall deheterochromatinization of the genome (Sedivy et al. 2008). In contrast, hypermethylation of CGIs (CpG islands) is found mainly at promoters of stem cells\u2019 genes and also at promoters of tumor suppressor genes (Issa et al. 2001; Waki et al. 2003). Both epigenetic phenomena explain two of the hallmarks of aging (L\u00f3pez-Ot\u00edn et al. 2013): the observed exhaustion of stem cells during aging and the higher incidence of cancer with the advancement of age. The first is due to increased methylation at the promoters of stem cells genes, especially those responsible for their pluripotency, while the second results from the aberrant hypermethylation of promoters of tumor suppressor genes. Interestingly, it has been observed that there is an increase in 5-methylcytosines within the ribosomal DNA (rDNA) clusters in livers of old rats, which could explain the decrease in ribosomal RNA (rRNA) levels that also occurs during aging (Oakes et al. 2003). And though DNA methylation patterns at first sight seem quite contradictory, there is logic for exploiting it as an aging marker.",

            "text": "Advanced age is always associated with increased risk for cancer. On the other hand, epigenetic alterations are hallmarks of both aging and cancer. Therefore, it is normal to assume that aging-associated DNA methylation changes actively contribute to cancer susceptibility and growth (Fraga et al. 2007). No doubt that both processes (aging and cancer) share almost the same DNA methylation marks. Table 2.1 summarizes the plethora of data concerning the role of DNA methylation in aging, cancer, and premature aging syndromes. What catches the attention immediately is the fact that most DNA patterns are shared among different cases. For example, global DNA hypomethylation of repeat-rich regions is observed in numerous cancers (Ehrlich 2009). DNA hypomethylation of repeat elements has been proposed to contribute to cellular transformation by promoting chromosomal rearrangements and elevating mutational rate. Apart from hypomethylation of repeat elements, loss of methylation from genic regions also causes aberrant gene expression and promotes tumorigenesis (Zane et al. 2014). In addition, promoters of genes that are targets of hypermethylation during aging overlap with DNA hypermethylated genes in many cancers (McGarvey et al. 2008). For example, aberrant hypermethylation at promoters of CDKN2A, LOX, RUNX3, and TIG1, which act as tumor suppressor genes, has been detected during aging (Yanagawa et al. 2007; So et al. 2006a, b) and was further accepted as a strong evidence that there is age-dependent onset of different types of cancer.\n",

CLS is defined as the time a cell survives in a nondividing state, with survival being measured as cell wall integrity or as ability to form a colony.

            "text": "In these cells, inactivation of the histone deacetylase, Sir2, has led to shortened replicative lifespan (Kennedy et al. 1997). Conversely, activation of Sir2 extended lifespan. This phenomenon could be well apprehended if the logic behind the molecular mechanisms is explained in detail. The anti-aging effect of Sir2 in yeast was, at least in part, due to the translocation of a Sir2-containing protein complex from telomeres to ribosomal DNA (rDNA) repeats. These repeats are prone to recombination and form extrachromosomal rDNA circles (ERCs), which by complicated mechanisms shorten yeast lifespan. At the rDNA repeats, Sir2-mediated histone deacetylation, and consequent heterochromatinization by the Sir2-associated proteins (Sir3 and Sir4), prevents recombination and formation of ERCs, thereby extending lifespan (Kaeberlein et al. 2007; Kennedy et al. 1997). Notably, orthologs of Sir2 have been shown to possess strong anti-aging functions in many other species, including nematodes, flies, and human (Herskovits and Guarente 2014; Guarente 2013). In particular, transgenic overexpression of mammalian SIRT1 (the closest homolog to invertebrate Sir2) improves aspects of health during aging but does not increase longevity in mice (Herranz and Serrano 2010). The mechanisms of the beneficial effects of SIRT1 are complex and interconnected, including improved genomic stability that prevents the genome against fast aging.",

            "text": "Another epigenetic mark that turned out to be firmly connected to aging is the acetylation of histones. Histone acetylation and deacetylation seem quite important epigenetic modifications throughout the whole organismal lifespan. For example, increased global levels of H4K16ac were detected in old cells. Higher levels of H4K16ac have been demonstrated also at specific regions of the genome of old cells, for example, at the X core and X elements within the telomeric regions (Dang et al. 2009). A correlation between the increased levels of H4K16ac with age and a decreased silencing of reporter genes inserted at these telomere proximal DNA elements was also reported in this chapter (Dang et al. 2009). It has been discussed that the increased levels of H4K16ac in old cells lead to a more open chromatin structure. The N-terminal tail of H4 is a crucial player in the formation of a fully compacted 30 nm chromatin fiber (Dorigo et al. 2003; Robinson et al. 2008). Therefore, it is not surprising that increased H4K16ac is accepted determinative for the more open state of chromatin and for the genome instability observed in aged cells. Interestingly, this specific epigenetic modification has been linked to the linker histone H1, one of the factors responsible for genome stability (Downs and Cote 2005; Downs et al. 2003; Georgieva et al. 2012). It was shown recently that loss of the tumour suppressor protein phosphatase PTEN leads to dissociation of histone H1 from chromatin, elevation of histone H4 acetylation at lysine 16, and decompaction of chromatin (Chen et al. 2014b).",

            "text": "Linker histones are important structural proteins of chromatin. They bind to DNA at its nucleosome entry/exit sites and are involved in the formation and maintenance of higher-order chromatin structure. Studies on H1 mobility in different cell types exposed to various treatments have suggested that modulation of H1-chromatin interactions are one of the earliest events leading to changes in the structure of the chromatin fiber (Catez et al. 2006). Represented by 11 subtypes in higher eukaryotes which are cell and tissue-specific, it is not surprising that linker histones have long been a challenge for scientists. Importantly, it is proven that these histones are essential for development. The reduction of H1 content with 50 % led to severe embryonic defects and finally to death in mice (Fan et al. 2005). Moreover, recently it has been shown that the levels of H1, especially of H1c (one of the subtypes of H1 family), are crucial for the process of terminal differentiation of retina rod cells which requires global reorganization of chromatin and concentration of heterochromatin in the nuclear center (Popova et al. 2013). As already has been discussed in the previous sections, the linker histone H1 is linked to aging. Its loss during senescence is associated with the formation of SAHF (Funayama et al. 2006). As was mentioned, studies on linker histones in higher eukaryotes are impeded by the fact that higher eukaryotes have many subtypes of H1 and some of them are replaceable, i.e., they can be exchanged by other subtypes of linker histones. We have summarized the best known changes in linker and core histones together with other structural chromatin proteins in Table 2.3 during aging, cancer, and HGPS. What is easily seen and very well expressed is the link among these changes in the three discussed states of the organism: the process of getting old, the process of malignization, and the detrimental premature aging features of HGPS. Knowing these changes is a prerequisite for all steps toward successful managing of them. For this, we need model organisms that could offer the most relevant platform for these studies.\n",

The first discovery was that individual chromosomes occupy discrete domains in the interphase nucleus\u2014named chromosome territories (Tark-Dame et al. 2011; Cremer and Cremer 2006). This finding raised a lot of discussions in the field of chromatin biology and induced further investigations which led to the observation that the mammalian interphase chromosomes are made up of a large number of structural loops, each of which is on average ~1 Mb, that correspond to DNA replication units (Ryba et al. 2010). Generally, chromatin loops are accepted as an important aspect of chromatin organization. They represent the so-called higher-order chromatin structures and demonstrate high dynamics during aging and development. They bring together distant regulatory elements that control gene expression, such as promoters and enhancers (Kadauke and Blobel 2009), and thus control cellular destiny. For instance, enhancers, insulators, and locus control regions can lie at distances from several kb up to one Mb or more away from the genes they regulate and may be located in cis (upstream or downstream) or in trans (on a different chromosome) (Woodcock 2006).",

Figure 2.2 brilliantly illustrates the dynamics in chromatin loop organization during normal development, aging, and some premature aging syndromes. The notion that chromatin loops are important for the overall genome organization is also supported by recent studies in yeast showing that the linker histone is important for the maintenance of bulk chromatin loop organization (Georgieva et al. 2012).",

This proves that the yeast linker histone, Hho1p, is involved in the global chromatin compaction, loop formation, and probably in the organization of loop attachment sites. Interestingly, this compaction proved to be also important for the normal aging of these cells as further experiments in following the chronological lifespan of the mutants have demonstrated that the absence of the linker histone leads to features resembling premature aging phenotypes (Uzunova et al. 2013), thus strengthening the idea that chromatin higher-order organization is a prerequisite for cellular normality.",

Nuclear lamina has crucial role in a plethora of cellular events, in particular it maintains nuclear shape and provides sites for peripheral heterochromatin binding (Goldman et al. 2002). Being key structural proteins of the nucleus, lamins play important roles in epigenetics, chromatin organization, DNA replication, regulation of gene expression, and DNA repair, cell proliferation, and differentiation as well as in viral infections (Dechat et al. 2008; Goldman et al. 2002). At present, over 100 mutations in LMNA gene has been reported causing more than 15 distinct diseases designated as laminopathies (Hegele 2005).",

This dominant negative isoform of lamin A is referred to as progerin (De Sandre-Giovannoli et al. 2003; Eriksson et al. 2003). In HGPS cells, expression of progerin interferes with lamin A that in turn abrogates nuclear lamina functionality and brings numerous phenotypes, including epigenetic alterations, disorganization of chromatin, abnormal nuclear morphology (Scaffidi and Misteli 2006; Gordon et al. 2014; Kudlow et al. 2007; Dechat et al. 2008; Schreiber and Kennedy 2013). Some of these epigenetic alterations are shortlisted in Tables 2.1, 2.2, and 2.3, where one can find interesting data about DNA methylation, PTMs of histones, and the level of expression of histone proteins in aging, cancer, and HGPS.",

Silencing of inactivated X is provided by H3K27me3 and Xist RNA (Kohlmaier et al. 2004). EZH2 ( enhancer of zeste homolog) methyltransferase is a subunit of the Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) that has an essential role in the epigenetic maintenance of repressive chromatin states through trimethylation of H3K27 (Margueron et al. 2009). In contrast, in fibroblast cells from a female HGPS patient, the H3K27me3 mark is lost on the inactive X chromosome with a concomitant downregulation of EZH2 which leads to some decondensation of this chromosome (Shumaker et al. 2006). Importantly, the alterations in chromatin regulation precede the nuclear shape changes (Shumaker et al. 2006) pointing out the pivotal role of chromatin in pathological premature aging.",

In particular, gene-poor regions of HGPS fibroblasts experience a reduction of H3K27me3 compared with the control (McCord et al. 2013). As in previous reports, loss of H3K27me3 in HGPS was associated with downregulation of EZH2 since the mRNA level of EZH2 was significantly reduced in four HGPS fibroblast cell lines compared to normal control samples (McCord et al. 2013; Shumaker et al. 2006; Margueron et al. 2009). Genome-wide analyses revealed a correlation between alterations in patterns of H3K27me3 deposition, genome organization, and DNA-lamin A/C interactions in HGPS skin fibroblasts (McCord et al. 2013). Based on this, authors proposed a model in which accumulation of progerin in the nuclear lamina leads to reduction in the repressive histone mark H3K27me3 in heterochromatin (most possibly through the downregulation of EZH2) and disrupts interactions between heterochromatin and nuclear lamina. These changes may then result in transcriptional misregulation and global loss of spatial chromatin compartmentalization (McCord et al. 2013). In addition, downregulation of the constitutive heterochromatin mark H3K9me3 and loss of pericentric heterochromatin were detected in HGPS cells (Scaffidi and Misteli 2006; Shumaker et al. 2006; Pegoraro and Misteli 2009). The loss of heterochromatinization of pericentric regions induces transcription of pericentromeric satellite III repeats (Shumaker et al. 2006).",

Several lines of evidence argue that the disruption of heterochromatin structure in progeria syndrome can be attributed to deregulation of the Nucleosome Remodeling and Deacetylation (NuRD) complex (Pegoraro et al. 2009). NuRD is a ubiquitous ATP-ase-dependent chromatin remodeling complex that has been shown to associate with pericentromeric heterochromatin and to maintain transcriptional repression at specific promoters (Bowen et al. 2004; Helbling Chadwick et al. 2009). NuRD is a multicomponent complex, containing the histone deacetylases HDAC1 and HDAC2, histone-binding proteins RBBP4 and RBBP7, metastasis-associated protein MTA3, the ATPases CHD3 and CHD4 (chromodomain-helicase-DNA-binding protein) as subunits (Zhang et al. 1999). Besides NuRD, histone chaperone proteins RBBP4 and RBBP7 are shared components of Polycomb PRC2 complex involved in the establishment of heterochromatin (Kuzmichev et al. 2002), and RBBP4 is also a subunit of the CAF-1 complex, which assembles chromatin upon DNA replication and DNA damage repair (Verreault et al. 1996).",

Therefore, the accumulation of progerin in HGPS cells abolishes this interaction that consequently affects the proper chromatin remodeling which in turn triggers deregulation of cellular functions. Further, protein levels of several NuRD components including MTA3, RBBP4, and RBBP7 as well as the HDAC1 amount and activity are reduced in HGPS cells and normal cells expressing exogenous progerin (Pegoraro et al. 2009). The observation that shRNA-mediated silencing of HDAC1, MTA3, CHD3, or CHD4 in normal cells was sufficient to recapitulate age-dependent chromatin defects, e.g., loss of H3K9me3 and HP1\u03b3 heterochromatin foci, heterochromatin deregulation, and increased DNA damage, indicates the importance of NuRD in aging-associated chromatin defects (Pegoraro et al. 2009). Moreover, the loss of RBBP4, RBBP7, and HDAC1 subunits of NuRD is not limited to premature aging, but reduced levels of these proteins are also a feature of normally aged cells (Pegoraro et al. 2009).",

Telomere attrition is one out of the numerous hallmarks of aging in mammals (Cao et al. 2011; L\u00f3pez-Ot\u00edn et al. 2013). Accelerated telomere shortening has also been observed in fibroblasts from HGPS individuals (Huang et al. 2008; Decker et al. 2009). Notably, ectopic expression of progerin in normal fibroblasts recapitulates the faster telomere shortening (Decker et al. 2009). Normally, telomeres and subtelomeric regions are enriched in the H3K9me3 and H4K20me3, epigenetic marks that are characteristic of constitutive heterochromatin (Blasco 2007), and the decrease in H4K20me3 has been associated with telomere elongation (Benetti et al. 2007b). Changes in these histone modifications, namely decrease in H3K9me3 and the increase in H4K20me3 (Shumaker et al. 2006) could account for the enhanced telomere attrition in HGPS cells.",

The most characteristic feature of AD is cognitive impairment that together with neuropathological changes, extracellular amyloid plaques, intracellular neurofibrillary tangles and loss of synapses and neurons are similar in the early-onset and late-onset forms of the disease. Both forms the early- and late-onset of AD have genetic components. Mutations in three genes identified in the early-onset familial form, i.e., amyloid precursor protein (APP), presenilin-1, and presenilin-2, established the central role of amyloid in the disease. However, it should be noted that mutations in these genes are present in only 13 % of patients with the early-onset form of the disease. The technological advances, such as large-scale genome-wide association studies, have led to identification of more than ten risk genes for the late-onset form of AD (Bettens et al. 2013).",

Phosphorylation of histone H3, a key step in the activation of the mitotic machinery, is increased to a hyperphosphorylated state in AD hippocampal neurons. A nonnuclear form of histone H1 appears to be upregulated in astrocytes and neurons in brain regions that are rich in AD pathology.

Why aging should be a risk factor for AD (and other age-related disorders), however, is not well understood, particularly at a mechanistic level. Progressive age-related decline in total methylcytosine has been reported in various organisms. It has been speculated that progressive, age-related, genome-wide hypomethylation may be due to parallel DNMT1 deficits. Age-dependent increase in S-adenosyl-homocysteine (SAH) relative to SAM might also play a role (Mastroeni et al. 2011). Age-dependent hypomethylation of a number of specific genes related to AD has been reported. For example, methylation of cytosines in the APP promoter, particularly GC-rich elements from approximately \u2212270 to \u2212182 bp, is significantly lower in autopsy cases of 70 years old individuals compared to cases with much younger individuals (Mastroeni et al. 2011). These age-related modifications on DNA methylation alter APP expression and consequently can affect the progressive A\u03b2 deposition with aging in the brain (Tohgi et al. 1999).",

Some authors postulate that change in gene transcription exerts a modulating effect on the central nervous system (CNS) and pathophysiology of neurodegenerative diseases. Epigenetic linkage in neurodegenerative diseases is yet inconclusive and more data are needed; however, there is evidence showing the role of DNA methylation in PD and the role of chromatin remodeling in the persisting effects of dopamine on brain function.

In the metabolism of methylation reactions, folate is converted into l-methylfolate (l-MTHF) by the enzyme dihydrofolate (DHF) reductase in order to be absorbed by the intestine. The next step is the association of l-MTHF with Hcy and methionine synthetase producing methionine. Methionine is converted to -adenosylmethionine (SAM) and through the joint action of methyltransferases the product S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH) is formed from which subsequently Hcy is generated. The generated Hcy reenters the methylation cycle and serves for generating methyl groups required for methylation reactions on DNA CpG islands or onto the lysine and arginine residues of histone proteins. Increased concentrations of plasma total Hcy have been reported in patients with PD; this effects the SAM/SAH ratio by increasing SAH and decreasing SAM, leading to an overall decrease in methylation potential (Blandini et al. 2001). Better cognitive functions were associated with increased SAM/SAH ratio in patients with PD. This suggests a possible role of methylation in neurodegenerative disorders like PD (Obeid et al. 2009). There are several studies that submit evidence proving the central role of histone modification in neurotoxicity and thus the role of epigenetics in it.",

Viruses that enter and persist in the nucleus must, therefore, contend with the forces that drive chromatin formation and regulate chromatin structure (Lieberman 2006; Robertson 2005). The complex and dynamic properties of nuclear chromatin present a formidable challenge to viral gene expression and genome propagation. Recently, a wealth of information has been uncovered regarding the structure, function, and regulation of chromatin during complex cellular processes such as differentiation, recombination, aging, and carcinogenesis. Recent studies have also revealed that chromatin has a major role in the life cycle of many viruses, and that viruses have coevolved with numerous strategies for modulating chromatin-related processes (Lieberman 2006). The genomes of many DNA viruses persist for considerable lengths of time in the host-cell nucleus. The small DNA tumor viruses such as simian virus 40 (SV40) and polyoma virus are assembled into nucleosomal minichromosomes during the DNA replication process. Because these viruses use cellular replication enzymes, it is thought that the viral minichromosomes are assembled through a mechanism that is indistinguishable from nucleosome assembly on replicating cellular chromosomes (Lieberman 2006).",

One major difference is that the double stranded DNA genome is synthesized by virion-associated reverse transcriptase in the cytoplasm. The newly synthesized cytoplasmic DNA forms a pre-integration complex (PIC) that consists of viral and cellular proteins (Suzuki and Craigie 2007). Entry into the nucleus is cell cycle dependent and utilizes the cellular nuclear import machinery, often through a nuclear localization signal on one or more of the PIC components. Once in the nucleus, PIC components like Lens Epithelium-Derived Growth Factor, (LEDGF) have been implicating in anchoring to chromatin. HIV, for example, was found to integrate at chromatin sites enriched in euchromatic histone modifications, including H3 K4 methylation and histone H3 and H4 acetylation (Wang et al. 2007). LEDGF appears to be a decisive and essential factor in mediating the chromatin attachment of the PIC and viral integration (Llano et al. 2006).",

The phenomenon of apoptosis seems to play an important role in the control of virus infection since several viruses have developed ways to counteract the apoptosis.

During herpes virus infection, these aged cells produce exaggerated levels of IL-17 leading to worse outcomes in aged host. This challenges the more accepted notion that reduced immunity with aging is the dominant reason for the aged hosts to be more susceptible to viral infections.

Due to changes in chromatin organization and perturbations in lamina organization during the processes of cellular aging and in premature aging syndromes, many of these contacts between the chromosomes and the lamina are lost (shown with arrows in the figure). This leads to formation of longer chromatin loops, reorganization of chromosome territories, and loss of heterochromatin in the nucleus. In cells from the premature aging syndrome, HGPS, the nuclear lamina is severely dilapidated and therefore most of the chromosome contacts with it are disrupted.
