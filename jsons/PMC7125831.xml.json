The inflammation usually affects surrounding organs such as the larynx (laryngotracheitis) and/or the bronchial tubes (tracheobronchitis, laryngotracheobronchitis [LTB]), depending on the infectious agent involved and on the pathophysiology of the infection (direct, toxinic, etc.) (Table 1\n). Acute LTB or \u201ccroup\u201d is considered when signs and symptoms of viral laryngotracheitis or spasmodic croup of viral and/or atopic origin are observed in children aged below 6 years [2]. Inflammation of the tracheal and/or laryngeal wall(s) leads to a narrower lumen and to an increased airflow in this area (Venturi effect). This constriction triggers a negative pressure responsible for the airway collapse, which in turn triggers turbulent airflow, known as stridor. Stridor can be inspiratory when the obstruction originates in the larynx or cervical trachea, or expiratory when the obstruction originates in the intrathoracic trachea or in the bronchial tubes. It can even be biphasic when the inflammatory obstruction is diffuse [3].",

These symptoms include tachypnea, stridor, and hoarse voice. Patients usually present with an initially dry, hoarse, painful, and spasmodic cough (coughing fit) that may evolve into a productive cough. Cough usually occurs at night, and its deterioration may be due to the lying position or to the circadian rhythm of cortisol and epinephrine levels with low levels between 11pm and 4am, just like asthma peaks that are more often observed at night [4]. Stridor is indicative of the narrowing of the upper airways, that most often originates in the larynx and sometimes in the trachea. Inspiratory and/or expiratory dyspnea, symptoms of respiratory distress syndrome with labored breathing, cyanosis, consciousness disorders, and agitation may occur depending on the extent of the tracheal obstruction. Fever is not always observed in patients presenting with viral tracheitis; it is however more frequent and severe with a bacterial origin. Severity is determined depending on the degree of stenosis (marked/persisting at rest/persisting despite ongoing treatment stridor, sub-clavicle labored respiration) and on the consequences of the lack of oxygen (cyanosis, desaturation, agitation, consciousness disorders) [4]. Pediatric scores may be used to assess croup severity [4].",

X-ray results of patients presenting with croup usually reveal an excessive distension of the lower pharyngeal region and a narrowing of subglottic airways; steeple sign may even be observed. For bacterial tracheitis \u2013 mainly suspected in patients presenting with toxic clinical signs \u2013 the x-ray may reveal a narrowing of subglottic airways and even the presence of intraluminal tracheal membranes or irregularities of the tracheal wall. These signs support the bacterial origin of the infection [6]. The x-ray also reveals pulmonary infiltrates during tracheobronchopneumonia. CT scan is, however, the reference examination to detect the presence of stenosis, of a thickening of the tracheal wall, and of a tracheal obstruction by pseudomembranes. Its main limitation is radiation exposure, especially for young children. Radiation exposure may, however, be reduced with low-dose CT imaging [7]. CT scans are more sensitive and more specific than x-rays for detecting an associated pulmonary infection. Flexible endoscopes help in visualizing supraglottic structures. Subglottic mucosal edema and purulent secretions are often observed with a bacterial infection [8]. Flexible endoscopes help in performing tracheal aspirations to unblock airways and ensure non-contaminated samples for microbiological documentation. The diagnosis may sometimes be confirmed during the autopsy for patients who presented with severe manifestations, most often of bacterial origin [9].",

This laryngotracheobronchitis (LTB), or croup [3], mainly affects children from 6 months to 3 years of age, with an incidence peak at the age of 2. LTB may also occur in infants aged below 3 months or in adolescents [2]. The subglottic region is indeed narrower in children than in adults, and is therefore more rapidly obstructed during inflammation. Croup is one of the most frequent causes of respiratory distress in children. Many viruses with a tropism for the lungs may be responsible for tracheal infection in children: influenza A, B, and C viruses, human parainfluenza viruses, metapneumovirus virus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), coronavirus, adenovirus, and rhinovirus. These viruses are mainly observed during seasonal epidemics. The authors of a Northern American study observed an incidence peak in autumn, at the same time as that of parainfluenza virus infections, although croup was also reported during summer [10]. Other viruses may be associated with tracheal infection, even though rarely: herpes simplex virus (HSV), varicella zoster virus (VZV), cytomegalovirus (CMV), enterovirus, echovirus, coxsackievirus, or the measles virus (18.6% of LTBs in a study of 440 children presenting with measles [11]).",

Although its benefit has never been proven, oxygen therapy is usually administered in case of respiratory distress if it does not lead to the child's agitation. The authors of a meta-analysis did not observe any benefit to air humidification. Helium administration is also not recommended. However, the benefit of a single dose of corticosteroids has been proven [4]. Its benefit on the hospital length of stay, the risk of readmission for treatment and intubation, and on the duration of mechanical ventilation has indeed been proven. Administering a single dose of corticosteroids does not seem to be less effective than a treatment administered for several days. Dexamethasone should be preferred to prednisone as it is better tolerated and possibly more effective, at doses of 0.15 to 0.60 mg/kg. Oral and intramuscular routes are associated with the same efficacy; inhalation is, however, less effective. The administration of nebulized epinephrine for severe presentations of croup reduces the risk of intubation [4]. The effect of epinephrine administration is temporary (at least 1 hour). Nebulized administration may thus be repeated until clinical improvement, but a reevaluation must be performed two hours after administration. When no improvement is observed or if symptoms deteriorate, patients must be admitted to the ICU and bacterial tracheitis must be suspected. Tracheal intubation is sometimes required [4]. Indeed, 75% of bacterial LTBs reported in the literature required endotracheal intubation. This figure highlights the severity of this disease [12].",

Death was most often caused by the associated pulmonary infection. The influenza virus tropism for the airways is related to the distribution gradient of some receptors (sialic acids), at the surface of the respiratory mucous membrane. This partly explains why some patients only present with nasopharyngeal manifestations, while others have tracheobronchial presentations or even viral pneumonia. The presence of type 2\u20136 sialic acids within the trachea probably influences the tracheal infection [21]. Histopathological studies performed during the 1918 pandemic highlighted that a multifocal destruction and pseudo-stratified epithelium desquamation of the trachea and bronchial tubes occur at the early stage. Only the basal layer of the epithelium remains intact and the congestive edema of the submucous membrane is often marked. At more advanced stages, the epithelium regenerate with the formation of a metaplasia by a stratified non-keratinized epithelium [22]. This tracheobronchial involvement results in a local bacterial superinfection followed by a pulmonary infection. This leads to bacterial croup, still called pseudomembranous croup, purulent tracheobronchitis, or membranous LTB [4]. Mucopurulent exudates developed and may cause life-threatening acute obstruction of the airways [8].",

To our knowledge, inflammatory biomarkers (C-reactive protein and procalcitonin) have not been investigated to distinguish a viral origin from a bacterial one during tracheitis. A cytobacteriological examination must be performed in case of productive expectorations because of its non-invasive nature. Results must be interpreted based on conventional quality criteria. Its performances have not been assessed during bacterial tracheitis. Imaging tests (first line: x-ray, second line: CT scan) must be performed for severe presentations, tracheal obstruction suspicion, and/or in the absence of improvement despite conventional treatments. Fibroscopy, which should not be performed in patients presenting with viral croup, must however be performed when a bacterial tracheitis is suspected in the emergency department. The benefits of fibroscopy is to clear the airways through extraction of obstructive pseudomembranes. The diagnosis can thus be established by confirming the presence of diffuse deposits of pseudomembranes, of an exudate responsible for the obstruction, and of erosions [23]. Fibroscopy is also useful for microbiological documentation and for collecting potential histological samples [23].",

A positive culture of protected tracheal aspiration in adults (106\n CFU/mL) is often used, just like bacteriuria during cystitis and pyelonephritis [25]. Despite this high and constant bacterial colonization, bacterial tracheitis onset remains rare. The incidence of VABT has been evaluated at 10.2/1000 days of MV in the most recent prospective study of 2960 patients on MV, i.e. 11% of patients. This incidence is similar to that of VABP [27].

            "text": "A continuum is very likely between tracheal colonization, tracheitis, bronchitis, and pneumonia (Fig. 1\n). Postmortem studies highlight a continuum between bronchitis and pneumonia in patients on MV [28]. For some patients, VABT is temporary as it is in-between bacterial colonization of the trachea and VABP. This pattern is similar to that of bacteriuria/cystitis/pyelonephritis [25]. Distinguishing a colonization from an infection is therefore very difficult. Warning signs are fever, hypoxemia, respiratory function deterioration, increased production of secretions, and leukocytosis with neutrophils. Tracheoscopy must be performed as often as possible. The procedure is easier in patients on life-support. Tracheoscopy is the reference examination to establish the diagnosis of tracheitis. It helps in restricting antibiotic prescription to tracheitis patients. The microbiological documentation helps correct the antibiotic spectrum of activity (22% of inappropriate empirical antibiotic therapies in the prospective study of Martin-Loeches et al. with an excessive mortality in this subgroup [27]). It also helps in antibiotic de-escalation whenever possible. For patients presenting with VABP, a diagnostic strategy based on ATP results is similar to a strategy based on bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) in terms of clinical outcome [29]. Repeated ATP testing in patients on MV helps in precisely determining the microbiological origin of any subsequent VABP and in the early introduction of an adequate antibiotic therapy, with a very good correlation with BAL results [25], [29]. Repeated ATP quantitative microbiological examination is widely used to screen for resistant bacteria responsible for colonization. The aim is to tailor at best the empirical antibiotic therapy in case of VABP onset. VABTs are frequently caused by Gram-negative bacilli (75%) and by multiple bacteria (22%). P. aeruginosa is the most frequent, followed by S. aureus and Acinetobacter baumannii\n[30], [31] (Table 1).",

It must take into consideration prior tracheal microbiological documentations and be tailored to the tracheal culture results during the related episode. Knowing whether to treat a VABT has been extensively discussed. It is estimated that a third of VABTs progress into VABP. The case fatality rate is significantly higher at the end of VABP (40%) than VABT (29%), while the case fatality rate in the absence of lower respiratory tract infection was evaluated at 30% in the largest prospective study of patients on MV in the ICU [27]. Two randomized controlled studies highlighted the benefit of an intravenous and/or nebulized antibiotic therapy during VABT in adults to reduce the risk of VABP onset [30], [32]. The proof of concept was extrapolated in children, in the absence of data in this population. The authors of a study of children aged below 18 years did not observe any association between a prolonged treatment (\u2265 7 days) and the reduction of VABP onset as compared with a short treatment [31]. A randomized placebo-controlled study evaluating the impact of the addition of a nebulized antibiotic therapy for VABT or VABP on the reduction of ventilation duration and hospitalization in the ICU is currently ongoing. Treatment of VABT therefore seems to be a reasonable strategy to improve patient outcome, as suggested by a meta-analysis [33]. The authors of a before/after study evaluating the impact of a multidisciplinary strategy aiming at reducing the incidence of respiratory tract infections on MV (elevate head of the bed to at least 30\u00b0, oral care with chlorhexidine, early extubation, healthcare workers\u2019 hand hygiene) observed a reduced incidence of VABT from 3.9 cases to 1.8 cases per 1000 days of ventilation (P\n = 0.04) [34].

Most of these patients present with other associated predispositions (neutropenia, corticosteroids, etc.) [37]. Patients who underwent lung or heart transplants are at high risk of aspergillosis at the anastomotic site between the recipient's trachea and that of the host [39].

Dissemination through the lymphatic route, from a pulmonary localization, or through the erosion of a cyst in the tracheal lumen, or even through the hematogenous route are being discussed [45]. The infection first manifests with an erythema and an edema with submucosal lymphocytic infiltrates followed by the formation of a tubercle. Extensive granulation of the tissue destroys and replaces the mucous and submucous membrane, and results in extensive fibrosis responsible for stenosis of the tracheobronchial tract [45].

Confirmation may be obtained with the presence of a cytopathogenic effect or by detecting the virus in tracheal secretions using culture or molecular biology techniques [52].

During viral infection, the trachea contributes to the bacterial superinfection and the difficulty lies in recognizing the progression into bacterial tracheitis in children as the morbidity and mortality remain high. During MV or tracheostomy, distinguishing bacterial tracheitis from simple colonization is difficult as tracheitis evolving into acquired pneumonia is frequent and associated with an excessive mortality rate. Non-specific clinical signs and difficulties in accessing the organ complicate the management. Persistent stridor and hoarse cough are suggestive signs. An endoscopic examination must be performed in patients presenting with severe symptoms, persistent obstruction, or in patients on MV. The endoscopic examination helps in establishing the diagnosis and in collecting adequate samples. Indeed, the etiological spectrum and pathophysiological processes are wide. Diagnostic delay may lead in the long-term to tracheal stenosis, which management is complex.",
