Dondelinger; Li\u00e8ge/BE Blunt trauma victims and selected patients with penetrating trauma are systematically investigated after resuscitation and haemodynamic stabilization with crosssectional imaging. Marginally stable patients with flank and pelvic trauma are also included. Computed tomography is a good predictor of the need for haemostatic arteriographic embolization, based on contrast medium extravasation observed on CT. Ongoing hemorrhage must be differentiated from small intraparenchymal or intramuscular \"blushes\" of contrast or venous bleeding. In centers admitting polytrauma patients, the CT and angiography units should be installed together within the emergency environment to minimize time delay between diagnosis and intervention and obviate transport of polytrauma victims. Traumadedicated interventional radiologists should be on call for optimal patient management. Ongoing posttraumatic retroperitoneal and pelvic bleeding is a primary indication for angiographic haemostasis, together with orthopedic fixation of pelvic bone fractures, avoiding diagnostic peritoneal lavage and laparotomy, when no associated visceral injuries, requiring repair, are detected on CT. Angiography should be carried out rapidly, before the patient decompensates from considerable internal blood loss. In patients with intraperitoneal visceral bleeding, arterial embolization can obviate primary surgery or potentialize surgical intervention or contribute to changing hierarchy of injuries to be treated surgically. Overall, haemostasis is achieved in 83 to 100% of cases. Failure to achieve primary haemostasis may occur, according to type of specific organ injury and coagulation and metabolic parameters of the patient, due to delayed intervention and underestimation of severity of injury on CT. Postembolization complications are few and are usually non-life threatening, and rarely carry definitive sequelae. Learning Objectives: 1. To differentiate CT findings of \"ongoing hemorrhage\" and \"probably arrested bleeding\". 2. To understand the importance of timely appropriate angiographic intervention for effective management of some specific sites of hemorrhage.",

This presentation will concentrate upon the imaging and endovascular treatment of vascular injuries that may occur. The diagnosis of a vascular injury is increasingly being made non-invasively with the use of duplex Doppler ultrasound, CT and MR. Contrast angiography, however, remains the gold standard in the diagnosis of arterial injury and in view of its potential for therapeutic intervention remains the diagnostic method of choice. An understanding of the relatively limited ways in which a vessel can respond to trauma is essential as it is usually the type of vascular injury that determines the method of endovascular therapy rather than the organ within which it occurs. It is equally important to understand how vessels respond to endovascular treatment in order to ensure therapeutic success and this presentation will discuss these points in detail. Learning Objectives: 1. To recognize the imaging findings in patients with vascular trauma. 2. To understand the different ways in which a vessel may respond to trauma. 3 . To recognize the importance of a meticulous angiographic technique in the diagnostic workup of a patient with a vascular injury.",

            "text": "A-003 C. Imaging and intervention of large vessel injuries J. Lammer; Vienna/AT Traumatic vessel injury can cause bleeding, thrombosis, embolization, or malperfusion due to external compression and spasm. Non-traumatic causes of acute large arterial emergencies include rupture of an aneurysm and pseudoaneurysm, dissection, embolization, and thrombosis in hypercoagulability syndromes. Ultrasonography is, of course, the imaging modality of choice in emergency cases. However, in central vascular injuries, spiral computed tomography with contrast enhancement is the imaging modality that provides the most information. 3D CT angiography may replace catheter angiography in some emergency cases. However, catheter angiography may be necessary for detailed information and before intervention. Stents covered by a plastic membrane (stentgrafts) are used to close large vascular lacerations, ruptured aortic aneurysms, and the entry tear of dissections. Embolization with coils is indicated if large side branches of the aorta are the cause of bleeding. Interventional radiology methods play a major role in managing vascular emergencies. Learning Objectives: 1. Imaging of large vessel injuries by angiography and noninvasive modalities such as CT-angiography. 2. Interventional treatment of traumatic arterial lacerations such as rupture and dissection by stents, stentgrafts and coils. The hip contains extensive marrow space in which various processes may occur. Disease processes involving the hip joint -such as trauma, osteonecrosis, arthritis and infection -can induce marrow changes. However, the conditions mentioned above are frequently not detected by conventional radiographic techniques until they have reached an advanced clinical stage. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been successfully used to evaluate pathologic processes in the hip. The excellent spatial and contrast resolution provided by MRI facilitates early detection and evaluation of various disorders. With direct, noninvasive MR imaging of bone marrow, fractures and infiltrative diseases can be identified earlier than with radiographic studies. For imaging the marrow of the hip we use a combination of pulse sequences, including T1-w spin echo, T2-w turbo spin echo with fat suppression and turbo-short T1 inversion recovery. In selected cases contrast enhanced T1-w spin echo with fat suppression is applied. Radiological interpretation of the marrow space requires an understanding of normal maturation and recognition that the proximal femur contains variable amounts of red and yellow marrow. With MRI this variability yields normal patterns ranging from very uniform and homogeneous signal intensity to patchy and heterogeneous signal intensity. Signal changes depend on the pulse sequence applied. The marrow reflects patient health and may herald developing anemia with marrow re-conversion from inactive to active. Disorders to be considered include: marrow ischemia and infarction, transient osteoporosis, marrow oedema secondary to trauma, osteoarthritis, tendon pathology and infection, and marrow infiltration resulting from disorders such as Gaucher's disease or myelofibrosis.

Fascia and ligaments provide passive support, with the muscles of the pelvic floor, mainly the levator ani, giving active support. The pelvic floor has three layers, from superior to inferior: The pelvic fascia, pelvic diaphragm and perineal membrane, intimately related to the urogenital region, urethra, anal sphincter and vagina in women. The pelvic fascia comprises the endopelvic fascia and ligaments, mostly delicate structures not visualized at imaging. The levator ani muscle and coccygeus muscle are the muscles of the pelvic diaphragm. The constant muscle tone of these muscles combined with fascial stability, results in a dome-shaped form and also closes the urogenital hiatus. The perineal membrane is a fibromuscular layer directly below the pelvic diaphragm.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is assuming an increasingly important role in the more accurate delineation of the extent of the problem. This lecture will briefly review one of the main radiological methods for the dynamic evaluation of the pelvic floor: Functional cine MRI. After a more general definition of the method, details of the technique are given. Out of the literature the smallest common denominator for functional cine MRI can be defined as follows: High field system; patient either in supine or sitting position; fast gradient echo sequence; midsagittal slice orientation; either a stack of slices or repeated measurements at the same slice position with the patient at rest or straining. As image analysis plays an important role a critical survey of the parameters and reference lines in use is provided. Finally, while giving a summary of important findings within the different compartments, clinical applications, strengths and limitations of this imaging technique are described. All except two publications stress the usefulness of functional cine MRI in the evaluation of patients with organ descent and prolapse. This well accepted method allows for the visualization of all relevant structures. It is especially useful in the detection of enteroceles, and provides a reliable postoperative follow-up tool. ",

            "text": "Faecal incontinence: Atrophy and tears E. Rociu; Amsterdam/NL When conservative treatment fails, faecal incontinence is most often due to local sphincter dysfunction: Tears or atrophy. Tears comprise asymmetric disruption of the sphincteric ring associated with scar tissue. Atrophy comprises generalised volume reduction of the striated muscle with fatty replacement regardless the integrity of the muscle ring. Disrupted sphincters can be surgically repaired. Atrophy is irreversible and cannot be locally treated. When a torn sphincter is also atrophic the surgical repair has poor outcome. In atrophic sphincters with or with-out tears, other surgical techniques like artificial sphincter implants, sacral neurostimulation or dynamic graciloplasty should be considered. In faecal incontinence due to local sphincter dysfunction, the local high spatial resolution of endosonography and endoanal MRI makes both techniques particularly suitable for diagnosis. Endoanal MR imaging is preferable for external sphincter disorders while endoanal US is preferable in cases of internal sphincter disorders, although this is influenced by personal experience. Endoanal US can be used as primary technique with endoanal MRI as second line technique, depending on local expertise and availability. When surgical repair is considered for a sphincter tear endoanal MRI should be performed as it is the only technique to exclude sphincter atrophy, a predicting factor for negative outcome. For coronary imaging, multi-detector row helical CT operates with an acquisition mode called retrospective ECG gating. With exposure times as long as 200 ms, the newest generation of multi-detector row CT allows for consistently good image quality when regular sinus rhythm is present and the heart rate is in the range between 40 and 60 beats per minute. The use of beta-blocker may become necessary for patient preparation aiming at a heart rate of 60 beats per minute or less. Patient room time is approximately 15 minutes and image reconstruction and post processing can be performed within approximately 10 minutes. The radiation exposure of a coronary CTA investigation and a diagnostic coronary catheter procedure are comparable (~5 mSv). A series of authors meanwhile have compared CTA and cardiac catheter to detect coronary artery stenosis. Because of the limited spatial resolution in CTA the definitive assessment of the degree of coronary artery stenoses still remains problematic. In addition, extensive calcifications may hinder the detection of coronary artery stenosis. Therefore, coronary CTA will currently not be suited to determine the progression in patients with known CAD, typical angina or obvious myocardial ischemia. These patients are still better approached by cardiac catheter examination with the option to perform percutaneous coronary interventions in the same session. However, the negative predictive value of CTA is remarkably high, making it a favorable tool to exclude a coronary macro-angiopathy and to avoid unnecessary cardiac catheter procedures in patients with unspecific symptoms. Basically, cardiac MRI techniques rely on the same principles as MRI in other parts of the human body. The heart, however, is one of the most difficult organs to study with MRI. Problems are related to cardiac and respiratory motion, variable pulsatile flow patterns, the large size of the chest cavity, the presence of often abundant surrounding mediastinal fat and difficulties to catch the electrical activity of the heart in a magnetic environment, etc. In the last two decades several techniques have been developed enabling the study of the heart in a reliable and accurate fashion. At present, not only can information be obtained on cardiac morphology, but also myocardial and valvular function. Myocardial perfusion and viability can also be studied and quantified. Imaging of smaller cardiac structures such as coronary arteries, is no longer a domain of specialized research centers, but can be performed on clinical MRI scanners equipped with cardiac MRI software. In this lecture an overview is given of the different cardiac MRI techniques Although diagnosis of hilar cholangiocarcinoma (or Klatskin tumor) is a domain of MRCP, demonstration of vascular compromise (i.e., non-resectability) is generally difficult. Single-slice CT is limited for assessing resectability (accuracy, 60%), because proximal tumor extent is underestimated. Preliminary experience with MDCT indicates that the extent of bile duct involvement may be better displayed due to multi-planar imaging capabilities. Single-slice CT is a very sensitive method for detection of pancreatic cancer. Axial CT images reveal tumor involvement of vessels running perpendicular to the slice. However, it is more difficult to assess tumor contiguity with vessels running parallel or oblique to the slice (hepatic artery, portal vein). CPRs along the ducts and peripancreatic vessels display extension of tumor much better for the surgeon. Isoattenuating tumors may be visible only by the presence of mass effect and obstruction, which is better displayed by CPRs along the pancreatic duct.",

Advantages rely upon an increased speed of data acquisition, z-axis coverage and/or high quality longitudinal resolution. MDCT permits not only to define the original beam collimation but also the desired final slice thickness by recruiting the appropriate combinations of individual X-ray detectors. The most striking applications in liver imaging results from the clear separation of the three distinct phases of contrast enhancement: the arterial phase, the portal venous inflow phase, and the venous phase of parenchymal enhancement. All phases can be acquired in two breathhold periods (B1 for arterial and portal venous inflow phase and B2 for parenchymal enhancement) using reduced slice thickness (typically from 2.5 to 5 mm) with free definition of overlapping reconstructions. For liver imaging, MDCT can provide enhanced focal lesion detection and characterization, and high-quality vascular studies increasingly requested namely in the context of liver transplantation. Due to the high speed of data acquisition, robust injection protocols must be designed in order to be able to exploit its potentialities. Since there is a high variability of individual phases of liver enhancement among patients, the use of an automatic bolus triggering recognition software is encouraged. Learning Objectives: 1. To understand the basic principles of MDCT for liver imaging. The field of diagnostic brain imaging has undergone astonishing progresses in the last decade, unveiling structural details and functional processes of the human brain with unprecedented and unparalleled sensitivity and precision, and providing revolutionary contributes to neuroscience research. The diffusion of high field MRI units for human studies throughout the world, with very high field MRI units, up to 8 Tesla, working in a few research centers and a larger number of MRI units with field intensity ranging between 3 and 5 Tesla, has permitted studies of brain cortex and of subcortical structures with high spatial resolution. The use of high definition three-dimensional acquisition sequences has, in turn, allowed accurate reconstructions of brain surface, also used as input of morphing algorithms to produce \"inflated\", \"flattened\" or spherical models of brain hemispheres. In these unconventional spaces, the investigation of brain functional processes is made much easier and more accurate. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has become the most widely used approach for studying brain functions in humans. The rapid and widespread diffusion of fMRI has brought the functional examination of the brain within the reach of the whole neuroscience community and have appreciably stimulated research on the functional processes of the living brain. A further, very promising advancement of MRI, diffusion tensor imaging, has opened entirely new avenues to neuroscience research, permitting to highlight white matter bundles which connect brain areas to each other providing, in single living individuals, the demonstration of anatomical connectivity. Learning Objectives: 1. To examine the potential of new MRI techniques in the study of brain cortical and subcortical anatomy and in the evaluation of white matter connections. 2. To integrate the growing knowledge on brain anatomy with the evaluation of brain functions with fMRI.",

Several imaging modalities are used to visualize salivary glands including plain films, conventional sialography, ultrasound, CT, CT sialography, MRI, MR sialography and nuclear medicine studies. For a rational, cost-effective use of diagnostic imaging it is necessary to tailor the imaging approach to the patient's clinical problem/presentation. Two main clinical syndromes determine the appropriate imaging approach: inflammatory/obstructive syndrome and mass lesion syndrome. Whereas patients presenting with inflammatory/obstructive syndrome are best evaluated with ultrasound and some form of sialography, patients presenting with mass lesion syndrome are preferably evaluated with CT or MR. Sialolithiasis and several infectious and non-infectious sialoadenitis are the most common entities presenting with obstructive/inflammatory syndrome, whereas benign and malignant neoplasms present with mass lesion syndrome. Imaging differentiates sialolithiasis from other causes of sialoadenitis, identifies the location and number of calculi, detects post-obstructive changes and may establish the etiology of a few acute and chronic sialoadenitis. Patients with mass lesion syndrome present with a palpable mass.

This lecture will first review the different pulse sequences that can be used to perform MR sialography, such as 2D and 3D FSE, RARE, HASTE, GRASE, 3D CISS and 3D EX-PRESS. It will discuss their relative advantages and disadvantages, as well as their performance in the diagnosis and management of non-neoplastic diseases affecting the major salivary glands. Emphasis will be placed on the assessment of sialolithiasis, chronic recurrent sialadenitis and sialodochitis, autoimmune diseases, sialosis and cysts. Data from the literature comparing the performance of MR sialography with conventional X-ray sialography will be discussed. Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values of the most useful MR sialography sequences will be discussed, as well as how to integrate the information available from these imaging studies with the clinical findings and non-radiologic diagnostic tests. Emphasis will be placed on the correlation between clinical and pathologic presentation and MR sialography findings. In addition, the implications of a precise pretheraputic work-up, as well as the key questions the radiologist has to answer in a specific clinical context will be discussed with respect to treatment.

Freling; Amsterdam/NL Differential diagnosis of salivary gland masses depends largely on the location of the lesion: preauricular area, parapharyngeal space (PPS), oral cavity (OC), sublingual / submandibular space (SMS). Depending on the tissues within these specific areas, one may assume a different origin of the lesion: major or minor salivary gland, lymph nodes, bone (mandible, skull base), odontogenic, masticator muscles, PPS, subcutaneous origin, vascular. Imaging will help differentiate a solid from a cystic or vascular lesion, and solitary from multiple lesions. To differentiate benign from malignant salivary gland lesions is not always possible. Salivary gland tumours are rare and make up about 3% of all tumours in the general population. About 1% of all head and neck tumours are of salivary origin. Parotid tumours are benign in up to 75%, submandibular and minor salivary gland tumours are malignant in about 50%, sublingual gland tumours are malignant in more than 90%. The age of the patient at presentation will greatly influence differential diagnosis: although solid salivary gland tumours may also occur in children, most of the mass lesions presenting at a very young age are due to vascular or lymphatic malformations. In the adult or elderly, solid salivary tumours outweigh vascular lesions.",

A neuroradiologist on duty can make his remarks on an emergency CT scan with a help of a image phone. A neurosurgeon can make decisions based on image data even before entering the hospital.

Through the 6 th Framework Programme for Research and Development (2002 Development ( -2006 it has identified the medical sector as one of the major of area of interest, medical imaging representing a large part of it. In the past 5 th Framework Programme more than 50 large scale research projects were centred on medical imaging, mainly through the programmes managed from DG INFSO (Information Society) and DG RTD (Research). In the 6 th Framework Programme brand new instruments supporting the already existing ones are the Integrated Projects (very large scale R&TD projects) and the networks of excellence as synergetic cluster of Institutions creating all together the critical mass for fostering research on specific topics. Among the challenges for medical imaging in the on coming programme, biomedical informatics, biomolecular imaging, micro and nanotechnology and specific applications of the GRID technology to medical imaging were identified. The regional aspects and the international co-operation are to be considered as peculiar and promising feature of the European Programme. Occlusive aortoiliac disease has been treated in the past by open surgery. Regardless of the type of open surgery, it always carries a considerable morbidity and mortality, 9-20% and 1-5%, respectively. In comparison, the perioperative mortality associated with aortoiliac interventions, including PTA and stenting, is less than 1% and the morbidity is limited to 10%. Personal experience from percutaneous stent recanalization of 76 occluded iliac arteries resulted in anatomical success in 74 (97%) limbs, no perioperative mortality and 10% major complications. The patency rate in surgically placed grafts is generally higher than that for endovascular interventions. The latter, however, do not preclude subsequent endovascular reinterventions and, if these fail, open surgery. The patency rate in the above-mentoned percutaneously stent-recanalized occluded iliac arteries was 79% primary and 87% secondary patency at 1 year, and 69% primary and 81% secondary patency at 3 years.",

Open surgery today is reserved for very extensive occlusions of the aortoiliac segment and for those in whom endovascular interventions may fail. Patients suffering from ischemic symptoms of the lower limb can present with acute, sub-acute or chronic symptoms. According to the clinical status, appropriate management should be discussed on a multi-specialist approach in which interventionnal radiologists play a full role. This requires well understood imaging technique in which arteriography still plays a central role. In case of acute ischemia, aspiration and lysis are feasible, useful and less invasive than surgery. In case of critical ischemia the consensus favours endovascular intervention in the first line and primary bypass is less commonly indicated. In case of chronic ischemia such as severe claudication, angioplasty is the technique of choice but medical treatment is also often appropriate at least in the beginning. Stents can be used selectively but less often than in the aorto-iliac segment. Appropriate clinical knowledge of the general features of atheromatous disease and the ability to manage a patient globally including consultation are important features that interventionnal radiologists should maintain and teach.

More and more data is becoming available that shows no significant difference between surgery and PTA in early follow-up, but recently also in the longer term (CAVATAS). One study showed advantages of stenting over surgery in early follow-up (SAPPHIRE). The technique of carotid stenting is pretty straightforward but the potential risks of embolization have led to an increased use of protection devices. Their role is still ill-defined and some complications may be related to those devices. Appropriate manual handling techniques for devices, guiding catheters and stents are mandatory for success in carotid lesions. A new approach is offered by virtual reality training facilities that allow safe training of basic techniques prior to real clinical application. Learning Objectives: 1. New developments in carotid stenting: Strategies for using new generation protection devices and new self-expanding stents. 2. Potential techniques to reduce risk of particle embolization. 3 . New ways to establish training among starters by computer-assisted training and training seminars. 4. At the end of this presentation the audience will be up to date with the technology and techniques. This review includes infections of the vertebral body (spondylitis), intervertebral disc (spondylodiscitis), ligaments and paravertebral soft tissues, epidural space (epidural abscesses), meninges and subarachnoid space, and the spinal cord (myelitis and spinal cord abscesses). A wide range of infective organisms may be implicated and the incidence of some, notably tuberculosis, is rising due to increased immunocompromise and other factors. Imaging plays a key role in early diagnosis of these diseases, which may be severe and potentially life threatening. Infection may be acquired by the haematogenous route, by infection from contiguous structures or from direct inoculation. Of available imaging techniques, computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) offer the clinically most valuable methods of evaluating all the structures potentially involved in infection. Other imaging modalities such as plain X-ray films, skeletal scintigraphy and PET are briefly discussed as well. Although many signs are non-specific, indication is given of where appearances raise strong suspicion of infection. The extent of the inflammatory process is well evaluated by imaging, particularly in terms of severity and morbidity of clinical sequelae, which may be severe. Systematic analysis of the imaging findings as well as the most relevant clues to differential diagnosis are included in this lecture. In conclusion, spinal and spinal cord infections represent severe pathologic conditions that should be diagnosed in an early stage, avoiding serious musculoskeletal and neurological complications. MRI has nowadays the key role to play and should be employed as soon as infection is clinically suspected. A-041 C. Radiation issues and economic aspects F. Stacul, D. Dibilio; Trieste/IT Unenhanced helical CT (UHCT) is now considered the gold standard for imaging patients with renal colic. However some disagreements exist on the radiation dose to patients undergoing the procedure and on the cost of the examination. Different CT techniques are used; not surprisingly the X-ray dose calculations in the literature vary to a large extent. The delivered dose can be up to 5 times higher than that delivered by excretory urography. With single-detector helical scanners the dose can be significantly decreased by increasing the pitch; some authors report that the accuracy rate for stone detection is not affected. Multidetector scanners provide an increased radiation dose if CT parameters are unchanged. The dose could be lowered by decreasing the mAs, with individual optimization related to body size or using a geometric X-ray modulation. However there is concern regarding alternate and additional diagnoses that could be missed if the dose is lowered too much. The cost of a CT procedure in patients with renal colic can be compared with other radiological procedures following a careful analysis of the differential costs of each investigation (equipment, variable costs, personnel) and their common costs. In our environment UHCT has a cost which is 8% lower as compared to IVU. However multiple variable factors, both for the dose and cost analysis, suggest the data cannot be simply applied to other environments and similar evaluations look worthwhile in other departments. The plain film anatomy of the stomach and small bowel will be presented. Pathological causes of dilated stomach and small bowel will be be discussed as well as distinguishing features which may be present on plain films. Small bowel obstruction and its causes will be extensively illustrated as well as those conditions which cause abnormal small bowel mucosa such as mesenteric ischaemia. In the current endoscopic and cross sectional imaging era, upper gastrointestinal barium studies are being less and less requested. Trainees are less exposed to the techniques and the barium studies have become somewhat devalued. However these studies do have some advantages over other imaging techniques and will continue to be performed in the foreseeable future. Whilst endoscopy, with or without biopsy, is undoubtedly the prime method of upper gastrointestinal diagnosis, barium studies give a valuable overview of both anatomy and function. Compared to endoscopy they can give information about motility, identify subtle strictures, fistulae and positional abnormalities. Sometimes submucosal or extrinsic disease is better visualized and analysis of mucosal patterns (including areae gastricae) provides clues unavailable to the endoscopist. Occasionally large lesions are paradoxically to big for accurate analysis with the limited field of view of an endoscope. The third part of the duodenum and beyond are outside the reach of a standard diagnostic endoscopy, and the luminal views of these parts of the small bowel remain the domain of the barium radiologist. Unfortunately they probably represent the areas where radiological accuracy is at its lowest, and attention to technique is important in achieving the most from these studies. Besides surface coating, current research has primarily been focused on matrix selection, stent platforms, drug transportation and distribution, types of eluted drugs, and clinical randomized studies. The first clinical trial of sirolimus-eluting stent in PVD has showed promising midterm results. Late thrombosis/ hyperplasia secondary to delayed endothelialization remains the potential problem with this technique. 5. Brachytherapy has proven effective for in-stent restenosis. However, they have not been demonstrated to be valuable in the treatment of \"de novo\" lesions of the peripheral vessels. 6. Stent-based gene therapy is developing as a future concept. Intensive research is exploring its potential clinical values. It may not become reality within the next few years. 7. The sharply increasing number of commercial stents leads to the greater stent selection for PVD. Among these competing technologies, drug-eluting stents appear to be the front runner in achieving major breakthrough in maintaining post-stenting vascular patency. However, each above mentioned technique may find a niche in the treatment of PVD. The primary technical success rate for PTA of iliac artery stenoses is 95% (88-99%), in occlusions 83% (78-98%). The technical success rate for stents in iliac artery stenoses is 99% (91-100%), in occlusions 82% (80-92%). The complication rates are between 3% and 6%. In iliac arteries the reported 1-year primary patency rate is 78% (67%-92%) and 90% (78%-97%) after PTA and stenting, respectively. The Dutch Iliac Stent Trial demonstrated 2-years patency rates of 71% versus 70% in the stent group versus PTA group with optional stent placement. In superficial femoral artery (SFA) obstructions and IC the 1-year primary patency rate of PTA vs. stents seems to be equal (65-77% vs. 73-75%). However, in CLI the patency rate of stents seem to be better compared to PTA (73-74% vs. 47-60%). Randomized trials comparing PTA vs. stenting in SFA obstructions revealed similar 1-year patency rates of 25-85% for PTA and 63-75% for stents.",

Jenelten; Winterthur/CH Introduction: Stents have been advocated to improve longterm patency after infraingunal angioplasty. However, controversial results of primary stenting versus PTA alone have been published in randomized studies, the main problem being stent induced intimal hyperplasia. On the other hand the implantation of stents has proved an effective treatment to salvage insufficient results of femoropopliteal PTA due to elastic recoil, excentric calcification, or dissection/intimal flaps with a tendency for better results with shorter stents. With the assumption that short stents may cause less intimal hyperplasia we designed a study to salvage insufficient angioplasty results of the femoro-popliteal artery by placing one short balloon-expandable stent of only 10-17 mm in length at the area of greatest residual stenosis. 51 claudicants (Fontaine stage IIB) and 17 patients with critical limb ischemia were treated with one short stent (four patients needed more than one stent) for significant (> 50%) residual stenosis or intimal flaps after the initial treatment in the same session. The primary patency at 6, 12 and 24 months was 85.5%, 75% and 67% respectively. The respective values for the secondary patency were 95%, 93% and 93%. Conclusions: Though also short stents are not immune against intimal hyperplasia they seem efficient for salvaging unsatisfactory results of recanalisation and PTA also of long-segment lesions in the femoro-popliteal artery. Particularly the secondary patency at two years seems remarkable with no unplanned amputation in view of the fact that stents were used only in bail out situations and complex lesions. Our results compare favourably with the literature. Learning Objectives:",

Tsetis; Iraklion/GR Stent-grafts are an effective and minimally invasive alternative to surgery in peripheral aneurysms, traumatically induced lesions and arteriovenous fistulas of large caliber vessels. However their role in the inhibition of intimal hyperplasia remains controversial. Theoretically, a stent-graft excludes much of the atherosclerotic material in the arterial wall and potentially creates a substrate for a neointima to form. A pore size of 60-90 \u00ecm is optimal for promotion of graft healing. The most well studied design is the Hemobahn self-expanding stent-graft composed of a thin-walled expanded ePTFE tube inside a nitinol sinusoidally shaped helically wrapped stent. This device has good radial force and is very well suited to popliteal artery applications due to its very high flexibility. Dacron-covered stent-grafts implanted in the femoropopliteal artery are associated with postimplantation fever and local pain in up to 40% of patients. Stent-graft related infection is a rare but serious complication. There is insufficient evidence to advise routine use of prophylactic antibiotics. ",

            "text": "Since the early seventeenth century intellectuals have developed the use of measurement to determine the causes of disease and to evaluate the benefits or harms from various measures used to treat people. The science of \"statistik\" evolved into probability theory which led to mortality tables and the discipline of \"public health\". This in turn led in the twentieth century to clinical epidemiology and now currently to evidence based medicine. Doctors have struggled uncomfortably for over half a century with the knowledge that half of what we know is not true, and with the ethics of when and how to introduce measures that are probably, but not certainly, helpful. However it is unusual for solid evidence to precede the introduction of a new measure, and a large scale preventive medicine programme gains an almost unstoppable forward momentum, provided by the happy combination of probably doing good and the accrual of personal prestige and/or financial reward, supported by industry and politicians. Data from clinical epidemiology and especially randomized controlled trials can identify major error, but it may take decades of evidence before cherished notions are abandoned, as with the recent about turn on promotion of hormone replacement therapy for post menopausal women. This lecture will examine some of radiology's contributions to preventive medicine, especially tuberculosis, cancer, osteoporosis and pregnancy. The \"doctor's dilemma\" is as acute today as it was a hundred years ago. Learning Objectives: 1. To appreciate the problems inherent in evaluation of benefit versus harm in medical intervention. 2. To recognize the difference in ethics of screening versus clinical medicine. 3. To understand how often adequate data is lacking to know whether net harm or net benefit is accruing from some of our current practices. 4.

Pathological changes may be considered as either elevated or depressed, or causing deformity of the bowel wall. Distinguishing features of polyps (elevated) from ulcers or diverticula (depressed), and the differential features of strictures will be presented. A detailed review of neoplasia (polyps, polyposis syndromes, diagnostic features and cancer risk; cancer and other tumours such as lymphoma), colitis (early diagnosis, differential features between ulcerative and Crohn's colitis, the acute attack, complications) and diverticular disease (features of muscle thickening, diverticula, complications) will be given and the differential features of extrinsic disease discussed. Vertebral injuries occur in a predictable and reproducible manner that is dependent upon the mechanism of injury. Each mechanism of injury leaves distinct imaging \"fingerprints\" regardless of the location in the spine. Basic principles include abnormalities of alignement and anatomy, bony integrity, cartilage or joint space, and soft tissues. The imaging features will indicate stability of the spine following injury and classify spinal injuries into two categories -\"major and minor\". The task of radiology is to establish the radiological diagnosis, classify it, judge stability and instability and lead further radiological evaluation in cases of nonagreement between the radiological diagnosis and the clinical (neurological) findings. Until the introduction of spiral-CT into clinical routine-work, conventional radiographs were accepted as the first-line \"gold standard\" imaging modality in severe spinal trauma, this is no longer acceptable. The false negative reports with the single use of conventional radiographs may reach 57%, which is unacceptable. Therefore today in severe injuries, the first-line imaging gold standard is (multi-detector) spiral-CT followed by MRI. While, CT allows exact visualization of all bony abnormalities, MRI will be used in all cases with an unclear neurological deficit, cord injuries, vascular problems, disk herniation, haematomas, bone marrow edema and ligament-problems. But in all these cases one must be aware that MRI and some CT-abnormalities may be seen only on delayed 24 hr images. So what is the problem and, with increasingly sophisticated technology, surely it is simple to roll out screening tests for all cancers? But screening is not without risk and must be done well to be successful. There is no place for the amateur radiologist \"doing a few mammograms\" a year. Those involved in breast screening must be part of a multidisciplinary team and their results subjected to regular audit. Only by such scrutiny will the false positive and negative results be within acceptable limits. Even in the best hands, most women subjected to regular screening between the ages of 50 to 70 will have at least one false positive mammogram result at some stage during their twenty years of screening. Three presentations will precede an opportunity for debate. Amongst topics to be considered will be the whole issue that while screening may lower mortality from an individual cancer, it may not necessarily lower overall mortality. Some patients may die from unrelated causes, rather than from the cancer that was 'cured' through screening. Another topical issue is the question of walk-in screening centres which claim to save lives by whole body CT or MR screening. ",

There are many strategies for deciding which health services are really effective, cost-effective and have the best opportunity cost and whose provision should be maintained, versus those which are ineffective or have a low cost-effectiveness or cost-opportunity ratio, and should be progressively discarded from public funding. In this context, evidence-based medicine has been proposed as a renewed methodology to inspire sound decisions, either at an individual or community level. However, modern, educated societies are far from passively accepting such restrictions. People are very sensitive and demand whatever seems capable of providing hope or avoiding suffering, particularly in relation to severe diseases. Culturally, the concept of prevention has been progressively accepted and many people are predisposed to undertake the different tests or treatments that technology is incessantly producing. On the other hand, less educated or wealthy people often face a diversity of barriers for benefiting from preventive services and interventions of demonstrated effectiveness. Screening is a paradigmatic intervention in that context, in part because is usually offered to millions of apparently healthy people. Therefore, any screening strategy should balance the methodological requirements of evidence-based medicine, the specific needs and health priorities defined by each particular country, the cultural values more prevalent in the correspondent society, and the struggle for keeping the concerned individuals informed. Learning Objectives: 1. In this presentation, screening will be discussed from the perspective of the balance between methodological requirements, cultural values and health priorities. 2. Concepts and details will be illustrated with examples taken from cervical, breast, prostate, and lung cancer.",

            "text": "For tumor screening special attention needs to be focused on two organ systems: the lungs and the colon. TrueFISP lung imaging is highly accurate regarding the detection of mass lesions beyond 5 mm. For MR-colonography the colon is distended with a water enema. Following the administration of paramagnetic contrast colorectal mass lesions become visible due to their inherent enhancement. Preliminary results document an excellent accuracy for this technique. Most breast cancers (between 65% and 80%) occur as sporadic malignancy among women without any elevated risk. The risk increases with age. Prolonged exposure to endogenous hormones increases the risk: early menarche and late menopause, nulliparity, late first full-term pregnancy and lack of breast feeding. The breast cancer risk is elevated in women who have a first degree relative (mother, sister or daughter) with breast cancer. Inherited mutations of BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes account for a very high relative risk of breast cancer. However, only 5% of all cancers are considered to have genetic background. 10% to 20% of breast cancers are DCIS, which carriers a 30% chance of developing into invasive disease. LCIS is considered not to be a precursor lesion, but it is associated with an increased risk. Some biopsy proven benign proliferative changes, in particular ADH or ALH, increase breast cancer risk. Ionizing radiation, for instance treatment for Hodgkin's disease, increases risk. Increased weight in menopause, western diet, alcohol, dense breast parenchyma, HRT and oral contraceptives are considered to have weak association to increased risk. The total average risk is 1 per 9 (11%). The risk of secondary cancer in the same (10% -35%) or in contralateral breast (1% -15%) depends on the size, histological type and grade of the tumour, completeness of tumour removal and postoperative therapy. Total \"oestrogen burden\" is undoubtedly the major risk factor for developing breast cancer. This is affected by reproductive history, exogenous hormones (oral contraceptive pill and HRT) and \"lifestyle\" e.g. obesity and alcohol which effect oestrogen metabolism and cellular sensitivity. HRT usage in the western population has become endemic (20 to 50% of women 47 -70 years of age). Oestrogen/ progestogen combinations (to protect the endometrium) have superseded earlier oestrogen only preparations for women with intact uterus. More recently synthetic oestrogen (Tibolone) has been introduced. It has been known for a long time that current HRT usage is associated with increased risk of breast cancer. This has been reinforced by WHI study (USA) and the Million Women Study (UK). The later implicates all preparations but combined oestrogen progestogen cause 4 times as many extra cancers as oestrogen on its own. In the UK current users are 66% more likely to develop breast cancer and 22% more likely to die from breast cancer than never users. The effect on incidence increases with increasing duration of use and wears off with in a few years of stopping therapy. Additionally HRT decreases both the specificity of screening mammography (i.e. increases recall rates) and reduces its sensitivity (i.e. increases interval cancer rates). Increasing affluence is associated with the benefits of planned families but also the problems of increasing obesity and alcohol consumption, all of which increase breast cancer risk. All these risks are amenable to change but the choices are not necessarily straightforward. A-062 C. Physician-patient relationship R. Chersevani; Gorizia/IT Radiologist -breast patient relationship may differ from that of other physicianpatient situations as it is not continuous, but sometimes rather brief, or with no real meeting among the two actors; there usually is no choice on behalf of the patient; imaging production is considered a technical and rather automatic procedure -depending mostly on \"machines\"; the perception or misperception is that diagnosis will always be achieved as the sensitivity of imaging techniques is always 100%. We are surely responsible for some of these issues as we have pushed women to early diagnosis indicating our best results and not the drawbacks. Patients want to trust their doctors, but in order to achieve this they need information. Women coming for breast diagnosis differ not only as far as being symptomatic or not, but also for age, health literacy, level of anxiety and fear, previous experiences with illness. There must be time for dialogue: to communicate results, to explain our diagnostic workup, obtain informed consent, explain causes of false diagnosis, show care and empathy in case of \"bad news\". This will not avoid the invitations women receive from the media and the web for a review of their results, will not change the very easy to apply hindsight analysis -no matter the bias -or pure mathematical concepts on cancer doubling time.",

Diagnosis and characterization of fat in the liver is a diagnostic challenge because with most diagnostic techniques the presence of fat in the liver will significantly impair the quality of the examination. MRI offers significant advantages in that setting. There are two basic MR techniques that can be used to detect and characterize fatty lesions in the liver: Chemical shift imaging and fat saturation techniques. Chemical shift imaging techniques take advantage of the difference in resonance frequency between triglycerides and water protons. In in-phase images the signal from water and lipid protons is additive leading to a high signal intensity of fatty lesions. In opposed-phase images tissues containing fat and water show a significant loss of signal because the signal from water cancels the signal from fat. Liver steatosis is defined as an abnormal accumulation of triglycerides within hepatocytes. US and CT examinations are severly impaired in case of steatosis and the ability to detect focal lesions is decreased. Both focal fatty change and focal sparing of the liver parenchyma may have troublesome appearance that may lead to a misdiagnosis of hepatic mass. MRI can readily differentiate these lesions from other tumoral lesions because focal fatty change is hyperintense on in phase sequences and hypointense on opposed phase sequences. The differential diagnosis of incidental fat-containing liver lesions includes focal fatty change, hepatic lipoma, angiomyolipoma, liver cell adenoma and hepatocellular carcinoma. In the setting of chronic liver disease a fat containing focal liver lesion is highly suggestive of HCC. Pulmonary infections are among the most frequent causes of morbidity and mortality throughout the world. In the non-immunocompromised-population, pneumonia is one of the top two infectious diseases and represents the most prevalent community-acquired infection (CAP). Nosocomial pneumonia (NP) is the leading cause of death from infection acquired in the hospital. In CAP, most individuals are infected through person-to-person transmission of microorganisms bound to or suspended in water-mucus droplets. NP is the result of aspiration of gastric contents or contaminated oropharyngeal secretions. Infections in CAP are commonly caused by gram-positive bacteria, atypical bacteria, and viruses. The most important pathogens in NP include aerobic gramnegative organisms and staphylococcus aureus. Viruses, protozoa, and fungi play an increasing role in patients with impaired defense mechanisms. In CAP and NP, the typical radiologic findings include lobar pneumonia, bronchopneumonia (lobular pneumonia), and rarely, diffuse bilateral interstitial disease. Nodules may be seen in mycobacterial infections. Complications include necrosis, cavitation, bronchopleural fistula, and pleural effusions. In both entities, the role of radiology includes detection and exclusion of pulmonary infiltrates (which may be difficult in NP), narrowing of the differential diagnosis, guidance of additional (invasive) procedures, and patient follow-up. Pulmonary infection is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with impaired immune function. In the last several decades, AIDS epidemic, advances in the treatment of cancer, organ transplantation and immunossupresive therapy has resulted in large numbers of patients who develop abnormalities in their immune system. High-resolution CT can be helpful in the detection, differential diagnosis and management of immunocompromised patients with pulmonary complications. The most common patterns seen at HRCT in acute pulmonary infections in these patients include nodules, tree-in-bud appearance, ground-glass attenuation, consolidation and airway disease. A systematic approach to the radiological evaluation of these patients is essential and includes not only HRCT pattern recognition, but integration of available demographic, clinical and laboratory information.",

A \"tree-in-bud\" pattern was first described in diffuse panbronchiolitis and endobronchial spread of tuberculosis; however, this appearance can also be seen in bacterial, fungal, and viral infections. Ground glass attenuation is a common but nonspecific HRCT finding. In AIDS patients, PCP is the commonest cause of this pattern.

NTM organisms are often overlooked as potential infecting organisms, diagnosis is often delayed and radiologists tend not to include NTM in their differential diagnosis. The literature on the imaging appearances of NTM pulmonary infections is now sufficiently large as to identify some features that would help to distinguish an NTM infection from conventional pulmonary tuberculosis (TB), allowing the radiologist at least to raise the possibility of NTM infection. This review is intended to describe the radiological features in the immunocompetent host, that accompany TB and NTM pulmonary infections and highlight the imaging features that would favour an NTM as the causative organism. A-070 B. Adult non-glial brain tumors A. Drevelegas; Thessaloniki/GR Non-glial brain tumors of adults include: meningeal and mesenchymal tumors, neuronal and mixed neuronal-glial tumors, cranial nerve tumors, hemopoietic neoplasms and pituitary tumors. Meningiomas and acoustic schwannomas are the most common non-glial tumors. These brain tumors produce symptoms and signs due to tissue destruction, local brain infiltration, or secondary effects of increased intracranial pressure. The symptoms of patients are dependent on the anatomic location of the tumor. Headache is the first symptom and with growth of the tumor, is present in the majority of the patients. Focal cerebral signs or seizures may also occur. In the evaluation of patients with brain tumors CT and MRI represent the two most important and commonly used imaging modalities. They have a significant impact on patients care. The technical improvement of CT and MRI and the introduction of new imaging techniques (SPECT, PET, fMRI) have significantly improved the detection and the evaluation of brain neoplasms. The goal of this lecture is to identify the adult non-glial brain tumors, to determine the role of imaging in the evaluation of patients with brain tumors and to show how to use the available information in order to determine the location and the extent of the tumor, to identify complications, to establish a differential diagnosis spectrum and to provide a non-invasive assessment of lesion grade. This information is very important and crucial in deciding between the different forms of therapy such as surgery, radiation and chemotherapy. Learning Objectives:",

Primary brain tumors are more common in the first decade than in the second; the peak incidence is between 4 and 8 years of age. Neoplasms under the age of two years are uncommon. About 400 children will be diagnosed of having a brain tumour in Germany each year. About half of them are located in the supratentorial region. Slightly less than half of all supratentorial tumors are astrocytoms, most are pilocytic or low-grade in origin. The optic chiasmatic-hypothlamic area is the most common location. Craniopharyngiomas represent another eighth of supratentorial neoplasms in children. Ganglioglioma, ependymoma, oligodendroglioma, meningioma and miscellaneous other uncommon tumors account for the remainder. About one third of posterior fossa tumos are cerebellar astrocytomas, and one third to one quarter are PNET/medulloblastomas. Brainstem gliomas represents another quarter, one eighth are ependymomas. Most cerebellar astrocytomas are pilocytic astrocytomas; intrinsic pontine gliomas are infiltrative and are malignant regardless of their histology at time of biopsy. Medullary gliomas behave more benignly. More than 90% of medulloblastomas (posterior fossa PNET) arise in the vermis. About 7% are found in the cerebellar hemisphere. Despite the fact that brain tumours are the most common solid tumour in childhood they are very heterogeneous, regarding clinical symptoms, pathology, treatment and prognosis. Imaging studies play an important role for diagnosis and follow-up. Head and neck cancer is uncommon, accounting for only 3% of newly diagnosed cancers per annum. Benign disease far outweighs malignant disease in general ear, nose and throat surgical practice and the radiologist has an important role in alerting the clinician to the possibility of underlying malignancy. Some \"benign\" presentations, for example middle ear effusions, sinus opacity and cystic neck masses, may indicate underlying malignancy and the radiologist needs to be aware of these potential pitfalls.",

The radiologist must be aware of local treatment protocols so that imaging is tailored to evaluate the critical radiological features which may affect the treatment offered to the patient. The status of the cervical lymph nodes is the single most important prognostic factor. Clinical assessment is generally regarded as inaccurate (sensitivity and specificity 60-70%) and radiological staging is used to increase accuracy. It has a particular role in upstaging disease in the clinically negative neck and the detection of contralateral disease, both of which will affect therapy.

The nasopharynx forms an important boundary zone between the anterior and middle skull base and the parapharyngeal space. Diagnostic imaging is used in this region for morphologic evaluation, localization and staging of primary lesions of the nasopharynx. The nasopharynx forms the upper portion of the pharynx and is continuous anteriorly with the nasal cavity. The roof is formed by the sphenoid bone, while the floor and junction with the oropharynx are at the level of the soft palate. The pharygeal recess (Rosenm\u00fcller fossa) is a pouch-like recess in the lateral wall of the nasopharynx directed toward the parapharyngeal space and lying directly adjacent to the eustachian tube orifice. This region is a common site of origination for nasopharyngeal malignancies. Five percent of all malignant tumors of the head and neck originate in the nasopharynx and more than 90% of these are carcinomas. MRI is extremely helpful to demonstrate the extent of a mass in three dimensions and, most importantly, MRI can define the relationship of the mass to cranial nerves V, IX and X. However multidetector CT (MDCT) is also helpful in the evaluation of the nasopharynx, especially if multiplanar reconstructions are used.

Therefore the radiologist plays a minor role in the detection of the disease but helps to define the exact extent of the lesion. Imaging plays an important role in therapeutic planning. The choice for the various type of surgery (partial or complete glossectomy, mandibulectomy) is dictated by invasion of the muscles of the tongue, neurovascular bundle of the tongue, as well as the various sub regions of the oropharynx (faucial area, soft palate, posterior oropharyngeal wall). Evaluation of the mandible is of paramount importance. Computed tomography and MR imaging are the imaging modalities of choice.

Deep tumoral spread is difficult to establish by direct laryngoscopy alone, so imaging modalities, including CT and/or MR are absolutely necessary to establish this staging. In this lecture, the tumoral appearance and deep spread at the levels of supraglottis, glottis and subglottis will be described on CT scan as well as on MR imaging. Respective role of these imaging modalities will be also discussed. Treatment of symptomatic patients with a carotid artery stenosis > 70% has been proven to be useful in 2 large prospective randomized trials. In these studies DSA was used to show the stenosis so this method became the gold standard. This method however is invasive, has a small complication rate and due to the limited number of projections, crossectional methods could be more reliable in showing the degree of stenosis.

The aim of this presentation is to discuss the latest developments and studies combined with personal experience concerning carotid artery stent placement in the treatment of carotid artery occlusive disease. Due to the high technical success rates of 98%, the few peri-and postinterventional complications, the relatively fast procedure in experienced hands and the high patency rates, carotid stenting has become a substitute for carotid endarterectomy for symptomatic patients, even with high medical comorbidities. Today only a few exclusion criteria for carotid stenting exist, like the floating thrombus and the pseudo-occlusion at the carotid bifurcation and the occlusion of the arterial access (iliac arteries and aorta). The use of distal embolic protection systems has decreased the complication rates for carotid stenting by approximately 50% to 2-4% for most major centers. With the new and improved technologies concerning stent design, guiding catheters and cerebral protection devices, carotid stenting has become an option also for asymptomatic patients, especially those with high surgical risk. Early results for patency and neurological follow-up in these asymptomatic patients group have also been encouraging. Learning Objectives: 1. In experienced centers carotid artery stenting is currently a safe and reliable treatment for symptomatic, even at high-risk patients. 2. Cerebral protection devices should be used for the procedure.

Contraindications: Coagulopathy, extensive vertebral body destruction, significant compromise of the neural canal. Method: Percutaneous injection of polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) into the fractured vertebral body for the dual purpose of analgesia and stabilization.

Adherence to rigid patient selection criteria is essential to ensure clinical success.

            "text": "1. To understand the role of minimally invasive image guided treatment for spine instability due to osteoporosis. It consists of a direct puncture of the concerned area using a 10-15 G needle followed by an injection of bone cement into the weakened parts of the bone. The injection is performed under fluoroscopic control and the cement is set to harden within 7-10 min. During the injection, close watch on the draining veins is advised to avoid leakage of cement to nearby compartments where contact with the temporarily heated cement (PMMA, exothermic reaction) may lead to irritations. Leakage also may lead to pulmonary embolism. If leakage accounts for most complications, other risks include allergic reaction to bone cement, procedural complications related to needle positioning, or anaesthesia complications. To reduce the risk of leakage, we advocate using the injection of contrast material prior to the cement injection. In our experience, this predicts reliably the areas of leakage and allows to adjust the cement injection technique accordingly. In our experience of over 400 patients treated, the majority of lesions were oncologic, followed by osteoporosis, rarely due to vertebral hemangioma and nonpathological fracture. Overall, vertebroplasty has an immediate and lasting success rate of approximately 90%. Treatment failure may be related to not treating patients at all levels involved (multiple lesions) or for pain which can not be treated by vertebroplasty, such as due to associated degenerative spine lesions or due to retroperitoneal tumour spread. Complications are seen rarely (overall less than 2%, with a higher incidence in oncological patients). The diagnosis of osteomyelitis remains a difficult diagnostic dilemma. In this review, that is particularly aimed at those whose practice does not include a large pediatric population, we will review the pathophysiology of pediatric osteomyelitis and contrast that with the available imaging modalities. What we can do and the use of each modality will be the focus of part 1. Secondly, we will review the different clinical scenarios such as acute, subacute and chronic, as well as specific forms of osteomyelitis. The latter will include subacute chronic ostemyelitis, toxic synovitis, spondylodiscitis as well as the congenital inflammatory disorders such as rubella and syphylis. The most useful imaging findings to look for and their significance will be assessed and we will evaluate their usefulness in each case. Close cooperation between clinicians and imagers remains the key to early and adequate diagnosis of pediatric osteomyelitis. Learning Objectives: 1. To review the pathophysiology of pediatric inflammatory musculoskeletal disease as a whole. 2. To discuss how to optimally image the changes caused by the inflammatory process. 3. To assess how to practically and efficiently structure the imaging sequence for optimal contribution to the therapeutic process. The presentation is based on a three year longitudinal study of the implementation of PACS in the region of Scania, Sweden. The implementation can be seen as a part of building a common network (HIS) for the entire healthcare. Such a system makes it possible to deepen and develop different cooperation-constellations and change the functional infrastructure. A introduction to a PACS environment is not a change for just the X-ray departments, but for the whole hospital. It seems to be one of the most dramatic changes in radiology (Osteaux, 1997). In spite of this there is still a lack of knowledge of how this change effects the organisation and the professions in radiology.",

This is very natural because PACS is very technically complicated and is still under development. Another aspect is the cost-benefit (Bryan et al, 1999). It seems like the arguments for the introduction of PACS have changed, from a tool to decrease costs in radiology to a medium to increase the efficiency. Large investments are necessary, and this makes the digital examinations still more expensive then the analogous examinations. Published articles show, not surprisingly, a wide range of results, from large savings to that you never get back made investments (Arenson, 2000). Many authors show a need to that PACS is analysed not only from economical and technical aspects, but also that it is important that organisational aspects will be illuminated (van Gennip, 1996 & Foord, 1999 . Further aspects that speak for this is that PACS is to compensate an, what many thinks, already well functioning organisation of handling images in a radiology department. Learning Objectives: 1. Identify the process of change: What are the obstacles and possibilities, and how is it experienced? 2. See different ways and outcomes of the process.",

However, dose incurred with CT studies accounts for a significant proportion of medically induced diagnostic exposure. It is important to optimize CT examinations and develop tools for patient dose reduction. Digital techniques may deliver lower doses to the patient compared to conventional techniques, providing that digital technology is used effectively. The correct use of the characteristic curve of digital detectors and the proper utilisation of processing capabilities of computers are prerequisites for optimisation of \"digital\" examinations. Due to the complexity of the interventional procedures, the screening time involved may be long. Thus, doses to patients and staff for interventional radiology may be high. Occupational doses can be reduced by reducing unnecessary patient dose, correct use of equipment and the application of radiation protection measures. Irradiation of unborn children do occur in clinical practice, either accidentally or because of urgency. These cases require estimation of dose and risk to the conceptus and proper management of the patient. Lack of knowledge may lead to unnecessary termination of pregnancies. Four speakers will cover the above topics discussing optimization strategies for MSCT examinations and application of new techniques for patient dose reduction such as mA modulation; the effective use of digital technology for minimization of patient dose; strategies for radiation protection of personnel exposed during interventional procedures; issues relating to the exposure of the pregnant patient to diagnostic X-rays.

This includes tube current modulation and noise-reducing image reconstruction approaches. The necessary concept for the future is an automatic exposure control (AEC) for CT.

In film-screen radiology an overexposure results in a too dark film. This is not the case in digital radiology due to the wide dynamic range of the detectors and the possibility of adjusting the image on a computer. A high dose can in fact result in better image quality (less noise), however, better than is actually necessary and in contradiction to the ALARA principle (The dose should be kept As Low As Reasonably Achievable). A low-dose (\"underexposed\") image does not have to be retaken. Instead it can be adjusted by post-processing (window/level) and still be used for diagnosis (if the noise in the image isn't too high). It is of utmost importance that image quality is followed in the optimization process so the resulting images are not of inferior quality, depending on the type of examination and the referral question. The EU criteria of good image quality can be used here. Examples will be given of some ways to optimise digital fluoroscopy (upper and lower gastro-intestinal system and paediatrics) and coronary angiography. In digital radiography, examples will be given from urography (going from film-screen to image phosphor plate to flat panel detector) and pelvis.

Vano; Madrid/ES Occupational doses in interventional procedures guided by fluoroscopy are the highest doses registered among medical staff using X-rays. If protection tools and good operational measures are not used, and if several complex procedures are undertaken per day, radiation lesions may result after several years of work. Training in radiation protection (RP) and personal dosimetry are key issues. New interventional systems are sophisticated; however, a lack of RP knowledge and the detailed operation of these systems can sometimes prevent interventionalists from gaining their full advantage. The use of two personal dosimeters is recommended. Some practical advice to improve staff RP can be stated: to increase distance from the patient, use suspended screen and other personal shielding tools available, minimize the use of fluoroscopy and use low fluoroscopy modes, acquire only the necessary number of images per series and limit the number of series, consider the size of the patient and the position of the X-ray tube, collimate the X-ray beam to the area of interest, and a final general recommendation: be aware of the RP of your patient and you will also be improving your own occupational protection. But correlation between patient and staff radiological risks is not simple. Learning Objectives: 1. To realise that occupational radiation risk during interventional procedures can be quite high. 2.

Damilakis; Iraklion/GR Sometimes women are irradiated at the beginning of their pregnancy before they are aware of their condition. After these accidental exposures, radiological physicists are requested to estimate the dose and risk to the unborn child. The anticipation of dose and risk to the conceptus is also necessary for a woman who is known to be pregnant for whom a diagnostic X-ray examination is considered to be beneficial. Then, the conceptus dose should be estimated so that physicians can take decisions about performing or delaying a study or carrying out an alternative examination. Prenatal doses from examinations of areas remote from the unborn child are very low (< 1 mSv). In such cases, accurate estimation of dose to the conceptus is not necessary. When diagnostic X-ray examinations involving the abdomen or pelvis are carried out to pregnant patients, doses to the conceptus may be considerably higher than 1 mSv. Then, accurate estimation of conceptus dose is possible using methods developed for that purpose. Doses to the conceptus below 100 mSv should not be considered a reason for termination of pregnancy. Deterministic effects of in utero irradiation have a threshold of 100 mSv or higher. This dose is higher than that expected from the vast majority of diagnostic X-ray examinations. Stochastic effects (carcinogenic and hereditary effects) of radiation are possible but, when the conceptus dose is low, these risks are minimized.

The presence of calcium in pulmonary and pleural lesions does not imply that such lesions are inactive. 3. Computed tomography is an essential complement to conventional radiography in the detection and analysis of pleural and pulmonary calcifications. CT is the imaging modality of choice in the assessment of patients with clinical or radiographic findings suggestive of aortic injury, bone fracture, or diaphragmatic tear following blunt chest trauma. The use of multislice CT allows for rapid examination of the thorax and adjacent anatomical regions, while providing thin section images. Optimal CT assessment requires optimal technique, including the use of iv contrast material and multiplanar and 3D reconstructed images, as well as an awareness of potential pitfalls. CT has greater sensitivity than radiography in the detection of pulmonary lacerations and pneumothoraces. Contrast-enhanced volume CT allows detection of both subtle and more obvious aortic tears. Tracheobronchial tears appear at CT and radiography with persistent pneumothorax, pneumomediastinum, subcutaneous emphysema, \"fallen lung\" sign, and malposition of endotracheal tube. The ruptured diaphragm, which tears more often on the left, appears asymmetric, irregular, or discontinuous, with herniation of bowel or viscera into the chest. CT provides visualization of thoracic spine fractures and assessment of suspected sternal fractures or sternoclavicular dislocation. The availability of new imaging modalities has altered the diagnostic approach to patients with abdominal and pelvic trauma. CT and ultrasound have largely replaced diagnostic peritoneal lavage. Ultrasound is used in most trauma centers as the initial imaging technique for the detection of hemoperitoneum and helps to determine the need for emergency laparotomy. CT allows for an accurate diagnosis of a wide range of traumatic abdominal and pelvic conditions. The speed of single-slice helical and multi-detector row CT (MDCT) permits a rapid CT examination of the seriously ill patient in the emergency room. In particular, the technology of MDCT permits multiple, sequential CT scans to be quickly obtained in the same patient, which is a great advance in the rapid assessment of the multiple injured patient. The evolving concepts in trauma care promoting non-operative management of liver and splenic injuries creates the need for follow-up cross-sectional imaging studies in these patients.

Theumann; Lausanne/CH Pelvic trauma includes a great variety of very polymorphous lesions, differing from each other by their anatomical aspect, their context and therapeutic implication: In order to be efficient, the radiologist first has to know the diagnostic value of each radiological technique, in order to suggest the investigation strategy ap-propriate to any clinical situation. Then, he must be able to accurately describe fractures and to include them into a classification in agreement with the clinician. Pelvic fractures form a polymorphous group. In the isolated acetabular fractures, function is mainly at stake. Radiological assessment relies upon good-quality plain films completed by CT imaging in fine slices with multiplanar reconstruction. Letournel's classification remains the reference standard. Management consists mainly of re-establishing a joint congruence to prevent early coxarthrosis. Pelvic fractures often occur in violent trauma and are associated with visceral lesions, putting vital prognosis at stake. Radiological assessment must be included in multidisciplinary management and CT imaging stands for the most complete and least time-consuming device, allowing for investigation of both visceral and osseous lesions. In cases of hemodynamic shock, external fracture stabilization and embolization of pelvic bleeding are preponderant. Tile/Association for Osteosynthesis classification is the most used presently. It allows good description of mechanisms and lesions and more adapted management. Imaging studies may be performed in patients with suspected or definite arthritis to: * determine the presence of an arthritis * establish a diagnosis * determine the extent of disease * assess disease activity * evaluate progression * select patients for surgery * determine the type of surgical proceedure This talk will concentrate on the radiological differential diagnosis of an inflammatory arthritis. This is achieve most effectively by: * determining what tissue within a joint is primarily affected * identifying which joints are involved For a radiological analysis there are esentially three sites of involvement within a joint that can be differentiated: * the \"bare\" area, where synovium directly contacts bone * hyaline cartilage and the immediate subchondral bone * the enthesis Once the principal site of involvement has been determined a series of further questions need to be asked: A. Synovial disease. Symmetrical or asymmetrical soft tissue swelling. Erosionswell defined, ill defined, proliferative or non-proliferative. B. Cartilage disease. Loss of cartilage, thickening of cartilage or calcification of cartilage. Secondary bone changes. C. Entheseal disease. Non-erosive or erosive. Symmetrical or asymmetrical. Using this combination of binary analysis in conjuction with the distribution of joint involvement a specific diagnosis or short differential diagnosis of an arthritis can usually be made. The group of seronegative joint disorders encompasses the great group of seronegative spondylarthopaties (SpA) in addition to rheumatoid factor negative rheumatoid and juvenile arthritis, and other more rare disorders. Imaging of SpA, especially in the early stage of the disease, has improved during the last years by the use of MRI. The increased diagnostic sensitivity and specificity for diagnosing SpA are mainly due to a better diagnostic accuracy regarding involvement of the sacroiliac joint (SIJ). MRI gives the possibility of visualising both joint destruction and signs of disease activity, and can detect inflammatory SIJ disorder before it has resulted in osseous destruction visible at radiography and CT. Furthermore MRI can be of help in differentiating between the different forms of SpA including ankylosing spondylitis, psoriatic, reactive, enteropathic, pustulotic and unclassifiable arthropathy, and gives the potential for monitoring disease during therapy. MRI may also be valuable with regard to the detection of early spinal lesions, in addition to evaluation of discovertebral or other lesions later in the disease. More recently it has been demonstrated that the suppression of disease activity will slow or even halt progression of bone damage although there was poor correlation between clinical response and radiological change in these studies. Such clinical and radiographic observations, where synovitis and bone damage are seemingly independent processes, have been supported by experimental models of RA where joint damage may be uncoupled from synovitis. However, all studies have used either indirect or insensitive measures of synovitis and bone damage or have imaged complex joints such as the wrist which makes interpretation of any imaging findings difficult. An understanding of the inter-relationship between synovitis and bony damage is critical for the optimal management of patients, especially in determining a logical approach for drug treatment, and provides the model for all disease where chronic inflammation is a prominant feature. This lecture focuses on the use of MRI and ultrasound in the assessment of rheumatoid disease with specific emphasis on the detection and potential impact of diagnosing subclinical synovitis, pre-radiographic erosion and complications. A list of relevant references will be provided. Learning Objectives: 1. The relationships between imaging abnormalities and the rheumatoid disease process. 2. The diagnostic and therapeutic impact of imaging in the rheumatoid patient. Colorectal diseases are so common that any radiologist should be familiar with occurrences like tumors, obstruction or inflammation. A renewed interest in this field was brought by the onset of high resolution ultrasound, multislice CT and MRI. These methods proved useful in the screening and/or detection of tumors (CT colonography), presurgical staging (MRI of rectal tumors), and evaluation of inflammatory disease activity (US, CT and MRI). CT, associated with PET, is another recent advance in the case of the cancer patient, and soon in the field of inflammatory disease. Not all results are yet validated and clinical strategy remains to be discussed, but it is very clear now that colorectal imaging is going to be complementary to endoscopy in many clinical situations, although technique and interpretation of these examinations may not be so simple, and the quality of images might heavily rely on the radiologist's skill. This is why a special focus session is dedicated to colorectal imaging. Practical tips, image interpretation, clinical strategy, as well as future developments will be presented during this session.

Much like CT, sonography has the ability to evaluate the bowel wall itself as well as the adjacent mesentery and peritoneal fat. Sonographic findings in many colonic disorders are non specific and therefore multiple pathological processes may present with the same pattern. Nevertheless sonographic evaluation of the colon can be quite rewarding and it is important for sonographers to recognize the colonic origin of the sonographic findings in order to provide a definitive diagnosis and to appropriately guide further investigations.

Catalano; Rome/IT Magnetic resonance imaging is still in most centers under-utilized in the assessment of abdominal diseases and even more in the evaluation of the gastro-intestinal tract. Nevertheless recent technical developments now allow routine 3D acquisition, at high resolution, of large anatomical tracts, avoiding respiratory artifacts. Magnetic resonance imaging can exploit, as compared to other modalities, its great intrinsic contrast which can provide excellent visualization of colon walls and relationship with surrounding structures. Image analysis is crucial also in MR imaging, in order to achieve all the neccessary information and avoid misinterpretation errors. In this session, I will go through the technical details, including the basic hardware requirements, the main sequences and modalities of acquisition, patient preparation and data set evaluation. I will also discuss the possibilities and limitations of MR imaging in the evaluation of benign and malignant diseases of the colon and rectum. Practical hints will be given especially to avoid common practical problems. Review of the literature and economic problems will also be reviewed. Finally, based on technical and clinical advantages and limitations, indications to MR imaging of the colon will be given. During the last few years cardiac MRI has become almost the modality of choice for myocardial viability assessment. Cardiac MRI showed a similar sensitivity and specificity even in comparison to the so called \"gold standard\" of viability assessment, F-18 FDG-PET (1), with the introduction of the easy to perform method of \"delayed enhancement\" 10 -20 minutes after the administration of Gd-DTPA intravenously (2) . Whereas myocardial perfusion analysis, both with qualitative (visual) and semiquantitative assessment, has still to prove its reliability for the primary diagnosis of coronary heart disease (3). The different methods of stress testing in MRI (dobutamine -adenosine) with wall motion and perfusion analysis to detect myocardial ischemia will be described as well as different methods of viability assessment. Furthermore, different approaches to analyse the achieved data and its pitfalls will be discussed.

Bremerich; Basel/CH Positron emission tomography (PET) and single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) are well established for imaging of myocardial perfusion and viability, they are considered the gold standard.

The addition of colour and pulsed Doppler sonography has contributed to assessing tumour involvement of vascular structures such as the portal and mesenteric system. However, a sonographic diagnosis of suspected pancreatic disease depends on patient-related factors and is not always straightforward. Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) eliminates the problem of overlying bowel gas and allows for focussed high-resolution imaging. This technique is well suited to detect vascular invasion and EUS-guided fine-needle aspiration biopsy can further increase the diagnostic accuracy in pancreatic cancer. When compared to US the performance of computed tomography (CT) is less operator-and patient-dependent.

In other words MRI can provide all information required to differentiate resectable from unresectable tumours. Chronic pancreatitis is a common pathology with an essentially clinical diagnosis. This disease, besides creating an increased risk of the onset of ductal adenocarcinoma, sometimes shares similar aspects at imaging. The problem of differential diagnosis between the various forms of chronic pancreatitis and tumors often arises in daily practice. The segmentary form of chronic pancreatitis, focal autoimmune pancreatitis, and the solid variant of cystic dystrophy of the duodenal wall (aka \"groove pancreatitis\"), can especially mimic a ductal adenocarcinoma. Recognition of these inflammatory forms, or at least suspicion of them and their subsequent classification by needle aspiration, radically modifies the therapeutic approach. It is even more difficult to recognize a ductal adenocarcinoma arising in chronic pancreatitis. Finally, the problem of the differential diagnosis between chronic obstructive pancreatitis and intraductal papillary mucinous tumor of the main duct often occurs. Learning Objectives: 1. To describe the pathological aspects of chronic pancreatitis and pancreatic tumors. 2.

The \"classic\" ductal adenocarcioma of the pancreas accounts for about 80% of all pancreatic tumors, with important variants such as mucinous noncystic carcinomas (1 -3%), adenosquamous carcinomas (3 -4%), and undifferentiated (anaplastic) carcinomas (2 -7%) adding another 10% to the ductal tumors. These latter tumours together with endocrine tumors (2%), mucinous cystic tumors (2%), intraductal papillary-mucinous tumors (1%), serous cystadenomas (1%), acinar cell carcinomas (1%), solid-pseudopapillary tumors (1%), pancreatoblastoma (< 0.5%) and other rare entities represent the \"uncommon\" pancreatic tumors. Some of these uncommon tumors may mimic the clinical findings and appearance in imaging of ductal adenocarcinomas. Nevertheless, the knowledge of specific imaging features of the uncommon pancreatic tumors may help to differentiate them from the classic ductal carcinomas. This can especially be crucial because some of these tumors present a much better prognosis than the, in general, dismal prognosis of ductal adenocarcinomas of the pancreas, while others do not need therapy at all. Collapse is defined as a state in which lung tissue has undergone complete atelectasis. Evaluation of patients with radiographic suspicion of lobar collapse represents one of the most important daily challenges for the radiologist. A wide range of abnormalities has been described characterizing the appearance of lobar or segmental collapse as well as secondary changes. Conventional chest radiography remains the most commonly performed study although CT has proved to be an essential adjunct to routine radiography. Lobar collapse results from different mechanisms: Resorption or obstructive atelectasis, resulting from endobronchial obstruction; compression or passive atelectasis, which is collapse caused by extrinsic compression, such as from pleural fluid or air, or the presence of any space-occupying intrathoracic lesion resulting in extrinsic compression of adjacent parenchyma; cicatrization atelectasis, resulting from parenchymal fibrosis; and adhesive atelectasis, which is collapse resulting from loss of surfactant. The presentation highlights concepts and signs that are important in assessing the presence or absence of lobar collapse. The signs discussed and presented include opacity of the collapsed lobe, hilar vascular alterations, hilar bronchial alterations, compensatory overinflation, fissural alterations, juxtaphrenic peak and rounded atelectasis. Learning Objectives: 1. To describe the main anatomical landmarks for understanding the mechanisms of lobar collapse. 2. To review the most common radiographic signs of lobar and segmental collapse. 3. To emphasize the role of CT as a useful adjunct in the diagnosis of lobar collapse.",

Careful analysis of the radiographic pattern and its distribution taken in conjunction with ancillary radiographic and clinical features permit a limited differential diagnosis to be advanced. In patients with evidence of diffuse lung disease on the chest radiograph, HRCT is often required being both more sensitive and accurate. Acute and chronic disease should be considered separately. Acute causes of diffuse pulmonary opacities include: Pneumonia, pulmonary oedema, pulmonary haemorrhage, and drug reactions. The radiographic pattern, its distribution and associated features often enable the correct diagnosis to be suggested. For example, although consolidation is non-specific, a perihilar distribution with cardiomegaly and septal lines is typical of hydrostatic pulmonary oedema. Similarly, a linear or reticular pattern in a febrile patient is suggestive of viral or mycoplasma pneumonia. In chronic disease the radiographic pattern and its distribution also form the basis for diagnosis and associated radiographic features permit refinement of the differential diagnosis. For example reticulonodular opacities with a peripheral distribution are typical of usual interstitial pneumonia but if pleural plaques are present asbestosis is more likely. In contrast central, peribronchovascular, reticulonodular opacities, particularly in the presence of lymphadenopathy are typical of sarcoidosis.",

Differentiation of pulmonary from mediastinal masses is easily made by knowing basic semiology (pregnancy sign). To facilitate the differential diagnosis among different pathologies it is convenient to divide the mediastinum into different areas (thoracic outlet, anterior middle and posterior, including supra and infravascular compartments).

Cognard; Toulouse/FR Cerebral aneurysms are considered to be one of the major causes of subarachnoidal or intracerebral hemorrhage. Aneurysm rupture is one of the more common and unfortunate presentations of cerebral aneurysms. Unruptured cerebral aneurysms may be discovered when they cause neurological symptoms which depend on the location and size of the aneurysm. The diagnosis of a cerebral aneurysm is usually confirmed with an angiogram. Recent advances in CT and MRI scanning allow these techniques to also help diagnose aneurysms, but an angiogram or recently introduced 3-D angiogram usually provides the most detail of an aneurysm's size and location. For unruptured aneurysms, the goal of treatment is to prevent aneurysm rupture or growth. For ruptured aneurysms, the goal of treatment is to prevent further bleeding (\"rebleeding\"). Endovascular treatments for cerebral aneurysms have developed in recent years and can provide partial or complete treatment of many aneurysms. At present, they are regarded as an alternative to surgical clipping. The most commonly used embolic materials are detachable metallic coils deployed inside the sac of the aneurysm. In difficult cases such as wide necked or giant aneurysms, the balloon-assisted technique (\"remodelling\") or intracranial stent placement at the level of the neck are used.

The clinical presentation of renovascular disease can range from no hypertension to severe hypertension with progressive loss of renal function. A renal artery stenosis can be found independent of the clinical presentation. However, the majority of patients with hypertension do not have any renovascular disease. Only 3% -5% of patients with hypertension have renovascular disease. The relation between a stenosis of the renal artery, the severity of the stenosis and hypertension remains unclear. There are no diagnostic tests to identify a significant renal artery stenosis. Following this, the outcome after treatment of a renal artery stenosis in a hypertensive patient is still unpredictable. Although in a subgroup of patients with fibromuscular dysplasia the outcome is more favorable and durable. The pros and cons of treating, by drugs or by intervention, renal artery stenosis in hypertension will be discussed in this workshop.

This occurs even though normal kidneys remain viable with blood flows and pressures below those required for glomerular filtration, because less than 10% of oxygen delivery is required for kidney tissue metabolism.

The use of self-expanding metallic stents (SEMS) in the palliation of dysphagia in patients with inoperable carcinoma of the oesophagus is well established. Almost half of patients benefit from palliative therapy rather than definitive surgery due to late presentation and advanced disease. Dysphagia is usually the first symptom experienced and without surgery it increases relentlessly. The main indication for placement of these stents is for alleviation of dysphagia. SEMS have been shown to be superior to radiotherapy, laser therapy and plastic endoprostheses in the palliation of dysphagia. The choice of available metallic stents is now large. Covered stents are superior at resisting tumour ingrowth than uncovered types but at the price of increased rates of migration. This complication is particularly frequent when the stents are used for the treatment of malignant strictures in the lower third of the oesophagus. Several advances in stent designs have been made including the availability of antireflux stents, coated stents and potentially retrievable stents. In our institution all oesophageal stents are placed in the radiology department under sedation and fluoroscopic control. The technique of stent insertion will also be illustrated and potential complications will be discussed. Whether or not a gastropexy is performed is slightly controversial, as many operators do not perform gastropexy. Newer developments include per oral placement of PEG tubes, which are more robust and have longer indwell times. De novo placement of button gastrostomy catheters have also been proposed. Button gastrostomies are low profile and do not clog but the balloon retention means that they do become dislodged. However, they can be easily replaced at the bedside. Gastrojejunal catheters are placed in patients with a history of hiatus hernia, aspiration or gastroparesis. The pylorus is cannulated with an angiographic catheter and a super-stiff guidewire is manipulated into the proximal jejunum. A long gastrojejunal catheter is then placed for gastrojejunal feeding. The interventional radiologist is in a unique position to offer placement of a number of different gastrostomy devices. The device to be used can be selected based on caregiver or patient preference. In childhood, tumors and tumor-like lesions of the neck are rare and they tend to be benign. Most of the median anterior neck masses represent congenital lesions (thyroglossal duct cysts, branchial cysts, dermoid cysts, lymphangiomas, cystic hygromas). The most common blastomatous lesions in children are laryngeal papillomatosis and haemangiomas. Less common benign blastomas are neurogenic tumors and tumors arising from major and minor salivary glands in children. The most common malignant tumors in the head and neck region are lymphomas and rhabdomyosarcomas. Lymph node-tumors (enlargements) -reactive and infectious -represent in the young and adult population very common abnormalities and account for a significant amount of lateral cervical masses. However, most of the soft tissue neck masses in the adult over the age of 40 are metastatic nodal lesions. First imaging modalities should be ultrasound. In thyroid abnormalities, a scintigraphic analysis is essential. Learning Objectives:",

Gassner; Innsbruck/AT Congenital anomalies of the female genital tract result from M\u00fcllerian duct anomalies and/or abnormalities of the urogenital sinus or cloaca. Failure of fusion of the M\u00fcllerian ducts results in a wide variety of fusion abnormalities of the uterus, cervix, and vagina. M\u00fcllerian duct abnormalities may occur alone or in association with urogenital sinus or cloacal malformations. Persistence of the cloaca is believed to be caused by an abnormal development of the dorsal part of the cloaca and the urorectal septum. Urogenital sinus malformations occur after the cloaca has been organized into the urogenital sinus and the anus. Early and complete assessment of the patients, including radiological and biochemical examinations, is mandatory to provide an optimal basis for treatment that will have a great influence on the quality of the patient's later life. Due to the close embryologic relationship between the urinary and the genital tract, malformations involving both organ systems are very common. Understanding the development of the urogenital system is necessary to comprehend the full spectrum of congenital anomalies of the female genitalia. This course reviews the appearance of developmental anomalies of the female urinary and genital tract and points out common associated malformations to allow an early and complete sonographic assessment of affected infant. Ovarian cysts are frequently seen during prenatal and postnatal pelvic ultrasound and have, therefore, been included in this course, although they are not closely related etiologically to the above-mentioned malformations and organ systems. In less than three decades AIDS has become one of the most devastating illnesses in human history. The AIDS epidemic differs from most others in many ways, has challenged conventional medical thinking and has broadened the boundaries of knowledge of human biology and medicine. The patterns of disease and pathological changes seen in AIDS patients can be perplexing and challenging, particularly in the medical imaging department. Although astonishing progress has been achieved during recent years in the treatment of patients afflicted with AIDS, with the introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), the epidemic still continues to spread. AIDS patients are no longer confined to a few specialized AIDS hospitals, and are now seen in general hospitals and clinics everywhere.The value of imaging of AIDS is well established. This CC provides a comprehensive overview of our current knowledge about radiologic imaging features of the wide range of gastrointestinal, hepatic, splenic, biliary and retroperitoneal manifestations in the immuno-compromised patient and how the role of modern medical imaging techniques and diagnosis and treatment can be applied. The imaging aspects (conventional double contrast gastrointestinal studies, ultrasound, CT and MR) of the diseases of the luminal gastrointestinal tract, liver, spleen, biliary tract and retroperitoneum will be systematically discussed. Candidiasis, herpes, cytomegalovirus, cryptosporidiosis, histoplasmosis, isosporiasis, salmonellosis, unusual mycobacterial and viral infections account for the majority of non-neoplastic disorders. This CC is not only comprehensive, but also practical and easy to apply to daily clinical problem solving. In this educational lecture the range of manifestations of tuberculosis (TB) of the abdomen will be discussed, including involvement of the gastrointestinal tract, the peritoneum, mesentery, omentum, abdominal lymph nodes, solid abdominal organs, the genital system and the abdominal aorta. Abdominal TB is a diagnostic challenge, particularly when pulmonary TB is absent. It may mimic many other abdominal diseases, both clinically and radiologically. An early correct diagnosis, however, is important in order to ensure proper treatment and a favourable outcome. Modern imaging is a cornerstone in the early diagnosis of abdominal TB and may prevent unnecessary morbidity and mortality. Generally, computed tomography (CT) appears to be the imaging modality of choice in the detection and assessment of abdominal tuberculosis, other than gastrointestinal TB. Barium studies remain superior for demonstrating mucosal intestinal lesions. Ultrasound (US) may be used for follow-up to monitor therapy response. The role of MRI has to be further defined. Ileocaecal involvement, free or loculated high density ascites with thin-mobile septa, omental thickening, a thickened and enhancing peritoneum, a misty mesentery and low density adenopathies, and focal hepatosplenic lesions are suggestive imaging findings demonstrated by either gastrointestinal series, US, CT and MRI. The diagnosis of abdominal TB should be considered if suggestive imaging findings are found in patients with a high clinical index of suspicion. Taking into consideration all clinical problems, adrenal disorders can be differentiated into two major scenarios: A smaller group of patients with clinical and laboratory findings of an adrenal endocrinopathy, and a second, much larger group of patients, with an incidental finding of enlargement of the adrenal glands. The diagnostic approach in these two groups is totally different; in the first category imaging methods are used for localization of an adrenal pathology, while in the second group the lesion is found in the course of a routine imaging examination or a staging work-up for a malignant primary tumor. Particularly among the non-hyperfunctioning adrenal lesions there are some conditions with a very low incidence that may pose serious differential diagnostic problems: Myelolipomas, adrenal granulomatous infections, cystic lesions (lymphangioma, cystic parasitic infections, pseudocysts), paragangliomas or lymphomas of the adrenal glands. Imaging features of these different entities will be presented and a differential diagnostic approach based on clinical and morphologic appearance will be discussed. For solid masses, problems concern the identification of small tumors, the differentiation among anatomical variants, the differentiation between some benign and malignant tumors. The contribution of colour-power Doppler and contrast media in the solution of the diagnostic difficulties will be illustrated. Problematic renal masses can be seen also with CT and MRI. Indeterminate renal masses on CT are due to very small size, internal septae, blood and debris. In addition, the differential diagnosis between some benign tumors (atypical angiomyolipoma and oncocytoma) and malignant tumors is difficult. MRI has similar difficulties but provides a higher contrast resolution enabling better characterization of hemorrhagic fluid content. Furthermore, with the use of dynamic sequences and gadolinium, MRI can demonstrate minimal enhancement in poorly vascularized tumors. The role of imaging in cervical spine trauma will be discussed including the methods of screening the acutely injured patient, strengths and weaknesses of imaging methods, types of fracture and injury, and potential pitfalls in interpretation. The material will be presented in an interactive way with audience participation and self assessment. Water diffusion MRI allows tissue structure to be probed and imaged at a microscopic scale well beyond the usual \"millimetric\" resolution, providing unique clues to the fine architecture of neural tissues, and to changes associated with various physiological or pathological states. The leading clinical application of diffusion MRI has been in the study of acute brain ischaemia. With its unmatched sensitivity, diffusion MRI provides some patients with the opportunity to receive suitable treatment at a stage when brain tissue might still be salvageable. Moreover, because diffusion is anisotropic in brain white matter, reflecting its organization in bundles of myelinated axonal fibres running in parallel, diffusion tensor MRI (DTI) can be used to map out the orientation in space of the white matter tracks in the brain. Fibre tracking, combined with functional MRI, opens a new window on the important issue of brain connectivity. Diffusion MRI is also a promising tool for the study of brain maturation and development, as well as functional disorders implying white matter. This session provides a basic introduction to the key physical concepts underlying diffusion MRI, as well as DTI and fiber tracking issues. Potential applications in the neurosciences and associated clinical fields, including psychiatry, will be highlighted. Learning Objectives: 1. To gain understanding of the general principles for obtaining diffusion MR images of the brain. 2. To become familiar with the main advantages and limitations of diffusion tensor MRI (DTI) and fiber tracking. 3. To identify clinical conditions in which DTI may be useful.",

Dietrich; Munich/DE Self-diffusion of molecules, i.e. their microscopic stochastic motion due to their thermal energy, can be measured with magnetic resonance (MR) methods. An important application is diffusion-weighted MR imaging (DWI) in vivo, because the diffusion of water molecules depends on tissue microstructure that is difficult to access with other non-invasive diagnostic methods. The basic principle of DWI is to add diffusion-sensitizing gradient pulses to MR imaging pulse sequences; this strategy can be employed for several different types of pulse sequences. In certain complex environments, the mobility of water molecules depends on the spatial direction, i.e. the diffusion is anisotropic. For instance, in muscle fibers or cerebral white matter, the mobility of water molecules is reduced in directions perpendicular to the fiber orientation. Therefore, several quantities are required to describe the magnitude, the degree of anisotropy, and the main directions of diffusion. This information is summarized in the so-called diffusion tensor. The diffusion tensor can be measured by repeated diffusion measurements in different spatial directions. Several acquisition schemes with different numbers of diffusion directions have been suggested in order to optimize the accuracy of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). Although it is possible to visualize the complete diffusion tensor information in each voxel, typically only certain aspects of the tensor are shown in different kind of parameter maps. The most common parameters visualized are the mean diffusivity, the fractional anisotropy, or the main diffusion direction. Learning Objectives:",

Jones; Bethesda, MD/US Introduction: Undoubtedly the hottest topic in the field of DT-MRI is that of fiber tracking or \"tractography\".The term \"tractography\" is used quite generally to describe a family of approaches for studying aspects of the trajectories of white matter pathways in vivo. In this presentation, we will review the two main classes of tractographic methods -\"streamline\" and \"probabilistic\" approaches and compare their relative strengths and weaknesses. Applications: To date, the technique of tractography has predominantly been used to reconstruct the trajectories of large well-defined white matter fasciculi although a limited number of cases have been reported in which the information obtained from tractography has been employed in neurosurgical planning and assessment and in some neuropsychiatric applications. These emerging applications will briefly be reviewed. Artefacts: One of the dangers of tractography is that it produces extremely visually-appealing pictures of tracts and consequently, it is tempting to treat each result as \"gospel\" -without any regard for potential artifacts. It is essential to realize that there are many sources of artifacts inherent in the technique and these will be discussed in depth. Tracking in different age groups: Finally, we will consider the implications of these artifacts for comparing tractography results in subjects of different ages, focusing in particular on the developing brain and what special problems might be presented in addition to those present in the adult brain. Learning Objectives: 1. To understand the basic tractography problem and become aware of the different approaches which have been used.",

Bozzali; Milan/IT Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) represents a powerful quantitative technique able to assess microscopic structural tissue characteristics and abnormalities. Its application to cerebral-vascular diseases and acquired brain injury can give additional information of diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic utility. CNS inflammatorydemyelinating diseases have found in DTI a new quantitative approach to assess the microscopic damage in both lesional and normal-appearing brain tissue, with potential applicability to future clinical trials. In neurodegenerative diseases, DTI and DTI-based-tractography might contribute to detect the different pathological substrates underlying a non-specific parenchyma loss. In brain tumours, DTItechniques may contribute to histological subtype characterization and assessing the involvement (infiltration, mass effect) of spared parenchyma in pre-operative planning. Similarly, macroscopically invisible areas of abnormal development might be detected in some epileptic syndromes. In psychiatric disorders (e.g. schizophrenia, major depression) DTI has been used to assess the integrity of white matter connections suggesting interesting patho-physiological insights and correlations with pharmacotherapy responsiveness. Finally, in Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease and HIV, preliminary DTI studies showed intriguing findings of potentially diagnostic, prognostic and monitoring value. Learning Objectives: 1. To comprehend the meaning of the main DTI applications to neurological and psychiatric disorders. 2. To overview some potential DTI applications to neurological clinical practice aiming to add diagnostic/prognostic information and to address the therapeutic approach. 3.

Desai; London/UK High resolution CT (HRCT) is rightly considered to be an important tool in the investigation of patients with suspected diffuse interstitial lung disease. Indeed, in some cases a diagnosis can be confidently established on the basis of HRCT features, and more invasive procedures such as surgical biopsy can be avoided. However, before this can occur, the radiologist needs to be mindful of the potential difficulties which may hamper the interpretation of HRCT signs. Deciding whether there is a real abnormality on HRCT is not always a straightforward exercise. This can be exemplified by the scenario in which the radiologist is judging whether or not there is ground-glass opacification in the lungs; the phase of respiration (e.g. a suboptimal inspiratory effort), exposure parameters (an inadequate mAs), and body habitus can significantly influence the density of lung parenchyma and lead to spurious reports of infiltrative lung disease. Movement artefacts can also lead to false positive diagnoses; the appearance of parallel linear opacities close to the heart and caused by cardiac motion may lead to an erroneous diagnosis of bronchiectasis. Because the technique is sensitive, subtle abnormalities are frequently seen and thus, a more important problem (particularly for the clinician), is judging when an abnormality reported on HRCT is clinically significant. The specific problems of HRCT diagnosis, highlighted above, will be discussed in the presentation. ",

Causes of noncardiac chest pain include aortic diseases, pulmonary embolism, pulmonary hypertension, pericarditis, pneumothorax, pneumomediastinum, esophageal disease, and chest wall disorders. Chest pain has also been described in patients with sickle cell disease and acute chest syndrome. The evaluation of patients presenting with chest pain is challenging for the clinicians. Although clinical history, physical examination, and the presence of risk factors are important in establishing the etiology of symptoms, imaging modalities are frequently utilized to confirm or to refute a provisional diagnosis. In fact, radiologists are commonly involved in the diagnostic work-up of patients with chest pain, particularly when a cardiac disease has been ruled out. This lecture focuses on noncardiac chest pain with a particular emphasis on aortic diseases and pleuro-parenchymal causes of acute chest pain. Children are not simply small adults and bone mineral density (BMD) measurements in childhood and adolescence are an extremely complex issue. Since bone size, shape and volumetric density vary substantially with age T-scores are of no use in this population. In addition timing of growth and puberty may also be variable. It is extremely important, however, to diagnose osteoporosis and osteopenia in these patients at an early stage since these deficits will translate into permanent deficits in bone mass in the adult. The ideal densitometric technique should (1) provide a low radiation exposure, (2) assess true volumetric BMD, (3) provide information on fracture risk and (4) be based on normative data collected from a representative healthy population with various age ranges. Such a technique, however, does not exist so far. Currently dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) is most frequently used, since it is fast, has a low radiation exposure and the best-established pediatric reference data. However, area BMD is extremely dependent on bone size, which may be a big handicap in children with accelerated or delayed development. Quantitative CT (QCT) provides true volumetric density but has a higher radiation dose and there are few reference data. Indications for bone densitometry in children and adolescents include chronic disorders such as anorexia nervosa, endocrine disorders as well as systemic diseases such as cystic fibrosis, rheumatoid arthritis, osteogenesis imperfecta and neoplastic diseases. In addition normal children with fractures due to low impact trauma and patients with the rare idiopathic juvenile osteopenia warrant study. For several years the role of imaging was primarily to confirm the diagnosis and to exclude other causes of neurological deficit. With the introduction of thrombolytic therapy, management can be dramatically affected depending on whether the stroke is haemorrhagic or thrombotic in origin. This has resulted in increasing pressure on radiology departments to provide rapid imaging within the first 24 hours and there is now pressure to reduce this timescale further. Traditionally, non-contrast enhanced CT has been the accepted optimum imaging method because of its speed, accuracy, relative low cost and accessibility.",

Traupe; Giessen/DE Two to 6 hours after acute stroke, post ischemic cytotoxic and vasogenic edema occurs which leads to a density decrease in the affected region. Early infarct signs are: blurring of the basal ganglia, decreased attenuation of the insular cortex, blurring of the gray-white matter junction and disappearance of insular or cortical sulci by tissue swelling. In about 15% of strokes, density increase indicating hemorrhage can be observed. Identification of degree and volume of early density changes (early infarct signs or hemorrhage) helps to decide if thrombolytic therapy of the middle cerebral artery is feasible. The basic CT examination without contrast helps to identify or exclude diseases mimicking acute stroke. In mammography reporting a classification, based on risk assessment is the cornerstone of good patient care, as it improves the clarity of the findings and leads to optimal interdisciplinary communication. The Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System TM (BI-RADS) has been developed and revised three times since 1992 by the American College of Radiology. It is not restricted to final assessment categories alone, but also attempts to unify morphologic descriptive features, follow-up, and outcome monitoring. It has now replaced the classification systems in all institutions with high quality breast imaging in the US. Utilization of the BI-RADS system in Europe is limited at present. This presentation will outline considerations needed in order to consider implementing the use of BI-RADS in the European community. There are distinct advantages: optimal inter-professional and inter-institutional communication, standardization of reporting, and ease of outcome monitoring. On the other side, sometimes fine-tuning, tailored to local conditions, is missing. Also interobserver variability can hamper good comparison. One can discuss some morphologic definitions as well as definitions with respect to outcome monitoring. They are undoubtedly well-suited for the American system of health care, but sometimes need some adaptations in situations or studies performed on other grounds.The system is the product of an excellent collaborative effort between members of various committees of the American College of Radiology, but should also be discussed on European level, before full acceptance can be achieved.

This requires that radiographers and radiologists involved in screening are adequately trained, have an ongoing professional development programme and carry out a sufficient volume of work to acquire and maintain expertise. Factors associated with optimal radiologist performance include total life time number of films read, annual volume of films read and access to regular feed back. Radiologists involved in screening should therefore read a minimum number of films per year, carry out screen reading and assessment and preferably also undertake symptomatic work. There is evidence from the UK screening programme that screening performance in small units is on average worse than performance in large units. This may be because larger units have individuals with higher volume work loads and have more fully integrated multidisciplinary teams. Quality assurance should be an integral part of any screening programme. For QA data to be meaningful individuals and units have to carry out a sufficient volume of work to allow adequate quality evaluation. Planning for screening should therefore involve the creation of large breast care teams who carry out both screening and symptomatic work and where the individuals within these teams devote sufficient time to breast work to develop and maintain expertise. The peritoneal cavity lies between the two layers of the peritoneum, namely the parietal, which covers the abdominal wall, and the visceral, which envelops hollow and solid viscera. Peritoneum is reflected over the abdominal viscera to form a series of folds -known as ligaments, mesenteries and omenta -that attach, suspend and interconnect them. These peritoneal reflections subdivide the peritoneal cavity into compartments, meanwhile providing continuity of anatomic sites. They may become routes for spread of intra-abdominal diseases -more commonly malignancies -but they may also act as boundaries for pathological processes, especially for infections and abscesses. Normal peritoneal folds are not directly visible on CT/ MRI, but they can be identified by their typical position and organ relationships, or by anatomic landmarks, namely their major constituent vessels. However, abnormal folds due to edema, inflammation, or neoplastic infiltration are directly seen on CT/MR images. Spread of infections is determined by peritoneal \"watershed\" areas and it is influenced by gravity, hydrostatic pressure gradients and bowel peristalsis. Neoplasms can disseminate by direct invasion, intraperitoneal seeding, lymphatic permeation and embolic hematogeneous spread. Direct invasion may be contiguous or non-contiguous along specific mesenteric reflections and ligaments to involve other intra-abdominal organs. Intraperitoneal seeding is influenced by dynamic circulation and pooling of intraperitoneal fluid and by the course of peritoneal reflections. Imaging, using tailored CT/MR examination protocols, is important in disclosing the primary site of the disease, in demonstrating patterns of disease extension, in differentiating pathologies with similar appearance and in planning surgical intervention. Learning Objectives: 1. Review the normal and pathologic anatomy and the imaging characteristics of peritoneal and mesenteric diseases. The retroperitoneal region is located between the posterior parietal peritoneum and the posterior abdominal wall. It contains the kidneys, the adrenal glands, the ureters, the duodenum, the ascending and the descending colon, the pancreas, the large blood vessels, lymph vessels and nodes, and nerves. Thanks to the fundamental work of Morton A. Meyers and other authors, the anatomy of the retroperitoneal region is now well understood and its subcompartments, delineated by fascial layers, have been identified.

The exact mechanism underlying this type of spread is currently under intense investigation. The lymphatic route is composed of lymph nodes and afferent and efferent lymphatic vessels. Lymph nodes in the abdomen are particularly numerous and lie within the subperitoneal space, the space beneath the peritoneum, forming discrete groups. Terminal groups are the pre-aortic, the lateral-aortic and the retroaortic group. These groups have their own large area of visceral drainage through intermediary groups of nodes representing steps of the natural lymph flow from the regional nodes of the abdominal organs to the cisterna chyli. Lymph vessels in the peritoneal cavity also course in the subperitoneal space, including the subperitoneal space of the peritoneal reflections i.e. ligaments, mesenteries and omenta. These anatomical structures make-up and seal anatomic compartments in the abdomen providing a natural barrier to the spread of an inflammatory, neoplastic or hemorrhagic process. However, they also bridge and interconnect the same anatomic compartments, providing important natural pathways for spread of a neoplastic process once the regional nodes of an organ afflicted by a malignancy are involved. The role of CT for the detection of this spread is well established. Lymph node enlargement at specific anatomic locations, as well as the sequence of their involvement facilitates the diagnosis of lymphatic spread of disease. This is particularly evident in cases of nodal dissemination of common abdominal malignancies. Learning Objectives: 1. To comprehend the complex anatomy of the lymphatic drainage of the abdomen. 2. To understand the pathophysiology of metastases using the lymphatic route. One of the index cases was admitted to our institution and initial measures implemented then were adequate in preventing any transmission. However, a month later, a patient with an atypical presentation of SARS triggered an outbreak of the disease in our institution. Three of our staff from the Department of Diagnostic Radiology were infected. In addition, two hospital staff, three outpatients and a patient's relative visiting the department were also afflicted. Within a matter of days, the practice of radiology within the hospital changed significantly. The immediate measures implemented in response to the acute outbreak, lessons learnt and the long term changes that are planned within the department to combat infectious diseases will be discussed. The reaction of radiology staff to this new and deadly threat and how we came to terms with our fears to battle against this disease will also be recounted. The emergence of SARS is a timely wake up call for all radiology departments to review their infection control practices. Learning Objectives: 1. To discuss the acute measures implemented in a radiology department during an acute SARS outbreak. 2. To relate the impact of SARS on the staff of a radiology department. 3. To discuss the long term changes that radiology departments should consider to combat infectious diseases.",

It is obvious from this definition that a training programme is intimately associated with the identity of a medical speciality. In its infancy, every new speciality has to go through a period of separation from a parent speciality; e.g. neurology from internal medicine and radiology from surgery. The reason for any separation is the expressed need for extensive special training also in related subjects outside the speciality. Full training in the parent speciality may encroach upon resources available for special training. The possibility of training fully in the parent speciality and still having time to do extra training within the limited area of interest, constitutes a true sub-speciality. Problems arise when so much extra training is required that it becomes ridiculous to ask for full training in the parent speciality as a base. This balance is the reason why sub-speciality training is an issue. Using neuroradiology as an example, the difficult training issues between neuroradiology, radiology and neurosciences are illustrated. Recent advances in brain imaging, particularly the brain in function, highlights the shortcoming in today's training of neuroradiologists. Optimal training of academic neuroradiologists, is vital for the future of neuroradiology and all of neuroscience. Their training must be more broadly based within neuroscience than is possible in the present system. It is also vital to attract neurologists, neurosurgeons and neurophysiologists to practice in academic departments of neuroradiology. Learning Objectives:",

            "text": "European diploma and self assessment I.W. McCall; Oswestry/UK Educationalists differ regarding the value of examinations despite being used in all developed countries. Some European countries have national radiological examinations, others local and some none, while the timing and standard of examinations also varies. In radiology, testing knowledge, whilst important, is of limited value and it is essential to also evaluate competence. It is argued that radiology trainees are mature with much previous examination experience and that competence should be judged by continuous peer appraisal. However varying standards may result, while not inspiring confidence of other centres and National regulatory bodies. Thus, a European trainee self-assessment programme is suggested to (1) support harmonisation of training (2) enable trainees to test their competence and knowledge, (3) simplify radiologists' movement within Europe (4) raise standards of care. It must test the individual's ability to manage cases and reach sensible diagnoses. It must use a uniform language, be computer and preferably internet based and inexpensive. Knowledge is tested by multiple choice format, the questions being sought widely and agreed by a small panel of examiners. Competence would be evaluated using short and more complex cases via an interactive computer program whereby the trainee reviews the initial examination, describes the findings, produces a differential diagnosis, indicates further investigations, reviews them and produces a final diagnosis. Problems include computer program development and pump-priming resources. Initially trainees will not pass or fail but as a European diploma, strict quality controls, an appeal mechanism and a legal framework will all be required. CT angiography has been established as a standard technique for minimally invasive imaging of the aorta and pulmonary arteries since the mid 1990s. Imaging of other vascular territories with single slice CTA is possible but technically challenging. The advent of multislice scanning has made CTA much easier for almost any vascular territory and has substantially increased scan coverage as well as spatial resolution. Spatial resolution is now good enough to see very small vessels like the central bronchial arteries or the arteries of the hand. This course will discuss the technical challenges of multislice CTA, including the choice of scanning parameters and the concepts behind contrast administration. Postprocessing techniques will be reviewed, with a special focus on simple techniques that allow for quick and problem-oriented solutions for image display and evaluation. CTA can be used for stroke imaging, pulmonary embolism, a vast variety of aortic diseases, renal artery stenosis and mesenteric artery abnormalities. The latter can be examined as part of a standard arterial phase scan of the abdomen. Portal phase images allow for evaluation of portal hypertension, vascular occlusion or tumor involvement. Newer developments include CTA of the peripheral arteries of the lower and upper extremities as well as full body CTA. Compared to MRA, CTA has regained lost territory with the introduction of multislice scanning, but CTA should be used with care in young individuals and patients with impaired renal function. Percutaneous nephrostomy (PCN) is a simple interventional procedure when it is performed on a dilated collecting system to relief a chronic hydronephrosis. When the collecting system is not dilated, failure may occur if the interventional radiologist is not aware of some technical points which will be shown and which permit to achieve a PCN in virtually 100% of cases on a non dilated collecting system. In patients with complex pelvicalcyeal stones, including staghorn calculi, stones within a diverticulum, access to the collecting system is governed by a series of technical rules which will be exposed to show how to render stone-free a patient harboring the most complex renal calculi. Percutaneous stone extraction of the upper third of the ureter is also governed, in difficult cases, by technical endourological recipes which will be explained to show how to clear the ureter of stones embedded within the ureteral mucosa. Concerning ureteral stenting, most of the problems encountered are due to tight stenoses which may seem to be impassable, owing to a total ureteral obstruction. In these cases, performing an ureteroneocystostomy or using the rendez-vous technique, with a combined antegrade and retrograde approach, permits passage in 100% of cases of these totally obstructed ureters. Technical aspects of this technique will be shown. The rendezvous technique can also very succefully be used to stent ureters in case of ureteral fistula into the retroperitoneum. Other endoureteral manipulations will be shown such as ureteral embolisation in case of intractable vesico-vaginal fistulae secondary to pelvic malignancies in female patients. ",

What are the most difficult lesions to treat in the liver? What are expected results with treating primary tumors of the liver vs. metastasis disease? How difficult is follow-up?

Can you treat a metastasis? These points will be emphasized and summarized in the lecture. Acute abdominal pain is the most common condition necessitating surgical admission to a pediatric hospital. The vast majority of cases are due to either appendicitis or acute non-specific abdominal pain. However, there are many other conditions presenting with acute abdominal pain in childhood which can mimic appendicitis. Some of these conditions are rarely encountered in adult practice. Plain abdominal radiographs are still obtained initially on many children presenting with abdominal pain. In the absence of associated symptoms such as vomiting, however, ultrasonography is more likely to elucidate the underlying cause of pain than plain film radiography. While computed tomography is being used extensively in investigating adults with abdominal pain, its widespread use in children is to be avoided in the interest of radiation protection. Learning Objectives: 1. To review the various radiological investigations which are performed on children with abdominal pain, and to become familiar with the relative advantages and disadvantages of each one in the paediatric setting. 2. To review the concept of recurrent abdominal pain in childhood, including its clinical management. 3. To review the causes of acute abdominal pain in children, and to learn which of the imaging investigations is most appropriate to each condition. 4.

It is usually seen in infants older than five years, but can occur at any age. Atypical clinical findings are seen in about 30% to 50% of children, especially in the younger ones, and often lead to a delayed diagnosis. Preoperative clinical assessment alone has yielded an accuracy ranging between 70% and 90%, but is associated with a normal appendectomy rate of about 13% to 25%. Pre-operative imaging using the graded compression ultrasound technique (US) and/or different helical computed tomography (CT) techniques has been able to reduce this rate to 3% to 7% without an increase in perforation rate. An extensive review of the literature revealed several papers examining the accuracy of different imaging modalities and strategies of acute appendicitis in children. The reported sensitivity of US varied between 87% and 95%, vs. 95% to 97% for helical CT, while the specificity ranged between 85% and 98% for US and 94% and 97% for helical CT. Only one truly randomised study was found, showing that compared to US alone, a combination of US and helical CT increased the sensitivity from 86% to 99%, while the specificity decreased from 95% to 89%.

Primary imaging modality of choice is ultrasound scanning, which enables the diagnosis or exclusion of an intussusception at a sensitivity of 98-100%, specificity of 88% and a negative predictive value of 100%. In emergency cases, additional plain films are necessary to detect potential intestinal perforation, to identify intestinal obstruction or other diseases mimicking the clinical presentation. Once the diagnosis of an intussusception is established, non surgical reduction (NSR) will be used. A surgical approach is chosen in patients with signs of perforation, shock or peritonitis. Depending on the choice of imaging technique, different contrast media are used for NSR. Barium suspension or air with fluoroscopic guidance, or saline only or mixed with water soluble contrast under sonographic guidance has to be used. Regardless of the used contrast medium, NSR is an effective technique, being successfully in more than 90%. The role of imaging is early diagnosis, evaluation of extent of infection with special regard to potential neural compromise, differential diagnosis, guidence of diagnostic biopsy, planning of eventual operative procedures and assessment of therapeutic response. Imaging modalities include skeletal scintigraphy, radiography, computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). In practice usually a combination of a sensitive and a specific method is utilised. The only imaging modality which combines high sensitivity with satisfactory specificity is MRI. This is the reason that MRI has become the first imaging modality in clinically suspect spinal infection. MRI is the method of choice for demonstration of direct extension of infection, especially of secondary epidural abscess or phlegmon and consecutive neural compression. Using MRI monitoring of therapeutical efficiency is possible. ",

There is considerably greater radiosensitivity of the organs and bone marrow in children, because of rapidly dividing cells. Any radiation dose, small or large, is expected to produce a response and a cumulative effect. Therefore, every effort should be made in the radiation protection area to keep the dose as low as reasonably achievable, trying to retrieve the best possible information when performing indicated, justified diagnostic tests. Minimizing radiation doses should be a concept applied in a chain of actions, starting from the choice of equipment of the radiology department. Pediatric-oriented protocols, especially with regard to CT, regular quality assurance tests and continuous training of staff involved are important parts of this chain. Radiation protection rules should be meticulously applied in neonates and children. Justification of requested examinations, vetting of referrals for complex examinations, standardization of techniques and procedures as well as optimization of protection measures are crucial components for ensuring minimization of radiation exposure when imaging children. Special considerations include shielding of gonads, thyroid and lens, appropriate collimation, PA projections in females and grid removal. In addition, short exposure times, immobilization or sedation, entertainment or distracting devices should be applied in order to eliminate patient motion. All departments can benefit from self-audits and re-evaluation of their procedures. Many women are exposed each year to diagnostic X-rays as part of their work. The International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP) has recommended that for occupational exposure of a pregnant worker, the protection provided for the conceptus should be similar to that provided for members of the public. This protection is achieved by the application of a limit of 2 mSv maximum abdominal surface dose during the declared pregnancy. This dose limit usually ensures that the dose to the conceptus will not exceed 1 mSv. Thus, dose limits for the unborn child are comparable with those for the general public. Once a pregnant worker declares her pregnancy, a program should be established to calculate and monitor conceptus dose and counsel the pregnant woman. First, the conceptus dose from X-ray examinations carried out prior to declaration should be determined. Then, maximum procedure-specific permissible monthly workloads for the pregnant worker should be derived. In some cases, change in working duties might be necessary. It is important that the pregnant worker receives radiation safety counselling and understands the risk to the conceptus from X-ray radiation received as a result of her occupational exposure. Learning Objectives: 1. To learn dose limits, regulations and recommendations concerning occupational exposure of pregnant women employed in diagnostic radiology. 2. To provide a methodology for establishing a program to calculate and monitor conceptus radiation dose as a result of the occupational exposure of the pregnant worker. 3.

The typical indications are benign and malignant focal diseases of these organs, but also acute and chronic inflammatory and infectious diseases. This includes the primary diagnosis, the staging and follow-up in malignant diseases, the assessment of the extent and complications in inflammation, and in trauma. In terms of widespread availability, \"intimacy with the technique\" and cost-effectiveness, CT is the working-horse for abdominal imaging while MRI is still considered mainly as problem solver in ambiguous cases in spite of its accepted superiority in tissue characterization. Knowledge of the anatomical entities and the various pathological changes of the organs and structures of the abdomen is mandatory to read CT and MRI studies accurately with an improved diagnostic benefit. CT and MRI will provide sufficient diagnostic information only if performed adequately customized to the clinical problem and in a technically optimized and correct way. Therefore, one must be aware of the technical potentials and limitations of CT and MRI technique and also of how to adjust this technique to the specific clinical needs. The following issues of impingement syndrome of the shoulder are addressed: stage I to III, osseous and soft tissue causes (e.g. thickened low lying coracoacromial ligament), traumatic \"activation\" of pain in otherwise silent impingement, chronic and acute tear in impingement, soft tissue calcifications, tendinous retraction and fatty atrophy of the supraspinatus muscle, differential diagnosis.

Bone-related factors include glenoid dysplasia, fractures of the glenoid rim and Hill-Sachs lesions. Labral lesions and abnormalities of the articular cartilage contribute to instability. The joint capsule and the glenohumeral ligaments are relevant stabilizers, with the inferior glenohumeral ligament being the most important structure. The rotator cuff and the biceps tendon are additional stabilizers. They press the humeral head into the glenoid cavity and directly guide the humeral head. Standard radiographs may sufficiently demonstrate relavant bone abnormalities. For subtle bone lesions CT or CT arthrography are required. For demonstration of joint capsule, labrum and glenohumeral ligaments, CT arthrography and MR arthrography are both adequate. When additional soft tissue factors, such as rotator cuff lesions, are of interest, MR arthrography is probably superior to CT arthrography. Standard MR imaging may be employed in the presence of joint effusion but may not be as consistent in the diagnosis of instability-related morphological changes as MR arthrography or CT arthrography. Ultrasonography is useful for the demonstration of rotator cuff lesions but has otherwise limited capabilities in the assessment of instability. Learning Objectives:",

At the same time the diagnostic techniques, in particular the arthro-MRI, have been refined. However, the arthro-MRI represents the shoulder in its static form and, therefore, the surgeon must interpret the images and compare them to the clinical and arthroscopic results in order to obtain a complete diagnostic picture.

Indications: Percutaneous nephrostomy is a predominantly therapeutic procedure to relieve obstruction of the upper urinary tract. However it also provides access for further interventional procedures i.e. percutaneous stone extraction, antegrade placement of stents and dilatation of ureteric strictures. Radiological anatomy of the ureter is demonstrated using a combination of multidetector CT techniques facilitating 3D reconstruction and retrograde ureteropyelography. Understanding the anatomy of the ureter is fundamental to an effective interventional uroradiology practice. Ureter pathologies reviewed include malignant obstruction, iatrogenic injury, uretero-ileal stenosis, benign strictures and stone disease. Essential equipment needed to deal with possible complications will be discussed. Techniques reviewed include the optimum approach, stent placement, flexible ureteroscopy and biopsy and stricture dilatation. Double-pigtail stent placement is an established technique for treatment of malignant and benign ureteric strictures and ureteric fistulae. The retrograde approach is often the first choice approach to the ureter and may be achieved using a flexible cystoscope with digital C-arm fluoroscopy or fluoroscopy alone. Complications are few and procedures may be performed on an outpatient basis under sedoanalgesia.",

High technical success rates (> 96%) are reported in patients with malignant ureteric obstruction. Developments in imaging equipment, catheters, guidewires, stents and delivery systems have contributed to improved technical success rates. Regular stent replacement helps minimize complications relating to stent encrustation, occlusion and fracture. A stent registry or database is needed for accurate stent tracking to allow timely recall. For stent or foreign body removal both cystoscopic and fluoroscopy-guided methods are required. Thermoexpandable nickel-titanium alloy stents have theoretical advantages over double-pigtail models by allowing maintenance of ureteric peristalsis but they are prone to migration. The first part of this talk will be dedicated to basic and application-oriented questions of the technology and physics of cardiac CT imaging. A review of current CT technology will be given which is a prerequisite for high-quality phase-selective cardiac CT imaging which involves subsecond scanning with multi-row detector technology and dedicated reconstruction algorithms. An assessment of patient dose issues and hints to possibilities for dose reduction will also be given. The second part is dedicated to quality assurance (QA).

Non-invasive evaluation of the coronary plaque burden may add to cardiovascular risk prediction. The most direct non-invasive measure of coronary atherosclerosis to date is the assessment of coronary calcification. This strategy is based on the close histopathological correlation between coronary calcium deposits and the total amount of coronary atherosclerosis. The development of electronbeam tomography has enabled accurate detection and quantification of coronary calcium, while also newest generation mechanical CT scanners have this ability. A number of studies has shown that increasing amounts of coronary calcium are associated with an increased risk of coronary heart disease. Relative risks for coronary events in asymptomatic subjects ranged from 2.3 to 22.2, depending on the population and the categorization of calcium scores. There is some evidence that calcium scoring can also have prognostic value in symptomatic subjects. Assessment of coronary calcification provides a non-invasive method to identify asymptomatic people at high risk of coronary events. The independent and additional prognostic value of calcium scoring in combination with risk factor assessment is under investigation. Learning Objectives: 1. To comprehend the magnitude of the current cardiovascular disease problem, and the strengths and shortcomings of the current cardiovascular risk assessment. The predictive value of 16-MDCT angiography to detect patients with no, single, or multivessel disease is 100%, 75%, and 74%, respectively. Overall predictive value is 78%. Development of postprocessing techniques will enable the automated anatomic selection of the coronaries out of a 3D data set, while further hardware developments are focussing on non-invasive 4D coronary imaging. Early comparative results between 16-MDCT and CAG show that 16-MDCT displays significantly more soft plaque coronary vessel wall abnormalities together with the visualization of coronary calcification. In MR imaging a complete new approach is developed with the use of contrast agents such as gadofluorine to directly enhance and image atherosclerotic plaques which enables improved soft plaque detection of even non stenotic lesions.",

Preparation of the bowel: Small bowel and colon cleansing is essential before any intestinal examination. Administration of the endoluminal contrast medium: The trans-gastric catheter is mandatory to obtain adequate bowel distension. Nasal insertion of the catherter is much better tolerated than oral introduction. Infusion of the intraluminal c.m.: The endoluminal c.m. is infused at a constant 60-100 cc/min rate. The quantity to distend the small intestine properly is 1700-2300 cc (Rollandi 1995 , 1996 , 1999 , Schober 1996 . Endoluminal contrast medium: We prefer a \"negative\" contrast medium. CT Technique: The drug-induced hypotonicity reduces intestinal peristalsis and loop segmentation. One of the easiest false positives is to mistake peristaltic segmentation with an organic stenosis. The i.v. c.m. is injected after a portal phase delay. The volume must be acquired with 7 mm slice thickness, a pitch of 2, and at 3 mm reconstruction. Reduction in thickness or pitch improves the images quality. The new multislice detector bars allow better performances in terms of global scan time and scan thickness. Post-processing: The images from a volumetric scan allow high-quality multi-planar reconstructions. Dosimetry: Accurate measurements demonstrate that a greater part of the X-ray dose is due to fluoroscopy during catheter positioning. This dose is variable, depending on the operator but is similar in all techniques that are enteroclysisbased. The dose due to image acquisition is greater in conventional examinations than CT; fluoroscopy is present only in the acquisition phase of a conventional study. Firstly, the lack of radiation exposure is a fundamental point in favor of MRI, especially for studying young patients if one considers that CD lasts for the whole of a patient's life, and for therapy follow-up, since this examination can be repeated in short intervals of time. Secondly, the multiplanarity of MRI is similarly important, with the coronal plane crucial in the evaluation of the small and large bowel. Recent studies have confirmed the value of MRI not only in detecting the typical cross-sectional findings of CD (concentric bowel wall thickening, wall enhancement, creeping fat, etc.) but also in localizing the lesions in the small and large bowel, in assessing disease extent and in detecting intestinal and extraintestinal complications (abscesses, fistulas, phlegmons, urinary or hepato-biliary complications). Finally, the high intrinsic contrast and the possibility to evaluate wall inflammation with different MR parameters have allowed the assessment of CD activity and the differentiation of fibro-stenosing from inflammatory lesions. Therefore, MRI may have a predictive value on the effects of conventional or new biological drugs. For all these reasons MRI is destined to play a significant role in the management and therapeutic planning of CD patients. ",

We have proceeded from a diagnostic speciality and have included intervention, therapeutics and follow-up. With molecular imaging we now image the basic mechanisms of disease. Radiologists can, together with biologists, image activities of the interior of a cell, the cell surface and the outside of cells. The potential in the post-genomic area is immense and imaging of the genome and the proteomics (the signal substances in the body) will lead to individualized diagnostic therapy. This will lead to better diagnosis and more exact biopsy interventions and therapy. It is therefore important for radiologists to understand some of the chemistry and physics of these developments. Already today, radiologists can perform molecular imaging with all modalities. CT (iodinated nanoparticles) and ultrasound (acoustic nanoparticles) can be used. The two most used modalities, however, are PET and MRI. The success of molecular imaging is heavily dependent on signal/noise ratio and resolution. Today, PET has a high signal to noise ratio and can detect molecules at a molar concentration of 10 -11 , but has a poor resolution. MRI has a high resolution, but can only detect a molecular concentration of 10 -3 mols. Now a new possibility with 13 C MRI imaging exists to detect much lower molar concentrations and still keep the high resolution.

We need a standard MRI instrument that can listen to the radio frequency of 13 C. The 13 C \"radio station\" has a frequency of \u00bc of that of the proton station. How do I get the substance to inject? The 13 C enriched substance can be stored like other pharmaceutical substances in a \"ready to use kit\". Before use, the substance must be put into a \"polarizer\" placed close to the magnet. Push a button and you will get \"the ready to use\" injection syringe. Imaging must take place within the first few minutes after injection. 13 C-imaging has the advantage of using endogenous substances for imaging. This opens a door to untraditional medical diagnosis. 13 C-imaging offers the possibility of imaging the pathway of such molecules after injection into the body. MRI has until now not been sensitive enough to generate relevant information about events at molecular levels. \"Hyperpolarization techniques\" can increase the MRI signal more than 10 000 times, making it realistic to image the position of the molecules.

Bifone; Verona/IT Magnetic resonance imaging with optically polarized 3 He and 129 Xe is a promising, novel tool for the investigation of lung structure and function. Hyperpolarization of other low-sensitivity nuclei would dramatically extend the range of applications of MRI and MRS in medicine and biology. Among the NMR-sensitive nuclei, 13 C is probably the one with the best potential. Due to its ubiquitous presence in biological and organic molecules, and its rich NMR spectrum, 13 C is the nucleus of choice for many in vitro NMR studies. However, its low isotopic abundance and low gyromagnetic ratio make it challenging to detect 13 C NMR signals in living organisms, and to image 13 C distribution with MRI. Optical methods used for 3 He and 129 Xe cannot be extended easily to 13 C-containing molecules, and a number of other routes have been explored. The principles and the relative merits of the various hyperpolarization methods are presented. The 13 C spin-lattice relaxation time (T 1 ) is a critical parameter for in vivo studies. The spin-lattice relaxation time must be long enough to enable hyperpolarization methods to be applied and MR experiments to be performed before the enhanced polarization relaxes back to its equilibrium value. Thus, the 13 C relaxation times determine the time-scale of the physiological process accessible to hyperpolarized 13 C MRI. The implications for clinical and pre-clinical studies are discussed.

From feeding arteries, blood and plasma perfuse through the capillary bed, a complicated 3-dimensional network of intercommunicating paths. Capillary diameters are comparable to the size of red blood cells, the flow is slow and \"plug\"like and the blood/tissue volume ratio is typically < 5%. The challenging task of perfusion assessment can be undertaken using MRI as well as with techniques using ionizing radiation (SPECT, PET, CT). In MRI, one commonly employs dynamic T2* monitoring of an exogenous tracer (a Gadolinium chelate), in combination with tracer-kinetic models. This technique (dynamic susceptibility-contrast MRI, DSC-MRI) gives information about blood flow, blood volume and mean transit time (MTT). Absolute quantification is, however, complicated by sensitivity to vascular structure and difficulties to accurately register the arterial input function (AIF). By use of a tracer acting as a direct signal source several of these problems can be avoided, and dynamic studies of the 13 C-passage through the capillary system (in combination with a modified bolus-tracking theory) gives possibilities for quantification of blood flow, blood volume and MTT. Furthermore, new methods where the hyperpolarized signal is repeatedly destroyed using RF pulses open possibilities to assess the blood flow by measuring only the amount of tracer that arrives at the tissue during a short time interval. This eliminates problems associated with deconvolution and AIF delay and dispersion. In this lecture, the promising aspects of hyperpolarized 13 C as a new perfusion tracer will be discussed. In case of disk pathology, recent papers demonstrated spontaneous anatomical involution ranging from 40% (after 6 months) to 70% (after 1 year). After 6 months, regression is registered in 100% of free fragments and migrated disks, in 85% of T2W hyperintense extrusions, in 68% of extrusions in general and in 51% of clinically acute herniations. Moreover, dynamic studies by MR and CT have been also suggested, with the aim of reproducing pathophysiological conditions. Interventional radiology also offers several possibilities of therapeutic approach, with success percentage ranging from 65 to 75%. Minimally invasive procedures such as CT or fluoroscopy-guided radiofrequency diskoplasty, O 2 -O 3 or corticosteroid intradiskal and periganglionic injection will be specially discussed. Differential diagnosis with other forms of back pain is also mandatory in order to discriminate further forms susceptible to interventional therapy, like facet syndromes treatable by peri-facet steroid injection, synovial cysts by evacuation and steroid injection and sacro-ileitis by intra-articular steroid injection. Interventional approach has also been successfully and widely proposed in case of osteoporotic (or tumoral) vertebral fractures and 70,000 vertebroplasty per year are estimated in USA. The success rate is reported as 85-100% of cases (complications in 3-6%). All the above underlines the changing class of radiologists, switched from the single diagnostic role to the complete clinical one by adding the therapeutic management of several spinal pathologic conditions.

Major indications are: acute variceal bleeding not controlled with endoscopy, recurrent bleeding refractory to treatment, refractory ascites and hepatic hydrothorax and Budd-Chiari syndrome. Major contraindications are right sided cardiac failure, tumours or cysts within the tract, chronic encephalopathy and poor liver function (Child-Pugh score > 12). TIPS efficacy in controlling acute bleeding is higher than 90% with a rebleeding rate at one month of 15%. TIPS is more effective than endoscopy as prophylaxis for variceal rebleeding, however, survival rates do not differ among both treatment modalities and the rate of encephalopathy is higher with TIPS. Refractory ascites can be solved in 6 months in 50 -90% of the patients. The major disadvantage of TIPS is the need for follow-up by means of portography and/or ultrasound studies in order to check its patency therefore avoiding the risk of a rebleed.

It was also the main reason for relatively poor cost-effectiveness of TIPS when compared with endoscopic or surgical treatment of symptomatic portal hypertension. The exact pathophysiological mechanism of the bile duct injuries and bile influence on intraluminal thrombus formation and TIPS stenosis development is not known. In vitro studies revealed that bile itself paradoxically inhibits smooth muscle cells activity, and is perhaps more important for excessive thrombus formation. Bile in higher concentrations may inhibit endothelialization process of the shunt lumen. It is obvious from the current literature that ePTFE stentgrafts significantly improve the acute and long-term primary and secondary patency of TIPS. The endoprostheses have to be placed from the portal vein to the ostium of the hepatic vein to prevent not only acute shunt thrombosis and the parenchymal tract stenosis but also outflow tract stenosis. The additional cost associated with stentgraft implantation in TIPS is likely to be balanced by the reduced need for subsequent interventions and long-term surveillance. Learning Objectives:",

Although chest radiography remains important in the evaluation of pediatric lung disease, high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) is being increasingly used to investigate a variety of disorders such as large and small airways disease and diffuse interstitial lung disease. HRCT of the chest is a technique capable of imaging the lung with excellent spatial resolution and with a precise anatomic detail and is both more sensitive in detecting abnormalities and more accurate for differentiating between different causes than the chest radiograph. In children, experience with HRCT is limited. As HRCT provides more information, with comparable radiation exposure, it could be an alternative for routine use, especially in chronic pediatric lung disorders. All these reasons explain the increasing use of this technique in investigating and evaluating many pediatric lung disorders. Advances in CT technology allow images of sufficient diagnostic quality to be obtained in children during gentle and quiet respiration. In most cases these can be performed without sedation. Careful planning of the CT examination and the use of a proper technique is extremely important in obtaining diagnostic exams with very little radiation to the patient.",

To learn the main clinical indications for HRCT in children. A-222 C. HRCT in interstitial lung diseases C. Owens; London/UK Diffuse interstitial lung disease (DILD) represents a heterogenous group of disorders characterised by restrictive lung function and impaired gas exchange. In childhood, these diseases occur on a background of developing lungs and an immature evolving immune system, so clinical presentation and disease progression is modified by comparison to adult equivalents. Hence, DILD often differs in presentation, clinical features and progress compared with adult interstitial lung disease and therefore it is not scientific to extrapolate known patterns of disease from adults to children. Once the diagnosis is suspected, the radiologist's task is to confirm the presence and severity of interstitial lung disease and to uncover predisposing factors identifying the dominant pathology. It may sometimes be possible to make a definitive diagnosis without biopsy, but the majority of patients require histopathological correlation using open lung biopsy, video assisted thoracoscopic, (VATS) or high resolution computed tomography (HRCT) guided lung biopsy. In general, classification of DILD in childhood, includes disorders of known aetiology (aspiration pneumonitis, chronic infection, chronic hypersensivity pneumonitis, lipid storage diseases), unknown primary pulmonary disorders with lung involvement or systemic disorders with pulmonary involvement, and finally those diseases unique to childhood. Learning Objectives: 1. To define the anatomy of the pulmonary interstitium. In an adult, the combination of fever, flank pain, frequency and dysuria is typical of acute bacterial pyelonephritis. This can be confirmed by bacturia, pyuria and the presence of leukocytosis within the blood. Patients with uncomplicated pyelonephritis who respond to treatment do not necessarily require radiological evaluation. In general imaging should be reserved to those patients in whom conventional treatment has failed or those who have recurrent or unusually severe symptoms. Occasionally patients may be referred for imaging at an early stage if the symptomatology or urinalysis is uncertain or if other diseases such as ureteric colic or renal infarction are suspected. In addition, in certain patients such as those with conditions that predispose to infection like diabetes mellitus or immunocompromised states, early imaging may be beneficial. Early imaging is also required if there is a clinical possibility of pyonephrosis which would require urgent drainage. In the paediatric population, imaging is important in the detection of structural abnormalities that predispose to infection/reinfection which may ultimately be amenable to surgical correction. This review will concentrate on the imaging of UTI in the adult population as the remit of paediatric imaging in urinary tract infection is outside the scope of this article. Learning Objectives: 1. To review the indications for imaging of patients with urinary tract infection. 2. To descibe the imaging findings of the various subtypes of urinary tract infection. 3.

Early diagnosis of pelvic infection leads to early and successful treatment with minimal, if any, complications. Imaging provides a significant assistance to the management of pelvic infection and appropriate selection and use of different imaging modalities and techniques is essential to the diagnostic management of pelvic infection. The purpose of this presentation is to discuss the approach as well as the use of different imaging modalities such as US, MRI, CT and hysterosalpingography in the management of pelvic infection. This presentation will give an overview of the key topics in PET methodology (tracer kinetics, acquisition parameters, image reconstruction and data analysis), and the physical and mathematical principles upon which they are based. Key determinants of the performance of a PET tomograph are the detector material and geometry. Currently, commercial scanners use four scintillator materials (NaI, BGO, LSO, GSO) and the relative merits of these materials will be compared to the latest detector materials, such as lanthanum halide. The geometry of the detector array is inherently linked to the detector material, with good timing and energy resolution being favourable for a large solid angle system. Such a system offers the possibility of fast whole body imaging and/or sensitive brain imaging for low uptake tracers. The various geometries will be compared, including the latest large area panel detector design. Small animal PET imaging in preclinical research is a rapidly expanding market and an increasing number of commercial vendors are producing these systems. Developments that are already being incorporated into these systems, such as avalanche photo-diode readout to improve resolution, may well be incorporated into clinical machines in the future, particularly those for high-resolution applications. New fast scintillators, such as lanthanum halide, may mean that time-of-flight PET is revisited to further improve the signal-to-noise ratio in the images. Although PET-CT scanners are already commercially available, there has been limited progress on the development of combined PET-MR systems. The problems and benefits of PET-MR systems will be discussed. Since then about 200 combined systems have been installed worldwide. Current commercially available PET/CT tomographs employ state-of-the art PET and multi-row CT technology, and buyers may choose from a range of mid-to high-tier combinations. An increasing number of publications demonstrate the benefits of PET/CT imaging and substantiate the hypothesis of its improved diagnostic accuracy and clinical value. By using multi-row CT complex CT contrast protocols can be followed in high-resolution mode as part of the combined PET/CT exam, thus rendering these exams \"clinical\" to the radiologists. CT information is also used for routine attenuation correction of the complementary emission data and standard PET transmission data are essentially no longer needed in the context of PET/CT. In addition, algorithms have been proposed to account for potential artifacts from CT contrast agents, truncated field-of-view, or artifacts from metal implants. A well-known challenge of combined PET/CT imaging is respiration-induced artifacts. These artifacts can, however, be limited considerably by careful patient preparation and the use of limited breath-hold techniques, and are further reduced by employing fast multi-row CT technology. Current hard-and software developments focus on increasing the throughput of PET/CT and offering alternative clinical acquisition protocols (e.g. emission only, low-dose CT in combination with PET for followup). Revised PET detector designs and a more integrated high-end combination of CT and PET technology may lead to a novel research tool for combined imaging of highly specific tracers. Positron emission tomography (PET) has gained a key role in oncologic imaging by providing accurate pretreatment staging, monitoring the response to therapy, and in the follow-up after treatment by precisely characterizing the function and metabolism of tumors, e.g. using the glucose analogue F-18-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-Dglucose (F-18-FDG).",

Increasingly, PET and CT or MRI scans are combined (anatometabolic image fusion), e.g., for molecular radiation treatment planning (MRTP) of radiotherapy. Integrated PET/CT may be able to pinpoint areas of subcentimeter disease before biopsy or excision is performed and soon might be routinely performed early in the diagnostic workup.

The choice of the correct bowel preparation will be discussed (PEG solution, phospho-soda or magnesium citrate and bisacodyl tablets) as well as methods to tag residual fluids, in order to improve polyp detection and to reduce the number of FP examinations. Initial results of fecal tagging, with complete avoidance of cathartic preparation, will be presented. Patient preparation prior to scanning consists of air insufflation, administration of an antiperistaltic drug, and i.v. injection of iodinated contrast medium, if required. Data acquisition protocols for CTC are in continuous evolution. The multiplicity of parameters of multidetector scanners allows different protocols to be optimized, ranging from high-resolution, to low-dose, to fast scanning techniques. Image analysis is performed on dedicated off-line workstations. Several studies have demonstrated the ability of CTC in the detection of colonic neoplastic lesions, not only large colonic carcinomas, but also polyps. If considering clinically significant polyps (> 10 mm), detection rate is rather high (> 90%). Today, the most widely accepted clinical indication for CTC study is incomplete or unsuccessful colonoscopy. The potential indication for the future is represented by colo-rectal cancer screening.

Multislice CT and MRI hold great promise to achieve the spatial and temporal resolution required to assess vessel lumen and wall. In the coronary arteries, detection of \"vulnerable plaques\" is critical. They have a thin fibrous cap and a large lipid core. Acute coronary syndromes frequently result from rupture of such vulnerable plaques. Due to remodelling of the vessel wall, the thickening of the vessel wall is not associated with major stenosis. Disruption of vulnerable plaques may result in thrombus formation and distal embolization, as the lipid core is highly thrombogenic.

Fern\u00e1ndez; Vigo Pontevedra/ES Atherosclerosis and its complications represent the major cause of morbility and mortality in industrialized countries. For the radiologist is not only important to diagnose the disease when an acute event occurs, but also to adequate imaging methods for early detection of subclinical atherosclerotic plaques. In atherogenesis, the plaque begins by eccentric thickening of the intima due to injury in the endothelium. This endothelial dysfunction is followed by lipid accumulation in the intima (LDL-cholesterol) because of an imbalance between the mechanism of lipid accumulation and removal. Monocytes circulating in the lumen are adhered to the wall through selective adhesion molecules and engulf the excess of LDL. Theses monocytes became macrophages, charged with cholesterol (foam cells). An excess of this cells produce macroscopical changes called fatty streaks that can be already seen in the young or children. When this cleaning system is overhelmed, the macrophages die (apoptosis) and magma of cholesterol esters is accumulated in the intima forming a lipid core surrounded by a fibrous capsule. This plaque is called a vulnerable plaque because when the fibrous capsule is ruptured, the lipid core content is emptied into the lumen producing thrombosis. The imaging methods can be used to characterize plaque composition and detect vulnerable plaques in asymptomatic patients. Thus, early detection and treatment must be the new strategies in high-risk patients. The radiologist should not only report the stenosis percentage of the plaque, but also the suspicion of existence of a lipid core plaque implying the diagnosis of a vulnerable plaque. Learning Objectives: 1. To explain the pathophysiology of atherosclerotic plaque with radiological correlation. 2. To know the importance to detect vulnerable plaques in asymptomatic patients to permit optimal treatment and allow monitoring of the vascular response.",

Becker; Munich/DE In asymptomatic patients with an intermediate risk for future cardiac events, nonenhanced low dose EBCT scans may be performed to detect coronary calcium as a surrogate marker of coronary atherosclerosis. Depending on the result, more or less invasive strategies for risk factor modification may be initiated and repeated scanning may control the efficacy of the therapy. However, the predictive value of coronary calcium for future cardiac events has not yet been determined in a large prospective cohort study. With contrast enhanced coronary MDCT, a more dedicated assessment of coronary atherosclerosis becomes possible. In patients with an acute coronary syndrome, MDCT may be able to demonstrate the location and extent of a coronary thrombus and may then be used to guide coronary interventions. In asymptomatic patients, coronary atheromas with a lipid core and fibrous cap may be detected, raising the suspicion of a vulnerable lesion that may rupture and may cause an acute coronary syndrome. In a comparative study such non-calcified lesions were detected significantly more often in patients suffering from an acute myocardial infarction than in patients with chronic stable angina. On the other side, calcified lesions were more often found in patients with stable than in unstable coronary artery disease. Furthermore, in heart specimen studies and in comparison with intra-vascular ultrasound the HU density in MDCT was significantly different in lipoid, fibrous and calcified lesions. However, the predictive value of the assessment of atherosclerotic lesions by MDCT angiography is currently unknown and requires further prospective cohort studies. Learning Objectives: 1.

In addition to the raw data on axial plane, longitudinal and three-dimensional reconstructions are available. Normal arterial wall of elastic type arteries (e.g. common carotid and common iliac arteries) is homogeneous, while the muscular type arteries (e.g. internal carotid, coronary, and femoral arteries) exhibit a three-layered structure. The three basic types of lesions distinguished in IVUS are 1. loose, lipid rich plaques appearing with low echogenicity. 2. dense fibrous lesions with bright echo reflections, and 3. calcified lesions producing intensively bright reflections with acoustic shadowing. It is possible to discern a vulnerable plaque prone to rupture, responsible for acute coronary syndrome (a lipid laden plaque with a thin fibrous cap) by IVUS. IVUS facilitates definition of a possibly clinically important phenomenon -arterial remodelling, which can be either 1. positive, i.e. compensatory expansion of the arterial wall during the development of an atherosclerotic plaque, or 2. negative, i.e. arterial shrinkage.

Several imaging techniques are available to assess atherosclerotic vessels. However, conventional luminographic techniques are ineffective in characterizing atherosclerotic plaque. Recognizing the need to shift emphasis from the vascular lumen to the arterial wall, high-resolution MRI has been increasingly considered for assessing the vascular system. High resolution MRI holds promise of non-invasively imaging vulnerable plaque and determining the different plaque components such as lipid core, fibrosis, calcification and thrombus. The assessment of plaque composition is regarded particularly important in determining the contributing factors related to plaque rupture. MR-based visualization of the vascular wall does, however, require high spatial resolution. Therefore, both external and intravascular surface coils have been used. Limited signal and depth penetration allows vessel wall imaging with external coils mainly for peripheral vessels, such as the carotid, femoral or popliteal arteries. Although intravascular coils can overcome this limitation providing sufficient spatial resolution to permit characterization of different plaque components, they do mandate an invasive approach. Alternatively, a functional strategy can be pursued. Based on the assumption that regions of active plaque formation harbor phagocytic cells, ultrasmall particles of iron oxides with a long intravascular half-life can be administered intravenously. Due to susceptibility effects associated with the accumulation of the iron particles in active plaque, rather small amounts of iron are sufficient to induce effects detectable by susceptibility-sensitive gradient echo MR images.

Direct visualization of normal and pathological cerebral structures has been enabled. Clinical implementation of H1 MRS offered yet another diagnostic tool for brain tumors characterization. H1 MRS is a method of spectral analysis of selected tissue metabolites, particularly suitable for brain examination. It is able to yield data on metabolic contents of the examined tissue specimen with employment of single voxel or multivoxel techniques. Standard spectral patterns for many brain tumors have been already established. However, relying only on H1 MRS pattern is not advisable.

During the last years, the number of patients diagnosed with ICA stenosis is growing mainly because of widely available duplex Doppler examinations. Endovascular carotid stenting (CAS) is now a fully accepted method of treatment as an alternative to vascular surgery. Its technical success rate reached almost 100%, when low-profile, especially dedicated endovascular equipment became available to perform these procedures. Introducing neuroprotection devices allowed to reduce embolic complications. Technical feasibility and overall low complication rates make CAS highly effective in ICA revascularization. Important issues remain qualification of patients for stenting considering the fact that not all ICA stenoses are to be treated. The main indication for CAS is hemodynamically significant ICA stenosis (> 70%) in patients presenting with neurological symptoms. Duplex Doppler examination is used to assess atherosclerotic plaque morphology and transcranial Doppler study can help in evaluation of circle of Willis hemodynamics. Brain perfusion techniques with multisliced CT brought new quality in assessing deficits in brain circulation caused by ICA stenosis. This method allows evaluation of cerebral blood flow (CBF), regional cerebral blood volume (CBV) and mean transit time (MTT). These parameters can be analyzed from the curve of inflow, peak and clearance phases of contrast enhancement. Comparison of the parameters obtained in both cerebral hemispheres gives good orientation on brain circulation deficit and enables treatment options to be decided. CT perfusion is very useful in monitoring the effects of endovascular revascularization when done before and after CAS.

            "text": "B. Sports-related degenerative disease of joints C. Masciocchi; L'Aquila/IT Sports activities either professional or not are growing in importance into our day-life. This means a corresponding higher frequency of sport-related injuries, leading to muscles, tendons, ligaments and bone pathological involvement. Usually in these conditions an early and correct diagnosis is required to avoid subsequent joint instability and/or functional impairment. Many of the diagnostic techniques now available play an important role in sports-related diseases; however to choose the right diagnostic protocol it is always necessary to know how traumatic forces acted. The most frequently involved joints are those provided by the largest range of motion: shoulder, knee and ankle. As this field of diseases comprehend either acute and chronic traumas we will consider only the degenerative conditions caused by long-lasting microtraumas and overloads which may lead to stress fractures, synovial hyperplastic reactions, chondral and subchondral suffering, tendon's degeneration, impingement syndromes and entrapment neuropathies (typically involved structures narrowed into bony or ligament channels). Plain film is usually the first examination to perform as it allows the best detection of bony alterations as consequence of altered loads, being able to clearly depict osteophytes, bone sclerosis and osteochondral fragments. However in many cases plain film may result completely negative as in stress fractures, impingement syndromes and ligament derangements. In these cases Ultrasound, Magnetic Resonance and Computed Tomography allow a complete evaluation of all the remaining soft joint components. The clinical role in using contrast agents in ultrasound (USCA) diagnosis is not yet demonstrated. Significant indications seem to be present in echocardiography and in liver evaluation. In particular USCA seem to be very useful in the characterization of focal lesions of the liver parenchyma. The introduction of second generation USCA together with specific software applied to ultrasound equipment open up a new approach in this study modality. Second generation USCA are characterised by the greater persistence due to the bubble shell and the bubble content using specific gas instead of air of the first USCA generation. In breast diagnosis the use of USCA is limited to few experiences but seems to be very interesting in particular in the characterization of the nodular ultrasound images. This leads to an increased possibility to differentiate malignant from benign lesions.",

            "text": "To evaluate the clinical indications of USCA in breast diagnosis at the European Institute of Oncology a specific trial was conducted. Fifty patients with different ultrasound images were evaluated with a second generation USCA (SonoVue\u00ae-BR1) and specific software (CnTI\u00ae). Fifteen patients had suspicious images, 15 probably benign images (fibroadenoma), 10 suspicious recurrence and 10 with a cluster of microcalcifications. Breast MRI was also performed in this third group of patient. All USCA studies were performed with three different dosages (2.4; 4.8 and 7.2 ml). All cases subsequently underwent Mammotome or surgical biopsy. Quantitative and qualitative analysis of the uptake and wash-out curves is currently in its evaluation phase. Contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance (MR) imaging is increasingly used as a complementary diagnostic modality in breast tumor imaging and seems to be the most important research area. Although the results of investigators to date have varied greatly, the sensitivity of breast gadopentetate dimeglumine-enhanced MR imaging for malignancy has consistently been reported to be excellent (88%-100%). The specificity of gadopentetate dimeglumine-enhanced MR imaging has been rather variable, ranging from 37% to 97%. Pre-clinical studies, however, demonstrate the advantages of macromolecular contrast media in the differentiation of breast tumors and in the monitoring of changes in tumor vessels after administration of angiogenesis inhibitors. Development of macromolecular contrast media has now advanced to the stage of clinical trials and the first contrast agents are approved. In addition to MR imaging of the breast contrast enhanced MR imaging of the axillary lymph nodes, the most common site of breast cancer spread, has emerged its clinical use. Gadolinium chelates and ultrasmall superparamagentic iron oxide (USPIO) particles are used to achieve this goal with promising results. Fluorochromes can be linked to specific ligands imparting probe selectivity for various targets of interest allowing e.g. the imaging of apoptosis or cancer related antigens (e.g. somatostatin receptor). Signal amplification by \"Fluorescence resonance energy transfer\"technology can be applied to synthesize \"smart\" probes, which allow for the detection of cancer related protease activity (e.g. cathepsin-B). Optical imaging marker genes such as green-or red fluorescent proteins can be exploited to monitor therapeutic gene transfer. Novel three-dimensional optical imaging technology will -in combination with the contrasting strategies mentioned above -have a significant impact on imaging breast cancer in the nearer future. Due to an inherently lower sensitivity of MRI to depict small (molecular) structures efficient signal amplification strategies are essential for molecular MR contrast agents. Various enzyme systems (e.g. Tyrosinase, \u00df-galactosidase, peroxidase) or internalizing cell receptors have been exploited for the detection gene expression by MRI. Strategies to reveal specific cell surface proteins by MRI include the application of targeted paramagnetic or superparamagnetic nanoparticles as well as \"smart\" probes, which alter their relaxation properties upon interaction with the molecluar target (f.i. \"magnetic relaxation switches\"). Moreover, approaches to imaging hyperpolarized 13 C or fluorine-labeled contrast agents have been pursued to improve SNR for molecular MRI. Pulmonary emphysema is a common, dangerous, and expensive disease. Because the definition of emphysema is based on pathological morphology, imaging techniques play a major role in the in-vivo assessment of pulmonary emphysema. Beyond a descriptive approach, these imaging techniques can be used to objectively quantify emphysema. This is at the base of the rational allocation of treatment, training or surgery. This presentation will detail the typical and atypical radiological presentations of emphysema. It will also emphasize the limitations of the subjective assessment of emphysema. To overcome these limitations, methods for the objective quantification of emphysema will be presented. Clinical and pre-clinical applications of objective quantification of emphysema will be presented. Finally, the potential impact of new technologies on the clinical work-up of pulmonary emphysema will be discussed. Response by the lung to inhaled cigarette smoke varies widely between individuals and can range from subclinical respiratory bronchiolitis through to end-stage Langerhans cell histiocytosis. The variety of interstitial lung diseases associated with cigarette smoking is wider than generally appreciated, and these often coexist. Although emphysema is a well understood consequence of cigarette smoking, its early pathogenesis and relationship to other smoking-induced infiltrative diseases is less clear-cut. An understanding of the pathologic basis of smokingrelated lung disease helps to explain the sometimes complex patterns encountered on high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT). The recent refinement of the classification of the idiopathic interstitial pneumonias and the longitudinal study of cigarette smokers with HRCT has furthered understanding of what can be regarded as an overlapping group of entities. The individual interstitial diseases ascribable to cigarette smoking, including respiratory bronchiolitis, desquamative interstitial pneumonia, Langerhans cell histiocytosis, and interstitial fibrosis are discussed in terms of their pathology and corresponding HRCT signs. Emphasis is placed on the frequent coexistence of various forms of smoking related interstitial lung disease. Learning Objectives: 1. To recognise the variety of interstial lung diseases that are encountered in cigarette smokers. 2. To understand the HRCT appearances of the \"pure\" smoking-related interstital lung diseases. 3. To appreciate the inter-relationship between the various smoking related lung pathologies, particularly the development of interstitial fibrosis.",

Chronic bronchitis is a clinical diagnosis and radiography has little to offer. Its principal role is to exclude other diseases that may mimic chronic bronchitis. Limited information is also available about HRCT in chronic bronchitis, perhaps reflecting the nebulous nature of this clinical entity; the most common findings being bronchial wall thickening, air-trapping and bronchiolectasis. HRCT is more sensitive than radiography and PFTs in determining the type and severity of emphysema, and is the best noninvasive technique for detecting early emphysema. Localization of smoking induced emphysema within the secondary pulmonary lobule with radiologic-pathologic correlation and distinction from other types of emphysema (panlobular, paraseptal) as well as the functional -CT correlation will be explored. The entity of respiratory bronchiolitis, which is invariably associated with cigarette smoking, will be discussed as a possible mechanism of (early) mixed obstruction and restriction. Finally the emerging role of hyperpolarized 3He MRI ventilation imaging in the evaluation of COPD will be briefly reviewed. Learning Objectives: 1. To review the anatomy of the structures that can contribute to airflow obstruction as well as the pathophysiology of smoking-related COPD. 2. To discuss the radiologic and CT findings of specific diseases of the large and small airways (chronic bronchitis and bronchiolitis), and distal airspaces (centrilobular emphysema) that cause airflow obstruction in smokers and explore the functional -CT correlation. In AD, imaging studies may be normal or show general atrophy that is often more pronounced in the parietal and temporal regions, particularly the hippocampi. Temporo-parietal hypoperfusion is often found. Proton MRS may show low Nacetylaspartate (NAA) and elevated myoinositol. In frontotemporal dementia (FTD), the atrophy and hypoperfusion are predominantly frontal and temporal. Changes in the underlying white matter are seen in AD as well as in FTD. Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) is a rare disorder that is prion related. CT and MRI are often negative or show only atrophy in most CJD patients. Increased T2 signal in the cortex (particularly in the occipital lobes), thalami and basal ganglia is characteristic. MR diffusion imaging shows these abnormalities better.",

The internal auditory canal (IAC) is studied using MRI: T1 without and with gadolinium injection, 3D high resolution T2 (HRT2). The anterior part of the IAC is occupied by the cochlear nerve and the facial nerve, the posterior part has the utricula ampullary nerve at the top and the saccular and postero ampullary nerve at the bottom. The main pathology encountered is a schwannoma of the eighth nerve which may originate in any of the vestibular and cochlear components studied by reformatted sagittal HRT2. The relationship of the facial, mixed nerves, and the jugular foramen must be precisely evaluated regarding the distance to the fundus of the IAC and the signal of the labyrinth. Other tumours that are not as frequent include the meningioma (whose diagnosis may be difficult compared with the schwannoma if located exclusively in the IAC), the lipoma (diagnosed using the fatty content) and vascular malformations (detected by angioMR).

Sigal; Villejuif/FR In the last 5 years a dramatic increase in imaging modality performance, as well as image processing performance has occurred. This has resulted in more radiological procedures, more procedures per patient and more images per procedures. At the same time, there is worldwide shortage of radiologists. This presentation will expose some needs to overcome this actual and potential state of \"image harassment\". Display solutions, post processing and CAD technology will improve, allowing better handling of large image data sets. Solutions could include a variety of new tools such as combination of cine mode, 2D, 3D; paging on thicker slices; automatic registration; dynamic hanging protocols, and new input devices for navigation. PACS reading and advanced post processing capabilities should become functionally integrated in one software environment. Integration with Electronic Patient Record and link with reference knowledge should also help to interpret the radiological images. Distribution to referring physicians will change. Radiological images may be selected and presented under a variety of formats (2D, 3D, dynamic) with additional information (patient relevant clinical, biological and pathologic data) and knowledge references. One of the challenges will be the access of clinicians to advanced processed data, in their own clinical workflow. Solutions could be to customize data (full 3D sets) according to the needs of the clinicians. The data presented are meant to stimulate further thinking, particularly regarding clinical domains of application, tools, workflows and cost/revenues impacts of large image data sets.

The main indication for uterine artery embolization (UAE) is represented by a bleeding intra-mural myoma less than 10 cm in diameter, in patients with no wish of future pregnancy. The absolute contraindications are patients with asymptomatic uterine fibroids, pedunculated, subserosal and submucous myomas. There are relative contraindications (fibroids bigger than 10 cm in diameter, large submucous myomas, desire of pregnancy). Other contraindications are: contrast allergy, renal failure, bleeding diathesis, gynecological malignancy, active pelvic infection. Before the procedure, all patients require a gynaecologic history and physical examination to exclude other pathologies, laboratory test and cross-sectional images. Magnetic resonance imaging is more sensitive and accurate than US in evaluating the endometrium, excluding adenomyosis or any other pathologies. During the procedure adequate sedation and analgesia is achieved, in our practice, with midazolam and fentanyl. Concerning the approach, the unilateral right common femoral artery is preferred for access. We will discuss about which endpoint is the best? After the procedure the most important is to control the pain. The degree of pain is variable. We use nonsteroidal IV anti-inflammatory agents during 24 hours.

After the procedure the most important complications are: post-embolization syndrome (15 -25%), vaginal discharge (20 -50%) and sloughing fibroids (3% -6%). The use of high resolution multislice spiral CT for volume imaging in spiral mode has led to a new enthusiasm for CT. Although CT examinations constitute only 4 -6% of all X-ray examinations in Germany, they cause more than 30% of the exposure due to medical X-ray applications. This background has added to the interest in reducing dose in CT examinations. Dose in multislice spiral CT can be reduced by online tube current modulation by typically 15 to 30%, depending on the patient shape and the anatomical region scanned. In general, no deterioration of image quality was observed. In some cases the noise pattern was improved because streaks along the direction of maximum attenuation were reduced. Additionally, a new method, the multidimensional adaptive filtering (MAF) technique significantly improves image quality and the diagnostic accuracy as compared to the standard reconstruction by reducing noise levels and by removing noise structures in the images. In clinical studies noise is reduced significantly for critical regions like the thoracic inlet and the pelvis without any loss of image sharpness, whereas the image quality of the upper neck or the abdomen remained unchanged. The differentiation of anatomical and pathological structures is enhanced in particular in the supraclavicular regions and the pelvis. Especially small lymph nodes in the supraclavicular region and perirectal can be reliably detected and distinguished from artifacts.

Radiology plays an essential role in gastrointestinal hemorrhage (G-H) and ischemia (G-I). CT has as high a sensitivity as angiography in detecting vascular occlusions. Moreover, 3D CT-angiography provides additional information for planning therapeutic strategies. A bleeding source can be detected with CT and MR and a rapid intravenous bolus of contrast, with rates of less than 0.1 ml/min. Angiography with iodine or CO 2 has a comparable sensitivity (0.1-0.4 ml/min) but is superior in detecting indirect signs of the possible lesion. Endovascular techniques have an important role in G-I either alone or with surgery. In acute G-I there is a choice between surgical embolectomy or infusion of fibrinolitics. Patients with chronic G-I should be treated either with surgical revascularization or with dilatation and/or stenting. In G-E hemostasis can be obtained with embolization and its indications will depend on the bleeding source and the clinical situation. Embolization is particularly indicated in hemobilia, in aneurysms or vascular malformations of the gut, or in cases in which endoscopic techniques fail.",

Indium labelled white cell scintigraphy and Gallium scintigraphy are reserved for those patients in whom there is a high clinical suspicion of abdominal sepsis but CT has not revealed a source of sepsis. Scintigraphy is also used in patients with suspected vascular graft infections or suspected infected hip prostheses. Percutaneous abscess drainage (PAD) has revolutionised the treatment of abdominal abscesses over the last 20 years with repeat laparotomy for post-operative abscesses becoming a rare event. Ultrasound or CT guidance can be used to guide PAD. Choosing an access route that does not cross intervening organs is of crucial importance to the safe performance of PAD. The Trocar or Seldinger techniques can be used with equal success. The cavity should be aspirated until dry and irrigated with saline. Repeat imaging after drainage is helpful to detect any undrained locules. PAD endpoints include patient defervescence, reduction in white blood cell count and catheter drainage of less than 10 mls per day. Details regarding PAD in specific abdominal regions are discussed. Success rate for PAD are high (close to 90%) in most abdominal organs. Slightly lower success rates are seen with PAD of pancreatic abscesses and abscesses associated with fistulas (60-85% success rates). Complication rates lie between 0-10%. Complications can be minimised by ensuring that the patient has broad spectrum antibiotic coverage before drainage, by carefully planning the access route and by ensuring diligent post-procedure care. Cinematic MRI examination allows to study both anatomy and functional changes during active and passive motion, improves the diagnostic accuracy of MRI especially in detecting dynamic instability patterns, transitory subluxation and bony or soft tissue impingement syndromes that affect the wrist and are not often sufficiently characterized using static view MR techniques. Dynamic MRI may passively and actively test the joint. The provocative test (acquisition performed under load or against stress) is the simplest dynamic MRI examination and may be helpful in some cases. The incremental passive positioning technique offers the possibility to evaluate the complex relationship between carpal bones; it can be performed in coronal plane images while the wrist joint is passively and incrementally moved from ulnar to radial deviation or in sagittal plane images while the the wrist is moved from flexion-neutral-extension position.",

            "text": "The formation of new blood vessels is critical for tumour survival and growth. Tumour and stromal cells release angiogenic factors, which stimulate the proliferation, migration and morphogenesis of endothelial cells. Three processes are involved in vascular morphogenesis: Angiogenesis, sprouting of new capillaries from pre-existing ones; vasculogenesis, in situ differentiation of a primary capillary plexus from haemangioblastic stem cells; intusseption, branching of a capillary by longitudinal splitting. Hypoxia and acidosis, in the tumour microenvironment, strongly stimulate the release of angiogenic growth factors such as VEGFs and PIGF. Angiogenic stimulators include FGFs, TGFs, angiogenin, IL-8, HGF, GCSF and PD-ECGF. VEGFs, among the most effective agents, promote both angiogenesis and vascular permeability. Autocrine and paracrine processes are associated with endothelial cell activity involving cytokines, adhesion molecules and chemokines. Net neovascularisation is determined by the balance of angiogenic and angiostatic stimuli. The negative regulators include thrombospondin, angiostatin, and angiopoietins. A number of angiosuppressive drug are in development. Strong angiogenic activity (glioblastoma>renal>colon>mammary>lung>prostate) is associated with poorer prognosis and increased metastasis. Its evaluation can be used as prognostic marker. Techniques of proliferating endothelial cells labelling have been developed to specifically identify angiogenesis. The proliferating capillary index is used to compare tumour angiogenesis with physiological angiogenesis in the ovary. The faster the growth of the tumour, the less mature is the vessel bed. Immature microvessels are distorted irregular and hyper permeable, which has an impact on their efficiency and capabilities. The poor hemodynamic characteristics of the tumours can be non-invasively assessed by dynamic contrast-enhanced imaging. A simple and effective method for imaging tumour angiogenesis would not only provide an independent marker of cancer prognosis, but also be of benefit for monitoring anti-angiogenesis drugs. This presentation highlights the simplicity of dynamic contrast enhanced (DCE) CT for imaging angiogenesis. CT assessment of angiogenesis simply requires a bolus injection of conventional contrast material followed by either rapid imaging without table movement or a spiral volume acquisition at a time previously determined using a test bolus. Hence DCE-CT is widely available and readily incorporated into existing CT protocols that continue to provide the mainstay for size-based assessments of tumour response (e.g. RECIST) in both clinical oncology and research. The simplicity of DCE-CT favours successful and consistent data collection in multi-centre studies. Temporal changes in contrast enhancement are linearly related to changes in concentration making absolute quantification of tumor perfusion, blood-volume and permeability straightforward and reproducible irrespective of the observer or analysis methodology. Measurements have been validated against a number of reference methods and correlate with histopathological assessments of angiogenesis. Derivation of the Standardised Perfusion Value can correct for changes in cardiac output that may occur with some anti-angiogenesis drugs. A range of commercial software packages is now available for calculating functional CT parameters with generation of colour-coded parametric maps. DCE-CT can be performed on integrated PET/CT systems with the potential for advanced characterisation of tumour biology. CT-based angiogenesis imaging is similar in complexity and concept to routine CT angiography, but depicts the tumour microcirculation rather than discrete vessels. Learning Objectives: 1.

Acquisition and processing protocols for CT angiogenesis imaging are straightforward, producing reproducible results that have been validated against reference methods including histopathological assessments of angiogenesis. 3. DCE-CT can be performed on integrated PET/CT systems with the potential for advanced characterisation of tumour biology through simultaneous assessment of tumour angiogenesis and glucose metabolism. Although cardiac ultrasound is applicable for the evaluation of cardiac function in a variety of disease states, the main issue in the pediatric age group is congenital heart disease (CHD). Till the 1980's cardiac catheterisation and angiocardiography (C&A) were the only means to establish a diagnosis in CHD. With the availability of 2D-echocardiography non-invasive diagnosis became possible and the subsequent evolution of 2D-echo, colorflow mapping and Doppler modalities turned it into the imaging modality of choice for infants and children.",

            "text": "The sequential segmental analysis forms the basis of CHD diagnosis. This analysis is based on the anatomic characteristics of the cardiac chambers and the various possibilities of connections between these chambers. Precordial and subcostal approaches should give a complete visualisation of all cardiac structures. The study starts with the systemic and pulmonary veins and works its way through the atria and the ventricles to the aorta and pulmonary arteries. 2D-echo depicts the anatomy and colorflow mapping, while pulsed & CW Doppler are added to assess hemodynamics. This approach requires multiple scans rather than just the recording of pre-defined imaging planes. The reliability of echocardiography for the primary diagnosis has been established through studies comparing echo with C&A and with intraoperative findings. However, echocardiography is an interactive tool and the reliability is highly operator-dependent. In the follow-up of postoperative and adult patients complete evaluation with echocardiography is not always possible. Additional imaging modalities are needed in this growing population. The population of adults with congenital heart disease is increasing and it is estimated that 80-85% of patients born with congenital heart disease survive to adulthood. In the U.K. alone an additional 2,500 patients are added to this population annually and over half of these need access to specialist attention. MR imaging offers much more utility and repeatability than cardiac angiography, and in some areas it can provide information not achieved by invasive techniques. The alternative non-invasive technique of echocardiography is frequently inadequate in adult patients with complex functional and anatomical problems. Cardiac MR offers a wide range of investigational options, each patient having unique individual problems. Fast gradient echo sequences can show structural (black blood static images) and functional (white blood cin\u00e9 sequences) anatomy in complex oblique planes. Velocity encoding can measure volume flow at specific sites, enabling calculation of cardiac output, differential vessel flow and regurgitant fraction. Peak velocity measurement can estimate intracardiac pressure drops. Intravenous Gadolinium injection allows 3D volume acquisition of complex vessels as well as opening the way to myocardial perfusion and viability studies. These techniques offer a complex range of possibilities for each patient and hence an individual protocol is selected for each patient to optimise the benefits of the limited patient time in the magnet. A detailed audit of our GUCH MRI examinations has demonstrated the utility of the technique in a variety of conditions and reflects the clinical feedback from the paediatric cardiologists who use the service. In patients with a known primary extrathoracic malignancy, staging investigations will commonly include radiological examination of the chest. Whilst most patients will be referred for a plain chest radiograph, there is a limit to the size (typically around 1 cm diameter) of pulmonary nodules detectable by conventional radiography. Because the contrast resolution of computed tomography (CT) is higher and there is no anatomical superimposition, small intrapulmonary nodules will frequently be identified; this is particularly true with the wider availability of spiral (and now, multidetector row) CT machines and the concommitant capacity for subsecond image acquisition. However, determining the significance of focal intrapulmonary nodules in patients with a known extrathoracic cancer, remains a vexing problem for the radiologist and clinician. The significance of imaging findings (specifically at CT) in patients with underlying malignancy will be discussed. The potential importance of the multiplicity and size of pulmonary nodules will be reviewed. HRCT features, criteria to extablish the diagnosis and differential diagnosis will be discussed. Imaging findings will be discussed. MR imaging plays a major role in the diagnosis and management of patients with epilepsy, allowing the direct demonstration of the anatomical lesions which can be related to epileptic discharges. Negative or positive MR results are now considered for classification of epileptic patients as cryptogenetic or symptomatic. The best quality MR examination is mandatory and it should be focused on the area of the brain suspected as the epileptogenic zone (EZ), that is the cortical area of seizure generation and propagation. The definition of the EZ is a major task in patients candidated to surgery, since it can influence the surgical planning and the extent of surgical resection. Different pre-surgical strategies can be fol-lowed for this purpose, including clinical observation, electrophysiological and imaging modalities. MRI findings may influence the pre-surgical work-up, suggesting or excluding the need for invasive electro-clinical investigation. The emergence of functional MR (fMR) studies for localizing brain activity has significantly expanded the potential clinical role of MR providing information on the topographic relationship between the structural lesions and the eloquent areas of the brain. Various types of malformation of cortical development (MCD), particularly focal cortical dysplasias (FCD), together with tumours were the most frequent neuropathological substrates found in our surgical series. Correlation between MRI, histopathological and electro-clinical data in more than 450 patients, with refractory partial epilepsy, operated on since June 1996 at the Epilepsy Surgery Centre \"Claudio Munari\" of Niguarda Hospital in Milano, will be presented.

It is special in children because immaturity favours seizures, because the clinical pattern is age-related and changes with brain maturation, because of common neonatal developmental and genetic aetiologies and because deleterious effects of epilepsy on the psycho-intellectual development makes early and efficient treatment mandatory. Classified on electro-clinical data into benign idiopathic (normal brain), symptomatic (abnormal brain) and cryptogenic (abnormality likely but unproved) epilepsies. It is often associated with mental delay and/or cerebral palsy. Imaging tools: The best available technology, MRI, to be used first with proper reference planes, varied sequences adapted to the brain maturation (T2 with very long TR/long TE) and high resolution millimetric slices (cortical assessment). Cortex is blurred during the intermediate stages of maturation and use of FLAIR is uncertain before four years. Sedation, or preferably anesthesia, is mandatory in young or un-cooperative children. Indications: Preliminary electro-clinical assessment is always needed as imaging epilepsy is never an emergency. Idiopathic epilepsies by definition are not investigated. Symptomatic/cryptogenic epilepsies are investigated for diagnosis and for surgery, when needed.",

The identification of the precise epileptogenic focus producing seizures is crucial to a good outcome. Identification of the eloquent cerebral areas near the region to be resected is also essential to prevent post-operative neurological deficit. MR imaging is the most important neuroimaging modality in the investigation of adult patients with the medically intractable epilepsy. Functional MR imaging has an established role in the evaluation of patients prior to epilepsy surgery by identifying language, memory and sensorimotor areas of the cerebral cortex. PET imaging may be more sensitive in some patients with unremarkable MR imaging findings, however it does not confer specificity of etiological diagnosis and it is technically demanding and cost intensive. This lecture highlights the role of modern imaging modalities in the work-up of adult intractable epilepsy, MR imaging techniques and findings in such cases and an overview of supportive data provided from functional MR, MR spectroscopy and PET studies. This lecture also briefly summarizes new developments about the imaging modalities and techniques in epilepsy, including advanced functional MR imaging, receptor PET studies, magnetic source imaging and high fieldstrength MR tools with magnets of 3 Tesla and above that are becoming clinical tools and have the promise of improving diagnosis. The normal radiological anatomy of the neck is reviewed, emphasizing spatial anatomy as defined by the neck fascial layers. Although the fascias themselves are not visible in the normal situation, such a spatial approach to neck anatomy gives a method to analyze the images and allows the building of a differential diagnosis of diseases unique to each space. Another point discussed will be the normal anatomy, classification and radiologic appearance of the neck lymph nodes. Imaging of the neck can be performed using different modalities, including ultrasonography, CT and MRI. As each modality has advantages and disadvantages, a well-considered choice, tailored to the individual patient, is necessary to get cost-efficient results. Furthermore, attention to technical details is essential to obtain images of sufficient diagnostic quality. Learning Objectives: 1. To provide a systematic review of neck anatomy from a radiological point of view, emphasizing spatial anatomy. 2. To become familiar with the relative advantages and disadvantages of the available imaging modalities for neck imaging. 3. To learn the basic technical requirements for adequate neck imaging.",

Patient's age, history and symptoms will dictate the choice of the proper imaging modality. Neck masses in children tend to be benign; most have a fluid content and can be approached, at first, with US. In adults, non-nodal and non-thyroidal masses of the neck can be grouped into inflammatory, vascular, neural and other neoplastic lesions. Acute inflammatory neck lesions (cellulitis, abscess) can rapidly spread into the mediastinum or towards the skull base. Therefore, these lesions require a precise and prompt assessment of their extent, usually achieved by CT. The differentiation of a non-thyroidal, non-nodal neck mass among vascular, neural and other neoplastic lesions is a different problem. Generally, the diagnosis is adequately obtained by combining spatial information (i.e. the anatomic compartment from which the mass arises) with its intrinsic imaging findings (liquid/solid content, vascularization, degree of enhancement, margins). Particularly, the epicenter of the mass and the pattern of adjacent structure displacement play an essential role in the diagnostic process. US, CT and MR can be used. A part from submucosal (pharynx/larynx/oral cavity) lesions, which require cross sectional imaging (CT or MR), US is generally used for more superficial masses. If a vascular/highly vascularized mass is suspected on US, angio-MR or multislice CT are indicated. MR better examines lesions that bear potential relationships with the spinal cervical canal, the skull base or the brachial plexus. Learning Objectives:",

In patients with larger oropharyngeal and laryngeal tumors, a CT or MRI will be obtained in most cases for imaging size and extent of the primary tumor. However, the accuracy of these modalities may be too low in many cases to differentiate between benign and malignant metastastic disease and additional imaging may be needed. UsgFNAC proves to be a more accurate technique for assessment of the status of the neck. Ultrasound guided fine needle aspiration cytology has gained popularity in staging the clinically N0 neck in patients with head and neck carcinomas, especially in patients in which a wait-and-see policy is considered. On the one hand it can be used to upstage the N0 neck, thus enabling adequate treatment, on the other hand it can give more certainty that the neck is really free of metastases and consequently the clinician may refrain from neck dissection and perform a strict follow-up.

Kauczor; Heidelberg/DE Tumor angiogenesis is initiated by hypoxia, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), angiopoietins and the interaction of tumor and stromal cells. Using different dynamic MR-techniques, including BOLD imaging, the functional aspects of angiogenesis such as changes of tumor blood volume and flow (\"perfusion\") as well as vessel permeability and maturation can be visualized. To this end, macromolecular contrast agents such as gadolinium labeled albumin or labeled graft polymers improve accuracy. In addition, metabolic consequences of angiogenesis and its inhibition can be assessed non-invasively using proton-and phosphor MR-spectroscopy. The ratio of choline to (phospho-) creatine resonances and resonances of phosphodiesters change. This is a result of the altered metabolic turnover of phospholipid membranes and increasing fractions of lipids which are caused by regression of central vessels due to high intratumoral pressure and the development of necrosis. Specific imaging of angiogenesis may gain increasing importance as a novel field in functional imaging. Using anti-endothelial alpha-v beta-3 antibodies labeled with a paramagnetic contrast agent, highly detailed imaging of the angiogenic vasculature has been demonstrated in experimental tumors. As new targets for specific contrast agents, E-Selectin, intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM) and matrix fibrin were identified and used in preliminary studies. Learning Objectives: 1. MRI is capable to monitor changes of tumor vascularization during different stages of angiogenesis and during anti-angiogenic therapies. 2.

Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma is usually classified into two types, peripheral and hilar depending on their origin. Peripheral cholangiocarcinoma (PCC) usually refers to the tumor arising from the duct peripheral to the secondary confluence. While most PCCs develop in the small peripheral ducts and grow in a nodular, massive or diffuse pattern with early infiltration into the hepatic parenchyma, in rare instances, PCCs have the growth pattern of intraductal papillary cholangiocarcinoma; polypoid or papillary tumors arise from the peripheral duct and with tumor growth confined within the bile duct. Sometimes, these tumors form multiple tumor casts along the peripheral tributaries of the bile duct (upstream ducts).

The main procedure for cholangiocarcinoma is percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage (PTBD). Purposes of biliary interventions in cholangiocarcinoma are palliative bile drainage, preoperative improvement of liver function, and evaluation of tumor extension into the intrahepatic duct with choledochoscopic direct vision with biopsy. Palliative PTBD is not an indication in the early stage with mild jaundice and in late stage with multiple separation of intrahepatic bile ducts. Indications of emergency PTBD are not only septic cholangitis, but also in the cases of failed insertion of nasobiliary tube after contrast injection into the biliary tree during ERCP, in patients with biliary obstruction, for prevention of septic cholangitis. Principle of PTBD is to drain the maximum area of the liver with the minimum number of drainage tubes. Do not insert more than one drainage tube in one session. Because of advances in drainage tubes, passage across the tumor is nearly always successful and drainage of right or left lobe can prevent aggravation of liver function. Left PTBD has an advantage in patients with ascites for prevention of ascites leakage through the PTBD insertion site. Left PTBD is indicated in most of the patients with hilar cholangiocarcinoma for palliation and preoperative management because the right anterior and posterior segmental ducts are more commonly separated. Internal drainage of bile has advantages physiologically but external drainage does not have serious problems.

Mansueto; Verona/IT Acute pancreatic conditions are common and can be catastrophic; even if there is a wide range in the severity of the clinical presentations, each can be potentially life-threatening. Pancreatic infections, involvement of adjacent organs, structures and spaces by pancreatic diseases and, lastly, vascular complications are considered as acute pancreatic conditions. The role of radiology in the management of acute pancreatic conditions is twofold. First of all, the radiologist must identify the lesion and secondly, once the diagnosis has been made, he must proceed with a correct therapeutic percutaneous radiological approach whenever an interventional procedure is preferable to surgery, or is performed preoperatively to optimize its results.

Van Cleynenbreugel; Leuven/BE Acute urinary obstruction is by far the most common acute condition requiring imaging and, eventually, imaging-guided intervention. Radiologists need to define whether or not there is obstruction, determine the level and the cause, estimate the duration, the presence of complications, and define whether intervention is required to relieve obstruction. Percutaneous nephrostomy is the interventional technique of choice. Numerous catheters are available for US-, fluoroscopy-, or CT-guided procedures. An individual tailored approach is feasible, and depends on the patient's condition and the experience of the radiologist. Co-operation with the urologist is essential. Although acute pyelonephritis is a clinical diagnosis, imaging is frequently performed (US /CT). It is essential to distinguish uncomplicated from complicated pyelonephritis. In complicated pyelonephritis (pyonephrosis, renal-perirenal abscess) imaging studies are essential to evaluate the extent, to decide whether intervention is required, and to decide the most appropriate approach. Acute renal/perirenal haemorrhage requires targeted imaging to evaluate the extent, the underlying cause (angiomyolipoma,...) and will guide diagnostic and therapeutic management (embolisation, urgent or delayed surgery). Acute prostatitis complicated with abscess formation has become very rare. Transperineal US-or CT-guided drainage may be indicated to relieve pain and to hasten cure. Likewise abscesses of the scrotal wall or of the scrotal contents may be drained percutaneously. (Partial) priapism is a very rare condition requiring imaging. Ultrasonography and MR-imaging is often performed to evaluate the extent of the thrombosis and this study serves as the base line for comparative follow-up studies. Three aspects of routine pediatric imaging are especially focused on: dealing with cranial trauma and its imaging interpretation; chest CT in some of its most common indications; abdominal ultrasonography. These three topics will be presented at the cutting edge of technique, technology and clinical application. With this, controversy between the lecturers and the audience may arise and should be articulated. How far can and should we go in the attempt to diagnose abnormality by imaging means? How specific can or must be our results? -Is the traditional rule \"diagnose agressively -treat conservatively\" still valid in pediatric radiology? Isn't it even enhanced by today's imaging options?",

The incidence of pediatric head trauma is estimated to be 300 per 100,000 children per year, with deadly outcome in 10 per 100,000 children per year in the United States. The three most frequent causes of injury are accidental falls, motor vehicle accidents and the so-called non-accidental trauma (child abuse). The cause of head trauma, the location and mechanism of injury as well as the reaction of the brain to trauma varies depending on the child's age. Different kinds of direct or indirect forces (acceleration/deceleration, rotational forces) result in structural brain injury. Next to the primary brain injury that is inflicted at the moment of trauma, secondary brain injury, resulting from the brain's response to the primary injury, determines final outcome. Neuroimaging should identify the extent of acute brain injury to guide treatment in limiting primary and secondary brain injury. Learning Objectives: 1.

            "text": "The need for chest CT in children C. Owens; London/UK This presentation will discuss applications of CT in the evaluation of chest disease in children. The majority of children requiring thoracic CT fall in to three basic groups, hence, three basic protocols suffice for most chest CT examinations in children. Metastatic disease, focal lung pathology or mediastinal mass/ adenopathy will allow scanning with thicker beam collimation and lower pitch factors preserving risk from inappropriate over dosage. Vascular or airways disease may require thinner collimation and higher pitches. MRI may therefore be more appropriate in these patients. In diffuse lung disease, sequential scans with thin collimation and high spatial frequency reconstructions are the established optimal technique. Tube current (MA) and kilo voltage KV should be kept to the lowest allowing diagnostic quality images and depend on patient size and weight. Very occasionally volumetric and high resolution images are required in the same patient. There are many controversial issues within applications of pediatric chest CT and it is vital that the radiologist is constantly questioning the added diagnostic role of CT over the other alternative non ionising examinations (e.g. MRI) when available and appropriate. The presentation will discuss potential controversy within the assessment of children requiring thoracic CT. Volumetric techniques are greatly improved by multislice spiral CT scanners that can scan large volumes with narrow slice collimation. These new scanners confirm that they now allow the radiologists to increase the diagnostic accuracy and clinical indications of volumetric scanning not only by means of high-resolution transverse CT sections but also by means of high-quality 2D and 3D images. Multiplanar reformatting creates sagittal, coronal or curved imaging planes providing unique displays for the transverse images. Volume rendering techniques address some of the limitations of shaded-surface display techniques. MIP rendering can be applied to either the entire imaged volume or can be targeted to a thin slab of tissue. All reformatting and volume-rendering techniques provide optimal results when applied to motion-free, three-dimensional data sets composed of isometric voxels. The purpose of this lecture is to focus on practical aspects of CT angiographic techniques aimed at evaluating thoracic vessels (aorta excepted). Learning Objectives: 1. To review the acquisition and reconstruction protocols for optimal imaging of thoracic vessels. The normal radiographic and cross-sectional anatomy of thoracic aorta, great vessels and mediastinal veins will be reviewed along with a description of the most common variants. A detailed knowledge of the wide range of congenital abnormalities that may involve the aortic arch is fundamental for a correct interpretation of the mediastinum, in order to avoid misdiagnoses. The most common anomaly of the aorta is an aberrant right subclavian artery originating from a normal left-sided arch, occurring in approximately 0.5% of the population. The proximal portion of the aberrant artery is frequently dilated, a finding known as diverticulum of Kommerel. A right aortic arch is present in about 0.1 -0.2% of subjects and in approximately 70% of cases is associated with an aberrant left subclavian artery. The presence of a left ligamentum arteriosum completes the vascular ring in most of such patients.",

Indications for long-term venous access are increasing and insertion of a tunnelled central venous catheter is one of the most frequently requested radiological procedures. Perhaps the largest group of patients requiring a long-term venous catheter are those with malignancy who require systemic chemotherapy, blood products and repeated blood sampling over a prolonged period. Others indications are total parenteral nutrition, bone marrow transplantation, patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome who require long-term chemotherapy and patients requiring long-term dialysis catheters. Tunnelled catheters were initially inserted in operating theatres by surgeons but there has been a gradual trend in many centres towards their placement by radiologists for financial and clinical reasons. There are a wide variety of available devices including tunnelled catheters, implantable ports and peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs). The usual site of venous access for most devices is the internal jugular vein or the subclavian veins. In patients with access problems when these routes are not available alternative approaches have to be considered. This workshop will focus on the method of insertion via collateral veins in the neck and the use of external jugular veins, femoral veins, the inferior vena cava and hepatic veins. Relative advantages and disadvantages of these routes will be discussed and the incidence and management of complications. ",

Systematic screening of the bone marrow requires investigation of the pelvis and proximal femurs in addition to the spine study.For lesion detection, T1-weighted images are often sufficient and lesions have low signal intensity. Fat-saturated T2-or intermediate-weighted images, or STIR images are also efficient in lesion detection that generally have intermediate to high signal intensity. These sequences and contrast-enhanced T1-weighted images become mandatory to differentiate diffuse neoplastic marrow infiltration from abnormally cellular albeit normal marrow. In terms of lesion characterization, MRI plays little role because MRI patterns of neoplastic marrow involvement are non-specific: focal lesions and diffuse infiltration are observed in metastates, lymphoma and multiple myeloma. However, some subtle features sometimes help in the differential diagnosis:concurrent observation of diffuse bone marrow signal alterations, focal lesions and compression fractures are indicative of myeloma; combination of bone lesions with paraspinal or pelvic tumoral lymph nodes and extra-osseous tumor spread without alteration of the bone cortices suggest lymphoma; \u2026 The radiologist must be aware of some benign conditions which may mimic tumoral lesions: benign diffuse or focal bone marrow hyperplasia, intravertebral disk herniations, acute vertebral compression fractures, infectious lesions, \u2026.

CT anatomy and pathology of the peritoneum and small bowel with MRI correlation F. Maccioni; Rome/ITThe peritoneal cavity is a potential space contained between the parietal and visceral peritoneum. The abdominal intra-peritoneal organs are suspended and connected by several infolds of visceral peritoneum, called ligaments, mesenteries or omenta, representing a link between intraperitoneal and retroperitoneal organs and spaces. These relationships can explain the pathways of spread of many benign and malignant diseases affecting the peritoneal cavity and its organs. The adult peritoneal cavity is divided by the transverse mesocolon into two main spaces: the sovramesocolic and inframesocolic space. The embryology is the key to understanding the anatomy of the peritoneal cavity, especially of the sovramesocolic compartment. At the fifth week of fetal age, the peritoneal cavity consists of two main spaces separated by the primitive gut, attached to the anterior and posterior abdominal wall by a ventral and dorsal mesentry.The complexity of the adult sovramesocolic space derives from the development of the liver within the anterior mesentery and the growth of the spleen and pancreas in the posterior mesentery. In the sovramesocolic space, the right and left peritoneal spaces remain separated and are further subdivided in different subcompartments, four for each side. Conversely, the adult inframesocolic space is less anfractuous because the ventral mesentery reabsorbs completely, and the midgut (the small bowel) remains attached posteriorly by its dorsal mesentery, so that the right and left spaces can freely communicate across the midline. Learning Objectives: 1. To understand the anatomy of the adult sovra-and inframesocolic spaces, showing the appearance of the main ligaments, omenta and mesenteries at CT and MRI. 2. To comprehend the relationships between intra and retroperitoneal compartments. 3. To show the pathways of spread of the main pathologic benign and malignant abdominal diseases through ligaments, mesenteries and omenta. 4.

Grampp; Vienna/AT Basis for the diagnosis of osteoporosisis the conventional radiograph, dual-X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) (femur, lumbar spine), and quantitative computed tomography (QCT) (lumbar spine). Conventional radiographs yield a relatively low sensitivity and cannot be used as a screening method. For economical reasons and because of the low radiation dose, DXA is of the most clinical relevance. After an initial radiograph of the lumbar spine either a DXA of this region (patients up to 65 and without significant degenerative changes) or at the hip (patients above 65 or with significant degenerative changes) should be performed. In special cases or if such a device is readily available a QCT of the lumbar spine might be a first-evaluation technique. General data for the application densitometry with quantitative ultrasound (QUS) do currently not allow a general recommendation for use in diagnosis. The methods, is currently regarded as an additional technique and can be used for prescreening to identify healthy women and men. Learning Objectives:1. To know the clinically relevant methods to measure and monitor the skeletal status such as DXA, QCT and conventional radiographs. 2. To get the ability in using strategies to apply the radiological methods in the primary diagnosis as well as in follow-up studies and in different patient groups.3.

CT perfusion imaging is performed by using serial and rapid CT imaging following a bolus infusion of contrast material. CT perfusion provides both anatomical and functional information in that cerebral blood volume (CBV) and the velocity of flow as mean transit time (MTT) and thereby cerebral blood flow (CBF) can be measured. The method is well validated in animal models and humans. A rise in CBV reflects an intact cerebral autoregulation and indicates functioning cerebral vessels. A drop of CBV under normal values indicates post ischemic hypoperfusion and the core of the prospective infarct. Learning Objectives:1. To comprehend the role of native CT, contrast enhanced CT, CTA and CTperfusion in acute stroke. 2. To understand the pathophysiology of hemodynamic and thrombembolic blood flow impairment. 3. To understand the concept of penumbra and tissue at risk in respect to thrombolysis. 4. To learn the guidelines and recommendations for perfusion imaging.A-158How to use MR in acute stroke I. Berry; Toulouse/FR MR in acute stroke intends to confirm the existence of a brain lesion before it becomes irreversible. Three methods can be of use: diffusion-weighted MRI (DW-MRI), perfusion-weighted MRI (PW-MRI) and MR angiography (MRA) which can be obtained in emergency with an examination duration of half an hour. DW-MRI assesses cytotoxic edema; PW-MRI, cerebral blood flow and MRA, large vessel permeability. All these pathophysiological mechanisms contributing to the constitution of parenchymal damage can be identified on a qualitative basis in emergency and quantified producing parametric imaging: i.e. apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) for DW-MRI, cerebral blood volume (CBV), flow (CBF) and mean transit time (MTT) for PW-MRI, blood velocity for MRA. These postprocessing steps are time, computer ressources and expertise demanding and correspond to a level of need different from what is applicable/desirable in emergency. On the other hand these parameters are important for research purposes, namely for the goal of reversibility threshold identification. If such thresholds prove to exist, postprocessing should, after proper evaluation, be transfered back to procedures applicable in emergency. Meanwhile the use of MRI in emergency stroke relies on depiction of hyper-intensities on DW-MRI, hyper-intensities on PW-MRI displayed at the maximum effect of a gadolinium bolus and vessel occlusions diagnosed on MRA. The empirical information for patient management is derived from the coherence between vessel occlusion and parenchymal alterations, namely diffusion/perfusion mismatch of extension. Learning Objectives:1. To understand the difference between raw image acquisition of DW-MRI, PW-MRI and parametric imaging of ADC, CBV, CBF, MTT. 2. To identify an acute stroke lesion on DW-MRI and on PF-MRI while chosing the appropriate display meeting emergency time constraints.",

Vascular ultrasound serves as a decision-maker in peripheral, carotid and renal arterial disease, in detection and follow-up of arterial aneurysms and in demonstration of venous thrombosis. Follow-up after therapy is mainly accomplished by ultrasound, too. CE-MRA and CTA compete with vascular ultrasound, and the results of this competition will influence clinical decision pathways under the scope of new reimbursement strategies. This review focusses on the potential impact of new ultrasound techniques and deals with the role of signal enhancers. Transducer improvement, digital beam forming and signal processing, extended field and 3D/4D techniques, imaging modes like tissue harmonic imaging and excitation techniques (e.g., B-flow) improve resolution, spatial understanding and demonstrability. Contrast agents based on different microbubble designs are available for enhancing signals in greyscale as well as in Doppler studies. Contrast enhancers can be combined with bubblespecific modes for semi-selective demonstration of bubble location (e.g., contrast harmonic imaging).Above all, the general technical improvements of US technology helped to improve US capabilities in vascular imaging. Many new techniques as well as contrast agents are supplementary tools (sometimes toys...) in weak signal situations like in renal arteries, tight carotid stenoses and transcranial Doppler. BUT: All new tools do not reduce the main challenges in vascular ultrasound: training, standardization and establishment of cost-effective pathways for work-up of vascular disease.

By the end of this presentation the audience should have a good understanding of the clinical and technical aspects of TIPS. Stentgrafts in abdominal aorta C. Rabbia; Turin/IT Elective replacement with a synthetic graft has proven to be the most appropriate method to prevent AAA rupture for nearly forty years. Operative mortality rates have decreased during the time and now range from 2% to 5% in most recent experiences of elective aneurysm repair. However most patients with AAA are elderly and those with significant cardiopulmonary diseased have increased perioperative risk. In addition, patients undergoing open surgical repair experience significant morbidity, with 15% -30% complications rates.Endovascular AAA repair with transfemoral placement of a stent-graft within the aneurysm sac has generated great interest and provides a new and less invasive alternative to open surgical repair. A number of endovascular devices have been developed with favorable early results. Learning Objectives: 1. Know the clinical significance and the natural history of abdominal aortic aneurysm and the treatment options. 2. Know the therapeutic options with special regard to early and late results after open surgery. 3. Describe the stent-grafts currently in use, their characteristics and their mode of deployment. 4.

Otal; Toulouse/FR Various endovascular techniques have become viable therapeutic alternatives in the treatment of patients with many types of descending thoracic aortic pathology and aortic dissections. Descending thoracic aortic aneurysms can be successfully treated using stent grafts. This technique is less invasive and is associated with acceptable morbidity and mortality rates. Patients who are particularly likely to benefit include the very elderly population; those with markedly compromised cardiac, pulmonary, or renal status; and individuals who have previously undergone complex operations on the thoracic aorta. In case of aortic dissection, implantation of a stentgraft in the true lumen at the level of the thoracic entry excludes the false lumen with subsequent decrease in pressure and compression on the true lumen, and restores the flow in the true lumen and aortic side branches. In addition, exclusion of the antegrade blood flow in the false lumen and the decreased pressure resulting allows thrombosis of the false channel and prevent aortic rupture or progressive dilatation. Fenestration or infrarenal stent placement can also be used alone or after stentgraft insertion.

It contains the trigeminal, facial, intermediate and vestibulocochlear nerves, the peripheral loop of the AICA and the petrosal vein of Dandy. The most common pathological processes are tumors, originating from the structures located within the cistern or anatomical structures forming its boundaries. The most common are acoustic schwannomas with distant second most common the meningiomas. Epidermoids, arachnoid cysts and neurinomas of other cranial nerves are relatively rare. The CPA cistern may also be secondarily involved by intra-and extraaxial tumors originating outside the cistern such as chordomas, chondrosarcomas, paragangliomas, meningiomas of the tentorium and the foramen magnum, and exophytic gliomas of the brain stem.

            "text": "Aim: To present current theories for pathogenesis of UTI and renal scarring in infancy and childhood, with special regard to new insights concerning the role of VUR. Background: For a long time VUR and UTI were considered the only risk factors for renal scarring. Today, a wider spectrum of contributing conditions are thought to pose different clinical consequences and require different imaging approaches. In particular, renal scarring causes long term sequalae (hypertension, RNP, renal insufficiency). Therefore renal involvement in UTI and the development of renal scarring have to be focused both clinically and from the point of imaging. VUR today is considered only one issue in a list of factors such as treatment onset, bacterial virulence, immunological factors, genetic disposition, anatomical variants, and voiding dysfunctions. The reliable assessment of acute PN as the clinical key feature for deciding on further imaging is crucial -improper assess-To present new insights concerning the role of VUR.3. To demonstrate, that VUR today is not considered the only risk factors for renal scarring in childhood. 4. To point out the wider spectrum of contributing conditions that now has been recognised. 5. To elucidate the different clinical consequences and different imaging approaches. 6. To appreciate that assessment of acute renal infection and renal scarring now is becoming the clinical and imaging key feature. 7. To learn about the potential of new and advanced imaging techniques that may improve and accelerate comprehensive imaging of the urinary tract. 8. To discuss the potential impact of modern imaging techniques on established imaging algorithms.B. Urinary tract infection and functional disorders of the lower urinary tractJ.-N. Dacher; Rouen/FR This postgraduate course focuses on the frequent association between urinary tract infection and functional bladder sphincter disorders which were divided by the International Children's Continence Society in two main categories referred to as unstable bladder and dysfunctional voiding. Relevant examinations including ultrasound, voiding cystourethrography, isotope studies and urodynamics, are described as well as their main advantages and drawbacks. Emphasis is put on associated vesicoureteric reflux which should not be considered the central problem in those children. Reflux is induced by distortion of the ureteric meatus, a consequence of a long-standing high pressure in the bladder. Follow-up and treatment should aim to prevent renal damage and to protect the bladder function. Learning Objectives: 1. To know the classification of functional bladder sphincter disorders in school age children. 2. To become familiar with the different examinations and strategies available to establish a reliable diagnosis. 3. To know the principles of management. 4. To know the appropriate diagnostic procedures and management of associated vesicoureteric reflux.Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are a common cause of morbidity in children. The distinction between upper and lower tract UTI is clinically difficult but important, as permanent renal damage can occur when the UTI involves the kidneys. Children with a history of UTI need investigated promptly and thoroughly. The goal of imaging in UTI is to aid in the diagnosis of acute pyelonephritis, to identify those children who are at high risk of developing permanent renal damage, and to confirm and monitor the presence of renal scarring. This lecture will review the role of imaging in each of these aims. Immunomediated encephalitis: The course of ADEM is usually monophasic with synchronous-enhancing lesions. These lesions do not differ greatly from multiple sclerosis plaques. MS lesions are mostly symmetrical, frequently involving the corpus callosum (rarely in ADEM), rarely basal ganglia and thalami (frequently in ADEM), active plaques enhance and some inactive ones do not. Subacute encephalitis: HIV encephalitis is caused by the virus itself with slow nervous tissue \"intoxication\" (atrophy and/or leucoencephalopathy) with MRI hyperintensity on long TRWI, with regular outer borders. PML is caused by papova with lesions often being multifocal and rarely symmetrical. MRI reveals zones of high signal on T2WI and almost always low signal on T1WI with finger-like outer borders. To learn the epidemiology, neuropathology and clinical presentation of cranial viral disease in adulthood. 2. To recognise neuroradiological findings in disease, correlating these with neuropathology. 3. To know how to recommend imaging protocols appropriate to a correct examination. 4. To become familiar with differential diagnosis, pathognomonic features, and diagnostic strategies. The lecture demonstrates the various manifestations of intracranial sepsis. There are some clinical presentations which raise suspicions of the disease, other presentations which are frankly confusing. There are some radiological manifestations which are very obvious and some very subtle. Attention should always be given to the parasite versus host question. How did the infection arrive in the cranium? How did it \"beat\" the efforts of the immune system to eradicate it? Are there critical numbers of bacteria which are required for an infection to become established? Blood borne infection and direct spread of infection from paranasal sinuses will be considered. To recognise the classical radiographic features of intracranial sepsis.2. To understand that whether infection occurs or not is a balance between the number of organisms, their virulence and the host's response. 3.

Radiologic imaging has always had a primary role in the work-up of these patients. Traditionally, evaluation consisted of conventional radiography (KUB) followed by intravenous urography (IVU). With the advent of ultrasonography (US) those patients who could not safely undergo IVU could be evaluated for primary or secondary (ie. hydronephrosis) signs of obstruction. In the past several years, the introduction of unenhanced spiral CT has dramatically changed the role of the various imaging techniques in evaluation of urolithiasis. In the recent literature some authors believe that it is time for IVU to retire after 70 years of good performance. However, daily practice shows that urologists still like those \"old\" techniques. In addition, many patients have do undergo follow-up examinations for stone treatment. Complete replacement of IVU by CT for stone evaluation would excessively increase radiation dosages applied to patients with a high probability of disease recurrence.This lecture will review the pros and cons of KUB, IVU, and ultrasound. In addition, aspects of radiation dosage, requirements for further imaging, impact on urological interventions and follow-up examinations, as well as aspects on diagnostic utility and the measured clinical outcome will be addressed. T2-weighted MRU or gadolinium-enhanced T1-weighted excretory MRU is performed. Hence, stones can only be found on MR urograms by searching for filling defects. Initial studies demonstrate that MRU may be as effective as CT in the diagnosis of ureterolithiasis, whereas data concerning the value of MRU in nephrolithiais are still missing. Apart from an obviously limited value in acute urolithiasis, MRU may be a promising alternative to CT in chronic stone disease in order to provide exact knowledge of the urinary tract anatomy without repeated radiation exposure.",

Depending on the traumatic force direction lesions can be expected in some peculiar locations. Computed tomography and MRI are the most common techniques in patients who suffered brain injury. Computed tomography is currently the first imaging technique to be used in acute head injury. Using CT, scalp, bone, extra-axial and parenchymal injury can be demonstrated. It is also suitable method to follow the dynamics of lesion development giving an insight into the corresponding pathological development of the brain injury. However, magnetic resonance is more sensitive for all posttraumatic lesions except skull fractures. MR is recommended when patients become stable to appreciate the full extent of brain injury. Using DWI sequences cytoxic edema can be differentiated from vasogenic, which may have prognostic value.

Cronqvist; Lund/SE MRA and CTA are noninvasive and have, to a certain extent, replaced digital subtraction angiography (DSA) as the principal techniques in diagnostic exami-nation of the cerebral vasculature. Spiral-CTA with improved multi-detector systems offers an increased spatial resolution and reduced partial volume errors. With high field strengths, 3D time of flight (TOF) MRA allows improved depiction of small vessels due to increased SNR and longer T1 relaxation. However, CTA still requires injection of a contrast agent whereas intracranial MRA is generally used without contrast injection. CTA and MRA with source images, multiplanar reconstructions, MIP and volume rendering are almost equal to DSA to visualize aneurysms larger than 3 mm and most AVMs. CTA easily defines vascular calcifications whereas both CTA/MRA are superior to DSA for evaluation of intraluminal aneurysmal thrombosis. Contrast enhanced MRI and MRA are still favourable to delineate AVM, especially with regard to its localization and relation to surrounding anatomical structures. CTA and MRA still harbour some technical and diagnostic pitfalls that must be known by physicians using them in their daily practice. DSA is the gold standard method to evaluate cerebral circulation, flow characteristics and collateral supply especially in AVM and combined with 3D angiography is still the most sensitive technique to detect small aneurysms and vessel irregularities.

Van Zanten-Heule, T. van Ooij; Amsterdam/NL Generally, small tumours in the head and neck region are effectively treated with surgical excision and/or irradiation. The results are usually good, with relatively few long term side effects. Greatly advanced tumours (T3-T4) are more difficult to treat effectively. The tumour is either inoperable or extensive surgery with radical margins is required followed by radiation therapy. The results of this treatment can be severe mutilation and functional restrictions to speech and food intake. Following a study in the USA for patients with advanced head and neck cancer, the Netherlands Cancer Institute/Antoni van Leeuwenhoek Hospital in Amsterdam introduced this new treatment 5 years ago.

Hausegger; Klagenfurt/AT During this workshop pitfalls and complications which may occur during percutaneous nephrostomy (PCN), antegrade urteral stenting and treatment of urteral stenoses will be discussed. PCN can be performed under ultrasound or fluoroscopic guidance. Technical success-and complication-rate of the two different techniques is equal. Before PCN it is of paramount importance to have information of the anatomical situation. Nephroptosis and malrotation of the kidney must be known. Renal cysts may complicate PCN and may lead to misplacement of the catheter. When a fluoroscopically guided 2-step technique is used, it is advisable to leave the chiba-needle in place if the renal pelvis is punctured directly to avoid contrast medium extravasation. After puncturing the renal pelvis all catheter manipulations should be performed over stiff guide wires, which preferably are placed down in the ureter. Puncture of a dorsal calyx should be attempted if ureter manipulations and antegrade stenting is planed. If an anterior calyx is punctured, guidewire passage and catheter manipulations are more difficult due to increased angulation. During recanalization of ureter obstruction, submucosal guide wire passage or perforation may occur. Usually this has no clinical relevance as long as adequate drainage is maintained. If a JJ-ureter stent is inserted proper length measurement is essential. An ureter stent which is too long might cause urgency and dysuria. A short stent may dislodge and removal of the stent may become cumbersome. JJ-stent exchange should be performed at 3 months, forgotten stents may fracture and act as crystallization focus for urinary stone formation.

In RF ablation, a current induces ionic agitation which results in frictional heat production within the tissue. This heat induces cellular death via coagulation necrosis. Different RF devices are commercially avaliable for RF. These include single tip electrodes or expandible hooks electrodes. Electrodes can be placed under US (most frequently), CT or MR guidance. Treatments are performed under consious sedation or general anesthesia. Patient selection is mandatory. Multifocal disease (n > 5), lesions adjacent to bowel loops, or patients with severe coagulopaty should be considered not suitable for treatment. Lesion size is the most important factor in determining local therapeutic efficacy. Lesions larger than 4 cm have a high probability of tumor persistence after ablation. The introduction of combined procedures such as RF+embolisation (to reduce blood flow) or RF+saline injection (to increase ionic conductivity) can achieve better results especially in large lesions. The procedure is safe and well tolerated. Major complications are rare and include peritoneal hemorrhage, neoplastic seeding, intrahepatic abscesses, and intestinal perforation. Learning Objectives:1. An understanding of radiofrequency ablation-principles, techniques and equipment and appropriate case selection. 2. An appreciation of the imaging features of RFA lesions and their follow-up with regards to local recurrence. 3.

Winkler; Stuttgart/DE Due to its capability to visualize bone, bone marrow, soft tissue and the nervous structures at the same time, high-resolution, high-contrast MR-imaging is the major tool to evaluate diseases at or within the skull base in children. Results are greatly dependent on experience and knowledge. Developmental anatomy and pathology (cartilagenous portions at early age), pediatric pathophysiology (growing, more elastic skull), complex malformations, and specific childhood diseases and tumors are differentiating features from most problems in the adult. Rhabdomyosarcoma is the most common malignancy involving the skull base. Imaging should reveal lesions in which biopsy is not necessary or even hazardous such as juvenile angiofibroma or nasal encephalocele. Benign conditions such as hemangioma, fibrous dysplasia, fibromatosis, plexiform neurofibroma or histiocytosis X might simulate malignancy. Specific questions are involvement of the bone marrow, vascularization, tumor spread into foramina or canals of the skull base or into the cavernous sinus. They can only be reproducibly answered when imaging techniques are used which produce high contrast, high resolution combined with 3D, fat suppression and which permit contrast-associated time-intensity curves in all areas of interest selected by serial subtraction.Learning Objectives: 1.

Kohlmann, S. Iochum; Nancy/FR CT-arthrography and magnetic resonance imaging are the most efficient techniques to evaluate the wrist; however, standard radiography remains a valuable method to explore this region. In most situations, it is sufficient to allow a precise diagnosis and determine therapeutic protocols. However, this method can present a real diagnostic value only when it is guided by medical history and clinical data. The purpose of this presentation is to propose a practical approach for radiographic evaluation of the wrist, suited to main clinical situations. CT-scan and MRI correlations will help to understand radiographic findings.Learning Objectives: 1. To learn how to suit radiographs to the different clinical situations. 2.

Zanetti; Z\u00fcrich/CHOptimal magnetic resonance (MR) imaging of the wrist requires a high field strength magnet and a dedicated wrist coil to achieve high-resolution images. Using current MR sequences, detailed images of articular cartilage and the supporting ligaments and tendons can be obtained. Evaluation of the triangular fibrocartilage as well as intrinsic ligaments of the wrist is substantially improved by direct MR arthrography. Fast inversion recovery sequences or T2 weighted sequences with fat suppression allow for detection of osteonecrosis and fractures, which are often radiographically occult. MR imaging also provides valuable information in the evaluation of tendons and synovium in rheumatoid arthritis. Normal variants (e.g. lunate II, carpal boss), pitfalls (e.g. pseudo-DISI), and findings with high prevalence in the asymptomatic population (e.g. TFC lesion, intercarpal ligament lesion) have to be considered in the evaluation of chronic wrist pain. Learning Objectives: 1. To know the diagnostic potential of standard MRI and MR arthrography for triangular fibrocartilage lesions, ligament and tendon lesions, occult fractures, and osteonecrosis. 2. To know the clinical relevance of MR abnormalities in patients with chronic wrist pain. 3. To know the relevance of various anatomical factors in chronic wrist pain.",

Padhani; Northwood/UK This lecture focuses on 2 aspects: the intrinsic flexibility of MRI to quantify physiological phenomena relevant to the development of angiogenesis in vivo and the challenges faced by MRI techniques if they are to become widely adopted. Both contrast medium enhanced and non-enhanced MRI techniques are available. Dynamic MRI using ECF contrast agents (DCE-MRI) is most widely used in human studies. Performance and interpretation of results can be challenging for both experts and those new to the field. Even for a single technique such as DCE-MRI, it can be difficult to make meaningful comparisons of data obtained from different imaging centres because of a lack of consensus on image acquisition protocols and analysis methods. Other challenges include data acquisition and analysis methods in body parts where there is a large degree of physiological movement, heterogeneity analysis, determining measurement error, incomplete validation and the lack of readily available analysis software. Key requirements for successful implementation for multicentre studies include adequate quality assurance and the need to comply with regulatory standards. Learning Objectives:1. To appreciate the power of MRI techniques for obtaining biological information related to tumour angiogenesis and neovasculature. 2. To compare and contrast MRI techniques in terms of their biological mechanisms, sensitivity, ability for quantification and biological validation.A B C D E F G 3.To develop an understanding of the biological meaning of kinetic parameters derived from DCE-MRI using low molecular weight, extracellular contrast agents. 4. To outline challenges that need to be overcome if MRI techniques are to become useful clinical and research tools.Antivascular cancer treatment: Angiogenesis imaging in early clinical trialsA. Dzik-Jurasz; Greenford/UK; presented by A. Padhani; Northwood/UK The inhibition of tumour related angiogenesis is currently an important therapeutic target and strategic focus for drug companies. Although in vitro and animal studies provide drug kinetics and dynamics, a drug's ultimate success depends on its efficacy, safety and disease modulation action in man. Objectives of early clinical trials include: proof of concept -ideally an objective readout of the drug's intended pharmacological action; dose optimisation; analysis of the impact of treatment on tumour progression. Additional biological data on drug action or predictive and early measures of drug response are desirable. Dynamic contrast enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI) techniques can help to assess and support these objectives non-invasively in man. There are, however, a number of challenges that must be overcome before DCE-MRI is fully implemented as a clinical and research tool. These include sequence and analysis protocol standardisation, the issue of physiological motion, validation, data presentation, heterogeneity and assessing measurement error. Learning Objectives: 1. To understand the drug industry's requirements and expectations from early clinical trials of antiangiogenesis agents. 2. To understand the challenges to DCE-MRI in assessing antiangiogenesis and the role imaging clinicians and scientists can play in this process. A. Pediatric MRI in congenital and acquired cardiovascular disease C. Holmqvist; Lund/SE; presented by A.M. Taylor; London/UK Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the complementary non-invasive method of choice to echocardiography in evaluation of congenital heart disease (CHD), avoiding invasive catheterisation. The percentage of CHD patients that are operated without cine angiography has decreased during the last ten years, even prior to open-heart surgery. Many surgical corrections are carried out as early as possible during infancy. In the majority of infants, MRI can replace catheterisation in the pre-operative evaluation. MRI has been especially useful in the preoperative evaluation of malformations of the thoracic aorta and central pulmonary vessels, and in visualization of very complex intra-cardiac malformations. Contrast-enhanced MRA (ce-MRA) is now also widely in use. MRI/MRA should also be considered the choice examination in acquired conditions, such as cardiac/pericardial masses and in arterial or venous occlusion, thrombosis or stenosis as well as in extra-thoracic vascular investigations. MRI now also permit functional evaluation of the heart as well as flow information. The medical and surgical advances including, reduced postoperative mortality, has led to an increasing number of children requiring follow-up. Post-operative anatomic evaluation and physiologic information can be obtained by MRI. In this lecture, an overview of the most useful imaging techniques for paediatric cardiovascular MRI (white blood/black blood techniques, cine imaging, ce-MRA) is presented. The possibilities for functional information including quantitative flow measurement, even in smaller children, are exemplified. Learning Objectives: 1. To learn the basic examination techniques for paediatric cardiovascular MRI and MRA. 2. To comprehend the indications, applications and limitations for cardiovascular MRI in paediatric radiology. B.

Diagnosis and local staging of the primary tumor R.A. Frost; Salisbury/UKColorectal cancer (CRC) usually develops from adenomatous polyps. Its symptoms and signs overlap with benign disease, so a strategy must be used to investigate those most likely to have CRC. We use a scoring sheet for colorectal symptoms, a high score indicates a high probability of CRC. Patients with high probability are investigated by colonoscopy which has the highest sensitivity for the primary tumour, and provides histological proof. It is important that synchronous polyps are found and characterised, as the presence of adenomatous polyps elsewhere will influence how much colon is resected. Barium enema is used in patients with a lower probability of CRC. CT is utilised in several ways, ranging from unprepared abdominal CT, to full bowel preparation and the protocol of CT colonography (CTC), which has an accuracy for neoplasia approaching colonoscopy. A minority of patients with CRC present with large bowel obstruction in which unprepared CT can confirm the diagnosis, the cause and complications. We stage colon cancer with portal phase abdominal MSCT to look, not only for liver metastases, but for direct invasion into surrounding structures, to aid surgical planning. Rectal tumours, usually presenting at T2 or greater, must be staged accurately as treatment depends upon pre-operative T-stage. MRI can accurately demonstrate the relationship of the tumour to the mesorectal fascial margin (MFM). If clear, a total mesorectal excision (TME) is performed, if not clear, neo-adjuvant chemo-radiotherapy preceeds surgery. Trans-rectal ultrasound is required to identify the rarer T1 tumour which may be resected trans-anally (TEMS procedure). Learning Objectives:1. Pathways for CRC development and the impact of these on imaging methods. 2. Endosonography of rectal cancer -technique and interpretation. 3. MRI in rectal cancer -technique and interpretation.B. Distant metastases C. Bartolozzi; Pisa/ITCareful staging of the disease is a key aspect for establishing patient's prognosis and planning an appropriate treatment. Tumor staging is based on imaging examinations in combination with clinical and laboratory findings. Special attention has to be focused on detection of hepatic and pulmonary metastases. In fact, patients with limited liver or lung involvement can experience a substantial improvement in long term survival if the lesions are suitable for surgical resection or percutaneous ablation. A 5-year survival rate of approximately 20 -40% and a 5year disease-free survival rate of approximately 20 -25% can be expected in patients with liver metastases who successfully underwent resection as compared to 0% in the untreated patients. Knowledge of the exact number and location of hepatic metastatic lesions is therefore crucial for selecting the most appropriate treatment and planning the full extent of the intervention. While US is widely used as the first-line examination, spiral CT or MRI are needed for accurate pre-treatment assessment. MRI has an edge over CT, as tissue-specific MR contrast agents, including hepatobiliary agents and reticuloendothelial systemtargeted iron oxide particles, improve detection of tiny lesions. Spiral CT, however, is the modality of choice for evaluating extra-hepatic abdominal disease as well as pulmonary involvement. PET is also a promising technique for detecting distant metastases, but further investigation and standardized protocols of image acquisition and interpretation are necessary before this method can be widely used.Learning Objectives: 1. To describe staging protocols for patients with colorectal adenocarcinoma. 2. To discuss the clinical value of each imaging technique in the detection of distant metastases. 3. To report the results of comparative trials of spiral CT versus MRI with liver specific agents in the detection of hepatic metastases.C. Follow-up and recurrenceA. Guthrie; Leeds/UK 35% of patients with colorectal cancer (CRC) will develop recurrent disease. The aim of surveillance is to identify asymptomatic recurrences so as to initiate further treatment and improve survival, the assumption being that early detection of metastases or locally persistent tumour increases the likelihood of curative treatment.Theoretically a surveillance strategy could be devised on the basis of an understanding of the biology of the disease, the sensitivity of investigations employed and effectiveness of therapies available. Few randomised trials evaluating surveillance have been performed. Most of these show a trend towards increased survival in the intensively monitored groups, but are too small to have sufficient statistical power. Meta-analyses suggest intensive surveillance leads to an earlier detection of recurrence and a survival advantage.The principal questions regarding surveillance strategies remain open. The optimal method to maximise detection of curable recurrence has not been established. The costs are high and the benefits to the overall CRC population small, but a few individuals will be cured and others will have their lives extended. Learning Objectives:1. An understanding of the principles of surveillance.2. An appreciation of the evidence available that post-operative surveillance is effective for colorectal cancer. 3. An appreciation of the strengths and weaknesses of potential strategies.Thoracic manifestations of extra-thoracic diseaseModerator: F.J. Avelar Garnica; Mexico City/MX A-298 A.

To appreciate the potential importance of the multiplicity and size of pulmonary nodules in patients with known extrathoracic malignancy.The connective tissue diseases are a heterogeneous group of immunologically mediated disorders in which the lungs are an important taget organ due to its abundant connective tissue. The most common form of diffuse pulmonary lung disease in patients with collagen vascular disorders is a chronic pulmonary fibrosis indistinguishable from other causes of usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP).Complications of the connective tissue diseases include esophageal dysfunctionA B C D E F G leading to recurrent aspiration and secondary infection (in scleroderma and mixed connective tissue disease), respiratory muscle weakness contributing to atelectasis and secondary infection (in systemic lupus erythematosus, polymyositis) and drug-induced lung disease (methotrexate and gold treatment in rheumatoid arthritis). Because the pathology of chronic interstitial pneumonia takes a limited number of forms, there also are a limited number of radiographic manifestations. Currently, high resolution computed tomography (HRCT) is the imaging method of choice in evaluating patients with ILD. HRCT demonstrates the presence, gross characteristics and distribution of pulmonary disease with greater sensitivity than conventional chest radiographs and thereby may improve diagnosis. Additionally, HRCT can clarify confusing radiographic findings and direct invasive diagnostic procedures. In certain clinical circumstances HRCT findings can suggest a specific diagnosis or indicate a potentially treatable disease. The radiologic manifestations of those connective tissue diseases that affect the lungs will be discussed.Learning Objectives: 1. Summarize the HRCT features in collagen vascular diseases. 2.

The lung interstitium is affected by the development of oedema, deposition of fibrin, neutrophilic infiltrates and eventually areas of necrosis.The development of small vessel thrombosis, organising haemorrhage, the accumulation of free parenchymal haemosiderin and haemosiderin in the alveolar spaces may, after repeated episodes of diffuse alveolar haemorrhage, lead to functional and morphologic changes, the latter being recognised by HRCT. Multisystem vasculitides that involve the lung include Wegener's granulomatosis, Churg-Strauss syndrome, Takayasu's arteritis, Behcet's disease, microscopic polyangiitis, systemic autoimmune diseases and Goodpasture's syndrome.",

            "text": "Towards an MRI characterization of individual cancers for staging, treatment selection, and monitoring response R.C. Brasch; San Francisco, CA/US A major challenge for diagnostic imaging is to better define the specific characteristics of individual tumors.Tumors sharing a particular histopathologic type may have widely divergent biological properties including molecular expression, angiogenesis status, and susceptibility to treatment. Through the use of innovative contrast enhancing pharmaceuticals, it now seems feasible to interrogate each patient's tumor, defining both functional and structural characteristics. One of the several appealing approaches now being developed for clinical use, is the use of dynamic magnetic resonance imaging combined with novel macromolecular contrast media to quantitatively assess tumor microvessels. Using computer processing of the imaging data and a relatively simple two-compartment kinetic model, it is possible to non-invasively assay the relative blood volume, microvascular endothelial permeability, and the interstitial volume of any solid tumor. The MRI permeability assay appears to be a particularly powerful biomarker, able to indicate a tumor's malignancy, its pathologic grade, its angiogenic status, and the tumor's responsiveness to drug therapy. Using MRI and macromolecular contrast media, tumor responses to treatment can be detected within hours of initiating therapy. Optimization of the dynamic MRI technique linked with the anticipated availability of new macromolecular contrast media should lead to an even greater future benefit from diagnostic imaging in cancer patients. Learning Objectives: 1. To comprehend the diagnostic benefits afforded by MRI enhanced with novel macromolecular contrast agents for the characterization of individual tumors. 2. To understand the principles of altered microvascular permeability and how abnormal permeability relates to angiogeneisis and tumor aggressiveness. 3. To learn how the effects of anti-angiogenic therapy can be monitored by macromolecular enhanced MRI.",

Recently, it has been shown that integrated PET-CT is superior in diagnostic accuracy to CT alone and PET alone, and to visual correlation of PET and CT in T staging of patients with non-small-cell lung cancer. Without image fusion, the use of PET in T staging lung cancer is limited. Due to the exact anatomic correlation of the extent of FDG uptake, the delineation of the primary tumor can be defined precisely. Integrated PET-CT imaging is very useful for the differentiation between tumor and peritumoral atelectasis. This is particularly important for the planning of radiotherapy in patients with lung cancer associated with an atelectasis. Integrated PET-CT imaging improves the exact localization of lymph node metastases, particularly in patients with a mediastinal shift due to an atelectasis or anatomical variants. In 10-20% of patients, PET scanning detects unknown distant metastases. However, the exact localization remains unclear, especially when no morphological alterations occur on CT images. The advantage of integrated PET-CT imaging is the exact localization of a focal abnormality on PET. Recently, it has been shown that integrated PET-CT imaging is a highly valuable tool in the management of patients with SCLC, particularly for planning radiation treatment. Integrated PET-CT imaging is also an excellent method for staging patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma. With the co-registration of anatomic and metabolic information, the extent of the tumor can be more precisely defined. Learning Objectives:1. Describe the role of FDG imaging for patients with lung cancer. 2. Recognize the diagnostic advantages and limitations of fused images. 3 . Learn how to interpret PET and integrated PET-CT images. 4.

PET/CT permits faster imaging times. It improves lesion detectability and lesion localisation. PET/CT is a whole body imaging technique for tumour staging and re-staging. PET/CT will be progressively inserted into tumour response assessment. In abdominal cancer, much data has now accumulated in the investigation of two aspects of tumour cellular metabolism: glucose activity with labelled FDG (fluorodeoxyglucose) and cellular proliferation with labelled FLT (fluorodeoxythymidine).In this presentation, the present role and clinical value of PET/CT will be discussed. Most current clinical work is confined to FDG but there is real progress with other F-18 labelled molecules. The solution of the distribution problem of FDG, which has limited the wide applicability of clinical PET, is also the solution for the distribution of any F-18 labelled ligand. There is much hope and indeed expectation of what has been described as the most exciting imaging opportunity in molecular and nuclear medicine. In oesophageal, gastric, colorectal and pelvic neoplasias, PET/CT has now gained acceptance as a major imaging modality. In many patients first presenting with these cancers, PET/CT could indeed be the first imaging investigation of choice. In modern assessment of tumour development, it will be difficult to ignore the real merits which this new approach brings to drug efficacy studies and patient response. ",

            "text": "Lymphoma C. Messa, S. Sironi, C. Landoni, L. Gianolli, F. Fazio; Milan/IT PET has been widely used in patients with Hodgkin disease and high-grade non Hodgkin's lymphoma, providing useful information and improving the management of these patients. The areas where PET seems to be particularly useful are in improving the accuracy of initial staging, in defining response to treatment and in refining follow-up after completion of treatment. With the introduction of PET/ CT scanners, another interesting area of application is the definition of radiotherapy planning volumes. All these indications are based on the very early metabolic alteration detectable by PET, so that disease and response to treatment can be assessed in early phase. A major potential role of PET in lymphoma is in tailoring treatment according to response both at presentation and during first-line treatment. Final goal would be to improve management of patients by identifying those who can be cured with minimal treatment and those in whom more intensive therapies are needed. The advantages of PET/CT over PET are similar to those of other tumors and are based on faster and more accurate interpretation of PET images based on the anatomical CT information. By adding CT information to PET, residual masses in regions such as the latero-cervical and abdominal areas are better delineated. Also, anatomical landmark essential for radiotherapy planning, are provided. Technique: CAS is performed with shuttle sheath, pre-dilatation or only in-stent dilatation, self-expandable stent, and cerebral protection with filters or balloons. ASA and clopidogrel are applied before, during, and after the intervention. DW MI-imaging is helpful to detect clinically silent microembolism. Results: CAS is used in symptomatic patients with a > 70% stenosis, asymptomatic patients with a > 80% stenosis. It is the preferred method after CEA, neck irradiation, radical neck dissection, tracheostoma, recurrent nerve palsy, Bechterew's disease, and extreme obesity. In a series of more than 2,200 CAS from 8/ 1984 to 7/2003 a success rate of 99% was achieved accompanied by a complication rate of stroke and death of 3.6%. From 1999 to 2003 the technical success rate remained unchanged in 826 treatments with cerebral protection, but the complication rate (1.6%) could be reduced. A death rate of 0.26%, a rate of major stroke of 0.52% and of minor stroke of 0.78% prove the efficacy of cerebral protection. The 5-year patency is 90%. Cerebral protection reduced the rate of signal-intensive spots in DW-weighted MR-imaging significantly. In all high-risk trials CAS was superior to CEA. A-271 C. Subintimal PTA J.A. Reekers; Amsterdam/NL Subintimal angioplasty, also named percutaneous intentional extraluminal recanalization (PIER), is a technique for revascularization of long superficial femoral artery and crural artery lesions. It has proven to be of value in patients with chronic critical ischeamia and/or arterial ulcers. Especially in patients which are poor surgical candidates, this technique can be of value, as the clinical result, ulcer healing and limb salvage, seems to be much higher than the true hemodynamic patency.In this workshop the technique will be demonstrated. Also the etiology of lower limb ulceration, patient selection, outcomes and the current literature will be discussed. Mistakes in interpreting computed tomographic images in children are mainly related either to artifacts induced by the scanning technique or to misinterpretation of a normal anatomical variant as pathological. The aim of this lecture is to discuss both the normal variants found in pediatric radiology practice, the common diagnostic pitfalls they create, and the sources of common artifacts associated with cross-sectional imaging. The lecture will cover thoracic and abdominal/ pelvic imaging and will attempt to provide a series of helpful guidelines which will allow the differentiation of normal variants and artifacts from important pathologic entities. Likely future developments in multi-slice imaging will be discussed, including how these may help to reduce current artifactual appearances in the CT images. However, these new techniques may simply replace current artifacts with a new generation of artifactual problems. Learning Objectives:1. To understand the mistakes commonly made in pediatric CT thoracic/abdominal/pelvic practice which are related to image artifacts and how these may be minimized. 2. To discuss the range of normal anatomic variants which are important and which give rise to misinterpretation of CT thoracic/abdominal/pelvic images. 3. To discuss how future improvements in CT imaging may circumvent the above problems but may also induce a new range of image artifacts.",

The presentation will focus on practical considerations to optimize the protocol for a specific age group, anatomical location and indication in order to avoid common mistakes and mismanagement. Recognition of the maturational pattern of enhancement for a given state of development is mandatory in order to rule out pathologic processes such as ischemia, necrosis, edema, revascularization and neovascularization.

Kubik-Huch; Baden/CH Carcinoma of the ovary is the third commonest tumor of the female genital tract after carcinoma of the cervix and endometrium. However, as it is usually discovered at an advanced stage, its prognosis is usually poor. Management of clinically suspected disease involves a staging laparotomy with histological confirmation of the diagnosis, identification of tumor spread and debulking prior to chemotherapy, itself usually followed by second-look laparotomy to assess the response. Prior to surgery, cross sectional imaging nowadays plays an increasing role to determine the origin of a pelvic mass (uterine vs. adnexal), to characterize the lesion (benign vs. malignant) as well as for tumor staging in case of malignancy. In patients with suspected ovarian carcinoma, CT is the modality of choice alongside transvaginal and abdominal ultrasound as it is relatively cost-effective and widely available. While MRI plays a limited role in the staging of ovarian carcinoma, it serves as an important adjunct for the characterization of sonographically indeterminate ovarian lesions since it is capable of reliably differentiating mature cystic teratoma and other benign lesions from ovarian carcinoma. Pelvic MRI is now a recognized imaging modality in the field of pelvic floor dysfunction. It allows excellent anatomical depiction of cavities and of the surrounding organs, muscles and fat. Dynamic imaging allows sequential imaging during contraction, straining and defecation.Technically examinations are performed with the patient lying supine after rectal opacification. Sequences include static T2-weighted sequences in 3 planes, allowing anatomical analysis of the pelvis compartments; and dynamic gradient echo or fast spin-echo sequences, at rest, in contraction and straining. Clinical examination can be performed at the magnet. During straining in the normal examination, the bladder neck, lower portion of the bladder and uterine cervix remain above the infrapubic-coccygeal line. Urethra and bladder shift dorsally and caudally; the rectum shifts caudally and dorsally. Angulation of the levator ani muscles is modified with a widening and lengthening of the urogenital hiatus. MRI allows assessment of pelvic muscles defects and of pelvic organ motion. It allows a classification of prolapses with regard to each pelvic compartment (cystocele, hysterocele, peritoneocele, rectocele and pelvic floor descent). Clinical examination performed at the magnet may unmask hidden prolapses, otherwise undetected. Conclusion: Dynamic MRI of the pelvic floor allows a physiopathologic approach of pelvic organs at rest and in motion. It is nowadays a useful tool in the pre-and post-operative assessment of pelvic prolapse and of its complications. ",

The exact cause of this phenomenon is probably multifactorial and it could be due to embolization of uterine-ovarian collaterals during the procedure and considering this we should use particles bigger than 500 \u00b5m, that can not pass through the anastomoses. The failure rates reported in the literature, after UFE is between 4% and 14%. Learning Objectives: 1. To discuss the most important complications that we can find with uterine artery embolization and their management. 2. To see the failures rates of this procedure.A-308 B. Embolisation for post partum haemorrhage is safe and effective. So why isn't it used more? J.-P. Pelage; Boulogne/FR Post partum hemorrhage remains a leading cause of maternal mortality throughout the world. Uterine atony, genital tract lacerations and abnormal placentation account for the majority of cases. Atonic uterus is usually controlled using oxytocin and prostaglandin analogues. Surgical repair is effective to treat cervical tears and curettage may be sufficient to remove retained placental tissue. For patients whose clinical condition continues to deteriorate, arterial ligation or hysterectomy is often the favored treatment. However, these procedures are associated with significant failure and morbidity rates particularly in patients with coagulation disorders. The successful use of embolisation was first reported in 1979 in a patient who underwent hypogastric artery ligation and hysterectomy. Since then many reports have emphasized the advantages of embolisation over surgery. The main supply to the uterus is provided by the uterine arteries originating from the hypogastric (internal iliac) arteries. The ovarian or round ligament arteries may account for recurrence of bleeding. Selective embolisation of both uterine arteries should be performed but in case of severe vasocontriction, embolisation of the anterior division of the hypogastric arteries is safe and effective. Gelatin sponge pledgets, which provide a temporary occlusion are particularly suitable. The success rates of embolisation range between 80 and 95% to treat bleeding following cesarean section and uterine atony respectively. Pluridisciplinary management for these patients should be realized in highly specialized centers open 24 hours a day only. If applied early in the course of events, embolisation is a valuable alternative to surgery in the management of intractable postpartum hemorrhage. Uterine artery embolisation has become an increasingly used interventional radiological technique to treat symptomatic uterine fibroids. An increasing literature on the subject documents the chances of success and the associated morbidity and mortality. The literature focuses on symptomatic and radiological outcomes and most authors quote figures approaching 90% for relief of mennorrhagia, dysmennorrhoea and pressure related symptoms. In addition most authors quote figures of urgent or emergent hystectomy (hysterectomy) following the procedure between 1-2% and premature menopause between 1-2%. Most authors also discuss other side-effects including chronic discharge but there is little mention in the literaure of the impact of the procedure on sexual function. This paper will focus on this topic with the following learning objectives. Learning Objectives: 1. Short overview of the female anatomy with reference to nerve and blood supply. 2. Potential complications post UAE with respect to premature menopause. 3. Results of a postal survery (n = 120 patients post UAE greater than 6 months following the procedure) looking at sexual function and satisfaction pre and post procedure. 4. Literature review with available evidence with respect to published data on pregnancy and outcome post UAE. By the end of this presentation the audience will be better equipped to answer patients questions and concerns about sexual function post UAE. Peripheral arterial disease usually presents to a primary care physician due to reduced blood flow to the lower limbs. This produces the well-recognised clinical symptoms of intermittent claudication or critical limb ischaemia. Once the physician has identified PVD as a likely cause for the patients symptoms, then the important issues to be addressed are to confirm that PVD exists and to assess the location and severity of that disease. MR angiography, CT angiography and new directions in sonography are addressed in other sessions. There are however, a number of simple, non-invasive techniques, which can be utilised, in the office or vascular laboratory setting, to answer many of the clinical questions. These include a focused clinical examination, pedal Doppler signals, ankle: brachial indices, and toe pressures. All of these can be performed in the outpatient environment and ensure that further evaluation is effective and patient orientated. In appropriate circumstances further noninvasive investigation may be performed in the vascular laboratory including exercising testing and duplex ultrasound. The appropriate equipment required for, and its optimal use depend on a sound understanding of the role and limitations of each technique. If used appropriately, judicious use of scarce resources of more complex investigations can be achieved, and patients given a reasonably accurate indication of their disease and its likely prognosis. In view of the significant legal and social implications of diagnosing non-accidental injury (NAI) in a child it is important that radiologists are aware of the potential diagnostic problems that can occur. This lecture will highlight the need for appropriate radiographs of the skeleton which must be reported in the correct clinical context. The importance of a full clinical history when dealing with potential nonaccidental injuries will be discussed. The role of the radiologist working as part of a multi-disciplinary team will be emphasised. The factors that differentiate accidental from non-accidental injury will be discussed along with the normal variants that may be confused with NAI. The radiological features of other diseases that can cause some confusion with NAI will be shown, including rickets, scurvy, Caffey's disease, infection as well as malignancy. The ability to remember and recognise more unusual fractures and skeletal injuries that occur in child abuse will be discussed. This lecture will give an overview of the radiological features of both the normal and pathological conditions that cause confusion when the diagnosis of non-accidental injury is considered. Childhood and adolescence are the ages of predilection for both primary bone tumours and osteomyelitis. Clearly, it is important not to underdiagnose a malignant bone tumour as an infection or, vice versa, overdiagnose osteomyelitis as a tumour. Incorrect diagnosis can lead to inappropriate management and a potentially disastrous outcome for the patient. Unfortunately, the clinical presentation for the two conditions can be remarkably similar. There is, therefore, a heavy reliance on imaging to help distinguish between these two entities. The purpose of this presentation is to highlight those imaging features, with particular emphasis on radiography and MR imaging, that help establish the correct diagnosis. These include the rapidity of onset of bone changes, growth plate involvement, pattern of periosteal new bone formation, cortical breaching, distribution of soft tissue extension, proportion of marrow oedema and the \"penumbra sign\" in a bone abscess. Where diagnostic doubt remains then an old adage applies recommending biopsy of suspected infection and culture of suspected tumour. Any biopsy/drainage should be positioned in such a manner as not to prejudice future surgery in case tumour is subsequently proven. Learning Objectives:1. To recognise differences in the rapidity of onset of bone changes between tumour and infection. 2. To identify differences in growth plate involvement between tumour and infection. 3. To identify differences in signal characteristics and perilesional oedema between tumour and infection. 4. To identify differences in cortical destruction and soft tissue extension between tumour and infection. In many CT investigations, MPR is becoming an imaging routine. Evidently, MPR has improved with the introduction of multi-slice CT (MSCT) and the associated computer technology. However, the effectiveness of the method is highly radiographer-dependant. Consequently the radiographer ought to be aware of the principles and the factors influencing MPR. It is essential that the appropriate acquisition technique be selected with emphasis given to image quality and dose consideration preceding the commencement of the examination. On occasion MPR is carried out arbitrarily. It is not always clearly indicated and thus, its clinical applications are somewhat limited. The learning outcome of this course will be to familiarize the radiographer with dedicated acquisition methods required for MPR with concern to CT dose index (CTDI). This will be accomplished by comparing helical CT scanning techniques used to produce MPR images of analogous regions. In addition, the clinical applications described in this presentation will mainly involve orthopaedic and surgical cases due to their increased accessibility. Furthermore to comprehend the benefits of MPR the following issues will be addressed: How accurate and reliable is MPR? Does MPR reduce dose without compromising image quality? How do slice thickness and table increment affect MPR? When is MPR indicated?In conclusion, the general purpose of this lecture will be to provoke radiographers in performing such reconstruction techniques effectively. The analysis of medical images plays an increasingly important role in many clinical applications. Different imaging modalities provide anatomical information about the underlying tissues such as the X-ray attenuation coefficient from X-ray computed tomography (CT) and proton density or proton relaxation times from magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. The images allow clinicians to gather information about the size, shape and spatial relationship between anatomical structures and any pathology, if present. Other imaging modalities provide functional information such as the blood flow or glucose metabolism from positron emission tomography (PET) or single-photon emission tomography (SPECT), and permit clinicians to study the relationship between anatomy and physiology. Finally, histological images provide another important source of information which depicts structures at a microscopic level of resolution. In recent years, there has been a rapidly growing demand for the automated combination of these different sources of information. The fusion of these images is important in a number of applications such as diagnosis, therapy and monitoring of disease. However, this integration requires a registration step which maps the images in a common space. Recent breakthroughs have led to the development of very robust and accurate registration algorithms. The purpose of this talk is to give a comprehensive overview of existing techniques for medical image registration. We will also give a step-by-step description of the design of registration algorithms and their basic components for specific applications. ",

            "text": "Over the last decade, image registration has emerged as an extremely successful and powerful tool in medical imaging finding a wide range of medical applications. This talk will explore how the development of this technology impacted on these applications. In the early 1990's most applications were being built around multi-modal imaging in which complimentary information was combined to provide synergy between two (or more) imaging modalities. Examples include the combination of structural information from MR with the functional information available at lower spatial resolution from PET or SPECT. As the technology became more advanced, very accurate alignment of intra-modality data became feasible. This allowed subtle temporal changes in structure or function to be analysed. Over short time intervals image registration, for example, improves image alignment in functional MR studies and over long time intervals allows highly accurate detection of cerebral atrophy. Image registration, in this case to the physical space of the patient in the operating room, is the key enabling technology in image-guided surgery. All these applications were built on rigid body registration technologies. Non-rigid registration, in which one image is warped or morphed into the space of another, has more recently found wide ranging applications, from the measurement (as opposed to detection) of change, to the generation of atlases and the propagation of segmentation in the automated interpretation of images. The application and interpretation of non-rigid registration raises important issues related to definitions of spatial correspondence and homology, but, with this proviso, provides an extremely powerful tool for image analysis. Applications include accurate measurement of tissue growth and destruction in the monitoring of therapy and the progression of disease. This achieved by analysis of the deformation fields produced by the non-rigid registration. Atlases can be built from large numbers of example images that have been aligned and the statistics of the resulting deformation models can be used to build statistical shape models. These models can then be used to propagate organ outlines to improve measurements of size and shape. Learning Objectives: 1. To learn how to carry out very precise measurements of change, growth, atrophy. 2. To understand how to apply image registration in motion analysis. 3.

            "text": "A. Todd-Pokropek; London/UK Image registration techniques require validation, which implies the availability of a gold standard. For rigid registration this then permits the definition of a target registration error, and a number of successful evaluations of rigid registration techniques have been completed. Non-rigid registration includes a model of interpolation and cannot be evaluated in such a simple manner. We are interested in the accuracy of registration at all points in image space, but \"weighed\" by the clinical objective to be achieved. Non-rigid registration must also include a model of the process of deformation (for example amodel of tissue characteristics) and can be divided into spatial deformation and material transport. It is then possible to define the registration in terms of the deformation vector field and transport field, where some methods exist for their assessment. In general, a suitable strategy for validation of such methods starts by using real clinical data and deforming it, for example using a finite element (tissue based) method. The accuracy of restoring the data back to its undeformed state provides a baseline for evaluation, although the use of circular methods (where the forward and reverse operations match) must be avoided. Finally clinical trials are required to confirm this validation on real clinical data for real applications. Learning Objectives:1. To enable the understanding of the processes of rigid and non-rigid registration, of constraints such as diffeomorphism and consistency, and the choice of various particularities of different methods as appropriate for different clinical applications. 2. To understand the process of validation of rigid registration and strategies for use for non-rigid registration. 3. To become familiar with the use of and the limitations of such techniques.",

            "text": "The Globe The concept of molecular imaging has gained increasing interest and tremendous developments over the last few years. A simple definition is not yet established, but molecular imaging covers \"imaging of physiological or pathological processes at a cellular or subcellular level\". It covers imaging of gene expression, enzyme activity, cell receptor imaging, cell trafficking, but also the consequences of these cellular events at the organ level, like angiogenesis and early cancer detection. Current applications of molecular imaging are being developed in the small animal because of the numerous disease models available in mice, and the technical developments of machines dedicated for small animal (micro PET, micro CT, micro MRI, optical imaging devices). Hence, compared to traditional specialties in radiology, molecular imaging covers a wide area of techniques, specific probes and applications. This large concept has lead to confusion and difficulties to understand the exact place and potential overlap of molecular imaging with nuclear medicine or traditional imaging techniques based mainly on anatomical or functional findings. The aim of this state of the art symposium is to be an update for general radiologists who want to know what is beyond the phrase \"molecular imaging\" and to have a clear view of the current diagnostic tools availables in animals and potential or current clinical applications in the future. Learning Objectives: 1. To understand the scope of molecular imaging. 2. To understand that molecular imaging covers several imaging techniques with corresponding contrast agents or probes. 3. To understand the in vivo applications of molecular imaging in small animals using dedicated machines. 4. To understand the potential clinical applications in humans of receptor imaging with PET, cellular imaging with MRI, and gene or enzyme expression with optical imaging.",

Reimer; Karlsruhe/DE Our current assessment of disease is largely based on anatomic changes, or more recently in specialized applications, physiologic changes that are late manifestations of the molecular changes that truly underlie disease. Much research attention has been directed towards understanding the cellular and molecular mechanisms of diseases. Although there still remains a gap between basic science and clinical imaging applications, this gap is closing. The transition of these novel methods into clinical practice is on the horizon and to expected to have direct impact on patient care within 5-15 years. In radiology we are often not aware of the fact that certain imaging techniques that may be defined as \"molecular\" were developed decades ago, such as receptor imaging with nuclear techniques. Furthermore, already approved X-ray or MR contrast agents allow for an assessment of angiogenesis or exhibit cell specific uptake via surface receptors. Sophisticated computer analysis or the development of cell specific contrast agents, which took place especially with the development for MRI within pharmaceutical programs, stimulated some of these already existing tools. On the research side, an entire industry has developed that is aimed at speeding up molecular research and drug discovery. Radiology has focused on biomedical engineering and computing. Today's imaging systems are markedly improved in terms of resolution and speed as compared with those of only a few years ago. Imaging technology is at a stage where imaging can occur at near micrometer resolution, and concomitant acquisition of functional and physiologic information is possible.Learning Objectives: 1. To describe the way from anatomic imaging to physiologic imaging at a cellular level. 2. To learn about existing clinical applications that may be defined as \"molecular\". 3.

Jackson; Manchester/UK Recognition of the importance of the angiogenic process in a wide range of diseases, most especially cancer, has led to the development of novel imaging techniques to study the angiogenic process. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is widely available in most clinical centres and, since it is free from ionizing radiation, it can be used repeatedly for sequential monitoring of disease progress or therapeutic response. The major challenges facing investigators have related to the development of reproducible quantitative imaging techniques for use in clinical trials. The most widely used approach uses dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI where the progression of signal changes following an injection of contrast agent are used to derive information about the microvasculature. Application of analysis techniques which use pharmacokinetic models of contrast agent distribution allow calculation of a wide range of quantified descriptive parameters which reflect local vascular density, the size of the interstitial space, the speed of passage of blood through the tissue, the absolute blood flow, the capillary endothelial permeability and the physiological reactivity of the neoangiogenic vessels. This talk will describe the common approaches to quantitative imaging of angiogenic tissue and illustrate the application of these techniques in clinical trials. ",

Imaging of normal endogenous cells is interesting for the understanding of immune response in ischemic, inflammatory or tumorous processes. Imaging of abnormal endogenous cells corresponds, for example, to early cancer detection. Finally, imaging the fate and homing of exogenous injected cells could be of great help in the development of human cell therapy of numerous diseases. Different techniques can be applied for cellular imaging in vivo: fluorescence or bioluminescence, but with a low in depth-detection for human applications; radioisotope labeling, but with a poor spatial resolution; MRI with superparamagnetic probes. The aim of this presentation is to review the different techniques, with an emphasis on MRI which allies a high spatial resolution and a good sensitivity to contrast agents at high fields. The different superparamagnetic markers available for cell labeling will be detailed: commercial particles with or without the use of a transfection agent (Endorem\u00ae, Sinerem\u00ae, Resovist\u00ae); facilitated endocytosis with a receptor or translocation peptide (CLIO-TAT); anionic particles for non-specific cell labelling. The influence of cell division, site of injection, magnetic field strength and iron load will be discussed for the efficacy of the method. Several diagnostic applications will be illustrated in the following areas: macrophage imaging; imaging of stroke; imaging of diabetes; imaging of the antitumor response; imaging of cellular therapy of myocardial infarction. Learning Objectives: 1. To understand the scope of cellular imaging. 2. To understand the different imaging techniques available for cellular imaging in vivo. 3. To know the different magnetic particles and techniques used for cell labelling. 4. To understand the potential clinical diagnostic applications of cellular imaging in the inflammatory response and for cell therapy. 5.

Historically, the visual inspection of a patient or the observation of tissues using optical microscopes has been widely used to assess structure and function. Those two examples use the human retina as the recording medium. Generally, medical optical imaging is a large set of imaging technologies that use light from the ultraviolet (UV) to the infrared (IR) region to image tissue optical characteristics. Light-tissue interactions offer wavelength dependent contrast with rich diagnostic potential. This presentation reviews the capacity of optical imaging to resolve functional and molecular characteristics of tissue. We focus on recent developments in optical imaging that allow imaging of superficial and deeper tissues yielding quantified information. These technological advances allow the non-invasive, in-vivo quantification of oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin and of appropriate contrast agents that can target physiological and molecular function. Application in imaging breast cancer, motor cortex activation and the exercising muscle are presented. The capacity to quantitatively resolve fluorescent probes with high molecular specificity and several centimeters deep in tissues is showcased. Current progress with tomographic imaging of enzyme up-regulation, induced apoptosis and gene-expression in intact animals is presented. Limitations of the technology are also discussed. We conclude on the future clinical applicability of optical imaging methods. Learning Objectives:1. This lecture is to serve as an introduction to optical imaging and the potential for clinical use. First, it will review the basic physics of light propagation into tissue and describe fundamental contrast mechanisms of light tissue interactions. 2. Examples from everyday experience will be given. Then, reflectance imaging, trans-illumination imaging and optical tomography will be reviewed. Advantages, limitations and the usability of these technologies will be discussed. 3. Imaging of intrinsic contrast and of extrinsically administered contrast will be showcased. Special focus will be given to fluorescence imaging and tomography as it pertains to imaging molecular function using targeted fluorochromes. Finally possible clinical applications will be briefly reviewed. The most common cause for a neonatal abdominal mass is hydronephrosis. Overall, an underlying ureteropelvic junction (UPJ) obstruction, posterior urethral valve, and ectopic ureterocele are responsible about 20% of the time. Prune-belly (Eagle-Barrett) syndrome and ureterovesical junction (UVJ) obstruction account for another 20%. However, hydronephrosis is not only caused by obstruction. Vesico ureteral reflux (VUR) accounts for another 20%, and polyuria and urinary sepsis may also cause dilatation of the urinary tract. In the neonatal age group, hydronephrosis is often diagnosed prenatally. If the degree of ureteropelvic dilatation is moderate to severe, it may persist after birth and necessitate further evaluation (by VCUG) in about 50% of neonates. In mild cases, prenatal hydronephrosis disappears, probably related to the child's emergence from the special environment of the uterus (perhaps from gravity or improved GFR). Evaluation and follow-up by US are usually sufficient for a month or two; after such time, a VCUG may be needed to exclude VUR as the underlying cause. The characterisation of prenatal hydronephrosis is difficult and not very reliable. Progressive hydronephrosis is usually caused by an obstruction, varying hydronephrosis may be due to VUR. Imaging strategies current in 2004 will be highlighted for each of the above. Learning Objectives:1. To comprehend the indications for pre and postnatal imaging of the urinary tract. 2. To understand the role of imaging in the management of the dilated upper urinary tract in infants and newborns. 3. To be able to assist the clinician in effectively and practically developing therapeutic intervention if needed.A-332 C. Imaging in delayed menarche M. Riccabona; Graz/AT Objective: To describe the most common conditions associated with delayed menarche and pubarche with its imaging implications. Method: Besides a list of the various diseases and reasons for a delayed menarche the applicable imaging modalities are presented and discussed. Conventional plain films are used for assessment of bone age and skeletal growth retardation. Ultrasound (US) at present is the first line abdominal study tool, whereas MRI is used for neuro-imaging (in case of suspected hormonal disturbances related to cerebral tumours etc.) and promoted for the imaging of complex abdominal disease (e.g. hormonal active tumours of the various glands, significant or complex malformations of the inner genitalia etc). Due to the relatively high radiation burden CT indications have decreased, and fluoroscopy is restricted to the rare case of complex genital malformation that need genitography -however, these conditions are usually diagnosed earlier in infancy.Conclusion: Imaging plays a relatively minor role in evaluating patients with delayed menarche; many conditions are properly recognised and diagnosed or ruled out clinically or with various laboratory, hormonal, or genetic studies. However, if either hormonal gland pathology (such as tumours or hyerplasia) with secondary hormonal dysfunction or significant genital malformation are on the list, imaging -mainly consisting of US and MRI -is indicated and should be performed appropriately and skilfully. Learning Objectives: 1. To familiarise the pediatric radiologist with this new field when dealing with adolescent patients, who at least in some countries are more and more directed to paediatric hospitals. 2. To know the most important conditions associated with delayed menarche. 3. To list the potential imaging tools, including modern imaging techniques such as MRI and 3D US. 4. To demonstrate the most important imaging findings in patients with delayed menarche. 5. To suggest an imaging algorithm for evaluating boys and girls. 6. To discuss the restrictions, pitfalls and differential diagnoses that impact imaging findings and algorithms. Post-processing of digital images is the first step following image acquisition. It can start with 2D multiplanar reformations along three orthogonal axes and on oblique planes, followed by generation of 3D images, using both surface and volume rendering algorithms. With surface rendering, following the choice of an adequate threshold value, all the pixels other than this value are automatically removed. Contiguous pixels at the boundary of a predefined threshold value are modeled as surfaces. Computer-produced imaginary sources of illumination depict surface reflections that are encoded in the image gray scale.With volume rendering, more flexible management of 3D datasets is possible, with generation of surface views (similar to surface rendering), 3D models, and tissue transition projection images, which resemble a \"double contrast\" conventional X-ray study. The major advantage of volume rendering is that the entire dataset is preserved, with either no or very limited data segmentation, and tissue reconstruction is obtained using different opacity levels.Using both surface and volume rendering algorithms, virtual endoscopic images resembling conventional endoscopic views can be generated. Color is assigned to simulate expected normal tissue color in vivo. In addition, \"fly through\" sequences within the lumen can be produced by automatically creating a \"flight path\"; automatic centering as well as auto-navigation systems help virtual endoscopist in image analysis. More recently, image data can be displayed using newly generated 3D views (i.e., \"mercator projection\") or different rendering algorithm (i.e., \"virtual dissection\"). Computer-aided detection (CAD) has been for used now for many years in the evaluation of mammography with very good results and time saving especially in screening tests. The recent development and improvement of other diagnostic modalities have significantly improved image quality expanding non invasive diagnostic imaging to other body fields. In particular computed tomography is the modality that has undergone the greatest developments in the past five years, with the introduction of the multi-detector row technology. Several other problems have nevertheless to be faced that particularly concern the large number of images to be evaluated and the very small details to be identified. The recent CT developments have also introduced its applicability as screening modality also in other fields, such as the chest (lung cancer) and the colon (colo-rectal carcinoma). New systems for computer aided detection of focal and diffuse disease have therefore been developed or are under investigation with the purpose to provide an aid to radiologists that now have to face a greater amount of data and information. CAD systems now allow not only identification of nodulary lesions but also their 3D display, differentiation and relationships with normal structures. The typical examples are nodules in the lung with a greater number of screening projects in at risk population and polypoid lesions in the colon. Ultrasound is the longest established of the cross sectional imaging techniques and remains the most frequently requested. In honour of Anne whose professional base was Glasgow, the development of ultrasound in the UK will be traced from its clinical beginnings in gynaecology and obstetrics. The use of bi-stable static systems and then, the early grey scale and real time machines will be described and illustrated. To put this in context the current status in a number of clinical areas will be highlighted briefly including in paediatrics, breast assessment, in evaluation of the abdomen and in the expanding range of musculo-skeletal and superficial applications. The dynamic interactive nature of ultrasound will be emphasised combined with the central role micro bubble contrast agents now have in evaluation of the liver, after a long development and evaluation period.The final issue to be addressed will be the differing ways in which ultrasound is used in practice. It may be a standardised examination by a sonographer or as a focused clinical examination by a specialist, or as a screening examination prior to CT/MR. The equipment available will significantly impact on this -portable or high end. Ultrasound has the best inherent resolution of all the imaging modalities and so full advantage should be taken to optimise this asset. In the past few years there has been a rapid improvement in computer technology. Also high power computers have become generally available. Subsequently, the way of presenting scientific data has changed dramatically.In the past 5 years scientific slide presentations have been replaced completely by digital PowerPoint presentations, and instead of \"conventional\" scientific posters electronic exhibits will be used. Presenting data electronically puts an extra demand on the authors. They have to adapt to these new techniques, and must find a way in using them efficiently.In this course guidelines will be presented on how to make an electronic exhibit, how to make, and how to present a professional digital presentation.",

Guth 2 ; 1 Strasbourg/FR, 2 Illkirch/FR Purpose: To deliver the knowledge for realization of an electronic poster in html. Abstract: After a short introduction about the html language standards, objects and image format, we will deliver the knowledge needed to write an electronic poster with EPOS focusing on image and movie management. EPOS is a PHP based application server. It is a good solution for publishing on the Internet, as physicians who are not used to publishing web content are able to produce high quality web pages with it quickly, efficiently and without long learning process. Epos is a so called \"W.Y.S.W.Y.G.\" html editor: W.Y.S.W.Y.G. means What You See is What You Get, it is the easiest and fastest way to edit html pages without having to know the html code language. We will explain how to write an electronic presentation with this tool, taking as example our ECR 2004 electronic posters. Conclusion: It can be very easy to realize a simple electronic presentation in html with EPOS; advanced design, database connectivity and some web-contents need more advanced techniques. Going from slides to a digital power point presentation is a dramatic change. Instead of double projection there is single projection, all kind of animation effects both for text and figures can be applied, subsequent images can merge into each other, movies and sound can be integrated, and changing from slide to slide also can be done with some kind of effect. In addition, preparing a digital presentation paper allows the author to do last minute changes.This part of the course will focus on how one can make a professional digital PowerPoint presentation. First, it will be explain how one can use the most important features of the Pow-erPoint program. Second, pitfalls like too many disturbing effects, the wrong type and colour of fonts, the wrong format of images, or wrong handling of movies will be illustrated. Also hardware, like the laptop/PC remote control mouse and the integrated use of other programs -like MPR/MIP -will be discussed. Finally, some important practical tips will be given, which can be used directly before or during the presentation. A-344 C. Scientific papers: How to get your message over and not be a bore! R. Godwin; Bury St. Edmunds/UKThe differential diagnosis of the acute abdomen in childhood varies with the age of the child. The clinical team will be able to make a confident diagnosis on the basis of age, presenting history and clinical examination without the need for radiological investigation in many cases. In other situations further imaging may be helpful in determining whether surgical intervention is necessary. With increasing use of CT scanning in the evaluation of the acute abdomen in adults, there is an increasing tendency to dismiss the unique value of ultrasound scanning (US) in children and perform a CT scan. In many cases, CT is unnecessary. Young children often have little body fat making interpretation of bowel pathology on CT more difficult than in adults. By paying meticulous attention to ultrasound technique combined with appropriate clinical knowledge, US can often answer the clinical question without the need to expose the child to relatively high doses of ionising radiation or the discomfort and potential risks associated with the administration of contrast media. This paper will review the common causes of the acute abdomen concentrating on the imaging in the toddler and older child presenting with a possible diagnosis of acute appendicitis. The US features in appendicitis and a number of other less frequently encountered conditions will be highlighted. Some of the pitfalls and limitations of US in the diagnosis of the acute abdomen will be discussed, and attention drawn to situations where CT scanning may be found to be helpful or even essential. The tumorsize is recorded as one of multiple prognostic data of breast carcinoma. Gold standard is the measurement on the excised specimen and that obtained on histological preparation. The invasive part, accompanying intraductal components, multifocal sattelites und multizentric growth have to be documented if present. The nearest distance of tumorous spread towards the excision margin may be important in determining the risk of recurrance. Preoperative imaging is therefore essential for the surgeon's choice on an optimal pathway of excision. In this field mammography, ultrasound and magnetic resonance have specific strengths and limitations in cancer visualization. Since the methods provide complementary tissue information, a multimodal approach will give best results, even though in many cases one method alone presents already all diagnostic information which will not be gained by the others. Parameters affecting the diagnostic value are: tumor size, histomorphological entity, macroscopic growth pattern, vascularity, presence of microcalcifications and tissue composition of the surrounding tissue. Major imaging differences become apparent in the evaluation of tiny tumors and the estimation of potentially extensive intraductal component in invasive (EIC) or in situ carcinoma (DCIS). Postoperative specimen sonography and/or thin sectioning with consecutive specimen radiography are helpful tools in the interdisciplinary approach on the evaluation of the \"real\" tumor size. Both methods invaluably assist the pathologist in the assessment of the specimen's margins. Vessel density, permeability and perfusion charcteristics differ from benign to malignant lesions. With upcoming contrast agents further tumor charcteristics may be evaluated by Doppler sonography and contrast-enhanced MRI. Learning Objectives: 1. Discuss which is the real size of breast cancer, including multifocality and multicentricity. 2. Discuss the potential of the imaging methods in assessing the \"useful\" tumoral size. 3. Discuss the vascularity of breast cancer as assessed by non radiological and imaging methods.A-354 C. Nodal invasion G. Rizzatto; Gorizia/ITThe principal route whereby most carcinomas migrate to distant tissues is via the lymphatics. Therefore nodal invasion is a very important determinant in breast staging. This evaluation is mostly based on the sentinel node (SLN) concept: the efferent lymphatic channel draining a primary tumor leads directly to the first SLN in the regional lymphatic basin.To better detect the SLN the use of a radiolabeled colloid at preoperative lymphoscintigraphy and intraoperative detection with gamma-ray detection probe have been incorporated into the traditional blue dye protocol. Actually this is the gold standard with a technical success rate of 88%, sensitivity of 93% and accuracy of 97%. Based on these excellent results many centers perform the axillary dissection only if sentinel nodes are not found or if positive nodes are found at physical examination.Incorporating ultrasound in the preoperative evaluation of nodal chains may avoid SLN procedure in over 20% clinically node-negative patients. Contrast agents allow perfusional studies that increase the sensitivity for small nodal metastases and allow useful monitoring in locally advanced breast cancers. Recent studies show interesting potentials also for PET and MR lymphography.In the near future nodal staging will include also molecular imaging with optical and near-infrared probes. Since its introduction, CT angiography has been an excellent clinical tool for evaluating thoracic aortic diseases. Multislice scanning has now made it possible to improve spatial resolution and, at the same time, include the abdomen into the evaluation. Fast retrospective ECG gating or prospective triggering suppress pulsation effects and can be considered in patients with suspected type A aortic dissections. Thin-section imaging is less important for the aorta than for evaluation of its side branches, especially in aortic dissections or aortitis. The presentation will discuss how the timing of contrast administration has to be adapted with faster scanners. The course will review the most critical question for aortic dissection, aortic aneurysm, aortic rupture as well as aortitis. Because of its speed, ease and diagnostic yield, multislice CTA is rapidly becoming the gold standard for the evaluation of the thoracoabdominal aorta. In young patients (radiation exposure) and in patients with impaired renal function, however, MRA should be preferred. Aggressive lesions encompass a wide spectrum of pathologies, these can be preliminarly classified as infectious or non-infectious conditions. Mycosis is the most common infectious lesion, manifesting in different forms, mainly depending on the host's immune system. Both invasive forms (most common in immunocompromised patients) and non-invasive forms (namely allergic fungal sinusitis and mycetoma) are described. Non-infectious aggressive lesions include granulomatous inflammatory diseases such as Wegener's granulomatosis and sarcoidosis. Both these may affect the paranasal area as an isolated manifestation or as a localization of a systemic disease. Chronic inhalation of cocaine also results in necrotizing vasculitis causing mucosal changes and wide bone erosions, often hard to differentiate from Wegener granulomatosis, even at pathology. Inverted papilloma is the most common benign tumor, arising from the lateral nasal wall and middle meatus. It is characterized by high recurrence rate and it may be associated with epithelial malignancies (5-8%). Vascular lesions include juvenile angiofibroma, angiomatous polyp, cavernous and globular capillary haemangioma. Imaging offers several clues for the differential diagnosis and to plan adequate treatment. Less common benign lesions include neurogenic tumors (schwannoma, neurofibroma), neuroendocrine tumors (paraganglioma), and mesenchymal lesions (leyomioma, non-ossifying fibroma). The DICOM (Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine) committee has approved in 2000 a new supplement called \"Structured Reporting\", which introduces generic objects for representing structured reports. This specification covers a wide spectrum of reports, from very basic free text documents with a few relevant images, up to highly structured documents including coded entries, and measurements derived from image data. We will first review the motivations which triggered the works on structured reports. Then, we will explain the \"SR tree\", a hierarchical structure that was defined to organize this information: the various kinds of nodes (called \"content items\"), as well as the meaning of the various relationships types connecting the parent to the child nodes, etc. Examples from the radiological domain will be provided. The notion of \"templates\", which are models of the content of a particular category of reports, will be briefly described.The importance of DICOM SR will be discussed, with regards to: (1) its industrial impact, especially in the context of the IHE (Integrating the Healthcare Enterprise) initiative, (2) The Clinical Document Architecture (CDA) is an HL7 standard for structuring clinical documents. It uses XML as the representation and storage format. CDA documents consist of header and body. The header contains the structured administrative information required in health care documents, the body the clinical information. CDA has a three level architecture dealing with the granularity of the structured clinical information. In level 1 the header is structured only, the body consists of textual data without markup and/or non textual data. In level 2 also the body is roughly structured and has in particular headings with standardized markup. In level 3 markup is used to specify details of the medical data. Release 1 of CDA is already ANSI approved. This release is mainly dealing with the header structure and provides only some structure elements of the body. It is already used in several international CDA projects and becomes more and more accepted as the standard of health care documents. Release 2 is currently in the HL7 balloting process. It is closely related to the HL7 Reference Information Model (RIM) and is dealing with the structured markup of detailed clinical data. RIM clones are used to define the clinical content of documents. CDA could as well be used to represent the content of radiology documents. Available examples will be explained. It can also be applied as an appropriate format for structured reporting of radiology documents. Relationships between both standards will be shown and possible solutions demonstrated. Learning Objectives:Participants of the session will understand: 1. The structure of the Clinical Document Archicture (CDA). 2. The structure and content of the CDA header.3. The different approaches to structure the body of CDA documents. 4. The applicability of the CDA standard for structuring radiology reports. 5. The relationahip to DICOM Structured Reporting Participants will be able to apply the CDA in their own environment.",

            "text": "The role of the interventional radiologist starts soon after fistula creation. From the 3 rd week after creation surgery, any clinical suspicion of delay in maturation should be imaged rapidly. An underlying stenosis is unmasked in all cases and is amenable to percutaneous dilatation in the vast majority of cases. The initial success rate of the endovascular approach is very high and the long-term salvage rate can reach 90% at 1 year. In mature fistulas, it must be borne in mind that the results of percutaneous dilatation are very much operator-dependent. This apparently simple, minimally invasive, procedure provides conflicting results because inexperienced operators frequently either underdilate stenoses that should be treated aggressively or dilate stenoses that are contraindications to any treatment because of underlying excessively high flow (elbow fistulas) or precarious arterial supply to the hand (diabetics, elderly), or simply because these stenoses would never threaten fistula patency. The largest series published to date showed that the outcome of native forearm fistulas after either dilatation or declotting is much better that of upper arm fistulas, which is better than prosthetic grafts. Indications for stent placement must be limited to acute dilatation-induced ruptures that are not controlled by reasonably long low-pressure balloon tamponade and to clearly insufficient results of dilatation (central veins and upper arm fistulas). This means that stents should never be placed in forearm fistulas, except for rupture control, since residual stenosis after dilatation in the forearm is always the consequence of the use of a balloon of insufficient diameter. Percutaneous angioplasty has been an effective technique in relieving central venous stenoses with technical success rates of 82% to 94%. The technique is simple with a very low morbidity. There are however limitations in the technique as certain types of lesions do not respond well to angioplasty alone. These include lesions with elastic recoil, kinking or rigid concentric stenoses. The primary patency after angioplasty is also limited with about 80% of patients with successful angioplasty requiring reinterventions at a mean of 7.5 months. Stents have therefore been utilised to address some of the limitations of angioplasty but their definitive role have still not been fully defined. Although stents can address the immediate problem of poor angioplasty response, the stented segment of vein is still very vulnerable to initimal hyperplasia. Primary patency after stenting is not very much better compared to angioplasty alone and stents do add additional cost to the procedure. However, reintervention after stenting has been noted to be easier and more effective. The standard techniques of angioplasty and stenting will be discussed during the workshop session with emphasis on tricks and tips when encountering difficult lesions. The possible complications that can be expected and their management will also be discussed. Macrocrania in children is a common presenting clinical feature. It affects 5% of the population. Macrocrania is an associated finding in some syndromes in which mental retardation is a cardinal clinical sign. In these cases, the medical problem is of a completely different nature. However, macrocrania in some instances appears isolated. Macrocrania by definition is the consequence of an increased growth of the cranium over the brain. It cannot appear after the closure of the sutures. The role of ultrasound is to check the ventricular size and to exclude massive hydrocephalus. CT scan is usually done following the ultrasound or directly as a first procedure. It will assess the ventricular size, rule out the presence of a brain tumor and look for a chronic subdural effusion. In many cases MRI will be performed to make a precise diagnosis, to appreciate the extent of a tumor or to do MR angiography. Main causes of macrocrania are as follows: hydrocephalus; external hydrocephalus; brain tumors; vascular malformations; vein of galen aneurysms; metabolic diseases; idiopathic. A familial incidence is often found. Mild mental retardation is not unusual. Headache is a very common and usually benign symptom in pediatric patients. Psychogenic headache and migraine are frequent. The classical characteristics of migraine are not always identifiable in younger patients. Organic lesions are present in a minority of children with headache but should be considered in every case. Abnormalities of the eye or maxillofacial area can cause headache. An intracranial lesion is the most feared cause of headache and should be looked for using computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging at the slightest doubt. The aim of the presentation is to give some rules concerning the choice of the imaging technique, depending of the clinical presentation and the degree of emergency. Intracranial lesions that can cause headache will be illustrated, including vascular malformations, either non-ruptured or responsible for subarachnoid hemorrhage, tumors, in particular in the posterior fossa, and hydrocephalus. Socalled benign intracranial hypertension will also be discussed. Neonatal asphyxia remains a considerable problem for neonatologists. Infants presenting with seizures have different patterns of injury, reflecting the aetiology of the insult. The major challenges for the next ten years are to understand these aetiologies and how to recognise their effects on the brain. Particularly important is the issue of timing, not only for medicolegal purposes but for future interventions. MR techniques need to be exploited to improve our understanding of tissue injury and the brain's response to it, so providing novel information to devise suitable interventions whether they be acute e.g. hypothermia or subacute e.g. anti-apoptotic. Serial MR studies coupled with accurate clinical information provide a way of establishing many of these objectives. Ideally post-mortem data should be coupled with MRI data. The current lack of post-mortem examinations The high magnetic field strength combined with strong gradients (40 mT/m) offers several advantages compared to 1.5 T scanners. Higher signal to noise ratio gives us the possibility to increase the resolution and/or shorten the scan time. A 3 T headscanner is smaller than a whole body scanner and has a short bore.To most patients it looks less frightening than ordinary size MRI scanners. This makes it possible to examine younger children and people with slight claustrophobia without using heavy sedation or full anesthesia. MRI-safety is another important issue working with high field MRI. Very few items like surgical clips, shunts or other metallic implants were declared 3 T MR-safe or 3 T MR-compatible when our headscanner was ready for the first patients in January 2002. Studies where we truly can see and appreciate the advantages of scanning with our 3 T headscanner are fMRI, MRA, MRS, perfusion, diffusion and morphological studies that need high resolution images. A brief presentation of these different examinations will be done and information given about specific patient preparations. Necessary additional equipment will be described. Recent experiences from starting up a 3 T whole body scanner will also be presented. Learning Objectives: 1. To gain knowledge about advantages and disadvantages with a 3 T headscanner. 2. To learn more about different functional brain examinations and why 3 T really has advantages compared to lower field strengths. 3. To be able to understand practical difficulties involved working with a high field system and also get some advice, based on our experiences. Not only the applied dynamic gradient fields (which may induce peripheral nerve stimulation), but also the acoustic noise produced by the gradients (which may create hearing damage and makes the use of ear protection essential) and the RF fields transmitted by the RF coils (which results in energy absorption for the patient and ultimately heats up the patient), make it essential to implement safety measures on the system to avoid surpassing of the safety limits. Also the applied static magnetic fields (known to create instantaneous effects such as nausea or dizziness or metal taste) may become a limiting factor for future scanners. The MR specific limits for these parameters for patients are described in the IEC 60601-2-33 international standard for safety of MR equipment (2 nd edition published in 2002). In addition, also the usage of liquid helium filled superconducting magnets poses a risk on the patient and many precautions are necessary to minimize this risk during e.g. a quench of the magnet. In spite of all these potential hazardous situations MR scanners are still considered to be a most safe and patient friendly modality. In MRI, safety issues affect everyday clinical practice. Every patient undergoing an MR examination has to be screened for implants, tattoos, eyeliner, and clothing, i.e. anything which may move in the magnetic field or that can heat up and cause injury. It is important to note that burns are the most reported incident in MRI. Even the way the patient is set up within the bore of the magnet is an important safety issue, especially if there are monitoring devices involved. Another major cause of injury in MR is projectile hazards; this means that all visitors and staff must be screened for potential \"missiles\" e.g. scissors. Visitors must be made aware of the risk and staff must be trained to minimize the risk. These issues will be discussed in term of good practice within the MR suite. Currently higher and higher field strengths are being installed which in turn means that patients and staff are exposed to higher and higher noise levels; this presents noise protection issues which will be discussed. Another important concern is that of pregnancy and MRI. The current state of play regarding imaging of pregnant patients and pregnant staff working in MRI will be addressed. A-374 C. Safety issues related with interventional MRI A. B\u00fccker; Aachen/DE MR-guidance of interventional procedures requires fast imaging sequence to speed up the procedure and even real-time imaging for guidance of vascular interventions. Interventional devices used have to be MR-safe as well as MRcompatible. Using passive methods for device visualization, one has to be aware of the artifact behaviour of interventional instruments in order to correctly localize the instrument tip. The artifact behaviour can be quite dependent on the applied imaging sequence (gradient versus spin echo) and sequence parameters like echo time and phase encoding direction. Active methods can overcome these potential problems and allow not only for device visualization but also for slice tracking. Drawbacks of active methods are more sophisticated hard-and software requirements. Furthermore safety issues concerning heating of long conductive wires have to be taken into account in order not to jeopardize the patient or interventionalist. First approaches are using fiberoptic means to achieve MRsafe active instrument visualization. While passive device visualization is sufficient for interventions like biopsies, vascular interventions will greatly profit from the possibility of slice and tip tracking of active means especially in the region of small and tortuous vessels. Performing interventions in the MR environment requires special awareness of all personnel involved in the procedure including anesthesiology. Consequently, a dedicated team should be set up in order to avoid accidents due to inexperienced handling of metallic patient support devices. Reporting discrepancies are common in radiology but fortunately only a minority effect patient management. While one can categorise their aetiology as being due to problems of technique, perception, knowledge and judgement, in reality the origins are often multifactorial and systemic. We need to learn lessons from the airline industry in improving safety.Teamworking is fundamental to optimising performance. However, individual accountability still remains even in a systems based culture, and we should have strategies for radiologists in difficulties. Learning from error and discrepancy is very important. We need to have a no blame reporting culture. Patients have the right to know of errors that have adversely effected their care. The communication of this information must be undertaken in a sensitive manner. A simplistic approach to accuracy in radiology needs to be replaced with a more complete model of radiologic performance. Learning Objectives: 1. How some \"incorrect\" radiological reports may be due to uncertainty or discrepancy rather than error. The scale and causes of error in radiology. 2. How a report can be diagnostically accurate but lack therapeutic impact. The relative infrequency of clinical effect on patients from radiological error. 3. Complacency is not appropriate and how we should learn from error in a supportive environment including properly conducted discrepancy meetings. The application of teamworking in radiology to improve patient safety and working lives.",

Injuries usually progress to degeneration of the articular surface. Injuries that penetrate subchondral bone undergo repair through formation of fibrocartilage. There is an increased interest in and demand for imaging cartilage since more patients are treated with various pharmacological and surgical techniques to repair cartilage. These procedures are most frequently performed in the knee and ankle. Autologous chondrocyte implantation is a technique in which a patient's own cartilage cells are harvested, grown ex-vivo, and reimplanted in a full-thickness articular surface defect, covered by a periosteal patch. The autologous osteochondral transplantation technique uses osteochondral plugs that are harvested from non-load-bearing areas and transferred into the articular defect. In fresh osteochondral allografting, a piece of the articular surface, with a thin layer of subchondral bone from a cadaver is transplanted into a damaged joint. Microperforation and fixation with biodegradable pins are two other repair techniques. The purpose of this lecture is to review different techniques for cartilage repair and transplantation, their indications and contra-indications and to draw special attention on the specific task of the radiologist in preoperative planning and postoperative evaluation of patients undergoing these procedures. The value of plain radiography, CT-scan and MR imaging, including qualitative and quantitative postprocessing techniques, will be discussed. Normal and pathologic imaging findings after autogenous chondrocyte implantation and osteochondral auto-or allografting will be demonstrated. Guidelines for optimal pre-and postoperative evaluation of cartilage will be proposed. The overwhelming number of images from modern scanners is a strong impetus for the development of computer-based support in the diagnostic and therapeutic process. The 80's was the decade of the CT, the 90's was the decade of the MR. Today we are in the middle of the process of making the logistics of image handling fully digital with PACS and workflow management. The next decade will show us the advent of spectacular computer vision techniques: for computer aided diagnosis (mammography CAD is the pioneering success story), interactive 3D visualizations with automated segmentation; image guided surgery and interventions, interventional and surgical simulations, image guided querying of huge image (PACS) databases, and learning recognition principles from these databases. Web-based second opinion systems may appear, and scientists look deeply into human visual perception principles to learn how they can mimic with the computer the spectacular performance of our brain.

Karssemeijer; Nijmegen/NL Computer aided detection of breast cancer is gaining acceptance as a new way of improving reader performance in screening mammography. Interpretation of mammograms has been known to be difficult for a long time. It appears that high rates of interval-and late detected cancers are hard to avoid in practice without increasing the rate of false positive referrals to an unacceptable level. Double reading is recommended, but often there are no resources to implement this. Under these circumstances the growing interest in the use of CAD is understandable.First applications of CAD in practice are aimed at avoiding observer errors due to oversight. In this case the CAD system puts prompts on suspicious areas to raise the attention of the reader. In this way errors due to oversight can be reduced. More recently, investigators have begun to explore possibilities for CAD to help radiologists in the diagnostic process. They have realized that part of the problem of screening is the large number of negative cases that have some abnormality. Many mammographic regions are inspected during screening and most do not lead to referral. There is evidence that the majority of screening errors are related to this decision making stage. To deal with this, new applications of CAD are aimed at helping radiologists to improve characterization of abnormalities.In the presentation an overview will be given of recent studies on mammography screening with CAD. Also implications of the introduction of full field digital mammography in relation to CAD will be discussed. Learning Objectives: 1. Better understand the nature of perception errors in breast cancer screening.2. Learn about the state of art of CAD in mammography.3.

Two technological developments, viz. image guided navigation and advanced surgical instruments play a key role in this development. Image guided navigation allows the visualization of the position of instruments in preoperatively acquired images thus facilitating the use of small incisions. Advanced surgical instruments, e.g. telemanipulation systems, enable the execution of complicated surgical manoeuvres even though instruments (e.g. robot arms) are inserted through small incisions. Some of the scientific, technological and logistical challenges of the widespread introduction of these techniques in the operation theatre are addressed. First, image guided surgery using preoperatively acquired data assumes that these data are representative for the patient in the operation theatre. If this is not the case, intraoperative updates are required. Examples are given how intraoperative 3D ultrasound can be used to compensate for brain shift in image guided neuro interventions, and how intraoperative fluoroscopy can be used to assist in CT-guided orthopaedic interventions. Second, the logistical challenges of the operation theatre, e.g. how to integrate the visualization of the real and the virtual patient, and how to combine advanced surgical instruments with image guided navigation, is discussed.

Widespread integrated use of information technology, image guidance and intelligent instrumentation offers a huge, and up to now only partially understood and explored potential for improved patient care.

            "text": "Biologically inspired image recognition B.M. ter Haar Romeny; Eindhoven/NL How do we see? Why do we recognize things so much faster and better then a computer? How does it work in our brain? Can we mimic this with software in our workstations, doing computer-aided diagnosis (CAD)? This talk explains visual perception principles for radiologists. The diagnostic workstation is rapidly becoming the super-assistant of the radiologist. The first FDA approvals to CAD programs, and their unexpected success, have triggered widespread attention to automated CAD systems. The field that invents the algorithms for such pattern recognition software is the field of computer vision. Actually, the notion \"vision\" can be taken literally: more and more inspiration for new clever designs of algorithms is coming from studies of the human visual system, i.e. how visual perception is done by the brain. Progress in understanding the basic physiologic mechanisms has been spectacular: next to studies with fMRI, MEG, diffusion tensor imaging, it is now possible to observe the firing of cortical neurons directly with voltage-sensitive dyes. The first levels of our visual perception in the occipital brain have been modelled carefully with mathematical models. The retina turns out to observe on many different resolutions. The brain has specialized cells for a wide range of features. (1) is to provide detailed preoperative assessment and follow-up including detection and differential diagnosis of recurrence and post-therapy sequelae. The goal in situation (2) is the evaluation of implant complications, tissue necrosis, scarring, local recurrence or new primary. Diagnostic tools are combination of clinical examination, mammography, sonography, MRI and guided biopsy. Additional diagnostic help is obtained by comparison with prior films. The quality of the postoperative imaging depends on preoperative assessment. All the congenital and benign conditions must be known before surgery in order to avoid postoperative interpretation problems. Pathology results and preoperative films as well as prior surgical and/or needle biopsy results must be present. Most of the postoperative complications may be evaluated by mammography and ultrasonography. Complicated cases require guided biopsy and/or MRI. FNA shows lower diagnostic capability among post-therapy conditions than preoperatively. Core/vacuum core biopsy provides more accurate information, therefore these techniques are the methods of choice. Dynamic post-contrast MRI is very useful but the radiologist must be aware of false negative and positive tests. MRI results should always be confronted to other imaging methods. Implants may be screened by ultrasound, but MRI is superior by evaluating the integrity of prosthesis. Gadolinium-enhanced 3 dimensional MRA (3D-Gd-MRA) has already been established as a non-invasive, accurate and safe technique for evaluation of the celiac trunk, the extrahepatic parts of the hepatic artery as well as the proximal parts of the superior mesenteric artery. This is particularly true for atherosclerotic disease as well as for the assessment of anatomic variants prior to liver transplantation or for postoperative controls. 3D-Gd-MRA still faces technical problems in the distal mesenteric vascular bed, in particular the distal arcades. Along with the rather long examination times 3D-Gd-MRA therefore still plays no substantial role in the evaluation of acute mesenteric ischemia. Similarly, the usefulness of the technique for assessment of vasculitis such as polyarteritis nodosa is also limited as small wall irregularities cannot be reliably detected due to a lack of spatial resolution. New k-space acquisition techniques such as parallel imaging, new intravascular contrast agents, as well as 3 Tesla MR systems might overcome these drawbacks. On the other hand, magnetic resonance imaging allows the exquisite combination of 3D-Gd-MRA with functional techniques. Non-invasive MR oxygenation measurements can be used to assess the significance of chronic ischemia in patients with celiac trunk or mesenteric artery stenosis. Phasecontrast flow measurements can be used to assess the flow reserve of the me-senteric vascular bed after caloric stimulation. Additionally, MRI can be combined with other MR imaging techniques such as MRCP or high-resolution morphologic imaging to provide a comprehensive assessment of neoplasms infiltrating into the portal venous system such as pancreatic cancer. In radiology the optimisation of imaging using ionising radiation must always consider the reciprocal relationship between radiation dose to the patient and image quality. Multi-detector CT scanners are more dose efficient than their predecessors but, with the facility to reconstruct ever thinner contiguous slices, the temptation is to use that dose efficiency to improve image quality rather than lower the dose. Standard multi-detector CT (MDCT) protocols are to some extent evidence based in that they are derived from protocols that have become established in clinical use and scanner specific modifications are performed with reference to the pref-",

Therefore any \"optimisation\" of protocols should be rigorous and evidence based; at present there is little published data on which to base optimisation of standard protocols, a situation that should improve as MDCT scanning becomes more widespread. MDCT, more than any previous CT technology, broadens the range of alterations that can be made to scanning parameters and therefore requires careful study into how this flexibility is best utilised. I aim to outline the range of optimising techniques available, comment on the scant existing literature and highlight some of the problems that may be encountered when trying to optimise protocols in an evidence based manner. The assertion that any radiation dose, no matter how small, can cause cancer is the basis for the linear no-threshold theory of radiation carcinogenesis. However, some health scientists consider the cancer risk from low-dose radiations as used in clinical practice for diagnostic procedures as being grossly exaggerated or even negligible. The European Commission has published precautionary measures in order to limit the radiation dose, in particular from CT, because the dose from a chest CT may be 100 times higher than that from a CRX. The influence of CT parameters (number of detector-rows, beam collimation, KVp, mAs, pitch, CTDIw), of patients parameters (height, weight, body mass index, age, gender, and underlying conditions) as well as of radiologist-dependant parameters on the effective dose are presented. Radiation dose levels from typical standard CT protocols with single and multislice technique are compared to those of a CRX. Low-dose HRCT and multislice CT protocols enable to reduce the radiation per examination by a factor of 10 as compared to standard acquisitions, mainly by decreasing the mAs or by increasing the pitch. Potential benefit in dose reduction by the use of low KVp is presented. Newly developed automatic dose reduction systems are promising because they adapt the tube conditions to the patient's geometry. Distinction has to be made between the radiation dose delivered to one single individual and the collective radiation dose because the effect of diagnostic strategies on the individual and the collective doses may be opposite. Learning Objectives: 1. To understand the characteristics and limitations of the linear no-threshold theory for calculation of cancer risks from low-dose radiations, and to become familiar with the resulting EC recommendations for chest CT. 2. To learn how CT and biometric parameters influence the effective radiation dose; to compare the radiation dose of standard multislice CT and low-dose multislice CT protocols with the doses delivered by other imaging modalities of the chest. 3. To learn how to decrease the radiation dose with multislice CT; to point out unsolved questions regarding the optimization of CT protocols and parameters for reducing the radiation dose. The role of computerized methods in orbital imaging is established. CT remains the method of choice in most emergencies, especially with bony and ocular trauma, including detection of intraorbital metallic foreign bodies. In intraorbital pathologies, CT and MR are used interchangeably. The MR is a more demanding and still less accesssible method but has undisputable advantages, especially regarding eye, optic nerve and extraocular muscles. Its superiority in superficial orbital structures and ocular imaging are subsequent to better tissue characterization and application of local coils. MR is complementary to ultrasound in problematic cases of congenital eye abnormalities, for tissue characterization and for evaluation of secondary extraocular involvement, especially in retinoblastoma and melanoma. Regarding optic nerve, application of different MR sequences, fat-saturated techniques and contrast media enable detection of even subtle pathology, like MS plaques, and precisely visualize extensiveness of disease along the whole course of the nerve.In the era of MSCT with precise multiplanar reconstructions, the main advantage of MR in extraocular muscles' imaging is the ability to define the activity of the pathologic process. It is especially helpful in thyroid orbitopathy, remaining one of the leading indications for computerized imaging of the orbit. The algorithm of MR study encompassess morphological sequences, with the especially important SE T1 and STIR, and short-lasting GRE scans used for quantitative analysis of eye motility disorders, especially diplopia. Imaging of suspected lesions affecting the intracranial visual pathway should be performed by MR. This refresher course will start with a brief discussion of examination protocol followed by a short review of anatomic landmarks and corresponding neurologic symptoms. Then a selection of pathologic lesions will be presented.The system includes clinical and imaging characteristics with differential diagnostic criteria of three main groups of potential pathologic lesions. The first is that of extrinsic brain tumors, which have a preference for the sellar region e.g. pituitary adenoma, skull base meningioma, craniopharyngioma. Vascular compres-A 117 B C D E F G sion syndromes by intracranial aneurysms can be classed in this group too. They present with different clinical symptoms, related to their location in the circle of Willis. The second great group is that of intrinsic brain tumors mainly affecting the visual tract and optic radiation. Imaging characteristics of e.g. glioma, ependymoma, glioblastoma or metastasis and differential diagnostic criteria are discussed. The last group of lesions presented is that of vascular and / or inflammatory processes.Learning Objectives: 1. The knowledge of anatomic landmarks of the intracranial pathway. 2. Their corresponding function and neurologic symptoms in case of pathologic involvement. 3. The information about differential diagnostic criteria of MR images concerning possible different intracranial pathologies. Percutaneous injection of methylmethacrylate is usually indicated when osteolysis involves the weight-bearing bone (i.e. vertebral body, acetabular roof). In nonweight-bearing bones, ethanol injection or thermal ablation are preferred. Percutaneous vertebroplasty with the injection of sclerosing agents seems promising in the management of symptomatic vertebral hemangioma. The main advantage of radio-frequency ablation is the ability to create a well-controlled focal thermal injury. Unlike alcoholization, radiofrequency ablation creates a well-demarcated lesion. The management of patients with bone tumors requires consideration of many factors: histology of the tumor with differentiation of benign and malignant tumors, careful evaluation of the patient's general condition, an understanding of the disease process, an appreciation of the degree of bone destruction and a working knowledge of available treatment options are required. A multidisciplinary approach is essential to determine the course of treatment that best alleviates pain, preserves function, and optimizes the quality of life remaining in the patient with malignant and metastatic disease. Magnetic resonance venography is a valuable cost-efficient and accurate technique for non-invasive evaluation of the venous system. Although non-contast methods are effective for evaluation of the venous system, they are time-consuming and prone to artefacts, predominantly because of slow venous flow-rates. In many departments, contrast enhanced techniques have become the mainstay for detection of venous anatomy, venous anomalies and venous pathology due to rapid scan times, freedom from artefacts and high accuracy. Depending on the anatomic location, different approaches may be appropriate. For example, injection of dilute contrast into an extremity vein alows high quality imaging of extremity veins \"upstream\" to the injection, however, the viscreal veins (portal, mesenteric, renal) cannot be evaluated by this \"direct\" method and must be evaluated by other \"indirect\" methods (non-contrast techniques or during ther \"venous\" phase of a contrast-enhanced MRA). Evaluation of the venous component of vascular malformations likewise requires careful attention to detail and depends on the site of the lesion. This presentation will describe optimal evaluation of the veins throughout the body in a time-efficient manner. Learning Objectives: 1. To understand the clinical indications for MR venography. 2. To describe the advantages and limitations for both non-contrast techniques and contrast-enhanced techniques. 3. To explain the rationale for and technique of \"indirect\" and \"direct\" contrastenhanced MR venography. 4. To illustrate the spectrum of findings in venous thrombosis. 5. To describe the strengths, limitations and pitfalls of MR venography in diagnosis of visceral, central and peripheral venous occlusion.A-404 C. DVT and lysis and stenting: Fact or fiction K. Ivancev; Malm\u00f6/SE Traditionally, treatment of DVT includes anticoagulation in order to minimize the long-term consequences, such as post-thrombotic syndrome (PTS). Currently, there is growing evidence to suggest that lysis, especially of iliofemoral thrombosis, with or without stenting, results in considerably better results than conservative treatment. The lysis is normally performed from the popliteal vein and often preceded by mechanical thrombectomy. Personal experience from 20 patients with acute upon chronic iliocaval venous occlusions has resulted in minor complications in 2 patients and patent stents in 15 patients (75%). The latter were cured. The remaining 5 patients (25%) had persistent PTS. The median follow-up time (colour Doppler and phlebography) was 377 days, range 3 days -6.2 years. Neonatal distress may be caused by a variety of different conditions related to the lungs, the heart, the diaphragm or the chest wall. Imaging procedures play an important role in diagnosing and monitoring respiratory distress, and although chest radiography is the most important diagnostic tool, sometimes additional imaging modalities like computed tomography, angiocardiography, ultrasonography and magnetic resonance imaging may be needed. An overview of conditions causing neonatal distress will be given. Diseases typical of premature babies like idiopathic respiratory distress syndrome and conditions related to air leak, such as pneumothorax and pneumomediastinum are explained. An open ductus arteriosus and persistent foetal circulation may be important factors in neonatal distress. Meconium aspiration, neonatal upper airway obstruction and pleural and pericardial effusions will be discussed. A special focus on the placement of the different tubes, catheters and drains needed for treatment is included. Chest wall abnormalities, abnormalities in lung development and in the diaphragm as well as important lung-and heart malformations responsible for neonatal distress are also presented. Imaging characteristics of the initial presentation as well as during and after treatment will be shown. Learning Objectives: 1. To recognize the characteristic radiological presentations of the most important conditions resulting in neonatal distress. 2. To understand the influence of congenital heart disease on neonatal distress, and to comprehend the role of the adaption of the pulmonary circulation at birth. 3. To become familiar with the different types of air leak in the newborn.",

Puig; Vienna/AT The foregut is defined as the anterior part of the alimentary tract leading from the mouth to the entrance of the bile duct. The human lung is a derivative of the primitive foregut and appears by 3 weeks of gestation as an enlargement of the caudal end of the laryngotracheal sulcus of the foregut. Further development of the pulmonary parenchyma includes 4 stages: the pseudoglandular period (5-17 weeks), the canalicular period (16-25 weeks), the saccular period (24 weeks to birth), and the alveolar period (late fetal period to childhood). Each of these stages are marked by distinct changes in tissue organization and cellular differentiation. Structural and functional defects in lung development may lead to a number of abnormalities including bronchopulmonary foregut malformations (BPFM). Routine US screening, performed at week 16 to 20 of gestation, enables the visualization of fetal intrapulmonary malformations. Prenatal MRI, especially with ultra-fast sequences, is an important adjunct helping to differentiate different masses and/or to evaluate large or atypical masses. This is particularly useful for the planning of in-utero interventional procedures, delivery, and immediate postnatal surgery. After birth, BPFM can produce acute respiratory difficulties in the infant. Chest radiography is the primary image tool. For further evaluation, high spatial resolution of contrast enhanced multi-detector CT (MDCT) is recommended to visualize small anatomical structures to either confirm the diagnosis or to demonstrate the exact anatomy for the surgeon. Using low-dose protocols in combination with multiplanar reformats leads to excellent image quality at low radiation exposure.A 119 B C D E F G Radiological investigation is one of the most important sources of information in the evaluation of abdominal distension in the neonate, but the need for these examinations should be carefully weighed in order to avoid inconveniencing the patient, unnecessary exposure to radiation or delaying surgical correction. This lecture will present a general approach to neonatal abdominal distension and will discuss the most common specific causes, the indication and performance as well as the diagnostic value of the commonly used modalities, giving some suggestions for an efficient imaging algorithm. Abdominal distension in the neonate is mainly attributable to intestinal obstruction, urinary tract dilatation, solid or cystic masses, and organomegaly. Intestinal obstruction is the most important cause of distension in the newborn period. The role of imaging may vary from helping to establish a diagnosis, to the evaluation of associated abnormalities, to surgical planning, or to therapy for some conditions like meconium ileus or meconium plug syndrome. Plain abdominal radiographs and sonography can frequently answer the clinically important questions; however, in certain conditions contrast enema is mandatory. CT or MRI is rarely indicated. Ultrasound is the best imaging modality to assess urinary tract dilatation causing abdominal distension, the result of this study guiding the selection of subsequent imaging modalities. Ultrasound is also ideal for the screening of solid or cystic masses and organomegalies. CT and MRI are unsuitable techniques for general screening but they provide excellent anatomic detail and add diagnostic specificity in the evaluation of complex anomalies and for surgical purposes. Why should we care about quality assurance in a \"state of the art\" digital X-ray department? We have got rid of all the chemical developers, film sheets and lousy viewing-boxes. Our new equipment is not as dose-dependent as earlier, and the images look almost perfect anyway. Effectivity is up and daily costs are down. We produce far more exams. Why bother with quality assurance when patients, staff and politicians are all happy? That's exactly why you should bother! Problems you don't easily see does not meen they are not present. They have in fact become bigger, and could in the long run cause even bigger damage than before. Quality assurance is a big issue. In my lecture, I will talk about both how to organize and start up a quality control system in a digital X-ray department. Who is best suited to perform quality testing, and what to do when problems are found. I will talk about how to monitor the image quality and patient doses, and how to evaluate both new and old equipment. I will give advice concerning the quality tools needed such as different phantoms and physical meters. My intentions are to motivate others to start similar work within their departments, and hopefully you can avoid som of the pitfalls that I have experienced. Continuing professional development (CPD) is now recognised as an essential element of contemporary radiography practice. Whereas CPD has a firmly established role in several specialties, in radiography much work remains to bring all practitioners into the CPD loop. A starting point is increasing awareness of the value of CPD. CPD benefits the individual practitioner, the patient, and the hospital system. For the individual, the acquisition of new or refreshed skills and knowledge enhances job satisfaction and professional self-respect. It may also stimulate new departures in sub-specialisation and research. For the public, CPD ensures contemporary standards of care -essential in an evolving, technology-driven field. For the hospital system, CPD contributes to efficiency, perceived standards of care, and long term success. Nonetheless, multiple barriers stand in the way of successful CPD. These include perceptions that education finishes at graduation, and that non-remunerated time in work-related activities is somehow wasted or unjust. At a hospital or departmental level, day-to-day manpower requirements and financial restrictions frequently impede the development of a CPD program. CPD will always be most effective when it is viewed as a partnership between the individual and employer. In this lecture I will briefly describe the fundamental elements of CPD and its importance to radiography and radiotherapy in the 21 st century. Suggested mechanisms of how to introduce CPD to radiographers, departmental chiefs and administrators will be presented. In particular, the Irish system of CPD will be presented and comparisons of CPD activity with our neighbours in Europe will be drawn. Learning Objectives: After session completion, the participant will have an understanding of: 1. How CPD is an important tool to encourage and motivate professional development. 2. Ways to set up a national CPD program/differences in Europe? 3. What impact will a compulsory program have on health resources -both personnel and financial. The presence of a small quantity of free intra-abdominal gas is one of the most important signs in medicine -almost always indicating perforation of an abdominal viscus. Small and large amounts of free gas on erect and supine abdominal and chest radiographs and how to recognise them will be extensively illustrated as well as those conditions which simulate free gas -pseudopneumoperitoneum. Learning Objectives: 1. To recognise both small and large amounts of free intra-abdominal gas on erect and supine radiographs. 2. To recognise those conditions which simulate free gaspseudopneumoperitoneum. 3. To understand the plain film techniques which may be used to evaluate equivocal cases. ",
