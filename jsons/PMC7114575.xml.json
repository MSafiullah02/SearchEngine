During a normal swallow, fluid and food are propelled caudally into the oropharynx and through the upper esophageal sphincter by contraction of the oral cavity, pharynx, and tongue. Concurrently, the epiglottis retracts to cover the laryngeal aditus and protect the trachea from particulate inhalation. In addition, adduction of the arytenoid cartilages contributes to further occlusion of the upper airways. Any process impeding these primary defenses or inhibiting normal swallowing reflexes greatly enhances the likelihood of aspiration.",

Irritation induced by acid inhalation promotes a local environment in which bacterial colonization can develop and lead to bacterial pneumonia.4 The severity of disease varies depending on the quantity and nature of the material aspirated as well as the length of time between the event and diagnosis. Conscious animals with intact airway reflexes tend to cough and prevent massive aspiration injury. Animals under anesthesia or with reduced airway reflexes caused by neurologic disorders are less likely to cough in response to the aspiration event and are, therefore, more likely to develop diffuse pulmonary infiltrates and serious lung injury. In many instances, aspiration injuries occur under general anesthesia and it should be noted that the presence of a cuffed endotracheal tube does not prevent inadvertent aspiration. Studies have shown that concurrent use of cisapride with a proton-pump inhibitor reduces the incidence of gastroesophageal reflux under anesthesia5\n,\n6 and therefore might reduce the likelihood of aspiration pneumonia.",

The pathophysiology associated with infectious respiratory disease in dogs and cats is discussed later in this article (Boxes 1 and 2\n).Box 1Canine infectious respiratory disease complex: changing the face of kennel coughCIRD complex (formerly known as kennel cough) is a syndrome in which multiple pathogens, both viral and bacterial, coinfect either na\u00efve, immunocompromised dogs or previously vaccinated dogs. This complex is multifactorial and it seems likely that both host and environmental factors play a role in the development of illness.40 Organisms associated with this disease are ubiquitous, especially in overcrowded housing facilities such as animal shelters and training facilities. It is likely that stress induced by the new environment and exposure to novel pathogens both play a role in development of disease.In most cases, respiratory signs are present for days to weeks and most animals show mild to moderate clinical signs. Typically, viral infections cause either a bronchopneumonia or bronchointerstitial pneumonia because of their propensity to infect and damage type I pneumocytes.41 As the condition progresses, desquamation of the respiratory epithelium and aggregation of inflammatory cells further reduce the lungs\u2019 natural defenses, increasing the potential for secondary bacterial colonization and infection.Previous studies have implicated viral organisms such as canine adenovirus or canine parainfluenza42 as major participants in CIRD, although recent studies have proposed novel respiratory pathogens such as canine respiratory coronavirus,7\n,\n43, 44, 45 canine influenza virus,43 and canine herpesvirus46 as additional important pathogens associated with CIRD. B bronchiseptica,9\n,\n47\nS canis, S equi subsp zooepidemicus,42 and M cynos\n7\n,\n48 have been implicated as secondary bacterial infections associated with CIRD. S equi subsp zooepidemicus infections, in particular, have been associated with a rapidly progressive and often fatal hemorrhagic pneumonia.40\n,\n49 Of note, some strains identified in outbreaks of this pathogen have been identified as resistant to tetracycline antibiotics, often the drug of choice prescribed for other bacterial pathogens associated with this complex.Box 2Feline lower respiratory tract infectionsOrganisms that have been reported as lower respiratory pathogens of cats include Pasteurella spp, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus spp, Streptococcus spp, Pseudomonas spp, B bronchiseptica, and Mycoplasma spp,50 and specific attention has been paid to Mycoplasma spp because of a possible association with the induction and exacerbation of asthma in adult and pediatric human patients.51 However, the association between lower respiratory infection and chronic inflammatory lower airway disease in cats is unclear and a topic of ongoing interest.\nMycoplasma spp are considered normal flora in the upper respiratory tract and their role is controversial in lower respiratory tract infection. Because they are rarely identified cytologically and specific culture or polymerase chain reaction is needed to document the presence of these organisms, the role of Mycoplasma in cats (as well as in dogs) remains difficult to define.",

In particular, CT is much better at identifying the presence and extent of bronchiectasis compared with thoracic radiography. In some cases, CT can be useful to identify migration tracts associated with inhaled foreign bodies.12 However, in most cases general anesthesia is required for CT acquisition, and prolonged recumbency can lead to atelectasis, which is difficult to differentiate radiographically from infiltrates. Repeating the CT in a different position after providing several maximal inspirations can alleviate atelectasis. Nuclear scintigraphy can be useful for the evaluation of ciliary dyskinesia, although secondary causes of mucociliary stasis (eg, infection with Mycoplasma or Bordetella, exposure to smoke) must be excluded before assuming the diagnosis of PCD. Because of the time necessary for image acquisition, MRI is not commonly used for the diagnosis of most respiratory diseases. PET has not been evaluated for use in bacterial pneumonia, although it might be useful in evaluating patients with atypical infiltrates or mass lesions when a definitive diagnosis is not forthcoming.",
