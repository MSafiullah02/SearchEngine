Overall, the air quality improved, most likely due to reduced emissions from the transportation and secondary industrial sectors. Specifically, the Journal Pre-proof J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 2 transportation sector was linked to the NO 2 emission reductions, while lower emissions from secondary industries were the major cause for the reductions of PM 2.5 and CO. The reduction in SO 2 concentrations was only linked to the industrial sector. However, the reductions in emissions did not fully eliminate air pollution, and O 3 actually increased, possibly because lower fine particle loadings led to less scavenging of HO 2 and as a result greater O 3 production. These results also highlight need to control emissions from the residential sector.",

The AQI averaged over all stations decreased by 20%, from 89.6 before the control period for Covid-19 to 71.6 during the controls (Fig. 2) , demonstrating an overall improvement in air quality from the control measures. A total of 322 of the 366 cities studied experienced a decline in the AQI. The highest AQI reductions occurred in the Ningxia, Shandong, and Henan Provinces ( of the 366 cities studied experienced reductions in CO (SO 2 , NO 2 ). The highest reductions of CO and NO 2 occurred in the Shandong and Henan Provinces (Fig. 3, Fig. S5 ) where there are large numbers of motor vehicles and many secondary industries (Fig. S2 ). This suggests that the reduced emissions from the transportation and industrial sectors were what caused the concentrations of these two gases to decrease. The largest decreases in SO 2 were found in Shanxi and Jiangxi Provinces (Fig. 4) , which have low numbers of vehicles but many secondary industries (Fig. S2 ). This indicates that the reduced SO 2 concentration was probably caused by the lower emissions from secondary industries during the control period.",

With the people largely confined to their homes, the provinces with higher numbers of vehicles should have had greater reductions in vehicle emissions during the control period, and the same should have been true for the secondary industries. The decreases in AQIs were more strongly correlated with the percentages of secondary industries than with motor vehicle numbers (Fig. 5) , suggesting that the changes in industrial emissions were more responsible for the improvements air quality, especially fine particles, than motor vehicle usage.",

Therefore, the reduction in the PM 2.5 is best explained by lower emissions from the transportation and industrial sector. The reduced NO 2 concentrations were positively correlated with both vehicle numbers (R 2 = 0.44, p < 0.001; Fig. 6 ) and industrial NO x emissions (R 2 = 0.36, p < 0.01; Fig. 6 ), indicating that decreased emissions from both the transportation and industrial sectors led to improvements in NO 2 . As the reduced NO 2 concentrations were more strongly correlated with vehicle population than with the industrial NO x emissions, transportation probably was more responsible for the decrease in NO 2 concentrations. The SO 2 concentrations showed a significant positive relationship with industrial SO 2 emissions (R 2 = 0.16, p < 0.1; Fig. 6 ) but not with motor vehicle numbers. Therefore, the reduced SO 2 concentrations were only linked to the industrial sector. The CO concentrations showed a significant positive correlation with both the vehicle numbers (R 2 = 0.17, P < 0.05; Fig. 6 ) and percentages of secondary industries (R 2 = 0.29, P < 0.01; Fig. 6 ), but the stronger correlation with the latter (Fig. 6) suggests a reduction in industrial emissions was more responsible for the decrease. Although the air quality improved, the average AQIs in 84 of the 169 cities in northern China were greater than 100 after the controls were implemented, suggesting that the air pollutants in many cities were still at harmful levels. This means that even though the reduced emissions from the transportation and industrial sectors did lead to improvements in air quality, the concentrations of some pollutants were still at unhealthy levels.",

The total number of motor vehicles in China increased from 5.5 million in 1990 to 327 million in 2019 (Wu et al., 2017; MPSC, 2019) , which is a 60-fold increase over 30 years. However, increasingly stringent emission standards, electric vehicle subsidies, and the promotion and development of the public transportation have limited the impacts from mobile emissions (Wu et al., 2017) . In fact, those measures have prevented increases in the vehicular emissions of air pollutants (except for NO x ) since 2010 (Wu et al., 2017) . As a result, the contribution of the transportation sector to air pollution has not increased in parallel with the rising numbers of vehicles on the roads (van der A et al., 2017).",

For perspective, under normal circumstances, thermal power generation contributes 20.1% of the total SO 2 emissions and 32.6% of the total NO x in China (Huang et al., 2017) .

Indeed, the residential sector became the major contributor (>50%) to PM 2.5 in representative cities of northwestern China during the winter of 2016-2017 J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 13 period, possibly because lower fine particle loadings led to less scavenging of HO 2 and as a result greater O 3 production. These results illustrate the importance of reactions that can occur between gaseous and particulate pollutants, but clearly, lowering the emissions of both NO x and VOC s will be needed to control O 3 . Results of our study highlight the importance of emissions from the residential sector for wintertime pollution in northern China, and they show that this source must be taken into account in developing pollution mitigation plans.
