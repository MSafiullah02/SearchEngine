            "text": "IOP is the result of a delicate balance between production and outflow of aqueous humor (Figure 12-3\n). In glaucoma both production and outflow are altered. Usually a large percentage of the outflow pathway (perhaps as much as 80% to 90%) needs to be impaired before IOP starts to rise. If the outflow system is impaired to the point that IOP begins to increase, the eye usually attempts to compensate by reducing the passive production of aqueous humor. Active secretion, however, typically continues at a relatively normal rate, perhaps because if it did not, the avascular tissues of the eye that rely on aqueous humor for their nutrition would starve. Because the glaucomatous eye is functioning on a greatly diminished percentage of its normal levels of aqueous humor outflow and production, and because it has exhausted its usual compensatory pathways, pathologic processes or drugs that alter production or outflow only a small amount can have dramatic effects on IOP. This characteristic is one reason that glaucomatous eyes are typically more responsive to antiglaucoma drugs than normotensive eyes, but it also explains why IOP can rapidly rise to very high levels in a matter of 1 to 2 hours in some patients.",

For example, stimulation of \u03b2-adrenergic receptors in the ciliary processes increases intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), resulting in greater aqueous humor production. \u03b2-Adrenergic blocking drugs (e.g., timolol, betaxolol) decrease cAMP, thereby lowering aqueous humor production and ultimately reducing IOP. \u03b2-Blockers reduce IOP, however, only if the patient is awake and adrenergic tone is present. This means that although a drug such as timolol can reduce IOP in a cat when it is awake, the agent may not control IOP for the more than 20 hours a day the cat is sleeping.",

A few minutes after application of these drugs, however, IOP begins to decrease, and it stays reduced for several hours. This is because epinephrine also increases aqueous outflow via \u03b22 receptors in the trabecular meshwork, and does so to a greater degree than it increases aqueous humor production. Epinephrine may also lower IOP by (1) reducing blood flow to the ciliary body (thereby lowering aqueous production) and (2) increasing uveoscleral outflow by relaxing the ciliary muscle and recruiting prostaglandins. The latter means, which can be blocked by topical nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, may result in further increases in uveoscleral outflow and additional decreases in aqueous humor production. Complex interactions such as this are but one reason why both \u03b2-adrenergic agonists and \u03b2-blockers lower IOP in many species. When one considers species and individual differences in the density, distribution, and type of receptors as well as differences in the cause of the glaucoma, it is easy to see why it can be difficult to precisely predict what effect a given drug will have on IOP in a particular patient.",

The longer glaucoma remains unresolved, the greater the chance that peripheral anterior synechiae will form and permanently block the drainage angle by fixing the peripheral iris in position.",

Retinal nerve fibers run parallel to the surface of the retina and then turn 90 degrees to enter the multilayered, fenestrated meshwork of the lamina cribrosa before exiting the eye. Glial cells, blood vessels, and collagen beams form variably sized pores through which the optic nerve fibers pass. When IOP rises the scleral lamina cribrosa bows posteriorly, distorting the alignment of the pores and compressing the optic nerve fibers. Although this change may initially be so subtle as to not be detected ophthalmoscopically, it is sufficient to mechanically interfere with axonal axoplasmic flow and also probably with blood supply to the optic nerve head. Very large increases in IOP may also interfere with blood flow to the choroid and produce vision loss through ischemic damage to the photoreceptors and outer retinal layers. In acute glaucoma the optic disc may appear swollen in response to ischemia. Within a day or two the increased pressure may cause the disc to appear pale and compressed. As ganglion cell axons die, optic nerve head tissue is lost and pressure forces the lamina cribrosa outward (Figure 12-21, Figure 12-22, Figure 12-23\n). This change indicates irreversible damage to the optic nerve. Wallerian degeneration of the optic nerve follows (Figure 12-24\n).",

In human primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG), in which the rise in IOP is more insidious and of usually smaller magnitude than in acute canine primary angle-closure glaucoma (PACG), vision loss is usually attributed mainly to retinal ganglion cell degeneration. Pressure-associated alterations in microcirculation and/or axoplasmic flow at the level of the lamina cribrosa may play a role in the death of ganglion cells in this form of glaucoma. Dying ganglion cells may then release glutamate and other excitatory compounds that initiate a self-perpetuating circle of apoptotic cell death in previously unaffected neighboring ganglion cells. In dogs with acute PACG and more rapid/marked increases in IOP, one study found retinal damage to extend well beyond the ganglion cell layer. Within the first few days of an attack of acute PACG ganglion cell necrosis and segmental full-thickness areas of retinal attenuation consistent with infarction were apparent. As ganglion cell and retinal necrosis decreased over the ensuing days retinal cell death by apoptosis markedly increased. This finding suggests that in acute PACG, the marked increase in IOP not only interferes with axoplasmic flow through the lamina cribrosa but also causes ischemic necrosis of the retina. Again, as these cells die they initiate a vicious circle of progressive cell death due to apoptosis that continues despite normalization of IOP. This hypothesis would explain the clinical observation that even though IOP is controlled in some dogs with PACG, progressive vision loss still occurs.",

Primary glaucomas have no consistent, obvious association with another ocular or systemic disorder, are typically bilateral, have a strong breed predisposition, and hence are believed to have a genetic basis (see Box 12-2). Primary glaucoma is subdivided into two main forms, primary open-angle glaucoma, in which the drainage angle appears gonioscopically normal (presumably because the impediment to aqueous outflow is deep to the pectinate ligaments) and primary angle-closure glaucoma, in which the drainage angle appears gonioscopically narrowed or closed (Figure 12-28, Figure 12-29, Figure 12-30, Figure 12-31, Figure 12-32, Figure 12-33\n). In the dog, PACG is at least eight times more common than POAG. Acute PACG also is two times more common in female dogs than in male dogs.

Therefore the longer the increased IOP persists, the more difficult it will be to successfully treat the patient.Box 12-3Glaucoma classification by location (posterior to anterior)\n1.Ciliary body\u2013vitreous\u2013lens (malignant glaucoma):a.Block at ciliary body, vitreous, and lens with posterior pushing of lens-iris diaphragm\n2.Pupil:a.Relative block due to iris to lens appositionb.Vitreous within pupil aperturec.Lens within pupil aperture:(1)Luxated lens(2)Intumescent lens\nd.Posterior synechia/iris bomb\u00e9\n3.Trabecular meshwork:a.Primary open-angle glaucomab.Secondary obstructions:(1)Preiridal fibrovascular membranes(2)Cellular/proteinaceous material:(a)Vitreous(b)Plasma proteins(c)Neoplastic cells(d)Red blood cells(e)Pigment(f)Epithelial downgrowth through corneal perforation\n\nc.Primary angle-closure glaucoma:(1)Appositional closure(2)Synechial closure\nd.Secondary angle-closure glaucoma:(1)Peripheral anterior synechia(2)Ciliary body swelling/inflammation/cysts(3)Neoplasia(4)Anterior shifts of lens-iris diaphragm\n\n4.Posttrabecular forms:a.Angular aqueous plexusb.Scleral outlet channelsc.Episcleral vein obstructions\n5.Developmental anomalies of the outflow system6.Idiopathic mechanisms7.Combined-mechanism glaucoma: more than one of the preceding mechanisms\nAdapted from Slatter D (2003): Textbook of Small Animal Surgery, 3rd ed.

An overt attack of glaucoma usually occurs in the initially normotensive fellow eye a median of 8 months after disease in the first eye becomes apparent. Again, the precise mechanism by which PACG occurs is uncertain, but there is a clear association with congenital pectinate ligament dysplasia (PLD or goniodysgenesis; see later). It is also associated with a female sex predisposition (approximately 2:1 female-to-male ratio), periods of stress or excitement, and dim light. Women also have a similarly higher risk of PACG than men, which has been attributed to a smaller, somewhat more \u201ccrowded\u201d anterior chamber in women.

Evidence for this view comes from the observation that even though PLD is present at birth, glaucoma does not develop until the dog is typically middle-aged to old. Additionally, although virtually every dog in which PACG develops has PLD, only about 1% of dogs with PLD have glaucoma at some point in their lifetimes. This means that the vast majority of dogs with PLD never have glaucoma. Even if one limits the population to include only the dogs with the most extreme form of PLD (360-degree sheets with few flow holes), the risk of glaucoma increases to only about 15%. Finally, PLD alone does not explain the association of PACG with other risk factors, such as female sex predisposition, stress, and dim light. In the aggregate, these observations suggest that PLD is only the first step in a multistep process leading to PACG.",

            "text": "Recent imaging of the anterior segment in dogs experiencing an acute episode of PACG has led to a mechanistic theory, which holds that the event that initiates an attack may be impaired outflow at the level of the pupil (see Figure 12-30, Figure 12-31, Figure 12-34). According to this theory, stress or excitement may raise heart rate and increase the difference between the systolic and diastolic blood pressures in the choroidal blood vessels. The increases in heart rate and pulse pressure result in a faster and larger forward \u201cpush\u201d by the choroidal blood vessels on the posterior vitreous during systole. This force ultimately is transferred through the vitreous to the aqueous humor in the posterior chamber, causing an additional small bolus of aqueous humor to be forced through the pupil into the anterior chamber during systole. In the normal eye (or if the pulse pressure is normal) this fluid would simply flow back into the posterior chamber during diastole or, if trapped in the anterior chamber, it would force the iris more posteriorly, thereby opening the iridocorneal angle and allowing the additional fluid to exit via an expanded trabecular meshwork. In the eye at risk for PACG, however, exit of this small bolus of additional aqueous humor is impeded by abnormal pectinate ligaments, which may also prevent the angle from \u201cpopping open\u201d in response to increased pressure in the anterior chamber. Alternatively, or perhaps in combination with PLD, age-associated declines in trabecular meshwork facility may also prevent the additional aqueous humor from escaping the anterior chamber. This results in a transient pressure differential in which pressure is slightly greater in the anterior chamber than in the posterior chamber. If the pupil is midrange in size the iris can be pressed more firmly against the lens, resulting in a \u201cball-valve\u201d effect and a so-called reverse pupillary block (see Figure 12-34). A midrange to somewhat dilated pupil (as occurs in dimmer light or during excitement) is more floppy and readily pressed against the lens than a very large or very small pupil. Very large pupils tend to cause the iris to \u201cslide\u201d off the more highly curved equatorial region of the lens, and very small pupils tend to have an iris that is taut and more resistant to compression against the lens. The next systole results in the forcing of a little more aqueous humor from the posterior chamber into the anterior chamber, further increasing IOP. This process continues until IOP reaches a physiologic maximum (typically 60 to 80 mm Hg) that is related to systemic blood pressure and the resistance of the intraocular tissues. Intermittent, spontaneously resolving attacks may occur if reverse pupil block develops but the pupil dilates to the point at which it can \u201cslide\u201d off the more highly curved equatorial region of the lens and break the block at the pupil; this block would then allow the excess aqueous humor to flow back through the pupil into the posterior chamber. If the block is not broken at the pupil, the iridocorneal angle and ciliary cleft may further collapse, thereby worsening the attack and making effective therapy much more difficult even though the whole process is of relatively short duration.",

Very often, secondary angle-closure glaucoma complicates the latter stages of the process as the root of the iris is pushed forward into the angle. These apposed but not fused tissues (appositional closure) quickly lead to permanent adhesions and peripheral anterior synechia (synechial closure).

Deaths due to pulmonary edema also have been reported if mannitol is given to animals anesthetized with methoxyflurane. A hyperosmotic agent should be used with caution if the blood-ocular barrier is not intact (uveitis, hyphema), because a leaky barrier may allow mannitol to enter the vitreous, thereby pulling water into the vitreal cavity and increasing IOP.",

These procedures would theoretically address the root cause of the glaucoma and allow for more normal nutritional support for the cornea and lens, because they would enable aqueous humor production to continue at more normal levels. Full- or partial-thickness holes in the sclera, however, have been plagued by fibrosis over the filtering site and long-term failure to control IOP in most patients. Artificial aqueous humor shunts (gonioimplants) with or without pressure-sensitive valves (to prevent IOP from getting too low) have also been used to try to create a pathway for aqueous to drain from the eye, but these also have the problem of development of a scar tissue\u2013lined, cystlike space that again becomes relatively resistant to the flow of aqueous humor (Figure 12-42\n). In an effort to avoid fibrosis around the drainage device, some surgeons have placed the distal end of the tubing into the frontal sinus, parotid salivary duct, nasolacrimal duct, or the orbit. None of these approaches, however, has been demonstrated to be more effective than subconjunctival drainage, and endophthalmitis is always a risk if the tube is placed in structures that communicate with the outside environment. Use of an antimetabolite such as mitomycin C or 5-fluorouracil may limit fibrosis over the body of the implant and improve its long-term filtering capacity. Adjunctive medical antiglaucoma therapy, or a limited cyclodestructive procedure, may also be used to fine-tune IOP control once control is achieved grossly with the implant.",

Techniques for destroying the portion of the ciliary body that make aqueous humor include cyclocryotherapy with either liquid nitrogen or nitrous oxide, cyclophotocoagulation (cyclophotoablation) with either a diode or neodymium:yttrium-aluminum-garnet (Nd:YAG) laser, cyclodiathermy, focused ultrasound, and chemical ablation. In practical terms, however, only cyclocryosurgery and cyclophotocoagulation are reliable and used with any regularity today. These are relatively crude procedures because they require the surgeon to estimate both the degree of outflow impairment and the amount of cyclodestruction necessary to match that impairment. Often the outflow facility is so severely compromised that the eye is highly sensitive to even minor alterations in aqueous production, resulting in a relatively narrow margin for error in these estimates. Too little destruction can result in persistence of the glaucoma, and too much can lead to phthisis bulbi. It is also not uncommon for outflow to be so severely impaired that aqueous humor production must be reduced to levels that cannot maintain normal ocular health, resulting in cataract formation or corneal endothelial decompensation and vision loss even though IOP is controlled. Failure to control IOP in the long term with these procedures is the result of inadequate destruction of the ciliary body, regeneration of the ciliary epithelium, and progressive angle closure with loss of additional outflow capacity. Despite these limitations, however, a cyclodestructive procedure is more appealing as a single procedure than a gonioimplant or filtering procedure because it is faster, technically easier, less expensive to perform, and repeatable.",

Precise application of the cryoprobe over the ciliary processes and avoiding the 3 and 9 o'clock positions is essential. If the globe is approximately normal size, a 3-mm (diameter) nitrous oxide glaucoma cryoprobe is centered 5 mm posterior to the limbus (Figure 12-43\n). If the globe is enlarged, the cryoprobe is centered 5.5 to 6.0 mm posterior to the limbus. Gentle pressure on the globe, slightly indenting it, enlarges the extent of the ciliary destruction by shortening the distance between the cryoprobe and target tissue and by reducing blood flow to the area. Usually six to eight spots are frozen for 2 minutes when nitrous oxide instrumentation is used. Timing begins when the probe achieves a temperature of \u221270\u00b0 to \u221280\u00b0 C, a range that correlates with a temperature in the ciliary body of at least \u221210\u00b0 C, which is necessary to cause cyclodestruction.

The exact incidence of glaucoma in cats is unclear, although data from the Veterinary Medical Data Base suggested that 1 in 367 cats presenting to a University Teaching Hospital had glaucoma. In contrast, a prospective evaluation in a feline exclusive private practice found that 0.9% of cats 7 years or older had abnormally high IOP on tonometric screening.",

Inherited congenital POAG has been described in Siamese cats, but acute PACG as seen in dogs is rare to nonexistent in cats. The rise in IOP in the vast majority of cats tends to be slow and insidious, and the condition is usually unilateral. Many cats with glaucoma initially present for another ocular disorder (chronic uveitis, iris color change, intraocular mass). Another common presentation, especially for those with aqueous humor misdirection syndrome (see earlier description in this chapter), is anisocoria with slowly progressing buphthalmos. The buphthalmos can be quite extreme in some animals. Ocular pain also tends to not be as obvious as in dogs, perhaps because the rise in IOP is typically not as abrupt or as high as in dogs, but there is no reason to believe that the condition is not painful in cats like it is in other species. Often the inciting cause is difficult to identify by the time the patient is first seen.",

The most common clinical signs are dilated pupil, lens luxation, buphthalmos, exposure keratitis, and retinal degeneration.

For example, latanoprost and the other commercially available prostaglandins do not lower IOP in cats, although they can induce profound miosis. The topical CAI brinzolamide did not lower IOP in normal cats when administered every 12 hours but may do so when given every 8 hours to cats with glaucoma. A related topical CAI, dorzolamide given every 8 hours, is effective in lowering IOP in glaucomatous cats. As in dogs, topical application of dexamethasone or 1% prednisolone acetate has increased IOP in cats, but the clinical significance of this finding is unclear. Additionally, unilateral topical administration of 0.5% tropicamide can raise IOP an average of approximately 3.5 mm Hg in both the treated and untreated eyes, and in some cats this increase may be as much as 17 to 18 mm Hg in the treated and untreated eyes. These observations reinforce the concept that cats are anatomically and physiologically distinct from dogs and that some therapies appropriate for the dog may not be transferable to the cat.",

Cyclodestructive procedures are often unsuccessful in the long term in cats, perhaps because of the nature of their glaucoma. Evisceration with insertion of an intrascleral prosthesis may be performed, although the cosmetic results with a black silicone ball are less satisfactory than that achieved with dogs because of the normally brightly colored feline iris and vertically oriented slit pupil. Varying the color of the sphere and tattooing a slit pupil onto the cornea can improve the postoperative appearance of the globe.

Glaucoma is less commonly recognized in horses than in dogs or cats, perhaps because the uveoscleral pathway constitutes a greater percentage of the equine outflow pathway. Although primary glaucoma appears to occur in horses, the most common form is glaucoma secondary to chronic anterior uveitis or intraocular neoplasia. Appaloosas, horses with concurrent equine recurrent uveitis, and horses older than 15 years are at greater risk of glaucoma. Clinical signs of equine glaucoma include corneal striae (caused by rupture of Descemet's membrane), buphthalmos, decreased vision, lens luxation, loss of the pupillary light reflex, mild anterior uveitis, optic nerve atrophy, optic disc cupping, and elevated IOP. Because many horses with glaucoma also have anterior uveitis, the pupil is often miotic or normal in size and is not dilated as is common in other species. A feature that complicates both the diagnosis and therapy of equine glaucoma is that the IOP fluctuates markedly, and frequent measurements may be necessary to demonstrate the presence of glaucoma and the effects of treatment. The reason for this fluctuation is unclear but it may involve compression of the globe by the orbicularis oculi or extraocular muscles. Auriculopalpebral nerve block may be required to obtain accurate applanation tonometry in fractious horses, and sedatives may significantly decrease IOP.",

Studies of antiglaucoma drugs in horses often yield conflicting results, suggesting that there may be considerable interindividual variations in the responsiveness of this species to many antiglaucoma drugs. For example, topical pilocarpine given alone can increase IOP in many, but not all, horses. The mechanism for this finding is unclear but may involve exacerbation of preexisting uveitis, pupillary block, or a reduction in the uveoscleral outflow pathway. Atropine, which stabilizes the blood aqueous barrier and may increase uveoscleral outflow, can reduce IOP in many normal horses and in horses with glaucoma secondary to chronic uveitis. Atropine can, however, also raise IOP in some horses. The prostaglandin derivative latanoprost does not lower IOP in normal horses (or does so only by 1 to 2 mm Hg) and can be quite irritating. Other studies have indicated that topical prostaglandins exacerbate elevated IOP in horses with glaucoma. Only timolol or the topical CAIs seem to consistently lower IOP in horses. Systemic CAIs may be prohibitively expensive in horses, and their efficacy and safety has not been determined. Antiglaucoma therapy in the horse often involves a combination of antiglaucoma and antiinflammatory drugs. Unfortunately, the therapy of primary equine glaucoma is largely empirical owing to our lack of understanding of the pathogenesis of the condition.",
