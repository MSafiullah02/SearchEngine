Another study showed that mothers received an average of 3.1 non-vitamin medications during pregnancy (2) . A recent study of French women showed that 99% received a prescription for at least one medication during pregnancy, with a mean of 13.6 medications per woman (3): 1.6% of the women received a medication in the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) X category (fetal risk outweighs benefits), and 59% of women had a prescription for drugs from the D category (fetal risk but benefits may be acceptable). When expressed as a percentage of exposed women, the most commonly prescribed classes of drugs were gastrointestinal drugs (69.4%), dermatologic drugs (63.0%), and analgesics (62.3%) (3) . An accompanying commentary does point out that, for cultural reasons, the French have one of the highest prescribing levels in Europe.",

Thus, the health care provider must be aware of appropriate pharmacologic therapy for a variety of conditions and the potential impact on the pregnant or lactating women. In general, the clinician should ask what the appropriate treatment in the non-pregnant state would be. In most cases, the answer is the same for women who are pregnant (6) .

Thus, the first trimester is the most critical time period for a teratogenic effect. After this, any effect will likely involve growth restriction or an effect on the nervous system and gonadal tissue. Overall growth continues throughout the remainder of the pregnancy and because the nervous system and gonads develop slower than other organ systems, they are vulnerable to teratogenic effects over a longer period of time.",

They further suggest use of a narrative-based system to summarize available data. The FDA has begun working on such a narrative-based system, and information is available online (http:// www.fda.gov; search site for \"pregnancy\" and \"labeling\"). Briefly, the FDA began to ask a series of questions concerning the pregnancy labeling system that had been started in 1979. At a public hearing in September 1997, they asked whether health care providers relied on the system, is it useful, what is good or bad about it, and what are the problems and how can they be fixed? It has been thought that the system in place is used and appreciated for its simplicity. On the other hand, the simplicity is a problem when trying to apply it in clinical decision making, given the fact that the data behind the specific category assignments is not clearly evident. In May 1999, a concept article that outlined a model for labeling and included suggested sections titled, \"clinical management statement,\" \"summary risk assessment,\" and \"discussion of data\" for both pregnancy and lactation was presented. Discussion of the new system is ongoing and includes the suggestion of establishing pregnancy registries to provide data about exposure during gestation. The final form of labeling that the FDA will approve is to date undetermined Given the difficulty of ascertaining safety on the basis of FDA assigned categories, we suggest that providers become familiar with some of the Internet databases and Web sites with drug information to provide the most accurate and up-to-date information to patients. The three databases housed within the REPRORISK system are described in the Resources for Clinicians column in this issue and listed in Appendix A of this article. These commercially available databases have extensive up-todate lists of teratogens and their known effects.",

There were 10 malformed infants among 65 women exposed to brompheniramine (Bromfed) during the first trimester, yielding a relative risk of 2.34 (P \u03fd .05). Their defects were mild, and the rates varied at the different participating institutions, making the clinical relationship to drug ingestion questionable despite the statistical significance. Furthermore, in the Boston Collaborative Drug Surveillance Program (22) , only 5 of 172 brompheniramine (Bromfed)-exposed women delivered malformed infants, which was equal to the expected background rate of malformations seen in women unexposed to any teratogen. Triprolidine with pseudoephedrine (Actifed) and phenylpropanolamine with chlorpheniramine (Ornade) were found to be safe.",

Three approaches to treatment of the penicillinallergic patient are supported by different sets of literature. One approach is to avoid all antibiotics with a beta-lactam ring including cephalosporins. A second approach is to treat the patient as long as the allergy did not result in serious sequelae such as anaphylaxis or immediate hypersensitivity reaction. The third approach is to skin test for penicillin and to only treat those with negative tests.

The effect increases with gestational age (46) , and use of indomethacin (Indocin) is not recommended after 32 weeks' gestation. In addition, indomethacin can cause profound adverse effects on fetal renal function, leading to decreased urine output and frank oligohydramnios (47, 48) . If indomethacin is given for a prolonged period, oligohydramnios can lead to pulmonary hypoplasia and neonatal death. In general, we do not recommend use for more than 2 days beyond the first trimester. Similar but more limited information is available for ibuprofen (Advil). Both indomethacin and ibuprofen are considered compatible with breastfeeding (17) .",

Non-pharmacologic therapy has been used successfully to eliminate nausea and vomiting of pregnancy. Two recent publications have evaluated acupressure or acustimulation at the Neiguan point (P6). The P6 point is located on the surface of the forearm about 4 -5 cm above the wrist (52) . In a study from Sweden, 60 women were randomized to receive pressure at P6, pressure at another point, or no treatment. In the experimental group, a band was used to apply pressure at P6; a similar band applied pressure at a point on the upper side of the wrist in the second group. Women with nausea and vomiting not receiving other treatment could take part in the study. The bands were worn for 2 weeks, with removal only during showering. Significant differences were found in ratings of nausea with a reduction in the P6 group versus the no-treatment group. There was some initial effect in the group receiving pressure at the non-P6 point, which disappeared in the second week.",

Divided doses of 8 -20 g/day were used. However, the results were often disappointing, doing little to relieve maternal symptoms while being difficult for the patient to take. Women who take cholestyramine should also take vitamin K throughout the remainder of pregnancy because cholestyramine binds this vitamin and can lead to vitamin K deficiency. There is now some evidence that ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA), also called ursodiol (Actigall), a minor, naturally occurring hydrophilic bile salt, both reduces maternal pruritus and improves biochemical abnormalities without obvious adverse effects on the newborn (66 -68) .

            "text": "Many medications are available to treat depression. Tricyclic antidepressants have traditionally been used, and amitriptyline (Elavil) and imipramine (Tofranil) have been frequent choices. Pooled data from more than 300,000 births with 414 first-trimester exposures found no significant risk of congenital malformations (72) . The Michigan Medicaid data also show no association between tricyclic antidepressant exposure and birth defects. The American Academy of Pediatrics classifies amitriptyline (Elavil) and imipramine (Tofranil) as drugs whose effects on the nursing infant are unknown but may be of concern (17). Yet, neither amitriptyline (Elavil) nor imipramine (Tofranil) nor their metabolites have been detected in the serum of breastfeeding infants whose mothers are taking these drugs (73, 74) . The selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are another frequently used class of antidepressants that includes sertraline (Zoloft), paroxetine (Paxil), and fluoxetine (Prozac). Multiple studies have evaluated fluoxetine (Prozac) and show no clear evidence that this agent causes birth defects. This includes a study of 128 women treated with fluoxetine (Prozac) versus other agents (75), the Michigan Medicaid data with more than 140 newborns exposed in utero, and more than 796 first-trimester exposures (76) . A larger long-term study compared 55 children whose mothers received fluoxetine (Prozac) during pregnancy with 80 children whose mothers took a tricyclic during pregnancy and 84 controls. No differences were found on global IQ, language development, or behavioral development in children followed to preschool (77). The SSRIs are also classified as drugs whose effects on the nursing infant are unknown but may be of concern by the American Academy of Pediatrics (17) . We would agree with a recent review (78) : \"In nursing women taking these drugs [antidepressants], breast-feeding is possible. The infant should be carefully monitored for any clinical side effects and, whenever observed, nursing should be discontinued.\" Bupropion (Wellbutrin), a combined SSRI and dopaminergic agent, has recently gained much attention because of its antidepressant effects and excellent side effect profile as well as its adjunctive role in smoking cessation. GlaxoSmithKline is currently gathering data in an international pregnancy registry (79) . A case report on breastfeeding while on bupropion (Wellbutrin) showed that, although bupropion (Wellbutrin) accumulates in human breast milk in concentrations much higher than maternal plasma, neither bupropion (Wellbutrin) nor its metabolites were detected in the infants' plasma (80) .",
