We could outline how a rudimental inference process could develop, by identifying the basic steps an automated agent should perform:0)Acquisition of an initial collection of observations (events) about the object of the analysis, together with a (qualitative) partial preference assessment;1)Detection of which is the most adequate (i.e., the most discriminant) uncertainty framework, through a \u201cpreference classification phase\u201d(cf. Sec. 3);2)Whenever new knowledge becomes available, refine agent's description of the real world by performing order extension (which substantially corresponds to knowledge inference. Cf. Sec. 4).The results of step 2) could be then exploited to guide further investigations on the real world, in order to obtain new information.

Next step in this research would consist in validating the proposed approach by means of a number of benchmarks aimed at testing our prototype on the ground of real applications. Results of this activity will help in consolidating the prototype. In this context, a further goal consists in completing our approach so as to handle comparative Probabilities too. Since no axiomatic characterization of comparative Probabilities is known (up to our knowledge), this aim should be achieved through integration with efficient linear optimization tools (such as the column generation techniques). More in general, we envisage the design of a full-blown automated system which integrates different (in someway complementary) techniques and methods for uncertainty management; comprehending mixed numerical/qualitative assessments and conditional frameworks.",
