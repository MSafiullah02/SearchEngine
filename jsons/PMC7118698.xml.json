Over one month, a total of 14 Cabin hospitals were opened in Wuhan, and more than 12,000 patients confirmed with COVID-19 were treated, most of whom were cured and discharged and only a few patients were transferred to designated hospitals for further treatment due to worsening symptoms. The Cabin hospitals played a crucial role in the prevention and treatment of COVID-19 patients, and quickly solved the problem of insufficient beds in existing hospitals. They greatly accelerated the admission of patients, and so reducing the conversion rate from mild and moderate cases of COVID-19, to severe and critical cases.",

The contaminated area should include areas where infected patients are treated, such as wards, treatment rooms, dirty rooms, places of activity, and patient admission and discharge rooms. The clean area should include dressing room, catering room, duty room and warehouse.

According to our successful experiences, a relatively suitable Cabin hospital should have about 1000 beds, the average area for each bed should be about 2x2 square meters, equipped with hand sanitizer at the end of each bed. The ratio of doctors and nurses could be approximately 1:3, and psychotherapists must be available to relieve psychological stresses. At the same time, some equipment management and logistics support staff are required. The average hospital stay was 10\u201314 days.",
