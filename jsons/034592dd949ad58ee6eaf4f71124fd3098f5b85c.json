Countries that started late have taken off exponentially, with hospitals overwhelmed.(7) Intensive care units have been completely inundated, with the chief bottleneck being availability of mechanical ventilators to tide critically ill patients over their intensive care stay.(7) For these reasons, global mortality may even greatly exceed that of so called Spanish Flu around the end of the First World War. (8,9) This paper will not discuss mitigation vs. suppression measures and the importance of hygiene etc, except to note that without active and very vigorous suppression, harrowing scenes will be re-enacted, as we witnessed after surges of cases in Northern Italy, and over the last few days, in New York.(9) The non-availability of ventilators to cope with extreme surges in case numbers may lead to triage situations with doctors having to choose who to ventilate and who to leave to die. (7) The results shown here suggest that the Maltese health services would find it extremely difficult to cope even with a 20% infection rate spread over a 14 week period. (10) These calculations assume that severe cases that would normally require relatively standard care (such as supplemental and non-invasive administration of oxygen, intravenous fluids, antibiotics for secondary infections etc) actually manage to access these therapies.
