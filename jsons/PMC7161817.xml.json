This is because lower respiratory tract infections, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), lung cancer, and tuberculosis belong to the ten most common causes of death worldwide.12, 13 A study analyzing the global burden of pneumonia for 2010 estimated about 120 million episodes occurring in children younger than 5 years. Of those, around 14 million progressed to severe pneumonia, causing about 1.3 million deaths.14 Furthermore, a study estimating the global burden of COPD for the same year identified more than 230 million cases among urban dwellers, and 153.7 million among rural dwellers worldwide, thereby providing an overview of the high prevalence of lung diseases in the population.15 Additionally, diseases such as asthma also affect millions of people worldwide and show likewise an increasing prevalence. Although mortality due to asthma has decreased over the last decades, no curative therapy is available and personal constraints in daily life activities persist.16, 17 Lung cancer is still the leading cause of cancer\u2010related deaths world\u2010wide.18 Models, which more accurately reflect human lung cancer could help aid in our understanding of the deranged signaling networks and help identify and validate new potential therapies. Taken together, there is a high global burden of lung diseases ranging from the economic to the individual level19 and a prerequisite to understand these diseases and to identify novel treatment options is the creation and validation of more complex models with multiple readout options that better mimic physiologic tissues and accurately reflect the clinical situation.",

While there is no doubt that these techniques and approaches have helped to make major contributions to the field. The scientific community is increasingly recognizing that these models and their outcomes suffer from serious limitations. It is estimated that over 80% of the potential therapeutics deemed to be safe and effective in animals fail in humans due to non\u2010rigorous study design, which raises ethical concerns with regard to the sacrificed animals as well as the patients, who receive ineffective agents with potential side\u2010effects.20 Moreover, lung anatomy, cellular composition, or molecular responses in man significantly differ from widely used animal models, such as rodents.21, 22, 23 For instance, chronic bronchitis and COPD are characterized both by excessive mucus production. However, in contrast to humans, bronchial glands of mice and rats anatomically localize only to the proximal trachea making it difficult to reproduce this particular disease aspect.24 In parallel to these challenges, current attempts to simulate the effect of cigarette smoke, air pollution, and lung cancer induction in animal models are limited in multiple ways by such basic animal\u2010human differences.22, 25, 26, 27, 28 Therefore, a vigorous debate has arisen in the last decade regarding the predictive value of mouse models in inflammatory diseases, across many diseases and organs.29, 30\n",

            "text": "In that context, another intriguing example for the need to use primary human lung samples are emerging zoonotic infections such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), or new influenza A virus (IAV) pandemics. Several animal models are naturally not permissive to these severe infections or need virus adaption to the animal host by serial passaging, thereby affecting viral pathogenicity. Animal models often need transgenic expression of human receptors (e.g., human angiotensin I converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) for SARS coronavirus (CoV), or human dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) for MERS CoV), or simply do not reflect the clinical course of the disease in humans.31, 32 Furthermore, an inherent characteristic of a zoonosis is its specific occurrence between a distinct animal species and the human host. Species specific factors, but mostly unknown factors from both, the pathogen and the host, determine the zoonotic axis. Therefore, the investigation of fundamental factors defining how a pathogen crosses the species barrier must include material and infection models from these \u201czoonotic partner species\u201d itself, meaning in the local context such as the human lung.33 Although such complex human lung tissue models suffer from physiological limitations, it is obviously purposeful to make efforts toward analyzing the fundamentals of lung biology in the original tissue of interest. This tissue can be used to mimic the various diseases and even to elaborately analyze diseased tissue biopsies, which can serve as models themselves. In addition, the currently established human in vitro models require further improvement. For example, culture medium\u2010submerged bronchial lung epithelia cells lack cilia and hardly form the tight junctions typically expressed in vivo and observed in air\u2013liquid interface cultures.34 There is thus a need to recapitulate the complex 3D structure and matrix of the lung tissue with a suitable cell mixture35 to establish an appropriate intercellular network.36 Besides those integrated models, human clonal or primary cells are useful for dissecting fundamental aspects of the biology of a single lung cell population in vitro, which is indispensable to complement the understanding of species specific signaling pathways.",

Over the last decades, tissue engineering approaches have made tremendous progress. Several in vitro models for studying inhalation toxicity or diseases have been established, which aim to improve our understanding of (patho\u2010)physiological processes and to provide novel and more reliant experimental systems for pharmacological and toxicological studies. Currently, in vitro lung models of all important segments of the respiratory system are available, starting from the nasal cavity and trachea down to the proximal and distal airways.37 Cell culture models of human lung epithelium are based either on primary cells including normal human (trachea) bronchial epithelial cells (NH(T)BEC)), AEC, induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) derived epithelial cells,38, 39 or are generated using cell lines. iPSC derived epithelial cell organoids from patients with lung diseases, such as cystic fibrosis, or cells manipulated in vitro through gene editing have been recently shown to recapitulate functions known to be deranged in human lung disease. iPSC derived lung bud organoids have also been recently used for studying respiratory syncytial viral infection.39 These models thus provide an opportunity to identify new treatments or to further understand the underlying biology of human disease. The most commonly used lung epithelial cell lines are Calu\u20103, H441, 16HBE14o\u2010, and A549. These cell lines offer several advantages over primary cells such as almost unlimited cell source and passaging. However, they suffer from distinct limitations such as the lack of mucus production for 16HBE14o\u2010or absent tight junction formation for A549.40 To induce cell differentiation, cells are typically cultured on biocompatible scaffolds or matrices to mimic the natural environment. The matrices can consist of natural (e.g., collagen, gelatin, elastin, alginate, silk, Matrigel\u00ae) or synthetic compounds (e.g., polyglycolic acid, polylactic acid, polyethylene glycol, polyvinyl alcohol, polyacrylic acid).41 An important step for improving the physiological relevance of these models is the culture of lung epithelial cells at the air\u2013liquid\u2010interface (ALI), since increased oxygen and air exposure play crucial roles for the development of a well\u2010differentiated barrier.42 Bronchial epithelial cells cultured under ALI conditions develop a three\u2010dimensional, multi\u2010cellular epithelium comprised of basal cells as well as ciliated surface cells and goblet cells, whereas submerged cultures express substantially fewer ciliated cells.43 Additionally, ALI cultures offer the opportunity for direct application of aerosols or solid particles onto semi\u2010dry cell surfaces, more closely resemble the in vivo situation and can be kept in culture for several month.44\n",

            "text": "In addition to the use of primary and immortalized cells for modeling normal cell biology, tumor models using human cells have become important tools for cancer research. Their complexity is dependent on the objectives and research questions. Tumor models have been developed to provide insight into, e.g., tumor growth, invasion, matrix remodeling, or drug delivery. Many lung tumor studies use spheroid models for therapeutic screening where clusters of cells undergo self\u2010assembly to form viable, 3D tumor\u2010like structures. Spheroids can be generated using low attachment U\u2010bottom plates,45 extracellular matrices (MatrigelTM),46 rotatory cell culture systems or the hanging drop method.47 Hanging drops can be used to produce 3D mono\u2010 and co\u2010culture spheroids for a better reflection of in vivo conditions of cancer cells to investigate, e.g., tumor\u2010stroma interactions.48 The culture time depends on the cell type and the experimental question. Small spheroids have been used for drug testing and large to recapitulate oxygen gradients with hypoxic regions or proliferation gradients. More complex models of lung cancer and tumors have been established to serve as tools to identify new drug targets. Three\u2010dimensional decellularized tissue matrix derived from rodent lungs have been recellularized with human lung cancer cell lines to provide a perfusable tumor model.49 Alternatively, a 3D collagen gel based model has been described which contains human lung adenocarcinoma cells, human lung fibroblast cells, and macrophages.50\n",

These models are used for a wide range of applications including safety and risk assessment and research on, e.g., new anti\u2010viral compounds, drug delivery systems, or common lung diseases such as inflammation and fibrosis. EpiAirway\u00ae (MatTek Corp., MA, USA) and MucilAir\u2122 (Epithelix S\u00e0rl, Suisse) are composed of normal NHTB/BEC from non\u2010smokers, but epithelium mimicking several pathologies like asthma, COPD, or cystic fibrosis can also be obtained. OncoCilAir\u2122 (Epithelix S\u00e0rl, Suisse) is a 3D human lung cancer model combining functional reconstituted human airway epithelium, human lung fibroblasts, and lung adenocarcinoma cells which can be used for drug efficacy testing, toxicity effects, analyzing off\u2010target\u2010effects, and tumor recurrence. A major advantage of these models is their ability to be cultured for long\u2010term. For example, OncoCilAir\u2122 and EpiAirway\u00ae have a useful lifetime for up to 3 months, whereas MucilAir\u2122 can be cultivated up to 12 months, allowing long\u2010term and repeat toxicity and efficacy studies. The main disadvantages of commercial models are the lack of complexity and ability to be customized for particular applications. In this regard, in\u2010house models offer more flexibility, particularly with regard to cell selection or cell manipulation like genetic modifications via gene knockdown or knockout.53 Moreover, endothelial cells can be implemented to mimic the alveolar\u2010capillary barrier54, 55 or the models can be co\u2010cultured with dendritic cells and/or macrophages to generate immunocompetent tissues allowing more detailed studies of lung (patho\u2010)physiology.35, 56, 57 The implementation of immune cells, however, is a challenging approach and requires extensive research efforts to develop reliable and predictive models closely resembling the in vivo situation.",

Benam et al.58 presented a system in which human lung bronchial epithelial cells (from healthy individuals or asthma and COPD patients), differentiated in an ALI culture and grown on an extracellular matrix (ECM) coated dimethylsiloxane membrane, were integrated in a microfluidic system with cultured human endothelial cells on the lower side. The endothelial channel is perfused by culture medium. The culture of patient\u2010derived airway cells in combination with the application of stimulating agents via the airflow or the perfusion channel (so via the vascular route) allowed for a great variety of functional studies including, e.g., the recruitment of immune cells from the bloodstream into the airways. The same group used this experimental setup to model the alveolar region of the lung.59, 60, 61 By integrating a flexible membrane and a two side hollow chamber they induce stretching of both the epithelial cells grown on the upper side and the endothelial cells grown on the bottom side of the membrane, thereby simulating breathing motions of the lung. Notably, in this model, human alveolar cells were exposed to an airstream and thus cultured in ALI conditions (alias \u201clung\u2010on\u2010chip\u201d). These systems are now commercialized (Emulate, Inc., Boston, MA, USA) and thus may be available in the future for a range of applications. To this end, varieties of human 3D models of different complexity based on in vitro culture of lung cells are now available.",

Cells seeded onto COPD scaffolds were unable to survive as long as they did on scaffolds derived from normal patients.96 These cells were all grown under conditions known to stimulate proliferation in two dimensions on tissue culture plastic. This indicates that either the matrix itself or a component in the matrix/scaffold suppressed proliferation or enhanced cell death. In both instances, the findings in vitro match known hallmarks of human disease. However, it is important to note that mass spectrometry proteomics consistently detects a large number of non\u2010ECM components in acellular human lung scaffolds from both normal and diseased origin, many of which are growth factors known to be involved in disease onset and pathogenesis.95 Therefore, acellular scaffolds and results from these experiments should not only be viewed as models of cell\u2010ECM interactions but should be interpreted as being models of the extracellular environment of normal or diseased lungs, including matrix sequestered growth factors. Their ability to recapitulate the heterogeneity of human disease in an in vivo like environment makes acellular human lung scaffolds a powerful in vitro tool for studying human disease.",

One key method is therefore the further development of high\u2010end live tissue microscopy techniques. Unfortunately, classical 2\u2010photon microscopy has no significant advantage in living lung tissues compared to confocal imaging.146 This is due to the strong light scattering of the chambered alveolar system, which limits both techniques. Next, lung tissue has very strong auto\u2010fluorescence hampering specific fluorescence signal separation. Therefore, such methods must be combined with spectral microscopy,147 and developed further with the fast (lattice) light sheet approach.148, 149 To show the advantage of spectral imaging we demonstrate two examples, where we have illustrated that spectral microscopy and linear unmixing provides the possibility to overcome the high auto\u2010fluorescence of the tissue and allows even for subcellular resolution of the complex cellular composition of the human alveolus. This kind of imaging techniques will drastically improve the methodological potential to visualize different cellular and structural aspects in living (lung) tissue and 3D models in general (Figure 1). Innovative live cell labeling combined with the use of viral transduction systems for gene editing will allow for mechanistic analysis of such lung tissue models in the future.150 The rapid development of stem cell based technologies151, 152, 153; decellularization procedures and tissue printing154, 155 make the building of human\u2010lung related tissue pieces for use in basic science more realistic within the next years.",
