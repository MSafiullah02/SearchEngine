Present estimates indicate that each year, seasonal influenza affects 5\u201310% of the world's population, resulting in 3\u20135 million cases of severe illness and between 250 000 to 500 000 deaths [2]. In addition to seasonal outbreaks, influenza pandemics sporadically emerge, causing markedly higher mortality. In 1918, the worst pandemic in recorded history caused more than 50 million deaths worldwide [3]. Since then, three other pandemics have occurred: first in 1957, then again in 1968 and finally in 2009 [4]. Currently, there are major concerns surrounding the emergence of the new highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) viruses of H5N1, H7N9, H10N8, or the more recent H5N8\u2014the only HPAI strain to cross from Eurasia to America [5], [6], [7], [8], [9].",

Histopathologic studies of influenza autopsies from 1918 outline the key changes characteristic of severe IAV viral pneumonia. These include \u201c\u2026 varying degrees of acute intra-alveolar edema and/or hemorrhage, and diffuse alveolar damage in addition to necrotizing bronchitis and bronchiolitis\u201d [11]. Similarly, in the recent 2009 H1N1 outbreak, viral antigen could be found in the alveolar space, suggesting pandemic strains of IAV have the capacity to infect distal areas of the lung and directly cause alveolar damage. These occurrences collectively predispose to a clinical condition termed acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which may occur as a complication of primary viral pneumonia [12]. ARDS is precipitated by cell death among the epithelial\u2013endothelial barrier (EEB) of the distal lung, barrier rupture, fluid leakage into the alveolar lumen and respiratory insufficiency. Hence, understanding and disrupting the strategies employed by the virus to damage the lower airways is critical in preserving pulmonary architecture.",

The identification of the infective target cells of severe pulmonary viruses within the alveolus is critical in evaluating the potential effects of cell damage on lung function. For example, ex vivo infection of human lungs with Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV)\u2014a recent zoonotic virus with a fatality rate of 35\u201350% in humans\u2014showed that AEC-I, AEC-II and endothelial cells can all be infected and killed [13], [14], [15]. In addition, while MERS-CoV productively replicates in human macrophages and T lymphocytes, it is also cytotoxic in these cells [16], [17]. Interestingly, the tropism of the virus appears to have a significant impact on severity of disease. For instance, in comparison to MERS-CoV that infects both structural cells and leukocytes and causes high mortality, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV only infects structural cells, causing less mortality [17]. In IAV infection, a number of reports identify AEC-II as the primary replicative niche in the human lung for highly pathogenic strains, while low-pathogenicity strains fail to penetrate the lower airways [18], [19], [20], [21], [22]. HPAI also infects human endothelial cells in vitro and some evidence suggests that infection of the endothelium may occur in vivo\n[23], [24]. In addition, IAV antigens are found in human AM\u03c6 and the virus can productively infect and kill human macrophages [18], [19], [10], [23], [21], [25], [26], [27]. Thus, similar to the highly pathogenic MERS-CoV, highly virulent IAV shows tropism for both human alveolar structural cells and leukocytes, highlighting the severity of pandemic strains.",

Studies examining how AM\u03c6 are altered following pulmonary viral infection suggest that the loss of EEB integrity, reduction in regulatory mediators and activation of multiple pattern-recognition receptors (PRR) lead to these cells becoming pro-inflammatory, rather than regulatory [28]. Upon infection with IAV, AM\u03c6 initiate the immune response by producing chemokines and cytokines, including type I interferons (IFN-I; primarily composed of IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2), as well as instructing adaptive immune responses [25], [29]. If adequately regulated, these responses lead to effective immunity, clearance of the virus with minimal immunopathology and return to pulmonary homeostasis. If dysregulated, however, these responses can have dramatically deleterious effects, marked by impaired viral clearance, increased immunopathology and enhanced susceptibility to infection. Thus, pulmonary immune responses must be tightly regulated to effectively eliminate viruses that reach the distal airways, while minimizing immunopathology in order to maintain optimal gas exchange [29].",

            "text": "The death of host cells as a result of infection has been recognized for over a century and it is now understood that pathogen-induced cell death may occur through a variety of complex mechanisms. Initially, cell death was discussed in dichotomy as either: (1) apoptosis, considered an active\u2014or programmed\u2014process that preserves the plasma membrane and leads to the deletion of cells with little tissue disruption and no inflammation; or (2) necrosis, a passive form of cell death leading to complete disruption of the plasma membrane and spillage of cellular contents, causing inflammation and tissue damage [30]. However, this simplification of the cell death program has altered considerably over the last couple of decades. There are now several distinct forms of programmed cell death that have been described in addition to apoptosis, including pyroptosis, paraptosis and necroptosis [31]. Interestingly, some of these cell death modalities have been observed in autopsies of IAV-infected humans, particularly HPAI cases [11], [32]; yet, the consequences of these cell death programs on host immunity and the pathogenesis of IAV are not fully understood. Therefore, a more complete characterization of the forms of cell death occurring in IAV infected lungs may define why certain cell types are more, or less, susceptible to IAV-induced cell death and how this impacts viral propagation. Furthermore, different forms of cell death may have distinct consequences on the virulence of IAV strains by differentially modulating the immune response. This suggests that regulated modulation of cell death programs during IAV infection may be an appealing target for anti-IAV therapies.",

Proceeding in a non-inflammatory manner, apoptosis likely evolved to meet the growing demand to remove aging or damaged cells from the body as more complex and multicellular organisms appeared and, as a result, the apoptotic machinery remains evolutionarily conserved. Indeed, at homeostasis in an adult human, it is estimated that between 100 and 200 billion cells are being cleared daily via apoptosis [39]. This number can then augment dramatically in developmental stages and aging. Thus, the physiological demand for cellular turnover in a non-inflammatory manner is essential to maintain homeostasis.",

Ultimately, these compartments bleb off in the form of apoptotic bodies, which are phagocytosed and degraded by macrophages and other phagocytic cells in a process known as efferocytosis [39]. Importantly, the cell membrane of apoptotic cells remains intact throughout and the cell shrinks rather than ruptures, as appearing in necrotic forms of cell death. Thus in apoptotic cells, there is no leakage of cytosolic contents to initiate an inflammatory response [33]. There are two major pathways that lead to apoptosis: intrinsic and extrinsic, both of which primarily converge on a family of proteins called caspases that cleave cellular substrates and lead to the morphological signature of apoptosis [40]. Intrinsic apoptosis is initiated by the mitochondrion in response to internal cellular stress and involves activation of caspase 9 by cytochrome c. Extrinsic apoptosis, on the other hand, is dependent upon death ligands of the TNF superfamily like TRAIL or FasL binding their cognate cell surface receptors and the subsequent activation of caspase 8 [41], [42].",

For example, virulent Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) contains an anti-apoptotic gene (nuoG) that diminishes both innate and adaptive immunity to promote the bacterial growth [43]. In contrast to Mtb, apoptosis induced by Listeria monocytogenes is an immune evasion strategy, allowing the bacteria to disseminate [44]. Thus, it appears that apoptosis can be both protective and detrimental to the host depending on the pathogen. Interestingly, both extrinsic and intrinsic pathways of apoptosis were shown to be activated in influenza-infected cells [45]. This observation is well established, being described in human autopsies for almost a century, beginning with the 1918 pandemic, where pronounced epithelial desquamation, hyalination and sloughing were noted [37]. Experimentally, apoptosis of IAV-infected epithelial cells was shown to be dependent upon viral replication, as an inactivated virus failed to induce apoptosis in mice [46] and human cells [47]. Moreover, the magnitude of epithelial cell apoptosis was positively associated with IAV strain pathogenicity in vivo\n[32], [23], [48] and in vitro\n[38], [49] in both mice and humans. However, whether apoptosis promotes host resistance or IAV dissemination remains to be determined.",

            "text": "Logically, apoptosis of epithelial cells could represent a resistance strategy to IAV, as it eliminates the intracellular niche required for viral replication. Support for the protective capacity of apoptosis is that critical host antiviral factors actively induce epithelial cell apoptosis. Upon viral infection, IFN-I (IFN-\u03b2) is rapidly produced, following recognition of the viral genome by pattern-recognition receptors (PRR). In IAV infection, RNA sensing is predominantly mediated by the cytosolic retinoic acid-inducible gene (RIG-I), which interacts with the mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (MAVS) at the mitochondrial outer-membrane to initiate IFN-I production mainly via the transcription factor interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) (reviewed in Ref. [50]). IFN-I then signals through a heterodimeric receptor complex of IFN\u03b1R1 and 2, leading to sustained IFN-I (largely IFN-\u03b1) production and an upregulation of a large subset of genes, together termed interferon stimulated genes (ISGs). ISGs then serve to halt viral replication through both direct or indirect mechanisms. Interestingly, both IFN-I and ISGs have been shown to induce apoptosis. Following IAV infection, IFN-I signaling activates caspase-dependent apoptosis in AEC-II cells [51], and the pharmacological inhibition of these caspases blocks apoptosis and enhances viral replication. Additionally, several classical apoptosis proteins, including caspase 8 and TRAIL, are ISGS upregulated by IFN-I signaling. Thus, IAV sensing causes the release of IFN-I that induces epithelial cell apoptosis directly through caspase activation downstream of the IFN\u03b1R1/2 complex, and indirectly by promoting the transcription of pro-apoptotic ISGs.",

Immediately upon infection, it is beneficial for IAV to block epithelial cell apoptosis to avoid destroying its replicative niche and this is primarily mediated by viral NS1. Early blockage of apoptosis by IAV is counteracted by host mechanisms, such as IFN-I signaling, to induce apoptosis and resist viral replication [69]. Yet, following initial replication cycles, at later time points, IAV must activate apoptotic pathways to generate new infectious virions, promote budding at the cell surface and facilitate subsequent rounds of infection in neighboring cells. Thus, pharmacological inhibition of apoptosis in humans during the later stages of infection may offer appealing therapeutic avenues, either by blocking pro-apoptotic pathways [65] or enhancing anti-apoptotic proteins [64]. Interestingly, neutralization of pro-apoptotic TRAIL or Fas signaling post-IAV infection in AEC-II cells decreased IAV load [70]. Similarly, mice treated with decoy Fas in vivo to block FasL signaling were protected from lethal IAV infection, when compared to untreated mice [71].",

Yet, the impact of IAV-induced epithelial cell necrosis on the host immune response, and the factors\u2014viral or host-derived\u2014involved in this process are just beginning to become known. Canonically, necrosis was considered a passive form of cell death associated with increased injury or disease severity. However, it is now well established that many forms of necrosis are, in fact, programmed. Necrotic cell death is delineated from apoptosis by a disruption of the cell membrane and spilling out of cytosolic contents that act as danger-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs). These DAMPs are sensed by neighboring cells, resulting in a robust inflammatory response [72], [73], thus, generating a potential positive feedback loop of tissue damage and immunopathology. The observation that HPAI [11] and pandemic H1N1 often induce necrosis in epithelial cells, while seasonal H3N2 appears only to cause it in immune compromised hosts [48], may at least partly explain the association between severity of disease and necrosis of the epithelium. Moreover, other strains of highly pathogenic viruses such as dengue virus [74] or MERS-CoV [75] appear to induce considerable necrosis in epithelial cells to promote viral replication and propagation, while less virulent viruses like rhinovirus, or SARS-CoV induce limited or no necrosis [75], [76]. In vitro, H1N1 IAV induces necrosis in human lung bronchiolar epithelial cells, coupled with massive release of proinflammatory cytokines and neutrophil chemoattractant CXCL8, which is highly suggestive of a link between necrosis of the epithelium and ARDS [77]. Collectively, these observations promote the notion that epithelial cell necrosis is detrimental to the host and is consequential of severe infection.",

Typically, RIPK1 and RIPK3 are cleaved by caspase-8, causing their inactivation and leading to extrinsic apoptosis. However, when caspase-8 activity is compromised, the necrosome is activated to induce necroptosis. Known mediators downstream of the necrosome include mixed lineage kinase domain like pseudokinase (MLKL). MLKL is a substrate for RIPK3 and induces necroptosis by a combination of the assembly of a pore-forming complex at the plasma membrane, or as a platform for Ca2+-mediated necrosis [78].

Moreover, herpes simplex viruses (HSV-1/2) and murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) encode inhibitors of necroptosis, UL39 and M45 respectively, suggesting that viruses may block necroptosis as part of their pathogenesis [82], [83]. Although no IAV inhibitors of necroptosis have yet been identified; most recently, RIPK3-dependent necroptosis of murine fibroblasts and alveolar epithelial cells was demonstrated to be critical in promoting IAV clearance from the lungs and, as a result, RIPK3-deficient mice were highly susceptible to IAV infection coupled with enhanced viral loads [84].

Pulmonary fibroblasts are the most substantial subset of structural cells in the lung interstitium, playing a significant role in the repair process to injurious exposure and pulmonary inflammatory disorders, such as asthma and COPD [88]. Fibroblasts are used extensively in IAV studies as a model of lung structural cells. As in epithelial cells, fibroblasts are sensitive to both IAV-induced apoptosis [58] and necroptosis [84]\nin vitro. However, the contribution of fibroblasts in immunity to IAV infection is not well understood. Whether fibroblasts are a target for IAV infection in vivo and/or whether their response is analogous to, or completely independent of, epithelial cells, requires further investigation. Understanding the role of fibroblasts in the pathogenesis of IAV may provide additional targeted therapy against IAV infection.",

            "text": "Similarly, endothelial cells represent a substantial compartment of the lung and in vitro infection of human endothelial cells led to productive IAV replication and increased vascular leak, mediated by apoptosis [89], particularly upon infection with HPAI (e.g. H5N1) [90]. HPAI has been shown to disseminate from the lung systemically upon infection in mice [91]. This has equally been observed in humans, where viral RNA was found in multiple organs, including the brain and placenta, of fatal cases of H5N1 [92], [93]. The ability of HPAI viruses to disseminate to other tissues is predominately mediated by changes to the cleavage sites of the viral HA protein, which is essential for viral entry into cells. In the case of low virulence seasonal strains of IAV, HA cleavage occurs at a single basic arginine by trypsin-like proteases found exclusively in cells of the respiratory tree and gastrointestinal tract. On the other hand, HPAI HA proteins contain polybasic cleavage sites that permit cleavage by furin proteases that are ubiquitously expressed. Thus, this allows HPAI strains to disseminate and cause systemic infection [94]. Additionally, pandemic and highly virulent strains of the virus, including HPAI and the 1918 H1N1 strain, are known to completely exhaust the replicative niche of epithelial cells of the lung over the course of infection as a by-product of overly exuberant replication and failure of immune response to control viral propagation. Thus, it is appealing to associate the infection of endothelial cells by HPAI viruses with subsequent systemic dissemination, made possible by the polybasic cleavage sites. However, this is complicated by the fact that no virus was found in endothelial cells of fatal cases of H5N1 infection [93], yet virus was found in hyaline membranes and endothelial cells of fatal cases of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, where dissemination to other organs was not noted [23]. As there is no known evolutionary advantage for IAV to disseminate to other organs, a greater level of study is required to confirm what role infection of endothelial cells in humans plays and whether endothelial cell death is a pro-host or pro-pathogen strategy.",

While the induction of apoptosis by viral proteins has been studied extensively in structural cells, fewer studies have investigated it in M\u03c6 [114], [115], [112], [116], [117]. Interestingly, influenza virus contains an essential gene, polymerase basic protein 1-frame 2 (PB1-F2, a product of an alternate reading frame of the PB1 gene), which increases apoptosis-mediated pathogenicity in IAV [118]. Functionally, PB1-F2 has been shown to be the main inducer of apoptosis in monocytes/M\u03c6, but not epithelial cells [116], [112]. The pro-apoptotic effect of PB1-F2 is elicited by its translocation to the mitochondrion [119]. In mitochondria, PB1-F2 interacts with components of the permeability transition pore complex (PTPC) ANT3 and VDAC1 [120] to disrupt the mitochondrial inner membrane potential, followed by cytochrome c release and the induction of apoptosis, which subdues the M\u03c6 antiviral capacity and promotes host susceptibility [116].",

Interestingly, IAV-infected M\u03c6 are the main source of the key antiviral cytokine: IFN-I [25], [122], [116] and can induce M\u03c6 cell death via the upregulation of ISGs. Moreover, infection of human M\u03c6 with HPAI strains induces TRAIL release to trigger the apoptotic cascade [123], [27]. Equally, upregulation of Fas and secretion of FasL at later time points post-infection have been shown to induce apoptosis selectively in recruited M\u03c6 [115], [121], a process which is thought to contribute to immune contraction and the return to homeostasis. Of note, although TNF has been reported to induce apoptosis in IAV-infected epithelial cells, it does not appear to mediate M\u03c6 apoptosis [45]. Thus, during IAV infection, activation or inhibition of apoptotic pathways are cell-type specific and can either promote or prevent IAV pathogenesis. Therefore, this complex network certainly needs to be interrogated more intensely.",

Nonetheless, much of the literature suggests a host-detrimental effect of M\u03c6 apoptosis. For instance, HPAI and pandemic H1N1 influenza viruses hijack innate antiviral responses by inducing apoptosis in M\u03c6 to decrease M\u03c6-antiviral cytokines (primarily IFN-I) and promote viral replication [27], [123], [124]. Considering residential AM\u03c6 are the first immune cells encountered by the influenza virus and are critical in mounting an immune response, it is not surprising that IAV efficiently infects and kills AM\u03c6 to suppress their antiviral responses. Thus, shortly after severe IAV infection, the original pool of resident AM\u03c6 decreases, resulting in enhanced viral replication [110], [105]. Similarly, limiting AM\u03c6 cell death through the exogenous administration or overexpression of GM-CSF\u2014the critical growth and maintenance factor for AM\u03c6\u2014is protective, leading to lowered pulmonary viral load, decreased immunopathology and increased survival of mice after IAV infection [125], [109]. In addition to inhibiting the early antiviral responses, IAV-induced M\u03c6 apoptosis might skew the balance from a protective to pathological immune response. During IAV infection, it has been shown that mice lacking type I IFN signaling die from an uncontrolled inflammatory response, as IFN-I signaling was essential to induce anti-inflammatory IL-10 production by \u201cregulatory\u201d M\u03c6 [126]\u2014a subset of M\u03c6 known to be more susceptible to IAV-induced apoptosis [113].",

Expression of the 1918 PB1-F2 protein in a mouse-adapted H1N1 strain resulted in early increased viral titers and death of infected M\u03c6 [127]. To prevent PB1-F2-induced early M\u03c6 apoptosis, we have recently shown that the host mitochondrial NLR-member NLRX1 directly interacts with PB1-F2 within mitochondria to disarm its apoptotic function. In IAV-infected Nlrx1\n\u2212/\u2212 mice, or M\u03c6 in vitro, higher levels of apoptosis were observed compared to WT M\u03c6. This was associated with reduced production of IFN-I and increased viral loads in vitro and in vivo\n[116]. Thus, by inducing M\u03c6 cell death, IAV hijacks the host's key antiviral responses, resulting in both enhanced IAV replication/dissemination and impairment of the anti-inflammatory response, which drives immunopathology and potentially ARDS (Fig. 2\n).",

Indeed, early apoptosis of HPAI-infected porcine AM\u03c6 correlated to decreased viral replication and magnitude of the inflammatory response [112]. Aside from viral proteins, our laboratory recently demonstrated that IAV induces production of the host eicosanoid prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) to directly inhibit early production of IFN-I, which increased viral loads through reduced M\u03c6 apoptosis. Thus, whether apoptosis is protective or pathological seems, again, to be connected to the kinetics of its induction. Early post-infection, M\u03c6 viability is essential to promote antiviral immunity and this is countered by IAV proteins such as PB1-F2. Later, however, M\u03c6 apoptosis becomes protective, as the apoptotic vesicles stimulate adaptive immunity by promoting cross-presentation [25].",

However, IAV-induced macrophage necrosis has been poorly studied in vivo and most of our knowledge is confined to in vitro observation. At low multiplicities of infection (MOI), necrosis is not substantially induced in M\u03c6 [116], [26], [129]. In addition, we and others have recently shown that IAV does not induce RIPK3-mediated necroptosis in M\u03c6, both in vivo and in vitro, but, rather, RIPK3 plays a crucial role in the production of IL-1\u03b2 [129] and IFN-I [130] and, as a result, mice deficient in RIPK3 are extremely susceptible to IAV infection. However, following severe infection with a high viral titer, IAV induces necroptosis through the RIPK1\u2013RIPK3\u2013Caspase 8 complex in vitro\n[86], suggesting a potential role for RIPK3-mediated necroptosis in depletion of M\u03c6 during infection with highly virulent strains. Synergy between these two observations may come from the pleiotropic function of IFN-I, which has been also shown to induce M\u03c6 necroptosis in vitro or in vivo during bacterial infections [131], [132], [133]. Thus, it can be envisioned that dysregulated RIPK3-mediated IFN-I production in severe infection may, in fact, become detrimental to the host by inducing necroptosis of pulmonary M\u03c6, suggesting a threshold for protective IFN-I production and deleterious immunopathology induced by M\u03c6 necroptosis. Of note, pathways known to induce IFN-I in response to IAV and other viruses, such as TLR3 [134], PKR [132] and DNA-dependent activator of IFN-regulatory factors (DAI) [135] have also been shown to trigger necroptosis, advocating a potential link between type I IFN production and necroptosis induction.",

            "text": "The lung represents a diverse microenvironment filled with numerous cell\u2013cell interactions with high turnover under homeostatic and pathological conditions. In particular, epithelial cells of the EBB and AM\u03c6 exist in close proximity and are known to regulate each other's functions at homeostasis and upon infection. Over the last ten years, we have gained appreciable knowledge of how pulmonary macrophages induce apoptosis in infected epithelial cells. In 2008, Herold et al. showed for the first time that secretion of TRAIL by M\u03c6 induced apoptosis of AEC and contributed to lung injury during IAV infection [137]. Further investigation also revealed that secretion of IFN-I, and specifically IFN-\u03b2, by infected AM\u03c6 was responsible for autocrine TRAIL expression and epithelium injury [138]. Most importantly, an upregulation of TRAIL expression and secretion was observed in AM\u03c6 from pandemic H1N1-infected individuals [138]. In addition to potentiating lung injury, this could potentially lead to viral dissemination by promoting efferocytosis. Efferocytosis is the phagocytosis of apoptotic bodies released from dying cells by neighboring M\u03c6 [139]. Recently, annexin A1, a key protein involved in efferocytosis [140], [141], [148], was shown to facilitate IAV replication and dissemination in vivo\n[68]. Interestingly, Tcherniuk et al. showed that newly formed viral particles contained annexin A1 on their membranes, increasing their infectivity and viral replication through enhanced uptake [142]. In addition, activation of formyl peptide receptor 2/lipoxin A4 receptor (FPR2/ALX) via annexin A1, increased pulmonary viral load and susceptibility to infection [142]. Hence, one can envision a model wherein the induction of epithelial cell apoptosis by AM\u03c6-derived IFN-I leads to the presence of annexin A1-expressing viral particles on the surface of infected cells. These new viral particles are, in turn, recognized and taken up by bystander M\u03c6, infecting them and preventing their antiviral responses. This leads to increased viral replication that subsequently enhances the magnitude of the immune response\u2014thus, continuing this vicious cycle of lung injury/reinfection. This may potentially explain how HPAI and pandemic H1N1 viruses strip the pulmonary epithelium and leave the host leukopenic, as seen in fatal cases. Therefore, discovery of factors that can mitigate this pathological cycle would be of clinical significance in combatting highly pathogenic strains of IAV.",

To prevent infection, vaccination strategies are deployed worldwide. However, the protection conferred by vaccination is highly variable, due to the ability of the virus to shift antigens, leading to vaccine mismatch and a decrease in efficacy. Antiviral therapies, like neuraminidase inhibitors (i.e. Oseltamivir) that block viral egress to potentially ameliorate disease are currently in use. Despite considerable efficacy in murine models in lowering viral titers and improving disease outcome [143], [144], its protective effect in humans is controversial and limited benefit has been shown in the majority of patients [145], [146]. Additionally, highly resistant strains of IAV to Oseltamivir have recently emerged that raises growing concern [147]. Thus, these factors collectively suggest that the dogma of only targeting the virus and not the host\u2019s immune response in the generation of anti-IAV drugs needs to be revisited.",

First, anti-TRAIL treatments selectively attenuated epithelial cells apoptosis, lung injury and increased survival of mice after IAV infection. Secondly, we recently demonstrated that targeted inhibition of mPGES-1, the key enzyme in PGE2 production, selectively regulated pulmonary M\u03c6 apoptosis to boost antiviral and immunoregulatory properties. Importantly, mPGES-1 inhibition was effective even after three days of IAV-infection, coinciding with the onset of symptoms in humans. In line with this, a recent study by Hung et al. showed a reduction in viral titers, hospital stay and mortality when individuals infected with H3N2 IAV were given a combinatory therapy of Clarithromycin (antibiotic) \u2013Naproxen (COX inhibitor) \u2013 Oseltamivir (neuraminidase inhibitor) [147], compared to Oseltamivir treatment alone, highlighting the importance of combining immunomodulatory therapies and those directly targeting the pathogen.",

Recently, the antiviral capabilities of RIPK3 have been shown to be at least twofold, by both inducing epithelial cell necroptosis and promoting IFN-I responses from pulmonary M\u03c6 to potentiate survival to lethal IAV infection. Therefore, agonists of RIPK3 may promote viral clearance via both epithelial cells and macrophages and ultimately confer survival to severe disease. This shows that combining treatments that differentially target structural cell and pulmonary M\u03c6 can significantly improve the outcome of influenza virus infection.",

The knowledge gained from the studies of cell death programs in epithelial cells and macrophages during IAV infection provide significantly better understanding of host mechanisms involved in protective or pathological immunity to IAV infection. However, further investigation is still required to identify the kinetics of cell death during influenza infection, which appears to be critical in regulating antiviral and anti-inflammatory responses. In addition, most of our knowledge comes from in vitro experiments and thus a need for greater tools to investigate cell death in vivo and discovery of new cellular markers of the various cell death programs will be required for developing a novel therapy in influenza virus infection. .",

Following IAV infection, the viral protein NS1 inhibits apoptosis by activating the PI3K/Akt pro-survival pathway, therefore leading to increased viral replication. Later, viral proteins, predominantly NP, activate caspase signaling to facilitate viral protein packaging and virion production, leading to viral egress and consequentially apoptosis. Unknown viral factors induce necrosis through unelucidated mechanisms, causing enhanced inflammation. Finally, IAV-infected epithelial cells undergo necroptosis, a programmed form of necrosis involving the proteins RIPK3 and MLKL. By eliminating the natural replicative niche of the virus, necroptosis helps limit viral replication.

We envision that the low levels of mitochondrial NLRX1 protein upon infection leads to early apoptosis and reduced production of type I IFN in alveolar macrophages. However, during the late phase of infection, high levels of mitochondrial NLRX1 protein disarm the pro-apoptotic function of PB1-F2 that leads to increased macrophage survival as well as IFN-I production. The increased levels of IFN-I in the alveolar space induce apoptosis in IAV-infected epithelial cells (Epith) and, thus, disrupt the niche for viral replication.",
