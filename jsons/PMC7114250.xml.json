            "text": "Researchers in veterinary epidemiology are often interested in modelling hierarchical data with a time-to-event response variable. Hierarchical time-to-event models, also referred to as hierarchical survival or frailty models, can be used with nested data structures (e.g. animals nested within herds and herds located in different ecological regions) commonly found in veterinary science. One potential limitation of nested frailty models typically used for hierarchical survival data, however, is that they are designed to be used with perfectly hierarchical survival data, but in reality not all data structures found in the veterinary sciences are perfectly hierarchical. If in the previous example (some) herds are serviced by multiple veterinary clinics, an imperfect hierarchical data structure is present where the lower level units (herds) are members of multiple higher level units (clinics) simultaneously. This structure is called a multiple membership data structure (Browne et al., 2001). In addition, different classifications may not be hierarchically nested in each other; in our example, herds serviced by a given clinic could be located in different ecological regions. This would mean that clinics are not hierarchically nested within regions, and the two factors should instead be viewed as (partially) cross-classified. In summary, the structure described corresponds to a 3-level cross-classified and multiple membership data structure (Browne et al., 2001).",

The CMM model uses weights for multiple membership and takes into account cross-classified factors that might arise in the data. A few studies in veterinary epidemiology have used the CMM model with different response variables. Browne et al. (2001) applied a CMM model with a binary response to Danish poultry salmonella outbreak data. Masaoud et al. (2011) fitted a CMM logistic regression model to a dataset from aquaculture. Goldstein et al. (2002) introduced a linear response example of a multiple membership model for the milk yield of cows.",

For instance, Meyers and Beretvas (2006) and Luo and Kwok (2009) showed that ignoring one of the cross-classified factors in linear models results in biased estimation in the variance components and in the standard error of the regression coefficients. Results from Goldstein et al. (2007) demonstrated that using traditional models that ignore the multiple membership in the analysis when it is present underestimate the variance at the multiple membership level. In addition, models that take into account the multiple membership structure give a better fit than models that ignore such structures. Recently, a simulation study conducted by Chung and Beretvas (2012) showed that ignoring multiple membership structure causes bias in the estimates of the regression coefficients and the variance component at the multiple membership level.",

While there are a number of observational studies published documenting calf loss after the perinatal period, most studies are either longitudinal studies from single research facilities focussing on individual animal attributes (Patterson et al., 1987, Azzam et al., 1993, Wittum et al., 1993), surveys with some data on individual animal attributes but a relatively small number of privately owned herds (Wittum et al., 1994, Ganaba et al., 1995), or herd level surveys with limited or no individual animal data (Schumann et al., 1990; Mathison, 1993, Dutil et al., 1999). Because previous studies have not taken the time to calf loss into account in the analysis, we found no reports that look objectively at when individual risk factors are of greatest risk to calf survival.",

We studied mortality in calf beef cattle from January to June 2002 (180 days) which included a total of 24,647 calves and 971 cases of calf mortality from herds with complete local meteorological data. Calves with invalid values or missing information were excluded from the analysis. This eliminated about 5% of observations including 74 cases of mortality. This strategy resulted in 23,409 calves, with 897 of these calves experiencing the event of interest. The event was defined as a case of calf mortality that happened at least 1 h after birth; the event time was defined as the time from calving to death (recorded in days), and for those calves that died on the same day of birth the event time was set at 0.5. Calves that were sold during the follow-up period or survived until the end of the follow-up period were considered right censored observations. Because the observation period ended at the same time for all calves (June 30th), but all calves were born at different times during the calving season, we recognized the need for an analysis technique that accounted for different follow up times across the study population.",

In detail, Cox models with normal random effects can be estimated as generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) with a binary Poisson count response and a specific offset. The approach requires each observation in the data to be split into a multiple records based on the complete set of failure times in the dataset, and the offset equals the logarithm of the length of each time interval.

The fixed effect predictor was generated in each simulation from a Bernoulli distribution with a probability of 0.5.",

When the calf losses after 24 h were summarized for the present study, the average risk of mortality was 3.1%.

The age distribution of calf deaths was also similar to what was expected based on other reports. The 1986\u20131987 survey by Alberta Agriculture found that 52% of deaths of calves occurred in the first 14 days compared to 55% in the current study (Mathison, 1993).

This study like ours found an increased calf mortality rate for calves born under cold conditions. Because the other study was limited to a single research herd, they also had access to local precipitation data which were not consistently available in the present analysis. Azzam et al.

In our study, herd owners that moved calves out of the calving area and to a nursery pasture within 48 h had lower calf losses. This practice removes cow-calf pairs from the contaminated environment and prevents crowding in the calving area by dispersing newborn calves soon after birth (Radostits and Acres, 1980). The use of calf shelters which are not accessible to cows and heifers (Radostits and Acres, 1980, Olson, 1986) was also associated with decreased calf mortality. Schumann et al. (1990) reported that increasing the nursery shelter area helped to protect against calf diarrhoea, but did not differentiate between shelters accessible to both cows and calves and shelters accessible to just calves.",

The simulation study therefore supported our findings of relatively small variance components for veterinary clinics and regions in the real data. In addition, simulation study II showed that the estimation of between-clinic variance was improved in a more pronounced multiple membership structure and with larger variance components. Both simulation studies demonstrated difficulties with estimation of the between-ecoregion variance and its standard error, and this can probably attributed to the small number of ecologic regions.",
