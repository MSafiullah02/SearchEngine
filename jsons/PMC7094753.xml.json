SCV can be transmitted rapidly from person to person with an approximately 11% case fatality rate. Although the first epidemic had been successfully contained and only very few new cases were reported after fall of 2003 (Enserink, 2003, Normile, 2004a, Normile, 2004b), SARS still remains a threat due to its highly transmittable nature to human populations and the mysterious origin of SCV (Arita et al., 2003, Chan et al., 2003, Inouye, 2003, Ratzan, 2003, Sampathkumar et al., 2003, Tong and Liang, 2004). Currently, there are no proven antiviral drugs effective for this viral infection (Drosten et al., 2003, Holmes, 2003, Kuiken et al., 2003, Normile, 2004b). Developing effective vaccines against SCV is the most cost-effective approach to achieve protection in a large population susceptible to SCV infection.",

This implies that if a vaccine can elicit robust humoral immunity, it will be protective against SCV infection by eliminating or reducing the cell-free viral infectivity (Chantler and Davies, 1987, Burton, 1997, Maruyama et al., 1999, Roehrig et al., 2001, Burton et al., 2004). To evaluate the neutralizing antibody activities in serum samples from either SCV infected hosts or those immunized with candidate SCV vaccines, it is critical to establish highly reproducible and quantitative in vitro virus neutralization assays.",

This method relies on the direct observation of damaged target cells from SCV infection under a microscope. However, the results can be influenced by the subjective interpretation from the researchers, and it is not easy to quantitatively determine the neutralizing activities based on the degree of cytopathic effect. While completely protected cells can be easily distinguished from the damaged cells, partially protected cell populations are hard to evaluate. Therefore, it is difficult to come up with a titration curve to measure the strength of a neutralizing antibody with serially diluted testing antibodies.",

However, unpublished data including our own have observed that the plaques formed in SCV infected target cells (such as Vero E6) were poor and could not be visualized clearly unless a microscope is used.

It appears that the neutral red staining was the most sensitive method in detecting positive neutralizing activities. The overall pattern on the levels of neutralizing antibody activities among positive rabbit sera was very similar and independent of the type of assays used. Rabbit serum specific for S1.1 fragment always had the highest neutralizing activities and rabbit serum specific for S2 subunit had the least positive neutralizing activities (Table 1). These two regions on Spike protein of SCV were shown to be the two neutralizing domains (Wang et al., 2005). Rabbit sera elicited by larger S antigens (either the full length S protein or the entire S1 subunit) showed some variation of neutralizing antibody activities when different neutralization assays were used. It is possible that antibodies targeting at non-neutralizing epitopes in these sera may interfere with the antibodies targeting at the neutralizing epitope. The prebleed sera and sera from rabbits immunized with either vector control or S1.2 fragment DNA vaccine did not show any positive neutralizing activities by any of the three assays, indicating the overall high specificities of these tests. Results in Table 1 were calculated based on four independent experiments for each of the three assays (Fig. 4\n). Experiment-to-experiment variations or the assay reproducibility for both plague reduction and neutral red staining assays were much better than the CPE assay.",

We discovered that the molecular weight of methylcellulose was very important for the plaque formation. When the 1% methylcellulose 4,000 CP in maintenance medium was used as the overlay medium, it produced easily visible plaques on the testing plates. However, other methylcellulose compounds with lower or higher molecular weights could not achieve the same results. This finding re-established the utility of plaque assay for SARS research. This assay can be used for pathogenesis studies to monitor the viral titers without using more complicated molecular or biochemical analyses to quantify the amounts of SCV. This procedure can lower the risk of handling hazardous SCV which has high potential of human transmission as shown in previous laboratory accidents (Normile, 2004a, Normile, 2004c, Watts, 2004). The same improved plaque formation technique can also be applied to study other viruses which may also have difficulty in producing plaques with visible sizes.",

The captured healthy cells could uptake and hold neutral red dye without being washed off by PBS but not the infected cells which formed synthicia or CPE. The cell viability could be easily determined by measuring the absorbance of neutral red dye released from cells after extracting with acid alcohol. Although the Vero E6 cells are adherent epithelial cells attached to the bottom of tissue culture plates, we demonstrated that direct staining of the Vero E6 cells infected with SCV in the plate worked very well. In order to achieve the best reading, special attention should be placed on the number of cells seeded on the plate, virus/cell ratio, and the concentration of neutral red. Too many cells seeded would generate high background of the staining due to over-grown cells. On the other hand, if the cell numbers were too low, the difference between the A540 reading of cell controls and the A540 reading of viral controls would also be small as the denominator to calculate the percentage of the neutralization. The preferred range of A540 differences between viral infected well and cell controls well should be around \u223c 1.",

The CPE assay is simple and does not require any special reagents or devices other than a regular light microscope. However, the scoring of SCV induced CPE under microscope could be highly subjective and sometimes the results reported by different observers may vary. Since the CPE score is mainly based on the morphology of cell conditions, which is an evolving process, it is difficult to standardize the scoring based on the degrees of CPE. In our previous study, a more stringent standard was used for the CPE based neutralization assay: it was scored positive once any CPE-like morphology of the cells was observed. Although CPE assay is useful, it would be ideal to develop more quantitative and objective assays.",

However, the neutralizing antibody titers observed by the plaque reduction assay in our study were lower than those determined by the CPE assay or the neutral red staining assay. One important factor for such difference may be due to the different amounts of virus used in these assays. The MOI was 0.032 in the plaque reduction assay and 0.02 in both the neutral red staining and the CPE assays. Different neutralizing titers were also observed for neutralizing antibodies against vaccinia between a plaque reduction assay and a biomarker assay (Earl et al., 2003). Therefore the plaque reduction assay may be more useful in differentiating the high titer and low titer anti-SCV antibodies.

None of the negative control sera showed any detectable neutralizing activities indicating the high specificity of these assays. Therefore, these two additional neutralizing assays against SCV can serve as useful tools for SARS research including several clinical trials recently started in human volunteers to test the immunogenicity of candidate SARS vaccines.",
