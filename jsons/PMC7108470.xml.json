These values were calculated by using samples in which false negatives were detected in the case of positive agreement, and samples in which false positives were detected in the case of negative agreement. The performance of each technique was compared by using the McNemar test, and results indicated that PCR-ESI/MS and MALDI-TOF/MS were not statistically different on either the genus or species level (P > 0.05).",

Although the resulting identification of a microorganism is the same regardless of the technique used, the information required to come to these data is very different for each technique. PCR-ESI/MS uses genetic information whereas MALDI-TOF/MS uses proteomic information to identify organisms present; this difference highlights the varying utilities of each instrument. Genetic identification allows for discrimination down to the representative strain type of each organism during routine work, detects silent mutations, and allows access to antibiotic resistance genes, providing a mechanism for rapid antibiotic susceptibility testing. Proteomic information however, in many instances discriminates down to species-level functioning to provide organism identification. Although several studies have been performed using MALDI-TOF/MS to discriminate clonal/strain types (32\u201334), this procedure is not performed routinely and would not be applied if used for high-throughput clinical identification. PCR-ESI/MS and MALDI-TOF/MS show similar performance for routine use, but PCR-ESI/MS offers extended utility for epidemiology and infection control. Furthermore, utilizing genetic information offers the potential for identifying uncultivatable organisms.",

            "text": "An additional aspect that should be considered regarding these methods is the time to result. PCR-ESI/MS requires approximately 4\u20136 h from the time of blood culture positivity, and can resolve mixtures in 1 assay, but this method requires the batching of 6 samples at a time, and may allow direct analysis on whole blood, removing the requirement for blood culture. Conversely, MALDI-TOF/MS currently requires subculture before identification. The time required for this step varies from an additional 12 h from positivity up to and beyond 72 h (35), depending on the organism. MALDI-TOF/MS does not require batching, although owing to the subculture requirement, a batched format may be more convenient. Several recent reports have described the use of MALDI-TOF/MS for identification of microorganisms without subculture (23, 24, 36, 37), and the recently released Sepsityper by Bruker Daltonics (www.bdal.com) has demonstrated the potential to reduce the time to identification. In these studies results have shown successful identification for approximately 80% of blood cultures and therefore demonstrate that more developmental work is required to increase this identification rate before clinical implementation. Although PCR-ESI/MS is currently the faster technique for microorganism identification, recently described MALDI-TOF/MS methods may soon reduce the time to identification to less than an hour from blood culture positivity. The identification times observed for these 2 MS techniques offer a stark comparison to current reports of requirements of approximately 40 h for identification with gold standard methods (38).",

Both require the purchase of a dedicated mass spectrometer and software package at a cost that can be considered equivalent for the purposes of this discussion, despite the expected differences in the overall costs of each method. However, the day-to-day cost for consumables greatly varies. PCR-ESI/MS requires DNA extraction and a kit that contains reagents necessary for a PCR, including buffers, enzyme, and primers, resulting in a cost of $50 to $100 per sample, which is comparable to the cost of existing molecular assays. Alternatively, MALDI-TOF/MS requires only media to culture the organism, <1 \u03bcg matrix, and tips, the cost of which is approximately $3 to $7 per sample.",
