This epidemic highlighted these challenges that need to be resolved in order to be better prepared for similar scenarios in the future. Firstly the number of psychiatrists needs to be increased. In the last ten years the number of psychiatrists has increased from 24,000 to 40,000 (Chenhui Shi et al., 2019) , however, for a number of reasons patients suffering from mental disorders are generally more susceptible to infections J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f (Hao Yao et al., 2020 a) , so in this outbreak there were more psychiatric emergencies than psychiatrists and psychotherapists could handle. Secondly, even though there are lots of online psychological self-help services, many questions remain unanswered with regards to the availability and accessibility of online mental health services in low and middle-income countries (Hao Yao et al., 2020 b) , especially for chronic psychiatric patients (Chuanyuan Kang et al., 2020) . Finally, while playing a positive role in the control of the epidemic spread, the quarantine measure has also resulted in some negative outcomes, especially in the field of psychological health. So for the future there is a need to research a number of areas, such as the evaluation of the positive and negative effects of the quarantine on mental health and on the limitation of the epidemic spread, the efficacy of supporting interventions, as well as legal issues when facing severe public health crises.",

So far, this book has been printed in 125,000 copies and 100,000 copies have been distributed to Hubei medical staff and patients, and Shanghai residents for free.Chinese mental health professionals have also provided the government with some specialist recommendations about policies, regulations, and measures from the perspective of individual, group and population mental health. Many suggestions have been gradually adopted, such as those addressing the issue of delivering humane, holistic care in the mobile cabin hospitals. Before the launch of this new type of hospital, based on these recommendations, psychosomatic medicine and holistic, humane care were integrated into one service in this kind of hospital.
