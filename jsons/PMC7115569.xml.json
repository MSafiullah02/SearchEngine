RSV is a negative strand RNA virus that belongs to the Pneumovirus genus within the Paramyxoviridae family. The frequency and seriousness of BRSV diseases are regarded as the principal health problem in calf rearing worldwide and are responsible for large economic losses in dairy and beef farming. The frequency of BRSV infections is very high in cattle less than 1-year-old and the virus may be responsible for more than 60% of the epizootic respiratory diseases observed in dairy herds and up to 70% in beef herds [2]. Mortality caused by BRSV infections ranges generally between 0.5% and 3% but can reach up to 20% in some outbreaks [3]. The control of BRSV infections is a high priority for animal health and farming organizations, not only for economic reasons, but also due to the impact on animal welfare. Several commercial BRSV vaccines, including modified-live virus and inactivated single fraction are available for use in cattle. Their efficacy needs improvement in terms of duration of protection, clinical and virological protection. Even though the commercial bovine vaccines probably have reduced the prevalence of infection, BRSV continues to circulate in cattle populations.",

HRSV induced-bronchiolitis is the most common cause of infant hospitalization in industrialized countries and is a suspected risk factor of recurrent wheeze and asthma in later life [4]. The main reason for the lack of human vaccine is the dramatic failure in the late sixties of a formalin inactivated HRSV vaccine that not only failed to protect against subsequent infection but also induced exacerbated disease in children [5]. Vaccine augmented disease has also been described in calves and some commercial BRSV vaccines were withdrawn from the market for that reason [6], [7]. Other obstacles to vaccination exist, such as the need to immunize immunologically immature young infants and the presence of maternal antibodies that can have a strong suppressive effect on the outcome of vaccination, both in animals and humans.",

Altogether these studies highlight the delicate tuning between cytotoxic anti-viral CD8 T cells and RSV-specific antibodies, which, although generally protective against RSV infection, may both have deleterious effect [8]. For instance, poorly neutralizing antibodies with low avidity for the protective RSV epitopes can lead to enhanced respiratory syncytial virus disease [9]. The RSV-F and G glycoproteins, which are situated at the surface of the virions, are the targets of neutralizing antibodies. Research on HRSV subunit vaccines has essentially focused on these two proteins, by using chimeric FG glycoprotein, full-length F proteins or a recombinant protein containing the central antigenic domain of the HRSV G protein fused to the C-terminal end of the albumin-binding domain of the streptococcal G protein [10]. However, recombinant G and F or chimeric FG were often found to cause enhancement of lung pathology upon RSV challenge, in association with the priming of Th2 cells [1], [11].",

            "text": "In addition to the risk of disease exacerbation by vaccination, another critical issue for human or bovine RSV vaccination is the variability of the viral isolates circulating worldwide. An effective bovine or human vaccine should protect against all of them. The nucleoprotein (N) that covers the viral RNA genome, forming the viral nucleocapsid, is the most conserved of RSV proteins and is a major target of the cellular immune response against RSV [12], [13], [14]. Thus, contrary to F or G antigens, N based vaccines offer the possibility of T-cell-mediated cross-protective immunity against circulating RSV. Strategies aimed at using N in a vaccine to stimulate T cell immunity have focused on live-attenuated virus vector and on DNA vaccine. Vaccination of mice with recombinant vaccinia virus encoding the HRSV N protein induced partial protection [15], [16]. Similarly, immunization of young calves with a recombinant vaccinia virus expressing the BRSV N protein induced non-neutralizing antibodies and primed BRSV-specific proliferative T response and IFN-\u03b3 production that resulted in reduction of viral replication in the upper and lower respiratory tract [17]. DNA immunization by two administrations of plasmids encoding BRSV-F and N proteins primed a strong cell-mediated immunity in calves, which drastically reduced viral replication, clinical signs and pulmonary lesions after a highly virulent challenge [18]. More recently a nucleocapsid-based DNA prime\u2013protein boost vaccination was shown to confer protection against BRSV replication and lung pathology [19].",

            "text": "Compared to DNA, or live-attenuated vector vaccines, subunit vaccines are safer because they do not present the risk of replication/integration of genetically modified material. However subunit vaccines using the nucleoprotein (N) have been poorly investigated, in part because a recombinant N was difficult to produce as a soluble protein. We have set up an original technology to engineer circular nanoparticles composed of 10\u201311 recombinant N [20], the 3D structures of which have just been solved [21]. These nanoparticles are named NSRS for sub-nucleocapsid ring structures [20]. Intranasal vaccination of mice with HRSV NSRS nanoparticles primes N-specific CD4 and CD8 T cells and significantly reduces titers of RSV in the lungs of mice following HRSV challenge without signs of disease exacerbation [22]. One major limit of the mouse model is the absence of respiratory disease in response to RSV infection. Therefore the objectives of the present study were to evaluate the potency of NSRS as a vaccine in calves that are the natural host for BRSV and that display clinical respiratory symptoms and lung lesions upon infection. Because the N amino acid sequence is highly conserved between bovine and human RSV strains (\u224894% amino acid identity), we took it as an opportunity to test whether NSRS from HRSV strain Long would provide cross-protective immunity against viral challenge with a BRSV strain. The data presented in this study showed that vaccination with the nano-rings NSRS partially protected against both respiratory disease and virus replication upon BRSV challenge without signs of vaccine-mediated disease exacerbation.",

The oleic acid and the sugar polar part used are from a vegetable origin. Experimental small scale vaccine emulsion was performed using silverson L4RT with tubular system mixer. The ratio of Montanide\u2122 71 VG/aqueous phase was 7 g of adjuvant/3 g antigenic phase. Montanide\u2122 71 VG was added first in a beaker and the head of the silverson was placed in the oil with agitation at 1000 rpm. The appropriate amount of antigenic phase (at the same temperature than the Montanide\u2122 71 VG) was then added progressively, and the rotation speed was increased to 5000 rpm for 3 min, with gentle moving of the beaker. To control that NSRS were not denatured in emulsion with Montanide\u2122 ISA71 VG, 0.1 ml of butanol was added to 1 ml of emulsion, resulting in separation of aqueous and organic phases.

The TMB substrate (Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories Inc., MD, USA) was added and the reaction was stopped after 10 min by 1 M phosphoric acid. The absorbance was measured at 450 nm with an ELISA plate reader (MRX Revelation, Dynex Technologies, Germany). The results were expressed as endpoint antibody titers calculated by regression analysis plotting dilution versus A\n450 (regression curve y\n = (b\n + \ncx)/(1 + \nax) using Origin software). Endpoint titers were calculated as the highest dilution giving twice the absorbance of negative control sample.",

We were the first to publish an efficient and safe vaccination strategy against RSV using the nucleocapsid protein alone as a vaccine antigen, under the form of soluble nanoparticles referred to as NSRS\n[22]. In this previous study done in mice we have demonstrated that NSRS is highly immunogenic when delivered via the nasal route and that the immune response primed upon vaccination is protective against an HRSV challenge [22].

As frequently published with BRSV challenge models [30], [31], [32], it is difficult to reproduce the severe clinical signs or lesions observed upon natural infections. In calves normally bred in farms and not in isolation units like in the present study, bacterial or virus co-infections complicate the classical BRSV disease. The bovine parainfluenza virus 3 (BPIV-3), which is widespread in 2\u20138-month-old cattle, reduces pulmonary defences [33], [34] and thus may enhance the severity of the BRSV pathogenicity. Both viruses, BRSV and BPIV-3, are important predisposing factors in the development of bacterial bronchopneumonia in cattle. In addition intrinsic host parameters seem to control the severity of the disease since severe pathology is associated with dysfunctions of the host's response [8]. In this study, we used a BRSV 3761 inoculum which was previously shown successful in reproducing severe respiratory signs after intranasal and intratracheal injections of 1 and 3-month-old Prim\u2019Holstein calves (G. Meyer, unpublished results; [18]). This inoculum contained BRSV with few passages in cell cultures and with 3 cycles of amplification in newborn calves, a condition also shown by others to induce severe respiratory disease in calves [35], [36]. By comparison with previous successful experiments, failure to reproduce respiratory distress syndrome in this study could be related to host intrinsic parameters. Indeed, another study, using the same inoculum and crossed Prim\u2019Holstein/Normandy calves of same origin, also failed to reproduce respiratory distress [19].",

The gene encoding the nucleoprotein is shown to be one of the most conserved between BRSV and HRSV with an average of \u224894% amino acid identity. The nucleoprotein from BRSV is recognized by bovine CD8+ T cells but the precise CTL epitopes have not been defined yet [29]. In human, HLA-B07, HLA-B08 and HLA-A02 restricted epitopes were mapped in the nucleoprotein [12], [14] and interestingly their amino acid sequence is fully conserved among various HRSV field isolates and with BRSV strains [14]. The mechanisms of CTL cross-reactivity have been recently investigated with well-characterized CTL epitopes from HIV showing that biochemically similar amino acid substitutions do not drastically affect recognition by TCR [37]. Some level of cross-protection between HRSV and BRSV has been demonstrated in the cotton rat model in which BRSV was tested as a possible Jennerian vaccine against HRSV [38]. Among the viral antigens that may be cross protective between BRSV and HRSV, the BRSV-F (81% amino acid identity with HRSV-F), delivered as DNA vaccine, was shown to protect mice against an HRSV challenge [39]. The present study brings new data to support the hypothesis of common B or T epitopes between BRSV and HRSV nucleoproteins. Indeed, in our study, primary BRSV infection resulted in antibody and cellular immunity that could be revealed with an NSRS coated ELISA assay or following an in vitro boost with NSRS, respectively. Conversely serum Ab from NSRS vaccinated calves reacted against a BRSV-infected cell lysate. This indicates that recombinant N from HRSV origin assembling into nano-rings and the nucleocapsid protein N from BRSV strain 3761 displayed at least some common epitopes and that vaccination with NSRS from HRSV protein sequences provide significant cross-protection against BRSV challenge in calves.",

Moreover, a single intranasal vaccination has previously been shown to prime calves in the face of maternal antibodies [41]. Commercially available modified-live-BRSV vaccines that were formulated and licensed for parenteral use were shown to induce partial protection when administered intranasally [42]. Recently a single intranasal dose of a bivalent modified-live vaccine was shown to reduce nasal shedding of BRSV after challenge at 10 or 21 days post-vaccination, despite low BRSV neutralizing antibody titers detected after vaccination [32].",

This could be explained by a weak response to the intranasal vaccination or a masking of the immune response induced after intranasal vaccination by those obtained after intramuscular vaccination.

Cellular immunity mediated by virus-specific CD8 T cells is required to clear BRSV from the lungs of infected calves in a primary infection [47], [48] and N is one of the main targets of CD8+ T cell responses to BRSV [29]. In the present study we have shown that NSRS vaccination primed antigen-specific T cell memory responses, characterized by their capacity to proliferate and secrete IFN-\u03b3. In other studies implying NSRS vaccination in mouse or lamb animal models we have shown that N-specific memory CD8 and CD4 T cell are primed ([22] and S. Riffault unpublished results). Recently a vaccination regimen using the nucleoprotein in a DNA prime\u2013protein boost protocol was shown to be superior to DNA or protein vaccination alone to prime antigen-specific CD8 memory T cells, to protect against BRSV replication and to reduce lung pathology [19]. However, because DNA vaccination is not authorized in human, the use of N protein alone for vaccination of newborn children could be an interesting alternative approach. Moreover NSRS can be produced in large amount in bacteria and their nanoring structure is very stable either at 4 \u00b0C or 20 \u00b0C (our unpublished observations), making their production and storage cheap and easy.",
