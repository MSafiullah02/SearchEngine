The resulting morbidity and mortality and subsequent psychosocial and economic impact on communities can be devastating. Bioterrorism can differ in several significant aspects from other modes of terrorism. Terrorist activities involving chemical agents, small arms, explosive or incendiary devices, or nuclear or radiological weapons are likely to be recognized by first responders such as the police, fire department, emergency medical service (EMS) or Hazardous Material (Hazmat) personnel at the point of attack. The morbidity and mortality caused by these agents are essentially limited to the area in which they are dispersed with secondary effects expected among first responders and in healthcare facilities to which victims are transported.",

Initial recognition of disease caused by bioterrorist activity will most likely be by medical personnel in emergency departments, clinics, or private practices some days or weeks after release of the agent. Outbreaks of disease caused by bioterrorist activity [8] may initially present similar to many common and naturally occurring outbreaks such as influenza, resulting in further delay in the recognition of the event for what it is. Properties of certain biological agents of terrorism (e.g., smallpox, pneumonic plague, and viral hemorrhagic fevers) include person-to-person transmission. The potential for a sustained outbreak with widespread cases can be great, therefore, unless appropriate interventions that contain the outbreak are implemented. The potential for delayed recognition and response with subsequent dire consequences is substantial. There are many biological agents considered potential bioweapons. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has developed three categories of biological agents, prioritized as to their potential of bioterrorist use and the severity of disease they may produce (Box 1).",

Each state, however, determines whether and how these conditions should be made reportable except for the quarantinable diseases (cholera, diphtheria, infectious tuberculosis, plague, potential pandemic influenza viruses, SARS, smallpox, yellow fever, viral hemorrhagic fevers). Reporting of these infections is required by international regulation [2, 11]. The legal basis requiring reporting of notifiable diseases varies by state, as does the authority for determining which cases are reportable [2, 11]. Depending on the state, reporting of notifiable diseases may be mandated by the legislature, state health officer or epidemiologist, the board of health or some combination thereof [2, 12, 13]. Most states require reporting of all notifiable conditions recommended by CSTE and many have included diseases not included in the NNDSS. For instance, smallpox was removed from the NNDSS list of notifiable diseases in 1988 due to the declared eradication of the disease by the World Health Assembly in 1980; however, most states have reinstituted mandatory reporting of smallpox because of concerns of its use as a bioweapon. The Infectious Disease Committee of the CSTE has since recommended that smallpox be placed under surveillance by all states, territories, and the CDC as part of NNDSS [14]. In addition, many states mandate the reporting of outbreaks due to any pathogen regardless of inclusion in the NNDSS list of notifiable infectious diseases.",

Notifiable disease reporting was traditionally performing using paper-based data collection forms. In 1984, the CDC in collaboration with the CSTE began testing the Epidemiologic Surveillance Project [15], with a goal to demonstrate the effectiveness of computer transmission of public health surveillance data between state health departments and the CDC. The project developed computer programs using existing disease surveillance systems to transmit data to the CDC on all nationally notifiable diseases. In 1985, the system became a fully interactive computer-based reporting system. By 1989, all 50 states were participating and the project was renamed the National Electronic Telecommunications System for Surveillance (NETSS) [15, 16]. De-identified data is transmitted weekly from all 50 state health departments as well as from New York City, Washington D.C., and five US Territories.",

In 1993, the CDC/Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) Steering Committee on Public Health Information and Surveillance System convened to implement a major initiative for the creation of integrated public health surveillance and health information systems. Their recommendations are documented in the 1995 report, Integrating Public Health Information and\nSurveillance Systems [18]. Subsequently, the National Electronic Disease Surveillance System (NEDSS) initiative was developed and is currently in the process of being implemented. While NETSS addressed the issue of electronic data transfer from the state level to the CDC, NEDSS has expanded the scope of the initial initiative to include the integration of all related surveillance systems at the local, state and federal level through innovative electronic and information technology. NEDSS \u201cpromotes the use of data and information system standards to advance the development of efficient, integrated, and interoperable surveillance systems at federal, state and local levels [19].\u201d The long-term objective of NEDSS [20] is to facilitate development of complementary electronic information systems that automatically gather health data from a variety of sources on a real-time basis as well as facilitate the monitoring of the health of communities. NEDSS will also assist in the ongoing analysis of trends and detection of emerging public health problems and provide information for setting public health policy. The NEDSS architecture will eventually replace the NETSS reporting format. NEDSS currently resides within the Public Health Information Network (PHIN) [21] initiative and serves as its public health surveillance component.",

            "text": "After years of political and financial neglect, our current public health infrastructure is currently under tremendous stress to meet the myriad public health problems posed daily regardless of the demands of bioterrorism security. For example, the authors of this chapter work with the Communicable Diseases Division (CDD) of the Department of Health and Human Services of Newark, New Jersey (NDHHS). Newark is a city of approximately 250,000 residents in a metropolitan area of several million people located about 15 miles from downtown New York City. The residents of Newark are ethnically diverse with a substantial immigrant population. A significant portion of the population exists under the poverty level. All the public health problems found in urban areas are experienced by the city. There are tens of thousands commuters in the city throughout the week including 40,000 students attending the colleges, universities, and graduate schools. In addition, Newark Liberty Airport that services 32 million passengers a year, including 8 million international travelers, and the Port of Newark, one of the largest ports for container ships in the United States, are located within city boundaries. In addition, many vital roadways essential for the nation\u2019s commercial transport pass through the city. The potential for bioterrorist activity is great. The CDD of NDHHS manages infectious disease surveillance activities, including surveillance for bioterrorism. Despite funding for biodefense activities, the CDD remains understaffed and financially stressed to meet its\u2019 routine, non-terrorist-related public health responsibilities. A case can be made that the advent of substantial funding sources dedicated to bioterrorist-related activity has extended the pre-existing public health resources and divided attention from foundation public health issues. For example, during the smallpox vaccination campaign in early 2003, much of the public health workforce were furloughed from their usual duties to meet the demands required from the campaign leaving their usual responsibilities unfulfilled. The challenge is to develop and maintain surveillance capabilities that meet the daily needs of the community (e.g., vaccine-preventable infectious diseases, foodborne disease outbreaks, etc.) and are flexible enough to detect bioterrorist events. To meet this challenge the CDD/NDHHS formed an Office of Surveillance and Prevention (OSP) under the direction of the local Health Officer located at the NDHHS. Using state biodefense funding, a fulltime epidemiologist was hired for the OSP and a cooperative consultative arrangement was reached with the Department of Preventive Medicine and Community Health (DPMCH)/University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey (UMDNJ)/New Jersey Medical School (NJMS) and UMDNJ School of Public Health (SPH). This arrangement provides the CDD/NDHSS with additional expertise in surveillance, epidemiology, infectious diseases, and chemical toxins that it was not able to afford to directly employ. Examples of OSP surveillance activities will follow in this chapter.",

Estimating the magnitude of morbidity and mortality in the population due to the bioagent once it has been released and assessing the effectiveness of interventions in limiting the diseases. Surveillance can be used to monitor adverse health events associated with bioterrorism [23] or other major public health events, such as those associated with long-term antimicrobial prophylaxis for specific agents (anthrax) [24] or vaccination campaigns (smallpox [25, 26], influenza [27]). In addition, surveillance information can be used to help focus response assets and assist in efforts to manage community concerns [28].",

Recognition of suspected specific diagnosis (e.g., anthrax, plague, or smallpox), however, by frontline providers is difficult due to unfamiliarity with the syndromes associated with these agents or their similarity with the prodromal presentation of other naturally occurring infections.

Laboratory confirmation of infection involving culture of the agent from affected tissue usually takes several days after obtaining appropriate samples. Serologic evidence is usually not present at initial presentation. Other molecular diagnostic tools, such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR), can significantly shorten the turnaround time in obtaining microbiologic confirmation of a diagnosis. These testing modalities, however, are often not available at a local level, especially for uncommon pathogens and may not be ordered if available due to their expense if a common pathogen is the suspected etiologic agent. The situation is more difficult for laboratory identification of disease due to chemical toxins for which laboratory access is even more difficult and less widely used than for identification of infectious agents. Furthermore, outbreaks are often difficult to appreciate on the provider level and require a greater perspective (e.g., local community, city, regional, state(s), and nation) for recognition. For example, the extent of a recent outbreak of hepatitis A in western Pennsylvania was not recognized until review on a state level [30, 31]. Lack of awareness of reporting responsibilities by those required to report, including the what, when, whom, and how to report, as well as the ease of contact (availability of contact numbers, computer access, or forms) further exacerbate delay in reporting.",

Healthcare providers have numerous immediate responsibilities with respect to patient care so it is not surprising that reporting of diseases to public health agencies is often not prioritized. Even though required, the lack or perceived lack of resultant activity by health departments subsequent to case reporting discourages reporter participation. Active surveillance, the collection of data is elicited by the agency operating the surveillance system, is more likely to provide more complete reporting but is much more labor intensive and costlier than its passive cousin. One study [33] evaluated passive versus active surveillance in identifying cases of hepatitis A in Kentucky over a 22-week period. The report demonstrated that nine more cases were identified through the active surveillance system. This resulted in the prevention of an estimated additional seven cases through administration of prophylaxis to the contacts of the nine case-patients. The added benefit of active surveillance does not come without a price. The estimated cost of operating the active surveillance system was approximately six times that of the passive system [33].",

Problems identified included lapses in reporting due to failure or adjustments in data extraction software and lack of uniformity of coding standards between clinical laboratories. Specificity was adversely affected due to automated data extraction errors in extracting culture results if entered in free text, for example, reporting as positive a negative culture result due to the organism\u2019s name appearing in free text.

Since significant variability in assigning diagnostic terms or ICD-9-coding to similar patients exists between providers and clinics, syndromic surveillance can reduce variability in reporting when collecting data from different providers. For instance, one provider may code a patient who initially presents with clinical signs and symptoms of a LRTI with the ICD-9 codes for cough and fever, while another may code it as an unspecified pneumonia and a third may give that patient a more specific diagnosis of viral pneumonia. If all those initial diagnostic ICD-9 codes were included in a syndromic cluster for LRTI that case would be captured while it may have been missed in a surveillance system requiring a more defined diagnosis depending on the patient\u2019s provider.

Recent advancements in communication technology, including the Internet, allow the instantaneous transfer of information, however this technology relies on communication systems that may be vulnerable to interference. Alternative communication channels should be established in lieu of disruption of regular channels during an emergency.",

Surveillance information may be distributed to many different recipients with different functions and levels of understanding. Recipients may include physicians, hospital infection control or emergency departments, Office of Emergency Management (OEM) agencies, public health authorities, law enforcement agencies or mass media organizations. The surveillance information should be pertinent to the needs of the recipient so that they may better act on that information without confusion. Distilling data into charts and graphs can simplify and help clarify surveillance information; however, if done improperly the risk of transmission of misinformation is greatly increased. It is recommended that the public health agencies operating surveillance systems work closely with system users to develop methods of information transfer and presentation that are timely, consistent, clear and useful.",

Participation in a surveillance system depends on consistent feedback of information to the system\u2019s users and the perception that the information is useful. A surveillance system in which data flows in one direction (e.g., little to no feedback to the systems reporters) will undoubtedly experience lack of reporter enthusiasm with resulting reporting delay as well as under-reporting. Timely feedback of information generated by the surveillance system to the reporting entities enhances the chances of reporter participation in the system. In Newark, the OSP epidemiologist in the NDHHS not only forwards the daily emergency department census and admission data to the NJDHSS but distributes the results of the local data analysis to the ICPs at the five participating local hospitals in individual and aggregate format on a weekly basis. The NJDHSS distributes aggregated data on a state and county level collected via the CDRSS through an e-mail list-serve to the state regional epidemiologists who then share the information with interested local parties.",

Within a month of September 11, 2001, the CDD of the NDHHS and the Department of Preventive Medicine and Community Health of the New Jersey Medical School (NJMS) began hosting what initially were Thursday evening sessions of interested public health parties discussing local and regional issues of public health preparedness and response to terrorist activities. Discussions have since included diverse topics of significant public health interest. Participants have included representatives from local hospitals, the New Jersey Medical School and UMDNJ School of Public Health, local Emergency Medical Services (EMS), the New Jersey Poison Information and Education System (NJPIES), healthcare payer organizations, the Port Authority of New Jersey and New York (PANJNY), and the Public Health Service Quarantine Service, among others. Topics have included exercises in specific scenarios (e.g., arrival of a passenger with suspected smallpox infection to Newark Liberty Airport), local public health SARS preparedness, and discussion of specific surveillance issues with respect to agents of bioterrorism, influenza, SARS, and vaccine- preventable diseases. The familiarity engendered during these serial sessions between the representatives of the various agencies has resulted in increased interorganizational cooperation in developing and maintaining improved surveillance communication.",

The purpose of HAN is to ensure that all communities have 24/7 access to timely emergent public health information; the services of highly trained public health professionals; and evidence-based practices and procedures for effective public health preparedness, response, and service [21]. The objective is a seamless rapid alerts and communication system that connects the entire US public health infrastructure; from the local to the national. In New Jersey, HAN is accessed through the New Jersey Local Information and Communications System (NJLINCS) at the password-protected NJ HAN website [58]. Statewide information management resides in the NJDHSS while local management is governed by NJLINCS coordinators located at the county and selected city health departments.

This will occur either by direct observation (e.g., a report of a case of anthrax) or through detection of aberrant events (e.g., greater than expected occurrence of severe lower respiratory tract infections). Advances in information technology and the development of innovative surveillance methodology will augment their efforts.

The Institute of Medicine has identified the fragmentation of surveillance systems and lack of integration of public health data and information systems as a critical barrier to the timely flow of information in times of crisis [17]. These technologies provide the tools in which to integrate multiple programmatic public health surveillance and information systems from the local to federal level through the NEDSS initiative.
