            "text": "Emerging viral diseases pose a unique risk to public health. Ebola virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and members of the Henipavirus genus of paramyxoviruses are all highly pathogenic viruses that have arisen in the past 40 years and caused, or threaten to cause, major outbreaks. New viral threats continue to emerge, most recently demonstrated by a novel beta-coronavirus, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV), which was identified in 2012 (Zaki et al., 2012, Memish et al., 2013, de Groot et al., 2013). There are currently no approved vaccines or therapeutics for many of the highly pathogenic viruses potentially dependent on cathepsins, including Ebola virus, Nipah virus (NiV), MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV. Broad-spectrum antiviral drugs, with overlapping therapeutic indications, would facilitate rapid responses to new or changing pandemic threats, potentially even without precise identification of the agent. Targeting host factors involved in viral entry provides an excellent avenue for such drug development, due to the limited number of pathways involved (Zhou et al., 2011).",

However, the glycoproteins are synthesized as inactive precursors and depend on activation by host cell proteases to acquire a fusion active form. As a consequence, the respective enzymes are potential targets for broad-spectrum antiviral intervention. Cell culture studies demonstrated that endosomal cysteine proteases, in particular cathepsin B (CTSB) and/or L (CTSL), can activate the glycoproteins of filoviruses, SARS-CoV, other coronaviruses, and NiV and Hendra (HeV) viruses to facilitate entry into certain cell lines. In addition, activation of coronaviruses can also be accomplished by TMPRSS2, or other serine proteases located at the cell surface, or secreted into the extracellular space (Simmons et al., 2013). However, the respective roles of endosomal and cell surface proteases in viral spread in the infected host is unknown.",

We describe here the discovery of K11777 and its related compounds, as broad-spectrum antivirals targeting endosomal proteases involved in viral entry. K11777, a cysteine protease inhibitor, blocked infection when viral entry did not require activating serine proteases, as is the case with ebolavirus (EBOV). K11777 also fully inhibited coronavirus infection, but only when target cell lines lacking activating serine proteases were used. If cells expressed cell-surface serine proteases known to activate coronaviruses, both K11777 and a serine protease inhibitor, such as camostat were required for full inhibition. Thus, both compounds were deployed to examine which activation pathway is predominant in vivo. Camostat displayed antiviral activity in a pathogenic animal model for SARS-CoV infection, indicating that serine protease inhibitors are suitable for treatment of SARS and potentially MERS. The predicted effect of K11777 and related cysteine protease inhibitors versus Ebola virus in vivo must await studies in approved biocontainment facilities.",

Briefly, 293T/17 cells were transfected with up to 30 \u03bcg of viral envelope encoding plasmid and 10 \u03bcg of pNL4-3 reporter backbone per 10-cm dish by calcium phosphate transfection. The next day, expression was induced with sodium butyrate (10 mM) for 6 h before washing once. Forty hours after transfection, supernatant was filtered through a 0.45 \u03bcm-pore-size filter and frozen at \u221280 \u00b0C. Virus was titrated essentially as it would be used in the screening assay. If required, virions were purified and concentrated by ultracentrifugation (28,000 rpm in a SW28 rotor, Beckman) over a 20% sucrose cushion, resuspended in Hank\u2019s balanced salt solution (HBSS) and stored at \u221280 \u00b0C as aliquots. Pseudoviruses were normalized for equal infectivity by transduction of target cells with serially diluted stock followed 48 h later by determination of luciferase activity in cell lysates according to the manufacturer\u2019s instruction (Promega). VSV-based pseudotypes bearing Junin virus G were produced essentially as described (Steffen et al., 2013) by transfecting 293T cells with 16 \u03bcg of Junin G plasmid and then infecting the cells with recombinant VSV\u0394G-GFP(VSV-G). Progeny VSV\u0394G-GFP(Junin-G) virus was then collected, titrated and used for inhibition studies. In the case of NiV, VSV\u0394G-GFP(NiV F/G) viruses were produced via calcium phosphate transfection of 293T cells with 10 ug of NiV F and 10 \u03bcg of NiV G. Transfected cells were left for 16 h before an initial medium change; then infected with recombinant VSV\u0394G-GFP(VSV-G) (MOI 0.1\u20130.3) after five additional hours. Media alone or compound of interest were then added at the desired concentration and cells were incubated overnight before supernatant was harvested and filtered. To assay for inhibition, production of entry-competent virus was examined. Target cells were pre-plated at 25,000 cells/50 \u03bcl in 96 well plates and allowed to attach overnight. 50 \u03bcl of undiluted VSV\u0394G-GFP NiV F/G made in the presence or absence of inhibitor was added. Cells were incubated at 37 \u00b0C with 5% CO2 for two days, and then washed and fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde and GFP fluorescence determined by flow cytometry using a Becton Dickinson LSRII cytometer and FlowJo software. 100% infection was determined with samples infected with pseudovirons produced from cells with no compound exposure.",

We also tested the ability of K11777 to prevent activation and hence infectivity during production of VSV-based pseudotypes (Salvador et al., 2009) bearing NiV F and G. K11777 was active against all the major enveloped viruses previously known to require cathepsin-mediated proteolysis, including a variety of coronaviruses and filoviruses, especially EBOV (Fig. 1b; Table 1\n). K11777 inhibited SARS-CoV pseudovirus entry with an IC50 of 0.68 nM (Fig. 1b, Table 1) while no toxicity was observed, CC50\n > 10 \u03bcM (data not shown). MERS-CoV and NL63 envelope required higher concentrations of K11777 for inhibition, likely due to less reliance on CTSL (Gierer et al., 2013, Hofmann et al., 2006). Nevertheless, the IC50s were very low: 46 nM for MERS-CoV and <7 nM for NL63. In contrast, 100 nM K11777 did not inhibit infection mediated by envelope glycoproteins from an alphavirus (CHIKV), a rhabdovirus (VSV), a flavivirus (HCV), the retroviruses MLV-A and XMRV or two arenaviruses, Lassa and Junin virus.",

The serine protease inhibitor camostat mesylate (camostat) inhibits the enzymatic activity of TMPRSS2 and other cell-surface proteases involved in coronavirus activation (Kawase et al., 2012). We therefore assessed whether K11777 displays antiviral activity in TMPRSS2 expressing cells. For this, we incubated target cells with camostat, K11777, or a combination of K11777 and camostat and then infected with pseudoviruses bearing 229E-S. K11777 alone demonstrated up to \u223c70% inhibition of 229E-S-mediated transduction. Simultaneous treatment with camostat and K11777 increased inhibition to \u223c90% (Fig. 2\na, left panel). Similar inhibition patterns were obtained using the human intestinal epithelial cell line Caco-2, which express endogenous TMPRSS2 and cathepsins (Fig. 2b). In contrast, K11777 alone fully blocked Ebola pseudovirus infection, while camostat had no impact on viral infection (Fig. 2a, middle panel). Finally, treatment of cells with K11777, camostat or both, had no impact on VSV-G driven viral entry (Fig. 2a, right panel), which is known to be independent of cysteine and serine protease activity. These results indicate that both serine and cysteine proteases can activate 229E-S for viral entry, as expected, while EBOV-GP exclusively relies on cysteine proteases for activation.",

To explore this notion and to more generally evaluate structure\u2013activity trends, we synthesized new vinylsulfone analogs in which the substituent on the piperazine ring nitrogen atom was modified systematically. While the majority of these analogs (Table 2) retain a basic piperazine ring, the N-phenyl analog SMDC-256158 is only weakly basic (pKa \u223c3.42 for the conjugate acid) and thus will be neutral at physiological pH and would not be expected to exhibit lysosomotropic behavior.

The reduced potency of SMDC-256158 is likely not related to the size of the phenyl substituent, since even larger, biaryl P3 substituents are known to be well tolerated in cathepsin-L like proteases such as cruzain (Beaulieu et al., 2010). Also consistent with this interpretation, we find that other bulky tert-butyl and cyclopentyl groups are tolerated in analogs like SMDC-256160 and SMDC-256161. Therefore, the most likely explanation is that as a weak base and the only analog expected not to be protonated at physiological pH, SMDC-256158 does not accumulate in the lysosome to the same extent that the other, more basic, analogs do. Conversely, K11777 and the other basic analogs accumulate in acidic endosomal compartments where target cysteine proteases such as CTSL and CTSB are located.",

SMDC-256160 alone was no more effective than vehicle treated controls (Fig. 3). In contrast, camostat was effective in protecting mice against death due to a lethal infection by SARS-CoV, with a survival rate of \u223c60%. Combining both classes of inhibitors did not significantly improve survival versus camostat alone. Thus, SARS-CoV depends on serine protease activity for viral spread in vivo.",

A number of additional vinylsulfone analogs were synthesized, some of which exhibited enhanced potency compared to K11777. Most notably, potent antiviral activity was correlated with the presence of a basic piperazine ring at the P3 position, a finding that is consistent with accumulation in endosomal (acidic) compartments where the target cysteine proteases required for viral entry are located. The vinylsulfones described herein were broadly active against viral entry for three viral families: the corona-, filo- and paramyxoviruses, and are very well tolerated in vivo (Barr et al., 2005).",

In contrast, EBOV infection was effectively inhibited by K11777, but not by camostat. While unidentified additional proteases have been reported to mediate infection by other filoviruses, such as MARV (Gnirss et al., 2012) and SUDV (Misasi et al., 2012), efficient inhibition by the vinylsulfone analogs suggests that the unidentified proteases are cysteine proteases related to CTSB and L. Activation of NiV and HeV appears to be fully dependent on CTSL and/or CTSB (Pager et al., 2006, Diederich et al., 2008, Diederich et al., 2012). Thus, vinylsulfones are promising antiviral lead compounds for further optimization as potent inhibitors of these two important groups of pathogenic emerging viruses, including EBOV.",
