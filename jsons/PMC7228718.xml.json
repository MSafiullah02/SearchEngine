This definition is based on clinical criteria (pneumonia with fever and cough in the absence of signs of hypoxaemia), radiological criteria (because \u201csome cases may have no clinical signs and symptoms, but chest CT shows lung lesions, which are subclinical\u201d), or both.2 In another study of COVID-19 in children, Lu and colleagues3 also used CT scans to identify lung lesions and classify the severity of COVID-19.",

None of these 59 children had a CT scan; 14 (24%) had a chest x-ray. COVID-19 was confirmed by nasopharyngeal RT-PCR in a child aged 13 years who was exposed to a family member with COVID-19 and who later presented to our emergency department with a fever and dry cough. Blood tests, including inflammatory markers, were within normal ranges. Because the child appeared reasonably well, we did not do an x-ray or a CT scan, but did a lung ultrasound using a procedure we have previously described.4 The lung ultrasound showed a small, subcentimetric subpleural consolidation with vertical artefacts. The child recovered without treatment and the case of COVID-19 was classified as mild. However, we cannot know whether the CT scan would have showed subclinical lung lesions and thus allowed a classification of moderate disease.",

Therefore, a classification of severity that includes the radiological diagnosis of pneumonia is not appropriate for children. Guidelines5 state that medical history and examination are the determinants of pneumonia severity and appropriate levels of care, and that clinicians should reserve imaging to compromised children needing admission to hospital. Moreover, the high reported number of paediatric patients with asymptomatic and mild COVID-19 suggests that imaging should not be routinely used.1, 3\n",
