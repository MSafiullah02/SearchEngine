Study design: We investigated the presence of HBoV by quantitative PCR in the nasopharyngeal samples of 192 French children consecutively hospitalized for acute bronchiolitis. Other common respiratory viruses were detected using immunofluorescence assays, cell culture detection, or RT-PCR assays. Results: HBoV was detected in 24 (12.5%) of 192 study children. In 14/192 cases (7%) HBoV was the sole isolate and in 10/192 (5%) it was part of a mixed viral infection. HBoV was the third most common pathogen detected after respiratory syncytial virus (45/192; 23%) and rhinovirus (24/192; 12%). It occurred more often in infants aged 1-12 months (P = 0.002). Median levels of HBoV DNA genome in respiratory samples were significantly higher in patients with single HBoV infection than in patients with mixed respiratory viral infection with HBoV (4 \u00d7 10 8 copies/ml vs. 2 \u00d7 10 3 copies/ml, P < 0.001). Conclusions: Our data suggest that HBoV at a high viral load could be an etiologic agent of respiratory tract disease, whereas the exact role of HBoV at a low viral load, as etiological cause or as pathophysiological co-factor of respiratory diseases, remains to be determined.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "Human Bocavirus (HBoV) is a recently discovered pathogen identified as a cause of lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs) in humans (Allander et al., 2005 (Allander et al., , 2007 .

Recent studies have reported the presence of HBoV DNA sequences in 1.5-19% of respiratory tract samples of infants with various respiratory diseases hospitalized in North America, Europe, Asia, Africa and Australia suggesting that this virus is an ubiquitous respiratory pathogen (Allander et al., 2005 (Allander et al., , 2007 Arnold et al., 2006; Bastien et al., 2006; Choi et al., 2006; Foulongne et al., 2006; Ma et al., 2006; Sloots et al., 2006; Weissbrich et al., 2006) . In these previous reports, HBoV was identified by PCR assays either as a unique viral pathogen or associated with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) or other common respiratory viruses, suggesting that this virus could play a role as etiological agent or as cofactor of bronchiolitis. At present, the potential causal role of HBoV in the development of childhood bronchiolitis remains to be assessed in well-defined respiratory disease cohort of paediatric patients (Simon et al., 2007; Allander et al., 2007) . In the present report, we retrospectively analyzed the epidemiological, virological and clinical features of HBoV respiratory infections in a cohort of French children hospitalized for acute bronchiolitis. To assess the causal role of HBoV in bronchiolitis, all the study respiratory samples were tested for the presence of other common respiratory viruses, including human metapneumovirus (HMPV) by classical immunofluorescence antigen detection, cell culture or molecular detection assays.

Taken together, these findings suggest an association between high HBoV load (high level of replicative viral infection) and acute bronchiolitis of otherwise unknown etiology. Other reports have assessed the HBoV DNA level in nasopharyngeal aspirates of infants hospitalized for bronchiolitis (Allander, 2008) . However, none of these previous studies normalized their results according to the number of GAPDH DNA copies detected. Therefore, in the previously published studies, the differences observed in viral loads might be attributable to differences in the quality of nasopharyngeal specimens (Allander, 2008) . Allander et al. previously defined two subgroups characterized by HBoV DNA levels lower or higher than 10 4 ml \u22121 . According to this study, an HBoV DNA level higher than 10 4 ml \u22121 is a high viral load and one statistically associated with symptoms (Allander, 2008) . Taking into account the previous published results on HBoV DNA levels, our quantitative data suggest that HBoV was a potential etiologic agent in 14 patients with HBoV infection alone, of whom 7 (50%) had a high viral load of \u22654 \u00d7 10 8 copies/ml (Fig. 1) (Allander, 2008) . At the same time, shedding of HBoV (continuous or secondary to other infections) also appears to be common and was detected in mixed infections in 10 of our patients, of whom 1 (10%) had a high viral load, suggesting a potential etiological role of HboV in this case (Fig. 1) . Of these 10 patients, 5 with a mixed viral infection had a medium HBoV DNA level ranging from 2 \u00d7 10 3 to 4 \u00d7 10 8 ml \u22121 suggesting a potential etiological role of this virus in the development of bronchiolitis. Four patients with mixed viral infection demonstrated an HBoV DNA level lower than 2 \u00d7 10 3 ml \u22121 , suggesting an absence of etiological role of this virus in the development of bronchiolitis (Fig. 1) . In fact, the diagnostic value of the viral load in individual patients remains to be determined in further prospective multicenter clinical studies (Allander, 2008) . Several studies have also reported that dual viral infections are associated with more severe disease than infections with a single viral agent, therefore the clinical relevance of high or low levels of HBoV viral load will require further large additional studies (Greensill et al., 2003; Papadopoulos et al., 2002; Semple et al., 2005) (Table 2 ).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 862, "end": 878, "text": "(Allander, 2008)", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 1168, "end": 1184, "text": "(Allander, 2008)", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 1437, "end": 1453, "text": "(Allander, 2008)", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 1711, "end": 1727, "text": "(Allander, 2008)", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 2571, "end": 2587, "text": "(Allander, 2008)", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 2855, "end": 2879, "text": "(Greensill et al., 2003;", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 2880, "end": 2906, "text": "Papadopoulos et al., 2002;", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 2907, "end": 2927, "text": "Semple et al., 2005)", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 141, "end": 150, "text": "(Table 1)", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}, {"start": 558, "end": 566, "text": "(Fig. 1)", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}, {"start": 1702, "end": 1710, "text": "(Fig. 1)", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}, {"start": 1997, "end": 2005, "text": "(Fig. 1)", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}, {"start": 2412, "end": 2420, "text": "(Fig. 1)", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}, {"start": 2928, "end": 2936, "text": "(Table 2", "ref_id": "TABREF1"}], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "In the present study, HBoV-associated acute bronchiolitis did not differ clinically from that induced by rhinoviruses, enteroviruses, or RSV.

Risk factors for severe disease with HBoV may be similar to those for RSV in the present study: prematurity and asthma (Table 2) . Interestingly, the seasonal distribution of HBoV in our study was characterized by two peaks-winter and spring (Fig. 2) , and therefore appeared to be different from those previously observed in Canada where no seasonal prevalence was reported (Bastien et al., 2006 (Bastien et al., , 2007 .

Our data suggest that HBoV at a high viral load could be an etiologic agent of respiratory tract disease, whereas the exact role of HBoV at a low viral load, as etiological cause or as pathophysiological co-factor, remains to be determined. Quantitative analysis normalized by the number of GAPDH DNA copies detected in nasal secretions, may be important to ensure comparability of future studies of HBoV infection. These further investigations would be of major interest for the development of future diagnostic, therapeutic and preventive strategies to fight against the viral causes of childhood bronchiolitis.",
