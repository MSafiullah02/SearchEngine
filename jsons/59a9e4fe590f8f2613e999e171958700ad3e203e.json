            "text": "It was with that concern in mind that, when colleagues from China alerted us to the potential spread of COVID-19 to operating room staff, and with increasing reports of significant morbidity and mortality among otolaryngologists in several countries, we were motivated to rapidly share our concerns with the surgical community. The primary purpose of our Letter, 1 as the title suggests, was to alert the international readership of Neurosurgery that precautions for endoscopic transnasal skull base surgery during the COVID-19 pandemic were warranted. If our Letter 1 potentially prevented one infection, we would feel we have succeeded in our primary purpose.",

            "text": "The Wuhan group (Huang et al 4 ) , in their recent reply, raised an issue with our report that suggested the likelihood of intraoperative transmission. They confirmed that 14 individuals in their hospital, involved with the care of a COVID-19 patient undergoing transnasal surgery, indeed became infected, but raised the possibility that the infections were from direct contact outside the operating room and not from aerosolization of viral particles in the operating room. We thank them for their response and welcome their report. We acknowledge the difficulties in dealing with the earliest stages of the outbreak in Wuhan, and the controversy and/or challenges regarding its initial management.",

Interestingly, the anesthesiologist in that case, who wore a powered air-purifying respirator (PAPR), was not infected. As we acknowledged in our Letter, 1 anecdotes and personal communications alone cannot provide the definitive evidence we need to make the best decisions regarding PPE in these cases. However, we feel it is unwise to ignore the evidence we do have: that viral load is high within the nasal cavity, that when performing endoscopic surgery we are working within and through that corridor, and that surgical maneuvers can aerosolize mucus particles along with any virus therein.",

While we agree there is no hard data at this point proving that endonasal surgery in COVID-19 patients can cause widespread infection of operating room personnel, we feel that until further evidence becomes available the recommended precautions should remain in place: COVID-19 testing should be performed when possible, PPE should be employed for all endoscopic cases and for all involved personnel, surgery should be delayed when possible, consideration should be given to transcranial approaches for certain locations where possible, and PAPR use should be encouraged in the rare occurrence of a symptomatic COVID-19positive patient needing emergent endonasal surgery.",
