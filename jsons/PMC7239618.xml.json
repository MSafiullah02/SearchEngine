Most of the initially identified patients were geographically linked to a local wet seafood wholesale market, where living or slaughtered wild animals are sold. The virus then rapidly spread to over 200 countries and territories, resulting in 3 672 238 confirmed cases and 254 045 deaths globally according to a report released by WHO on May 7, 2020. Subsequent deep sequencing of lower respiratory tract samples identified a novel coronavirus distinct from the other strains of coronavirus known to infect humans, subsequently named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)\u2014a highly contagious virus that can be transmitted from person to person.1 WHO designated the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection as COVID-19. Similar to other diseases caused by coronaviruses, the main transmission route of SARS-CoV-2 is via aerosolised droplets. Other possible transmission routes such as direct contact, oral\u2013faecal route, and mother-to-child transmission have been proposed, but further proof is needed with regard to these.2 A retrospective study done at the beginning of the pandemic reported an incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 of approximately 5\u201314 days;3 however, a more recent report indicates that the incubation period could be as long as 24 days.4\n",

Although multiple anti-viral drugs, including remdesivir and lopinavir plus ritonavir, have been used in clinical practice,5, 6 the safety and efficacy of these are still unclear and are under clinical evaluation. Immune-mediated lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) are associated with adverse outcomes in patients with COVID-19.7 Histological examination of lung biopsy tissue from a patient who died of COVID-19 showed bilateral diffuse alveolar damage and fibroblastic proliferation in airspaces, and laboratory tests indicated a hyperactivated status of circulating CD4 and CD8 lymphocytes.7, 8 Due to the hyperactive nature of the immune system in some patients with severe COVID-19, several disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs), such as tocilizumab (interleukin [IL]-6 receptor inhibitor), baricitinib (Janus kinase [JAK] inhibitor), anakinra (IL-1 receptor antagonist), and the antimalarial drug hydroxychloroquine (or chloroquine), have been proposed as potential treatments for COVID-19. In this Review, we discuss the immunological aspects of the SARS-CoV-2 virus infection and the potential implication of DMARDs in the treatment of patients with COVID-19.",

            "text": "Coronaviruses are a group of highly diverse, enveloped, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA viruses that belong to two subfamilies, Coronavirinae and Torovirinae, in the family of Coronaviridae. These viruses were first discovered in the 1960s and can be further classified into four main genera: Alphacoronavirus, Betacoronavirus, Gammacoronavirus, and Deltacoronavirus, on the basis of their phylogenetic relationships and genomic structures.9 Among these four genera, alphacoronaviruses and betacoronaviruses primarily cause respiratory and intestinal infection in mammals, whereas gammacoronaviruses and deltacoronaviruses mainly infect birds. Currently, there are seven strains of coronaviruses that are known to infect humans, including the recently identified SARS-CoV-2, human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E), OC43 (HCoV-OC43), NL63 (HCoV-NL63), HKU1 (HCoV-HKU1), severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV).10, 11, 12 Domestic or wild animals could have important roles as zoonotic reservoirs that enable virus transmission to humans. On the basis of current sequence databases, the origins of SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E, and SARS-CoV-2 are thought to be bats, whereas HCoV-OC43 and HKU1 probably originated from rodents.13, 14, 15, 16, 17 Although most coronavirus infections cause only mild respiratory symptoms, infection with SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 can be lethal.",

Viral infection of mammals activates intracellular pattern recognition receptors that sense pathogen-associated molecular patterns, such as double-stranded RNA or uncapped mRNA. The recognition of pathogen-associated molecular patterns results in subsequent cytolytic immune responses, mainly through the type I interferons (IFN) and natural killer cells. Adaptive immunity also plays an important part in viral clearance via activated cytotoxic T cells that destroy virus-infected cells and antibody-producing B cells that target virus-specific antigens. Patients with COVID-19, especially those with severe pneumonia, are reported to have substantially lower lymphocyte counts and higher plasma concentrations of a number of inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF).27, 29, 30 Another study29 reported that CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, and natural killer cells were reduced in severely ill patients compared with those with mild disease symptoms. Moreover, a substantial reduction of CD4+ T cell and CD8+ T cell counts in the peripheral blood was also observed in a patient who died.7 Notably, the proinflammatory subsets of T cells, including IL-17-producing CCR4+ CCR6+ CD4+ (T-helper 17 or Th17) cells and perforin and granulysin-expressing cytotoxic T cells were increased, which could be partly responsible for the severe immune injury in the lungs of this patient.7\n",

In fact, in the late stages of coronavirus disease, including SARS, MERS, and COVID-19, cytokine storms are a major cause of disease progression and eventual death.7, 32, 33 Huang and colleagues27 found increased plasma concentrations of both Th1 (eg, IL-1\u03b2 and IFN\u03b3) and Th2 (eg, IL-10) cytokines. Notably, patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) had higher plasma concentrations of IL-2, IL-7, IL-10, granulocyte-colony stimulating factor, IFN\u03b3-induced protein-10 (IP-10), macrophage chemoattractant protein-1, macrophage inflammatory protein 1\u03b1, and TNF compared to those not admitted to the ICU. Two other studies29, 34 also showed that plasma IL-6 concentrations were above the normal range in patients with severe symptoms of COVID-19 compared with healthy individuals and those with milder symptoms. Mehta and colleagues35 suggest that secondary haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (sHLH) could be associated with severe COVID-19 cases. HLH is a disease entity characterised by an uncontrolled cytokine storm and expansion of tissue macrophages or histiocytes that exhibit haemophagocytic activity.36 HLH can result from genetic defects in cytolytic pathways (familial or primary HLH) or other diseases such as infection, malignancy, and rheumatic disease (sHLH).37 In 1952, Farquhar and Claireaux first described cytokine storm in patients with HLH.38 The characteristics of HLH, including hypercytokinaemia, unremitting fever, cytopenias, hyperferritinaemia, and multi-organ damage, are commonly seen in seriously ill patients with COVID-19.27, 35 It is suggested that alveolar macrophages expressing ACE2 are the primary target cells for SARS-CoV-2 infection. These activated macrophages may play an important part in HLH-like cytokine storm during COVID-19.39 Thus, early identification and appropriate treatment of this hyperinflammatory status is important for reducing the mortality of patients with COVID-19. 35\n",

If the virus continues to mutate to lower its pathogenicity, there is a high possibility that it might coexist with humans. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop therapies to treat SARS-CoV-2. Repurposing of approved drugs is commonly employed to fight against newly emerged diseases, such as COVID-19, as these drugs have known pharmacokinetic and safety profiles. Due to the importance of immune imbalance in the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 infection, several immune-modulating drugs that regulate different aspects of inflammation (table\n) are being tested for their efficacy in the treatment of severe COVID-19. Hyperinflammation is an important determinant of disease outcome in COVID-19, and immunosuppression might be beneficial to reduce the mortality in patients with severe symptoms.7, 35 Therefore, early identification of such patients is crucial. It has been proposed that laboratory tests of ferritin, lymphocyte or leukocyte counts, platelet counts, erythrocyte counts, and sedimentation rate could be used to screen patients at high risk of hyperinflammation. Application of the HScore, used for the evaluation of patients with sHLH, was recommended by Mehta and colleagues35 to identify patients with COVID-19 at high risk of hyperinflammation. The HScore combines both laboratory and clinical parameters, including serum aspartate aminotransferase, triglycerides, fibrinogen, ferritin, cytopaenias, body temperature, organomegaly, haemophagocytosis on bone marrow aspirate, and signs of immunosuppression.35 In addition, evaluation of cytokine profiles and immune cell subsets has important implications for selecting appropriate immunosuppressants (eg, tocilizumab could be considered in patients with high concentrations of serum IL-6). Given the fact that anti-viral immunity is required to recover from COVID-19, the pros and cons of using an immunosuppressant on these patients should be carefully considered. The severity of the hyperinflammation and viral load or replication status needs to be taken into consideration. One way to avoid the suppression of anti-viral immunity is to choose selective instead of broad immunosuppressive drugs. The timing of treatment is also crucial to reduce the side-effects of immunosuppression; unfortunately there is not yet any definitive evidence with regard to the appropriate timing of administration of these agents. Further studies are required to determine the appropriate timing and routes of drug administration.",

In terms of mechanism, tocilizumab binds to both the membrane and soluble forms of IL-6 receptor, thereby suppressing the JAK-signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) signalling pathway and production of downstream inflammatory molecules.42, 43 There are many ongoing trials assessing the efficacy of tocilizumab in COVID-19 (appendix p 1). However, animal studies have shown that IL-6 is required for the clearance of viruses and control of pulmonary inflammation.44 Therefore, clinicians should pay close attention to the possibility that blocking IL-6 could interfere with viral clearance or exacerbate lung inflammation. A recent observational study45 from China reported that tocilizumab treatment in severe COVID-19 cases resulted in improvement in COVID-19 symptoms, peripheral oxygen saturation, and lymphopenia within a few days. A substantial remission of lung lesion opacity in chest CT scan was observed in 95% of patients (19 of 20) after 5 days of treatment, and all patients were discharged after an average of 15.1 days of hospital stay.45\n",

Since IL-1 was reported to be increased in some patients with COVID-19,27 blockade of IL-1 seems a reasonable approach for the treatment of hyperinflammation in these patients.35 Several trials of anakinra are currently underway, including a phase 2/3 clinical trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of anakinra and emapalumab (IFN\u03b3 inhibitor) in reducing hyperinflammation and respiratory distress in patients with COVID-19 (NCT04324021; appendix p 1).",

Baricitinib can be used in combination with one or more TNF inhibitors and is approved for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis48 and psoriatic arthritis.49 Through searching the BenevolentAI database, Richardson and colleagues50 predicted that baricitinib might effectively reduce the ability of SARS-CoV-2 virus to infect lung cells.51 As noted, SARS-CoV-2 binds to the ACE2 receptor on host cells and enters lung cells through receptor-mediated endocytosis. ACE2 is widely expressed in several tissues, including renal, vascular, heart, and lung. High concentrations of ACE2 expression on pulmonary AT2 alveolar epithelial cells makes these cells particularly susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection.52 AP2-associated protein kinase 1 (AAK1) regulates endocytosis via phosphorylation of the clathrin adaptor protein AP2. Richardson and colleagues identified six high-affinity AAK1 inhibitors from 47 clinical candidates in the BenevolentAI database. Baricitinib was then further selected based on its relatively mild side-effects and the feasibility to achieve effective concentrations in the blood. In addition, baricitinib can also bind to cyclin G-related kinases, which also regulate receptor-mediated endocytosis. The immunosuppressive function of baricitinib might also be of benefit to the hyperactive immune status in severe cases of COVID-19 where immune-mediated lung injury and ARDS might occur.",

Hydroxychloroquine has been used to treat HIV-1 in humans as early as the 1990s. In a randomised, double-blinded, placebo-controlled clinical trial of 40 asymptomatic patients with HIV-1, 800 mg/d hydroxychloroquine treatment for 8 weeks reduced the plasma concentration of HIV-1 RNA, preserved CD4+ T-cell counts and proliferative responses, and lowered serum IL-6 concentrations, compared with the placebo group.63 Although it takes 1\u20133 months for hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine to fully take effect in patients with rheumatic disease, the drugs' anti-viral effect is relatively rapid. Hydroxychloroquine treatment as short as 3 days was shown to accelerate virus clearance in patients with COVID-19, and azithromycin reinforced the anti-viral effect.64 There are a number of ongoing clinical trials testing the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine in COVID-19 (appendix pp 2\u20135). Although a recent randomised trial has shown that chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine might improve pneumonia symptoms, laboratory tests, and decrease the progression to severe or critical conditions,65 other studies reported either no benefits66, 67, 68 or hazardous effects after chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine treatment.69Notably, treatment in patients with COVID-19 might cause cardiotoxicity, especially when used at a high dose.70, 71 Therefore, results from ongoing trials are required to assess the efficacy and safety of hydroxychloroquine in COVID-19.",

In vitro studies have shown that the active metabolite of leflunomide (A77 1726) protects umbilical cord epithelial cells and fibroblasts from infection with human cytomegalovirus.80, 86 Electron microscopy revealed that the morphology of virions in the cytoplasm was abnormal and the assembly of virus particles could not be completed in cytomegalovirus-infected cells treated with A77 1726, indicating that leflunomide interferes with the assembly of virus capsid.80 In a study87 of 17 patients with cytomegalovirus disease, 88% (15) of the patients clinically responded to leflunomide therapy (3 doses of 100 mg/day, followed by 20 mg/day\u2014a dose that maintains blood concentrations of 25\u201350 ng/mL), with viral clearance from blood and healing of involved organs.

However, it is worth noting that leflunomide has been associated with interstitial lung disease.91, 92 Leflunomide-associated interstitial lung disease usually occurs within the first 20 weeks of leflunomide initiation. There was a high mortality in patients with pre-existing interstitial lung disease, diffuse alveolar damage, or ground glass shadowing on high resolution CT.91 The exact mechanism remains unclear, but the presence of pre-existing interstitial lung disease, cigarette smoking, low bodyweight, and the use of methotrexate are risk factors for leflunomide-induced interstitial lung disease.92 It remains unclear if leflunomide would improve or exacerbate the pulmonary lesions in patients with COVID-19. There is currently one clinical trial aiming to evaluate the efficacy and safety of oral leflunomide tablets against pneumonia caused by SARS-CoV-2 (appendix p 2).",

Animal studies have shown that thalidomide inhibits lung injury in mouse models of H1N1 influenza virus infection, with improved survival, reduced inflammatory cell infiltration, reduced concentrations of cytokines (IL-6 and TNF) and chemokines (RANTES and IP-10), and reduced nuclear factor kappa beta activity.93 It was concluded that thalidomide could be an alternative treatment when new influenza viruses emerge, especially before new vaccines are developed. A UK study94 indicated that thalidomide has immunomodulatory and immune remodelling effects by inhibiting TNF, another critical cytokine in COVID-19-associated lung injury. In addition, some studies have shown that thalidomide can treat pulmonary interstitial fibrosis and combat cytokine storm.95, 96 These studies indicate a potential therapeutic value of thalidomide in viral infection. In a case report,97 a 45-year-old female patient with severe COVID-19 and elevated concentrations of circulating cytokines, including IL-6, IL-10, and IFN\u03b3, on admission was treated with oral thalidomide (100 mg once a day) and low-dose methylprednisolone (40 mg intravenously, every 12 h for 3 days; and then 40 mg intravenously once a day for 5 days) due to the severity of clinical manifestations and lack of response to other treatments. The patient's clinical condition, including oxygen index, fever, nausea, and vomiting resolved within 1 week after thalidomide treatment. Concentrations of IL-6, IL-10, and IFN\u03b3 all returned to normal range after 6 days of treatment, SARS-CoV-2 tests in swab specimens were negative after 1 week of treatment, and lung lesions disappeared 12 days after treatment.97 Although this is a single case, it could provide some useful insight for further clinical investigation. There are two clinical trials evaluating the therapeutic potential of thalidomide in patients with moderate or severe COVID-19 (appendix p 2).",

            "text": "SARS-CoV-2 has spread rapidly since it first emerged in December, 2019, and COVID-19 is characterised as a pandemic by WHO. As a new emerging virus, there is no approved effective drug or vaccine. As of April 16, 2020, several existing drugs are being repurposed for the treatment of patients with COVID-19, with dozens of ongoing clinical trials assessing their potential efficacy. DMARDs, due to their immune-modulating nature, could be a potential treatment option for severe COVID-19. However, there are several issues that need to be taken into consideration. First, the issue of hyperinflammation versus viral replication. Although effective anti-viral immunity is required for the clearance of pathogens, hyperactivation of immune response causes tissue damage and organ failure. Similarly, there are two sides of immunomodulation therapy in COVID-19, and clinicians should determine in which circumstance to use such medications. Second, there are questions about the timing for immunomodulation therapy. As noted, immunosuppressants could affect anti-viral immune response and the timing should be carefully considered. Although early intervention is considered as a key factor for the success of immunomodulation therapy in infection-associated hyperinflammation,103 direct evidence from RCTs are required to determine the appropriate timing for patients with COVID-19. Finally, the pharmacokinetics of oral medications in crucially ill patients merit consideration, as physiological alterations in these patients can substantially affect the pharmacokinetics. Some drugs will need to be given parenterally due to gastrointestinal failure (eg, chloroquine has been used parenterally to treat severely ill patients with malaria, although it is absorbed reliably in these patients).104 Compared with the oral route, parenteral administration of chloroquine results in rapid absorption and transient high plasma concentrations, which is associated with increased risk of acute toxicity.105 In addition, impaired clearance of the drugs might be problematic in patients with hepatic dysfunction and renal failure. Therefore, smaller and more frequent doses, continuous intravenous infusion, or choosing a less toxic drug (eg, using hydroxychloroquine instead of chloroquine) should be considered in patients who are severely ill.104, 105 The many ongoing trials will hopefully provide a better understanding of the potential effects of immunomodulation therapy on COVID-19-associated hyperinflammation.",
