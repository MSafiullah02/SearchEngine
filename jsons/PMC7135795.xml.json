The EBER probe was labeled with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC). The detection of the hybridization products was achieved by using the Novocastra universal detection system.

[16] have observed a small number of B lymphocytes in the nasopharynx that work as a reservoir to EBV, comparing tissue samples from patients with suspected nasopharyngeal carcinoma and non-neoplastic tissue samples from adenoid. Ikeda et al. [10] have studied normal tonsils and have concluded that the tonsillar lymphocytes have the function of a reservoir and a place of EBV replication. In spite of the suggestion that EBV may be involved in adenoid hypertrophy, there are few large-scale studies on the presence of EBV in adenoid and tonsillar tissue simultaneously.",

We know that adenoid tissue grows mainly between 3 and 5 years of age. Adenoid hyperplasia under 24 months of age is uncommon, and this fact is not yet very well studied. For this reason, we have divided our patients into two groups; one with patients between 12 and 24 months and the other, with patients older than 25 months. We found 34.3% of adenoid tissue with EBV-positive cells in the first group.

Some authors have demonstrated that EBV is equally distributed in the Waldeyer's ring; however, this is not in agreement with our findings. Considering the intensity of positiveness, there were no significant differences. EBV was found in the tonsillar parenchyma and in the parafollicular region, or inside the germinal center. It was also found in the adenoid epithelium, though rarely.",
