Of these, rotavirus A (RVA) is genetically and antigenically the most diverse species within the genus (Matthijnssens and Desselberger, 2012), although more recent data also show a significant diversity in VP7 of rotavirus B and C strains in pigs (Martella et al., 2007b, Marthaler et al., 2012). In addition, RVAs are the most important due to their high prevalence and pathogenicity in humans and a variety of animals. The genome of RVA consists of 11 segments of double-stranded RNA enclosed in a triple-layered virus particle, and encodes six structural (VP1\u2013VP4, VP6, and VP7) and five or six nonstructural proteins (NSP1\u2013NSP6). A binary classification system reminiscent of the one used to classify influenza viruses has been established to characterize the two outer capsid proteins, VP4 and VP7, which independently elicit neutralizing antibodies. Thus, RVA strains are classified into VP4 or P types (for protease-sensitive) and VP7 or G types (for glycoprotein) (Estes and Kapikian, 2007). Thus far, at least 27 G types and 35 P types have been described, many of these identified in the last 5 years (Matthijnssens et al., 2011).",

            "text": "The diversity of RVA strains is mainly increased by accumulation of point mutations leading to genetic/antigenic drift and reassortment of cognate genes leading to genetic/antigenic shift (Matthijnssens and Desselberger, 2012). An additional important evolutionary mechanism is interspecies transmission, occurring when a RVA strain is able to infect a heterologous host species. This is often coupled with reassortment of cognate genes (Martella et al., 2010). In cattle, RVA strains belonging to at least 12 G types (G1\u2013G3, G5, G6, G8, G10, G11, G15, G17, G21, and G24) and 11 P types (P[1], P[3], P[5\u20137], P[11], P[14], P[17], P[21], P[29], and P[33]) have been identified. Bovine RVA strains belonging to G6, G8, and G10, in association with P[1], P[5], and P[11], are commonly found in cattle, though strains belonging to G1\u2013G3, G5, and G11 and P[3], P[6], P[7], and P[14] have been detected sporadically. An unusual G17P[17] avian-like bovine RVA strain (Bo/993/83) has also been isolated from a calf, which is presumably the result of an interspecies transmission event from a bird RVA strain to a cow. In addition, bovine RVA strains with novel VP7 genotypes (G15, G21, and G24) and VP4 genotypes (P[21], P[29], and P[33]) have recently been identified (Matthijnssens et al., 2011). The most prevalent RVA strains found in pigs are G3, G4, G5, G9, and G11 in association with P[6] or P[7]. In addition, several VP7 types (G1, G2, G6, G8, G10, G12, and G26) and VP4 types (P[5], P[8], P[11], P[13], P[14], P[19], P[23], P[26], P[27], P[32], and P[34]) have been detected sporadically in pigs, bringing the total G and P types detected in swine to 12 and 13, respectively (Matthijnssens et al., 2011). Interestingly, several G and P types are shared between RVAs of these livestock animals and other host species, as indicated by molecular analysis of several RVA strains detected in horses, small ruminants or even birds (Martella et al., 2010). In addition, genotyping and phylogenetic analyses of rare human RVA strains have demonstrated on multiple occasions a close genetic relatedness to animal RVA strains (Gentsch et al., 2005, Matthijnssens et al., 2009a), and a comprehensive genetic analysis of all 11 genome segments revealed that the two major human genotype constellations, Wa-like and DS-1-like genogroups, have a common origin with porcine and bovine RVA strains, respectively (Matthijnssens et al., 2009b).",

In addition, porcine and bovine RVA strains are considered important pathogens in swine and cattle due to their economic impact on the swine and cattle industry. Therefore, understanding the molecular diversity of porcine and bovine RVA strains is important. In this study, we summarize the literature available on the prevalence and distribution of RVA G and P types until August 2011 in the two globally most important livestock animals, pigs and cattle, in order to provide baseline data following the concept delineated in a recent systematic review of human RVA strains (B\u00e1nyai et al., 2012). This semiquantitative assessment of the dynamics of swine and cattle RVA strains may help better understand the evolution and ecology of RVA and also might help formulize better vaccines by the selection of more adequate antigens that evoke stronger and wider cross immunity, and better match the co-circulating RVA strains in a particular region.",

In general, G5 was the most common porcine RVA genotype in all 4 continents (20.3\u201371.4%). The second and third most common porcine VP7 specificities of RVA strains were G4 (17.4%) and G3 (14.5%) in Europe, G4 (8.2%) and G11 (1.9%) in the Americas, G3 (25.5%) and G9 (11.4%) in Asia, and G3 (30.0%) and G4 (20.0%) in Australia. Concerning the P type specificities, P[7] was the most common in the Americas (77.2%) and Asia (41.7%), while this genotype was less common in Europe (13.2%). In contrast, genotypes P[6] (26.7%) and P[13] (13.2%) were more common in Europe. The P[6] genotype was the second most common P type in the Americas (12.1%) and Asia (9.9%).

ProSystems RCE is a bivalent live oral RVA vaccine which is commercially available for swine in the US; this vaccine contains strains OSU (G5P[7]) and Gottfried (G4P[6]), but recently, a third porcine RVA strain, A2 (G9P[7]) was also isolated from the vaccine (the vaccine also contains four major Escherichia coli pilus antigens (K88, K99, F41, and 987P) and Clostridium perfringens type C toxoid) (Saif and Fernandez, 1996). Guardian\u00ae is a multiple antigen vaccine, which includes a cell-free extract of K99 pilus type of E. coli, a unique combination of two inactivated coronaviruses, two bovine RVA strains, NCDV (G6P[1]) and UK (G6P[5]), and a bacterin-toxoid from C. perfringens types C and D (Saif and Fernandez, 1996). There are other veterinary rotavirus vaccines licensed for use in other geographic regions and many of these share the antigen composition with the above listed combination vaccines. For example, in Italy, Pfizer distributes combination vaccines, such as Scourguard 3 that includes rotavirus, coronavirus and K99 pilus type E. coli strains, or Scourguard 4KC that includes rotavirus, coronavirus, K99 pilus type E. coli strains and C. perfringens type C., while Merial offers Trivaction 6, which has been developed to confer protection simultaneously against rotavirus, coronavirus and various E. coli strains. However, little or no additional information is available about their usage and effectiveness against RVA in the field. Nonetheless commercial RVA vaccines are administered parenterally to cows and sows during the late stage of gestation, in order to elicit a strong maternal immunity that is readily conferred to newborn animals (Saif and Fernandez, 1996). Some studies have demonstrated vaccine failure or breakthroughs that have been related to a number of factors, including inadequate managing conditions of animals or antigenic differences between vaccine and field RVA strains, even if vaccine and field strains shared partially their surface antigen specificities (Saif and Fernandez, 1996; Supplementary Table plus References 62,99,116). Therefore, assessing precisely the prevalence of various VP7 and VP4 type specificities is required to evaluate adequately vaccine effectiveness and to understand whether or not it may be necessary to construct polyvalent RVA vaccines for livestock animals.",

Several antigen combinations of RVA are shared between humans and animals and it has been demonstrated that the 2 major genogroups of human RVAs, Wa-like and DS1-like, have a common origin with porcine and bovine RVA strains, respectively (Martella et al., 2010, Matthijnssens et al., 2008a, Matthijnssens et al., 2009a, B\u00e1nyai et al., 2012).

Also, a number of human RVA strains possessing a P[6] genotype closely resembling the VP4 of porcine RVA strains have been identified (B\u00e1nyai et al., 2004, B\u00e1nyai et al., 2009).

These studies revealed a sharp difference in the surveillance activity in humans and livestock. While characterization of human RVA strains has been intensified recently worldwide with over 110,000 genotyped RVA strains from 1996 to 2008, in swine and cattle a considerably lower number of strains were genotyped over the last 3 decades (porcine, ~1100; bovine, ~3200). The number of countries reporting RVA strain prevalence data for swine and cattle was fairly low, yet numerous new genotypes have been identified, mainly by research groups strongly motivated to investigate animal RVA molecular epidemiology.",

The existence of numerous individual G and P genotypes in both host species may serve as a basis for further strain diversity through reassortment, and the description of mixed antigen specificities in various studies suggests the background for such reassortment events are given. Regarding the less frequently isolated strains, mistyping can sometimes occur, probably due to variations in the nucleotide sequence within primer binding regions (Cashman et al., 2010, Garaicoechea et al., 2006). (ii) RVA strain prevalence changes over time in different locations in both pigs and calves and the recognized strain diversity increases as more efforts are implemented to characterize untypeable strains using sophisticated methods, primarily nucleotide sequencing. (iii) Although RVA strains are diverse in livestock animals, both pigs and calves had a particular predominant genotype combination: G5P[7] in pigs and G6P[5] in calves. The predominance of these strains was seen across continents over time although some fluctuation was also evident and in some locations the dominating strains were different from these two genotypes. (iv) Finally, given that G5P[7] and G6P[5] are shared with some vaccine strains used in swine and cattle, respectively, further studies are needed to elucidate more specifically the vaccine effectiveness in herds where these vaccines are used to confer passive immunity. It will be also important to determine if there are genetic or antigenic differences in the structure of surface antigens between vaccine strains and field strains causing disease in calves and pigs born to vaccinated cows and sows, respectively. However, as rotavirus vaccines may not be administered continuously in the majority of swine or cattle herds, assessment of strain specific effectiveness on either a herd or individual basis may be challenging.",

            "text": "Our study has several limitations partly inherent to the heterogeneity of the data, potential sampling artifacts, and studies analyzed in our search. For example, various detection and typing methods markedly differ in sensitivity and specificity, which might bias the result of certain studies reporting G and P type prevalence in pigs and cattle. These differences in typing methods are clearly illustrated by the relatively high rates of untypeable strains in both host species. Different animal breeds and different animal housing practices might further complicate the situation raising additional concerns regarding the conclusions of the delineated spatiotemporal dynamics of RVA strain prevalence. In several studies, RVA strains were characterized after isolation on cell culture; because various strains can be isolated at different efficiency, this could also have resulted in bias in the overall animal RVA strain prevalence and diversity. Although we tried to be liberal when we defined our study selection criteria some studies may have been overlooked during the review process lowering the totals of RVA strains with available type specificity data. RVA has both endemic and epidemic forms, particularly in swine herds; therefore, it is unclear whether detection of multiple strains may actually reflect strain diversity on a single farm when samples were pooled before laboratory process. Moreover, the number of countries providing relevant information was very low and most studies analyzed a selected small number of strains, thus an extrapolation of data to a wider geographic region may result in distortion in the true global strain prevalence in these animal populations. Similar pitfalls have been encountered during the review of human RVA strains (B\u00e1nyai et al., 2012). Also, we found limited information on vaccine use in settings where the analyzed studies were reported from; thus, any possible vaccine-associated pressure on RVA strain prevalence remained hidden.",

Despite the fact that relatively low number of countries have provided relevant data on bovine and porcine RVA strain prevalence and diversity, the extrapolations on the regional strain prevalence may be valid given that the same few G and P type specificities were identified to be dominating across countries and over decades. In particular, genotypes G5 and P[7] in swine, and G6, P[5], and P[11] in cattle, were found epizootically to be the most important. Synchronized RVA strain surveillance in humans and animals using standardized methods may provide important and relevant data on animal RVA strain prevalence to aid vaccination efforts and understand the health risk of human diseases caused by animal RVAs.",
