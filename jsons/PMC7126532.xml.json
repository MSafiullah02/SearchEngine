            "text": "Apoptosis is the programmed destruction of cells characterized by plasma membrane blebbing, cell shrinkage, nuclear condensation, and ultimately, degradation of genomic DNA. Apoptosis is induced by the activation of caspases (a family of cysteine proteases) through two different pathways (Shi, 2004, Sprick and Walczak, 2004) (Fig. 1\n). The intrinsic pathway is initiated when cellular stress is sensed by BH3-only proteins of the Bcl-2 family such as Bim, Bad, Puma and Noxa and leads to insertion of proapoptotic Bcl-2 family members such as Bax and Bak into the mitochondrial membrane (Breckenridge and Xue, 2004). The subsequent release of cytochrome c into the cytosol activates caspase-9 and results in formation of the apoptosome, a large protein complex comprised of cytochrome c along with Apaf-1 and caspase-9 (Liu et al., 1996, Zou et al., 1997, Narita et al., 1998, Srinivasula et al., 1998, Finucane et al., 1999). The apoptosome mediates the activation of caspase-3 and caspase-7 (Li et al., 1997), which execute the final stages of the apoptotic response, through degradation of many cellular proteins involved in DNA repair and maintenance of cellular architecture (Green, 2000). Optimal activation of this pathway also requires release of Smac/Diablo from the mitochondria along with cytochrome c. Smac/Diablo promotes apoptosis by relieving inhibition of caspase-3 and caspase-7 by inhibitors of apoptosis (IAPs) (Du et al., 2000, Srinivasula et al., 2000). The extrinsic pathway is activated by ligation of death domain-containing receptors such as Fas, TNF-R, and TRAIL-R, which leads to formation of the death-induced signaling complex (DISC). The DISC contains adaptor proteins such as Fas-associated death domain (FADD) and TNF-R-associated death domain (TRADD) and mediates the activation of the initiator caspase, caspase-8 (Juo et al., 1998). Caspase-8 activation has two different consequences depending on the cell type (Scaffidi et al., 1998). In some cells, caspase-8 activation results in direct activation of the apoptosis effectors, caspase-3 and caspase-7 (Scaffidi et al., 1998). In other cells, usually under conditions when extrinsic apoptotic signaling results in insufficient levels of caspase-8 activation, apoptosis requires amplification of death signals through stimulation of the mitochondrial pathway via the function of another BH3-only member of the Bcl-2 family, Bid (Wei et al., 2000, Zha et al., 2000).",

A critical feature of apoptosis is that it does not produce inflammation. Thus cellular turnover and removal during the biological processes described above can occur with minimal activation of the host immune response (Opferman and Korsmeyer, 2003, Zhivotovsky, 2003). This prevents immune-mediated damage to healthy tissues and limits exposure of self-antigens. In addition to its importance in development and physiology, apoptosis is also commonly observed following viral infection of host cells.",

Therefore, virtually every stage in the viral replication cycle can evoke cell death.

Three distinct stages of virus entry into cells are known to activate cell death pathways (Fig. 2\nand Table 1\n). First, apoptosis signaling can be initiated by binding of viruses to cell surface receptors. Second, apoptosis may be activated as a result of viral uncoating, either as a consequence of fusion between viral and host membranes, or due to membrane breach by nonenveloped viruses. Apoptosis also can occur as a consequence of exposure of viral components following disassembly. Third, prodeath signaling may be triggered by release of viral capsid components into the cytoplasm following successful entry of virus into cells. This review will focus on how these viral replication events that occur prior to de novo synthesis of viral genomes, mRNAs, or proteins evoke apoptotic cell death. Because the mechanisms that govern apoptosis following infection with each virus are not completely elucidated, the organization of the review is based on the most likely cell entry stage at which prodeath signaling is activated.",

This suggests that the envelope protein which functions in cell attachment and fusion-mediated entry, may directly contribute to cell killing. Clues about mechanisms by which the ALV Env protein contributes to cell death were obtained following identification of the cellular receptor for cytopathic ALV strains ALV-B and ALV-D by expression cloning methods (Brojatsch et al., 1996). Mouse cells that usually do not support infection by ALV were rendered permissive by expression of a cDNA encoding CAR1, a member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNF-R) family (Brojatsch et al., 1996). These findings, along with evidence for direct interaction of CAR1 with the surface (Su) subunit of ALV Env, indicate that CAR1 serves as a receptor for ALV (Brojatsch et al., 1996). Based on the evidence for the function of TNF-R family members in apoptosis, the capacity of ALV to induce cell death following CAR1 engagement was assessed. Soluble ALV-B-derived Su was capable of inducing apoptosis in a CAR-1 dependent manner (Brojatsch et al., 1996). These findings indicate that attachment of cytopathic ALV strains to CAR-1 results in apoptosis. Although the precise pathway to cell death evoked following CAR-1 ligation remains undefined, it is likely similar to proapoptotic signaling following attachment of death ligands with members of the TNFR family (Lavrik et al., 2005).",

            "text": "Apoptosis induction following BHV-1 infection of peripheral blood mononuclear cells or bovine B lymphoma cells also may be dependent on receptor binding. Initial investigation into the mechanism by which BHV-1 induces apoptosis indicated that BHV-1 virions inactivated by photochemical treatment with trioxsalen and UV irradiation remained capable of inducing apoptosis (Hanon et al., 1996). These findings suggested that early steps in viral infection, namely attachment to cells, fusion of viral and host membranes, or viral uncoating were sufficient to drive the death response. A mutant BHV-1, deficient in gH, an envelope glycoprotein dispensable for cell attachment but required for cell penetration, was found to be fully capable of eliciting apoptosis (Hanon et al., 1998). These findings suggest that death signaling following BHV-1 infection requires virus attachment but not penetration. Moreover, these findings indicated that BHV-1 glycoproteins other than gH are required for induction of cell death. To identify the viral trigger for apoptosis, the apoptosis-inducing capacity of a gD-deficient mutant was analyzed (Hanon et al., 1999). Although this virus was capable of efficiently attaching to cells, it failed to induce apoptosis, suggesting a function of gD in BHV-1-induced apoptosis (Hanon et al., 1999). These findings indicate that engagement of one or more cell surface molecules by gD is required for BHV-1-induced apoptosis. Purified gD, was incapable of inducing apoptosis although it could prevent BHV-1-induced apoptosis likely by competing for virus attachment (Hanon et al., 1999). These findings suggest that gD alone is not sufficient for apoptosis. However, it is also possible that gD fails to induce apoptosis in its purified form due to its inability to crosslink receptors in a manner analogous to binding by intact BHV-1 virions. The precise mechanism by which attachment of BHV-1 evokes death signaling remains unknown. Based on evidence from related herpes simplex virus (HSV-1), whose gD protein binds the TNF-R family member HVEM (Montgomery et al., 1996), it is hypothesized that death signaling pathways may be directly activated by virus-receptor interactions. However, experimental evidence to support this idea is lacking.",

To determine the physiologic consequence of the observed PVR mutation, the capacity of the mutant receptor to mediate poliovirus infection in non-permissive cells was assessed. Although the mutant receptor supported poliovirus attachment and infection to the same extent as the wild-type receptor, cells expressing the mutant receptor displayed a markedly lower level of apoptosis (Gosselin et al., 2003). These findings suggest a function of PVR in poliovirus-induced apoptosis. It is not known how PVR contributes to poliovirus-induced cell death. One possibility is that poliovirus-PVR interaction triggers death signaling through PVR (Gosselin et al., 2003). However, since virus attachment appears to be unaffected in cells expressing mutant receptors, it is not clear how a mutation in the PVR membrane-distal domain can influence proapoptotic signaling. Another possibility is that PVR interacts with host molecules involved in prodeath signaling. Determining the physiologic function of PVR and studies using cytoplasmic tail-deleted PVR molecules, which are known to support poliovirus infection (Freistadt and Racaniello, 1991), or analysis of PVR-associated proteins such as CD44 (Shepley and Racaniello, 1994, Freistadt and Eberle, 1997) may help address these questions. Regardless of the mechanism, c-Jun N terminal kinase (JNK)-mediated activation of the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway is required for poliovirus-induced apoptosis (Autret et al., 2007). JNK activation promotes release of cytochrome c and results in loss of mitochondrial membrane potential in a Bid- and Bim-independent but Bax-dependent manner (Autret et al., 2007). Interestingly, although UV-inactivated poliovirus can activate JNK, it fails to induce apoptosis (Autret et al., 2008). These findings suggest that poliovirus-PVR interaction is sufficient to activate JNK signaling. In addition, these results indicate that steps in the poliovirus replication cycle that occur subsequent to receptor engagement work in concert with signaling pathways initiated by virus attachment to induce apoptosis. These steps could include expression of poliovirus proteases 2A and 3C following translation of viral RNA. Ectopic expression of these viral proteases induces apoptosis, likely by cleaving cellular molecules involved in host transcription and translation (Barco et al., 2000, Goldstaub et al., 2000, Calandria et al., 2004).",

Although productive poliovirus infection of HeLa cells does not evoke apoptosis, blockade of poliovirus infection prior to viral protein synthesis results in apoptosis (Tolskaya et al., 1995). Based on these findings, it has been proposed that the initial stages of poliovirus infection, which occur prior to translation of the incoming viral genome evoke prodeath signaling, whereas synthesis of viral proteins blocks apoptosis (Agol et al., 2000). While it remains unclear why different research groups observed incongruent requirements for apoptosis, a simple explanation for this finding could be that poliovirus utilizes distinct mechanisms to induce apoptosis in different cell types. Thus it is possible that for each cell type, the outcome of poliovirus infection is dependent on the balance between the strength of pro- and antiapoptotic signaling.",

Following delivery into endosomes, Sindbis virus envelope glycoproteins undergo low-pH-dependent conformational changes (Bron et al., 1993). Fusion of host and viral membranes by these conformationally altered glycoproteins requires the presence of sphingomyelin in host cell membranes (Nieva et al., 1994). During entry into cells, Sindbis virus rapidly activates acid sphingomyelinase leading to the generation of ceramide (Jan et al., 2000). The initial increase in ceramide is sustained by activation of neutral sphingomyelinase at later times following infection (Jan et al., 2000). Decreasing intracellular ceramide levels by overexpression of ceramidase results in diminishment of apoptosis (Jan et al., 2000). Based on these findings, and the function of ceramide in inducing apoptosis following exposure to other stimuli (Pettus et al., 2002), it is thought that ceramide generation by activation of sphingomylinases during entry stimulates prodeath signaling in Sindbis virus-infected cells (Jan et al., 2000).",

Consistent with this idea, native Sindbis virus particles elicit greater cytopathology than Sindbis replicons that lack viral structural proteins (Frolov and Schlesinger, 1994). Furthermore, ectopic expression of envelope glycoproteins, E1 or E2, or their transmembrane domains alone induces apoptosis (Joe et al., 1998), suggesting that the transmembrane domains of E1 and E2 may directly interact with acid sphingomyelinases to induce their activation during fusion (Joe et al., 1998). Further studies are needed to determine if E1 or E2 contribute to death signaling during cell entry and to delineate molecular mechanisms underlying the activation sphingomyelinases. It is unknown how ceramide accumulation leads to cell death following infection with Sindbis virus. Pharmacologic inhibitors that block the function of ceramide targets such as protein kinases and phosphatases diminish apoptosis suggesting the importance of protein phosphorylation in Sindbis virus-induced cell death (Jan et al., 2000). However, since these inhibitors target a wide variety of molecules, the precise signaling cascade stimulated by ceramide is not known. Other studies also have indicated a function for reactive oxygen species and transcription factor NF-\u03baB in cell death signaling following Sindbis virus infection (Lin et al., 1995). However, the relationship between these pathways and ceramide-induced death signaling remains unknown.",

For ARV, initial studies suggested that the apoptosis inducing-factor could be viral attachment protein \u03c3C, which unlike its mammalian reovirus (MRV) counterpart \u03c31, induces apoptosis following ectopic expression (Shih et al., 2004, Coffey et al., 2006). However, subsequent studies demonstrated that initiation of signaling pathways that contribute to \u03c3C-induced apoptosis require viral replication (Ping-Yuan et al., 2006), suggesting that \u03c3C may induce apoptosis at a later stage of infection. Thus, the viral intermediary that connects ARV entry steps to the cell death machinery remains undefined. How BTV infection results in apoptosis is much better defined. Ectopic expression of either viral attachment protein VP2, or the viral entry effector VP5 does not result in apoptosis (Mortola et al., 2004, Roy, 2005, Forzan et al., 2007). Interestingly, extracellular co-administration of VP2 and VP5, which likely results in uptake of VP2-VP5 complexes into the endosomes, induces apoptosis (Mortola et al., 2004). These findings indicate the function of these capsid components in the endosome triggers apoptosis. Apoptosis induction by bluetongue virus requires signaling via JNK and the activation of transcription factor NF-\u03baB (Mortola et al., 2004, Mortola and Larsen, 2010). The similarity in the requirement for the function of the membrane penetration protein and for signaling via JNK and NF-\u03baB for both bluetongue virus and MRV (as described below) suggests that these two viruses share a common strategy for apoptosis induction. However, further work is needed to determine if this is indeed the case.",

Analogous to viruses that appear to initiate proapoptotic signaling during uncoating steps within cellular endosomes, ASFV-induced apoptosis is blocked by lysomotropic agents that block virus entry but unaffected by agents that interfere with DNA or protein synthesis (Carrascosa et al., 2002). These data implicate steps associated with ASFV entry in the induction of apoptosis. Following low pH-driven fusion of viral and host membranes, the viral nucleocapsid deposited into the cytoplasm is transported along microtubules to the perinuclear region for replication. Microtubule-dependent transport of the nucleocapsid to the perinuclear region requires viral protein p54, which binds directly to the light chain of cytoplasmic dynein (Alonso et al., 2001). Because virus transport to the perinuclear region also would be blocked by lysomotropic agents, but not affected by pharmacologic inhibitors that block viral DNA and protein synthesis, it is possible that these cytosolic events contribute to initiation of death signaling following ASFV infection.",

It is not clear if a similar interaction between p54 and dynein early during ASFV infection contributes to apoptosis. How p54-dynein interaction leads to apoptosis also remains unknown. Bim, a propapoptotic BH3-only member of the Bcl-2 family (O'Connor et al., 1998), is translocated to the mitochondria following ASFV infection (Hernaez et al., 2004). Interestingly, in its inactive state, Bim is associated with microtubules via its interaction with dynein light chain using a binding site very similar to ASFV p54 (Puthalakath et al., 1999, Hernaez et al., 2004). These findings raise the possibility that p54 induces apoptosis by displacing Bim from the microtubules, which results in its relocalization to mitochondria leading to activation of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway. Although Bim is relocalized from microtubules to mitochondria during ASFV infection (Hernaez et al., 2004), whether this relocalization is a consequence of p54-dynein interaction remains to be determined.",

Introduction of single amino acid substitutions into the central \u03b4 region of \u03bc1 decreases the capacity of the resultant mutant viruses to effect membrane penetration, mobilize NF-\u03baB, and evoke apoptosis (Danthi et al., 2008b). These findings suggest that the membrane-penetration and apoptosis-induction functions of \u03bc1 are linked and that the \u03b4 region of \u03bc1 is an essential modulator of both processes (Danthi et al., 2008b). It is possible that membrane penetration directly initiates proapoptotic signals. Alternatively, membrane penetration might allow delivery of the \u03bc1 cleavage fragments into the cytoplasm where prodeath signaling is elicited. Two lines of evidence support the latter possibility. First, plasmid-driven expression of the \u03bc1 C-terminal \u03d5 domain in the cytoplasm is sufficient to induce apoptosis (Coffey et al., 2006). Second, recombinant viruses with engineered substitutions in \u03d5 are diminished in NF-\u03baB activation and apoptosis induction (Danthi et al., 2008a). Importantly, a membrane-penetration-proficient \u03d5 mutant is impaired in the capacity to activate prodeath signaling, indicating that \u03d5 modulates apoptosis independent of an effect on membrane penetration (Danthi et al., 2008a). Based on these findings, delivery of \u03d5 to the cytoplasm subsequent to membrane penetration may initiate prodeath signaling following MRV infection (Danthi et al., 2008a).",

In addition to NF-\u03baB signaling, MEKK1-mediated activation of JNK signaling also is required for activating the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway (Yujiri et al., 2000, Clarke et al., 2001, Clarke et al., 2004). While the \u03bc1-encoding M2 gene segment also has been implicated in regulating JNK signaling (Clarke et al., 2001), the mechanism by which viral proteins initiate this signaling cascade also remains undefined. The innate immune transcription factor IRF-3 also contributes to proapoptotic signaling following MRV infection (Holm et al., 2007). Activation of IRF-3 requires the detection of genomic dsRNA by RIG-I and MDA-5 (Holm et al., 2007, Loo et al., 2008), and also occurs during virus entry independent of de novo synthesis of viral RNA (Holm et al., 2007). Since MRV genomic dsRNA is thought to remain encapsidated in viral cores throughout the viral infectious cycle, how it is exposed to cellular sensors such as RIG-I and MDA-5 to initiate signaling pathways that contribute to prodeath signaling via IRF-3 remains unknown. Although a function for IRF-3 in apoptosis induction has been defined for other systems (Chattopadhyay et al., 2010), how IRF-3 modulates the cellular death machinery following MRV infection is not clear.",

            "text": "For a complete understanding of virus host interactions that lead to apoptosis, it is important to know the identity and nature of viral factors that initiate the death response and its cellular binding partners. Other than apoptosis induced by virus-receptor interaction, knowledge about a viral trigger for apoptosis and its host target is either incomplete or unknown. For apoptosis initiated as a consequence of virus-receptor engagement, the viral attachment protein (Env for ASLV) or a structural feature (the canyon region for poliovirus) is important for binding to its cell surface receptor (Brojatsch et al., 1996, Belnap et al., 2000). When apoptosis is initiated during uncoating within endosomes, it is possible that a specific viral factor initiates a death response by binding to an as yet unknown endosomal host factor. Alternatively, proapoptotic signaling may be initiated by cell stress produced due to changes in membrane properties as a consequence of membrane fusion or membrane rupture. Apoptosis induction subsequent to membrane invasion is dependent on a specific viral factor (ASFV p54 and MRV \u03d5) (Hernaez et al., 2004, Danthi et al., 2008a). However, it remains unknown if these factors evoke prodeath signaling by directly binding a specific host factor resident in the cytoplasm (such as dynein for ASFV p54) or by injuring cellular organelles such as mitochondria (as has been suggested for MRV \u03d5)(Coffey et al., 2006, Danthi et al., 2008a, Wisniewski et al., 2010).",

In many cases, viral components initiate cell death signaling by binding to cellular factors not known to directly play a role in death signaling (such as poliovirus attachment to PVR). In others, viruses appear to activate death signaling from within endosomes, which are not usually known to contain components of the death machinery. In many of these cases, initiation of death signaling appears to be indirect. For example, acid sphingomylinase activity stimulated as a result of Sindbis virus uncoating in endosomes initiates a signaling cascade requiring kinases and phosphatases (Jan et al., 2000). Although the nature of these signaling pathways is unclear, it possible that such kinases and phosphatases activate death signaling by directly interfacing with a critical component regulating initiator or effector caspase activity (Kurokawa and Kornbluth, 2009). For some viruses, indirect activation of death signaling may require de novo expression of host genes. For example, MRV-induced death signaling is dependent on activity of NF-\u03baB (Connolly et al., 2000, Hansberger et al., 2007, Danthi et al., 2010b). Further studies are needed to define how host proteins that detect viral components initiate a signaling cascade that culminates in cell death.",

            "text": "Apoptosis induction by many of the viruses described above is only evident when infection is initiated at high multiplicity (Joe et al., 1998, Connolly and Dermody, 2002, Danthi et al., 2006). Because of this requirement, apoptosis evoked by this mechanism is often considered to be an artifact of the experimental conditions and questions are raised about its relevance (Urban et al., 2008). Two lines of evidence support the idea that this mechanism of apoptosis also may be relevant in vivo. First, histological analyses of organs of experimentally infected animals indicate only a small subset of cells within a particular organ is antigen positive even though the viral titer in the organ homogenate is relatively high. For example, peak titer of MRV in infected mouse brains is greater than 108 PFU per brain even though a very small fraction (< 5%) of the total cells are positive for reovirus antigen (Danthi et al., 2008a, Danthi et al., 2008b, Danthi et al., 2010b). Similar observations also have been made in the central nervous system (CNS) of mice infected with Sindbis virus (Levine et al., 1996). Thus, it is possible that the effective MOI in local foci within the organs is indeed high, and that apoptosis may be initiated during entry of virus into cells adjacent to those initially infected. Second, evidence supporting the in vivo function of viral and cellular factors previously identified to be important for entry-induced apoptosis in cell culture suggests a shared mechanism. For example, for MRV, \u03d5 mutant viruses are apoptosis defective both in cell culture and in vivo (Danthi et al., 2008a). Similarly, reovirus-induced apoptosis in cell culture and in the CNS is diminished in the absence of the NF-\u03baB p50 subunit (Connolly et al., 2000, O'Donnell et al., 2005).",

            "text": "The physiological consequence of apoptosis induced by virus entry into cells varies with each viral system, and is likely dependent on the rate of viral replication and the speed with which the host cell succumbs to death signaling initiated during entry. In some cases, initiation of death signaling during virus entry may be an intrinsic host response to invasion by a virus (Roulston et al., 1999, Hay and Kannourakis, 2002). For this response to be successful, the cell must undergo apoptotic cell death prior to completion of virus replication. Premature death of cells is detrimental to the virus since it prevents spread of progeny viruses to neighboring cells. In order to overcome this host response, some viruses, especially those that replicate slowly and have genomes with larger coding capacity encode proteins that delay or prevent apoptotic cell death until viral replication is completed (Benedict et al., 2002, Hay and Kannourakis, 2002). Among viruses discussed in this review, a late event in poliovirus replication blocks apoptosis (Tolskaya et al., 1995) and ASFV encodes antiapoptotic proteins (Nogal et al., 2001, Galindo et al., 2008). In other cases, induction of apoptosis by a virus early in its replication cycle may be a viral immune evasion strategy. Induction of prodeath signaling by the virus may prevent or attenuate the development of immune response, thereby allowing the virus to replicate its genome and generate progeny (Roulston et al., 1999, Hay and Kannourakis, 2002). It is possible that even for the same virus, the consequence of initiation of apoptosis during cell entry differs between cell types or between hosts. Thus, the true outcome of death signaling initiated during entry may only be evident during examination of viral pathogenesis. For example, apoptosis induction by MRV does affect viral replication in cell culture but appears to enhance viral replication within the murine CNS (Danthi et al., 2010b).",

In cases where virus infects and induces apoptosis in terminally differentiated, non-renewable cell population such as neurons or cells that are critical to the physiology of the host, such as myocytes or liver cells, apoptosis of infected cells often correlates with and contributes to the severity of disease. Among viruses that induce apoptosis during cell entry, pathogenesis of ASFV, BHV-1, Sindbis virus and MRV is associated with apoptosis (Lewis et al., 1996, Oberhaus et al., 1997, Oura et al., 1998, Jones and Chowdhury, 2007). Pharmacologic blockade of apoptosis alleviates viral disease in experimental animals (DeBiasi et al., 2001, DeBiasi et al., 2004, Beckham et al., 2007). These findings indicate that virus-induced death signaling may be a viable antiviral target. Ongoing studies to enhance an understanding of the virus-host interface that initiates death signaling and the signaling cascade that connects these initial events to activation of classical apoptosis pathways will highlight novel therapeutic targets to ameliorate the deleterious effects of apoptosis on viral disease.",
