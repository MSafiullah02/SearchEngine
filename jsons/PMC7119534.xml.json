The virus causes severe economic losses to the poultry industry worldwide because it can affect the upper respiratory and reproductive tracts, and some strains can cause nephritis in chickens (Jackwood, 2012). Despite intensive vaccination using both live attenuated and killed vaccines to prevent the disease, the emergence of new variant strains that do not serologically cross-react has complicated disease control and demonstrates the importance of vaccinating chickens with the disease-causing IBV types (Cavanagh, 2005, Cavanagh, 2007).",

To prevent the economic losses caused by IBV, live attenuated vaccines and inactivated oil-emulsion vaccines containing both the KM91 and Massachusetts 41 (M41) strains are widely used in Korea. More recently, vaccine strains providing broad cross-protection have been developed, including the K2 and K40/09 strains (Kim et al., 2013, Lim et al., 2012, Lim et al., 2015). In Korea, the viral content of a vaccine preparation is quantified by IBV titration according to standard procedure approved by the Animal and Plant Quarantine Agency. For this procedure, the chicken embryos are inoculated with serial dilutions of the virus preparation, and then the embryos are examined for the presence of specific lesions caused by the virus, i.e., dwarfing, curling, and stunting (Doherty, 1967). However, as a variety of live-attenuated vaccines have been developed for variant field strains, it is unclear whether the clinical sign determination method reflects viral propagation in IBV-infected embryos. Furthermore, as there are no specific standards for measuring clinical signs, the measurements of specific lesions can differ among observers.",

To confirm the detection limit of the DIA, each vaccine strain was serially diluted 2-fold in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and analyzed by DIA and real-time reverse transcription (RT)-PCR. Concurrently, triplicate 10-fold serially diluted samples were used to determine the detection limit of real-time RT-PCR. To measure vaccine titer based on the infectivity of chicken embryos, 10-fold serial dilutions of a 100 virus solution (10\u22121\u201310\u22129) were generated by mixing 1 mL of the virus with 9 mL of PBS containing 50 \u03bcg/mL gentamicin sulfate (Sigma\u2013Aldrich, St. Louis, MO); all dilutions were kept on ice. Next, 0.1 mL of the 10\u22124 through 10\u22129 dilutions were inoculated into five 10-day-old SPF ECE (Hy-Vac), and the eggs were incubated at 37 \u00b0C. No eggs had to be discarded due to non-specific death of embryos within one day of inoculation. After three days of incubation, 500 \u03bcL of allantoic fluid was extracted from the inoculated eggs using a 1 mL syringe and was used to detect propagated IBV by the DIA and real-time RT-PCR. Eggs were then resealed with paraffin for further incubation. Seven days after inoculation, the embryo:egg (EE) index was calculated for all eggs. Propagation of the inoculated virus was determined using real-time RT-PCR, DIA, and the EE index method, and the 50% egg infectious dose (EID50) of the five vaccines was calculated based on the method of Reed and Muench (1938).",

The highest dilution that showed dark-brown dots in the DIA was 2\u22127 for K2p170 and K40/09 and 2\u22126 for M41, KM91, and K40/09HP40. The 10-fold diluted viruses were also examined by real-time RT-PCR (Supplementary material Fig. 2). For the tested pathogenic or attenuated IBVs, there were no detectable Ct values at the 10\u22127 dilution. Therefore, the detection limit of the real-time RT-PCR assay was set to the Ct value of the 10\u22126 dilution. The real-time RT-PCR method was found to be approximately 215-fold more sensitive than the DIA method. Thus, real-time RT-PCR is suitable for detecting propagated viruses and can be used to compare the DIA and EE ratio detection methods for propagated IBV during titration. Because the DIA does not distinguish between infectious and noninfectious virus, we had to confirm that the assay does not detect inoculated virus in the eggs. As shown by the detection limit of the DIA, we observed that the input virus was not detected at dilutions higher than 2\u22126\u20132\u22127. Thus, none of the dilutions used in the titering (10\u22124\u201310\u22129) would give a positive result without viral replication, especially after further dilution in the allantoic fluid. After 7 days of incubation, the mean EE ratio and standard deviation of mock-inoculated eggs was 0.375 \u00b1 0.036. To detect dwarfism, the EE index was defined as the EE ratio of IBV-inoculated ECE divided by the mean EE ratio of mock-inoculated ECE. Embryos with EE indices below the lowest individual EE index for mock-inoculated ECE (0.880) were classified as positive for dwarfism.",

However, 20 results obtained using the clinical signs method did not match the real-time RT-PCR results. For the M41 respiratory strain, the titer calculated by the clinical signs method were lower than the titer calculated by real-time RT-PCR. The nephropathogenic strain KM91 and its attenuated form K2p170 showed higher titer when measured by the clinical signs method. Compared to KM91, K2p170 showed clearer signs of stunting. This demonstration that egg-adapted strains induce clearer embryo dwarfism than wild strains is in agreement with those of Dhinakar Raj et al. (2004). However, the recombinant nephrogenic strain K40/09 and its attenuated counterpart K40/09HP40, which was egg-passaged with heat adaptation, showed opposite results. The overall EE indices were higher for K40/09HP40 than for K40/09. Moreover, the K40/09HP40 titer measured by the clinical signs method was approximately 10-fold lower than the titer measured by real-time RT-PCR. These results suggest that the clinical signs induced by this heat-adapted virus might not be sufficient to produce dwarfism in ECEs.",

Thus, there is great demand for a multiple serotype IBV vaccine that provides broad protection. In addition, several research groups have attempted to develop a multivalent vaccine against not only multiple IBV serotypes but also other avian infectious diseases such as Newcastle disease, avian influenza, and infectious laryngotracheitis, as well as non-respiratory diseases such as Marek\u2019s disease and fowl pox (Ndegwa et al., 2015, Sharma et al., 2002, Vagnozzi et al., 2010, Winterfield, 1968). For such multivalent vaccines, which must be mixed accurately to induce a protective immune response, it is thought that the higher or lower titers observed by the clinical sign method (e.g., for the nephropathogenic strain or heat-adapted strains) could prompt manufacturers to add less or more antigen than required, respectively. This is especially important for live vaccines, because the virus first infects the host and then induces an immune response via innate and acquired immunity, the virus quantitation must represent the true propagating ability within the host.",

Generally, the disease-induced lesions are clinical signs, including stunting, curling, and clubbed down. In the US, the method for titrating IBV vaccines also states that on the seventh day after virus inoculation, all eggs should be examined for IBV lesions (USDA, 2014). In this method, specific lesions, such as bile stasis and kidney urates, are listed as general clinical signs. However, assessing specific lesions is laborious and time consuming. Moreover, well-trained observers who can recognize the clinical signs and can skillfully approach without damaging them are required. In this study, we choose stunting as a typical clinical sign because it is the most objective and quantifiable clinical sign, and it can be easily distinguished without observer error.",

The DIA method could be used to measure the titer of IBV vaccines that do not elicit clear stunting signs but propagate in ECEs, such as the heat-adapted vaccine strain. In addition, this method is faster than clinical signs method, and could reduce inter-observer differences.
