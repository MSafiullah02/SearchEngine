The impact of lock down and rapid isolation on the spread of the pandemic are also discussed. Further, we have studied four of the most pandemic affected regions in Italy. Using the proposed model, a prediction has been made about the duration of pandemic in these regions. The variation in the basic reproduction number corresponding to the sensitive parameters of the model is also examined.",

            "text": "Since its first appearance in Wuhan (China), the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 disease (COVID 19) is spreading rapidly across the globe [1, 2] . The number of patients are increasing exponentially and in some of the countries, thousands of people are losing their lives, almost every day, due to COVID 19. The seriousness of the situation can be understood by the fact that the number of infected cases have crossed the 1.2 million mark and more than 75 thousand confirmed deaths, across the globe, due to the disease as on 7th April [3] . Moreover, the outbreak has spread in more than 200 countries [3] . Owing to the grievous condition, the World Health Organization first declared the COVID 19 as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern on 30 January 2020 and later a pandemic on 11 March 2020 [4] . In fact, at this point of time, the COVID 19 seems to be unstoppable. Different countries and health agencies are working together to find some robust method to prevent the ongoing wave, which now becomes a pandemic, of the disease. Moreover, the ongoing outbreak forced various countries to implement the countrywide lock down to break the chain of transmission of the corona virus. This results in a huge loss in terms of economy and resources and at the same time created a chaotic situation worldwide. Efforts have been made from different corners of the research community to understand the structure of the virus and the transmission mechanism of the disease. Different studies analyze the role of social distancing (which is the only effective method available till date) in the prevention of COVID 19.",

Moreover, at the initial stage of the outbreak, Italian data followed closely the exponential growth trend observed in Hubei Province, China. Till date, Italy is one of the countries that have faced grievous consequences of COVID 19. Till 7th April 2020, Italy has 1,32,547 recorded cases and 16,523 deaths due to COVID 19. In terms of reported cases, it is the third highest while it is on the top when it comes to the number of deaths across the globe. Of the patients who died, 42.2 % were aged 80-89 years, 32.4 % were aged 70-79 years, 8.4 % were aged 60-69 years, and 2.8 % were aged 50-59 years. The male to female ratio is 80 % to 20 % with older median age for women (83.4 years for women vs 79.9 years for men) [10] . Moreover, the estimated mean age of those who lost their lives in Italy was 81 years [10] . The COVID19 outbreak completely disturbed the economic condition of Italy. Several family owned small sectors are suffering [11] . The condition of Italy surprised the research fraternity because Italy stands in the top five countries in terms of medical facilities. The ongoing dismal scenario in Italy has forced the government to admit that they do not have any control over the spread of the disease as well as do not know when the ongoing web of COVID 19 will stop.",

Therefore, to make our model realistic, we include the exposed population along with the infected population, which certainly results in improved prediction. We collected the data of Italy for COVID 19 available on the Worldometers[13] website. Further we trained the proposed mathematical model using the data avilable till 6 th April 2020. Using this improved mathematical model we study the impact of lockdown on the spread of COVID 19 in Italy. Also, we predict the possible end of the current outbreak of COVID 19 in Italy.

Due to the lack of government concern on this matter, the epidemic started to grow slowly but significantly. By the end of February the number of cases reached to 1000 [13] . We trained our model defined for Italy for the month of March to check its accuracy with the official data available [13] . It was observed that our model predicted the epidemic closely.

It is clear from Figure 4 that the epidemic could have been controlled at a very early stage if the government had imposed the lock down early in Italy. Figure 4 shows three different scenarios of the epidemic in Italy with different initial values of susceptible class. Figure (4a) shows the current scenario of Italy. However, if lock down would have been imposed prior to 9 th March 2020, the number of susceptible would have been significantly low. In figure (4b) , we assume the susceptible population to be 3.5 crores due to the lock down in the country.

Figure 5 shows various scenarios of the epidemic in Italy in case disease transmission rate would have been timely controlled. A rapid isolation of infected population will lead to reduce the disease transmission rate, \u03b2.

There are few regions which have become hotspots for the pandemic in the country. These regions include Lombardia, Emilia Romagna, Piemonte and Veneto. In order to study the pandemic more precisely, we have assumed that the transmission rate in these regions varies from the generalized transmission rate of Italy. This can be explained, as there is a visible population gap in these regions. Also, we have assumed that by first week of March, whole population of these regions is susceptible. Hence, we have assumed that there are no new individuals available for recruitments, hence A equals zero. For this purpose we have used the parameters values available in Table 2 . The disease transmission rate from exposed individuals is also reduced to 0.4. All the remaining parameter values are considered to be same as given in Table 1 In figure 6 , we study the case of Lambardia region of Italy. It is interesting to note that cases of infectives were highest in this region of the country. In sub-figure 6a, the proposed model is used for fitting the available data. In sub-figure 6b, we used our proposed model to predict the future of pandemic in Lambardia. We see from the study that by mid July, the pandemic will die out in this region. Figure 7 shows the case study of Emilia Romagna region of Italy. In figure (7a), we can see the accuracy of our proposed model. Figure (7b) consist of the upcoming predicted scenario of the epidemic in this region. According to our proposed model the pandemic will last till mid July, 2020 in this particular region. Figures 8 and 9 illustrate the behaviour of the pandemic in Piemonte and Veneto regions respectively. Sub-figures (9a) and (10a) exhibit the authenticity of our proposed model with the officially reported COVID-19 cases in these regions. The possible extinction of pandemic in these regions is shown in sub-figures (8a) and (9a). According to our proposed model, the pandemic in both of these regions will last till the last week of July, 2020. Also, it can be observed from sub-figure (8b) that the active infected cases in Piemonte will not surpass 18000. Whereas, the active infected cases in Veneto may hit the 21000 mark ( see sub-fig 9b) . shows the accuracy of our model with the officially reported data of these regions.

The pandemic may hit the 2.5 lacks active cases mark (see fig. 3 ) in Italy. Also, we have discussed how the lock down that was imposed on 9 th March, 2020 was a good but a delayed decision of the government of Italy. Through simulations, we have shown that a rapid isolation of the infective individuals and early lock down in the country are two of the most efficient procedures to terminate the spread of COVID-19. As of now, the vaccination of COVID-19 have not been discovered. Hence, this research can also be beneficial for the countries which are in the initial stage of the pandemic, as our research describes two of the most effective procedures to counter the spread of the pandemic and its long term impact on the spread of disease. The expression of the basic reproduction number R 0 is also derived. As our proposed model involves various parameters, we have shown the sensitivity of these parameters via numerical simulations. It is clear from the simulations (see Fig. 10d ) that the transmission rates, \u03b2 and \u03b2 0 are the most sensitive parameters. The reproduction number can be minimized if we can reduce these two parameters.",
