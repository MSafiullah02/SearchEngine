From current knowledge of the cases, most patients with mild and common symptoms have a relatively good prognosis while cases of death are more frequently seen in severe and critical patients, which could progress to severe pneumonia, ARDS and multiple organ failures leading to higher mortality [5] [6] [7] . Early diagnosis and accurate staging, therefore, are essential in COVID-19 patients. Viral nucleic acid detection remains the golden standard in diagnosis of COVID-19 regardless of clinical signs and symptoms, and is also the effective method to screening asymptomatic infection patients. Throat swabs tested by real-time reverse transcription polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR) is the most commonly used method [8] . However, previous studies have shown that several defects may limit the clinical application of laboratory tests, including immaturity of the nucleic acid detection technology, variation in detection rate from different manufacturers, disagreements in interlaboratory consultation caused by low patient viral load or improper clinical sampling [8] [9] . In addition, nucleic acid detection cannot accurately determine the severity of disease in COVID-19 patients.",

Based on the above-mentioned image abnormalities, HRCT could provide supplementary information to improve the planning of treatment, and evaluate the variations of image. To the best of our knowledge, little literature focuses on the change of CT appearances among different clinical types during the course of medical treatment.

On initial CT, the critical type exhibited a greater scope score and showed slight elevation during follow-up CT scanning. In common and severe cases, the lesion extent significant decreased after treatment. On series CT scanning, critical/common cases had gradient increased/decreased density scores in series CT scanning. Severe cases reached the maximum density scores at the first follow-up while decreased significantly on second follow-up.",
