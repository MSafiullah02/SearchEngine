It was first found in Ethiopia around 40 years ago on enset (Yirgou & Bradbury, 1978) and is now widespread in east and central Africa. Since the early 2000s, the disease has been reported in Uganda, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Rwanda, Tanzania, Kenya and Burundi (Adikini et al., 2011).",

Symptom development is rapid, typically <1 month after inoculation, and leads to high levels of the pathogen within the plant typified by pockets of bacterial ooze when the plants are cut (Tripathi et al., 2009; Adikini et al., 2011). The economic impact of Xcm is high due to total loss of yield and rapid death of the mother plant, preventing the creation of more plants by division of suckers, a primary mode of cultivation (Tripathi et al., 2007). The disease affects almost all banana cultivars with only a small number able to avoid insect\u2010borne infection due to the differing morphological structure of the male buds (Adikini et al., 2013). Therefore recent approaches to control have included genetic engineering to create transgenic bananas with resistance to Xcm (Tripathi et al., 2010; Namukwaya et al., 2012) and the development of in vitro screening methods for rapid determination of cultivar resistance/susceptibility to Xcm infection (Tripathi et al., 2008).",

A range of management strategies has been developed to limit Xcm spread. These have been demonstrated to be highly effective when employed properly, causing reduction of disease incidence to <10% per year in regions of Uganda. However, the approaches, including restricting movement, tool sterilization, removal of male buds and burying infected plants, are often poorly taken up by farmers due to the high financial and labour costs (Tushemereirwe et al., 2006).",

            "text": "The Xanthomonas genus is large, composed of many species and pathovars that cause disease in several hundred plant species. The genus is composed of two groups, with Xcm sitting within Group 2 along with many other important plant pathogens (Rodriguez\u2010R et al., 2012). The taxonomy of species and pathovars is very complex and still evolving, meaning confusion can exist over the identity of isolates within culture collections and that species identification can be problematic for diagnostic laboratories (Parkinson et al., 2009). Xcm was initially described as Xanthomonas musacearum and was reclassified Xcm in 1978 (Young et al., 1978). It has recently been proposed that Xcm should be reclassified as X. vasicola pv. musacearum (Xvm) due to its close relatedness to strains of X. vasicola. Indeed, partial gyrB sequences have shown 100% nucleotide sequence identity between Xcm and some X. vasicola isolates, and FAME and rep\u2010PCR methods group Xcm with X. vasicola (Aritua et al., 2008; Tripathi et al., 2009).",

Importantly, all Xcm isolates form a clade closely related to but distinct from Xvv (Studholme et al., 2010; Wasukira et al., 2012). Studied Xcm isolates have demonstrated very little genetic diversity, with comparisons of whole genomes showing at least 99\u00b799% nucleotide identity (Wasukira et al., 2012). Despite this, genome\u2010wide analyses looking for single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) variation have proposed two major sub\u2010lineages within Xcm, each corresponding to a distinct geographic region. Whilst this is based on only 86 SNPs and a relatively small number of isolates, it splits sub\u2010lineage I containing isolates from Ethiopia, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Rwanda from sub\u2010lineage II comprising isolates from Uganda, Tanzania, Burundi and Kenya (Wasukira et al., 2012). Numerous published data sets support the reclassification of Xcm as Xvm; however, further pathogenicity testing is required before this can be formally recognized as a pathovar designation (Aritua et al., 2008).",

            "text": "A primary driver for Xcm\u2010specific detection tools is to allow discrimination from numerous other diseases of banana that can cause similar wilt type symptoms, including moko, bugtok and blood disease caused by bacteria and the fungal disease fusarium wilt (Adikini et al., 2011). Typically, Xcm detection is based upon visual symptom expression and culture\u2010based morphological assessment. Recently, semiselective media for Xcm have been developed (Mwangi et al., 2007; Tripathi et al., 2007) but this approach has been found to be lacking as it is time\u2010consuming, requires confirmatory testing and often misses early stages of infection (Adikini et al., 2011). Biochemical tests can be used in some cases to resolve species and pathovars; however, approaches such as metabolomic profiling (e.g. Biolog) are time\u2010consuming, whilst fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) analysis is costly (Aritua et al., 2008; Adikini et al., 2011). As an alternative, molecular approaches have been investigated to allow the specific detection of Xcm including conventional PCR (Lewis Ivey et al., 2010; Adikini et al., 2011; Adriko et al., 2012) or rep\u2010PCR (Versalovic et al., 1994). Since the recent discovery of sub\u2010lineages within Xcm, Wasukira et al. (2012) have developed a PCR\u2010RFLP assay to allow discrimination of the lineages. Whilst these approaches can provide specific detection, they require well equipped laboratories, highly trained staff and are not readily amenable to field applications.",

LFDs provide an identification in minutes, have no technological requirements and are simple to use, so they are an important identification tool despite recent molecular detection advances (Lane et al., 2007; De Boer & L\u00f3pez, 2012). The requirement of such diagnostic approaches for Xcm is essential to facilitate elimination of residual sources of infection and improve disease management (Ocimati et al., 2013). This is critical for diseases such as BXW where, by the time symptoms are visible, the pathogen has spread systemically and therefore poses a high risk of further transmission (Adikini et al., 2013), and where latent infection can occur with long incubation periods (Ocimati et al., 2013). Therefore this study set out to develop an antibody\u2010based diagnostic kit for Xcm that could be deployed in a low\u2010resource setting, providing a cost\u2010effective diagnosis that can be performed by untrained personnel. A further advantage of this approach for diseases of this kind is that testing can occur simultaneously with control. Divorcing sampling from testing by sending samples to the laboratory can potentially lead to delays and loss of urgency on the part of growers. To enable this, polyclonal antibodies were generated to Xcm and formatted into a lateral flow device for in\u2010field detection.",

A possibility for this anomaly is the complexity arising from the challenges with Xanthomonas species and pathovar taxonomy, and the proposed but not formally accepted renaming of Xav as Xvv. In this study, the species names are as listed in NCPPB; however, some isolates were also studied by Lewis Ivey et al. (2010) and Adriko et al. (2012) and have contrasting species designations. For example, NCPPB702 is described as Xvv in this study but Xav by Lewis Ivey et al. (2010). Interestingly, Lewis Ivey found that only some Xav strains were PCR positive, for example finding Xav NCPPB702 to be PCR positive and Xav NCPPB796 to be PCR negative. These two isolates were included in the present study, where NCPPB702 was classified as Xvv and was PCR positive, and NCPPB796 was classified as Xav and was PCR negative. Therefore it seems highly likely this apparent difference in PCR assay specificity is due to the species names assigned to Xav and Xvv isolates.

The antibody developed in this study has been formatted for use in both ELISA and LFD, therefore providing an alternate laboratory test if used in ELISA, and allowing in\u2010field testing with the LFD. The substantial reduction of the ELISA limit of detection when testing in a plant background compared to pure bacterial culture is probably due to the much larger number of proteins competing for binding sites and therefore reducing the sensitivity, an effect considerably reduced when testing by LFD. Five samples were found to fail under ELISA testing due to degradation of samples during shipping, and two samples were negative, presumably due to levels of infection below the limit of detection, whereas all of these were positive when tested by LFD. This is particularly relevant when testing samples from remote locations, when time to send samples to the laboratory is prolonged, and demonstrates the practical advantages of the LFD where detection is possible after other techniques have failed.",

There are currently no instances of Xav being found in banana. Moreover, it has been demonstrated that Xav cannot cause disease in banana via artificial inoculation. Therefore the antibody generated in this study represents an important tool, with sufficient specificity that when testing banana will robustly and sensitively detect Xcm.

Therefore the development of simple, rapid detection strategies which can be performed in the field, such as LFDs, are invaluable. LFDs are suited to this setting, being cost\u2010effective, portable, easy to use and providing almost instantaneous results. Crucially, they can then allow prompt action when infected plants are found, vital in the management of diseases such as Xcm that use multiple modes of transmission, or alternatively used to test planting material at borders to prevent introduction of Xcm into countries or regions where it is not yet present. Based on the results of this study, the LFD can be deployed for in\u2010field detection of Xcm. If further confirmatory testing is required, two Xcm\u2010specific PCR assays (GspD of Adriko et al.
