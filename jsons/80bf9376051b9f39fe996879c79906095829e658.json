The major cause of death is reported to be adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) with occasional cases of multiorgan failure. Advancement in diagnostics via nucleic acid testing played a major role in detecting the sequences of viral genome. But there is probability of some degree of misdetection owing to the over-hypersensitivity and sampling dependence. As the virus continues its wrath, the major concern is still the unavailability of any cure. Only supportive treatment can be administered, thereby urging the immediate need for the development of effective preventive and therapeutic strategies.",

Old age was significantly associated with the severity of the disease [4] . Similar clinical manifestations were observed in another meta-analysis by Yang et al. which included eight studies with 46,248 infected patients and reported that hypertension, diseases of respiratory and cardiovascular system may be significant risk factors for severity of COVID-19 [5] . Later, these findings were supported by Emami et al. in another meta-analysis. After systematically analysing the data of 76,993 patients, smoking history and diabetes was also added to the list [6] .",

Thus, in absence of proper cure, it becomes essential to delineate the factors that may aid in the severity assessment of the disease. If individuals at risk of developing severe symptoms can be identified early, management of the disease may improve to a significant extent. In this context, several studies have tried to establish the laboratory abnormalities that may aid in discriminating severe and non-severe cases. Among the laboratory parameters, Guang et al. Since the virus shares genetic similarity with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, researchers are expecting a similar molecular pathogenesis. Previous studies have shown the occurrence of a cytokine storm in SARS and MERS. Cytokine storm syndrome is a state of sudden surge of proinflammatory cytokines due to stimulation by drugs or pathogens that disrupts the normal balance of pro-and antiinflammatory cytokines. Upon infection, the virus may abnormally activate various immune cells like dendritic cells, lymphocytes, natural killer cells and macrophages. Once activated, these cells produce high amounts of proinflammatory cytokines which further involves more immune cells leading to a positive feedback cycle. Upon crossing a certain threshold, this may lead to a cytokine storm characterised by aggravation of clinical symptoms along with diffuse intravascular coagulation, shock, multiorgan failure and death. It is now strongly believed that cytokine storm may lead to the transition from mild to severe in COVID-19 patients [10] . If this link can be established, then existing interleukin blockers may be used for management of severe COVID-19 patients.",

As of now, real time PCR based SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection from respiratory samples is the specific diagnostic test of COVID-19. But there are issues with sampling and other technicalities in this test. Recently, ELISA kits based on detection of IgM and IgG antibodies against N protein of SARS-CoV-2 have been made available [11] . This has opened the possibility of diagnosing an ongoing as well as past infection. But there is a strong need to provide newer ELISA kits to detect viral antigens that may provide an alternative to viral RNA detection.",

Every country is trying to protect its populations and the health workers as effectively as possible. India has already implemented nationwide lockdown since March 25, 2020 with the vision to 'break the chain' of infection and control its transmission.

A significantly lower absolute number of lymphocytes, CD4 ? T and CD8 ? T cells along with downregulation of IFN-c expression in severe cases was also observed[7]. In another pre-print, Xiang et al. reported serum urea, creatinine and cystatin C may be potential biomarkers in severity of COVID-19[8]. Huang et al. reported higher plasma levels of interleukins (IL-2, IL-7, IL-10) and other inflammatory markers (GSCF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A and TNF-a) in COVID-19 patients requiring ICU care versus non-ICU patients[9].",
