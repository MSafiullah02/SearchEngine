Therefore, the purpose of this review is to summarize the recent scientific evidence that outlines the effects of exercise on influenza or pneumonia in older adults. An electronic literature search was conducted using the WEB OF SCIENCE, SCIENCEDIRECT and GOOGLE SCHOLAR databases using the following keywords, \"Exercise,\" \"Older adult,\" \"Influenza,\" and \"Pneumonia.\" Any randomized control trials, cross-sectional and observational studies that related to this topic were all included. Twenty studies met the eligibility criteria for this review. Thirteen randomized control trials investigated the effects of exercise on the immune responses to influenza or pneumonia vaccination: seven trials employed moderate aerobic exercise, three employed resistance exercise, and the remaining three used Asian martial arts or special home-based exercises. Five cross-sectional and two observational studies examined the associations between exercise/physical condition and influenza/pneumonia. Most of the current studies suggested that prolonged moderate aerobic exercise may help to reduce the risk of influenza-related infection and improve the immune responses to influenza or pneumonia vaccination in older adults. In addition, training in traditional Asian martial arts was also found to be beneficial. Future research should focus on the different effects of moderate and vigorous exercise on influenza-related diseases.",

At the same time, 823,626 cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection had been detected and confirmed in more than 100 countries based on the latest World Health Organization (WHO) report (10:00 CET 1 April 2020) [9] . Concerns about COVID- 19 have not reduced, and the United States is fighting with a recent wave of winter influenza. According to the latest data from the United States Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), at least 32 million people in the United States have been infected with the flu virus since the 2019-2020 winter flu season, and influenza-related deaths could reach to 18,000, and is arguably one of the deadliest flu outbreaks in the past 40 years [10] .

For example, Kohut et al. [2] evaluated the effects of moderate exercise on antibody responses to influenza vaccination in older adults, and they found that an exercise group presented a significantly greater increase in antibody titer. Moreover, an animal study conducted by Lowder et al. [11] investigated the effects of different doses of exercise on immune responses, morbidity, and mortality after mice has been infected by influenza virus. The results showed that moderate intensity exercise can significantly reduce the mortality of infected mice. However, contrary findings to this also exist. Ranadive et al. [14] studied the effects of acute moderate exercise on influenza vaccine effectiveness, suggesting that acute moderate exercise does not enhance the vaccine efficacy in older men. Similarly, Long et al. [15] also reported that moderate intensity brisk walking has no effect on antibody responses to both influenza and pneumonia immunization. The literature suggests that physical exercise may exert some benefits on the prevention and treatment of influenza-related diseases, an extensive review, however, is required for further verification.",

By 2050, 21.1% of the world population will be 60 years or older, which is unprecedented in human history [16, 17] . Meanwhile, the rapid increase in aged populations poses a great threat to the healthcare system [3] . Aging is inevitably associated with declining organic and physiological function, such as immunosenescence, which refers to the age-related decline in immune capacity [18, 19] . There is sufficient clinical evidence to demonstrate that older adults are more vulnerable to infectious diseases (especially influenza, pneumonia) and also have lower immune responses to vaccines in relation to younger or middle-aged counterparts [15, [20] [21] [22] [23] . For example, Long et al. [15] reported that older individuals had greater lower antibody responses to some of the influenza and pneumonia vaccination strains when compared to younger individuals.

Kohut and colleagues first started RCT on older adults [2, 12] , they employed the same moderate aerobic exercise task in two papers. Subjects were asked to take part in an aerobic exercise training regime three times per week for 10 months in total. They used treadmill, cycle ergometers, and other equipment for exercise modalities at an intensity of 65%-75% heart rate reserve for 25-30 min per exercise session. The research mainly evaluated the effects of chronic moderate exercise on the antibody responses to influenza vaccination while the second study further investigated the role of psychosocial factors in the process. Both studies found that long duration moderate aerobic exercise training significantly improved the immunocompetence of older individuals, and they speculated that the endogenous opioids may possibly help to mediate the exercise-induced alterations. Moreover, the second study further inferred that psychological factors could be another possible mechanism. Similarly, two subsequent studies based on chronic moderate aerobic exercise also reported positive effects. In order to eliminate the impact of prior vaccine experience on immune responses, Vieira et al. [31] further compared the effects of a 10-month cardiovascular exercise on antibody responses in older adults with and without vaccine history respectively. They found that subjects with previous vaccine experience exhibited higher hemagglutination inhibition (antibody titer) 24 weeks after exercise. Wood et al. [13] reported that there were significant improvements in influenza seroprotection, overall illness severity and sleep disturbance in older adults who had completed a 10-month brisk walking exercise program when compared with those involved in balance and flexibility training. They demonstrated that the reduced inflammatory biomarkers or memory to na\u00efve T lymphocyte ratio may contribute to the benefit of chronic moderate aerobic exercise on immune responses, although it has not been tested in their study.",

The first of three studies aimed to investigate the different effects of meditation and exercise on influenza vaccine protection. Subjects were randomly assigned to moderate sustained exercise or meditation training for 8 weeks. The results showed no differences in antibody responses were found either after meditation or exercise intervention [28] . Therefore, they hypothesized that the exercise-induced benefits may be associated with innate immune processes, or have not been detected because of limited parameters being assessed. Two additional studies used a similar single bout of moderate aerobic exercise intervention. Long et al. [15] examined whether acute moderate exercise can improve immune responses to pneumonia and half dose influenza immunization and found no enhanced responses to either of the vaccines. Ranadive et al. [14] also reported no difference in antibody responses in older men. However, results were not uniform in men and women. They found that acute moderate aerobic exercise can significantly enhance the immune responses to full dose influenza vaccination in older women. Although both studies reported no improvements after exercise (except women in Ranadive et al. study [14] ), they all suggested that interleukin-6 could be the possible biomarker which may help the antibody response.",

Also, it is interesting to note that, no significant effect was found even after including aerobic exercises (e.g., dancing, ball games) into the exercise program under participants' requests. However, they stated that the insufficient statistical power may partly result in the non-significant results. The other two studies employed a similar exercise task, and both demonstrated that acute resistance exercise did not enhance the immune responses to influenza vaccination [25, 27] .

The results showed that long-term moderate Taiji and Qigong practice exhibited higher hemagglutination inhibition titers throughout the whole period, suggesting that the prolonged practice of Taiji and Qigong does enhance the immune response. In addition, two recent studies developed a similar home-based exercise for aspiration pneumonia prevention and falls [29, 30] . Although one study did not specify the duration of the intervention, both reported that such exercise did help prevent aspiration pneumonia and falls.

All the studies reported significantly positive associations between exercise/physical condition and influenza-related mortality or immunocompetence. However, the recommended exercise intensity may vary between studies. After influenza vaccination, both Schuler et al. [37] and Keylock et al. [34] found positive results in physically fit older adults, suggesting that regular exercise (intensity not specified) can significantly enhance the antibody responses to influenza vaccination in older individuals. Similarly, Wong et al. [38] investigated the association between exercise and influenza-induced morality in 24,656 adults who died in 1998 in Hong Kong and reported that exercising once per month to three time per week (intensity not specified) contributed to lowest morality. In 2002, a study by Kohut et al. [35] demonstrated that only regular, vigorous aerobic exercise contributed to greater immune responses to influenza vaccination when compared with moderate exercise and sedentary behavior. However, a recent study by de Ara\u00fajo et al. [33] reported that both moderate and vigorous exercise exhibited higher antibody responses.",

Explanation for the lack of consistency for this study could be the age difference. Most studies that reported similar findings focused on the effects of exercise on immunocompetence in young subjects [42] [43] [44] [45] . However, although all the X-sec studies demonstrated positive associations between exercise and influenza-related mortality or immunocompetence, there seems to be no consistent intensity of exercise reported as both moderate and vigorous exercise may boost the antibody responses [33, 35] .

More studies are needed to further ensure its effectiveness and potential mechanisms. The special home-based exercise program also exhibited preventive effects to aspiration pneumonia [29, 30] . However, this kind of exercise form may relate to disease types and thus a lack of generalization is probable. Physical frailty, a concept that can be applied to evaluate physical fitness, is marked by diminished endurance, strength, and decreased physical function [36, 46] . Two studies that examined the effects of physical frailty on immunocompetence were included in this review as this may also reflect the role of exercise (physical condition) [36, 39] . However, the results appeared to be conflicting. One study by Yao et al. [39] reported that physical frailty may impair the immune responses and increase the rate of influenza-like illness while Moehling et al. [36] found that subjects aged 50-65 with physical frailty exhibited significantly greater immune responses, which is completely opposite to the results of all the other observational and X-sec studies.

Prolonged moderate aerobic exercise has been previously proven and further confirmed in this review that it contributes some positive benefits on influenza (or pneumonia) immunization. The role of endogenous opioids, inflammatory biomarkers, or memory to naive T lymphocyte ratio have received some support, suggesting they may be associated with the subsequent exercise-induced benefits. Interestingly, Kohut et al. [12] demonstrated that the mechanisms of exercise-induced enhancement in immune responses may also involve psychological factors (e.g., depression, stress). Indeed, there are some studies that have concentrated on the effects of psychology on immunocompetence and an additional review could help to elucidate these outcomes.",

[25] demonstrated that the lymph flow rate, rather than interleukin-6 circulating levels, could be one of the biomarkers for the enhancement stimulated by acute resistance exercises. Yang et al. [32] inferred that the changes of autonomic balance induced by Taiji and Qigong practice may be the potential mechanism for the enhanced responses although it has not been tested. In summary, while the internal mechanisms remain inconclusive, it is well-established that there are several links between neuroendocrine factors and exercise that could impact positively on the cells of the immune system [47] [48] [49] [50] [51] [52] [53] .
