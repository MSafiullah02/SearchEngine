The results indicate that self-blaming was positively associated with state and trait anxiety (r = .44, P < .01; r = .28, P < .01), and avoidance was positively associated with trait anxiety (r = .36, P < .01). This means that those who use self-blaming and avoidance tend to experience higher anxiety. In addition, wishful thinking was inversely related to trait anxiety, although the result was not statistically significant.",

Chinese culture is guided by the Confucian philosophy of filial piety and, as such, is composed of an extended relationship network of family. The concept of filial piety concerns the correct way to act toward one's parents and serves as a model for relationships between members of different generations. The main concepts of filial piety include loving one's parents and being respectful, polite, considerate, loyal, helpful, dutiful, and obedient.30 On the basis of this concept, being a filial child, especially a son, means taking responsibility for care of the elderly,31, 32 who depend on the younger generation for emotional and financial support.33\n",
