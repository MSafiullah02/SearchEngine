Recently proposed criteria require fever as mandatory, include perineal rash with changes in the extremities, and recognize that, in the presence of fever and coronary artery changes demonstrated by echocardiography, fewer than four criteria are required to make the diagnosis of KD.6 Muta and colleagues7 showed that fever for four or fewer days in the presence of four other criteria increased the sensitivity of the criteria.

The incidence was intermediate for African-Americans (19.7) or children of Hispanic origin (13.6), and lowest for whites (11.4).18 In one large area of Great Britain, the annual incidence rate was 5.5 cases per 100,000 for children younger than 5 years old; the incidence for children of Asian ancestry was more than double that for Caucasian and African or Afro-Caribbean children.19\n",

If an infectious agent does indeed cause KD, the putative organism would appear to be of very low communicability, or predominantly responsible for subclinical infections. Repeated attempts to identify a particular infectious trigger have been unsuccessful.31 It is possible that vasculitis in KD is caused by either conventional antigens or by superantigens that trigger an immune response to endothelial cells, rather than by direct infection of the vessels.32 Superantigens are produced by several bacteria, notably certain strains of Staphylococcus and Streptococcus, and are capable of stimulating large numbers of T cells in an antigen-nonspecific manner by interaction with the \u03b2 chain of the T cell receptor. Overrepresentation of T cells bearing V\u03b22 among lymphocytes in coronary artery aneurysms, intestinal mucosa,33., 34. and peripheral blood35 from patients with KD supports the hypothesized role of superantigens in the pathogenesis. A variety of additional circumstantial evidence30., 31., 32., 36., 37., 38. and a murine model of Lactobacillus casei-induced vasculitis lend credence to this theory. Further, children with KD have unique reactions to mycobacterial antigens,39., 40., 41. which may also function as superantigens, including recall reactions at the site of a previous bacillus Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin immunization.39 Nonetheless, the only human illness definitively ascribed to superantigens is toxic shock syndrome, and other researchers have failed to identify evidence of a role for superantigens in the pathogenesis of KD.42 Thus, whether these findings represent a specific response to superantigens or crossreactivity with other antigens is not clear.",

A recent report implicated polymorphisms of the mannose binding lectin (MBL) in the pathogenesis of KD.69 MBL binds to n-acetyl glucosamine and mannose present on the surface of many microbes. This interaction results in activation of complement (C3) independent of antibody. Levels of MBL are determined by polymorphisms of the MBL 2 gene and its promoters. Higher expression of MBL is associated with lower incidence of coronary artery lesions in patients under 1 year old, but it has the opposite effect in older patients. This apparent paradox is congruent with the belief that MBL is important in protecting the very young child from infectious diseases.69\n",

Viral illnesses such as measles (especially when atypical or occurring after vaccination), Epstein-Barr virus, and adenovirus infections share many of the signs of mucocutaneous involvement, but they typically have less evidence of systemic inflammation and generally lack the extremity changes of KD. Toxin-mediated illnesses, especially scarlet fever and toxic shock syndrome, lack the ocular and articular involvement typical of KD. Drug reactions, such as those in Stevens-Johnson syndrome or serum sickness, may mimic KD but have subtle differences in the ocular and mucosal manifestations.

After the fever resolves, the dose is usually reduced to an antiplatelet range of 3 to 5 mg/kg/day. These doses, well below the anti-inflammatory level, have the effect of inhibiting platelet adhesion to endothelium by curtailing platelet release of thromboxane A2 without suppressing prostacyclin production by endothelial cells.139 This effect is believed to be beneficial in preventing thrombosis when platelet counts are elevated, although no studies have demonstrated such a benefit clinically, and aspirin does not appear to reduce the frequency of coronary artery abnormalities.140 In the event of aspirin sensitivity, another antiplatelet agent, such as dipyridamole, should be considered. Unless coronary artery abnormalities are detected by echocardiogram, aspirin is discontinued after results of laboratory studies return to normal, usually within 2 months of disease onset.",
