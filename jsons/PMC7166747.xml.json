It should be user\u2010friendly and able to give instrument\u2010free readouts for early detection of pathogens.1 This desperate need was experienced during the Ebola 2014\u20102016 outbreaks.2 The second annual review released by World Health Organization (WHO) in February 2018 emphasized on the urgent need for the development of better and improved diagnostic tools for prioritizing the epidemic diseases. The detection of Ebola, Zika, Marburg virus, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS\u2010CoV) and many more have been prioritized.3 Recently, CRISPR\u2010based diagnostic (CRISPR\u2010Dx) tool for nucleic acid sequence recognition has productively delineated its potential to fulfill the requirements of an ideal diagnostic tool for pathogens, single\u2010nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), and cancer detection.4\n",

In the presence of a specific guide RNA, it recognizes its target RNA and executes its nonspecific RNA degradation activity.10 East\u2010Seletsky et al10 have taken the advantage and demonstrated the use of Cas13 for the detection of 0.01 nM of \u03bbRNA with high specificity, using the signals generated from fluorophore\u2010quencher based reporter RNA molecule (Figure 1). In a recent issue of Science, two articles reported the development of a CRISPR\u2010based high\u2010sensitive diagnostic platform.11, 12 Gootenberg et al4 have developed a cost\u2010effective (0.61$ per test) platform for in vitro detection of nucleic acid sequences, which could detect up to attomolar (aM) concentrations without compromising the specificity. This platform has been termed as Specific High Sensitivity Enzymatic Reporter UnLOCKing (SHERLOCK). In SHERLOCK, the target sequence is amplified with recombinase polymerase amplification for DNA detection (RPA) or reverse transcriptase\u2010recombinase polymerase amplification for RNA detection (RT\u2010RPA), an isothermal, nucleic acid amplification technique that eliminates the use of thermal cycler. The resultant amplified DNA sequence is then subjected to in vitro T7 transcription, and produced RNA molecule is detected by Cas13\u2010guided reporter assay. The fluorescence signal is monitored using the spectroscopy4 (Figure 2). SHERLOCK has the potential to specifically detect lentiviral particles at a concentration of 2 aM, which harbors Zika and Dengue virus\u2019s nucleic acid fragments. It has also the ability to detect Zika virus directly from clinical isolates from serum, urine, and saliva, having a titer as sensitive as 3.2 aM, and through RNA extraction from the same material, a more sensitive detection up to 2.1 aM has been achieved. SHERLOCK is a powerful tool that allows us to distinguish between Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa; as well as can efficiently figure\u2010out the clinical isolates of Klebsiella pneumoniae carrying antibiotic resistance genes.4 Furthermore, by addition of single mismatch to its synthetic guide\u2010RNA molecule, SHERLOCK can potentially detect SNPs with high specificity, and is also able to detect a clinically relevant range of low\u2010frequency cancer mutations.4\n",

The multiplexed detection is achieved by optimizing the cleavage preferences of different Cas13 orthologues towards different sequences of the reporter molecule. In a system containing a pool of different Cas13 orthologues and its guide RNA, a particular target sequence could be recognized by a specific orthologue of Cas13. Cas13 orthologue would prefer to cleave a particular RNA reporter molecule, generating a specific range of fluorescence signals.11 For improved multiplexed detection, Cas12a has been used along with Cas13 RNAse.11 Multiplexing highly specific detection of Zika and Dengue virus was achieved with synthetic double\u2010stranded DNA and single\u2010stranded RNA (ssRNA) molecules.11 It has also explored for detection of P. aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus. The detection of target ssRNA molecules to the zetomolar (8 zM) range through scale\u2010up of preamplification steps through RPA was also demonstrated.11\n",

Csm6 nuclease gets activated in the presence of linear adenine homopolymer with 2\u02b93\u02b9\u2010cyclic phosphate.11 It is the nonspecific cleavage via Cas13 RNAse that leads to the formation of 2\u02b93\u02b9\u2010cyclic phosphate.11 Csm6 being nonspecific RNAse upon activation,13 could help to amply the fluorescence signal via homoadenine 2\u02b93\u02b9\u2010cyclic phosphate that was generated by Cas13 on target recognition. Combining this with SHERLOCK has facilitated an easy\u2010to\u2010use lateral flow assay that have shown an instrument free readout in the presence or absence of target sequences at concentrations as low as 2 aM within less than 90 minutes. The details of lateral flow assay have been meticulously described by Bahad\u0131r and Sezginturk.14 Figures 3 and 4 represent an explanatory version of lateral flow assay which has been used by Gootenberg et al.11 A combination of SHERLOCK with a paper strip lateral flow assay is able to detect non\u2010small cell lung cancer with mutations in the epidermal growth factor receptor.

However, antigen\u2010based diagnostic platforms have often found to be less sensitive and selective.12 Identification of the causative agent of the infection either bacteria or virus is important, and if it is bacteria, then it is necessary to know its (multi)drug\u2010resistance profile.15 SHERLOCK is a powerful, ultrasensitive and cost\u2010effective (0.61$ per test) platform without the needs of instrument that is able to discriminate between closely related genetically and antigenically similar flaviviruses as well as serotypes of Dengue virus.12 It is also able to sort different bacteria and differentiate their antibiotic\u2010resistant strains with exceptional sensitivity and selectivity.4 SHERLOCK can also detect SNPs and cancer mutations and have shown its adaptability for rapid and reliable development of new tests for recently detected Zika virus.4, 12 So far, SHERLOCK with HUDSON has shown impressive and versatile qualities, it could definitely act as an attention\u2010seeking tool for reliable and cheap diagnostics for infections and genetic disorders.",
