After reactive hyperplasia, granulomatous inflammation is the second most common finding in histological examinations of cervicofacial lymph nodes, regardless of the age of the child [1]. Granuloma formation is a protective response of our lymph nodes induced by the presence of substances, such as some microorganisms or foreign bodies, that are difficult to eliminate by the usual process of phagocytosis by macrophages [2]. Modified macrophages (epithelioid cells) aggregate to form granulomas surrounded by lymphocytes. Granulomas are further classified histologically by the presence or absence of caseous necrosis. Among infectious causes, nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) and cat-scratch disease (CSD) seem to be the predominant etiologies in children [1].",

Children with both types of infections have painless unilateral neck node(s), typically in the submandibular or preauricular areas, who do not respond to standard antibiotics. Bilateral enlarged lymph nodes are uncommon. Over a period of weeks or months and in the absence of effective therapy, the lesions usually progress to liquefaction with erythema or purplish color changes of the overlying skin. Fistula formation can occur followed by a spontaneous drainage through the skin (Fig. 1) [4]. Even if the disease remains typically localized to the clinically affected area, disseminated NTM and CSD infections are described [5, 6] and can be a manifestation of immune deficiency.",
