Knowledge of handling is crucial, however, because ferret bites in some localities mandate euthanasia of the animal for rabies testing.7 If the ferret is active yet tractable, support the body vertically under the forelimbs for examination. With more energetic ferrets or those prone to biting, scruffing and holding the patient vertically elicits relaxation and a yawning reflex. Distraction is afforded by offering Nutri-Cal (EVSCO Pharmaceuticals, Buena, NJ) or Ferretone (8-in-1 Pet Products, Hauppauge, NY), but avoid sugary treats in ferrets suspected of insulinoma. Fractious ferrets can be scruffed in lateral or sternal recumbency with one hand while placing the other hand cranial to the pelvis and stretching the body slightly.7\n",

Most cases of urethral obstruction involve male ferrets and are the result of cystic calculi or hyperplastic prostatic-like tissue at the neck of the bladder.7 Catheterization of the male is complicated by the J-shaped os penis as well as the very small diameter of the penile urethra. Place the male in dorsal recumbency, and aseptically prepare the prepuce. If the prepuce or tip of the penis is swollen, a small incision can be made in the preputial opening to exteriorize the penis.7 The tissue covering the os penis is very thin. A surgical loupe aids visualization of the small penile urethral opening lying on the ventral surface of the penis several millimeters proximal to the tip of the os. A 24-gauge pediatric catheter with the stylet removed can be used to localize the urethral orifice (\nFig. 2). Flush the catheter with sterile saline if resistance is met while catheterizing the urethra. In some cases, a 3.5-Fr rubber feeding tube can be used as an indwelling catheter, but this will be too large in many ferrets. The author most often uses a 20- or 22-gauge, 8-in. jugular catheter with the stylet removed (see the section on IV catheterization). The stylet can be left in place with the end retracted to provide support around the pelvic flexure, but exercise extreme caution to avoid perforation of the urethra. Suture the catheter to the skin using tape butterflies, and tape the administration port of the catheter to a tongue depressor to prevent kinking. Place a padded bandage taped to the skin, and attach the catheter to a closed urinary collection system. Monitor the ferret carefully, because many animals attempt to remove the bandage and catheter. The ferret with an indwelling urinary catheter should be treated empirically with a broad spectrum antibiotic (see the section on cystitis).",

Place an IV catheter and begin infusion of fluids supplemented with 5% dextrose. Control rare persistent seizures with diazepam (refer to the section on seizures). Administer prednisone (0.5 to 2 mg/kg SQ) to inhibit peripheral tissue uptake of glucose and stimulate gluconeogenesis.43 Begin with the lowest dose needed to maintain adequate BG levels (i.e., > 70 mg/dL). Continue to monitor clinical signs along with BG concentrations q12h, and increase dextrose supplementation if necessary. Once the ferret is stable, administer prednisone orally. In cases of persistent hypoglycemia, concurrently administer diazoxide, which acts to inhibit insulin release from pancreatic beta cells, beginning at the low end of the dose range (5 to 30 mg/kg PO q12h).43 Once clinical signs have resolved, gradually discontinue dextrose supplementation while monitoring the BG level, and adjust medications accordingly. Prednisone doses can often be lowered with concurrent administration of diazoxide. Offer a meat-based, high-protein ferret or feline diet while avoiding foods high in sugar or carbohydrate.",
