            "text": "A study shows that incorporating measures of individual genetic ancestry into normative equations of lung function in persons who identify themselves as African Americans may provide more accurate predictions than formulas based on self-reported ancestry alone (Kumar et al. 2010). The same argument may apply to other ancestrally defined groups; further studies in this area are necessary. Further studies are also needed to determine whether estimates informed by genetic ancestry are associated with health outcomes. The authors noted that environmental factors such as premature birth, prenatal nutrition, and socioeconomic status may also play an important role in the association between lung function and ancestry. It remains to be seen whether differences associated with race or ethnic group in the response to medications that control asthma are more tightly associated with estimates of ancestry. Although measures of individual genetic ancestry may foster the development of personalized medicine, large clinical trials and cohort studies that include assessments of genetic ancestry are needed to determine whether measures of ancestry are more useful clinically than a reliance on self-identified race.",

Lung function (FEV1 and FVC) and a panel of 15 inflammatory biomarkers (including cytokines, chemokines, adhesion molecules, CRP and WBC count) from blood samples were analyzed subjects aged 70 years (Kuhlmann et al. 2013). WBC count, CRP and VCAM-1 were found to relate to poorer lung function. A dose-related association was found for the combination WBC count and CRP towards FEV1 and WBC and VCAM-1 towards FVC.

Increased concentrations of ROS in the lungs of such patients are reflected by elevated concentrations of oxidative stress markers in the breath, airways, lung tissue and blood. Traditionally, the measurement of these biomarkers has involved invasive procedures to procure the samples or to examine the affected compartments, to the patient\u2019s discomfort. Non-invasive approaches to measure oxidative stress have been investigated. The collection of exhaled breath condensate (EBC) is a non-invasive sampling method for real-time analysis and evaluation of oxidative stress biomarkers in the lower respiratory tract airways. The biomarkers of oxidative stress such as H2O2, F2-isoprostanes, malondialdehyde, 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal, antioxidants, glutathione and nitrosative stress such as nitrate/nitrite and nitrosated species can be measured in EBC. Oxidative stress biomarkers also have been measured for various antioxidants in disease prognosis. EBC is currently used as a research and diagnostic tool in free radical research, yielding information on redox disturbance and the degree and type of inflammation in the lung. It is expected that EBC can be exploited to detect specific levels of biomarkers and monitor disease severity in response to treatment.",

Elevated BNP concentrations identified significant pulmonary hypertension with a sensitivity of 0.85 and specificity of 0.88 and predicted mortality. Moreover, BNP served as a risk factor of death independent of lung functional impairment or hypoxemia. It is concluded that plasma BNP facilitates noninvasive detection of significant PH with high accuracy and can be used as a screening test for the presence of PH. In addition, BNP enables an assessment of the relevance of PH and could serve as a useful prognostic parameter in chronic lung disease.",

In addition, lower levels of the coagulation marker protein C were independently associated with an increased risk of death. The association of lower protein C levels with non-survivors continues to support the role for disordered coagulation in ALI/ARDS. These associations exist despite consistent use of lung protective ventilation and persist even when controlling for clinical factors that also impact upon outcomes.

ALI precedes ARDS as severe respiratory illnesses progress. Both conditions can be life-threatening. In a large-scale, multicenter trial of patients with ARDS or ALI, higher levels of nitric oxide (NO) in urine were strongly associated with improved survival, more ventilator-free days, and decreased rates of organ failure (McClintock et al. 2007). The authors speculated that NO has a beneficial effect on ALI since it scavenges oxygen free radicals that are generated during oxidative stress. Since NO increases microcirculation, it helps to better perfuse tissue beds in the lungs. The investigators offered an alternative hypothesis to explain their findings: NO created inside the body may have a beneficial effect on organs other than the lung during ALI. It might help prevent further tissue damage by improving oxygen and nutrient delivery to the tissues, while helping to decrease the amount of toxic oxygen species. The authors also speculated that NO might have antibacterial effects that could be important in infectious conditions that predispose patients to ALI.",

Primary bronchial epithelial cell models of rhinovirus infection were used to identify mediators of rhinovirus infection and responded to infection with rhinovirus-16 by releasing high levels of IP-10, RANTES, and IL-16, as well as smaller amounts of IL-8 and TNF-\u03b1. IP-10, perhaps in combination with TNF-\u03b1, might be a useful clinical marker to identify rhinovirus and other virus-induced acute asthma. Additional findings suggest that IP-10 or CXCR3 (an IP-10 receptor that is highly expressed in activated T cells) might have a role in worsening of airflow obstruction and airway inflammation, and may therefore be potential therapeutic targets.",

However, not all individuals respond to corticosteroids to the same extent and it would be a desirable to be able to predict the response to corticosteroid treatment. Several biomarkers have been assessed following treatment with corticosteroids including measures of lung function, peripheral blood and sputum indices of inflammation, exhaled gases and breath condensates. The most widely examined measures in predicting a response to corticosteroids are airway hyperresponsiveness, exhaled NO (eNO) and induced sputum. Of these, sputum eosinophilia has been demonstrated to be the best predictor of a short-term response to corticosteroids. More importantly, directing treatment at normalizing the sputum eosinophil count can substantially reduce severe exacerbations. The widespread utilization of sputum induction is hampered because the procedure is relatively labor intensive. The measurement of eNO is simpler, but incorporating the assessment of NO in an asthma management strategy has not led to a reduction in exacerbation rates. The challenge now is to either simplify the measurement of a sputum eosinophilia or to identify another inflammatory marker with a similar efficacy as the sputum eosinophil count in predicting both the short- and long-term responses to corticosteroids.",

            "text": "Severe asthma is characterized by elevated levels of proinflammatory cytokines and neutrophilic inflammation in the airways. Blood cytokines, biomarkers of systemic inflammation, may be a feature of increased inflammation in severe asthma. One study found that IL-8 and TNF-\u03b1 levels were higher in severe asthmatics than in mild-moderate asthmatics or in controls and, in conjunction with augmented circulating neutrophils, suggest the involvement of neutrophil-derived cytokine pattern (Silvestri et al. 2006). Furthermore, in patients with severe asthma, TNF-\u03b1 level was positively correlated with both eNO and circulating neutrophil counts. Cytokine levels were elevated even though the patients were on high-dose inhaled steroids. This finding might reflect the inability of these drugs to significantly suppress production of this cytokine by airway cellular sources including epithelial cells and inflammatory cells. In patients with severe asthma there may be an imbalance between IL-8 production and the blocking capacity of IL-8 autoantibodies. The findings of this study may be clinically relevant and suggest that drugs that block TNF-\u03b1 release or activity might represent a new treatment option in severe asthma.",

Calv and JNO were measured from the fractional exhaled NO (FeNO50) at multiple exhalation flow rates in asthmatic children. Although FeNO50 and JNO give essentially the same information, Calv is higher in asthmatic children than in normal children. This study also highlights the relationship between poor control of asthma and Calv (a biomarker of alveolar inflammation) but further work is needed to confirm the relevance of this. Researchers at the University of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, have developed a novel nanosensor that can detect a possible asthma attack before it begins. The minute sensor can be fitted into a hand-held device, and when a person blows into the device, it measures the NO content of their breath. Use of this device would provide asthma sufferers with a simple and cost effective way to monitor their asthma inflammation.",

As arginine levels decline, nitric oxide synthase (NOS) itself can begin to generate superoxide in lieu of NO, thereby favoring NO consumption via the generation of peroxynitrite that could induce lung injury.

However, the issue of whether regular use of an inhaled \u03b22-adrenergic agonist worsens airflow and clinical outcomes in asthma is controversial.

In the MILLY phase II trial, patients with high pretreatment periostin levels had greater improvement in lung function when treated with lebrikizumab, compared to patients with low periostin levels (Corren et al. 2011). The primary endpoint of the trial showed that at week 12, lebrikizumab-treated patients had a 5.5 % greater increase in lung function from the baseline compared to placebo. Lebrikizumab-treated patients in the high-periostin subgroup experienced an 8.2 % relative increase from baseline forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1), compared with placebo. In the low-periostin subgroup, those patients on the drug experienced a 1.6 % relative increase in FEV1, compared with placebo. These results support further investigation of lebrikizumab as a personalized medicine for patients who suffer from moderate to severe uncontrolled asthma periostin enables selection of patients who will benefit most from the drug.",

The subgroup of airway epithelial cells belonging to the diffuse neuroendocrine system, termed pulmonary neuroendocrine cells, may represent a putative regulatory function of CgA as a prohormone. They are considered to control growth and development of the fetal lung and regulation of ventilation and circulation, but may also have a role in the pathogenesis of smoking-induced airway disease.

Serum levels of PlGF in patients with COPD were more than double those in smokers and nonsmokers without COPD. These findings suggest that bronchial epithelial cells can express PlGF, which may contribute to the pathogenesis of COPD. Both PlGF and VEGF expression levels were increased in cultured bronchial epithelial cells exposed to pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF\u03b1 and IL-8.

The BODE index has been updated to improve its calibration, and a simplified ADO (including age, dyspnea, and airflow obstruction) index was developed for use in primary-care settings (Puhan et al. 2009).

Surfactant proteins A (SP-A) and D (SP-D) belong to the collectin family and play pivotal roles in the innate immunity of the lung. Pulmonary collectins directly bind with broad specificities to a variety of microorganism and possess antimicrobial effects. These proteins also exhibit both inflammatory and antiinflammatory functions. The collectins enhance phagocytosis of microbes by macrophages through opsonic and/or non-opsonic activities. The proteins stimulate cell surface expression of phagocytic receptors including scavenger receptor A and mannose receptor. Since the expression of SP-A and SP-D is abundant and restricted within the lung, the proteins are now clinically used as biomarkers for lung diseases. The levels of SP-A and SP-D in bronchoalveolar lavage fluids, amniotic fluids, tracheal aspirates and pleural effusions reflect alterations in alveolar compartments and epithelium, and lung maturity. The determination of SP-A and SP-D in sera is a noninvasive and useful tool for understanding some pathological changes of the lung in the diseases, including pulmonary fibrosis, collagen vascular diseases complicated with interstitial lung disease, pulmona ry alveolar proteinosis, acute respiratory distress syndrome and radiation pneumonitis (Takahashi et al. 2006).",
