This is not necessarily correct, because some of the patients that we considered as recovered might still carry the disease, but we use this approach due to the scarcity of information regarding recoveries we currently have. The respective distributions are shown in Table 4 . According to [26] , Brazil had as of May 13, 2020 a total of 97,575 active COVID-19 cases. Even though there seems to be a large subnotification in the country [20] , this number will be considered as the total number of infected individuals nonetheless. To estimate the number of exposed cases, we look at data from May 8, 2020, since the mean incubation period of the disease is thought to be around 5 days [14] . Once again according to [26] , at this time Brazil had 76,603 active cases, so this gives us an estimation of 20,972 exposed cases. We also suppose that these cases follow the age distributions of cases from Table 4 . Finally, as of May 8, there were 65,124 recovered cases in Brazil [26] .",

With an earlier quarantine entrance, Table 8 showed that the reduction was by a factor of 155 for distribution D 4 , so the longer it takes for the quarantine to start, the less effective it is.",

The optimal controls that induce this calendar produced a reduction in the number of deaths of 110 and 155 times, respectively, in comparison to the same period of time without quarantine. However, in both cases the number of infected cases reached a minimum just before the end of the simulation, so by the time the quarantine ended, the cases were going up again, even becoming bigger than the original values for the shorter length we considered. This shows that the quarantines are not effective if they are not long enough.",
