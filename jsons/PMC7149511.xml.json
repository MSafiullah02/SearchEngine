The objectives of an autopsy are to: (1) confirm all features of the body that are structurally within normal limits and (2) describe and characterize all developmental, disease, and injury-related abnormalities. Synthesis of autopsy observations allows one to offer an opinion on cause of death, and will often facilitate interpretation of circumstances of death.",
