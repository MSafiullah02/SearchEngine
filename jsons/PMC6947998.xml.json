            "text": "Zoonoses are those complications which are transmissible between human and animal populations [1]. In this regard dogs and cats are considered as a public health concern, as they may harbor various pathogens such as zoonotic helminths including Toxocara species [2]. Toxocariasis is a worldwide parasitic infection, primarily rendered by T. canis in dogs, T. cati in cats and foxes and T. leonina in a wide range of carnivores [3]. Mature worms lay eggs in the intestinal lumen of their host, which are excreted into the environment via defecation and pass their developmental stages in optimum soil and climate conditions. Upon ingestion of embryonated eggs by another host, the larvae would emerge and invade the intestinal mucosa, then migrate through viscera such as lungs, liver, and kidneys. In addition, transplacental and transmammary transmission to puppies and kittens are important routes of infection. In an epidemiological perspective, animal hosts parasitized by adult worms in their gut can disseminate infection by shedding parasite eggs into environment [4]. In an epidemiological perspective, animal hosts parasitized by adult worms in their gut, can shed parasite eggs, hence considered as a source for dissemination of the infection [5]. Human infection occurs by accidental ingestion of eggs, and, to a lesser extent, via pica and devouring on the paratenic hosts, including chicken, cattle, lamb, pig, and earthworms [4, 6]. Consequently, developmentally-arrested larvae migrate through body organs, but don\u2019t develop into mature worms; hence, they provoke an array of syndromes enclosing VLM, NLM, and OLM as well as covert infection and asymptomatic toxocariasis [7\u20139]. Although rare, cardiac-associated toxocariasis is a serious, life-threatening complication due to VLM which has recently been emphasized [10].",

Despite the prevalence of Toxocara canis in the most areas, molecular studies on cat nematodes in Shiraz, in south-central Iran showed that, the most prevalent one is T. cati [15]. Toxocara vitulorum is frequently found in ruminants. Its main hosts are cattle and buffalo in tropical and sub-tropical regions [16]. It has been reported that 16% (95% CI: 11\u201321%; 470 out of 3031 samples) of soil samples gathered from public parks of the Iran were positive for Toxocara spp. eggs [17].",

            "text": "Toxocariasis due to several species of Toxocara and/or Toxascaris roundworms is still a seriously notifiable public health issue, particularly due to its intricate transmission routes [25]. In human this infection is caused by T. canis, in particular, and T. cati renders several issues comprising VLM, OLM, NLM and covert disease, each of which is represented by manifestations of the involved organ [26, 27]. Toxocara/Toxascaris infection in human populations is considered as a chronic parasite in nature which is distributed worldwide, particularly in tropical underdeveloped countries [28]. Several risk factors are supposed to play a major role in Toxocara/Toxascaris distribution among the human population, consisting of habitation in rustic areas, soil contact, consuming the undercooked meat of the infected paratenic host, insufficient and unhygienic water repositories, poor housing and low education as well [29\u201332]. Furthermore, owing to the adventurous nature of children, such as tasting any objects, eating soil and/or earthworms and being in the vicinity of dogs and cats, they are considered as a substantial risk group regarding toxocariasis [4, 33]. Hence, public places in which children may walk around such as parks, playgrounds, beaches and sandboxes are crucial territories for the acquisition of the infection [28, 31]. Since most individuals do not manifest any pathognomonic symptoms, the actual prevalence rate of the infection remains to be elucidated, even in industrialized nations [34, 35]. Considering that Toxocara parasites do not develop into adult stage in humans, coproscopy is unnecessary; thus, biopsy and direct parasite observation are the gold standard methods [36]. However, such examination is invasive and relies on the larval load and the infection phase [28]. Therefore, routine diagnosis of infection and/or exposure in human cases can be done by ELISA to detect specific antibody against TES antigens, which should be further validated by immunoblotting [37, 38]. As previously mentioned, TES-based ELISA tests are mostly used for human seroprevalence studies. Despite having proper immunogenicity, native TES antigens may cross-react with antibodies elicited against other helminths specifically Ascaris lumbricoides which decreases test specificity [39]. Therefore, the results may be regarded as suspicious, particularly when no immunoblotting confirmation is done, specifically in endemic regions where there exists the possibility of helminth co-infections. Alternative detection methods in paratenic or accidental hosts are including pathological inspection, larvae morphometry as well as PCR-based experiments [4]. A great deal of effort has been devoted to revealing the seroprevalence of human Toxocara/Toxascaris infection worldwide. In Africa, elevated seroprevalence rates of infection were detected, encompassing 6% in Egypt to 60% in Gabon and 92% in R\u00e9union Island [5, 40]. Additionally, the seroprevalence ranges in Asia and South America included 11 -84.6% and 7.3\u201366%, respectively [41\u201343]. Comparable to other territories, rates of seropositive human cases were relatively low in European and North American countries [3], implicating improved hygiene practices and public awareness in industrialized nations.",

Given geographical characteristics, only humidity (P = 0.023) and latitude (P = 0.032) were significantly linked to T. canis infection. Increasing latitude would likely result in decreased mean temperature and more temperate climates than the equator area. Water vaporization and condensation in northern parts of the country due to the vicinity to the Caspian Sea and high mountain ranges and humid weather substantially implicate in Toxocara/Toxascaris larval development, as proved in the laboratory [17, 20].",

Nevertheless, each detection method may provide a prevalence rate different from other modalities, which this issue would implicate potential biases in reporting and/or interpreting data. As we stated in the results section, necropsy has been shown as a better and efficient detection tool than fecal examination. For instance, more than 2-fold prevalence of Toxocara/Toxascaris spp. in dogs was obtained using necropsy [34.3% (95% CI = 26.4\u201342.8%)] than fecal examination [15.6% (95% CI = 9.8\u201322.4%)]. Also, necropsy was the most efficacious method in cats with 37.4% (95% CI = 23.5\u201352.4%) than fecal examination [20.4% (95% CI = 9.4\u201334.2%)]. On an international scale, different studies have documented the prevalence of Toxocara/Toxascaris in stray/domestic dogs (Canis familiaris) and cats (Felis catus). In Europe, T. canis prevalence in dogs ranged from 1% in Germany to 76% in Albania. Also, the prevalence of T. cati infection was up to 34.5% in Spain in this continent [46\u201349]. In dogs dwelling in the Americas, T. canis infection prevalence varied from 12.7% in Canadian provinces to 18% in Cuba. Also, T. cati was mostly prevailed in Argentina and Brazil with 61 and 25%, respectively [50\u201353]. The highest T. canis and T. cati infection rates in Asia were dedicated to Russia and China with 63 and 36.5%, respectively [54, 55].

The prevalence of T. canis in European foxes varies between 9.0% (in Italy) and 65.0% (in Denmark), as well as 32.5 and 71.0% prevalence in Canada and Japan, respectively [61]. The lowest and highest T. leonina prevalence in red fox was reported from Kirghizstan (5.9%) and the Slovak Republic (47.1%), respectively [60]. Regarding golden jackal (Canis aureus) moderate prevalence rates of Toxascaris leonina have been reported around the world, such as in Azerbaijan (31.8%), Bulgaria (36%) and Russia (43.5%). The prevalence of T. canis in this wildlife species ranges 40\u201361% in Asia and 20\u201354.5% in European countries, whereas T. cati was only detected in jackals dwelling in Russia (5\u201326%) [49, 62]. Considering that there are only 4 golden jackal studies and 2 red fox (Vulpes vulpes) studies, there exist paucity of data on Toxocara/Toxascaris prevalence in wild canine and feline fauna of Iran, which highlights more subtle investigations. Approximately, since the middle of previous century a periurban rise in European foxes population carrying Toxocara/Toxascaris worm burdens have posed a great environmental risk of contamination with parasite ova. On the other hand, they act a critical role in maintaining T. canis wildlife cycle with implications in constant transmission to human populations and pet dogs [63].",

Most of the infected cases were from north of Iran, which possess a favorable ecological milieu for appropriate animal hosts and Toxocara egg development (i.e., 28\u201333 \u00b0C in laboratory-based conditions, during 2\u20136 weeks [64]. Despite the improved hygiene and health surveillance systems as well as a wide-range public awareness in developed countries, still Toxocara/Toxascaris infection remains a public health concern in those areas and the rest of the world as well. During the time, there have been established a close companionship between dogs and cats with humans, and during past decades it has been even strengthened. However, these associations, particularly in underdeveloped nations, have been accompanied with poor veterinary infrastructures. This, along with free-roaming or community-owned dogs and cats pose a serious threat for zoonoses transmission to human societies [65].",

In addition, it is highly emphasized that future human investigations focus on using recombinant TES antigens with high sensitivity and specificity and less cross-reactivity. Also, it is better to identify anti-Toxocara IgG4 coupled with TES rather than total IgG and employ western blot as a complementary diagnostic technique [28]. Moreover, it is recommended to educate laboratory technicians for accurate parasite detection, regularly deworm puppies and kittens to decrease the worm burden, perform pro-active chemoprophylaxis approach and cultivate knowledge among the public as well as physicians regarding the clinical consequences of the disease. The interwoven collaboration among blood banks, veterinary diagnostic laboratories and municipalities (control stray dog/cat populations in urban areas) would provide a more completed picture of disease seroprevalence and distribution in people and animals, giving us the opportunity for targeted intervention strategies and better management of this zoonotic enigma. In parallel to above-mentioned recommendations the WSAVA has recently found a One Health Committee to highlight the transmission potential of zoonotic infectious agents from dog/cat to human. Besides the OIE has recently extended the surveillance of wildlife diseases through WAHID in the world. All of these expanded fields of epidemilogical data would assist the global community towards better understanding of human-domestic animal-wildlife interplay and control of human zoonotic diseases [63].",
