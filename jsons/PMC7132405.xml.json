According to the American Heart Association guidelines,4 which are shared by most scientific communities throughout the world, a diagnosis requires prolonged fever lasting more than five days and at least four of the following signs: 1) diffuse oral cavity inflammation (including pharyngeal infection), dry fissured lips, and a strawberry tongue); 2) bilateral non-purulent conjunctivitis; 3) heterogeneous skin rashes; 4) angioedema of the extremities (including peripheral erythema, oedema, or induration of the hands or feet); and 5) non-purulent cervical lymphadenopathy exceeding \u22651.5 cm in diameter. In what are known as \u201cincomplete\u201d cases, one or more of these clinical signs may be absent but a diagnosis can still be made if there is echocardiographic evidence of coronary artery abnormalities. Furthermore, a broad range of unusual clinical finding have been reported as defining the \u201catypical\u201d variant of KS, including aseptic meningitis, peripheral facial nerve palsy, uveitis, gastrointestinal complaints, acalculous gallbladder hydrops, urethritis, testicular swelling, pulmonary nodules, liver impairment with jaundice, and even hemophagocytic syndrome.5 Laboratory investigations (listed in Table 1\n) can only support the diagnosis of KS, but they still need to be validated before they can be used in everyday clinical practice.",

However, the lack of any clear relationship between one or more pathogens and the development of KS does not exclude the possibility that a real infectious disease may be involved, and other factors support this hypothesis. On the other hand, the unsuccessful identification of a specific pathogen to which KS could be ascribed has led some authors to postulate that variants of normal flora in the gut, oral cavity or skin of young children with a genetic defect of proper immune maturation do not induce immune tolerance as self commensals, but rather induce an imbalance of the immune system, leading to a hyperimmune reaction and the manifesting KS.32\n",

The most important is that persistent intracytoplasmic inclusion bodies (IIBs) showing amphophilic staining by haematoxylin-eosin and stain for RNA have been found in most of the tissues of patients who have died because of KS.33 As transmission electron microscopy (TEM) of bronchial epithelia has revealed virus-like particles associated with the IIBs, it was thought that these may be a \u201cfootprint\u201d of a viral infection that may persist indefinitely: Rowley et al. speculated that the infection associated with the development of KS could be due to a new and ubiquitous RNA virus that caused only asymptomatic infection or very mild disease in the general population, but KS in genetically selected subjects.34 It was thought that the first site of infection was the respiratory tract, with further dissemination through macrophages to all body sites, including the medium-sized arteries (mainly the coronary arteries) that are the most crucial targets in KS.",

First of all, there is the occurrence of epidemics because, although cases of KS are diagnosed, there are also sometimes widespread epidemics. In Japan, where nationwide epidemiological surveys of KS have been carried out almost every two years since 1970,36 three large-scale epidemics were recorded in 1979, 1982, and 1986, with incidence rates that were several times higher than those reported in the previous and following year. Secondly, as in the case of a number of infectious diseases,37, 38 KS is more frequent in boys, and the male to female ratio is about 1.6.39 Thirdly (once again as in the case of many infectious diseases), the incidence of KS seems to be closely related to weather conditions, although the predominant season varies from country to country: winter and spring in the United Kingdom, Australia and the USA, and spring and summer in China.40, 41, 42, 43 Pitzer et al., examined seasonal changes in the age and incidence of KS hospitalisations in the USA, and found that periods of high incidence corresponded to a low average age, and vice versa.40 Comparison of the observed pattern with those predicted by a suite of models based on different etiological hypotheses, the age-incidence pattern of KS suggested the involvement of an imperfectly immunising infection and/or a persistently infectious agent.",

Moreover, some of the clinical features of KS, such as mucous membrane erythema and desquamation of the fingers and toes (usually beginning within 2\u20133 weeks of the onset of fever), overlap those associated with some bacterial diseases that are considered to be a consequence of the superantigen (SA)-mediated activation of T cells leading to the overproduction of cytokines, systemic inflammation and shock.45, 46, 47 The best examples in this regard are toxic shock syndrome (TSS) and scarlet fever due to S. aureus, and streptococcal toxic shock syndrome (STSS) due to Streptococcus pneumoniae.

When an SA is involved, T cell responses are quantitatively and qualitatively different from conventional T cell activation by normal antigens. In particular, SAs activate T cells in a manner that depends on the T cell receptor variable domain (V\u03b2), and so a large number of T cells can be simultaneously activated.85 The activation is extremely potent and a number of studies have found that KS is characterised by the marked activation of T cells and monocytes/macrophages, and increased production of IL-1\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6, which are the same immunological findings as those of TSS.47\n",

Leung et al. blindly studied bacterial SAs potentially involved in the pathogenesis of KS in cultures of patients in the acute phase and controls,52 and found SA-producing bacteria in 13 of the 16 patients but in only one of the 15 controls (p < 0.0001). Eleven of the 13 toxin-positive cultures from the patients with KS contained toxic shock syndrome toxin (TSST)-1 secreting S. aureus, and the remaining two contained streptococci producing streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin B (SPEB) and streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin C (SPEC). Twelve of the culture-positive patients had toxin-producing S. aureus isolated from pharyngeal or rectal cultures, thus suggesting the gastrointestinal tract as the primary entry site. Similar findings of TSST-1-producing S. aureus and SPEC-producing streptococci in children with acute KS have been recently published.47 The SA theory may be supported by anecdotal reports of KS patients with guttate psoriasis because it has been suggested that this form of psoriasis is due to toxin-mediated T cell activation.53 Furthermore, a number of studies analysing the T lymphocyte receptor repertoire and the titres of antibodies against selected SAs have indirectly demonstrated that these proteins may be related to the development of KS.52, 54, 55, 56\n",

It has been reported that the annual incidence of KS in Japan in 2009 and 2010 was respectively 206.2 and 239.6 per 100,000 children aged 0\u20134 years58; on the contrary, a recent analysis found that the 2009 KS-related hospitalisation rate in the USA was 19 per 100,000 children aged <5 years,59 and even lower incidence rates have been calculated for a number of European countries.60, 61, 62, 63 Theoretically, various factors could explain this large difference. The incidence of KS is rapidly increasing throughout the world, and so surveys carried out at different times may lead to different results. Moreover, although KS is significantly more frequent in younger children than in older children, adolescents or adults, its frequency in younger patients also varies. A comparison of the incidence of KS in Northern European and Japan found that 86.4% of the Japanese patients were aged <5 years, but 67.8% of the cases diagnosed in Norway, Finland, Sweden and Denmark (p < 0.001).63\n",

Furthermore, American studies have clearly shown ethnicity-related variations in the incidence of KS: in comparison with white subjects, the incidence is twice as high among Asians and Pacific Islanders, and about 1.5 times higher among black subjects.64 Similarly, its incidence in Hawaii (the state with the highest proportion of Asians and Pacific Islanders) is 2.5 times higher than that reported for the continental USA.65 It has also been reported that the incidence of KS is 6\u201310 times higher among the siblings of KS patients than in the general population,66 and that children with KS are more likely to have parents who have had the disease.67 It has been calculated that the inheritability of KS (i.e. the ratio of the incidence of KS between siblings and the general population) is only slightly less than that of type 1 diabetes and about four times more than that of allergic asthma.68\n",

            "text": "Several candidate genes, mainly chosen among those related to innate and acquired immunity, cardiovascular function, and vascular remodelling, have been tested in patients with KS (Table 3\n).69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100, 101, 102, 103, 104, 105, 106, 107, 108, 109, 110, 111, 112, 113, 114, 115, 116, 117 Results were frequently negative or conflicting, particularly when the studies enrolled a limited number of patients and were carried out in populations with significant racial differences that impact the allele frequency of some of the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) analysed in the studies. Good example at this regard are the data collected on the role of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), Fc gamma receptors (FCGR) and of CD40 ligand SNPs in conditioning susceptibility, evolution and outcome of KS. MMPs play an important role in processes that degrade extracellular matrices. Their activity is controlled by specific inhibitors (TIMPs) and imbalances between MMPs and TIMPs are associated with several pathological conditions, including vascular aneurysm. Association of increased MMP9/TIMP2 and MMP3/TIMP1 ratios with risk of coronary artery lesions was found in Japanese children.95 On the contrary, no association was found between SNP of MMP-3 in the Korean population.96 Debated is also the role of CD40L, a transmembrane protein that engages with CD40 and transduces signals related to cell activation and development because a strict association between SNPs and development and severity of KS was demonstrated in the Japanese patients77 but not in the Taiwanese population.78 However, in some studies more convincing results were found particularly when they could evidence that the same polymorphisms were present in populations with different racial characteristics. Onouchi et al. reported that multiple variants in the caspase-3 gene (CASP3) that were in linkage disequilibrium conferred susceptibility to KS in both Japanese and US subjects of European ancestry.73 These authors found that a G to A substitution of one commonly associated SNP located in the 5\u2032 untranslated region of CASP3 (rs72689236; p = 4.2 \u00d7 10\u22128 in the Japanese and p = 3.7 \u00d7 10\u22123 in the European Americans) abolished binding of nuclear factor of activated T cells to the DNA sequence surrounding the SNP suggesting that altered CASP3 expression in immune effecter cells influences susceptibility to KS. Interesting results were also reported by Shimizu et al. that investigated genetic variation in 15 genes belonging to the TGF-B pathway in a total of 771 KD subjects of mainly European descent from the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, and the Netherlands.101 Genetic variants in TGFB2, TGFBR2, and SMAD3 and their haplotypes were consistently and reproducibly associated with KS susceptibility, coronary artery aneurysm formation, aortic root dilatation, and intravenous immunoglobulin treatment response in different cohorts. A SMAD3 haplotype associated with KS susceptibility replicated in 2 independent cohorts and an intronic single nucleotide polymorphism in a separate haplotype block was also strongly associated (A/G, rs4776338; p = 0.000022; OR, 1.50; 95% CI, 1.25\u20131.81). Pathway analysis using all 15 genes further confirmed the importance of the TGF-\u03b2 pathway in KS pathogenesis. Because similar data regarding susceptibility were reported by Kuo et al.102 it was concluded that genetic polymorphisms in TGFB signalling pathway are strictly associated with the risk of development of KS.",

An SNP within the disabled homologue 1 (DAB1) gene locus in chromosome 1 (rs527409) was replicated in 266 children with KS and 600 normal controls (odds ratio [OR] = 2.90, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.85\u20134.54, p = 1.46 \u00d7 10\u22126), and a PELI1 locus on chromosome 2p13.3 (rs7604693) was replicated in 86 KS patients with CALs and 600 controls (OR = 2.70, 95% CI = 1.77\u20134.12, p = 1.00 \u00d7 10\u22126), thus highlighting the presence of a KS susceptibility locus in the 1p31 region and a CAL susceptibility locus in the 2p13.3 region. Unfortunately, the function of DAB1 is not known and it is not possible to establish the role of the genetic variant involving this protein. However, PELI1 seems to function as a negative regulator of Toll-like receptor (TLRs) signalling, thus confirming that genetic variants seem to be associated with variations in immune response.",

Among KD-associated SNPs, three were close to the COPB2 (coatomer protein complex beta-2 subunit) gene: rs1873668 (p = 9.52 \u00d7 10\u22125), rs4243399 (p = 9.93 \u00d7 10\u22125), and rs16849083 (p = 9.93 \u00d7 10\u22125).

Similar results were obtained by Lee et al. in 622 individuals with KS and 1107 controls in a Han Chinese population residing in Taiwan, with replication in an independent Han Chinese sample of 261 cases and 550 controls.117 They found that polymorphisms at BLK gene together with genetic abnormalities at CD40, were associated with KS at genome-wide significance (p < 5.5 \u00d7 10\u22128) confirming the role of immune activation and inflammation in the pathogenesis of the syndrome.",

Either viruses or bacteria could act as disease, but no specific infectious agent can be considered the definite cause of KS, and so no specific anti-infective therapy can be developed. Moreover, although potential genetic determinants have been hypothesised in subjects with KS, none of them can yet be considered real markers of disease susceptibility. Consequently, the pathogenesis of KS is only partially known and measures to prevent it remain elusive. Further studies are needed to address the many still open questions concerning this still enigmatic disease.",
