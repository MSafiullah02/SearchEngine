With the exception of recent data in pediatric patients who underwent transplantation for nonmalignant disease states, only the i.v. route of administration for alemtuzumab has been used in stem cell transplantation [12]. However, i.v. alemtuzumab has been associated with serious infusion-related reactions that include fever, chills, rigors, rash, hypotension, shortness of breath, bronchospasm, and anaphylaxis. Prevention of these reactions requires pretreatment with antihistamines, corticosteroids, and antipyretics.

            "text": "Consistent with our results, subQ administration of alemtuzumab has been shown to reduce the incidence of infusion-related reactions while maintaining the same efficacy when used for treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Lundin et al. conducted a phase II open-label study that determined the efficacy and safety of alemtuzumab delivered subQ as first-line therapy, over a prolonged treatment period of 18 weeks in patients with symptomatic B cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (n = 41). On day 1, 3 mg alemtuzumab was administered by subQ injection. If well tolerated, the dose was raised to 10 mg on day 3 and then raised to the target dose of 30 mg, split into 2 injection sites (1.5 mL at each site) on day 5. The 30 mg dose was then given 3 times weekly for a maximum of 18 weeks. Prophylactic medications against first-dose reactions included an antipyretic and antihistamine, given 30 minutes before the injections. Most first dose reactions, which are frequently seen after i.v. administration of alemtuzumab, were rare or absent in this study. Transient rigor was seen in 17% of patients, fever was observed in 70% of patients, and injection site reaction was seen in 90% of patients, but there were no episodes of rash/urticaria, bronchospasm, or hypotension [13]. It appears that subQ administration induced more local injection site reactions, instead of \u201cflu-like\u201d symptoms, than i.v. administration did. Given the relative urgency and the compressed time frame of transplantation conditioning regimens, we successfully omitted the initial dosing ramp-up of subQ or i.v. alemtuzumab without excessive incidence of reactions.",

This cautionary observation underscores the need to study the pharmacokinetics and biodistribution of alemtuzumab, which may differ according to disease, remission status, and route of administration. From pharmacokinetic studies undertaken in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia, it is clear that the same peak levels of antibody are obtained with both i.v. and subQ administration of alemtuzumab 15, 16. However, further pharmacokinetic studies need to be conducted to fully understand the utility of obtaining the meaning of serum levels after subQ administration of alemtuzumab in other settings, including bone marrow transplantation.",

The data were collected retrospectively and, therefore, are subject to the usual restriction and bias of this type of analysis. However, microbiological and laboratory data were collected using electronic medical records, minimizing absent data and under-reporting. The relatively small sample size also makes it difficult to obtain statistical significance for the secondary endpoints. However, our primary aim was to report the difference in infusion-related reactions between subQ and i.v. administration of alemtuzumab, which was shown to be statistically significant and consistent with the current literature published for chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Our analysis was also limited to patients receiving a matched unrelated allogeneic stem cell transplantation. Larger studies are needed to assess the role of subQ alemtuzumab in all transplantation types, as well as the pharmacokinetic differences of i.v. and subQ administration, if any, as this was not the primary focus of this study. There was a difference in graft source between the i.v. and subQ cohorts, with all patients in the subQ arm receiving peripheral blood stem cells and 50% of the patients in the i.v. cohort receiving bone marrow stem cells; however, this did not result in a statistically significant increased incidence of GVHD in the subQ cohort. Our analysis on engraftment is limited because of the differences in graft source. We continue to use subQ alemtuzumab and monitor data, as a long-term follow-up period is needed to assess outcomes such as overall survival and chronic GVHD.",

No significant differences in infectious complications, relapse, GVHD, and survival were found between the 2 groups with the exception of a shorter median time to EBV viremia and platelet engraftment in the subQ arm. Transplantation centers utilizing i.v. alemtuzumab for GVHD prophylaxis may consider transitioning to subQ alemtuzumab. SubQ administration may lower infusion-related reactions compared with i.v. administration without jeopardizing efficacy of reducing GVHD.",
