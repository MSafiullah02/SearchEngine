            "text": "Twenty years ago, drug discovery was a somewhat plodding and scholastic endeavor; those days are gone. The intellectual challenges are greater than ever but the pace has changed. Although there are greater opportunities for therapeutic targets than ever before, the costs and risks are great and the increasingly competitive environment makes the pace of pharmaceutical drug hunting range from exciting to overwhelming. These changes are catalyzed by major changes to drug discovery processes through application of rapid parallel synthesis of large chemical libraries and high-throughput screening. These techniques result in huge volumes of data for use in decision making. Besides the size and complex nature of biological and chemical data sets and the many sources of data \"noise\", the needs of business produce many, often conflicting, decision criteria and constraints such as time, cost, and patent caveats. The drive is still to find potent and selective molecules but, in recent years, key aspects of drug discovery are being shifted to earlier in the process. Discovery scientists are now concerned with building molecules that have good stability but also reasonable properties of absorption into the bloodstream, distribution and binding to tissues, metabolism and excretion, low toxicity, and reasonable cost of production. These requirements result in a high-dimensional decision problem with conflicting criteria and limited resources. An overview of the broad range of issues and activities involved in pharmaceutical screening is given along with references for further reading.",

Epidemics, such as AIDS, increasing rates of cancer, the threat of biological warfare agents, and an increasing elderly population, mean that the demand for useful therapeutic drugs is greater than ever. At the same time, pressure is increasing to reduce costs in the face of the daunting challenge of discovering and developing therapeutic agents. Approximately 50% of drugs in development fail due to safety issues and 25% fail due to efficacy issues. Most researchers estimate that the process of developing a new drug from early screening to drug store shelves costs $600 to $900 million and takes 8 to 15 years.",

In biology, a major activity is to make the linkages between what can be assayed and a disease response, but activities also include design and validation of animal models, cell cultures, biochemical screen design, and assay variability studies. Another important area in biology, the pace of which has especially intensified in the last decade, is the assessment in vivo of the extent of absorption into the blood stream, distribution and binding to tissues, and the rates of metabolism and excretion. This is denoted by ADME and is discussed in Section 11. In chemistry, the major responsibility is to provide the creative spark to navigate effectively the large space of possible compounds (another word for molecules) towards the blockbuster drug. Other activities include synthesis of new molecules, analytical characterization of existing molecules (including purity of batches, pKa, logP, melting point, and solubility) and construction of libraries. Important issues in computer science include data storage and extraction, implementation and scale-up of algorithms, management of biological and chemical databases, and software support. Activities in informatics or chemoinformatics (Leach, 2003) include design of experiments, development of new chemical descriptors, simulation, statistical analysis, mathematical modeling, molecular modeling, and the development of machine learning algorithms.",

A large number of compounds are to be mined for compounds that are active; for example, that bind to a particular target. The compounds may come from different sources such as vendor catalogues, corporate collections, or combinatorial chemistry projects. In fact, the compounds need only to exist in a virtual sense, because in silico predictions in the form of a model can be made in a virtual screen (Section 8) which can then be used to decide which compounds should be physically made and tested. A mapping from the structure space of compounds to the descriptor space or property space provides covariates or explanatory variables that can be used to build predictive models. These models can help in the selection process, where a subset of available molecules is chosen for the biological screen. The experimental results of the biological screen (actives and inactives, or numeric potency values) are then used to learn more about the structure-activity relationship (SAR) which leads to new models and a new selection of compounds as the cycle renews.",

Often the chemical compounds are considered to be the experimental unit even though, in actual experiments, an animal or cell culture is the unit and the compound is a treatment. This is because the important asset to the pharmaceutical company is the compound. The vast size of the set of potential experimental units (potential compounds), coupled with the high dimensionality of the response being optimized (potency, selectivity, toxicity, and ADME) and the \"roughness\" of the response landscape make drug discovery a challenging arena.

The chemical entity (compound) may be a small molecule, a peptide, or a large protein. Typically, chemical entities are purchased from external providers or synthesized within a company. The compound can be viewed as binding or docking to the biological receptor or target in order to competitively inhibit, or else to induce, some biological signal such as the production of a protein or hormone, resulting in a specific response.

Target validation requires careful scientific experiments designed to explore how a target influences a biological response or disease state. 2. A high-throughput screen (HTS) is designed, optimized, calibrated, validated, and run to obtain biological response data at a single concentration for 200,000 compounds (Section 4). This may involve whole cells, enzymes, or other in vitro targets. Reducing variability is crucial. Sittampalam et al.

These results are modeled with a nonlinear dose-response curve and for each molecule a summary measure is computed such as a 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) or a 50% efficacious concentration (EC50). 4. The secondary assay reduces the set of actives to those for which potency reaches at least 50% of the maximum potency of a reference compound, at some concentration. Typically there are 500 to 1000 of these compounds, and they are called hits. Many hits may be nonspecific or for other reasons may offer no prospect for future development. (In subsequent sections the distinction between active and hit is blurred.) 5. The hits are examined in a series of careful studies in an effort often called hit to lead. Chemists look at the hits and classify them into four to eight broad series and, within each series, they try to find a structure-activity relationship. The chemists characterize these SARs by testing (in the secondary assay) a few hundred or a few thousand more molecules, thus expanding each SAR. Out of these SARs, the chemists and biologists choose a few hundred compounds to be tested in cell-based or enzyme in vitro screens. These screens require careful design and validation. From the molecules run through the in vitro testing, 100 or so may go through in vivo single-dose tests using a rodent or some other animal model. Some 10 to 40 of these molecules are finally tested for in vivo efficacy in a full dose-response experiment performed on the animal of choice. 6.

How well those prior steps are done will, in part, determine the success or failure of the human clinical trials. The adoption of high-throughput screening and combinatorial chemistry methods in the early 1990s offered promise that a shotgun approach to drug discovery would be possible. It was soon learned that simply increasing the volume of screening results cannot be the answer. The number of potential chemical entities is staggering, being estimated to be between 10 20 and 10 60 . The efficient exploration of a landscape of this magnitude requires prudent use of machinery, human expertise, informatics, and, even then, an element of fortuity. On average, for every 5000 compounds that enter a hit-to-lead phase, only five will continue on to clinical trials in humans, and only one will be approved for marketing.

The false positive rate can be lowered by raising the decision threshold, or \"hit limit\", but at the cost of increasing the false negative error rate.

The false negative rate is unknowable because the vast majority of compounds are not studied further, but it can be estimated from small studies. From past HTS screens at Lilly, we have estimated that a mechanical failure false negative occurs in roughly 7% to 12% of compounds in an HTS screen, with a total false negative error rate ranging from 20% to 30%.

In practice, the false positives will be tested in the secondary screen and found to be inactive when that screening result is observed. Some researchers favor raising the threshold to reduce the number of compounds labeled as active. The false negatives can then be identified by a statistical or predictive model and rescreened. In one recent project at Lilly we followed up a 150,000 compounds HTS with a small library (that is, a small collection of molecules) of 2300 compounds. A predictive model was trained (or fitted) using the 150,000 primary results and used to select 2050 molecules that had not yet been tested. The same model was used to identify 250 molecules that were screened in the 150,000 and found to be inactive, yet scored by the model as highly active. These 250 were the potential false negatives that were to be retested. Fully 55% of these false negatives were active upon retesting. The breakdown of hit rates is given in Table 1 . The 3% hit rate in the primary screen was a concern, as such a high number suggests a problem in the assay. It was found that there was a carryover problem in which sticky compounds were not being completely washed from the robotic tips. Such a trend can be found easily by analysis of hit rate as a function of well location. This problem was resolved before the secondary runs (rows 2 to 3 of the table) were made.",

Molecular diversity designs do offer great benefits, but more in the enhancement of the quality, rather than quantity, of information from a screen. It became clear that other properties of molecules, beyond mere structural novelty, need to be considered in screening. This led to extensive work on \"druglikeness\" and an attempt to achieve a balance between diversity and medicinal reasonableness of molecules.",

            "text": "The second context, general screening, involves selecting subsets of molecules for lead generation. Experimental designs are considered because it is not feasible to screen all molecules available. Even with the application of high-throughput screening, the demand for screening outpaces the capacity. This is due to the growth of in-house chemical databases, the number of molecules synthesized using combinatorial chemistry, and the increasing number of biological targets fueling discovery projects. In addition, novel screens that are not amenable to HTS automation may be attractive from a competitive standpoint but the gap between screening capacity and screening opportunities in this case is particularly daunting. Given this imbalance, methods for selecting finite subsets of molecules from potentially large chemical databases must be considered. Possible selection strategies include: random, diverse, and representative selection, each of which may be performed as a biased or directed analysis if information such as a druglikeness score is available to weight the analysis in favor of certain classes of molecules. A requirement of every selection method considered here is its computational feasibility for the databases of hundreds of thousands to millions of compounds that are now common with the application of combinatorial synthesis. For example, many distance-based selection strategies involve computation and storage of all pairwise distances for molecules in a database. If the number of molecules n is 300,000, then there are approximately 45 \u00d7 10 9 (calculated from ( n 2 )) distances to compute and/or to store. This is a formidable task, necessitating creative computational solutions. Figure 1 illustrates a modern paradigm of drug hunting processes. In this fictitious two-dimensional projection of the space of feasible druglike molecules, open circles represent compounds that are not active relative to a specific target, solid circles are active compounds, shown in one contiguous series of related molecules, and the star is the blockbuster drug that is still undiscovered. In a primary screen, finding a single solid circle is all that is needed. The medicinal chemistry teams can follow up by making systematic changes to any one of the active compounds to explore the whole series and find (or invent) the blockbuster drug. An important point is that the blockbuster may not exist in the corporate collection. A typical lead generation or lead optimization project involves not only testing molecules in current libraries, but also synthesis of new molecules. Molecular modification and subsequent testing is the way the trail gets blazed, through characterizing the SAR.",

This argument is motivated by the high rate of false negatives in primary screening. Thus screening two or more compounds from the same related series effectively gives pseudo replicates. If one compound turns out to be a false negative, it is likely that another from the same series will screen as positive and thus, the active series will not be missed. This rationale is popular in the industry. However, at Lilly we have demonstrated, through both simulations and retrospective analysis, that it is better to tolerate the false negatives in favor of sampling a larger number of different series. The motivating principle for this position is that testing two closely related compounds (or analogues) is often equivalent to testing the same hypothesis twice, which comes at the expense of testing a different hypothesis; see Wikel and Higgs (1997) .",

If there are no positively charged nitrogen atoms, or if there are more than two, the weight function is very low and otherwise very high.

When chemists discuss similarity of two molecules, they often make arguments about the biological effects or binding potential of the compounds.

An ideal set of molecular descriptors would be one that contains properties characterizing all aspects important to potency, selectivity, ADME, and toxicity. Because our understanding of any one of these processes is limited, expert judgment is needed.

A combinatorial chemistry collection at Lilly consisted of a number of separate libraries. The question arose as to which of the libraries was the most diverse. To answer this question, a spread design was used to rank the combinatorial molecules. We pooled 22 combinatorial libraries (105,640 molecules) with a set of 32,262 corporate library molecules. We rank ordered the combinatorial molecules relative to the corporate library molecules; that is, the corporate library molecules were marked as pre-selected and the task was for the combinatorial candidates to augment them as well as possible. The spread design chose molecules from the pool irrespective of which library they came from-the only criterion was their diversity. We examined the cumulative number of molecules selected from each combinatorial library as a function of spread design rank, as follows. The first molecule chosen was the one most dissimilar to the corporate collection and received a rank of 1. The next molecule was that which was most dissimilar to both the corporate collection and the first molecule, and received a rank of 2, and so on. Libraries that were drawn from most frequently by the algorithm in the early stages (early ranks) were taken to be the most diverse libraries. In the case of Figure 6 , library A was far better than library B at augmenting the current collection. This example shows how spread designs can be used to solve practical problems. There is always a descriptor selection problem, as chemists continue to invent new molecular descriptors. Which should be used? Which molecular similarity measure performs best? Controlled experiments are expensive. Simulation can be used as a guide.",

A good starting point for reading about such ensemble methods is the paper of Breiman (1996) and a valuable discussion about algorithmic versus parametric modeling approaches is provided by Breiman (2001b) . Hastie et al. (2001) gave a broad overview of statistical learning (see, especially, the figures on pages 194 and 199). Predictive models can serve as useful tools and have made substantive contributions to many disciplines. Figure 7 gives a brief layout of sequential steps for a typical data modeling exercise. The first step, which is by far the most time consuming, starts from a representation of the structures of the molecules and ends with a \"training set\" of descriptors to be used in the model selection step. Medchem filtering, in step 1, is an application of expert judgment to chemical structural data. Certain fragments of molecules are known to be highly reactive, or carcinogenic, or unstable, or otherwise undesirable, and these molecules can be eliminated at this first step with a simple rule-based algorithm.

Borrowing from the terminology of signal detection, the \"sensitivity\" of a model refers to the fraction of observed hits that are classified as (or predicted to be) hits by the model, and \"specificity\" refers to the fraction of observed inactives classified as inactives by the model. An observed hit is not necessarily an active molecule, but simply a molecule for which the primary screening result exceeded a decision threshold. Whether such a molecule turns out to be an active is a problem that involves the sensitivity of the assay, but the task at hand is for a model to predict accurately the primary screening outcome and to assess the accuracy of the model for that purpose.",

However, far more general is the recent development known as support vector machines. This method is based on a particular hyperplane in the descriptor or property space that separates the active from the inactive compounds. This plane has the largest possible distance from any of the labeled compounds and is known as the maximum margin separating hyperplane. Support vector machines avoid overfitting by choosing the maximum margin separating the hyperplane from among the many that can separate the positive from negative examples in the feature space.

Standard practice in machine learning is to use inductive learning, that is, taking known molecules and, through training or fitting a model, generating a general understanding of the underlying relationships and then applying that general knowledge to make a prediction about a new molecule, for example, whether it will cross the blood-brain barrier. If the ultimate goal is to make predictions for a finite set of observations, then the rationale behind transduction is that the inductive learning step is not necessarily needed. Transduction skips the inductive learning step and goes directly to the prediction of the future examples. A nice heuristic explanation of this is given by Vapnik (1998, page 355 ).

At Lilly we perform studies to select the best algorithm for a data set as well as the best model for a given algorithm, and finally to assess the error for a given model. A crucially important issue in model selection is the issue of model complexity, because training set error tends to decrease and test set error tends to increase with increasing model complexity; see, for example, Hastie et al. (2001), pages 194-199. For the example of variable subset selection in multiple linear regression, the R 2 statistic increases monotonically as the number of variables added to the regression model increases, leading to the situation dubbed as overfitting. Various methods have been devised for avoiding an overfitted model. Some methods are simple adjustments to the familar R 2 statistic, such as the adjusted R 2 (R 2 adj ) which adds a simple penalty for the number of covariates included in the model. Other popular methods include the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC), the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), and Mallow's C p ; see, for example, Burnham and Anderson (2002) . In the context of high-or medium-throughput screening, when little is known about a target or an SAR, and designed experiments are not possible, there are no a priori models that can be assumed and, in any case, the key interest in early stage screening is in predictive accuracy of models rather than inference about model parameters. When the model space is large, the problem becomes extreme. One solution is model averaging, in line with Breiman (1996) . One good use for this approach is in recursive partitioning or tree-based models. The model space for recursive partitioning is huge. Consider the special case of binary descriptors and an algorithm that iteratively partitions data into two parts, depending on descriptor values. Once a descriptor is used to split the data, it can never be used again. Thus the model space is much smaller than when the descriptors have more than two values. For binary descriptors, the number of possible tree models T (h) for a data set with h descriptors can be computed from a simple recursive formula:",

This metric, labeled S, ranges from \u22121 to +1 and compares the predicted and actual responses. The weights are higher earlier in the sorted list to emphasize that, in practice, it is the top of the sorted list that will identify the molecules selected for testing, and that accuracy farther down the list is not nearly as important. We have very little interest in accurately distinguishing the relative activity levels of molecules that are all considered inactive, but a great deal of interest in the degree to which actives will rise to the top of a sorted list of molecules. Quality assessments have been assigned to various values of S, but these levels in isolation are not meaningful; a very high value of S (or R 2 , or any other metric) can easily be obtained for observations that are in the training set of a model, but does not predict how the model will perform on untested molecules. The thresholds established are based on appropriate test hold-out results, as described below. With this in mind, a value of zero is equivalent to random (the mean value resulting from scrambling the predicted responses and computing S many times). A value of 0.40 is considered a minimum standard for a model to be used for decision making at Lilly. Such a model would be considered weak and would not be used at all by some scientists. A model with an S value of 0.60 is considered a solid and useful model and an S value above 0.80 indicates a very good model. A difference in values of less than 0.05 is not considered to be meaningful. Thus, if one were doing model selection and two competing models were statistically significantly different but the difference in mean S were below 0.05, the two models would be treated as equivalent. At Lilly, we couple the concept of significant differences with the concept of meaningful differences.",

At Lilly, the modeling methods used do the subset selection intrinsically.

Miller (2002, pages 148-150) recommended fivefold to tenfold validation, so that effectively 80% to 90% of the data should be in the training set. Another recommendation is that n 3/4 of the data should make up a training set (randomly selected) and the rest predicted as test hold-out data; see Shao (1993) for details. However, it is easy to show that use of the n 3/4 rule does not perform well in settings such as drug discovery where prediction accuracy, rather than selection of the true model, is the objective. We are sometimes better off with a model that is not the true model but a simpler model for which we can make good estimates of the parameters (leading to more accurate predicted values).",

This we call a learning curve (but note that the phrase is used in other contexts with other meanings). Figure 10 shows the performance of the two candidate modeling methods applied to the BBB data set of Section 6.5. We generated 20 sampling runs for each level of Ptrain, where Ptrain is the proportion of the data assigned randomly to the training set, and used the two methods over a broad profile of training set sizes. The two lines connect the means of the values of S obtained for the two methods at each Ptrain level. The same train/test splits were used for both the PLS and the random forest methods. Thus a paired or block analysis was done. Here, we could ask whether the random forest method is superior over all Ptrain levels and use a test such as Tukey's HSD (Honestly Significant Difference; see Tukey, 1997 , Kramer, 1956 . This is perhaps conservative in that we are not interested in all of the pairwise comparisons but, as we can see from simply looking at the plot, any formal comparison is going to give an unambiguous result for this data set. There is a minimum size of training set necessary for a statistical model to be able to reveal links between vectors of descriptor values and biological activity. This has been called \"statistical traction\" by Young et al. (2002) . Suppose a particular pharmacophoric feature is important for the binding of molecules to a receptor. Having one molecule that binds and has that feature is not sufficient for that feature to be detected as significant. Several examples of molecules that bind and contain that feature are needed before the statistical algorithm can detect it. In the model selection stage, it is possible to place a downward bias on the estimate of the predictive power of an algorithm by selecting for the training set a subset of the data that is too small. There may be a lack of \"statistical traction\" in the training subset that would not exist when the model is trained on all the available data. On the other hand, when the proportion of data selected for the training set is very large, and the test set is correspondingly small, it is more likely that a given test set molecule has a very similar \"neighbor\" in the training set and this gives an upward bias to the estimate of predictive power of the model.",

Additionally, HTS strategies lead to the large-scale consumption of valuable resources such as proteins and chemicals from the inventory, and may not be applicable to all targets (Major, 1999) . The problem is fueled, in particular, by the prospects of expanding universes of targets-an increase by a factor of 10 is expected (Drews. 2000 )-that will lead to an explosion of costs. As a consequence, there is a need not only to increase the scope of screening, but also the efficiency of each screening experiment. Hybrid screening strategies have been suggested that unite in silico and in vitro screening in one integrated process. Iterative medium-throughput screening (MTS) starts with a small (200 to 20,000) and \"diverse\" subset of compounds. This initial sample is subjected to a primary screening where the main objective is to gather SAR data for predictive model building. This is a key distinction from the older paradigm where the primary objective is to obtain an initial set of screening hits, and any subsequent model building is an added bonus. Based on this first SAR, the corporate inventory is screened in silico in order to identify a further, more focused set of compounds, the focused library, for a second round of MTS. Several cycles of testing-analyzing-testing can be applied aimed at either refining the SAR model(s) or the identification of more active compounds. Abt et al.

This distinction and the consequent effects are dramatic. In active learning, the most interesting compounds are the ones for which the model has had difficulty in the assignment of a clear classification whereas, in a typical drug hunting program, the most interesting compounds are the ones that are scored the most unambiguously as active. This has downstream implications on what will come out of future iterations of screening. The traditional business-driven approach will find good compounds faster, but the active learning approach will generate better models faster, and eventually lead to better exploration of chemical space, resulting in finding the best compounds.",

This places a handicap on any toxicity modeling effort. If the goal is to develop a good toxicity model (which would reduce the need for animal testing and reduce cycle time in the project), then compounds that are not interesting from a potency standpoint would need to be tested for toxicity.

Then a number of \"substituents\" are chosen; these can be thought of as the \"appendages\" that gets attached to the backbone at various (preselected) locations. All (reasonable) combinations of scaffolds and substituents can be made in silico and these structures form a virtual library. The library may contain millions of molecules but it is more typical to see something of the order of 500,000 structures. This is because most virtual screening efforts are knowledge driven; something is known about the SAR before the virtual screen is attempted. Most of the molecules in the virtual library will not exist in the corporate molecular stores. This virtual library is then the subject of a modeling effort whereby the virtual library is prioritized and rank ordered, with the most promising structures at the top of the list.

The last equation defines the probability that a molecule is determined to be a hit in a biochemical assay given that the virtual screen predicts the molecule to be a hit. This probability is of great interest because it is valuable to have an estimate of the hit rate one can expect for a subset of molecules that are selected by a virtual screen. The values of parameters p, \u03b1, and \u03b2 can be varied to observe the effect on equation (3). It is straightforward to verify that the \"power\" of the classifier (1 \u2212 \u03b2) has relatively little effect on the hit rate observed in the subset of molecules selected by a virtual screen. The influence of power is greatly reduced as the probability of a hit existing in the set of compounds being scored decreases (the low prevalence effect) and, for rare events, the relative importance of \u03b1 is greatly intensified. Even for less rare events, say a hit rate of 10% (disturbingly high in drug discovery, suggesting nonspecificity in the assay), the effect of \u03b1 dominates. 11 Drugability of Molecules: ADME, Solubility, Toxicity",

A compound may have potent effects in vitro screens involving cells or enzymes, but in a living organism the compound may have no effect because of a distribution problem. This can be due to a number of things; for example, the compound may bind so tightly to proteins in the bloodstream that it does not leave the bloodstream until it is eliminated by the liver. The opposite extreme can be a problem as well, because proteins in the blood can be important as transport mechanisms. In addition, the unbound drug may penetrate the wall of the blood vessel so that a certain amount of protein binding is desirable.

Orally administered drugs, after absorption through the gut lumen into the portal circulation, must then pass through the liver before reaching the systemic circulation. Pre-systemic or first pass extraction refers to the removal of drugs during this first pass through the liver. First pass clearance is the extent to which a drug is removed by the liver during its first passage from the portal blood on its way to the systemic circulation. Oral bioavailability is the fraction of the dose that reaches the systemic circulation as intact drug.

Many of these efforts are statistically destitute; for example, a research group may examine only a set of molecules that do cross the BBB. Proper inference must involve examples of compounds that do not cross the BBB as well as compounds that do and this falls in the domain of predictive modeling and machine learning (see Section 6). The BBB is formed by the highly selective capillaries of the central nervous system. Passage of drugs through the BBB may occur by passive diffusion or from various specific uptake mechanisms, many of which are there to supply nutrients to the brain. There are also mechanisms for transporting substances out of the brain. P-glycoprotein (or Pgp) is an efflux pump that removes many drug compounds from the brain.

These compounds undergo metabolism, which is a way for the body to break down and ultimately eliminate a substance. The liver uses a number of different enzymes to break a compound down into smaller parts, called metabolites. A metabolite may either be pharmacologically similar to the parent compound or harmless, but not pharmacologically active, or may possess life-threatening toxicity. Thus it is essential to know into which of these categories a drug falls and it is desirable to control this aspect in a favorable way.

This is an extremely challenging undertaking because it requires the simultaneous control of several medicinal chemistry components. Furthermore, many of these components are not independent and, in fact, may even be negatively correlated. To do parallel optimization, it is also necessary to generate drugability related information in the early stages of lead optimization.",

            "text": "Decisions in drug discovery are almost always multidimensional. Numerous criteria must be managed in order to develop a successful drug: potency, selectivity, toxicity, and ADME characteristics, and these tend to have conflicting trends so that difficult decisions are forced on scientists. For example, Zyprexa is an excellent antipsychotic drug but it causes weight gain in most people, a side effect of almost all antipsychotic drugs. Why this happens is still being investigated and there are at least six different hypotheses given in the literature. It is possible to modify an antipsychotic drug so that it does not produce weight gain, but such modifications may reduce the potency of the drug or introduce other side effects which may be even worse. A common side effect, for example, of many antipsychotic drugs is \"extrapyramidal side effects\" (EPS) which produce symptoms such as tremors, rigidity, and slowness of movement. These are deemed by most to be worse than weight gain. Less clear-cut trade-offs might involve the propensity for a molecule to cross the blood-brain barrier versus the therapeutic effect desired. For example, Benadryl is still a popular drug because, in spite of its tendency to induce a feeling of somnolescence, it is an extremely potent histamine (H1) blocker. Specificity is a problem faced by virtually every project team in drug discovery. Potency is desired at one receptor but not at another.",

            "text": "The old paradigm in drug discovery, which might be labeled \"sequential search,\" generally fails. With this paradigm, one would optimize each objective independently and in succession. Finding a lead compound corresponds to searching on one landscape. Optimizing the lead corresponds to searching additional landscapes starting with the results of searching the first. With more than two objectives, the likelihood of failure increases exponentially. What is needed is a holistic approach with a mathematical framework for considering trade-offs between objectives. A variety of algorithms exists for finding the best possible trade-offs; these are used surprisingly seldom despite their utility.",

            "text": "One strategy involves restricting a search to only those solutions that are Pareto optimal. A solution is Pareto optimal if there is no other solution that is better under one criterion without being worse for the other criteria. It is often true that not every response has the same importance; for example, avoiding EPS symptoms might be 50-fold more important to a team than avoiding weight gain. Although Pareto optimality provides more than one solution, it does not allow different weightings on different criteria, as this is difficult to manage with more than two dimensions. Another useful approach is Derringer's desirability function which does allow weights to be assigned to each criterion (Derringer, 1980) . The desirability function involves transformation of each criterion to a desirability value d, where 0 \u2264 d \u2264 1. The transformation is done in such a way that the value of d increases as the \"desirability\" of the corresponding criterion increases. This transformation may be linear, quadratic, step function, and so on. In the terminology of decision theory, these are monotonic utility functions. The individual desirabilities are then combined using a geometric mean, which is an overall assessment of the desirability of the combined response levels. It can be a weighted mean where the weights reflect relative importance of the criteria.",

Within the next decade, researchers will almost certainly find most human genes and their locations. Explorations into the function of each one is a major challenge extending far into the next century and will shed light on how faulty genes play a role in disease causation. With this knowledge, commercial efforts will shift towards developing a new generation of therapeutics based on genes. Drug design will be revolutionized as researchers create new classes of medicines based on a reasoned approach using gene sequence and protein structure information rather than the traditional trial-and-error method. The drugs, targeted to specific sites in the body, will not have the side effects prevalent in many of today's medicines. Over 150 clinical gene therapy trials are now in progress in the United States, most for different kinds of cancers.",

            "text": "Robots: Used in a number of processes: screening compounds for biological activity, inoculating microbial cultures, and filling compound libraries. High-throughput screening (HTS): Technology where robotics is used to test many compounds rapidly in an effort to identify novel inhibitors of receptors or enzymes. Usually 100,000 to 200,000 compounds are screened. Medium-throughput screening (MTS): Similar to HTS but with only modest throughput requirements which implies more careful usage of robotics and higher quality of data. Typical MTS throughput is 1000 to 10000 compounds. Combinatorial chemistry (Combi Chem): Used to make thousands of variants of a compound. Consider a compound with a six-membered aromatic ring and a chlorine atom attached at a certain position. One might change the location of the chlorine to any of the other five positions, or change the chlorine to a fluorine or a bromine, and/or make the same changes at all the other five positions. To enumerate all the possible combinations is to make a combinatorial library. Genomic information: Used to identify possible protein therapies and targets, to develop biomarkers, and to understand more deeply how a given compound interacts with a complex living system. X-ray crystallography, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR): Used in exploring the physical properties/shape of a molecule and/or a receptor target. If the structure of the target is known, docking studies can be done to assess how well a molecule may \"fit\" in one of the receptor's binding sites. Bioinformatics tools: Used to search enormous volumes of biological information, for instance, to find the best genomic match of a nucleotide sequence or learn the chromosomal location and disease linked to a particular gene. We may know that a compound evokes a biological response but with genomics and bioinformatics tools we can examine which proteins are affected by the compound. Cheminformatics tools: Used to explore the relationship between the structure of a compound and the biological response it evokes (the SAR), with a view toward predicting what will happen with new, as yet untested compounds. Also used to model the docking of a small molecule (or ligand) to a protein or receptor.",
