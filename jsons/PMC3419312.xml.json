            "text": "The primary genetic information contained in messenger RNA (mRNA) is bundled into packets of three nucleotides termed codons (reviewed in Ref 1). Each codon is recognized by the anticodon loop of a specific transfer RNA (tRNA), the 3\u2032 ends of which are charged with specific amino acids. Thus, each codon encodes a specific amino acid (or information instructing the translational apparatus to terminate translation). The ribosome is an ancient molecular machine that brings mRNAs and tRNAs together to synthesize the proteins encoded by the mRNAs using the amino acids supplied by the tRNAs (reviewed in Ref 2). The ribosome is composed of multiple RNAs (called ribosomal RNAs, rRNAs) and proteins divided into two separate subunits (SU), termed large (LSU) and small (SSU). mRNAs are threaded through the SSU of the ribosome, and the stepwise, codon by codon, progression of the ribosome along the mRNA from the 5\u2032 to 3\u2032 direction is a process called translocation. The direct interaction between mRNA and tRNAs occurs on the surface of the SSU in a region called the decoding center: here the codons of mRNAs form stable base pairing interactions with the anticodon loops of tRNAs. A second functional center located in the LSU is called the peptidyltransferase center (PTC). Here, the 3\u2032 ends of tRNAs are brought into close proximity with one another in an entirely RNA\u2010based environment that catalyzes formation of peptide bonds (reviewed in Ref 3). A third major functional center is the elongation and termination factor binding site. This is composed of a complex surface area formed by both subunits where trans\u2010acting GTPases bind to the ribosome to either (1) deliver aminoacyl\u2010tRNAs (aa\u2010tRNAs) to the ribosome or (2) deliver a structurally similar translocase or termination factors. Interactions between these factors both enhance the intrinsic rate of peptide synthesis and ensure the directionality of ribosome movement along the mRNA. Given the triplet nature of codons, each mRNA contains three potential translational reading frames. Thus, one of the central questions in molecular and structural biology is to understand how the ribosome initially chooses the \u2018correct\u2019 reading frame, and how it manages to coordinate the activities of multiple functional centers so as to maintain reading frame throughout the course of translating mRNAs.",

            "text": "To understand how translational reading frame is established, it is important to understand how the structure of the ribosome affects its function. The SSU contains a single rRNA species in all organisms, which ranges in size from 16S in bacteria and archae, to 18S in eukaryotes, and contains a minimum of 21 proteins, which expands to up to 33 in higher organisms (reviewed in Ref 7). As discussed above, base pairing interactions between mRNA codons and tRNA anticodons occur in the decoding center of the SSU, which is located near the 3\u2032 end of its rRNA. The LSU of bacteria and archae contain two rRNAs, 23S and 5S, and approximately 31 proteins. In eukaryotes, the proteinacious component has expanded to up to 49 proteins, and a small fragment of the 23S rRNA appears to have become detached and evolved into a separate rRNA, called 5.8S. Interestingly, while 5.8S rRNA is a distinct molecule, structural analyses reveals that it is physically located in the same place, along the \u2018rear\u2019 solvent accessible side of the LSU, as its corresponding sequence in bacterial and archaeal ribosomes.8, 9, 10 Also different is the expansion of the major LSU rRNA in eukaryotes, ranging from 25S rRNA in yeast to 28S rRNA in metazoans. The LSU interacts with the SSU, and contains three distinct pockets for binding of tRNAs: the A\u2010site specifically binds aa\u2010tRNAs, the P\u2010site binds initiator tRNAs and tRNAs linked to elongating polypeptides (peptidyl\u2010tRNAs), and the E\u2010site binds deacylated tRNAs. Nascent peptides are extruded from the PTC through a tunnel where they exit from the \u2018back\u2019 side of the LSU.10 In addition, trans\u2010acting factors involved in delivering aa\u2010tRNAs and involved in termination are recruited through interactions with both the SSU and LSU.11 While these functional centers are the features of the ribosome most pertinent to this chapter, it should be noted that the ribosome contains additional functional elements.",

            "text": "Returning to the question of reading frame establishment, translation initiation differs between bacteria/archae, and eukaryotes. In bacteria/archae, special sequences (the Shine\u2013Dalgarno sequence, or SD) located near the 5\u2032 ends of their mRNAs are complementary to sequence located near the 3\u2032 end of the 16S rRNA (the anti\u2010SD sequence). This complementarity enables the SD on the mRNA to hybridize with the anti\u2010SD on the SSU, properly positioning the initiation codon in the P\u2010site of the decoding center in the SSU, and independent initiation events can be directed on polycistronic mRNAs by separate SD sequences 5\u2032 of each initiation site.12 Furthermore, variability in the distance between the SD and the initiation codon means that the SD is not sufficient to determine reading frame by itself: this process also requires initiator tRNA and initiation factor 2 (IF2). In eukaryotes, correct positioning of the initiator AUG on the ribosome is a much more complex process involving many more steps and trans\u2010acting factors. This includes recruitment of the SSU in complex with initiator tRNA and other IFs to the 5\u2032 end of the mRNA and scanning of this 43S preinitiation complex along the mRNA in the 3\u2032 direction. Nonetheless, recruitment of the initiator\u2010Met\u2010tRNA to the correct AUG remains the central element in reading frame establishment.13 Similarly, initiator tRNAs are universally recruited to the ribosomal P\u2010site (again with a few exceptions that have been of great utility). Recruitment of tRNA to this site is unique to translation initiation: during the remaining course of mRNA translation, subsequent aa\u2010RNAs, and even protein factors that mediate translation termination are recruited to the A\u2010site. In bacteria and archae, the initiator\u2010Met\u2010tRNA is formylated (fMet\u2010tRNA), unlike elongator Met\u2010tRNAs. Eukaryotes encode two distinct species of Met\u2010tRNAs, one specializing in initiation, the other in elongation. While the mechanics of translation initiation differ greatly between bacteria/archae and eukaryotes, recruitment of initiator\u2010Met\u2010tRNAs to the P\u2010site of the SSU is the central feature of translation initiation in all organisms. In sum, translational reading frame is generally established by bringing a special species of tRNA to an AUG codon positioned at the ribosomal P\u2010site.",

            "text": "Having established translational reading frame on an mRNA, the ribosome must maintain it throughout the remaining course of translation, the bulk of which is termed the elongation phase. The first step of elongation occurs when elongator tRNAs are brought to the ribosome in association with a trans\u2010acting factor, called EF\u2010Tu in bacteria/archae, and eEF1A in eukaryotes, and GTP, forming the ternary complex (TC). The anticodon loop of elongator aa\u2010tRNA is delivered to the decoding center in the A\u2010site of the SSU, where a correct match between the mRNA codon and aa\u2010tRNA anticodon results in formation of a mini\u2010helix that is recognized and stabilized by additional interactions between both SSU rRNA bases and proteins.14 This in turn results in a structural rearrangement of the SSU and aa\u2010tRNA, which transduces information that causes EF\u2010Tu/eEF1A to hydrolyze GTP, releasing the tRNA from the elongation factor (reviewed in Ref 13). The aminoacylated 3\u2032 end of the aa\u2010tRNA then moves in a process called accommodation, from outside of the LSU through a structural element (the accommodation corridor), and into the A\u2010site side of the PTC. Simultaneously, EF\u2010Tu/eEF1A + GDP is released from the ribosome to be recharged with GTP and aa\u2010tRNAs.15 Catalysis, i.e., peptidyltransfer, occurs in the PTC, where the methionine is transferred from the initiator\u2010tRNA to the elongator tRNA in a process that involves both steric positioning and active catalysis through a transesterification reaction by the ribosome. After this process, the 3\u2032 end of the deacylated tRNA moves to the E\u2010site on the LSU, the 3\u2032 end of the dipeptidyl\u2010tRNA moves to the P\u2010site of the LSU, while the anticodon loops of both tRNAs remain bound to the P\u2010 and A\u2010sites of the SSU respectively. This conformation is called the \u2018hybrid state\u2019 because the tRNAs occupy one site on the LSU and another on the SSU.16 It is also at this step that the ribosome reorients itself from the \u2018classical\u2019 or \u2018unrotated\u2019 state to the \u2018ratcheted\u2019 or \u2018rotated\u2019 state, a process that involves a complex spatial repositioning of the two subunits relative to one another (reviewed in Refs 17, 18). The next step in the process is where reading frame maintenance comes into play: translocation. Here, a second trans\u2010acting factor, EF\u2010G/eEF2, is recruited to the ribosome. Hydrolysis of GTP by this protein leads to a transition state for translocation where the ribosome disengages from the tRNA\u2013mRNA complexes to allow movement of the anticodons of the P and A\u2010site tRNAs. This movement, coupled with release of the elongation factor, results in full tRNA occupation of the E and P\u2010sites by the deacylated tRNA and dipeptidyl\u2010tRNA, respectively, leaving an empty A\u2010site ready for the next aa\u2010tRNA to decode the next codon.15 It is thought that the two subunit nature of the ribosome separates movement of the body of the tRNA on the LSU from that of the mRNA/tRNA complexes on the SSU, enabling it to faithfully maintain translational reading frame (reviewed in Ref 17). More recently, high resolution methods have revealed numerous structural features that are thought to work in concert to assure that tRNAs remain correctly positioned in the ribosome, and that translocation is precisely limited to three nucleotides.18 Subsequent rounds of elongation reiterate this cycle until the ribosome encounters a termination codon (UUA, UGA, or UAG). Termination codons are specifically recognized by release factors (RF1 and RF2 in bacteria/archae, eF1\u2010eRF3 complex in eukaryotes) that are structural mimics of the TC, which specifically recognize termination codons.19 The lack of an amino donor site by the RFs enables a water molecule to enter the PTC, promoting hydrolysis of the C\u2010terminus of the nascent polypeptide chain from the peptidyl\u2010tRNA, resulting in peptide release.20\n",

            "text": "Our understanding of \u22121 PRF originates from studies of RNA viruses, many of which use this molecular mechanism to expand the information content of their mRNAs. The relatively large number of viral \u22121 PRF signals has enabled definition of some of the parameters constituting a \u22121 PRF signal. The most well\u2010defined \u22121 PRF phenomena are directed by an mRNA sequence motif composed of three important elements: a \u2018slippery site\u2019 composed of seven nucleotides where the translational shift in reading frame actually takes place; a short spacer sequence of usually less than 12 nucleotides; and a downstream stimulatory structure (usually an mRNA pseudoknot). A \u2018typical\u2019 \u22121 PRF signal is shown in Figure 1(a). In eukaryotic viruses, the slippery site has the heptameric motif N NNW WWH (IUPAC notation), where the incoming reading frame is indicated by spaces.23 In general, it has been accepted that the downstream structure causes elongating ribosomes to pause with tRNAs positioned at the slippery site. The nature of the slippery sequence enables repairing of the nonwobble bases of both the aa and peptidyl\u2010tRNAs with the \u22121 frame codons.24 While it is generally accepted that mRNA pseudoknots are the most common type of downstream stimulatory elements, other mRNA structures are capable of filling this role as well.25, 26, 27 Generally, it is thought that the essential function of the stimulatory structure is to provide an energetic barrier to an elongating ribosome, and to position it over the slippery site. However, the thermodynamic stability of the downstream barrier is not the sole determinant of frameshift efficiency: additional parameters, both known and unknown influence this parameter.28\n",

From this general conceptual framework, the precise mechanistic details of \u22121 PRF have been debated, and three apparently competing models were proposed for the mechanism of \u22121 PRF. In each of these, physical slippage of the ribosome is coupled to the energetic input of GTP hydrolysis. The \u2018integrated model\u2019 model of \u22121 PRF posited that the shift occurs after delivery of the aa\u2010tRNA to the A\u2010site, but before peptidyltransfer.23 This corresponds to Box 2 in Figure 1(b). A refinement of this model, called the \u20189\u00c5 solution\u2019 proposed that the downstream stimulatory element plays an active role in \u22121 PRF by resisting 5\u2032 movement of the mRNA subsequent to aa\u2010tRNA accommodation (enabled by eEF1A hydrolysis of GTP). This creates tension along the mRNA that can be relieved by disengaging the tRNAs from the mRNA, thus allowing the mRNA to shift forward by one base relative to the tRNA/ribosome complex.29 A second model proposed that \u22121 PRF occurs during translocation, where the energy driving slippage is supplied by eEF2 hydrolysis of GTP, and the downstream stimulatory element resists forward movement of the ribosome, resulting in translocation by only two nucleotides. Importantly, this cotranslocation model can occur through two discrete kinetic pathways. One of these pathways occurs after peptidyltransfer, with the two tRNAs moving to P/E and A/P states, followed by an incomplete, two\u2010base translocation event.30, 31 This is denoted by Box 3 in Figure 1(b). The second cotranslocational model proposed that incomplete translocation stimulated by the downstream element occurs one elongation cycle earlier: here, the E and P\u2010site tRNAs slip so that the new A\u2010site codon is in the \u22121 frame32 as indicated by Box 1 in Figure 1(b).\n",

However, it is clear that +1 PRF is also driven by cis\u2010acting elements that cause elongating ribosomes to kinetically partition into the +1 frame, and that slippage of P\u2010site tRNA appear to be the most important parameter. However, the precise mechanisms are different for different +1 PRF signals. In the bacterial cases such as the E. coli prfB mRNA, the U CUU UGA slippery site contains the in frame UGA termination codon which is recognized by RF2.41 While translation termination is efficient when RF2 levels are high, low RF2 levels result in inefficient recognition of the UGA codon. This causes the ribosome to pause. An SD\u2010like sequence located in the prfB mRNA immediately 5\u2032 of the slippery site interacts with the anti\u2010SD sequence on the 16S rRNA so as to reposition the ribosome in the +1 frame. Thus, RF2 production is autoregulated through +1 PRF.42 More recently, mathematical modeling of the prfB +1 PRF signal revealed that this mechanism is influenced by three distinct kinetic parameters: (1) destabilization of deacylated tRNA in the E\u2010site, (2) rearrangement of peptidyl\u2010tRNA in the P\u2010site, and (3) the availability of cognate aa\u2010tRNA corresponding to the A\u2010site.43 While all three function synergistically to promote efficient +1 PRF, a rate constant of \u2248\ufe011.9 s\u22121 for slippage of the P\u2010site tRNA from CUU to UUU is the driving force behind this mechanism. The +1 PRF is also enhanced by the presence of a \u2018hungry codon\u2019 in the A\u2010site (i.e., low abundance of RF2), and destabilization of tRNA\u2013mRNA interactions in the E\u2010site.",

Thus, the +1 PRF kinetic partitioning must be driven by other mechanisms. In OAZ mRNA +1 PRF, the primary kinetic trap appears to be the presence of a strong secondary mRNA structure 3\u2032 of the slippery site. However, the element that stimulates OAZ +1 PRF has undergone a significant amount of evolutionary divergence. For example, while almost all vertebrate OAZ +1 PRF signals involve mRNA pseudoknots, fewer protostome OAZ sequences contain predicted pseudoknots, most nematodes lack the ability to form this type of structure, and no pseudoknots can be calculated in any yeast/fungi or insect OAZ +1 PRF signals.39 Similarly, the slippery sites of OAZ have diverged. The metazoan OAZ slippery site is UCC UGA U,44 but has degenerated in fungi and arthropods.45 Importantly, similar to prfB, the OAZ +1 frameshift is stimulated by a 0\u2010frame A\u2010site UGA codon, and is also primarily dependent on tRNA\u2013mRNA interactions in the ribosomal P\u2010site. For example, mutation of the rat OAZ P\u2010site sequence from UCC to CCC inhibited frameshifting in S. cerevisiae.39 Also similar to pfrB, the E\u2010site of the OAZ +1 PRF signal also modulates frameshifting efficiency, although this is less well understood.39 OAZ +1 PRF is also autoregulated: it is stimulated by polyamines.46 Neutralization of negative charge repulsion by positively charged polyamines may facilitate the formation of mRNA\u2013rRNA interactions that enhance tRNA slippage in the P\u2010site while the ribosome is paused at the 0\u2010frame UGA termination codon. Importantly, OAZ +1 PRF is autoregulated. Ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) catalyzes the first step in polyamine biosynthesis, while OAZ downregulates polyamine synthesis by stimulating ubiquitin\u2010independent degradation of ODC by the proteasome. Thus, increased levels of polyamines negatively feedback on polyamine synthesis by stimulating +1 PRF, and hence the synthesis of OAZ.",

Unlike the prior two examples however, this slippery site does not contain a 0\u2010frame termination codon. Rather, the kinetic trap is supplied by the rare A\u2010site AGG codon, which is decoded by the low abundance Arg\u2010tRNACCU tRNA. Overexpression of this tRNA caused a 50\u2010fold decrease in +1 PRF, while deleting it caused +1 PRF efficiency to approach 100%.48 The +1 frameshifts of Ty2 and Ty4, and other members of the copia family of retrotransposable elements are thought to utilize this mechanism of tRNA slippage, as well as the yeast ABP140 frameshift signal.37, 49 While, the genome organization of the Ty3\ngypsy\u2010like yeast retrotransposon is similar to Ty1,50 its +1 PRF signal is different. The GCG AGU U slippery site disallows the possibility of the 0\u2010frame tRNA in the P\u2010site to base pair with the +1 frame.36 It is thought that Ty3\u2010directed +1 PRF involves skipping the first A of the 0\u2010frame P\u2010site codon followed by recognition of the +1 frame GUU codon. Further analysis demonstrated that +1 PRF depended on some special characteristic of the Ala\u2010tRNAUGC, and that this was also shared by four more tRNAs. A downstream stimulatory element is also been proposed to constitute the kinetic trap utilized in Ty3 +1 PRF. While the original hypothesis involving direct base pairing between this sequence and the 18S rRNA helix 1851 has been ruled out, a very stringent set of mutagenesis experiments suggest that the Ty3 stimulatory element may interact with rRNA and ribosomal proteins in the ribosomal entry tunnel, as well as unknown constituents of the solvent face of the 40S subunit.52 Interestingly, while the EST3 slippery site is identical to that of Ty1 and frameshifting is dependent on limiting quantities of cognate A\u2010site tRNA, its +1 PRF signal also contains a downstream stimulatory element.53 It has been speculated that interaction of this element with specific targets of the paused ribosome may limit A\u2010site access by tRNAs.",

The mRNAs of many such viruses, e.g., totiviruses, Ty elements, and most retroviruses, contain two or more overlapping ORFs in which the major viral nucleocapsid proteins (e.g., Gag) are encoded by a 5\u2032 ORF, while sequences encoding proteins with enzymatic functions (typically Pro and Pol) are located 3\u2032 of, and out\u2010of\u2010frame with, the Gag ORF. The enzymatic proteins are only translated as a result of PRF events that occur at frequencies of 1\u201340% depending on the specific virus and assay system employed.54 This ensures production of a greater ratio of structural nucleocapsid proteins to products having enzymatic/replicative activities. The importance of maintaining precise ratios of structural to enzymatic proteins on viral propagation has been demonstrated using two endogenous viruses of the yeast S.\ncerevisiae and two retroviruses. In the yeast dsRNA L\u2010A \u2018killer\u2019 virus, Gag\u2010pol dimerization nucleates formation of the viral particle.55 Small alterations in programmed frameshifting efficiencies promote rapid loss of the virus, and it is thought that increasing the amount of Gag\u2010pol protein synthesized may cause too many particles to initiate nonproductively while producing too little may prevent efficient dimerization.56 Similarly, increasing or decreasing the efficiency of the +1 ribosomal frameshift in the Ty1 retrotransposable element of yeast results in reduced retrotranspostion frequencies by inhibiting proteolytic processing of the TyA\u2010TyB polyprotein (Gag\u2010pol equivalent), thus blocking formation of the mature forms of RNase H, integrase and reverse transcriptase.48 Similarly, changing the ratio of Gag to Gag\u2010pol proteins in retroviruses like HIV or Moloney Murine Leukemia Virus interferes with virus\u2010particle formation.57, 58, 59, 60, 61 In these viruses, overexpression of the Gag\u2010pol protein also resulted in inefficient processing of the polyprotein and inhibition of virus production.",

This engendered the hypothesis that \u22121 PRF is used by cells to control mRNA abundance and stability through the nonsense\u2010mediated mRNA decay (NMD) pathway. A proof\u2010of\u2010principle study demonstrated that (1) a well\u2010characterized viral \u22121 PRF signal can act as an mRNA destabilizing element in cis, (2) mRNA destabilization required an intact NMD pathway, and (3) the extent of mRNA destabilization was inversely proportional to \u22121 PRF efficiency.93 A follow\u2010up study using a series of \u22121 PRF signals isolated from four endogenous cellular mRNAs from S. cerevisiae showed that a subset of these also promoted mRNA degradation through the no\u2010go decay (NGD) pathway, presumably because frameshift\u2010promoting mRNA secondary structures also promote sufficiently long ribosome pausing to activate this pathway.94 These two mRNA destabilization pathways are shown in Figure 3. In that study, more detailed investigations revealed that the EST2 mRNA, encoding the catalytic subunit of telomerase, was destabilized by \u22121 PRF, and that ablation of \u22121 PRF signals in this mRNA promoted its stabilization. Unpublished work in our laboratory has identified functional \u22121 PRF signals in mRNAs encoding additional subunits in yeast telomerase, suggesting that PRF may play a role in telomere length homeostasis by controlling the abundance and relative ratios of telomerase\u2010associated factors.",

As described above, regulation would have to involve mechanisms that would target specific signals rather than promoting global changes in PRF. Autoregulation as described for OAZ and prfB +1 PRF provide one such PRF signal\u2010specific mechanism. However, in these cases the products encoded by frameshift events directly feedback on the PRF signals. This would not apply to most other cellular \u22121 PRF signals because they do not encode any new protein products. Thus, regulation should involve the use of sequence\u2010specific trans\u2010acting factors. In addition, the ability of \u22121 PRF signals to direct mRNA destabilization in a manner that is inversely proportional to \u22121 PRF rates93,97 would suggest that, rather than turning \u22121 PRF completely on or off, trans\u2010acting regulatory factors may function to increase or decrease rates of \u22121 PRF, thus providing for nuanced effects on gene expression that could be fine\u2010tuned to specific circumstances. As discussed above, the ability of synthetic oligonucleotide\u2010based compounds to alter rates of \u22121 PRF suggests that naturally occurring oligonucleotides, e.g., small noncoding RNAs, may hold the key to regulation of \u22121 PRF. Base pairing interactions would provide the requisite sequence specificity, and their potential ability to either disrupt or stabilize \u22121 PRF promoting mRNA tertiary structures would provide them with the capacity to promote increased or decreased rates of \u22121 PRF. These two possibilities are shown in Figure 4. Indeed, preliminary studies from our laboratory have identified at least two endogenous micro\u2010RNAs (miRNAs) capable of stimulating \u20101 PRF in a human mRNA. As a final thought, if PRF is an important regulator of cellular gene expression, then mutations in \u22121 PRF signals might impact PRF rates, and hence mRNA stability and protein abundance. We suggest that this may explain why some single nucleotide polymorphisms have been shown to promote discernable phenotypes, e.g., inherited diseases, despite the fact that they are silent with regard to the amino acids that they encode.",

This is not because viruses are special, but rather because their small genomes help to increase signal\u2010to\u2010noise ratios, thus facilitating the scientific discovery process. Indeed, as obligate intracellular parasites, viruses are subject to the same rules and regulations that govern their host cells. Thus, while PRF was first thought to be a virus\u2010specific mechanism, it is becoming clear that cellular mRNAs employ this mechanism as well. The study of PRF continues to illuminate our understanding of how ribosomes normally maintain reading frame. In particular, viewed from a kinetic standpoint, we have come to understand that \u22121 PRF represents an endpoint resulting from changes in kinetic partitioning at different steps along a reaction pathway rather than a single mechanism. We hope that this kinetic view of \u22121 PRF will be useful in identifying specific targets for antiviral therapeutics. Another recurring motif in virology is that viruses tend to re\u2010purpose molecular mechanisms that were originally taken from host cells. The finding that viruses use PRF to make C\u2010terminally extended fusion proteins differs from most of their cellular counterparts, which appear to use \u22121 PRF to regulate gene expression through mRNA stability. Indeed, this observation may help to explain why global changes in \u22121 PRF efficiency are detrimental to cell viability, and may even help to elucidate one of the underlying causes of human ribosomopathies. This would also explain why \u22121 PRF should be regulated by sequence\u2010specific mechanisms, e.g., by ncRNAs as proposed here. Corollary to this may be the explanation for why viruses that utilize \u22121 PRF are able to successfully replicate in their host cells because permissive cells would presumably not express ncRNAs capable of interacting with the viral \u22121 PRF signals. It is our hope that these observations and suggestions will spur new investigators to enter this new and expanding field.",
