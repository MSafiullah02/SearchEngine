This can only be used for a short term until the patient is transferred to an airborne infection isolate and depends on the type of infectious agent.Isolate for airborne infections should have a sluice (anteroom), patient room and bathroom with toilet/washstand/shower and a throughput decontaminator/autoclave.Ventilation and pressure.

Outgoing used air is extracted ca. 15 cm from the floor (diagonal) or via openings in the lower part of the door to the bathroom/disinfection room. Outgoing, used air is extracted ca 15 cm from the floor (diagonal) or via openings in the lower part of the door to the bathroom/disinfection room. From the bathroom/disinfection room, the used air goes via a full decontamination with UVC, through varying filter types, including hepafilters, before entering separate exhaust channels over the roof\u2014far away from incoming air pipes.Interlock of doors so that only one open at a time. One of the doors in the sluice must always be closed.The sluice must be large enough that a bed can stand there with both doors closed. It must be spacious enough for dressing and undressing of PPE without self-contamination or contamination of the equipment in the sluice. The room must have a sink for handwashing. Throughput cupboards between bathroom and sluice can create ventilation problems and should be completely sealed, and the cabinet doors must be interlocked. Throughput decontaminator or autoclave from the bath to the sluice is an advantage for the disinfection of infection-prone equipment.The patient room must be large so that visitors do not come too close to the bed\u2014about 2 m distance from the bed on the sides and, at the foot end, at least 20 m2. During intensive treatment (respirator, dialysis, monitoring, etc.) and presence of two intensive nurses, there is a need for at least 35 m2 space per patient. The room should have a sink for handwashing and a robust inventory that withstand disinfection with chemicals.Decontamination room and bathroom have entrance directly from the patient room, with door that turns into the patient room. The room contains a toilet, shower, throughput decontaminator or autoclave and cabinets for necessary equipment to the patient.Direct access from outside. It is an advantage of direct access to the outside of the building via a separate sluice for direct patient in and out.\n",

            "text": "Termination of isolation: [11, 12]After completion of the isolation period, all disposable equipment (including unused) like creams, soaps, bandages, etc. which have remained in the room during isolation is treated as infectious waste. All textiles in the room are treated as infectious and sent for laundry.Beddings are carefully packaged (to avoid re-aerosols) and sent as infectious textiles.Bed equipment and mattresses which cannot be washed or disinfected in the room are packed, labelled, and sent to disinfection.Rooms, fixtures, bed, bathroom and all reusable equipment are disinfected with peracetic acid, chloramine 5% and household bleach or by other means.All handles, buttons, switches, call cord, waterproof mattresses, bed, nightstand, toilet, computer, telephone, TV and other contaminated fixtures and equipment are disinfected.Floors, walls (1.80 m up), lighting fixtures in the ceiling and other equipment should be disinfected. It is important to have good cleaning on all surfaces to avoid deposits of dust-bearing microbes.The responsible nurse, biochemist or radiographer must inform the cleaning staff about the disinfection area and the disinfectant to be used. After the disinfection, the room and all equipment are washed with soap and water.The room is aired 1 h after cleaning.Hydrogen peroxide 5% dry gas may be appropriate in addition to regular disinfection, especially in rooms with a lot of medical equipment and if problems with regular disinfection. Follow written procedures. Three subsequent disinfection cycles must be performed under control of effect on spore test. It does not work against tubercle bacilli but is otherwise approved against bacteria, viruses and fungi.",
