            "text": "The small single-stranded DNA virus, porcine circovirus (PCV), has recently been recognised as a pathogen of swine. Two types of PCV have been characterised and designated PCV type 1 (PCV1) and PCV type 2 (PCV2), respectively (Allan and Ellis, 2000 and references therein). PCV1 is considered to be a non-pathogenic virus (Tischer et al., 1986, Allan et al., 1995), whereas infection of swine with PCV2 is causally associated with development of postweaning multisystemic wasting syndrome (PMWS) in weaned 5- to 12-week-old piglets (Allan et al., 1998, Ellis et al., 1998). PMWS is characterised by weight loss, dyspnoea, and jaundice combined with the pathological findings of interstitial pneumonia, generalised enlarged lymph nodes, hepatitis, and nephritis (Allan et al., 1998, Ellis et al., 1999). Typical histological lesions include degeneration and necrosis of hepatocytes, multifocal lymphohistiocytic pneumonia, and lymphocytic depletion and multinucleated giant cell formation in lymph nodes (Clark, 1997, Ellis et al., 1998). PCV2 antigen is typically localised within the multisystemic lesions in affected piglets (Clark, 1997). PMWS was first identified within high health herds in western Canada in 1991 (Clark, 1997) but has since been reported in swine throughout the world (Allan et al., 1998, Ellis et al., 1999, Onuki et al., 1999, Choi et al., 2000). Interestingly, serological surveys have shown that PCV2 was present in swine before PMWS was first reported (Magar et al., 2000b, Walker et al., 2000). Furthermore, serologic studies have revealed that many herds are seropositive to PCV2 without clinical signs of PMWS (Labarque et al., 2000, Rodriguez-Arrioja et al., 2000).",

            "text": "A number of experimental studies have indicated that infection with PCV2 alone is not sufficient to induce clinical PMWS. As such, several inoculation studies using PCV2 alone have resulted in asymptomatic infection with mild to moderate histopathologic lesions (Allan et al., 1999, Balasch et al., 1999, Magar et al., 2000a, Pogranichyy et al., 2000). In contrast, dual infection with PCV2 and porcine parvovirus (PPV) or porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) potentiates the replication and distribution of PCV2 and induces clinical disease in addition to more severe histopathological lesions (Allan et al., 2000, Kennedy et al., 2000, Krakowka et al., 2000, Harms et al., 2001). These results are in concordance with the observation of PCV2 and PPV coinfection in field cases of PMWS (Ellis et al., 2000) and suggest that the presence of another pathogen may augment the pathogenic effects of PCV2. Similarly, gnotobiotic piglets inoculated with PCV2 alone remained clinically asymptomatic (Krakowka et al., 2000) while gnotobiotic piglets inoculated with tissue homogenates from PMWS-affected piglets containing both PCV2 and PPV developed lesions typical of PMWS with severe clinical disease (Ellis et al., 1999, Krakowka et al., 2000). Recently, it has been demonstrated by Krakowka et al. (2001) that activation of the immune system is a key component of the pathogenesis of PCV2-associated PMWS in gnotobiotic pigs. In that study, immune activation was achieved by injection of keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH) in incomplete Freund\u2019s adjuvant (ICFA) into gnotobiotic piglets infected with PCV2 at 1 day of age. By incorporation of bromo-desoxiuridine (BrDU), upregulation of virus production was roughly correlated to increased numbers of replicating cells. In concordance, increased amounts of infectious virus was recovered from draining lymph nodes by quantitative viral titrations. In that study, all immunised piglets developed PMWS whereas none of the non-immunised piglets inoculated with PCV2 alone developed PMWS and extensive viral replication of PCV2 was observed in PMWS-affected piglets, only (Krakowka et al., 2001). These observations also suggest why all pigs infected with PCV2 do not develop PMWS during an outbreak or an experimental infection since differences in immunological status of pigs are bound to exist both between and within herds or experimental groups. The gnotobiotic model for experimental infections cannot be directly compared to field conditions because of the immature immunological status of gnotobiotes and the obvious differences in husbandry conditions. Furthermore, under field conditions, PMWS is a problem in 5- to 12-week-old piglets indicating that the piglets are infected with PCV2 after weaning. Therefore, the objective of the present study was to investigate the significance of immunostimulation on the development of PMWS in 3-week-old SPF piglets infected with PCV2 immediately after weaning.",

An immunoperoxidase monolayer assay (IPMA) was carried out for the detection of antibodies against PCV1 and PCV2. In brief, monolayers of PCV-infected PK-15 cell cultures were fixed with ethyl alcohol in flat-bottomed 96-well microtiter plates. For PCV1, persistently infected PK-15 cells (ATCC CCL-33, USA) were used and for PCV2, PCV-free PK-15 cells infected with the French PCV2 isolate 48285 (Allan et al., 1998) were used. Plates with fixed PCV-infected cells were stored at \u221220 \u00b0C after addition of 50% glycerol in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and washed four times in PBS containing 0.1% Tween-20 (PBST) before use. Plates were inoculated with 50 \u03bcl of five-fold dilutions at 1:50 to 1:156250 of the serum samples diluted in PBST supplemented with 5% skimmed milk powder (PBST\u20135% SMP) and incubated for 30 min at 37 \u00b0C. After adsorption, the plates were washed four times in PBST before addition of 50 \u03bcl peroxidase conjugated rabbit anti-swine IgG (DAKO P0164, Denmark) diluted 1:200 in PBST\u20135% SMP followed by incubation for 30 min at 37 \u00b0C. After the final washing in PBST, ethyl-carbazole substrate was added and the plates were left for 25 min at room temperature. Specific staining of cells indicated the presence of antibodies specific to PCV in the serum sample. The titer of a serum sample was determined as the highest dilution containing a detectable level of antibodies. Due to cross reactivity between antibodies against PCV1 and PCV2, the interpretation of the results included a comparison of the titers to PCV1 and PCV2. If the titer was highest to PCV2, the result indicated an infection with PCV2.",

Total DNA was extracted from either serum or tissue using the QIAamp\u00ae DNA minikit extraction procedure according to the manufacturers instructions (QIAGEN\u00ae GmbH, Germany), and the concentration of double-stranded DNA determined by fluorometric measurements using Picogreen (Singer et al., 1997). For serum samples, the equivalent of 0.8 \u03bcl serum was used as template for the PCR. For tissue, the equivalent of 100 ng of double-stranded DNA was used as template in the PCR. Briefly, a forward primer (5\u2032-GATGATCTACTGAGACTGTGTGA) and a reverse primer (5\u2032-6-FAM-AGAGCTTCTACAGCTGGGACA) conserved between PCV1 and PCV2 was used for the PCR together with two probes specific for PCV1 (5\u2032-GCCCCCCAGGAATGGTACTCCTCXTp-3\u2032, where \u2018X\u2019 is Texas Red) and PCV2 (5\u2032-TCAGACCCCGTTGGAATGGTACTCCTC-Cy5-3\u2032). The PCR contained a final concentration of 1\u00d7 PCR gold buffer (Applied Biosystem, Denmark), 2.8 mM MgCl2, 0.1 mM dNTP, 0.25 \u03bcM of each primer, 0.5 \u03bcM of each probe, 0.25 U of AMP Erase (Applied Biosystems, Denmark), and 1.25 U of Ampli Taq gold DNA-polymerase (Applied Biosystems, Denmark). All reactions were carried out in triplicates on an ABI 7700 (ABI PRISM\u2122 7700 Sequence Detector, Applied Biosystem, Denmark). The cycling conditions were one cycle of (50 \u00b0C for 2 min and 95 \u00b0C for 5 min) and 55 cycles of (95 \u00b0C for 10 s, 60 \u00b0C for 15 s and 75 \u00b0C for 15 s) followed by a melting curve analysis added for specificity. Fluorescence data collection was performed at each annealing step of the PCR with the increase in Cy5-fluorescence being proportional to the amount of PCV2 DNA in the sample. For each separate set of PCR reactions, two internal positive controls containing different but known amounts of PCV2 viral DNA template were included. This allowed normalisation for variations in amplification efficiency between different sets of PCR reactions. Results are presented as mean values of the triplicate reactions.",

A period with persistent fever was observed for each of the four PMWS-affected pigs prior to development of clinical disease. The remaining PCV2-infected pigs experienced transient fever, yet, none of these pigs displayed overt clinical signs of infection. Quantification of PCV2 DNA by PCR demonstrated that the four PMWS-affected pigs contained extremely high levels of PCV2 DNA in serum. These data suggest a direct association between an increased load of viral DNA and clinical PMWS in a PCV2-infected pig. The highest amount of viral DNA detected in serum was observed at PID 10 for two individual pigs. Interestingly, one of these pigs developed PMWS and died whereas the level of PCV2 DNA detected in serum from the other pig rapidly declined and this pig survived until termination of the experiment.

Furthermore, a dramatic reduction in the number of B lymphocytes observed in PCV2-infected pigs with wasting disease syndrome has been reported (Shibahara et al., 2000, Segales et al., 2001) that may also explain the low level of PCV2-specific antibodies in the PMWS-affected piglets.

These results were comparable with immunohistochemical staining of tissues. The results of virus isolation were in accordance with the results for immunofluorescence staining and PCV2 was isolated from tissue homogenates from all PCV2-infected piglets. A marked difference between diseased and non-diseased pigs was observed with large amount of infectious PCV2 demonstrated in tissue homogenates from PMWS-affected pigs. A similar pattern of PCV2 distribution was obtained by Q-PCR analysis of tissues. Five weeks after infection low PCV2 template copy numbers were detected, whereas high numbers were detected in various tissues from the diseased pigs at PIDs 21, 22, and 25. Thus, in the four PCV2-infected pigs that developed PMWS extensive viral replication led to high amounts of PCV2 antigen widely distributed in various tissues. However, since the diseased pigs died or were euthanized 10\u201314 days before termination of the experiment, there was no data concerning the amount and distribution pattern of PCV2 antigen at this point in tissues from pigs that did not develop clinical disease.

In fact, three out of five non-immunostimulated pigs compared to one out of five immunostimulated pigs developed severe clinical signs. There were no significant gross pathological differences between non-immunostimulated and immunostimulated PCV2-infected pigs although histologic lesions were generally more severe in the non-immunostimulated pigs. Five weeks after infection, PCV2 was isolated from all tissue pools from all PCV2-infected pigs with similar titers. Furthermore, there were no indications of any immunostimulatory effect upon the distribution of PCV2 antigen detected by immunofluorescence or Q-PCR within tissue samples originating from non-immunostimulated pigs compared to immunostimulated pigs. From PIDs 7 to 10, there was a tendency for increasing PCV2 template copy numbers detected by Q-PCR in serum from immunostimulated pigs compared to non-immunostimulated pigs but this difference was not statistically significant. Three to 5 weeks after infection, the levels of PCV2 template copy number in serum were also slightly increased in the immunostimulated pigs compared to the non-immunostimulated pigs. Again, there were no statistically significant differences in the load of viral DNA between the two experimental groups. All pigs infected with PCV2 seroconverted between PIDs 10 and 14, and by PID 28, all immunostimulated pigs had higher antibody titers than the non-immunostimulated pigs. None of the non-immunostimulated reached this level of antibodies within the experimental period.

In that respect, however, the current study support the very recent findings by Bolin et al. (2001) and Harms et al. (2001) that infection of caesarean-derived colostrum-deprived (CD/CD) pigs with PCV2 alone may result in development of clinical PMWS. This apparent inconsistency between different studies on the requirement for co-infection or co-factors in inducing clinical PMWS parallel in many ways the situation from the field. Antibodies against PCV are widespread within swine herds in both Europe and North America (Dulac and Afshar, 1989, Hines and Lukert, 1995, Tischer et al., 1995, Labarque et al., 2000, Rodriguez-Arrioja et al., 2000). It seems reasonable to believe that PCV infection is ubiquitous throughout the world. Infection of a herd with PCV2, however, often results in subclinical infection only (Labarque et al., 2000, Rodriguez-Arrioja et al., 2000). It is therefore critical to identify co-factors that have an influence upon the development of PMWS-related problems. Differences in immunological status among herds and age of pigs at the time of PCV2 infection might still be part of the answer. Immunological differences are probably more pronounced in the field than under experimental conditions due to larger variability of management conditions and presence of other infectious agents. For example, such differences may explain why countries such as Denmark, despite having a high PCV2 seroprevalence, have not yet experienced severe outbreaks of PMWS as reported from other countries (Segales et al., 1997, Allan et al., 1998, Ellis et al., 1999, Ladekj\u00e6r-Mikkelsen et al., 2001). As well, there could be as yet unrecognised differences in virulence among PCV2 isolates that are circulating in various pig populations. Introduction of more pathogenic PCV2 strains could then potentially dramatically increase the rate of PMWS-related problems in countries that as yet have not reported PCV2-associated disease. Another important unexplored co-factor could be genetic variability in pig populations. Some pigs may simply be more susceptible to infection with PCV2 and or may be more permissive for viral replication, and, therefore, may be more at the risk of developing PMWS.",
