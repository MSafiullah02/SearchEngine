Newgard, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, North Carolina) were maintained as described (15) in a medium containing fetal bovine serum from Life Technologies (catalog number 16000\u2013044. The rat origin has been previously confirmed (16). Male db/db (BKS.Cg-Dock7<m>+/+Lepr<db>/J) mice homozygous for Lepr<db> on a C57BLKS/J background and age-matched male db/m mice heterozygous for Lepr<db> were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory. One week before the animals were killed, body weight and fasting blood glucose was measured, after an overnight fasting, with a TRUEtrack blood glucose monitoring system (Nipro Diagnostics). Animals were killed at ages of 8 weeks (56 and 57 d), 12 weeks (84 and 85 d), and 15 weeks (107 and 108 d). Plasma from whole blood was collected and stored at \u221280\u00b0C until analysis. Plasma glucose was determined with a glucose assay kit (GAGO20\u20131kt from Sigma-Aldrich). Pancreatic islets were isolated from individual mice (17). The whole islet population picked from each mouse was used for either RNA isolation or ACE2 protein assays. Mice of strain B6.Cg-Gt(ROSA)26Sortm14(CAG-tdTomato)Hze/J, with the coding sequence for a red fluorescing protein, tdTomato, downstream from a loxP-flanked transcriptional STOP cassette inserted in the Rosa26 locus, and transgenic mice with Cre recombinase under the control of the rat insulin 2 promoter (strain B6.Cg-Tg[Ins2-cre]25Mgn/J) were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory. We term these genes Tom and Ins2-Cre in this paper. These transgenic mice were bred to generate double and single heterozygotes. Pancreatic islets were isolated from these animals as well as from wild-type C57BL/6J mice. Animal procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center-New Orleans.",

Because the endogenous levels of ACE2 protein are very low in 832/13 cells (16), we transiently transfected cells with mACE2 and hACE2 expression plasmids. In the original description of ADAM17-mediated ACE2 shedding (9), the small size difference between intact and shed ACE2 makes it difficult to clearly distinguish between these two forms. To unambiguously detect whether shedding occurs in 832/13 cells, we also transfected cells with a plasmid for expression of a larger fusion protein with GFP attached to the C terminal of hACE2. The shed form of the hACE2-GFP fusion protein should have the same size as shed hACE2. A comparison of Figure 1, A and B, reveals that an approximately 102-kDa shed ACE2 form from both hACE2 and the hACE2-GFP fusion protein is present in the cell culture medium after a 24-hour incubation. A less intense band of the larger hACE2-GFP fusion protein represents ACE2 protein presumably released by other sources than shedding, which might include membrane debris from dead cells or small extracellular membrane particles that were not removed by centrifugation. An approximately 94-kDa shed form of mACE2 is also apparent and distinguished from the 102-kDa full-length mACE2. Increasing concentrations of the ADAM17 expression plasmid led to significantly increased concentrations of ADAM17 proteins with sizes of approximately 103 kDa and 88 kDa (Figure 1, C and F). The 103- and 88-kDa forms possibly correspond to pro-ADAM17 and mature ADAM17 (22). However, it is also possible that both are active forms with different glycosylation patterns. For the highest concentration of pAd17 expression (2 \u03bcg/well), there were significantly increased concentrations of shed ACE2 (Figure 1, B and E). No consistent effects of overexpression of ADAM17 on the three types of cellular ACE2 were observed (Figure 1D).",

After a 24-hour incubation, cell culture medium from cells transfected with ACE2 expression plasmids had hydrolytic activity against Mca-APK(Dnp) that could be inhibited greater than 90% by the ACE2-specific inhibitor DX600, demonstrating that the hydrolytic activity is due to ACE2 (Figure 2A). Surprisingly, the maintenance medium for the 832/13 cells also had ACE2 activity, which comes from the fetal bovine serum. This medium activity is not affected by incubation at 37\u00b0C or by incubation with untransfected 832/13 cells (Figure 2B). Thus, the difference in hydrolytic activity between the medium from transfected cells and from the maintenance medium represent the ACE2 activity released from the cells during the incubation period. The shed ACE2 activity was significantly increased at the highest level of the ADAM17 expression plasmid (Figure 2C).",

Because the expression plasmids all include the CMV promoter, there is the potential for competition for transcription factors in cotransfection experiments (squelching). Transfections with 2 \u03bcg pcDNA3.1(\u2212) furthermore contain 1.45-fold more plasmid molecules than transfections with 2 \u03bcg pAd17 due to the size difference between the two plasmids (5427 and \u223c7863 bp, respectively). We therefore speculated that the pAd17 and pcDNA3.1(\u2212) plasmids had different squelching effects on ACE2 expression. A new control plasmid, pAd17E406A, encoding the catalytically inactive E406A mutant of ADAM17 (24), was generated and compared with the other plasmids in cotransfections with the mouse expression plasmid mACE2/pcDNA3.1. Cells transfected with pAd17 and pAd17E406A did not differ significantly in the expression levels of ADAM17 mRNA that were much higher (>100-fold) than the expression level in cells transfected with pcDNA3.1(\u2212) (Figure 3A). The levels of ACE2 mRNA were also similar for pAd17 and pAd17E406A but were approximately twice as high as in the cells transfected with pcDNA3.1(\u2212) (Figure 3A). This confirms that pcDNA3.1(\u2212) differs from the ADAM17 plasmids in their effect on ACE2 expression in our experimental set-up.",

Because neither the substrate nor the inhibitor in the SensoLyte kit is completely specific for ADAM17, we designed an alternative assay with DPC-333, which is highly specific for ADAM17 (20).

For the three highest levels of mACE2/pcDNA3.1, the cellular ACE2 level was significantly lower for pAd17 than for pAd17E406A, which is attributed to increased shedding.

For example, how much does a relative change in ADAM17 activity affect relative changes in ACE2 levels? For this purpose, wells with 832/13 cells were transfected with 25 ng mACE2/pcDNA3.1 and 2 \u03bcg of a mix of expression plasmids for active and inactive ADAM17 in different ratios. ADAM17 activity for the whole-cell population increases linearly with the amount of pAd17 for active ADAM17 used in the transfections (Figure 5A), whereas shed and cellular ACE2 activities increase and decrease, respectively, before approaching a plateau (Figure 5B). The ADAM17 activity for the cells that become transfected with the ADAM17 expression plasmids is calculated as the measured activity for pAD17E406A alone plus the measured activity for the ADAM17 mix divided by the transfection efficiency. The transfection efficiency is estimated from 832/13 cells transfected with 25 ng mACE2/pcDNA3.1 and 2 \u03bcg of a plasmid for enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) expression from the CMV promoter. The fraction of cells with green fluorescence was measured by flow cytometry (Figure 5C, upper right panel), giving an average transfection rate of 46.8% from five experiments. The fraction of cells transfected with mACE2/pcDNA3.1 that was cotransfected with the ADAM17 expression plasmids was estimated by transfection of cells with 0.5 \u03bcg pACE2-Tom and cotransfection with 2 \u03bcg of either pAd17 or 2 \u03bcg pEGFP-C3 per well. The population of purely red fluorescent cells seen in the lower left panel of Figure 5C is more than 99% shifted to cells coexpressing red and green fluorescence when pEGFP-C3 is cotransfected (Figure 5C, lower right panel). With 25 ng pACE2-Tom per well in cotransfections, the level of red fluorescence was lower, but cotransfection efficiency was still greater than 99% (data not shown).

Analogous to Michaelis-Menten kinetics, we fitted curves ACE2 = A0 \u00b1 Amax * ADAM17/(ADAM17 + K0.5), where A0 is the ACE2 activity for ADAM17 activity = 0, Amax is the maximal change from A0 at saturating levels of ADAM17, and K0.5 is the ADAM17 activity for reaching an ACE2 level of (A0 \u00b1 Amax)/2. As shown in Figure 5, D and E, these models can be fitted well to the data. The control strengths of ADAM17 on shed and cellular ACE2 are then calculated from these model fits as follows: (d(ACE2)/d(ADAM17)) * (ADAM17/ACE2) = \u00b1ADAM17 * Amax * K0.5 * (ADAM17 + K0.5)\u22121 * (A0 * (ADAM17 + K0.5) \u00b1Amax * ADAM17)\u22121. The control strengths are illustrated in Figure 5F. For both shed and cellular ACE2, the control strengths have absolute values smaller than 0.25. The control strength for shed ACE2 is low due to ACE2 activity released into the medium, even when the ADAM17 activity is 0, suggesting that other enzymes or mechanisms contribute to ACE2 activity appearing in the medium. It should also be noticed that the control strength of ADAM17 for cellular ACE2 approaches 0 for very low ADAM17 activities. We conclude that in these conditions, only large relative changes in ADAM17 activity will markedly affect cellular ACE2 levels.",

This contrasts with the regulation in liver, skeletal muscle, and adipose tissue, in which the db/db mice show a different expression of ACE2 mRNA relative to db/m mice.

For cellular ACE2, the control strengths were in the interval (\u22120.25; 0). Accordingly, only relatively large increases in ADAM17 activity would result in marked decreases in ACE2 levels. For example, a 2-fold increase in ADAM17 would at most cause a 16% decrease in ACE2. In striking contrast, the high control strength of the synthesis rate suggests that a 2-fold increase in the ACE2 synthesis rate will increase the cellular ACE2 levels by at least 89%. The control strength of ADAM17 on shed ACE2 was also quite small in the interval (0; +0.25), primarily due to a high background of shedding caused by enzymes that are apparently not ADAM17. If the background is subtracted to show ACE2 shed specifically by ADAM17, the control strength would be close to +1.0 at low ADAM17 activity levels and decrease to 0 as saturation occurs. The apparent K0.5 value for shed ACE2 seems lower than for cellular ACE2. The cause for this is currently unknown. Interestingly, there are ADAM17 activity levels as observed with 0.4 \u03bcg/well pAd17 in Figure 5B in which the shed ACE2 is increased 92%, but cellular ACE2 is decreased by only 16%. This is reminiscent of results obtained with Huh-7 cells in which the calmodulin inhibitors led to a significant 50% increase in shed ACE2 activity but no significant decrease in cellular ACE2 activity (27). We calculated the control strengths for ADAM17 activity levels that were corrected for the transfection efficiency. The ACE2 activities were not similarly corrected. But because a correction for the transfection efficiency would change the ACE2 activities by only a constant, the control strengths that are based on relative changes would be unaltered. The actual values of the control strengths of ADAM17 on ACE2 expression in other tissues and cell types may differ from those found with 832/13 cells due to, for example, cell type-specific competition between ADAM17 and other proteins for access to ACE2 or cell type-specific processes that promote or hinder the physical proximity between ADAM17 and ACE2.",

The effect of ADAM17 might be underestimated because ADAM17 is degraded faster than ACE2 after inhibition of protein synthesis. However, shedding by ADAM17 and other proteases is not the only mechanism degrading ACE2. We recently reported that internalization and lysosomal degradation decrease ACE2 levels in response to Ang-II and demonstrated that ACE2 was ubiquitinated (28). Inhibition of the proteasome pathway by MG132 has further been shown to increase ACE2 protein levels (29). Because less than 5% of pancreatic islet ACE2 was released to the extracellular compartment within 24 hours (Figure 8D), we speculate that these pathways, rather than shedding, are involved in the normal turnover of ACE2 protein in islets. It is not known whether this profile would be affected in any pathological conditions in which endogenous ADAM17 would be overexpressed.",

However, the ACE2 mRNA and ACE2 activity levels were markedly lower in a \u03b2-cell-enriched population relative to the alternate cell population. Islet ACE2 therefore seems expressed mainly in non-\u03b2-cells of pancreatic islets. This can explain our previous observation of much higher ACE2 expression in the total population of islet cells compared with insulinoma cell lines (19). It will be of interest in future studies to identify the islet cell type expressing high levels of ACE2 and assess the biological role that ACE2 might play in that cell type. RNA sequencing analysis of human islets indicated even lower levels of ACE2 mRNA in \u03b1-cell-enriched populations than in \u03b2-cell-enriched populations (30). Islet ACE2 expression may occur mainly in somatostatin-secreting cells, as reported using immunohistochemistry of rat islets (31).

There were no significant differences between genotypes or over time for ACE2 mRNA, ACE2 activity, ADAM17 mRNA, and ADAM17 activity. The ADAM17 activity was at the limit of detection so there might have been small changes in activity that went undetected. Still, we demonstrated that basal ADAM17 activity in islets is simply too low to affect ACE2 levels. A similar lack of change in expression in ACE2 mRNA and activity was observed in high-fat diet-fed, hyperglycemic mice compared with regular diet-fed mice (data not shown), underscoring the remarkable robustness of islet ACE2 expression in the face of diabetic phenotypes. However, with the depletion of total islet mass as diabetes progresses, it is likely that loss of islets and their associated ACE2 contribute to an overall decrease of ACE2 levels in the whole pancreas.",

A technical advantage of our new measurements is that they do not depend on antibody specificity.

We determined the cellular ACE2 activity (C) and calculated the ratio of total shed ACE2 activity to total cellular ACE2 (D). There were no significant differences for post hoc contrasts of means in the absence and presence of DPC-333 after an ANOVA, but the main effect for sex was significant at P < .001 for cellular ACE2 activity.",
