            "text": "Plant viruses known to employ minus one (\u22121) programmed ribosomal frameshifting include one genus (Dianthovirus) in the Tombusviridae family, all three genera (Luteovirus, Polerovirus, and Enamovirus) of the Luteoviridae, and the Umbravirus and Sobemovirus genera. The latter two genera bear some resemblance in genome organization and sequence to the Luteovirus and Polerovirus genera, respectively, but have not been assigned to a family (Hull and Fargette, 2005; Miller et al., 2002; Taliansky et al., 2005). It is likely that translation of the genome of an entirely unrelated genus, Closterovirus, undergoes a net +1 reading frame change to translate the viral RdRp coding region (Karasev et al., 1995). This would be the first known +1 frameshift in any plant viral RNA. A carlavirus may use \u22121 frameshifting by a novel \u201cP-site only\u201d mechanism (Gramstat et al., 1994). Recently a new ORF was discovered in the large Potyviridae family of plant viruses (Chung et al., 2008). The new ORF, called pipo, overlaps with the major ORF which encodes a large polyproteins. One likely mechanism for expression of the pipo ORF is \u22121 ribosomal frameshifting.",

Programmed ribosomal frameshifting allows the virus to control levels of synthesis of two proteins using one sequence that codes for a portion of both proteins. The result of the frameshift is two proteins that have the same amino terminal sequence up to the frameshift site, at which point the amino acid sequences diverge, with a small portion of the proteins having the \u22121 frame (frameshifted) sequence, while the majority of the proteins result from conventional unshifted translation of the initial frame (called the zero frame). Thus, only a small percentage of ribosomes change reading frames in plant viral frameshifting. In many viruses, such as those in the Luteovirus, Dianthovirus, and Umbravirus genera, the frameshift occurs immediately upstream of the zero frame stop codon, so the translated proteins consist of a short and long (C-terminally extended) version of the same protein (Fig. 9.1). In contrast, in the polero- and enamoviruses, significant translation continues in the zero frame beyond the frameshift site (Fig. 9.2). In all plant viruses, with the possible exception of the Potyviridae and carlaviruses, the protein translated via ribosomal frameshifting is the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp).\n\n",

            "text": "The high ratio of a viral protein to a C-terminally extended version of the protein can also be achieved by in-frame readthrough of a stop codon (codon redefinition). In fact, different viruses in the same family (Tombusviridae) use either readthrough or frameshifting to express the RdRp (Lommel et al., 2005). The portion of the RdRp upstream of the leaky (recoded) stop codon in Tomato bushy stunt virus (TBSV, a tobamovirus), called p33, equivalent to the pre-shift portion of the RdRp in frameshifting viruses specifically binds viral RNA (Pogany et al., 2005). The full-length readthrough product (p92pol) includes the p33 and downstream RdRp domains (Panavas et al., 2005). p33 then localizes the viral RNA and p92pol to membrane-bound vesicles derived from the peroxisomal membrane (McCartney et al., 2005). By analogy with Brome mosaic virus (Schwartz et al., 2002), these may serve as replication factories with many more copies of p33 than p92pol. Thus infrequent in-frame readthrough of the stop codon is necessary to ensure a high ratio of p33 to RdRp in TBSV-infected cells. Based on sequence homologies (Koonin and Dolja, 1993) and the observation that the homologous protein (p27) of dianthovirus red clover necrotic mosaic virus (RCNMV) also localizes to membranes (Turner et al., 2004), it is highly likely that the pre-shift ORF of viruses in the Dianthovirus,\nLuteovirus, and Umbravirus genera play a role similar to that of p33. In these viruses, infrequent frameshifting, rather than readthrough, ensures a low level of RdRp expression. In addition to playing a role in RNA replication, the pre-shift part of ORF 2 of poleroviruses, enamovirus, and sobemoviruses also encodes the viral protease which is needed early in infection and the 5\u2032 genome-linked protein (VPg) (van der Wilk et al., 1997) which is absent in the Tombusviridae and in genus Luteovirus.",

            "text": "Ribosomal frameshifting is programmed entirely by the mRNA. For a region of mRNA to promote programmed \u22121 frameshifting, two sequence elements are required at a minimum. These include a shifty heptanucleotide at which the ribosome pauses and shifts reading frame (below), followed six to eight bases downstream by a highly structured region, such as a pseudoknot, a stable stem-loop, or other structure that greatly stimulates the process (see Chapters 10.1007/978-0-387-89382-2_7 and 10.1007/978-0-387-89382-2_8). It is currently unknown exactly how a downstream structure, e.g., a pseudoknot, stimulates \u22121 frameshifting. However, several proposals have been made that attempt to identify the exact step in a translocation cycle where frameshifting occurs on the ribosome (Harger et al., 2002; Jacks et al., 1988; Leger et al., 2007; Plant et al., 2003) (for a review, see Giedroc and Cornish (2009)). For a pseudoknot, what is clear is that the relatively short spacer between the slip-site and the pseudoknot places the pseudoknot in direct contact with the mRNA entry channel of the translocating ribosome (Namy et al., 2006). In bacteria and probably also in eukaryotes, the mRNA channel is contained totally within the small (30S in bacteria) ribosomal subunit, between the head and body, lined with ribosomal proteins S3, S4, and S5 (Brodersen et al., 2002). Biochemical experiments reveal that the 70S ribosome has helicase activity (Takyar et al., 2005), which may function by passively trapping transiently unfolded secondary structure by dsRNA-binding protein S5; alternatively, the S3/S4/S5 proteins might function as a processivity clamp positioned at the entrance to the mRNA tunnel (Takyar et al., 2005).",

The sequence of the heptanucleotide slip-site in a \u22121 frameshift signal is such that during re-pairing of the P- and A-site tRNAs in the new \u22121 reading frame, only the wobble codon\u2013anticodon interaction is changed (\u201c0\u201d frame: X XXY\nYYZ to \u201c\u22121\u201d frame: XXX\nYYY Z) (Brierley et al., 1992). As a result, the new \u22121 reading frame provides near cognate re-pairing partners for the bound tRNAs. This suggests that the total free energy of codon\u2013anticodon formation of the \u22121 frame will be comparable to that of the reference frame (frame 0). Since frameshifting does in fact occur over such a sequence, but happens infrequently, a sizable transition state energy barrier to shifting reading frames must be present, for which there is now structural insight (Selmer et al., 2006). A downstream secondary structural element could therefore function by lowering this energy barrier, either by playing an active (mechanical) or passive role in this process.",

In either case, movement of the ribosomal subunits may cause tension to build up in the mRNA strand due to the downstream structural element positioned in the mRNA entry channel. This tension could then be released via \u22121 frameshifting (Plant et al., 2003).",

As expected (Yusupova et al., 2001), the pseudoknot lies at the entrance to the mRNA channel apparently making direct contact with elements of the putative ribosomal helicase, including rpos3 (bacterial S3), 16S helix 16, rpS9 (S4), and rpS2 (S5), as well as the ribosome-regulatory protein RACK1. Furthermore, the clearly defined electron density observed for the pseudoknot strongly suggests that the pseudoknot is largely folded as the ribosome shifts reading frames. This structure is fully compatible with the idea that the ability of the downstream pseudoknot to actively lower the energy barrier for unpairing of the P-site codon\u2013anticodon interaction will be more strongly correlated with frameshift stimulation. By extension, RNA motifs more capable of resisting the force of ribosomal helicase-mediated unwinding and eEF2(EF-G)-catalyzed translocation will thus be more efficient frameshift stimulators (Larsen et al., 1997).",

Other as-yet unidentified structures may facilitate frameshifting in other plant viruses such as the Potyviridae (see below).

The genomes of all Luteoviridae are 5.6\u20135.8 kb long and typically have six open reading frames (ORFs) which are divided into two clusters separated by a noncoding intergenic region (Figs. 9.1 and 9.2). ORFs 1 and 2 encode proteins P1 and P2 which form part of the viral replicase. In poleroviruses and enamovirus, P1 is a polyprotein precursor containing a putative helicase, a chymotrypsin-like (3C-like) proteinase, and VPg peptides (van der Wilk et al., 1997), while the exact biochemical function of P1 of genus Luteovirus P1 is ill-defined, as viruses in this genus have neither a VPg nor any known proteinase. In all Luteoviridae, P1 plays an essential role in RNA replication and P2 contains the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase active site (RdRp) (D\u2019Arcy and Domier, 2005). The RdRp is translated as the C-terminal part of a P1\u2013P2 fusion protein via \u22121 ribosomal frameshifting (Brault and Miller, 1992; Di et al., 1993; Garcia et al., 1993; Kujawa et al., 1993; Pr\u00fcfer et al., 1992).",

Viruses in genus Luteovirus are known or predicted to have a GGGUUUU shifty site. The structured region (Fig. 9.1A) that begins six to eight bases downstream of the shifty heptanucleotide consists of a large adjacent downstream-bulged stem-loop (ADSL) that forms a complex pseudoknot by base pairing of a bulge loop in the ADSL to a stem-loop in the long-distance frameshift element (LDFE) located four kilobases downstream in the 3\u2032 UTR (Barry and Miller, 2002). In contrast, viruses in the other two genera of the Luteoviridae harbor a small, compact, highly structured pseudoknot adjacent to, and downstream of, the shifty site (see below). These striking differences between Luteovirus and Polerovirus/Enamovirus frameshift signals correlate with highly divergent sequences of the RdRp (ORF 2) and upstream (ORF 1) coding regions (D\u2019Arcy and Domier, 2005). In fact, the RdRp of genus Luteovirus is more closely related to those of the Tombusviridae and Umbraviruses than to the other genera of the Luteoviridae (Miller, Liu and Beckett, 2002). In particular it is most closely related to the RdRps of viruses in the Dianthovirus genus (Tombusviridae) which, unlike other Tombusvirids, employ \u22121 frameshifting via an RNA structure very similar to that of genus Luteovirus (Fig. 9.1).",

The BYDV frameshift structure requires an additional stem-loop, the LDFE, located 4 kb downstream in the genome (Paul et al., 2001). The loop of this stem-loop base pairs to a large single-stranded bulge in the ADSL (Barry and Miller, 2002).

The ratio of firefly luciferase to Renilla luciferase produced in the frameshifted construct vs. a positive control with both luciferases in the same reading frame provides a measure of frameshift efficiency. Frameshift efficiency is about 1\u20132% for BYDV frameshift signals (Barry and Miller, 2002; Paul et al., 2001). Using this system Barry and Miller (2002) showed that mutations that disrupted the ADSL\u2013LDFE base pairing reduced frameshifting to background levels in vitro and in plant cells. In the context of the full-length viral RNA genome, the disruptive mutations also blocked frameshifting in vitro and prevented virus replication in vivo (oat cells). Compensating mutations that restored ADSL\u2013LDFE base pairing also restored frameshifting in vitro and allowed virus replication in oat cells (Barry and Miller, 2002).",

            "text": "In contrast to the requirement for an LDFE in BYDV RNA, Kim and Lommel (1998) reported that the shifty heptanucleotide and the adjacent bulged stem-loop (equivalent to the ADSL in BYDV) were necessary and sufficient for significant (~7%) frameshifting by RCNMV RNA and thus did not require downstream sequences including the stem-loop that we predict forms the LDFE (Fig. 9.1A). We suggest that these experiments may not have revealed all of the sequence requirements for frameshifting on the full-length viral RNA because the frameshifting constructs tested contained a very short (10 codon) first (zero frame) ORF from the start codon through the shifty site which is followed immediately by a stop codon. Indeed, in earlier studies of the BYDV frameshift sequences, Brault and Miller (1992) obtained similar results to those of Kim and Lommel (1998) with a similar construct containing a very short (nine codon) ORF upstream of the shifty site, along with the ADSL, but no LDFE. A peculiar finding was that, unlike in other well-studied \u22121 frameshift elements from retroviruses or coronaviruses, the stop codon immediately adjacent to the shifty site appeared to be required for the \u22121 frameshift (Brault and Miller, 1992). Thus, these early constructs in BYDV and more recent experiments with RCNMV, both characterized with a very short first (zero frame) ORF, may not behave \u201cnaturally.\u201d Certainly, a more native-like context is a full-length ORF encoding a functional protein upstream of the shifty site, as described more recently (Barry and Miller, 2002; Paul et al., 2001), employing either a dual luciferase reporter construct or the natural full-length viral genome. We speculate that ribosomes engaged in decoding a very short first ORF are in an initiation phase of the elongation process that may be \u201cshiftier\u201d than elongating ribosomes farther downstream from the start codon. This shiftiness could be aided by the nearby in-frame stop codon (Brault and Miller, 1992). Another possibility is that folding of the nascent protein may influence shiftiness. The nature of the polypeptide in the exit tunnel can influence ribosome elongation rate (Cruz-Vera et al., 2005; Lu and Deutsch, 2008) which, in turn, may influence frameshifting (Ivanov and Atkins, 2007). The amino terminus of the short ORF 1-encoded protein in the constructs (Brault and Miller, 1992; Kim and Lommel, 1998) would not have exited the polypeptide exit tunnel (~30 amino acids) when the ribosome encounters the shifty sequence and thus would be unable to fold. This is in contrast to the point at which the ribosome encounters the shifty site in the context of mRNAs encoding dual luciferase reporter or viral genome proteins. In this case, much or all of ORF1-encoded protein has been synthesized and likely folded outside of the ribosome, but it remains attached to the ribosome via the growing polypeptide chain near the carboxyl terminus. Folding of the nascent peptide after leaving the exit tunnel may affect elongation rate. Moreover, the dual luciferase reporter provides a more accurate measurement of frameshift rate because it allows measurement of the level of production of the first (zero frame) ORF as well as the post-shift (\u22121 frame) ORF. Finally, proximity of the frameshift site to the start codon has also been observed to affect +1 frameshifting in a misleading way. In this case, frameshifting was abolished when the +1 frameshift site was placed three codons downstream of the start codon (Belcourt and Farabaugh, 1990).",

Interestingly, in the dianthoviruses and umbraviruses, the putative LDFE we predict is located upstream of the cap-independent translation element that is also located in the 3\u2032 UTR (Mizumoto et al., 2003), whereas in the luteoviruses, the LDFE is downstream of the cap-independent translation element which is located in the 5\u2032 end of the 3\u2032 UTR (Paul et al., 2001). Phylogenetic conservation of base pairing is strong evidence of a biological function and given that the ADSL\u2013LDFE base pairing is required for BYDV frameshifting, frameshifting is its likely role for the other viruses, including dianthoviruses.",

A different type of ALIL in which the small stem-loop precedes the large bulged stem-loop, and base pairs to a bulge in the 5\u2032 side rather than the 3\u2032 side of the large bulged stem-loop, was shown recently to be required for frameshifting of bacterial transposable elements in the IS3 family (Mazauric et al., 2008). In that study, modeling predicted that the proximal (bottom) helix coaxially stacks with the bulge loop\u2013stem-loop helix (ADSL\u2013LDFE interaction) which forces a sharp bend at the junction of this helix with the upper helix in the ADSL.

All positive-strand RNA viruses must first translate the RdRp (replicase) prior to RNA replication. The replicase initiates complementary RNA synthesis at the 3\u2032 end of the viral template. Early in infection this template must be the same genomic RNA that is being translated. However, ribosomes on the viral RNA would interfere with the replicase moving in the opposite direction toward the 5\u2032 end (Gamarnik and Andino, 1998). Because frameshifting requires the long-distance interaction, the replicase could disrupt the LDFE in the 3\u2032 UTR, and thus block frameshifting, before the replicase reaches the translated ORF. By the time the replicase would reach the RdRp-encoding ORF, that portion of the RNA would be ribosome-free. A similar process is predicted to occur via a cap-independent translation element, located near the LDFE, which must base pair to the 5\u2032 UTR to initiate translation of both the pre-shift and post-shift (RdRp) ORFs (Guo et al., 2001). This interaction would also be disrupted by the replicase, shutting off translation initiation, freeing the entire viral genomic RNA of ribosomes, making it available for full replication (Barry and Miller, 2002). Future experimentation will determine the validity of this model.",

This RNA is compact and is largely triple-stranded RNA with the majority of the L1 and L2 loop nucleotides making noncanonical base\u2013base and base\u2013sugar edge hydrogen bonds with base pairs of the two stems. A protonated C8+ from loop L1 forms a standard Hoogsteen-type base pair with an accepting G12 as part of a C8+\u2022(G12\u2013C26) base triple at the helical junction (Fig. 9.3A). The two helical stems are strongly overrotated relative to one another, with the S1 G7\u2013C14 base pair actually stacked on the S2 C8+\u2022G12 Hoogsteen pair; this overrotation is partly mediated by an unpaired nucleotide (U12 in BWYV) that is flipped out of the stack and may function as a \u201cspacer\u201d at the helical junction. Thermodynamic and structural studies of the three other luteoviral RNA pseudoknots confirm that the C+\u2022(C\u2013G) L1\u2013S2 major groove triple base pair is a common feature of all P1\u2013P2 RNA pseudoknots from poleroviruses and the enamovirus (Fig. 9.3) (Nixon et al., 2002; Nixon and Giedroc, 2000). Although protonation of this cytidine is strongly stabilizing, the degree to which protonation affects frameshifting efficiency or mechanical stability (Tinoco et al., 2006) remains unknown.",

            "text": "An extensive mutational analysis of BWYV pseudoknot revealed that the hydrogen bonding interactions that stabilize the distinct helical junction region and the minor groove triplex are critical for supporting high levels of frameshift stimulation in vitro (Kim et al., 1999). However, a remarkable finding not predicted by the structure was that a single nucleotide insertion between G19 (or U19) and A20 at the tip of loop L2 dramatically increased frameshift stimulation, by upward of 300% (Kim et al., 1999) (see Fig. 9.3A, arrow). The origin of this stimulation is unknown and it is unclear the degree to which these mutations alter hydrogen bonding interactions of A20 with the G4\u2013C17 base pair (Su et al., 1999). It is interesting to note, however, that this region of the pseudoknot is likely in closest proximity, or in direct contact, with the ribosome during frameshifting. These findings seem to parallel those found for a single nucleotide deletion mutant in loop L2 in the ScYLV P1\u2013P2 frameshifting pseudoknot, which stimulates frameshifting by 200% relative to the wild-type RNA (C25; see Fig. 9.4D, below) (Cornish, Hennig and Giedroc, 2005), via an as-yet unknown mechanism. Along similar lines, substitution of the extrahelical \u201cspacer\u201d nucleotide at the helical junction (U13 in the BWYV RNA; U12 in PLRV; see purple base in Figs. 9.3A\u2013B) with A or G gives rise to a detectable decrease in frameshift stimulation (ranging from 35 to 90% of WT levels in vitro) (Kim et al., 1999, 2000). Since the analogous spacer adenosine in the PEMV-1 and ScYLV pseudoknots is highly dynamic in solution (Nixon et al., 2002; Cornish et al., 2005), the structural origin of this small effect is unknown; one possibility of course is that this nucleotide also makes physical contact with the ribosome mRNA entry tunnel given its close proximity to the \u201ctop\u201d of stem S1.",

In addition to A27 (and A25), the N1/N6 face of A26 forms two hydrogen bonds with the N3\u2013N2 edge of G7. The C24 N4 amino group is also close to the 2\u2032 OH of G17. A23 is stacked on C24, with the Watson\u2013Crick edge rotated out of the stack, leaving the N7 and N6 nitrogens within hydrogen bonding distance of the 2\u2032-OH of G17. At this point the PEMV-1 structure diverges from the BWYV/PLRV structures, with A22 stacked on A23, and essentially extruded from the triple helix, with A21 inserted back into the S1 minor groove near the top two S1 base pairs. G20 is extrahelical. In fact, if one considers A22 an extrahelical insertion in the PEMV-1 loop L2, the entire 5\u2032-A(A)ACAAA loop sequence adopts essentially identical conformations in all three pseudoknots (Fig. 9.4). As was found for the BWYV RNA, strong support for the functional importance of the key structural features was also obtained for the PEMV-1 RNA; for example, efforts to replace the unique PEMV-1 helical junction region with that of the BWYV RNA failed (Nixon et al., 2002).",

The unexpected finding from these experiments is that the C27A ScYLV RNA is a very poor frameshift stimulator in vitro (Cornish et al., 2005). This surprising finding, in turn, made the prediction that substitution of A25 in the BWYV RNA with cytidine (A25C) would increase frameshifting in this context; this is exactly what was found. Thus, a 3\u2032 L2 cytidine is a positive determinant for frameshift stimulation by luteoviral RNAs (Cornish et al., 2006). It would be of interest to determine the degree to which other Luteoviridae frameshifting pseudoknots with a cytidine in this position, e.g., cereal yellow dwarf virus (CYDV) and beet chlorosis virus (BCV) are also superior frameshift stimulators (Smith et al., 2000). The degree to which the C27A substitution (C1790A in the full-length genome) influences replication of ScYLV in plants is unknown; indeed, such an experiment is complicated by the fact that this substitution would result in a Thr-to-Asn substitution in the P1\u2013P2 fusion protein (Moonan et al., 2000).",

These results suggest that the lowest energy \u201cground-state\u201d structure is not strongly correlated with frameshift stimulation; instead, these findings point to a reduced stability that derives from an altered helical junction architecture in the C27A ScYLV RNA as of critical importance, for which there is some evidence (Cornish and Giedroc, 2006; Cornish et al., 2005).",

In fact, as discussed above, insertion or deletion of an unpaired and extrahelical residue(s) in loop L2 can strongly increase frameshifting efficiency, a finding often attributed to a direct interaction with the ribosome (Kim et al., 1999, 2000). We have argued that distinct unfolding thermodynamics measured for closely related RNAs, e.g., WT vs. C27A ScYLV RNAs, may in fact be reporting on different kinetics of pseudoknot unfolding, with increased rates of unfolding, i.e., unfolding at lower applied forces, negatively correlated with frameshift stimulation (Giedroc et al., 2000; Theimer and Giedroc, 2000). In other words, these studies suggest that the helical junction in luteoviral RNAs is mechanically stable and functions as a classic kinetic barrier to force-induced unfolding (Onoa et al., 2003), essentially placing the unfolding of the entire pseudoknot under kinetic control. This barrier is predicted to be altered in functionally compromised RNAs. Mechanical force-induced unfolding/refolding experiments will be required to obtain direct evidence for this proposal (Green et al., 2008; Hansen et al., 2007).",

Despite homology at the genome level, sobemoviruses are not classified in the Luteoviridae because, unlike Luteovirids, sobemoviruses (i) have a significantly smaller genome (just over 4 kb), (ii) encode a larger coat protein that lacks the readthrough domain found in the Luteoviridae, (iii) are mechanically transmissible, (iv) are not persistently transmitted by aphids, and (v) are not limited to the phloem (Miller et al., 2002; Tamm and Truve, 2000). All sobemoviruses employ \u22121 frameshifting, but recent resequencing results have challenged previous conclusions on the nature of the ORF translated via the frameshift. The most recent (and now apparently incorrect, see below) ICTV classification (Hull and Fargette, 2005) divides sobemoviruses into two subgroups: those in which the frameshift event shifts the ribosome out of the RdRp frame into a much shorter reading frame (ORF 3) and those in which the ribosome is shifted into the RdRp ORF (ORF 2b) as is the case with all other viruses discussed previously in this chapter.",

NC_001625), southern bean mosaic virus (SBMV, NC_004060), Rice yellow mottle virus (RYMV, NC_001575), Ryegrass mosaic virus (RGMoV, NC_003747), and Lucerne transient streak virus (LTSV, NC_001696) were thought to encode a protease, VPg, and RdRp all in ORF 2, which would have been translated as one large polyprotein of about 100 kDa (Fig. 9.5) (Tamm and Truve, 2000). A ribosomal frameshift site identified in the middle of this ORF was proposed to allow translation of a short ORF 3 of unknown function (Fig. 9.5). Other sobemoviruses, the first being cocksfoot mottle virus (CfMV, (Makinen et al., 1995)), were reported to have a more polerovirus-like genome organization with the protease and VPg encoded in ORF 2a and the RdRp translated from the overlapping ORF2b via \u22121 frameshift (Fig. 9.5). The amino acid sequences just downstream of the frameshift site were shown to be homologous between the two groups of viruses, i.e., ORF 3 of the viruses with the SCPMV-like organization was shown to be homologous to the portion of the 2b-encoded protein (RdRp) immediately downstream of the frameshift site in the CfMV-like viruses (Dwyer et al., 2003). Why would some viruses use frameshifting to produce a truncated version of the RdRp (those with ORF 3), while others use frameshifting to produce the entire RdRp (those with ORF 2b)? This puzzle was resolved recently by resequencing of all of the so-called SCPMV-like viral genomes which revealed that they all have CfMV-like genome organizations (Balke et al., 2007; Fargette et al., 2004; Lokesh et al., 2001; Meier and Truve, 2007). Meier and Truve (2007) showed that sequencing errors in the form of a single base insertion in the region of ORF 2\u2013ORF 3 overlap led to the appearance that the RdRp coding region was in the same ORF as the upstream protease coding region. Thus, the sequences thought to be in \u201cORF 3\u201d that were homologous to the 2b ORF are actually all encoded by ORF 2b. In short, resequencing revealed a paradigm shift on the role of the frameshift in sobemoviruses.\n",

No mutagenesis or structure probing has been performed to verify the structure, but it contains a highly stable, extremely GC-rich stem-loop predicted to be stabilized by a UNCG or GNRA tetraloop at the end (Fig. 9.5). It is conserved in all sobemoviruses, and no alternative structures such as a pseudoknot have been reported or predicted. This imperfect stem-loop superficially resembles the bipartite stem-loop that stimulates \u22121 frameshifting of HIV-1 and SIV RNAs (Gaudin et al., 2005; Marcheschi et al., 2007; Staple and Butcher, 2005).",

The +1 frameshift was proposed to occur either at the stop codon of the 1a ORF in beet yellow virus (BYV) (Agranovsky et al., 1994) or at a rare codon at the homologous position in citrus tristeza virus (CTV) (Karasev et al., 1995). Either codon would facilitate frameshifting by inducing ribosomes to pause, analogous to the mechanism of +1 frameshifting transposable elements in yeast (Belcourt and Farabaugh, 1990). Sequencing of additional closterovirids revealed no obvious conserved frameshift site. Similar to BYV, pineapple mealybug wilt-associated virus-1 (PMWaV-1) has a putative +1 frameshift site, GUUU\nAG\nC, in which underlined bases indicate the ORF 1a stop codon (UAA in BYV) and italics indicate first codon (asparagine) of the 1b ORF (Melzer et al., 2008). In contrast closteroviruses PMWaV-2 and grapevine leafroll-associated virus-3 (GLRaV-3) have an entirely different sequence at this location in the genome, UUUCGAG (proposed first codon of ORF 1b in italics), at which the +1 shift is proposed to occur (Melzer et al., 2008). We await experimental evidence to determine if either of these sites is the actual frameshift site.",

The lack of detection of the expected full-length 1a\u20131b protein, or a larger precursor of the 57-kDa product, leaves the mechanism of expression of the RdRp domain in doubt.

The 34-kDa CP ORF terminates with the sequence AAU AGA AAA UGA, with the A UG forming a potential start codon for the 12-kDa ORF. In reticulocyte lysates, Gramstat et al. (1994) showed that the 12-kDa protein can be synthesized by initiation at the AUG, but of greater interest is that the 12 kDa is also present fused to the C terminus of the CP via a \u22121 frameshift that does not require the canonical shifty heptanucleotide, nor does it require a downstream structured element. Instead, this frameshift requires only a homotetramer of AAAA or UUUU immediately upstream of an adjacent stop codon. The overlapping AUG in the 12-kDa ORF frame is not necessary for frameshifting. The authors propose a model in which ribosome slippage occurs with the tRNA:mRNA base-paired only at the P-site, rather than the canonical simultaneous A- and P-site slippage, because the A-site would be at the stop codon (Gramstat et al., 1994). Readers should be aware that the analysis of the frameshift signal was performed using only rabbit reticulocyte lysates which often have reduced translational fidelity relative to wheat germ extract (Dinesh-Kumar et al., 1992; Kozak, 1990) or, most importantly, compared to the environment in vivo. The evidence that this frameshift takes place in vivo is identification of a low-abundance protein of the expected size using antisera targeted to either the product of the 34-kDa CP ORF or the 12-kDa ORF. We are unaware of any subsequent research that confirms the proposed frameshift process in vivo.",

However, a small overlapping ORF called pipo was discovered recently using bioinformatic methods (Chung et al., 2008). This ORF, which ranges in size from 60 to 115 codons depending on the virus, is in the +2 (or \u22121) frame relative to the polyprotein ORF and overlaps with the polyprotein ORF region coding for the P3 protein (Fig. 9.6). In turnip mosaic potyvirus (TuMV), the amino acid sequence (referred to in uppercase as PIPO) encoded by pipo has a molecular weight of 7 kDa, but antibodies against this protein detected only a ~25-kDa protein in TuMV-infected plants (Chung et al., 2008). A protein of this size is consistent with a fusion product of the amino terminal portion of the P3 protein (after proteolytic cleavage of P3 from the polyprotein) fused to PIPO and terminating at the pipo stop codon (Fig. 9.6). Thus, PIPO does not appear to be translated independently.\n",

A likely frameshift site is the G1\u20132A6\u20137 motif which is the only well-conserved sequence in pipo and is predicted to be the start of the pipo ORF based on the presence of in-frame stop codons upstream in some potyviruses (Chung et al., 2008). GAA AAA A (gaps separate codons in the polyprotein ORF) does not fit the canonical X XXY YYZ shifty sequence at the \u22121 frameshift site used by other viruses, although it is conceivable that ribosomes could shift reading frame in the homopolymeric A tract. It is noteworthy that the potyvirus G1\u20132A6\u20137 motif resembles the AGA AAA UGA sequence at the reading frame change site in carlaviruses (above), suggesting that a possible common frameshift mechanism may be employed by these unrelated virus groups. No conserved secondary structures, such as those required for conventional \u22121 frameshifting, have been detected downstream of the G1\u20132A6\u20137 motif in potyviral RNAs (Chung et al., 2008). Thus, if \u22121 or +2 frameshifting or a type of ribosome hop that leads to a net change of +2 in reading frame takes place, it is likely to be via a mechanism different from that of \u201ccanonical\u201d \u22121 frameshifting. Other nontranslational mechanisms can explain the production of a 25-kDa protein containing PIPO epitopes, so further experimentation is necessary to determine whether potyviruses employ frameshifting.",

While some of the shifty heptanucleotide sites are the same in plant and animal viruses, the specific downstream structures that facilitate \u22121 frameshifting differ significantly between viruses of the two kingdoms. No ALIL-like structures that base pair with a stem-loop kilobases downstream are known outside of the plant viruses. At the other extreme, the polero- and enamoviruses have the smallest known frameshift pseudoknots, enabling the highest levels of structural characterization of any frameshift-inducing structure. As these structures facilitate frameshifting in rabbit reticulocyte lysates (Cornish et al., 2005; Kim et al., 1999, 2000; Nixon et al., 2002), the reason why they exist only in plant viruses is not likely due to special features unique to plant ribosomes. These plant virus frameshift signals add to the large and diverse pool of eukaryotic frameshift elements, which should perhaps help us solve the question of why some RNA structures, but not others of similar apparent stability, interact with the ribosome in a way that brings about a \u22121 frameshift. The apparent +1 frameshift of closteroviruses appears to be confined to the plant virus world as are the possible \u22121 frameshift signals in carlaviruses and potyviruses. Thus, we eagerly anticipate results of future research and structural analysis to determine how these diverse plant viral RNAs induce ribosomes to change reading frames by what may be novel mechanisms.",

All sobemoviruses have the CfMV-like organization (Meier and Truve, 2007). Top: Predicted secondary structures of the indicated sobemoviral RNAs at the \u22121 frameshift site (Makinen et al., 1995). Slippery site is in italics. Underlined bases extend the helix in selected viruses but this additional base pairing is not phylogenetically conserved. Frameshifting has been demonstrated only for CfMV and no data exist to support or refute the secondary structures",

An example of the conserved A1\u20132G6\u20137 site is shown at the start of the pipo ORF with lines under the codons in the zero frame (polyprotein ORF) and lines over the codons in the \u22121 frame (pipo ORF). The 25-kDa protein that could be generated by a frameshift followed by cleavage at the HC-Pro/P3 cleavage site is indicated (Chung et al., 2008)",
