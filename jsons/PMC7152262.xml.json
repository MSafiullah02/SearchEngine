Table 5.1\nsummarizes these steps with examples for pathogens that have a licensed vaccine. The first step is the generation of the antigen used to induce an immune response. This step includes the generation of the pathogen itself (for subsequent inactivation or isolation of a subunit) or generation of a recombinant protein derived from the pathogen. Vaccines under development use additional methods that will be discussed later. Viruses are grown in cells, which can be either primary cells, such as chicken fibroblasts (e.g., yellow fever vaccine), or continuous cell lines, such as MRC-5 (e.g., hepatitis A vaccine). Bacterial pathogens are grown in bioreactors using medium developed to optimize the yield of the antigen while maintaining its integrity. Recombinant proteins can be manufactured in bacteria, yeast, or cell culture. The viral and bacterial seed cultures and the cell lines used for viral production are carefully controlled, stored, characterized, and, often, protected. The first step in manufacture is the establishment of a \u201cmaster cell bank.\u201d This is a collection of vialed cells that form the starting material for all future production. It is extensively characterized for performance and the absence of any adventitious agents. From this bank, working cell banks are prepared that are used as the routine starting culture for production lots. The final vaccine is a direct function of its starting materials, and a change in this seed can be as complicated as initiating a new product development altogether.",

For vaccines that are composed of recombinant proteins, this step may involve many unit operations of column chromatography and ultrafiltration. For an inactivated viral vaccine, there may simply be inactivation of isolated virus with no further purification. The formulation of the vaccine is designed to maximize the stability of the vaccine while delivering it in a format that allows efficient distribution and preferred clinical delivery of the product.

The sensitivity of vaccines to adverse environmental conditions, particularly temperature extremes, varies depending on their composition. Live attenuated vaccines tend to be more susceptible than inactivated vaccines and toxoids.1 Vaccines are formulated such that the potency at the end of shelf-life remains above the effective dose demonstrated in human clinical trials. As the product may degrade over the 2 to 3 years of shelf life, the release target potency may be significantly above the specified end-of-shelf-life specification. This \u201coverformulation\u201d can represent a significant production yield loss and cost-of-goods increase for the final product in order to support the necessary lead times to deliver and store the vaccines, especially if they are used as a rotating stockpile to protect against supply interruption or an emergency use that does not materialize. The addition of stabilizers or lyophilization, when feasible, tends to improve the thermal resistance of vaccines. Storage at very low temperatures within the manufacturing supply chain may be used to reduce potency loss during storage.",

The HBsAg is purified to greater than 99% for protein by a series of physical and chemical methods. The purified protein is treated in phosphate buffer with formaldehyde, sterile filtered, and then coprecipitated with alum (potassium aluminum sulfate) to form bulk vaccine adjuvanted with amorphous aluminum hydroxyphosphate sulfate. The vaccine contains no detectable yeast DNA but may contain not more than 1% yeast protein.7, 19, 21 In a second recombinant hepatitis B vaccine, the surface antigen expressed in S. cerevisiae cells is purified by several physiochemical steps and formulated as a suspension of the antigen absorbed on aluminum hydroxide. The procedures used in its manufacturing result in a product that contains no more than 5% yeast protein. No substances of human origin are used in its manufacture.20 Vaccines against hepatitis B prepared from recombinant yeast cultures are noninfectious20 and are free of association with human blood and blood products.19\n",

These proteins are targets of neutralizing antibodies and are essential components of a vaccine. Owing to inherent properties of the lipid envelope, assembly of VLPs in insect cells for these viral vaccines is a different type of technical challenge to those produced viruses with multiple capsids.1 For these targets, production of VLPs is a challenging task because the synthesis and assembly of one or more recombinant proteins may be required. This is the case for VLPs of rotavirus, which is an RNA virus with capsids formed by 1860 monomers of four different proteins. In addition, the production of most VLPs requires the simultaneous expression and assembly of several recombinant proteins, which, in the case of RLP, needs to occur in a single host cell.26 Purification of VLPs also constitutes a particularly challenging task. VLPs are structures of several nanometers in diameter and of molecular weights in the range of 106 Da. Also, for guaranteeing the quality of the product, it is not sufficient to demonstrate the absence of contaminant proteins; it is also necessary to show that proteins are correctly assembled into VLPs.",

The primary challenge of HPV vaccine formulation development was the preparation of aqueous HPV VLP solutions that are stable under a variety of purification, processing, and storage conditions. By treating the HPV VLPs through a process of disassembly and reassembly, the stability and in vitro potency of the vaccine are enhanced significantly. In addition, the in vivo immunogenicity of the vaccine was also improved by as much as approximately 10-fold, as shown in mouse potency studies.27 The disassembly and reassembly of particles may also be important to remove residual proteins from the expression system or host cells used in the production and is a serious processing challenge, particularly for enveloped VLPs.",

Large-scale production was used to increase capacity to meet the increased demand for these lifesaving products. The cost of these facilities was increasingly expensive through the past few decades, and systems were increasingly complex to automate, clean, sterilize, and validate the facilities for manufacturing. Large central manufacturing facilities enabled lower cost of manufacturing; higher volumes were needed to lower the high fixed cost of construction, validation, and operation.

Many of these concerns are being overcome in time through polymer engineering, and altering production techniques. Next, the ability to eliminate the high cost of cleaning and sterilizing equipment requires that the entire system be single-use. Many processes have not been able to make this conversion because of yield (low yield means high volume; volumes >2000 L are challenging because of weight and hydrostatic pressure), pressure (high O2 demand, aeration volume, or flow rate), solvent use, and temperature control (heat transfer limitations).

Today, a vast majority of supply of vaccines comes from a handful of developed countries because of the cost and complexity of the large-scale facilities and the profitability of those markets that support the significant manufacturing and clinical investment of public companies necessary to license and manufacture a vaccine. Once a large facility is built, duplicating it is a significant challenge as the complexity of the support systems essentially makes every facility unique. The advent of low-capital, single-use manufacturing platforms supports \u201cscale-out\u201d of processes built with \u201coff-the-shelf\u201d single-use systems, truly duplicating the original licensed process and minimizing the challenge of providing equivalence of the product from new facilities to the original facility. One can also imagine making clinical materials at modest scale and avoiding the challenge of scale-up for all markets, which could leverage addition of multiple single-use bioreactors instead of a large stainless system as demand grows. The approach supports a \u201cpay-as-you-go\u201d capital approach, avoiding large investments prior to demonstrating proof of concept and has the promise to make product available more broadly and more quickly after license through global partnerships and distribution of facilities nearer to the market they will serve. It is well aligned with the current developing policies of multiple emerging economies to be self-reliant for essential services like vaccine supply. For example, a 2009 agreement between GlaxoSmithKline and Brazil describes the sale of GlaxoSmithKline pneumococcal conjugate vaccine to Brazil for 8 years, with an agreement to transfer the manufacturing process to Brazil for potential use in future years.32\n",

There are some challenges to be considered. Maintaining alignment of the process among multiple facilities can be challenging in biological manufacturing processes. A process can \u201cdrift\u201d in any single plant; having multiple manufacturing plants increases the chances that at least one plant will drift from the licensed, proven process. Likewise, control of raw material quality and source, single-use component supply, changes in supplier's materials in components, and similar unintended, unexpected consequences can leave a region without supply until the issue is identified and resolved. Single-use systems are ever improving; keeping the very specific needs of a process may be challenging with multiple small purchasers of the equipment versus a large central organization.

This combined with the relatively high productivity of doses/liter of capacity results in a lower cost of manufacture. Because the risk of vaccine-associated paralytic poliomyelitis (VAPP) is estimated at 0.42 per million33 over a three-dose schedule, there is a planned transition to the Salk IPV as the polio comes closer to eradication.

With two vaccines required for efficacy testing, defining exactly what the potency requirements are from each component will be important during clinical studies to ensure that future batches for distribution meet these criteria. It may require a prime-boost immunogenicity evaluation in animals for batch release, which has decreased with improved in vitro methods for potency evaluation of vaccines.",

Most vaccine companies focus on a core set of vaccine platform technologies, which allow them to build expertise in process development, assay development, and manufacturing facilities. Nearly all of the vaccines cited for HIV, TB, and malaria use products from separate organizations. Ultimately, if the vaccines prove successful, there needs to be a single regulatory license holder responsible for the distribution of the vaccine, which requires careful collaboration between the different organizations for licensure and life-cycle management of the vaccines.",

Given this, there is limited focus on the future manufacturing supply chain and production costs. Even at these early stages of clinical studies, however, it is important to ensure partnerships are clearly defined among vaccine developers, and the clinical studies are designed to demonstrate the true requirement for the prime-boost regime and the characteristics that each component must elicit after immunization. Early cost modeling can help target investments in process development to ensure that a successful signal in efficacy testing can ultimately result in a vaccine that can be successfully manufactured and distributed to the target populations.",

            "text": "A final challenge will be the coordination of the supply chains. As two separate vaccines are required for complete immunizations and potentially different immunization times, deployment and supply of the vaccines have to be synchronized to demand. For routine immunizations this is relatively straightforward; but for any catch-up or mass vaccination campaigns, it requires care management of expiration dates and planning. Vaccine supply shortages are unfortunately not uncommon, and a requirement for multiple vaccines increases the possibility that one might not be continuously available, creating partially immunized and potentially off-schedule immunized individuals. The implications of these scenarios may have to be explored during Phase II dosing studies or postmarketing surveillance.",
