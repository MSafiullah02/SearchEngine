However, many hyper-endemic regions or countries are not able to provide the sufficient RT-PCR testing for tens of thousands of suspected patients. To address the lack of reagents, efforts have been made to detect COVID-19 from CT images. Fang et al. [6] reported the high sensitivity (up to 98%) of chest CT for COVID-19 screening in a series of 51 patients. To speed up the screening, Ophir et al. [8] employed the deep learning technology to detect COVID-19 on CT images. Shi et al. [13] collected a large-scale COVID-19 CT dataset and developed an machine learning based method for COVID-19 screening. A drawback of CT imaging is that typically it takes considerably more time than X-ray imaging. Besides, sufficient high-quality CT scanners may not be available in many under-developed regions, making timely COVID-19 screening become impossible. In contrast, X-rays are the most common and widely available diagnostic imaging technique, playing a crucial role in clinical care and epidemiological studies [7, 4] . Most ambulatory care facilities, even in rural regions, have deployed X-ray units as a basic diagnostic imaging. Besides, real-time imaging of X-rays would significantly speed up the disease screening.",

The detected suspected COVID-19 patients will then be reported for the next clinical viral nucleic acid detection. Detecting COVID-19 using chest X-ray with high sensitivity is very challenging, not only due to the ribs overlying soft tissue and low contrast but also because of the limited availability of a large number of annotated data. This is particularly true for deep learning based approaches as deep learning is notoriously being data hungry. To tackle this problem, we collect additional pneumonia images from the public ChestX-ray14 dataset [14] as non-COVID-19 cases. To address the data imbalance problem existing between COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 cases, we propose a X-raybased COVID-19 screening model, inspired by [11] , to promote the imbalance binary classification task through the anomaly detection task.",

Given an input chest X-ray image x, we employ the backbone network to extract its high-level features, which are then input into the classification head and anomaly detection head, respectively. The classification head generates a classification score p cls , and the anomaly detection head generates a scalar anomaly score p ano . Subsequently, we calculate another scalar score \u00b5 as a reference by randomly selecting l normal X-ray images and calculating the mean of l anomaly scores of them. Finally, we optimize the model via minimizing the binary cross entropy loss for classification and the deviation loss for anomaly detection, aiming to assign statistically significantly larger classification scores and anomaly scores to X-ray images with COVID-19 than those assigned to normal controls.",

The second split contains 50 images of 37 COVID-19 patients and 717 images of 516 other pneumonia patients for testing and others for training. The final performance is the average performance on two splits. The parameter T controls the trade-off between the true positive rate (i.e., sensitivity) and true negative rate (i.e., specificity). To investigate the impact of T on the screening performance, we performed the inference stage with different values of T , including 0.50, 0.40, 0.30, 0.25, 0.20 and 0.15. The screening performance obtained by our model was reported in Table 1 and Figure 2 . It shows that",

[13] achieved the sensitivity of 90.70% and specificity of 83.30% on a large-scale CT dataset, including 1658 subjects with COVID-19 and 1027 subjects with non-COVID-19 pneumonia. In this study, our model achieves the sensitivity of 90.00% specificity of 87.84% (when T = 0.25) or the sensitivity of 96.00% specificity of 70.65% (when T = 0.15) on the X-ray dataset that contains 100 images from 70 COVID-19 subjects and 1431 images from 1008 non-COVID-19 pneumonia subjects. Compare to the CT-based screening method, our X-ray-based model achieves the comparable performance. More important, our model only learns from 70 COVID-19 subjects, which is less than 5 percent of [13] . Therefore, the proposed model that uses chest X-ray can be considered as an effective computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) tool for low-cost and fast COVID-19 screening. However, our model still has several limitations, such as missing 4% COVID-19 cases and almost 30% of false positive rate. Our future work will focus on further reducing the false negative rate and, if possible, decreasing the false positive rate as well. We will also investigate how to differentiate the COVID-19 severity using chest X-ray and then detect the potentially severe cases for the early treatment, which requires more clinical diagnostic information. What's more, more clinical data are needed to further validate and improve the effectiveness of our model.",
