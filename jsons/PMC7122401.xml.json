Initially, IBV was recognized as primarily a disease of young chickens; however it was later recorded to be common in semi-mature and laying flocks. Other manifestations of IBV include decline in egg production in laying flocks noted following the typical respiratory disease in the 1940s, kidney lesions observed in the 1960s (Cavanagh and Gelb 2008), enteric lesions observed in 1985, and more recently proventriculus affection in 1998.",

The coronaviruses possess the largest RNA genome of all RNA viruses and replicate by a unique mechanism associated with a multiple subgenomic nested set of mRNAs and high frequency of recombination. The subfamily Coronavirinae contains four distinct genera: Alphacoronavirus, Betacoronavirus, Deltacoronavirus, and Gammacoronavirus. To date, viruses of Alphacoronavirus and Betacoronavirus have been isolated from mammals, while deltacoronaviruses have been isolated from birds and pigs (Table 5.1) (Woo et al. 2012). Meanwhile, gammacoronaviruses are found in birds, except for the coronaviruses detected in beluga whale and bottlenose dolphin (Mihindukulasuriya et al. 2008; Woo et al. 2010).\n",

            "text": "The spike protein is petal-shaped protrusions of about 20 nm in length that emerge from the virion envelope. A cleaved N-terminal signal peptide (Binns et al. 1985) directs the S protein toward the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) where it undergoes terminal N-linked glycosylation (Cavanagh 1983a, b). After glycosylation, the monomers oligomerize to form dimers or trimers (Cavanagh 1983a, b; Delmas and Laude 1990; Lewicki and Gallagher 2002). The S protein of IBV is cleaved by a furin-like host cell protease at the highly basic motif RRFRR generating S1 (90 kDa) and S2 (84 kDa) subunits of about 500 and 600 amino acids in size, respectively (Cavanagh 1983a, b). The N-terminal part of S1 forms an ectodomain, while the C-terminal S2 subunit comprises a narrow stalk ectodomain, short transmembrane, and endodomain. All the receptor-binding domains (RBD) of IBV are located in S1 domain (Masters and Perlman 2013; Promkuntod et al. 2014). After endocytosis, conformational changes in the S protein are triggered by exposure to acidic pH in endosomes (Chu et al. 2006), resulting in fusion of the viral envelope with the cellular membrane. The nucleotide sequence of the S1 subunit is used for genotyping IBV isolates (OIE 2013). S protein contains epitopes for neutralization (Cavanagh 1983a, b; Kant et al. 1992; Koch et al. 1990; Mockett et al. 1984; Niesters et al. 1987b). In the S1 subunit, three hypervariable regions (HVRs) are located within amino acids 38\u201367, 91\u2013141, and 274\u2013387 (Kant et al. 1992; Koch et al. 1991). Neutralizing-serotype-specific epitopes are associated within the defined serotypes (Cavanagh et al. 1988; Niesters et al. 1987a; Jia et al. 1996). N38S, H43Q, P63S, and T69I amino acid substitutions lead to loss of the ability of M41 strain to bind to the trachea (Promkuntod et al. 2014).",

            "text": "It is suggested that the emergence of IBV appears to be a regular influx, and up to date, more than 65 different types do exist worldwide (Table 5.2). Different serotypes generally have large differences (20\u201350 %) in the deduced amino acid sequences of the S1 subunit (Kusters et al. 1989). IBV serotypes that share more than 95 % amino acid identity in S1 should have cross protection, whereas IBV strains of other serotypes share less than 85 % amino acid identity did not cross protect each other (Cavanagh and Gelb 2008). Poor cross protection was found in viruses that are clearly distinguishable in only 2\u20133% differences in amino acid sequences (Cavanagh 1991; Abdel-Moneim et al. 2006). This diversity in S1 probably results from mutation, recombination, and strong positive selection in vivo (Cavanagh et al. 1988, 1990). The widespread use of live attenuated vaccine strains and the subsequent selective pressure induced by neutralizing antibodies against the spike may force the adaptation of the virus to escape immunity and hence result in faster evolutionary rates (Jackwood 2012). Error prone during replication is not expected to constitute a major role in the evolution of IBV, since RdRp possesses exoribonuclease (ExoN) activity that provides some proofreading errors during coronavirus replication (Minskaia et al. 2006). During the replication of the IBV, both full genomic minus-strand template and the subgenomic minus-strand templates are generated by continuous and discontinuous unique mechanisms, respectively; the latter allows recombination between RNA viruses (Sawicki and Sawicki 1995). Although recombination was found throughout the whole IBV genome, hot spots of recombination have been found in the upstream of S glycoprotein gene in the nonstructural proteins 2, 3, and 16, in the E and M genes as well as the area near the 3\u2032 UTR (Thor et al. 2011). Recombination in different genes of IBV could affect the pathogenicity and virus virulence, but recombination of the S gene may result in the emergence of new strains, new serotypes, or even new viruses infecting other hosts (Jackwood et al. 2010a). Natural intergenic and intertypic recombination occurs naturally in an extensive manner (Cavanagh et al. 1992b; Wang et al. 1993; Jia et al. 1995; Lee and Jackwood 2000; Brooks et al. 2004; Bochkov et al. 2007; Ammayappan et al. 2008; Kuo et al. 2010; Mardani et al. 2010; Pohuang et al. 2011; Ovchinnikova et al. 2011; Thor et al. 2011; Liu et al. 2013; Song et al. 2013; Zhao et al. 2013; Hewson et al. 2014; Zhang et al. 2015). Interestingly, mosaic S1-containing recombinants from three different genotypes (H120, QX, D274) were reported in Russia (Ovchinnikova et al. 2011). In addition, recombination of distant unrecognized gammacoronavirus with a known IBV strain resulted in the evolution of gammacoronavirus able to infect turkeys (Jackwood et al. 2010a).\n",

This replicase-transcriptase complex synthesizes a full-length negative-sense RNA copy, which is used as a template for the transcription of full-length and six subgenomic mRNAs that possess identical 3\u2032 ends but different lengths (Fig. 5.3) (Sawicki and Sawicki 1990; Sethna et al. 1989). The initiation point of each mRNA corresponds to a stretch of consensus sequences, called intergenic sequences or transcription-regulatory sequences (TRSs, 5\u2032 CT(T/G)AACAA(A/T)3\u2032) that are found at the 3\u2032 end of the leader sequence and at different positions upstream of genes in the genomic 3\u2032-proximal domain of IBV. The 5\u2032 two-thirds of the genome, 1a and 1b, encoding polyprotein precursor that is translated into a large polyprotein, 1ab, through a ribosomal frameshift mechanism (Brierley et al. 1989) and processed into 15 nonstructural proteins (nsp2\u201316) involved in virus replication. Papain-like proteinase (PLpro), main protease (Mpro) or 3CLpro (because it has some similarities to the 3C proteases of picornaviruses), adenosine diphosphate-ribose 1-phosphatase (nsp3), RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (nsp12, RdRp), and RNA helicase (nsp13), exonuclease (nsp14), endoribonuclease (nsp15), and 2-O-methyltransferase (nsp16) (Snijder et al. 2003; Fang et al. 2010) are among the important replication enzymes encoded by the replicase gene. Exonuclease and endoribonuclease are involved in processing RNA (Ivanov et al. 2004; Fang et al. 2010). The remaining 3\u2032 third of the genome encoding the structural genes in addition to accessory genes interspersed within the structural gene region. Each viral subgenomic mRNA is used for translation of a single viral protein. The four structural proteins, spike (S), nucleocapsid (N), membrane (M), and envelope (E) proteins, are translated from separate mRNA. The accessory genes encode gene products although not essential for virus replication, but their deletion often causes viral attenuation (de Haan et al. 2002).\n",

IBV can establish persistent infections when it affects the genital system of birds during early days of life; virus shedding is detected approximately when the egg production started. Reports of extended and intermittent shedding through nasal and fecal discharge are evident and could constitute a potential risk of flock-to-flock transmission (Jones and Ambali 1987; Adzhar et al. 1996; Alexander and Gough 1978; Cook 1968; Alexander and Gough 1977).",

The respiratory clinical form of IBV infection in chicks includes: nasal discharge, sneezing, coughing, and gasping. Some chicks may develop wet eyes and swollen sinuses. In chickens more than 6 weeks of age and older, the signs are similar to those in chicks, and the respiratory clinical form occurs but in a milder form (Cavanagh and Gelb 2008). Nephropathogenic viruses induce respiratory distress in addition to signs of ruffled feathers, wet droppings, increased water intake, and mortality (Winterfield and Hitchner 1962). In laying flocks, declines in egg production and quality are seen in addition to respiratory signs. About 6 to 8 weeks may elapse before production returns to the pre-infection level, but in some cases, this is never attained. The severity of the production declines may vary with the period of lay (van Eck 1983). In addition to production declines, the number of eggs unacceptable for setting is increased, hatchability is reduced, and soft-shelled, misshapen, and rough-shelled eggs are produced (Crinion 1972). The albumen may be thin and watery without definite demarcation between the thick and thin albumen of the normal fresh egg. Infectious bronchitis virus infection of 1-day-old chicks can produce permanent damage to oviducts leading to reduced egg production and inferior quality eggs when the chickens come into lay. The severity of oviduct lesions is likely to be less in infections of older chickens, and some serotypes may fail to produce any pathologic change even in infections of 1-day-old chicks. The presence of specific maternal antibody was also shown to protect the oviduct from damage due to IBV infection in early life (Chew et al. 1997).",

Maximum virus shedding occurs 3\u20135 days after infection in the nose and trachea (Cavanagh 2003; Hofstad and Yoder 1966; Ambali and Jones 1990). High virus titers occur also in the lungs and air sacs (Raj and Jones 1997). IBV grows also in the epithelial lining of the kidney, oviduct, testes, esophagus, proventriculus, duodenum, jejunum, spleen, bursa of Fabricius, cecal tonsils, Harderian gland, rectum, and cloaca (Cavanagh 2003; Raj and Jones 1997; Abdel-Moneim et al. 2005; Ambali and Jones 1990; Seo et al. 1997) with minimal pathological effect. The virus commonly persists in the alimentary tract in young chickens (Ambali and Jones 1990; Alvarado et al. 2006) and in layers in the absence of clinical disease (Jones and Ambali 1987). Proventricular-type IBV (QX) reported in 1996 in China induces hemorrhagic ulceration of proventriculi and diarrhea followed by obvious signs of respiratory disease and high mortality (Zhou et al. 1998; GenCheng et al. 1998). Nephropathogenic strains result in considerable mortalities in meat-type birds (Cook et al. 2001; Lambrechts et al. 1993; Li and Yang 2001; Pensaert and Lambrechts 1994). The virus replicates in renal tubules and ducts, distal convoluted tubules, and Henle\u2019s loops (Chen and Itakura 1996) but may also replicate in the renal glomeruli (Fig. 5.5) (Abdel-Moneim et al. 2005). Modest to high titers of IBV in the kidney do not necessarily correlate with overt kidney disease, and there may be no gross kidney lesion (Ambali and Jones 1990). IBV infection of the chicken reproductive system leads to decreased egg production and quality due to the infection of the oviduct. In roosters, the virus results in epididymal stones, decreases sperm production, and decreases serum testosterone concentrations (Boltz et al. 2004). Infection is commonly followed by secondary bacterial infections, which may increase the mortality and complicate the clinical situation (Vandekerchove et al. 2004). Infection of enteric tissues usually does not manifest itself clinically.\n",

            "text": "Hyperplasia of the goblet cells and alveolar mucous glands with subsequent increase in seromucous nasal discharge and catarrhal exudates in the trachea are the first response of the innate immunity against IBV infection (Nakamura et al. 1991). Toll-like receptor (TLR) 21 is stimulated by the presence of deoxyoligonucleotides containing CpG motifs, and it induces NF-\u049dB production, leading to enhanced transcription of a number of cytokines (Brownlie et al. 2009). A rapid influx of macrophages to the infected tissue, detected within hours postinfection, plays an important role in limiting the replication of IBV within respiratory tissues. Heterophils are responsible for the destruction of IBV-infected cells during initial infection by phagocytosis and oxidative lysosomal enzyme release (Fulton et al. 1997). However, at the tracheal epithelium, heterophils do not reduce virus replication but worsen the severity of lesions (Raj et al. 1997). Interferon production in the plasma and all over body tissues (Otsuki et al. 1987), with simultaneous upregulation of mRNA levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6 and IL-1\u03b2) and lipopolysaccharide-induced tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1 factor, is produced during IBV infection. This coincides with the highest viral loads and microscopic lesions, indicating a potential role of these cytokines with high virus loads and the development of tracheal and kidney lesions (Okino et al. 2014; Jang et al. 2013; Chhabra et al. 2015). In contrast, il6 gene expression and upregulation of IFN-\u03b3, IL-8 (CXCLi2), and MIP-1\u03b2 genes together with mannose-binding lectin (MBL), which activates complement, inhibit the propagation of the virus (Juul-Madsen et al. 2007). Apoptosis is another nonspecific defense mechanism against IBV infection by premature lysis of infected cells, thereby aborting viral multiplication (Cong et al. 2013).",

In contrast, it has also been reported that high titers of humoral antibodies correlate well with the absence of virus re-isolation from the kidneys and genital tract (Gough et al. 1977; Macdonald et al. 1981; Yachida et al. 1985) and protection against a drop in egg production (Box et al. 1988). IBV-specific antibodies were suggested to be involved in limiting IBV spread by viremia from the trachea to other susceptible organs, including the kidneys and oviduct (Raj and Jones 1997). In general, serum antibody levels do not closely correlate with tissue protection, but local antibodies may contribute to the protection of the respiratory tract (Ignjatovic and McWaters 1991; Raggi and Lee 1965). Furthermore, IBV-specific IgA antibodies were first detected in tears and later in serum, which suggests that IgA is important in neutralizing IBV at mucosal surfaces and is thought to play a role in the control of IBV locally (Davelaar et al. 1982; Gelb et al. 1998). However, IgA might not be important in protection against IBV infection of the upper respiratory tract, whereas locally produced IgY, after a secondary immunization, provided effective protection against IBV by neutralizing this virus (Guo et al. 2008; Orr-Burks et al. 2014).",

Blind passage into another set of eggs for up to a total of three to four passages is conducted. The last passage is left for 7 days to screen the presence of pathognomonic embryonic changes: stunted and curled embryos (Fig. 5.6) with feather dystrophy and urate deposits in the mesonephros. These lesions could also appear as early as the second passage (Delaplane 1947). The embryo-adapted strains induce more embryo mortalities.

            "text": "IBV exerts hemagglutination (HA) activity only after phospholipase C treatment of concentrated virus infected allanto-aminiotic fluids (Bingham et al. 1975). A rapid plate HA test to detect neuraminidase-treated IBV in the allantoic fluid of ECE was introduced into the routine procedure of IBV identification and was found to correlate with the RT-PCR during the early stages of IBV detection and identification and isolation in ECE (Ruano et al. 2000). Such technique depends on the principle that IBV acquires its HA activity after removal of \u03b1 2, 3-linked N-acetyl neuraminic acid from the virion surface (Schultze et al. 1992). IBV can also be detected using immunofluorescence or immunoperoxidase on the tracheal or kidney section from the field isolates or on the chorioallantoic membrane or TOC from the inoculated embryos (Handberg et al. 1999; Abdel-Moneim et al. 2009; Bhattacharjee et al. 1994). However, nonspecific reactions or lower sensitivity especially in field samples may occur (Braune and Gentry 1965; Yagyu and Ohta 1990; Benyeda et al. 2010). The specificity of IFA may possibly be improved by using monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) (Naqi 1990; Yagyu and Ohta 1990; De Wit et al. 1995). Agar gel precipitation can be used for IBV identification, however, it possesses lower sensitivity in comparison to other assays (De Wit et al. 1992). Enzyme immunoassays are quick, inexpensive, and sensitive assays, which are suitable for screening large number of samples, IBV diagnosis, and serotype identification as well (Naqi 1990; Ignjatovic and McWaters 1991; Cavanagh et al. 1992a; Karaca and Syed 1993).",

Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) using MAbs are successfully used in serotyping IBV strains (Ignjatovic and McWaters 1991). The limitations of MAb analysis for IBV serotype definition are the lack of availability of MAbs or hybridomas and the need to produce new MAbs with appropriate specificity to keep pace with the ever-growing number of emerging IBV-variant serotypes (Karaca et al. 1992). There is a good correlation between the S1 sequence results and the VN serotyping (OIE 2013). The emergence of vast majority of the strains circulated worldwide (Jackwood 2012) renders serotyping impossible in many cases, and hence genotyping methods replaced HI and VN typing of IBV strains. Restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis of the S1 gene following RT-PCR amplification has been used to identify IBV serotypes (Lin et al. 1991; Kwon et al. 1993). Identification of IBV serotype is also conducted using serotype-specific S1 gene primer. Despite the success of both RFLP and serotype-specific RT-PCR, RFLP-derived restriction patterns of some IBV serotypes may be difficult to distinguish from others. Furthermore, samples containing mixture of more than one serotype may be difficult to be differentiated (Keeler et al. 1998). On the other hand, a mutation at a specific primer site or at an endonuclease recognition site may result in false negative in both RT-PCR and RFLP techniques. Direct sequencing of the S1 gene provides the ability to rapidly identify field strains including unrecognized variant virus serotypes (Kingham et al. 2000; Kusters et al. 1989).",

Cross immunity tests (CIT) in experimental birds have been performed (Lambrechts et al. 1993; Darbyshire 1985, 1980); the use of tracheal organ cultures (TOCs) from IBV-immunized birds was also suggested (Darbyshire 1980) and used successfully (Hinze et al. 1991). Since IBV has a tropism for epithelial cells of the respiratory tract, kidney, oviduct, and gut of chickens, IBV vaccines are evaluated on the basis of protection afforded at the level of the trachea (McMartin 1993), the kidneys for nephropathogenic IBV (Lambrechts et al. 1993), and the oviduct level (Dhinakar Raj and Jones 1996).",

The test may be conducted using the constant serum-diluted virus or diluted virus content serum method (Gelb 1989). VN is highly specific and highly sensitive; it is rarely used because it is too expensive and time-consuming. HI test detects antibody earlier than NV and could be used for serology (Kaufhold et al. 1988; Gough and Alexander 1979, 1977). AGPT is proved to be specific but with poor sensitivity (De Wit et al. 1997). ELISA is used on a more frequent basis to measure IBV antibody (Garcia and Bankowski 1981; Marquardt et al. 1981; Soula and Moreau 1981; Snyder et al. 1985). Among the advantages of ELISA are the increased sensitivity and specificity (Garcia and Bankowski 1981; Marquardt et al. 1981; De Wit et al. 1997) and the automation of the ELISA steps and calculations (Snyder et al. 1983a, b).",

Live vaccines are frequently attenuated by serial passage in embryonated chicken eggs (Klieve and Cumming 1988); however, extensive passage should be avoided to prevent the reduction in immunogenicity. There is an evidence that some attenuated vaccines showed increased in virulence after back passage in chickens (Hopkins and Yoder 1986). Vaccination is conducted by drinking water or coarse spray at 1 day or within the first week of age. Live vaccination of 1-day-old chicks induced a rapid decline in maternally derived antibodies due to binding and partial neutralization of vaccine viruses (Mondal and Naqi 2001). Booster vaccination is carried out 2\u20133 weeks after the first vaccination (Cavanagh 2003). The vaccine is administered individually by eyedrop, intratracheal, or intranasal route. Mass application by coarse spray, aerosol, and drinking water is used. In case of drinking water, removal of sanitizers and the incorporation of 1:4000 skim milk help to stabilize the vaccine titer during vaccination (Gentry and Braune 1972). Live attenuated IBV with NDV is used frequently; however, if excess IBV component is present, IBV may interfere with the NDV response (Thornton and Muskett 1975). Most of the commercially available live attenuated vaccines are derived from Massachusetts-based M41 serotype and the Dutch H52 and H120 strains, although some strains with regional impact have been introduced in different parts of the world in addition to Mass serotype (Lee et al. 2010; Bande et al. 2015). In the USA, strains belong to Connecticut, and Arkansas serotypes are used, whereas other serotypes like DE072 are used regionally. In some parts of Europe, D274, D1466, 4/91, and QX are used. In Australia, strains B and C subtypes are used (Klieve and Cumming 1988). In Egypt, MASS + CONN and 4/91 live attenuated vaccines and D274/M41 inactivated are used (Abdel-Moneim et al. 2006). In China, LDT3-A and QX live vaccines are used (Feng et al. 2015). Limitations of live attenuated vaccines include reversion to virulence, tissue damage, and interference by MDA. H52 and H120 IBV vaccines have been found to induce considerable pathology in the trachea (Bijlenga et al. 2004; Zhang et al. 2010). Potential recombination between vaccine strains and virulent field strains may lead to the emergence of new IBV serotypes (Lee et al. 2010; McKinley et al. 2008).",
