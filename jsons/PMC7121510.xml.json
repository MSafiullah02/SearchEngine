The clue to the viral etiology would be based on the presence of viral cytopathic changes with nuclear inclusions in case of the HSV and ground-glass nuclei in the influenza virus. These findings could be present in the background of diffuse alveolar damage (DAD), and recognizing the viral etiology or other etiologies in general is important in the treatment of these cases.

The main two entities of this pattern are DAD which is the majority of cases of ARDS. The idiopathic variant of DAD is acute interstitial pneumonia (AIP) or Hamman-Rich disease. The other entity is bronchiolitis obliterans/organizing pneumonia (BOOP) with its idiopathic variant called cryptogenic organizing pneumonia (COP) [2].

            "text": "The biopsy from a patient with DAD shares many similarities with those from BOOP. However, certain points need to be understood to recognize the difference between these two entities:DAD is a combination of an epithelial injury as well as endothelial injury. As such, the endothelial injury will result in leakage from the small vessels and the formation of intravascular thrombi, and plasma proteins will be present in the alveolar spaces. When the degeneration and necrosis by-products mix with the fibrin from the plasma proteins, they form a slurry-like material that paints the alveolar lining layer as what we recognize as the hyaline membrane (Fig. 4.4a, b\n). The latter makes gas diffusion more difficult than even in BOOP. For this and other reasons, patients with DAD usually require mechanical ventilation and have worse prognosis than those with BOOP [8].\nThe presence of intravascular thrombi in larger vessels could lead to areas of lung infarctions. These could ultimately result in the squamous metaplasia with atypia. These areas could include abnormal mitotic figures and areas of necrosis. It is very important to be very cautious in interpreting fine needle aspiration material or bronchoalveolar lavages (BALs) from patients suspected of having DAD or who are on ventilators. The metaplastic squamous epithelial cells along with the necrotic debris could lead to an erroneous diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma (Fig. 4.5a, b).\nMost patients with DAD get biopsied by the second week of presentation where the organizing phase is the predominant phase. However, some patients may be biopsied earlier. In the latter case, pulmonary edema and an eosinophilic material representing the leaked plasma proteins could be copiously present without the characteristic hyaline membrane or the areas of fibroblastic proliferation. Some authors called this \u201cacute fibrinous and organizing pneumonia\u201d (AFOP) [9]. Some investigators thought it belongs to a form of BOOP; others thought it represents an early phase of DAD (Fig. 4.6a, b). In practice the distinction is not important as the treatment would follow the patient\u2019s performance status and the picture would be of an acute lung injury pattern.\nThe idiopathic form of DAD is also a distinct entity called \u201cacute interstitial pneumonia\u201d (AIP) or Hamman-Rich disease after the two physicians who first described the disease occurring in relatively young patients and resulting in an accelerated course of respiratory failure and a characteristic form of fibrosis on autopsy.DAD could be superimposed on cases of usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP), and in that case it is called \u201caccelerated phase of UIP.\u201d If the patient has been previously diagnosed with UIP or there is a radiologic evidence of UIP as would be discussed later, the presence of a DAD picture along with the honeycomb changes in the lung would point to that diagnosis. If there are several biopsies from different lobes, one might show UIP without DAD [10].A subset of patients with AIP may come with a protracted history of respiratory symptoms that does require mechanical ventilation only to show histopathologic evidence of DAD on the biopsy.\n",

Plasma proteins leaking in the alveolar space assume a homogeneous eosinophilic material that shows scalloping near the alveolar walls. The D-PAS-positive globules are also absent by special stains. Another differential is with the frothy material seen in Pneumocystis jiroveci. The latter is an infection in immunocompromised patients and as such usually shows widening of the interalveolar septa, and the material is frothy rather than granular with no cholesterol clefts or D-PAS-positive globules.",
