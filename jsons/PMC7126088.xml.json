            "text": "The Vesiculovirus genus is one of the six genera of the rhabdovirus family. The prototype vesiculovirus is vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV). It is an arbovirus that can infect insects, cattle, horses and pigs. In mammals, its ability to preferentially infect and kill tumor cells makes it a promising oncolytic virus for the treatment of cancer [1], [2], [3]. Although VSV-associated disease is generally benign, other vesiculoviruses can be deadly to humans. This is the case for the Chandipura virus (CHAV), which is an emerging human pathogen associated with deadly encephalitis, principally affecting children in the tropical areas of India and which has, in recent years, caused several outbreaks with high mortality rates [4].",

            "text": "As all rhabdoviruses, vesiculoviruses are enveloped viruses having a rigid bullet shape with a flat base and a round tip. Their genome encodes five structural proteins including a single transmembrane glycoprotein (G). G is a type I membrane glycoprotein. After cleavage of the amino-terminal signal peptide, the mature glycoprotein is about 500 amino acids long (495 for VSV G). The bulk of the mass of G is located outside the viral membrane and constitutes the amino-terminal ectodomain. G is anchored in the membrane by a single \u03b1-helical transmembrane segment. The small intraviral domain is probably involved in interactions with internal proteins. G plays a critical role during the initial steps of virus infection [5]. First, it is responsible for virus attachment to specific receptors, which, in the case of VSV G, are the members of the low-density lipoprotein receptor family [6], [7]. After binding, virions enter the cell by a clathrin-mediated endocytic pathway [8], [9]. In the acidic environment of the endocytic vesicle, G triggers the fusion between the viral and endosomal membranes, which releases the genome in the cytosol for the subsequent steps of infection [5]. Fusion is catalyzed by a low-pH-induced large structural transition from a pre- to a post-fusion conformation which are both trimeric [10]. Remarkably, for rhabdoviruses, the structural transition is reversible [11], [12], [13], [14], and in fact, there is an equilibrium between different states of G, which is shifted toward the trimeric post-fusion conformation at low pH [5], [15].",

In fact, together with baculovirus gp64 [17], herpesviruses gB [18], [19], [20], [21] and thogotovirus Gp [22], rhabdovirus G defines the class III of fusion proteins [23]. VSV G is the only member of this class for which high-resolution structures of both the pre- and post-fusion states are available [24], [25]. Low-resolution electron microscopy (EM) structures of the putative pre-fusion state of HSV1 gB have been obtained [26], [27], but those structures have led to opposite interpretations concerning the orientation of the fusion domains (FDs) either pointing away or toward the anchoring membrane. Nevertheless, the localization of monoclonal antibodies binding sites [26] and spectroscopic characterization of functional fluorescent gB [28] are consistent with a model of pre-fusion gB similar to the pre-fusion VSV G crystal structure [25] (i.e., with the fusion loops pointing toward the anchoring membrane).",

Finally, we will discuss if this mode of operating is specific to Vesiculovirus glycoproteins. Particularly, we will review EM data indicating that the initial interaction between class II fusion glycoproteins and the target membrane is mediated by monomers and examine some non-trimeric structures of influenza hemagglutinin present in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) but whose oligomerization state and protomer conformation have never been discussed thoroughly before.",

In addition, the existence of a thermodynamic equilibrium between monomers and trimers of VSV G solubilized by octyl-glucoside was demonstrated [33]. This equilibrium was also demonstrated to exist in vivo\n[34], [35]. From those pioneering works, it was clear that VSV G trimer was much less stable than HA trimer, which was the best characterized viral fusion glycoprotein at that time [36].",

While the post-fusion trimer was the major species detected at low pH, the pre-fusion trimer was never detected in solution. Indeed, at high pH, Gth appeared to be a flexible monomer exploring a large conformational space and adopting more elongated conformations when pH decreases [37].",

Above pH 7, although few pre-fusion trimers are observed [38], the vast majority seems to be flexible monomers [37]. At intermediate pH (pH 6.7), the shape of the spikes was not homogeneous and several forms of G could be observed [37]. In some regions, G seemed to have kept its high pH organization. Some spikes also had the typical post-fusion shape. Some elongated monomeric rod-like shape structures could be distinguished. The sequential appearance of the different species when lowering the pH suggested that the monomers were intermediates during the conformational change [37]. Indeed, independent refolding of monomers before re-association to form the post-fusion trimer overcomes some topological problems encountered if G remains trimeric all along the structural transition [39].",

This movement is likely triggered by protonation of a cluster of histidines (H60, H162, and H407) (Fig. 1b), destabilizing the FD-R5 interaction in the pre-fusion state of the protomer [25]. The second feature is that the central helix elongates in two stages; in the LI, the helix is longer than in the pre-fusion protomer but shorter than in the post-fusion one. The third feature is that most of the structural transition occurs in a monomeric form and goes to an elongated hairpin-like conformation before trimerization.

In a single FD, residue 112 is located on the opposite side of the three-stranded \u03b2-sheet and is far from residues 121 and 123 (Fig. 2d). However, in the CHAV Gth crystal structure, H80, E112, D121and E123 are clustered on the same side of the intermolecular \u03b2-sheet [31] (Fig. 2c). This strongly suggests that the antiparallel association of the FDs observed in the crystal of CHAV Gth is functionally relevant and crucial for fusion.",

First, in the contact zone with the target membrane, they drive the formation of the initial fusion pore (Fig. 3b and c). The flat base of the bullet-shaped virions is the favored site for this process [38]. We suggest that flat assemblies involving antiparallel interactions between the FD \u03b2-sheet, similar to those described in the previous paragraph, are involved at this stage. Such an assembly, by exposing the fusion loops, is ideally suited to constitute the first bridge between the target membrane and the flat base of the viral particle (Fig. 3b). Several features should favor the formation of such intermediates specifically at the flat base of the virus, including the difference in membrane curvature (which is zero at the viral base), the lower density of viral glycoproteins [38] and maybe also distinct interactions with intraviral matrix proteins which may control G oligomeric status. Whether several such dimer-based assemblies cooperate to initiate the fusion process remains an open question. In addition, the fate of those oligomers at later stages of the fusion process is unknown.",

Indeed, several experiments have indicated that class II fusion glycoproteins are monomeric when they interact with the target membrane [66]. Cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) analysis revealed bridge-like densities between acidified virions and liposomes with dimensions consistent with those of extended monomers for Rift Valley fever virus [67], Uukuniemi virus (another phlebovirus) [68] and Sindbis virus (an alphavirus) [69]. In the latter case, the orientation of the fusion glycoprotein (E1) relative to the virus surface appeared to be variable. The bridge-like densities between the virus and target membrane were either normal or at a slant relative to the virus surface. As suggested by the authors, this flexibility might allow E1 to bind the target membrane at different distances and curvatures [69]. The stage of the refolding process at which trimerization occurs still remains a matter of debate. Indeed, different conclusions have been drawn depending on the virus and the experiments. Biochemical data have suggested that, for Semliki Forest virus (an alphavirus) and Dengue virus (a flavivirus), trimer formation is relatively rapid and precedes the folding back of the carboxy-terminal domain [49], [50], [51]. On the other hand, for tick-borne encephalitis virus (a flavivirus), it has been suggested that trimerization may occur at a late stage of the refolding process [66].",

            "text": "Second, in the case of class I fusion glycoproteins, which are trimeric in both their pre- and post-fusion states [16], it is well known that their ectodomains are often monomeric when expressed in the absence of the transmembrane domain. To obtain a stable trimeric pre-fusion structure, the C-terminal part of the ectodomain is fused to a trimerization motif, based either on the transcription factor GCN4, as in the case of coronavirus S [70], parainfluenza virus 5 F glycoproteins [71] and Hendra virus F glycoprotein [72], or the T4 fibritin motif, as in the case of respiratory syncytial virus fusion glycoprotein [73]. Even for influenza HA, the dogma of the stability of the trimeric state all along the structural transition could be called into question in view of the growing number of crystalline structures that do not display any threefold symmetry (PDB entry codes: 4EDA, 5A3I 5K9K, 5K9O and 5IBL) [74], [75], [76], [77] (Fig. 4\n). More remarkably, in those crystal structures, the monomer structure is quite different from the structure of HA protomer in the trimeric pre-fusion state (Fig. 4b). Particularly, the helix A is longer as part of the loop has initiated its transition toward a helical conformation (Fig. 4b). On the other hand, the helix B is shorter (Fig. 4b). The fact that several crystalline structures of distinct HA subtypes contain a monomeric conformation suggests that it cannot be only a crystallization artifact and that those monomers might be transient intermediates that are trapped during the crystallization process. All those monomeric structures have been obtained in complex with a Fab, which may also have contributed to their catching in the crystal. If those structures correspond to real intermediates, they suggest a refolding pathway for HA monomer in which helix A elongation progressively displaces the loop in the structure of the helix B until this loop reaches the position it occupies in the post-fusion structure of HA2.",

(b) From left to right: Overall structures of VSV Gth pre-fusion protomer, CHAV Gth EI (PDB code: 5MDM), CHAV Gth LI (PDB code: 5MDM) and CHAV Gth post-fusion protomer (PDB code: 4D6W). The major difference between the pre-fusion protomer and the EI is the movement of R5 (arrowhead 1). Then, the refolding of the hinge regions R2 and R3 between PHD and FD (arrowhead 2) together with the partial elongation of the central helix implying R4 allows for the transition to the LI state. At this stage, G is already in a hairpin conformation. The formation of the last amino-terminal turn of the central helix (arrowhead 3) and the refolding of R5 into the lateral helix (arrowhead 4) concomitantly with the final trimerization form the six-helix bundle organization and achieve the structural transition. All the structures are aligned on their TrD. The histidines of the cluster H60, H162 and H407 in the pre-fusion protomer are depicted in green sticks. A close-up view of the cluster is also represented. Color code: TrD is in red, PHD is in orange, FD is in yellow, segments R1 and R4 (indicated by thin gray arrows) are in blue, segments R2 and R3 are in green, and segment R5 and C-terminal segment (cter) are in pink. The residues in the fusion loops at the tip of the FD are in red sticks. The C-terminal segments which are linked to the transmembrane domain are depicted in dashed lines.

(a) At pH 7.5 in the absence of a target membrane, at the viral surface, there is an equilibrium between G pre-fusion trimer and flexible monomers [37], [38] mostly in an EI-like conformation having different orientations, thanks to the flexibility of the R5 segment [31]. (b) Lowering the pH below 7 progressively shifts the equilibrium toward more elongated monomers in an LI-like conformation [31], [37]. Some post-fusion trimers are already present on the lateral side of the virus. The flat base is a favorable site for the association of monomeric intermediates into flat antiparallel dimers, which insert their fusion loops in the target membrane. (c) Formation of the fusion pore. The number of oligomers involved at this stage and their exact organization around the fusion pore is not known. For convenience, on the scheme, the fusion pore has been placed at the center of the flat base. However, note that the membrane is strongly constrained at the edge of the base, a feature that might favor pore formation at this location. (d) The formation of the helical network of spikes in their post-fusion conformation on the lateral side of the virion drives the enlargement of the initial fusion pore leading to complete membrane merger. What happens to the dimers that were involved in the initiation of the fusion process is unknown. The simplest explanation is that the dimeric association is only transient and that the dimer dissociates upon protomers refolding to LI and final retrimerization.",
