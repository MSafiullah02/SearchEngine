            "text": "Porcine epidemic diarrhoea (PED) was first described in England in 1971, and its causative agent, porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus (PEDV), was identified in 1978 (Chen et al., 2014). PEDV causes anorexia, vomiting, diarrhoea and dehydration in pigs, resulting in near 100% mortality for piglets during the first few days of life (Hill et al., 2014) and low mortality in older pigs. The virus spreads via the faecal\u2013oral route, either through direct contact with an infected pig or through indirect contact with contaminated fomites. Widespread outbreaks were reported in Europe during the 1970s and 1990s, while epidemics in Asia have caused significant disruption to Asian pig production since 2008 (Williamson et al., 2013). Porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV, also known as swine deltacoronavirus, SDCV) was first identified in Hong Kong in 2012. The transmission modes and clinical signs due to PDCoV infections are similar to PEDV; however, the mortality rate is generally lower after PDCoV infections (Carvajal et al., 2015).",

These novel viruses rapidly disseminated throughout the US swine population, resulting in the mortality of an estimated seven million animals by May 2014 (Jung & Saif, 2015). Due to the faecal\u2013oral route of transmission, the infection spread through various mechanisms, including contaminated transportation vehicles (Lowe et al., 2014). In Canada, PEDV emerged in January 2014 when a swine herd in Ontario tested positive for the virus (Kochhar, 2014). Imported spray\u2010dried porcine plasma contaminated with PEDV was the likely pathway of introduction, as established through descriptive studies (Pasma, Furness, Alves, & Aubry, 2016), analytical epidemiological studies (Aubry, Thompson, Pasma, Furness, & Tataryn, 2017; O'Sullivan, 2015) and experimental investigations (Pasick et al., 2014). By July 2014, only 62 cases of PEDV had been reported in Ontario and the outbreak was largely under control (Pasma et al., 2016).",

At the provincial level, animal health regulations enabled consideration of PEDV and PDCoV as emerging hazards (Government of Ontario, 2009), which allowed a measured and appropriate response to the outbreak by the Ontario Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs (OMAFRA) via close collaboration with swine industry organizations.",

The DCP considered here has been voluntary in nature as defined elsewhere (Christensen, 2003). Furthermore, an important component of any disease control programme is measuring trends in incidence and prevalence, particularly when the disease of interest moves into the phase of possible elimination (Salman, 2003). With the infrastructure built for management of endemic diseases in Ontario, the data to support estimation of disease trends are available. Thus, the primary objective of this study was to estimate herd\u2010level incidence and prevalence measures for PEDV and PDCoV in swine herds in Ontario (Canada) between January 2014 and December 2016, based on industry data. The secondary objective was to describe relevant surveillance components that were used for identification of new PEDV cases.",

The data relevant for this work included unique identifiers, herd type, date of herd enrolment into the database, PEDV and PDCoV status of individual premises, and the date that individual premises changed their PEDV and PDCoV status. For inclusion into the study, swine herds could be of any herd type, but had to meet the following criteria: (i) be located in the Province of Ontario, (ii) participate in the voluntary industry\u2010led disease control programme and (iii) have diagnostic or epidemiological information about the infection status of porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus (PEDV) or porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV). The industry organization (i.e., OSHAB) provided relevant data to researchers for calculation of disease frequencies under a separate data transfer agreement.",

In rare instances where a herd's enrolment date was not specified or occurred later than the first reported case of PEDV or PDCoV for that herd, the disease status date was entered as the herd enrolment date for the purposes of this report. This was done so that herd\u2010level prevalence on a weekly basis could be properly calculated. An Open Database Connectivity (ODBC) connection to this database was established, and relevant tables were imported into R (R Core Team, 2016) using the rodbc library (Ripley & Lapsley, 2016).",

            "text": "The industry database maintained by OSHAB traces infection status of participating individual premises over time, which includes detection of infection, as well as any subsequent infection, elimination or other change in infection status with the associated dates. In this database, premises can have four possible values for their infection status, as defined below: (i) confirmed positive\u2014premises with herds that tested positive for PEDV/PDCoV based on laboratory test results from the Animal Health Laboratory (AHL) at the University of Guelph (Guelph, ON, Canada). For a premise to be classified as confirmed positive, it had to have an associated diagnostic submission number that includes at least one positive test for PEDV/PDCoV using RT\u2010PCR, regardless of the number of specimens that were submitted. An AHL reference number (also known as a G Number) was not available for some confirmed positive cases in the database, as the attending veterinarian obtained test results, but did not provide OSHAB with the AHL reference number; (ii) presumed positive\u2014premises which housed animals that were moved from positive sites at a prior stage in the production system (i.e., defined as positive due to pig movement). This information was obtained from attending veterinarians based on their knowledge of pig flow and movement, and was not based on diagnostic testing conducted on the premises of interest. For premises to be classified as presumed positive, the herd veterinarian simply needed to indicate that a specific site received pigs from PEDV/PDCoV\u2010positive sites; (iii) presumed negative\u2014previously positive premises, either confirmed or presumed, that were tested using PCR tests according to industry guidelines and had all test results negative. The sampling requirements for declaring premises to be PEDV/PDCoV presumed negative varied based on the combination of herd type and the type of animal flow (i.e., all\u2010in/all\u2010out by barn, or continuous flow nursery and finisher herds). Complete criteria were, at the time of publishing, available on the website of the industry organization (Ontario Swine Health Advisory Board, 2015). Briefly, sampling strategy for farrow\u2010wean, nursery and finisher sites aimed to detect prevalence of virus\u2010positive animals of at least 10%, with expected herd sensitivity of 95%, assumed test sensitivity of 98%, test specificity of 100%. In instances where the sampling material was oral fluid collected through cotton ropes, the assumption was that five pigs contributed oral fluids to one rope, and such fluids were considered a pooled sample. For farrow\u2010finish or farrow\u2010feeder sow sites, the same assumptions were made, except that the sampling strategy was required to detect prevalence of 5% with 95% herd sensitivity. Because of alternative strategies, the required sample size varied but a minimum sample size was four oral fluids. In addition, the testing time in sow herds was prescribed to be a minimum of 10 weeks post\u2010infection and was required to be repeated three times in the case of farrow\u2010wean (FW) sites, or two times in the case of farrow\u2010finish (FF) or farrow\u2010feeder (FG) sites. The recommended specimen type could be swab, Swiffer (for covering larger areas in a pen), or oral fluids, depending on the target age group. In FW herds, individual farrowing crates were the target population for each individual sampling occasion, in particular if diarrhoea was evident. The minimum recommendation for one sampling occasion in FW herds was to sample four Swiffer samples, at least eight farrowing crates per one sample. Alternatively, individual swabs of 30 farrowing crates were deemed as acceptable sample after pooling 5:1. In FG farms, the recommended sample type was oral fluid, with recommendation to collect 12 oral fluids from nursery pigs. Similarly, in FF farms, six oral fluids were recommended for collection from nursery pigs and six for collection from finisher pigs. For all\u2010in/all\u2010out nursery and finisher farms, the recommendation was to sample six oral fluids, with added requirement that these herds should be supplied from sow herds with a confirmed negative status. All testing has been assumed to be performed using RT\u2010PCR tests. Full description is available elsewhere (Ontario Swine Health Advisory Board (OSHAB), 2015); (iv) confirmed negative\u2014premises which have had no clinical signs or diagnostic evidence of PEDV/PDCoV for at least 6 months after the presumed negative status date. In addition, herds that were part of the Ontario voluntary DCP but were not tested for emerging porcine coronaviruses\u2014due to lack of clinical or other types of diagnostic or epidemiological triggers\u2014had assigned status of NA (not available).",

Briefly, during the 3\u2010year period (January 2014\u2013December 2016), AHL reported a total of 974 positive submissions for PEDV (Fairles, personal communication 2017). Of the 974 positive submissions, a cumulative total of 118 cases are reported in OMAFRA and OSHAB as new cases. The remaining 856 positive submissions were not part of any surveillance component considered in this study.

The remaining 19 cases (974\u2013856\u201399) are non\u2010primary PEDV\u2010positive cases (i.e., not the first outbreak in the associated production system); hence, they are captured in AHL and reported in the OSHAB voluntary DCP database, but not OMAFRA. Lastly, 52 PEDV\u2010positive cases are strictly in OSHAB and are not reported in any other surveillance component. It should be noted that these 52 cases are \u201cpresumed positive\u201d due to pig movement, and as such have no supporting AHL test result, an attribute which also makes them ineligible for OMAFRA reporting. The OSHAB total for PEDV cases is 52 + 19 + 70 = 141, which is also the cumulative number of incident cases over the 3\u2010year period.",

In the case of the Ontario outbreak, the regulatory framework existed at the provincial level because PEDV was considered an emerging hazard under the provincial Animal Health Act (Government of Ontario, 2009) and because of suspicion of feed involvement, which is under the jurisdiction of national veterinary authorities.

It contained a census of all PEDV cases, and all herds from the source population were eligible to be listed as a case, at least during the initial phase of the outbreak when PEDV could be considered an emerging hazard. However, only the first case in a given production system was counted as a case and secondary cases due to planned animal movement to other premises were not counted as additional cases. For example, if PEDV was detected in a sow herd in a multisite production system, the sow herd would be counted as a case, but not the nursery or finisher sites supplied from the sow herd. For this surveillance system, all cases had to have diagnostic confirmation through laboratory submissions. For this reason, the OMAFRA PEDV surveillance system is completely nested within the diagnostic laboratory. It is notable that ~17.1% of PEDV cases were identified through this surveillance system only, which is reflective of the reportable nature (provincially) of the emerging hazard.",

Current estimates of disease frequency support planning of disease elimination at the provincial level, but much information should be available about factors that led to time to elimination in individual herds. In addition, our evaluation of surveillance components indicates that the two surveillance components were complementary and focused on different aspects of surveillance. OMAFRA surveillance was mostly focused on identification of primary cases aimed at quick disease investigations and traceability in the face of the outbreak, whereas OSHAB surveillance has the added benefit of having sufficient data that allow long\u2010term evaluation of disease trends, long\u2010term disease management and tracing disease status of individual herds over time. The OSHAB voluntary DCP database also provides a good tool for calculating weekly prevalence and incidence measures, which is a valuable statistic for producers and animal health experts during all phases of disease outbreak and control.",
