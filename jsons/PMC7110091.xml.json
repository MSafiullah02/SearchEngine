Recent changes in the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists (ASHP) standards require that PGY2 resident applicants have completed a PGY1 residency program.6 Infectious diseases pharmacy residency educational outcomes, goals, and instructional objectives have also changed significantly since 1998, when the goals and objectives were last revised. These changes were based on expectations as to where infectious pharmacy practice is moving in the future and the Institute of Medicine report entitled Health Professions Education: A Bridge to Quality, which cited competencies that should be shared by all health care professionals.5",

The core competencies ensure that residents have adequate knowledge of infectious diseases and their treatment and can make patient-specific decisions using evidence-based therapeutic regimens and optimal dosing and can monitor the safety and efficacy of the selected treatment. Residents also develop leadership skills to make formulary decisions for antiinfectives, conduct research related to infectious diseases (including medication-use evaluations), educate other health care professionals on infectious disease topics, and serve as a preceptor to pharmacy students. The focus of the residency may be site specific and resident specific (e.g., outpatient versus inpatient care); however, all infectious diseases pharmacy residents attend rounds with an infectious diseases consultation service and provide services for their patients.",

Other learning experiences may include working in an ambulatory care AIDS clinic, a bone marrow transplantation service, an infection control service, an infectious diseases consultation service serving pediatric patients, an inpatient AIDS service, or a medical oncology and hematology service. In addition to direct patient care activities, infectious diseases pharmacy residents are required to maintain their knowledge of distributive functions by preparing and dispensing medication according to an arrangement with the residency program\u2019s institution.",

I also participated for a half-day each week in an outpatient infectious diseases ambulatory care clinic, working directly under the supervision of an attending physician and my residency director. During that time, I also participated in journal clubs, presented patient cases, delivered ACPE-accredited lectures to the pharmacy staff, and provided other lectures to infectious diseases attending physicians and fellows. Toward the end of my residency, I had the opportunity to work in the microbiology laboratory at Bay Pines Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Moffitt Cancer Center, where I received training related to infectious diseases in oncology, and Hillsborough County Health Department and Tampa General Hospital, where I was involved in the care of patient populations that were not usually seen at my primary site.
