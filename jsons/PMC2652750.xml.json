As a result of multicausality, the PAFs for multiple risk factors overlap, and cannot be combined by simple addition.

The cross-province correlation coefficient between solid-fuel use and smoking, from the data sources described in webappendix 1, was 0\u00b704 (95% CI \u22120\u00b732 to 0\u00b740, p=0\u00b782) for men and \u22120\u00b711 (\u22120\u00b745 to 0\u00b726, p=0\u00b756) for women, indicating small and non-significant correlation. We also examined individual-level correlation with the 2006 panel from The China Health and Nutrition Survey (a multistage, random cluster survey, including 9788 adults in nine provinces throughout China with significant variation in socioeconomic and health status).15 61% of men and 4% of women had ever smoked in homes that did not use solid fuels and 63% of men and 4% of women had ever smoked in homes that did. The odds ratios for smoking, comparing solid-fuel users to non-users, was 1\u00b707 (0\u00b795\u20131\u00b720) for men and 1\u00b702 (0\u00b776\u20131\u00b736) for women, showing uncorrelated exposures. The second condition is that the hazardous effects of one risk are not mediated through other risks. Smoking and solid-fuel combustion are both sources of respirable pollutants, but the effects of pollutants from one source are not mediated through exposure to the other. The third condition is that the proportional effects of one risk do not depend on exposure to the other risk factor. The proportional mortality study of smoking in China showed that the relative risks of lung cancer and respiratory-disease mortality among Chinese smokers were not modified by background disease levels,16 which is consistent with no effect modification of relative risks between these two risks.",

We introduced smoking and indoor air pollution into the model by stratifying the model population into the four possible combinations of exposure to these risk factors, proportional to their actual (time-varying) prevalence in each province. We fitted a time-varying transmission parameter, defined as the rate at which infectious individuals are able to infect people who are susceptible. Available data and previous modelling suggested that the transmission parameter declined almost linearly in England and Wales from about 20 in 1900 to about 1 at the end of the 20th century.19 We set the value of the transmission parameter to 20 in 1900, and it declined linearly to an empirically-fitted lower bound; the rate of decline and the lower bound were fitted to minimise the root mean square of the differences between the modelled and observed tuberculosis prevalence by province. The fitted lower bound, which determines tuberculosis incidence after 2000, was not sensitive to the initial transmission parameter in 1900. Model fitting also considered that chemotherapy was unavailable before 196020 and that the mean duration of disease is 2 years without treatment, 0\u00b78 years under effective DOTS (directly observed treatment, short course), and 1\u00b75 years for programmes other than effective DOTS.21 We applied the calibrated model to estimate future tuberculosis incidence under different scenarios of smoking, solid-fuel use, and DOTS coverage.",

All scenarios covered a period of 30 years (2003\u201333). We constructed prevalence of risk factors over time in the scenarios for each province with a linear time trend, and aggregated the provincial prevalences to the national level. More than 99% of the tobacco market share in China is controlled by the Chinese National Tobacco Corporation. Tobacco prices and taxes are low and there are only a few tobacco control measures in place.38 However, China ratified the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control in October 2005, which came into effect in January, 2006. Future smoking prevalence will largely depend on the extent to which economic and regulatory approaches to tobacco control are pursued. Although male and female smoking prevalences probably have common policy determinants, the analyses of lung cancer and chronic disease mortality were done separately for men and women and included all sex-specific scenarios. The analysis for tuberculosis was done for men and women combined because relative risks were for both sexes combined and because there are indirect effects of smoking on tuberculosis between sexes. National adult smoking prevalence was 49\u00b76% for men and 3\u00b70% for women in 2003 according to the National Health Service Survey. Another National Tobacco Prevalence Survey in 2002 reported current smoking prevalence of 57\u00b74% for men and 2\u00b76% for women. The two surveys had slightly different definitions of current smoking.22, 33 Tobacco consumption per person in China peaked around 1990 and has declined slowly since then.38 Data from three National Health Service Surveys (1993, 1998, 2003) show that smoking prevalence declined from 60\u00b73% to 49\u00b76% among men (standardised to the 2003 population); smoking in women declined from 4\u00b77% to 3\u00b70% in this period.",

China has implemented an ambitious programme to disseminate improved cooking stoves,54, 55 primarily to improve efficiency and reduce fuel use. The design and performance of the new stoves vary enormously, with many of the stoves lacking flues or other characteristics needed to reduce indoor air pollution.54 If alternative stove designs reduce exposure significantly, they can be treated as equivalent to fuel change; partial exposure reduction can be modelled with effect sizes between those for solid fuels and clean fuels.",

But tuberculosis incidence can decline significantly because treatment reduces the risk of infection through reducing the duration of infectiousness. Nonetheless, smoking and solid-fuel interventions should be components of tuberculosis control for at least three reasons. First, irrespective of coverage and effectiveness of DOTS, risk-factor interventions can further reduce incidence of tuberculosis. The complementary effects of risk-factor interventions occur through reducing the risk of latent infection and progression from latent infection to infectious disease. Second, reducing smoking in patients with tuberculosis might further strengthen DOTS effectiveness because smoking has been associated with delayed response to treatment.63 Third, reducing smoking may itself lower the risk of drug resistance as recent studies have suggested a link between smoking and drug-resistant tuberculosis.64, 65\n",

These analyses show that the largest source of uncertainty for the tuberculosis model is the future trend of transmission parameter, which depends on how sociodemographic change affects the patterns of contact and other determinants of transmission in China. If factors such as higher population density and increased travel increase the number of contacts that lead to tuberculosis transmission, the transmission parameter might not continue its expected decline. In this case, reducing smoking and indoor air pollution will have an even greater effect on tuberculosis control than estimated. For example, if the transmission parameter in Jiangsu doubles over the next 30 years, the benefits of the different scenarios of smoking, solid-fuel use would be 58\u201377% greater than the original analysis in figure 4. Multiparameter uncertainty analysis showed the interquartile range of the estimated effects was within 14\u201333% of its central value in all provinces and in all scenarios of DOTS, smoking, and solid-fuel use. Finally, the causal link between smoking and tuberculosis is based on a larger number of epidemiological studies than that of indoor air pollution from solid-fuel use. If the causal effect on tuberculosis were only from smoking, the benefits of reducing exposure would be smaller than those in figure 4, by 19\u201337% for different scenarios in Jiangsu, by 23\u201332% in Guizhou, and by 9\u201313% in Shanghai.",

In China, in 2003 passive smoking was responsible for an estimated 17 000 and 7000 deaths from COPD and lung cancer, respectively, among men (compared with 412 000 and 170 000 from direct smoking) and 126 000 and 25 000 deaths among women (compared with 113 000 and 16 000) because substantially more women are non-smokers and exposed to passive smoking33 (webappendix 2). The quantitative evidence on the effects of passive smoking on tuberculosis is more limited, although a causal effect is likely.5 Ambient urban air pollution, which in China might be partly due to household solid-fuel use, was responsible for an estimated 32 000 lung cancer deaths and 317 000 cardiopulmonary deaths in the Western Pacific region in 2000 (no independent effects on COPD were estimated for ambient urban air pollution) and selected occupational exposures for an estimated 34 000 lung cancer deaths and 161 000 COPD deaths in the same region.4 The effect of ambient air pollution on tuberculosis has not been investigated in epidemiological studies.",

            "text": "Infectious and chronic respiratory diseases, smoking, and indoor air pollution are either already concentrated or increasingly prevalent in developing countries. In addition to their disease burden, these diseases have large and inequitable household and societal economic burden associated with health-care costs, reduced labour-market participation, and decreased accumulation of human capital, described in detail elsewhere for China and for other developing countries.68, 69, 70, 71, 72 Our results show that reducing common risk factors could have a substantial effect on future burden of COPD and lung cancer, and be an important contributor to tuberculosis control. Our findings have several potential policy and programme implications at the national, community, household, or individual levels. At the national level, our results on the projected burden of disease from COPD and lung cancer alone reinforce the need for regulatory and economic policies that reduce smoking and promote clean household energy sources in China. Tuberculosis control however cannot rely on risk-factor reduction as its main intervention, and the core of national or regional tuberculosis control programmes should remain interventions that can reduce and eventually interrupt transmission under generalisable circumstances, currently DOTS. Nonetheless, at the community level, some interventions could increase the coverage or community effectiveness of others. For example, case detection and treatment completion under DOTS in China have been constrained by limitations of physical and human infrastructure, financial factors, and compliance, especially in rural areas and marginalised social groups.73, 74, 75, 76 Low-income or marginalised communities could be enrolled in programmes that provide cleaner fuels or stoves and nutritional supplements, conditional on periodic tuberculosis tests and DOTS treatment completion. At the individual level, tobacco cessation can be added to tuberculosis treatment, possibly with financial incentives.77, 78 If multiple interventions are implemented, the management structure of DOTS, including its standardised approach to registration, recording, and reporting of enrolled individuals (or households) and their status in receiving intervention, can strengthen planning and implementation of interventions for indoor air pollution and smoking.79 Tobacco taxes might also be used to subsidise DOTS, clean energy technology, and nutrition for low-income households that take part in integrated programmes. An important next step would be a policy dialogue between the different economic, energy, and health-sector agencies in China as well as community-based intervention studies that assess the effectiveness of combining risk factor interventions with tuberculosis case finding and treatment under actual conditions of implementation.",
