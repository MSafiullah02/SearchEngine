For risk assessment and clinical decision making, the rates of interest are the positive and negative predictive values of a test. Positive predictive value (PPV) is the chance that a person who tests positive has been infected. Negative predictive value (NPV) is the chance that someone who tests negative has not been infected. The medical literature regularly reports different statistics, sensitivity and specificity. Sensitivity is the chance that an infected person receives a positive test result. Specificity is the chance that a non-infected person receives a negative result. Knowledge of sensitivity and specificity permits one to predict the test result given a person's true infection status. These predictions are not directly relevant to risk assessment or clinical decisions, where one knows a test result and wants to predict whether a person has been infected. Given estimates of sensitivity and specificity, PPV and NPV can be derived if one knows the prevalence of the disease, the rate of illness in the population. There is considerable uncertainty about the prevalence of COVID-19. This paper addresses the problem of inference on the PPV and NPV of COVID-19 antibody tests given estimates of sensitivity and specificity and credible bounds on prevalence. I explain the methodological problem, show how to estimate bounds on PPV and NPV, and apply the findings to some tests authorized by the FDA.",

Application to COVID-19 Antibody Tests FDA (2020) reports estimates of sensitivity and specificity for antibody tests developed by twelve companies, each of which was granted an Emergency Use Authorization. It reports estimates of PPV-NPV under the assumption that the population infection rate equals 0.05. In most cases, the estimates of either or both of sensitivity and specificity are based on blood drawn from a small number of persons. I focus on three tests in which each of the samples used to estimate sensitivity and specificity had at least one hundred observations. Table 1 uses the sensitivity and specificity estimates in FDA (2020) to estimate bounds on PPV and NPV. The sensitivity and specificity estimates are plugged in for P(x = p|y = 1) and P(x = n|y = 0) in (2a)-(2b). The bounds are computed under the assumption that the prevalence P(y = 1) lies in the interval [0.017, 0.618] reported by Manski and Molinari (2020) for New York on April 24, 2020.",
