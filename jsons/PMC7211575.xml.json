Originating in Wuhan, China, it has spread internationally, resulting in the World Health Organization declaring it a pandemic on March 11, 2020 [2]. In the United States, difficulty in developing, distributing, and operationalizing SARS-CoV-2 testing is hindering our prevention efforts, resulting in the potential for widespread, undocumented infection. Since COVID-19 may result in influenza-like illness (ILI) [3], syndromic surveillance may assist investigations in the absence of laboratory-confirmed disease. In fact, syndromic surveillance efforts were proven useful during the 2003 outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) [4]. An enhanced understanding of COVID-19 syndromic surveillance can assist in driving evidence-based prevention efforts to lessen the impact of the pandemic. If undocumented cases of COVID-19 are present in the United States and individuals infected display an ILI syndrome, we hypothesized there may be a differential burden of ILI versus reported laboratory-confirmed influenza disease. The objective of this study was to use publicly available influenza surveillance data to investigate their utility for understanding potential undocumented COVID-19 in the United States.",

Data utilized included the weighted percentage of ILI, the total number of influenza diagnostics obtained, as well as confirmed influenza diagnostics from clinical and public health laboratories. Although the 2019/2020 influenza season was the focus of analysis, data were gathered from week 40, 2017 through week 12, 2020 to allow historical comparison during similar periods. Line charts were constructed to compare the burden of ILI versus positive influenza tests for each of the three seasons. R v3.6.2 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria) was used for all analyses. To ensure consistent updating of weeks after analyses ended, we created a free web application which scrapes the most recent influenza season data from FluView and re-creates the figures, on-demand with the most updated data.

Further, reporting may be delayed, or influenza testing may be limited due to supply constraints or other burdens of the COVID-19 pandemic. Here, we found a decrease in the number tested for influenza and evaluated for influenza like illness in the current year but not prior years. This could explain some of the discrepancy. This is also the very beginning of the outbreak in the United States, with only a limited number of weeks of potential transmission evaluated. The outbreak is too far in its infancy in the United States to validate our results. Further, if transmission were to be occurring in peak influenza season, it could be difficult to discriminate between influenza and non-influenza respiratory illness such as COVID-19, potentially impacting the utility of this syndromic approach. These data must all be taken under the consideration that we have never experienced a pandemic of this magnitude during a time when computational and data resources were as available as they are today in a highly globalized environment. Much like predictive models for COVID-19, all analyses may change rapidly due to the constant influx of new information.",

Attempting to understand transmission using syndromic surveillance efforts may allow for specific, data-driven allocation of needed resources to communities more vulnerable to severe COVID-19 or COVID-19-related mortality, particularly when laboratory confirmation is difficult or impossible. Organizations with available data should evaluate or share geolocation of testing to facilitate the identification of potential disease clusters.
