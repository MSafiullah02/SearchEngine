            "text": "Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) and Newcastle disease virus (NDV) are 2 of the most important viruses seriously affecting the poultry industry and causing huge economic losses worldwide (Bande et al., 2017; Brown and Bevins, 2017). IBV and NDV belong to the Gammacoronavirus of the Coronaviridae family and the Avulavirus of the Paramyxoviridae family, respectively (http://www.ictv.global). The genome of IBV is about 27.6kb in length. It encodes 15 non-structural proteins, and 4 structural proteins: spike glycoprotein (S), small membrane protein (E), membrane glycoprotein (M), and phosphorylated nucleocapsid protein (N). At the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 ends of the genome, there is an untranslated region (UTR) each (Armesto et al., 2009). NDV possesses a 15kb long genome comprising 6 genes which individually encode the nucleocapsid (N), matrix protein (M), phosphoprotein (P), fusion protein (F), hemagglutinin-neuraminidase protein (HN), and large polymerase protein (LP) (de Leeuw and Peeters, 1999). IBV and NDV both have high mutation rates, making their prevention and control difficult. Quick and accurate detection of IBV and NDV is important for preventing the viruses from spreading.",

            "text": "A wide variety of diagnostic assays for IBV and NDV have been developed, including virus isolation, and serological and molecular assays (Bande et al., 2016; Brown and Bevins, 2017). Costs, requirements of stringent techniques, and time required limit the use of virus isolation as a routine virus detection assay (Bande et al., 2016). Serological assays, such as hemagglutination inhibition and ELISA, are faster and simpler than virus isolation, but tend to lack specificity and sensitivity, especially in the case of IBV, and poor cross-reactions between serotypes makes serological tests less applicable (Cavanagh, 2007; Miller et al., 2010). In view of their high sensitivity, specificity, and reduced flow time, molecular assays are the most commonly used methods for IBV and NDV monitoring. According to previous studies, both IBV and NDV quantification RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) detection methods were highly specific, and the lowest detection limits were 102\u2013104 genome copies indicating that these qRT-PCR methods were highly sensitive (Callison et al., 2006; Farkas et al., 2009; Wise et al., 2004). Another highly specific and sensitive molecular method is nested RT-PCR (nRT-PCR) which involves 2 rounds of PCR amplifications. As previously reported, the lowest detection limits of IBV and NDV nRT-PCR assays were 101.9 and 104.0 EID50/mL, respectively (Nguyen et al., 2013). While PCR assays are widely applied in pathogen detection, the conduct of PCR requires sophisticated laboratory equipment and observation of PCR product requires electrophoresis, making PCR assays unsuitable for point-of-care and visible detections, especially in some low-resource regions.",

            "text": "Loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) amplifies DNA under isothermal conditions by the Bst DNA polymerase large fragment (Notomi et al., 2000). Numerous studies have demonstrated that the amplification efficiency of LAMP is quite high (Khan et al., 2017; Zhang et al., 2014). Moreover, the specificity of LAMP is also satisfactory as there are 4 specially designed primers recognizing 6 distinct regions on the target DNA (Asiello and Baeumner, 2011; Zhang et al., 2014). Furthermore, unlike conventional PCR assays, only simple devices are needed during LAMP, such as a water bath or a heat block. LAMP is thought to revolutionize molecular biology not only because of its excellent performance on DNA amplification but also due to its diverse, simple, and intuitional reaction monitoring methods. Several naked eye monitoring approaches have been applied, such as adding color indicators into reactions and combining with immunochromatographic techniques (Parida et al., 2008; Zhang et al., 2014). Lateral flow dipstick (LFD), an immunochromatographic technique, utilizes antibody capture followed by secondary antibody labeling (Chen et al., 2016; Zhang et al., 2014). LAMP combined with LFD (LAMP-LFD) could be used for highly sensitive, simple, visual, and multiple pathogen detections (Chen et al., 2016). LAMP products can be labeled by employing biotin/FITC modified FIP/BIP primers, and subsequently, these biotin-FITC double labeled LAMP products can be captured by biotin-antibodies and immobilized at specific locations on LFD strips (test line). Subsequently, FITC at the other end of the products can specifically combine with gold particles labeled with FITC-antibodies, thus making the results readable using the naked eye (Nimitphak et al., 2008). However, no previous studies have reported multiple detection of avian pathogens using LAMP-LFD.",

Studies have shown that multiple conventional RT-PCR could be used for detecting and differentiating respiratory disease pathogens in poultry diseases (Pang et al., 2002; Rashid et al., 2009). However, the sensitivity of multiple conventional RT-PCR is not satisfactory. Multiple nested RT-PCR is much more sensitive than multiple conventional RT-PCR but time-consuming (Nguyen et al., 2013). Furthermore, these assays are not suitable for on-site pathogen detection, because products of RT-PCR need to be monitored by electrophoresis and qRT-PCR need to be conducted with highly accurate instruments. Here, we developed a visual multiple RT-LAMP-LFD (mRT-LAMP-LFD) assay which could simultaneously detect IBV and NDV and be easily carried out and monitored by the naked eye. To evaluate this novel detection method, PCR assays (including conventional RT-PCR, qRT-PCR and nRT-PCR) and reverse-transcription LAMP (RT-LAMP) monitored by electrophoresis were also conducted and the specificity and sensitivity of the assays were compared with those of the mRT-LAMP-LFD assay.",

Subsequently, the fragments were separately ligated downstream T7 promoter. In vitro-transcriptions were conducted using HiScribe T7 High Yield RNA Synthesis Kit (NEB, Beijing, China). The concentrations of the RNA transcripts were measured using NANO DROP 2000 (Thermo, Shanghai, China), and the copy numbers of IBV and NDV RNA molecules were calculated following the formula reported previously (Fronhoffs et al., 2002). The copy numbers of IBV and NDV RNA molecules were 106.8 and 105.7 copies/\u03bcL, respectively.

After reverse transcription, 1 \u03bcL cDNA was used in the PCR and LAMP assays. Thus, the concentrations of serial diluted IBV and NDV RNA, which was finally used as templates, were separately 105.8 to 10\u22120.2 copies/reaction and 104.7 to 10\u22120.3 copies/reaction.",

            "text": "Timely and accurate diagnostic methods are very important for the control of infectious diseases, especially for IBV and NDV which are 2 of the most important contagious viruses seriously affecting the poultry industry. Furthermore, IBV and NDV produce clinical picture somewhat resembling each other, it is very much crucial not only to detect but also differentiate simultaneously. Existing IBV and NDV diagnostic methods, including virus isolation and PCR assays, are specific and sensitive. However, they are not suitable for timely on-site pathogen detection. Although portable PCR machines are gradually applied in the field, in most areas, especially in undeveloped and developing countries, these sophisticated equipments are too expensive to be popularized, and the sensitivity of PCR is not satisfactory. Multiple RT-LAMP-LFD developed in this study could detect and differentiate IBV and NDV, both simultaneously and accurately. When IBV and NDV cDNA co-exist in the same reaction system, an IBV and NDV double-positive result was observed. To evaluate the sensitivity of mRT-LAMP-LFD, conventional RT-PCR, nRT-PCR, qRT-PCR, and RT-LAMP assays detecting IBV or NDV alone were also conducted to compare with mRT-LAMP-LFD. When detecting IBV or NDV alone, mRT-LAMP-LFD performed as sensitive as nRT-PCR and RT-LAMP did, in a directly visual way. It is always thought that qRT-PCR methods provided high sensitivity during pathogen diagnoses. According to the result of detection limit study, nRT-PCR, and LAMP assays, established in this study, possessed 10 times higher sensitivity than qRT-PCR. In the first round of amplification of nRT-PCR, the original template was amplified with the outer primers. Thus, the number of the fragments containing the inner primer target sequence is greatly improved compared with the original template. As a result, the number of templates in the second round of amplification of nRT-PCR is much higher than that in qRT-PCR. This is the reason why nRT-PCR could detect lower concentration of original templates than qRT-PCR do. Similarly to our results, previous study conducted by Weng and Chen indicated that nPCR showed higher sensitivity than real-time PCR when detecting Phytophthora infestans (Khan et al., 2017). LAMP is one of the most widely used isothermal nucleic acid amplification techniques (INATs). Several studies on the diagnostic methods of other pathogens had showed that these INATs possessed equal or even higher sensitivities compared with qPCR assays (Gao et al., 2018; Khan et al., 2017; Yang et al., 2015). Our results indicated that LAMP assays possessed higher sensitivities than qPCR when detecting IBV and NDV (Figure 5).",

Previous studies on PCR methods detecting IBV and NDV showed that these PCR methods are specific and sensitive, but the need for expensive thermal cycling equipments makes them not suitable for on-site IBV and NDV detection. Portable PCR machines are gradually applied in the field. While, in most areas, especially in undeveloped and developing countries, these sophisticated equipments are too expensive to be popularized. Thus, simpler and visible IBV and NDV detecting methods are urgently needed. High specific and sensitive single IBV and NDV RT-LAMP assays have been developed in previous studies (Chen et al., 2010; Pham et al., 2005). In these assays, products were visualized by electrophoresis or by adding color indicators. When detecting multiple pathogens, the products must be easily differentiated. When visualized by electrophoresis, LAMP products could be distinguished by observing bands with different molecular weights, however, this method is not suitable for on-site pathogen detection. By adding color indicators, the change in color could be easily observed, but this change is non-specific. Obviously, these two LAMP monitoring methods are not applicable for on-site multiple pathogens detection. Multiple LAMP-LFD has been applied in the detection of some pathogens, and it showed great advances compared with common PCR and LAMP assays, such as the requirement for little equipment, short reaction time, and the ability to detect multiple genes or pathogens (Chen et al., 2016; Lalle et al., 2018). To our knowledge, RT-LAMP-LFD has not been applied to IBV or NDV detection and no studies on an mRT-LAMP-LFD technique that detects multiple avian respiratory viruses have been reported. In this study, the products generated in IBV and NDV RT-LAMP were differentiated by Biotin/FITC and Digoxigenin/FITC labeling, respectively. The products could bind with Biotin- or Digoxigenin-antibodies fixed on different test lines on the LFD strip, and then products were visualized by combining with gold particles modified with FITC-antibodies (Figure 1). When tested with clinical samples, the mean detection rate of mRT-LAMP-LFD was higher than that of the other assays. These results indicate that mRT-LAMP-LFD is not only able to detect IBV and NDV simultaneously, but is also suitable for field testing in both technical (more sensitive than PCR and LAMP assays) and practical aspects (more simple to put out and no specialized equipment needed).",
