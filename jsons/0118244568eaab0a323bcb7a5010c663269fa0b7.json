In this emergency situation related to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic infection, it was necessary to convert hospitals into dedicated structures to assist and treat COVID-19 patients in order to contain disease spreading, but also to guarantee adequate levels of assistance to other patients. In the current phase of emergency several strategies have been implemented such as postponing elective procedures, using telemedicine (when feasible), limiting points of entry to a facility, implementing source control for everyone entering the facility and screening everyone for COVID-19 symptoms before entering a facility [11] . However, if an endoscopy department has to be prepared to deal simultaneously with both COVID-19 positive and COVID-19 negative patients and to avoid infection transmission, an environment reconversion will be needed. Additionally, literature data regarding detailed schemes of endoscopy unit environment implementation and/or reallocation for a simultaneous management of both types of patients are limited. The aim of this manuscript is to share our model of fast reconversion of the endoscopy unit, which has been developed according to current scientific evidence and the recommendations of Scientific Societies, in order to safely manage both classes of patients.",

[12] , the areas in the endoscopy unit have been reclassified by means of a color coding system as \"green\" for low risk patients, \"yellow\" for intermediate risk patients and \"red\" for high-risk or confirmed COVID-19 patients (Fig. 1) . The color-coding strategy can allow patients and HWs to associate certain colors with specific areas or actions, with the goal to minimize the hazards of cross-contamination. This allows HWs to quickly and easily move around the facility, complete their tasks and find what they are looking for. The color-coding assignment lasts for the whole duration of the patient's visit, from arrival to discharge. Furthermore, the color-code we adopted refers to the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) and Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) safety color coding system that all businesses must adhere to, as a safety program requires the implementation of colors that quickly identify and draw attention to potential safety hazards. Red is the most well recognized sign for hazards. Red is also used to highlight areas of specific protective equipment. Yellow denotes caution. Yellow can be used with black checkers or stripes to draw attention to the hazard. Green is used to signify safe areas of a workplace [13] . After risk stratification, patients receive a color code based on their COVID-19 risk and are assigned to the respective code-color areas. These include a green waiting room with dedicated bathroom, a green recovery room, two green endoscopic suites for low risk patients, a yellow and a red waiting room and a yellow and a red recovery room with dedicated bathrooms. By contrast, to avoid too complex tasks for HWs, a single red color code has been assigned to the endoscopic room where intermediate, high risk and COVID-19 patients undergo endoscopic procedures, although a specific and risk based workflow sequence has been defined as strategy protocol, as described below. A consistent wall and door marking color system has been used to easily allow employees and patients to associate certain colors with certain areas or actions. According to this system (Table 1 , Fig.2 ), each patient's color has a specific waiting room, recovery room, but also a dedicated bathroom. All spaces are also organized respecting the internal requirements for spatial distance and hygiene rules. Alcohol based hand sanitizer for hand hygiene is available at each entrance and in all common areas.",

            "text": "Outpatients with a planned endoscopic procedure will receive a questionnaire for COVID-19 risk assessment by a phone call from a HW one day before the procedure, as advised by the European Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ESGE) [11] . Additionally, a checkpoint, serving as a triage station, has been set up outside the entrance of the endoscopic unit with dedicated staff, with the aim of screening patients before they enter the endoscopy facilities. (Fig. 2) The personnel should have a supply of facemasks and tissues for patients with symptoms of respiratory infection and should carry out again a screening questionnaire for COVID-19 risk assessment for all patients and any caregiver. The checkpoint consists of a specific desk delimited by floor marker tape and is equipped with a plastic transparent shield. It is supplied with equipment such as gloves, surgical masks, hydroalcoholic solution and items of disposable stationery. In any case, the external checkpoint must allow adequate contact distance guaranteed by access restriction and specific signs. Thanks to the screening questionnaire, patients and caregivers (in case of outpatients) are assigned to a COVID-19 risk class ( Fig. 1 ) characterized by a color code (green, yellow, red), which will allow the patient to be allocated to the waiting area corresponding to the color code of his risk class. Checkpoint staff will hand over the color-coded card to the nurse of the recovery room before allowing patient access to the endoscopy unit. Signs are posted at entrances with instructions to individuals with symptoms of respiratory infection to: immediately put on a mask and keep it on during their assessment, cover their mouth/nose when coughing or sneezing, use and dispose of tissues, and perform hand hygiene after contact with respiratory secretions. Facemasks are provided to coughing patients and other symptomatic individuals upon entry to the facility. Signs are posted in triage areas advising patients with fever or symptoms of respiratory infection to immediately notify triage personnel, so that appropriate precautions can be put in place.",

So, we estimated the possible head excursion (about 35cm) during both the aforementioned procedures; in fact, while in both types of procedure the patient's head could be in left lateral or supine decubitus, during colonoscopy a right lateral decubitus may sometimes be necessary (Fig. 4 A-B) .

Table 2 shows the suggested changes and Figure 6 depicts the new layout of our endoscopy unit. Practically, our department reconversion requested a few markers, tapes and signals, two technicians and two multidisciplinary meetings before the set-up, which, in our experience, took no more than 3 hours. The use of these signals and markers could avoid mistakes that could lead to the diffusion of the infection in each step of the permanence of both patients and HWs in the endoscopy unit.

Since a color-coding system has been shown to be effective in some industrial environments to identify hazard zones, it could also be useful in the current need for a rapid reorganization of endoscopic departments because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Such a model could contribute to minimizing the risk of contamination and reduce or eliminate wasted time by allowing a fast adherence to new protocols and tasks. Indeed, this operating procedure establishes and identifies the use of colors, signs and signals which should allow for quick recognition of information and hazards in the various work areas. A color code system together with the implementation of new areas and the use of clear visual markers allows a speedy visual search, emphasizes information, shows associations with specific actions and transmits important messages. Furthermore, our method has been shown to be easy to implement, cheap and fast. ",
