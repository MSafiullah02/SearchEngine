The formula can be used as a powerful forecasting tool. The parameters of the theory are the transmission rate, reflecting the viral fitness and \"normal\" frequency of contacts in the infected areas, and the intensity of prevention measures. The duration of the period of intensive growth is essentially inversely proportional to the square root of the intensity of hard measures. A more precise formula is based on Bessel functions. The data for the USA, UK, Sweden, Israel are provided.",

We model the effects of momentum management of epidemics , which can be defined as a system of measures of any nature aimed at reducing the epidemic spread by regulating the intensity of these measures on the basis of the latest absolute or average total numbers of infections. The usage of the absolute numbers combined with \"hard measures\", such as detection and prompt isolation of infected people and closing the places where the spread is the most likely, ensures a relatively fast saturation. This is not the end of the spread of the virus, but then the growth of the total number of infections becomes essentially linear and mild assuming that the measures are in place. According to the complete theory, the relatively short first period of exponential growth is followed by the period of essentially quadratic growth for Covid-19, which reasonably quickly becomes linear upon the aggressive protection measures, and then evolves toward the saturation. Our approach is of behavioral and sociological nature; the fact that it provides such a surprising accuracy seems a real discovery.",

Our restriction to the period till April 15, 2020 with fixing the parameters a, c, except for Sweden, is not accidental. It was sufficient for the practical confirmations of the theory presented in Figures 2,3 , and with other countries. The latest data, the black dots, provide the \"realtime checks\"; they were obtained after the parameters were fixed. The pandemic is far from over, but within the scope of this paper, the data we needed for the \"forecasting tool\" were essentially present by 04/15. When the epidemic approaches the saturation, which is the first maximum of u(t) in our model, its management can be expected to evolve toward reducing and abandoning \"hard\" measure. This can result in a growth like Ct c/2 with some \"mild\" C and c/2 \u2248 1 and significant fluctuations, which really happens. Such growth at the end is generally covered by our theory; it is not connected with Bessel functions.",

With (3), the constant response is needed to new clusters of the disease, some jumps with the new cases due to the reductions of the measures and so on.
