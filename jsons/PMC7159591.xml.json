Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) is the major reason for diarrhea in sucklings and weanlings, leading to excessive loss of fluids and electrolytes, resulting in profuse diarrhea, usually without histological lesions (Wilson & Francis 1986; Francis 2002). Infections caused by Coronavirus (Porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus, PEDV; Mole 2013) are among the other diseases causing diarrhea and vomiting in this breed of piglets. Inflammation caused by ETEC may be effectively inhibited by the application of suitable immunomodulatory agents demonstrated in numerous experimental studies of piglets (Shirkey et al. 2006; Tohno et al. 2006; Walsh et al. 2008; Mizumachi et al. 2009; Chytilov\u00e1 et al. 2013). Diet supplementation with probiotics has been shown to: (i) reduce the frequency of post\u2010weaning diarrhea (Manner & Spieler 1997); (ii) play an important role in the intestinal barrier against inflammatory bowel disease (Laukoetter et al. 2008); and (iii) improve growth performance (Scheuermann 1993) in piglets.",

The experimental animals were housed in stainless steel cages fitted with a slatted floor strewn with \u00be insulating rubber and ambient temperature of 20\u201322\u00b0C. The animals were divided into two groups: control C (n = 18, control cheese, sprinkle on the surface of feed) and LF group (n = 18, probiotic cheeses + crushed flaxseed). Throughout the study, the animals were fed diets mixed for early weaning of piglets O\u0160\u201002 (Spi\u0161sk\u00e9 Vlachy, Slovak Republic; Table 1) and had ad libitum access to water. The feed mixture was supplemented with crushed flaxseed (cultivar Flanders, AGRITEC, Czech Republic) as a source of PUFAs at a concentration of 10%. The fatty acid composition (percentage) of flaxseed was as follows: lipids (dry matter (DM) basis) \u2013 45.78; palmitic FA (C16:0) \u2013 5.1; stearic FA (C18:0) \u2013 3.7; oleic FA (C18:1) \u2013 18.4; linoleic FA (C18:2) \u2013 16.1; linolenic FA (C18:3) \u2013 56.8. In the period starting 10 days before weaning and lasting up to 14 days post\u2010weaning, the experimental piglets in group LF were supplied with probiotic cheeses at a dose of 4 g/animal/day for each cheese, and in the same period the feed of group LF was supplemented with crushed flaxseed. Piglets in control group C were supplied control cheese at a dose of 8 g/animal/day.",

They may inhibit procarcinogen enzymes and the ability of pathogens to colonize and infect the gut mucosa (Gill 2003). Probiotic microorganisms act against infections of the gastrointestinal tract by means of their own production of bioactive molecules, such as organic acids, carbon dioxide, hydrogen peroxide, other low molecular weight substances and bacteriocins (Gomes et al. 2012). Probiotics are able to displace pathogens such as Salmonella spp., Clostridium spp. and E. coli in the gastrointestinal tract of pigs through the mechanism of competitive inhibition for binding sites (Biernasiak et al. 2011).",

LDH catalyses the intraconversion of pyruvate and lactate and is involved in both the catabolism and anabolism of carbohydrates. In addition to metabolic roles in the cells, it includes a number of other biological processes (Powers et al. 1991). The function of specific indicators is performed by LDH isoenzymes, which allow us to identify the damage to cells and tissues by different agents. LDH leakage from various cells (e.g. hepatocytes, monocytes, lymphocytes) into the environment is used as one of the markers of cytotoxicity for monitoring tissue and cell damage in in vitro conditions (Kopperschl\u00e4ger and Kirchberrger 1996; \u0160utiakov\u00e1 et al. 2004).
