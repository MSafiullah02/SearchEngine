            "text": "Coronaviruses are important pathogens that mostly cause respiratory and enteric diseases. The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) is a newly identified human coronavirus that differs from all previously known human coronaviruses. Its approximately 30 kb genome is the largest among RNA viruses and encodes 19 non-structural and 4 structural proteins. The structural proteins include the spike (S), nucleocapsid (N), membrane (M) and small envelope (E) proteins. The S protein is a large membrane protein that induces neutralizing antibodies. The N protein, which is thought to participate in the replication and transcription of viral RNA, is also highly immunogenic and induces a strong antibody response. The transmembrane M protein is the most abundant glycoprotein, while the E protein is an integral membrane protein. The viral envelope is embedded with the S, M, and E proteins and surrounds a helical nucleocapsid consisting of viral RNA and the N protein [1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6]. All are immunogenic and should induce an immune response after infection.",

The assays included reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) to detect nucleic acid as well as immunological assays to detect the N antigen and antibodies against SARS-CoV proteins. Diagnostic techniques were chosen based on time, availability of equipment, expertise, and the biological nature of the available samples. Although the detection of N antigen and RNA is very useful for early diagnosis of SARS-CoV infection, antibody detection has been widely used for diagnostic and epidemiological purposes. Therefore, the immunological assays for detection of antibodies were developed in-house and some of them are available commercially. However, the antigens used in these assays differed. Some used inactivated whole virus while others used recombinant polypeptides, even synthesized peptides. Antibodies against different viral proteins or even antigen fragments may be induced. At present, the significance of each antibody in the diagnosis, course, and prognosis of SARS is not absolutely clear. The kinetics of each antibody response and the correlation between the presence of a single antibody and antibodies against the entire virus is also unknown.",

The results indicated that most of the expressed proteins reacted to the convalescent plasma. To our surprise, SARS N protein exhibited low antigenic activity while the activities of N1 and N2 protein, as the fragments of the whole N protein, were better. The following reasons should explain this phenomenon. Firstly, as was described in Section 2, the SARS N protein were purified with complicated poly-stepped purification methods, this may result in the change of N protein structure or property. Next, since it was expressed in E. coli, perhaps SARS whole N protein could not form its natural structure and the antigen conformational epitopes may be exposed after the protein is fragmented. Moreover, the entire SARS N protein reacted to part of negative samples, too, which revealed there may be cross-reaction between SARS and non-SARS plasma. The same result was reported by Mimoun etc. [10]. Probably there were some antigen epitopes similar to conservative N protein in some human tissue antigen or other undetected pathogen.",
