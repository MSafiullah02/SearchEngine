Officials in countries with a low incidence of smallpox were particularly alarmed by the morbidity and mortality associated with postvaccination encephalitis and encephalopathy. While central nervous system (CNS) adverse reactions were generally considered idiosyncratic events, the incidence seemed to vary by strain of vaccinia. This observation was eventually substantiated when the Marennikova group of the Viral Pharmaceutical Institute in Russia published animal data that characterized over 20 commonly used strains of vaccinia and showed a correlation between the degree of pathogenicity and viral replication in CNS and other tissues [1], [2]. According to the 1969 Marennikova report, the Ikeda strain of vaccinia was classified as having high pathogenicity, whereas the Lister strain used by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the UK National Health Service (NHS) was rated as having medium pathogenicity, and the New York City Board of Health strain (NYCBH, also manufactured under the trade name Dryvax\u00ae) used in the US was rated as having low pathogenicity.",

Although clearly not neurotoxic in nonclinical studies and nonreactive in both normal and dermatologically- or immune-compromised hosts, antibody response following single vaccination was poor [2], [11].

[12], had been developed in the US in the early 1930s through repeated passage of the NYCBH strain in rabbit testes, CEE, and chorioallantoic membranes (CAM) [2], [13], [14]. The attenuated CVI-78 strain (CVI after 78 passages), developed by Kempe et al. at the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research in the late 1940s, was ultimately selected for development based on the mild dermatologic reactions it produced in rabbit and human studies [14]. Similar results were seen during numerous clinical studies where only mild local reactogenicity and fevers without serious adverse reactions were observed [3], [13], [14]. Additionally, CVI-78 appeared to offer a major advantage for dermatologically compromised individuals as Kempe et al. confirmed the safety of this vaccine in children with eczema [14]. Nevertheless, two critical findings dampened enthusiasm for the CVI-78 vaccine. First, the neurotoxicity of CVI-78 following intracerebral inoculation of monkeys was shown to exceed that of the unattenuated Ikeda, Lister, and NYCBH strains, suggesting a greater human risk for encephalitis with CVI-78 [15]. Second, it was found that the immune response to CVI-78, particularly the neutralizing antibody response, was low when compared to unattenuated Lister or Ikeda strains, calling into question the protective efficacy of this vaccine [2], [16], [17].",

Deletion of B5R generally results in decreased production of EEV [34], which is critical for cell-to-cell transmission of virus within the infected host and plays an important role in disease pathogenesis [34], [35]. B5R is also a target for neutralizing antibodies [36], and anti-B5R antibodies have been shown to protect mice against lethal infection [37]. Yet recent lethal poxvirus challenge studies in rabbits and mice [33], [38] demonstrated that a deletion in the B5R gene does not diminish LC16m8's efficacy or its ability to induce EEV antibodies. A primate study [39] also suggested that the B5R protein is not critical for smallpox vaccine efficacy. Hooper et al. were able to show that a Dryvax-vaccinated monkey with no detectable B5R-specific neutralizing antibodies could survive a lethal monkeypox virus challenge. The serum of this particular monkey was able to neutralize monkeypox and the vv-Connaught vaccine strain (derived from the NYCBH strain) in PRNT assays. It is possible that the protection conferred by LC16m8 is B5R-independent and other EEV surface proteins may serve as epitopes for neutralizing antibodies [37], [39], [40]. There is also evidence that smallpox vaccines induce cell-mediated immunity (CMI) [41], [42], [43], [44], [45], [46]. Hence it is possible that neutralizing epitopes on the truncated B5R protein might contribute to the overall protective immune response without being the primary mediator. LC16m8-induced CMI responses are currently being investigated and the results should provide important information regarding the extent and longevity of immune responses to LC16m8 compared with that of other vaccines.",

This plaque-size heterogeneity can be mapped to the B5R gene where some variants exhibit point mutations upstream of the known B5R single-base deletion. These compensatory mutations correct the observed frameshift and lead to the reconstitution of a full-length B5R gene. Western blot analysis has confirmed a restored ability of these variants to produce a full-length B5R protein. In a severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) mouse LD50 study, the pathogenicity of two revertant viruses and the LC16mO precursor strain was similar. In addition, plaque-purified LC16m8 and a construct of LC16m8 lacking the B5R gene were shown to have safety profiles comparable to that of MVA in the same animal models and to confer protective immunity in a mouse/intranasal vaccinia (Western Reserve [WR] strain) challenge study [47].",

These included basic antibody and T-cell assays and monitoring of cutaneous responses to primary vaccination with LC16m8 [4]. However, current standards for determining vaccinia efficacy rely on more sophisticated measurements of humoral and CMI responses as well as lethal poxvirus challenges in vaccinated animal models [41], [42], [67], [68]. One example of the latter is the lethal rabbitpox virus (RPXV) in rabbits, which mimics smallpox infection in humans [69] since it is rapidly and widely disseminated, is highly infectious, and produces high levels of EEV. The latter appears to play a prominent role in the pathogenesis of both RPXV and variola [34], [70], making the RPXV challenge model particularly suitable for testing the EEV-neutralizing capability of LC16m8. Hence, the protective efficacy of LC16m8 was recently evaluated in the rabbit model using a RPXV challenge [38].",

Common reactions to Dryvax include fever, lymphadenopathy, and lymphadenitis, while more serious adverse events include auto/contact inoculation, generalized vaccinia, eczema vaccinatum, progressive vaccinia, and encephalitis [77].
