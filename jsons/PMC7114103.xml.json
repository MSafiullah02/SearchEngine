Considering the complicated nature of TCHM, experiments in laboratory animals have been considered the \u201cgold standard\u201d for pharmacological screening. The process is very important for medical evaluation, because it reflects the efficacy, side effects, and toxicity of medicines as a whole. In general, TCHM whole extracts are often tested first for their ability to protect animals against viral challenges (Fig. 2\n). However, such in vivo methods are costly and have low throughput. For TCHM testing, optimized cell-based assays are often carried out directly for the initial evaluation of whole extracts that show clinical evidence of antiviral activity. This practice is based on the assumption that compounds with direct antiviral activity are present in whole TCHM extracts. These compounds are measured by their ability to protect cells against virus-induced cytotoxicity (Fig. 2).",

In recent years, with improved understanding of viral replication mechanisms at the cellular and molecular level, highly specific assays with high-throughput capabilities have been developed (Fig. 3\n). These assays enhance the chances of success of AGF and provide data for understanding the mechanisms of action of the identified compounds.",

In the past, databases were scattered among individual laboratories, and included an insufficient number of compounds and limited associated information. However, several larger databases have recently been constructed. The TCM Database@Taiwan (http://tcm.cmu.edu.tw), built by a team led by Prof. Calvin Yu-Chian Chen from China Medical University in Taiwan contains the chemical structures of over 20,000 compounds (Chen, 2011). Using this database, the team has identified quinic acid, genipin, syringic acid, cucurbitine, fagarine, methyl isoferulate and their derivatives as potent anti-influenza compounds, through blocking of the viral M2 ion channel (Lin et al., 2011). Using the same approach, they also identified xynopine-2, rosmaricine-14 and rosmaricine-15 as strong antagonists of the binding of hemagglutinin subtype H1 to sialic acid (Chang et al., 2011b).",

The composition of the sugar units and the diversity of the linkage chemistry are also factors that determine the functional properties and the target specificity of these compounds. Thus, while polysaccharides are considered to be broad-spectrum virus entry inhibitors, their derivatives display significant levels of virus-specific activity (Zhou and Meng, 1997).

            "text": "As host cell invaders, viruses must escape the immune response to survive. Host innate and adaptive responses against viral infection and replication oppose viral strategies (escaping and blocking) against the host immune response. An excessive reaction of the host immune response may also lead to tissue damage and multi-organ injury (Ferrero-Miliani et al., 2007, La Gruta et al., 2007), which in turn may cause related diseases. TCHMs that enhance host antiviral immune responses or block viral immune escape mechanisms therefore display antiviral activity through immunoregulatory mechanisms.",

The project for \u201cSupporting the Development of TCM\u201d stipulates that \u201cthe protection, research, and rational utilization of Chinese materia medica resources, and establishment of quality evaluation and standardization system\u201d has the highest priority in terms of government support (http://www.news.cn, 2011). This initiative shows a determination to solve the bottleneck of underdeveloped Chinese materia medica. Thus, based on the Plan, it is expected that TCM-based medical systems will be greatly enhanced through increased funding for basic research and improved education. This government support will undoubtedly result in advanced phytochemistry, assay development, and bioinformatics, which will in turn provide platform technologies and tools for the modernization and commercialization of TCM.",
