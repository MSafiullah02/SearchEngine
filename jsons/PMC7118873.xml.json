Each room was tested with visible smoke for directional airflow into the patient room (ie, negative air pressure relative to adjacent areas). Inappropriate outward airflow was observed in 38% of the isolation rooms tested. These findings indicate that a balanced ventilation system does not guarantee inward airflow direction.

A 2003 report from the CDC demonstrated that a cluster of SARS cases among health care workers in a hospital occurred despite apparent compliance with recommended infection-control precautions. In fact, hospitals, because of infection of health care workers, appeared to be sites of SARS epidemic amplification during the epidemic of 2002 to 20037; therefore, HEPA filtration and ultraviolet germicidal irradiation are recommended as additional infection control measures.4\n",

During planning, we determined that placement of exhaust outlets above the roof level was impractical for our ground floor conversion.
