            "text": "At fi rst blush, an outbreak of mouse hepatitis virus or epizootic diarrhea of infant mice virus in a research colony of laboratory mice may not seem like a \"disaster.\" However, irrespective of magnitude, such an outbreak at an academic institution is disruptive for researchers at all levels. It can be a disaster for the graduate student who may have just a few experiments to fi nish before writing the thesis or for the postdoctoral fellow who is in the lab for only 1 or 2 years. Infectious disease outbreaks also limit the ability of principal investigators to share their animals with collaborators at their home institution as well as with those at extramural sites, thereby thwarting the expectation that research materials supported by federal funds will be made readily available to colleagues. This article traces the evolution of a change in \"culture\" at a large, well-funded academic institution with over 1,800 active IACUC protocols, more than 1,000 of which include mice. During a period of less than 5 years, the institution evolved from virtual paralysis in the face of such outbreaks to the implementation of policies and practices that enable effective outbreak management and the timely resumption of research functionality. This evolution required not only support from the highest levels of leadership in the university and its school of medicine but also a huge outlay of fi nancial resources.",

Although the name suggests a single agent, it is actually a group of viruses that, due to their RNA genomes and high mutation rates, comprise multiple strains. Although MHV does not cause clinical signs in most mice, it can induce functional defects in the immune system and interfere with tumor biology and many other types of studies (see Barthold and Smith 2007 for a review). There are two basic, partly overlapping biotypes: (1) respiratory and (2) enterotropic/enterotropic-polytropic; the latter is the one most frequently detected in contemporary laboratory mouse colonies and is transmitted via the fecal-oral route (Barthold and Smith 2007) .",

Breeding must be suspended (males and females separated) and neonates euthanized to minimize the number of new susceptible animals introduced into the population. For the same reason, shipments of mice from outside sources (approved vendors) destined for quarantined rooms are cancelled if at all possible; there is a central ULAR procurement offi ce through which all animal orders are placed, so this process is relatively easy to control.

The waiting time for rodent imports was frequently in excess of 6 months from the date of approval of health reports (necessitating, of course, updated health reports prior to receipt of the mice). Most investigators needed to import only one or two breeding pairs of mice, so the capacity of the large isolators was frequently wasted. Since the purchase of 45 \"mini-isolators\" (each accommodating four shoe box cages) and electrical upgrades, there have been no waiting lists for routine importations from nonapproved sources.",

Two weeks after detection of the fi rst positive sentinels, testing of all remaining sentinels (cage mates of the previously tested Q2 sentinel mice) in the facility revealed three additional MHV-seropositive sentinels in the room with positive colony (nonsentinel) mice, resulting in the depopulation of the room. The second sentinel-positive room in the suite was depopulated at the end of July after the detection of seropositive colony mice earlier in the month. Remarkably, there was no indication of spread beyond these fi rst two rooms. But because some investigators had mice in both rooms in the positive suite as well as in a room in another suite, colony mice in the second suite room were tested despite the fact that sentinels had been MHV seronegative. The sequence of testing and the serology results for this second suite are shown in Table 1. ULAR leadership met with investigators housing mice in the positive room of the second suite to discuss the SOM policy and encourage the affected SVM investigators to implement it. The policy was to depopulate a room if a third round (which at that point had been exceeded) of testing detected positive cages after two sequential rounds of a testand-cull approach failed. The investigators opted to depopulate by a combination of euthanasia and shipment to an off-campus site for rederivation. New sentinel mice were ordered for the entire facility and underwent monthly serological monitoring for MHV until the next scheduled quarterly testing. No further positive mice were detected and the facility remained MHV negative until it was depopulated for the commissioning of a newly constructed facility during the fi rst quarter of 2007. ",

The plan was to move all of his mice (except those in the satellite facility) into two rooms in a suite of one of the barrier facilities. SOM and ULAR policies dictate that mice cannot be relocated from a conventional to a barrier facility without transitioning through the quarantine facility for rodents from nonapproved sources. However, the quarantine facility could not accommodate the number of Dr. Brown's cages (approximately 700) in the two Building A (conventional) rooms (536 and 537). Therefore, ULAR leadership, in consultation with the SOMARC, devised a plan to facilitate the consolidation without the need for quarantine. In addition to extensive testing for fur mites and pinworms, one mouse from each of the 700 cages underwent serological testing (no known immunodefi cient mice were involved) for the viral agents that were considered high risk at the institution and/or were excluded from the destination barrier facility: MHV, EDIM virus, and mouse parvovirus. Testing in the conventional rooms revealed one MHV-positive cage in room 536 and eight in room 537. After an independent laboratory's confi rmatory testing of these samples along with those of all cage mates, the positive cages were culled. Mice from all of the cages in both rooms were tested serologically for MHV two additional times at 3-to 4-week intervals and no further positive cages were detected. (Screening of all Dr. Brown's cages in the satellite and two barrier facilities showed that they were negative.) Table 3 provides a summary spreadsheet (derived from a much more detailed one) that helped immensely in tracking the progress of infection in each room involved in this extensive outbreak.",

Theoretically, perimeter entry can be tracked electronically but, in practice, records are cumbersome and time-consuming to access. Despite advocacy for improved vivarium security, specifi cally the installation of biometrics, retrofi tting new systems to older facilities has proven too challenging. As a result it is diffi cult to learn who has entered facilities and at what times. In addition, it is impossible to track entry into individual rooms as these are largely either unlocked or on hard key systems. There has been a strong push to install modern security and tracking systems in newly constructed facilities, but new construction always seems to run over budget and enhancements like fi ngerprint readers or iris-recognition scans are \"value engineered\" out of the projects, despite the fact that they have greatly reduced the potential for abuse inherent to black keys, magnetic cards, and hard keys, all of which are easily transferable from person to person.",

However, the impetus for such action lags as the memory of the consequences of an outbreak fades. Perhaps the next MHV or EDIM virus outbreak will revive the discussion and spur some action\u2026.",

This practice has been observed even during pinworm outbreaks.

University administrators who control budgets, particularly special capital outlays, may or may not have experience and/or knowledge in the area of animal-based research. At the University of Pennsylvania we are fortunate to have had an administra-tion with both the knowledge base and the resolve to commit resources that improved the animal care and use program in a relatively short period of time. There are certainly improvements that can be made as we move forward, but we are far better off than 5 years ago.",

This prevented a predictable exodus of mice after quarantine was imposed. Night and weekend access was severely restricted and required justifi cation to and approval by the chair of the SOMARC and associate director of ULAR Diagnostic Services.Access to a quarantined room was restricted to husbandry 2.personnel and a single representative (usually the laboratory manager) from each laboratory housing mice in the room. This was signifi cant as some laboratories have huge numbers of personnel (one affected lab had 29 preand postdoctoral researchers plus technical staff). In many cases, laboratory staff did not need to manipulate 3.their mice but needed information on cage cards to make decisions about culling animals or needed to see the condition of mice in their cages. In those cases, ULAR permitted the use of digital cameras to photograph cage cards or mice so that multiple staff members didn't have to enter the quarantined rooms. ",
