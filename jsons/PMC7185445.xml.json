            "text": "Data for clinical characteristics of MERS are scant because of the small number of cases detected since appearance of the virus 15 months ago. Clinical information from individual or cluster case reports is recorded by the Program for Monitoring Emerging Diseases (ProMED) and is summarised through updates6, 7, 8, 9, 10 from WHO, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC). Data suggest that MERS presents primarily with respiratory symptoms and that most patients with serious disease have either other medical comorbid disorders or immunosuppression. Case reports of family clusters and hospital outbreaks in Saudi Arabia,11, 12, 13 and other countries in the Middle East and Europe,14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20 also indicate that individuals with MERS-CoV can present with a range of respiratory and non-respiratory symptoms, with many manifestations of clinical disease. Furthermore, recent case reports from Saudi Arabia11, 12, 13, the UK,15, 16 France,17 Germany,18, 19, 20 Italy,21 and Tunisia22 suggest that mild respiratory illness might be part of a wider clinical spectrum of MERS-CoV infection. Two patients from Tunisia9, 22 and one from the UK16 had mild respiratory illnesses and they did not need to be admitted. Furthermore, initial presentations of MERS-CoV disease might not include respiratory symptoms initially.12, 13 The first patient reported from France17 of MERS-CoV infection presented initially with diarrhoea and abdominal pain and subsequently developed respiratory symptoms.",

            "text": "In Saudi Arabia, the first case of MERS-CoV infection occurred in June, 2012 (reported in September, 2012). Two main reporting periods subsequently became apparent. The first was the early period from June, 2012, until April 1, 2013, during which time nine cases were recorded in residents of central and western Saudi Arabia (Bishah, Al Qassim, and Riyadh; figure 2\n). These cases were predominantly male (90%), occurred sporadically, and included two small family clusters in Riyadh. In one family cluster,12 the index case resided in an extended household of 28 males and females, including 18 children. Secondary cases arose in two sons, and a grandson also became infected. During this first reporting period, no ill health was identified or reported among health-care workers; thus, transmission potential of MERS-CoV in the community seems low. In the second period, from April 1, 2013, to July 14, 2013, almost all cases arose in the eastern province of Saudi Arabia (Al-Hasa) and were associated mainly with transmission in hospitals, including three cases among family contacts and two cases in health-care workers.13 The rise in the number of MERS-CoV cases detected in Saudi Arabia during the second reporting period might not reflect increased transmission but rather could be attributable to augmented case detection as a result of enhanced screening and surveillance activities. Dissemination of information on MERS-CoV by the Saudi Ministry of Health has raised awareness among health-care providers and the public, leading to an increase in reports of suspected MERS-CoV cases, from 168 in April, 2013, to 524 in May, 2013 (currently about 70 reports daily, on average).",

Pneumonia was an incidental finding on chest radiography and he subsequently developed severe respiratory disease, from which he died. A second case of MERS-CoV infection was diagnosed subsequently at the same hospital in a patient on long-term steroid treatment. The respiratory presentation of the index case suggests transmission in the hospital room shared by both patients. However, infectiousness of faeces (because the index case presented with diarrhoea) at an early stage due to cross-contamination cannot be ruled out.",

First, patients were self-selected because of referral to hospital and being screened actively for MERS-CoV by nature of their serious clinical condition. Second, we did a retrospective study of clinical case records. Third, case record entry was not done uniformly. Fourth, comorbidity data were unavailable for admissions without MERS-CoV infection and from the community population. Finally, follow-up data after discharge were missing. Despite these limitations, we have been able to delineate further the epidemiological, demographic, and clinical characteristics of 47 Saudi patients with MERS-CoV infection. The main findings of our study are that most patients present with serious respiratory disease, need to be admitted to hospital, and 60% of them die. Adults of both sexes are affected, at a mean age of 56 years (range 14\u201394). A quarter of patients had accompanying gastrointestinal symptoms, including diarrhoea and vomiting, and many cases occurred in individuals with chronic underlying comorbid medical disorders. Half of all patients had two medical comorbidities: diabetes and chronic renal disease. A study from Saudi Arabia showed that more than 50% of Saudi people older than 50 years have diabetes.26 However, the large number of people with MERS-CoV infection and chronic renal disease might have been biased by the Al-Hasa hospital outbreak, which happened in the renal unit. Further case-control studies are needed to define the effect of comorbidities on susceptibility to, and associated mortality from, MERS-CoV infection.",

This classification precludes identification of the full range of clinical presentations and misses asymptomatic, subclinical, and mild cases. Furthermore, since the first case report from Saudi Arabia, in September, 2012, the Ministry of Health has recommended mandatory testing for MERS-CoV of all cases of respiratory illness requiring admission to intensive care. This directive has biased selection and detection of more severe cases of MERS-CoV infection and might have skewed the observed high case-fatality rates. Clinical symptoms, laboratory investigations, and imaging findings of MERS-CoV are similar to those noted in other community-acquired respiratory-tract infections. For example, imaging features of MERS generally resemble those seen in patients with community-acquired pneumonia. Progression from unilateral focal air-space opacities to multifocal or bilateral involvement was frequent in patients admitted to the intensive-care unit with MERS pneumonia. The radiographic appearance of MERS lung disease shares common features with pneumonia of other causes.",

On the basis of our findings, the clinical features of MERS-CoV disease bear some resemblance to those seen in patients with disease caused by SARS-CoV. In patients with MERS, fever, cough, and dyspnoea are the major symptoms in those admitted to hospital. Other common presenting symptoms include chills, rigor, headache, myalgia, and malaise. Although respiratory failure is a major clinical feature, mild disease and atypical presentation with diarrhoea have been reported in cases of MERS and SARS. Common laboratory features of SARS32, 33, 34 recorded on admission include infiltrates on chest radiographs and lymphopenia, whereas thrombocytopenia and raised amounts of lactate dehydrogenase and alanine aminotransferase have been noted in some cases. Although our data show similarities in clinical presentation between cases of MERS and SARS, some important differences are also present (table 6\n).",

The basic reproduction number (R0; ie, the number of secondary cases every index patient is expected to infect in a fully susceptible population) of MERS-CoV is 0\u00b769 in the worst-case scenario and 0\u00b760 in a more optimistic scenario. These researchers concluded that MERS-CoV does not yet have pandemic potential, which would occur if R0 reached 1. Breban and colleagues' analysis shows that the chance of MERS-CoV having an R0 greater than 1 is very small. Data to assess any changes in incidence of admissions or mortality due to pneumonia are not available in the WHO Eastern Mediterranean region. Overall, as yet, evidence is scant throughout this WHO region to support the possibility of either transmission of MERS-CoV from asymptomatic infected individuals or ongoing, low prevalence, mildly symptomatic illness in the community.",

We are searching vigorously for the source of MERS-CoV in animal hosts and other potential reservoirs and for transmission routes to individuals. Active surveillance, achieving early detection, rapid diagnosis, and isolation of MERS cases has been in place in Saudi Arabia to achieve early control of the virus. The likelihood that MERS will follow a path similar to that of SARS remains unlikely. The virus has been circulating for 15 months without reaching a form capable of causing a pandemic. Proactive surveillance for severe acute respiratory illness caused by MERS-CoV is ongoing across Saudi Arabia. As of July 14, 2013, more than 3000 respiratory-tract samples had been tested for the presence of MERS-CoV at the Saudi Ministry of Health reference laboratory in Jeddah. WHO's definition of a probable case of MERS-CoV infection5 includes individuals with severe acute respiratory illness with no known cause and with an epidemiological link to a confirmed case. Until the transmission characteristics of MERS-CoV are better understood,34 patients under investigation, and probable and confirmed cases of infection, should be managed in health-care facilities with standard contact and droplets precautions. As information becomes available, these recommendations will be re-evaluated and updated as needed.",

            "text": "Our study was not designed to ascertain prognostic predictive values. The ability of clinical, laboratory, and other features to distinguish MERS-CoV from other respiratory-tract infections will need appropriately controlled studies with large numbers of patients. In the SARS epidemic, all laboratory variables (apart from absolute neutrophil counts) distinguished SARS poorly from other causes of community-acquired pneumonia. The comparatively few cases of MERS-CoV disease identified to date restricts the certainty of any comparison of epidemiological, demographic, and clinical features. Our study brings to light major knowledge gaps and a range of unanswered questions on the epidemiology, natural history, clinical presentation, course of disease, optimum management, and eventual control of MERS-CoV infection (panel 1\n). The source of infection, predisposing factors for susceptibility, and predictive factors for poor outcome remain unknown and need further investigation. Case-control and community studies are also needed to define accurately the clinical range of disease caused by MERS-CoV. Early recognition and rapid initiation of infection-control precautions are currently the most important strategies for controlling nosocomial MERS-CoV infections. At the moment, no tests are available to rule out MERS among patients with febrile respiratory illnesses, and development of a range of rapid and accurate diagnostic tests is needed urgently.39 With availability of improved laboratory methods,40 important questions about transmission, risk factors, clinical course, and natural history of MERS-CoV infection need to be addressed at once (panel 2\n).Panel 1Key knowledge gaps and research priorities\nEpidemiology\n\n1)What is the origin and the natural reservoir for MERS-CoV?*\n2)What is the source of MERS-CoV exposure and infection acquired outside health-care facilities: in the household or the community (animals, foodstuff, water, sewage, other)?*\n3)What is the range of genetic diversity among MERS-CoV isolates, their evolution, and importance?4)What is the full range of clinical expression of MERS-CoV disease in the community (asymptomatic carriage to mild, moderate, and severe disease)?

We searched PubMed and ProMED websites on June 15, 2013, for all relevant English language publications with the terms \u201cMERS-CoV\u201d, \u201cnovel coronavirus\u201d, \u201cMiddle East\u201d, and \u201cHCoV-EMC\u201d. We included all reports from Saudi Arabia.2, 11, 12, 13 Data for MERS-CoV infections from other countries (reported on ProMED, in CDC reports, by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control and by the UK's Health Protection Agency [now Public Health England], and in PubMed) were also reviewed.\nInterpretation\nIn our previous reports of 27 cases from Saudi Arabia we presented selected limited data on patients' demographics, symptoms before presentation, comorbidities, and laboratory data. We now show in a series of 47 cases, including the previous 27, more detailed analysis of patients' demographics, age range and sex-related prevalence and mortality, full range of symptoms and comorbidities at presentation, and the number of comorbidities related to mortality. Scant information is available about the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of MERS-CoV infections, and limited data come from individual, family, and hospital case reports. We present the largest case series to date of MERS-CoV infections and provide further information on demographic, clinical, epidemiological, and laboratory features of patients. In individuals admitted with medical comorbidities of MERS, a wide range of clinical manifestations can be seen, and they are associated with substantial mortality. We have identified major knowledge gaps in the source, community prevalence, clinical spectrum, laboratory features, and epidemiology of MERS-CoV infections. Further definition of the clinical and epidemiological range of MERS in the community is a priority and needs multidisciplinary research.",

Two further asymptomatic cases have been recorded among female health-care workers in the eastern region and Al-Hasa.
