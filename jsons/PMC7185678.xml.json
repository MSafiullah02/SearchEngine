There are many methods for waste management, such as landfill [1], aerobic and anaerobic digestion [2], mechanical and biological treatments [3], pyrolysis [4], gasification [5] and incineration [6]. In densely populated areas like Taiwan, finding space for additional landfills is becoming difficult. Beginning in the 1990s, however, alternative waste treatment technologies have become widely available. For instance, incineration functions as an alternative to landfill and biological treatment methods such as composting process and anaerobic digestion.",

Over the decades, the economic improvement has led to the increasing amount of MSW, causing serious environmental harms such as air quality deterioration and river water pollution. In order to speed up nation\u2019s MSW treatment and resources recycling, the Taiwan government has formulated policies concerning the reduction of waste volume in recent years. In correspondence, since 1990 the TEPA has devised the construction of a number of MSW incinerators to solve the MSW problem. By 2007, Taiwan has 22 MSW incineration refuse plants in operation. The volume of MSW materials and the treatment rate by incineration in 2006 are 7,336,496 tons and 53.34%, respectively, [9].",

For instance, during the incineration process, most of the heavy metals react with oxygen and chlorine to form metallic compounds which have low boiling point. The cooling process then leads to the condensation of high volatility metallic vapors through both homogeneous nucleation and heterogeneous condensation on the surface of fly ash, therefore discharging toxic metals from MSW incinerator [6], [11]. Nonetheless, pollutants produced by incinerators can be reduced by using air pollution control devices (APCDs).",

For instance, SOx and NOx react with other substances in the air to form acids, and precipitate in the forms of rain, fog, snow, or dry particles. The incinerator generates NOx in two ways: (1) N2 and O2 in air will react during the high temperature incineration process, producing NOx (called as thermal NOx); (2) nitrogen compounds found in either fuel or MSW are oxidized to form NOx (also called as fuel NOx) [29]. SOx are generated during the combustion of sulfur or materials containing sulfur [6]. Generally, CO is generated by the incomplete combustion of any fuel containing carbon compounds. It can easily react with the hemoglobin in blood and prevent oxygen transfer; people who expose to high concentration of CO may have health risk [30]. According to the statistical data from TEPA, the composition of MSW in Taiwan was including moisture, plastic, kitchen garbage, paper, metal and so on [9] (see Table 2\n). Most chlorine presents in the plastic and kitchen waste will be released in incineration process and react with hydrogen to form HCl. HCl and some organic compounds are the precursors of dioxins in MSW incinerators [31], [32]. Fluorine that presents in the MSW may also react with hydrogen to form HF. However, according to previous study [33], the concentration of HF emitted from MSW incinerator is 0.1 mg/m3. The concentration of HF emitted is too low compared with HCl (\u223c16 mg/m3).",

The advantages of using catalyst in incineration are: it is easy to operate, requires no secondary treatment, and takes less space than traditional APCDs [44]. For catalyst oxidation, studies reported that Fe2O3/TiO2, Pt/Al2O3, and V2O5/TiO2 are generally used as catalyst for the dioxins oxidation [45], [46]. V2O5-WO3/TiO2-based catalysts are highly effective, reducing NOx and decomposing dioxins at low temperatures (150 \u00b0C) by 95% and 98%, respectively.",

Basically, the composition of MSW can be divided into two parts; one is combustible waste, including paper, fiber, rubber, kitchen waste, and plastic; and the other is noncombustible waste like metal, glass and moisture. Table 5\ndescribes the breakdown of the MSW composition in Taiwan and the basic chemical analysis of waste in recent years. The statistical data collected from 1998 to 2005 shows the chemical analysis of MSW, which is mainly composed of moisture, ash, basic elements (C, H, O, N, and S), and organic chlorine. The main component of MSW is moisture, followed by carbon as shown in Table 5. According to data on the chemical analysis of MSW between the period of 1998 and 2005, Table 5 shows a decreasing trend in the proportion of ash and organic chlorine, and an increasing percentage of sulfur in MSW composition. In the meantime, other composition items presented in Table 5 indicate a stable trend. The trends show that people in Taiwan have become more concerned with the clearance of MSW and placed more importance on resource recycling. For instance, while the percentage of the combustible waste increased annually, the percentage of noncombustible waste became less owing to the separate collection of particular categories of waste from MSW over the years. The statistical data presented in Table 5 suggest the success of Taiwan\u2019s policies in promoting resource recycling.",

            "text": "After the construction of the first incinerator in 1991, incineration began to be a trend in the treatment of MSW in Taiwan gradually. As shown in Table 1, until October 2006, approximately 53.34% of MSW was treated by incineration, while resource recycling and landfill accounted for 27.34% and 11.66%, respectively. The rate of incineration and resource recycling in MSW treatment increased significantly from 1991 to 2004. Contrary, the rate of landfill decreased significantly and now only accounts for a small fraction of MSW treatment in Taiwan. This phenomenon indicates that incineration had been considered as the main treatment method for MSW in Taiwan at the present. The data depicted in Table 3 describes the rate of garbage disposal, which increased from 60.2% to 99.75% in the period of 1991 to October 2006. As we can see, the rate of landfill from 1991 to 2006 (including both general landfill and sanitary landfill) decreased significantly due to the construction and operation of incinerators. Compared with landfill, incineration takes less space, provides faster treatment of MSW, materials, and is more efficient than landfill. Therefore, incineration can be considered as the best alternative to landfill for a densely populated country like Taiwan. However, in addition to waste treatment techniques, factors like government policies, public\u2019s level of environmental awareness, and resource recycling (including resource recycling, waste bulk recycling, and wastes food recycling) will also play an important role in the future treatment of MSW.",

Since it was difficult for Taiwan to find space for additional landfill sites, the TEPA decided to look for an alternative in waste treatment in order to meet the urgent need of Taiwan. As a result, the TEPA decided in 1986 to adopt incineration as the primary method for waste treatment and landfill as secondary. Consequently, in 1990, the TEPA proposed a plan called \u201cConstruction Project for MSW Resource Recovery Plants [51]\u201d for MSW treatment. The TEPA first planned to construct 21 large scales MSW incinerators, and 20 incinerators had been constructed as a result. In the second step, the operation of these incinerators were divided into two types, namely state-own-operate type and state-own-private operate type. In 1996, another plan was proposed to encourage both public and private enterprises to built additionally 15 large scale MSW incinerators in either BOO (build-operate-own) or BOT (build-operate-transfer) type incinerators. However, due to the reduction of MSW generation and the opposition of local residents and the public, Taiwan government decided to construct only 4 incinerators (2 incinerators are constructed and 2 incinerators are under construction) as opposed to 15 incinerators. At the moment there are 22 MSW incinerators in operation, including 20 state-own type incinerators, 1 BOT type incinerator and 1 BOO type incinerator. The total design capacity of these incinerators is 23,250 tons per day, which is more than the current national MSW generated of approximately 20,100 tons per day [49].",

Fig. 2\nshows the trend of heavy metals emitted from each incinerator in Taiwan during 2002\u20132006. Due to the improvement of flue gas treatment instrument/technique and the policy of resource recovery, all incinerators met the regulations of TEPA in heavy metal emission. Many studies have indicated that conventional air pollution control devices such as bag house, wet, semi-dry, and dry scrubber also can effective in collecting metallic particulates. As the improvement of instruments, the emission of heavy metals should be reduced gradually by year. Further, Metallic materials such as waste metal containers, and waste dry cell batteries commonly exist in MSW. Before incineration, separating these metallic materials from MSW can reduce the concentration of metals in flue gas. Therefore, this led the emission of heavy metals decreased. The average concentration of heavy metals decreased from 2002 to 2006. It demonstrates that the control of heavy metals emitted from incinerators in Taiwan improved every year.",

In the past, the SCR technology was used for DeNOx system, a thermal treatment which usually operates under 300 \u00b0C (dioxins generated easily in this temperature). However, some researchers reported that SCR can also be used for a DeDioxins system [45], [46]. Chang, et al. [55], [56], [57] compared the dioxin control of two incinerators in Taiwan in which one used activated carbon injection (ACI) while the other applied SCR. The result showed that SCR system performed better removal efficiency than ACI system (removal efficiency SCR:ACI = 99.5%:94.3%). Applying catalyst can destroy dioxins effectively; activated carbon only absorbs dioxins during the phase of dioxin transfer. In their research, the results indicated that the patterns of dioxin isomers at the APCD inlet and stack are similar for both municipal wastes incinerators. The dioxin concentration at the APCDs inlet of incinerator with cyclones, dry spray tower and fabric filter was 2.75 times higher than the incinerator that uses electrostatic precipitators followed by wet scrubbers. The dioxin removal efficiency reached 98.6% in 2000 after continuous injection of activated carbon (43.4 mg/N m3) for one year. The lower efficiency achieved with ACI in 1999 can be attributed to the memory effect.",

The preferences may change again 20 years from now to the order of preferences like the elimination of viruses and bacteria, energy recovery, and waste treatment. MSW, medical waste, and poultry farm waste may produce different bacteria and viruses. These viruses may lead to the generation of different contagious diseases like severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), a rare contagious disease like Bird flu. Incineration treatment of MSW and medical waste can avoid these infectious viruses and generation of energy for public and industrial utilization.

The amount of pollutants emitted during the past few years follows a decreasing trend, and the level of all emitted pollutants meet the environmental regulations of Taiwan. In the future, there is a possibility that developing countries may adopt incineration technology for the treatment of MSW and generation of renewable energy.
