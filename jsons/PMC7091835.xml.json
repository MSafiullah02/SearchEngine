Also, cellular destruction occurs during the conditioning chemotherapy, and it probably liberates considerable amounts of intracellular iron from ferritin and iron-containing enzymes.1 These mechanisms result in an increase of free iron in HSCT patients. Free iron catalyzes the conversion of reactive oxygen species intermediates to highly toxic-free radicals, which may mediate tissue injury.2 Recent studies have shown that iron overload is related to hepatic complications,3 infectious complications4, 5, 6 and survival7, 8 in HSCT.",

We used deferoxamine mostly as an iron-chelating agent when serum ferritin level was over 1000 ng/ml.

In our study, respiratory failure consisted substantial portion of the cause of TRM after allogeneic HSCT, and acute respiratory distress syndrome showed the tendency to increase with elevated ferritin level. This suggests that acute respiratory distress syndrome occurred more frequently in the F>1000 group could contribute to the increased TRM.",
