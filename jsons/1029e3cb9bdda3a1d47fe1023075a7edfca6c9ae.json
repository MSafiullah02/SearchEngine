Some of these pandemics, such as the Black Death, were caused by bacteria, and others by viruses such as smallpox. The word virus comes from the Latin meaning poison or slimy matter, and entered the English language to signify infectious disease.",

Viruses cannot be grown independently in culture as can bacteria and other free-living microorganisms; viruses require a living cell for reproduction, whether animal, bacterial or plant. A virus contains genetic information-DNA or RNA-yet the statement that a virus is alive is a controversial one. In the 1930s, Wendell Stanley was able to form crystals in solution of the tobacco mosaic virus, a feat that had been performed up until then only with pure chemical molecules infinitesimally smaller than a virus. Viruses form aggregates (clumping) in solution and bond chemically with each other to form a crystal. Many different viruses have been crystallized, and their basic shape and composition revealed. Viruses are at the edge of life, having attributes of inert objects, such as the ability to form crystals, yet also possessing characteristics associated with life, such as genetic material and reproduction. One virus can replicate and give rise to millions more, which is certainly an attribute of life. A virus exists in two stages, one as an inert chemical with a chemical formula; for example, the chemical formula for poliovirus is C332,652 H492,388 N98,245 O131,196 P7,501 S2,340 [1] ; when the virus enters a living cell, it becomes an active replicating organism.",

He describes the onset of fever, sneezing and coughing, with the discharge of blood and a fetid smell, followed by the appearance of ulcers and small pustules on the skin. This was followed by diarrhea and death. Thucydides claims that birds of prey that devoured the bodies also died, and that the disease could spread to domestic animals.

Some drawings on the tombs from the same period indicate wasting of limbs that could be due to poliovirus. It has been suggested that viral infection of humans occurred as a result of the transition from a hunter-gatherer society to a settled agricultural society with the domestication of other mammalian species and the transfer of viruses from these animals to humans. The primitive hunter may have been a healthier person than the settled ''gatherer,'' since he lived a more isolated life, without any crowding. The proximity to domesticated animals and groups of people living under one roof probably resulted in the introduction of new infections to the human population. Examples of this have occurred with human infections in the last few years, with the spread of avian flu, SARS, and HIV-all from other animals.",

Not only was he a physician, he was also a poet. The name ''syphilis'' is derived from Fracastoro's 1530 poem in three books, Syphilis sive morbus gallicus (''Syphilis or The French Disease''), about a shepherd named Syphilis, who angered the god Apollo and was thus cursed with this disease. (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Girolamo_Fracastoro). The poem goes on to describe the symptoms of the disease. Fracastoro discussed the spread of disease that resulted from touching contaminated clothing (fomites) as well as from contact among individuals. He also discussed how various diseases infected and affected various age groups in a population and in various ways. Syphilis was later shown to be a bacterial disease and was called the ''great pox,'' as opposed to smallpox, the virus disease, although smallpox was the more deadly of the two [3] .",

He devoted a large part of his life to studying muscardine, a disease of the silkworm. Muscardine was an important fungal pest of the economically important silk industry of Northern Italy. Many farms were abandoned because of this disease. Bassi concluded from his studies that an infectious agent that could be transmitted by contact between worms, and also could be transmitted by contaminated cages or utensils, caused the disease. He identified the infectious agent as a fungus, later named Beauvaria bassiana. He is also credited with rescuing the vitally important silk industry with recommendations such as the use of disinfectants; separating the rows of feeding caterpillars; isolating and destroying infected caterpillars; and keeping the silk farms clean. He used ''semi-sterile'' techniques to prevent infection. Pasteur and others who came after him were unaware of his research and made similar, independent discoveries. Bassi also proposed that human diseases such as syphilis and measles were transmitted from one person to another by contact. Both Fracastoro and Bassi have been overlooked in the history of medicine, whereas Pasteur has become a household name [2] .",

She had discovered the use of variolation during her sojourn in Turkey in 1716-1718; variolation was widely practiced, but often resulted in cases of smallpox, although not as severe as a natural infection. Dr. Edward Jenner (1749-1823), a practicing physician in Berkeley, England, had noted, as had others, that milkmaids very rarely contracted smallpox. Instead, their hands often had sores later shown to be caused by the cowpox virus (vaccinia) ( Fig. 1.6 ).

For example, Benjamin Jesty, a farmer in Dorset (southern England), had inoculated his wife and children with cowpox material during an outbreak in 1774 and, I assume, induced immunity in the family. In 1796 Jenner tested his hypothesis that the pus from the wounds that occurred on the udder of milking cows contained material that could protect against smallpox by inoculating James Phipps, the son of his gardener, with pus from a wound on the hand of his milkmaid, Sarah Nelmes, who had been infected by a virus from a cow named Blossom. Blossom is probably one of the most famous cows in history, her hide immortalized in St George's Hospital Medical School in London. James was then variolated with the smallpox virus a number of times and had basically no reaction, showing complete immunity. Jenner then tested vaccination on 23 other people, none of whom came down with smallpox. He presented his data to the Royal Society and published his data [4] . His idea of preventing smallpox with a ''vaccine'' was not easily accepted on religious grounds (''interfering with the work of God''); also ridiculed was the use of material from a cow (see cartoon, In this cartoon, the British satirist James Gillray drew a caricature of a scene at the Smallpox and Inoculation Hospital at St Pancras, showing Edward Jenner administering cowpox vaccine to frightened young women, and cows emerging from different parts of people's bodies. The cartoon was inspired by the controversy over inoculating against the dreaded disease-smallpox. The inoculation agent, cowpox vaccine, was rumored to have the ability to sprout cow-like appendages. A serene Edward Jenner stands amid the crowd.

In 1857-1858 Pasteur made the discovery that put to He showed that liquids in sealed containers remained sterile, but that exposure to the air resulted in contaminations that gave rise to fermentations or growth of bacteria or fungi. He wrote, ''germs of microscopic organisms abound in the surface of all objects, in the air, and in water,'' concluding that these organisms cause fermentation, such as occur in wine, beer, vinegar etc., and that under sterile conditions with no access to air these fermentations do not take place. About the same time, working in Germany, Robert Koch, a country doctor, described the organism responsible for anthrax, a disease of cattle. He showed that the bacteria had a life cycle, including a stage of spore formation, a stage not easily destroyed by heat or other means, which could account for infections occurring at various periods, and allowed organisms to live in the soil for a long time. Among other achievements, Koch went on to isolate and describe the organism responsible for tuberculosis. Koch was influenced by his mentor, Jacob Henle, who in 1840 proposed that infectious diseases were caused by living organisms and reproduced outside the infected individual. Earlier, Aloys Pollender, Pierre-Francois Olive Rayer and Casamir-Joseph Davaine had discovered the anthrax bacterium. Koch himself set out to prove scientifically that this bacillus is, in fact, the cause of the disease. He inoculated mice with homemade slivers of wood containing anthrax bacilli taken from the spleens of farm animals that had died of the disease, and found that these mice were susceptible to the disease and died, whereas mice inoculated at the same time with blood from the spleens of healthy animals did not. This confirmed the work of others who had shown that the disease could be transmitted by means of the blood of infected animals. He went on to develop methods of growing and staining the bacteria, and with a colleague developed the Petri dish (named after his colleague) that is still used today [7] .",

As will be discussed later, in the case of work with yellow fever, bacteria were isolated from most yellow fever victims (not all, however) and was claimed to be the source of the disease. Only by showing that it was not present in ALL patients could it be proven that it was not the causative agent. It has proven ethically difficult to carry out Koch's postulates in the case of some viral diseases that only infect humans (e.g., human immunodeficiency virus [HIV] and hepatitis C). If no animal model is present, it is difficult to prove beyond a doubt-without human experimentation-that a specific agent is the cause of the disease. Smallpox and measles viruses also are exclusively human pathogens, and the early study of smallpox in particular involved unregulated research on human subjects. In more recent times, and particularly in the era of laboratory-driven investigations, we have had to create very specific ethical guidelines. Many of the discoveries, such as the role of mosquitoes in transmitting yellow fever, and vaccination against smallpox, involved the use of humans in a manner not acceptable today.",

Furthermore, he showed that minimal numbers of the bacteria are required by serial dilution, growing the new cultures in test tubes and injecting material into animals (see Koch's postulates above). Anthrax today is better known as a possible agent of biological warfare than as a disease of cattle. In 2001, envelopes containing anthrax were sent through the U.S. mail to congressmen and caused quite a panic. It was initially assumed that this was a case of bio-terrorism conducted by foreign terrorists, although now it is suspected that this was the work of a disturbed American scientist.",

Such spores survive for a long time outside the body. Koch had made a similar finding-that anthrax could exist in a spore form resistant to heat and desiccation. In a paper in 1880, Pasteur described the application of his findings and techniques to other conditions, particularly furuncles (boils). He showed that the pus that developed from such lesions contained infectious chains made of round cells (cocci) and that this organism could also be grown in culture. He showed that every furuncle contained cocci that caused the inflammation and pus formation. These organisms were injected into rabbits and formed abscesses containing pus, and the same organism could be isolated again (Koch's postulate). Of great interest were his observations on puerperal fever, associated with women who had recently given birth or had a miscarriage, and which was extremely fatal, and the isolation of the bacteria that caused this disease [8] (Figs. 1.8, 1.9 ).",

Viruses are 100-1,000 times smaller than bacteria, and this could be determined only when one began to filter cultures from infected individuals, plants or animals. Various types of filters were invented in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries to purify water and other liquids. These early filters were made of diatomaceous earth from organisms that left a glass shell after they died, and small matter would pass through the filters, but larger organisms, such as most bacteria, fungi, etc., would be retained by the filter. Thus viruses could be defined as ''filterable agents.'' These porcelain filters were developed in the Pasteur group by one of Pasteur's colleagues, Charles Chamberland (1858-1901), and were called ''Chamberland filters.'' However, it was difficult to differentiate ''viruses'' from toxins. Work in the lab of Louis Pasteur, performed by his colleagues Emile Roux and Alexander Yersin (1863-1943), identified the toxin that caused diphtheria. Roux and Yersin developed an anti-serum to this toxin, which was used to save the lives of many young adults affected by diphtheria, a fatal disease. Filtration was an important tool in differentiating bacteria that had been retained by the filters from toxins and what were later called viruses. Diphtheria toxin is actually produced by a strain of bacillus containing a bacteriophage (virus). The toxin is produced by the virus.",

Many plant viruses, all speciesspecific, cause similar symptoms, the most famous of them the virus that causes the variegation of tulips. The pattern that developed as the result of the infection had great economic importance. In fact, it was the rarity of such tulips that led to the market concept of futures, and to the exchange of large sums of money in the seventeenth century in Holland (1634-1637), during a period known as tulipmania. Such tulips did not breed true, and the pattern died out quite suddenly. This caused a financial crash, and may be thought of as the first stock market crash or bursting of a financial bubble [12] (Fig. 1.11 ). None of this related historical experience was understood at the time that TMV became a topic of scientific, and perhaps commercial, concern in the 1890s. Adolf Mayer (1843-1942) , director of the Agricultural Experimental Station in Wageningen, Holland, first discovered that TMV was an infectious agent. He is credited with being the first person to extract juice (sap) from infected plants and used it as an inoculum to infect other plants. He tried to culture the organism but failed to grow it on media and it was not visible in the then crude microscopes.

Unfortunately, the relevance of disease in non-humans, particularly in non-mammals, to humans was not realized until 50 or 60 years later. We now know, through examples such as ''avian flu'' or ''swine flu,'' that other animals are stricken with the same vectors as man, can transmit these vectors to man, or act as a reservoir for these diseases. The first reported case of a possible virus related to cancer was the observation in 1908 by two Danish veterinary researchers, Vilhelm Ellerman and Oluf Bang, who found that leukemia of chickens could be transmitted by a cell-free extract. Peyton Rous (1879 Rous ( -1970 at the Rockefeller Institute in New York reported a few years later that not only leukemia but also solid tumors (sarcomas) were transmissible [15] . Peyton Rous came from a poor Texan family, settled in Baltimore, and received a BA from John Hopkins University in 1900. Due to an accident that affected his health, he worked at a Texas ranch. Returning to medical school, he received his MD degree in 1905 and then worked in the Department of Pathology at the University of Michigan, and later in Dresden, Germany. Subsequently he received a grant to do research at the Rockefeller Institute in New York. The director of the Institute, Simon Flexner, who headed the cancer laboratories, asked him to take his place since he, Flexner, wished to devote his time to poliovirus research, and Peyton Rous succeeded him. While working with spontaneous tumors of chickens, he demonstrated in 1910 that a cell-free extract made from the tumor was transmittable, and that different types of tumors arose from different cell-free extracts of different tumors. Thus the work of two groups (Ellerman/Bang and Rous) laid the groundwork for an analysis of the relationship between tumors and viruses.",

These were first discovered by Frederick Twort (1877 Twort ( -1950 [16] in England and by Felix d 'Herelle (1873 'Herelle ( -1949 , a Canadian working in France. In 1910 d'Herelle, working in Mexico, was alerted to the presence of dysentery in locusts [17] . He cultured the organism from the insects, and noted during the growth of the bacteria that there were areas of clearing in the culture in Petri dishes; however, he did not realize the importance of the discovery until World War I, when he was working with shigella, a bacterium that also caused dysentery in humans. D'Herelle realized then that the areas of clearing were plaques caused by a filterable agent, namely a virus-infecting bacteria [18] . He also noted that the culture of bacteria cleared during this infection so that no bacteria were left (or so it appeared). D'Herelle had hoped that such bacteriophage could be used in therapy against bacterial diseases [19] . This was an active area of research in the 1930s-1980s in Eastern Europe and Russia and today is an area of renewed research. The same idea was presented in Sinclair Lewis's novel Arrowsmith, in which a physician experiments with bacteriophage to cure common diseases [20] .",

He isolated the substance that produced this effect and found that it was transmitted indefinitely to subsequent generations of the bacterium. He then suggested that the substance was a virus. Twort was unable to continue this work, and the importance of bacteriophage was not recognized until the 1950s, when it became a major tool of molecular biologists and revolutionized the whole field of biology. In chapters on bacteriophage (Chaps. 4 and 16), I describe the controversy surrounding the discovery of bacteriophage, its possible use in the treatment of bacterial infections, and the role bacteriophage plays in molecular biology.",

Wendell Stanley received the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1946 for his seminal work. Even at that time it was still believed that proteins were the genetic material, although the virus did contain some nucleic acids. It was not until further work with bacteriophage, and simultaneously with bacteria, that it could be shown that the nucleic acid contained the genetic information. These were experiments involving DNA transformation in bacillus [21] , and in later experiments with bacteriophage, it could be shown, using radiolabeled material, that the DNA of the bacteriophage entered the bacterial cells and replicated and produced progeny phage and not the protein [22] that remained attached to the outside of the cell (Fig. 1.13 ).",

These early studies with bacteriophage, and the parallel studies with cell culture and the growth of viruses, allowed for the quantization of virus growth. The number of scientists involved is too many to list, but all the principal players constituted the phage group, headed by Max Delbruck, that met at the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratories in New York. They were later joined by James Watson and Francis Crick of DNA double helix fame.",

Based on the earlier work of John Franklin Enders and others, in 1953 Jonas Salk announced the achievement of a polio vaccine [23] . Salk became not only a celebrated scientist, but also a hero. His vaccine was based on a ''dead'' virus, which was followed two years later by a rival vaccine, the Sabin vaccine, based on a series of attenuated (weakened) viruses [24] . Both vaccines have their pros and cons, and both are still used today, although in the U.S. the Salk vaccine is considered safer since it does not involve viruses that can reproduce. However, the introduction of these vaccines was not without risk since the first batch of commercially produced Salk vaccine contained some improperly inactivated virus particles.",

Rous's sarcoma virus, and later other viruses associated with cancer in mice, were shown to be RNA viruses (at one time it was thought that most viruses were DNA viruses). In culture, these viruses were inhibited by Actinomycin D, a drug known to inhibit DNA-dependent RNA polymerase, the enzyme involved in mRNA synthesis from DNA, suggesting that these RNA viruses had a DNA stage. Although this was difficult to believe, eventually two groups in 1970 independently discovered an enzyme in infected cells (but not in uninfected cells) that copied RNA into DNA by a complicated mechanism. This was ''reverse transcriptase,'' and the name ''retroviruses'' was given to this class of virus. The two labs involved were those of David Baltimore and Howard Temin, classmates from Swarthmore College in Pennsylvania [26, 27] . Each made independently parallel discoveries and shared the Nobel Prize for their work. The discovery of this enzyme opened the way to studies of cancer viruses, some of which could be linked to human leukemia (HTLV-1) and later on to HIV, the virus causing AIDS.",
