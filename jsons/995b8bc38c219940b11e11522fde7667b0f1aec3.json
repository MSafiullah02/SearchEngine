The infectious agents implicated as primary causes of rhinitis in cats include feline herpesvirus 1 (FHV-1), feline calicivirus (FCV), Bordetella bronchiseptica, Chlamydophila felis, Mycoplasma spp., and some strains of Pasteurella spp. Vaccines are available only for FHV-1, FCV, B. bronchiseptica, and C. felis, and no single product is available that induces protection against all 4 agents. In addition, as with FCV, different strains of each agent can respond differently to vaccination, and it is unlikely that any product confers complete protection. [1] [2] [3] [4] There are different formulations of the respiratory agents contained in commercially available vaccines in the United States. The majority of available vaccines are formulated for parenteral administration; however, there are 2 vaccines containing attenuated FHV-1 and FCV that are formulated for intranasal administration. a,b,5 There are potential differences between immunologic responses induced by intranasal inoculation and parenteral inoculation. For example, in one study, intranasal administration of a FHV-1, FCV, and panleukopenia (FVRCP) vaccine induced more rapid serologic responses to FHV-1 and FCV than a modified live FVRCP for parenteral administration. 6 In other studies, intranasal administration of a FVRCP vaccine induced protection against FHV-1 challenge as early as 4 days after a single vaccination, 7 and administration of an intranasal B. bronchiseptica vaccine induced protection against B. bronchiseptica as early as 3 days after a single vaccination, 8 suggesting protection mediated at least in part by nonspecific immune stimulation. In addition, intranasal administration of a FVRCP vaccine induced greater lymphoblast responses to concanavalin A (a nonspecific mitogen) and to FHV-1 antigens than a modified live FVRCP for parenteral administration. c It therefore seems possible that nonspecific immune stimulation induced by intranasal vaccination might lessen clinical signs of disease when the vaccinate is exposed to infectious agents not contained within the vaccine.

Results were unlikely affected by prior immunity or infection, as SPF kittens were used, and infection with B. bronchiseptica, Mycoplasma spp, FHV-1 and FCV was ruled out with negative tests before inoculation. These findings support the hypothesis that intranasal vaccination against FHV-1 and FCV confers cross-protection against challenge with an infectious agent (B. bronchiseptica) not contained in the vaccine. However, the measured effects were lost during the second 10 days of observation after challenge, suggesting that the protection was short-lived. In the aforementioned study of the efficacy of an intranasal B. bronchiseptica vaccine, there was both rapid protection against B. bronchiseptica challenge at 72 hours after vaccination and a 12-month duration of immunity against B. bronchiseptica. 8 It seems plausible, then, that the rapid onset of protection observed was because of nonspecific immunity induced by the process of intranasal vaccination or an unintentional component of the vaccine, whereas the longer term protection was because of a specific acquired immune response against B. bronchiseptica.

It is unknown whether it is because of the infectious agents within the vaccine or some other component, such as cell culture proteins. One theory is that prior vaccination might dampen cytokine-mediated inflammation caused by respiratory infection, lessening clinical signs of disease. However, in a study demonstrating the cross-protective effect of B. pertussis vaccination against influenza in mice, this effect lagged at least 3 weeks behind vaccination, and so this mechanism seems an unlikely explanation for the findings described here. 9 Stimulation of the innate immune system by intranasal vaccination seems a more likely explanation. Rapid boosting of innate immunity occurs after administration of AcNPV 10 and chitin microparticles in rodent models of influenza immunity. 11 These effects are attributed to activation of natural killer cells, as well as regulation of inflammatory cytokines. It seems plausible, then, that if one component of the innate immune system (natural killer cells) can be recruited by an unrelated intranasal treatment, so could other components of the innate immune system that would protect against the effects of bacterial infection. Immune responses of the kittens were not measured in the present study, and further research is required to determine the mediation of this nonspecific immunity.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 644, "end": 645, "text": "9", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 885, "end": 887, "text": "11", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Regardless of the mechanism, stimulation of nonspecific immunity via intranasal vaccination would have several benefits. First, it might provide protection against organisms for which vaccinations are not available or routinely administered, such as Mycoplasma spp. in cats and dogs and canine herpesvirus, canine respiratory coronavirus, or canine influenza virus in dogs. Second, nonspecific immunity likely becomes active while specific immunity is still developing, thereby conferring protection more quickly after vaccination. While the B. bronchiseptica challenge in this study was on Day 7 after intranasal vaccination with FHV-1 and FCV, and timing of onset of the nonspecific immune response was not investigated, previous work demonstrated a partial immune response as early as 2 days after intranasal vaccination of cats against FHV-1. 7 This type of early protection would be of particular value in the event of unforeseen exposure to potential infectious organisms (for example, emergency boarding) and in shelter environments, where the typical \"stray hold\" period is 5 days, and there might be financial limitations on the number of vaccines that can be administered.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 847, "end": 848, "text": "7", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "The present study was limited by the relatively mild clinical signs observed in both the vaccinated and control cats. While the cats in the study described here were administered a larger dose of the same strain of B. bronchiseptica than administered in a previous study, the cats in this study had much milder clinical signs of disease. 8 This strain of B. bronchiseptica has been studied for approximately 27 years, and it is possible that long-term storage, multiple passages, or freezing and thawing of the agent have rendered it less pathogenic. 8 In addition, in the study described here, B. bronchiseptica was purposely administered to the cats via direct inoculation rather than aerosolization to avoid the need for sedation and to attempt to minimize the potential for severe systemic illness. It is likely that this limited the inoculum to the upper respiratory tissues, which might have lessened systemic clinical signs of disease like fever and cough. 8 Finally, this study studied the cross-protection effects induced by one vaccine administered intranasally. Whether similar effects would be recognized after administration of other intranasal vaccines or by parenteral vaccines is unknown, and further research in these areas is warranted.
