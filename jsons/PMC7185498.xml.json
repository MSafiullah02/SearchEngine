A recent water-borne outbreak of cryptosporidiosis in humans prompted several studies on Cryptosporidium spp. in Korea (Moon et al., 2013). In calves, Cryptosporidium spp. were identified in the diarrheal feces of calves by using dimethyl sulfoxide-modified acid-fast staining, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and indirect immunofluorescence antibody assay (Wee et al., 1996). Previous studies on animals and humans in Korea focused on the regional prevalence, and only a few studies have evaluated the molecular characteristics of Cryptosporidium.",

In the present study, the overall prevalence of Cryptosporidium detected by PCR was 9.9% (94/951), which was lower than that reported in previous studies conducted in Korea. Our results may reflect improvements in hygiene, as the previous studies were performed more than 10 years ago (some were more than 20 years ago), when the hygiene of cattle breeding systems was inadequate. As poor hygiene may result in Cryptosporidium infection in humans (Ryan et al., 2014), improvements of hygiene in cattle rearing may have resulted in the lower prevalence observed in the present study.",

While there was good agreement between the two tests, there were still 41 ELISA+/PCR- samples. This discrepancy may be attributed to two factors: first, the presence of PCR inhibitors such as bilirubin, bile salts, and complex polysaccharides, which are included in feces, and second, limitations in the sensitivity and specificity in each assay (Morgan et al., 1998).

Because a very small number of oocysts can initiate C. parvum infection (Okhuysen et al., 1999), and there are a limited number of medicines available to treat cryptosporidiosis (Ryan et al., 2014), prevention is the most important method for reducing economic losses in the livestock industry.",
