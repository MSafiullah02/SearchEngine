By contrast, complete replacement of the transmembrane domain of the IBV E protein with a heterologous membrane-spanning domain had no effect on the Golgi targeting of E, the association of M with E, or the production of VLPs. 6, 7 We concluded that the sequence of the transmembrane domain of the protein was unimportant for its function.",

            "text": "The results presented here support the idea that the transmembrane domain of the coronavirus E protein plays an important role in a late stage of the virus replication cycle. Particles purified from the supernatants of IBV-EG3-infected cells lacked a full complement of spikes and contained what appeared to be a small, C-terminal proteolytic fragment of the spike protein. Thus, although the transmembrane domain of the IBV E protein is not required for formation of virus particles, it does appear to be required for their efficient release in an infectious form. If the coronavirus E protein forms a cation-specific ion channel, we predict that the EG3 protein would lack such an activity. Because a recombinant IBV containing the chimeric E protein could be isolated, such an activity is not essential for the virus. However, the putative ion channel activity could be important for protecting viruscontaining secretory vesicles from fusion with lysosomes. The exact mechanism of coronavirus release after budding into the endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi intermediate compartment is not known. Large vacuoles containing budded virions are observed in infected cells, presumably en route to the plasma membrane where fusion of the vacuole results in release of virions. 14 Perhaps the excess E protein produced in infected cells functions to modify membrane traffic pathways to enhance fusion of virus-containing vacuoles with the plasma membrane rather than with lysosomes. This could either be by modification of microenvironments via ion channel activity or by interaction with host cell membrane trafficking machinery directly. Fusion of vacuoles containing partially degraded virions with the plasma membrane would release these particles into the supernatant, explaining the biochemical and morphologic appearance of IBV-EG3. Regardless of whether the E protein forms an ion channel or interacts directly with membrane traffic machinery, the transmembrane domain of the E protein appears to play an important role in this second, nonstructural role in the virus replication cycle. Future experiments will be directed towards understanding the role of the E transmembrane domain in coronavirus release.",

Total virus was harvested at the times indicated by freezing the supernatant and cells together. Titers were determined by plaque assay on Vero cells. (B) The supernatants and cells were harvested separately from cells infected with IBV or IBV-EG3 at 14 h and 24 h postinfection.

More vacuoles were observed in IBV-EG3 infected cells than in cells infected with wild-type IBV. In addition, some of the vacuoles in IBV-EG3 infected cells contained degenerating organelles (arrows), suggesting they were autophagosomes. Bars, 500 nm.",
