            "text": "Trifluoromethyl ketones (TFMKs) are well known as the inhibitors of serine17 and cysteine18 proteases. Owing to the high electronegativity of fluorine, the carbonyl carbon of TFMK is a highly active electrophile. It is generally believed that hemiketal or hemithioketal is formed by the nucleophilic attack of the hydroxyl or thiol group at the active site when TFMKs are employed as the inhibitors against serine or cysteine proteases, respectively. Previous studies19 indicated that TFMKs demonstrate a competitive slow, tight-binding inhibition against human leukocyte elastase. Recently, Zhang et al.20a described N,N-dimethyl glutaminyl fluoromethyl ketones as 3CL protease inhibitors. One of these compounds was found to have low toxicity in mice, and another one was found to have an EC50 value of 2.5 \u03bcM based on the cytopathic effect (CPE) inhibition assay. However, the in vitro inhibition has not been characterized in detail. Sydnes et al.20b also reported the synthesis of glutamic acid and glutamine peptides with a CF3-ketone unit as 3CL protease inhibitors.",

Scheme 1\nshows the four-step synthesis of various N-protected trifluoromethyl ketones. The preparation of nitro alcohols 3 was carried out by C\u2013C bond formation between nitroalkanes 2 and trifluoroacetaldehyde ethyl hemiacetal under the basic condition of catalytic potassium carbonate. The choice of nitroalkanes defines the P1 group of the final inhibitor. For instance, 1-nitro-2-phenylethane 2a introduces a benzyl group at the P1 site. Subsequent reduction to amine alcohols was performed either by PtO2- or Raney nickel-catalyzed hydrogenation. The use of PtO2 was avoided in the reduction of 3a because undesired saturation of the phenyl ring was observed. At this stage, the trifluoroamine alcohols were coupled with N-protected amino acids or long-chain acids by using HBTU and DIEA (or Et3N) to afford 4a\u2013g. Final oxidation using Dess\u2013Martin reagent generated the desired trifluoromethyl ketones 5a\u2013h.",

The activity of 5a, 5b, 5f, 5g, and 5h, having benzyl group as the side chain at the P1 site, supports the idea that the P2\u2013P4 sites still have a significant contribution to the binding affinity though they are far from the active site. The best inhibitor 5h, containing the same residues as the reported substrate sequence at the P2, P3, and P4 sites, displayed a competitive inhibition against 3CL protease (Fig. 1\n). Moreover, in consistence with the previous reports of cathepsin B and human leukocyte elastase,(b), 19 prolonged incubation of 3CL protease with 5h exhibited a time-dependent decrease in enzyme activity as a function of the inhibitor concentration. The inhibitor was found to produce progressive tightening of inhibition, as shown by a 30-fold decrease in the K\ni value (from 8.8 to 0.3 \u03bcM) in 4 hr (Table 2\nand Fig. 2\n). As indicated by the NMR studies, the trifluoromethyl ketone moiety exists as an equilibrium mixture of ketone and hydrate forms. The time-dependent tightening of inhibition is likely due to the slow formation of a covalent adduct through the nucleophilic attack of the thiol group on the carbonyl carbon.",

Alternatively, computational molecular modeling was used to construct a model for the acyl\u2013enzyme complex. On the basis of the crystal structure of 3CL protease with a chloromethyl ketone (CMK) inhibitor, the analog of trifluoromethyl ketone, determined by Yang et al.,7 we first constructed the models for the four possible stereoisomers of the covalent adducts between the protein and compound 5h. All the models were constrained with a covalent link between the thiol group of Cys-145 and compound 5h, in consistent with the analog experimental complex structure by Yang et al.7 In comparison with the analog experimental structure, only the (S,S,S,S) isomer of compound 5h with the R configuration of carbonyl carbon adjacent to CF3 group agreed with the binding mode of the CMK inhibitor, in particular all four amino acid side chains of compound 5h fitted into the bind pockets of the 3CL protease active site. All the other three stereoisomers were ruled out because all these molecules were unable to bind to the active site under the covalent constraint. The computational model of the (S,S,S,S) isomer is different from the binding mode of the CMK-3CL protease complex structure in that the P1, P2, P4 side chains in compound 5h occupied S2, S1, and S4 sites, respectively, in 3CL protease (Fig. 3\n). The binding mode discrepancies were expected consequences due to the difference between the amino acid side chains of the two inhibitor analogs. The proposed detailed covalent attacking mechanism was shown in Figure 4\n.",

Air- and moisture-sensitive liquids and solutions were transferred via syringe. Organic solutions were concentrated by rotary evaporation at 23\u201380 \u00b0C (water-bath temperature). Column chromatography was performed employing Merck silica gel (60 \u00c5 pore size, 70\u2013230 mesh ASTM). Analytical thin-layer chromatography (TLC) was performed using glass plates pre-coated with Merck silica gel (60 \u00c5 pore size) impregnated with a fluorescent indicator (254 nm). TLC plates were visualized by I2 vapors, UV lamp, phosphomolybdic acid solution in ethanol, or 0.5% ninhydrin in ethanol followed by brief heating on a hot plate. Commercial solvents and reagents were used as received without further purification. They were purchased from Aldrich, ACROS, BACHEM, or other commercial sources. Compounds are characterized by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and high resolution mass spectroscopy. Proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR) spectra and carbon nuclear magnetic resonance (13C NMR) spectra were recorded with Bruker Avance 600 (600 MHz/ 150 MHz), Bruker DRX 500 (500 MHz/ 125 MHz), and Bruker Avance 400 (400 MHz/100 MHz) NMR spectrometers. Chemical shifts for protons are reported in parts per million (ppm; \u03b4 scale) and are referenced to residual protium in the NMR solvents (CHCl3: \u03b4 7.26, D2HCOD: \u03b4 3.31, C2D5HSO: \u03b4 2.50, C2D5HCO: \u03b4 2.05).

Data are represented as follows: chemical shift, multiplicity (s, singlet; d, doublet; t, triplet; q, quartet; m, multiplet; br, broad), coupling constant in Hz, integration, and assignment. High resolution mass spectra were obtained using Bruker Daltonics BioTOF III.",

We constructed four stereomeric compound 5h complex as hemithioketal (DISCOVERY STUDIO 1.7) to determine which isomer can form the protein-inhibitor adduct. GOLD 3.223, 24 was used for the flexible docking of compound 5h into the enzyme to explore the wide range of its conformational flexibility. The atoms of the enzyme and compound 5h were assigned with Kollmann all-atom charges25 with SYBYL 7.3 program.26 To distinguish the four possible stereoisomers of enzyme-inhibitor complex, the carbonyl carbon adjacent to the CF3 group of compound 5h was constrained to form a covalent bonding with the sulfur atom of Cys-145. Initial 1000 independent genetic algorithm running cycles were carried out with inhibitor torsion angles varying between \u2212180 and 180 degree. The search efficiency was set up at 200% to ensure the most exhaustive search for docking conformation space. The docking processes were carried out in a 40-CPU (Intel Xeon(TM) CPU 3.00 GHz) Linux cluster. For each stereoisomer conformation, the resultant enzyme-inhibitor complex structures were ranked with the CHEMSCORE scoring27 function to determine the top 10 hits.",
