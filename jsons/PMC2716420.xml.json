The genus Vesivirus is divided presently into two major virus species: Vesicular exanthema of swine virus (VESV) and Feline calicivirus (FCV). The VESV species was identified following the occurrence of outbreaks of vesicular disease in swine in California in 1932 that showed striking similarity to foot-and-mouth disease (Traum, 1936). Thousands of pigs were destroyed before foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) was excluded as the etiologic agent, and a new virus, designated VESV was associated with the disease. It was later proposed that VESV was introduced into pig herds by the accidental contamination of feed with marine mammal and fish products harboring serologically related vesiviruses (Smith et al., 1973, Smith and Boyt, 1990).",

            "text": "Vesiviruses isolated from marine mammals are known commonly as San Miguel sea lion viruses (SMSVs) and marine mammals are considered natural hosts (Smith et al., 1973). Vesicular disease and reproductive failure are the most common signs when illness occurs. Species of marine mammals found infected with vesiviruses include sea lions, seals, walrus, whales, and dolphins (Smith and Boyt, 1990). Fish may also be natural hosts for the vesiviruses. Several serotypes of SMSV, including SMSV-7 which caused classical vesicular exanthema disease in exposed swine have been isolated from the Opaleye fish (Girella nigricans) (Smith et al., 1980b). The Opaleye fish has also been shown to support the replication of SMSV-5 when challenged under experimental conditions (Smith et al., 1980a). Other strains of vesiviruses closely related to the marine vesiviruses have been identified in terrestrial animals. These include isolates from rabbits (Martin-Alonso et al., 2005), skunks (Seal et al., 1995b), reptiles and amphibians (Smith et al., 1986), monkeys (Smith et al., 1978, Smith et al., 1985), and humans (Smith et al., 1998, Smith et al., 2006, Smith et al., 1978). More recently, evidence was reported that vesivirus infection may be associated with abortion in horses (Kurth et al., 2006). To date, more than 40 different serotypes and untyped marine vesiviruses that infect both marine and terrestrial animals have been described (Smith and Boyt, 1990), but serotyping reagents are not widely available for characterizing new viruses.",

            "text": "Of economical and regulatory significance is the resemblance of vesivirus disease in swine to FMD, classified as a Foreign Animal Disease (FAD) in U.S. livestock and caused by FMDV, a picornavirus. For these reasons, the marine vesiviruses in the VESV species are considered restricted in the United States and have been designated as Foreign Animal Disease Agents (Bankowski, 1965, Smith and Boyt, 1990). It is crucial therefore, to have rapid, specific and sensitive diagnostic assays to detect and identify vesiviruses associated with blisters or vesicles in order to distinguish them from those caused by FMDV. Current diagnostic assays for the identification of marine vesiviruses include: (1) conventional virological techniques, such as virus isolation in cell cultures and electron microscopy (Smith et al., 1973, Smith et al., 1974), (2) serological methods, including virus neutralization (Smith and Akers, 1976, Smith and Boyt, 1990) and enzyme linked immunosorbent assays (Ferris and Oxtoby, 1994), and (3) molecular assays, such as conventional reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) (Reid et al., 1999) and more recently, a real-time RT-PCR (rtRT-PCR) (Reid et al., 2007). Although the latter assay targeted sequences corresponding to the highly conserved RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) gene, it failed to detect and identify marine vesiviruses of two serotypes.",

Total RNA was precipitated with isopropyl alcohol and the resulting RNA pellet was dissolved in RNase-free water. The viruses used in the validation of the real-time assay were 10 marine vesiviruses described previously including SMSV-1, -2, -4, -5, -6, -8, -12,-13, -14, bovine calicivirus Bos-1 (Smith et al., 1983, Smith and Boyt, 1990), and two recently characterized marine vesiviruses isolated from Steller sea lions (SSL) from Alaska; SSL V810 and SSL V1415 (McClenahan et al., 2008). Several other members of the genus Vesivirus were assayed also to determine the specificity of the rtRT-PCR assay, including four isolates of Feline calicivirus (FCV) propagated in Crandall-Reese feline kidney (CRFK) cell cultures. Three FCV isolates were recovered from cats in Florida (C01, C46, and C58) (Weeks et al., 2001), and the Urbana FCV isolate was described previously (Sosnovtsev and Green, 1995). A vesivirus isolated from mink, mink calicivirus (strain MCV9) (Evermann et al., 1983, Guo et al., 2001), was included in the analysis. RNA samples extracted from viruses representing three genogroups (G) of the genus Norovirus within the Caliciviridae were tested and included human noroviruses Norwalk virus (G1.1) (Kapikian et al., 1972), DC-56 (GII.1) (Brandt et al., 1983), and MD104-4 (GII.4) (Green et al., 2002), and murine norovirus strains NIH-MNV 2409 (Perdue et al., 2007) and MNV-1 (Karst et al., 2003) in Genogroup V. Vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) serotype Indiana was used as a control to rule out nonspecific detection of an unrelated virus that produces clinical signs in swine similar to those induced by marine vesiviruses.

Second, total RNA was extracted from cells infected with SSL vesivirus isolates V810 and V1415 as described above, and further purified using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen). The RNA was quantified using a NanoDrop Spectrophotomer (Labtech, Dublin, Ireland), and 10-fold serial dilutions were prepared in water.

Virus stocks were prepared from SSL strains V810 and V1415, and the titers determined by end-point dilution in microtiter tissue culture plates to calculate the TCID50 and by plaque assay on a cell monolayer to quantify the number of PFU per ml (Table 2\n). The V810 virus titer was determined to be 109.75\n TCID50 and 109\n PFU/ml and the V1415 virus titer was 108.5\n TCID50 and 6 \u00d7 108\n PFU/ml. The RNA was extracted from the virus stock used in the infectivity titration and diluted, and the presence or absence of RNA at each dilution was analyzed by rtRT-PCR and standard RT-PCR to determine the limit of detection (LOD). The rtRT-PCR was positive for the detection of RNA at similar dilutions in which infectious virus was detected in cell culture (Table 2), although the TCID50 assay appeared to be the most sensitive of the assays examined. The same RNA samples were analyzed in a standard RT-PCR assay and the products visualized in an agarose gel (data not shown). The highest dilution at which RNA was detected was the 10\u22124 dilution for both viral isolates (Table 2), indicating a lower sensitivity of the standard RT-PCR compared with the rtRT-PCR assay.",

Primer concentration seemed to cause more variation in the Ct values; with low concentrations such as 50 nM increasing Ct values and high concentrations of the order of 400 nM to 1 \u03bcM causing false positive reactivity even in the absence of cDNA template (data not shown). An intermediate concentration of 200 nM of each primer was chosen, similar to that of a recently published rtRT-PCR assay (Reid et al., 2007). The primers and probe in this study performed efficiently in a one-step assay that had been optimized for the detection of human noroviruses, even though the primer and probe concentrations were higher (400 nM).

These serotypes are considered quite distinct from most marine vesivirus serotypes, as specific antisera against these viruses do not cross-react with other SMSV serotypes in immunoassays (Seal et al., 1995a). A set of primers designed for a conventional RT-PCR for marine vesiviruses also failed to amplify SMSV-8 and -12 (Reid et al., 1999). As mentioned above, both SMSV-8 and -12 were amplified and correctly identified as marine vesiviruses in the rtRT-PCR assay described here. The region of the capsid gene targeted corresponded to the highly conserved region A of the capsid gene (Neill, 1992), and most likely represents a better target region than the RNA polymerase region targeted in other assays. However, because of the quasispecies evolution of the capsid gene of vesiviruses (Radford et al., 1998), it may be necessary in the future to refine the new rtRT-PCR assay to correct for minor changes in the genome of novel and emerging marine vesiviruses.",

When more than one RNA virus is suspected, i.e., enteroviruses, coronaviruses, paramyxoviruses, etc., the two-step assay may be preferred in a diagnostic laboratory as the generated cDNA may then be used in several different PCR assays. Conversely, when the primary goal is the detection of marine vesiviruses in clinical or research specimens, the one-tube assay may be preferred. The assay amplified successfully a 176 nucleotide fragment from a highly conserved region of the capsid gene after reverse transcription of total RNA derived from cell cultures infected with 12 different marine vesiviruses. The assay did not amplify closely related terrestrial vesiviruses such as FCV and five members of the genus Norovirus. The new rtRT-PCR assay is at least 100,000 times more sensitive than a conventional RT-PCR assay utilizing the same primers. Although not evaluated in the present report, this novel diagnostic assay has the potential for use as a rapid, sensitive, and specific assay to detect known and novel marine vesiviruses in field clinical samples such as oropharyngeal and rectal swabs and blister fluids.",
