Nonetheless, anosmia and hyposmia are not uncommon clinical\ncomplaints. Data accumulated from the various clinical olfactory centers\nindicate that viral upper respiratory infection (URI) is one of, if not the,\nmost common causes of a disordered sense of smell\n(Henkin et al., 1975;\nDeems et al., 1991).\nIn addition, axoplasmic transport along the primary olfactory pathway,\ncomposed of OE, olfactory nerve (ON) and olfactory bulb (OB) is a route of\nentry to the CNS for many neurotropic viruses after intranasal inoculation\n(Tomlinson and Esiri, 1983;\nStroop et al., 1984;\nPerlman et al., 1990;\nLafay et al., 1991;\nBarnett et al., 1993)\nand, in some cases, hematogenous spread\n(Lafay et al.,\n1991).",

In some patients with PVOD biopsies of the mucosa in the\nolfactory area include only respiratory epithelium, which suggests that a very\nlarge proportion of the mucosa has lost its character as olfactory\n(Douek et al., 1975).\nPresumably, the viral infection and/or the host's response to the infection\nhave also destroyed the progenitor cells required for reconstitution of\nsensory neurons. In these cases virally mediated damage and its sequelae have\neffects analogous to the severe, widespread destruction of the OE caused by\nexposure to methylbromide (MeBr) or 3-methylindole (3-MI); some\nolfactotoxin-damaged areas of the OE are reconstituted as respiratory\nepithelium as an apparent consequence of obliteration of the neuroepithelial\nstem cells (Schwob et al.,\n1994,\n1995).",

In animals and in humans newly formed neurons that are\nunable to connect with the OB, either because of bulbectomy\n(Schwob et al.,\n1992), avulsion of the olfactory nerve\n(Schwob et al., 1994)\nor congenital absence of the OB (Schwob\net al., 1993), have an abbreviated lifespan due to\nabsence of the trophic support that is normally supplied by the OB. As a\nresult, newly generated neurons in these settings lack the time to make the\ntransition to a mature phenotype before dying or die shortly thereafter\n(Schwob et al., 1992,\n1993,\n1994). This accelerated\nneuronal turnover has predictable consequences for the cellular composition of\nthe OE: the rate of neurogenesis increases in an attempt to compensate for the\naccentuated loss of neurons, and immature neurons are more numerous and mature\nneurons are sparse in the absence of contact with the bulb, as compared with\nnormal (Schwob et al.,\n1992,\n1993,\n1994). Thus, the\nhistopathological findings in cases of PVOD in which OE is present but\nabnormal are not inconsistent with the notion that viral infection causes a\nform of damage to the olfactory nerve or bulb and that the predominance of\nimmature neurons in the biopsies of the mucosa of some patients with PVOD is a\nconsequence of the accelerated neuronal turnover that accompanies damage to\nthe bulb or nerve.",

Coronaviruses, which are enveloped, positive-strand RNA\nviruses, are the second most common cause of influenza-like symptoms and are a\nnot infrequent cause of cold symptoms, which are the two syndromes associated\nwith viral URI (Larson et al.,\n1980; Sugiura et al.,\n1998). Coronaviruses are known to mutate rapidly in the host and\nexhibit a high frequency of recombination; some strains are neurotropic\n(Holland et al.,\n1982; Holmes and Lai,\n1996). In particular, intranasal inoculation with many strains of\nmouse hepatitis virus (MHV) produces widespread dissemination and damage in\nthe CNS, including the OB and more central parts of the olfactory system\n(Barthold, 1988;\nBarnett and Perlman, 1993). MHV\nis classified in antigenic group II of the coronaviruses, as are some of the\nhuman coronaviruses which cause colds\n(Holmes and Lai, 1996).

The cell line (OBL21A) used to host and propagate the virus was\noriginally generated by avian myc transformation of primary cultures\nof neonatal OB, harvested at a time when progenitor cells in the bulb give\nrise primarily to granule and periglomerular neurons\n(Ryder et al., 1990).\nMHV OBLV was isolated during persistent infection of the host cells with MHV\nJHM when the cytopathic effect of infection shifted from syncytium formation\nto plaque formation at day 60 of passage\n(Ryder et al., 1990).\nWe describe here the extent and severity of damage to olfactory structures\nafter intranasal inoculation with the neurotropic coronavirus MHV OBLV. After\ninoculation MHV OBLV causes minimal disruption of the epithelium directly, but\ncauses very extensive damage to the OB, like other MHV JHM variants. In\ncontrast to other strains, however, damage induced by MHV OBLV is mostly\nlimited to the olfactory system, with few if any animals lost due to\nencephalitis or hepatitis. In addition, we note that changes indicative of\naccelerated neuronal turnover occur in the OE as an apparent reflection of the\ndamage to the bulb. Thus, the paradigm that we report here mimics the\nhistopathological correlates of one form of PVOD in humans and may be a useful\nmodel for understanding the pathogenesis of that form of PVOD.",

There are fewer\nmitral cells overall in the bulbs of MHV OBLV-infected animals\n(Figure 7A,B versus C,D).\nIndeed, mitral cell numbers, determined by direct counts at multiple\ncomparable levels of the bulb, are reduced to 30-70% of control in\nfood-restricted, virally inoculated mice (mean reduction 43 \u00b1 9% of\nnormal; n = 4).

Given the limited extent of epithelial damage\nafter acute inoculation and the rapid clearance of the virus, the subsequent\nshifts in the population of sensory neurons must be an indirect effect that\nreflects disruption of its CNS target rather than persistent infection of the\nOE. In other words, the shift occurs as a consequence of loss of mitral cells\nand/or disconnection of the deeper layers of the bulb from the GL and ONL. The\ncoincident increase in immature sensory neurons, decrease in mature sensory\nneurons and accelerated proliferation of basal cells indicate that neuronal\nturnover is accelerated in the epithelium and thus that neuronal lifespan is\nattenuated (Schwob et al.,\n1992). Based on previous analysis of experimental models of damage\nto the olfactory system, specifically ablation of the OB and avulsion of the\nolfactory nerve, the reduction in neuronal lifespan in the epithelium is most\nlikely the consequence of a decrease in the trophic support supplied by the\nbulb to the sensory neurons, and the most likely cause of that decrease in\ntrophic support is loss of mitral cells and absence of dendrites of the\nsurviving mitral and tufted cells from the GL (Carr and Farbman,\n1992,\n1993;\nSchwob et al.,\n1992).",

Indeed, the more limited shift of the neuronal population\ntowards immaturity after virus inoculation (in comparison with bulb ablation\nor nerve transection) resembles the moderate changes observed in the\nepithelium following manipulations that selectively deplete the mitral cell\npopulation. For example, basal cell proliferation and neuronal cell death are\nincreased in parallel after neonatal transection of the LOT, which causes a\nreduction in the number of mitral cells in the bulb\n(Weiler and Farbman, 1999).\nAfter virus, as after LOT transection, it is likely that the sensory neurons\nreceive some trophic support from the bulb, but at a reduced level. A\npotential source for that support in the inoculated mice is surviving\nperiglomerular neurons, the dendrites of which apparently remain as a\ncomponent of the glomerular neuropil.
