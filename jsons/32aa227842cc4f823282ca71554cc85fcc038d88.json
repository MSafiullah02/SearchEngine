Rising R&D costs of up to $800 million per marketed new pharmaceutical have dramatically reduced the approval of new chemical entities (NCEs). Globalization of diseases like AIDS and SARS has had a definite impact on the economic situation not only in the Western world, but also in developing countries, especially for AIDS in Africa and SARS in Asia. The World Health Organization (WHO) is calling for free anti-tuberculosis (TB) drugs to be made available to people living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). The spread between unmet medical need in large indications (e.g. Alzheimer's disease) and in niche indications (e.g. Huntington disease) and the economic burden to create a blockbuster ($1 billion sales within one year after launch) has created a marketing-driven clinical development of new chemical entities. A paradigm shift has occurred by which developing a new innovative drug by documenting shortterm efficacy, quality and safety rather than long-term efficacy and emphasizing pharmacovilliglance including considerations of health economy within the medical environment a shift that has fundamentally changed and challenged the pharmaceutical industry.",

New individual or conventional prognostic factors may even build up a different understanding in the pathogenesis of a disease and may ameliorate standard treatment to be documented in outcome trials. More than 50% of patients with coronary heart disease (CHD) lack any conventional risk factors (cigarette smoking, diabetes, hyperlipidemia and/or hypertension). 5 Among patients with CHD at least 1 of 4 conventional risk factors was present in 84.6% of women and 80.6% of men. Other non-traditional factors and genetic causes have to be evaluated. Although C-reactive protein (CRP), lipoprotein (A), fibrinogen and homocysteine are associated with vascular risk, their optional use in routine screening and risk stratification remains to be demonstrated. 6 The introduction of CAD risk equivalent categories within the American ATP III Guidelines substantially increases the number of patients eligible for LDL-cholesterol reduction to less than 100 mg/dl from approximately 5 or 6 million to approximately 20 million. More intensive lipid modifying treatment is thus also clearly needed to provide the additional reduction LDL-cholesterol methods for achieving optimal levels in patients with more challenging LDL-cholesterol goals. Prospective observational studies identified low HDL cholesterol as an important independent coronary risk factor. Some rare inborn errors of HDL metabolism cause low HDL cholesterol and premature atherosclerosis. In large, controlled intervention studies, statin and fibrate treatment of patients with increased HDL cholesterol reduced the incidence of coronary events, and in some of these trials, the increase in HDL cholesterol correlated significantly with the decrease of event rates. HDL-associated proteins and lipids exert several potentially anti-atherosclerotic activities. Transgenic over-expression of human apoA-I or ABCA1 genes was shown to inhibit the development or even induce regression of atherosclerosis in atherosclerosis-susceptible animal models.",
