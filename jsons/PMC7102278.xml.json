The advent of broader spectrum beta-lactams and reports on AG toxicity were the basis of the current controversy on combination therapy. Meta-analysis failed to demonstrate improved outcomes in patients treated with antibiotic combinations over those receiving monotherapy [1\u20134] and resulted in a decreased use of combination therapy. However, it remains frequently used in intensive care units (ICUs) due to the theoretical advantages of rapid bacterial killing and extending the spectrum of activity in the era of multidrug-resistant microorganisms.",

A delay in the administration of active antibiotics has been linked to an increased risk of death. AGs exhibit concentration-dependant activity, allowing for maximum efficacy with once-daily, short-duration therapy, which offers the added benefit of decreased toxicity. Moreover, the pharmacologic properties of AGs could be beneficial in the specific subgroup of critically ill patients presenting with ICU-acquired bacteraemia.

These patients would be the most likely to benefit from the enhanced bactericidal activity offered by a beta-lactam-AG combination therapy. Most studies do not support a benefit for combination therapy. The comparison of AG/beta-lactam combination with beta-lactam monotherapy has been the subject of numerous studies and meta-analysis. Paul et al., in 2004, reviewed 7,586 patients from 64 clinical trials [1]. Combination therapy did not prevent the emergence of antimicrobial resistance and did not affect patient outcomes. Acute kidney injuries were mostly found in the combination group. Paul et al. found the same conclusions in another meta-analysis published in 2008 [23]. Furno et al., in 2002, performed a similar meta-analysis focussing mostly on immunocompromised patients [4]. Among 4,795 septic episodes with 1,029 bacteraemias, their conclusions were similar. Safdar et al. found a significant survival advantage with AGs for bacteraemia caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa in comparative non-randomised studies [3] analysed in a meta-analysis. The meta-analysis by Bliziotis et al. concluded that combination therapy lacks benefit with respect to the selection of drug-resistant organisms, superinfection, treatment failure and mortality [2]. Leibovici et al., reviewing all of the previously mentioned meta-analyses, concluded to a lack of interest of the beta-lactam AG combination [24].",

The latter means that it is difficult to relate the difference in efficacy to the AG and not the beta-lactam. Furthermore, the studies mainly used outdated AG administration schedules, such as thrice-daily administration, long treatment duration and lack of serum monitoring. These are related to treatment toxicity, which was counted as treatment failure in many studies. Finally, Bliziotis et al. suggested that once-daily AG therapy combined with a beta-lactam could have a beneficial effect on the development of resistance compared with beta-lactam monotherapy and should be the subject of further research. Recently, a systematic review of randomised trials focussing on the clinical implications of beta-lactam-AG synergy recommended avoiding the routine use of beta-lactam-AG combination therapy. In a subgroup of bacteraemic patients, they did not find any survival advantage for combination therapy [25]. Our study focussed on the most severe patients, i.e. ICU patients with hospital-acquired bacteraemia who need more rapidly active treatment than less severe patients.",

This failure, a major prognostic factor associated with a high mortality, could have biassed our study. Third, we considered a very specific clinical scenario: ICU-acquired bacteraemias. Fourth, except for methicillin-resistant S. aureus, we observed only rarely drug-resistant organisms. However, considering the susceptibility pattern of drug-resistant bacteria now observed in our ICU, this would probably enhance our results. Mostly, treatment with AG permitted to reach an 83% rate of effective bi-therapy instead of only 17% without AG.",
