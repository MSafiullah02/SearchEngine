We highlight the specific age schedule of COVID-19 mortality and its pronounced excess male mortality and we then apply these COVID-19 death rates to world populations, in 2020. Our results underscore that considerable variations exist between world regions, as concerns the potential impact of COVID-19 mortality, because of their demographic structures. When compared to younger countries in Sub-Saharan Africa, the vulnerability to COVID-19 mortality is shown to be 17 times higher in several industrialized countries of East Asia and Europe. There is a high correlation (r\u00b2= .44) between demographic vulnerability to COVID-19 mortality and current COVID-19 death rates.",

Using these, it is possible to estimate the impact of specific demographic structures on the potential mortality of COVID-19, worldwide and provide a detailed demographic picture of the current and potential impact of the pandemic. [7] [8] [9] This paper begins with a description of the recent data that will be used for a disaggregated age analysis of COVID-19 mortality. We also explain how age and sex data can be standardized across countries, and how the resulting age and sex schedules of COVID-19 mortality can be applied to all countries, to assess their respective vulnerability to the pandemic. The next section presents our results: the age and sex death rates attributed to COVID-19, the sex ratio by age of COVID-19 mortality, and the potential impact of COVID-19 mortality on all countries and regions. We conclude with the lessons drawn from our analysis and the unanswered questions that this research brings to light.",

The world life table illustrates that the sex ratio of death rates is indeed greater than 1, and it gradually increases among adults, peaking at 1.6 before age 60. A comparison of the sex ratio of ordinary mortality and that of COVID-19 death rates, computed from our samples, demonstrates similar age schedules of mortality differentials. However, our comparison of series, in Figure 2 , also emphasizes the presence of sex differentials that are unique to COVID-19 mortality.",

Variations of similar magnitude can also be computed by using the World Bank's income levels, with the richest countries being almost seven times more vulnerable to COVID-19 mortality than less developed countries. .
