            "text": "The coronavirus disease COVID-19, a newly emerging infectious pneumonia with unknown causes, was firstly reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China in December 2019. The incidences of COVID-19 were rapidly reported across China because it occurred around the time of the Chinese spring festival. 1 Early epidemiological and clinical studies reported that the majority of patients were middle-aged or elderly individuals, a mean incubation period of 5.2 days (range 0-14 days), and a serial interval of 7.5 days (95% confidence interval [CI] 2-17 days). [2] [3] [4] The most common symptoms were fever, cough, and fatigue. [3] [4] [5] Most of the patients presented the abnormal chest computed tomography (CT) findings such as ground-glass opacity and bilateral patchy shadowing. [4] [5] [6] Patients older than 65 years were more likely to be severe cases and developed severe acute complications such as pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), shock, and acute cardiac injury during treatment. [3] [4] [5] These studies provided essential evidence to guide the early medical screen, diagnosis of COVID-19 cases, isolation of suspected cases, and clinical treatments. However, with the rapid progress of COVID-19 many new characteristics have emerged, which need to augment the evidence. One new feature is that increasing numbers of younger patients were confirmed across China. One study from the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention indicated that 4,168 (9%) of the patients through February 11, 2020 were younger than 30 years. 7 In addition, outbreaks of COVID-19 were reported worldwide. Several countries, such as South Korea, Japan, and Italy, are experiencing a sharp increase in confirmed cases of incident COVID-19. Younger individuals were more likely to be carriers of COVID-19 across countries, since they were more likely to be involved in overseas study, business, work, and travel. For example, in South Korea, 178 out of 431 confirmed cases, which were publicly announced on the website of the Ministry of Health and Welfare, were aged %35 years through March 1, 2020. 8 However, as far as we know no study has been specifically conducted to explore the epidemiological and clinical characteristics in younger patients with COVID-19.",

The most common symptoms at admission were dry cough (34, 81.0%), fever (29, 69.1%), and expectoration (16, 38.1%). Less common symptoms included headache, fatigue, pharyngalgia, chest pain, anorexia, myalgia, dizziness, diarrhea, nausea, and shortness of breath. The common pathological changes seen on chest CT were ground-glass opacity (29, 63.0%) and bilateral patchy shadowing (12, 26.1%). No severe cases were identified among adolescent patients. Compared with young adults, adolescent patients had a lower probability to be asymptomatic (6.3% versus 14.3%). Fewer adolescent patients reported fever, headache, and fatigue. Only 7 (50.0%) adolescent patients showed ground-glass opacity on chest CT compared with 22 (68.8%) in young adults. However, none of these differences reached levels of statistical significance.

In this study, we used patients who provided exact information about exposure time intervals and reported a mean incubation period of 7.2 days (95% CI 5. Our study suggests that person-to-person transmission of COVID-19 can occur rapidly from infected adolescent and young adults to their family contacts. We recorded six family-clustered events of COVID-19 in asymptomatic patients. We estimated the mean serial interval to be 6.5 days (95% CI 2.5-17.4), which is shorter than that (7.5 days, 95% CI 5.3-19.0) estimated from early patients in Wuhan. 2 Most importantly, we estimated the median serial interval to be 1.9 days (95% CI 0.4-6.2), which was still lower than that (4.0 days, 95% CI 3.1-4.9) estimated in a recent modeling study. 11 We provided evidence supporting the transmission of COVID-19 from adolescent and young adult asymptomatic patients to their family or close contacts. In this study, of the four out of 46 patients identified as asymptomatic cases, three were identified as the index patients in their families. The two asymptomatic primary cases had neither symptoms nor chest CT findings during the treatment. One asymptomatic primary case suffered from difficulty breathing, shortness of breath, and chest tightness in the 17 days during treatment. Most importantly, all of their family contacts developed symptoms before the admission date of the asymptomatic index patients. Our findings were consistent with the existing evidence. Rothe et al. first reported that an asymptomatic Chinese woman might be the transmission source for her two German business partners. 12 Tong et al. reported a two-family cluster of COVID-19 patients in Zhejiang Province after each family's primary case contacted an asymptomatic case of COVID-19 from Wuhan. 13 Recently, a similar study has identified a 20-year-old ",

We defined familyclustered events as patients who were the first to develop symptoms in their family (index patient) and whose family members (secondary cases) had a clear contact history with the index patient and had no other potential sources of infection.We used the date of symptom onset to measure the date of illness onset.We defined the serial interval as the time interval from the date of illness onset for the index patient to the date of illness onset for the secondary cases.We used a parametric survival analysis model with gamma distribution to estimate the distribution of serial interval. We further calculated the time interval from the date of symptom onset to the date of the first medical visit using a parametric survival model with Weibull distribution. We finally compared the differences of treatments, days of persistent fever during treatment, days of transformation to negative results by COVID-19 nucleic acid tests during treatment, and prognosis outcomes across different age groups. We compared proportions of categorical variables using the chi-square test and used Fisher's exact test when the minimum expected values for the variables were less than 1. We used independent group t tests to compare means of continuous variables following a normal distribution; otherwise, Mann-Whitney rank tests were used.",

The clinical outcomes (recovered and discharged, continuing treatment, or death) were consistently observed until February 23, 2020. The epidemiological data were input by Epidata 3.0 (The EpiData Association, Odense, Denmark, 2003) with double-checking. To ensure the accuracy of the clinical data, two researchers also independently reviewed the electronic medical records. The criteria of diagnosis for COVID-19 cases were based on the national recommendation of the New Coronavirus Pneumonia Prevention and Control Program (sixth edition). 21 In brief, the throat or lower respiratory tract swab samples were collected and processed at the Department of Clinical Laboratory in the study hospital. The 2019-nCoV RNA were then extracted from the patients who were suspected of having the 2019-nCoV infection. Finally, the throat swabs were placed into a collection tube with 150 mL of virus preservation solution and total RNAwas extracted within 2 h using a respiratory sample RNA isolation kit (Suzhou Tianlong Biotechnology; Roche's COBASZ480).",
