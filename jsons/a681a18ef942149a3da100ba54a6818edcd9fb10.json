Many elective and nonessential surgeries were postponed worldwide in an effort to minimize spread of disease as well as to conserve resources. Our goal with this article is to review current practice guidelines in setting of the COVID-19 pandemic, based on available data and literature. Methods: Websites pertaining to surgical and medical societies, and government agencies were reviewed, along with recently published literature to identify recommendations related to COVID-19 and plastic surgery procedures. Results: Clinical practice modifications are recommended during the pandemic, in outpatient and perioperative settings. Use of personal protective equipment is critical for aerosol generating procedures such as surgery in the head and neck area. Care for trauma and malignancy should continue during the pandemic, however definitive reconstruction could be delayed for select cases. Specific recommendations were made for surgical treatment of cancer, trauma and semiurgent reconstructive procedures based on available data and literature. Conclusion: The risk and benefit of each reconstructive procedure should be carefully analyzed in relation to necessary patient care, minimized COVID-19 spread, protection of health care personnel and utilization of resources. Recommendations in this manuscript should be taken in the context of each institute's resources and prevalance of COVID-19 in the region. It should be emphasized that the guidelines provided are a snapshot of current practices and are subject to change as the pandemic continues to evolve.",

[15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] However, to-date, there is no widely available and effective medical treatment or prevention against COVID-19. Health care personnel (HCP) continue to work at the frontlines, at risk of contracting the disease, while providing care to many patients in need. A recent publication from the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention reported that out of 44,672 COVID-19 cases, 3.8% were HCP. 22 This number was reported be as high as 9% in Italy. 23 In the midst of the pandemic, non-essential procedures have been postponed or deferred in many countries per government recommendations. Almost all surgical disciplines have modified their operative approach in an attempt to off load the health care system. In the United Copyright \u00a9 2020 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

Patients who are positive should be operated in designated operating rooms with a team dedicated to their care. 14, [37] [38] [39] The positive pressure airflow environment of the operating room may enhance the risk of viral transmission, therefore conversion to negativepressure airflow room should be considered. 14 Since the viral pathogen survives on environmental surfaces for extended periods of time, usual cleaning practices may be inadequate and need adjustment. 10, [40] [41] [42] Multi-faceted perioperative infection control will ensure that the patients are appropriately cared while the HCP is protected. 38, 43, 44 (Table 2) Another important step in delivering health care is identification of aerosol-generating procedures (AGPs), where more stringent precautions are advised due to a higher risk of disease transmission to health care personnel.

Evidence shows that cancer patients have a higher risk of contracting COVID-19 and developing severe events related to disease necessitating ICU admission, along with higher mortality rate. 52, 53 Copyright \u00a9 2020 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

Patients for whom surgery is deemed \"non-essential\" are those with chronic problems whose surgery can certainly be delayed without significant harm to the patient or eventual outcome. Although an argument can be made for the need for surgery in some individuals due to pain or functional impairment, the determining principle is that delaying treatment will not significantly alter the eventual outcome. Such conditions are: tendonitis of the hand, wrist, elbow, trigger finger, De Quervain's tendonitis, medial and lateral elbow epicondylitis, nerve compression syndromes and degenerative joint disease. All these patients can be assessed and followed-up with virtual visits and prescribed NSAIDS or oral steroid and placed in splints.",

A definitive mastectomy and/or reconstruction could be performed in a delayed fashion. 54,55 Surgeons should consider only addressing the cancer side, and avoid contralateral operations that might prolong surgery. Delayed and revisional breast reconstruction surgeries are elective and thus should be postponed. 55 Decisions about immediate breast reconstruction are less straightforward since the patient is being brought to the operating room by the breast surgeon. In general, plastic surgeons should err on the side of caution and delay reconstruction. 55 Immediate reconstruction has higher risk of complications compared to mastectomy only, and utilizes additional resources such as PPE, operative time, multiple office visits. Tissue expander or direct to implant reconstruction can be offered on a case-by-case basis after careful evaluation of patient's individual risk factors and a change in future reconstructive options (i.e anticipated radiation therapy). 55 Autologous reconstruction (excluding cases that need wound coverage) should be deferred due to excessive use of resources. 54-56 Skin Cancer Surgical treatment of non-melanoma skin cancers with slow growth rate such as basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and low risk squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) are not regarded as urgent and may be postponed. Surgery can be considered for patients with high risk SCC (>4 cm, deep invasion, perineural invasion, or poor differentiation) 57 , malignancies close to critical anatomical Copyright \u00a9 2020 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

Nonsurgical treatment options for advanced BCC and SCC such as cryotherapy, radical-intent radiotherapy, neoadjuvant use of cemiplimab or vismodegib may be considered as an alternative treatment approach, especially in high risk patients (i.e age>70, presence of comorbidities, immunosuppression). 58-61 Merkel cell carcinoma excisions with/without sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) should not be deferred during the pandemic as delay may cause progression and even distant metastasis. 62 Diagnostic excisional biopsies for suspected melanoma are carried out with intent to remove the clinical lesion. For the biopsy proven malignant melanoma (any thickness) with clear histologic margins or in situ melanoma present at peripheral transection, wide local excision (WLE) can be delayed for up to 3 months. SLNB that is indicated for melanomas thicker than 0.8mm may be delayed for up to 3 months unless a WLE in the OR is planned, in which case SLNB may be performed simultaneously. Therapeutic lymph node dissections can be postponed and nodes kept under surveillance using US, CT, PET and MRI. If clinically palpable lymph nodes are present, neoadjuvant systemic therapy can be offered. In cases of metastatic nodes invading vital structures and those failing systemic therapy, therapeutic lymphadenectomy should be considered 63 .Head and Neck CancerMajority of the head and neck cutaneous and salivary gland malignancies are slow growing and treatment can be delayed for a few weeks or months with limited impact on oncologic outcome. 58 However, oral mucosa cancers, human papilloma virus (HPV) negative oropharyngeal SCC and advanced laryngeal cancer are considered aggressive malignancies and Copyright \u00a9 2020 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

Primary closure, skin grafts, local/regional flaps are preferred to minimize morbidity and mortality that could result from extended operations and prolonged recovery period. Alternative treatment options such as chemotherapy and radiotherapy can be utilized in select cases.[64][65][66] Trauma and Emergency CareAs a result of diminished industrial work and restricted travel, there is reduced volume of acute injuries presenting to Emergency Rooms. Surgery should be performed if delaying the procedure may cause significant harm to the patient, is likely to prolong the hospital stay, or if there is no non-surgical treatment option. Plastic surgeons are frequently consulted for maxillofacial fractures and hand injury, approach to which is discussed in detail below. Other emergency room encounters needing immediate care include 3 rd degree burns, necrotizing soft tissue infections, compartment syndromes and limb threatening injury. 67 Select cases of lower extremity trauma with soft tissue loss may be temporized with vacuum assisted wound therapy until definitive reconstruction. However, majority of open fractures require immediate debridement and adequate soft tissue coverage, especially Gustilo-Anderson Type III fractures which involve extensive soft tissue damage. Vascular repair should not be delayed in Type IIIC fractures. 68-70 Copyright \u00a9 2020 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

Most facial fractures do not require urgent treatment and definitive reconstruction could be postponed. Operative repair of orbital floor fractures can be delayed if",

While the management plan should be at the discretion of the surgeon as to whether open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) is warranted, less invasive procedures such as maxillomandibular fixation using hybrid arch bars should be considered. Hand Surgery American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons recommends that every locality should be making their own decisions based on the prevalance of COVID-19 and the availability of resources and personnel. 68 Semi-urgent cases such as lacerations with tendon or nerve involvement, acute fractures of the hand and wrists, comminuted fractures of the joints should still be performed considering the poor functional outcome if not treated or with a delay in treatment. 72,73 If possible, these procedures should be done in the outpatient setting to minimize utilization of resources.
