Modern sensors typically measure multiple variables over time, resulting in streams of data that can be profitably organized as multivariate time-series. While a major part of recent literature about multivariate time-series focuses on tasks such as forecasting [14, 19, 20] and classification [11, 26] of such data objects, the study of multivariate time-series clustering has often been neglected. The development of effective unsupervised clustering techniques is crucial in practical scenarios, where labeling enough data to deploy a supervised process may be too expensive (i.e., in terms of both time and money). Moreover, clustering allows to discover characteristics of multivariate time series data that go beyond the apriori knowledge on a specific domain, serving as tool to support subsequent exploration and analysis processes.",

Early approaches have been proposed which were generally based on adaptations of standard clustering techniques to such data, e.g., density based methods [3] , methods based on independent component analysis [25] and fuzzy approaches [5, 8] . Recently, Hallac et al. [9] proposed a method, namely TICC (Toeplitz inverse covariance-based clustering), that segments multivariate time series and, successively, clusters subsequences through a Markov Random fields based approach. The algorithm leverages an (EM)-like strategy, based on alternating minimization, that iteratively clusters the data and then updates the cluster parameters. Unfortunately, this method does not produce a clustering solution considering the original time series but a data partition where the unit of analysis is the subsequence.",

Tzirakis et al. [24] recently proposed a segmentation/clustering framework based on agglomerative clustering which works on video data (time series of RGB images). The approach firstly extracts a clustering assignment via hierarchical clustering, then performs temporal segmentation and, finally, extracts representation via Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The clustering assignment is used as pseudo-label information to extract the new representation (training the CNN network) and to perform video segmentation. The proposed approach is specific to RGB video segmentation/clustering and it is not well suited for varying length information. All these factors limit its use to standard multivariate time-series analysis. A method based on Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) has also been recently proposed in [23] . The representation provided by the RNN is clustered using a divergence-based clustering loss function in an end-to-end manner. The loss function is designed to consider cluster separability and compactness, cluster orthogonality and closeness of cluster memberships to a simplex corner. The approach requires training and validation data to learn parameters and choose hyperparameter setting, respectively. Finally, the framework is evaluated on a test set indicating that the approach seems not completely unsupervised and, for this reason, not directly exploitable in our scenario.",

            "text": "In this section we introduce DeTSEC (Deep Time Series Embedding Clustering via Attentive-Gated Autoencoder). Let X = {X i } n i=1 be a multivariate time-series dataset. Each X i \u2208 X is a time-series where X ij \u2208 R d is the multidimensional vector of the time-series X i at timestamp j, with 1 \u2264 j \u2264 T , d being the dimensionality of X ij and T the maximum time-series length. We underline that X can contain time-series with different lengths. The goal of DeTSEC is to partition X in a given number of clusters, provided as an input parameter. To this purpose, we propose to deal with the multivariate time-series clustering task by means of recurrent neural networks [1] (RNN), in order to manage at the same time (i) the sequential information exhibited by time-series data and (ii) the multivariate (multi-dimensional) information that characterizes time-series acquired by real-world sensors. Our approach exploits a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) [4] , a type of RNN, to model the time-series behavior and to encode the original time-series in a new vector embedding representation. DeTSEC has two different stages. In the first one, the GRU based autoencoder is exploited to summarize the time-series information and to produce the new vector embedding representation, obtained by forcing the network to reconstruct the original signal, that integrates the temporal behavior and the multi-dimensional information. Once the autoencoder network has been pretrained, the second stage of our framework refines such representation by taking into account a twofold task, i.e., the reconstruction one and another one devoted to stretch the embedding manifold towards clustering centroids. Such centroids can be derived by applying any centroid-based clustering algorithm (i.e. K-means) on the new data representation. The final clustering assignment is derived by applying the K-means clustering algorithm on the embeddings produced by DeTSEC. Figure 1 visually depicts the encoder/decoder structure of DeTSEC, consisting of three different components in our network architecture: i) an encoder, ii) a backward decoder and iii) a forward decoder. The encoder is composed by two GRU units that process the multivariate time series: the first one (in red) processes the time-series in reverse order (backward) while the second one (in green) processes the input time-series in the original order (forward). Successively, for each GRU unit, an attention mechanism [2] is applied to combine together the information coming from different timestamps. Attention mechanisms are widely used in automatic signal processing [2] (1D signal or Natural Language Processing) as they allow to merge together the information extracted by the RNN model at different timestamps via a convex combination of the input sources. The attention formulation we used is the following one: The network has three main components: i) an encoder, ii) a forward decoder and iii) a backward decoder. The encoder includes forward/backward GRU networks. For each network an attention mechanism is employed to combine the sequential information. Subsequently, the gating mechanism combines the forward/backward information to produce the embedding representation. The two decoder networks have similar structure: the forward decoder reconstructs the original signal considering its original order (forward -green color) while the backward decoder reconstructs the same signal but in inverse order (backward -red color).

All datasets, except RemSensing -which was obtained contacting the authors of [10] -are available online 2 . The characteristics of the six datasets are reported in Table 1 . Clustering performances were evaluated by using two evaluation measures: the Normalized Mutual Information (NMI) and Adjusted Rand Index (ARI) [21] . The NMI measure varies in the range [0, 1] while the ARI measure varies in the range [\u22121, 1]. These measures take their maximum value when the clustering partition completely matches the original one, i.e., the partition induced by the available class labels. Due to the non deterministic nature of all the clustering algorithms involved in the evaluation, we run the clustering process 30 times for each configuration, and we report average and standard deviation for each method, benchmark and measure. DeTSEC is implemented via the Tensorflow python library. For the comparison, we set the size of the hidden units in each of the GRU networks (forward/backward -encoder/decoder) to 64 for BasicM, ECG benchmarks and 512 for AUSLAN, JapVowel, ArabicDigits, RemSensing benchmarks. This difference is due to the fact that the former group includes datasets with limited number of samples that cannot be employed to efficiently learn recurrent neural networks with too many parameters. To train the model, we set the batch size equal to 16, the learning rate to 10 \u22124 and we use the ADAM optimizer [12] to learn the parameters of the model. The model are trained for 300 epochs: in the first 50 epochs the autoencoder is pre-trained while in the remaining 250 epochs the model is refined via clustering loss. Experiments are carried out on a workstation equipped with an Intel(R) Xeon(R) E5-2667 v4@3.20 GHz CPU, with 256 GB of RAM and one TITAN X GPU. Table 2 reports on the performances of DeTSEC and the competing methods in terms of NMI and ARI. We can observe that DeTSEC outperforms all the other methods on five datasets over six. The highest gains in performance are achieved on speech and activity recognition datasetes (i.e., JapVowel, ArabicDigits, AUS-LAN and BasicM ). On such benchmarks, DeTSEC outperforms the best competitors of at least 8 points (AUSLAN ) with a maximum gap of 45 points on ArabicDigits. Regarding the EGC dataset, we can note that best performances are obtained by K-Means and DEC. However, it should be noted that also in this case DeTSEC outperforms the competitors specifically tailored to manage multivariate time-series data (i.e., DTW and SOFTDTW ). Table 3 reports on the comparison between DeTSEC and its ablations. It can be noted how there is not a clear winner resulting from this analysis. DeTSEC obtains the best performance (in terms of NMI and ARI) on two benchmarks (ArabicDigits and BasicM ), while DeTSEC noGate and DeTSEC noBack appear to be more suitable for other benchmarks (even if the performances of DeTSEC remain always comparable to the best ones). For instance, we can observe that DeTSEC noGate achieves the best performances on ECG. This is probably due to the fact that this ablation requires a lower number of parameters to learn, and this can be beneficial for processing datasets with a limited number of samples, timestamps and dimensions.

The DTW method ( Fig. 2(b) ) retrieves the cluster involving the blue points, on the left side of the figure, but it can be noted how all the other classes still remain mixed up. SC produces a better representation than the previous two cases but it still exhibits some issue to recover the four cluster structure: the green and black examples are slightly separated but some confusion is still present while the red and blue examples lie in a very close region (a fact that negatively impacts the discrimination between these two classes). Conversely, DeTSEC is able to stretch the data manifold producing embeddings that visually fit the underlying data distribution better than the competing approaches, and distinctly organize the samples according to their inner cluster structure. To sum up, we can underline that explicitly managing the temporal autocorrelation leads to better performances regarding the clustering of multivariate time-series of variable length. Considering the benchmarks involved in this work, DeTSEC exhibits a general better behavior with respect to the competitors when the benchmark contains enough data to learn the model parameters. This is particularly evident when speech or activity recognition tasks are considered. In addition, the visual inspection of the generated embedding representation is in line with the quantitative results and it underlines the quality of the proposed framework.",
