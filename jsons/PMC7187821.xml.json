This is not because other health threats stopped to be pressing. As an example the number of preventable cancers, not least tobacco-induced cancer continues to be very substantial (according to the WHO 27% of all cancers in the WHO European Region are attributed to tobacco use). As difficult as it may be to tackle the problems of cancer prevention by tobacco control, significant improvements are within our manageable control.",

The history is fast-paced. In December 2019 a cluster of cases of severe pneumonia were reported from Wuhan, China. The disease was soon recognized to be caused by coronavirus. Since then, COVID-19 (Corona virus disease 2019), caused by SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) has developed into a full blown pandemic. At the end of January 2020 the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) [1]. The outbreak reached Europe on January 24th\n[2] and on March 11th the WHO declared COVID-19 as a pandemic [1]. As of April 20 the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control reported 947 693 cases in the EU/EEA and the UK and 99 232 related deaths have occurred [3]. The number of unreported cases, at least for SARS-CoV-2 infection, is estimated to be significantly higher. Unfortunately, how much higher is currently unknown due but not limited to the fact that there is a shortage of RNA based infection tests, and a lack of validated serological tests.",

The political, medical and public response showed enormous heterogeneity worldwide, varying considerably over time during the crisis. Not only did science react with unprecedented speed. To fight the pandemic we also rely fundamentally on the expertise from physicians and scientists from fields that are often \u2013 and as we now clearly see, wrongly - far away from the public eye.",

The authors emphasize that the measures taken must be seen in the context of the different phases of the COVID outbreak and that the situation will differ from country to country [4].",

Our journal publishes letters, ad hoc guidelines, original papers and review papers, which will help the field of radiation oncology to deal with the crisis. To speed up dissemination, within days after acceptance COVID-19 articles will be published online as pre-proofs prior to normal online and print publication in an issue. But, most importantly the articles will be compiled in a freely accessible virtual issue on the journal homepage entitled \u201cCOVID 19 Rapid Communications\u201d. We strongly feel that the enormous stress both on the health care system and on our health care workers mandates that scientific journals cater to the daily needs of the profession through rapid dissemination of experience gained and emerging data.",

To this end, we have introduced a document heading \u201cCOVID Rapid Communications\u201d or \u201cCOVID Rapid Letters\u201d to allow the readers to easily recognize these articles and to assess them with the necessary precaution until sufficient scientific evidence has been gathered.",
