The most common pathogens are enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli,Cryptosporidium parvum, rotavirus, and coronavirus. However, mixed etiology is common in field conditions, and attempts to distinguish between agents can be unrewarding. If left untreated, dehydration subsequent to scours can lead to decreased appetite, electrolyte and metabolic imbalances, and increased susceptibility to secondary disease. Although antimicrobial and other ancillary therapy may be warranted in calves showing systemic illness (Constable, 2009; Smith, 2015), the mainstay of treatment entails addressing losses of fluids and electrolytes.",

However, administration is time consuming, invasive, and requires a relatively high level of employee training and skill. Oral rehydration therapy (ORT) has been a long accepted alternative to i.v. fluid therapy. Extensive variability is present in ORT products on the market, and thus products should not be assumed to be equally effective in rehydrating and correcting electrolyte and acid-base imbalances. Current recommendations state that an ORT product should meet the following criteria (Smith, 2009): supply sufficient sodium to normalize the extracellular fluid volume; provide agents (glucose, citrate, acetate, and so on) to facilitate absorption of sodium and water from the intestine; provide an alkalinizing agent (acetate, propionate, or bicarbonate) to correct or maintain acid-base status; and provide energy, because most calves that have diarrhea are in a negative energy balance.",

If this commercially available product is comparable to i.v. fluid therapy in treatment of diarrheic, moderately dehydrated calves, use of the product instead of i.v. therapy would be beneficial to the beef and dairy calf raising industry. This could give producers a viable, less labor-intensive option that helps achieve all of the goals of successful calf diarrhea and dehydration management. The null hypothesis was that i.v. fluids would be more effective than an oral supplement in rehydrating and maintaining acid/base and electrolyte balance in diarrheic calves. The objective of this study was to compare the efficacy of a nutritional supplement ORT to i.v. administered lactated Ringer's solution (LRS) in rehydrating, maintaining acid-base balance, and limiting electrolyte derangements in moderately dehydrated, diarrheic calves.",

Enrollment of 24 calves allowed for maintaining a power of 0.8 despite loss of follow-up due to death or withdrawal of 8 observational periods. The study was designed as a crossover with a 7-d washout period between study periods. Calves were initially divided into 2 groups. One group underwent induction and treatment (first trial period), whereas the other group remained unenrolled. Upon completion of the first study period, the second group underwent induction and treatment (second study period), whereas the first group completed a washout period. Calves in the first group then re-enrolled for the third study period, whereas the second group was in washout. Due to health complications (some related to study protocol and others not), not all calves were able to participate in the period in which they were initially intended to be enrolled. In those cases, the calf was eligible for enrollment in the next study period following resolution of health issues. This resulted in modifications from a true crossover design, and necessitated a fifth study period. Calves within a group were initially blocked by BW, then randomly assigned to treatment for their first trial period. Each calf was then enrolled in the opposite treatment for its subsequent period. In general, calves underwent 2 study periods, one for each treatment. However, 4 calves were used in 3 study periods. When this was the case, assignment of the calf to the treatment group for the third treatment was done randomly.",

A hypertonic solution of milk replacer and sucrose was fed to all calves enrolled in the induction phase. Commercial milk replacer (Nutra blend 22-20, Nutra Blend LLC, Neosho, MO; the same as used throughout the study) was prepared according to directions, then mixed 1:1 with a 20% sucrose solution. The sucrose-milk replacer mixture was fed at a volume of approximately 5% BW per feeding (twice a day), delivering approximately 5 g/kg of sucrose per feeding, in addition to half-strength milk replacer. Frequency of feeding the hypertonic mixture was done as needed to induce and maintain acceptable fecal scores. Fecal character was subjectively assessed by an investigator (either JT or TS) before each feeding, and if fecal scores of the group as a whole were deemed adequately loose (watery, with little to no firm material in a pen), standard milk replacer solution was fed at approximately 5% of BW per feeding. If many stools visible in the pen had a more normal consistency, the 20% sucrose solution was added 1:1 to milk replacer. Administration of sucrose was continued, as needed, throughout the treatment period and fecal consistency was allowed to return to normal only after the final treatment had been administered. Hydrochlorothiazide (1 mg/kg, orally) and spironolactone (2 mg/kg, orally) were administered every 8 h during induction, until the calf was classified as adequately dehydrated and enrolled in treatment. Once a calf was enrolled, administration of diuretics was ceased. The hydration status of calves was monitored each evening. Calves were enrolled either 24 or 48 h after initiation of the dehydration protocol, based upon the cumulative assessment of BW loss (targeting approximately 7%), moderate skin tenting, recession of eye globe within the orbit, and mild to moderate depression. Assessment was done by a single investigator (MR). Calves that were not adequately dehydrated 48 h after initiation of the trial period were excluded from that period.",

The most extreme and notable response to the protocol was observed in BW. Calves demonstrated an average of 7.9% decrease in BW from the time of initiation of the induction protocol to enrollment for treatment. However, an extremely wide range of BW change was observed (from a 3% increase to a 14% decrease). Many factors can contribute to relatively rapid changes in BW, including alterations in gut fill and prior hydration status. Change in gut fill almost assuredly influenced the most extreme observations, as a 13% loss of BW solely or primarily attributable to fluid loss would result in severe dehydration and likely death. Similarly, the weight gain observed in a very small number of calves could simply reflect an accumulation of fluid in the bowels due to the hyperosmolar environment and before onset of severe diarrhea. This is in no small part a byproduct of the chosen induction protocol and would not be expected in natural disease. Recognizing these limitations, BW was not the only parameter measured to assess hydration status. Subjective dehydration scores increased from a median of 1 before induction of dehydration to a median of 3 before treatment. This was on a scale of 0 to 9, but included mentation, which by design, should have never increased above 1. Other parameters, including PCV, total protein, bicarbonate, and base excess, were also significantly different from baseline after the induction protocol and before enrollment for treatment, all in a manner consistent with dehydration. Moreover, these same parameters were significantly different following treatment compared with before initiating treatment, confirming success of both treatment approaches in addressing the dehydration and metabolic derangements. Treatment effectively returned bicarbonate, base excess, and PCV to values not significantly different from the initial baseline. Body weight remained significantly lower after treatment than baseline (P = 0.001) when all calves were examined; however, the LRS group was not significantly different from baseline 1 d after completion of the trial (P = 0.07). Body weight 1 d after completion of the trial was significantly higher than after induction protocol and before treatment began (P < 0.0005). Total protein was also lower than baseline following treatment (P < 0.0005). This may reflect loss of serum protein through the diarrheal process, consumption/decay of passively acquired antibodies, or may simply reflect dehydration that was present before the induction process that was corrected with treatment. This last consideration cannot be overlooked, as previous and concurrent natural challenge by various infectious agents could have contributed to some degree of initial dehydration, particularly for early study periods. This is supported by the fact that some calves were deemed too ill to include in their initially planned period, and were retained and treated to include in a later period when they had recovered. Some such affected calves remained in protocol, as they met the moderately dehydrated, standing, and suckling criteria. No uneven distribution of ill calves existed between the 2 treatment groups. Only 2 calf mortalities occurred while enrolled in a trial period, one due to a clostridial abomasitis presumably induced by the supra-physiologic sucrose intake, and the second resulting from severe dehydration and failure to adequately respond to treatment. Although the intention was to elicit only a moderate dehydration, the mortality caused by the induction protocol confirms the physiologic burden placed upon the calves by the induction process.",

            "text": "In addition to correcting dehydration, a major objective of treatment for scouring calves is maintaining appropriate acid-base status. Significant changes in serum bicarbonate values and base excess show that both treatments were successful in reversing the mild metabolic imbalance. Metabolic acidosis secondary to scours results from a combination of factors. These include fecal loss of bicarbonate, decreased tissue perfusion and hypoxia leading to anaerobic glucose metabolism and subsequent l-lactate production, decreased renal efficiency in excretion of excess hydrogen ions, as well as d-lactate and l-lactate absorption from increased bacterial fermentation of nutrients in the distal gut (Kasari, 1999). Maintenance of acid-base balance is critical in treating calves with scours due to the association of acidemia with depression and loss of suckle, as well as hypothermia, shock, and coma, if severe (Naylor, 1999). In general, calves in the study did not develop acidemia, as indicated by calculated base excess or bicarbonate values. Nonetheless, both treatments served to assist in maintaining these parameters within normal range, including facilitating statistically significant changes from initiation to conclusion of treatment. Unresolved acidemia in scouring calves is associated with depression, loss of suckle, and recumbency (Kasari and Naylor, 1986; Nakagawa et al., 2007). For an orally administered product to be effective and practical, a suckle reflex must be present; therefore, it is imperative that metabolic acidosis be mild and quickly controlled for ORT to be a treatment option. Results reported here support the appropriateness of both treatments in preventing acidemia, as all calves except for one that died retained strength and ability to stand and suckle throughout the treatment periods.",

This may lead to questions regarding the appropriateness of comparing the 2 approaches. The study design attempted to account for several considerations which make the difference in volumes appropriate. First, it was important to follow manufacturer's recommendations for the nutritional supplement. Second, we sought to be consistent with practices in the field for either therapy. Intravenous fluid therapy is primarily used in the field for calves more severely affected than those in our study. However, large calf ranches often prefer to use i.v. fluids as a first-line treatment under the assumption it is more effective than orally administered products. Even in these situations, i.v. treatment is typically only feasible once a day. The study protocol reflected this limitation. Similarly, administration of more than 2 L in a short period of time would pose a risk of fluid overload, particularly in hypoproteinemic calves. Volume overload via oral administration is much less likely to occur, and is almost inconceivable with a balanced electrolyte product such as used in this report. Moreover, absorption of fluids from the gut will be less than 100%, particularly in the face of diarrheal disease. Thus, a larger volume is justified for oral treatment, as compared with i.v.",

This is beneficial in reducing the acidosis typical in scouring calves, whereas 0.9% sodium chloride provides a strong cation-anion ratio that exerts an acidifying effect. Although other commercially available products provide slightly higher sodium content along with metabolizable bases, the difference is generally deemed clinically insignificant with no distinction between products such as LRS, Normosol R (Pfizer, New York, NY), or Plasma-Lyte (Baxter, Deerfield, IL). Although there is limited evidence comparing the efficacy of these balanced solutions, currently little clinical difference is seen between them (Noritomi et al., 2011).

Despite the relatively large volume of fluids [\u223c4 quarts (3.8 L) of milk replacer and 6 quarts (5.7 L) of supplement] being offered over only a 14-h interval, refusal or loss of appetite never necessitated administration of milk or supplement via esophageal feeder.

This would seem to demonstrate that dehydrated calves will voluntarily consume a relatively large volume of fluids, and concerns of refusal or need to administer via esophageal feeder are unjustified.
