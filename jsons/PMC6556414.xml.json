Through non-specific binding, it acts as a chaperone protein, partially protecting the viral nucleic acids (NAs).18 During reverse transcription, NC directs the annealing of cellular tRNA(Lys,3) primer to the HIV-1 primer binding site, thus initiating the synthesis of the (\u2212)-strong stop DNA.19, 20 NC then facilitates the two strand transfers required for (\u2212) and (+) strand synthesis. It is also implicated to be a vital element in vDNA integration.21, 22 Prior to encapsidation, NC discriminates viral from host NA by selectively binding to the HIV-1 \u03a8-encapsidation signal sequence.23, 24, 25 In addition, in vitro studies have shown that NC may chaperone the dimerization of the two copies of HIV-1 viral genomic RNA by rearranging the kissing complex into an extended duplex through a series of stabilizing and destabilizing events, an important step prior to encapsidation.26, 27\n",

Moreover, all of the fleximer bases were able to establish a network of H-bond interactions with the backbone atoms of key residues in the hydrophobic pocket (i.e. K33, G35, W37, and M46, Fig. 3A\u2013D) that is highly comparable to that established by the guanine base (Fig. 3E).

A starter culture of 20 ml of ZB58 inoculated from a single colony was grown at 37 \u00b0C overnight. The starter culture was added to 2 l of M9ZB58 supplemented with 0.1 mM ZnCl2 and grown at 37 \u00b0C to an absorbance at 600 nm of 0.5 to 0.6 before induction with 1 mM IPTG (isopropyl-\u03b2-d-thiogalactopyranoside). After three hours, the cells were harvested by centrifugation, resuspended in 30 ml of lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 10% (v/v) glycerol, 0.1 M NaCl, 0.1 mM ZnCl2, 5 mM dithiothreitol, 2 mM EDTA), and stored at 70 \u00b0C.

The cells were sonicated by five bursts of 20 seconds to reduce the viscosity. The nucleic acids were precipitated by adding 4% (w/v) polyethyleneimine (pH 7.9) dropwise to a final concentration of 0.4% and stirred for 15 minutes before centrifugation at 23,000 g for 30 minutes at 4 \u00b0C.
