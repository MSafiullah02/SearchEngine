For the case in which the test returns a false result with finite probability, we propose Bayesian inference and a corresponding belief propagation (BP) algorithm to identify the infected patients from the results of tests performed on the pool. We show that the true-positive rate is improved by taking into account the credible interval of a point estimate of each patient. Further, the prevalence and the error probability in the test are estimated by combining an expectation-maximization method with the BP algorithm. As another approach, we introduce a hierarchical Bayes model to identify the infected patients and estimate the prevalence. By comparing these methods, we formulate a guide for practical usage.",

Because of limitations in the number of available devices, reagents, and technologists, a high demand exists for more efficient methods of testing. Group testing is one of the approaches for the reduction of the operating costs by performing tests on pools of specimens obtained from patients [1, 2] . It is known that with the assumption that the rate of the infected patients in the population is sufficiently small, in principle, one can identify the infected patients from the tests on pools whose number is smaller than that of the population. Originally, group testing was developed for blood testing during World War II, and is now applied to various fields such as quality control in product testing [3] , estimation of the content of genetically mutated organisms in maize grains [4] , and multiple access communication [5] .",

Further, group testing can be regarded as a variant of compressed sensing [7, 8] with discrete variables and logical sums. Hence, the progress in the last decade in sparse estimation including compressed sensing has revived interest in group testing, and information-theory approaches have achieved bound evaluation of group testing at a limiting case [9, 10] .",

In practice, clinical testing sometimes results in errors even when the operation is precise. For example, in PCR tests, false negative probabilities of up to 3% and false positive (FP) probabilities of up to 5% have been observed [14] . Moreover, the bacterial or viral load in the specimen depends on the specimen collection method and timing [15] . Therefore, a specimen sometimes does not contain a sufficient amount of the pathogen to exceed the detection limit, even when the patient is infected. Further, post-collection contamination of pathogens into a specimen can cause a positive result even when the patient is not infected. Statistical inference can contribute to the correction of errors by estimating the true state of patients from noisy test data, and quantifying the credibility of the estimation.",

The BP+EM algorithm consists of a double loop, namely the E-step for BP and the M-step for updating\u03c1. In the HBP algorithm, the messages and the estimator are updated at the same time. The difference between these update rules influences the computational time. Fig.12 (a) and Fig.13 (a) show N-dependence of the bias for the BP+EM and HBP algorithm at \u03b1 = 0.5, \u03c1 = 0.05, p TP = 0.99, p FP = 0.01 (Fig.12) , and \u03b1 = 0.5, \u03c1 = 0.05, p TP = 0.95, p FP = 0.05 (Fig.13 ). In these algorithms, the same 100-realization of X 0 , F, and Y were used for comparing these methods. The mean of the beta distribution is given by a/(a + b); hence, the mean of the hyperprior at a = 0.5, b = 0.95 matches the true value of \u03c1. BP+EM and HBP at a = 0.5, b = 0.95 show almost the same dependency on N in bias. When a and b are not chosen to match the mean of the hyperprior, bias becomes large in finite N, but the difference in biase vanishes as N \u2192 \u221e. Fig.12 (b) and Fig.13 (b) show N-dependence of the computation time, where we fixed our experimental environment to use a single 3.5 GHz Intel Core i7 CPU. The computational time of the HBP algorithm is less than that of the BP+EM algorithm, and this priority stands out for the high-noise case, which is obvious from the comparison between Fig.12 (b) and Fig.13 (b) .",

Our approach used bootstrap distribution to estimate the interval. The unknown parameters in the model, in particular prevalence, can be estimated using the EM method and hierarchical Bayes modeling. We compared these method and formulated a guide for practical usage.",
