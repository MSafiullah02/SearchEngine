            "text": "Cervical cancer (CaCx) is strongly associated with human papillomavirus (HPV) infection, particularly HPV types 16 and 18. The constitutive expression of HPV E6 and E7 proteins in CaCx makes them attractive targets for CTL based immunotherapy. However cervical carcinomas may have features, e.g., antigen processing defects, that limit the effectiveness of HPV specific CTL. Furthermore most vaccine development has concentrated on HPV type 16, and it is not clear whether such vaccines could induce CTL able to cross-react on related oncogenic HPV types, e.g., HPV31 and 52. To investigate these potentially important parameters in vitro, we used a CTL (D4) specific for HPV16 E7 11-20 . D4 was able to kill a variety of HPV16\u0609 CaCx cell lines including those with suspected (CaSki) or known antigen processing defects (C33A), and with low HPV DNA copy number (SiHa). D4 was also able to cross react on a related peptide from HPV52 E7 but not HPV31 E7. Further analysis suggested that D4 cross reactivity against related peptides was influenced both by TCR contact residues and a certain threshold for peptide binding. The HPV cross-reactivity was confirmed at the whole protein level as D4 was also able to recognize the endogenously processed forms of HPV16 and 52 E7 but not 31 E7. These results suggest that HPV16 E7 11-20 would be a useful epitope for immunotherapy in both HPV 16 and 52 tumours. Despite this, it is difficult to generate these CTL in response to vaccination, emphasizing the need for definition of novel epitopes and more efficient vaccination strategies.",

There are 11 HPV types that are consistently classified as high-risk types: 16, 18, 31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52, 56 and 58.

According to M\u00fbnoz et al., 95% of all infections were caused by 8 types: 16, 18, 45, 31, 33, 52 , 58 and 35. They suggest that vaccination against the 5 most common types could prevent 90% of cases of CaCx. 5 The geographical variation of HPV prevalence 6 shows that the target population, i.e., the population bearing the highest burden of CaCx, requires the incorporation of other HPV types, other than the commonly occurring 16 and 18, into vaccine design.",

            "text": "Peptide binding studies were carried out as described previously by Nijman et al. 18 Briefly T2 cells were washed before incubating with peptide overnight in TCM at 37\u00b0C in 5% CO 2 . The cells were then stained with MA2.1, a hybridoma supernatant specific for HLA-A*0201, at 4\u00b0C for 20 min. The cells were washed twice in cold 0.1% FCS/PBS before FITC-labeled rabbit anti-mouse IgG (Dakocytomation, Ltd., Denmark House, Ely, Cambridgeshire, UK) at a 1:20 dilution was added for a further 20 min at 4\u00b0C. The The fluorescence ratio was calculated as follows: Mean fluorescence experimental sample/Mean fluorescence of background. To measure the stability of the peptide/MHC interaction we used a modification of the method described by Feltkamp et al. 19 Briefly, 1\u03eb10 6 T2 cells were incubated with 100 g/ml of peptide and 5 g/ml B 2 microglobulin (Sigma-Aldrich) overnight at 37\u00b0C, 5% CO 2 . Cells were then washed in TCM, resuspended in 1 ml TCM and returned to the incubator. An aliquot was taken at this point and then subsequently after 2, 4 and 6 hr and stained as above for levels of HLA-A*0201 expression over time. [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] can kill several cervical carcinoma cell lines including those with antigen processing defects unlike CTL against HPV16 E6 29 -38 Two different CTL clones were used to investigate the effect of antigen processing defects and HPV DNA copy number on the susceptibility of carcinoma cells to be lysed. D4 was specific for HPV16 E7 11-20 9 while 7E7 was specific for HPV16 E6 29 -38 . 15 The ability of D4 to recognize the HLA-A*0201 E7 11-20 peptide is shown by its ability to lyse C1R-A2 transfectants pulsed with the peptide (Fig. 1a) . D4 can also recognize the peptide in the endogenous form when presented by the HLA-A*0201\u03e9, HPV16 transformed cell line CaSki (Fig. 1a) . Western blot analysis carried out in our laboratory 15 has shown that CaSki has low levels of the antigen processing and presenting molecules LMP 2 and 7, and TAP 1 and 2. Killing of CaSki cells by D4 therefore suggests the generation of this epitope is not limited by low level expression of these proteins. This is further supported by the data observed with the C33A cells. Western blot analysis has shown these cells to have almost undetectably low levels of LMP 2 and 7 and TAP 1 and 2. 15 Once these cells have been transfected to express HPV 16 E6 and E7 they are recognized and lysed by D4. This is in contrast to the activity of 7E7. This clone is unable to kill CaSki cells in 51 Cr release assays unless the cells have been pulsed with exogenous peptide (Fig. 1b) . This suggests that generation of this epitope may be limited by antigen processing defects in CaSki cells, despite the report that CaSki has 200 copies of the HPV genome. 20 This is supported by the results seen with the C33A HPV16 cells. These cells, which have low levels of the molecules involved in antigen processing and presentation, are not killed by 7E7.",

In chromium release assays, it can be seen that D4 has the ability to kill C1R-A2 targets pulsed with a range of doses of HPV16 E7 11-20 (YMLD- LQPETT, 0.1-100 g/ml, Fig. 2) . D4 was also able to kill targets pulsed with a range of doses of the HPV52 E7 11-20 peptide (YILDLQPETT, Fig. 2 ). The level of lysis at high peptide doses, 100 and 10 g/ml were comparable to that seen with the HPV16 peptide. At concentrations below 10 g/ml however the level of lysis was greatly reduced, although significant lysis was still observed. However C1R-A2 targets pulsed with the HPV31 E7 11-20 peptide (YVLDLQPEAT, Fig. 2 ), were not killed regardless of the peptide dose.

Peptides with simultaneous substitutions at positions 2 and 9 abolished CTL recognition (HPV31, analogue 52/31) and further reduced peptide binding. The results with HPV16 E7 11-20 P9, where there is no CTL recognition despite peptide binding, suggest that position 9 acts primarily as a TCR contact residue; there is no CTL recognition of any of the peptides with changes at this residue (HPV31, analogue 52/31 and HPV16 E7 11-20 P9 ). Therefore the lack of recognition of HPV31 E7 11-20 by HPV16 E7 [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] CTL is due to effects on both TCR contact residues and peptide binding. However the conservative amino acid difference at position 2 in HPV52 allows cross-reactivity.",

In contrast, 7E7, which was generated against HPV16 E6 29 -38 , was unable to kill any cell line unless pulsed exogenously with peptide or infected with TA-HPV to increase levels of endogenous antigen. Although precise levels of endogenous antigen could not be quantitated in the CaSki and SiHa lines, it is likely to be low for both. A recent study has suggested that despite difference in DNA copy number, HPV gene expression is similarly low in both these cell lines. 22 Nevertheless these results suggest the D4 epitope would be more useful in a vaccine as it generates CTL capable of killing targets expressing endogenous HPV antigens.",

This peptide from HPV 16, 31 and 52 is very similar with changes only at anchor positions 2 and 9. The change of M to I at position 2 seen in the 52 sequence did not result in a loss of recognition at high peptide doses (\u03fe10 g/ml). Reduced, but still significant recognition was seen at peptide doses lower than this. However altering the amino acids at position 2 and 9 as seen in the HPV31 peptide resulted in an abolition of recognition. By generating a synthetic analogue of the HPV16 peptide (YMLDLQ-PEAT), we were able to demonstrate that the amino acid at position 9 is vital to peptide recognition by D4. Using a crude measurement of a peptide binding to HLA-A*0201, we were able to show that the lack of recognition is not due to a loss in the ability to bind to the HLA molecule and be presented but is due to conformational change affecting recognition by the TCR. Cross reactivity at the peptide level is not of importance unless the cross reactive epitopes are produced endogenously. We demonstrate that this is the case following transfection of the cervical epithelial cell line C33A to express full length E7 of HPV types 16 and 52.",

Our previous work has shown the presence (at low frequency) of CTL to HPV16 E7 [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] in the blood of both patients with cervical cancer 8 and CIN3. 9 Our current results suggest that CTL to the E7 11--20 epitope would be useful for immunotherapy as CTL produced by in vitro stimulation protocols are effective against targets expressing endogenous antigen. This has been confirmed independently in a recent study by Schruers et al. 29 who used DC pulsed with a modified HPV16 E7 11-20 peptide (YMLDLQPETV) to generate CD8\u03e9 CTL clones from healthy donors. The clones killed targets expressing exogenous and endogenously processed E7 epitope presented either by CaSki cells or a cell line derived from an HPV16 positive biopsy of an HLA-A*0201 positive individual.",

The affect of amino acid substitutions in the E7 peptides on binding to HLA-A*0201 and the stability of this bond was assessed in a peptide binding assay using the antigen processing defective cell line T2. These cells have low levels of surface HLA-A*0201, which increases when a peptide binds stably.",
