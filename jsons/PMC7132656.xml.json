Questions focused on specific airborne isolation capacity and perceptions of adequacy during routine management of endemic respiratory infections. Hospitals that received the survey were 43 primarily free-standing children's hospitals. SurveyMonkey (www.SurveyMonkey.com) was utilized and some hospitals not responding were directly contacted and interviewed by telephone. The University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences Institutional Review Board waived the consent requirement for this survey.",

Nine of 26 hospitals (35%) reported having a separate waiting area for those with suspected respiratory infections. All hospitals reported at least 1 airborne isolation room in the ED with the median number being 5 (12.7%) of total ED beds. Nearly all of the hospitals (25 out of 26) had airborne isolation rooms (median, 4 rooms) with negative pressure capabilities. A majority of respondents (17 of 25; 68%) reported that all airborne isolation rooms either vented directly outdoors or utilized high efficiency particulate air filters for vented air, but 3 respondents were unsure of what technology was used and 1 did not respond. The number of ante-rooms attached to an airborne isolation room ranged from 0-4, with 61% of facilities reporting 0 ante-rooms. Twenty-one of 26 respondents (81%) reported a positive level of confidence that the number of isolation beds was adequate for their needs on a routine basis. Finally, hospitals reported an average of 7 years since the ED underwent its last major renovation.",

Conversely, an 18-hour wait in a general waiting room led to a city outbreak of 300 cases, 77% of which were hospital-acquired. These authors argue that negative isolation (ie, airborne isolation) rooms should be a requirement for all hospital ED rooms.7 Two studies examined existing ED capacity for this requirement. In the United Kingdom, only 24% of hospitals had isolation rooms and of those only 61% had independent ventilation.8 In a wider European study of EDs and medical admission departments from hospital referral centers for highly infectious diseases, 82.9% had isolation rooms, 50% of which had negative isolation, and 29.3% had high-efficiency particulate air filters for exhausted air.9\n",

Although 81% of respondents believed their respiratory isolation capacities were adequate, it is uncertain how these facilities would contain pandemic respiratory disease. Another concern arises with 16 of 26 facilities reporting no ante-rooms in the ED. This deficiency was highlighted by the assessment of capability needed for Ebola virus disease suspects because current guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention call for doffing space or ante-rooms.10 This study has several limitations, including being a convenience sample. Also, data were collected in 2012, so it may not be reflective of current ED capabilities.",
