            "text": "Antibodies are key molecules of the vertebrates' immune system. They are responsible for the recognition and binding of target antigens with high affinity and specificity. Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) are used in a wide range of applications, including diagnosis, prevention and treatment of many diseases. For example, they are being successfully utilized as \u201ctargeting vectors\u201d to direct drugs, radioisotopes and other therapeutic molecules to their target cells or tissues, as immunomodulators in pathology\u2010related functions, as well as diagnostic tools to identify and localize molecular alterations. In addition to their pharmaceutical applications, mAbs can also be used to modulate plant traits, generate disease or pest resistant crops (Tavladoraki et al., 1993; Nolke et al., 2004; Peschen et al., 2004; Villani et al., 2005), and to study plant metabolic pathways (Nolke et al., 2005). Antibodies are complex glycoproteins consisting of four polypeptides, linked by disulfide bridges and non\u2010covalent bonds. Despite their complexity, mAbs and their derivatives can be easily expressed in heterologous systems including plants (Fischer et al., 2003). However, mAbs produced by heterologous systems may not share the precise structural and functional properties of the native molecules. For example, mAbs produced by a bacterial expression system will lack post\u2010translational modifications including glycosylation. Non\u2010mammalian eukaryotic expression systems could fail to use the appropriate glycans groups resulting in different glycosylation patterns. Yeasts, for example, tend to hyperglycosylate (Harashima, 1994; Malissard et al., 1996); while plants preferentially introduce xylose and fucose residues and fail to use galactose and syalic acid (Gomord and Faye, 2004). Although proper glycosylation is required for functions of many mAbs, it is to be noted that different glycosylation patterns do not always lead to loss of function in vitro or in vivo, or cause side\u2010effects in humans (Chargelegue et al., 2000). Different strategies have been adopted to circumvent these limitations such as targeting mAbs to the endoplasmic reticulum, or abolishing glycosylation sites by mutagenesis to avoid inappropriate glycosylated products. In fact, it has been reported that the absence of glycans in some cases did not interfere with correct assembly and activity (Rodriguez et al., 2005; Nuttall et al., 2005). In addition a fascinating approach that requires sophisticated genetic and metabolic engineering resides in the inactivation of endogenous glycosyltransferases and/or expression of heterologous mammalian specific enzymes in the host plant system (Saint\u2010Jore\u2010Dupas et al., 2007).",

Thanks to the recent improvements of viral\u2010based vectors, mAbs have been produced with transient expression systems to quickly achieve much higher production levels along with other complex proteins. Single chain fragments, that preserve antigen\u2010recognition elements of the full length immunoglobulin, are often more effective as drugs or diagnostic tools than mAbs due to their increased ability to penetrate target tissues, reduced immunogenicity, and more rapid clearance. A chimeric gene insertion TMV based vector was used for the expression of a human scFv for treatment of non\u2010Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) (McCormick et al., 1999, 2003). The plant\u2010derived scFv generated an antibody response in vaccinated animals, and was an effective vaccine in a murine NHL tumor challenge model. The TMV strategy provides the speed and versatility required for the development of a patient specific treatment and this anti\u2010idiotype vaccine is currently undergoing clinical trials for safety and immunogenicity evaluation in humans.",

The SIP was expressed by a PVX gene insertion vector and by a CPMV based display vector using the 2A expression strategy. The aim was to provide passive protection against enteric infections upon oral delivery in crude plant extracts (Monger et al., 2006). The SIP folded correctly and preserved the ability to bind and neutralize TGEV in tissue cultures. Moreover, it provided in vivo protection against challenge with TGEV in piglets vaccinated orally with crude extracts of scFv\u2010expressing tobacco plants. The same researchers also expressed a full length TGEV\u2010specific IgA by co\u2010infecting plants with two separate PVX insertion vectors for the light chain (LC) and the heavy chain (HC) respectively (Alamillo et al., 2006). The IgA was correctly assembled in plant tissue and provided in vivo protection against TGEV in piglets after oral administration. A previous work (Verch et al., 1998) also indicated the possibility to produce a full size mAb in plants through the co\u2010infection of two modified TMV based viral vectors. These results clearly indicated the possibility to obtain functional mAbs through plant expression systems.",

            "text": "Nonetheless, expression of heterooligomeric proteins such as mAbs might be inefficient due to the co\u2010delivery of viral vectors built on the same virus backbone. In fact, this feature may result in early segregation and subsequent preferential amplification of one of the vectors in one cell. This problem has been recently overcome by utilizing two sets of vectors derived from non\u2010competing TMV and PVX to express the two different mAb chains (Giritch et al., 2006). TMV and PVX may interact with different host proteins to sustain their replication and movement without interfering with each other. As a result, neither of the two vectors gains a replicative advantage over the other, allowing efficient co\u2010expression of HC and LC in the same cells. The level of expression by each vector is independent within the same cell and can reach up to 0.5 mg/g FW of full assembled mAb in few weeks. This strategy represents a useful platform for rapid large\u2010scale manufacturing of mAbs and other hetero\u2010oligomeric proteins especially in situations requiring rapid responses such as pandemic threats and bioterrorism events.",

            "text": "A vaccine is an antigenic preparation used to establish immunity to a disease. Vaccination has been one of the greatest revolutions in medical science and has dramatically improved the quality and length of life expectancy. Although vaccines are the most cost effective form of disease protection in healthcare, their cost is still too excessive for many people in the world, especially in developing countries. Vaccines can be therapeutic, to overcome an infection already established, or prophylactic, to prevent a future infection. The aim of vaccination strategies is to obtain efficient and safe vaccine formulations to induce a long lasting immunity against various pathogens. To achieve this goal, the vaccine component should generate not only a neutralizing antibody response, a long\u2010term memory B cells stimulation, but also a T cell mediated immunity to eliminate infected cells which represent the pathogen reservoirs. Recombinant subunit vaccines, based on a single protein (antigen) or a single peptide (epitope) derived from the pathogen, are particularly attractive strategies when compared to classic inactivated, attenuated or live recombinant vaccines. Recombinant subunit vaccines offer potentially equivalent efficacy but are much safer and in some cases easier to produce. Plants offer unique advantages for the production of subunit vaccines in terms of scale, speed, costs, yield, and safety. The first work that describes the expression of the hepatitis B surface antigen in stable transgenic tobacco in 1992 marked the beginning for developing low cost vaccine formulations in plants (Mason et al., 1992). Researchers focused on expressing their antigens in edible plant tissues as oral vaccines, opening a new prospect for vaccine delivery (Mor et al., 1998). Since then, many research groups have adopted this system and carried out studies in the areas of improving target protein expression levels, analyzing the administration route and schedule, choosing the appropriate animal models, and exploring the use of possible adjuvants.",

All mice immunized intraperitoneally developed a protective immune response against experimental challenge with virulent FMDV. A great number of antigens have been produced in plants with different immunologic results (Streatfield and Howard, 2003). Altogether, these works demonstrated that plant\u2010derived antigens retained their antigenicity and were able to induce active protective humoral and cell\u2010mediated immune responses. The development of plant derived vaccines for human and veterinary uses against viral pathologies, tumors, allergies, bacterial infections, and diabetes\u2010associated autoantigens has been extensively investigated (Table 1).",

In this work the protective efficacy of the fraction 1 capsular antigen (F1) and the low calcium response virulent antigen (V) expressed at levels up to 2 mg/g FW in N. benthamiana leaves was evaluated. Guinea pigs, immunized with purified antigens, showed antigen\u2010specific serum IgG titers and, more importantly, 75% of animals were protected from an aerosolized challenge of virulent Y. pestis. In a subsequent work Mett et al. (2007) expressed the same Y. pestis F1 and V antigens in N. benthamiana plants with an average yield of 0.38 mg/g FW with their lichenase optimized vector.

Epitopes are the most important regions of an antigen. They interact directly with surface receptors on B and T cells and induce an immune response. A single protein can have several epitopes with different immunological features and structures. Epitopes can be linear, determined by the amino acid sequence, or conformational, determined by neighboring amino acids only in the tridimensional tertiary structure. An epitope alone could be poorly immunogenic and often possess a short half\u2010life in the serum (Lien and Lowman, 2003). As a result, extensive efforts are being directed to the development of new delivery strategies to increase the immunogenicity and half\u2010life of epitope vaccines (Purcell et al., 2007). Plant viral display vectors have the potential to play an important role in such strategic development. Plant virus particles can structurally function as a scaffold to support, stabilize and display epitopic peptides. For example, a target epitope can be genetically fused to the CP protein. The chimeric virion will be formed by the CP\u2010epitope fusion, representing the vaccine by itself. As a result, plant viruses can be used as a carrier to stabilize epitopes and to present them correctly to the immune system.",

In addition, new strategies involving biotinylation of the capsid and the subsequent binding of streptavidin\u2010conjugated target protein have been developed for displaying long sequences. The canine oral papillomavirus L2 protein, displayed on the TMV surface with this strategy, was significantly more immunogenic in animal models compared to the uncoupled antigen (Smith et al., 2006). With this strategy, it is also possible to combine helper epitopes and peptides known to facilitate cellular uptake or other additional T\u2010cell targets to avoid the use of adjuvants.

Well characterized viruses with stable, highly ordered and repetitive structures, such as TMV and CPMV, are of particular interests. For example, CPMV, cowpea chlorotic mottle virus (CCMV) and other icosahedral viruses have been used as nucleation cages for the mineralization of materials (Douglas and Young, 1998). Another promising application is in noninvasive in vivo vascular imaging techniques (Manchester and Singh, 2006). CPMV for example has been fluorescently labeled to visualize blood flow for periods of at least 72 h to identify vessels and to monitor tumor neovascularization (Lewis et al., 2006). Moreover, CPMV can be modified to generate new surface properties for developing novel biomaterials, electrochemical biosensors, or nanoelectronic devices (Wang et al., 2002; Chatterji et al., 2004; Steinmetz et al., 2006). Rod\u2010shaped viruses, like TMV, have been extensively used in the synthesis of a variety of metals nanowires, magnetic materials and semiconductors. TMV can be used as organic templates for the controlled deposition of gold, silver and platinum to prepare 1\u2010D arrays (Dujardin et al., 2003). Self\u2010assembled, modified CP monomers of TMV were also employed for the construction of photovoltaic components in a novel light\u2010harvesting system (Miller et al., 2007).

The tissue homogenate will then be further pressed to release the protein into the aqueous buffer. The crude extract will be clarified to separate the protein\u2010containing buffer from plant debris, insoluble proteins (see below) and other particulate matters. In comparison to other production hosts, plants produce more solid debris (up to 30% of totally weight of the biomaterial (Menkhaus et al., 2004)). The larger and denser solids make it impossible to achieve effective clarification by filtration methods. As a result, continuous centrifugation remains the most effective and scalable technique for plant extract clarification. It should be noted that it is possible to extract small recombinant proteins (<50 kDa) that are targeted through the endomembrane system to the apoplast without breaking the plant cells. For example, some of the smaller proteins can be released directly into the extraction buffer by simply rinsing the tissue or by a specialized centrifugation technique (Lohaus et al., 2001).

Like proteins from other production hosts, purification strategies are formulated for each individual protein based on its solubility, size, pI, charge, hydrophobicity, and affinity to specific ligands and the parallel characteristics of host proteins. For mAb\u2010based PMPs, while protein A or G\u2010based chromatography provides a superb and convenient step (Langone, 1982), much effort is needed to eliminate plant host molecules which cause resin fouling or/and interfere with the binding of the target protein to protein A resin, and thus, reduce its capacity. Non\u2010chromatographic scalable processes such as aqueous two\u2010phase partitioning systems (ATPS) are being developed to address this key issue (Platis and Labrou, 2006).",

This time\u2010consuming and challenging process calls for the need to develop more \u201cuniversal\u201d or versatile purification methods. The employment of affinity tags, particularly the tandem affinity tag purification (TAP) strategy, provides possibilities for such versatile solution (Lichty et al., 2005; Arnau et al., 2006; Tagwerker et al., 2006). However, the search for both efficient and precise proteases for tag removal still presents serious challenges. In addition, the inclusion of proteases in the manufacturing process further complicates product purification, as well as raises cost and regulatory concerns (Feeney et al., 2006; Kenig et al., 2006). Several non\u2010enzymatic affinity tag removal techniques have been explored (Rais\u2010Beghdadi et al., 1998; Wood et al., 1999), but still require further optimization before becoming practical for product manufacturing.",

Phenolics tend to modify proteins by forming complexes, thus impeding purification if not removed earlier during purification (Kusnadi et al., 1998; Menkhaus et al., 2004). Some plants, such as tobacco, also produce a high\u2010level of toxic alkaloids that have to be eliminated from final product (Twyman et al., 2003). Regarding agroinfection, the potential elevated\u2010level of endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide, LPS) from a gram\u2010negative bacterium is another concern. Specific purification strategies to lower the LPS to acceptable levels must be incorporated into the overall scheme to ensure the safety of PMPs produced using this platform (Magalhaes et al., 2007).",

Ideally, no more than three chromatographic steps should be included to obtain a highly purified product. Otherwise, recovery will drop to an impractical level. Whenever possible, resins widely accepted by standard pharmaceutical industry should be considered first during process\u2010development to minimize future regulatory expenditure. The requirement for an independent Quality Management System (QMS) to govern the manufacture of pharmaceuticals also applies to the PMPs. In addition to cGMP compliance during downstream processing, analytical tests for releasing the final purified products have to address plant specific contaminants in addition to the standard required assays. Even though plants do not contain animal viruses and other infectious agents, it must be validated that LPS, phenolics, and alkaloids, as well as herbicides and insecticides have been adequately removed from the final product.",
