The plant is hygrophilous and shade enduring when young. It is well adapted to warm and humid conditions. Optimum average temperature varies between 20 and 23 \u00b0C, the rainfall ranges from 1800 to 2600 mm every year. It thrives on red-brown ferralitic and acid soils but will tolerate marginally alkaline soils.",

Twelve constituents, mainly organic acids, were isolated from C. barometz rhizome volatile oil with palmitic acid and linoleic acid as the major acids (Jia et al. 1996). The contents of protocatechuic acid and caffeic acid in all the samples of C. barometz rhizomes collected from various areas were above 0.020 and 0.029 %, respectively, and the highest content was found in the processed products (Yuan et al. 2000). Twenty-five compounds were identified in the essential oil from C. barometz rhizome; the main constituents were oleic acid, linoleic acid, palmitic acid, pentadecanoic acid, 7,10,13-hexadecatrienoic acid methyl ester, linolenic acid methyl ester with relative content over 10 %, respectively (Xu et al. 2000). The content of phosphatidylcholine was 0.198 % in C. barometz (Xu et al. 2001). Zhang and Wang (2001) found the following compounds in the rhizomes, onitin, protocatechuic acid, \u03b2-sitosterol, daucosterol and 2-furancarboxaldehyde-50-hydroxylmethyl. Nine compounds were isolated and identified from the rhizomes: palmitic acid, \u03b2-sitosterol, 1-mono-palmitin, daucosterol, caffeic acid, protocatechuic acid, protocatechuic aldehyde, n-butyl-\u03b2-d-fructopyranoside and d-glucose (Cheng et al. 2003).

According to Nguyen et al. (2009a, b)), Zhang et al. (2008), the rhizome of C. barometz is believed to replenish the liver and the kidney, strengthen the tendons, muscles and bones and relieve rheumatic conditions. It is widely used to cure rheumatism, limb-ache, lumbago, neuralgia and pollakiuria in aged humans, leucorrhoea, sciatica, micturition, enuresis and body-ache in pregnant women. The golden hair covering the rhizome is used for styptic for poulticing the wounds and cuts in the limbs to stop bleeding in Peninsular Malaysia and China (Burkill 1966) (Plate 2). In Vietnam, rhizomes are used to treat rheumatism, lumbago, neuralgia, sciatica, enuresis and body aches in pregnant women (WHO 1990; NIMM 1999).",
