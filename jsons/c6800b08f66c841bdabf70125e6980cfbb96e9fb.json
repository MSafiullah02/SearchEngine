Perkins Consensus on Science and Treatment recommendations aim to balance the benefits of early resuscitation with the potential for harm to care providers during the COVID-19 pandemic. Chest compressions and cardiopulmonary resuscitation have the potential to generate aerosols. During the current COVID-19 pandemic lay rescuers should consider compressions and public-access defibrillation. Lay rescuers who are willing, trained and able to do so, should consider providing rescue breaths to infants and children in addition to chest compressions. Healthcare professionals should use personal protective equipment for aerosol generating procedures during resuscitation and may consider defibrillation before donning personal protective equipment for aerosol generating procedures.",

ILCOR commissioned a systematic review to examine the risk to rescuers from resuscitation interventions in patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19. 7 The review examined the risks of aerosol generation and infection transmission associated with chest compressions, defibrillation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation and the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) during CPR interventions. 8 It identified very low certainty evidence drawn from 11 studies (five case reports, three observational studies and three randomised controlled manikin studies). The certainty of evidence was limited by observational study designs, risk of bias and indirectness (none of the studies included a patient with COVID-19). The review found indirect evidence that cardiopulmonary resuscitation was associated with aerosol generation and transmission of infection. Although our systematic review found no evidence that defibrillation was an aerosol generating procedure, the available evidence was not strong enough to separate the individual risks associated with specific resuscitation interventions (e.g. chest compressions, ventilations, defibrillation) from the resuscitation attempt as a whole. The review concluded it was uncertain whether chest compressions or defibrillation cause aerosol generation or transmission of COVID-19 to rescuers.",

For infants and children, the Task Force considered that bystander rescuers were frequently those who routinely care for infants and children. In that case, the risk of the rescuer newly acquiring COVID-19 through provision of rescue breaths is greatly outweighed by improved outcome for infants and children in asphyxial arrest who receive compressions with ventilation.",
