PDZ domains play a role in several cellular functions, from cell-cell communication and polarization, to regulation of protein transport and protein metabolism. PDZ domain proteins are also crucial in the formation and stability of protein complexes, establishing an important bridge between extracellular stimuli detected by transmembrane receptors and intracellular responses. PDZ domains have been suggested as promising drug targets in several diseases, ranging from neurological and oncological disorders to viral infections. In this review, the authors describe structural and genetic aspects of PDZ-containing proteins and discuss the current status of the development of small-molecule and peptide modulators of PDZ domains. An overview of potential new therapeutic interventions in PDZ-mediated protein networks is also provided.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "In the post-genomic era, it has become clear that it is not the number of genes that determines biological function and complexity, but rather the intricacy of interactions between proteins, also known as the interactome, [1] where more than 600 000 unique interactions have been described in humans. [2] Several www.advancedsciencenews.com www.advtherap.com Figure 2 . a) Canonical fold of a PDZ domain shows six \u03b2-sheets and two \u03b1-helices, with a ligand (blue) inserting into a binding pocket between \u03b1B and \u03b2B. In a canonical insertion, there is a hydrogen bonding network (orange dashed lines) between the backbone of the PDZ domain and the backbone of the peptide. b) In the noncanonical fold of the GORASP1 and two PDZ domain, the overall globular fold remains intact but with N-terminal and C-terminal placed \u03b2C and \u03b2B, instead of \u03b2A and \u03b2F, respectively (red dotted spheres). c) In ZO-1 PDZ2, the domain folds from two nonfunctional monomeric domains where \u03b2B and \u03b2C of the two domains swap in order to complete the fold into the functional dimeric PDZ tandem. d) The canonical insertion mode often relies on interactions between the ligands P 0 carboxylic acid and amine to the backbone of the PDZ domain, and insertion of the P 0 side chain into a hydrophobic pocket; furthermore, the interaction is often strengthened by either insertion or interaction of P \u22122 with a hydrophobic cavity (class II ligand) or a conserved charged residue (class I ligand) at \u03b1B1 (often a His). e) PDZ domain ligands can also bind using internal motifs where it usually still relies on the insertion of a hydrophobic residue into the binding pocket and either hydrophobic or hydrogen bond interaction coordination of the P \u22122 , but the interaction also relies on the P +1 or P +2 residue being negatively charged (Glu/Asp), using the carboxylic acid as substitute for the C-terminal. f) The \u03b2-loop binding mode in many ways resembles (e) but the bend of the \u03b2-loop allows the ligand to cover twice the surface area and stabilize the \u03b2-strand formation of the inserted part through intermolecular hydrogen bonding, overall stabilizing the interaction. tic scaffolding protein Shank3. In this case, SAPAP docks into a second hydrophobic pocket formed by an N-terminal extension and the \u03b2B-\u03b2C loop of the Shank3 PDZ domain. [40] In yet further distinctive binding mode variations of the canonical interaction, P 0 is buried deeper in the binding groove of the PDZ domain, occupying what corresponds to the P 1 position (Figure 2e ). [41] In an additional case, a Gly at P \u22122 induces conformational flexibility within the ligand backbone, whereby the P \u22123 amino acids shifts to occupy the P \u22122 position. [42] In another example, a Cys in P 0 enables the ligand to bind in two distinct positions, canonical and upward shifted, inserting the P \u22122 amino acid into the conventional hydrophobic binding pocket, and allowing P \u22124 to make a salt bridge to a Lys positioned at the N-terminal of \u03b1B, which stabilizes the binding. [38] Some PDZ domains can also bind phosphopeptides, [43] which has been suggested to be involved in phosphoregulation of PDZ domain interactions, thus adding to the plasticity of PDZ domain-mediated interactions. [44, 45] In addition to the carboxylate-dependent binding of PDZ domains, it has more recently been demonstrated that PDZ domains can also bind internal peptide motifs [42, [46] [47] [48] [49] and phospholipids. [50] [51] [52] The interaction between the neuronal nitric oxide synthetase (nNOS) \u03b2-hairpin structure and the syntrophin PDZ domain is an example of binding of internal peptide motifs. Here, the entire \u03b2-hairpin peptide (Figure 2f ), comprising two \u03b2-strands connected by a sharp \u03b2-turn, is required for www.advancedsciencenews.com www.advtherap.com binding, thereby occupying more than twice the surface area of peptides binding to PDZ domains in the canonical carboxylatedependent fashion. The carboxylate binding loop of the PDZ domain plays an essential role by coordinating to the backbone carbonyl of a Phe at P 0 . This Phe has an analogous role to the hydrophobic P 0 residue of canonical C-terminal peptide ligands by occupying the hydrophobic pocket. [49] In the case of phospholipids, PDZ domains generally lack well-defined binding pockets and PDZ-phospholipid interactions have been mapped to different structural regions in distinct cases, as reviewed in detail previously. [44, 53] Generally, the negatively charged phospholipid head group is stabilized by positively charged clusters in the phospholipid binding site. Both for syntenin and protein interacting with C Kinase 1 (PICK1), the PDZ-phospholipid interactions have been shown to be crucial for clustering membrane receptors to the cell membrane and, [54] [55] [56] for PICK1, in a redox-dependent manner. [56] In addition to the multifaceted behavior of PDZ domains, several have been shown to form dimeric structures through homoor heterodimerization. [57] [58] [59] [60] [61] [62] [63] For instance, the second PDZ domain of ZO-1 was shown to homodimerize via domain swapping, where \u03b2A and \u03b2B of one domain is swapped with \u03b2A' and \u03b2B' from the second domain (domain 1: \u03b2A-\u03b2B-\u03b2C'-\u03b1A'-\u03b2D'-\u03b2E'-\u03b1B'-\u03b2F'; domain 2: \u03b2A'-\u03b2B'-\u03b2C-\u03b1A-\u03b2D-\u03b2E-\u03b1B-\u03b2F), which completes the correct fold and shape of the ligand binding pocket (see Figure 2c ). For PICK1, Cys residues in the \u03b2B-\u03b2C loop have been shown to facilitate a redox-dependent homodimerization of the single PDZ domain of PICK1, and it is believed to contribute to the ligand binding capabilities of PICK1. [56] In the past decade, it has become evident that the structural and functional properties of PDZ domains can be affected by extensions beyond the conventional PDZ domain structural core by forming functional independent units or supramodules. [64] Such extensions can be small secondary structural elements that add to the PDZ domain structural core, as exemplified by the third PDZ domain, PDZ3, of PSD-95 that contains an additional C-terminal \u03b1-helix which influences ligand binding through an allosteric mechanism. [65] In other cases, PDZ supramodules are formed by neighboring domains in either a homotypical [36, [66] [67] [68] [69] [70] or heterotypical fashion ( Figure S2 , Supporting Information). In the homotypical PDZ1-2 tandem of PSD-95, these two domains are restricted by a short linker, positioning the two domains in an antiparallel fashion. In other proteins, such as Whirlin, a longer and more flexible linker allows for greater flexibility of the tandem PDZ domain. [67] In general, the homotypical PDZ tandem domains can facilitate either binding of multiple copies of single proteins or multiple subunits of protein complexes (Figure S2 , Supporting Information), such as the PSD-95 GluN2B interaction. Alternatively, the PDZ tandem domain can bind to different participants in a protein complex, such as one GluN2B subunit and one nNOS binding to one PDZ12 tandem of PSD-95.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 222, "end": 225, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 301, "end": 304, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2312, "end": 2316, "text": "[40]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2521, "end": 2525, "text": "[41]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2691, "end": 2695, "text": "[42]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3008, "end": 3012, "text": "[38]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3061, "end": 3065, "text": "[43]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3222, "end": 3226, "text": "[44,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3227, "end": 3230, "text": "45]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3390, "end": 3394, "text": "[42,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3395, "end": 3399, "text": "[46]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3400, "end": 3404, "text": "[47]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3405, "end": 3409, "text": "[48]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3410, "end": 3414, "text": "[49]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3434, "end": 3438, "text": "[50]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3439, "end": 3443, "text": "[51]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3444, "end": 3448, "text": "[52]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 4196, "end": 4200, "text": "[49]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 4423, "end": 4427, "text": "[44,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 4428, "end": 4431, "text": "53]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 4760, "end": 4764, "text": "[54]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 4765, "end": 4769, "text": "[55]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 4770, "end": 4774, "text": "[56]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 4815, "end": 4819, "text": "[56]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 4963, "end": 4967, "text": "[57]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 4968, "end": 4972, "text": "[58]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 4973, "end": 4977, "text": "[59]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 4978, "end": 4982, "text": "[60]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 4983, "end": 4987, "text": "[61]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 4988, "end": 4992, "text": "[62]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 4993, "end": 4997, "text": "[63]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 5560, "end": 5564, "text": "[56]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 5806, "end": 5810, "text": "[64]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 6082, "end": 6086, "text": "[65]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 6178, "end": 6182, "text": "[36,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 6183, "end": 6187, "text": "[66]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 6188, "end": 6192, "text": "[67]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 6193, "end": 6197, "text": "[68]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 6198, "end": 6202, "text": "[69]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 6203, "end": 6207, "text": "[70]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 6551, "end": 6555, "text": "[67]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 359, "end": 367, "text": "Figure 2", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2507, "end": 2517, "text": "(Figure 2e", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3655, "end": 3665, "text": "(Figure 2f", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 5327, "end": 5336, "text": "Figure 2c", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 6235, "end": 6244, "text": "Figure S2", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 6713, "end": 6723, "text": "(Figure S2", "ref_id": null}], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "However, in some tandem supramodules, the function of one PDZ domain is exclusively to stabilize the other PDZ domain. This is the case for both the PDZ1-2 [71] and PDZ4-5 [66] tandems of glutamate receptor-interacting protein (GRIP), which comprises seven PDZ domains, and where the folding and binding of one PDZ domain requires the presence of the other PDZ domain. For the PDZ4-5 tandem, PDZ4 exclusively acts as a chaperone for PDZ5 and does not contribute to receptor binding itself. [66, 72] In the heterotypical supramodules, PDZ domains are combined with other modular protein domains including SH3 and guanylate kinase (GK) domains, as seen in the membraneassociated guanylate kinase (MAGUK) superfamily of proteins ( Figure S3 , Supporting Information). For example, it was demonstrated for ZO-1 that the three domains, PDZ3-SH3-GK, fold into a heterotypical supramodule, increasing the peptide affinity for PDZ3 significantly, compared to the isolated PDZ3 domain. [73] Similarly, for the interaction of MAGUK p55 subfamily member 5 (MPP5/PALS1) with protein crumbs homolog 1 (Crb), the affinity increased 85-fold upon binding to the entire supramodule compared to the isolated PDZ domain. [74] In the case of synaptic Ras GTPase-activating protein (SynGAP) binding to PSD proteins, structural studies show that the PDZ3-SH3 linker region folds into an \u03b1-helix upon binding to SynGAP, which stabilizes the overall complex and increases the affinity eightfold and fourfold for PSD-95 and PSD-93, respectively. [75] Hence, the supramodular structures of PDZ domains often fine-tune the specificity and selectivity and should be considered when developing PDZ domain directed inhibitors.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 156, "end": 160, "text": "[71]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 172, "end": 176, "text": "[66]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 490, "end": 494, "text": "[66,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 495, "end": 498, "text": "72]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 977, "end": 981, "text": "[73]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1202, "end": 1206, "text": "[74]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1521, "end": 1525, "text": "[75]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 728, "end": 737, "text": "Figure S3", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "PDZ domain-containing proteins are highly involved in distinct biological processes, such as cell cycle, signal transduction, and metabolism, according to the available annotations of 74 of the 151 human PDZ-containing proteins in the Reactome database of manually curated, experimentally proven, and peer-reviewed pathways ( Table 1) . [76] While most of these PDZ domain proteins are primarily involved in one pathway group, such as a specific signal transduction or cell cycle, some of them are involved in a plethora of different processes (Table S2 , Supporting Information).

This rich cross interaction combined with the pathway data and the Adv high-network density observed altogether underlines the fundamental importance of PDZ domain interactions. Since PDZ domain-containing proteins are involved in numerous signaling pathways, it is not surprising that they are also associated with a range of diseases and disorders.

Membrane-associated guanylate kinase, WW and PDZ-containing protein 2 (MAGI2) and MAGUK p55 subfamily member 7 (MPP7), both of which participate in regulation of signaling events, are associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) ( Table S3 , Supporting Information). A hallmark of AD is an abnormal aggregation of proteins at synapses, [98] and several synaptic PDZ-containing proteins might be involved in this pathological event. PDZ-containing proteins such as connector enhancer of kinase suppressor of ras3 (CNKSR3), serine protease HTRA2, MAGUK p55 subfamily member 2 (MPP2), nitric oxide synthase (NOS1), and partitioning defective 3 homolog (PARD3) have been linked to Parkinson's disease.

Together with Shank3, SAP-90/PSD-95-associated protein 1 (SAPAP1) and SynGAP, PSD-95 represents the core of synaptic scaffolding. [100] PSD-95 is highly expressed in the adult mouse brain, with highest expression levels in the hippocampus, cortex, and olfactory bulb. [101] In neurons, PSD-95 is highly enriched in synaptic regions, especially in the postsynaptic density (PSD). [102] PSD-95 encoding gene (DLG4) is found on chromosome 17 (17p13.1), spanning approximately 30 kb, and is associated with neurological disorders as previously discussed. Our search in the databases mentioned above has shown that PSD-95 is associated with several neurological disorders, including schizophrenia, major depressive disorder (MDD), and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) ( Figure 4 and Table S3 , Supporting Information). Variations in DLG4 have been associated with schizophrenia [103, 104] and it was recently shown that epigenetic editing of DLG4 could rescue memory deficits in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.

Among these, palmitoylation as previously described, as well as several phosphorylations, have been found to influence the function, localization, and mobility of \u03b1-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptors (AMPARs) and N-methyld-aspartate receptors (NMDARs). [110] [111] [112] Together with synapseassociated protein 102 (SAP-102), postsynaptic density protein 93 (PSD-93), and SAP-97, PSD-95 is a core member of the MAGUK superfamily ( Figure S3 , Supporting Information), with a common domain topology of three PDZ domains (PDZ1-3), an SH3 domain, and a GK domain, as described in Section 2.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 546, "end": 550, "text": "[20,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 551, "end": 555, "text": "108,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 556, "end": 560, "text": "109]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 954, "end": 959, "text": "[110]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 960, "end": 965, "text": "[111]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 966, "end": 971, "text": "[112]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 532, "end": 542, "text": "(Figure 5a", "ref_id": "FIGREF1"}, {"start": 1132, "end": 1141, "text": "Figure S3", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}], "section": "Targeting PDZ Domains of Postsynaptic Density Protein 95/Synapse-Associated Protein 90"}, {"text": "The primary role of PSD-95 is to stabilize and anchor membrane protein complexes in the synaptic membrane, and in the case of AMPARs and NMDARs, the direct or indirect association clusters these receptors into larger signaling complexes ( Figure 5c ). The interaction between PSD-95 and the NMDAR is primarily mediated by the direct interaction of the C-terminus of the GluN2B subunit and PDZ1 or PDZ2 of PSD-95 (Figure 5c,d) . Furthermore, the PSD-95/NMDAR complex is stabilized by the interaction between PSD-95-PDZ3 and the NMDAR auxiliary subunit Neuropilin and tolloid-like protein 1 (NETO-1). Similarly, PSD-95 interacts with the AMPAR complexes through binding to the AMPAR auxiliary subunits, such as the voltagedependent calcium channel \u03b3 -2 subunit (CACNG2), also known as transmembrane AMPA receptor regulatory protein \u03b3 2 (TARP \u03b3 2 or stargazin), which binds predominantly to PSD-95-PDZ3 ( Figure 5c ). Furthermore, PSD-95 holds a key role in the nNOS-mediated NO production following the abnormal synaptic Ca 2+ influx resulting from ischemic stroke. [113] nNOS binds primarily to PDZ2 of PSD-95 through a noncanonical insertion of a \u03b2-hairpin motif in the binding pocket of PDZ2 [114] (Figure 5c ). The interaction between nNOS and PSD-95 ensures that nNOS and NMDAR are in close proximity, where Ca 2+ influx under normal conditions leads to NO generation, which is required for further signaling. However, under excitotoxic conditions, massive calcium influx through the NMDAR activates nNOS, which leads to the generation of toxic levels of NO. [115] [116] [117] There has therefore been a keen interest in disrupting the ternary PSD-95/nNOS/NMDAR complex, representing a potential novel mode of action for the treatment of ischemic stroke. Currently, many inhibitors have been designed targeting the PDZ domains of PSD-95, [118, 119] with multiple promising lead candidates. [120, 121] A number of small-molecule inhibitors ( Figure 6 , Table 2 ) targeting PSD-95-mediated interactions have been identified. Screening of a 150 000 compound library identified IC87201 (2-((1H-benzo[d] [1, 2, 3] triazol-5-ylamino)methyl)-4,6-dichlorophenol) as an inhibitor of the PSD-95/nNOS interaction with an IC 50 of 31 \u00b5m. [122] IC87201 was examined in vivo for nociceptive effects in mice after intrathecal (i.t.) administration and showed a significant pain reducing effect at 100 pmol in the presence of NMDA, with no effect in the absence of NMDA. Furthermore, IC87201 was tested in the chronic constriction injury (CCI) model of neuropathic pain, and displayed an alleviating effect on pain perception, and similar effects were seen when administering a variant of nNOS fused to the cell penetrating peptide (CPP) Tat. [122] A structure-activity relationship (SAR) study of IC87201 leads to the discovery of ZL006, [123] which was shown to be an inhibitor of the nNOS/PSD-95 interaction following glutamate/glycine treatment with an IC 50 value of 82 nm in cultured cortical neurons. ZL006 was shown to ameliorate cerebral ischemic brain damage in mice when administered after middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). [123] Later studies have shown promising effects of ZL006 in results from forced swimming tests [124] and regenerative repair following transient MACO (tMCAO)-induced stroke, [113] while recent studies have raised doubts about the rapid-onset antidepressant effects of ZL006 in mice. [125] Due to a relatively poor cellular uptake of ZL006, the compound was reformulated and encapsulated in liposomes conjugated with polyethylene glycol (PEG) and T7, which targets transferrin receptors and enhance uptake. [126] The T7-P-ZL006 formulation increased the cellular uptake compared to ZL006 and T7-P-ZL006 showed a decrease in infarct volume following MCAO after i.v. injection. In further studies, it was shown that dual conjugation of T7 and stroke homing peptide (SHp) to the ZL006containing liposomes increased the accumulation of the T7-SHp-ZL006 liposomes in the affected brain area following MCAO and reduced the infarct volume further compared to ZL006 and T7-P-ZL006. [127] Although ZL006 shows promising neuroprotective effects, the specific molecular mechanism is still debated. It was originally suggested that ZL006 binds to the nNOS \u03b2-finger, thus preventing the nNOS \u03b2-finger from binding to PDZ2 of PSD-95. [123] However, a recent study showed that ZL006 does not bind the PDZ domains of PSD-95 or nNOS, and that ZL006 does not inhibit the PSD-95/nNOS complex. [128] Thus, ZL006 might not be a direct inhibitor of the PSD-95/nNOS complex, but acts through a yet unknown mechanism. In addition to IC87201 and ZL006, compounds such as tramiprosate (homotaurine, 3-amino-1-propanesulfonic acid), 4-PPBP (4-phenyl-1-(4phenylbutyl)-piperidine), and honokiol have been proposed to inhibit the NMDAR/nNOS/PSD-95 ternary complex, but in all cases the specific mechanism remains unclear.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1064, "end": 1069, "text": "[113]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1193, "end": 1198, "text": "[114]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1562, "end": 1567, "text": "[115]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1568, "end": 1573, "text": "[116]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1574, "end": 1579, "text": "[117]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1841, "end": 1846, "text": "[118,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1847, "end": 1851, "text": "119]", "ref_id": "BIBREF119"}, {"start": 1893, "end": 1898, "text": "[120,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1899, "end": 1903, "text": "121]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2102, "end": 2105, "text": "[1,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2106, "end": 2108, "text": "2,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2109, "end": 2111, "text": "3]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2229, "end": 2234, "text": "[122]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2730, "end": 2735, "text": "[122]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2826, "end": 2831, "text": "[123]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3129, "end": 3134, "text": "[123]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3225, "end": 3230, "text": "[124]", "ref_id": "BIBREF124"}, {"start": 3304, "end": 3309, "text": "[113]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3413, "end": 3418, "text": "[125]", "ref_id": "BIBREF125"}, {"start": 3636, "end": 3641, "text": "[126]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 4103, "end": 4108, "text": "[127]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 4349, "end": 4354, "text": "[123]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 4503, "end": 4508, "text": "[128]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 239, "end": 248, "text": "Figure 5c", "ref_id": "FIGREF1"}, {"start": 412, "end": 425, "text": "(Figure 5c,d)", "ref_id": "FIGREF1"}, {"start": 902, "end": 911, "text": "Figure 5c", "ref_id": "FIGREF1"}, {"start": 1199, "end": 1209, "text": "(Figure 5c", "ref_id": "FIGREF1"}, {"start": 1944, "end": 1952, "text": "Figure 6", "ref_id": "FIGREF2"}, {"start": 1955, "end": 1962, "text": "Table 2", "ref_id": null}], "section": "Targeting PDZ Domains of Postsynaptic Density Protein 95/Synapse-Associated Protein 90"}, {"text": "Due to the general low affinity of small molecules targeting PDZ domains, the most viable approach for designing inhibitors of PDZ domains seems to be the development of inhibitory peptides and peptidomimetics ( Figure 6 ). Several studies have identified the key amino acids required for binding to PSD-95 and attempted to design and modify short peptide fragments for increased stability and affinity. [129, 130] In one example, the hexamer CRIPT peptide, YKQTSV, was used as a template and P \u22121 (Ser) and P \u22123 (Gln) were substituted to Glu and Lys respectively, to facilitate an intramolecular lactam cyclization ( Figure 5e ). This cyclization strategy increased the affinity for PSD-95 PDZ1 tenfold, improved the half-life of the peptide, and disrupted the interaction between PSD-95 and GluK2 in HEK293 cells. [131] An analogue of the CRIPT peptide, YKQTKV, was used as a template for parallel synthesis of 272 different peptides, modified at the P \u22121 Lys with various organic acids, which led to a 20-fold increase in affinity. [132] The first peptide inhibitor of PSD-95, NA-1 (or Tat-NR2B9c), was developed to target the interaction between PSD-95 and nNOS, minimizing the excitotoxicity resulting from ischemic stroke. [133] NA-1 is a fusion peptide of the nine amino acid Cterminal residues of the GluN2B NMDAR subunit, KLSSIESDV, and the nuclear transcription activation protein-derived cell penetration 11-mer peptide Tat ( Figure 6 ). NA-1 was found to reduce the infarct size in the tMCAO rat model. [133] It was later found, using proteomic analysis, that NA-1 interacts with 44 different proteins, but only the PSD-95 and nNOS were found to be essential for the NMDAR-induced cytotoxicity. [134] [135] [136] In a clinical phase II study, NA-1 reduced the number of infarcts in patients at risk for embolic strokes while undergoing endovascular brain aneurysm repair, while not reducing the infarct size. [137] NA-1 is currently being investigated in a global phase III clinical trial (ES-CAPE NA-1/NA-1-007) for reducing global disability in subjects with a major acute ischemic stroke, as well as a second trial in Canada (FRONTIER/NA-1-005) in patients with acute cerebral ischemia.

Neurons incubated with 5 \u00b5m of the ligand showed that NMDARs were more mobile and less synaptically located. [143] In a similar approach, a series of dimeric 15-mer peptides derived from the TARP \u03b3 2 were developed, which resulted in a 25-fold affinity increase relative to the monomeric peptide, while a 20-fold increase in IC 50 value was obtained for a dimeric ligand incorporating a Tat sequence. [144] Taken together, the dimerization of monomeric peptides to target PSD-95 seems to be an attractive method of increasing both target affinity and plasma stability. Furthermore, it appears that the multimerization strategy is suitable for targeting both the tandem PDZ domains (PDZ1-2) [70, 121, 139, [141] [142] [143] 145] and non-tandem PDZ domain (PDZ3) of PSD-95, [144] though the affinity benefit of targeting the PDZ1-2 tandem seems higher. With NA-1 in phase III clinical trials and the dimeric ligand UCCB01-144 in late-stage preclinical studies, it will be exciting to see potential new stroke treatments and explore PSD-95 as a drug target. In addition, these serve as a proof-of-concept for the targeting of intracellular PPIs such as the PDZ domain interactions.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 130, "end": 135, "text": "[121]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 448, "end": 453, "text": "[140]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 616, "end": 621, "text": "[141]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 819, "end": 824, "text": "[142]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1238, "end": 1243, "text": "[143]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1530, "end": 1535, "text": "[144]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1819, "end": 1823, "text": "[70,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1824, "end": 1828, "text": "121,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1829, "end": 1833, "text": "139,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1834, "end": 1839, "text": "[141]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1840, "end": 1845, "text": "[142]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1846, "end": 1851, "text": "[143]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1852, "end": 1856, "text": "145]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1901, "end": 1906, "text": "[144]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1020, "end": 1028, "text": "Figure 6", "ref_id": "FIGREF2"}], "section": "Target"}, {"text": "PICK1 is a unique protein in the human genome, as it is the only protein that contains both an N-terminal PDZ and a binamphiphysin-Rvs (BAR) domain (Figure 7a,c) . PICK1 was originally cloned as a protein kinase C\u03b1 (PKC\u03b1) binding protein found in multiple tissues and organs, most abundantly in the brain, endocrine tissues, and skeletal muscle tissue (Human Proteome atlas). [146, 147] It is highly evolutionarily conserved from invertebrates to humans, which suggests that PICK1 has important biological functions. Through the PDZ domain, PICK1 interacts with a number of neurotransmitter receptors, transporters, and enzymes (Figure 7f) , where in particular the interactions with the AMPAR [148] [149] [150] [151] [152] [153] [154] [155] [156] [157] and the dopamine transporter (DAT) have received particular attention. [158] [159] [160] The BAR domain of PICK1 is a domain that facilitates dimerization of PICK1. The BAR domain is further believed to promote tetramerization and oligomerization of PICK1 (Figure 7a,b) . [161, 162] The PDZ domain of PICK1 interacts with both lipids and proteins. In PICK1, a Lys is positioned at \u03b1B1 (K83), which explains its promiscuity in binding to different C-terminal ligand classes, though it does favor class II ligands (Figure 7c,d) . [38] The \u03b2B-\u03b2C loop in the PDZ domain of PICK1 contains a Cys-Pro-Cys motif proposed to promote PDZ-PDZ dimerization, [56] zinc binding, [163] and lipid binding. [54] The BAR domain, on the other hand, is characterized by sensing curvatures of membranes and can influence synaptic localization and function of target proteins. [161, 162, [164] [165] [166] [167] PICK1 has been demonstrated to possess multiple functions in the CNS, particularly in the regulation of the function of AM-PARs, specifically the GluA2 receptor subunit, where PICK1 binding to the PDZ domain of PICK1 shows canonical hydrogen bonding network, hydrophobic insertion of P 0 , and side chain coordination of P \u22122 to \u03b1B1 Lys 83 . d) Structure (PDB: 2LUI) of class II ligand (\u2500HWLKV -COOH ) binding to the PDZ domain of PICK1 shows canonical hydrogen bonding network for a class II ligand, hydrophobic insertion of P 0 and P \u22122 ; furthermore, the ligand displays partial coordination of P \u22121 Lys and C-terminal carboxylic acid and backbone/side chain interaction between P \u22124 carbonyl and Lys 83 . e) Example of a class I mimicking small-molecule compound (BIO124, PDB: 6BJO), with coordination of the C-terminal carboxylic acid and P 0 amide hydrogen to the PDZ backbone Ile 33 -Gly 34 -Ile 35 loop, and hydrophobic insertion of the P 0 cyclopropane ring; the interaction is further stabilized by hydrogen bonding between P \u22121 carbonyl and Gln 91 side chain. f) A protein interaction network showing a selection of proteins (highest confidence score) interacting with PICK1 shows high interconnectivity between the different proteins in their respective groups.

Adv is involved in the endocytosis of AMPARs during long-term depression (LTD) and regulation of AMPAR trafficking during the expression of synaptic plasticity. PICK1 has been suggested to play a role in a range of neurological disorders, in particular, chronic pain, but also epilepsy, stroke, Parkinson's disease, and schizophrenia (Table S3 , Supporting Information).

[169, 170] This screening identified a couple of different small-molecule inhibitors with low \u00b5m affinity, where the most potent analogue, seemed to be an irreversible inhibitor. [169] Thus, FSC231 was pursued further and shown to bind PICK1 with a K i of 10.1 \u00b5m, that is, in the same range as endogenous peptides, and FSC231 did not inhibit other PDZcontaining proteins such as PSD-95 and GRIP1. Moreover, it was shown that FSC231 both inhibited co-immunoprecipitation of the GluA2 subunit of AMPARs in cultured hippocampal neurons, and influenced recycling of GluA2 after internalization. Notably, it was also shown that FSC231 blocked the expression of both long-term depression and long-term potentiation in hippocampal cornu ammonis 1 (CA1) neurons from acute slices, which is in accordance with the inhibition of the bidirectional function of PICK1 in synaptic plasticity. In subsequent studies, an SAR study of FCS231 was performed, where a number of analogues were synthesized; however, only leading to a relatively modest improvement in affinity. [171] Researchers at Biogen Idec have similarly pursued smallmolecule inhibitors of PICK1 and have published different small molecules, including BIO922 and BIO124, which share a common chemical scaffold and all include a carboxylic acid and a closely located amide bond that coordinates binding to the carboxylate binding loop of the PICK1 PDZ domain (Figure 7g ). [148, 149] BIO922 was described as identified through structure-based design and has a K i of 98 nm in blocking full length PICK1 and also a selectivity toward PICK1 versus PSD-95 and GRIP. The compound was employed in a mechanistic study examining how amyloid beta (A\u03b2) produces synaptic depression by enhancing endocytosis of AMPARs and it was demonstrated that BIO922 blocks the effects of A\u03b2 synaptic transmission. [172] Another related compound, BIO124, which displayed an IC 50 = 0.51 \u00b5m, was used in a structural study and a co-crystal Xray structure demonstrated that BIO124 binds in the carboxylate binding loop of the PICK PDZ domain (Figure 7e ,g). [149] In a recent study, the discovery of BIO922, BIO124, and related molecules were described in more detail. [148] High-throughput screening of 273 000 compounds was performed, which identified a scaffold, which was subsequently used in an SAR study, which identified BIO922 as the most potent inhibitor. [148] The first peptide inhibitors of the PICK1 PDZ domain were Pep2-EVKI and Pep2-SVKI, which targeted the interaction between the AMPAR subunits GluA2/3 and PICK1 (Figure 7g ). [173] Both peptides could efficiently displace the interaction between PICK1 and GluA2 in COS7 cells, but while Pep2-SVKI was found to inhibit LTD, Pep2-EVKI did not show an effect on LTD. Furthermore, Pep2-SVKI required PKC function to block LTD in hippocampal CA1 neurons. [173] Later studies have shown that Pep2-EVKI could reduce the reinstatement of cocaine seeking through decoupling of the AMPAR C-terminal/PICK1-PDZ interaction after intra-accumbal shell administration. [174] Further development of Pep2-EVKI and Pep2-SVKI was carried out by N-terminal myristylation, producing myr-Pep2-EVKI and myr-Pep2-SVKI, in order to increase the cell permeability and the plasma half-life of the peptides. [175] The involvement of PICK1 in chronic pain was also underlined after i.t. administration of myr-Pep2-EVKI, which showed a significant effect in thermal hyperalgesia and mechanical allodynia following CCI. [175] PICK1 has also been implicated in trafficking of DAT and is thereby implicated in maintaining the dopamine homeostasis. [158, 176] To elucidate the importance of the interaction between PICK1 and DAT, the 24 C-terminal residues of DAT, which contains both a PICK1 binding site at the extreme C-terminal and a Ca 2+ /calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II\u03b1 (CamKII\u03b1) binding site upstream of the PICK1 binding site, was fused to the Tat CPP motif to render the peptide cell permeable (Tat-DATC24). This peptide blocked the interaction between PICK1 and DAT, as well as the interaction between CamKII\u03b1 and DAT, altogether reducing the amphetamine-induced dopamine efflux in striatum after local administration. Furthermore, the peptide significantly reduced the amphetamine-induced hyper locomotor activity after i.v. injection, suggesting that the administration of a PICK1 PDZ inhibitor will reduce the DAT-mediated effect of amphetamine. [176] PICK1 is a multifaceted protein that is involved in several essential pathways for synaptic plasticity and neurotransmitter homeostasis. Inhibitors of PICK1 have, with success, been investigated in relation to several indications. Nevertheless, the promiscuous role of PICK1 could suggest that targeting of PICK1 with a systemic intervention strategy could have unforeseen consequences in the PICK1-dependent homeostatic interplay between ion channels, neurotransmitter transporters, and kinases.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 201, "end": 206, "text": "[169,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 207, "end": 211, "text": "170]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 380, "end": 385, "text": "[169]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1258, "end": 1263, "text": "[171]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1624, "end": 1629, "text": "[148,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1630, "end": 1634, "text": "149]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2043, "end": 2048, "text": "[172]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2284, "end": 2289, "text": "[149]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2395, "end": 2400, "text": "[148]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2591, "end": 2596, "text": "[148]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2770, "end": 2775, "text": "[173]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3045, "end": 3050, "text": "[173]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3249, "end": 3254, "text": "[174]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3475, "end": 3480, "text": "[175]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3684, "end": 3689, "text": "[175]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3810, "end": 3815, "text": "[158,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3816, "end": 3820, "text": "176]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 4629, "end": 4634, "text": "[176]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 187, "end": 197, "text": "(Figure 7g", "ref_id": "FIGREF3"}, {"start": 1610, "end": 1620, "text": "(Figure 7g", "ref_id": "FIGREF3"}, {"start": 2268, "end": 2278, "text": "(Figure 7e", "ref_id": "FIGREF3"}, {"start": 2756, "end": 2766, "text": "(Figure 7g", "ref_id": "FIGREF3"}], "section": "Targeting the PDZ Domain of Protein Interacting with C Kinase 1"}, {"text": "The family of proteins encoded by the SHANK genes, and mutations therein, have been implicated in several neurological disorders including ASD, schizophrenia, and intellectual disability (Table S3 , Supporting Information).

The Shank proteins are translated in a variety of isoforms resulting from both intragenic promoters and alternative splicing exons (Uniprot: Q9BYB0). Furthermore, the SHANK genes seem to be further regulated by epigenetic factors. [181] The Shank proteins are all expressed in the excitatory synaptic regions, where they are crucial for proper synaptic transmission and function. [182] The canonical isoform of Shank3 (Uniprot: Mouse: Q4ACU6-1, Human: Q9BYB0-1), contains six ankyrin repeats, an SRC homology 3 (SH3) domain, a PDZ domain, a proline rich region (PRO), and a sterile alpha motif (SAM) (Figure 8a ). Although 30 different mutants have been found in the Shank3 gene, and at least three have been shown to associate to psychiatric diseases, none are positioned within the PDZ domain of Shank3. The variant Arg536 (R536W) is positioned in the linker region between the SH3 domain and the PDZ domain of Shank3, but does not interfere with the binding of C-terminal ligands nor changes the overall structure of the SH3-PDZ tandem. [183] Furthermore, several PTM sites have been predicted; however, none in the PDZ domain. The PDZ domains of the Shank proteins are members of the class I PDZ domains, with a His positioned in the \u03b1B1 helix, which is proposed to bind primarily C-terminal ligands with a S/T-x-\u03d5 motif (Figure 8b,c) . The PDZ domain of Shank3 interacts directly with the GluA1 subunit of AMPARs [184] and SAPAP1. [185] [186] [187] [188] SAPAP1 links Shank3 to the NMDARs through an interaction with the GK domain of PSD-95, which binds to NMDAR through its PDZ domains, as previously described. It was recently shown that the interaction between SAPAP3 and the PDZ domain of Shank3 was highly dependent on an N-terminal extension of the PDZ domain, which enhanced the peptide affinity significantly to 18 nm for SAPAP3 C15 (Figure 8h-j) . [40] The implication of Shank3 in neurological disorder has promoted the development of inhibitors toward its PDZ domain. A set of compounds was discovered by screening of a smallmolecule library [189, 190] containing a tetrahydroquinoline carboxylate core structure (Figure 8d,e) . The compounds were shown to displace the SAPAP1 hexapeptide with modest affinity in the 10-70 \u00b5m range. Interestingly, it was showed that inhibitor affinity was highly dependent on the oligomeric state of Shank3, [191] and that \u03b2PIX (p21-activated kinase interacting exchange factor) forms trimer complexes that can increase the local proximity and thereby the local concentration of the Shank3 binding region, thus increasing the affinity (Figure 8f ). [192] This inspired the design and synthesis of a series of monomeric, dimeric, and trimeric peptides targeting the PDZ domain of Shank1; however, peptide multimerization exhibited only a modest affinity increase (Figure 8g ).

Cross-species analysis shows that DVL1-3 are highly conserved and studies of mice with single DVL gene homologue knockout have shown phenotypes that range from defective social behavior to developmental defects, including abnormal heart, skeletal and cochlear morphologies, suggesting a unique role for each of the three single DVL genes. However, the analysis of double or triple DVL knockouts reveals novel and more severe phenotypes, suggesting an overlap or redundant functions of the DVLs. [204] Dvl1-3 are key mediators of the Wnt signaling pathway, which is evolutionary conserved and initiates signaling cascades that are crucial for embryonic development and maintenance of adult tissue homeostasis by regulating cell proliferation, differentiation, migration, genetic stability, apoptosis and maintaining adult stem cells in a pluripotent state. The Wnt signaling is commonly divided into the \u03b2-catenin-dependent (canonical) and independent (noncanonical) pathway. In the canonical signaling pathway, Wnt ligands, which are secreted glycoproteins, bind to the N-terminal extracellular cysteine-rich domain of the G proteincoupled receptor (GPCR) family Frizzled (Fz). [205] The signal is propagated through Dvl by a direct interaction between the internal recognition motif (KTXXXW) located in the C-terminal region of Fz and the Dvl PDZ domain, [202] followed by polymerization of Dvl, mediated by the DIX domain. The Dvl polymers function as structural scaffold platforms to further facilitate the dissemination of the Wnt signal, which leads to the activation of \u03b2catenin and T-cell factor (TCF)-dependent transcription of developmental genes and genes associated with tumorigenesis. [206] [207] [208] The noncanonical Wnt signaling pathway refers to a group of signaling pathways, which do not lead to \u03b2-catenin-dependent transcription. The two best-studied noncanonical signaling pathways, the planar cell polarity (PCP) and the Wnt-calcium pathways, are both initiated by Wnt binding to Fz followed by intracellular interaction with Dvl. However, the downstream interaction partners of Dvl and effectors differ between the two signaling pathways. Ultimately, the PCP pathway leads to a rearrangement of the cytoskeleton and thus polarization of the cell and the Wntcalcium pathway regulates the intracellular release of calcium from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). [209] Given the pleiotropic nature of the Wnt signaling cascades, it is not surprising that regulation of this pathway is associated with a variety of disease states, including fibrosis, neurodegeneration, and cancer (Table S3, Supporting Information). [203] Specifically, aberrant Wnt signaling has been reported in tumors from patients with hepatocellular carcinoma, hepatoblastoma, colorectal cancer, acute myeloid leukemia (AML), chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), multiple myeloma, and gastric cancer. [210] The impact of Wnt signaling on cancerogenesis of colorectal cancer is particularly well described and tightly connected to the loss of the protein adenomatous polyposis coli (APC), [211, 212] a downstream effector of Dvl and regulator of tumor suppressor genes. Functional loss of APC results in constitutive activation of Wnt signaling and thus promoting transcription of genes encoding oncoproteins. [213] Over the last decades, inhibition of the Wnt signaling pathway has emerged as an attractive intervention point for the treatment of cancer and several studies have identified inhibitors targeting various points along the pathway. [203] In particular, several small molecules and peptide-based inhibitors targeting Dvl have been described (Figure 9g) . The first Dvl inhibitor targeting the PDZ domain, NSC668036, was identified through receptor-based virtual screening of the National Cancer Institute (NCI) smallmolecule library [214] (Figure 9g) . Later, the same group developed a more potent small-molecule inhibitor, J01-017a, (K d = 1.5 \u00b5m) by combining 3D quantitative structure-activity relationship (3D-QSAR) analysis and structural studies. [215] Another Dvl-PDZ inhibitor, FJ9, was designed based on an indole-2-carbinol scaffold, and shown to block the interaction between the C-terminal of Fz and Dvl (K d = 29 \u00b5m) and to suppress tumor growth in vivo. [216] Next, a series of indole-2-amide-based Dvl inhibitors was described, with the aim to mimic the side chain interaction of fourth amino acids of native PDZ ligands. The optimized inhibitor, 6e, showed an IC 50 value of 23 \u00b5m. [217] The smallmolecule inhibitor, 3289-8625, was developed by a combination of in silico screening and structural analysis, [218] binds to Dvl with a K d of 11 \u00b5m, has cell permeable properties, and inhibits Wnt signaling pathways. [217] Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are best known for its pain-relieving properties by inhibiting cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes, but evidence suggests that NSAIDs also affect the Wnt signaling pathway. One such example is sulindac (Clinoril, Figure 9e ,f), which suppresses the canonical Wnt pathway in breast cancer, lung cancer, and colon cancer cell lines by binding to the PDZ domain of Dvl with an affinity of K d = 11 \u00b5m. [219] In another study, efforts in identifying small-molecule inhibitors targeting the Dvl PDZ domain were based on screening commercially available compound libraries, which identified 20 hits, with several compounds containing an indole ring. [220] KY-02052 and KY-02061 were identified as the lead compounds. Although KY-02052 significantly increased nuclear \u03b2-catenin, the compound showed severe cytotoxicity in cell viability assays and was not pursued further. Thus, KY-02061 (IC 50 = 24 \u00b5m) was shown to be the most active compound with less cytotoxic effects. [220] However, KY-02327 was later shown to have poor metabolic stability. To further develop KY-02327, 55 KY-02061 derivatives were constructed and KY-02327, containing a 2-aminoethyl piperidyl moiety at the carboxylic group, showed improved affinity (IC 50 = 3.1 \u00b5m), stability, is orally active, and dose-dependently regulated the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway. NMR experiments revealed that the binding site for KY-02327 is located in the canonical PDZ binding pocket, including three residues in the \u03b12-helix (V318, R322, and V325). [220] A more recent effort in developing small molecules targeting the PDZ domain of Dvl [221, 222] was initiated by generating a pharmacophore model, based on the X-ray crystal structure of Dvl PDZ/Dapper peptide complex and the NMR structure of Dvl PDZ/sulindac (Figure 9e,f) . [219, 223] The model was used to screen approximately 7 million virtual compounds and 19 initial hits were validated by surface plasmon resonance (SPR), which showed eight compounds that bind to Dvl PDZ. The four best hits all contained a phenoxyacetic acid group and with BMD4602 showing the highest affinity (K d = 11 \u00b5m). [221] This study was followed by the generation of two new pharmacophore models based on molecular dynamic (MD) simulations of the Idax peptide (RKTGHQICKFRKC)-Dvl PDZ interaction and three known X-ray crystal structures of synthetic peptides binding to Dvl PDZ. A virtual library comprising 8 million compounds was Figure 9 . a) Structure of pseudo class II inhibitory peptide C1 ( NH2-WKWYGWF -COOH , red) binding to the PDZ domain of segment polarity protein dishevelled homolog DVL-2 (Dvl2) (PDB: 3CBX). b) Hydrogen bonding network of C1 binding to the PDZ domain of Dvl2 show a higher extent of hydrogen bonding to the \u03b2B backbone than canonical binders, ending at P \u22126 amide hydrogen; furthermore, the interaction is stabilized by hydrogen bonding between P \u22121 /P \u22123 carbonyls and Arg 338 , and side chain interactions between P \u22123 (Tyr)/P \u22125 (Lys) and Asp 331 . c) Structure of noncanonical inhibitory peptide N2 ( NH2-GGEIVLWSDIP -COOH , red) binding to the PDZ domain DVL-2 (PDB: 3CC0). d) Hydrogen bonding network of N3 binding to the PDZ domain of Dvl2 shows an upward shifted insertion of the ligand, with hydrophobic insertion of P 0 (Trp) and P \u22122 (Val).

One compound, BMD4722, was confirmed as a PDZ domain binder (K d = 22 \u00b5m). The binding mode of BMD4722 was validated by NMR and shown to involve residues Ile267, Ser268, Ile269 (located in the \u03b22-sheet), Val323, and Arg325 (located in the \u03b12-helix). [222] Several peptide-based inhibitors for Dvl PDZ have been described, including three inhibitors which are based on the sequence of native Dvl PDZ interaction partners, and one inhibitor which is derived from phage display screening (Figure 9g) . The native-derived peptide sequences are based on C-terminal regions of TMEM88, Dapper (Dpr), or Idax, and these peptide inhibitors have primarily been developed and used as molecular probes for the Wnt signaling pathway. Generally, most PDZ interactions only require the last three to four amino acids in the C-terminal tail of the ligand. However, the Dvl PDZ has been shown to interact with internal motifs. This is the case for Idax, which interacts with Dvl PDZ via a KTXXXI motif, and is therefore a negative regulator of the Wnt signaling pathway. [224] The Idax peptide, Ac-RKTGHQICKFFRKC-NH 2 , binds to Dvl1 with a K d of 56 \u00b5m, which is in the range of native PDZ-ligand interactions. The binding mode was verified by NMR studies, which also confirmed the peptide to be located in the groove between \u03b12-helix and \u03b22-sheet. [225] In 2002, the C-terminal region of Dpr, a Dvl-dependent regulator of normal vertebrate development via the canonical Wnt-signaling pathway, was shown to interact with Dvl. [223] Specifically, the last four amino acids of the C-terminal tail of Dpr, SLKLMTTV, were suggested to be required for the interaction. [223] The Dpr/Dvl canonical interaction was confirmed by NMR. [223] The interaction between the Dvl PDZ/Dpr derived peptide was later validated and determined the affinity to K d = 11 \u00b5m [218] (Figure 9g ). The researchers responsible for the development of the small-molecule Dvl inhibitors, FJ9 and J01-017a, [215, 216] also designed peptide-based inhibitors. They started out by using a tripeptide template comprising VVV, which has been reported to have a \u03b2-strand-like structure in water. The interaction between PDZ Dvl and VVV was validated by NMR. Next, the amino acid side chain in position P \u22121 was examined for the improvement of the binding, and 18 proteinogenic amino acids at the P \u22121 positions in the VXV scaffold (X: any amino acid except Pro) were virtually introduced. The tripeptide VWV was simulated to have the highest binding energy and further validated by NMR and fluorescent binding experiments. The K d of VWV to PDZ Dvl1 was determined as 2 \u00b5m, compared to 71 \u00b5m for VVV. [219] Later, the transmembrane protein 88 (TMEM88), comprising a VWV motif in the C-terminal, was identified as Dvl binder and shown to attenuate the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling pathway. [226] Phage display has also been used to identify peptide-based inhibitors for Dvl. [42, 227] First, C-terminal phage-display peptide libraries comprising >10 10 unique members were used to identify ligands for Dvl2. Ten unique peptides were found and shown to have a preference for ligands comprising a \u2126\u03c6GWF Cterminal motif ( : hydrophobic residues, \u03c6: aromatic residues, Figure 9a ,b). [227] A second attempt used a phage display library comprising internal peptide ligands lacking the free C-termini, and identified 127 peptides that were grouped into three sequence families (N1-N3). Each subfamily contained a conserved Asp, which most likely substitutes for the free carboxylate on the C-termini. [42] The affinity and the binding mode of the three peptides (N1: WKDYGWIDGK, N2: SGNEVWIDGP, N3: EIVL-WSDIP) binding to the Dvl2 PDZ domain were characterized by X-ray crystallography (Figure 9c,d) and FP. A detailed study of the Dvl2 PDZ revealed a flexible binding cleft, which can accommodate both linear peptide motifs as well as internal ligands. The lead peptide N3, with a K d of 4.6 \u00b5m, was further validated by conjugating a CPP tag (antennapedia) and a fluorophore to the peptide, to enable intracellular location and visualization in HEK293S cells. Peptide N3 was readily internalized and inhibited canonical Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling in HEK293S in a dosedependent manner, and was shown to be at least ten times more potent compared to compound FJ9.

[228] Human Scribble is a 1630 aa protein comprising an N-terminal leucine-rich repeat (LRR) region followed by four PDZ domains and a flanking C-terminal tail (Figure 10a) . The protein is involved in the establishment of cell polarity, cell migration, and tight junctions. [228, 229] Dysregulation of Scribble has been shown to promote cell proliferation and tumorigenesis. Mammalian Scribble is part of an intracellular protein complex comprising disk large (Dlg1-5) and lethal giant larvae (Lgl1/2). This protein complex is located in the basolateral compartments of epithelial cells [230] [231] [232] [233] and is required for the establishment of apical-basal cell polarity and growth control. [234] Disruption of apical-basal polarity leads to uncontrolled cell proliferation and thus stimulates the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), which is a major factor in cancer development. [235] In addition, Scribble has been shown to be part of the Hippo pathway, an evolutionarily conserved kinase signaling pathway involved in organ size control and tissue homeostasis. [236] Scribble interacts with Fat1, a transmembrane receptor and an upstream regulator of the Hippo pathway, via its PDZ domains. However, this interaction mechanism is not conserved across species. The C-terminal amino acid sequence of Fat1 in human, mouse, and zebrafish constitutes a class I PDZ binding motif (HTEV). This binding motif has been reported as responsible for the interaction between Scribble and Fat1. Drosophila Fat-like protein has also been reported to interact with Scribble. This interaction, however, is not dependent on the C-terminal PDZ binding motif (HTEV), suggesting that Scribble recognizes an internal epitope in Drosophila. [237] Scribble is also interacting with the protein \u03b2-PAK-interacting exchange factor (PIX), a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for the small GTPases Rac1 and Cdc42a (Figure 10c-e) . [238] The interaction between the C-terminus of \u03b2-PIX (PAWDETNL) and the four PDZ domains of Scribble has been studied in detail. The X-ray crystal structures of the \u03b2-PIX peptide binding to PDZ1 and PDZ3 highlight how the binding preference and specificity is achieved (Figure 10d ). The PDZ1 interaction is dependent on the side chains of Leu 0 , Thr -2 , Glu -3 , and Trp -5 , while the primary determinant for the selectivity is Trp -5 . In PDZ1, the Trp -5 forms a hydrophobic interaction by www.advancedsciencenews.com www.advtherap.com Figure 10 . a) Domain organization of Scribble (Uniprot: Q14160) with PDZ ligand class preference of PDZ1-4 and Scribble C-terminal PDZ binding motif. b) Alignment (Clustal Omega) of Scribble PDZ1 and PDZ3 show about 40% full sequence conservation between PDZ1 and PDZ3. c) Structural overlay of scribble PDZ1 (PDB: 5VWK, grey) and PDZ3 (PDB: 5VWI, wheat) show high degree of structural conservation between the two domains. d) Structural overlay \u03b2PIX C8 peptide ( NH2-PAWDETNL -COOH ) (red: PDZ1 binding / blue: PDZ3 binding) with scribble PDZ1 (PDB: 5VWK, grey) show highly conserved backbone and side chain organization of \u03b2PIX P 0 -P \u22124 , but less conserved main chain and side chain configuration of \u03b2PIX P \u22125 -P \u22127 when binding to PDZ1 or PDZ3. e) Side chain interactions of \u03b2PIX/PDZ1 and \u03b2PIX/PDZ3 are also highly conserved. The \u03b2PIX/PDZ1 interaction is stabilized by side chain interactions (red arcs) between P \u22121 , P \u22122 , and P \u22123 with Ser 741 , His 793 , Ser 761 , respectively; furthermore, the interaction is stabilized by a CH-\u03c0 interaction (blue arc) between P \u22125 Trp and Tyr 751 . The \u03b2PIX/PDZ3 is stabilized by side chain interactions (red arc) between P \u22121 , P \u22122 , P \u22123 , and P \u22125 with Ser 1017 /Lys1040, His 1071 , Ser 1039 , and Ser 1026 , respectively; furthermore, the interaction is stabilized by a C \u03b1 H-\u03c0 interaction (blue arc) between P \u22125 Trp and Pro 1028 . f,g) Structure of the class II ligand NH2-SWFQTDL -COOH binding to the PDZ3 of the PDZ3-4 tandem of Scribble (PDB: 4WYU). The structure shows a secondary binding pocket (indicated by dark blue dashed line) besides the canonical (indicated by light blue dashed line) where P \u22124 Phe inserts into a hydrophobic patch between PDZ3 and PDZ4 and P \u22123 Gln is coordinated by two Ser residues in PDZ3 and PDZ4, respectively (not shown). Adv packing against Tyr751, whereas in PDZ3, the Trp -5 is rotated and forms a hydrogen bond interaction with Ser1026, while also forming a C \u03b2 H:\u03c0 interaction with Pro1028. Sequence alignment of all four Scribble proteins reveal that the selectivity profile of \u03b2-PIX can be attributed to sequence differences rather than structural differences (Figure 10b,c) . [239] The preference and selectivity for PDZ1 and PDZ3 over PDZ2 and PDZ4 was validated in a cellular context using endogenously expressed \u03b2-PIX. Further insight into the PDZ3-4 tandem showed that binding to PDZ3 of the class I ligand was enhanced by a secondary binding pocket forming between the canonical binding pocket in PDZ3 and the back side of the binding pocket of PDZ4 (Figure 10g ). [240] Phage display has been used to generate high-affinity peptide inhibitors targeting Scribble (Figure 10f ). [241] One of the most promising hits, RSWFETWV, was shown to bind to PDZ1, PDZ2, and PDZ3 with IC 50 values of 2.2, 4.7, and 3.9 \u00b5m, respectively.

Since then, several additional names including syntenin-1, syndecan binding protein 1 (SDCBP1), scaffold protein Pdp1, and pro-TGF-\u03b1 cytoplasmic domain-interacting protein 18 (TACIP18) have been employed. Syntenin has been shown to regulate transmembrane-receptor trafficking, tumor-cell metastasis, exosome production, and neuronal-synapse formation. [243] The syntenin gene (SDCBP1) is located on chromosome 8 [8q12.1] and encodes for a 33 kDa protein (298 aa), comprising a 113 aa unstructured N-terminal domain (NTD) followed by two adjacent PDZ domains and a short 24 aa C-terminal domain (CTD) (Figure 11a) . [243] Sequence analysis across species has shown that syntenin is highly conserved with homologues in rat, mouse, zebrafish, and Xenopus. [244] Loss of syntenin function in mice shows no major effects, with only a mild phenotype in intestinal homeostasis and auditory-cued fear memory reported. [245, 246] Syntenin is highly expressed during human fetal development and with relative low levels in adult tissue, [247] but a number of independent studies indicate that syntenin is overexpressed in various cancers, including melanoma, glioblastoma, breast cancer, and urothelial cell cancer. [244] The scaffolding activity of syntenin is mainly regulated by the two PDZ domains (Figure 11a,b) . Several NMR and X-ray crystal structures of ligands bound to syntenin reveal that interaction selectivity of the PDZ2 domain is determined by a combination of three binding pockets that bind amino acid side chains with different properties (Figure 11c,d,f) . For example, syndecan-4 interacts with PDZ2 via P \u22121 and P \u22122 (Figure 11e ), whereas the interleukin-5 receptor \u03b1 (IL-5R\u03b1) utilizes P 0 and P \u22121 (Figure 11f ). Structural analysis of PDZ2 bound to various peptide ligands reveals that the binding site can induce conformational changes in the \u03b12 helix, and thus adopt an induced fit, depending on the specific interaction partner. [243] Although most interaction partners of syntenin show a preference for PDZ2, Frizzled 7 (Fz7), insulinlike growth factor-1 receptor (IGF1R), and IL-5R\u03b1 have been described to have a higher affinity for PDZ1. [36, 248, 249] The PDZ domains of syntenin have also been found to interact with membrane lipids. In particular, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP 2 ) interacts with PDZ2. This interaction is also able to recruit the C-terminal of Fz7, forming a tridentate complex (Figure 11g) . [55] As PIP2 is not present in some cellular compartments, this would favor specific cellular locations of syntenin. [243] Syntenin has a unique function of facilitating both intracellular and extracellular events of invasion and has thus evolved as a promising target for cancer intervention. The first smallmolecule syntenin inhibitor, 113B7 (Figure 11h) , was developed by fragment-based drug design by NMR screening of an in-house assembled fragment library comprising about 5000 compounds against syntenin PDZ12. [250] Two fragments were identified to mainly interact with the PDZ1 domain and within the interface between the two PDZ domains. A combination of molecular docking and SAR studies guided the synthesis of the dimeric compound 113B7. The affinity was determined to K d = 21 \u00b5m by NMR and shown to inhibit syntenin binding to EGFRvIII. Treatment with 113B7 in an in vivo glioma model resulted in smaller, less invasive tumors and enhanced survival. [250] Phage display has been used to identify both internal and Cterminal peptide inhibitors of syntenin including more than 300 potential ligands. [251] The best-characterized phage display hit is the heptamer SKKEWYV peptide (Figure 11h ). This sequence corresponds to the C-terminal of nectin-1, a protein involved in cell adhesion. SKKEWYV binds to full-length syntenin with a K d of 14 \u00b5m. The interaction between syntenin and nectin-1 was further validated by immunoblots and co-localization of endogenous proteins in MCF-7.

[252] [253] [254] HTLV-1 is a human retrovirus, which infects CD4+ T lymphocytes. The HTLV-1 transcription factor Tax is a crucial element in malignant transformation of infected cells and it contains a C-terminal PDZ binding motif. [255, 256] Interestingly, the Tax protein in the closely related and non-leukemogenic HTLV-2 lacks this PDZ binding motif and has a significantly lower transformation potential than HTLV-1 Tax. [257] The human adenovirus type 9 (Ad9) E4 region ORF1 gene product, E4-ORF1, is another viral protein, which targets several PDZ-containing proteins through a C-terminal PDZ binding motif. Ad9 causes eye infections in humans but, in other mammalian species, the viral E4-ORF1 plays a key role in tumorigenesis. [258] Adv. Therap. 2019, 2, show very similar insertion of the two peptides into the binding pocket. c) Electron density map (2Fo-Fc) of the peptides shows very similar electron density distribution P 0 -P \u22124 , despite low sequence similarity. Especially the noncanonical interaction between P \u22124 (Lys) (5HT2A) and Glu 385 and P \u22124 (Arg) (HPV18-E6) and Glu 385 shows similar electron density suggesting targeted evolution of the HPV18-E6 toward mimicking endogenous PDZ ligands. d) Graphical model of the PDZbody [259, 275] where the HPV18-E6 protein binds to the canonical binding pocket in the optimized SAP-97-PDZ2 through its C-terminal residues. To obtain additional affinity and specificity, the optimized SAP-97 PDZ domain was fused to an \u03b1-helix from E6-associated protein (E6AP) through a Gly-Ser linker, making up the PDZbody [259] or PDZ-LxxLL chimera. [275] Human Papillomavirus (HPV) E6 and E7 hijack the cell during infection by interacting with endogenous proteins such as the well-described transcription factor and tumor suppressor, p53, and several PDZ-containing proteins. [259] By binding to the E6AP ubiquitin ligase, HPV E6 targets p53 and the PDZ domain proteins for degradation (Figure 12a) . [253, 260] Close to 200 different types of HPV have been documented, but only a small portion of these may cause cancer; the so-called high-risk HPVs. While HPV protein E6 has been shown to interact with p53 and E6AP in both low and high-risk HPVs, [260, 261] only the high-risk cancer-causing HPV E6 proteins contain a C-terminal PDZ binding motif, which is recognized by different PDZ domain proteins depending on the HPV strain. [262] High-risk HPV E6 proteins have been shown to associate with a plethora of Adv PDZ domain proteins including cell polarity proteins and tight junction proteins as well as trafficking and signalling proteins (for an extensive review, see ref. [255] ). PDZ binding motifs and interactions with PDZ domain proteins have also been reported for several other viruses such as hepatitis B virus, whose core protein has a noncanonical Cterminal PDZ binding motif that has been shown to interact with the PDZ domains of PDZ domain-containing protein GIPC1 (GIPC1) [263] and protein-tyrosine phosphatase PTPN3. [264] In severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus, PDZ binding motifs have been found in viral proteins, 3a and E, which play key roles in viral entry, release, and genome replication. Mutational analysis has shown that the presence of at least one functional PDZ binding motif in either 3a or E is necessary for virus viability. [265] In Kaposi's sarcoma herpesvirus, expression of the PDZ-LIM domain-containing protein 2 gene (PDLIM2) is repressed, which enables tumorigenesis and tumor maintenance in infected cells. [266] In HIV-1, syntenin is recruited to the plasma membrane in infected cells, and overexpression of syntenin has been shown to reduce HIV-1 infectivity. [267] A wide variety of PDZ domain proteins have been found to interact with viral proteins. However, a few PDZ domain proteins seem to be more common than others. This subset of cellular PDZ domain proteins is targeted by otherwise unrelated viral proteins, which demonstrates the importance of understanding these specific binding events and their cellular effect in the quest for developing new antiviral drugs.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 211, "end": 216, "text": "[252]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 217, "end": 222, "text": "[253]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 223, "end": 228, "text": "[254]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 444, "end": 449, "text": "[255,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 450, "end": 454, "text": "256]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 638, "end": 643, "text": "[257]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 950, "end": 955, "text": "[258]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1463, "end": 1468, "text": "[259,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1469, "end": 1473, "text": "275]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1786, "end": 1791, "text": "[259]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1814, "end": 1819, "text": "[275]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2042, "end": 2047, "text": "[259]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2167, "end": 2172, "text": "[253,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2173, "end": 2177, "text": "260]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2416, "end": 2421, "text": "[260,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2422, "end": 2426, "text": "261]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2599, "end": 2604, "text": "[262]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2679, "end": 2682, "text": "Adv", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2846, "end": 2851, "text": "[255]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3159, "end": 3164, "text": "[263]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3205, "end": 3210, "text": "[264]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3548, "end": 3553, "text": "[265]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3738, "end": 3743, "text": "[266]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3893, "end": 3898, "text": "[267]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 961, "end": 977, "text": "Therap. 2019, 2,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2152, "end": 2164, "text": "(Figure 12a)", "ref_id": null}], "section": "Targeting PDZ Domain Proteins Involved in Viral Infections"}, {"text": "Synapse-associated protein 97 (SAP-97) is transcribed from the DLG1 gene, which is widely expressed in humans and other vertebrates. It is, as previously described, part of the MAGUK family ( Figure S3 , Supporting Information). [268] SAP-97 plays a key role in regulating apico-basal polarity of epithelial cells as part of the highly conserved Scribble-Dlg-Lgl complex. Scribble is involved in the regulation of cell polarity, cell shape, adhesion, and several signaling pathways, [232, 233] as previously described. Both SAP-97 and Scribble have been shown to interact with HTLV-1 Tax PDZ binding motif, which affects their function and subcellular localizations, removing them from the cell membrane. [254, 269] Overexpression of HTLV-1 Tax has also been shown to inhibit the ability of SAP-97 to arrest cell cycle progression. [270] The HTLV-1 Envelope glycoprotein (Env) has also been shown to interact with SAP-97 during viral infection. HTLV-1 Env contains a canonical C-terminal PDZ binding motif, which is conserved in HTLV-2. However, a mutant virus lacking this motif has been found to be unable to recruit SAP-97, with a consequent reduced ability to transmit infection, which in nonmutant HTLVs occurs by triggering cell-cell contact between T lymphocytes. [271] While SAP-97 acts as a tumor suppressor in the case of HTLV-1, Ad9 E4-ORF1 protein is suspected of exerting a gain-of-function upon SAP-97, which disrupts its function in the tight junction and relocalizes to the plasma membrane, where it mediates phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) activation. [272] This activation of PI3K deregulates cytosolic signalling pathway, which leads to cell survival and metabolism, and enhances virus replication. [273] HPV E6 binds to and targets both SAP-97 (Figure 12b, c) and Scribble for proteasomal degradation through its C-terminal PDZ binding motif. [274] Because of the role HPV E6 plays in transforming infected cells into cancer cells, it is considered a potential drug target. HPV E6 binds E6AP and the PDZ domain proteins through two different epitopes; E6 contains a class I PDZ binding motif, while it recognizes a LxxLL-motif in an \u03b1 helix of E6AP. This was exploited in the generation of a double-epitope inhibitor by cloning and expressing an optimized SAP-97 PDZ domain linked to a motif-carrying \u03b1 helix of E6AP, both of which bind to the E6 protein at different sites. The measured K d of this bivalent binder, denoted PDZbody, was greatly improved compared to wild-type PDZ binding affinities (Figure 12d ). [259] A similar approach was employed by another group, who instead modelled the PDZ part of the double-epitope inhibitor after the MAGI1 PDZ2. [275] In addition to the more well-studied interactions with viral proteins from HTLV-1, Ad9, and HPV, SAP-97 and Scribble have also been associated with Hepatitis C virus. In infected cells, SAP-97 expression has been shown to decrease, while Scribble co-localized with the Hepatitis C core protein. [276] In HIV-1, SAP-97 has been shown to co-localize with the HIV-1 Gag protein and restrict infectivity.

In contrast to this, the non-tumorigenic Ad type 5 and type 12 are unable to bind ZO-2.

Inactivation of the GOPC gene has shown to trigger globozoospermia in mice. [283] Gene variants and mutations (Table S3 , Supporting Information). Gene rearrangements between the GOPC gene and ROS1 gene have been found in patients with lung adenocarcinomas [284] where osimertinib resistance is seen. [285] The emerging role of CAL is trafficking of several membrane proteins between intracellular compartments, primarily between the trans Golgi network (TGN), endosomes, and lysosomes, thus reducing receptor surface expression and promoting protein degradation (Figure 13a) .

[77, 289] In particular, the interaction between CFTR and CAL has been studied due to its role in cystic fibrosis, where CAL promotes degradation of CFTR in lysozymes, and thereby reduces the amount of CFTR expressed at the surface (Figure 13a ). [290] [291] [292] CAL is expressed as a 461 aa protein (Uniprot: Q9HD26), containing an unstructured N terminal region, a coiled-coil domain, a PDZ domain, and a C-terminal unstructured region, in many ways similar to PICK1, also containing unstructured N-and C-termini, a PDZ domain, and a multimerization domain (Figure 13c ). Three different isoforms resulting from alternative splicing have been found; isoform 2 lacks 7 residues in the coiled-coil domains, potentially affecting the homo and hetero-multimerization. Isoform 3 is truncated after position 319, and the remaining C terminal residues are substituted changing the C-terminal to a PDZ binding motif (Tyr-Leu-Val).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 315, "end": 320, "text": "[283]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 496, "end": 501, "text": "[284]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 540, "end": 545, "text": "[285]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 817, "end": 822, "text": "[286]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 823, "end": 828, "text": "[287]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 829, "end": 834, "text": "[288]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1035, "end": 1039, "text": "[77,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1040, "end": 1044, "text": "289]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1282, "end": 1287, "text": "[290]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1288, "end": 1293, "text": "[291]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1294, "end": 1299, "text": "[292]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 349, "end": 358, "text": "(Table S3", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 802, "end": 814, "text": "(Figure 13a)", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}, {"start": 1267, "end": 1278, "text": "(Figure 13a", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}, {"start": 1596, "end": 1607, "text": "(Figure 13c", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}], "section": "PDZ Domain Protein Targets in Cystic Fibrosis"}, {"text": "The PDZ domain of CAL contains a conserved His at the Nterminal of \u03b1B, indicative of a class I ligand preference (S/T-X-). Currently, 28 structures have been deposited in PDB, all showing the regular PDZ domain topology, with the primary difference in the \u03b2B-\u03b2C loop that in most cases is annotated with a partial helical structure, indicating a less flexible loop compared to other PDZ domains (PDB: 5IC3, 5K4F, 4Q6S). Interestingly, in most deposited structures, an aromatic residue (Trp, Phe, or Tyr) at position P \u22125 has a stacking interaction with His309, a feature that seems to act as a non-motif specificity residue (Figure 13b,d) . [293] Mutating this residue had a profound effect on affinity, resulting in a dramatic loss of affinity highlighting the importance of this upstream interaction. [293] To engineer selective PDZ domain inhibitors, 6223 known PDZ domain ligands were screened (11mer peptides) [294] using inverted peptide SPOT arrays [295] against five different PDZ domains, selecting 80 sequences for further examination. [296] From these 80 peptides, sequence alignment defined a consensus of S/T-x-L for peptides binding to CAL. A subset of the 80 peptides was further screened using a positional scan from P 0 to P \u221210 , with 20 different amino acids obtaining the C-terminal core peptide (P 0 -P \u22123 ). The optimized peptide was then combined with an N-terminal elongation library screening for P \u22124 and P \u22125 position selectivity. The peptide WPTSII resulting from this approach had a modest affinity of 33 \u00b5m. However, through optimizing the peptide for CAL, it lost affinity for the four other tested PDZ domains also interacting with CFTR, resulting in a 150-fold increase in selectivity. Elongating the peptide further to ten residues resulted in the final peptide, iCAL36 10 , with an affinity of 22.6 \u00b5m, which maintained selectivity for CAL (Figure 13d ,h). [296] Later, iCAL3610 was shown to be a competitive inhibitor of CFTR binding to CAL, which stabilized the dF508-CFTR variant surface expression and thereby increasing CFTR conductance. [297] Additional work on iCAL3610 showed that substituting P \u22121 Arg with a Lys coupled to fluorobenzene at the side chain amine increased the affinity twofold ( Figure 13h ). [298] Substitution of P 0 -P \u22122 , from Ser-Ile-Ile to Thr-Arg-Val (iCAL36 TRV ), was also shown to yield a modest increase in affinity (Figure 13e,h) . To make the peptide kCAL01 [299] (WQVTRV) cell permeable and more plasma stable, [300] the P \u22123 Val was substituted to Cys and fused to a CPP motif (CRRRRF) that, upon oxidation, formed an intramolecular di-sulfide bridge between P \u22123 Cys and the N-terminal Cys (Figure 13h ). [300] The peptide was found to bind to CAL with a K d of 493 nm under reducing conditions, while not binding to CAL under nonreducing conditions. Furthermore, it was shown that cyclization increased the serum half-life and cellular uptake compared to linear and non-CPP peptides, respectively. [300] Based on the core motif of iCAL3610 and iCAL3610 TRV , Calista Therapeutics developed a series of inhibitors combining the iCAL36 core motif and a Tat CPP moiety connected by different linkers. [301] The compounds (CT003 and CT004) had no significant additive effect on the CFTR conductance when administered together with VX809 (Lumacaftor). Acetylation of the N-terminal, insertion of an esterase cleavable linker, and C-terminal amidation (Ac-YGRKKRRQRRR-Glycoyl-WQVTRV-NH 2 , Figure 13h ) was found to enhance the effect of VX809, when measuring the channel conductance. Nevertheless, it remains unclear if the Nterminal amidation still allows for binding to the PDZ domain of CAL. [301] Recent work has shown that PDZ domain inhibitors of CAL can also be noncompetitive inhibitors and work through allosteric modulation of the canonical ligand binding. [93] Screening of a small-molecule library consisting of 5600 compounds, identified three compounds, iCAL1155, iCAL1113, and MD, [93] which all bound to the PDZ domain of CAL with affinities of 48-154 \u00b5m (Figure 13h ). While iCAL1155 and iCAL1113 primarily perturbed residues in and around the canonical binding pocket, MD was shown to perturb an area adjacent to the binding pocket, which was also confirmed by the X-ray crystal structure ( Figure 13h) . Here, the Cys side chain is covalently linked to MD, but this linkage was highly dependent on experimental conditions. In the case of iCAL1113 and iCAL1155, both compounds were found to be highly cytotoxic, affecting both cell proliferation and inducing cell apoptosis. [93] In another study, using of cysteine-reactive compounds ED (Figure 13h ) and EM was found to modulate the binding of HPV16 E6 to the PDZ domain of CAL (Figure 13f-h) . Although the ED, EM, and MD most likely have limited therapeutic use, targeting PDZ domains with allosteric inhibitors through reactive Cys residues might have other uses. Comparison of all PDZ domain sequences shows that 162 out of 267 PDZ domains contain one or more Cys in their sequence (Table S1 , Supporting Information). An example is the RGS3 (regulator of G protein signaling 3), which contains four Cys residues in its PDZ domains, three positioned in the bottom of the canonical binding pocket, potentially acting as a binding pocket gating mechanism (PDB: 2F5Y). The discovery that CAL is a key influencer of CFTR channel degradation and current modulator in bronchial epithelial cells led to the idea of targeting CAL for the treatment of cystic fibrosis in patients identified with the dF508 variant, increasing the surface lifetime www.advancedsciencenews.com www.advtherap.com of the channel and restoring channel conductance. However, high affinity and selective inhibitors of CAL are still to be developed.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 641, "end": 646, "text": "[293]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 803, "end": 808, "text": "[293]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 915, "end": 920, "text": "[294]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 956, "end": 961, "text": "[295]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1046, "end": 1051, "text": "[296]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1804, "end": 1806, "text": "10", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1892, "end": 1897, "text": "[296]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2078, "end": 2083, "text": "[297]", "ref_id": "BIBREF300"}, {"start": 2253, "end": 2258, "text": "[298]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2432, "end": 2437, "text": "[299]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2486, "end": 2491, "text": "[300]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2682, "end": 2687, "text": "[300]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2976, "end": 2981, "text": "[300]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3176, "end": 3181, "text": "[301]", "ref_id": "BIBREF304"}, {"start": 3668, "end": 3673, "text": "[301]", "ref_id": "BIBREF304"}, {"start": 3840, "end": 3844, "text": "[93]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3969, "end": 3973, "text": "[93]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 4566, "end": 4570, "text": "[93]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 624, "end": 638, "text": "(Figure 13b,d)", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}, {"start": 1875, "end": 1886, "text": "(Figure 13d", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}, {"start": 2239, "end": 2249, "text": "Figure 13h", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}, {"start": 2388, "end": 2402, "text": "(Figure 13e,h)", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}, {"start": 2667, "end": 2678, "text": "(Figure 13h", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}, {"start": 3462, "end": 3472, "text": "Figure 13h", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}, {"start": 4044, "end": 4055, "text": "(Figure 13h", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}, {"start": 4282, "end": 4293, "text": "Figure 13h)", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}, {"start": 4629, "end": 4640, "text": "(Figure 13h", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}, {"start": 4721, "end": 4735, "text": "(Figure 13f-h)", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}, {"start": 5029, "end": 5038, "text": "(Table S1", "ref_id": null}], "section": "PDZ Domain Protein Targets in Cystic Fibrosis"}, {"text": "Modern \"omics\" studies, combined with interaction arrays and peptide libraries, have been a key resource for mining new drug targets for human diseases.

[147] Even though many PPIs in the muscles are mediated through PDZ domains, such as the \u03b1-syntrophin-nNOS interaction, [304] their potential as pharmacological intervention points have not yet been suggested.

[305] Mints share a similar domain structure comprising a variable N-terminus and a more conserved Cterminus. The Mint1 N-terminus contains a Munc-18-interacting (MI) region followed by a calcium/calmodulin-dependent serine protease interacting (CI) region, while Mint2 contains only the MI region, and Mint3 has neither of the regions. The C-terminal region is conserved among all Mints and comprises a phosphotyrosine binding (PTB) domain, followed by an \u03b1-helical linker (ARM) and two tandem PDZ domains (Figure 15a) . [306] The relevance of Mints in AD first arose from the co-localization of Mints with the amyloid deposits in postmortem human brain slices. [307] However, the effects of Mint2 knockout in mice models of AD has been inconsistent, resulting in either increased or decreased amyloid beta (A\u03b2) levels. [308, 309] The molecular mechanism suggested for the role of Mints in AD involve the trafficking of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) to the \u03b3 -secretase complex promoted by PPIs between both Mint-APP and Mintpresenilin-1. [310] The PTB domain of Mint proteins interacts with APP C-terminal region peptide motif, YENPTY, while the first PDZ domain of Mint interacts with presenilin-1, a constituent of the \u03b3 -secretase complex. [311] [312] [313] [314] [315] A potential peptide inhibitor of the Mint(PTB)-APP or the Mint(PDZ)-presenilin interactions could reduce the A\u03b2 levels by preventing the recruitment of APP to the \u03b3 -secretase complex. Further evidence for this mechanism comes from the reduction in the A\u03b2 levels in mice brain after the genetic replacement of APP gene (APP) with a variant lacking the last 15 amino acids, including the YENPTY sequence. [316] In addition to presenilin and APP, some additional Mint interaction partners have been reported, which are also believed to play a role in the amyloidogenic pathway. [317] Another protein potentially relevant in the treatment of AD is HtrA1. In humans, this protein belongs to a family of proteases comprising HtrA1-4, and is composed of a regulatory N-terminal region, followed by a serine-protease domain and a C-terminal PDZ domain (Figure 15b ). [318] HtrA1 is widely expressed in human tissues, is enriched in the skin, reproductive tissues, and the brain, and is found both in the cytoplasm and in the extracellular space. [319] In the cortex of the human brain, it is the most expressed PDZ-containing protein, with almost twice the transcript-count of PSD-95. [147] Its expression is downregulated in some breast, brain, and liver cancers and it was described as a tumor-suppression factor promoting cell death. [320] The relevance of HtrA1 in AD was suggested first in 2005 due to its co-localization with A\u03b2 in human brain slides using immunohistochemistry. Furthermore, the incubation of an HrA1 protease inhibitor dose-dependently reduced the A\u03b2 levels in nontransfected astrocytes. [321] Later, it was demonstrated that HtrA1 could degrade aggregated tau protein, another critical feature in AD pathology, and that tau and HrA1 co-localize in human AD brain slices. [322] The role of PDZ domains in A\u03b2 and tau was recently investigated. In bacterial HtrA, PDZ domains exert allosteric control of the proteolytic activity. [323] This contrasts with human HtrA1, which does not require PDZ domains for fibril cleavage and disaggregation of both tau and A\u03b2 protein. [324] However, the length of cleavage products was influenced by the presence of the PDZ domain, suggesting that its precise function in substrate processing is still unclear. The discovery of PDZ ligands that can enhance the proteolytic activity of HtrA1, similarly to the bacterial HtrA, could represent a critical therapeutic intervention for AD.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 144, "end": 149, "text": "[305]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 666, "end": 671, "text": "[306]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 807, "end": 812, "text": "[307]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 965, "end": 970, "text": "[308,", "ref_id": "BIBREF311"}, {"start": 971, "end": 975, "text": "309]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1190, "end": 1195, "text": "[310]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1395, "end": 1400, "text": "[311]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1401, "end": 1406, "text": "[312]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1407, "end": 1412, "text": "[313]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1413, "end": 1418, "text": "[314]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1419, "end": 1424, "text": "[315]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1829, "end": 1834, "text": "[316]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2001, "end": 2006, "text": "[317]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2285, "end": 2290, "text": "[318]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2464, "end": 2469, "text": "[319]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2603, "end": 2608, "text": "[147]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2755, "end": 2760, "text": "[320]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3030, "end": 3035, "text": "[321]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3214, "end": 3219, "text": "[322]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3370, "end": 3375, "text": "[323]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3511, "end": 3516, "text": "[324]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 651, "end": 663, "text": "(Figure 15a)", "ref_id": "FIGREF1"}, {"start": 2270, "end": 2281, "text": "(Figure 15b", "ref_id": "FIGREF1"}], "section": "Potential Future PDZ Domain Protein Drug Targets"}, {"text": "In epithelial cells, the ability to define an apical and a basal compartment is an essential requirement to respond effectively to changes in the intra-and extracellular environment.

[326] Only Par3 and Par6 contain PDZ domains, which are C-terminally flanked by a Phox and Bem1 (PB1) domain in Par6, and a PB1-like homo-oligomerization domain in Par3. Par6 contains one PDZ domain, while Par3 has three (Figure 15c ).

There could therefore be concerns about achieving selectivity toward a specific PDZ domain. Moreover, it has also been realized that developing drug-like small-molecule inhibitors of PDZ domains is far from straightforward. A key issue is most likely the elongated binding pocket, where a C-terminal peptide is coordinated not only via the terminal carboxylate group, but also through a network of backbone hydrogen bonds, which seems to be difficult to mimic with small molecules. In accordance with this, the most advanced compounds targeting PDZ domain proteins are peptides.
