            "text": "\nIntroduction: Pulsed administration of steroids, which was frequently applied for the therapy of serious infectious diseases such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome [1] and Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome [2], often results in osteonecrosis. It was reported that the blockade of Src in mice may induce a defect in osteoclastic bone resorption leading to osteopetrosis [3]. Our previous studies also showed that persistent vascular hyperpermeability with extensive edema occurred during bone destruction within steroid-associated osteonecrotic lesions in a rabbit model [4], which were simultaneously accompanied with Src phosphorylation [5]. Accordingly, the hypothesis was that Src might play an important role in VEGF induced bone resorption in rabbit osteoclasts. Furthermore, a rabbit Src siRNA with high knock down efficiency have been identified by authors, which would facilitate the test of the hypothesis. Objective: To examine the effect of the silence of Src by siRNA on VEGF mediated bone resorption in rabbit osteoclasts. Materials and methods: VEGF was diluted in PBS. Lipofectamine\u2122 2000 (Invitrogen) was used as vehicle for siRNA delivery. Twenty-four hours before the treatment of 50 ng/ml VEGF [6], the rabbit Src siRNA si-1 with vehicle (RNAi-VEGF Group, n = 4) or Non-sense siRNA with vehicle (NC-VEGF Group, n = 4) or vehicle only (VC-VEGF Group, n = 4) was treated for rabbit osteoclasts in vitro. In parallel, 24 h before the treatment of same volume of PBS, the rabbit Src siRNA si-1 with vehicle (RNAi Group, n = 4) or Non-sense siRNA with vehicle (NC Group, n = 4) or vehicle only (VC Group, n = 4) was treated for rabbit osteoclasts in vitro. And then, 48 h after transfection, cells were collected. The mRNA expression level of Src and TRAP were quantified by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR), which was to evaluate the knock down efficiency of the Src siRNA and the bone resorption, respectively. Results: The rabbit Src siRNAs significantly reduced the rabbit Src mRNA expression in RNAi-VEGF and RNAi Group. For the bone resorption marker, the mRNA expression of TRAP in NC-VEGF and VC-VEGF Group was significantly higher than that in NC and VC Group. The TRAP mRNA expression in NC and VC Group was significantly higher than that in RNAi-VEGF and RNAi Group. There was no significant difference between NC-VEGF and VC-VEGF Group, no significant difference between NC and VC Group and no significant difference between RNAi-VEGF and RNAi Group on TRAP mRNA expression level. Conclusion: Src could play an important role in VEGF mediating the activation of rabbit osteoclasts in vitro.",
