SARS-CoV-2 was reported to enter cells via binding to ACE2, followed by its priming by TMPRSS2. Here, we investigate ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression levels and their distribution across cell types in lung tissue (twelve donors, 39,778 cells) and in cells derived from subsegmental bronchial branches (four donors, 17,521 cells) by single nuclei and single cell RNA sequencing, respectively. While TMPRSS2 is strongly expressed in both tissues, in the subsegmental bronchial branches ACE2 is predominantly expressed in a transient secretory cell type. Interestingly, these transiently differentiating cells show an enrichment for pathways related to RHO GTPase function and viral processes suggesting increased vulnerability for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our data provide a rich resource for future investigations of COVID-19 infection and pathogenesis.",

As suggested for SARS-CoV-2, these two coronaviruses had a zoonotic origin with human-to-human transmission after their outbreak (de Wit et al, 2016) . Deaths by SARS-CoV-2 were solely reported for the critical cases (49%), mainly for patients with preexisting comorbidities such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, hypertension, or cancer (Wu & McGoogan, 2020) . Although COVID-19 has a milder clinical impairment compared to SARS and MERS for the vast majority of patients, SARS-CoV-2 infection shows dramatically increased human-to-human transmission rate with the total number of deaths significantly exceeding those of SARS and MERS patients already within the first three months of the COVID-19 outbreak. The emergent global spread of SARS-CoV-2 and its strong impact on public health immediately demands for joint efforts in biomedical research increasing our understanding of the virus' pathogenesis, its entry into the host's cells, and host factors facilitating its fast replication that explains the high human-to-human transmission rates.",

            "text": "SARS-CoV-2 is an enveloped virion containing one positivestrand RNA genome, and its sequence has already been reported (Chan et al, 2020; Lu et al, 2020; Wu et al, 2020a,c; Zhou et al, 2020) . The genome of SARS-CoV-2 comprises 29.9 kb and shares 79.5% and 96% identity with SARS-CoV and bat coronavirus, respectively . Coronaviruses were reported to use different cellular entry mechanisms in terms of membrane fusion activities after receptor binding (White & Whittaker, 2016) . SARS-CoV was previously shown to bind to angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 (ACE2) for cell entry, mediated via the viral surface spike glycoprotein (S protein; Gallagher & Buchmeier, 2001; Li et al, 2003; Simmons et al, 2013) . Comparison of the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 S protein sequence revealed 76% protein identity (Wu et al, 2020c) , and recent studies reported that SARS-CoV-2 is also binding to ACE2 in vitro (Hoffmann et al, 2020; Walls et al, 2020; Yan et al, 2020; Zhou et al, 2020) . Subsequently, the S protein is cleaved by the transmembrane protease serine 2 TMPRSS2 (Hoffmann et al, 2020) . Simultaneously blocking TMPRSS2 and the cysteine proteases CATHEPSIN B/L activity inhibits entry of SARS-CoV-2 in vitro (Kawase et al, 2012) , while the SARS-CoV-2 entry was not completely prohibited in vitro (Hoffmann et al, 2020) . It remains to be determined whether additional proteases are involved in priming of the SARS-Cov-2 but not SARS-CoV S protein. One candidate is FURIN as the SARS-CoV-2 S protein contains four redundant FURIN cut sites (PRRA motif) that are absent in SARS-CoV. Indeed, prediction studies suggest efficient cleavage of the SARS-CoV-2 but not SARS-CoV S protein by FURIN (Coutard et al, 2020; preprint: Wu et al, 2020b) . Additionally, FURIN was shown to facilitate virus entry into the cell after receptor binding for several coronaviruses, e.g., MERS-CoV (Burkard et al, 2014) but not SARS-CoV (Millet & Whittaker, 2014) . While FURIN is generally membranebound, an active isoform has been described that can be secreted, potentially facilitating cleavage of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein in the cellular neighborhood (Vidricaire et al, 1993) . In addition, although ACE2 was previously described to be expressed in the respiratory tract (Jia et al, 2005; Ren et al, 2006; preprint: Sungnak et al 2020; Xu et al, 2020; preprint: Zhao et al 2020; Zou et al, 2020) , still little is known about the exact cell types expressing ACE2 and TMPRSS2 serving as entry point for SARS-CoV and the currently emerging SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, there is an urgent need for investigations of tissues in the upper and lower airways in COVID-19 patients but also healthy individuals to increase our understanding of the host factors facilitating the virus entry and its replication, ultimately leading to treatment strategies of SARS-CoV-2 infections. As pointed out recently , our understanding of host genetic factors involved in COVID-19 disease outcome is still poor.",

All major cell types known to occur in the lung were identified (Fig 1B and C) . Independent of the cell types present in the lung, the median ACE2 levels were below five counts per million (CPM) (Fig 1D) , which given a typical mRNA content of 500,000 mRNA molecules per cell indicate that only about half of all cells were statistically expected to contain even a single ACE2 transcript. The reads per patient and cell type were therefore aggregated into pseudo-bulks, and analysis was continued. As expected from prior literature, the AT2 cells showed highest ACE2 expression in the lung both in terms of their CPM values ( Fig 1D, further referred to as ACE2 + cells, P-values in Fig EV1) and the percentage of positive cells ( Fig EV2) . Further visualizations of expression levels and localization are shown in Fig EV3. The expression of TMPRSS2 across cell types of the lung (further referred to as TMPRSS2 + cells) was much stronger with a certain specificity for AT2 cells (Fig 1E, Pvalues in Fig EV1) , which is in agreement with other studies (preprint: Sungnak et al, 2020) .",

In this dataset, we identified all expected cell types, including recently described and rare cell types such as FOXN4-positive cells and ionocytes ( Fig 1F, Appendix Fig S1 and S2 ). Expression levels of ACE2 were comparable or slightly elevated compared to the lung tissue samples, with the strongest expression being observed in a subset of secretory cells (\"secretory3\"; Figs 1G and EV1-EV3). Note that due to possible technical differences between single nuclei RNA-Seq (lung) and single cell RNA-Seq (HBECs), the CPM values are not quantitatively comparable. While TMPRSS2 was less strongly expressed in HBECs than in lung tissue cells, its expression was still markedly higher than that of ACE2 (Figs 1H and EV1-EV3). Interestingly, the cell population enriched for ACE2 + cells was also the one most strongly expressing TMPRSS2 (Figs 1G and H, and EV3) . In the HBECs, a significant enrichment of the number of ACE2 + /TMPRSS2 + double-positive cells was observed (1.6-fold enrichment, P = 0.002, Fig EV4) . ",

As airway epithelial cells are known to continuously renew in a series of differentiation events involving nearly all major HBE cell types in a single trajectory, we mapped the \"secretory3\" cells according to their position in this hierarchy using reversed graph embedding implemented in Monocle as pseudo-time mapping (Fig 2A; Qiu et al, 2017) . \"Secretory3\" cells were found at an intermediate position between club or goblet cells and ciliated cells (Fig 2A) , which could be confirmed by shared marker gene expression ( Fig 2B) . This placed \"secretory3\" cells at a point shortly before terminal differentiation is reached (Fig 2C and D) . Hence, we will refer to these cells as \"transient secretory cells\". In agreement with ongoing differentiation toward an epithelial cell lineage, the cell-specific markers of the transient secretory cells showed an enrichment of RHO GTPases and their related pathways ( Fig 2E) . Note that we find this enrichment of pathways exclusively in the transient secretory cells but in none of the other cell types. As RHO GTPases have been implicated in membrane remodeling and the viral replication cycle, especially entry, replication, and spread (Van den Broeke et al, 2014), transient secretory cells may be more permissive to SARS-CoV-2 infection adding to a potential vulnerability caused by considerably high co-expression levels of ACE2 and TMPRSS2. Interestingly, marker genes for transient secretory cells were not enriched in any of the cell types in the whole lung indicating the absence of this transient secretory cell type in the lung samples.",

            "text": "We next sought to explore whether we could derive additional evidence for other factors recently suggested to be involved in SARS-CoV-2 host cell entry. Therefore, we investigated the expression of FURIN, as SARS-CoV-2 but not SARS-CoV was reported to have a FURIN cleavage site in its S protein, potentially increasing its priming upon ACE2 receptor binding. In lung tissue, we detected an overall high expression of FURIN ( Fig 3A) . Across cell types, we observed a marked enrichment of the number of double-and triplepositive cells for any combination of ACE2, TMPRSS2, and/or FURIN expression, indicating a preference for co-expression (Figs 3B, EV2, and EV3). Interestingly, also transient secretory cells in the HBECs showed an intermediate expression of FURIN ( Fig 3C) . While TMPRSS2 and FURIN were less strongly expressed in HBECs than in distant cells from surgical lung tissue, their expression was still markedly higher compared to ACE2. In the HBECs, a significant enrichment of the number of ACE2 + /TMPRSS2 + double-positive cells was observed, while ACE2 + /TMPRSS2 + /FURIN + enrichment did not reach significance ( Fig 3D) . The latter finding, however, may be due to differences in co-expression or the generally lower number of positive cells reducing statistical power. Interestingly, our data showed that the additional possibility of priming the SARS-CoV-2 S protein by FURIN would potentially render 25% more cells vulnerable for infection as compared to by exclusively TMPRSS2 S protein priming. Notably, FURIN was previously reported to be also secreted and active in neighboring cells (Vidricaire et al, 1993) . Thereby, the expression of FURIN in only some cells in lung tissue or bronchial branches may have a strong impact on the entire cellular neighborhood, dramatically increasing the likelihood for an infection with SARS-CoV-2 of all ACE2 + cells in these tissues. However, the presence of the secreted FURIN protease in cells that do not express FURIN remains to be validated by biochemical approaches. Overall, our data suggest that FURIN might increase overall permissiveness of cells in the respiratory tract by potentially equipping more cells with proteolytic activity for SARS-CoV-2 S protein priming after ACE2 receptor binding.",

Although no dependency of ACE2 expression on age, gender, and sex was found in single cell populations, we observed interesting trends in the lung for age and gender dependencies when aggregating all reads per sample into a single ACE2 expression value (Fig 4G and  H) . Here, we see a trend for increasing overall expression of ACE2 with age for all female lung samples (R 2 = 0.40; P = 0.065). Since we only have samples from males of younger age available, we cannot study age dependencies for males here. However, when comparing ACE2 expression of all five female and three male samples in the young age group between 40 and 50 years of age, we see a clearly higher overall expression of ACE2 in males compared to females (P = 0.048).

We believe the unprecedented depth of our analysis on a single cell level will provide a valuable resource for future mechanistic studies and target mining for pulmonary host factors that are involved in facilitating virus entry and replication, ultimately leading to defining genes that are of urgent interest for studying transcriptional changes in COVID-19 patients or the SARS-CoV-2 pathogenicity in general. This dataset comprises 16 individuals and a total of 57,299 cells. Thus, this large single cell and nuclei expression resource enables the analysis of weakly expressed genes such as ACE2 as well as the identification of rare cell types and a transient secretory cell type, for which our data showed a particularly high level of potential vulnerability for SARS-CoV-2 infection, assuming that ACE2 is the receptor that is likely to be crucial for its cell entry. Although we strongly believe that the here presented data are well suited as reference dataset to study SARS-CoV-2 infection on the single cell transcriptional level, we are also well aware of potential limitations of our data.",

However, we deem our data clinically meaningful as our patient cohort is representative for those being affected by SARS-CoV-2-associated disease. The patient cohort analyzed here is in line with recently published data on characteristics of COVID-19 patients with regard to age (this study: median age 48 years-lung cohort or 55 years-HBEC cohort; Chen et al, 2020: 55 years; Guan et al, 2020: 47 years) Guan et al, 2020; Guan NEJM, Chen Lancet) and especially comorbidity burden with 50% of the patients being affected by chronic cardiovascular or pulmonary disease or diabetes (this study: 50%; Chen et al, 2020: 51%; Guan et al, 2020: no data available). There was a different prevalence of smoking or history of smoking in our cohort (this study: 25%-lung cohort or 100%-HBEC cohort; Guan et al, 2020: 85%) Second, we are combining data of different sections of the lung and use two different RNA sequencing methods on single cell level. While single cell RNA sequencing typically delivers higher quality data, the cells must be intact for processing, as damaged cells present a loss of RNA molecules with mitochondrial reads preferentially retained, introducing a skewed expression profile (Luecken & Theis, 2019) . This is not observed in single nuclei RNA sequencing, as mitochondria are lost during nuclei isolation. In our HBEC data, we see a preferential increase in the percentage of mitochondrial reads in certain cell populations rather than across cell types, which may hint toward a physiologically increased energy requirement, for example, due to high levels of protein synthesis in secretory goblet cells (Appendix Fig S3) . Adequate sampling of lung specimen for preparing suspensions of intact cells is often challenging. Single nuclei RNA sequencing also reveals transcriptome data on single cell level and can be used on frozen tissue. This method typically provides a more faithful estimate of cell type proportions due to lessened dissociation bias. On the other hand, it typically comes with less reads per cell and less genes detected (Bakken et al, 2018) , although this bias seems low in our dataset, as the number of both detected genes and unique molecular identifiers (UMIs) is comparable across samples in both datasets (Appendix Fig S3) . The identification of closely related cell populations is mostly concordant in both methods, with single cell RNA sequencing being inferior for detection of lowly expressed genes on a single cell level (Bakken et al, 2018) .",

Further evidence for an involvement of FURIN in the entry of SARS-CoV-2 into the host cell comes from very recent studies predicting an increased binding affinity between the SARS-CoV-2 S protein and the human ACE2 receptor as compared to the SARS-CoV S protein (Wrapp et al, 2020; preprint: Wu et al, 2020b) . Wu et al postulate that the cleavage of the S protein at the FURIN cut site might cause the increased binding affinity of SARS-CoV-2 to its receptor, e.g., triggered by structural rearrangements of the cleaved S protein as it was previously shown for other coronavirus S proteins (Kirchdoerfer et al, 2016; Walls et al, 2016; Wrapp et al, 2020) .

Taken together, these data offer the interesting aspects that both high human-to-human transmission rate of SARS-CoV-2 and the severe COVID-19 cases might be caused by additional cleavage sites, resulting in higher ACE2 binding affinity and/or more efficient membrane fusion. The most striking finding of this study was the detection of the transient secretory cell population in the bronchial branches expressing ACE2. Subsequent cell type marker analysis revealed that these cells reflect differentiating cells on the transition from club or goblet to terminally differentiated ciliated cells, the latter having an important role in facilitating the clearance of viral particles (Sims et al, 2008; Dumm et al, 2019) . RHO GTPase activating CIT and viral processes regulating pathways, i.e., processes related to membrane remodeling or the immune system, are strongly enriched in the transient secretory cells. Interestingly, about 40% of the ACE2 + transient secretory cells are co-expressing the protease TMPRSS2 that is known to be involved in S protein priming, making this cell type potentially vulnerable for SARS-CoV-2 infection. If we include FURIN as another protease priming in SARS-CoV-2 entry of the host cell, the percentage of transient secretory cells expressing the receptor ACE2 and either both or one of the proteases TMPRSS2 and FURIN increases in the lung to 50%. Hence, transient secretory cells would be potentially targetable by SARS-CoV-2 infection.",

After reaching confluency, cells were transferred to 12-well plates and plated at 90,000 cells/insert using the ThinCert TM with 0.4 lm pores (#665641, Greiner Bio-One). After 2-3 days, cells were airlifted by removing the culture from the apical chamber and Pneu-maCult-ALI media (StemCell) was added to the basal chamber only. Differentiation into a pseudostratified mucociliary epithelium was achieved after approximately 24-27 days. Afterward, ALI cultures were characterized for their proper differentiation using Uteroglobin/CC10 (#RD181022220-01, BioVendor), Mucin 5AC (#ab3649, Abcam), Keratin 5 (#HPA059479, Merck) and Tubulin beta 4 (#T7941, Merck). To do so, filters were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA, Merck) and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 (Merck). First antibodies were applied over night at 4\u00b0C. Filters were incubated with Alexa Fluor 488 and 549 secondary antibodies (Dianova) for 40 min at 37\u00b0C. DNA was stained using Hoechst 33342 (#B2261, Merck).
