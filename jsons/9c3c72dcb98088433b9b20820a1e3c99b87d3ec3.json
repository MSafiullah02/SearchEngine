The second level of sampling was stratified by urban and rural locations. Within each location, the DSPs were randomly selected within the system with probability proportional to the population size of the locations. At least two DSPs were selected within each province/autonomous region/municipality. A total of 125 surveillance points in 31 provinces were used (eFigure A1). At each DSP, three sub-districts in urban areas or townships in rural areas were randomly selected in the 4th stage. Then two neighborhood communities or administrative villages were randomly chosen within each sub-district/township. One group of villagers with at least 150 households was randomly selected within each neighborhood community or administrative village. At last, 100 households within each group of villagers were randomly chosen. In the final stage, one family member who was at least 40 years old was selected randomly from each household using a Kish selection table.",
