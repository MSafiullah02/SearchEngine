This pandemic has created an explosion of clinical trials in attempts to reach any promising treatment for this virus. Potential treatments are varied; ranging from antimalarials and antivirals to natural honey. Scientists have collaborated across institution and country lines in an unprecedented fashion, to evaluate potential COVID-19 therapies [1]. Most promising among these efforts are randomized controlled trials (RCTs), which represent the highest level of evidence which informs clinical decision-making in the evidence-based medicine era.",

The global research community is rushing to find a public health solution and potential therapies to COVID-19, but a poorly coordinated effort will likely yield poor results [2]. To date, most trials are small in scale, which limits the power of these studies and introduces biases that can confound results. Results may look promising in their current sample size but are often not generalizable to a large population scale, or vice-versa [4]. When attempting to synthesize information from small sample case series and single-centre trials, there is often heterogeneity in methodology that limits data pooling and reduces meaningful conclusions for appropriate treatment decisions [5, 6]. Therefore, fewer large-scale, methodologically sound studies are more useful than multiple, low-quality, small trials. Orthopaedic literature has shown that conducting insufficiently sized and powered trials has a risk of not only missing true effects but can produce false ones as well [7].",

The RSV for each trial was trended from Feb 5th to April 22nd and the average RSV over this time was calculated. February 5th represents the date of the first posted clinical trial on clinicaltrials.gov.

An early review of COVID-19 trials demonstrated an unacceptable quality of the sample size calculations and urged researchers to ensure statistically appropriate sample sizes to reduce the risk of under-powered studies [16]. Small, heterogenous trials also make it more challenging to pool results and make findings in meta-analyses less reliable and more difficult to interpret [17, 18].

The rise of clinical trials following the spike of public interest begs the question\u2014are priorities and resources being allocated based on scientific merit, or driven by public consciousness and speculation? Public interest in hydroxychloroquine spiked after a non-randomized open-label clinical trial in France demonstrated reduced viral loads in COVID-19 patients who received hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin [20]. These findings were widely promoted by prominent political leaders which spiked both public and scientific interest. However, the study was deeply flawed methodologically, and more recent studies have demonstrated no benefit [21]. Currently, no governing bodies recommend hydroxychloroquine as a potential therapeutic agent, and it is not being recommended for use outside clinical trials [22]. The emphasis on clinical trials investigating hydroxychloroquine may reduce the ability to test other promising therapies through a reduction in available resources and recruitment competition.",
