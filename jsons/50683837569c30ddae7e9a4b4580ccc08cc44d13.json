From the beginning of April 2020, the nationwide lockdown started to show early effects by reducing the total cumulative incidence reached by the epidemic wave. This allows the government to program the measures to loosen lockdown restrictions for the so called \"Phase 2\". Here we provided the reproduction number estimation both in space and in time from February 24 th to April 24 th , 2020 across two months into the epidemic. Our estimates suggest basic reproduction number averaged over all the regions of 3.29, confirming that epidemiological figures of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic in Italy are higher than those observed at the early stage of Wuhan (China) outbreak. Based on the SARS-CoV-2 transmission dynamics reported here, we gave a quantitative evaluation of the efficiency of the government measures to low the reproduction number under the unity (control regime). We estimated that among the worst hit regions in Italy, Lombardy reached the control regime on March 22 nd followed by Emilia-Romagna (March 23 th ), Veneto (March 25 th ) and Piemonte (March 26 th ). Overall, we found that the mean value of time to reach the control regime in all the country is about 31 days from the February 24 th and about 14 days from the first day of nationwide lockdown (March 12 th ). Finally, we highlighted the interplay between the reproduction number and two demographic indices in order to probe the \"state of activity\" of the epidemic for each Italian region in the control regime. We believe that this approach can provide a tool in the management of \"Phase 2\", potentially helping in challenging decision to continue, ease or tighten up restrictions.",

To minimize the likelihood that people who were not infected come into contact with people who had contracted the disease, the Italian government imposed a series of progressively more strict social distancing measures which culminated in a national lock-down announced on March 11th, 2020. [2] Around two months from the first case and more than 190,000 confirmed positive cases later, from the beginning of April, the effect of the nationwide lockdown started to achieve some level of success and the number of new infections began to smoothly decrease. These early signs of a slowdown of the COVID-19 pandemic in Italy provide a comforting picture of the outbreak's stabilization which is driving the government to periodically review its lockdown measures in view of the so called \"Phase 2\", i.e. the period during which citizens will have to live together with the virus as of all the industrial sector, including the nonessential economic activities, will start to reopen. However, since the regional differences in the number of new positive cases has been reported to be huge, with the Northern regions of Italy (namely Lombardia) being most affected, the establishment of the proper precautions to plan the \"Phase 2\" is a truly complicated task.",

In this context, the systematical estimation of key epidemiological parameters, for each region can provide insight into the speed at which the disease had spread and will give a useful tool to figure out if a differential approach at the regional level on the measures to apply for \"Phase 2\" is feasible to keep down the transmission of SARS-COV2. At the beginning of epidemic and during the lockdown phase, Italian Government and the mainstream of the local and national mass media have been emphasized the relevance of the basic reproduction number (R0) , i.e. the average number of secondary cases generated by a single primary case in a theoretically fully susceptible (100%) population, as the most important and informative parameter to monitor the epidemic trends. Obviously, R0 has an undoubted relevance since when R0 > 1 the infection may spread in the population and more R0 is large and deeper would be the interventions needed to control the epidemic. On the other hand, if R0 < 1, on average the infectious individual infects less than one person and the epidemic falls in a so called \"control regime\" where it will not be sustained, and it will die out.

[13] Therefore, large data noise is general observed, especially at the regional level, which requires a careful inspection of the epidemic curve as well as data smoothing in order to avoid unrealistic reproduction number estimation.

[14] Taking these preliminary considerations into account, our result of R0 = 3.22 for Italy is highly consistent with values obtained by fitting the exponential growth rate of the infection across a 1-month period. [12] Similar conclusion has been drawn for Northern regions transmission dynamics and the same results were found for the Southern regions. [12] In another work, Riccardo F. et al. [2] reported R0 ranging from 2.50 to 3.00 for six selected Italian regions (Lombardia, Veneto, Emilia-Romagna, Toscana, Lazio, Puglia). Despite these values are lower than R0 obtained here, a variability of ~ 0.5 for most of the regions is thus confirmed independently of geographical location. Again, Gatto et al. [15] , while including additional parameters like mobility and the spatial distribution of communities, determined a comparable initial generalized reproduction number R0 = 3.60. Overall, these data support the idea that epidemiological figures of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic in Italy are slightly higher than those observed at the early stage of outbreak in Wuhan (China).

Indeed, as observed for SARS outbreak, [9] in the early stage of the epidemic the time dependence of Rt shows a fluctuating pattern characterized by wide confidence interval raised by the initial low number of cases used in the calculations. In this context, the superspreading events cannot be necessarily triggered by a single infector, but it can be related to few people which are perpetuating an epidemic in the susceptible population. [13] Here we observed that most of the regions have faced \"super-spread events\" in the early stage of epidemic. and significant is the observation of such event in southern regions After the early stages, the Rt showed a decreasing trend which is likely to be affected by the temporal depletion of susceptible individuals (intrinsic factors) and by the implementation of control measures (extrinsic factors). [17] Both these factors slow down the growth rate of incidence and deeply affect the shape and time scaling of the epidemic peak driving Rt to fall below 1.

Although the Italian Government's restrictive measures have proven to be of considerable utility in preventing even more devastating effects from the epidemic, the challenge in tackling \"Phase 2\" appears even more demanding. In this line, obtaining simple and effective indices to evaluate the state of activity of the epidemic seems mandatory: if the Rt index remains essential for understanding the trend in a given area, however it is not the only parameter to account for. Briefly, if we consider two areas with the same Rt, that of the two that has a population density and a higher percentage of infected people must be considered more at risk, monitored more carefully and potentially the target of more timely restrictive measures.",

The same tendency is shown in by the central region Lazio with R0 = 3.62. Apart the Southern regions Basilicata (R0 = 2.73), Molise (R0 = 2.52), Umbria (R0 = 2.44) showing the lowest values, the reproduction number R0 ranges from 3.00 to 3.49 in the rest of the country. The observed distribution of R0 related to all the country is reported in Figure 2(b). The time evolution of reproduction number Rt for each region plus Italy is reported in the lower part of the panels of Figures S1-S3. All the Rt profiles exhibited similar qualitative patterns characterized by large initial Rt values followed by the decreasing over time of the parameter reaching Rt \u2272 1 close to the peak of daily incidence (~ 20-30 days). Below this value, Rt further decreases featuring a sort of plateau in the Rt < 1 \"control regime\" as detected for the country and for most of the regions. Uncertainty decreases over time because of the increased number of cases but at the end of the data range considered (50-60 days) the estimates exhibited wide confidence intervals reflecting the stochasticity for those regions presenting small number of cases. In Figure 2(c) we presented the distribution of the first day (from the onset February 24, 2020) when the time evolution of Rt converges to \u22721 in each region. In Table 2 the same results are listed with the corresponding calendar date together with the median Rt values determined in the last 7-day time window (April, 18t h -24 th ). Finally, in Figure 3, median Rt values in the last 7-day time window (Table 2) are plotted in a three-dimensional array as a function of DA (Total number of active cases / km2) as recorded on April 24 th and population density, for all the Italian region. The array shows that similar Rt are not related to similar demographic (i.e. population density) or epidemic (i.e. DA) risk factors. All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.",

Indeed, in these regions the overshoot of the Rt observed in the first 10 days, can be likely correlated with the uncontrolled movement of people leaving the most affected northern regions to south of Italy at the beginning of March. Furthermore, it should be noted that in some regions like Valle D'Aosta and Veneto, Rt sudden increases around the second week of March. Such modulations can be associated to the changes in the testing practices which promptly affected the ratio between the number of new confirmed symptomatic cases and the number of swabs owing to the step like increase of daily incidence.",

The last Italian region reached the control regime is the southern region Molise on 1 st April due to delay of the epidemic onset. Based on the timing of the targeted (March 9 th ) and nationwide (March 12 nd ) lockdowns, this provides a direct evidence of the burden of social distancing measures introduced to control the epidemic.
