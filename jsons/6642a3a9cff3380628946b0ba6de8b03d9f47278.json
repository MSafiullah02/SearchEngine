Early diagnosis and preventive measures are key for treatment and minimization of secondary spread. In the context of the armed forces, aggressive containment measures are essential to prevent an outbreak. In this study, we present the first reported case, to our knowledge, of SARS in a naval diver. The special physical requirements for divers and the potential complications associated with deep sea diving necessitate extensive investigation before certification of fitness for diving after SARS. In the early recovery period, potential problems during diving are caused by inadequate lung ventilation in relation to exercise level and increased breathing resistance attributable to weak respiratory muscles, with corresponding risk of hypoxia and hypercapnia, as well as decreased ability to respond to nonrespiratory problems during diving. Problems in the late recovery period include increased risk of diving complications (such as pulmonary barotrauma) resulting from fibrosis and scarring within the lung parenchyma, which are known complications of SARS. From our experience, we suggest that computed tomographic scans of the thorax, lung function tests, and careful follow-up monitoring should play a vital role in the assessment of patients during the convalescent period, before certification of fitness to dive.",

Principles of control against SARS focused on three levels of containment, i.e., (1) public health response and medical care, (2) organizational and administrative measures, and (3) social and personal adaptations. Therefore, our goals were twofold: (1) to detect SARS cases early and to break any chain of transmission and (2) to prevent the onset of infection. Public health measures included contact tracing and close monitoring of personnel who might have been exposed to the index case. Contact tracing was performed up to 1 week before admission for all individuals in proximity to the patient. Personnel who were in contact with the patient were required to monitor their temperature 3 times per day and were quarantined at home. Organizational measures included re-stricted access and contact between divers and other camp personnel, to prevent the potential spread of infection. The temperatures of all personnel entering the diving unit were checked before entry. Contact of the diving unit with other personnel in the camp was restricted. Diving unit accommodations were made out of bounds to other personnel except medical staff members. In addition, different meal times for divers and other personnel were enforced. Other measures to prevent the spread of disease included not allowing utensils in the cookhouse to be reused on the same day and having divers leave the camp at different times from other personnel. In the week following diagnosis of SARS in this patient, only essential personnel in the diving unit were required to report to work to prevent the possible spread of SARS. Personal measures included isolation of the index case after diagnosis and quarantine for 21 days after discharge from the hospital. ",

Unfortunately, serological testing is positive only after the first week of illness. 7 Interestingly, a recent study demonstrated that polymerase chain reaction testing of tears could confirm infection in the first week of illness. 9 Age and coexisting illness have been reported as being prognostic factors for risk of death and the need for intensive care. 7 Treatment rendered has largely been supportive. Before serological diagnosis, empiric, broad-spectrum, antibiotic therapy aimed at both typical and atypical pneumonias is indicated. Although there is no definite cure for SARS, steroids and ribavirin have been used in some centers, with varying results. 7 The patient's pulmonary condition is monitored with serial chest X-rays, with ventilatory support as needed. However, prevention is paramount. Measures such as hand-washing, universal precautions, and public education are key to preventing the spread of SARS.",
