Within a short span of about 3 months, more than one-third of the world population is under lockdown and the infection has been declared a pandemic. Every day, the number of cases and the number of deaths related to COVID-19 are increasing. The COVID-19 infection has been mainly reported to be associated with respiratory symptoms, with the deaths being attributed to acute respiratory distress syndrome (Huang et al., 2020). From this point of view, COVID-19 appears to be a pure medical emergency. Keeping this in mind, across the globe, including India, many hospitals have been converted into COVID-19 hospitals or have opened COVID-19 wards. In most of the wards and the hospitals, the people involved are from Internal Medicine, Pulmonary Medicine, Intensive Care Specialists, experts from community medicine, etc. Mental Health Professionals (MHPs) are either not involved or are given roles in taking care of some of the administrative duties, with possibly little role in the clinical management of people with COVID-19 infection. MHPs have also possibly accepted this marginalized role in the management of this global crisis, considering we are dealing with a medical emergency.",

Suddenly, the pandemic has called for the pooling of manpower from different departments to work together. This in itself is leading to a crisis. The majority of the people involved in the establishment and management of COVID-19 wards and hospitals are those, who are at the senior levels. These senior officials are typically used to giving orders, rather than taking orders. Further, for the first line HCWs, starting from doctors, nurses, laboratory staff, hospital attendants, people involved in security, etc, it is a different kind of crisis. They are worried about their safety and the personal protective equipment (PPEs), duties in the COVID-19 wards, need to be quarantined after the duty, worried about themselves getting infected and spreading the infection to their family members, etc. Further, they are haunted by some of the ethical dilemmas they are going to face, such as, what to do- if they have symptoms (to report or not to report- if they report, they would be considered as someone, who is trying to avoid the duty; on the other hand, if they don't, then what if they end up spreading the infection to others), what are they going to do when they have to prioritize death saving devices, such as ventilators, if the number of patients exceeds the resources (Kang et al., 2020; Rajkumar, 2020).Further, the treatment protocols are changing daily and many a time, there is no clear consensus on which medications or strategy to follow. The protocols for managing the COVID-19 positive cases are modified as per the settings and availability of medications/technologies/machinery. The guidelines made in one country do not suit the others and therefore, till now no universal management guidelines have been developed (WHO, 2020, CDC, 2020, MOHFW, 2020). This creates further doubts about the decision-making process of health care workers. Another important issue is whether or not to resuscitate with differing protocols across countries and settings. Therefore, many a time, the HCWs may face the dilemma of doing the best for the patients or risking a significant increase in exposure to aerosols. The HCWs may end up visualizing death helplessly, in contrast to their usual practice of making their best efforts (Edelson et al., 2020). Moreover, the COVID-19 wards have patients of all age groups ranging from new-born babies to elderly patients with multiple co-morbidities. All these issues create 'panic' and a 'worrisome' picture in the minds of the front line HCWs dealing with the patients and it further adds to their anxiety.",

Moreover, the training needs are to be modified as per the educational status of the HCWs (for example training of PPE for doctors and nurses may not apply to hospital attendants and sanitary workers; the details need to be told in a more simplified manner as per the needs and exposure to patients with COVID-19).",

Those who are quarantined, especially, at the facilities outside their home are facing an unprecedented situation of social isolation, social disconnectedness, loneliness, anxiety, depression, phobia, fear of getting the infection, etc(Brooks et al., 2020). Further, if they are being tested, they have to face, the uncertainty of the test results. Those who have been diagnosed with COVID-19 infection are getting hospitalized, and rightly so. However, they are facing, similar mental health issues of social isolation, social disconnectedness, loneliness, anxiety, depression, phobia, fear of getting the infection, etc (Brooks et al., 2020). Additionally, they are feeling stigmatized, in the hands of the HCWs, with a reduction in empathy due to the use of PPEs, while being taken care of. Further, they are facing uncertainties towards the late stage of their admission, with respect to test reports being positive or negative. These people are also going through the psychological issues of anger (who infected me), guilt (spreading the infection to their family members and others), self-stigma, and anticipatory stigma (how are people going to react to them, after they get well). It is also often seen that it is not one person, but often the whole family or multiple members of a family are found positive. Due to this, people, while being in the hospital are also worried about the health of their near and dear ones, are seeing their relatives being put to the life support devices, and are facing the death of their near and dear ones. They are also acting as caregivers for their relatives if they are in hospitals. The family members, who, fortunately, have not been infected, are facing a situation, which is beyond, imagination in a country like India, i.e., your relatives are admitted in the hospital, and you are locked down at home, and cannot do anything beyond providing logistics.",

Further, these people may be more vulnerable to the COVID-19 infection, because of difficulty in remaining confined to one place or inability to follow the measures required to avoid infection.

Mental health care often takes a back seat where physical health is at risk, but it is actually the cause of substantial distress and disability when faced with a serious physical illness, which threatens life. In the current scenario, everyone is going through mental distress, which requires attention. In fact, it is said that the COVID-19 pandemic is actually accompanied by a mental health pandemic, which is going to last beyond the COVID-19 pandemic(Asmundson and Taylor, 2020). In this scenario, the MHPs have to not only address the mental health needs of their patients but need to focus on the general population at large. Community psychiatrists have a big role in addressing the general population at large, to imparting correct knowledge/information, teaching self-care skills, and the required behavioural changes. However, certain vulnerable groups such as HCWs, people in quarantine, patients diagnosed with COVID-19, and caregivers/family members of people in quarantine or those diagnosed with COVID-19, require specific interventions to address their psychological distress and despair. As most of these vulnerable groups, will be part of the hospital taking care of COVID-19 cases or will be in contact with these hospitals, the Consultation-Liaison (CL) Psychiatrists have a big role to play. The CL psychiatrists have to justify their role as medical experts, a good communicator, collaborator, a manager and a supervisor, a leader, a health advocate, a scholar, a researcher, and a true mental health professional(Grover, 2011).",

It is natural for the HCWs to harbor the fear of infection and its consequences. HCWs world-over are struggling with the fear of, and being infected with COVID-19. Another issue, which is of concern, is violence against HCWs who are involved in providing the services at this crucial time. This is making the HCWs very apprehensive and vulnerable to the negative psychological consequences. Despite education modules, protecting oneself from being infected is always a priority and rightly so. It is necessary to address the concerns of the HCWs at various levels. An MHP can help in easing the worries. The availability of an MHP as part of the COVID-19 unit can help in allaying some of the concerns of the HCWs. In addition, continued support for professional help through tele-facilities can aid in addressing the daily struggles, frustrations, and anxiety that are expected to occur.

The term \"social distancing', is actually a misnomer, and should be understood as physical distancing, without any \"emotional distancing\". The word quarantine and social distancing are being considered as some kind of torture, rather than preventive measures. Governments of all the countries are taking measures to provide all kinds of facilities to people in quarantine so that they can be in comfort. Despite all this, people are feeling unsafe about going to quarantine. Due to this, they are hiding their travel history and symptoms.

An MHP attached to the COVID unit, may even observe the situation in the wards and ICUs, even if it is by tele-facilities, and identify patients who require targeted intervention.

This can lead to a lot of uncertainty and distress among caregivers. Some of them have to undergo self-quarantine, anticipatory grief, and other negative psychological consequences (Table 4\n).
