This policy was added to standard infection control practices as implemented and monitored by Duke Hospital Epidemiology and Infection Control (Figure 1). The universal mask policy required all individuals with direct patient contact\u2014medical and support staff, visitors, caregivers, and patients\u2014to wear surgical masks (3M Standard Earloop Mask 1826) when within 3 feet of an HSCT patient. Similar masks have been shown to reduce aerosol shedding of both coarse (>5 \u00b5m) and fine (\u22645 \u00b5m) virus particles [21]. Patients were required to wear masks when traveling outside of their room. Universal surgical mask usage was instituted in both the HSCT inpatient (16 beds) and outpatient day hospital (40 beds) units and associated waiting rooms. Compliance was reinforced by nurses, who were trained during the designated \u201cwashout\u201d period, and monitored periodically by independent observers using the same protocol as for monitoring hand hygiene compliance [22]. Because the focus was on reducing nosocomial transmission, patients or caregivers were not required to wear masks when alone at home or alone in their private rooms.\n",

This conservative washout period would be expected to be significantly greater than the up to 7-day incubation period for the respiratory viral pathogens of interest [23]. All patients who received a transplant between 1 December 2003 (the earliest date data were available in the electronic record) and 30 November 2009 were considered the premask cohort. Patients were observed from the start of conditioning (pretransplant preparative chemotherapy and/or radiation) to the completion of peritransplant care and discharge. Conditioning, prophylaxis for graft-vs-host disease (GVHD), discharge criteria, and other clinical protocols were unchanged over the course of the study. There was not a significant change in the number of beds in either the hematology/oncology unit or the bone marrow transplant unit through the course of the study.",

Quasi-Akaike Information Criterion analysis was used to determine the best correlation structure [24, 25]. A segmented regression model was used because this type of model may be able to explain apparent differences due to external effects that cannot be quantified using traditional multiple regression [26]. In this model, time was segmented into days from the start of the study, and days postintervention. Patients in the premask cohort were given a value of 0 for postintervention time. Patient demographic and clinical variables were examined as covariates in the multivariate model. Myeloablative conditioning, use of alemtuzumab, umbilical cord transplant, haploidentical transplant, and GVHD were only relevant for allogeneic HSCT (allo-HSCT), so a third level was added to these variables to indicate that an autologous HSCT (auto-HSCT) was performed. This level was excluded in the fitting of most models due to collinearity with the type of transplant variable, but by coding the variables like this, no patients were excluded in any model.",

However, after the universal surgical mask policy was instituted, the number of PIV3 infections dropped significantly among HSCT patients, whereas it remained high in the rest of the hospital.

Standard preventive methods include strict hand hygiene, vaccination, active and early surveillance, and contact and droplet isolation of symptomatic patients [27, 28]. However, strategies that focus on symptoms do not address the prolonged asymptomatic shedding of RVIs in immunocompromised patients, including PIV3 [10, 12, 14\u201316], which can range from 5 to 121 days [10, 12, 14, 20]. It is therefore not surprising that symptom-based surveillance and isolation policies have been reported with mixed results [11, 12, 16]. In one prolonged outbreak of PIV3 at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, droplet isolation of aggressively screened symptomatic patients did not impact the duration or severity of the outbreak [16], as was the case at our institution in 2005. In contrast, more success was seen when universal surgical mask usage was instituted in response to a PIV3 outbreak at the Johns Hopkins Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center [12].",

In addition to directly stopping transmission of viral particles, universal usage may drive a cultural change in providers and patients, heightening awareness of and attention to the importance of infection control. This intervention may be readily applied to other HSCT programs, and in fact, some institutions already require everyone to wear surgical masks during the peak winter influenza season [12]. However, as PIV3 is most common in the spring and summer months, and nosocomial outbreaks of PIV3 can be prolonged and extend beyond the typical season [11, 17], focus on the winter neglects a significant proportion of RVIs.",

Consistent with the reported literature [2], we also found that GVHD was associated with more RVIs (GVHD patients receive additional immunosuppression including corticosteroids), and myeloablative conditioning was associated with fewer RVIs (these patients are generally healthier, ie, able to tolerate myeloablative conditioning). Interestingly, our model did not find a significant difference between allo-HSCT and auto-HSCT; however, our model controls for inpatient/outpatient stay, taking into account the length of the interval. Because incidence of RVI after allo-HSCT is 3 times that of auto-HSCT, and the length of stay for allo-HSCT is 3 times that of auto-HSCT, controlling for length of stay minimizes the impact of type of transplant.",

There were significant differences between cohorts, such as the increased prevalence of plasma cell dyscrasia, and consequently auto-HSCT, in the mask cohort. However, universal surgical mask usage had a significant protective effect within both the auto-HSCT and allo-HSCT subgroups. Whereas seasonal and yearly variations in RVIs may also bias results, we found no parallel decrease in the rest of the hospital. Thus, it seems unlikely that natural variation in the rate of RVIs in the community accounts for the observed decrease. This is supported by our time-series analysis, which found a 60% decrease in the risk of RVIs in the mask period after accounting for the covariates of season and year, in addition to disease, type of transplant, and other variables. Additionally, differences in detection methods in the premask period (predominantly viral culture and DFA) vs the postmask period (PCR) could impact the results. However, as PCR is known to be at least 30% more sensitive at detecting viral pathogens compared with DFA and culture, depending on the pathogen, without sacrificing specificity [29, 30], we would expect a bias toward the null. The true effect size of the mask intervention thus may be underrepresented in the current study.",

To mitigate this possibility, we collected data over an extended period of 4 full years following implementation of universal mask usage, rather than examining simply 1 season or 1 year. We considered the possibility of testing bias resulting in reduced vigilance in screening for RVIs during the mask period. However, the lower proportion of positive test results in the mask period suggests that testing is more frequent in the mask period\u2014that is, undertesting would not explain the decrease in RVIs. We also considered the possibility that, over the course of the study period, improved hospital-wide infection control efforts over the 10-year span of the study were responsible for the reduction in RVI rates in HSCT patients. However, a concurrent reduction in RVIs was not observed in either an adjacent non-HSCT hematologic malignancy unit or hospital-wide. Moreover, increasing use of more sensitive and specific PCR-based viral diagnostic testing would be expected to increase the detection of RVI during the universal mask period, as was seen in the adjacent hematologic malignancy unit. In contrast, we observed a decrease in RVIs despite this increased sensitivity, raising the possibility that we are underestimating the protective effect of universal mask usage.",
