First, a sufficiently useful disease spreading simulation system requires complex models, including social contact networks, local and global mobility patterns of individuals, and epidemiological parameters for the infectious disease (eg, the infectious period). Epidemic simulations track tens or hundreds of interdependent parameters, spanning multiple layers and geospatial frames, affected by complex dynamic processes operating at different resolutions. Moreover, an ensemble of stochastic epidemic realizations may include hundreds or thousands of simulations, each with different parameters settings corresponding to slightly different but plausible scenarios [24, 25]. As a consequence, running and interpreting simulation results (along with the real-world observations) to generate timely actionable results pose challenges.",

This necessitates continuous analyses and interpretations of the incoming data and adaptation of the networks and models. Therefore, simulation ensembles may need to be continuously revised and refined as the situation on the ground changes. Revisions involve incorporating the real-world observations, as well as updated probability surfaces, into existing simulations to alter their outcomes, whereas refinements involve identifying new simulations to run based on the changing situation on the ground to provide trustable recommendations. As the situation on the ground and intervention mechanisms evolve, the sampling strategies for the input parameter spaces have to be varied (by eliminating irrelevant scenarios and considering new scenarios or varying the likelihood of old scenarios) in such a way that more-accurate simulation results are obtained where it is more relevant.",

Because of the volume and complexity of the data, the varying spatial and temporal scales at which the key transmission processes operate and relevant observations are made, public health experts could benefit from novel decision support systems. Therefore, tools that help execute large-scale simulation ensembles under a large number of diverse hypotheses/scenarios and those that facilitate analysis, exploration, interpretation, and visualization of large simulation ensembles (aligned with the real-world observations) to generate timely actionable results are critically needed for understanding the evolution patterns of the outbreaks (including estimating transmissibility, forecasting the spatiotemporal spread at different spatial scales, and assessing the cost and impact of interventions, including travel controls, at various stages of the epidemic) and supporting real-time decision-making and hypothesis testing through large-scale simulations.",
