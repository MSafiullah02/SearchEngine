Four common human coronaviruses (HKU1, NL63, OC43 and E229) cause 10-20% of respiratory infections worldwide and are present in all continents [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] ( Table 1 ) . Mortality is poorly assessed, but it is clear that there are chronic carriers as well as asymptomatic carriers. Studies have shown that there are as many asymptomatic carriers as symptomatic patients [3 , 9] . Three epidemic episodes of emerging coronaviruses have been reported. The first, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus, had very little impact on global morbidity and mortality, with more than 80 0 0 recognized cases and 774 deaths [15 , 16] . The second, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-coronavirus, remained localized in Saudi Arabia, with a small epidemic of mainly nosocomial infections in South Korea [17] . MERS-coronavirus, like SARS-coronavirus, highlighted the major danger of nosocomial transmission to healthcare personnel, the health of whom is essential in these epidemics [18] . Finally, SARS-CoV-2, the novel coronavirus that appeared in December 2019, has expanded and has now affected more than 90 0 0 0 people worldwide [2 , 19 , 20] . At the time of writing, a significant number of cases had occurred in the Far East. It is incontestably contagious, as a quasi-experimental study on the Diamond Princess cruise ship showed that confinement of infected patients with uninfected patients resulted in rapid infection of the uninfected patients, leading to 700 additional cases on board [21] . However, coronaviruses in common circulation remain predominant because of their global distribution and their non-negligible mortality [14 , 22] . The aim of this study was to share the experience of a reference laboratory representing approximately 1% of serious and diagnosed respiratory infections, particularly seasonal, in France. This will allow the evaluation of the relative mortality of different human coronaviruses presented in hospitals in Marseille compared with that of SARS-CoV-2.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 76, "end": 83, "text": "[1 , 2]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 262, "end": 265, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 266, "end": 269, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 270, "end": 273, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 274, "end": 277, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 278, "end": 281, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 282, "end": 285, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 286, "end": 289, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 290, "end": 294, "text": "[10]", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 295, "end": 299, "text": "[11]", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 300, "end": 304, "text": "[12]", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 305, "end": 309, "text": "[13]", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 310, "end": 314, "text": "[14]", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 529, "end": 536, "text": "[3 , 9]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 786, "end": 795, "text": "[15 , 16]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 968, "end": 972, "text": "[17]", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 1148, "end": 1152, "text": "[18]", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 1300, "end": 1313, "text": "[2 , 19 , 20]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1665, "end": 1669, "text": "[21]", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 1808, "end": 1817, "text": "[14 , 22]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 315, "end": 326, "text": "( Table 1 )", "ref_id": "TABREF1"}], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "Assistance Publique-H\u00f4pitaux de Marseille (AP-HM) covers all public hospitals in Marseille, including four university hospitals: La Timone Hospital, Conception Hospital, North Hospital and South Hospital; this corresponds to 3400 beds and 125 000 admissions each year [23] .
