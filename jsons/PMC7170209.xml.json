The minimal symptoms that define the diagnosis are nasal discharge, nasal obstruction, and throat irritation. At the onset of symptoms, there is a feeling of chilliness on exposure to cold, dryness and irritation in the nose, and a scratchy throat. This progresses rapidly to nasal stuffiness or obstruction, sneezing, watery nasal discharge, throat irritation, watering eyes or eye irritation, coughing, occasional muscular aches, general malaise, anorexia, and, sometimes, low-grade fever.2 After 1 to 3 days, the nasal secretions may become thicker and purulent. Persistent nasal discharge may lead to excoriation around the nose. If nasal obstruction occurs, it leads to mouth-breathing, aggravating the irritation of the throat. The usual duration of the illness is about 7 days, but lingering nasal discharge may persist for 2 weeks or longer.",

            "text": "The published literature on modalities used for symptomatic relief of cold symptoms has been summarized using systematic reviews as follows:\nAntibiotics: In a meta-analysis of six trials that included 1147 patients (children and adults), people receiving antibiotics did no better than did those receiving placebo in terms of cure or persistence of symptoms.27\n\nVitamin C: In studies of adults, beneficial effects of vitamin C have been shown when it is used prophylactically for 2 to 3 months but not when started at the onset of symptoms. However, fewer trials have examined this later use.In studies of adults, 200 mg or more per day of vitamin C does not reduce the incidence of colds, except in those exposed to brief periods of extreme physical exercise and/or cold environments.28\nVitamin C given prophylactically results in a small but significant reduction in the duration and severity of cold symptoms. In studies of children, there is an approximately 14% reduction in duration of symptoms. The severity of symptoms, as measured by \u201cdays confined to home\u201d or \u201cdays off work or school,\u201d is significantly reduced in studies that include both children and adults.28\n\nZinc lozenges: There are no studies specifically of children, although some older children have been included in predominantly adult studies. There is no evidence that zinc lozenges are effective.\nEchinacea: Most studies have examined the use of echinacea for treating rather than preventing colds. The results of placebo-controlled trials have been inconsistent, with some showing effect and others not. This variability is likely to be due at least in part to the large variability in composition of products that are sold as \u201cEchinacea.\u201d29\n\nNasal decongestants (either oral or intranasal): The efficacy of these in children remains unproved.5 In adults, a single dose of a nasal decongestant is moderately effective for the short-term relief of congestion.5 The potential side effects are a concern, especially in young children. In children, they have a measurable sedating effect.30 Excessive use of sprays and drops with vasoconstrictive medications can lead to rebound obstruction, which prolongs the illness symptoms.\nOver-the-counter medicines for acute cough\n31: There is no good evidence that over-the-counter medicines provide any benefit greater than that seen with a placebo. These medications confer no protection against the development of otitis media.32\n\nAntitussives: Neither dextromethorphan nor codeine is better than a placebo at reducing cough during the day or night.33\n\nExpectorants (Guaifenesin): This has not been adequately studied in children.\nMucolytics (letosteine): One study involving 40 children showed a statistically but not clinically significant difference in symptom score in comparison with placebo (a difference of 0.2 point on a 4-point scale).34\n\nAntihistamines as monotherapy: In children and adults, antihistamines do not significantly reduce cold symptoms (nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, sneezing) or alter subjective improvement.35, 36 First-generation antihistamines cause more sedation than does placebo.35\n\nAntihistamine decongestant combinations: These are not effective in small children.35 In older children and adults, a small amount of improvement in general and in nasal symptoms specifically may occur.30, 35, 37\n\n",

The palms and soles are spared as is the face, where there is characteristic circumoral pallor and flushed cheeks. The rash is diffuse, bright red, papular, and rough to the touch. The sandpaper texture is caused by occlusion of sweat glands. The rash fades over a week and is followed by desquamation for several weeks.

If the child has had no symptomatic response within 3 days, a change of an antibiotic is indicated. Alternatives are amoxicillin-clavulanate potassium, 40 mg/kg/day in three doses; cefixime, 8 mg/kg/day in one or two doses121; and erythromycin-sulfisoxazole, 50 mg/kg/day in four doses. Cefaclor (40 mg/kg/day in two or three doses) is less efficacious. If the child is vomiting, a single intramuscular dose of ceftriaxone, 50 mg/kg/day, is as effective as 10 days of oral amoxicillin.122 All these antibiotic regimens seem to have comparable efficacy in resolving the clinical features of acute otitis media.

A brisk response to treatment is expected in 3 to 4 days, in which case a 10-day course of treatment is satisfactory.160, 161 The benefits are modest: eight children must be treated to achieve one additional cure.160 In communities with \u03b2-lactamase\u2013producing H. influenzae and M. catarrhalis, the following antibiotics should be considered: amoxicillin\u2013clavulanate potassium (40 mg/kg/day in three doses), trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (8 mg of trimethoprim and 40 mg of sulfamethoxazole per kilogram per day in two or three doses), and cefaclor (40 mg/kg/day in three doses).",

The lack of significance of the effect at 24 hours may be due to low study power. The effect size seen at 24 hours is similar to that at 12 hours but has been examined in fewer studies. The number needed to treat at 6, 12, and 24 hours was five, with this considered sufficient to support the use of glucocorticoids over placebo.177\n*\n\nAs measured by return visits, length of stay, and use of additional therapy: In comparison with placebo, the rates of return visits and hospital admission are both significantly reduced (number needed to treat to prevent one return visit=17). Length of stay in the emergency department or inpatient ward are both reduced, with the mean difference being approximately 12 hours. Children treated with glucocorticoids are approximately 10% less likely to be also treated with epinephrine.177\n\nDifferent doses and routes of administration of glucocorticoids: Using symptom scores and return visits/readmissions as outcome measures, the efficacy of glucocorticoids versus placebo given by different routes of administration (oral, spray, intramuscular, subcutaneous) does not differ. Combinations of budesonide and dexamethasone versus either alone do not result in any increased effect.179 Different doses of dexamethasone (0.15, 0.3, or 0.6 mg/kg) have similar efficacy.177, 180 The onset of action of nebulized budesonide is faster than that of oral or intramuscular glucocorticoids but slower than that of nebulized epinephrine.172\n\nEfficacy of glucocorticoids for croup of varying severity: A single dose of glucocorticoid has been shown to be effective in croup of all grades of severity including mild croup defined as a score of 2 or less (of 17) on the Westley scoring system.181\n\nComparison with epinephrine: There is no significant difference in improvement in croup scores in studies that have compared glucocorticoids (dexamethasone or budesonide) with epinephrine.\nAdverse effects of glucocorticoids: There is no evidence of any ill effects of a single dose of glucocorticoids given to a child with viral croup. The efficacy and safety of repeated doses of glucocorticoids in children with severe croup have not been established. However, there may be complications with steroids used inadvertently for diagnoses mimicking viral croup, such as epiglottitis or bacterial tracheitis, so the clinician must be certain of the diagnosis before administering them.167 Both bacterial tracheitis and Candida laryngotracheitis have been reported to occur in children with croup being treated with glucocorticoids.182, 183\n\n",

This results in increased airway diameter within 30 minutes. However, the effect is short lived, lasting about 2 hours because of dispersion of the epinephrine.184 The first use of this treatment was with racemic epinephrine hydrochloride (Vaponefrin, equivalent to 2.25% epinephrine base), a mixture of equal parts of the inactive d-isomer and the active l-isomer. In some early studies,185 this treatment was given with intermittent positive-pressure breathing, but a similar effect is seen without it.186 Racemic epinephrine is not readily available in some countries, and it has been replaced by the use of l-epinephrine solution, which is cheaper.184\n",

Although this agent is moderately well tolerated, the almost universal side effects of mild influenza-like symptoms are unpleasant, and the frequent parenteral mode of delivery is disliked, particularly in the younger age group. Interferon therapy may be used in particularly aggressive disease, but it should not be continued beyond 12 months unless the disease responds.225 In less severe cases, the indication is not absolute.",
