Contagion tends to succeed within environments or communities that \u201cfacilitate\u201d modes of infection among its members. Contagion is an \u201cunderstood\u201d or \u201cbelieved\u201d mode of disease transmission or of \u201csocially transmitted\u201d behaviors, popularized by Malcolm Gladwell, a journalist who made use of his general understanding of the concept of \u201ccontagion.\u201d In his construction of reasonable or plausible explanations for the observed and documented dramatic reductions in car thefts and violent crimes in New York City in the 1990s, [71] Gladwell expanded the use of the concept of contagion and tipping point in his development of a framework that captures\u2014as the result of contagion\u2014the spread of a multitude of social ills or virtues [72]. Specifically, contagion is seen in [71] as a force capable of starting and sustaining growth in criminal activity as long as a \u201ccritical mass\u201d of individuals capable and willing to commit crimes is available. The growth in criminal activity in New York City is, according to Gladwell, the result of the \u201cinteractions\u201d between a large enough pool of criminally active (infected) individuals and individuals susceptible to criminal contagion [71]. Gladwell extends the perspective pioneered by Sir Ronald Ross [141] and his \u201cstudents\u201d [90\u201392] to the field of social dynamics.",

For example, first-order estimates of the fraction that must be vaccinated to eliminate a communicable disease can be handled with homogeneous mixing models while the elaboration of optimal vaccination strategies in real-life situations often require an age-structured model [28, 81]. The study of nosocomial (in-hospital) infections provides an additional example of the role of heterogeneity in transmission or degree of susceptibility or resistance [38, 39, 106]. The SARS epidemic provided a timely example of the criticality of heterogeneous mixing, in nosocomial transmission [85, 152] . Since there was no treatment available during the SARS epidemic, the main management approach rested on the effectiveness of isolation of diagnosed infectives, quarantine of suspected infectives, and early diagnosis. Quarantine was decided by tracing of contacts made by infectives but in fact few quarantined individuals developed SARS symptoms. The role of early diagnosis and the effectiveness of isolation seemed to have been the key to SARS control with improvements in contact tracing also playing an important role in epidemic control.",

There are many instances in which more than one strain of a disease is circulating within a population and the possibility of cross-immunity between strains becomes important [3, 4]. Mathematically, co-strain co-circulation may lead to models that support a disease-free equilibrium (or non-uniform age distribution), equilibria in which only one strain persists, and an equilibrium in which two strains coexist. The role of cross-immunity in destabilizing disease dynamics (periodic solutions) has been studied extensively in the case of influenza models without age structure [57, 123, 124, 151] and also in age-structured models [29, 30]. Coinfections of more than one disease are also possible and their analysis requires more elaborate models. This is a real possibility with HIV and tuberculosis [96, 119, 133, 135, 140, 144, 154].",

However, many infectious pathogens can evolve and generate successor strains that confer drug resistance [55]. The evolution of resistance is generally associated with impaired transmission fitness compared to the sensitive strains of the infectious pathogen [112]. In the absence of treatment, resistant strains may be competitively disadvantaged compared to the sensitive strains and may go extinct. However, treatment prevents the growth and spread of sensitive strains, and therefore induces a selective pressure that favors the resistant strain to replicate and restores its fitness to a level suitable for successful transmission [2]. This phenomenon has been observed in several infectious diseases, in particular for management of influenza infection using antiviral drugs [138]. \n",

Through computer simulations, these studies have shown that, when resistance is highly transmissible, there may be situations in which increasing the treatment rate may do more harm than good by causing a larger number of resistant cases than the decrease in cases produced by treatment of sensitive infections. A recent epidemic model [156] has exhibited such behavior and suggested that there may be an optimal treatment rate for minimizing the final size [107, 111, 114].",

It is necessary to include demographic effects such as births and natural deaths in a model. This means that there may be an endemic equilibrium, and that the disease is always present in the population. Instead of studying the final size of an epidemic to measure the severity of a disease outbreak, it is more appropriate to consider the degree of prevalence of the disease in the population at endemic equilibrium as a measure of severity. For diseases such as tuberculosis, in which there are additional aspects such as reinfection, there may be additional difficulties caused by the possibility of backward bifurcations. The importance of understanding the dynamics of tuberculosis treatment suggests that this is a topic that should be pursued [60].",

The \u201cphysics or chemistry traditions\u201d are used to model disease transmission as the result of the \u201ccollisions\u201d between individuals (with different energy or activity levels) in different epidemiological states. Further, movement, typically modeled using a metapopulation approach, is seen as the relocation between patches of non-identifiable individuals. The scholarly and extensive review in [83] addresses this perspective within homogeneous and heterogeneous mixing (age-structured) population models (see also [30]). Weakening the assumption of homogeneous mixing via contacts in epidemiology has been addressed using network-based analyses that identify host contact patterns and clusters [13, 120, 121, 128] (and references therein with [121] offering an extensive review). Focusing on how each individual is connected within the population has been used to address the effects of host behavioral response on disease prevalence (see [67, 68, 110] for a review). Other approaches have included the effects of behavioral changes triggered by \u201cfear\u201d and/or awareness of disease [56, 66, 131, 134]. Although this stress-induced behavior may benefit public health efforts in some cases, it can also cause somewhat unpredictable outcomes [75].",

            "text": "However, the fact remains that our ability to determine (and hence define) what an effective contact is in the context of communicable diseases, that is, our ability to measure the average number of contacts that a typical patch resident has per unit of time and where, has been hampered by high levels of uncertainty. Therefore, when we ask, what is the average rate of contacts that an individual has while riding a packed subway in Japan or Mexico City, or what is the average rate of contacts that an individual has at a religious event involving hundreds of thousands of people, including pilgrimages, one quickly arrives at the conclusion that different observers are extremely likely to arrive at very distinct understandings and quantifications of the frequency, intensity, and levels of heterogeneity involved. In short, this perspective puts emphasis on the use of a different currency (residence times) because measuring contacts at the places where the risk of infection is the highest, pilgrimages, massive religious ceremonies, \u201cWoodstock time events\u201d, packed subways, and other forms of mass gathering or transportation have not been done to the satisfaction of most researchers. The risk of acquiring an infectious disease within a flight can be measured at least in principle as a function of the time that each individual of x-type spends flying, the number of passengers, and the likelihood that an infectious individual is on board. For example, measuring the risk of acquiring tuberculosis, an airborne disease that may spread by air circulation in a flight, may be more a function of the duration of the flight and the seating arrangement than the average rate of contacts per passenger within the flight (see [31] and references therein). Furthermore, replication studies that measure risk of infection in a given environment may indeed be possible under a residence time model. In short, the risks of acquiring an infection can be quantified as a function of the time spent (residence time) within each particular environment. The Lagrangian modeling approach builds (epidemiological) models by tracking individuals\u2019 patch-residence times and estimating their contacts according to the time spent in each environment [32]. The value of these models increases when we have the ability to assess risk as a patch-specific characteristic. In short, the use of a Lagrangian modeling perspective rather than the use of contacts is tied to the difficulties that must be faced when the goal is to measure the average rate of contacts per type-x individual in the environments that facilitate transmission the most.",

Each of these patches (or environments) is defined by its associated risk of residence-time infection. Patch risk measurements account for environmental, health, and socioeconomic conditions. The Lagrangian approach [73, 125, 126] keeps track of the identity of hosts regardless of their geographical/spatial position. The use of Lagrangian modeling in living systems was, to the best of our knowledge, pioneered and popularized by Okubo and Levin [125, 126] in the context of animal aggregation. Recently, Lagrangian approaches have also been used to model human crowd movement and behavior [15, 49, 78, 79] and in the context of bioterrorism [31].",

Here, it is assumed that vector mobility is negligible and the assumptions proceed to incorporate the life history and epidemiology of mosquitoes [10, 84, 98, 108, 109, 141], which can be effectively captured by decoupling host and vector mobility [98, 145].

Specifically, in [48, 142], the effects of movement on patch population size at time t are ignored, namely, the population size in each Patch j is fixed at N\nj. In [139], it is assumed that human mobility across patches does not produce any \u201cnet\u201d change on the patch population size. On the other hand, in Model 16.3 the relationship between each patch population and mobility is dynamic and explicitly formulated. Moreover, the limited (vector mobility is ignored) Lagrangian approach used here to model the dynamics of vector-borne diseases captures some unique features because the \u201cspatial\u201d structure of mosquitoes is not the same as that of humans. Mosquitoes are stratified into m patches (that may represent, for example, oviposition or breeding sites or forests) with infection taking place still within each Patch j, characterized by its particular risk \u03b2\nvha\nj for j = 1, \u2026, m. Here, \u03b2\nvh represents the infectiousness of human to mosquitoes bite with a\nj denoting the per capita biting rate in Patch j. Hosts, on the other hand, are structured by social groups or age classes (n). This residence habitat division can be particularly useful in the study of the impact of target control strategies.",

In short, we have a complex adaptive system where individuals within the model, in this example, impact disease outcomes (through changes in the incidence). Eqs. (16.4) and (16.5) are both optimized from an individual perspective. Within this individual context, EEMs have shown that individual distancing, conditional on health status, plays an important role in the spread of infectious disease. However, it has also been shown that the provision of incentives for infectious individuals to self- quarantine is likely to be welfare-enhancing [43, 44, 61, 115]. Thus, understanding how the individual responds to relative costs of disease and disease prevention is critical to the design of public policy that affects those costs. Indeed, the role of recovered individuals in protecting susceptible individuals has been generally overlooked in public health interventions, and yet it is known that their behavior is, in fact, critical to disease management due to the positive externality the individuals\u2019 contacts generate once in an immune, non-disease-transmitting state [63]. The benefits of herd immunity include the positive externality associated with acquired immunity but may, in turn, be nullified by nontargeted social-distancing policies that induce such immune individuals to reduce contacts. By incentivizing the maintenance of contacts by recovered individuals policy may lower the probability of susceptible individuals contacting infected individuals and/or allow susceptible and infected individuals to individually increase contacts without changing the probability of infection.",

            "text": "Theoretical epidemiology aims to disentangle the role of epidemiological and socioeconomic forces on disease dynamics. However, the role of behavior and individual decisions in response to a changing epidemic landscape has not been tackled systematically. In this chapter, we highlight alternative ways for modeling disease transmission that can use contacts as its currency or residence times or both. It seems evident that the use of contacts, in the context of influenza, Ebola, tuberculosis, or other communicable diseases (as opposed to sexually transmitted diseases), while intellectually satisfying, fails to recognized the fact that contacts cannot be measured effectively in settings where the risk of acquiring such infections is the highest. In fact, when contact-based models are fitted to data, it has become clear that contact rates play primarily the role of fitting parameters; in other words, if the goal is connecting models to data that include transmission mechanisms, then the use of contacts has serious shortcomings. Therefore, in order to advance the role of theory, we need models that are informed by data. Hence, the need to invest on efforts that bring forth alternative modes of modeling. While Lagrangian approaches are not a panacea, their use extends the possibilities because they depend on parameters like residence times and average time to infection for a given environment (risk), that is, parameters that can be measured. Frameworks should be explored and compared and their analyses contrasted. We have revisited recent work that equates behavior with cost\u2013benefit decisions, which, in turn, are linked, within our framework, to health status and population-level dynamics, the components of a complex adaptive system. Connecting the Lagrangian movement-modeling approach with EEMs seems promising, albeit computationally and mathematically challenging. However, as discussed in [117], the perception that the benefits of disease control are limited by the capacity of the weakest link in the chain to respond effectively is not a basic result of EEM models, which actually show that it may not be in within the ability of an individual in a poor community/country to do more risk mitigation. The need for richer communities or nations to find ways to incentivize greater levels of disease-risk mitigation in poor countries may be the best approach.",

Models of these dynamics have many of the same features as models of epidemic spread, no great surprise, since many aspects of culture have the characteristics of being social diseases. 1998 Heineken award winner Paul Ehrlich and I have been directing our collective energies to this problem, convinced that it is as important to understand the dynamics of the social systems in which we live as it is to understand the ecological systems themselves. Understanding the links between individual behavior and societal consequences, and characterizing the networks of interaction and influence, create the potential to change the reward structures so that the social costs of individual actions are brought down to the level of individual payoffs. It is a daunting task, both because of the amount we still must learn, and because of the ethical dilemmas that are implicit in any form of social engineering. But it is a task from which we cannot shrink, lest we squander the last of our diminishing resources.\n",
