In the past respiratory syncytial virus (RSV; Paramyxoviridae), influenza viruses A and B (Orthomyxoviridae), parainfluenza viruses (PIV) 1\u20133 (Paramyxoviridae), and adenoviruses (Adenoviridae) were viewed to be the leading viral causes of acute lower respiratory tract infections [Law et al., 2002; Crowe and Williams, 2003]. Since 2001, several novel respiratory viruses have been described including human metapneumovirus (hMPV) [van den Hoogen et al., 2001] (Paramyxoviridae), human coronaviruses (hCoV) NL63 [van der Hoek et al., 2004] and HKU1 [Woo et al., 2005] (Coronaviridae), human bocavirus (hBoV) [Allander et al., 2005] (Parvoviridae), and two new polyomaviruses (WU virus (WUV) and KI virus (KIV)) [Allander et al., 2007; Bialasiewicz et al., 2007; Gaynor et al., 2007] (Polyomaviridae). Furthermore, improved sensitivity of diagnostic tests has lead to the increased detection of viruses previously only considered as upper respiratory tract infections in cases of acute lower respiratory tract disease, including hCoV\u2010OC43, hCoV\u2010229E, and rhinovirus (family Picornaviridae) [Pene et al., 2003; Vabret et al., 2003; Jartti et al., 2004; Hayden, 2006; Briese et al., 2008].",

Increased disease burden due to RSV [Madhi et al., 2000, 2001] and hMPV [Madhi et al., 2003] infection have been demonstrated in children infected with HIV. As yet comparisons of a comprehensive range of newly implicated viruses as well as other well defined respiratory viruses by sensitive molecular techniques are lacking in sub\u2010Saharan African countries where >65% of individuals infected with HIV reside [UNAIDS, 2007]. A recent study in Kenya indicated that RSV accounts for the majority of respiratory infections in young children [Berkley et al., 2010]. No data are yet available on the role of rhinovirus or most of the other new viruses in hospitalized patients from the African continent or on the seasonal distribution of the individual viruses in temperate regions in South Africa. The contribution of these viruses to hospitalizations as single and co\u2010infections and disease severity in hospitalized children in populations with a high HIV disease burden is also not yet defined.",

Steve Biko Academic Hospital, Kalafong Secondary Hospital, and 1\u2010Military Hospital. Nasopharyngeal aspirates were collected on the day of admission. Of the total specimen group, 525/737 (71.2%) patients in 2006 and 561/965 (58.1%) patients in 2007 required hospitalization (Table I). Of all specimens received, 93.1% and 97.3% were from children less than 5 year of age. For this reason only specimens from children <5 was included in this study. Throughout each year, 244 (2006) and 240 (2007) specimens that previously tested negative, together with 75 (2006) and 66 (2007) specimens that tested positive by routine antigen detection assays, were randomly selected for retrospective screening with RT\u2010PCR assays representing approximately one\u2010third of the total specimens received during each year. Table I lists the demographics of the study group. Clinical diseases severity was retrospectively recorded from patients' hospital files and broadly categorized as outpatients on the basis of patients presenting to the emergency room but not requiring admission; hospitalized patients that were ill enough to be admitted to the pediatric wards and patients needing ICU treatment. Control specimens were nasopharyngeal aspirates collected, following written informed consent, from 46 healthy children <2 years of age with a similar epidemiological background, attending a vaccine clinic in the same region. Prior to specimen collection, parents at the vaccine clinic were asked to complete a questionnaire regarding the occurrence of any symptoms associated with respiratory disease within the previous month. Only healthy children without recent respiratory disease were included in the healthy control group.",

Influenza A peaked from April to September with the majority of cases in June and July in 2006 but had two peaks in 2007 (April\u2013May and August\u2013September). This may be sampling error due to low numbers detected in hospitalized children in this year. Adenovirus was distributed throughout the year. Rhinovirus occurred throughout the year, with peak activity observed in February\u2013May 2006 and April\u2013August 2007. hMPV occurred year\u2010round with peak activity in April 2006 and May\u2013August 2007. hBoV cases were detected throughout 2006 whereas in 2007 peak activity occurred from July to October. hCoV\u2010OC43 was predominantly detected during winter (June\u2013July) and spring (September\u2013October), whereas 91% of hCoV\u2010NL63 cases were detected from mid\u2010summer (January) to mid\u2010autumn (May).",

The most cases of hospitalization associated with single infections in children in this study was associated with rhinovirus, RSV, and PIV\u20103 (80.7%, 75%, and 68%, of cases respectively), while 56% of hMPV and hBoV single and 43% for influenza A and adenovirus cases were hospitalized. Single infections that resulted in death were the highest for RSV (10%), followed by Rhinovirus (7.3%) while 1 death was identified for PIV\u20103, hPMV, and hBoV each. Further investigations with larger patients groups will clarify the associated hospitalization rates of the newly described viruses in a population with a high HIV burden. Co\u2010infections with these viruses were not associated with an increased death rate in this study (Table III). Rhinovirus was the virus detected most frequently detected virus in healthy individuals (18.8%) which may signify prolonged shedding in healthy patients. However, in concordance with recent findings [Trento et al., 2010], rhinovirus had a significantly higher detection rate in children with respiratory disease requiring medical attention compared to healthy individuals (31.3% vs. 18.8%, P = 0.006). If 18.8% of these cases are due to shedding it would suggest that rhinovirus may still be associated with hospitalization in 12.5% of cases. Rhinovirus was also associated with severe disease with 48.5% of single infections requiring oxygen supplementation (Table IV) but appear to be less severe than RSV\u2010associated acute lower respiratory tract infections (as reported by similar studies) [Linsuwanon et al., 2009] with only 17.3% of rhinovirus infected patients required intensive care treatment compared to 35% for RSV patients. Prolonged shedding periods and asymptomatic infections may account for the high detection rate in healthy children and warrants further investigation especially in patients with HIV co\u2010infections [Kaiser et al., 2006; Peltola et al., 2008].",
