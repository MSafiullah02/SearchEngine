Their primary structure is characterised by an N-terminal, triple-helical collagenous region made up of Gly-X-Y repeats, an a-helical coiled-coil trimerising neck region, and a Cterminal C-type lectin or carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD). Further oligomerisation of this primary structure can give rise to more complex and multimeric structures that can be seen under electron microscope. Collectins can be found in serum as well as in a range of tissues at the mucosal surfaces. Mannanbinding lectin can activate the complement system while other members of the collectin family are extremely versatile in recognising a diverse range of pathogens via their CRDs and bring about effector functions designed at the clearance of invading pathogens. These mechanisms include opsonisation, enhancement of phagocytosis, triggering superoxidative burst and nitric oxide production. Collectins can also potentiate the adaptive immune response via antigen presenting cells such as macrophages and dendritic cells through modulation of cytokines and chemokines, thus they can act as a link between innate and adaptive immunity.

Another structural feature of the collagenlike domain of collectins is that it can be O-glycosylated (Colley and Baenziger 1987) . Both MBL and SP-A show an interruption of the Gly-X-Y triplet repeats, which introduces a bend in the otherwise straight triple helix. This enables the fully assembled multi-subunit structure to angle away from the central core, producing a structure resembling a bouquet of flowers (Fig. 4 .2) (Voss et al. 1991) . Several distinct functions of the collagen domain of collectins have been reported. The collagen domains of SP-A and MBL are involved in receptor-mediated properties. A GEKGEP specific motif found within the collagen domain of MBL is suggested to bind C1q receptor (Arora et al. 2001) , and mediates the enhancement of phagocytosis through C1qR (Arora et al. 2001) . A similar motif is within the collagen domain of SP-A (White et al. 1985) , which is also involved in the interaction with C1q receptor (Malhotra et al. 1992; Malhotra et al. 1990) , and mediates phagocytosis of Staphylococcus aureus by monocytes (Geertsma et al. 1994) .

Such broad specificity is achieved by an open and flexible trough -like binding pocket found within the CRDs. The selection of ligands by this site depends on the positioning of vicinal hydroxyl groups of sugars, which form coordination bonds with a ligated calcium ion, hydrogen bonds and a polar Van der Waals contact (Ng et al. 1996) . Ligand specificity of collectins is divided into two main sub-classes (mannosebinding or galactose-binding type), which is based on a three amino acid residue motif found in the Ca ++ ion binding site. The sequence 185-Glu-Pro-Asn is associated with binding of mannose-like sugars, while the sequence 185-Gln-Pro-Asp is associated with binding galactose-like sugars. The molecular differences based on which CRDs discriminate between mannose and galactose-type ligands depend on the orientation of C3 and C4 vicinal hydroxyl groups presented on monosaccharides. Mannose-specific CRDs bind ligands in which hydroxyl groups at the C3 and C4 positions are in an equatorial orientation (mannose, glucose, glucosamine), while in galactose these vicinal hydroxyls are in an axial orientation (Drickamer and Taylor 2015) .

Computational docking studies have demonstrated that \u03b1D-glucose docks into the CRD of SP-D via vicinal equatorial hydroxyl groups on the 2-and 3-position of its sugar ring (Allen et al. 2001a, b) . Although MBL affinity is reported to be very low for monosaccharide galactose, MBL crystallographic studies demonstrate that galactose is ligated in the MBL binding region via coordination bonds with hydroxyl groups placed at C1 and C2 position of the sugar ring (Ng et al. 1996) . In addition to galactose and mannose, binding of collectins to a range of sugars has also been studied ; they exhibit preferences for certain sugar residues over others. For instance, despite SP-D being structurally similar to conglutinin, it displays a greater affinity for maltose, a glucose disaccharide, which is a weak ligand for conglutinin. SP-D is suggested to have a lower affinity for GlcNAc, which is the best ligand for conglutinin.

Initially, MBL was isolated from the liver of the rabbit, rat and chicken, where expression levels were detected in the soluble cytosol, rather than on the cell surface. Two forms of MBL (MBL-A and MBL-C) were detected in rodents (Hansen et al. 2000; Drickamer et al. 1986 ), rabbits (Kawasaki et al. 1978 Kozutsumi et al. 1980 ) and rhesus monkeys (Mogues et al. 1996) . However, only one form of MBL is present in humans and chimpanzees (Mogues et al. 1996) . Although the liver is the main production site of MBL-A and MBL-C in mice, mRNA expression of MBL was also detected in various tissues (Table 4 .1) (Shushimita et al. 2015) . Substantial expression levels of MBL-A and MBL-C were reported in kidney and intestine (Table 4 .1). Detection of MBL proteins in the small intestine suggests that MBL may have similar roles to secretory IgA (Reichhardt et al. 2012 ). The collectins SP-A and SP-D are primarily detected in the alveolar space of the lungs, and synthesised by alveolar type-II cells (Table 4 .1) (Voorhout et al. 1992 , Nayak et al. 2012 , and nonciliated bronchial epithelial cells, also known as Clara cells (Voorhout et al. 1992; Crouch et al. 1992) . Although the lung is the main site of SP-A and SP-D synthesis, presence of SP-D has also been reported at extrapulmonary sites. SP-D expression has been shown immunohistochemically in human trachea, brain, heart, kidneys, testis, salivary gland, placenta, prostate, small intestine, and pancreas (Table 4 .1). A low expression level has been detected in spleen, uterus, adrenal gland and mammary glands (Fisher and Mason 1995; Madsen et al. 2000; Her\u00edas et al. 2007) . Furthermore, immunoreactivity of SP-D has also been shown in the epithelial cells of both small and large ducts of the parotid gland, lacrimal and sweat glands, epithelial cells of intra-hepatic bile ducts and gall bladder, as well as esophagus, exocrine pancreatic ducts, and in the urinary tract (Madsen et al. 2000; Br\u00e4uer et al. 2007 ). In the case of SP-A, low levels are detected in small intestines from human and rat (Table 4 .1) (Lin et al. 2001 , van Iwaarden et al. 1990 ). In addition to its presence in the murine uterus, very low SP-A expression is found in human prostate, amniotic fluid, thymus and salivary gland . SP-A and SP-D have also been localised in the fetal membranes, and choriodecidual layer of the late pregnancy uterus (Miyamura et al. 1994) . As a result of pulmonary microbial infection, the protein levels of both SP-A and SP-D have been reported to increase in the alveolar compartment (Atochina et al. 2001) . Thus, the level of SP-D increases in response to allergen-induced eosinophilia (Kasper et al. 2002) , suggesting that both SP-A and SP-D may function as acute phase reactants within the lungs. Furthermore, hypoxia results in an increased concentration of both SP-A and SP-D in the alveolar compartment (White et al. 2001) . Conglutinin, CL-46 and CL-43 are serum collectins identified in bovidae and synthesised in the liver . These collectins provide a first line of defense against microbial pathogens. CL-L1 mRNA was detected in the liver, and studies using Northern blot analysis have suggested that low levels occur in the placenta. Although most collectins are secreted, CL-L1 was found in the cytosol of hepatocytes, which may suggest its interaction with intracellular ligands . The presence of CL-P1 was reported in vascular endothelial cells (Table 4 .1); CL-P1 is suggested to be membrane bound, and it contains an intracellular domain (Ohtani et al. 2001) . Expression of MBL, SP-A and SP-D at the mucosal surfaces suggest the innate immune roles of these collectins against invading pathogens. During Helicobacter pylori infection, an increased level of SP-D has been detected, suggesting the possible role of SP-D in the mucosal defense outside the lungs (Murray et al. 2002) , eg. gastrointestinal tract.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 75, "end": 95, "text": "(Sastry et al. 1991;", "ref_id": "BIBREF229"}, {"start": 96, "end": 118, "text": "Ezekowitz et al. 1988;", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 119, "end": 138, "text": "Hansen et al. 2000)", "ref_id": "BIBREF66"}, {"start": 371, "end": 391, "text": "(Hansen et al. 2000;", "ref_id": "BIBREF66"}, {"start": 392, "end": 413, "text": "Drickamer et al. 1986", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 414, "end": 446, "text": "), rabbits (Kawasaki et al. 1978", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 447, "end": 468, "text": "Kozutsumi et al. 1980", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 490, "end": 510, "text": "(Mogues et al. 1996)", "ref_id": "BIBREF178"}, {"start": 580, "end": 600, "text": "(Mogues et al. 1996)", "ref_id": "BIBREF178"}, {"start": 751, "end": 775, "text": "(Shushimita et al. 2015)", "ref_id": "BIBREF236"}, {"start": 986, "end": 1009, "text": "(Reichhardt et al. 2012", "ref_id": "BIBREF216"}, {"start": 1156, "end": 1177, "text": "(Voorhout et al. 1992", "ref_id": "BIBREF279"}, {"start": 1178, "end": 1197, "text": ", Nayak et al. 2012", "ref_id": "BIBREF189"}, {"start": 1270, "end": 1292, "text": "(Voorhout et al. 1992;", "ref_id": "BIBREF279"}, {"start": 1293, "end": 1312, "text": "Crouch et al. 1992)", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}, {"start": 1718, "end": 1741, "text": "(Fisher and Mason 1995;", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1742, "end": 1761, "text": "Madsen et al. 2000;", "ref_id": "BIBREF157"}, {"start": 1762, "end": 1781, "text": "Her\u00edas et al. 2007)", "ref_id": "BIBREF82"}, {"start": 2082, "end": 2102, "text": "(Madsen et al. 2000;", "ref_id": "BIBREF157"}, {"start": 2103, "end": 2121, "text": "Br\u00e4uer et al. 2007", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 2222, "end": 2238, "text": "(Lin et al. 2001", "ref_id": "BIBREF138"}, {"start": 2239, "end": 2265, "text": ", van Iwaarden et al. 1990", "ref_id": "BIBREF270"}, {"start": 2533, "end": 2555, "text": "(Miyamura et al. 1994)", "ref_id": "BIBREF177"}, {"start": 2704, "end": 2726, "text": "(Atochina et al. 2001)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2808, "end": 2828, "text": "(Kasper et al. 2002)", "ref_id": "BIBREF112"}, {"start": 3031, "end": 3050, "text": "(White et al. 2001)", "ref_id": "BIBREF293"}, {"start": 3676, "end": 3696, "text": "(Ohtani et al. 2001)", "ref_id": "BIBREF198"}, {"start": 3998, "end": 4018, "text": "(Murray et al. 2002)", "ref_id": "BIBREF182"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 738, "end": 746, "text": "(Table 4", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}, {"start": 865, "end": 873, "text": "(Table 4", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}, {"start": 1143, "end": 1151, "text": "(Table 4", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}, {"start": 1611, "end": 1619, "text": "(Table 4", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}, {"start": 2209, "end": 2217, "text": "(Table 4", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}, {"start": 3581, "end": 3589, "text": "(Table 4", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}], "section": "Biosynthesis and Localisation of Collectins"}, {"text": "Collectins are important soluble pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs) of the humoral arm of the innate immune response.

Whilst, SP-B and SP-C are hydrophobic and essential for the physiology of the alveolar surfaces, SP-A and SP-D are hydrophilic and contribute to lung immunity. An early study showed that pulmonary surfactant enhanced the killing of Staphylococcus aureus by alveolar macrophages (AM), in vitro (LaForce et al. 1973) . Both Gram-negative and Grampositive bacteria are recognised by SP-A and SP-D, enhancing their phagocytosis by AMs (Fig. 4 .3) (Pikaar et al. 1995) . For Gram-negative bacteria, SP-A and SP-D both bind to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) but differ in preferential targets on the molecule. SP-A binds to the lipid A moiety of rough LPS (which lacks the O-antigen and shortened oligosaccharides) (Van Iwaarden et al. 1994) , and enhances phagocytosis of bacteria by AM (Kalina et al. 1995) , but not to smooth LPS (which contains the O-antigen) (Van Iwaarden et al. 1994) . In contrast, SP-D binds strongly to smooth LPS from Escherichia coli and Salmonella species but does not recognise the lipid A moiety or oligosaccharide deficient LPS (Kuan et al. 1992) . This indicates that SP-D preferentially targets the core terminal saccharides in the bacterial ligand, whilst SP-A prefers lipid A.

Fully assembled SP-A protein contains both gene products. A number of studies have described polymorphisms in these genes and the SP-D gene which may have a role in susceptibility to microbial infection, particularly tuberculosis. Polymorphisms within and flanking the SP-A1 and SP-A2 genes have been described which indicate protection or susceptibility toward pulmonary TB in the populations studied in Mexico, Ethiopia, India and China (Floros et al. 2000; Madan et al. 2002; Malik et al. 2006; Vaid et al. 2006; Yang et al. 2014) . Two SP-A1 alleles (SFTPA1 307A, SFTPA1 776T) and two SP-A2 alleles (SFTPA2 355C and SFTPA2 751C) were associated with tuberculosis susceptibility in Ethiopia (Malik et al. 2006 ).

The structure of MBL is similar to that of SP-A, and in the presence of Ca 2+ , it has been observed to target terminal sugars (e.g. d-mannose, l-fucose, and N-acetyl-d-glucosamine), on the surface of a number of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial species (Ip et al. 2009; Lugo-Villarino et al. 2011) . The binding of MBL to microbial surfaces can activate complement through MBL-associated serine proteases (MASPs), resulting in enhanced microbial clearance via opsonisation (C3 and C4 deposition) and complement-mediated lysis. However, MBL also has complement-independent activity such as inhibition of bacterial adhesion (Jack et al. 2005 ) and opsonisation to enhance bacterial uptake (Kuhlman et al. 1989; Polotsky et al. 1997; Jack et al. 2005) . Strong in vitro binding of MBL to S. aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Listeria monocytogenes and nonencapsulated Neisseria meningitidis has been described (Levitz et al. 1993; van Emmerik et al. 1994; Neth et al. 2000) . Moderate levels of MBL binding were observed in E. coli, Haemophilus influenzae and Klebsiella species, whilst no binding has been observed for P. aeruginosa, Enterococcus species and Streptococcus pneumoniae (Levitz et al. 1993; van Emmerik et al. 1994; Neth et al. 2000) . Bacterial pathogens have involved strategies to interfere with MBL binding and functions for survival, via the synthesis of a polysaccharide capsule and sialylation of LPS ligands on the bacterial surface which reduces the binding of MBL (Jack et al. 2005; Krarup et al. 2005 ). This effectively masks or alters the bacterial ligands for MBL interaction. A number of studies have characterised the bacterial ligands for MBL. MBL is able to bind to peptidoglycan and lipoteichoic acid from S. aureus (Polotsky et al. 1996; Nadesalingam et al. 2005a, b) , LAM from M. avium (Polotsky et al. 1997 (Jack et al. 1998; Devyatyarova-Johnson et al. 2000; Jack et al. 2001; Gulati et al. 2002) . M. meningitidis can also interfere with MBL binding through encapsulation (van Emmerik et al. 1994) , whilst M. gonorrhoeae is not able to form capsules. Encapsulation seems to be less robust at decreasing MBL binding than sialyation of LOS (Jack et al. 1998) . Bound MBL can activate complement and the ability of Neisseria species to cascade complement all the way to C9 (membrane attack complex (MAC)) is crucial for protection against infection, since they are otherwise poorly phagocytosed by neutrophils and macrophages when opsonised by C3 (Ross and Densen 1984) . MBL bound to the surface of Neisseria is able to increase bacterial killing via increased complement activation (Jack et al. 1998 (Jack et al. , 2001 Gulati et al. 2002) , and similar observations of bactericidal activity have been reported for E. coli and Salmonella species (Kawasaki et al. 1989; Ihara et al. 1991) . For most other bacteria, complement activation to the C3 deposition stage is enough for protection via increased phagocytosis through opsonisation by complement products on the bacterial cell surface. MBL can increase C3b deposition on S. aureus (Neth et al. 2002) , but this does not appear to result in increased complement activation (Cunnion et al. 2001) . MBL targets wall teichoic acid in S. aureus and this interaction is particularly important in infants that have not developed adaptive immunity, leading to bacterial clearance via MBL-mediated complement activation (Kurokawa et al. 2016 ).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 382, "end": 398, "text": "(Ip et al. 2009;", "ref_id": "BIBREF101"}, {"start": 399, "end": 426, "text": "Lugo-Villarino et al. 2011)", "ref_id": "BIBREF146"}, {"start": 751, "end": 768, "text": "(Jack et al. 2005", "ref_id": "BIBREF104"}, {"start": 816, "end": 837, "text": "(Kuhlman et al. 1989;", "ref_id": "BIBREF117"}, {"start": 838, "end": 859, "text": "Polotsky et al. 1997;", "ref_id": "BIBREF209"}, {"start": 860, "end": 877, "text": "Jack et al. 2005)", "ref_id": "BIBREF104"}, {"start": 1034, "end": 1054, "text": "(Levitz et al. 1993;", "ref_id": "BIBREF130"}, {"start": 1055, "end": 1079, "text": "van Emmerik et al. 1994;", "ref_id": "BIBREF269"}, {"start": 1080, "end": 1097, "text": "Neth et al. 2000)", "ref_id": "BIBREF190"}, {"start": 1309, "end": 1329, "text": "(Levitz et al. 1993;", "ref_id": "BIBREF130"}, {"start": 1330, "end": 1354, "text": "van Emmerik et al. 1994;", "ref_id": "BIBREF269"}, {"start": 1355, "end": 1372, "text": "Neth et al. 2000)", "ref_id": "BIBREF190"}, {"start": 1613, "end": 1631, "text": "(Jack et al. 2005;", "ref_id": "BIBREF104"}, {"start": 1632, "end": 1650, "text": "Krarup et al. 2005", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1874, "end": 1896, "text": "(Polotsky et al. 1996;", "ref_id": "BIBREF208"}, {"start": 1897, "end": 1926, "text": "Nadesalingam et al. 2005a, b)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1947, "end": 1968, "text": "(Polotsky et al. 1997", "ref_id": "BIBREF209"}, {"start": 1969, "end": 1987, "text": "(Jack et al. 1998;", "ref_id": "BIBREF102"}, {"start": 1988, "end": 2021, "text": "Devyatyarova-Johnson et al. 2000;", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}, {"start": 2022, "end": 2039, "text": "Jack et al. 2001;", "ref_id": "BIBREF103"}, {"start": 2040, "end": 2059, "text": "Gulati et al. 2002)", "ref_id": "BIBREF63"}, {"start": 2136, "end": 2161, "text": "(van Emmerik et al. 1994)", "ref_id": "BIBREF269"}, {"start": 2303, "end": 2321, "text": "(Jack et al. 1998)", "ref_id": "BIBREF102"}, {"start": 2609, "end": 2631, "text": "(Ross and Densen 1984)", "ref_id": "BIBREF217"}, {"start": 2746, "end": 2763, "text": "(Jack et al. 1998", "ref_id": "BIBREF102"}, {"start": 2764, "end": 2783, "text": "(Jack et al. , 2001", "ref_id": "BIBREF103"}, {"start": 2784, "end": 2803, "text": "Gulati et al. 2002)", "ref_id": "BIBREF63"}, {"start": 2910, "end": 2932, "text": "(Kawasaki et al. 1989;", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2933, "end": 2951, "text": "Ihara et al. 1991)", "ref_id": "BIBREF96"}, {"start": 3200, "end": 3218, "text": "(Neth et al. 2002)", "ref_id": "BIBREF191"}, {"start": 3291, "end": 3312, "text": "(Cunnion et al. 2001)", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}, {"start": 3530, "end": 3551, "text": "(Kurokawa et al. 2016", "ref_id": "BIBREF118"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "MBL"}, {"text": "In addition to its complement-mediated activities, MBL is also has various intrinsic effects, being able to act as an opsonin independently and other direct effects.

MBL-deficient mice are susceptible to S. aureus infection , whilst MBL deficiency increases susceptibility to postburn infection with P. aeruginosa (Moller-Kristensen et al. 2006) . A large cohort study has also found a strong association between MBL deficiency and meningococcal infection, and pneumococcal pneumonia, in patients undergoing chemotherapy (Gaynor et al. 1995; Kronborg et al. 2002; Roy et al. 2002) . In contrast, normal or increased levels of MBL are linked to frequent infection with M. tuberculosis and M. leprae (Garred et al. 1994 (Garred et al. , 1997b , probably through complement-mediated phagocytosis of the pathogen. Up to 30% of healthy individuals have polymorphisms linked to MBL deficiency and these, together with serum levels, have been associated with susceptibility to tuberculosis and other inflammatory diseases in some ethnic populations (Takahashi and Ezekowitz 2005; Thiel et al. 2006; Goyal et al. 2016 ).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 137, "end": 164, "text": "(Eisen and Minchinton 2003)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 291, "end": 315, "text": "(Steffensen et al. 2000)", "ref_id": "BIBREF240"}, {"start": 460, "end": 485, "text": "(Valdimarsson et al. 2004", "ref_id": "BIBREF262"}, {"start": 637, "end": 668, "text": "(Moller-Kristensen et al. 2006)", "ref_id": "BIBREF179"}, {"start": 844, "end": 864, "text": "(Gaynor et al. 1995;", "ref_id": "BIBREF50"}, {"start": 865, "end": 886, "text": "Kronborg et al. 2002;", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 887, "end": 903, "text": "Roy et al. 2002)", "ref_id": "BIBREF222"}, {"start": 1021, "end": 1040, "text": "(Garred et al. 1994", "ref_id": "BIBREF46"}, {"start": 1041, "end": 1063, "text": "(Garred et al. , 1997b", "ref_id": "BIBREF48"}, {"start": 1365, "end": 1395, "text": "(Takahashi and Ezekowitz 2005;", "ref_id": "BIBREF244"}, {"start": 1396, "end": 1414, "text": "Thiel et al. 2006;", "ref_id": "BIBREF252"}, {"start": 1415, "end": 1432, "text": "Goyal et al. 2016", "ref_id": "BIBREF60"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "MBL"}, {"text": "Of the three more recently discovered collectins (CL-L1, CL-K1, CL-P1), CL-L1 and CL-P1 have been shown to have bacterial interactions. CL-K binds to E. coli, K. pneumoniae, P. aeruginosa and M. tuberculosis (Keshi et al. 2006; Hansen et al. 2010; Troegeler et al. 2015) , whilst CL-P1 can bind to E. coli and S. aureus Jang et al. 2009 ). Both CL-L1 and CL-K1 can activate the complement lectin pathway as can the heteromeric form CL-LK, which interacts with the MASPs (Henriksen et al. 2013) . CL-P1 can activate the alternative and classical pathways via its interaction with C-reactive protein (CRP) (Roy et al. 2016 ). There is limited data on the activity of CL-LK in vivo and in vitro, but due to average serum concentrations being below that of MBL (0.3 \u03bcg/ml vs. 1.5 \u03bcg/ml), pathogen recognition and clearance through complement activation is likely to have a minor role to play for these collectins. It is not clear whether these collectins can act directly as opsonins in a complement-independent manner. CL-L1 can bind d-mannose, Nacetylglucosamine, d-galactose, l-fucose and d-fructose in a Ca 2+ dependent manner Axelgaard et al. 2013) . Similarly, CL-K1 can also bind l-fucose, d-mannose and N-acetylmannosamine Hansen et al. 2010 ). Furthermore, CL-LK was recently demonstrated to be a PRR for M. tuberculosis, being able to primarily target mannose-capped lipoarabinomannan (ManLAM), in a Ca 2+ dependent manner, on the surface of the mycobacterium, but not to M. smegmatis due to the lack of mannose caps on its LAM (Troegeler et al. 2015) . Mice deficient in CL-K1 did not show altered susceptibility to M. tuberculosis infection and CL-LK opsonised M. tuberculosis did not result in altered phagocytosis or intracellular survival of the pathogen in human macrophages (Troegeler et al. 2015) . Interestingly, the levels of CL-LK in serum of tuberculosis patients is reduced, compared to controls, correlating inversely to the immune response to M. tuberculosis and suggesting that it may be useful as a biomarker for the disease (Troegeler et al. 2015) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 208, "end": 227, "text": "(Keshi et al. 2006;", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 228, "end": 247, "text": "Hansen et al. 2010;", "ref_id": "BIBREF68"}, {"start": 248, "end": 270, "text": "Troegeler et al. 2015)", "ref_id": "BIBREF256"}, {"start": 320, "end": 336, "text": "Jang et al. 2009", "ref_id": "BIBREF106"}, {"start": 470, "end": 493, "text": "(Henriksen et al. 2013)", "ref_id": "BIBREF81"}, {"start": 604, "end": 620, "text": "(Roy et al. 2016", "ref_id": "BIBREF223"}, {"start": 1127, "end": 1149, "text": "Axelgaard et al. 2013)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1227, "end": 1245, "text": "Hansen et al. 2010", "ref_id": "BIBREF68"}, {"start": 1534, "end": 1557, "text": "(Troegeler et al. 2015)", "ref_id": "BIBREF256"}, {"start": 1787, "end": 1810, "text": "(Troegeler et al. 2015)", "ref_id": "BIBREF256"}, {"start": 2048, "end": 2071, "text": "(Troegeler et al. 2015)", "ref_id": "BIBREF256"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "CL-L1, CL-K1, CL-P1 and the Bovine-Unique Collectins, Conglutinin, CL-43 and CL-46"}, {"text": "Conglutinin was the first mammalian collectin to be discovered and is found in Bovidae, together with other lesser known collectins (CL-43 and CL-46) . Conglutinin is similar in overall structure to SP-D and is able to bind to microbial surfaces in the presence of Ca 2+ . Conglutinin is secreted by the liver and found predominantly in bovine serum at an average concentration of 12 \u03bcg/ml . Conglutinin has been shown to have anti-microbial properties. Low serum levels of conglutinin have been associated with acute infections (e.g. pneumonia and metritis) and predisposition to respiratory infection (Ingram and Mitchell 1971; Holmskov et al. 1998) . Conglutinin is able to bind many microbes, including Gram-negative bacteria such as E. coli and Salmonella typhimurium (Friis-Christiansen et al. 1990; Friis et al. 1991) , LPS and peptidoglycan (Wang et al. 1995) and Gram-positive bacteria such as mycobacteria (Dec et al. 2012; Mehmood et al. 2019) . Conglutinin is uniquely able to bind to iC3b, via the mannose sugars on the \u03b1-chain of iC3b (Laursen et al. 1994 ). Conglutinin is able to bind and agglutinate iC3b-coated erythrocytes (Lachmann and Muller-Eberhard 1968; Laursen et al. 1994) , and as well as E. coli, increasing the respiratory burst of phagocytes (Friis et al. 1991 ). Conglutinin has also been shown to be protective against bacterial infection in vivo, being able to increase the survival of mice experimentally infected with highly virulent strains of S. typhimurium (Friis-Christiansen et al. 1990) . A recombinant truncated form of conglutinin, composed of the \u03b1-helical neck region and the CRD of conglutinin (Wang et al. 1995) , was recently shown to bind to able to bind to the vaccine strain Mycobacterium bovis BCG (probably via LAM), and act as an anti-opsonin both in the presence and absence of complement deposition. Thus, Conglutinin can interfere with the uptake of the bacterium by THP-1 macrophages and alter their inflammatory response (Mehmood et al. 2019 ). This suggests that conglutinin interfers with uptake of mycobacteria by macrophages via two important mechanisms: (1) blocking interaction of mycobacterial LAM with mannose receptor, and (2) blocking iC3b interaction with complement receptors CR3 and CR4 (Mehmood et al. 2019) .

SP-D is also able to inhibit NA activity, with inhibition being stopped in the presence of D-mannose (Reading et al. 1997) . SP-D has a stronger inhibitory effect on NA compared to SP-A (Tecle et al. 2007 ). SP-D binds to mannosylated, N-linked sugars on viral HA and NA via its CRD, resulting in potent anti-IAV infectivity (Hartshorn et al. 1994 (Hartshorn et al. , 2000 . SP-D was able to inhibit virus-induced HA activity, block the enzymatic activity of viral NA, and neutralise the ability of seasonal H1N1 strains of IAV to infect human respiratory epithelial cells (Job et al. 2010) . However, in the same study, some pandemic H1N1 were found to be resistant to SP-D inhibition that correlated with the degree of N-glycosylation in the globular head of HA (Job et al. 2010) .

This contrasts with full-length SP-A which inhibits IAV infection and dampens the pro-inflammatory response, demonstrating that the full-length SP-A molecule is required for IAV protection (Al-Qahtani et al. 2019). However, in a similar study, a recombinant truncated form of SP-D (rfhSP-D) was shown to inhibit IAV entry, down-regulate viral factors (M1) and down-regulate the pro-inflammatory response (Al-Ahdal et al. 2018) . These opposing effects of rfhSP-A and rfhSP-D provide further insight into IAV pathogenesis and the possible utility of rfhSP-D as a therapeutic molecule. In bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), SP-D enhances IAV uptake and virus-induced respiratory burst by neutrophils , but other collectins (SP-A), mucins and gp-340 dampen SP-D's effect, and thus, significantly reduce the ability of SP-D to promote neutrophil oxidative response . Therefore, the net effect of BAL is to increase neutrophil uptake of IAV while reducing the respiratory burst response to virus . SP-A is also able to bind to herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) via viral N-linked sugars and enhance phagocytosis of the virus by macrophages (van Iwaarden et al. 1991; Van Iwaarden et al. 1992a, b) . The mechanism of binding of SP-A to HSV-1 is similar to binding to IAV, involving interaction with the sialylated carbohydrate on the collectin's CRD. SP-A also has an opsonin activity, increasing uptake of HSV-1 by AM (van Iwaarden et al. 1991) . Similarly, SP-A binds to cytomegalovirus and enhances viral entry into rat lung cells (Weyer et al. 2000) . It is unknown whether SP-D has any activity against other Herpesviridae. SP-A is able to bind to respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) targeting the F2 subunit of the viral F antigen and is able neutralise the virus (Ghildyal et al. 1999; Sano et al. 1999 Sano et al. , 2000 . Children with severe RSV infection have reduced levels of SP-A and SP-D in BAL samples compared to healthy controls (Kerr and Paton 1999). In SP-A \u2212/\u2212 knockout mice, RSV infection was more severe than in SP-A +/+ mice and the addition of exogenous SP-A to SP-A \u2212/\u2212 mice reduced viral load and inflammation, and enhanced RSV clearance (LeVine et al. 1999) . SP-D can bind to RSV protein G and is able to neutralise RSV infectivity in vitro (Hickling et al. 1999) . Interestingly, RSV itself can alter SP-A expression in human pulmonary epithelial cells, upon infection by interfering with protein translation (Bruce et al. 2009 ). SP-A binds to Human Immunodeficiency Virus 1 (HIV-1) via the viral envelope gp120 glycoprotein and inhibits direct infection of CD4 + T cells (Gaiha et al. 2008 ). Yet, in dendritic cells (DC), SP-A increases HIV uptake, through enhanced binding to gp120 and facilitates transfer of HIV from DC to CD4 + T cells (Gaiha et al. 2008) . SP-D is also able to bind to HIV gp120 and inhibit viral infectivity (Meschi et al. 2005) , whilst rfhSP-D was also able to bind to gp120 and prevent infection of Jurkat T cells, U937 monocytic cells and PBMC, and significantly suppress the HIV-1 induced cytokine storm in these cells (Pandit et al. 2014 ). Interestingly, a direct protein-protein interaction between rfhSP-D and DC-SIGN (dendritic cell-specific intercellular adhesion molecule-3-grabbing nonintegrin) modulates the capture of HIV-1 and its transfer to CD4 + T cells, revealing a novel and distinct anti-viral mechanism against HIV-1 by SP-D (Dodagatta-Marri et al. 2017) . This same rfhSP-D has also been recently shown to restrict the transfer of HIV across the vaginal epithelial barrier, by altering the gene expression signature of the epithelium (Pandit et al. 2019) . These recent studies demonstrate the therapeutic potential of rfhSP-D against HIV infection.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 227, "end": 250, "text": "(Al-Qahtani et al. 2019", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 658, "end": 680, "text": "(Al-Ahdal et al. 2018)", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 1386, "end": 1412, "text": "(van Iwaarden et al. 1991;", "ref_id": "BIBREF271"}, {"start": 1413, "end": 1442, "text": "Van Iwaarden et al. 1992a, b)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1664, "end": 1690, "text": "(van Iwaarden et al. 1991)", "ref_id": "BIBREF271"}, {"start": 1779, "end": 1798, "text": "(Weyer et al. 2000)", "ref_id": "BIBREF291"}, {"start": 2013, "end": 2035, "text": "(Ghildyal et al. 1999;", "ref_id": "BIBREF55"}, {"start": 2036, "end": 2052, "text": "Sano et al. 1999", "ref_id": "BIBREF225"}, {"start": 2053, "end": 2071, "text": "Sano et al. , 2000", "ref_id": "BIBREF226"}, {"start": 2408, "end": 2428, "text": "(LeVine et al. 1999)", "ref_id": "BIBREF127"}, {"start": 2513, "end": 2535, "text": "(Hickling et al. 1999)", "ref_id": "BIBREF83"}, {"start": 2682, "end": 2700, "text": "(Bruce et al. 2009", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 2846, "end": 2864, "text": "(Gaiha et al. 2008", "ref_id": "BIBREF44"}, {"start": 3016, "end": 3035, "text": "(Gaiha et al. 2008)", "ref_id": "BIBREF44"}, {"start": 3107, "end": 3127, "text": "(Meschi et al. 2005)", "ref_id": "BIBREF174"}, {"start": 3323, "end": 3342, "text": "(Pandit et al. 2014", "ref_id": "BIBREF200"}, {"start": 3642, "end": 3676, "text": "SP-D (Dodagatta-Marri et al. 2017)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3857, "end": 3877, "text": "(Pandit et al. 2019)", "ref_id": "BIBREF201"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "SP-A and SP-D"}, {"text": "Elevated levels of serum SP-D have been reported in severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus infected patients (Wu et al. 2009 ).

Moreover, MBL also has the added ability to deposit complement on IAV-infected cells (Reading et al. 1995) . There are also elevated levels of MBL in the lung during IAV infection, suggesting that it may be important for protection against IAV pathogenesis (Reading et al. 1997; Fidler et al. 2009 ). MBL can inhibit viral hemagglutination and directly neutralise IAV in either a complement-dependent or independent manner (Hartshorn et al. 1993b; Anders et al. 1994; Kase et al. 1999) . MBL binds to IAV HA and NA, and without involving complement, neutralises the virus ). However, some IAV strains are resistant to the effects of MBL which is dependent on the degree of glycosylation on the viral HA globular domain (Reading et al. 1997; Job et al. 2010; Tokunaga et al. 2011) . Furthermore, MBL \u2212/\u2212 mice were more susceptible to infection from highly glycosylated viral strains of IAV than wild-type mice (Chang et al. 2010 ). However, pandemic strain H1N1 and avian influenza A H9N2 produced more severe disease (enhanced production of pro-inflammatory response) in wild-type mice compared to MBL \u2212/\u2212 mice, suggesting that MBL may have a deleterious effect in some IAV infections (Ling et al. 2012) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 304, "end": 325, "text": "(Hartley et al. 1992;", "ref_id": "BIBREF70"}, {"start": 326, "end": 349, "text": "Hartshorn et al. 1993b;", "ref_id": "BIBREF72"}, {"start": 350, "end": 369, "text": "Reading et al. 1995", "ref_id": "BIBREF213"}, {"start": 370, "end": 391, "text": "Reading et al. , 1997", "ref_id": "BIBREF214"}, {"start": 479, "end": 500, "text": "(Reading et al. 1995)", "ref_id": "BIBREF213"}, {"start": 651, "end": 672, "text": "(Reading et al. 1997;", "ref_id": "BIBREF214"}, {"start": 673, "end": 691, "text": "Fidler et al. 2009", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 817, "end": 841, "text": "(Hartshorn et al. 1993b;", "ref_id": "BIBREF72"}, {"start": 842, "end": 861, "text": "Anders et al. 1994;", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 862, "end": 879, "text": "Kase et al. 1999)", "ref_id": "BIBREF111"}, {"start": 1113, "end": 1134, "text": "(Reading et al. 1997;", "ref_id": "BIBREF214"}, {"start": 1135, "end": 1151, "text": "Job et al. 2010;", "ref_id": "BIBREF108"}, {"start": 1152, "end": 1173, "text": "Tokunaga et al. 2011)", "ref_id": "BIBREF255"}, {"start": 1303, "end": 1321, "text": "(Chang et al. 2010", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 1579, "end": 1597, "text": "(Ling et al. 2012)", "ref_id": "BIBREF139"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 216, "end": 226, "text": "(Fig. 4.4)", "ref_id": "FIGREF4"}], "section": "MBL"}, {"text": "MBL is able to neutralise HIV-1 in vitro by binding to the N-linked mannose glycans of viral gp120, and binding to HIV-1 infected CD4 + T cells and monocytes and inhibiting reverse transcriptase activity (Ezekowitz et al. 1989; Teodorof et al. 2014) .

The binding of CL-L1 and CL-P1 to viruses has not been reported. Like SP-D, conglutinin binds to IAV resulting in the inhibition of hemagglutination and infectivity of the virus (Hartshorn et al. 1993a ). Conglutinin binds via its CRD to the high mannose sites on the viral HA. IAV treated with conglutinin also boosted neutrophil respiratory burst (Hartshorn et al. 1993a ). Conglutinin, CL-43 and bovine SP-D have been reported to bind the bovine rotavirus Nebraska calf diarrhoea virus, targeting its VP7 glycoprotein (Reading et al. 1998) . Binding resulted in hemagglutination and neuralisation of rotavirus, with CL-43 showing the highest activity against the virus; it is the first report of collectin activity against a nonenveloped virus (Reading et al. 1998 ). However, conglutinin has a higher inhibitory activity against IAV (strain HKx31) than bovine SP-D or CL-43 (Reading et al. 1998) .

It is also able to bind to HIV-1 gp160 and inhibit interaction of the virus with the CD4 receptor (Andersen et al. 1991) . Interestingly, a collectin-like protein analogous, to bovine conglutinin, was purified from human serum (called conglutinin-like protein) and this was demonstrated to bind to HIV-1 gp120 via its CRD and inhibit viral infectivity (Ushijima et al. 1992 ).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 183, "end": 203, "text": "(Hansen et al. 2010;", "ref_id": "BIBREF68"}, {"start": 204, "end": 227, "text": "Selman and Hansen 2012)", "ref_id": "BIBREF233"}, {"start": 408, "end": 431, "text": "(Hartshorn et al. 1993a", "ref_id": "BIBREF71"}, {"start": 579, "end": 602, "text": "(Hartshorn et al. 1993a", "ref_id": "BIBREF71"}, {"start": 751, "end": 772, "text": "(Reading et al. 1998)", "ref_id": "BIBREF215"}, {"start": 977, "end": 997, "text": "(Reading et al. 1998", "ref_id": "BIBREF215"}, {"start": 1108, "end": 1129, "text": "(Reading et al. 1998)", "ref_id": "BIBREF215"}, {"start": 1190, "end": 1211, "text": "(Fischer et al. 1994)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1312, "end": 1334, "text": "(Andersen et al. 1991)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1566, "end": 1587, "text": "(Ushijima et al. 1992", "ref_id": "BIBREF259"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "CL-L1, CL-K1, CL-P1 and the Bovine-Unique Collectins, Conglutinin, CL-43 and CL-46"}, {"text": "Collectins are able to recognise and bind to a number of fungi, both primary and opportunistic fungal pathogens, at various stages in their life cycle.

SP-A and SP-D can cause inhibition of conidia infectivity via agglutination, enhancement of phagocytosis and intracellular killing of A. fumigatus conidia by neutrophils and AM (Madan et al. 1997a ). The fungal ligands of SP-A are 2 N-linked glycosylated glycoproteins (gp45 and gp55) isolated from culture filtrate and are also used for ELISA diagnosis of allergic aspergillosis (Madan et al. 1997b) .

In this study, IPA mice-treated intranasally with purified human SP-D or rfhSP-D showed 60 and 80% survival respectively (Madan et al. 2001a, b) . The basis of this therapeutic protection by SP-D and rfhSP-D was observed to be enhanced phagocytosis of conidia by macrophages and neutrophils, fungistatic effects on the growth of conidia and a dampening of pathogenic Th2 cytokines (IL-4 and IL-5), whilst enhancing protective Th1 cytokines (TNF-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b3) (Singh et al. 2009 ). SP-D \u2212/\u2212 knockout mice are more susceptible to IPA (Madan et al. 2010 ). However, SP-A \u2212/\u2212 knockout mice demonstrate resistance to IPA, suggesting that SP-A may be involved in the pathogenesis of IPA (Madan et al. 2010 ). Both SP-A and SP-D also have a direct effect on Histoplasma capsulatum, inhibiting its growth by increasing the permeability of the fungal membrane ). However, no aggregation of H. capsulatum was observed by SP-A or SP-D, and neither collectin altered the phagocytosis of the fungus or inhibited the growth of macrophage-infected H. capsulatum . SP-A is also able to bind to Cryptococcus neoformans, both in its encapsulated and non-encapsulated yeast form, but this does not result in increased phagocytosis of the acapsular form (Walenkamp et al. 1999 ). SP-A binding was Ca 2+ -dependent and was inhibited by glucose and mannose, but not galactose (Walenkamp et al. 1999 ). Intranasal infection with C. neoformans gave the same survival outcome in SP-A \u2212/\u2212 knockout mice and wild-type mice, suggesting that the fungus is resistant to SP-A mediated host defence mechanisms (Giles et al. 2007) . A subsequent study found that SP-D increases the phagocytosis of hypocapsular C. neoformans by murine macrophages and that this facilitated fungal survival (Geunes-Boyer et al. 2009 ). Other studies have also shown that SP-D can agglutinate C. neoformans and A. fumigatus (Schelenz et al. 1995; Madan et al. 1997a ). Furthermore, SP-D can bind to both encapsulated and acapsular C. neoformans and can aggregate acapsular C. neoformans in particular (van de Wetering et al. 2004a ). The cryptococcal capsular components glucuronoxylomannan (GXM) and mannoprotein 1 (MP1) are the ligands for SP-D (van de Wetering et al. 2004a ). SP-D is able to facilitate C. neoformans infection further by protecting the fungus against oxidative stress allowing for disease progression in the mouse model of infection (Geunes-Boyer et al. 2012) . SP-D is also able to bind Blastomyces dermatitidis, via \u03b2-glucan on its surface, and subsequently block interactions with \u03b2-glucan-receptors on AM (Lekkala et al. 2006 ). This study also showed a reduction in TNF-\u03b1, dampening the host inflammatory response and thus may facilitate disease progression (Lekkala et al. 2006 ). SP-D and SP-A can also bind to Coccidioides posadasii via its surface antigens. In a mouse model of infection, C. posadasii infection is able to suppress the expression of pulmonary SP-A and SP-D, possibly facilitating fungal disease progression and dissemination (Awasthi et al. 2004 ). SP-D can also bind to Candida albicans via its surface antigens and agglutinate the pathogen and directly inhibiting its growth without the requirement of macrophage dependent phagocytosis (van Rozendaal et al. 2000) . Similarly, SP-A is able to bind to C. albicans and interfere with attachment to AM, inhibiting phagocytosis (Rosseau et al. 1997) . SP-A is also able to dampen the pro-inflammatory response elicited by C. albicans by human AM and monocytes, which may be important in regulating excessive inflammation in the lung during Candida infection (Rosseau et al. 1999) . In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, SP-D is observed to bind to its surface, but not SP-A, whilst the fungal ligand for SP-D is yeast \u03b2-(1-6)-glucan (Allen et al. 2001a, b) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 173, "end": 196, "text": "(Madan et al. 2001a, b)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 320, "end": 343, "text": "(Madan et al. 2001a, b)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 657, "end": 675, "text": "(Singh et al. 2009", "ref_id": "BIBREF238"}, {"start": 730, "end": 748, "text": "(Madan et al. 2010", "ref_id": "BIBREF156"}, {"start": 879, "end": 897, "text": "(Madan et al. 2010", "ref_id": "BIBREF156"}, {"start": 1432, "end": 1454, "text": "(Walenkamp et al. 1999", "ref_id": "BIBREF283"}, {"start": 1552, "end": 1574, "text": "(Walenkamp et al. 1999", "ref_id": "BIBREF283"}, {"start": 1776, "end": 1795, "text": "(Giles et al. 2007)", "ref_id": "BIBREF57"}, {"start": 1954, "end": 1979, "text": "(Geunes-Boyer et al. 2009", "ref_id": "BIBREF52"}, {"start": 2070, "end": 2092, "text": "(Schelenz et al. 1995;", "ref_id": "BIBREF232"}, {"start": 2093, "end": 2111, "text": "Madan et al. 1997a", "ref_id": "BIBREF149"}, {"start": 2247, "end": 2276, "text": "(van de Wetering et al. 2004a", "ref_id": "BIBREF265"}, {"start": 2393, "end": 2422, "text": "(van de Wetering et al. 2004a", "ref_id": "BIBREF265"}, {"start": 2600, "end": 2626, "text": "(Geunes-Boyer et al. 2012)", "ref_id": "BIBREF53"}, {"start": 2776, "end": 2796, "text": "(Lekkala et al. 2006", "ref_id": "BIBREF124"}, {"start": 2930, "end": 2950, "text": "(Lekkala et al. 2006", "ref_id": "BIBREF124"}, {"start": 3218, "end": 3238, "text": "(Awasthi et al. 2004", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3431, "end": 3458, "text": "(van Rozendaal et al. 2000)", "ref_id": "BIBREF275"}, {"start": 3569, "end": 3590, "text": "(Rosseau et al. 1997)", "ref_id": "BIBREF218"}, {"start": 3799, "end": 3820, "text": "(Rosseau et al. 1999)", "ref_id": "BIBREF219"}, {"start": 3965, "end": 3988, "text": "(Allen et al. 2001a, b)", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "SP-A and SP-D"}, {"text": "The opportunistic fungus, Pneumocystis is able to infect a number of mammals with each species of the fungus displaying strict host specificity.

SP-A and SP-D are able to recognise and bind Pneumocystis species via the major surface glycoprotein (MSG; also known as gpA) of the fungus McCormack et al. 1997a, b) . MSG contains an N-linked carbohydrate chain made up of glucose, mannose, and N-acetylglucosamine and is involved in attachment of the fungus to alveolar epithelium in Pneumocystis pneumonia (Zimmerman et al. 1992; Vuk-Pavlovic et al. 2001) .

Immunosuppressed SP-A \u2212/\u2212 mice also have increased susceptibility to P. carinii infection (Linke et al. 2001) , whilst removal of immunosuppression resulted in efficient clearance of the infection , showing that SP-A does not enhance P. carinii clearance, but does modulate the host immune response during the resolution of infection. SP-D modulates interaction of P. carinii with AM and also aggregates P. carinii, impairing phagocytosis by AM (Yong et al. 2003) . In SP-D \u2212/\u2212 mice, there was delayed clearance of P. carinii infection, increased inflammation and altered nitric oxide response (Atochina et al. 2004) .

Similar levels of MBL-mediated complement deposition were also observed for C. parapsilosis (van Asbeck et al. 2008 ).

However, in the case of neutrophils, MBL enhances the phagocytosis of both C. albicans and C. parapsilosis yeast cells (van Asbeck et al. 2008) .

Through activation of complement, and production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, MBL makes a major impact on the generation and regulation of the immune-mediated inflammatory response. Allergen-mediated activation of the complement lectin pathway has been demonstrated (Varga et al. 2003) . Allergen extracts (parietaria (PA) and house dust (HD) mite) were shown to bind purified MBL, and trigger the lectin complement pathway. Differences in plasma MBL levels may affect the degree of complement activation in different individuals, thus, susceptibility to allergic diseases. Significantly elevated serum MBL levels were observed in pediatric mild-asthma patients, suggesting the possible role of MBL in the pathogenesis of asthma by contributing to airway inflammation, or increasing the risk of asthma development (Uguz et al. 2005) . Enhanced levels of serum MBL also correlate with an increased peripheral blood eosinophils in these individuals. It is also suggested that oxidative stress increases the MBL synthesis, and triggers complement activity. MBL can initiate complement activation following oxidative stress in asthma (Collard et al. 2000; Nadeem et al. 2003; Uguz et al. 2005) , and aggravate inflammation.

A common receptor for SP-A, MBL and C1q was described in 1990 (Malhotra et al. 1990) (Fig. 4.5) , as collagen region binding cC1qR. This was subsequently identified as Calreticulin (~56kDa). Two other candidate receptors were subsequently proposed: Fig. 4 .5 Collectin receptors on immune cells. Collectins have been shown to bind a number of receptors and putative receptors, which lead to immunomodulatory responses. Binding of collectins to Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR-2), TLR-4, SP-A receptor 210 (SP-R210), CD91-calreticulin, and signal inhibitory regulatory protein-\u03b1 (SIRP-\u03b1) alters production of pro-inflammatory mediators. For example, SP-A and SP-D binds to SIRP-\u03b1 via their collagenous tails, and stimulates pro-inflammatory chemokine production via calreticulin/CD91 interaction. Furthermore, bacterium bound collectins induces the conformational changes of calreticulin/CD91 interaction, which then activates P38-mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signalling pathway, leading to transcriptional activation of NF-\u03baB (nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells), and expression of pro-inflammatory cykines, including tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u03b1). SIRP\u03b1 is abundantly expressed in macrophages, and ligation of SIRP-\u03b1 by lung collectins are crucial in preventing damage to the airways caused by the production of pro-inflammatory responses. Thereby, phosphorylated cytoplasmic region of SIRP-\u03b1 recruits SHP-1 (Src homology region 2 domain-containing phosphatase-1), which in turn dephosphorylates protein substrates involved in mediating physiological effects. Thus, the interaction between SIRP-\u03b1 and SHP-1 negatively regulates P38-MAP kinase signalling, and stimulates NF-\u03baB activity, and cells become resistant to TNF-mediated effects, such as apoptosis (1) C1qRp (CD93) (C1q receptor associated with phagocytosis stimulated by C1q, MBL or SP-A): but this has subsequently been shown not to bind any of these ligands.

SP-A enhances the phagocytosis of S. aureus by monocytes but does not induce intracellular killing or the production of reactive oxygen intermediates (ROI) (Geertsma et al. 1994) . SP-A is also able to enhance the uptake of M. tuberculosis and M. avium by macrophages via the increased expression of mannose receptor (Gaynor et al. 1995; Kudo et al. 2004) , whilst SP-A enhances the scavenger receptor A (SR-A)-mediated uptake of Streptococcus pneumoniae by AM . SP-A is also reported to bind to a 210-kDa SP-A receptor (SPR210) in U937 macrophages and rat AM and mediate uptake of Mycobacterium bovis bacillus Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin (BCG) via this receptor (Chroneos et al. 1996; Weikert et al. 1997) ; in rat macrophages, this led to enhanced mycobacterial killing and an increase in the production of inflammatory mediators, TNF-\u03b1 and nitric oxide (Weikert et al. 2000) . SP-A and SP-D can also bind to the major LPS receptor, CD14 that is present on alveolar macrophages. SP-A binds to the peptide portion of CD14, whilst SP-D interacts with the glycan of the receptor (Sano et al. 2000) . SP-A modulates LPS-induced cellular responses by direct interaction with CD14 (Sano et al. 1999) , serving as an important mechanism for the recognition and clearance of this endotoxin. As noted above, SP-A and SP-D can interact with the versatile protein calreticulin (Malhotra et al. 1990 ). When SP-A and SP-D bind to surface target ligands such as LPS or apoptotic cells, multiple collagen regions are presented on the surface, which interact with the Calreticulin -CD91 receptor complex (Gardai et al. 2003) . This can then lead to the promotion of phagocytosis and initiation of cell signalling pathways leading to the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and priming of adaptive immunity (Ogden et al. 2001; Vandivier et al. 2002; Gardai et al. 2003) . In contrast, SP-A and SP-D can also suppress inflammatory responses by binding to signal regulating protein \u03b1 (SIRP-\u03b1) on macrophages and epithelia via their CRD region, and this leads to a signalling pathway that blocks pro-inflammatory mediator production ( Fig. 4 .5) (Table 4 .2) (Gardai et al. 2003) . Therefore, the orientation of binding of SP-A and SP-D (collagen or lectin (CRD)) domains to host receptors Calreticulin-CD91 or SIRP-\u03b1, respectively, have opposing effects and illustrate a dual function of these collectins, which could be, (1) protection of the na\u00efve lung via maintenance of immune homeostasis and (2) protection via the triggering of inflammation to clear pathogens, allergens, necrotic and apoptotic cells.

This interaction is independent of calcium ions, and ionic in nature. It is mediated by the collagen domain 'c' of the collectins (cC1qR). The C1q binding site has Regulation of phospholipid secretion and cytokine production, phagocytosis, and inhibition of T-cell proliferation been mapped to the S-domain of calreticulin (Stuart et al. 1996) . Conglutinin and CL-43 also bind C1qR and calreticulin (Dec and Wernicki 2006) . SP-A receptor 210 (SP-R210) is a 210 kDa oligomeric molecule that earlier has been purified from the macrophage cell line U937 by affinity chromatography (Fig. 4 .5 (Table 4 .2) (Chroneos et al. 1996) . SP-R210 is another candidate receptor for SP-A, and also found in type II cells and alveolar macrophages. The direct interaction between SP-R210 and SP-A occurs through the collagen region of SP-A. Antibodies raised against SP-R210 inhibit SP-A binding to alveolar type II cells and alveolar macrophages, thus, prevent SP-A-mediated uptake of Mycobacterium bovis, and block SP-A-bacillus Calmette-Guerin complexes to phagocytes. Furthermore, SP-R210 inhibited SP-A-mediated phospholipid secretion by alveolar type II cells (Weikert et al. 1997 ). Additionally, a study by Yang et al. reported SP-R210 as a cell surface myosin 18A (Yang et al. 2005) , and expressed in multiple isoforms. Gp340 is a 340 kDa SP-D binding glycoprotein purified from lung bronchoalvelar lavage of alveolar proteinosis patients , and belongs to the scavenger receptor superfamily, consisting of multiple scavenger receptor type B domains (Holmskov et al. 1999) . Furthermore, gp340 has been shown to be identical to salivary agglutinin, and its binding interaction with Streptococcus mutans and Helicobacter pylori has been reported (Ligtenberg et al. 2001) . The direct binding of SP-D to gp340 occurs in a calcium dependent manner, and is inhibited by EDTA. The interaction is not affected by the presence of maltose, suggesting that the binding is a protein-protein interaction via the CRD region of SP-D rather than a lectin-carbohydrate interaction. Similar binding pattern was observed between gp340 and rfhSP-D, composed of trimeric neck region and CRD . Gp340 exists in a soluble form, and acts as an adaptor for SP-A and SP-D, but how gp340 is anchored in the membrane and the mechanism of binding to cell surface has not been elucidated fully yet (Table 4 .2). SP-D can bind to human neutrophil defensins (HNPs) via its neck and CRD region (Hartshorn et al. 2006a, b) . The interaction between SP-D and HNPs can trigger anti-viral activity in the BAL fluid. HD6, human \u03b2-defensins, and human neutrophil peptide (HNP)-4 bind SP-D with weaker affinity, while HNP-1-3 bind SP-D with high affinity and trigger inhibition of SP-D mediated anti-viral activity (Doss et al. 2009 ). Additionally, SP-D binds human decorin from amniotic fluid in a calcium dependent manner via sulphated N-acetyl galactosamine moiety of decorin (Nadesalingam et al. 2003) . rfhSP-D interacts with dermatan sulphate moiety of decorin, and core protein of decorin interacts with SP-D via the collagen-like region. The interaction between lung collectins (SP-A and SP-D) and native as well as recombinant CD14 has been reported (Table 4 .2) (Sano et al. 1999) . CD14 is a soluble receptor for LPS, and the neck domain of SP-D has been shown to bind the leucine-rich peptide portion of CD14, whilst the carbohydrate moiety of CD14 interacts with the lectin domain of SP-D (Sano et al. 1999) . Thus, both these surfactant proteins appear to modulate the cellular response to smooth and rough LPS by interaction with CD14. (Sano et al. 1999) . Furthermore, the association of SP-A and SP-D with toll-like receptors (TLR), and or the TLR-associated molecule, could be one of the mechanisms by which they function as modulators of inflammation an inflammatory mediators (Sano et al. 1999) . Studies have reported direct involvement of SP-A in TLR2 signalling, and inhibition of downstream gene activation (Murakami et al. 2002) . SP-A interacts directly with TLR4 and myeloid differentiation factor 2 (MD-2), which are known critical signalling receptors for LPS (Billod et al. 2016) . Thus, binding of SP-A with extracellular domain of TLR4 and MD-2 was revealed in a calcium-dependent manner, involving the CRD region. Additionally, SP-A has attenuated cell surface binding of smooth LPS, and induced NF-\u03baB activation in cells expressing TLR4 and MD-2 (Murakami et al. 2002) . SP-D does not have significant effect on TLR4 expression, but it down-regulates the TLR4-mediated signalling against LPS (Henning et al. 2008 ). Thus, SP-A's ability to dampen TLR2 and TLR4 signalling is associated with decrease in the phosphorylation of IkappaBalpha, a key regulator of NF-\u03baB activity, and nuclear translocation of p65, resulting in reduced TNF-\u03b1 secretion in response to TLR ligands. Furthermore, the same study also reported diminished phosphorylation of Akt, an essential regulator of NF-\u03baB and potentially MAPKs. Therefore, there is a critical role for SP-A in modulating lung inflammatory reactions by regulating macrophage-mediated TLR4 activity.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 147, "end": 168, "text": "(Malhotra et al. 1993", "ref_id": "BIBREF161"}, {"start": 495, "end": 515, "text": "(Stuart et al. 1996)", "ref_id": "BIBREF241"}, {"start": 572, "end": 595, "text": "(Dec and Wernicki 2006)", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 776, "end": 798, "text": "(Chroneos et al. 1996)", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 1324, "end": 1344, "text": "(Weikert et al. 1997", "ref_id": "BIBREF287"}, {"start": 1373, "end": 1384, "text": "Yang et al.", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1431, "end": 1449, "text": "(Yang et al. 2005)", "ref_id": "BIBREF300"}, {"start": 1717, "end": 1739, "text": "(Holmskov et al. 1999)", "ref_id": "BIBREF93"}, {"start": 1912, "end": 1936, "text": "(Ligtenberg et al. 2001)", "ref_id": "BIBREF132"}, {"start": 2629, "end": 2656, "text": "(Hartshorn et al. 2006a, b)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2943, "end": 2960, "text": "(Doss et al. 2009", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}, {"start": 3108, "end": 3134, "text": "(Nadesalingam et al. 2003)", "ref_id": "BIBREF184"}, {"start": 3401, "end": 3419, "text": "(Sano et al. 1999)", "ref_id": "BIBREF225"}, {"start": 3631, "end": 3649, "text": "(Sano et al. 1999)", "ref_id": "BIBREF225"}, {"start": 3780, "end": 3798, "text": "(Sano et al. 1999)", "ref_id": "BIBREF225"}, {"start": 4025, "end": 4043, "text": "(Sano et al. 1999)", "ref_id": "BIBREF225"}, {"start": 4160, "end": 4182, "text": "(Murakami et al. 2002)", "ref_id": "BIBREF181"}, {"start": 4318, "end": 4338, "text": "(Billod et al. 2016)", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 4609, "end": 4631, "text": "(Murakami et al. 2002)", "ref_id": "BIBREF181"}, {"start": 4755, "end": 4775, "text": "(Henning et al. 2008", "ref_id": "BIBREF80"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 122, "end": 129, "text": "(Fig. 4", "ref_id": "FIGREF4"}, {"start": 134, "end": 142, "text": "(Table 4", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}, {"start": 752, "end": 759, "text": "(Fig. 4", "ref_id": "FIGREF4"}, {"start": 763, "end": 771, "text": "(Table 4", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}, {"start": 2536, "end": 2544, "text": "(Table 4", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}, {"start": 3388, "end": 3396, "text": "(Table 4", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}], "section": "Collectin (and C1q) Receptors"}, {"text": "As noted above, calreticulin was identified as a common receptor for C1q, MBL and SP-A (Malhotra et al. 1990) .

Their roles have been also implicated in altering profiles of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines as a result of infection, and allergen challenge.
