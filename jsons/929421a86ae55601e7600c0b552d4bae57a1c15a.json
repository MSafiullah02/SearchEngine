The titers of ANA heightened with increasing age, and attained to 1 :lo24 by the time mice reached 5 months of age. The occurrence of ANA was associated with development of splenic and hepatic fibrosis, glomerulonephritis and abnormalities of lymphoreticular tissue. The granular deposits of IgG and C3 detected by direct IF were initially found at the basement membrane of dermal-epidermal junction of rhino mice aged 2.5 months. These deposits distributed progressively in the fibrotic areas of spleen and liver, and renal glomerular tufts at 5 months of age. Dense deposits revealed by electron microscopy were found in the regions where IF of IgG and C3 was observed. Acid buffer eluates from liver and kidney contained IgG reactive with nuclear antigens. Importance of homozygous rhino gene was discussed in relation to development of autoimmune disorders of these mice. ACTA PATHOL.

The sites of these deposits corresponded to those of deposition of IgG and C3, as shown by IF. The series of these changes were analogous to those seen in NZB mice4J8,22,23,32 and patients with SLEl0jZ9, but organized structureslO of dense deposits were not found in rhino mice.",

Accordingly, it is conceivable that at least a part of tissue-bound gloublins is identical with ANA and that the immunoglobulins are deposited in the form of Ag-Ab complex.",

Depressed immune responses against allogenic tumor transplantation and thymus dependent antigens, such as sheep erythrocytes and bovine serum ablumin was also noted in old age of these mice15P. Histological examinations revealed that early involution of thymus associated with depletion of cortical lymphocytes, marked decrease of small lymphocytes in the thymus-dependent area of lymph nodes and spleen and prominent proliferation of plasma cells in almost all the lymphoid organs were consistently observed in rhino mice with increasing age15P. From the view point of functional activity and morphological structure of lymphoid organs, rhino mice are in the state of T-cell deficiency and B-cell stimulation like New Zealand This suggests that diminished T-cell activity and excessive B-cell activity may favor the appearance of autoimmunity. More recently, decline of suppressor T-cell function was reported in aged NZB mice and this phenomenon was assumed to be related to autoantibody production3.",

These include hypergammaglobulinemia ; the demonstration of autoantibodies against a body component ; immunoglobulin deposition in the affected tissue, such as renal glomerulus; the accumulation of lymphocytes and plasma cells in the tissue damaged by autoimmune processes; and multiple autoimmune manifestations in the same individual. Our present and previous observations revealed that the adult rhino mice possess all of these characteristics. Consequently, rhino mice might be considered to be a desirable experimental model of a genetically controlled multi-systemic autoimmune disease. Further studies of these mice, which are in progress in our laboratory, will provide valuable information concerning pathogenesis, etiologic factors and abnormal immune status in autoimmune diseases.",
