NP is the most common infection in the ICU and the most deadly of all nosocomial infections. It is the second most common nosocomial infection overall, second only to urinary tract infection.64 Although prevalence has been shown to vary between 12 and 29% in different studies,89 the mortality rate of NP has been uniformly high (20-50%).1,37 The case fatality ranges between 25 and 33% in most studies,50 though pneumonia is not necessarily the cause of death in these patients.35\n",

This is because the low-pressure high-volume cuff lies more closely in apposition with the tracheal wall and assumes the shape of the tracheal lumen with which it is in contact, thereby more reliably preventing aspiration.

By 1989, MRSA strains comprised 50% of all isolates of S. aureus in most major hospitals in the USA. Vancomycin and linezolid are considered the cornerstones for MRSA therapy. Vancomycin-resistant strains of enterococci have now been identified, as have strains of S. aureus showing intermediate sensitivity to vancomycin. The vancomycin-intermediate S. aureus or glycopeptide-resistant S. aureus (VISA, GISA) strains have surfaced under conditions of prolonged exposure to vancomycin, or in situations where dialysis or intravascular device placement was required. Vancomycin-resistant enterococci are capable of spreading vancomycin resistance to other organisms, since the mode of spread is plasmid transmission to other microbes by conjugation.",
