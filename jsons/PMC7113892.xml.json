            "text": "CoVs are enveloped viruses possessing a single stranded positive sense RNA genome of approximately 29.7 kb in length (Pan et al., 2008, Van Boheemen et al., 2012). The SARS-CoV initiates its replication cycle after binding to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) (Kuhn et al., 2004). After endocytosis, the viral RNA genome is released into the cellular host cytoplasm and translated into two large polyproteins (de Wit et al., 2016, Snijder et al., 2016). The pp1a and pp1ab polyproteins are next cleaved by viral proteases into 11 and 16 non-structural proteins respectively (nsp1 to 16). These proteins form a large replication transcription complex (RTC) which is associated to host cellular proteins (Van Hemert et al., 2008). CoV RTC ensures the replication of the viral genome and the transcription of genomic and sub-genomic mRNA. These viral RNAs are polyadenylated at their 3\u2032 end and protected by a 5\u2032 cap structure, which is synthetized by viral enzymes. The CoV capping pathway is thought to follow four sequential steps implicating several nsps: I) the 5\u2032-3\u2032 helicase/NTPase nsp13 hydrolyses first the phosphate \u03b3 from the nascent 5\u2019-triphosphorylated RNA (Ivanov and Ziebuhr, 2004); II) a GMP molecule is supposedly transferred to the diphosphorylated RNA by a still unknown guanylyltransferase forming a cap (GpppN) structure; III) the cap is then methylated at N7 position of the guanosine by nsp14 in the presence of methyl donor S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM) yielding to a cap-0 (7mGpppN) and S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine (SAH) by-product (Chen et al., 2009); IV) nsp10/nsp16 complex methylates at the ribose 2\u2032OH group of the first transcribed RNA leading to the conversion of the cap-0 (7mGpppN) into the cap-1 (7mGpppN2\u2019om) (Bouvet et al., 2010, Chen et al., 2011). In vitro assays have deciphered the mechanisms driving the RNA cap methylation in SARS- and MERS-CoV. It follows an obligatory order in which N7-methylation by nsp14 is a pre-requisite for 2\u2032O-methylation by the nsp10/nsp16 complex (Aouadi et al., 2017, Bouvet et al., 2014, Bouvet et al., 2010).",

The two domains communicate functionally, as truncation experiments showed that the N-terminal region of nsp14 is required for the N7-MTase activity (Chen et al., 2009). Both N7-MTase and ExoN activities have been confirmed by in vitro assay showing that the association of nsp10 to nsp14 stimulated >35 fold the ExoN activity while the N7-MTase activity does not depend on the nsp10-nsp14 interaction (Bouvet et al., 2012, Bouvet et al., 2010, Decroly et al., 2011).",

            "text": "The N7- and 2\u2032O- methylations of the viral mRNA cap are key events for the viral infection. Indeed reverse genetic experiments revealed first that the N7- methylation of cap structures is essential for the synthesis of viral proteins (Case et al., 2016). This observation is corroborated by former biochemical data showing that the N7-methyl guanosine of cap structures is recognized by the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E) and participates in the initiation of viral mRNA translation into proteins (Case et al., 2016, Cougot et al., 2004). Accordingly, inhibitors blocking nsp14 N7-MTase activity have been identified by yeast based screening assay on SARS-CoV, and induced a potent antiviral effect demonstrating that nsp14 MTase activity is an attractive antiviral target (Sun et al., 2014). Whereas N7-MTase mutants are replication defective, 2\u2032O-MTase mutants show limited effect on virus replication in cell culture but have an attenuated phenotype in animal models (Li et al., 2013, Menachery et al., 2014, Zhang et al., 2014, Z\u00fcst et al., 2013). The molecular basis of this attenuated phenotype was recently elucidated: incompletely-capped RNAs have been shown to be recognized by immune sensors such as RIG-I and MDA-5, which trigger innate immunity pathways (Decroly et al., 2012, Schuberth-Wagner et al., 2015, Wu et al., 2013). In turn, RIG-I or MDA-5 induces signalling cascades yielding to the expression of cytokines and type I interferon inducing an antiviral state in neighboring cells. Among the interferon-stimulated gens (ISG), IFIT1 also participates to the restriction of viral replication by sequestrating mis-capped viral RNAs (Pichlmair et al., 2011). Thus cap structure is now considered as a kind of \u201cmarker of self\u201d and it is currently admitted that 2\u2032O-MTase inhibitors might help virus clearance by stimulation of the immune response (Decroly et al., 2012, Ferron et al., 2012, Z\u00fcst et al., 2011).",

The principle of the HTRF assay, shown in Fig. S2, is to follow the MTase activity by indirectly detecting SAH, the by-product of the methyl transfer reaction. Indeed, in the detection system, the released SAH competes with fluorescent SAH-d2, which binds to an anti-SAH antibody coupled to a cryptate fluorophore (see Material and Methods). Thus, increase of SAH leads to decrease of the HTRF signal (Fig. S3D). The experimental conditions for the enzymatic assay were optimized and adapted for automated screening assay. Briefly, I) the enzyme concentration was set up at 5 nM of nsp14 as titration curves indicated that 80% of the maximal activity after 20 min incubation period is obtained at this enzyme concentration (Fig. S3A); II) GpppA substrate concentration was adjusted at 8 \u03bcM to robustly and reproducibly detect N7-MTase activity (Fig. S3B); III) SAM concentration was adjusted to 2 \u03bcM in order to ensure the optimal conversion rate of SAM to SAH according to the manufacture recommendations (\u22484\u201311%, Fig. S3C/D).

Table 2 also reveals that sinefungin (used as positive control) and compound 1040 exhibit a broad spectrum MTase inhibition profile with no inhibition detected on the RdRp activity of DENV NS5. This broad-spectrum inhibition observed with sinefungin has already been reported and can be related to its structural homology with the SAM/SAH (Dong et al., 2010). Interestingly, compound 792 inhibits mainly the CoV N7- and 2\u2032O-MTase as well as the hRNMT but barely interferes with DENV-3 or WNV NS5 MTase activity.

Methylations of viral mRNA cap structures are an essential step in the virus life-cycle (Case et al., 2016, Cougot et al., 2004) preventing their identification as foreign RNA markers by the host cell (Diamond, 2014, Li et al., 2013, Z\u00fcst et al., 2013). Thus, enzymes such as MTases involved in viral RNA capping are now considered as promising antiviral targets (Ferron et al., 2012). Here, we developed a high-throughput MTase screening assay based on HTRF technology that possesses advantageous features. The HTRF assay allows the minimization of non-specific fluorescence emissions by introducing a time delay (50\u2013150 \u03bcs) between the initial light excitation and fluorescence measurement (Degorce et al., 2009). This time delay limits the interference of fluorescent compounds in the screening assay. Indeed, only 37 out of 2000 compounds interfered with the detection system among which were considered as 17 false positive. In addition, a non-fluorescent enzymatic assay (FBA) was used to confirm the hits obtained from the primary screening. The initial screening was performed using a commercial cap analogue substrate (GpppA), as the availability of high amount of capped RNA substrates is a limiting step. This screening allowed the identification of 20 compounds inhibiting at least 42% of the nsp14 N7-MTase activity. The inhibitory effect (below 25 \u03bcM, Table 3) of 11 of these compounds was confirmed using a radioactive filter-binding assay performed with longer synthetic RNA substrates (GpppAC4). In contrast, 9 compounds barely inhibited the MTase activity measured with GpppAC4 substrate. Thus, it is likely that the use of GpppA as substrate may favor the identification of inhibitors that would be less efficient on longer RNA substrates. The weaker inhibition effect observed using longer RNA substrates might suggest that these compounds interfere with the RNA binding site of the enzyme.",

In addition, we also tested these compounds on the Dengue virus polymerase in order to control the inhibition specificity on the RdRp activity and eliminate molecules showing unspecific inhibition or frequent hitters.

However, we would like to propose that the inhibitors identified here might well be substrate mimicks and bind to conserved substrate pockets since the protein folding of hRNMT and nsp14 are significantly different, the latter deviating from classical Rossman-fold MTases. It is also noteworthy that this work was performed with a highly active truncated construct of hRNMT, which is used at very low concentration (20 nM) for IC50 determination. Additionally, it is also possible that as our truncated hRNMT is less selective as it lacks the hRNMT activating Miniprotein (RAM) binding domain and the RAM protein. Indeed it was previously demonstrated that RAM stabilizes the structure and positioning of the hRNMT lobe and increases the specific recruitment of SAM (Varshney et al., 2016). This high inhibition of hRNMT MTase activity may be overcome in the presence of its allosteric activator RAM, which may allow to stringent the specificity of the compounds.",

            "text": "Out of nsp14, the comparative screening using various MTases also reveals that several compounds show a large spectrum of MTase inhibition without any significant activity detected on the Dengue virus polymerase used as a control (compounds 1040 and the positive control sinefungin). The pleiotropic inhibition observed on MTases activities suggests that despite the weak primary sequence conservation, these enzymes do have a common structural organization (Rosmann fold characteristic of most of viral and cellular MTases) and share similar enzymatic properties. This observation is consistent with the common structural organization, with a conserved SAM, RNA and/or cap binding sites, shared by those MTases. The identification of broad-spectrum viral MTases inhibitors may offer a starting point to develop new antiviral compounds. We considered that these molecules could be interesting as we expected that the SAR process will give the opportunity to increase both specificity and inhibition properties. Accordingly, a SAR study previously performed on the flavivirus MTases has demonstrated that chemical analogs of SAH, showed improved activity and selectivity against DENV MTase, but not on the related human enzymes (Lim et al., 2011). The crystal structure revealed that the most active SAH derivative harbors substitutions accommodated in a specific cavity conserved in Flaviviral MTases. It would be thus relevant to initiate the structural analysis of viral MTases in complex with the best compounds in order to improve selectivity.",

Thus it is currently accepted that MTase inhibitors might help virus clearance by stimulation of the immune response (Decroly et al., 2012, Ferron et al., 2012, Z\u00fcst et al., 2011). In this work we identified 20 molecules inhibiting the N7-MTase activity of SARS-CoV nsp14 from chemical libraries composed of 2000 compounds using an HTRF based inhibition assay. Eleven compounds demonstrated a potent inhibition (>80%) at 50 \u03bcM concentration using the radioactive assay. The specificity of each compound was further evaluated using a radioactive assay on CoV 2\u2032O-MTase (nsp10/nsp16) and the MTases of Dengue and West-Nile viruses as well as the human RNA N7-MTase (hRNMT) involved in the capping of cellular RNAs. This comparative analysis revealed that the selected compounds cluster in 3 classes: 1) barely specific inhibitors, 2) pan-MTases inhibitors inhibiting viral and cellular MTases, 3) inhibitors targeting more specifically one viral MTase but also active against the hRNMT. These latter series of inhibitors may represent a good starting point for the development of antivirals targeting the CoV MTases.",
