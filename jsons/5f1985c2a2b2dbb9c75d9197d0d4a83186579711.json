The present study evaluated two kinds of vaccine adjuvants for use with recombinant S protein: gold nanoparticles (AuNPs), which are expected to function as both an antigen carrier and an adjuvant in immunization; and Tolllike receptor (TLR) agonists, which have previously been shown to be an effective adjuvant in an ultraviolet-inactivated SARS-CoV vaccine.

Currently, no vaccines or therapeutics are licensed for use against these coronaviruses. The spike (S) protein of coronaviruses binds to cellular receptors and mediates membrane fusion for cell entry. [10] [11] [12] Antibodies against S protein can block virus binding and fusion, and neutralize virus infection. [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] Thus, the S protein is a candidate vaccine target for blocking coronavirus infection. 11, [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] However, some animal studies have suggested that insufficient protective immunity against SARS-CoV may induce an eosinophilic immunopathology in the lungs after the infection. [27] [28] [29] Enhanced lung eosinophilic immunopathology became a problem in the 1960s, when a formalininactivated respiratory syncytial virus (FI-RSV) vaccine combined with alum adjuvant was injected intramuscularly into children to immunize them against RSV. [30] [31] [32] This outcome resulted in increased mortality due to enhanced respiratory disease upon subsequent RSV infection in immunized children. This increased mortality is thought to be due to a skewing of the immune response toward a Th2 response with enhanced eosinophil infiltration. In addition, the production of nonprotective antibodies in response to the FI-RSV vaccine may have been due to poor Toll-like receptor (TLR) stimulation. 33 In a previous study, we showed that a UVinactivated SARS-CoV vaccine induced a strong Th2skewed immune response and that TLR agonists could limit the development of a lung eosinophilic immunopathology. 34 In this study, we produced a recombinant tagged protein containing the ectodomain of the SARS-CoV S protein via a baculovirus expression system. We then evaluated the efficacy of the vaccine and its potential to induce a lung eosinophilic immunopathology in our murine SARS model. 35 The recombinant S proteininduced antibodies protected against SARS-CoV infection; however, a lung eosinophilic immunopathology was observed in the lungs of immunized mice after SARS infection. Thus, even with the S protein vaccine, an adjuvant is required to prevent lung eosinophilic immunopathology following SARS-CoV infection.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 57, "end": 60, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 61, "end": 64, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 65, "end": 68, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 69, "end": 72, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 73, "end": 76, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 77, "end": 80, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 141, "end": 144, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 145, "end": 148, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 149, "end": 152, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 388, "end": 392, "text": "[10]", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 393, "end": 397, "text": "[11]", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 398, "end": 402, "text": "[12]", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 500, "end": 504, "text": "[13]", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 505, "end": 509, "text": "[14]", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 510, "end": 514, "text": "[15]", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 515, "end": 519, "text": "[16]", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 520, "end": 524, "text": "[17]", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 525, "end": 529, "text": "[18]", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 616, "end": 619, "text": "11,", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 620, "end": 624, "text": "[18]", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 625, "end": 629, "text": "[19]", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 630, "end": 634, "text": "[20]", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 635, "end": 639, "text": "[21]", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 640, "end": 644, "text": "[22]", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 645, "end": 649, "text": "[23]", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 650, "end": 654, "text": "[24]", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 655, "end": 659, "text": "[25]", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 660, "end": 664, "text": "[26]", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 841, "end": 845, "text": "[27]", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 846, "end": 850, "text": "[28]", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 851, "end": 855, "text": "[29]", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 1103, "end": 1107, "text": "[30]", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 1108, "end": 1112, "text": "[31]", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 1113, "end": 1117, "text": "[32]", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}, {"start": 1549, "end": 1551, "text": "33", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}, {"start": 1754, "end": 1756, "text": "34", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 2038, "end": 2040, "text": "35", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "| INTRODUCTION"}, {"text": "Nanoparticle-based vaccines have been expected to improve vaccine efficacy, immunization strategies, and targeted delivery to promote immune responses.

One explanation for the failure to induce protective immune responses could be that structural changes in S protein upon binding to the AuNP adjuvant resulted in S-binding IgGs that were unable to neutralize the virus. 58 AuNPs and S protein bind together via electrostatic interactions and S-protein forms a \"protein corona\" around AuNPs. 59, 60 Indeed, both the DLS and TEM structure analysis indicated that the conjugated S protein on AuNPs formed a protein corona, which is considered to result in structural changes in adsorbed proteins 59 for adaptation to the nanoparticle surface and surrounding environment. 61 The protein secondary structure is strongly affected by the surface charge of AuNPs. 62 The particle surface of a protein corona defines the biological identity of the particle when it is attached to the cell surface in vivo. 58, 59 Thus, even a small modification in S protein structure could impact both negatively and positively on its immunogenicity. More work will be required to study the mechanisms and to test whether the AuNP-adjuvanted vaccine is effective against coronavirus infection (i.e., effect of antigen binding methods, antigen against the receptor binding site).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 155, "end": 158, "text": "36,", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}, {"start": 159, "end": 162, "text": "39,", "ref_id": "BIBREF38"}, {"start": 163, "end": 165, "text": "40", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}, {"start": 1546, "end": 1548, "text": "40", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}, {"start": 1791, "end": 1793, "text": "39", "ref_id": "BIBREF38"}, {"start": 2231, "end": 2233, "text": "58", "ref_id": "BIBREF57"}, {"start": 2352, "end": 2355, "text": "59,", "ref_id": "BIBREF58"}, {"start": 2356, "end": 2358, "text": "60", "ref_id": "BIBREF59"}, {"start": 2629, "end": 2631, "text": "61", "ref_id": "BIBREF60"}, {"start": 2717, "end": 2719, "text": "62", "ref_id": "BIBREF61"}, {"start": 2858, "end": 2861, "text": "58,", "ref_id": "BIBREF57"}, {"start": 2862, "end": 2864, "text": "59", "ref_id": "BIBREF58"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 352, "end": 360, "text": "Figure 5", "ref_id": "FIGREF3"}], "section": "| DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "Cytokine and chemokine analysis revealed that each group of mice had different lung immune responses early after SARS-CoV infection.
