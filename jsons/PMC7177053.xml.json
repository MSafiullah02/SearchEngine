Large-scale screening programs using antibody tests are currently under evaluation by different governments. Recently, a test for the rapid detection of combined IgG and IgM antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 in human blood, serum/plasma has become available.6 As soon as the kits were commercially available, we assessed the reliability and usefulness of the 2019-nCoV IgG/IgM Antibody Rapid Test Kit (Beijing Diagreat Biotechnologies Co., Ltd) in patients with confirmed Covid 19 and in a small sample of patients with suspected disease, who were screened to be admitted to either a Covid 19 Unit or to a non Covid 19 ward.",
