These indices can be retrieved for selected geographic areas or at the worldwide scale. The interpretation of GT indices is straightforward: the higher the value of a given GT index, the greater the public attention for that topic. In recent years, the informational content of Google Trends data has shown to have explanatory and forecasting power in several fields of economics and finance. In relation to financial markets, GT indices based on stock-related terms: (i) lead to a higher portfolio diversification with respect to the market benchmark [9] , and (ii) can be used as sentiments [5] and early warning market signals [2, 4] . On the macroeconomic side, GT indices have been used to construct economic uncertainty indicators able to explain several macroeconomic variables [6, 3, 7] . GT data has also been successfully used for disease surveillance purposes for MERS [11] , Chicken-Pox [1] and Flu [12] .",

We use them as proxies for country-level public concern and investigate their impact on the financial markets during the outbreak of the coronavirus disease. The COVID-19 pandemic is an interesting case to investigate since, due to its virulence and infectivity, it represents a major exogenous shock to the economic and financial system, which could not have been reasonably foreseen. In our analysis, we consider the six most impacted countries worldwide in terms of confirmed cases, as of May the 1st 2020: the United States, Spain, Italy, Great Britain, Germany and France. Our findings are three-fold. First, the GT-COVID-19 index for Italy is found to be a driver of the GT indices for all the countries considered. This lead-lag relationship is primarily due to the fact that Italy has been the first European country to experience an outbreak of COVID-19 and to implement lock-down measures since World War II. In addition, several European governments have introduced travel restrictions from and to Italy during the first weeks of the outbreak. The ensuing spread of the coronavirus disease in other countries provided a similar dynamic on the new cases and for the implemented lock-down measures. Therefore, the delayed reaction of those indexes is probably due to the twist of the aforementioned events. Second, we analyse if GT-COVID-19 indices explain the stock market returns. Given that an epidemic disease is by definition an adverse event, GT indices can be interpreted as a measure of coronavirus-related uncertainty and perceived risk.",

The country-specific GT series have a common dynamic, whereas for each source there is cross-country heterogeneity. We remark that high values of either GT index correspond to intervals which exhibit turbulent dynamics for financial returns. This is particularly evident throughout March. Moreover, we notice that the Italian GT indices (for each source) anticipate those of the other countries. To test for the presence of lead-lag relations, we perform a cross-correlation analysis of each series against Italy. Table 2 reports the peak in the cross correlation, where negative values implying that the series for Italy is leading. By looking at the beginning of the period, we observe that both the GT indices and the financial series do not appear to react to epidemicsrelated facts originated in China. Overall, these findings corroborate the interpretation that public concern has cross-country similarities, with Italy acting as the forerunner. ",

The impact of all GT indices drops to negative values the same day of key events related to COVID-19. In particular, the lowest peaks occur in correspondence of the enactment of the Italian lock-downs. Moreover, before the first confirmed case in Europe (23 January) all the coefficients are very close to zero. This signals that the GT indices had no explanatory power prior to the spreading of the pandemic to Europe, even though the presence of COVID-19 in China was already known since the end of December 2019.",
