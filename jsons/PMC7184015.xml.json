A total of 293 patients presented to ED (about 35% of the normal numbers seen in ED in a typical week). There was a rise in traumatic ocular injuries occurring at home (Total 23 during this week in comparison to 10 a week in 2019) Twelve patients had injuries during gardening, eight patients doing DIY/home improvement projects and three through exercise at home through skipping rope and resistance elastic bands injuries. The majority of these injuries resulted in corneal abrasions. However, there was one case of hyphaema, one chemical injury and one full thickness lid laceration.",

Further clear guidance should also be issued to raise awareness of the potential ocular injuries which can occur at home. Finally, it is important for patients to seek professional ophthalmology advice regarding ocular symptoms in a prompt manner despite COVID-19 to avoid more serious problems.",
