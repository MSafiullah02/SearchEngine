After the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome in 2003 and, more recently, outbreaks of dengue, chikungunya, and Zika virus, Singapore has developed innovative technologies to control mosquito populations with wolbachia bacteria4 and affordable, easy-to-use mosquito traps called Gravitraps. Singapore has also been very successful in raising awareness and engaging the public through campaigns such as the so-called Mozzie Wipeout Campaign and the Dengue Community Alert System.",

Singapore is often regarded to be a leading example of successful implementation and enforcement of the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control, an international legal treaty to curb use of tobacco globally. Singapore has implemented important policy innovations in raising prices or taxes of tobacco products, in tobacco packaging and labelling, and in strictly enforcing bans on promotion, advertising, and sponsorship of tobacco. Further, Singapore will reduce illicit trade of cigarettes and sales to minors by gradually increasing the legal age for tobacco sale from ages 18 to 21 between 2019 and 2021.",

WHO and UNICEF estimate that 2\u00b71 billion people, mostly in developing countries, have no safe water at home. In this regard, Singapore's pioneering and highly successful NEWater5 is a world leader in technology to produce high-grade, clean, and potable reclaimed water from treated used water.",

How could it do this? Singapore could, for example, establish a Singapore International Development Agency, akin to the UK's Department for International Development, that would be tasked with spreading and sharing Singapore-led innovations to help countries in the region to solve their health problems. Improving the health of its neighbours will also clearly benefit Singapore in the longer term. To paraphrase John F Kennedy, it is time for Singapore to ask not what Singapore can do for itself but ask how the rest of the world can learn and benefit from Singapore.",
