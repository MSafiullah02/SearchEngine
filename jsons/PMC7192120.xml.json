COVID-19 is extremely contagious and characterized by respiratory diseases though clinically complex [3]. Nearly half of COVID-19 patients get dyspnea after infection for one week, and the critical patients will rapidly develop an acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) [4]. Therefore, mechanically assisted ventilation, which can considerably improve the critical patients' respiratory efficiency, becomes an imperative means in the therapy. In addition, the critical patients are generally anxious and fearful [5,6] and thus large-dose sedatives, analgesics and even muscle relaxants are requisite. Hence, both assisted ventilation and proper psychological therapy are essential for these patients. In this report, a case of a critical COVID-19 patient who was initially subjected to mechanical ventilation and then to psychological and rehabilitative treatments and was finally ventilator-weaned is elaborated as follows.",

Her clinical syndromes include cough, expectoration with a small amount of sticky sputum, and slight nasal congestion and rhinorrhea, but without fatigue, headache, nausea, vomiting, celialgia, diarrhea or muscle soreness. Two days later, she was admitted to \u00d7\u00d7\u00d7 Hospital, and the chest tests suggest a pulmonary infection; thus, a nucleic acid test of the pharynx swab for coronavirus 2019-nCoV was subsequently conducted in the centers for disease control (CDC). The positive result prompts the transfer to \u00d7\u00d7\u00d7 Hospital on January 28 for further treatments.

(1) This patient progressively got stressed and depressed, based on a psychological assessment, as a result of comparatively overlong administration of sedatives; (1) pulmonary symptoms were undiminished yet, e.g., consolidation of the pulmonary lower parts was rather evident and an air bronchogram was observable, as indicated from the CT pictures (Fig. 3); and (3) the patient lacked physical exercises due to long-term lying down on the bed. Accordingly, the corresponding countermeasures were implemented. For example, extra addition of anti-anxiety medicine (e.g., flupentixol and melitracen tablets), continuous psychological counseling from psychologists, sedative discontinuation since February 2, discharging sputum assisted with mechanical vibration and percussion on the back), enhancement of exercise (including exercises for respiratory and limb muscles), et cetera.

(1) Respiratory airway care should be intensified. This patient is obese, and her thorax activities are thus restricted; more importantly, the chest CT on February 17 shows consolidation in the pulmonary lower parts but an obvious air bronchogram, suggesting that the respiratory airway might be blocked; furthermore, this hypothesis is consistent with the autopsy report [8] that a plethora of sticky secretions overflows from the alveoli in the pulmonary transection and some fibrous stripes are visible; in addition, the radiographically ground-glass opacity is compatible with the anatomically pulmonary gray-white lesions [8], implying that COVID-19 causes the inflammatory reactions featured mainly by damage in the deep airway and pulmonary alveoli. Hence, it is exceedingly critical to widen the congested respiratory airway in the later therapeutic processes to promote the expectoration of mucus. (2) Attention to the patient's psychological and physical rehabilitation in the later phase should also be paid. The COVID-19 patients are per se scared of the disease, and moreover, long-term high-dose use of sedative and analgesic medicine readily leads to delirium and restlessness once discontinuation; therefore, psychotropic drugs (e.g., alprazolam, flupentixol and melitracen tablets) should also be administrated besides bolstering psychological comfort. Additionally, the muscle disuse atrophy syndrome will readily appear if patients are bedridden for a long time, and thus timely rehabilitations, whether passive or active, can enhance their confidence and further increase the possibility of smoothly weaning the ventilator.",
