Once consent and assent were obtained, participants completed a clinical questionnaire, spirometry, and Feno measurement and had a nasal swab obtained for viral PCR (visit 2). Urgent care physicians independently directed treatment and determined the participants' dispositions. The treating physicians were not study investigators and the decision to treat with prednisone was at the discretion of the treating physician using treatment algorithms based on the National Asthma Education and Prevention Program guidelines.16 Participants who were discharged home were instructed to continue usual controller medications, to take albuterol at a frequency directed by the urgent care physician, and to complete a 5- to 7-day course of oral prednisone (2 mg/kg/d; maximum daily dose 60 mg). All discharged participants were also scheduled for follow-up 1 week later (visit 3). At the follow-up visit, all participants underwent spirometry and had Feno levels measured.",

The combination of vellum closure and low flow rate ensures accurate measurement of pulmonary-derived exhaled NO levels and excludes contamination from nasal NO. Participants exhale to their residual volume, insert the mouthpiece, inhale to total lung capacity, and then exhale for 10 seconds at a steady rate of 50 mL/s. Visual incentives provide feedback for flow rate compliance. The end point of measurement occurred when a plateau for 4 seconds was observed. Only 1 measurement was obtained because the repeatability of Feno obtained with the Niox Mino is very high.20\n",

The interaction was the main predictor of interest in the models, and was kept in the model even if it was not statistically significant to allow for model flexibility. Covariates of interest for adjusted models were season (winter, spring, summer, and fall) and inhaled GC therapy (yes/no), and also sex, weight, height, and race (Hispanic, African American, or Caucasian) for the adjusted Feno model. Backwards selection using a P-value cutoff of .15 was used to remove insignificant covariates. Final adjusted models included season as a covariate. In addition, the adjusted Feno model contained age and race (Hispanic, African American, or Caucasian) as covariates. All models contained a random intercept.

Limitations of this study included the small number of children studied and the lack of preexacerbation Feno levels. Kwok et al,14 using a tidal breathing technique to assess Feno levels in children presenting to the ED with an asthma exacerbation, found that only 68% of the children were able to successfully perform the maneuver. Of those who were able to provide an adequate sample, no differences were found in Feno levels among those with mild, moderate, and severe exacerbations. This study was limited by the technique used to measure Feno levels and the lack of baseline Feno levels. Nelson et al15 sought to determine whether Feno levels at the time of an ED visit could predict children requiring hospitalization for acute asthma and found that Feno levels could not distinguish children requiring hospitalization from those who were discharged to home.

We found Feno levels to be the highest in children with acute asthma exacerbations that were not associated with viral infections [PCR(\u2212)]. In this group of children, the exacerbation was likely allergen-driven. In this situation, the offending allergen triggers both immediate and late-phase allergic responses, leading to bronchoconstriction and airway edema as a consequence of preformed mediators of inflammation and the influx of eosinophils. Because Feno levels serve as a surrogate for eosinophilic inflammation,6, 7, 8, 9 elevated Feno levels likely represent an influx of eosinophils and eosinophil-derived airway epithelial damage.",

Unlike respiratory syncytial virus and influenza virus, rhinovirus is unique in that infection in those with asthma results in increased Feno levels31, 32, 33 by way of increased inducible nitric oxide synthase expression in airway epithelial cells.34 Indeed, when children with viral-associated exacerbations caused by rhinovirus were excluded from those with other respiratory viruses, Feno levels were not elevated.",

Viral-induced damage to the airway epithelium can lead to enhanced absorption of allergens, resulting in worsening airway inflammation. Likewise, damage of the airway epithelium from allergic inflammation may promote viral replication and more severe clinical illness.29 Thus, in our children with PCR (+) asthma exacerbations, there is likely to be a mixture of both eosinophilic and neutrophilic inflammation, which results in the moderate elevation in Feno levels we noted. In contrast, the inflammation underlying PCR (\u2212) exacerbations is more likely to be a purely eosinophil-driven process and as a result, Feno levels would be expected to be higher.",

First, from a methodological standpoint, it would have been preferable to perform Feno measurements before spirometry because spirometry can result in a transient reduction in Feno levels. Past studies have shown the reduction to be modest (2 ppb or <10%)35 and unlikely to have significantly altered our results. Second, we did not inquire as to whether our patients had recently ingested foods containing high levels of nitrates, or whether they were exposed to household cigarette smoke or were currently smoking cigarettes. Ingestion of foods containing high levels of nitrates can cause the Feno level to be elevated for up to 15 hours,36 while current cigarette smoking can reduce the Feno levels by 60%.37 In addition, we reported the FEV1/FVC ratio as a percentage, as opposed to the FEV1/FVC percent predicted. Because the ratio varies with age and sex, using percentage only misses this information and can give a false sense of abnormalities. Another limitation is that we were unable to identify the triggering agent(s) involved in the acute exacerbation in the PCR (\u2212) group. It is possible that these subjects were reacting to inhaled seasonal allergens or newly acquired perennial allergens such as cat or dog dander. Alternatively, some of our patients may have had a falsely negative PCR result. Last, although we speculate that PCR (\u2212) exacerbations were likely eosinophil driven, we did not perform sputum induction or collect peripheral blood to assess for eosinophilia.",
