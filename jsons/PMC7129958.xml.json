            "text": "A new respiratory virus, human metapneumovirus (hMPV), has been recently isolated from nasopharyngeal aspirates of young children in the Netherlands (van den Hoogen et al., 2001). hMPV is the first human respiratory pathogen classified as a member of the Metapneumovirus genus, which together with Pneumoviruses constitute the Pneumovirinae subfamily within the Paramyxoviridae family (van den Hoogen et al., 2001, Boivin et al., 2002, Viazov et al., 2003). The clinical symptoms of the children from which the virus was isolated ranged from upper respiratory airway disease to severe bronchiolitis and pneumonia (van den Hoogen et al., 2001). Subsequent studies established the association of this virus with acute RTIs in all age groups (Maggi et al., 2003, Osterhaus and Fouchier, 2003, Boivin et al., 2003, Vicente et al., 2003, Stockton et al., 2002, Boivin et al., 2002, Peiris et al., 2003, Freymouth et al., 2003). However, several epidemiological as well as clinical aspects of hMPV infection are still to be firmly established and in this context the analysis of well defined respiratory disease cohorts is of particular importance (Jartti et al., 2002, Rawlinson et al., 2003).",

Primers (upper MPVNF: 5\u2032 AGGCCCTCAGCACCAGACA3\u2032; lower MPVNR: 5\u2032TTGACCGGCCCCATAAGC3\u2032) were designed against the N (nucleocapsid) region of the 00-1 isolate of hMPV (Genbank accession Nr. AF371337.2) to amplify a 318 bp fragment corresponding to nucleotides 505\u2013822 of the published hMPV genome (van den Hoogen et al., 2001). PCR reaction was conducted in the presence of 2.5 mM MgCl2, 400 \u03bcM dNTPs, 0.25 \u03bcM of each MPV primer and 2.5 units Taq polymerase (Invitrogen) for 40 cycles of 94 \u00b0C for 40 s, 55 \u00b0C for 40 s and 72 \u00b0C for 1 min. Subsequently, 20% of the PCR reaction volume was run in a 1.8% agarose gel and, when present, 318 bp amplicons were excised and further purified with the Concert Rapid Gel Extraction System kit (GibcoBRL), according to the manufacturers\u2019 instructions. Selected samples were vacuum dried and sequenced using the MWG AG Biotech (Ebersberg, Germany) sequencing facilities. Comparison of the sequenced fragments to the hMPV genome was done by submission to the Genbank using the standard nucleotide-nucleotide BLAST (blastn), whereas comparison between individual amplicons was conducted using blast2.",

Similarly, Viazov et al. (2003) detected hMPV in 17.5% (and RSV in 23.8%) of young children with respiratory tract illness, with most the cases diagnosed as bronchiolitis (Viazov et al., 2003).
