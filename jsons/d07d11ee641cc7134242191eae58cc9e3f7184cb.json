            "text": "Hong Kong's wet markets play a crucial role in the country's supply of safe, fresh meat to satisfy the dietary needs of its population. Whilst food safety regulations have been introduced over the past few years to maintain the microbial safety of foods sold from these wet markets, it remains unclear whether the hygiene maintenance that is performed on the wooden cutting boards used for meat-processing is effective. In fact, hygiene maintenance may often be overlooked, and hygiene standards may be insufficient. If so, this may lead to the spread of harmful pathogens through cross-contamination, thereby causing severe risks to public health. The aim of this study was to determine the level of microbial transfer between wooden cutting boards and swine meat of various qualities, using 16S metagenomic sequencing, strain identification and biofilm screening of isolated strains. The results established that: (a) the traditional hygiene practices used for cleaning wooden cutting boards in Hong Kong's wet markets expose the surfaces to potentially harmful microorganisms; (b) the processing of microbially contaminated meat on cutting boards cleaned using traditional practices leads to cross-contamination; and (c) several potentially pathogenic microorganisms found on the cutting boards have good biofilm-forming abilities. These results reinforce the need to review the traditional methods used to clean wooden cutting boards after the processing of raw meat in Hong Kong' wet markets so as to prevent cross-contamination events. The establishment of proper hygiene protocols may reduce the spread of disease-causing microorganisms (including antibiotic-resistant microorganisms) in food-processing environments.",

The spread of Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis from poultry meat to cucumbers was assessed on different cutting board surfaces (wood, plastic, and glass) before and after washing of the surfaces. All of the tested strains were detected from unwashed cutting boards and cucumbers that had previously been cut and processed on such surfaces. The recovery of these strains on the cutting boards ranged between 10% to 100% following various washing routines, thus demonstrating the critical importance of correct hygiene practices for preventing the establishment of foodborne pathogens on food-preparation surfaces.",

To compare the biofilm-forming abilities of the selected individual strains, bacterial suspensions were first standardised by optical density measurements, and then 100 \u00b5L of each bacterial suspension was inoculated in TSB in a ratio of 1:100 in the individual wells of a 96-well plate, with four replicate wells created for each species. The screening of biofilms was conducted as outlined by O'Toole [26] . Briefly, after incubation, the suspended cells in each well were removed, and the wells were rinsed with distilled water. Thereafter, 125 \u00b5L of 0.1% crystal violet solution was added to the emptied wells to bind to biofilm-forming species present on the well walls. The crystal violet solution was then removed from the wells after 10 min, and a second rinse with distilled water was performed. Residual crystal violet was solubilized with 125 \u00b5L of 30% acetic acid solution, and the absorbance of solution in each well was measured at 550 nm. Control wells containing sterile TSB were treated by the same staining and rinsing procedure. The experiments were conducted in duplicate.",

Moreover, W. hellenica and L. garvieae remained the most prevalent bacterial contaminants on the cutting board after these cleaning routines (Supplementary Figure S2) . One study reported that microbial contaminants on a wooden cutting board can be removed by vigorous washing and rinsing routines [8] . Nevertheless, some microbial species could still be present on the cutting board after such treatment because diverse microbial communities colonize the porous surfaces of wooden cutting boards and usually form resilient and hazardous biofilms. The abundance of these phyla may be attributable to the ubiquity of microorganisms belonging to these groups and to the resistance of some bacterial species to antibacterial treatments, particularly endospore-forming bacteria of the phylum Firmicutes [27, 28] . The increased prevalence of Firmicutes may also increase the likelihood of cutting boards being exposed to pathogenic species of this phylum.",

However, its presence on the cutting board was surprising because it is usually associated with sexually transmitted zoonotic infections [35, 36] . This finding also suggest that cross-contamination had occurred via human vectors attributable to the high daily traffic of customers buying meat products and simultaneously spreading various pathogenic species. Furthermore, the proximity of wet markets to nearby clinics and hospitals might have also contributed to the transfer of these microorganisms, as shown in other related studies [4, 35, 36] . The above mentioned bacterial species were also identified in other food processing studies and were reported to be the primary cause of various foodborne illnesses [37] [38] [39] . Further epidemiological surveys would help validate the presence of such pathogens on wet market wooden cutting boards. The detection of pathogenic species on the wooden cutting board surfaces even after it was subjected to traditional cleaning practices is worrisome, as it indicates that such cutting boards may contribute to the spread of disease-causing illnesses in Hong Kong, as mentioned earlier. Therefore, these ineffective hygienic methods need to be critically reviewed, and proper hygienic practices must be urgently implemented to guarantee the food safety of meat sold in the wet markets of Hong Kong.",

Typically, supermarkets also process their meat products using wooden cutting boards prior to packaging and storage, usually under controlled temperature and relative humidity conditions. In sharp contrast, the apparently unhygienic surface conditions of the wooden cutting boards in wet markets, in combination with Hong Kong's high ambient temperature and high relative humidity conditions, are conducive to pathogenic microbial proliferation on freely displayed meat products [4] . It has been reported that certain bacteria belonging to phylum Firmicutes can survive at low temperature [40, 41] . For example, some species belonging to this bacterial group have survival mechanisms to withstand harsh environmental conditions [42] , such as by producing endospores at low temperatures, which then remain dormant until conditions become favourable [43, 44] . Therefore, it is likely that these microorganisms were also present in the refrigerated meat samples before being processed on the wooden cutting board surface. Because of the aciduricity and ability of these microorganisms to use a wide range of nutrients, the detection of L. garvieae and W. hellenica was unsurprising, and these findings adds to the growing scientific evidence of the ubiquity of these species [45] [46] [47] . Similarly, the prevalence of Enterococcus faecalis in the unprocessed imported meat also highlights the complex pathogenic profile of the species inhabiting these meat products. E. faecalis is usually associated with nosocomial infections and has been reported as being one of the most challenging pathogens to treat due to its drug resistance [48, 49] .",

They found that most of the biofilm communities belonged to the phylum Firmicutes, with Bacillus, Staphylococcus, Acinetobacter and Kocuria being the dominant genera. These authors also observed that some of these bacterial species were resistant to certain types of disinfectants [55] , which implies that robust, well-validated hygiene regimes should be used for cleaning food processing environments. Weber et al. [56] studied the bacterial composition of biofilms in bovine milk and found that Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, and Bacteroidetes were the dominant phyla. In the phylum Actinobacteria, Rhodococcus, Dermacoccus, Gordonia, Kocuria and Microbacterium were the main genera. In the Firmicutes phylum, Bacillus, Lactococcus and Staphylococcus were the most prevalent genera. Acinetobacter was the most common genera in the phylum Proteobacteria, and Chryseobacterium was the most detected genera in the phylum Bacteroidetes. In another study, Sharma and Anand [57] examined the biofilms in milk processing pipelines and observed that the bacterial contaminants consisted mainly of Bacillus before and after the pasteurisation stages.",

Furthermore, understanding the ecology of microbial biofilms in food processing environments is essential to the establishment of effective sanitisation methods. Moreover, it should be noted that the presented findings in this study using TSB or TSA media only reflects a fraction of what could be identified and isolated from the wooden cutting board and meat samples. Therefore, future research should consider the use of other culture media to study the full scope of transferable bacteria between the wooden cutting boards and meat samples.",

This was achieved by using a variety of methods including traditional microbiological techniques and 16S and shotgun metagenomic sequencing methods. The results obtained from this study were alarming because diverse pathogenic species, including strains that are associated with clinical infections, were isolated from the wooden cutting board surfaces. It was also observed that the traditional hygiene methods were not effective in the eradication of microbial contaminants as hazardous biofilm-forming species were found on the cutting board surfaces. In addition, the porosity and hydrophilicity of the wooden cutting board surfaces, coupled with the warm and humid atmospheric conditions of Hong Kong, were also shown to favour the spread of disease-causing illnesses in food-processing environments in Hong Kong.",

To prevent the spread of foodborne pathogens in these markets, several strategies are proposed in this study. First, the wet market vendors must be educated about proper hygiene methods that they should use to reduce the spread of pathogens in their food-processing environments. Second, food safety authorities should regularly monitor these wet markets to guarantee the safety of meat sold to consumers. Lastly, more studies should be conducted to understand the sources of some of the pathogenic species isolated in this study, especially those related to nosocomial infections.",
