            "text": "Memory has a great impact on the evolution of every process related to human societies. Among them, the evolution of an epidemic is directly related to the individuals' experiences. Indeed, any real epidemic process is clearly sustained by a non-Markovian dynamics: memory effects play an essential role in the spreading of diseases. Including memory effects in the susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) epidemic model seems very appropriate for such an investigation. Thus, the memory prone SIR model dynamics is investigated using fractional derivatives. The decay of long-range memory, taken as a power-law function, is directly controlled by the order of the fractional derivatives in the corresponding nonlinear fractional differential evolution equations. Here we assume \"fully mixed\" approximation and show that the epidemic threshold is shifted to higher values than those for the memoryless system, depending on this memory \"length\" decay exponent. We also consider the SIR model on structured networks and study the effect of topology on threshold points in a non-Markovian dynamics. Furthermore, the lack of access to the precise information about the initial conditions or the past events plays a very relevant role in the correct estimation or prediction of the epidemic evolution. Such a \"constraint\" is analyzed and discussed.",

Mathematical models of infectious diseases have been developed in order to integrate realistic aspects of disease spreading [2] [3] [4] [5] . A simple and commonly studied model, introduced by Kermack and McKendrick, is the susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) model [6] . In this model, populations can be in each of three states: susceptible, infected, and recovered (removed), denoted by S, I, and R, respectively. Originally, it is assumed that susceptible individuals become infected with a rate proportional to the fraction of infected individuals in the overall population (fully mixed approximation) and infected individuals recover at a constant rate. The epidemic process presents a (percolation) transition between a phase, in which the disease outbreak reaches a finite fraction of the population, and a phase with only a limited number of infected individuals [7, 8] . The model has also been investigated for population on lattices (e.g., [9] [10] [11] ) or on networks (e.g., [12] [13] [14] ).",

Hence the state of system at each time does not depend on the previous history of the system: it is a memoryless, so-called Markovian, process. However, real surveys show evidence of a non-Markovian spreading process [25, 26] in agreement with common expectation. The epidemic processes evolution and control, in human societies, cannot be considered without any memory effect. When a disease spreads within a human population, the experience or knowledge of individuals about that disease should affect their response [5] . If people know about the history of a certain disease in the area where they live, they use different precautions, such as vaccination, when possible. Thus, some endogenous controlled suppression of the spreading is expected, although other factors can help [27] [28] [29] . However, knowledge about the history of a disease does not have the same influence at all times. Experience about the prevalence of a disease and precautions related to the \"old times\" are not always applicable or recommended, hence people tend to follow new strategies against the diseases. In other words, memory of the earlier times could have less effect on the present situation, as compared to more recent times. It can be expected that long-range memory effects decay in time more slowly than an exponential decay, but can typically behave like a power-law damping function.",

Furthermore, in this work we focus on long-range memory effects, which means arbitrarily long history can be included. That is in contrast to short-term memory effects, which have been extensively studied. For instance, Dodds and Watts [37] introduced a general model of contagion considering memory of past exposures to a contagious influence. The authors have argued that their model can fall into one of three universal classes, due to the behavior of fixed point curves. Also, in [38] [39] [40] , the authors consider \"implicit memory\" by applying asynchronous adapting in disease propagation.

Typically, the evolution of epidemiological models is described with differential equations, the derivatives being of integer order. By replacing the ordinary time derivative by a fractional derivative, a time correlation function or memory kernel appears, thereby making the state of the system dependent on all past states. Thus, it seems that such a method based on derivatives with noninteger order, as introduced by Caputo for geophysics problems [51] , is a very proper formalism for such non-Markovian problems. Moreover, Caputo's formalism provides the advantage that it is not necessary to define the fractional order initial conditions, when solving such differential equations [51] [52] [53] [54] . Furthermore, the time correlation function, in the definition of Caputo fractional derivative, is a power-law function, which is flexible enough to reflect the fact that the contribution of more early states is noticeably less relevant than the contribution of more recent ones on the present state of the dynamical system.",

Let the process be continuing its evolution, but let the memory of the system be removed at that time. This corresponds to having a new initial time and new initial conditions for the epidemics spreading. The process can be continued without or with memory. The Markovian case is trivial thereafter and thus not discussed. Instead, consider that memory effects are only taken into account at this starting \"new initial time.\" In other words, let the population ignore the disease control history (memory) until t 1 ; let the system continue its dynamics but taking into account memory effects thereafter from t 1 . The initial conditions for the evolution of the system are now a fraction of susceptible and infected individuals at time t 1 . The curves with square symbols in Fig. 5 correspond to what happens for different \"new initial times\" t 1 = 30,70, for the dynamics of such a non-Markovian epidemic process. As can be seen, at the beginning of the dynamics, the fraction of susceptible individuals is reduced, since people do not know about the disease. However, as soon as it is influenced by memory, the system becomes more resilient to the spreading. Hence, the fraction of S individuals remains greater as compared to that with a memoryless system, having started at t = 0. In a similar manner, the fraction of infected and removed individuals deviate from the original one and tend toward the populated states of a memoryless system when the memory from further past times is included. In this case, the curves become closer to the dashed curve corresponding to a memoryless system. That means that the system loses the information related to past times and tends to present a behavior similar to a memoryless system. Finally, one can consider \"to remove the memory\" of an epidemic process at various times. At each time step, the system is supposed to lose (or practically negate) the information about the disease before some \"reawareness time\" (see also [68] ) and to continue its dynamics regardless of the past. For illustration, consider the case of such a sudden Notice that in this particular illustrative case, the behavior of the system is seen to be close to the dynamics of a memoryless system, since contributions of the memory of the system are sometimes removed. Such an illustration points to the interest of the model in order to compare it with the case of epidemics spreading waves [65] ; for completeness, let it be pointed out that the connection of periodic epidemics to SIR models has been already mentioned [69] : flu is yearly recurrent. Notice also that the value of \u03b1 could be modified at each new awareness time, but this investigation goes outside the present paper.",

However, in the real world an individual connects to a small fraction of people. Hence, as is well known, more realistic modeling can be studied through networks, where their topology has a significant effect on the epidemic process [70] [71] [72] . For homogeneous networks, each individual has the same number of connections k \u2248 k and disease propagates with spreading rate \u03b2 k . In this case, it is obvious that the epidemic threshold ( \u03b2 \u03b3 ) c is simply replaced by ( \u03b2 \u03b3 ) c k . It is also true for the case of fractional differential equations (4) . In other words, threshold point in Fig. 1 for each value of \u03b1 is shifted to ( \u03b2 \u03b3 ) c k . Now, let us consider heterogeneous scale-free networks with degree distribution P (k) \u223c k \u2212\u03bb . In heterogeneous meanfield approximation, it is assumed that all nodes are statistically equivalent and thus one can consider groups of nodes with the same degree k. With this assumption the ordinary differential equations describing the SIR model are given by where",

While for a memoryless SIR model (\u03b1 = 1), the system reaches a stationary state after a short time (t 20), the stationary time is increased with decreasing the value of \u03b1. Furthermore, we obtain the size of outbreaks at a finite time. Figure 7 shows 1 \u2212 S t , measured with accuracy 10 \u22125 until t = 100 for different values of \u03b1. As we can see, the epidemic threshold is always zero, as it is for Markov epidemic spreading on scale-free networks with \u03bb = 3. However, the size of epidemic decreases with decreasing \u03b1. The same results are obtained for networks with 2 < \u03bb < 3.

Here we have reported a study on the evolution of the SIR epidemic model, considering memory effects. Using the fractional calculus technique, we show that the dynamics of such a system depends on the strength of memory effects, controlled by the order of fractional derivatives \u03b1. At finite times, including memory effects, the epidemic threshold (\u03b2/\u03b3 ) c is shifted to higher values than those for memoryless systems, at values depending on the memory decay rate \u03b1. In the case that the model evolves on heterogeneous scale-free networks with 2 < \u03bb 3, the threshold point is always zero. However, the fraction of individuals who are infected or recovered, is reduced if the memory \"length\" increases. Hence, memory renders the system more robust against the disease spreading. If the epidemic process evolves further in time, for a fixed memory strength, (i) the disease can infect more individuals and (ii) the epidemic threshold is shifted to smaller values and tends to the memoryless case values.",

However, we guess that many qualitative behaviors as those presented here are likely to be quite generally found in reality. More advanced epidemic models, based on various types of complex networks, are surely interesting subjects for further investigations, in line with investigations such as, e.g., in [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] . We also wish to point out that we have observed qualitatively similar results for the SIS epidemic model. Finally, we may claim that our results are not limited to the epidemiological (\"medical\") models but also can be extended for analogous epidemic spreading of rumors, gossip, opinions, religions, and other topics pertinent to epidemics on many social networks.",

Here we compare the time scales in fractional-and integer-order dynamics. To image a geometric interpretation, let us consider the right-sided fractional integral of order \u03b1,and write it in the formwhereIf we compare Eq. (A2) with its counterpart x \u03b1 t = t 0 v(\u03c4 )d\u03c4 , in the homogeneous time scheme, the main difference is related to the different time variables T and \u03c4 . Notice that time variable T t (\u03c4 ) has a scaling property. If we take t 1 = kt and \u03c4 1 = k\u03c4 , then T t 1 (\u03c4 1 ) = k \u03b1 T t (\u03c4 ). Hence, in the fractional order dynamics, the time is \"accelerating\" in the early time and after that it is \"slowing down,\" as sketched in Fig. 8 .In this case, the \"passing time\" in the two axes of time is not the same. For this reason, in epidemic \"fractional\" dynamics, the epidemic threshold is shifted to the higher values. A lower \u03b1 indicates a \"stronger\" (long-lasting) memory and a more pronounced shift of threshold point. However, if one waits long enough, the same behavior will be observed in both fractional and usual homogeneous time. In fractional dynamics, after a \"very long\" time, the threshold point coincides with the one appearing in integer-order dynamics.",
