For example, >510 deaths were reported among the healthcare workers (HCWs) during the last Ebola outbreak, and by February 24, 2020, >3,300 HCWs had been infected with SARS-Cov-2 in China alone. 1,2 This issue represents the essence of outbreaks-a mass of patients who require prompt medical care. Under these conditions, the classical healthcare system cannot manage the large number of COVID-19 patients immediately and effectively. 3 Telehealth provides vital services through the application of information and communication technologies for each stage of managing diseases, research, and continuing education. 4 With telecommunication, visits are more economical and preserve government, community, and family resources, which are already limited during global outbreaks. It can be used to provide rapid diagnosis, and it enables caregivers to act quickly. 5 With the appropriate utilization of telecommunication, it is possible bring access to medicine and concurrent therapy in hard-to-reach regions and communities, facilitating direct-to-patient or specialty consultation services from a distance, which is cost-effective and improves the efficacy of follow-up. 6 The benefits of implementing telehealth in outbreaks comprise 8 main areas of focus:",
