            "text": "The study of cilia has shown escalating physiological significance in the past decade owing to the discovery of its role in the proper functioning of many mechanisms in the human body and other organisms. In a relatively short period of time, over ten diseases, such as primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), hydrocephalus, polycystic liver and kidney disease, some forms of retinal degeneration and Joubert Syndrome, have been linked to the malfunctioning of cilia. They have been classified as \u2018ciliopathies\u2019 (Badano [1]), (Adams et al. [2]). Some of the most vital ciliopathies are caused due to the lack of coordination in ciliary movement in the epithelium. Cilia exhibit a distinctive, complex asymmetric manner of movement. Each beat cycle comprises of an \u2018effective stroke\u2019 and a \u2018recovery stroke\u2019. In the former, the cilia are relatively straight, and their effect on the fluid is maximized. In the latter, their effect on the surrounding medium is minimized since the cilium has a more curved shape. Any disruption of this characteristic pattern can lead to physiological problems such as when the cilia on the epithelium show hyper/hypo motility or disoriented arrangement and beat direction (Van's Gravesande et al. [3]). The PCD is a classic example of such a condition. It involves the cilia on the respiratory tract and reproductive organs. PCD leads to poor muco-ciliary clearance and hence infection (Rayner et al. [4]), (Bush et al. [5]). This disease manifests itself during the embryologic phase of development and is a result of inefficient and unsynchronized ciliary movement.",

Cilia may also become withdrawn into the cell body, as is seen in the nasal epithelium during coronavirus infection (Afzelius [12]). A substantial loss of cilia is likely to result in rhinorrhoea (a condition where the nasal cavity is filled with a significant amount of mucous fluid). A reduction to about half the normal number of ciliated cells has been recorded from the tracheae of hamsters that were deprived of vitamin A since birth (McDowell et al. [13]).",

It is mentioned that the areas of activity and the direction of metachronic waves traveling across the areas are not randomly changing. Examination of high-speed cine-film showed that the activity on the epithelial surface is comprised of many small patches of regularly beating cilia. The extent of these patches depends on the type of control over ciliary beating. In frog palate, where patches are highly localized, it is under neural control.

Extending the scope further, we find that the study of the synchronized movement of cilia has inspired to mimic them and develop \u2018artificial cilia\u2019. These artificial cilia, apart from application in MEMS and micro-robotics, have been used on lab-on-a-chip devices for varied applications including microfluidic pumps, acoustic detection, and heat transfer (Khaderi [23], Breidenich [24]).",

In a study by Bootz, and Reuter [25], the aim was to establish whether it was possible to carry out such grafting in an animal model. They used purebred strains of Lewis blood group rats to avoid host-versus-graft rejections of mucous membrane transferred from a donor to a recipient animal. Their findings showed that respiratory epithelia heal when grafted onto a recipient site which has an adequate blood supply but do not lose their initial differentiation or functions.

Alteration of levels of ATP and ACH (acetylcholine) in the physiological environment has shown to drastically enhance ciliary beating, leading to an almost linear increase in ciliary tip forces (Zvi Teff [26]). In regard to inter-ciliary spacing, it has been studied by Gr\u03cbnbaum [27] in a computational hydrodynamic model of the ciliated tentacle arrays (using M.edulis as a case study), that spacing between cilia can alter the efficiency of clearance of the fluid medium in which cilia occur. Therefore a good understanding of the parameters looked at in our study can gain us valuable insight about the efficiency of muco-ciliary clearance.",

It considers a three-layered structure of the Airway Surface Liquid (ASL), including a bottom-most layer of Newtonian Periciliary fluid (PCL), an overlying traction layer and a top-most thick layer of mucous (\nFig. 1). The traction layer is essentially an extension of the linearly viscoelastic mucous layer, which defines the maximum extent to which the cilia-tips extend and hence the traction layer can be assumed to be responsible for transmission of cilia-tip forces to the mucous layer. The cilia length is considered to be around 6 \u03bcm, and most of this length is submerged in the PCL except during the momentary extension into the traction layer during the effective stroke. Thus, the PCL is taken to be 5.4 \u03bcm, and the traction layer about 0.6 \u03bcm. The overlying mucous layer is taken as 4 \u03bcm. The width of the domain was taken to be considerably larger than the height, in order to compensate for edge effects. A two dimensional model is created, with the effect of the cilia represented as propulsive body forces in the traction layer and resistive viscous forces in the PCL. A simple Maxwell model of viscoelasticity is used and is established in the traction and mucous layers.",

Apart from the characteristics of shear thinning, spinnability, adhesiveness etc., there are certain unique behaviors of the mucous which can be best explained by its viscoelastic nature. It is observed for example, that during the brief period of the beginning of the recovery stroke, the mucous reacts elastically (with minimum relative slip). Then during the recovery stroke, a period of sufficient length must again be granted for the cilium to release itself from the contact of the mucous (Silberberg [31]). This is because of the elasticity of the mucous. Thus, unlike most fluids which are characterized only by their viscosities, mucous exhibits complex visco-elastic behavior. It can be argued that non-Newtonian fluids can be exploited by biological systems to their advantage because viscoelastic stresses allow a tuning of kinematics of transport and locomotion in a manner that is not possible from Newtonian fluids (Lauga [32]). In the same reference, it is observed that the energetics of a fluid which has some elasticity is more favorable in many biological systems such as that of swimming spermatozoa.",

We thus use the open boundary condition at the sides of the domain. The bottom boundary was defined as a wall. It represents the fact that there is no flow through the epithelium and the no-slip condition at the epithelium-PCL interface. Also, due to the wall boundary condition, it is possible to impose the zero vertical velocity boundary condition at the epithelium-PCL interface. The top most boundary is a stress boundary. The stress boundary represents the interface between the mucus and the air and allows us to model the shearing effects of the air flow upon the mucus.

The first, third and fifth are un-ciliated, whereas the second and fourth are ciliated. The black line separating the adjacent units can be seen in the Fig. 5(b).Thus the second and fourth units of the model are the first and second ciliated domains respectively. Also, the third unit of the model is the second un-ciliated domain. In our studies, we focus on the first and second ciliated domains and the second un-ciliated domains (as this is the domain separating the two ciliated regions).When we vary the spacing between the two ciliated domains; we alter the length of the second un-ciliated domain. The study of the phase difference is conducted by altering the phase difference between the ciliary beat cycles in the first and second ciliated domains. Also, it is to be noted that it is the mucous layer in each unit is that of interest since we aim to study the factors altering mucous movement in order to gain deeper insight into the pathological conditions that may occur in the ciliary epithelium. We therefore study the movement of the mucous as a result of the ciliary motion in the PCL layer.",

However, it is more realistic, since it incorporates the true physiology of the ciliary epithelium i.e. the fact that cilia exist in patches, separated by either clefts or by other types of cells (such as goblet cells and Clara cells). Due to this fact, the patched model also allows us to dig deeper in to the mechanism of mucus clearance. It allows us to analyze a factor which has hitherto not been stressed upon i.e. how the cilia, in different locations of the epithelium assist each-other in muco-ciliary clearance.",

This adds complexity to the study of the resulting mucous motion. Furthermore, mucus is a complex visco-elastic fluid. Therefore, it is difficult to predict how the mucous flow will be affected upon varying the parameters that define inter-bunch interaction. There are several questions that need to be answered. Do all the patches beat in the same direction at all times? What happens if some of the patches stop beating due to disease or even during normal conditions? In those situations, do the remaining patches change their mode of beating in order to keep the mucous flow rate undisturbed? Through our simulations, we try to find the answers to some of these questions.",

It is further found that by doubling the length of the ciliated domain, the mucous flux in this region also almost doubles, indicating an almost linear variation of mucous flux with length of domain. Since by increasing the dimensions of a ciliated domain we are increasing the region of activity of the cilia, this is quite understandable. However, after increasing the length of the ciliated domain, the effect of putting the bunches out of phase seems to be largely subverted. This is evident from the fact that in Fig. 11, we see that the value of mucous flux in the first ciliated domain (whose length has been increased) is almost identical to that seen in Fig. 10, whereas the mucous flux in the second ciliated domain seen in figure is much less in Fig. 11 compared to Fig. 10. This could mean that larger patches have the advantage of being able to maintain their mucous flow irrespective of the activity within surrounding patches.",

            "text": "It is slightly more difficult to predict the effect of increasing the gap between the cilia patches. In our simulation, this was done by increasing the length of the unciliated region in between the two ciliated domains. In Ref. [30] it is mentioned that the region of ciliary activity is divided into distinct patches and the influence of each such patch extends only the short distance across the area and fades at the edges of the region. Owing to the increased distance between the ciliated regions therefore, we would expect the mucous flow within the ciliated regions to not alter significantly and that the flow in the intermediate unciliated region would reduce, since the effect of the ciliated bunches would not be as pronounced in this larger bulk of mucous. It is seen, however, that despite the increased distance between the bunches, the mucous flow in the unciliated region is not reduced. When the cilia bunches on either side of this unciliated domain are in synchrony, for example, the flux in this unciliated region is larger than that of the other unciliated regions. This indicates that even if sections of ciliary epithelium are impaired due to disease, the muco-ciliary clearance rates can remain conserved provided surrounding patches are functioning. Of course, this argument fails in case of large scale damage of ciliary epithelium. Though the mucous flow in this unciliated region is much greater than that of the other unciliated regions, the increase is not linear with increase in length, as was observed when the length of the ciliated domain was increased. More interestingly, however, when the ciliated patches are completely out of phase, the mucous flux in the intermediate unciliated region greatly reduces and becomes almost equal to that of the other regions without cilia. This is interesting because in the cases where all the domains were of equal length and also in the other case where the length of the first ciliated domain was increased, the flow in the intermediate unciliated region was not affected much when the bunches were put out of synchronization. It seems therefore, that when the ciliated regions are farther away from each-other, the effect of putting them out of synchronization becomes more pronounced.",

(Kawakami et al. [37]). In a study to investigate the effects of pharmaceutical agents on the ciliary beat frequency (on rabbit tracheal epithelium), it was found that benzalkonium chloride induced inhibition of CBF in a concentration dependent manner (Wang et al. [38]). On the other hand, potassium sorbate resulted in an increase in CBF (Wang et al. [38]). Also it has been found that the hormone Progesterone has the effect of reducing ciliary beat frequency in experimental studies on mouse fallopian tube (Bylander et al. [39]). Thus, it is clear that the ciliary beat frequency can be modulated by extraneous agents, which in turn alters the flow of mucus. This can have therapeutic application in treating various muco-ciliary disorders. Recognizing this fact, we made a detailed study of how modulation of CBF of patches of cilia affects mucus flow.",

Interestingly, for all the plots we obtained, the peak value of mucous flux was seen at the frequency value of 10 rad/s (1.6 Hz). It is not easy to provide an explanation for this observation. However, the fact that we have obtained a probable optimum frequency is interesting. It is highly probable that the value of optimum frequency we have obtained is highly specific to our simulation, with the given arrangement and shape of cilia bunches. Nevertheless, it does make us aware that there is a possibility of something such as an optimum frequency of ciliary beating. This is an interesting aspect deserving greater attention in the future.

For example, the bunches of cilia depicted in our model have regular geometry. In reality, the patches of cilia are of irregular shape. Also, in reality there is a spatial distribution of the patches. Thus, interaction of the ciliary bunches does not take place only along one dimension, and the analysis is more complex.
