As expected, in our study, a dominant pattern or distribution in CT images was not discriminable between patients who had RF and those who did not. Moreover, although several parameters that indicate increased severity, such as multilobar or pleural effusions, tended to be more frequently observed in RF patients, there was no statistical significance on multivariable analysis for predicting RF in AdV pneumonia.",
