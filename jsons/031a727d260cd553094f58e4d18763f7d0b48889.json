There is a constant need for information as new organisms emerge, existing ones develop resistance to current drugs or vaccines and there are changes in epidemiology and prevalence. In the twenty-first century, obtaining this information has never been more important. Population migration, and the relatively low cost of flying, means that unfamiliar infectious diseases may be brought into industrialised countries. An example of this was an outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), which was first recognised in 2003. Despite modern technology and a huge input of money, it took months for the agent to be identified, a diagnostic test to be produced, and a strategy for disease reporting and isolation to be established.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "A further example of how population migration can result in the spreading of disease was with the appearance of swine influenza A (H1N1).
