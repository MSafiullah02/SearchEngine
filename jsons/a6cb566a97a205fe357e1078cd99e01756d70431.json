The major aging mediated changes in a cell include: reduction in number of mitotic cells; alteration in permeability of membrane; decreased hormone and enzyme secretion; decreased immunity; decreased antioxidant defence with concomitant increase in free radical generation; increased DNA damage (Ashok and Ali 2003) . There are many theories to explain aging, such as the gene regulation theory. Recently, change in chromatin structure and epigenetic alterations have also been correlated to aging (Gravina and Vijg 2010) . The change in the chromatin structure during aging can be traced back to the observation that chromatin became compact in aged rats with concomitant decline in transcription (Chaturvedi and Kanungo 1985) . However, progress in the area of chromatin as a mediator of aging has been relatively slow and was only dependent on few sporadic observations. Few observations of the last decade including role of histone deacetylases in extension of life span in few model organisms has reinforced the link of chromatin to aging.",

Hence, in order to be packaged inside the tiny nucleus, which is approximately 10 lm in diameter, a huge level of folding is needed. To facilitate this, the eukaryotic DNA forms a large macromolecular complex called as chromatin, by associating with almost equal amount of histone and non-histone proteins (Kornberg 1974; Kornberg and Thomas 1974) . The fundamental structural unit of chromatin is called nucleosome. Each nucleosome is a complex of a core histone protein octamer, around which 146/147 base pairs of DNA wraps around *1.7 turns and *54 bp (10-90 bp) remains as linker DNA. Arrays of nucleosomes appear as beads on a string structure of approximately 11 nm diameter and 5.5 nm in height (Kornberg 1974; Luger et al. 2012 ). These arrays of nucleosomes form the primary structure of chromatin and popularly named as 10 nm fibre.",

Out of which, the central histone fold motif, comprise of a1 (9-14 a. a.), a2 (*29 a. a.) and a3 (9-14 a. a.). This central histone fold motif is flanked on either side by two other a-helices. These a-helices are connected to each other by short b-loops. The histone fold domains interact with each other to form H2A-H2B and H3-H4 heterodimers. In physiological salt concentrations, two such H3-H4 heterodimers interact with each other by a H3:H3 interaction, to form a tetramer. Similarly a H2A-H2B dimer associates on either side of the H3-H4 tetramer via a H2B:H4 interaction (Luger et al. 1997) .",

However, to explain the conformation several models are proposed (see below). In low ionic strength, the chromatin appears as a beaded fibre, in which beads represent the nucleosomes (Olins and Wright 1973) . The 10 nm fibres are wrapped in a left-handed fashion with six nucleosomes per turn to form the 30 nm chromatin structure. Two different models have been proposed to explain the 30 nm chromatin fibre structure; namely the solenoid model and the zigzag model (Robinson et al. 2006) . According to solenoid model, the nucleosomes are folded to a simple helix, where the adjacent nucleosomes remain present next to each other in a chromatin fibre. In the zigzag model, the linker DNA is present in a straight path between nucleosomes (Woodcock et al. 1993) . Here, two rows of nucleosomes are arranged in a zigzag fashion, due to interaction between alternative nucleosomes. This type of interaction produces a double helical structure ). Protein-protein cross-linking analysis revealed that from a single stack of 12 nucleosomes, two rows of six nucleosomes were produced as predicted for the zigzag model (Robinson et al. 2006) .",

This occlusion is reversed by chromatin remodeling. Chromatin remodeling refers to regulated alteration in the chromatin or in the nucleosome structure, making it transiently permissive/occlusive, so as to enhance/obscure binding of factors requiring DNA as template. ATP dependent chromatin remodeling factors and ATP-independent chromatin remodeling factors, with support of each other, mostly bring about the chromatin remodeling (Vaquero et al. 2003) . The ATP-dependent chromatin remodelers are multi-subunit protein complexes of >1 MDa. They utilize ATP and cause disruption in the nucleosome so that the DNA-histone contacts are loosened; mobilize the octamer in cis along a DNA sequence so that a particular DNA sequence becomes accessible; transfer the octamers in trans so that the promoters are freed to be accessed by transcription factors and RNA polymerase; cause looping in DNA; or incorporate histone variants to the nucleosomes. The above mentioned remodeling complexes mostly contain a highly conserved ATPase subunit of helicase superfamily. Depending on the presence of other flanking domains and accessory subunits, the remodeling complexes are further divided into SWI/SNF, ISWI, CHD and INO80 families (Clapier and Cairns 2009 ).",

The C-terminal domain contains a bromodomain for binding to acetylated histones. The SWI/SNF complex was initially identified in yeast. Homologues of yeast SWI2/SNF2 were subsequently identified and characterized from Drosophila (brahma), mouse (mBrm and mBrg) and human (hBRM and BRG1). Similar BRG1 containing homologues have also been identified in rat, Xenopus and chicken (Panigrahi et al. 2003; Vignali et al. 2000) . In yeast, there is another SWI/SNF like complex called as RSC (Remodels Structure of Chromatin, size of *1.5 MDa) (Cairns et al. 1996) . The RSC contains four homologues of yeast SWI/SNF components. The SWI/SNF and related complexes broadly function in reorganization and positioning of nucleosomes in the promoter region for facilitating transcription factor binding. They can cause random positioning of the nucleosomes in a chromatin domain using evenly positioned nucleosomes as substrates. They are also responsible for ejection of nucleosomes and exposing a target DNA site (Dechassa et al. 2010 ).",

Instead their C-terminal domain contains a SANT or a SLIDE domain (Clapier and Cairns 2009 ). Later the ISWI protein was found to be a principal constituent of three ATP-dependent chromatin-remodeling complexes in Drosophila, namely NURF (nucleosome remodelling factor), CHRAC (chromatin accessibility complex) and ACF (ATP-utilizing chromatin assembly and remodeling factor) (Vignali et al. 2000) . NURF was purified from Drosophila embryonic extracts as an activity that stimulated transcription factor binding to chromatin promoter. Similarly, CHRAC was purified as an activity that made chromatin accessible to nucleases. ACF, on the other hand, was responsible for nucleosome assembly with the help of histone chaperons (Vignali et al. 2000) . ISWI-related complexes were also identified from yeast, Xenopus and human (Dirscherl and Krebs 2004) . There is a considerable functional heterogeneity with the ISWI containing complexes. Except NURF, no other ISWI-complex has been shown to disrupt nucleosomes. However, they slide nucleosomes along DNA (cis-transfer) (Dirscherl and Krebs 2004). 4.3 Mi-2/CHD (Chromodomain, Helicase, DNA Binding)",

Acetylation of histones is a reversible process. Histone acetyl transferases (HATs) add acetyl groups while histone deacetylases (HDACs) remove it. The acetylated histones become less positive, resulting in decreased affinity for the negatively charged DNA that in turn weakens DNA binding (Hong et al. 1993) . This brings about a permissive structure in the chromatin, for binding of different proteins factors to DNA (Lee et al. 1993 ). Transcriptional activation has been shown mostly synergistic to histone acetylation (Struhl 1998) . Further, acetylated histone tails can directly recruit other chromatin interacting machineries, such as bromodomains containing factors. Hence, they act as docking sites for downstream events (Berger 2002; Zeng and Zhou 2002) .",

ADP-ribosyl transferase transfers single ADP-ribose to arginine or lysine residues of free histones in the cytoplasm. Subsequently, poly-(ADP-ribosyl) polymerase (PARP), carry out the elongation process in nucleus. PARP recognizes and binds to single or double strand DNA breaks and then exposes the DNA strand breaks to proteins involved in repair process (Le Rhun et al. 1998 ). The ADP-ribosylation is reversed by poly-ADP-ribose-glycohydrolase. Poly ADP-ribosylated histones are part of the relaxed chromatin. Further, it is known that by ADP-ribosylation, the H3K4me3 demethylase is excluded from the chromatin, making the chromatin domain transcriptionally active ).",

SUMO shares only 18 % identity with Ubiquitin group. Out of the four histones, histone H4 is efficiently modified by SUMO-1 or SUMO-3, both in vitro as well as in vivo. Acetylated histone H4 usually gets sumoylated. It leads to decreased acetylation of histone H3 due to recruitment of HDACs and increase in HP1 binding. Hence, sumoylation has a role in repressing transcribing chromatin (Girdwood et al. 2003) . It has been hypothesized that probably sumoylation initiates attenuation followed by gene repression.",

Depending on the number of methyl groups attached to e amino group, lysines can be mono, di or tri methylated. Similarly, arginines can be mono or dimethylated. Lysine methylation can have mixed effects. It depends on the position of lysine residue which is methylated and the levels of methylation (mono, di or trimethylated). Methylation at K4, K36 and K79 of histone H3 are marks of transcriptionally active chromatin, while methylation at K9, K27 of H3 and K20 of H4 are marks of transcriptionally inactive chromatin Peters et al. 2003; Rice et al. 2003; Schotta et al. 2004) . The lysine methylation is reversibly regulated by histone methyl transferases and demethylases. Histone methyl transferases (HMTs) methylate histone lysine and arginine residues. They have been broadly classified into three protein families: the PRMT family methylates arginine residues (Bedford and Richard 2005; Zhang and Reinberg 2001) , while the SET domain containing family and the Dot1/DOTL families methylate lysine residues Kouzarides 2002; Lachner et al. 2003) .

It finally results in generation of transcriptionally permissive/occlusive chromatin template (Strahl and Allis 2000; Turner 2000) . For example, the chromodomain containing protein HP1 (heterochromatin protein 1) is recruited to methylated histone H3K9 and generates a heterochromatin domain (Bannister et al. 2001; Nakayama et al. 2001 ). The heterochromatinization spreads by self-association of many HP1 (Nielsen et al. 2002) . Antagonistically, chd1, the chromodomain containing protein (a component of SAGA and HAT complex) is recruited to methylated H3 K4, and it further recruits SAGA and HAT complexes and ultimately generates a euchromatic chromatin domain (Pray-Grant et al. 2005 ).",

The differential role is played by the fact that euchromatic genes are regulated being dimethylated at H3K9 and the heterochromatic silencing takes place by generating trimethylated H3K9. However, few deviations are also available (Vakoc et al. 2005) . Similarly, H3K27 methylation is also a mark of transcriptional silencing and X-chromosome inactivation.",

The COMPASS of the MLL complex are classically known as generators of euchromatin marks (Roguev et al. 2001) . Components of COMPASS generate trimethyl K4 of histone H3 (H3K4me3) marks (Schneider et al. 2005) . Actively transcribing genes are enriched with both dimethyl and trimethyl H3K4 marks. While, the dimethyl modifications mostly restricted to the coding regions, the trimethyl modification localize specifically to the regulatory regions of genes (Bernstein et al. 2005) . WDR5 and Chd1 are recruited to the methylated H3K4, and they acetylate other lysine residues like H3K14 and K9. The K9 acetylation mark is antagonistic to K9 methylation mark and thus the respective chromatin domain remains in an activated state (Timmers and Tora 2005) . Further, the WDR5 binds to H3K4me2 and is responsible for maintaining global trimethylated H3K4 condition (Wysocka et al. 2005) .",

DNA methylation is regulated by de novo DNA methyl transferases and maintenance methyl transferases (Marchal and Miotto 2015) . The first group of methyl transferases, DNMT3a and DNMT3b, methylate one strand of the newly synthesized DNA and convert them to hemimethylated DNA. The hemimethylated DNA is converted to a methylated DNA by maintenance methylase, DNMT1. However, DNMT3a and DNMT3b have been shown to also act on hemimethylated DNA (Marchal and Miotto 2015) . Few recent reports have also demonstrated methylation outside the CpG (Yang et al. 2013) . The human genome has approximately 30 million CpG. Dense clustering of these CpG in some regions of the genome is observed and these regions are known as CpG islands. Presence of 5meCpG islands in the promoter region of a gene is a mark of silenced gene. 5meCpG in the coding region of a gene is also observed, however, its mode of regulation is yet to be properly understood (Shenker and Flanagan 2011) . DNA demethylases were not known until recently and hence DNA methylation was believed to be a relatively permanent mark. Now, formation of 5-hydroxymethyl cytosine (5-hmeC) is believed to be an intermediate in DNA demethylation process (Pfaffeneder et al. 2011) . Oxidation of 5-meC generates 5-hmeC and then to several intermediates which are observed (Jurkowski and Jeltsch 2011) . These reactions are catalysed by TET (ten-eleven translocations) enzyme family. Embryonic stem cells have higher levels of 5-hmC and it decreases upon differentiation (Xu et al. 2011) . However, few other methods are also proposed for demethylation of DNA. They include non-replacement of methylation marks in the daughter cells during division, removal of methyl group by DNA glycosylase and deamination of cytosine or oxidation.",

Accordingly, a group of modifications coexist and work synergistically but are not compatible with others group of modifications (Jenuwein and Allis 2001 ). Say, for example, when H3K4 is methylated, there is synergistic acetylation of H3K14 and phosphorylation of H3S10. All are involved in transcriptional activation, and all of them are antagonistic to the inhibitory H3K9 methylation. Further, the complexity increases as lysines can be mono, di or tri methylated. Accordingly, they encode different signals for activation. Taken together, a language of histone modification can be created with the available information, which was initially framed as histone code (Strahl and Allis 2000) . This code was then supported by yet another hypothesis that the simplest code can be binary (Jenuwein and Allis 2001) . For example, H3K9 and H3K4 cannot be methylated simultaneously in the same chromatin domain. Likewise, H4K20 methylation and H4K16 acetylation are antagonistic. Distinct histone modifications, on one or more tails, act sequentially to form a \"histone code\", that is read by chromo and bromodomain containing proteins. This creates specific combinations of modifications on a local domain. All together they bring about formation of the euchromatic and heterochromatic domains of chromatin. A detailed account of the different post-translational modification and their cross-talk is represented in Fig. 1 .",

Proteolysis of histones, though rare, is believed to be another mode of irreversible post-translational modification (Allis et al. 1980) . The N-terminal/C-terminal tails of histones are more susceptible for the proteolysis, when histones exist in the form of chromatin. Proteolysis of histones emerged as a problem for chromatin isolators (Brandt et al. 1975) . However, later the site specific histone proteolysis has been linked to aging and chromatin structure modulation (see below). In calf thymus, chromatin-bound proteolytic activity which was specific to H2A was demonstrated (Eickbush et al. 1988 ). The cleaved product, which lacked 15 a. a. from the C-terminus, was named as cH2A. The cleavage site was between Val-114 and Leu-115. (Okawa et al. 2003) . Two truncated forms of H2A have been purified from the nuclei of acute myeloid leukemia OCI/AML1a cells (Okawa et al. 2003) . However, the enzyme catalysing this cleavage is not known. Proteolysis of histones has also been proposed during transformation of spermatids into spermatozoa (spermeogenesis), at the terminal stages of spermatogenesis (Marushige et al. 1976 ). During the process, chromosomal DNA becomes tightly packaged as a result of proteolytic replacement (Marushige and Marushige 1983 ) of somatic type histones, by protamines. The mechanism of histones displacement requires their proteolysis for removal. A protease activity associated with mouse testicular chromatin has also been observed, which might be involved in proteolytic removal of somatic histones during spermatogenesis (Faulkner and Bhatnagar 1987) . Further, this specific proteolysis was absent in other tissues like thymus and liver suggesting tissue specific functional regulation.",

The protease Cathepsin L is extensively characterized. The H3 cleavage by Cathepsin L is regulated by specific covalent modification code of histone H3. Recently, in chicken liver tissue, glutamate dehydrogenase was identified as a histone H3 N-terminus specific protease . A yet to be identified histone H2A specific protease is also characterized from chicken liver (Panda et al. 2013 ). In summary, in recent years histone specific proteolytic cleavage and histone subtype non-specific degradation have also been observed simultaneously, suggesting that histone-specific and histone non-specific proteases exist in nature and they have evolved along with histones. Hence, it is recently opined to distinguish these proteases into broadly two groups: 1. histone proteases with broad spectrum specificity mostly function for turnover of histones. 2. Histone proteases with site specificity have role in modulating chromatin structure and function by modulating epigenetic marks (Dhaenens et al. 2015) .",

            "text": "Due to the ease in genetic manipulation, short life cycle and conservation of mechanisms of aging across the eukaryotes, the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is a growing model for aging study (Wood and Helfand 2013) . One of the measurement parameters for aging is the replicative life span in budding yeast or in other words the number of daughter cells a budding mother cell produces before it reaches non-dividing stage. It has been observed convincingly that there is loss of transcriptional silencing with concomitant decrease in chromatin compaction in budding yeast during the process of aging (Smeal et al. 1996) . In budding yeast, three regions of the genome remain silent: viz. the mating type switching locus (MAT locus), the ribosomal DNA locus (rDNA) and the telomere proximal regions. In aged yeast, there is loss of silencing of the MAT locus leading to co-expression of both mating type genes, causing insensitivity to pheromones and increased sterility in aged yeast. Further, there is movement of silencing proteins such as HDAC (NAD + dependent histone deacetylase) and silencing information regulator 2 (Sir2) away from the telomeric region in the aged yeast (Kennedy et al. 1997) . Also, in the aged yeast, there is loss in silencing of the rDNA region with concomitant rise in recombination and formation of extra ribosomal chromosomal circles and increase in genomic instability. These events can be monitored with limiting replicative life spans. It is further seen in yeast model that deletion of Sir2 reduces replicative life spans, while introduction of an extra copy of Sir2 gene increases the same (Etzioni et al. 1999) . Hence, from these observations, it can be concluded from yeast model that chromatin of the silent regions remains in more relaxed state in aged yeast. Sir2 is known to deacetylate H4K16Ac (Imai et al. 2000) . Further, there is an age dependent decrease in Sir2 proteins in yeast leading to increase in H4K16Ac mark in global level (Dang et al. 2009 ). The H4K16Ac is a unique epigenetic mark which inhibits formation of 30 nm fibres and subsequent folding of the chromatin into higher order. Thus, age dependent increase in H4K16Ac leads to formation of open chromatin structures globally (Shogren-Knaak et al. 2006) .",

            "text": "There is also change in the gene expression pattern during aging in yeast (Wood and Helfand 2013) . Some of the change in gene expression could be due to elevated stress responses and induction in repair genes during aging. However, a significant amount of change in the gene expression could also be due to altered chromatin structure during aging. It is observed that there is increased transcription of the core histones with aging. On the other hand, short-lived yeast mutants deficient in the ability to acetylate H3K56Ac have decreased level of core histone transcript in aged cells, which is in turn similar to that of telomerase deficient cells (Lesur and Campbell 2004) . H3K56Ac is enriched in histone gene promoters for transcription. Conversely, elevation in the histone transcript levels in aged yeast does not correlate with increase in bulk histones in the aged yeast. In fact, there is decrease in bulk histones in aged yeast cells (Feser et al. 2010 ). This could be due to the feedback inhibition of the histone transcript translation. Further, by ChIP analysis it has been revealed that there is reduced histone occupancy in many regions of the chromatin including the telomere proximal region, the rDNA region and the MAT locus in the aged yeast (Wood and Helfand 2013) . The loss of histone from the chromatin of aged yeast leads to the formation of a more open chromatin and in turn increases transcription of some genes. On the other hand, lower concentrations of the synthesized histones in the aged yeast leads to decreased pool of free histones and also alters epigenetic marks of the histones. In another line of evidences, it has been found that aged yeast cells have decreased polyamine synthesis (amines are required for cell proliferation). Yeast cells treated with spermidine showed hypoacetylation of H3K9, K14, K18 and H4K16 with concomitant decrease in HAT activity, specific for these sites and increase in replicating life span (Eisenberg et al. 2009 ). However, it was in contrast to the hyperacetylation of the H3K56 sites suggesting again the site specific role of diverse histone acetylations in modulation of aging in yeast model.",

The methylation marks of K4, K9 and K27 of H3 are extensively studied in the worm (Padilla et al. 2014) . It is found that disruption of the H3K4 methyl transferase complex (ASH-2), leads to increase in the lifespan of the worm, while disruption of the H3K4 demethylase (RBR-2) leads to decrease of the same. It has been further shown that this increase in life span is inherited up to certain generations . Similar observations are also reported for other modifications sites of histone H3. An aging dependent decline in the H3K27me3 is observed in the worm with concomitant increased activity of the respective histone demethylase (UTX-1). It has been further seen that disruption of UTX-1 results in increased levels of H3K27me3 marks in the worm genome and there is increase in the life span . Synergistically, disruption of the LSD1 complex that acts as a demethylase for H3K4me and H3K9me sites also results in increased life span in the worm (McColl et al. 2008) . However, it is not clear from these observations, why there is an increase in life span on hypermethylation of activation marks such as H3K4 as well as repression marks such as H3K9 and H3K27. It can be suggested that probably gene specific transcription plays a more important role during aging than the global level change in the transcription of an organism which can also be tissue specific.",

The disease is caused due to mutation in Lamin A gene which forms a part of the nuclear envelope (Oberdoerffer and Sinclair 2007) . Mutation of the Lamin A gene by altered splicing, generates a truncated lamin A protein, termed as progerin (Feser and Tyler 2011) . Accumulation of lamin A in the nuclear envelope causes a number of downstream effects. There is decline in methylation marks for heterochromatin, like H3K9me3 and H3K27me3 levels synergistic to decline in HP1 and EZH2 (H3K27 methyl transferase). It results in increased transcription from pericentric heterochromatin, shortening of telomeric regions and disruption of nuclear architecture. Progerin expresses at very basal level in young and old mammals. Overexpression of progerin results in all these change in the histone modifications status, described as above and disorganization of the nuclear architecture. Even, by blocking the cryptic splicing site and correcting the splicing defect, the abnormal cell can be reverted back to normal and delay aging process (Feser and Tyler 2011) .",

            "text": "As discussed earlier, in yeast, the heterochromatic regions mainly silence the mating type locus and stabilize the rRNA genes and telomere regions by preventing them from recombination. As the rDNA region is repetitive, it is also prone to recombination. In yeast, the rRNA region is stabilized and silenced by REST (regulator of nucleolar silencing and telomere exit) complex (Oberdoerffer and Sinclair 2007) . This complex is a Sir2 containing complex. Sir2 is a major histone deacetylase responsible for deacetylating histone H4K16Ac. The Sir2 interacts with Sir3 and Sir4 not only in the rDNA region but also in the MAT and the telomeric regions and is regulated by them (Kaeberlein et al. 1999) . In yeast, the highly repetitive rDNA region is prone to recombination. Recombination mediated excision in these regions generates extra-chromosomal circles. During subsequent cycles these extra-chromosomal circle keep on accumulating in the nucleolus and cause cell death. Hence, there is a need to silence the recombining rDNA region to increase genomic stability and delay aging, which is done by the Sir2 complex. A truncated Sir4 protein, no longer interacts with the telomeric region. Instead, more Sir2 and Sir3 are targeted to the nucleolus. It results in extension in life span of the yeast (Straight et al. 1999) . Similar observations are also obtained from human progeroid disease, Werner Syndrome (WS) (Oberdoerffer and Sinclair 2007) . In this disease, there is a mutation in the DNA helicase gene. This mutation also causes genomic instability by extra-recombination in the rDNA region and results in early aging. In other similar diseases such as HGPS (Hutchinson-Gilford Progeria Syndrome), there is a mutation in the Lamin A gene which, encodes a protein of the nuclear membrane, as described earlier (Oberdoerffer and Sinclair 2007) . It disturbs nuclear membrane architecture with concomitant loss of HP1 proteins. HP1 is very much essential for maintenance of the integrity of the constitutive heterochromatic region as it binds to methylated H3K9. Loss of HP1 leads to disturbance in the heterochromatic regions. Further findings have shown that a similar splice variant of lamin A also accumulates in normal aged individuals indicating similar events in the normal aging and disease induced aging processes (Scaffidi and Misteli 2006) . Similarly, in the AT (ataxia telangiectasia) disease also there is mutation in the ATM gene which is a component of the DNA repair cascade important for telomere maintenance. Defective ATM products also disturb telomere and nuclear matrix interaction and enhance aging (Greenwell et al. 1995) .",

There is reduction in the core histone expression during replicative aging in yeast with concomitant decrease in histone occupancy (Hu et al. 2014) . It leads to aberrant up-regulation of associated genes and also causes genomic instability. Further, in yeast models, deletion of anti-silencing function-1 and CAF-1, (the central chaperone complex required for deposition and removal of histones from chromatin) causes drastic reduction in its life span (Feser et al. 2010 ). It has been seen that though there is significant increase in the histone transcripts during aging, there is global decrease in the chromatin bound core histones during aging. Supply of extra core histone or ectopic expression of histone H3 and H4 and not H2A and H2B increases the replicative life span in yeast. Hence, it is concluded that expression of H3 and H4 dimer promotes nucleosome deposition and transforms again to a more uncompact form and thereby decrease genomic instability and increase life span. Though, to the best of our knowledge, similar experimental observations are limiting from mammalian cells, it can be argued that similar process can also be applicable to mammalian systems, as similar decline in histone expression is also observed in mammalian cells too.",

            "text": "In vertebrates, transcriptionally silent regions are generally marked by the presence of 5-methyl cytosines in the CpG dinucleotide sites (described earlier). There is reduction in the 5meC in aged human cells. Further studies have indicated that there is decrease in the 5meC in the CpGs present outside the promoter regions in different human tissues (Benayoun et al. 2015) . Conversely, there is an increase in 5meC in the promoter region of aged tissues of human and mice. It is further hypothesized that the methylation in the promoter regions of development related genes probably contribute to the aging mediated mis-regulation of gene expression. Recent reports have suggested a link between human age and 5meC status of DNA (Zou et al. 2014) . The stem cells (embryonic and pluripotent stem cells) are estimated to be ageless in correlation to the DNA methylation age. Similarly, sperms and ovum have younger DNA methylation ages compared to respected differentiated tissues from the same individuals. Further, a comparison of the DNA methylation status of different tissues can also be useful for predicting the health of various tissues. For example, in obese individuals, there is increased DNA methylation age of liver than other tissues of the same individual. Similarly, individuals with Down's syndromes have increased methylation age of blood cells compared to normal individuals with similar biological age. Similar observations are also seen in model organisms for aging study. In Drosophila, overexpression of dDnmt2 (DNA methyl transferase) gene increases longevity, whereas deletion of the gene generates short lived flies (Benayoun et al. 2015) . Although, the mechanism of methylation mediated modulation of aging is still unclear, the results obtained from Drosophila and human samples pose a relationship between DNA methylation and aging and suggests that DNA methylation could be used as a general biomarker for aging.",

On the contrary, when the respective demethylase gene was knocked down, it resulted in shortened lifespan . Further, overexpression of the H3K4 demethylase in the germinal cells increased lifespan.

Similarly, orthologues of Sir2 such as SIRT6 in mice deacetylates H3K9Ac and H3K56Ac. Deficiency of SIRT6 generates progeroid like phenotypes in mice, hypothesizing that it has role in aging. On the contrary, overexpression of sirt6 increases longevity (Kanfi et al. 2012) . Even senescence can be induced in these cells by exposing these cells to a HDAC inhibitor such as Trichostatin A.

These OGNAc attached histones are enriched in gene promoters important for aging and stress responses in C. elegans (Benayoun et al. 2015) . Further, deletion of the OGNAc depositing gene shortens the lifespan of C. elegans; while, deletion of the gene that removes the OGNAc mark extends the life span. Age dependent changes in the oxidative modifications of histones such as carbonylation are also reported in rat liver (Sharma et al. 2006) . While, the rate of carbonylation was higher for the above mentioned histones in young rat liver, the carbomylation was significantly lower in the liver histones of aged rats.

This band migrated between histone H2A and H4. The appearance of this band had a strong correlation with decrease in the stoichiometry of the histone H3. It was speculated that this band might be a clipped product of H3, and hence named as DH3. However, the precursor-product relationship between H3 and DH3 was not established. The DH3 generation has also been demonstrated recently in case of old chicken liver (Purohit et al. 2012) . Through N-terminal sequencing, it has been shown that the DH3 was an N-terminally clipped product of histone H3, being cleaved at 23 amino acids from the N-terminus.

            "text": "A number of increasing lines of evidence propose chromatin structure as a modulator of aging. There is aging dependent change in regulation of transcription and nuclear architecture. When organisms age, there is decline in maintenance of the cellular structure and function which brings about change in the chromatin structure and organization. However, the age dependent change in the chromatin structure is multifaceted and often antagonistic in different organisms. For instance, in most of the organisms, with aging there is decreased histone expression and decrease in heterochromatin abundance with concomitant formation of an open chromatin structure. However, in the replicating senescence model there is age dependent accumulation of heterochromatic foci. The other examples also include the redistribution of SIR proteins in yeast during aging from the telomere and MAT locus to the rDNA regions promoting rDNA silencing and telomere shortening. At present restoring back to a youthful chromatin structure involves elevation in histone expression, reduction in acetylation of H3-N-terminal and H4K16 and inactivation of the HDAC Rpd3. The epigenome is also influenced by environmental factors. Throughout the lifespan of an organism, the insults induced by the environment also contribute to the functioning of cells to organs. Thus it can also be proposed that the epigenomic instability induced by environment and life style also influence aging as represented by the methylation clock. It can be further stated that modulation of the epigenetic reprogramming by altering chromatin remodeling factors can revert aging. Hence, Also, in contrast to the Lamin A deposition in the nuclear membrane and interaction of NuRD complex to lamin A in young cells, there is an age dependent accumulation of progerin leading to disorganization of the nuclear architecture. In addition, there is decreased expression of NuRD complex in aged cells. Further, in aged cells, there is decreased core histone expression leading to reduced histone occupancy in the nucleosomal array. In addition to that there are a number of changes in the histone and DNA PTM, such as methylation and acetylation in the promoter and the coding region of the genes, which are indicated these chromatin remodeling factors pose a good candidate for therapeutic interventions. A detailed account of the aging mediated changes is summarised in Fig. 2 . However, several questions related to aging are still unclear and require future investigation. 1. The change in chromatin modifications are the cause or the consequence of aging? 2. Could the epigenetic players be precisely modulated and could act as therapeutic targets for reverting aging? 3. Since, the epigenetic modulators are broadly global; could they be specifically managed by independent linear pathway so that when therapeutic interventions are formulated, they will have minimal side effects. We are sure, answers to these questions are crucial before formulation of any medicine/agents for epigenetic rejuvenation. Few recent reports represent that HP1b and mH2A are the prime targets in this respect. However, the concept of epigenetic rejuvenation is still in its infancy and needs manifold unravelling in near future.",
