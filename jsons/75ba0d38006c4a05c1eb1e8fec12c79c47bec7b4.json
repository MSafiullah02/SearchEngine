The prevalence of PNTM in underdeveloped and developing countries remains unclear as there is still a lack of detection methods that could clearly diagnose PNTM applicable in these low-resource settings. Since non-tuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) are environmental pathogens, the vicinity favouring host-pathogen interactions is known as important predisposing factor for PNTM. The ongoing changes in world population, as well as socio-political and economic factors, are linked to the rise in the incidence of PNTM. Development is an important factor for the improvement of population well-being, but it has also been linked, in general, to detrimental environmental consequences, including the rise of emergent (usually neglected) infectious diseases, such as PNTM. The rise of neglected PNTM infections requires the expansion of the current efforts on the development of diagnostics, therapies and vaccines for mycobacterial diseases, which at present, are mainly focused on TB. This review discuss the current situation of PNTM and its predisposing factors, as well as the efforts and challenges for their control.",

Genetic defects in genes related with immune response, CFTR, cilia, and connective tissue have been found with increased frequency in PNTM patients compared with their unaffected family members and control subjects. Many of the patients had simultaneous defects in various genes, comprising of different categories [79] . Evidence of genetic linkage on chromosome 6q12-q16 with PNTM and the identification of TTK as a candidate gene for PNTM have been found in PNTM patients [80] . Also, haplotypic association with PNTM has been reported [81] . Some studies showed association of different HLA antigens and susceptibility to PNTM. In this regard, HLA-A33, HLA-DR6 and the haplotype A33-B44-DR6 were found with higher frequency in PNTM, and the presence of HLA-A26 has been associated with a bad clinical evolution [82, 83] . The studies related with the genetic defects associated with PNTM support the notion that PNTM is a complex, multifactorial disease with the simultaneous presence of several concomitant genetic alterations [79] (Table 2) .",

Pectus excavatum, a skeletal feature of rickets, is related to hypovitaminosis D, as this vitamin is essential for maintenance of healthy bones [166] . The development of lungs is also affected by the vitamin D level and deficiency of this vitamin may lead to deficits in lung function and volume [167] . In bronchiectasis patients, 50% have vitamin D deficiency and are frequently colonized with bacteria [168] . Generally, the level of vitamin D decreases with increasing age and decreased exposure to sunlight [169] . All the factors previously mentioned have been linked with PNTM; however, studies related with the link between vitamin D and PNTM are relatively scarce. Association of severe vitamin D deficiency and PNTM has been reported [162] . However, in another study, Fujita et al. (2018) showed association of vitamin D with bone mineral density and antimicrobial peptide levels (hCAP18/LL-37), without a direct link between the serum vitamin D level and PNTM [170] .",

The serotypes of MAC are associated with pathological characteristics as in the case of serotype 4 which is linked to disseminated infection in AIDS patients [214, 217] . LOSs are also present in M. canettii and some MTBC, but absent in Mtb, such as H37Rv [215, 218] . LOSs are strongly immunogenic and associated with immunomodulation and virulence [218] [219] [220] [221] [222] . [225] [226] [227] (Table 1) .",

Although transmission of NTM from human-to-human is not common, in 2010, a first case of M. kansasii isolated from a couple in East London, an area with high TB burden, was reported [231] . The isolates were genetically identical, and the authors were unable to prove a shared domestic exposure [231] . Whole genome sequencing (WGS) has revealed the possibilities of human-to-human transmission, but most probably in an indirect manner via fomite contamination or inhalation of NTM in airborne water droplets [232] .

In centralized water supply systems, water travels long distances, which eventually leads to degradation of the disinfectants, i.e. decrease in chlorine concentrations due to heat inactivation [239] . Also, a study showed that despite addition of ozonation and filtration treatments, NTM can still persist in water systems [240] . NTM can be recovered in water with free and total chlorine levels of 2.5 and 2.8 mg/l, respectively, suggesting that chlorination is unable to efficiently kill mycobacteria [241] . One of the main reasons that mycobacteria can survive in this harsh environment is their ability to form a protective shield, biofilm [229] . In potable water, slow growing MAC form a highly culturable biofilm compared to RGM, suggesting that the former has better adaptation to growth in lownutrient environments [229] . Also, M. avium is able to survive and grow in free-living amoeba, particularly Acanthamoeba lenticulata as parasites or endosymbionts, and the encystment protect M. avium from the disinfection processes [336] . Water treatment has always been focused on eliminating water-borne gastrointestinal bacteria such as Campylobacter, Salmonella, Shigella and Escherichia coli but not in the elimination of mycobacteria [337] . Considering the ability of mycobacteria to survive in these harsh environments even after treatment, a more appropriate water treatment plan is needed as the consequences of NTM infection should not be overlooked. A study by Inkinen et al. (2016) suggested that cooper pipelines might be effective in preventing NTM colonization compared to polyethylene pipelines [338] .",

Such criteria are needed because NTM exists naturally in the environment, and isolation of NTM from non-sterile respiratory specimens does not confirm that the organism is the causative agent for lung disease [344] . High-TB burden countries are normally those of the low to middle income countries (LMIC), where resources for microbiological culture using the traditional diagnostic TB gold standard either on solid L\u00f6wenstein-Jensen medium or liquid culture [Mycobacteria Growth Indicator Tube (MGIT)], are limited. Thus, sputum smear microscopy is the most important test used for TB diagnosis [345] . With the current rise of PNTM infections, the non-specific microscopic testing, which detects all acidfast bacilli, cannot differentiate between PNTM or TB infection. The application of chest X-ray screening to predict the presence of TB or PNTM remains subjective. As recommended by ATS/IDSA, PNTM can be diagnosed based on nodular or cavitary opacities on chest radiography [332] . Gommans et al. (2015) studied 83 PNTM patients showing that cavities were observed most frequently, while consolidations were a predictor for risk of mortality [346] . A radiographic study on 108 TB and 25 PNTM patients showed that the presence of honeycomb appearance (characteristic appearance of variably sized cysts in a background of densely scarred lung tissue) is significant in PNTM patients; consolidation, miliary nodules, cavities, atelectasis, fibrothorax and mediastinal widening are more common in TB patients; and pleural effusion, pleural lesions, and reticulonodular infiltration are observed in both TB and PNTM patients [347] . Therefore, the confirmation of PNTM in LMIC remains a diagnostic challenge for microbiologists and clinicians.",

Differentiation of PNTM and TB is important because the first-line antibiotics used to treat TB are less effective against NTM [351] . A study of 12 SGM and 12 RGM with 15 antimicrobial drugs showed that 24, 16 and 8 strains were resistant to isoniazid (INH), rifampicin (RIF) and streptomycin (STR), respectively [351] . The authors concluded that STR, amikacin (AMK), the fluoroquinolones (FQs), and the tetracyclines (TET) are the most effective antimicrobial agents against the 24 strains [351] . A study of 95 NTM strains with ten drugs showed that ethambutol (EMB) is the most useful agent against NTM, but its resistance rate among the tested strains was around 42% [352] . The emergence of multidrug resistant NTM (which can be resistant to five or more antimicrobial drugs) has also complicated the treatment [353] . Thus, according to the British Thoracic Society guidelines, different drugs or combination of drugs should be used to treat different species [236] . For example, treatment of MAC lung disease with RIF, EMB and macrolides [clarithromycin (CLR) or azithromycin (AZM)]; treatment of M. kansasii lung disease with RIF, EMB and macrolides; treatment of M. xenopi lung disease with RIF, EMB, macrolides and FQs/INH; and treatment M. abscessus lung disease with AMK, tigecycline (TGC), imipenem (IPM) and macrolide is recommended [236] .",
