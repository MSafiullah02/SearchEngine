Methods: 1002 respiratory specimens were tested for HCoVs. The clinical and epidemiological data were compared on the basis of the type HCoV infection. Results: A hundred coronaviruses, 33 NL63, 2229E, 27 OC43 and 38 HKU1, were detected in 97 (9.8%) of 1002 samples negative in routine tests. The clinical and epidemiological characteristics of the study children were compared in three groups, 24 OC43-, 27 NL63-and 34 HKU1-infected children. HCoVs were identified mainly in children with upper and lower respiratory tract infections (50.5% vs. 29.4%). The significant difference in clinical presentation between the three coronavirus groups was the very low association between lower respiratory tract illness and HKU1 detection.

Five types of human coronaviruses (HCoVs) have been described: HCoVs 229E and OC43 were first identified in the mid-1960s, and HCoVs NL63 and HKU1 were identified recently, in 2004 and 2005. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] HCoVs 229E and NL63 belong to group 1, while HCoVs OC43 and HKU1 belong to group 2. The last human coronavirus is severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV which was identified during the SARS epidemic in 2003. 6 This epidemic was controlled and the SARS-CoV is no longer circulating among humans. As a result, there are only four HCoVs with global circulation in the human population at this time. HCoVs 229E and OC43 are known as viruses causing upper respiratory tract illnesses and can elicit a more serious respiratory disease in children, the elderly and people with underlying disease. [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] In several studies recently published, new coronaviruses NL63 and HKU1 have been found associated with a significant percentage of upper and lower respiratory tract infections. [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] Because of the difficulty designing studies with an appropriate control group, this association remains an important issue. This study has two objectives: to study the clinical diseases associated with the detection of the four HCoVs in the respiratory specimens sampled from hospitalised children in France between September 2004 and May 2005; and to develop and to validate a multiplex reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay allowing for the simultaneous detection of the four HCoVs.

The comparative analytical sensitivities of the four single RT-PCR assays and the one multiplex RT-PCR assay were studied by analysing serial 10-fold dilutions of positive controls and were found equivalent with respect to their intended targets. A potential cross-reactivity among HCoV primers was eliminated by analysing the 15 different combinations of positive controls. RT-PCR products were processed on an agarose gel, stained with ethidium bromide, and visualised under UV light. Only the samples with a positive detection of an amplified product were subjected to a hybridisation test (GEN-ETI-K DEIA, Sorin, Italy) confirming the specificity of such an amplified product.

The number of days between admission and a positive coronavirus sample taken, along with the duration of symptoms, was taken into consideration for determining nosocomial infection. After a complete examination, the medical records were classified on the basis of a final diagnosis: upper respiratory tract illness, lower respiratory tract illness without wheezing, bronchiolitis, exacerbation of asthma, gastro-enteritis. The data were analysed using the c 2 exact test for qualitative data, and Krushal-Wallis's test for quantitative data, and then compared on the basis of the type of HCoV infection.

HCoVs were the fourth most frequent circulating viruses in this study, after RSV, rhinoviruses and influenza A and B viruses (Fig. 1) . The process of testing only the routine test negative samples underestimated the prevalence of coronaviruses and excluded the detection of two or more different viruses. However, this process allowed us to associate the described clinical symptoms with HCoV infection only. Three samples were positive for two coronaviruses (two cases due to OC43 and HKU1, and one case due to 229E and NL63). Coronaviruses were detected in every month of the study. However, HCoV infection mainly occurred in the winter and spring months, with a peak in February (Fig. 2) Thirty-three per cent of HCoV-infected children suffered from at least one underlying chronic condition. The delay between the beginning of the illness and admission to the hospital was from 3.2 to 6.3 days and the median duration of hospitalisation was equivalent for the three groups (from 2.8 to 4.9 days). We found evidence of nosocomial acquisition of coronavirus in two cases. The first one was an OC43-infected female child. She was 1 month old and was hospitalised in the neonatology department for prematurity. The nasal aspirate sampled 30 days after her admission was OC43 positive thought she had not left the hospital. The second case was a 9-month-old male child suffering from oesophageal atresia and admitted for parenteral nutrition. He was hospitalised for 75 days and contracted pneumonia at day 18. Five nasal aspirates were sampled on D17, D18, D23, D32 and D42. The first three were positive for NL63 detection, the fourth was positive for 229E detection, and the last was positive for RSV detection. HCoVs were identified mainly in children with respiratory tract infections while upper respiratory tract infections were more common than lower respiratory tract infections (50.5% vs. 29.4%). The significant difference in clinical presentation between the three coronavirus groups was the very low association between lower respiratory tract illness and HKU1 detection. Of the 34 HKU1-positive children, none suffered from bronchiolitis, and 11 (32.4%) were without respiratory symptoms at the sampling time and within the 24 following hours. A significant number of patients (from 25.9% to 38.2%) had a gastrointestinal infection associated, in 56% of the cases, with rotavirus or adenovirus detection in stools (data not shown). Of the 34 HKU1-infected children, six (17.6%) were admitted for epilectic seizures, three suffering from underlying neurological disease (familial epilepsy with susceptibility gene, agenesis of corpus callosum, neonatal epilepsy after temporal lobe haemorrhage). In this study, HKU1 detection was not associated with a high frequency of febrile seizures. Likewise, NL63 detection was not found to be associated with a high frequency of croup. No statistical differences were observed for laboratory or radiological characteristics between subtype HCoVs. Finally, oxygenotherapy was required for eight children.

Consistence is also found in these studies, to include our own, with respect to the detection of the four HCoVs throughout the year, with a peak of circulation in winter-spring months in temperate climate regions. In our study, group 2 HCoVs (types OC43 and HKU1, 65%) were more prevalent than group 1 HCoVs (types NL63 and 229E, 35%). This type repartition was not found in all studies, showing that the epidemiological data on HCoV epidemics must be reviewed. 12, 25 More specifically, our understanding of overlapping epidemics, or possible variation from year to year, in the relative incidence of the different types, must be improved. Further continuous studies conducted over several years are necessary. However, significant progress can only be made in the study of human coronavirus infections upon the development of reliable, currently available and relatively inexpensive methods for detecting the different subtypes of HCoVs. The increasing number of type HCoVs, the description of new recombinant variants and the genetic variability of these viruses create obstacles in the development of updated molecular and immunological assays. Efficient strategies in molecular method-ology depend upon adequate knowledge of limitations in techniques. Consensus methods, often using degenerated primers defined in conserved gene, theoretically allowed for the detection of all types, as well as the potential detection of new variants. However, some authors found that consensus assays were less sensitive than methods using type-specific primers. 15, 16 The multiplex PCR provides an interesting alternative approach tested in this study. Nonetheless, our approach involved the development of classical PCR, using, first of all, the detection of amplified products and, then, an hybridisation assay. The next challenge will be the development of a sensitive and inexpensive multiplex real-time PCR. It must also be kept in mind that the development and validation of monoclonal antibodies has been critical in rapid and easily available diagnosis of respiratory viral infections. Detection of a coronavirus in respiratory specimens negative for viral routine tests was associated with upper and lower respiratory tract diseases in hospitalised children in 50.5% and 29.4% of cases, respectively. Around 10% of the patients (eight out of 85) required oxygenotherapy. The pathologic impact of HCoV infection varied according to the design of study population. Esposito et al. recently suggested in a prospective study conducted in Italy, that the different types of HCoVs have a limited clinical impact on otherwise healthy children who checked into an emergency ward. In this study, patients with underlying chronic diseases were excluded and HCoVs were mainly associated with upper respiratory tract illness (72%). 25 In a study, also conducted in Italy, by Gerna et al. and included 823 patients from whom one-third were immunocompromised, HCoVs were detected in 74.5% of cases with lower respiratory tract illness and in 25.5% of those with upper respiratory tract illness. 16 Although HCoVs may be considered as low pathogenic viruses responsible for limited diseases in the wider population and treated by general practitioners, our study shows that nearly one-third of children admitted in hospital for respiratory tract illness suffered from underlying chronic conditions and proved considerable risk of complications. HCoVs may also be responsible for respiratory nosocomial infections. It is therefore critical that HCoVs be screened more routinely in respiratory specimens in hospitals and that reliable viral detection methods be used. The comparative analysis of clinical symptoms associated with the detection of different HCoV types suggested that the type HKU1, the most frequently detected in our study, was less often associated with lower respiratory diseases than the other types and could be detected in a larger range of diseases. These data were consistent with recently reported findings of no association between bronchiolitis and pneumonia in hospitalised children and HKU1 detection. 12 The specific pathologic pattern of HCoV type remains to be more thoroughly investigated. We previously showed that HCoV-HKU1, like SARS-CoV, and probably the other types, can be excreted in stools. 23 Unfortunately, stools sampled from enrolled children were not available and could not be tested for HCoVs. The shedding of HCoVs in gastrointestinal tissues probably plays an determining role in viral transmission and could be responsible for diseases in some patients. HCoVs 229E and OC43 are also suspected of playing a role in neurological diseases, and HKU1 may play a role in epilectic seizures. 18 Such an association was not found in this study. Nevertheless, the potential neurotropism of HKU1 and HCoV strains in general merits more investigations.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 753, "end": 756, "text": "12,", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 1844, "end": 1847, "text": "15,", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "In sum, HCoV detection in people without any other respiratory virus detection was associated with upper respiratory tract illness and a significant rate of lower respiratory tract illness in hospitalised children.
