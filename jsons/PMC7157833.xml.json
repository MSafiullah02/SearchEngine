Viral enteritis increases susceptibility to other diseases, decreases feed conversion efficiency, and prolongs the time to market [1, 2]. Runting-stunting syndrome (RSS), also known as malabsorption syndrome, is diagnosed based on clinical signs (diarrhea, dehydration, growth depression, unevenness in size) and histopathological lesions (distension of the crypts of the small intestine, inflammatory cell infiltration in the lamina propria adjacent to affected crypts and necrotic cellular debris in crypts) [3, 4].",

The small intestines (duodenum, jejunum and ileum) of broiler chickens in flocks 05D72 and 07D11 were collected after necropsy, processed promptly via blending into a 10% homogenate in sterile phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 0.4 mg gentamicin per ml, and stored at \u2212 80 \u00b0C until analysis.

Homology-based (BLAST) classification showed a total of 48,979-1,766,642 viral sequence reads and identified ten different viruses with sequence identity to avian viruses and bacteriophages. Bacteriophage sequences comprised 3.3 to 100% of the viral sequences and were assigned to known families, including Leviviridae, Siphoviridae, Myoviridae and Podoviridae. Most of the samples had abundant Leviviridae sequences, but 13D62 and 13Q45 showed plentiful Siphoviridae sequences. All samples excluding 05D72 contained sequences from unassigned phages. The identified viral sequences were assigned to known viral families, including Picornaviridae, Astroviridae, Parvoviridae, Reoviridae, Caliciviridae, Picobirnaviridae, Adenoviridae, Coronaviridae and Anelloviridae. In all four samples from chickens diagnosed with RSS, Astroviridae and Picornaviridae were detected. Parvoviridae sequences were detected in three (07D11, 13D62, 13Q45) of the four samples, Reoviridae sequences were identified in two samples (07D11, 13D62), and Caliciviridae and Picobirnaviridae sequences were detected in two samples (13D62, 13Q45). Coronaviridae and Anelloviridae sequences were identified in sample 05D72, and Adenoviridae sequences were identified in sample 13D62. Sample 05D72 from chickens diagnosed with infectious bronchitis as well as RSS contained Coronaviridae (0.2%) with Picornaviridae (94.6%), Astroviridae (0.1%) and Anelloviridae (1.9%). Reoviridae (66.1%) and Picornaviridae (24.3%) families were abundant in sample 07D11, which also contained Parvoviridae (5.9%) and Astroviridae (2.1%) sequences. Sample 13D62, which was taken from chickens with a final diagnosis of inclusion body hepatitis and RSS, contained Astroviridae (75.2%) and Picornaviridae (11.8%) sequences, followed by sequences from Reoviridae (3.8%), Caliciviridae (1.1%), Picobirnaviridae (0.9%), Parvoviridae (0.8%) and Adenoviridae (0.2%) families at equal abundance. Sample 13Q45 showed a viral profile similar to that of sample 07D11 containing Picornaviridae (37.9%), Astroviridae (8.6%), Parvoviridae (5.3%), Caliciviridae (16.0%) and Picobirnaviridae (11.1%) sequences, but no sequences were assigned to Reoviridae. Sequences from the control sample differed from those of all other samples and contained no viral reads assigned to known avian viruses and only bacteriophage sequences (Table 2 Supplementary data 2).",

Chicken astrovirus, parvovirus, calicivirus and rotavirus have been identified as causes of gastrointestinal tract infections in poultry, such as RSS, which is also called malabsorption syndrome [27]. A few studies using viral metagenomics could not specify any particular pathogen from the viral community in the chicken flocks with RSS because the distributions of enteric viruses in diseased and healthy flocks were not significantly different [17, 28, 29]. Chicken astrovirus has been distributed worldwide for decades and is nearly ubiquitous constituent of the chicken gut [30]. We also found a high positive detection rate (62.8%) for this virus in the non-RSS-affected chickens. On the other hand, metagenomics analysis in this study showed that only chicken astroviruses were common to chickens that had been diagnosed with RSS via pathological lesions in the crypts of the small intestine. In addition, chicken astrovirus was not identified in the fecal virome of healthy chickens in Brazil [31]. Chicken astrovirus has been suggested as an etiological agent for RSS, but it could be detected in chickens without microscopic lesions. Recently, the pathogenesis of chicken astrovirus in broilers was revealed. Serial passages of the virus from chicken to chicken induced the increased virulence, as shown by decreased weight gain and the presence of histopathological lesions [32]. Kang et al. provided strong evidence of chicken astrovirus as an etiological agent of RSS, although the mechanism for its reproduction via bird-to-bird passage is not known. Our metagenomics results support the notion of chicken astrovirus as a major etiology of RSS.",

RSS in chickens is disease that impairs productivity in the Republic of Korea. In the present study, we used an unbiased metagenomic approach for viral pathogen discovery, the detection of novel viruses and the development of a molecular diagnostic tool to detect pathogens from the obtained sequences. We suggest that RSS in chickens, which is also called malabsorption syndrome, is caused by a chicken astrovirus. In addition, the multifactorial etiologies as a cause of RSS, as well as astrovirus enteritis could be ruled out through further studies of other enteric viruses, such as parvovirus, rotavirus and calicivirus.",
