In contrast to microglia, oligodendroglia are resistant to CD8 T cell perforin-mediated viral control in the absence of IFNg. Kinetic induction of MHC Class I expression by microglia and oligodendroglia in vivo was thus analyzed to assess responses to distinct inflammatory signals. Flow cytometry demonstrated delayed Class I surface expression by oligodendroglia compared with microglia. Distinct kinetics of Class I protein upregulation correlated with cell type specific transcription patterns of genes encoding Class I heavy chains and antigen processing components. Microglia isolated from na\u20ac \u0131ve mice expressed high levels of these mRNAs, whereas they were near detection limits in oligodendroglia; nevertheless, Class I protein was undetectable on both cell types. Infection induced modest mRNA increases in microglia, but dramatic transcriptional upregulation in oligodendroglia coincident with IFNa or IFNg mRNA increases in infected tissue. Ultimately mRNAs reached similar levels in both cell types at their respective time points of maximal Class I expression. Expression of Class I on microglia, but not oligodendroglia, in infected IFNg deficient mice supported distinct IFN requirements for Class I presentation. These data suggest an innate immune preparedness of microglia to present antigen and engage CD8 T cells early following infection. The delayed, yet robust, IFNg dependent capacity of oligodendroglia to express Class I suggests strict control of immune interactions to avoid CD8 T cell recognition and potential presentation of autoantigen to preserve myelin maintenance.

            "text": "Class I surface expression is regulated at multiple levels including proteolysis, peptide transport, and chaperone-aided complex assembly. The majority of peptides presented by Class I molecules are derived from proteasomal degradation of ubiquitin-tagged proteins in the cytoplasm. Proteasomal specificities are conferred by three b subunits localized in the catalytic 20S core complex (Strehl et al., 2005) . The constitutive proteolytic subunits involved in homeostatic protein turnover can be replaced by interferon (IFN) inducible proteosomal subunits Type 8, 9 and 10 (PSMB8, PSMB9, PSMB10; also known as LMP7, LMP2, and MECL-10, respectively) to form the immunoproteasome. Immunoproteosomes release peptides with increased Class I binding affinities (Strehl et al., 2005) . Peptides are selectively shuttled from the cytoplasm into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) by the heterodimeric transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP), formed by the TAP1 and TAP2 subunits (Garbi et al., 2005) . In the ER, chaperones aid in assembly of Class I heavy chains, peptides and b2-microglobulin (b2M) to form a stable complex capable of trafficking to the cell surface (Garbi et al., 2005) . The major antigen processing components, immunoproteosomes and TAP are encoded in the MHC Class I locus and are inducible by both IFNa/b and IFNg (Jamaluddin et al., 2001; Paulsson, 2004) .",

However, inflammatory stimuli rapidly induce Class I expression on microglia in vitro and in vivo, coincident with upregulation of antigen processing components (Bailey et al., 2006; Stohwasser et al., 2000) . Similar to microglia, IFNg stimulates Class I expression on oligodendroglia in vitro and in vivo (Popko and Baerwald, 1999; Sedgwick and Hickey, 1997) . By contrast, oligodendroglia specific transgenic expression of Class I heavy chains leads to ER accumulation and severe myelination defects (Baerwald et al., 2000; Power et al., 1996; Turnley et al., 1991) . This suggests basal levels of the antigen processing machinery in oligodendroglia are insufficient to deliver peptides for Class I assembly and egress from the ER. The regulation of Class I antigen processing components by oligodendroglia is not only of interest in elucidating their role as targets of anti-microbial CD8 T cells, but also of self reactive CD8 T cells in autoimmune diseases, such as multiple sclerosis (Huseby et al., 2001; Sun et al., 2001) . Stringently regulated Class I expression is also important in prolonging survival of oligodendroglia grafts for therapeutic remyelination approaches (Tepavcevic and Blakemore, 2006) .",

Acute viral replication in the CNS is controlled by CD8 T cells, consistent with Class I expression on all glia (Bergmann et al., 2003; Hamo et al., 2007; Ramakrishna et al., 2006; Redwine et al., 2001) . Microglia and astrocytes, but not oligodendroglia are susceptible to perforin-mediated CD8 T cell viral control in the absence of IFNg. By contrast, IFNg is required to control virus in oligodendroglia (Gonzalez et al., 2006; Lin et al., 1997; Parra et al., 1999) . Whether IFNg has a direct antiviral effect or enhances Class I antigen presentation by oligodendroglia is unclear. Delayed Class I upregulation on astrocytes compared with microglia in this viral model presents a precedence for differential regulation of Class I antigen presentation (Hamo et al., 2007) .",

By contrast, microglia only moderately upregulated mRNAs encoding antigen presentation machinery, yet expressed MHC Class I protein earlier and independent of IFNg.

To assess basal transcript levels of genes required for MHC Class I peptide presentation, oligodendroglia and microglia were FACS purified from spinal cords of na\u20ac \u0131ve mice. Both glial populations expressed similar levels of Gapdh transcripts per cell when compared with J774A.1 macrophages ( Fig.  2A) . Furthermore, the ratio of Gapdh mRNA levels per number of purified cells was consistent throughout infection (data not shown). These data confirmed Gapdh as a stable reference gene, whose mRNA levels were not affected by alterations in the CNS environment due to inflammation. Although microglia from na\u20ac \u0131ve mice did not express detectable Class I protein, Class I transcripts were expressed at levels similar to J774A.1 macrophages (Fig. 2B) , which constitutively express surface Class I molecules. By contrast, oligodendroglia within the na\u20ac \u0131ve CNS expressed 10 times lower levels of these transcripts compared with microglia or J774A.1 cells. Similarly, na\u20ac \u0131ve microglia expressed comparable levels of Tap2 and Psmb8 encoding mRNA as J774A.1 cells, whereas these transcripts were barely detectable in na\u20ac \u0131ve oligodendroglia. The relative levels of b2M, Tap1, and Psmb9 mRNAs were similar to Class I, Tap2, and Psmb8 mRNAs in each glial cell type, respectively (data not shown). Transcripts encoding the constitutive proteasomal subunit Psmb5, not encoded at the MHC locus, were analyzed to evaluate the overall proteasomal degradation capacities in the glial subsets. Basal levels of Psmb5 transcripts were present at similar levels in na\u20ac \u0131ve microglia and oligodendroglia, but levels were reduced compared with J744A.1 cells (Fig. 2B) .",

The relative abundance of these transcripts in microglia suggests post-transcriptional repression of Class I antigen presentation. To confirm a block in translation rather than ER retention of Class I in na\u20ac \u0131ve microglia, intracellular retention of H2-D b was examined using a D b and L d cross-reactive mAb (see Fig. 3 ). Antigen processing deficient T2-L d cells were used as a control for intracellular accumulation of unassembled Class I in the ER and negligible surface staining. J774A.1 cells were used as a positive control for Fig. 3 ). Accumulation of intracellular Class I was analyzed following monensin treatment to block the secretory pathway. Detection of surface expression was blocked by pre-incubation with unlabeled mAb to maintain similar conditions (see Fig. 3 ). Under these conditions, intracellular Class I remained undetectable in na\u20ac \u0131ve microglia. By contrast T2-L d cells exhibited robust intracellular accumulation of Class I molecules. J774A.1 cells also accumulated intracellular Class I, albeit at lower levels compared with T2-L d cells. Similar results were obtained in two additional independent experiments in the absence of monensin treatment. These data suggest that the inability of na\u20ac \u0131ve microglia to express Class I complexes (see Fig. 1 ), despite abundant transcripts encoding all the necessary components (see Fig. 2 ), is the result of translational repression rather than a post-translational block.

Although b2M mRNA did not peak until Day 7 p.i. in oligodendro-glia, maximal levels relative to Gapdh mRNA were similar to those in microglia. Transcripts encoding Class I, Tap1/2 and Psmb8/9 in oligodendroglia were not notably increased until Day 5 p.i. and also peaked at Day 7 p.i. Similar to b2M mRNA, individual transcripts encoding Class I processing components reached comparable maximal levels in both cell types, with the exception of Tap2 mRNA. In two independent experiments peak expression of the respective mRNAs relative to Gapdh differed less than threefold between the two cell types. After Day 7 p.i., all mRNAs declined in oligodendroglia, but remained elevated relative to basal levels through Day 10 p.i. (see Fig. 4 ). Relative to basal levels, virus-triggered inflammation induced at least 200-to 1,000-fold overall increases in the mRNA populations in oligodendroglia compared with modest 5-to 10-fold increases in microglia. The most potent increase was observed for Class I mRNA, reaching 1,300-and 5,000-fold values relative to baseline levels in two separate experiments. This dramatic increase in RNA accumulation coincided with expression of Class I molecules on the surface of oligodendroglia (Fig. 1B) and suggests de novo transcriptional activation of genes encoding Class I presentation components. Although the kinetics and magnitude of mRNA induction were vastly different between oligodendroglia and microglia, overall levels of mRNAs encoding Class I and antigen processing components, with the exception of Tap2, were similar at their peak comparing the two cell types.",

The present data demonstrate more stringent regulation of Class I expression by oligodendroglia compared with microglia during viral induced inflammation. Rapid Class I expression by microglia suggests they are the initial infected cells that interact with early infiltrating virus specific CD8 T cells to trigger IFNg secretion. This local IFNg in turn induces Class I expression by oligodendroglia, which peaks coicident with maximal IFNg transcript levels and prominent T cell infiltration into spinal cords (Marten et al., 2000) . The timing of these interactions is thus critical in establishing a balance between viral spread and CD8 T cell mediated control, as cytolysis is downregulated during the transition to viral persistence and IFNg is crucial in controlling MHV-JHM replication specifically in oligodendroglia (Bergmann et al., 2004; Gonzalez et al., 2006; Parra et al., 1999) .",

Class I expression is predominantly regulated at the transcriptional level with conserved promoter elements determining both tissue specific expression as well as responsiveness to cytokines and hormones (Howcroft and Singer, 2003) . Coordinated transcriptional upregulation of MHC genes in both oligodendroglia and microglia is consistent with similarities in their core promoter elements (Arons et al., 2001; Brucet et al., 2004) . The Tap1 and Psmb9 genes even share a bi-directional promoter. IFNa/b and IFNg directly activate Class I transcription via JAK/STATs or indirectly via IRF-1 induction, which binds the IFN-stimulated response element. IRF-1 also binds the shared promoter of Tap1/Psmb9 to drive transcription (Brucet et al., 2004) . The critical role of IRF-1 in controlling the Class I presentation pathway is demonstrated by low levels of Class I expression in IRF-1 2/2 mice (Hobart et al., 1997) . Following MHV-JHM infection, increased IRF-1 to IRF-2 mRNA ratios support IRF-1 as a primary candidate in enhancing transcription of these genes. IFNa mRNA was associated with upregulation of IRF-1 mRNA and Class I expression by microglia, whereas IFNg mRNA expression correlated with accumulation of mRNAs encoding IRF-1 and antigen presentation components in oligodendroglia. IFNg dependent Class I expression by oligodendroglia, but not microglia, was confirmed by Class I expression patterns in infected IFNg 2/2 mice.",

Delayed Class I expression by microglia in MHV-JHM infected mice deficient in IFNa/b signaling, confirm IFNa/b as a primary inducer of early Class I presentation by microglia (Ireland et al., 2008) . In addition, the modest increases in mRNAs encoding antigen presentation components in microglia support a partial contribution of translational regulation. Post-transcriptional repression of MHC genes has been observed in a variety of cancers, yet the mechanisms are unclear (Luo et al., 1995; Ponzoni et al., 1993) . Analysis of proteasomes from primary microglia cultures derived from neonatal mice revealed low, yet detectable protein levels of the immunoproteasome subunits PSMB9 and PSMB8 (Stohwasser et al., 2000) , which were significantly increased following IFNg treatment. Although IFNa/b stimulation was not analyzed in the latter studies, the data support constitutive transcription of Class I related genes in na\u20ac \u0131ve microglia. Our data suggest that translational repression of MHC associated transcripts, potentially released by IFNa/b signaling, may constitute a provocative new mechanism regulating MHC Class I expression by microglia.",

            "text": "Overall the stringent induction of MHC genes by oligodendroglia implies a tendency to avoid CD8 T cell cytolysis and preserve myelin maintenance and neuronal function. Nevertheless, as oligodendroglia are myelin factories, it is feasible to assume they present myelin derived epitopes during inflammation associated with IFNg secretion. Indeed, MBP specific CD8 T cells can recognize and lyse oligodendroglia in the absence of exogenous peptide in vitro (Huseby et al., 2001) . Similarly, CD8 T cell inflammation induced by overexpression of PLP by oligodendroglia is associated with Class I expression on oligodendroglia and CNS damage (Ip et al., 2006) . Activation and clonal expansion of CD8 T cells in brain biopsy samples and CSF of multiple sclerosis patients supports a role of local CNS autoantigen presentation (Babbe et al., 2000; Jacobsen et al., 2002; Skulina et al., 2004) . Furthermore, although Class I and IRF-1 was prominently expressed by activated microglia/macrophages in multiple sclerosis lesions, both proteins were also localized to oligodendroglia (Gobin et al., 2001) . However, in vivo interactions between CD8 T cells and Class I peptide complexes presented by oligodendroglia have not been formally proven. The potent transcriptional upregulation of Class I antigen presentation components by oligodendroglia presented in this report clearly demonstrates a potential for oligodendroglia to present myelin antigens. However, the exquisite sensitivity of microglia to early inflammatory cytokines implicates these cells as targets for initial CD8 T-cell interactions.",
