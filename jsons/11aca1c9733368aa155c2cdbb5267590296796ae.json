The illnesses were either mild (5/16, 31.3 %) or ordinary (11/16, 68.8 %), presenting as follows: asymptomatic (8/16, 50 %), fever and/ or cough (8/16, 50 %). Four asymptomatic patients (4/16, 25 %) in ordinary cases had chest computed tomography (CT) abnormalities. Leukocyte counts were normal in 14 cases(88 %), but 2 patients (12.5 %) had leukopenia, and 1 (6.3 %) was lymphopenic. There were 11 patients with chest CT abnormalities, some nodular, others small patchy and others ground-glass opacities. In asymptomatic children, the median time to SRAS-CoV-2 nucleic acid test(NAT) positivity once exposed to a family member with confirmed infection was 15.5 days (range, 10-26 days). The median time to first NAT-negative conversion was 5.5 days (range, 1-23 days). Conclusions: COVID-19 in children of Xiangyang city is often family acquired and not serious, with favorable outcomes. Asymptomatic children can be diagnosed as pneumonia because of chest CT abnormalities. It is essential to actively screen this segment of the population.",

Earlier data have shown that adult patients with COVID-19 present with fever, dry cough, dyspnea, fatigue, and lymphopenia. Serious pneumonia may also ensue, more often in elderly adult men and those with chronic comorbidities, posing greater risk of severe acute respiratory syndrome and even death [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] .",

Pathogen detection improved as the outbreak took hold, so reports of pediatric infections began to mount [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] . Herein, we have analysed 16 patients of Xiangyang city with laboratory confirmed COVID-19, 12 of whom had immediate family members (sometimes two or more) harbouring the same illness. It is suggested that the extent of epidemics in children reflects the dynamics of family units. Although avoidance of public places and social gatherings under our national prevention and control policies effectively reduced overall morbidity, children clearly rely on parental care. Close contact within the family is thus the likely mode of SARS-CoV-2 infection in children of Xiangyang city, similar to SARS and MERS [18, 19] . We are subsequently reminded that prevention and control of pediatric infections is indeed a family effort. Respiratory isolation, hand hygiene, and surface disinfection are all simple yet important preventive measures. Aside from the current lack of medical masks suitable for children, it is quite unrealistic for infants or toddlers to don masks, and many older children are incapable of selfdiscipline entailed in viral combat. While tending to their own obligations, parents must then do the same for their children, insisting on respiratory protection and hand hygiene.",

We have not known clearly the pathogenic features of SARS-CoV-2, so by using chest CT, we can effectively identify patients with pneumonia, determine severity of lung lesions and isolate the source of infection [15] . Whereas in our study, eight asymptomatic patients with or without chest CT abnormalities didn't show any sign of deterioration during the course and their outcomes were good. Hence, we should keep an eye on illness and think twice about CT scans when necessary. Regular use of NAT may be a workable approach to detecting asymptomatic carriers in family units.",

Total leukocyte counts were almost normal in the children we studied, although two were leukopenic and one was lymphopenic. CRP was elevated in one instance (< 40 mg/dL), and three patients had LDH elevations. Other laboratory results were all normal. These were minor deviations, compared with those occurring in adults. Lymphopenia reflects consumption of lymphocyte by SARS-CoV-2 and signals severe disease [1, 3, 4] , which is rare in children. Ultimately, laboratory testing in children with COVID-19 yields nonspecific results of little consequence, offering no strong diagnostic support. It may serve to exclude other pathology. Active monitoring is also helpful in determining the severity and progress of ongoing infections.",

Lesions in children commonly occupy lung periphery, sitting close to the pleura. In adults, lesions are likewise shown pleural distributions, positioned at interlobar fissures. However, those in children seem to align with bronchovascular bundles, simulating changes of bronchopneumonia; and although GGOs and consolidation are shared features, single lung involvement by few nodular or small/patchy changes are characteristic of children. Furthermore, the GGO halos are diminutive, consolidation is limited, and air bronchograms are unusual. Adult patients, in contrast, have bilateral broad-ranging lung changes, mainly large patches with paving-stone pattern and halo or reverse-halo signs. These phenomena suggest a more robust inflammatory response in adults, more so than in children. Extrapulmonary manifestations, such as nodal enlargement and pleural effusions that appear in adults are actually rare or absent in children. Finally, the pulmonary lesions in the pediatric patients tend to resolve after treatment, without sequelae, and not reappear; whereas, fibrous cords and secondary diseases may develop in adults. By comparison then, children with COVID-19 have atypical clinical symptoms, showing nonspecific and inconsequential CT changes of lung.",

The resultant immune imbalance may be catastrophic, culminating in systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) or ARDS. It is still unclear whether the maturity, functionality, or affinity of ACE2 receptors is lower in children than in adults, or whether other mechanisms (eg, accessory receptors) are operant, explaining the many discrepancies in pediatric and adult disease expression.
