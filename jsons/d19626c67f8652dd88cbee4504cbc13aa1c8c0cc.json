This study aimed to determine the distribution of several respiratory viruses in children diagnosed as having influenza-like illness, over the winter period of 2005-2008. Molecular assays including conventional and real time PCR protocols, were employed to screen respiratory specimens, collected by clinicians of the Influenza sentinel system and of outpatient pediatric clinics, for identification of several respiratory viruses. Of 1,272 specimens tested, 814 (64%) were positive for at least one virus and included 387 influenza viruses, 160 rhinoviruses, 155 respiratory syncytial viruses, 95 adenoviruses, 81 bocaviruses, 47 parainfluenza viruses, 44 metapneumoviruses, and 30 coronaviruses. Simultaneous presence of two or three viruses was observed in 173 of the above positive cases, 21% of which included influenza virus and rhinovirus. The majority of positive cases occurred during January and February. Influenza virus predominated in children older than 1 year old, with type B being the dominant type for the first season and subtypes A/H3N2 and A/H1N1 the following two winter seasons, respectively. Respiratory syncytial virus prevailed in children younger than 2 years old, with subtypes A and B alternating from year to year. This is the most comprehensive study of the epidemiology of respiratory viruses in Greece, indicating influenza, rhinovirus and respiratory syncytial virus as major contributors to influenza-like illness in children.",

Other symptoms including myalgia, headache, chills and fatigue can only be used as optional inclusion criteria. In influenza-like illness cases in children, influenza virus has been the most commonly detected virus, followed by other respiratory viruses such as human respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV) and human metapneumovirus (HMPV) [Zambon et al., 2001; Talavera and Mezquita, 2007] . Symptoms caused by these viruses are similar, making it difficult for clinicians to associate clinical features of influenza-like illness with the presence of a specific virus. In addition, viral identification could be very useful in terms of patient management, in the prevention of unjustified use of specific antiviral drugs and/or antibiotics, as well as in the implementation of appropriate public health measures, which may contain the spread of highly contagious viruses within a hospital setting. The introduction of molecular methods has revealed that a wide spectrum of well characterized respiratory viruses such as human rhinovirus (HRV), human parainfluenza virus 1, 2, and 3 (HPIV 1, 2, and 3) and human adenovirus (HAdV) as well as recently identified viruses, such as human bocavirus (HBoV) and human coronavirus (HCoV) can contribute to influenza-like illness [Furuse et al., 2010] .",

Secondary symptoms included sore throat, coryza, myalgia, fatigue, headache, abdominal pain, and respiratory hindrance. Specimens were collected, on a certain day every week, by physicians in healthcare units and collaborating hospitals, providing services for nearly 70% of the whole Greek population. These included, sentinel-collected samples (n \u00bc 405) referred by the Hellenic Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (HCDCP) as well as, non-sentinel specimens (n \u00bc 867) from the outpatient clinics of pediatric hospitals of Southern Greece, including Athens. The majority of specimens were nose and throat swabs collected into a GLY-medium (Mediaproducts BV, Groningen, The Netherlands) using a Dacron swab (DeltaLab, Barcelona, Spain), as well as nasopharyngeal aspirates and bronchoalveolar lavages.",

The application of molecular diagnostic methods allowed for the identification of a wide range of viral pathogens implicated in nearly 65% of these cases. Comparable detection rates have been reported in studies evaluating similar spectrum of respiratory viruses, although those studies referred to different sampling period and population makeup [Miller et al., 2007; Zhang et al., 2009 ]. Influenza was the most prevalent virus detected accounting for nearly half of all viral infections, demonstrating a type and subtype variability from year to year reflecting the predominating virus subtype in the Greek population. HRV was the second more frequently detected virus (19.7%), highlighting it as an important contributor to influenza-like illness, an observation also made by others [Kelly and Birch, 2004; Druce et al., 2005] , although this virus has been usually incriminated in common cold cases in the absence of high fever [Bellei et al., 2008] . HRSV presented similar detection rates to HRV, with subtypes A and B alternating from year to year [Deng et al., 2006] . Its circulation was simultaneous with influenza virus, a phenomenon reported before [Canducci et al., 2008; Fabbiani et al., 2009] . The proportion of positive HAdV samples in Greek pediatric influenza-like illness cases was slightly higher than other studies showed [Echavarria et al., 2006] . HBoV was the fifth most frequently detected virus accounting for 10% of the laboratory-confirmed infections, in line with previous reports [Manning et al., 2006; Lau et al., 2007] . HMPV cases (5.4%) were concordant with previous reports from Northern Greece [Gioula et al., 2010] , while detection of types 229E and OC43 of HCoV, rarely associated with severe respiratory infections in children, amounted to approximately 4.0% of positive cases. A higher prevalence of HCoVs has been reported in infants with acute respiratory disease [Canducci et al., 2008] , however NL63 and HKU1 HCoVs subtypes were also included in that study.",

HRV predominant circulation, before and after the influenza virus peak, has been associated with children returning to school and with weather conditions favoring HRV expansion [Monto, 2002 [Monto, , 2004 , while its high prevalence might have moderated or prevented other viruses from establishing themselves [Greer et al., 2009 ]. On the other hand, it is expected that physicians screening for influenza-like illness would be more likely to swab influenza positive patients during its peak season. HBoV prevalence during the early winter and late spring has been described before [Arnold et al., 2006; Calvo et al., 2010] , however a recent review has indicated that there is no obvious regular seasonal occurrence of the virus [Allander, 2008] .",

Influenza virus predominated in children older than 5 years while HRSV, HMPV and HBoV prevailed in preschool children, an observation also made by others [Manning et al., 2006; Fabbiani et al., 2009 ]. There is a complexity in factors that could explain the observed age patterns and may relate to the host, the socio-economical environment, as well as viral genetic variation. Infant immune system immaturity and/or presence of maternal antibodies were identified as major host determinants [Crowe and Williams, 2003 ]. Presence of siblings, poor living conditions and crowding in schools, are all factors which facilitate the spread of respiratory viruses [Groothuis et al., 2011] . Moreover, viral genetic variation may contribute to the escape of antigenically distinct variants from previously acquired immunity or protective vaccination [Carrat and Flahault, 2007; Kirchberger et al., 2007] .",

However, it is difficult to clearly determine the contribution of HRV to infection, due to the fact that the virus is also detected in asymptomatic control patients [Peltola et al., 2008; Fry et al., 2011] . No potential relative contribution of HRV in mixed infections, with regards to the severity of referral symptoms, was observed, although a similar analysis with regards to the severity of disease progression was not feasible, due to lack of clinical information. Casalegno et al. [2010] studying co-circulation of HRV and pandemic A(H1N1) influenza virus indicated that HRV epidemics may interfere with the spread of the pandemic strain. Similar analysis in this study did not reach statistical significance, although patterns of HRV and seasonal influenza virus were analogous to those reported by Linde et al. [2009] for HRV and the pandemic strain. Undoubtedly, there can be no direct comparison between these studies, because the pattern of spread of pandemic and of seasonal influenza strains was different.",

Interestingly, 20% of the infected HBoV patients presented diarrhea, suggesting that HBoV-related disease may extend beyond the respiratory to the gastrointestinal tract, defining it also, as a possible enteric pathogen [Kahn, 2007; Neske et al., 2007; Pozo et al., 2007] . Moreover, as emesis was present in one third of influenza-like illness HCoV-positive patients, it might be a useful potential indicator of HCoV infection in children. It is also worth mentioning that HAdV disease came along with significantly high proportion of emesis, diarrhea, and abdominal pain, which may reveal the existence of HAdV species affecting the enteric tract, although these types in respiratory specimens have rarely been published [Echavarria et al., 2006] . Finally, although mixed viral infections have been associated with more severe cases of respiratory infections in infants [Richard et al., 2008; Semple et al., 2005] , our study was not designed to reveal such differences in disease severity, if any. This study, carried over the winter period of three consecutive years, provides useful epidemiological data about respiratory virus circulation, establishing the major contribution of influenza virus, HRV and HRSV to influenza-like illness in Greek children. To our knowledge this is the most comprehensive study to date of the etiologic agents associated with influenza-like illness in Greece. These results demonstrate that a wide range of respiratory pathogens are circulating in Greece and this fact needs to be considered by clinicians when treating patients reporting with influenza-like illness.",
