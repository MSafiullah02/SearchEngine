Biochemical investigations showed lymphopenia (white cell count 8 \u00d7 109/L [normal range] and lymphocyte count 0.67 \u00d7 109/L). Platelet count, procalcitonin and lactate dehydrogenase were normal. Computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen and pelvis confirmed the diagnosis of acute appendicitis and the presence of a 7-mm appendicolith at its base, precluding any trial of conservative management.

The mesoappendix was dissected, appendiceal artery ligated, and appendix was ligated at its base. Peritoneal washings were also collected prior to the end of the case and sent for COVID-19 PCR. The pneumoperitoneum was safely evacuated via a closed suction system before trocar removal and specimen extraction. Absorbable sutures and surgical skin glue dressing were utilized for ease of post-operative wound assessment and care. Operative time was 60 min.",
