The prevalence of ICUAW varies widely depending on factors such as the presence of sepsis and multi-organ failure [2\u201314]. Weakness may be related to deconditioning (weakness without electrophysiologic abnormalities) or critical illness polyneuromyopathy (CIPNM; weakness with electrophysiologic abnormalities) [6, 9, 10, 15, 16]. Differentiating deconditioning from CIPNM is clinically important, as these two groups of patients have different outcomes and distinct courses of recovery [17].",

NCS of a single motor nerve (such as the peroneal, also known as fibular, nerve) or sensory nerve (such as the sural nerve) may be a relatively accurate screening test for CIPNM [11\u201313]. The advantages of single NCS include shorter testing duration (5\u201310 min vs 60\u201390 min for full NCS/EMG), noninvasiveness, and no need for volitional patient movement. Electrophysiologic abnormalities are associated with deleterious outcomes in critically ill patients, even in the absence of weakness [17, 19]. However, a prior study examining the accuracy of single peroneal and sural NCS as screening tests for CIPNM focused almost exclusively on patients with severe sepsis [11]. Therefore, the generalizability of the accuracy of single NCS in screening for CIPNM is relatively unknown. Muscle ultrasound is also a promising technique to diagnose weakness by examining decreases in muscle thickness or changes in appearance (increased echogenicity) [20\u201334]. Muscle ultrasound has the potential advantage of being a relatively quick and noninvasive test that utilizes equipment present in most intensive care units (ICUs). However, the accuracy of ultrasound changes in muscle thickness or echogenicity to diagnose CIPNM remains unclear, and it is unknown if ultrasound provides prognostic information beyond that obtained from NCS/EMG.",

Repetitive stimulation of the median motor nerve was performed to exclude neuromuscular junction defects, and F-waves were recorded from the tibial nerves to screen for proximal nerve root disease (e.g., Guillain-Barre Syndrome). The bilateral sural, radial, and median sensory NCS were recorded using standard procedures [11]. The bilateral peroneal, tibial, and median motor NCS were recorded using surface electrodes over the extensor digitorum brevis, abductor hallucis brevis, and abductor pollicis brevis muscles, respectively. The compound motor action potential (CMAP) responses were elicited from standard distal and proximal sites of stimulation to calculate a conduction velocity and to assess for the presence of conduction block or temporal dispersion. After reviewing the studies and excluding patients with defects in neuromuscular transmission or primary/acquired demyelination, the sensory nerve action potential (SNAP) and CMAP amplitudes were analyzed for abnormalities. Unilateral concentric needle EMG examination was then performed on two upper extremity and two lower extremity muscles, one proximal and one distal in each limb, assessing insertional activity, spontaneous activity, activation, motor unit potential morphology, and recruitment pattern. NCS and EMG are prone to differences in interexaminer reliability but maintain high intraexaminer reliability [36]. Therefore, all NCS/EMG examinations were performed by one electrophysiology-trained physician, who was not blinded to the results of the index tests or reference standard.",

We measured muscle thickness and echogenicity in the axial plane (perpendicular to the underlying bone or interosseous membrane) while avoiding compression of overlying soft tissues. To quantify muscle echogenicity, we utilized the visual four-point Heckmatt score that correlates with clinical and histologic neuromyopathy [29, 33]. All muscle ultrasounds were performed before NCS/EMG by one trained examiner to minimize issues of interexaminer reliability. Only medical, cardiac and surgical ICU patients underwent weekly muscle ultrasound due to machine availability.

Patients were diagnosed with CIPNM if they had: 1) SNAP amplitudes less than 80% of the lower limit of normal in two or more nerves; and 2) CMAP amplitudes less than 80% of the lower limit of normal in two or more nerves without conduction block. NCS were categorized as normal or abnormal using standard normal values for the electrophysiology laboratory (normal amplitude > 1 mV for the peroneal nerve and > 10 \u03bcV for the sural nerve). We used this purely electrophysiologic definition of CIPNM (hereafter referred to as probable CIPNM) as our reference standard as we anticipated that most patients would not be awake and able to participate in voluntary MRC and EMG testing [8]. If the patient could participate in testing, MRC and EMG were used to classify the diagnosis definitively as neuropathy, myopathy, both, or neither. For patients diagnosed with probable CIPNM, the electrophysiological testing results at the time the diagnostic criteria were fulfilled were used in all analyses. For the remaining patients who did not meet the diagnostic criteria for probable CIPNM, data from their last electrophysiological tests were used in all analyses. Muscle ultrasound does not have established cutoffs to define abnormal changes in muscle thickness or echogenicity that are associated with CIPNM. We thus evaluated whether decreased muscle ultrasound thickness or increased echogenicity were accurate screening tests for probable CIPNM and if these muscle ultrasound abnormalities added prognostic information on patient outcomes to that obtained from NCS/EMG. We built a multivariable regression model with selected predictors of age (continuous variable), gender (binary variable), SOFA score for disease severity (continuous), CIPNM status (probable CIPNM vs none, binary), and muscle ultrasound echogenicity (abnormal vs normal, binary). The main predicted outcome for assessing the incremental prognostic information conveyed by muscle ultrasound was hospital discharge disposition (home vs not home) using a nominal logistic regression model with coefficient statistical significance assessed using a Wald test. We also examined the outcomes of ICU-free days and ICU mortality in secondary analyses.",

A muscle ultrasound echogenicity score in any muscle of at least 2 out of 4 had a sensitivity of 82% (95% CI 48\u201398%) and specificity of 57% (95% CI 43\u201370%) for diagnosing probable CIPNM compared with the reference standard, along with a positive predictive value of 27% and negative predictive value of 94% (Additional file 3: Figure S3).

Increased echogenicity was associated with a reduced likelihood of discharge to home (9% vs 50%, p = 0.0001) and fewer ICU-free days (3 (IQR 0\u201315) vs 16 (9.3\u201319.3), p = 0.0002) along with increased ICU mortality (42% vs 12%, p = 0.004).

For the secondary outcomes, there were no significant associations between abnormal muscle ultrasound echogenicity and ICU-free days or ICU mortality.

Using an amplitude cutoff value from receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves of 0.65 mV for the peroneal CMAP and 4 \u03bcV for the sural SNAP, the unilateral peroneal motor nerve was 94% sensitive and 74% specific and the sural sensory nerve was 94% sensitive and 70% specific for diagnosing CIPNM. Latronico et al. also explored the use of unilateral peroneal motor NCS as a screening test for CIPNM in a diverse ICU population and validated the results in a primarily neurological ICU population. This group also found the peroneal nerve to have excellent sensitivity (100%) for CIPNM diagnosis with good specificity (67\u201385%) [12, 13]. Our study validates those prior results and demonstrates their generalizability to a broader critically ill patient population including patients with sepsis, neurologic emergency, and postoperative respiratory failure. As one of the longest nerves in the body, the utility of the peroneal nerve for diagnosing CIPNM may be partially explained by its vulnerability to tissue ischemia [13].",

Even in the presence of critical illness and edema, muscle thickness measurements at the biceps, mid-forearm, and mid-thigh correlate well with lean body mass [27, 30]. Muscle thickness decreases faster in critically ill patients with multi-organ failure [31].

The physician performing the electrophysiologic tests was unblinded, although muscle ultrasound was always performed before NCS/EMG at each weekly visit so that electrophysiologic testing results would not influence ultrasound interpretation. Since peroneal and sural NCS results were included as part of the reference standard criteria for probable CIPNM and both the index and reference tests were performed by the same specialist, the study was at risk of incorporation bias, which may lead to overestimation of diagnostic accuracy of our screening tests. We did not perform nerve or muscle biopsies, but it is impractical to perform these invasive procedures in most critically ill patients. It is possible that some of the changes in muscle echogenicity were due to edema, but fluid overload itself may still be harmful [44]. The prevalence of probable CIPNM in our study was 18%, which was slightly lower than the 20% prevalence we expected in our sample size calculations and led to wider confidence intervals for index test sensitivity. We could not perform MRC strength testing due to altered mental status in the majority of study visits, consistent with prior literature demonstrating that most prolonged mechanically ventilated patients are unable to perform manual muscle testing [18]. The inability to perform manual muscle testing gives NCS and muscle ultrasound a potential advantage, as these tests require no active patient cooperation.",

Compared with full four-limb NCS/EMG, unilateral single nerve NCS is quicker, less painful for the patient, and could facilitate the diagnosis of CIPNM. The peroneal CMAP amplitude is 100- to 1000-times larger than the sural SNAP amplitude and is thus easier to find in ICUs that frequently have electrical interference. However, an abnormal peroneal or sural NCS requires follow-up with full NCS/EMG (and ideally muscle strength testing) to confirm a CIPNM diagnosis. Abnormal muscle echogenicity is a good screening test for probable CIPNM and provides additional prognostic information to NCS/EMG. Simplifying the diagnosis of CIPNM with single nerve NCS or muscle ultrasound would have a dramatic impact on clinical practice, leading to earlier diagnosis and increased recognition of CIPNM, better prognostication for patients and families, and more targeted use of treatments such as physical therapy.",
