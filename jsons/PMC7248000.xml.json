A total of 72 questions were initially drafted and sent out to the UroSoMe working group. All feedback received was reviewed by the steering committee, and the questions were further refined until consensus was reached. At the end of the development process, a total of 55 questions were finalised for this survey. The final questionnaire comprised 55 items covering demographics (eight items), impact of COVID-19 on health care professionals and hospital policy (25 items), outpatient clinic (six items), outpatient investigations and procedures (six items), and urological surgeries (eight items), and attitudes towards the of COVID-19 (two items).

The secondary outcome was the duration of delay in urological services. Demographic data and impact of COVID-19 on health care professionals and hospital policy were presented in a descriptive manner. Chi-square test was used for comparison between continents. Heat maps were created to analyse the global impact of COVID-19 on urological services by geographical location. Based on the respondents\u2019 answers to the questions on cut-down of services (ie, 0%, 1\u201320%, 21\u201340%, 41\u201360%, 61\u201380%, and 81\u2013100%), mean scores were calculated for each individual country and were presented in global maps with a scale of 0\u2013100%. We made two assumptions for countries without any respondents: (1) they were assumed to have zero cut-down if there were no reported cases of COVID-19 in their countries and (2) they were assumed to have a similar degree of cut-down to the other countries within the same subgroup based on the WHO classification for global assessment of disease burden [9]. Next, we analysed the impact of COVID-19 on urological services by the degree of outbreak, which was determined by the cumulative number of new cases in each respondent's country at the time of the survey. The respondents were categorised into five groups based on their percentiles of COVID-19 cases (ie, 0\u201320, 21\u201340, 41\u201360, 61\u201380, and 81\u2013100 percentile). The relationship between the cut-down of urological services and the degree of outbreak was presented using bar charts. We further analysed the impact of COVID-19 on urological services by the nature and urgency of urological conditions. Outpatient clinics, outpatient urological investigations and procedures, and urological surgeries were categorised as \u201cbenign and nonurgent\u201d, \u201cbenign but potentially urgent\u201d, and \u201cmalignant\u201d based on the urological conditions of interest. \u201cUreteric stone\u201d was classified as \u201cbenign but potentially urgent\u201d because it may affect the kidney function if definitive treatment is delayed. \u201cRenal transplantation\u201d was classified as \u201cbenign but potentially urgent\u201d because the availability of cadaveric graft kidney is unpredictable and organ harvest cannot be delayed. \u201cExtracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy\u201d (ESWL) was classified as \u201cbenign but potentially urgent\u201d as it is a common treatment modality for ureteric stone. The results were illustrated using bar charts. Information on the delay of urological services and the attitudes of health care professionals towards the impact of delay were presented in a descriptive manner. We took reference from the literature and decided to use 8 wk as a cut-off for delay in urological services [10]. All demographic data were complete without missing data. We had missing data on the outcome variables, but we did not perform any regression analysis. Hence, we used complete case analysis as the primary analysis, and imputation was not performed [11], [12]. No weighting was considered in our data analysis.",

Of the respondents, 60% were expecting a pay cut due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In the outpatient clinic setting, the patients were advised to wear a mask in 52% of the hospitals; health care professionals were advised to wear PPE in 56% of the hospitals. Patients were routinely asked about or checked for fever (75%), upper respiratory infection symptoms (80%), and travel, occupation, contact, and cluster (TOCC) history (66%) before consultation, urological investigations, and surgeries.

The survey was available only in English, and this may introduce a biased representation of English-speaking countries. As this survey was conducted in the midst of the pandemic, it is also possible that urologists in some of the most heavily involved regions were involved in the emergency response and unable to participate. Furthermore, even within individual countries, there are large regional differences in COVID-19 prevalence. Unfortunately, our sample size precludes the ability to provide more granular data beyond the continent or country level. Moreover, cut-down of services may be a result of government shutdown polices, and this was not adequately covered by our survey. In order to provide a timely report on the current COVID-19 situation, we spent a total of 9 d only for data collection. Although we have collected >1000 responses, this number is considered low given the large number of organisations being involved in this survey. Despite these limitations, this study provides an initial global perspective on the impact of COVID-19 on urological practice and care. Future studies should be conducted to re-examine the impact of COVID-19 in urology with additional follow-up.",

The diversion of personnel in order to facilitate the COVID-19 emergency response has affected the maintenance of urology departmental activities. A substantial proportion of urologists reported insufficient training and protective equipment. In terms of patient care, significant cut-down was observed in urology clinics, outpatient procedures, and major surgeries, corresponding to the degree of outbreak. Benign urological conditions were more affected than malignant urological conditions. The long-term repercussions on the urological patients\u2019 outcome from the deferred diagnosis and treatment remain to be defined.",
