Historically, RNA viruses produced in cell cultures have been identified using electron microscopy, in which virus identification is performed by eye. Such an approach is time consuming and depends on manual controls. Moreover, detailed knowledge about RNA viruses is required. This study introduces the Entropy-Adaptive Network Based Fuzzy Inference System (Entropy-ANFIS method), which can be used to automatically detect RNA virus images. This system consists of four stages: pre-processing, feature extraction, classification and testing the Entropy-ANFIS method with respect to the correct classification ratio. In the pre-processing stage, a center-edge changing method is used, in which the Euclidian distances are calculated from the center pixels to the edges of the imaged object. In this way, the distance vector is obtained. This calculation is repeated for each RNA virus image. In feature extraction, stage norm entropy, logarithmic energy and threshold entropy values are calculated to form the feature vector. The obtained feature vector is independent of the rotation and scale of the RNA virus image. In the classification stage, the feature vector is given as input to the ANFIS classifier, ANN classifier and FCM cluster. Finally, the test stage is performed to evaluate the correct classification ratio of the Entropy-ANFIS algorithm for the RNA virus images. The correct classification ratio has been determined as 95.12% using the proposed Entropy-ANFIS method.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "Technological developments have progressed rapidly in recent years.
