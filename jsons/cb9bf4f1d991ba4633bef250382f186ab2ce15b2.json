In Grade V and VI Bell's palsy according to the House-Brackmann grading system, a week's course of oral corticosteroids is recommended. Corticosteroid therapy is also recommended in cases of sudden hearing loss of more than 60 dB, either in the form of intratympanic injections or a week's course of oral medication. In rhinology, there is no indication for systemic corticosteroid therapy in the current situation. However, patients are advised to continue with their local corticosteroid therapy in the form of a nasal spray or by inhalation.

These types of anosmia usually have a good prognosis. Studies are ongoing concerning the possible advantage of using corticosteroids for this indication, but in the current state of knowledge they cannot be recommended. With other pathologies, there is no indication for systemic corticosteroid therapy in the current situation, especially in cases of nasosinusal polyposis or infectious or very painful sinusitis. However, patients are advised to continue with their usual local corticosteroid therapy as a nasal spray or by inhalation. Treatments with corticosteroid nasal sprays can still be prescribed if there is no other therapeutic alternative.

In the absence of scientific publications concerning the possible risks of corticosteroid therapy during the COVID-19 pandemic, AFON and SFORL plan to restrict its indications to ENT pathologies for which efficacy is best established. In cases of Bell's palsy, the efficacy of corticosteroids is well established [2] . In the current pandemic situation, the therapeutic indication should be adapted to the severity of the symptoms. In incomplete forms, it is not advisable to commence treatment with drugs. Only eye care should be prescribed. In severe forms (grades V-VI according to the House-Brackmann grading system) and in the absence of any of the symptoms associated with COVID-19 (fever, cough, headaches, myalgia, anosmia",

The indications for diagnostic tests prior to treatment are likely to change over the course of the next few weeks or months as and when new more effective diagnostic tests arrive, in particular serological ones. An oral antiviral treatment (Valaciclovir 3 grams/day) could also be prescribed in cases of shingles [4] . Oral corticosteroid therapy can usually be administered at home under the supervision of a general practitioner. Admission to hospital should be discussed in cases of unstable insulin-dependent diabetes, unstable heart disease undergoing treatment, eye disease, miscellaneous other comorbidities or old age. In subsequent treatment, ophthalmological monitoring should be set up and an ENT teleconsultation scheduled one month after corticosteroid therapy, ideally in the form of a remote consultation. In cases of facial paralysis combined with symptoms of COVID-19, the diagnostic tests to be performed and setting up of corticosteroid therapy if applicable should be discussed locally on a case-by-case basis with the team responsible for diagnosing and caring for COVIDpositive patients.",

In the current situation, the indications for this type of treatment should be limited to severe forms with unilateral hearing loss of more than 60 dB, especially in cases of a single functioning ear, and in the absence of any clinical symptoms of COVID-19. We recommend proposing transtympanic corticosteroid injections rather than systemic treatment. Wherever possible, in order to reduce the risks of contaminating patients with SARS-CoV-2, this treatment should be conducted in an ENT clinic rather than in hospital. As in cases of facial paralysis and for the same reasons, admission to hospital should be discussed in cases of unstable insulin-dependent diabetes, unstable heart disease undergoing treatment, eye disease, miscellaneous other comorbidities or old age. Routinely carrying out RT-PCR tests on nasopharyngeal swabs before starting corticosteroid therapy is not recommended. The progression of the hearing loss should ideally be monitored by remote consultation [5] . A scan or other necessary examination should be prescribed in order to assess the cause. In cases of sudden hearing loss combined with symptoms of COVID-19, the diagnostic tests to be performed and setting up of corticosteroid therapy if applicable should be discussed locally on a case-by-case basis with the team responsible for diagnosing and caring for COVID-positive patients.",

When assessing acute facial paralysis during the COVID-19 pandemic, remote consultation with video communication should be prioritized so that the patient can be interviewed, inspected, and guided to palpate their own face and neck. Whether the paralysis is peripheral or central should be assessed, as well as its severity and the condition of the eye (impossible to close, pain, redness). Among the other anomalies to look out for, consider the presence of signs of infection, dizziness, headaches, associated neurological signs such as hemicorporeal motor deficit or damage to other cranial nerves, a burning sensation or vesicular rash in the concha suggestive of shingles of the geniculate ganglion, parotidomasseteric or cervical swelling suggesting the possibility of a malignant parotid tumour. If remote consultation does not lead to a diagnosis of idiopathic or herpetic facial paralysis, a face-to-face consultation is desirable, taking all the necessary precautions to prevent contamination of healthcare staff and patients[1]. This consultation should, if applicable, be preceded by an MRI of the facial nerve pathway.",
