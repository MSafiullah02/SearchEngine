The SARS-CoV-2 virus spread exponentially across the globe, and the World Health Organization declared it as a pandemic in March 2020 (1) . The treatment of COVID-19 infection remains largely supportive; several treatment modalities have been proposed including the aminoquinolines, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine. Both these drugs have been extensively used to treat malaria, systemic lupus erythematosus, and rheumatoid arthritis. There has been increasing interest in the possible efficacy of these agents in COVID-19 infection, considering their anti-inflammatory and antiviral effects in vitro (2) . The Food and Drug Administration in the US authorized emergency use of these drugs in the treatment of COVID-19 infection in March 2020, followed by extensive use across the world (3) . Hydroxychloroquine has a more potent antiviral effect and may be safer compared to chloroquine (4) and hence is more commonly used in clinical practice. Following an early report from Marseilles, France (5), which revealed more rapid viral clearance, there has been increasing interest in the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine in COVID-19 infection. However, many of these studies are limited by the lack of a control arm and are inadequate to draw definitive conclusions (6, 7) .",

In the RCT by Zhaowei et al., with 31 patients each in the hydroxychloroquine and control arms, worsening of pneumonia was observed in 4 of 31 (12.9%) patients in the control group compared to none in the hydroxychloroquine group (16) . In another RCT, Tang et al. reported no symptomatic improvement with hydroxychloroquine in 30 of 75 (40%) patients compared to 25 of 75 (33.3%) patients who received standard care (17) . Heterogeneity between studies in the assessment of clinical progression was minimal (I 2 = 39%); hence we analyzed the results using a fixed-effects model. Clinical worsening or lack of symptomatic improvement did not differ between patients who received hydroxychloroquine compared to those who received standard care alone (OR 1.1, 95% CI: 0.6-2.02; p = 0.76) ( Figure 4 ). Viral clearance by RT-PCR was reported at different time points in four studies (5, 10, 17, 18) . Two studies reported on negative conversion of RT-PCR by 7 days (5,18), while the other two studies reported at 14 and 28 days (10, 17) . There was substantial heterogeneity between studies (I 2 = 65%); hence we used a random-effects model in the evaluation of this outcome.

These studies tested RT-PCR at different points in time; Chen et al. reported no difference in viral clearance rates on the 7 th day of treatment (18) . Tang et al., in their RCT, found no difference in the primary endpoint of the rate of RT-PCR negativity at 28 days with hydroxychloroquine treatment (17) .
