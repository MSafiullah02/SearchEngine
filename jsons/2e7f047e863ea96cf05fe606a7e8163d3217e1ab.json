SARS-CoV-2 is a \u00df-corona virus, first identified in Wuhan, China. Recently world health organisation (WHO) declared COVID-19 as a pandemic. As of 25 March 2020, there were nearly 18 440 deaths occurred worldwide due to COVID-19. However, there are no clinically approved vaccines or therapeutic agents are available for treating COVID-19 [5, 6] . Researchers, therefore, focused on discovery of novel anti-viral agents against this pandemic. However, high attrition rates, substantial costs and slow pace are the major limitations for discovery of new drugs against this emerging pandemic [7] .",
