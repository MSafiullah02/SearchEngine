This is especially the case if the volume of complaints remains low and therefore less easy for the public to identify. Thus today, a passive regulatory approach of relying solely on public input may be insufficient given the rapidity that information is spread on the internet.",

While this approach is still evolving in many sectors, proactive monitoring has been used effectively within law enforcement to monitor and detect illegal activity on the internet for decades and continues to be recommended [20\u201322]. A similar approach for monitoring healthcare professions could address many of the issues that arise with traditional, time-consuming methods of regulation that rely solely on public reporting [23].",

This software, known as the Marketing Review Tool (MRT), scans websites and social media activity of all chiropractors in British Columbia. The software specifically searches for pre-defined words from a target list approved and maintained by the CCBC. Using this target list, searches performed by the MRT are made twice per month for websites, daily for social media and on demand as required. Following a search, the software returns cases where a word from the target list is identified. The CCBC then manually categorizes these cases into A) acceptable use of the target word (e.g. \u201cour office is closed during the COVID crisis\u201d) and B) unacceptable use (e.g. \"chiropractic can boost immunity). For any case deemed unacceptable, the chiropractor(s) registered with the website or social media account is sent a notice to remediate the questionable material immediately (e.g. deletion of content). A MRT scan can then be performed multiple times to determine the rate at which compliance is achieved. When the stated deadline for mandatory compliance is reached, a follow up scan can then be performed and final compliance determined. Any non-compliant activity is then dealt with by the CCBC who forwards these cases to its inquiry committee.",

After review by the CCBC to eliminate acceptable use of target words (e.g. wash your hands frequently during the COVID crisis), 97 cases were inappropriate in their use of the word \u201cimmune\u201d. No inappropriate cases were identified for use of \u201ccorona\u201d or \u201ccovid\u201d. Notices to remove inappropriate material were emailed in March 2020. Subsequent MRT scans showed that the majority of registrants responded promptly and removed questionable content. As of March 31, 2020, there were 7 sites yet to comply and the names of registrants associated with these sites were passed to the CCBC inquiry committee for further investigation.",
