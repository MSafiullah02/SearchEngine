It applies an individualistic model of self-defence for state action and uses it to illuminate the constraints on public health compulsion of proportionality and using the least restrictive alternative. It next shows how a self-defence account should not be rejected on the basis of past abuses. The paper then considers two possible limits to a self-defence justification: compulsion of the non-culpable and over-inclusive compulsion. The paper claims that objections to compelling the non-culpable do not greatly restrict the scope of the self-defence justification. The over-included are, however, innocent bystanders, and methods such as compulsory quarantine, vaccination, and screening are not justified in self-defence.",

The paper draws on the large philosophical and legal literature on self-defence, which admittedly is usually concerned with contexts that are rather different from public health, such as war and private responses to threats of violence. 3 The aim of the first part of the paper is to show that, nonetheless, self-defence offers a distinctive and valuable justification of public health compulsion. It will explain how selfdefence illuminates the generally accepted constraints on compulsion of proportionality and using the least restrictive alternative. It will also show that, contrary to how self-defence has been used in 1 public health reasoning in the past, the considerations adduced here do not support such abuses as compulsory sterilization or murder for eugenic purposes. The aim of the later part of the paper, once self-defence has been shown to be a distinctive and valuable justification in public health, is to explore its limits. It considers the problem of self-defence against those not responsible for their conditions, and finds no significant limit here to the application of self-defence to public health. It does claim, though, that self-defence does not justify a cluster of measures, including compulsory quarantine, that are over-inclusive in that they predictably affect the non-contagious.",

            "text": "There are some assumptions and caveats. First, an explanation of 'public health compulsion\u00d5. Because the focus of this paper is on contagious disease, it does not get to grips with current controversy in public health about the ethics of steering people into healthy behaviour. So 'public health compulsion\u00d5 is shorthand for 'compulsion that aims to protect people from contagious disease\u00d5. 'Compul-sion\u00d5 is used to cover putative infringements of rights. It is an imperfect term -it does not suit breaches of confidentiality particularly well, for instance -and loose, covering coercion, force, and manipulation. But I do not know of a better term. Second, the paper is concerned with compulsion that appears likely to infringe on personal rights, such as rights of bodily integrity, freedom of movement and association, confidentiality, and privacy. The paper does not discuss infringements on property rights or the regulation of business. Third, this paper assumes that people normally do have these personal rights. 4 The rights can be waived, for instance when a person consents to medical treatment, and when rights are waived, they are not breached; but we shall be considering only cases where the rights have not been waived. Fourth, the paper is about ethics, rather than law, and it consequently has no particular geographical focus. Nor is it concerned with technical questions about whether the legality of public health compulsion can be 4 Other rights might also be relevant. Some believe that a right to religious freedom supports a right not to be vaccinated, although this is controversial. established on the basis of self-defence in criminal or tort law. Fifth, the paper is concerned with the relatively abstract question of the relation of self-defence to public health. Before reaching practical answers in actual cases, one would need more detail about the facts and about the specific rights in question. That said, the paper does help with working out the right kinds of questions for public health officials to ask. Finally, this paper assumes that people are entitled, under certain circumstances, to use force to defend themselves against serious threats to their life and health. This assumption is in line with common sense and the philosophical literature. Although there is widespread agreement about some of the features of self-defence, there is also significant disagreement about its foundations and its application in certain instances. Since our topic is the ethics of public health compulsion and not the correct account of self-defence, I shall largely try to avoid these disputes by sidestepping them and by using generally accepted views within accounts of self-defence.",

            "text": "Consider a familiar example in modern moral philosophy. Suppose the only way in which one can save five patients is by giving each a transplant, and suppose the only source for the transplants is a healthy friendless man who appears for a check-up. Each of the five would live happily for many years following a transplant and usually it is worse if five lives are lost than if one life is lost. Nonetheless, virtually everyone thinks that it would not be permissible to kill the man and reallocate his organs in order to save the lives of five patients. The man has a right not to be killed, and this outweighs the greater gain of saving a net four lives. 5 One lesson from this example is that we should not rest content with defending public health compulsion, in simple-minded utilitarian fashion, by saying 'it does more good than harm\u00d5. People\u00d5s rights constrain the pursuit of the greater good. This is not to say that rights may never be overridden for the sake of the greater good but that, if they may, this is only when the good considerably outweighs the harm of the rights infringement. So much is agreed upon by many rights theorists. Nor is the point limited to rights to life. We may not even compulsorily remove part of the man\u00d5s liver, imposing a small risk of death, to save a life. If the present topic is framed as one of public health versus rights, then it is going to be hard to justify public health compulsion. Now compare self-defence. If someone is about to attack and kill me, I may in self-defence use deadly force, if necessary. Using deadly force is a justification, not an excuse; that is, the threat to life makes the use of force morally permissible rather than merely removing some of the liability to blame or punishment. Still more justifiably may I inflict a partial-liver-removal-sized amount of harm to save my own life. Hence self-defence differs significantly from overriding rights to do good. And if it can be applied to contagious disease, it would justify restrictions that would otherwise be ruled out by people\u00d5s rights.",

Arguably, the recent literature on self-defence has had a somewhat distorting focus on deadly force and, in particular, on cases where what is at stake is the life of either the threat or of the person acting in self-defence. In the first place, decisions about public health are not made under certainty; and although this is true of virtually any decision about self-defence (where the gun might misfire, for instance), the recent literature on self-defence has not taken much account of the difference uncertainty makes. Putting that aside, public health compulsion, unlike the standard forced choice in the self-defence literature, does not involve killing and does involve more than two people. Perhaps it would be permissible to, for example, quarantine or breach confidentiality, although not kill, to avoid the spread of contagious disease. But as already mentioned, the extra weighting for rights is a weighting for all rights, not just those to life, and so the general point remains. There is an important difference between saying 'public health compulsion is justified for the sake of the overall good\u00d5 and 'public health compulsion is justified in self-defence\u00d5.",

Public health compulsion is not a matter of one individual using force against another who threatens her with infection. It consists of acts by the state to protect people from the contagious. However, the move from individual self-defence to state collective defence is a smooth one. When the state uses compulsion to protect people from contagious disease, it functions as a third party, and the principles underlying self-defence permit third parties to inflict harm on threats in otherdefence. That other-defence is permitted is not especially controversial. If someone is deliberately trying to shoot you, an innocent person, then it is permissible for me to save you by killing the threat myself. Indeed, the role of the state as third party defender is more easily justified than private self-or other-defence because some of the worries about private defence, such as a lack of due process, need not apply to the actions of the state.",

It says that the state is authorized to act against threats to people\u00d5s safety because it acts as a third party defender of them. This is the classic account, within the Lockean tradition in political philosophy, of the authority of the state. 6 Many within that tradition also claim that the authority of the state is limited to what can be derived from the protection of individual rights, but this paper makes no claim to characterize completely the normative relation of state to citizen. The claim is just that principles of individual self-defence are at least one source of the authority of the state to use compulsion to protect individuals against contagious disease. Note that this is not an argument by analogy from the rights that individuals have to defend themselves to the right that a state has. The argument is that these very rights that individuals have are the source of the state\u00d5s authority in this matter.",

The first is individualistic, the second what might be called, slippery again, 'collec-tive\u00d5 or 'communitarian\u00d5. Even if state compulsion aims to protect very large numbers of people from disease, it aims to protect them from an aggregate of individual harms. By contrast, 'collective\u00d5 or 'community\u00d5 does not refer merely to 'large numbers of people\u00d5. Collective or communitarian harms are not individual because the harms, for instance to a way of life, are not reducible to the properties of individuals. The account offered here, based as it is on individual rights of self-defence, is concerned only with the state\u00d5s use of public health compulsion to protect against such individual harms as being infected with HIV, influenza, TB, and so on.

If public health compulsion can be justified as selfdefence, this parallel provides some theoretical explanation of why officials must choose the least restrictive alternative. But the parallel also explains why this constraint should not be taken literally. According to the constraint, once we know which measures will achieve some roughly equal amount of public health, the least restrictive should be chosen. But what if there is a slightly less restrictive alternative that is much more expensive? Intuitively, some trade offs between restrictions and economic cost are morally permissible, and may be legally permissible too, in the US at least. 9 The comparison with the minimum force requirement provides some justification of this intuition. If I can avoid your attack then I ought to do that, rather than use force in self-defence. The background context is, however, an entitlement to defend my rights against a threat. There are limits to the costs I can be required to absorb. I do not have to flee to Australia and change my identity, for instance. 10 For reasons of fairness in allocating costs, the idea of minimum force, like the requirement to choose the least restrictive alternative, should not be taken literally.",

In self-defence, proportionality does not require that the use of force in self-defence averts more harm than it causes.

Massachusetts 197 US 11 (1905) . 12 In this decision, which upheld a law requiring vaccination for smallpox, Justice Harlan wrote: 'Upon the principle of self-defense, of paramount necessity, a community has the right to protect itself against an epidemic of disease which threatens the safety of its members.\u00d5 13 For all that self-defence has occasionally been used in legal and policy reasoning about public health, I make no claims for the account offered here on the basis of this pedigree.

            "text": "Let us remind ourselves of some common sense constraints on self-defence. One may only act in self-defence against a genuine threat, which splits into two separate constraints: what is threatened must indeed be bad; and the threat must be likely to produce that bad thing. Moreover, the way in which one acts in self-defence must have some reasonable likelihood of forestalling that threat. The coercive eugenic policies lumped together here fail to satisfy some or all of these constraints. It is a familiar objection to eugenics as historically practised that it ignored value pluralism and made insupportable claims about what is bad. Thus for at least some cases, a self-defence argument fails because coercion does not forestall anything bad. Contrast this with, say, self-defence against catching TB, about which probably no one has a good word to say. In addition, the underlying science of eugenics was so inept that there was no good reason to think that the people being harmed were likely to produce bad effects or that the measures were a good way of avoiding them. Thus any attempt to argue from self-defence to the actual historical excesses would be a dismal failure. And even if we put all this aside, the measures taken fail to satisfy the further constraints of the least restrictive alternative and proportionality. 15 All this is enough to show that the self-defence account given here cannot be used (but can perhaps be abused) to justify the enormities of the past. Still, it is worth going on a bit to remind ourselves of what the self-defence account in this paper is -and is not -claiming. Recall that the account of self-defence here is individualistic. There is a significant difference between claims about the contagious diseases against which people are to be protected and the claims about sapping social strength or race defilement. This is the difference between individual harms, and collective or community harms (or 'harms\u00d5). The alleged harms that were supposed to be avoided by these eugenic excesses of self-defence are largely harms in a non-individualistic sense. 16 It is society that has its strength sapped; the Volk that is weakened. There might or might not be a sound account of self-defence that justifies compulsion to protect against non-individualistic harms, but that is not the account offered here. The individualistic account offered here would not justify compulsion against these non-individualistic harms.",

Perhaps quarantining this person shows everyone else that the state means business, and they comply all the better. Perhaps by quarantining the innocent bystander, the state can flush out of hiding a relative who is contagious. There seems to be a clear moral difference between acting 17 Judith Jarvis Thomson, 'Self-Defense\u00d5, Philosophy and Public Affairs 20/4 (1991), 283-310, pp. 298-9. 18 against a threat and acting against someone not causally involved. It may be permissible to override the rights of the innocent bystander but this overriding would be, first, not acting in selfdefence, and second, likely to require a lot more good to be done for a given restriction than it would if it could be justified in selfdefence. The ambiguity in 'preventing harm\u00d5 is one reason why it is important not to rely on a quick application of a harm to others principle. (Another is that the harm to others principle should not be quickly applied to anything.) 19 COMPULSION AND NON-RESPONSIBLE THREATS Self-defence and public health compulsion seem most straightforwardly justifiable against people who are culpable threats, that is, people who would intentionally spread disease, or recklessly ignore the risks, or negligently fail to find out what the risks are. People who are culpable threats impose risks in a way that makes them morally blameworthy. If it comes to a choice of letting them impose these risks or instead imposing costs on them through defensive measures, then it is fairer, other things equal, to make the culpable threats bear the costs. 20 A classic example is someone who knows she has a sexually transmitted disease and has unprotected sex without informing partners of her status. At least for the culpable, public health compulsion can be justified through self-defence without resorting to the ideas of overriding rights or doing the most good. It might be thought, though, that many of those with contagious disease are not culpable threats. Some might be responsible for acquiring their conditions, but not culpable, such as medical staff who become infected while caring for the sick. Still others might not be responsible for their conditions at all.",

This seems significantly different from a case where we can estimate the probability that someone is a threat based on her membership in a group that poses a threat. Public health has many such cases. Quarantining, as opposed to isolation, is one example. Isolation is the confinement of a person with symptoms, but quarantine is the confinement of someone merely exposed, who might then not go on to become infected. If an entire apartment complex is quarantined, then it is likely that some of the quarantined people are uninfected and causally pose no threat. Widespread compulsory testing and screening provides other examples. In the event of an influenza pandemic, governments might compulsorily test arrivals at borders for symptoms. If so, some of those tested would causally pose no threat. Some people would like all pregnant women to be subject to HIV testing, even though, obviously, very many would not have HIV. Indeed, in some countries, all pregnant women who receive ante-natal care are screened for syphilis without giving adequate informed consent. Those who are uninfected, again, causally pose no threat. As a final example, compulsory mass vaccination, when done as a preventive and not a treatment, will also affect many who would not catch the disease and hence causally pose no threat. It is difficult to see how these measures could be justified by considerations of selfdefence. The problem is that, from the point of view of self-defence, the uninfected people pose no threat.

For this reason, it is generally accepted that any development of the doctrine of double effect must constrain the ways in which acts can be redescribed as unintentional. 31 Whether and how a constraint would work is one of many questions that it really would take us too far afield to go into. Perhaps we can say that it is up to someone who would use the doctrine of double effect to support the harms to innocent bystanders of quarantine and other measures should explain why these harms are not intended in a morally relevant sense. 29 An alternative argument might go like this. Self-defence is permissible even when one acts mistakenly so long as the mistake was reasonable. 32 Quarantine, to continue the focus on that, can affect some who are not contagious but whom it is reasonable to believe are. So, the argument goes, in restricting any who are not contagious, quarantine can be a reasonable mistake. But there is a serious error in this argument. Acting in self-defence against someone I reasonably, but mistakenly, think would harm me is one thing; acting against all of a large group when I am sure some of them would not harm me is another. A person does not become a legitimate target for self-defence just because she is part of a group whose members, considered separately, can each be given a high probability of harming someone. To take a parallel, consider the hypothetical case of a policeman killed by a group of people, 99 of whom were involved and one of whom tried to save him. We would not convict each member if the sole evidence was that he was a member of the 100, even though, in each case, there was only a 1% chance he was innocent. If the state were to convict all, it would knowingly convict an innocent and this could not be explained away as a reasonable mistake. 33 The point about innocent bystanders shows that care must be taken not to misapply self-defence to public health. Consider this argument for compulsory quarantine as put by one US court: compulsory quarantine does not restrict people\u00d5s rights because they do not have rights to harm others. 34 The argument employs one of the classical accounts of self-defence, that legitimate targets of self-defence have ceased to have certain rights. However, as a matter of ethics, if not law, self-defence is misapplied in this case. It is likely that some of those caught up in quarantine would not have harmed others and could not truthfully be said to be even a threat to others. In terms of this argument, they have not done anything to cease to have rights. Nor is this a point just about quarantine. It is about any public health restriction that applies to innocent bystanders.",

Rather than try to rule out those accounts, I want to note one implication of any plausible view of self-defence for some ways of reasoning about public health policy. All views of self-defence would speak in favour of targetted restrictions. That is, compulsion should take special care to avoid over-inclusion, because the over-included are innocent bystanders. To apply this point, consider two reasons offered on behalf of widespread compulsory testing of pregnant women for HIV: that testing only those in the high risk groups would miss some who have HIV and thus fail to defend all foetuses from the risk of maternal transmission; and that testing of all rather than only those in high-risk groups would reduce the stigma associated with the test. 35 The first is a reason of self-defence but, for those in low risk groups, is inadequate. A policy of compulsory universal testing would include too many innocent bystanders. The second is not justified by considerations of self-defence at all. Sending the right signals or avoiding discrimination are not reasons to treat as threats people who threaten no one.",

Self-defence is one distinctive basis for an account and justification of public health compulsion, but there is no reason to think it is the only one. For instance, compulsion might be justified by the amount of harm it prevents, even as it thereby infringes on rights. 36 And compulsion might be justified as the enforcement of a duty of fair play, itself the solution to certain collective actions problems that arise in public health. There is also no reason to think that the scope and limits of these other justifications will overlap neatly with self-defence. But that is a matter for discussion elsewhere.",
