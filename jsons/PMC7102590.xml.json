            "text": "Coronaviruses (CoVs), belongs to the family Coronaviridae. They have single stranded positive-sense RNA genome with \u223c26\u201332 kb in size [1,2]. The genomic organization and expression pattern are similar in all coronaviruses. It is well known that multiple CoVs are found naturally and their genetic recombination happens, and novel viruses emerged with variable characteristics with their extended hosts [3]. In 2012, MERS-CoV was identified from a 60-year-old patient, died with severe pneumonia, hospitalized in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia [4]. MERS-CoV has become a deadly pathogen for the occurrence of an outbreak and causes zoonotic respiratory disease. The MERS-CoV has spread into 27 countries and has now become a major health concern for both human and animal globally. The bats and dromedary camels serve as a reservoir and potential source of MERS-CoV for human infections. Currently, total of 2458 laboratory-confirmed cases with 848 deaths have been reported [5]. The MERS-CoV mainly transmitted to humans in family clusters, healthcare workers, household contacts, through contact with camels, as well as community settings [[6], [7], [8]]. MERS-CoV is responsible for causing lower respiratory infections with fever and cough followed by shortness of breath and organ failure in severe cases with comorbidities [[9], [10], [11]]. Earlier it was believed that inter-human transmission is limited but the nosocomial infection was reported in healthcare facilities due to inadequate infection control which resulted in larger outbreaks with MERS-CoV confirming human to human infection [12]. MERS-CoV has been isolated and sequenced from camel and its infected owner patient as well as in air sample collected from the same barn that sheltered the infected camel and showed the identical sequences from both camel and human which confirms the direct transmission from camel to human [7,13]. MERS-CoV has been detected in upper and lower respiratory secretions at relatively high virus load and in fecal samples [14]. The identification of MERS-CoV and the neutralizing antibodies as well as a similar coronavirus has already been identified from camels and bats from multiple locations; Ghana, Europe, South Africa, Oman, the Canary Islands, UAE, Korea, and Egypt [12,14,15]. Recently, a mutant MERS-CoV has been identified from South Korea. The mutation was observed in Ribosomal Binding Domain (RBD) domain of Spike protein gene [16,17]. Additionally, the MERS-CoV neutralizing antibodies were detected recently in the young goats and sheep from Jordan and Egypt [15,18]. Recently, a large outbreak observed due to the unusual presentation of MERS-CoV from Riyadh, Saudi Arabia [19].",

The emergence of dominant and recombinant MERS-CoV which caused a human outbreak in 2015 has been reported from camel [3]. The zoonotic introduction was suspected after the MERS-CoV identification [18] and in a recent study from UAE the genetic diversity of MERS-CoV full-genome from both human and dromedary camel was analyzed, and very closed sequence similarity was observed which confirms the zoonotic introductions [20,21]. Additionally, the zoonotic introduction time and seasons play an important role in the disease spread. Based on the analysis of the distribution of human outbreak cluster size, it has also been demonstrated that the time of zoonotic introduction and season plays a significant role in human outbreak driven by MERS-CoV in Arabian Peninsula [22]. The MERS-CoV is known to have genetic diversity. The Spike gene plays a significant role in host cell attachment and the entry of the virus in the host cells [23]. The RBD of Spike protein gene mediates the virus interaction to the host cell and binds with dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4, CD26) known as a cellular receptor which favors the viral entry into the cell and is immunodominant and induces neutralizing antibodies [[24], [25], [26]].",

A novel recombinant MERS-CoV has already been identified from Saudi Arabia [28]. Recently, in another study, total 530 nucleotides deletion was observed in Spike gene from serum samples collected from Taif, Saudi Arabia and a novel genetic variant of MERS-CoV was designated as a quasispecies [29]. Multiple substitutions of amino acids were observed in RBD, part of Spike gene from a bat sample collected from Uganda and the recombination in the S1 subunit of the Spike gene was observed and it was expected that this variation likely to play an important role in the emergence of MERS-CoV causing disease in human [30].

So, there is an urgent need to identify the genetic variability of Spike protein gene so that it can determine and established the link that how the virus is moving from infected camel to human.

Our study has provided the genetic diversity of the Spike protein gene isolated from both camel and human samples from Jeddah, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. The highest sequence identity was observed with the previously reported sequences submitted in the GenBank. The phylogenetic tree relationships were also formed a closed cluster with earlier known viruses from various locations in the Kingdom.

The comparative structure of the Spike protein gene has been predicted and presented in this study to show how the structural changes as compared to recombinant virus appear. The effect of a mutation in the Spike protein gene with the viral entry to the host cell by using CD26 binding requires further detail study.

The recombination happens with the co-circulating CoVs in multiple hosts which further increase the rate of recombinant virus emergence. The estimated rate of mutations in CoVs are known as moderate to high as compared to other known ssRNA viruses. The rate of average substitution for CoVs has been reported as \u223c10\u22124 substitutions per year per site while the average substitution of S gene in 229E was observed to be \u223c3 \u00d7 10\u22124 per site per year [36] and in SAARS-CoV it was estimated to be 0.80\u20132.38 \u00d7 1\u22123 per site per year. In the case of MERS-CoV, the average rate of substitution was found to be 1.12 \u00d7 10\u22123 per site per year [37]. Recently, the co-circulation of multiple HCoV species in camel along with MERS-CoV has been reported from Saudi Arabia and resulted into an emergence of a recombinant virus which was responsible for an outbreak in 2015 [28,38]. These results showed that many CoV are circulating in the wild animals originated from human and animal and by this, an opportunity is favored for the genetic recombination, evolution and emergence of potential and recombinant virus lethal to human [3].",

            "text": "By considering the variations in the MERS-CoV Spike protein gene reported so far, it is very important to consider the frequent appearance and conservation of RBD alterations in human infections. It is well reported that the interspecies transmission of CoVs is mainly mediated by mutations in Spike protein gene with a high affinity toward human receptors [28,39,40]. The RBD mutations increased the unexpected emergence with reduced affinity to human CD26 in South Korean MERS-CoV outbreak. The Identification of recombinant virus from Saudi Arabia [28] as well as unusual presentation and emergence of MERS-CoV resulted in an outbreak in Riyadh [19] raises several critical questions. Based on epidemiologic features, the zoonotic transmission of the MERS-CoV from the animal reservoir has been suggested by an intermediate animal host. The evidence of dromedary camel as a reservoir for MERS-CoV has been already reported based on the identical sequences obtained from camel and a patient with close contact with camel nasal secretion which directs cross-species transmission without any intermediate host [7,13]. Indeed, it has been reported that the interfacial residual difference in receptors of various mammalian host species is very important for interspecies transmission of CoVs [40]. The sequence diversity and homology play an important role in various functions of virus and host cells like cellular fusion and attachment [28,41]. The viruses have ability to cause various types of diseases including neurological disorders. [42,43]. The human genome sequence diversity due to gene flow from South east Asia to other locations also plays an important role in the disease transmission and spread of pathogens from one location to other as well as intrahost transmission. As it has been shown that the ancient east-Asian mtDNA HG-M and exhibit the highest nucleotide diversity [44,45]. However, our data showed no significant amino acid sequences variations in the Spike protein gene. Finally, there is not much information available about the role of RBD mutation linked with reduced affinity to host receptor CD26 and MERS-CoV transmissibility to infect human. The genetic diversity was significantly observed in the Spike protein gene sequences of both nucleotides and amino acids collected from Saudi Arabia. The information generated from this study provided an insight to the pattern of sequence diversity which plays an important role in the viral disease spread as well as movement of virus from one host to others. This diversity information will play an important role in designing and development of antiviral drugs, vaccines as well as antiviral compounds against MERS-CoV.",

Finally, to elucidate the evolutionary pathway, more detail mutation analysis of Spike protein gene needs to be done using more sequences from Saudi Arabia and we should take lessons from the outbreak caused by MERS-CoV and SAARS-CoV and we should take necessary measures to combat any further outbreak.",
