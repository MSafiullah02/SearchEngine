            "text": "The initial interaction is by random collision and depends on the relative concentrations of virus particles and cells. Under in vitro conditions, the ionic composition of the culture medium is an important factor as both viruses and cells are negatively charged at neutral pH and thus tend to repel one another. The presence of cations, such as Mg2+, helps to promote close contact. Adsorption then takes place through specific binding sites on the virus and receptors on the plasma membrane of the cell. It is largely a temperature- and energy-independent process. Viruses vary widely in the range of cells to which they can adsorb, depending on the nature of the sites to which they attach and how widespread they are among cells of different types, tissues and species. The presence of the receptor determines whether the cell will be susceptible to the virus, but the cells must also be permissive: that is, for successful production of new virions, they need to contain the range of intracellular components required by the virus for its replication. The ability of a virus to enter and replicate in a particular cell type is called tissue or cell tropism.\n",

There is considerable interest in identifying receptors for particular viruses, as the attachment step is a potential target for antiviral therapy and could aid in the understanding of viral pathogenesis. Specific receptors for selected viruses have been described, but have frequently been disputed. Newer techniques involving monoclonal antibodies, molecular cloning and gene transfer have helped to resolve these issues. It has become apparent that more than one type of receptor molecule may be required by the majority of viruses to complete the entry stage of the replication cycle. Indeed it is likely that there is a complex interaction between different functional domains of the virus and several receptor arrays. First there is the \u2018true\u2019 attachment step whereby the virus binds to the cell receptor, and then entry itself may involve a further set of receptors called co-receptors or post-binding receptors, acting either in succession or in parallel. These interactions frequently induce conformation changes in the surface proteins of the virus, exposing hidden domains that are required for the entry step (see next section). This more complicated view of the initial contact between the virus and the cell suggests that the binding receptor may not be the only determinant of tropism, and the adsorption process may be influenced by factors such as virus strain, cell type and even the multiplicity of infection.",

            "text": "For viruses with envelopes, penetration is accomplished by membrane fusion catalysed by fusion proteins in the viral envelope. The fusions proteins that mediate entry have been divided into two categories. Class I fusion proteins include influenza haemagglutinin protein, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) gp120 and paramyxovirus fusion protein. They are all cleaved into two pieces during synthesis, are found as trimeric spikes protruding from the surface of the viral particles and contain a fusion peptide characteristically composed of 20 hydrophobic amino acids. In some cases, for example HIV, fusion occurs at the cell surface at neutral pH with the activation energy being provided by receptor binding. In other cases, for example influenza virus, receptor-mediated endocytosis occurs. Receptors with adsorbed virus move together (patch) to pits coated with clathrin before moving into the cytosol to form small uncoated vesicles, which then fuse together as endosomes. A proton pump in the endosome lowers the pH to about 5. This acidic pH triggers the conformational change leading to the fusion of the viral and endosomal membranes, releasing the nucleocapsid into the cytosol. The endosomes combine with lysosomes, which eventually degrade any viral components contained within. This process is outlined in Figure 7.3\n. Class II fusion proteins are found in Flaviviruses (e.g. yellow fever virus, hepatitis C virus) and Togaviruses (e.g. rubella). They have different structural features from the class I fusion proteins, consisting of heterodimers. In the acidic endosome following receptor-mediated endocytosis, reorganization of the protein takes place with formation of active homotrimers and insertion of a hydrophobic fusion loop into the target membrane.",

Some viruses undergo conformational changes on attachment that result in the opening of the capsid and release of selected viral proteins and viral nucleic acid into the cell. For example, crystallography studies of picornaviruses have revealed that the myristic acid groups at one end of the VP4 structural protein interact with the host membrane; this causes VP4 and the viral genome to exit from the capsid through a channel and to enter the cytosol. Enveloped viruses that enter by receptor-mediated endocytosis may be affected by the low pH in the endosome and the action of lysosomal enzymes. Uncoating can also take place in the cytosol or at the nuclear membrane. Reoviruses never fully uncoat, the viral genome remaining within a recognizable capsid structure. Poxviruses become uncoated in two stages. In the first, the outer layers and lateral bodies are removed within endosomal vesicles using host enzymes, and the core lies in the cytosol. Poxviruses carry their own DNA-dependent RNA polymerase, and this enzyme is used in the second stage to transcribe mRNA, which is translated into a special uncoating protein; this enables the final release of viral DNA from the core.",

Although details are not available for many viruses, it is clear that microtubules and microtubule-dependent motors are frequently involved in the transport. Some viruses stay in the cytosol for the remainder of their replication (e.g. poliovirus), but others proceed towards the nucleus where they are uncoated at the nuclear membrane before entry into the nucleus (e.g. herpesviruses) or enter the nucleus intact (e.g. papillomaviruses). Targeting to the nucleus depends on nuclear localization sequences found on the surface of the capsids. To gain access to the nucleus, the virus or its genome can either enter when the cell is undergoing mitosis (when the nuclear membrane is temporarily absent) or, more commonly, be delivered directly into the nucleoplasm though nuclear pore complexes.",

A component in the virus particle (\u03b1-transcription initiation factor [\u03b1-TIF], a \u03b3 protein), acting as a transactivator, induces the transcription of the first set of mRNAs. A second component of the viral tegument called virion host shut-off protein (VHS) inhibits host cell macromolecular synthesis, and all the metabolic energy of the cell is turned towards the production of new virus particles. The genes coding for the \u03b1, \u03b2 and \u03b3 proteins have been mapped on the genome and, whereas the \u03b2 and \u03b3 genes tend to be scattered, the \u03b1 genes are located together.

Each infectious virus carries its own RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, an enzyme unique to some RNA viruses and not found in uninfected cells. It enables the transcription of one strand (-) into mRNAs, which are subsequently translated into viral proteins. The transcription is thus asymmetric and conservative: that is, only mRNAs are formed and the parental duplex is not broken apart. Each mRNA is later encapsidated and copied once to form double-stranded molecules (Fig. 7.7\n).

Generally the components that will constitute the new virions are produced in high quantities, and the assembly process is probably rather inefficient. Assembly is followed by release of virus particles, the productive phase of the infection. The release is either through cell lysis, as used by many non-enveloped viruses, or through budding, in most cases without cell death, as used by many enveloped viruses. Recently some non-enveloped DNA viruses have been shown to code for a small basic regulatory protein (the agnoprotein) whose function is to act as a viroporin, resulting in membrane permeabilisation and the subsequent release of the newly synthesized virus particles. There is also evidence for active release without cell lysis for other non-enveloped viruses, perhaps via vesicles resembling autophagosomes that contain the newly synthesized viruses. In some cases, viruses can be transferred directly from the infected cell to the neighbouring cells, thus avoiding any exposure to the extracellular environment or to the immune response of the host.

Details regarding the precise nature of the interaction between the nucleic acid and the structural proteins that make up the capsid are uncertain, despite extensive study. It is possible that the viral nucleic acid is inserted into the procapsid through a pore, or it might cause a structural reorientation of the procapsid, thereby becoming internalized.

This can take place through the plasma membrane, thus releasing the virions from the cell (e.g. orthomyxoviruses and retroviruses; Fig. 7.12\n), or through internal membranes, such as the inner nuclear membrane in the case of the herpesviruses (Fig. 7.13B\n), followed by fusion of the vesicles containing the viruses with the plasma membrane. Envelope glycoproteins specified by the virus are synthesized by essentially the same mechanism as cellular membrane glycoproteins. The viral proteins destined to become envelope proteins contain a sequence of 15\u201330 hydrophobic amino acids, known as the signal sequence. This sequence binds the growing polypeptide chain to a receptor on the cytoplasmic side of the rough endoplasmic reticulum and enables its passage through the membrane. Glycosylation occurs in the lumen of the rough endoplasmic reticulum, and the proteins are transported to the Golgi apparatus. There they are further glycosylated and acylated before transport to the plasma membrane, the direction probably determined by a sorting signal in the polypeptide sequence. In some cases, the signal directs the viral glycoprotein to one surface of the cell only; for example, orthomyxoviruses bud only from the outer (apical) surface of epithelial cells, whereas rhabdoviruses bud only from the inner (basal) surface. The viral glycoproteins are very important in terms of antigenicity as the hydrophilic domains protrude from the surface of the cell, with the N terminus being furthest away, and change the surface structure significantly. They remain anchored in the membrane via a hydrophobic domain near the carboxyl (C) terminus. After insertion into the membrane, the viral glycoproteins accumulate together to form oligomers; at the same time the host cell glycoproteins move away. At the C terminus of the viral glycoproteins, there is frequently a short hydrophilic sequence that remains inside the cell and is assumed to interact with the internal components of the virus during assembly. Lipid rafts function as microdomains for the accumulation of many viral glycoproteins, and may also initiate the actual budding sequence. It is not known how the nucleocapsids are directed to the assembly site. Once there, they are engulfed by the membrane; this process requires bending of the membrane, leading to its outward curvature. In the case of the class I fusion proteins described above, a final cleavage of the glycoprotein is required to make the virus infectious. For example, the haemagglutinin H0 of influenza virus is cleaved into two peptides, HA1 and HA2, linked by disulphide bridges. The bud is completed by the fusion of the two apposing membranes, and it finally separates from the plasma membrane of the host to become a new infectious virus. For retroviruses, budding occurs by highjacking a cellular pathway that normally creates vesicles that bud into late endosomal compartments called multivesicular bodies. These viruses then exit through the plasma membrane or via exosomes. During or shortly after budding, the viral protease enzyme cleaves at specific sites within precursor proteins to produce the proteins found in the mature virus particles.",

The advantage to the virus could be that the spread of the infection is enhanced as the entire cellular contents, including progeny viruses, are packaged into membrane-bound apoptotic bodies that are then taken up by adjacent cells. In contrast, other viral proteins have been revealed that block or delay apoptosis, presumably until sufficient progeny viruses have been produced within the cells. In this case, the factors target specific stages of the apoptotic pathway. For example, caspases are inhibited during poxvirus infections, the action of interferon is downregulated during influenza virus infections and p53 is destroyed during some human papillomavirus infections. Therefore the susceptibility of the host cell to apoptosis depends on the acute death pathways in the cell itself and the range of apoptotic modulators induced by the infecting viruses.",

The inclusion bodies are nuclear or cytoplasmic and vary in their composition. They can consist of viral factories in which morphogenesis occurs, crystalline arrays of virus particles ready for release, overproduction of a particular viral protein or proteins, or some aberrant cellular structure, such as clumped chromatin. Virally encoded non-structural proteins are likely to be involved in forming the matrix of these structures and in recruiting viral components to them. Some examples of inclusion bodies are shown in Figure 7.13. Secondly, the cells may be killed by the viral infection. There are several possible reasons for this, including factors produced by the virus that induce apoptosis (see above). It is likely that the accumulation of viral structural proteins is toxic for the cells in some cases. In addition, some viruses, such as herpes simplex virus and the poxviruses, inhibit host cell macromolecular synthesis from an early stage in the replication cycle, leading to structural and functional damage. Plasma membrane function and permeability change, and lysosomal membranes begin to break down, allowing leakage of the contents with degradative activity into the cytoplasm. There may also be marked effects on the cytoskeleton. These changes lead to a cytopathic effect, seen clearly in cell culture. It can take several forms, one of the most common being cell rounding and subsequent detachment from the solid surface (Fig. 7.14B\n). Another is the formation of a syncytium, whereby the membranes of adjacent infected cells fuse and a giant cell is formed containing many nuclei (Fig. 7.13, Fig. 7.14).

However, they can replicate in the presence of helper virus, often the parental virus, which compensates for the lack of a particular gene or gene cluster.

Latent infections are more common with DNA viruses than RNA viruses, perhaps because no mechanisms exist to maintain RNA for long periods of time intracellularly. One example of latency is provided by Epstein\u2013Barr virus, which persists in B lymphocytes as episomal viral DNA with limited transcription of viral genes, probably around 11 protein products being expressed.

For herpes simplex virus, latency occurs in neuronal cells with the viral genome being maintained in the nucleus as an episome. All the lytic genes are switched off but one set of transcripts, the latency-associated transcripts (LATs), is abundantly expressed. The LATs can inhibit apoptosis and thus contribute to persistence of the virus. However, whether viral gene expression is substantially prevented by the action of the LATs or by the immune response of the host, such as via the local production of interferons and cytokines, is uncertain.

Normal cells have a limited number of cell divisions, called the Hayflick limit, that they can undergo in vitro before apoptosis; for example, the Hayflick limit for cells taken from a human fetus is around 60 divisions. Transformed cells no longer have this limit and thus can grow and divide indefinitely. There are many changes in the surface properties of transformed cells. Often viral-specific antigens are found, particularly ones synthesized early in the replication cycle. Fibronectin, a surface glycoprotein thought to be important in keeping cells together in a tissue or organ, is no longer found. Commonly fetal antigens are expressed, and the agglutinability of cells by plant lectins changes, demonstrating alterations in the distribution of membrane glycoproteins. Finally, some transformed cells form tumours when injected into susceptible animals. Often these animals have to be immunocompromised in some way before tumours are produced, or the cells inserted into an immunologically protected site, such as the cheek pouch of the hamster. In addition, it is important to appreciate that by no means all transformed cells will form tumours. It is thought that there are degrees of transformation and that several stages have to be completed before the cells are fully transformed and equivalent to malignant tumour cells. Viral transformation may represent only the first step or a single step in such a pathway. There are no in vitro markers that determine the degree of transformation; thus the potential ability of the transformed cell to produce tumours in experimental animals cannot be predicted, as yet.",

The initial stages are exactly as described above for the productive infections. There is attachment, entry, uncoating and, in most but not all cases, selected viral genes are expressed as proteins, giving the cell new antigenic properties. At this stage the viral nucleic acid becomes integrated in the host cell DNA, probably not at a specific site, or it circularizes and is maintained in a non-integrated episomal form in the nucleus. The association is a stable one, so that when the host cell DNA is replicated, the viral nucleic acid is also replicated and the number of viral genome copies per cell remains constant over many cell generations. Thus, transformation is a heritable alteration. With some viruses, such as Epstein\u2013Barr virus and the papovaviruses, the whole viral genome is normally integrated, whereas with others, such as herpes simplex virus and adenoviruses, only part of the viral genome is integrated and the remainder is lost.",

It is able to transform CD4+ lymphocytes in vitro with integration of the DNA provirus. Genetic analysis has revealed that the viral genome can code for several non-structural proteins, including one of special interest called Tax, an oncoprotein of molecular weight 40 kDa. This protein, which has no cellular homologue, is able to activate transcription in the long terminal repeat of the integrated virus. Tax also affects the transcription of a remarkable number of cellular genes that are involved in cell cycle control and the cellular response to DNA damage. In short, it functions in a complex manner to promote cell proliferation, to accumulate DNA damage with the loss of genomic integrity, and to inhibit apoptosis. However, it is unlikely that Tax expression alone leads to the end-point of leukaemia and further, so far unexplained, molecular events occurring over a period of several years, are probably necessary.",

In vitro this virus is able to transform most types of human epithelial cells, including keratinocytes. The viral proteins responsible for transformation are the products of two genes, E6 and E7, which are found in cervical tumour cells. The interaction between E6 and E7 oncoproteins and their cellular targets is required to maintain the malignant phenotype. Both proteins have multiple functions but it is probably most important that E6 interacts with p53, and E7 with retinoblastoma protein, thereby inactivating them. As both p53 and retinoblastoma protein act as cellular growth-suppressing proteins, loss of their functions is likely to lead to transformation. In addition, integration of the viral genome normally involves the disruption of the E2 gene, the product of which is required to stop transcription of the E6 and E7 promoters, and therefore the continued expression of the E6 and E7 proteins results. Further properties of the E6 and E7 proteins include the inhibition of apoptosis, overriding of cell cycle controls, chromosome destabilisation and, in vivo, various mechanisms to evade local immune responses.",
