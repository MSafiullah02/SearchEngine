The study protocol was approved by the Institutional Ethics Committee of AIIMS and written informed consent was obtained from the parents of the children. Respiratory specimens were collected, either expectorated or induced sputum, nasopharyngeal aspirates or throat swabs, from 104 children who were diagnosed with CF, based on sweat chloride levels, aged up to 18 yr, who presented with pulmonary exacerbation either to the Pediatric outpatient department or admitted to the Pediatric ward. Children presenting within six months of the previous exacerbation were excluded. Pulmonary exacerbation was defined as per the criteria suggested by Fuchs et al12.",
