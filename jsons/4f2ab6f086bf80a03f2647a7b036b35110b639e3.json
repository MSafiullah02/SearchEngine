We have similar experiences in our practice during the first COVID-19 epidemic phase with the epicenter in China. Among five patients from the Wuhan cluster enrolled to NHTD in mid-January, all of them were mild with nonspecific symptoms, including fever, drug cough or sore throat (Table 1) . No patients developed acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) or related symptoms included shortness of breath or rapid breathing. Four patients had ground-glass opacification or bilateral cloudiness on radiographic imaging. The mildest case was a young male with no lung damage; however, this patient took the longest time to clear the virus (22 days versus 9-14 days among others).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 130, "end": 131, "text": "2", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 514, "end": 523, "text": "(Table 1)", "ref_id": null}], "section": "Management of mild cases of COVID-19 in low-resource countries: An experience in Vietnam"}, {"text": "No patients had severe respiratory symptoms that required oxygen support therapy. No antiviral or glucocorticoid drugs were prescribed. Only supportive therapy, including nutrition enhancement, rehydration, and oral antitussives and expectorants was provided. The lopinavir/ritonavir has not been officially recommended by the Ministry of Health of Vietnam, and it may not be as effective in mild patients as shown in Chien-Yu Chengs' findings. 2 In Vietnam, we require all patients to quarantine and stay at healthcare centers till they met the discharge criteria with two consecutive negatives RT-PCR in no less than 24 hours. However, in the situation of rapidly increasing cases, inappropriate management of mild cases could increase the burden of healthcare system and medical costs in low-resource countries. Viral clearance is a major standard in the assessment of recovery and discharge from medical care, but the early results illustrated that the persistence of viral RNA is heterogeneous despite the rapidly 2 remission of symptoms and can over three weeks even in very mild cases. In addition, long hospitalization stays may increase the risk for hospital-associated mental health problems, 3 and unexpected hospital-acquired infections. We suggest the urgent need of more data from patients with mild symptoms. In addition, discharge standards should be considered for amendment based on the spread of epidemic and the response capacity of the local health system. Earlier discharge, when all symptoms are completely relieved, followed by self-isolation at home could be a potential strategy in the scenario of fast-growing number of cases, and when the health system is overloaded. Furthermore, the duration of isolation for suspected cases should be extended to 21 days or even four weeks to ensure they will not be able to transmit the virus without being identified.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 445, "end": 446, "text": "2", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 1203, "end": 1204, "text": "3", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Management of mild cases of COVID-19 in low-resource countries: An experience in Vietnam"}], "bib_entries": {"BIBREF0": {"ref_id": "b0", "title": "Importation and Human-to-Human Transmission of a Novel Coronavirus in Vietnam", "authors": [{"first": "L", "middle": ["T"], "last": "Phan", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "T", "middle": ["V"], "last": "Nguyen", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "Q", "middle": ["C"], "last": "Luong", "suffix": ""}], "year": 2020, "venue": "N Engl J Med", "volume": "382", "issn": "9", "pages": "872--874", "other_ids": {"DOI": ["10.1056/NEJMc2001272"]}}, "BIBREF1": {"ref_id": "b1", "title": "Lopinavir/ritonavir did not shorten the duration of SARS CoV-2 shedding in patients with mild pneumonia in Taiwan", "authors": [{"first": "C-Y", "middle": [], "last": "Cheng", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "Y-L", "middle": [], "last": "Lee", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "C-P", "middle": [], "last": "Chen", "suffix": ""}], "year": 2020, "venue": "Immunology and Infection", "volume": "", "issn": "", "pages": "", "other_ids": {"DOI": ["10.1016/j.jmii.2020.03.032"]}}, "BIBREF2": {"ref_id": "b2", "title": "Timely mental health care for the 2019 novel coronavirus outbreak is urgently needed", "authors": [{"first": "Y", "middle": ["T"], "last": "Xiang", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "Y", "middle": [], "last": "Yang", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "W", "middle": [], "last": "Li", "suffix": ""}], "year": 2020, "venue": "Lancet Psychiatry", "volume": "7", "issn": "3", "pages": "30046--30054", "other_ids": {"DOI": ["10.1016/s2215-0366(20"]}}}, "ref_entries": {}, "back_matter": []}
