[13] described statistical approaches for selecting up to 3 regimens to advance for concurrent testing in a later, multi-regimen HIV vaccine efficacy trial. For maximum operational efficiency, it is desirable to have a strong statistical framework for selecting the most promising regimens in such a process, as the maximum number of regimens allowed to be selected is typically pre-determined based on the budget limit. The design of one such multi-regimen phase IIb HIV vaccine efficacy trial in Southern Africa was laid out by Gilbert et al. [8], to evaluate one or more qualifying prime-boost vaccine regimens for efficacy against a shared placebo arm. In phase I trials designed to inform down-selection of vaccine regimens, the immunogenicity of a given vaccine (as characterized by multiple immune response endpoints such as T-cell or antibody responses) is an essential criterion in regimen selection. Moreover, vaccine-induced multivariate immune response biomarkers play a key role in vaccine development as potential correlates of a vaccine\u2019s protective effect in preventing HIV infection; that is, a vaccine\u2019s efficacy can be predicted based on the magnitude and breadth of the immune responses elicited by the vaccine [6, 7].",

            "text": "Huang et al. [14] investigated the problem of how to rank and down-select a small number of vaccine regimens based on a given set of immune response endpoints. While others have also studied this type of \u201cpick-the-winner\u201d problem, previous work typically focused either on the selection of a single best regimen based on a few endpoints [19\u201321] or on the comparison of two regimens with respect to univariate or multivariate endpoints [1, 2, 4, 16, 18, 22, 23]. The particular problem of selecting the best several regimens based on multivariate endpoints has unique challenges. Huang et al. [14] addressed this down-selection problem through the development of formal superiority and non-redundancy criteria for selecting regimens. The formal superiority criterion states that regimens with superior immunogenicity are preferred. The non-redundancy criterion states that when more than one regimen can be advanced, it is desirable to advance regimens with diverse immune profiles such that different vaccines (acting via potentially different mechanisms) for HIV prevention can be evaluated in the efficacy trial. A rank/filtering/selection (RFS) algorithm based on ranking and hypothesis testing was developed [14] to select regimens satisfying these two criteria, where a pre-determined set of immune response endpoints was used for comparison between regimens. Multi-test adjustment was proposed to account for the multiple pairs of regimens for comparison and the multivariate endpoints considered in order to control the probability of selecting regimens with redundant immune profiles into the final set.",

These immune response endpoints can involve different immune classes, such as cellular or humoral responses, as well as different antigens. Moreover, these immune response endpoints can be correlated with each other and differ in their strength as predictors of a vaccine\u2019s protective effect. Entering all possible immune response endpoints into the down-selection algorithm would create an unnecessary measurement burden and also have a negative impact on the down-selection process. A numeric example in Huang et al. [14] shows that when multivariate immune response endpoints are highly correlated with each other, the multi-test adjustment implemented in the RFS algorithm can be too conservative and have reduced power to detect differences between regimens. How to choose a parsimonious subset of immune response endpoints from a larger number of candidate endpoints to enter into down-selection is an important open question that needs to be addressed. In this paper, we aim to fill this gap. We investigate and propose algorithms for selecting immune response endpoints to enter into down-selection, taking into account information about the importance of individual endpoints as correlates of a vaccine\u2019s protective effect as well as the correlation structure among these endpoints. While this research is motivated by the down-selection problem in the HIV vaccine trial setting, it also has more general applications for feature selection when a large number of candidate endpoints are available for comparison between intervention groups.",

In Sect. 3, we conduct extensive numerical studies to compare the performance of the proposed feature selection algorithms combined with RFS to that of naive RFS without feature selection under various settings.

In practice, it is possible for some immune response measures to have a \u201charmful\u201d effect, in the sense that a higher immune response is associated with lower vaccine efficacy. In such a situation, one can use the negative value of the original immune response measurement as the endpoint of interest in the framework we will describe next. Suppose the comparison between regimens with respect to individual endpoints is based on mean values. That is, a regimen A is considered superior, inferior, or equivalent to another regimen B with respect to a particular endpoint i if the mean of the endpoint in A is larger (\\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$\\mu _{Ai}>\\mu _{Bi}$$\\end{document}\u03bcAi>\u03bcBi), smaller (\\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$\\mu _{Ai}<\\mu _{Bi}$$\\end{document}\u03bcAi<\u03bcBi), or the same (\\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$\\mu _{Ai}=\\mu _{Bi}$$\\end{document}\u03bcAi=\u03bcBi) compared to that in B. A regimen A is defined to be superior to regimen B (or equivalently B inferior to A) with respect to their immune profiles if A is superior to B with respect to at least one endpoint and is not inferior to B with respect to any endpoint. Two regimens A and B are said to have equivalent immune profiles if they are equivalent with respect to each endpoint considered. When a set of vaccine regimens is selected, the superiority criterion [13] is fully satisfied if no selected regimen is inferior to any other regimen that enters down-selection. The non-redundancy criterion [14] argues that with limited resources for conducting the efficacy trial, it is desirable to select vaccine regimens with diverse immune profiles, so that diverse potential mechanisms that mediate a vaccine\u2019s protective effects can be investigated in the efficacy trial. A vaccine regimen A is defined to be non-redundant to regimen B if A is not superior, not inferior, and not equivalent to B with respect to its immune profile. Non-redundancy is satisfied for a set of selected regimens if it is satisfied for any regimen pair in the set. An example illustrating the two criteria is presented in Web Supplementary Fig. 1.",

The top-ranked regimen is selected first, after which the rest of the regimens are evaluated sequentially according to their rank. In each step, a new regimen is compared with each regimen in the set selected earlier. Through hypothesis testing, if relative to any regimen already selected, one fails to declare that the new regimen is superior or non-redundant, the new regimen will not be selected into the set; otherwise, the new regimen is selected and all regimens selected earlier that fail to show non-redundancy to the newly selected regimen will be filtered out. This process is repeated until Q regimens have been selected or until all regimens have been evaluated once. As HIV vaccine efficacy trials are large and operationally challenging, satisfaction of the non-redundancy criterion is of paramount importance to avoid wasting valuable resources by advancing redundant regimens to efficacy evaluation. The RFS algorithm controls the probability of selecting non-redundant regimens into the final set through Bonferroni correction and uses the Holm procedure [10] to account for the comparison between multiple regimen pairs and the testing of multiple immune response endpoints.

In particular, the multi-test adjustment to declare a significant difference between regimens can be too conservative when the endpoints are highly correlated, leading to sub-optimal power for detecting a difference between the regimens. Moreover, in vaccine immunogenicity studies, many candidate immune response endpoints are typically available; some of them might be useful surrogate endpoints for predicting a vaccine\u2019s protective effect (albeit with inherent measurement error), whereas others might have limited or no utility as surrogate endpoints, as they are not actually related to differential vaccine efficacy across regimens.

By clustering, the most correlated immune response endpoints nest in the same cluster. When there is stronger correlation among immune response endpoints, there will be fewer clusters and vice versa. Now we need to select the desired subset of immune response endpoints based on the clustering results. We propose to choose one endpoint per cluster that has the highest importance value (i.e., w) in that cluster. Note that our proposed BIC-based selection method tends to choose fewer immune response endpoints when immune response endpoints are highly correlated, since there are fewer clusters from which to choose one endpoint.

The importance weight is also used later in the RFS algorithm to compute a weighted average across endpoints for ranking vaccine regimens. In practice, the assignment of these importance weights would require biological knowledge and/or data-driven hypotheses about the importance of individual immune response endpoints; sensitivity analyses based on a range of choices for weights are always helpful to evaluate the robustness of feature selection to different weight choices. For example, expert opinions could be elicited from lab scientists regarding the putative predictive clinical importance to vaccine efficacy of each immune response endpoint. When there are preliminary vaccine trial data available for modeling the risk of HIV as a function of vaccination status, the potential outcome of an immune response endpoint if receiving a vaccine, and their interaction, the magnitude of this interaction term can serve as a practical weight for the endpoint as it characterizes the capacity of the endpoint for modifying vaccine\u2019s protective effect. Next, we show the connection between these interaction terms and the optimal weights for combining multiple endpoints in regimen ranking, using a special risk modeling setting.",

Based on this model, one can analytically derive the optimal weights for individual immune response endpoints such that ranking based on the weighted average of immune response endpoints is equivalent to the ranking of the corresponding efficacies of the vaccine regimens.

Modeling disease risk conditional on potential immune responses if receiving a particular vaccine regimen (instead of actual observed immune responses in a trial participant) is appealing for HIV vaccine down-selection for the following reasons: (1) HIV vaccine trials typically enroll healthy individuals who have not been previously exposed to HIV vaccine antigens and thus their HIV-specific immune responses if receiving placebo would be zero; (2) modeling disease risk conditional on potential vaccine-induced immune responses allows prediction and ranking of vaccine efficacy based on immunogenicity induced by candidate vaccine regimens observed in phase I/II studies.

Various approaches have been developed in the literature for estimating the risk model (11) conditional on the vaccine-induced immune response [7, 12, 14, 15]. In scenarios where a partial set of multivariate immune responses is available from existing efficacy trial data, we can also estimate importance weights for each endpoint in the partial set by fitting a risk model conditional on the partial set of immune responses together [11].",

The first regimen is the partially efficacious vaccine regimen used in the RV144 Thai trial [17], which tested an ALVAC-HIV prime with a gp120 AIDSVAX B/E boost. In the RV144 trial, 16,395 participants were recruited and randomized (1:1) to vaccine or placebo; of these, 8,197 participants were assigned to receive vaccine injections at weeks 0, 4, 12, and 24. Among the vaccine recipients who were uninfected at week 26, immune responses were measured from 41 cases (i.e. infected before month 42) and 205 controls (i.e. free of infection over 42 months) selected in a 5:1 ratio to cases among strata defined by gender, number of vaccine injections received, and per-protocol status [9]. Immune response endpoints measured at week 26 for the 205 uninfected vacinees were included in this data example (RV144T). Also included are data from four other regimens in a recently completed HVTN phase I trial (HVTN 096): NYVAC prime plus NYVAC + AIDSVAX B/E boosts (T1), NYVAC + AIDSVAX B/E prime plus NYVAC + AIDSVAX B/E boosts (T2), DNA prime plus NYVAC + AIDSVAX B/E boosts (T3), and DNA + AIDSVAX B/E prime plus NYVAC + AIDSVAX B/E boosts (T4). Participants in each of the four vaccine arms of HVTN 096 received vaccine injections at weeks 0, 4, 12, and 24; immune response data measured from 19, 18, 17, and 19 vaccine recipients in T1, T2, T3, and T4, respectively, are included in this data example. Eight immune response endpoints from each regimen are included in the analysis dataset: one neutralizing antibody (NAb) response endpoint measured using the TZM-bl assay, one CD4+ T-cell response endpoint measured using intracellular cytokine staining (ICS), and six IgG binding antibody response endpoints measured using the binding antibody multiplex assay (BAMA) with different HIV antigens, including AE.A244 V1V2 Tags/293F (B1), gp70_B.CaseA2 V1V2/169K (B2), gp70_B.CaseA_V1_V2(B3), A244 gp120 gDneg/293F/mon (B4), vaccine insert (B5) and Con S gp140 CFI(B6).",

We then applied the proposed feature selection algorithms to the candidate immune response endpoints before entering the regimen down-selection. Two different sets of weights for individual immune response endpoints were considered. In the first set, equal weights were assigned to each endpoint. Based on this weighting strategy, the penalization-based algorithm chose three endpoints: ICS, B1, and NAb. Since all endpoints have the same importance wights, we chose ICS first because it has the lowest correlation with the other endpoints. We next chose B1 since it has the lowest correlation with ICS. NAb was the third endpoint chosen because it has low correlations with ICS and B1. The other five endpoints B2 - B6 were discarded because of their relatively high correlations with B1. Based on the three selected endpoints, the RFS algorithm ranked the vaccine regimens in the order of 096T3, 096T4, 096T1, RV144T, and 096T2; 096T3 was the only vaccine regimen selected. Therefore, with only 37.5% of immune response endpoints, the vaccine regimen selected is the same as when we used all immune response endpoints for down-selection. The BIC-based feature selection algorithm assigned B2 and B3 in the same clusters and assigned the remaining six endpoints into six individual clusters.

Based on these selected endpoints, the RFS algorithm ranked the vaccine regimens in the order of 096T3, 096T1, 096T4, 096T2, and RV144T.

This weight is important for selecting desired endpoints. Consider a situation in which we have two assays, both measuring the same underlying true response, but with different levels of noise. The endpoint with smaller measurement error would have larger importance weight (or larger interaction with treatment estimated from pilot data). The endpoint with larger measurement error would have smaller importance weight. As a result, immune endpoints with smaller signal-noise ratios are more likely to be excluded in the penalized-based feature selection process, due to their smaller importance weights. In practice, one can also consider first screening out assays with low signal-noise ratios. Usually the relative importance weight can be estimated by eliciting expert input (e.g. regarding whether an assay is more tied to the mechanism of protection of a given vaccine) or can be substituted with the interaction between a vaccine-induced immune response endpoint and vaccine status in infection risk, estimated based on existing data. When weights are estimated with pilot data, the uncertainty associated with the estimated weights would affect the performance of feature selection. Therefore, during the process of HIV vaccine development, it is important for researchers to continue updating the importance weights as new data become available, in order to reduce the uncertainty in weight estimation. Meanwhile, since the choice of importance weights depends on untestable assumptions about the risk prediction model conditional on new vaccine regimens and vaccine-induced immune responses, it is important to perform sensitivity analysis in practice to evaluate the robustness of feature selection and regimen down-selection under a range of plausible importance weights.",
