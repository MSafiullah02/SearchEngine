To identify the drivers of disease emergence, we analyzed infectious disease threat events (IDTEs) detected through epidemic intelligence collected at the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) between 2008 and 2013, and compared the observed results with a 2008 ECDC foresight study of projected drivers of future IDTEs in Europe. Among 10 categories of IDTEs, foodborne and waterborne IDTEs were the most common, vaccine-preventable IDTEs caused the highest number of cases, and airborne IDTEs caused the most deaths. Observed drivers for each IDTE were sorted into three main groups: globalization and environmental drivers contributed to 61% of all IDTEs, public health system drivers contributed to 21%, and social and demographic drivers to 18%. A multiple logistic regression analysis showed that four of the top five drivers for observed IDTEs were in the globalization and environment group. In the observational study, the globalization and environment group was related to all IDTE categories, but only to five of eight categories in the foresight study. Directly targeting these drivers with public health interventions may diminish the chances of IDTE occurrence from the outset.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "The health and economic costs of pandemic emerging infectious diseases (EIDs) can be significant. For example, the financial ramifications of an influenza pandemic can range from $374 billion for a minor pandemic to $7.3 trillion for a severe pandemic with millions of deaths. 1,2 However, even without sizable mortality, the financial costs of a pandemic can amount to tens of billions of dollars when EIDs are spread internationally through air traffic. 3 The increase in EIDs over the last five decades has highlighted the importance of understanding the underlying drivers of EIDs. 4 By recognizing and disaggregating multiple drivers, the process of emergence can be disentangled, and the drivers can then be categorized and prioritized for public health action. For example, through monitoring and surveillance of such drivers, it might be possible to anticipate and mitigate the impact of EIDs, both in public health and financial terms. [5] [6] [7] [8] Historically, public health has intervened successfully on a number of risk factors, such as a lack of sanitation and hygiene, poor quality of drinking water, or food safety. More recently, however, many disparate drivers interact with globalization (e.g., international air traffic) and changes in the biophysical environment and global systems (e.g., climate change). 9, 10 The interconnected and interdependent nature of these drivers makes it challenging to predict EIDs. [11] [12] [13] [14] In 2008, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) conducted a literatureand expert-based foresight study to identify environmental, socioeconomic, and technical changes that will contribute to future EIDs in Europe. 15 The study projected that the drivers of most concern would fall into three main groups: globalization and environment, social and demographic, and public health systems. 15 Since it is inherently difficult for foresight studies to account for trends in, and interdependencies of, multiple drivers, 16 we validated the study 17 by comparing the projected drivers for future EIDs with observed drivers of infectious disease threat events (IDTEs) that occurred in Europe between 2008 and 2013.

However, in the observed data, this group was linked to half of all of the IDTEs (the environment and climate change group was split into climate, natural environment, and human-made environment, as discussed above in the Methods section). Thus, global environmental change had been underestimated in the foresight study but was, in fact, a much more significant contributor to the observed IDTEs. This observation was also confirmed in the multiple logistic regression analysis, with globalization and environment contributing to four of the top five drivers: travel and tourism, natural environment, global trade, and climate. The contribution of globalization and environmental drivers to IDTEs might have been underestimated in the foresight study, possibly because these drivers are poorly understood and distal (or upstream) from the health outcome. 20 Globalization and environmental drivers might appear to be less amenable to direct interventions during an IDTE (e.g., travel restrictions), in contrast to social and demographic (e.g., social distancing) or public health system (e.g., stockpiling of drugs and vaccines) drivers.
