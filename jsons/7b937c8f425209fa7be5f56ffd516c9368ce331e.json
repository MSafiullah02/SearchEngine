World events can play a role in disruptive change by shifting values systems 1 . SARS-CoV2 is an example of a world event that has shifted our values as a field and as a society. Given the high rate of respiratory distress syndrome 2 there have been several concerns regarding shortages in personal protective equipment (PPE) and mechanical ventilation. As a result, federal and state authorities have enacted mandatory lockdowns in an attempt to \"flatten the curve\" of viral infection rates. Hospitals have halted non-essential hospital services and elective surgeries in preparation for shortages. Outpatient facilities are seeing fewer patients in order to keep with the practice of social distancing. Values have shifted from maximizing use of health-care resources to \"minimal necessary\" use in the name of conservation.",

The DLP culminates in a series of interactive lectures given by faculty on the Zoom \u2122 (Zoom) platform. These cover high-yield board review or topics pertinent to neurosurgical practice. A formal take-home quiz highlighting the salient points is given afterwards. Similarly, our weekly case conferences have moved to the Zoom Platform. During spine, tumor, trauma, and endovascular case conferences attendings discuss challenging cases with the residents along with the pitfalls and perils of each approach. We have recently converted our morbidity and mortality conference into this format as well.",

Because ECMC has its own call-pool, the resident there takes home-call for the week that they are working. Buffalo General Medical Center (BGMC)/Gates Vascular Institute (GVI) is covered by weekly rotating teams of four consisting of one chief, one PGY4-6, and two PGY 2s. Our night float resident is also PGY 4-6 and duty is limited to 1 week. Cases are covered by on duty residents depending on weekly volume. Our interns are currently on off-service rotations but are on stand-by if additional help is needed. This system addresses resident safety by limiting exposure, provides roles for our mid-level residents, spreads out night-float to prevent any one Hess 3 resident from losing operative time, and provides coverage in the event any resident becomes sick. In addition, it is compliant with duty hour restrictions.",

Patient encounters have shifted towards the minimization of contact requiring us to alter our typical approach to patients. Medical traditions such as team rounds have been abandoned in favor of smaller \"teams\" consisting of only the attending and resident directly managing the patient. If COVID-19 is suspected, certain consults are now completed by chart review, provided another provider has examined the patient (e.g. the emergency room resident) as outlined in recent policies from our hospital systems. In the outpatient clinical practice, we have implemented telehealth-video visits. The response of our patients to this has been quite positive, with many of them enjoying the ease of access to a medical professional. Although there are issues in assessing the subtlety of certain conditions over video, this modality will certainly have its uses in the future for routine follow-up visits. We envision tele-health as a way to more closely monitor our patients without burdening them with additional visits to our clinic. This is especially important for our patients that live in the rural areas of Western New York who may delay visits or be lost to follow-up given the distance from their home.",

What percentage of these will require neurosurgical intervention is unclear, however our practice continues to prepare for a potential influx of new patients. We expect that we will soon see the personal and economic consequences of patients having to reschedule their surgery or choosing to \"wait out\" their Hess 4 symptoms due to fear. Early detection of these indirect disruptions of the pandemic is critical and our practice has already begun monitoring for these complications.",

The disruption to our field has already spurred innovation and led to a shift in values. Within weeks our practice developed a tele-health platform and completely overhauled resident education. Likewise, the current outbreak has forced us to abandon long-standing traditions. Just a few months ago it would have been inconceivable that we would minimize contact with our patients. Though some changes are unlikely to continue long-term, it is important that we continue to embrace the concept of disruptive change. As a field we ought to view this time as a unique opportunity to question norms, implement new ideas, and drive innovation so that when we emerge from the fallout we are equipped to build a better future.",
