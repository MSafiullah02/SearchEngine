Our models focus on West Nile (WN) virus, an emerging infectious disease in North America, first identified in Africa. We begin by introducing a minimalist model for WN dynamics to illustrate the processes of model formulation, analysis, and application. We then revisit the question of model formulation to examine how two major biological assumptions affect the model structure and therefore its predictions. Next, we briefly compare these different model structures in an introductory exercise of model parameterization, validation, and comparison. Finally, we address model applications in more detail with two examples of how the model output can usefully be connected to public health applications.",

There remain, however, continuing and exciting challenges in both formulating and analyzing biologically relevant disease models. Developing and applying a disease model, as indeed any model, typically follows a series of steps ( Fig. 14.1 ). An initial disease observation prompts questions such as how fast the disease will spread, or how best the outbreak can be controlled. From the initial question, we first define the scope and assumptions of the problem and develop a conceptual hypothesis (1), This is then formulated as a mathematical expression (2) , which is parameterized (3), validated and compared (4), analysed (5) , and finally applied and used to generate predictions (6) , In this view, mathematical modeling follows the familiar scientific method. The model is essentially a formalization of a hypothesis that must be defined (steps 1-2) and tested (steps 3-4) before being used to answer questions or generate predictions (steps 5-6).",

Thus, the strategic approach may provide more qualitative insight into the basic properties of a system, whereas the tactical approach may provide better predictive ability for given species in a given location. Choosing a strategic philosophy is useful at this stage for studying general WN dynamics and control; later we might be interested in a more tactical model of local dynamics in a particular location.

But since we saw a very rapid disease increase in New York City within one summer, it might be interesting to focus on the shorter-term dynamics of a single season. This would allow us to ignore bird vital dynamics, and would require a model mosquito population that reproduces throughout the season. We thus choose a continuous time model that can be formulated as a system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs). For a more detailed discussion of continuous vs. discrete time models of WN virus, see [31] . Since our focal question is not explicitly spatial, we will consider only the changes in populations over time, giving us a nonspatial model.

In the interests of strategy, we will think of them simply as homogeneous populations of identical individuals that can be represented by a single equation for all ages and stages. (We will revisit this choice in Sect. 14.5.) WN has been reported thus far from \u223c60 mosquito species and \u223c280 bird species in North America. Again for strategy, we will model only a single generic mosquito and a single generic bird species, acknowledging that this limits our ability to address broader scale ecological questions in WN dynamics (e.g., [14, 17] ). Furthermore, since mammals (including humans) appear not to transmit the disease back to the mosquito population, they are considered secondary hosts [4, 19, 24, 37] , so the fundamental disease dynamics do not depend on them. Our model will therefore represent only the mosquito and bird populations.",

Mathematically, R 0 is defined as the spectral radius of the next generation matrix for new infections [13, 42] . The reproduction number serves as an invasion threshold for predicting disease outbreaks and evaluating control strategies. Quantitatively, it has a threshold value of one. When R 0 < 1, the DFE is locally stable and the introduction of a small number of infectious individuals will not lead to a disease outbreak. When R 0 > 1 the DFE is unstable and an outbreak will occur.

Although it seems counterintuitive at first, we can see that reducing the bird density means the remaining individuals are bitten more often by hungry mosquitoes.

We can understand this limit by examining the disease transmission terms, which are written as \u03b2 B I M S B (mosquito to bird) and \u03b2 B S M I B (bird to mosquito), again omitting the terms \u03b1 M and \u03b1 B for clarity. The biting parameter \u03b2 B = \u03b2 B /\u00d1 * B has units time \u22121 density \u22121 , and can be thought of as the number of bites per day made by a single mosquito, per unit density of birds. Above\u00d1 * B , the mosquito biting rate in units bites time \u22121 , \u03b2 B N * B , would exceed \u03b2 B , and therefore by definition would exceed the physiological capacity of the mosquito (Fig. 14.3a) .",

For details of this parameter estimation and resampling see [43] ; an introduction to these methods is given in [5] . At low bird density where mass action applies, the R 0 of frequency dependence can be significantly too high (Fig. 14.3e) . At the threshold bird density\u00d1 * B , where both mass action and frequency dependence apply, the R 0 value is the same. At higher bird density where frequency dependence applies, the R 0 of mass action is significantly too high ( Fig. 14.3e ). Similar comparisons can be made for low, medium, and high mosquito densities (Fig. 14.3f ). These numerical results show that, for these parameter values, a transmission term misapplied at an inappropriate host or mosquito population density can significantly over-or underestimate R 0 .

Recall too that R 0 is simply a ratio and has no time scale, so that although adding a larval compartment may delay the system's dynamics (see Sect. 14.6), it does not affect the average number of secondary infections caused by the introduction of an infectious individual into an otherwise susceptible population -the definition of R 0 .

The science of model testing -which includes parameterization, validation, and multi-model comparison -is a highly developed statistical enterprise with multiple approaches. One key approach is that of maximum likelihood, which tests the relative abilities of multiple models to fit an independent dataset. This is a widely used and powerful method, but the details are beyond the scope of this chapter and readers are referred to central references such as [7, 25] for further guidance. Instead, we will take a brief look at how model parameterization can be tackled, and then used for qualitative model comparison.

Often, we can find only a mean and range of expected values for our parameters. The mean values give us deterministic model simulations, and the ranges can be used in stochastic simulations to evaluate the effects of natural variation and uncertainty in the estimates (e.g., [43] ). Figure 14 .4 shows numerical simulations of all four WN model structures using the mean parameter values in Table 14 .2. For a given set of initial conditions, we can predict the densities of infectious mosquitoes, infectious birds, and susceptible birds, over time following the introduction of a small infectious inoculum to an otherwise entirely susceptible population. From these simulations, we can see that the simplest model (14.1) has the fastest dynamics and the earliest outbreak, and the most complex model (14.9) has the slowest and latest (Fig. 14.4) .

For the remaining model analyses in this chapter, we will use the full model with both larval and exposed mosquito classes (14.9). The curved line shows the final proportion of surviving birds at the end of the season as a function of the initial mosquito-to-bird density at the beginning of the season. For a season with observed 50% bird mortality, the initial mosquito density can be inferred (1) For a future season with a target bird survival of 90%, the required initial mosquito density can be inferred in the same way (2) The ratio of these two initial mosquito densities (3) gives the relative reduction in the mosquito population required to obtain the target level of bird mortality.

WN surveillance programs typically track the number of dead birds throughout a season, a datum that can be linked to the initial mosquito-to-bird ratio as follows. By running repeated numerical solutions starting from different initial population densities at the DFE, a relationship can be plotted between the initial ratio of mosquito to bird densities, n * m , and the final disease-induced bird mortality at the end of the season (Fig. 14.5) . For a given level of mortality observed at the end of the season, the initial value n * m can be inferred.

Its calculation introduces a slight change of notation that was partially introduced in (14.6) and will prove more convenient for what follows. Specifically, the ratio of the current mosquito density to the initial bird density, N M /N B * , becomes n m , the ratio at the DFE, N M * /N B * , becomes n * m , and the threshold ratio for disease outbreak with a constant mosquito density isn * m . Based on empirical observations, we will represent mosquito seasonality as a simple step function (Fig. 14.6a) , giving the mean relative mosquito density over the season,n m = t a n a For variable mosquito density, the linear relationship between the average growth rate\u03bb and the average initial disease-free mosquito densityn * m is given by the straight line L = La + L b that connects points a (n a m ,\u03bba) and b (n b m ,\u03bb b ). A WN outbreak occurs when\u03bb > 0, i.e., whenn * m >n * m . For a given season, the point (n * m ,\u03bb) may be calculated from (14.12)-(14.13), or may be obtained graphically as the point along L where the ratio between line segments La:L b = ta:t b . As long as the lower population density n a m <n * m , the threshold mosquito density for disease outbreak will be higher for a seasonal than for a constant mosquito density. Adapted from [41] Fig. 3b-c where t a and t b refer to the total time spent at population levels n a m and n b m , respectively (Fig. 14.6a) . The mean disease growth rate is then given b\u0233 (14.13) where \u03bb a and \u03bb b are the largest eigenvalues of the Jacobian matrix J evaluated at n a m and n b m , respectively (Fig. 14. 6b; see Appendix for details). This gives a mean geometric growth rate for infective mosquitoes over the season of e\u03bb (ta+t b ) = e \u03bbata e \u03bb b t b . Setting\u03bb = 0 in (14.11) gives the critical average mosquito level,n * m >n * m , above which WN can invade a seasonally variable population and below which it cannot (Fig. 14.6b) . Provided the lower of the two mosquito population levels, n a m , is below the thresholdn * m , diseaseoutbreak control requires only that the higher level, n b m , be reduced such that the average mosquito densityn * m <n * m . We therefore expect WN virus to be easier to control in more seasonal northern regions than in warmer southern regions where the population remains constant aboven * m year-round.",

By way of contrast, the mass-action model predicts the disease will die out in regions of low bird density.

However, it is the applications that allow us to move the science forward and, more often than not, the applications also lead to a new generation of models that promise to keep mathematicians employed for considerable time to come. 0 = Det(J\u2212\u03bbI) = \u03bb \u03bb + d m + m l b l d m (\u03bb 3 + a 1 \u03bb 2 + a 2 \u03bb + a 3 ), (14.16) where I is the 5 \u00d7 5 identity matrix and a 1 > 0, a 2 > 0. The zero root of the 5th order polynomial comes from the steady-state condition b l = d m (m l + d l )/m l that means the disease-free mosquito population is constant. For a 3 > 0, and a 1 a 2 > a 3 , by the Roth-Hurwitz conditions, all roots of the cubic polynomial in \u03bb have negative real parts. Some algebra shows that a 1 a 2 > a 3 , since",

Although this exercise is somewhat redundant with the earlier R 0 calculations, it provides an alternative and pedagogically useful perspective.We use linear analysis to calculate the disease growth rate for the twolevel mosquito population shown in Fig. 14. 6a. To simplify the ODE system (14.9), we non-dimensionalise by scaling time t with the quantity 1/\u03ba by setting \u03c4 = \u03bat, scaling all parameters to \u03ba, and scaling the bird and mosquito densities by the initial bird density N * B . In the resulting dimensionless system (14.14), the two bird compartments s b and i b indicate the fraction of the initial bird density in susceptible and infected classes, with the total live bird density 0The four mosquito compartments l m , s m , e m , and i m , represent larval, susceptible, exposed, and infected females scaled to the initial bird density, with the total female mosquito population density 0 \u2264 n m = (l m + s m + e m + i m ).
