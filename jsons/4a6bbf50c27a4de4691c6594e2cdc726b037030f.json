Such distress is associated with alterations in immune function, including an elevated risk of viral respiratory tract infections. In this light, the possible effects of Ayurveda, a traditional system of medicine promoted by the Indian government as an \"immune booster\", are examined from the point of view of psychoneuroimmune mechanisms as well as the \"meaning response\" described by Moerman. It was found that many of the measures advocated in their guidelines could positively influence immunity either by direct effects on symptoms of depression or anxiety, or through their symbolic significance. Therefore, it is possible that such traditional practices could be beneficial both in terms of psychological quality of life, and in terms of moderating the risk of infection. -+, seen as a treatment for throat diseases Key: +, present; -, absent \"Ayurveda and COVID-19: where psychoneuroimmunology and the meaning response meet\" \uf0b7 Increased stress and subsyndromal mental health concerns are common responses to the COVID-19 outbreak.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}, {"text": "\uf0b7 These responses may affect immune response to respiratory infections.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}, {"text": "\uf0b7 Traditional medical methods, such as Ayurveda, have been proposed as a method to improve immunity.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}, {"text": "\uf0b7 Such methods may operate via psychoneuroimmune mechanisms, as well as through neurally mediated responses to their cultural and symbolic significance.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "The meaning response and psychoneuroimmunity: an analysis of the Indian", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "With over 2,400,000 cases and 170,000 deaths reported to date (April 21 st , 2020), the COVID-19 pandemic is a global health crisis with an actual or potential impact on citizens of all nations. This outbreak has already had a significant impact on mental health, especially in vulnerable groups such as healthcare workers (Rajkumar, 2020) . Besides causing distress in their own right, these psychological symptoms have the potential to adversely impact immune functioning. Psychosocial factors such as stress, anxiety and depression are associated with increased susceptibility to viral upper respiratory infections (Pedersen et al., 2010) and can influence the immune response to the influenza vaccine (Whittaker, 2018) .

Both these models -psychoneuroimmunology and the meaning response -are valuable in understanding the effect of treatments that do not work via a conventional \"scientific\" paradigm, and are not mutually exclusive; a \"meaningful\" intervention could modulate immune function through its effects on psychological distress.

For some, there is already putative evidence of a cellular mechanism, at least in vitro, which could modulate psychoneuroimmune pathways in a positive way; in others, the effect can only be inferred from evidence of efficacy in alleviating psychological distress or in providing a symbolic meaning related to health, well-being and protection against specific diseases. While there is no direct evidence that the \"meaning response\" can affect immune function, it may be associated with alterations in immune-inflammatory activity in vivo, as well as with reduced stress, anxiety and mood, mediated through effects on mesolimbic and mesocortical brain circuits (Oken, 2008) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 795, "end": 807, "text": "(Oken, 2008)", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "here)"}, {"text": "The relevance of these effects to psychological and immune function during the COVID-19 outbreak requires direct experimental testing, and the Government's guidelines themselves recommend that these measures be used only side-by-side with appropriate hygienic precautions, and that consultation in a medical setting should be sought immediately if symptoms suggestive of COVID-19 emerge. If they can be confirmed, such effects would be consistent with anthropological perspectives which show that there is no irreconcilable difference between Ayurvedic and \"biological\" models of mind-body medicine (Lang, 2013), with psychoneuroimmunology and the meaning response providing potential \"missing links\" between the two.
