The discordant cases were evaluated again in concert to reach a consensus diagnosis. The data were transferred to a PC workstation (Sun Microsystems, AW4.0_02) where the DWI data were postprocessed using Functool 2 (GE Medical Systems, Milwaukee, WI, USA). EPI distortion was corrected automatically. A user\u2010defined ROI was placed in the center of the lesion, and the largest fitting circle or ellipse was positioned centrally. Since the margins of the lesions were irregular, ROIs could not be made with the same size and shape. The ROI selections were guided with the use of conventional T1WI, T2WI, and fat\u2010suppressed STIR images, matching the coordinates of the lesions, and with the operator blinded to the ADC map signal. The same circle was then moved over the same area on the contralateral (normal) hip for measurement of the ADC. The average ADC is the mean diffusivity of three main diffusion directions (Dxx, Dyy, and Dzz), which indicates the overall evaluation of diffusion ability in each voxel. ADC was calculated using the following formula: ADC = (Dxx + Dyy + Dzz)/3, where Dxx, Dyy, and Dzz are the mean ADCs in the x, y, and z directions, respectively.",

AVN represents a compromised circulation of blood to an area of bone. Existing hypotheses regarding its pathogenesis include vascular thrombosis, fat embolism, and vasculitis (9, 14); however, the precise mechanism behind the development of AVN in SARS patients is still not clear. One study suggested that the use of steroids may be a factor (2). Another recent study reported that angiotensin\u2010converting enzyme 2 is a functional receptor for the SARS coronavirus (15), which suggests that the coronavirus itself may lead to the development of AVN.",

            "text": "DWI is an MRI technique that allows the noninvasive examination of tissue structures at a molecular level (16). By applying equal and opposite gradients on either side of a refocusing lobe in a standard pulse sequence, diffusion sequences can identify subtle interstitial movement of water. In the absence of motion, tissue that is initially dephased becomes rephased by an applied equal and opposite gradient. In contrast, in the presence of motion, protons in tissue that is initially dephased do not become rephased by the equal and opposite gradient. The amount of recorded signal loss resulting from movement between the gradients is used as a marker of cellular diffusion or interstitial movement of water, and allows indirect evaluation of the tissue structure (17). The degree of signal attenuation due to diffusion in a voxel on a DWI sequence is logarithmically dependent on the ADC of that voxel and the b\u2010value (18).",

            "text": "DWI was recently introduced for the evaluation of bone marrow (3, 4, 5, 6, 7). Some studies used DWI to evaluate vertebral compression fractures and showed that pathologic compression fractures were hyperintense, but that benign compression vertebral fractures were relatively hypointense (4). These studies suggest that hypercellularity by tumor cells reduced the extracellular space and mobility of water protons, leading to hyperintense diffusion\u2010weighted images. Another study found that metastases could be either hypointense or hyperintense on DWI (3). Jaramillo et al (7) studied changes in diffusion with increasing duration of femoral head ischemia in piglets, and found that ADC decreased 26% after three hours of maximal abduction, and increased a mean of 27% after six hours and a mean of 75% after 96 hours after femoral neck ligature (7). The time\u2010dependent changes in diffusion may reflect restriction of diffusion by cytotoxic edema, and tissue destruction leading to increased diffusion. A study by Nonomura et al (19) suggested a positive correlation between ADC value and bone marrow cellularity, with that fatty marrow having more restricted diffusion.",

One study revealed that the mean ADC values were 0.23 \u00d7 10\u20133 mm2/second in normal vertebral bodies (18), which is a lower value than that in our study. In our study the mean ADC in the normal femoral head was 0.47 \u00d7 10\u20133 mm2/second. The difference is probably due to the difference in hematopoietic states between the two studies.",

            "text": "Hematopoietic cells are sensitive to anoxia and usually die within 6\u201312 hours after the blood supply is removed. Osteocytes usually die within 12\u201348 hours, and marrow fat cells usually die within five days (20). Repair begins at the interface between necrotic and viable bone. Capillaries and undifferentiated mesenchymal cells grow into the dead marrow spaces, the macrophages degrade dead cellular and fat debris, and then mesenchymal cells differentiate into osteoblasts or fibroblasts (21). In our study the mean ADC in AVN was markedly increased compared to the normal femoral head (1.66 \u00d7 10\u20133 mm2/second vs. 0.47 \u00d7 10\u20133 mm2/second, P < 0.0001). In normal conditions, the trabeculae and fat cells may cause structural tortuosity, but when hematopoietic cells, osteocytes, and marrow fat cells die, the matrix components break down and the water diffusion in bone marrow becomes more active (20), leading to increased diffusion and an increased ADC. One study suggested that a smaller b\u2010value increased the influence of perfusion but decreased the sensitivity to diffusion (22). When repair begins, capillaries grow into the dead marrow spaces. This perfusion effect could also be one of the reasons for the increased ADC values in our study, even though a high b\u2010value (1000 seconds/mm2) was used. Technical reasons may also account for differences in ADC values between various studies, such as an increased diffusion fraction and a decrease of perfusion contribution by sampling with multiple high b\u2010value acquisitions, correction of bulk motion, T2 shine\u2010through, etc.",

Second, limited spatial resolution, large magnetic susceptibility, and chemical shift artifacts may have resulted in severe geometric distortion and signal dropout (23). Third, because of the large magnetic susceptibility variations in the hip, the commercial EPI pulse sequence does not produce good diffusion\u2010weighted images. However, since our results were focused mainly on the measurement of ADC values, the image quality was not vitally important to this study.",
