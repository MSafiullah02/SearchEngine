We analyzed data obtained from physical market survey data for 2,782 individuals from 27 species, with 2,420 individuals reported in early surveys and 362 individuals reported in later surveys (2003)(2004)(2005)(2006)(2007)(2008)(2009)(2010)(2011)(2012)(2013)(2014)(2015) and online surveys (February 2017 to January 2019). We compared information on asking prices and what species were traded using two comparative approaches to analyze how species composition may have changed over time (physical markets and online platforms; pre-Internet and Internet era). In comparison with the five previous market surveys, we did not find a statistically significant difference between species and availability of species offered for sale when comparing physical bird markets and online markets. In all data sets, biological factors such as wingspan were significant factors in explaining price variation. We conclude that sustained monitoring is needed to make direct comparisons between the trade platforms. With a continued increase of wildlife trade on online platforms, we recommend increased regulation and enforcement of wildlife trade laws.",

            "text": "Modernization of transport and increased interconnectivity has eased the way online purchases can be made, and as a result, enabled the trade of millions of wild animals to be more accessible and quicker (Karesh et al 2005) . Theoretically, the complex Q3 interactions of markets, both physical and online markets, as well as legal and illegal, have been explored to a limited extent (Fischer 2004) . To date, there have only been a number of studies that examined this market place transition quantitatively. The challenges in making direct comparisons between physical markets and online platforms range from disjointed time periods, nuanced social differences in consumer buying behavior, as well as differences in survey methods and efforts. Nijman et al (2019) directly compared open animal markets and online markets in trade of wild cats and revealed that there is indeed a directional shift of trade toward online platforms but this differs generally between countries. An increased presence of enforcement agencies in many traditional markets may have also contributed to the shift; however, the rate of change occurs at varying degrees dependent on factors such as geographic location and infrastructure limitations. 9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54 55",

Traditionally, birds are kept as pets in many societies around the world but probably no where more so than in Southeast Asia (Lin 2005; Nijman et al 2018) .

Legal and illegal trade in live raptor species have been reported globally, for example, in Indonesia (Nijman et al 2009 , Eaton et al 2016 , Japan (Vall-llosera and Su 2018), and Russia (Wyatt 2009 (Wyatt , 2011 .

Online wildlife trade has also been expanding; in a quick assessment over a 23-day period in 2018 revealed over 200 species offered for sale on Facebook (Phassaraudomsak and Krishnasamy 2018) , while an another 18-month study found nearly 1200 individuals from 42 species offered for sale; the majority of these species were not allowed to be traded commercially (Siriwat et al 2019) . One of the reasons for this increased popularity is that social media plays an integral role in Thailand's modern society, with over 50 million Facebook users, earning a rank of eighth globally among Facebook users (Leesanguansuk 2018). Enforcement agencies and Facebook has indeed cracked down on wildlife trade on social media platforms; however, in a catemouse manner, traders consistently reopen groups or use maneuvers to evade from regulators and authorities, as a result, trade still exists.",

For market data, we conducted a literature review of previous surveys using two comparative approaches to analyze how species on offer may have changed over time. For recent online data, we report our findings on online trade in raptors over a two-year data monitoring period, collecting information on species on offer and asking prices. First, we made a comparison based on trade platform, that is, market (data from physical brick-and-mortar markets) and online (ecommerce and social media platforms) surveys. Second, we made a temporal comparison, using the \"Internet era\" as a defining marker: pre-Internet (before 1995) and post-Internet (after 1995). We defined the start of the Internetera as the year 1995 as in that year for the first time computers outsold TV sets (Newell 2001) . We created models to explain the variability in the number and composition of the species in trade, using predictor variables such as body size (wingspan), clutch size, migratory status, and conservation status. Using data on asking prices from our two-year study, we explored the aforementioned variables to explain variation in price and to analyze temporal trends and seasonality. Based on our findings, we recommend increased monitoring and improved legal protection and enforcement for species.",

A small percentage of the trade does occur out of sight, in back alleys or at traders' premises, and can only be observed when one is accepted as part of the group; researching this type of trade is much more complex and, to the best of our knowledge, with respect to the trade in raptors, has been rarely reported. In practise, a large part of the online trade in raptors is not all that different from the trade in an open, public space. It is in the best interest of the sellers to ensure that as many potential customers have Q7 opportunity to see and buy whatever they have on offer. While a small Q8 proportion of wildlife trade occurs out of sight, in the \"back alleys of the Internet\", or even on the dark web (Harrison et al 2016) , this is very small and in the case of the global trade in raptors as pets or to be used in falconry is largely irrelevant. The online trade in raptors as pets occurs in the open. For instance, many of the Facebook groups where birds of prey are offered for sale are classified as \"open\" or \"public\" and have their privacy settings set at a level where it is very easy to observe or join a group. Once joined, posts and comments can be seen by all those that are part of that group, as well as everyone else who wishes to do so. The number of members that have joined groups is often in the 10,000s e in our study group member volume ranged from 7,763 to 31,557, with a mean of 18,042 members per group at the last period of monitoring. As such, one can have a reasonable expectation to be observed, perhaps even more so than when entering a public space such as a town square or an animal market. Indeed Burkell et al (2014) concluded \".the online social spaces are indeed loci of public display rather than private revelation: online profiles are structured with the view that \"everyone\" can see them, even if the explicitly intended audience is more limited. These social norms are inconsistent with the claim that social media are private spaces; instead, it appears that participants view and treat online social networks as public venues.\"",

Thereby, the researchers used the acknowledgment as a form of consent to access closed groups (Hinsley et al 2016) . While other studies do not specify methods carried out for data collection but choose not to disclose specifics of forum name such as site name and address (Sung and Fong 2018) . Machine learning techniques are also becoming incorporated to investigate illegal wildlife trade on social media using the three-step idea of mining, filtering, and identifying data. However, this approach is still in its early stages, and frameworks still need to be explored particularly related to data security and privacy requirements where researchers are based (Di Minin et al 2018).",

Although the number of raptors observed has clearly reduced since the surveys conducted by McClure and Chaiyaphun (1971) compared with subsequent studies which report very few individuals and species, we now have an equal variety of species and large numbers offered online. In both our models, wingspan Q17 (which is the proxy indicator for body mass) is consistently the factor which explains availability and even price, where smaller birds were offered more frequently and also at lower prices. Although the numbers of raptors offered online are comparatively low, the sustained trade potentially poses a conservation threat to species if illegal trapping and harvesting of owls from natural populations remain unregulated.",

The purpose for trade has now extended Q18 beyond traditional functions, such as falconry (Roldan-Clara et al 2014; Wyatt 2009; MaMing et al 2014) , but appears to be traded for general exotic pet purposes as evident in this study. At the international scale, past records of irregular or illegitimate importeexport trade documents have previously been an issue (Shepherd, 2012; Panter et al 2018) . Domestically, there still needs to be increased studies on the impact of harvest on wild raptor populations as Thailand has been recognized as an important raptor migration site (Decandido et al 2004) . Furthermore, it has been noted that domestic markets are often overlooked and underreported (Phelps et al 2010) . The domestic trade of raptors recorded here is illegal under Thailand's wildlife laws, without government approved paperwork, none of which was offered. 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59  60  61  62  63  64 Challenges There are only a few studies that have directly compared the shift in wildlife market platforms. Bird markets in Indonesia are one of the places that have been thoroughly studied over time, from traditional markets (Nijman and Nekaris unpubl Q19 . data) to modern contemporary markets (Iqbal 2016 , Gunawan et al 2017  Table 5 ). Iqbal (2016) monitored five specialized birds of prey Facebook groups for, on average, 8 months over 2015. Three of the five Facebook groups were based in Java (but of course people from outside this island are able to join and participate), and these were responsible for about two-thirds of the birds of prey that were offered for sale. Gunawan et al (2017) monitored 38 general wildlife trade and specialized birds of prey Facebook groups for 11 months over 2015, with about 90% of the offers originating from Facebook groups that were based in Java. Nijman Q20 and Nekaris (unpublished) monitored 15 bird markets in eight cities in Java from April 2014 to July 2019 (Nijman and Nekaris 2017; Nijman et al 2018) and recorded all birds of prey that were openly offered for sale. Despite differences in methodologies Q21 and survey efforts, we find similar links in species offered for sale, specially the migrant species which also fly over Thailand and mainland Southeast Asia such as the Japanese sparrowhawk Accipiter gularis and Chinese goshawk A. soloensis, as well as sales of nonmigratory species such as mountain hawk-eagles N. nipalensis which must have been imported from the mainland and Thailand are one of the closed source countries.",

A key reason is the increased desire for the closure of wet wildlife markets for a variety of reasons. There is evidence that physical markets are used as platforms to trade both legal and illegal wildlife (Fischer 2004; Moyle 2017) . The drive for the sale of high-value derivative wildlife products such as ivory to close markets is a high profile example aimed to reduce the poaching of African elephants. Another example Q22 is the push for closures of physical wildlife markets because of them being potential source as a zoonotic disease hotspot (Karesh et al 2005) . In 2002, the outbreak of a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus in humans was linked to Himalayan palm civets (Paguma larvata) in wet markets in Shenzen, China (Webster 2004; Bell et al 2004) . In 2019, an outbreak of a novel coronavirus (COVID-19), which causes respiratory illness, was linked to Huanan wet market in Wuhan, China (Yee et al 2020) . This consequence of the outbreak to the domestic and global economy has led the Chinese government to impose a comprehensive ban on the trade and consumption of wild animals, with the exception of for medicinal purposes (Xinhua News 2020).",

The challenge to properly obtain data on what wildlife is being sold, the volumes and turnover rates and market dynamics are even harder to estimate when the trade goes underground. The important thing needed to identify a shift is thorough monitoring of both platforms to closely track it. Moreover, the same issues that follow physical markets of illegal items being laundered through legal trade platforms are still evident even among online market platforms (Gao and Clark 2014) . However, law enforcement actions are not the same on both platforms. Traditional markets may require authorities going to shops that illegally sell such as city markets, border markets, trading hubs at ports, and stores. Online traders, on the other hand, are more flexible and traders do not necessarily need to have a pet shop. Conservative wildlife trade legislation in many places does not currently include the online trade. The potential threat remains that, if further bans of trade are extended onto online platforms Q23 , it may potentially even drive traders to go underground into the dark web and will pose further challenges for law enforcement agencies (Harrison et al 2016) .",

The link between the growth of social media and exploitation of threatened species for pet purposes is somewhat subjective but highlighted for the trade of raptors and owls (Kitson and Nekaris 2017; Panter et al 2018) . Recently, more research is being dedicated to investigate the role and impact of social media on legal and illegal trade of birds (Iqbal 2016; Siriwat et al 2020) and other species (Martin et al 2018 , Di Minin et al 2018 . The combination of increased monitoring trade on these novel platforms, with continued surveying of traditional markets to ensure no increase in numbers are offered for sale Q24 , will be essential in helping inform wildlife regulations and policies, not only of raptors but of all wildlife species targeted for trade.",
