            "text": "Interstitial syndrome and consolidation Interstitial syndrome refers to processes (water, infection, infiltration) in the pulmonary interstitium. In COVID-19, interstitial syndrome most likely results from acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) or pneumonia.(11) Interstitial syndrome is characterised by B lines, which are vertical hyperechoic reverberations between the ribs, in contrast to the horizontally oriented A lines, which are seen in the normal lung. Further, subpleural consolidation presents as indistinct hyperechoic areas with surrounding B lines. In severe cases, consolidation can resemble the liver, which is known as hepatisation of the lungs. (17) Although non-specific, B lines are common in COVID-19, with Peng et al. (9) first to report their appearance. This was confirmed by other groups. (10, (14) (15) (16) In severe disease with significant oedema or consolidation, a \"white lung\" can be present. (11) For the detection of interstitial syndrome in non-COVID patients, the accuracy of ultrasound (95%; sensitivity 98%; specificity 88%) surpasses chest radiography (72%; sensitivity 60%, specificity 100%) and auscultation (55%; sensitivity 34%; specificity 90%). (18) Ultrasound can also distinguish between cardiogenic and noncardiogenic pulmonary oedema (8) and can be deployed rapidly to exclude alternative causes of hypoxia in intensive care. (19) For consolidation, ultrasound has an accuracy of 97% (sensitivity 93%; specificity 93%), compared with 75% for chest radiography (sensitivity 68%; specificity 95%) and 36% for auscultation (sensitivity 8%; specificity 100%). (18) Pleural inflammation Inflammation of the pleura causes pleural thickening and disruption, which can be visualised on ultrasound. Pleural thickening has been observed in COVID-19 pneumonitis. (10) (11) (12) (14) (15) (16) Although pleural thickening appears to be sensitive for COVID-19 pneumonitis, it is non-specific, being present to some degree in all forms of pneumonia.",

Furthermore, effusion of <500 ml is difficult to detect on chest radiography; in a ventilated ICU patient lying on their back, the fluid will be even more difficult to detect due to its dependent nature. (17) These factors result in a diagnostic accuracy of 47% (sensitivity 39%; specificity 85%) for pleural effusion diagnosis on chest radiography.

The diagnostic accuracy of POCUS for pleural effusions is 93% (sensitivity 92%; specificity 93%), superior to chest radiography (above) and auscultation (accuracy 61%; sensitivity 42%; specificity 90%).

CONCLUSION POCUS has a high sensitivity for the pulmonary manifestations of COVID-19, such as ARDS and consolidation. Furthermore, POCUS can be used to monitor treatment response.

            "text": "INTRODUCTION In the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, many sick patients require intensive care support. So far, chest radiography and computed tomography (CT) have been the main imaging methods for the assessment of the cardiorespiratory system. The present study examines the role of point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) of the lungs in the intensive care unit (ICU). BACKGROUND POCUS is the performance and interpretation of ultrasound at the bedside. POCUS emerged in the late 1980s following the development of compact, high-quality, portable ultrasound machines. The best-known use of POCUS has been in the detection of haemoperitoneum in abdominal trauma. First described by Shackford in 1993, it is also called the Focused Assessment with Sonography For Trauma (FAST)",

            "text": "scan.(1) Several studies have shown POCUS is safe and efficacious, and it is now increasingly used in emergency departments.(2) Lung ultrasound was pioneered by Daniel Lichtenstein, an intensivist in Paris, who noted that sonographic artefacts could differentiate between common lung diseases, and subsequently, developed the BLUE protocol for dyspnoeic patients beingadmitted to the ICU.(3) The BLUE protocol diagnosed six common respiratory diseases, including pulmonary oedema and pneumonia, with 90.5% accuracy. The FALLS protocol (Fluid Administration Limited by Lung Sonography) from the same study group showed that ultrasound can assess the volume status in the critically ill, enabling rapid decisions in shocked patients.(4) Today, POCUS is used in the ICU for acutely dyspnoeic patients, cardiopulmonary monitoring in circulatory failure, cardiac arrest, and undifferentiated hypotension. WHY SHOULD POCUS BE A PRIORITY IN COVID? POCUS has many practical advantages over other imaging methods in the COVID-19 pandemic. POCUS is a bedside test; therefore, it can be completed without moving the patient from the ICU or ward. Lack of transfer reduces the exposure of other healthcare staff, patients, and visitors to the virus. Further, the transfer of intubated, critically unwell patients is fraught with risk; POCUS avoids this risk. Staff who would ordinarily be involved in the transfer are freed to undertake other duties.",
