However, comparable dosages for haplo-HSCT remain unclear. We compared and evaluated the effects of ATG-T (7.5 mg/kg) or ATG-F (20 mg/kg) dosages in a relatively homogenous population in haplotype HSCT settings. Patients administered ATG-T 7.5 mg/kg (n = 81) or ATG-F 20 mg/kg (n = 35) as part of GVHD prophylaxis during haplo-HSCT were enrolled. Incidence and severity of GVHD, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection, and immune cell recovery were compared using the Mann-Whitney U rank test and chi-square test. Cumulative incidences of GVHD, EBV infection and its subgroups, and relapse mortality were computed; overall survival (OS) was analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method, with the log-rank test used for univariate comparison. Risk factors for OS were analyzed by the Cox proportional hazards model. Incidence and cumulative incidence of all grades of acute GVHD and subgroups were comparable in both groups (all p > 0.05); however, cumulative incidence of any grade and limited chronic GVHD was significantly higher in the ATG-T group (p = 0.002, p = 0.007, respectively). Cumulative incidences of EBV infections, EBV-DNAemia, and EBV-related diseases were similar; relapse mortality and OS rates were comparable between both groups (all p > 0.05). ATG-T dosage (7.5 mg/kg) appeared comparable to ATG-F dosage (20 mg/kg) for haplo-HSCT. Currently approved ATG-T and ATG-F doses appear efficient to balance the risk-benefit ratio of GVHD, OS, relapse mortality, and EBV infection in haplo-HSCT.",

The \"GIAC protocol\" comprises: granulocytecolony-stimulating factor (G-CSF)-mobilized grafts (G), intensified immunosuppression with cyclosporine using the whole process of conditioning chemotherapy (I), antithymocyte globulin (ATG) for in vivo T cell depletion (A), and combined use of bone marrow with peripheral blood stem cells as the source of grafts (C) [2] .",

Nevertheless, its use is associated with an elevated incidence of infections, particularly viral infections, when high doses of ATG are administered. The effect of high doses of ATG on relapse after HSCT is under dispute. Whereas some retrospective studies suggest that ATG increases relapses, randomized studies have not produced such results. Balancing the risk-benefit ratio is the focus of the current study, as several issues remain unresolved regarding the use of ATG in HSCT; in particular, the optimal dosage of ATG has not been precisely identified.",

Different doses are required in HSCT between the two currently available brands due to the differences regarding the source of the immunizing antigen and the methods used for the development of the antibodies. Additionally, the doses also depend on the donor type (human leukocyte antigen [HLA]-identical sibling, unrelated, haplo-identical donors, etc.) and conditioning regimens (myeloablative, reduced-intensity, low-intensity immunosuppressive conditioning) [4] . For HLA-matched-sibling transplants, a recent randomized study supported the use of ATG-F at a dose of 30 mg/kg [5] , whereas both randomized and retrospective studies indicated the use of ATG-T at a dose of approximately 5 mg/kg [6, 7] . For matched-unrelated donor transplants, ATG-F and ATG-T doses are indicated at 60 mg/kg and 4.5-7.5 mg/kg, respectively [4, [8] [9] [10] . Based on consensus opinion, the European Blood and Marrow Transplant Group recommends 30 mg/kg of ATG-F or 7.5 mg/kg of ATG-T, divided into three doses administered on days 3, 2, and 1 (for 8/8 HLA allele-matched, unrelated donor transplantation) [4] .

Overall survival (OS) was defined as the time interval from the time of transplantation until the time of death. The cumulative incidence of aGVHD was evaluated within the first 100 days post-transplantation. Relapse was defined as the presence of > 5% marrow blasts and/or reappearance of underlying diseases. Transplant-related mortality (TRM) was defined as mortality for transplant-related complications, including GVHD and infections. Mortality from disease relapse was defined as relapse mortality. The cumulative incidence of aGVHD and cGVHD was estimated by considering the corresponding type of GVHD as an event of interest, and death without GVHD as a competing event. The cumulative incidence of EBV infection and subsets was estimated as an event of interest, and death without EBV infection as a competing event. The cumulative incidence of relapse mortality was estimated as an event of interest and death with TRM as a competing event. The cumulative incidence method was applied to compute the incidence of GVHD, EBV infection and its subsets, and relapse mortality. OS was analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method, with the log-rank test used for univariate comparison. Risk factors with values of p < 0.05 in univariate analyses were entered into a Cox proportional hazards model to determine their effects on OS. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS 21.0 software (SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) and R software (R version 4.03; The R foundation for Statistical Computing, www.R-project.org).

            "text": "The incidence of GVHD is the most interesting aspect of our comparative study. The probable cumulative incidences of any grade of aGVHD and cGVHD in our study were higher than those reported by Paiano et al. [17] . We inferred that the differences in HLA consistency in donor/recipient pairs and the free time from immunosuppressants after HSCT were the major reasons for this discrepancy between the two studies. Two-thirds of the enrolled population received HLA-identical or not HLA-matched HSCT; 100% of patients continued immunosuppressive post-transplant therapy, which was associated with a lower cumulative incidence of any grade of aGVHD and cGVHD in Paiano et al.'s study. In our study, all patients underwent haplo-HSCT, and more than half of the patients discontinued all immunosuppressants within 30 days after haplo-HSCT for prophylaxis from relapses or viral infections. Moreover, the cumulative incidence of any grade of cGVHD was higher in the ATG-T group than in the ATG-F group due to the increase of the cumulative incidence of the limited cGVHD. We thought that the duration of immunosuppression achieved by 20 mg/kg of ATG-F is longer than that achieved by 7.5 mg/kg of ATG-T. Fortunately, the limited and controlled cGVHD may improve the graft-versus-leukemia effect and reduce relapse. Another point of interest in our study was the viral infections, particularly the EBV infection. ATG treatment is considered a risk factor for PTLD development [18, 19] . Before 2000, the mortality rate (84.6%) after HSCT was attributed to PTLDs, the most serious consequence of EBV infections; even in the rituximab era, the mortality due to EBV infection was higher than 72% (95% CI 54-96%) in patients with three risk factors for EBV-PTLD [20, 21] . Thus, monitoring and pre-treatment of the EBV infection in the early phase is crucial. However, studies that directly compare different ATG preparations and dosages for the risk of EBV infections are rare. In our study, we compared the incidence of EBV infections and its subsets. The cumulative incidence of EBV infections and EBV-DNAemia tended to be higher in the ATG-T group, with a p value near 0.05. This may imply that the immunosuppression achieved by 7.5 mg/kg ATG-T is more effective than that achieved by 20 mg/kg ATG-F in early phase after HSCT. Our prior study about EBV-CTL reconstitution in haplo-HSCT patients treated with 7.5 mg/kg ATG-T for GVHD prophylaxis also confirmed that the low 30-day level of EBV-CTLs after haplo-HSCT is comparable with that in healthy persons [11] . Low levels of EBV-CTLs are not good for the control of EBV infection. Fortunately, the immunological recovery delay resulted in only a minor increase in EBV-DNAemia but not in EBV-related diseases; the former is e a s y t o c o n t r o l b y r e d u c i n g o r t a m p e r i n g t h e immunosuppression.",

Our observation of relatively higher CD3 + and CD8 + T cell levels was also supported by Alexandersson and colleagues [22] . They noted that the higher CD8 + T cell levels in EBV infections were inferred to the immune response against EBV infections. In line with their findings, in the 27 patients involved in the immune cell recovery analysis in our study, EBV infections appeared in 11/17 patients in the ATG-T group and in 3/10 in the ATG-F group.",

Mensen et al. [23] confirmed the comparable outcomes between a lower dose of ATG-T (6-8 mg/kg) and a higher dose of ATG-F (20-60 mg/kg) in HSCT. They did not observe any significantly delayed T cell subset reconstitution between low dosages of ATG-T 5-10 mg/kg and high dosages of ATG-F 20-60 mg/kg. Although the incidence of EBV reactivation was similar in the ATG-T and ATG-F groups, the EBV copy counts of > 10 4 copies/10 5 peripheral blood mononuclear cells, and the occurrence of PTLD were only found in the ATG-T group. Oostenbrink et al. [24] compared two rabbit ATG products, ATG-Genzyme (ATG-T, total 6-10 mg/kg), and ATG-Fresenius (ATG-F, total 45-60 mg/kg), in 58 pediatric acute leukemia patients (n = 42 ATG-T; n = 16 ATG-F) with HSCT from an unrelated donor. Their study confirmed that ATG-T 6-10 mg/kg and ATG-F 45-60 mg/kg were comparable in terms of immunity reconstitution and clinical outcomes. Our study has some limitations. Our study was a retrospective observational study that analyzed 110 patients who received haplo-HSCT at a single center; moreover, the physicians were responsible for the choice of the type of ATG. Although the study population was relatively homogenous in the transplantation process, the lack of a rigorous study design and the small sample size were major limitations. Therefore, our observations should be confirmed by further larger and randomized studies.",
