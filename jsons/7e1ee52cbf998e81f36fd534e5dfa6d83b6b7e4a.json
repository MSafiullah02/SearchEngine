Since nasal mucosa is contiguous with paranasal sinus mucosa, the term sinusitis is often used interchangeably with rhinosinusitis [1] ; the latter term will be used in this chapter. Rhinosinusitis can be acute (less than 4 weeks' duration), subacute (4-12 weeks), or chronic (greater than 12 weeks) [2] . Epidemiology Rhinosinusitis is extremely common; in a 2008 national survey, 1 in 7 adults reported having been diagnosed with rhinosinusitis in the previous 12 months [3] . The estimated prevalence of chronic rhinosinusitis in the USA ranges from 2 % to 16 % [4] . Women are disproportionally affected compared to men, and both acute and chronic rhinosinusitis are most prevalent in middle-aged adults compared to any other age group [3] . Primary care physicians and specialists manage rhinosinusitis with equivalent technical efficiency, with primary care physicians providing less costly treatment [5] . Chronic rhinosinusitis has a high economic burden; in 2007, total expenditures in the United States were estimated to be $8.6 billion [4] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 271, "end": 274, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 440, "end": 443, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 613, "end": 616, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 705, "end": 708, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 880, "end": 883, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 1047, "end": 1050, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 1187, "end": 1190, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Rhinosinusitis"}, {"text": "Rhinosinusitis is more common in patients with comorbid asthma and allergic rhinitis [6] .

Standard-dose amoxicillin-clavulanate (875 mg/125 mg twice daily), rather than amoxicillin alone, is recommended as first-line treatment due to the high prevalence of \u03b2-lactamase-producing H. influenzae [1] . However, standard-dose amoxicillin-clavulanate is inadequate for penicillinnon-susceptible (PNS) S. pneumoniae, which have a mutation in the penicillin-binding protein 3 that is unaffected by the addition of a \u03b2-lactamase inhibitor. Thus, in patients with certain risk factors, high-dose amoxicillinclavulanate (i.e., 2 g/125 mg twice daily) is recommended as first-line treatment. Risk factors for PNS include residence in geographic regions with high (10 %) endemic rates of PNS S. pneumoniae, severe infection (e.g., signs of systemic toxicity with fever of 39 C [102 F]), age >65 years, recent hospitalization, patients who are immunocompromised, or antibiotic use within the past month [1] .
