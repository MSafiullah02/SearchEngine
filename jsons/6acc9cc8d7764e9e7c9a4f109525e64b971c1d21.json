Since then, the virus has been detected in all continents [Nissen et al., 2002; Peret et al., 2002; Stockton et al., 2002; Cuevas et al., 2003; Freymuth et al., 2003; Peiris et al., 2003; Fodha et al., 2004] . Human metapneumovirus is the single human pathogen within the genus Metapneumovirus, subfamily Pneumovirinae, family Paramyxoviridae. Serological studies suggest that the virus has been circulating in humans for at least the past 60 years [van den Hoogen et al., 2001; Ebihara et al., 2003; Mejias et al., 2004] . However, recent evidence from molecular studies suggests that hMPV may have diverged from the avian metapneumovirus type C as early as 200 years ago [de Graaf et al., 2008; Yang et al., 2009] .",

Human infections occur mainly during the winter period and affect, in particular, young children, elderly people, and immunocompromised patients Bastien et al., 2003a; Falsey et al., 2003] . It was shown serologically that children under 5 years old were the most vulnerable and susceptible to contracting the virus [van den Hoogen et al., 2001; Ebihara et al., 2003; Regev et al., 2006] . Furthermore, hMPV can be detected in respiratory samples by reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) [Mackay et al., 2003; Maertzdorf et al., 2004; Bellau-Pujol et al., 2005] or real-time RT-PCR [Hopkins et al., 2008; Kaida et al., 2008] . In addition, several monoclonal antibodies were developed for immunofluorescence assays (IFA) [Ebihara et al., 2005; Landry et al., 2005; Gerna et al., 2006; Aslanzadeh et al., 2008] . Molecular studies have shown that hMPV strains can be divided into two major groups: A and B, and 4 minor groups: A1, A2, B1, and B2 [Bastien et al., 2003b; Boivin et al., 2004; .",

Human metapneumovirus infection was assessed in nasal aspirates received in the laboratory during the months of November to March in order to perform a comparison of hMPV rate with the other common cold viruses. It was reported that, the hMPV infection season is longer than that of hRSV or influenza viruses [van den Hoogen et al., 2003; Esper et al., 2004; Mackay et al., 2006] . As such, the number of positive cases may have been underestimated although it was shown previously that hMPV circulates predominantly during the winterspring period [Bastien et al., 2003a; van den Hoogen et al., 2003; Esper et al., 2004; Williams et al., 2004; Pitoiset et al., 2010] . The number and the percentage of hMPV detected in virus-negative samples during the epidemics of 2002-2003, 2003-2004, and 2004-2005 were 59 (10%), 17 (22.6%), and 52 (8.8%), respectively. The incidence of hMPV infections are reported in many other studies Williams et al., 2004] . It is also suggested that the number of hMPV infections is variable from one winter to another [Falsey et al., 2003; Mackay et al., 2006; Williams et al., 2006] .",

The rate of the different subgroups was not the same for each winter and the strain composition varied during each outbreak. The strains circulating in France were described in four previous studies Bouscambert-Duchamp et al., 2005; Foulongne et al., 2006; Pitoiset et al., 2010] . The first two studies reported only A1 and A2 subtypes of hMPV, while Foulongne et al. [2006] detected four subtypes of the virus with an A1 subgroup in predominance. The last study [Pitoiset et al., 2010] reports on a phylogenic analysis carried out on 100 strains isolated over 8 years, from 2002 to 2009 with alternative subgroup predominance. During the first winter 2002-2003, the A group was the most prevalent, with 87.5% of A2 subgroup being the most prominent. This repartition was also found in many other parts of the world [Esper et al., 2004; Mackay et al., 2004; Ludewick et al., 2005; Pitoiset et al., 2010] . Two studies described another pattern of circulation of the virus during the winter of [2002] [2003] in which a prevalent B1 subgroup was noted [Gerna et al., 2005; Gray et al., 2006] . For the winter of [2003] [2004] , no predominant group could be identified. The incidence of groups A and B were approximately the same, although the number of strains belonging to group B and A were nine and eight, respectively. The B2 and A2 subgroup were the most frequently identified with five strains for each cluster. During this same period in Italy (winter of [2003] [2004] , the A2 subtype was also the most prominent strain, even if other strains were present Gerna et al., 2005] . The rate of occurrence of group B was confirmed during the winter of 2004-2005 and represented 96% of all hMPV detected, including one hMPV B2 strain. Over the three winter periods, 46.5% of B1, 37.5% of A2, 8% of A1, and 8% of B2 strains were observed. These data are closely related to those proposed by Mackay et al. [2006] in a study carried out in Australia during the same period. In addition, both predominant subgroups found in 2002 and 2004 were the same (viz., A2 and B1).",

            "text": "The RNA fragment studied is small (405 bp), but some mutations that were found in this gene allowed us to discriminate between, and compare, the different isolates. The sequence analysis for the three epidemic periods showed two distinct genetic profiles. The first profile, found during the winter of 2002-2003 and 2004-2005 , seemed to be composed of two predominant strains showing exactly the same sequence (Cae03-6-31 and Cae05-40-27) which represented at least 52% of hMPV detected, increasing to 79.5% in 2002-2003. During these two winters (2002-2003 and 2004-2005) , the foremost strains belonged to the A2 and B1 subgroups, respectively. This finding corroborates previous observations [Mackay et al., 2006] . For the winter period 2003-2004, the isolated strains belonged to the four subgroups and, at the most, two identical sequences were found. Even if it is impossible to consider these isolates like different strains because the analysis was assessed on too short a RNA fragment, such heterogeneity was not observed during the other winter periods and might be considered as the beginning of a shift from group A to group B as confirmed by the data of 2004. A shift of this nature was reported previously [Agapov et al., 2006; Mackay et al., 2006; Oliveira et al., 2009] Despite the fact that the 2003-2004 study is incomplete and that the period studied was only from November to March, the rate of hMPV can still be evaluated each year and the molecular evolution of the viruses can be analyzed. Human metapneumovirus is circulating in Normandy at a rate equivalent to that described previously Bastien et al., 2003a; Boivin et al., 2003; Esper et al., 2004] . The present clinical study demonstrates that hMPV is responsible for LRI in the majority of cases studied. All the reported hMPV subgroups are present in France but not with the same incidence each year. The results confirm the genetic evolution of hMPV in Normandy with a switch from the A group to the B group being noted during the winter of 2003-2004. Finally, molecular tools developed for the M gene appear to be useful for diagnosis and molecular analysis, since the four subgroups are detected and can be discriminated between in a significant manner.",
