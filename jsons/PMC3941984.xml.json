            "text": "The attenuated measles vaccine offered the opportunity to considerably reduce measles-related morbidity and mortality. However, measles is still a public health issue with approximately 164,000 deaths in 2008 worldwide [1] and with a relative increase in reported cases in several European countries and in the United States, including cases in individuals after two doses of MMR vaccine [2], [3], [4], [5], [6]. Therefore, establishing effective measles immunity across the population is crucial and requires providing both immunization coverage and surveillance to detect new cases and outbreaks [7]. Despite measles control (but not eradication), questions still remain regarding the documented 2\u201310% primary failure rate after vaccination, and the immunogenetic causes of vaccine response heterogeneity and/or vaccine failure. Deeper understanding of the observed inter-individual differences in immune response to measles vaccine is needed to provide new insights for improving vaccine-induced humoral, cellular, and innate immune responses, and for designing better vaccines [8], [9].",

            "text": "The first line of defense, innate immunity, orchestrates host responses to prevent or reduce viral replication and spread until the adaptive immune system is switched on to eliminate the specific invading pathogen. Cellular viral sensors, type I and III interferons (IFNs, IFN\u03b1/\u03b2, IFN \u03bb1, IFN \u03bb2, IFN \u03bb3) and IFN-triggered antiviral proteins have long been recognized as crucial mediators of innate antiviral defense with important effects on the magnitude and quality of innate and adaptive immune responses. Important antiviral factors and pathways, such as the retinoic acid-inducible gene I protein (RIG-I/DDX58), melanoma differentiation associated protein-5 (MDA-5/IFIH1), mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (MAVS/VISA/IPS1/CARDIF), dsRNA-activated protein kinase R (PKR/EIF2AK2), the 2\u2032\u20135\u2032-oligoadenylate-synthetase (OAS) \u2013 ribonuclease L (RNASEL) pathway, Mx protein GTPases, adenosine deaminase, RNA-specific 1(ADAR), the ISG15 ubiquitin-like pathway and others play a role in viral sensing, control, pathogenesis and outcome of viral infections [10], [11], [12], [13]. Polymorphisms in IFN-stimulated antiviral effector genes and cellular viral sensors are potential genetic determinants of immune response heterogeneity that may influence the immune responses to viral vaccines by altering the functionality and antiviral effects of the corresponding proteins. Genetic variants in these genes have been implicated as important regulators of immunity and host response to infection [14], [15], [16], [17], [18], [19], [20], [21], [22], [23], [24].",

An intronic SNP in the DDX58 (RIG-I) gene (rs11795343) was associated with an allele dose-related increase (19%, calculated as the ratio, minus one, of the immune outcome observed for the homozygous minor allele genotype to the immune outcome observed for the homozygous major allele genotype, multiplied by 100%) in antibody levels (p\n = 0.01). This intronic SNP was found to be in LD (r\n2\n = 0.64) with a synonymous DDX58 SNP (rs3205166/Val800Val), which also demonstrated an allele dose relationship with higher neutralizing antibody levels (approximately 40% increase in antibodies), although this association did not reach statistical significance at p\n \u2264 0.01 (p\n = 0.017, Table 2). In addition, eight more DDX58 SNPs displayed suggestive associations with antibody levels in this racial group (p\n < 0.05, data not shown).

Furthermore, multiple previous genetic association studies revealed that polymorphisms in the MX1, OAS1, OASL and PKR genes correlate with response to IFN therapy and/or susceptibility to viruses such as WNV, HCV, HBV, SARS-coV, and measles virus [17], [18], [19], [20], [21], [22], [23], [24].",

Mitochondrial antiviral pathways involve the detection of viral RNA by cytosolic helicases belonging to the RIG-I-like helicase family (RIG-I/DDX58 and MDA5/IFIH1), and downstream signaling through interaction with the IPS-1 (VISA/MAVS/CARDIF) adaptor protein [49], [50]. In addition, vitamin A and its metabolites, which are known to affect measles replication and antibody responses after vitamin supplementation, are linked with RIG-I/DDX58 through RAR\u03b1 and IFN type I-dependent mechanism [51], [52]. Genetic variants within these antiviral sensor genes were associated with different measles-specific immune outcomes in our study (including common DDX58 genetic variants regulating both antibody responses, and measles-specific IFN-\u03b3 and IL-2 secretion in the Caucasian group), which is consistent with a recent report of the recognition of measles virus by RIG-I and MDA5 to instigate interferon-specific innate immune responses [53]. Interestingly, a common coding functional DDX58 polymorphism (rs10813831/Arg7Cys), known to modulate IFNB1 and DDX58 transcription in dendritic cells [54], and suggested as a plausible regulator of rubella vaccine-induced humoral immunity [15], was associated with measles-specific IFN-\u03b1 secretion in the African-American sample, although did not remain significant after adjusting for FDR (p\n = 0.005, q\n = 0.447, data not shown).",

The interferon-induced OAS1 protein is known to catalyze the synthesis of 2\u2032,5\u2032-oligoadenylates, which activate RNase L, resulting in antiviral (viral RNA degradation, inhibition of viral replication) and pro-apoptotic activities, and genetic polymorphisms in the coding genes have been linked to various immunological and infectious outcomes [21], [22], [23], [24]. The involvement of OAS genetic variants in regulating measles vaccine\u2013immune responses is highly plausible bearing in mind that OAS genetic variations are likely involved in modulating the adaptive immune responses to live attenuated rubella vaccine [14]. Particularly convincing is the association of OAS1 SNP rs10774671, a polymorphism with established functionality, with variations in measles-specific humoral immune responses (more than 3-fold increase associated with the homozygous minor allele genotype) in the African-American sample (p\n = 0.003). This genetic variant is located in intron 5, at the splice-acceptor site, and has been demonstrated to regulate splicing, resulting in isoforms with different enzyme activity [39], [55]. Recent data from the literature suggests that genetic variation in OAS1 (rs10774671) can alter viral replication in human lymphoid tissue and is a risk factor for infection with West Nile virus [39]. In addition, our previous work links this same polymorphism in addition to other OAS polymorphisms with variations in rubella vaccine-induced cytokine secretion [14].",

            "text": "Another interesting antiviral gene potentially associated with measles virus-specific immune variations is ADAR, which is involved in RNA editing (that substitutes adenosines by inosines) of cellular mRNA and viral dsRNA targets. Our data show evidence for an association of a nonsynonymous SNP (rs2229857/Arg384Lys, in LD with other significant ADAR SNPs, r\n2\n \u2265 0.96) with measles virus-specific cellular immunity (IFN-\u03b3 Elispot responses) in Caucasians (p\n = 0.01, Table 3). Consistent with the current findings, our previous rubella vaccine study demonstrated an increase in rubella-specific IFN-\u03b3 responses (p\n = 0.021) with the representation of the minor allele genotype for this ADAR polymorphism [14], which further suggests the involvement of this gene/genetic variant in immune response variations after vaccination. In addition, other regulatory and intronic SNPs within the same gene were associated at the genotype and haplotype level with variations in measles-specific cellular immunity, particularly in the Caucasian group (haplotype global p-value = 0.017, Table 4), implying cooperative effects of multiple SNPs in the genetic regulation of the immune outcome. This is in concert with the identification of ADAR as a critical determinant of local and systemic inflammatory responses through RNA editing and modulation of protein production [56]. It is important, however, to note that we did not find similarities between the genes/genetic variants associated with measles-specific IFN-\u03b3 Elispot responses and IFN-\u03b3 cytokine secretion in our analyses in Caucasians, and while the genetic associations with secreted IFN-\u03b3 remained significant after adjusting for FDR, none of the SNPs associated with IFN-\u03b3 Elispot responses remained significant after adjustment. Both our IFN-\u03b3 assays quantify IFN-\u03b3 responses, but as reported previously these assays do not correlate well with each other [57]. IFN-\u03b3 Elispot measures the number of cytokine-producing cells, while the IFN-\u03b3 ELISA measures the cytokine protein concentration released in the culture supernatant by virus-stimulated cells. We speculate that the lack of correlation (or weak correlation) between the two assays [57] is likely the main reason for the different genetic associations found in our analyses for these two immune outcomes.",

            "text": "The identified genes influencing vaccine-induced measles immunity are all interconnected components of the innate antiviral responses targeting viral nucleic acids. Viral nucleic acids stimulate the OAS-RNase L pathway resulting in RNA degradation. Viral RNA is also targeted by ADAR, which deaminates viral replication intermediates. In addition, viral RNA activates RNA helicase-like receptors, including RIG-I, to initiate signaling and transcription of IFNs (through IRFs), which feed back through their receptors to increase the expression of antiviral proteins, thus augmenting the antiviral response [10], [58]. Hence, our findings imply that key genetic variants/genes involved in the initial antiviral response to viral nucleic acids are modulating immune responses after vaccination with a live viral vaccine, likely due to alterations in viral sensing and/or direct antiviral activity that restricts viral replication and antigen load/antigenic stimulation. Although some of the genes such as DDX58, ADAR and OAS1 (and even genetic variants: OAS1 rs10774671) were found to be associated with variations in both rubella vaccine [14], [15], [16] and measles vaccine-induced immune responses in our studies, most of the identified genetic variants and association patterns appear to be virus-specific, possibly due to differences between viruses with respect to their ability to induce and/or counter some of the involved proteins and antiviral pathways [11], [12], [13], [58].",

It is plausible that different genetic polymorphisms would be important in other populations, such as African children, and our findings from a cohort of older children in Minnesota (an area with high vaccination coverage) may not apply to other areas of the world (with low vaccination coverage) where mainly younger children of different race/ethnicity contract the disease.",
