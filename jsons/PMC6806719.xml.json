Viral infections can cause a number of hematological abnormalities that commonly include abnormalities in blood cell counts, including anemia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia. It is thought that autoimmune responses and suppression of bone marrow progenitor cells are the causative factors of such abnormalities 1, 10. Although several mechanisms have been proposed to explain the effects of viruses on PLT count, the factors that determine whether thrombocytopenia develops in response to a viral infection are not well understood.",
