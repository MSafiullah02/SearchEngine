Traditionally, risk stratification and outcome prediction of sepsis patients have been based on disease severity scales, but lately emphasis has been placed also on genetic markers. These are hoped to deliver not only mechanistic understanding of pathogenesis, but also useful information regarding identification of particularly susceptible individuals.",

In addition, it promotes endothelial cell survival and barrier integrity. Collectively, these properties of APC constitute important countermechanisms against the septic process [8, 9]. Conversion of protein C to APC requires the presence of endothelial protein C receptor (EPCR) [10].",

Prior to enrollment, we screened all consecutive admissions to two ICUs in the Athens area, Greece over a 12-month period for eligibility. The catchment areas of the two hospitals are the same, and there were essentially no differences in demographic characteristics and diagnostic categories of patients admitted to the two ICUs. Exclusion criteria were as follows: age <18 years, malignancies, no need for intubation and mechanical ventilation during the ICU stay, contagious diseases (human immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis), and oral intake of corticosteroids at an equivalent dosage of \u22651 mg/kg prednisone/day for a period of more than 1 month. Out of 576 subjects screened, 389 subjects (as it happened all Caucasians; 262 males and 127 females) were enrolled in the study based on the above-mentioned criteria and consent to participate. The patients recruited into the study suffered from medical, surgical, and trauma-related pathologies. Medical conditions included infections and nonsurgical conditions of the respiratory, gastrointestinal, urinary, and hematopoietic systems, while surgical conditions included thoracic surgery (excluding cardiothoracic procedures), neurosurgery, and abdominal surgery; trauma was considered a separate category. Clinical data and blood samples were obtained from all patients enrolled. Following study enrollment, baseline (upon ICU admission) anthropometric data (height, weight) and detailed organ system-oriented medical history were recorded. A venous blood sample was drawn and processed as described in \u201cBlood collection.\u201d The patients were followed daily, and several clinical and laboratory parameters were recorded, including body temperature, arterial blood pressure, arterial blood gases, urine output, complete blood cell count and differential, serum chemistries, presence and source of infection, administration of vasopressors, mechanical ventilation, and renal replacement therapy. Patients were followed until discharge from hospital or death. The diagnoses of severe sepsis and septic shock were based on the criteria set by the American College of Chest Physicians/Society of Critical Care Medicine (ACCP/SCCM) consensus conference [28], while diagnosis of acute lung injury/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ALI/ARDS) relied on the criteria set by the American\u2013European consensus conference (AECC) on ARDS [29].

Fluorescence endpoint reading for allelic discrimination was performed on a PTC-200 (MJ Research Inc., Waltham, MA, USA) using Opticon Monitor 2 software. We chose three htSNPs to cover the three common haplotypes (H1, H2, and H3) in the EPCR gene (Fig. 1). The frequency of the H4 haplotype is only 0.05, thus we assumed that patients not carrying minor alleles belonging to the H1 or H3 haplotype most likely belong to the H2 haplotype. Specifically, C1651G (rs2069940) and A6936G (rs867186) were used to define haplotype H3, while C6333T (rs2069952) corresponded to haplotype H1. The presence of the minor allele determines the respective haplotype, while absence of all three minor alleles determines H2 [21].\n",

We reasoned that EPCR mutations could be implicated in severe sepsis or septic shock development by modulating the levels of APC and its downstream cytoprotective and anticoagulant properties. Increased levels of APC, as can be expected with H1 haplotypes, could be protective against severe sepsis, as suggested by previous studies on diverse vascular diseases [24\u201326]. As opposed to H1, H3 has been shown to be a candidate risk factor for deep vein thrombosis, possibly by increasing the levels of soluble EPCR and promoting the procoagulant effects due to APC sequestration [20, 27, 31]. A soluble form of EPCR sequesters APC and may act in a prothrombotic fashion [32]. Medina and coworkers [24] have further shown that these two haplotypes have an additive protective effect in myocardial infarction, probably due to the association of H1 with increased APC plasma levels and H3 due to its association with high sEPCR levels, but the mechanism remains unknown. Another related study has shown that the rare 23-bp insertion was significantly more common among patients with severe sepsis [33], probably due to the fact that the truncated protein product of this mutation is not localized on the cell surface and does not bind APC [19]. Animal data in sepsis have highlighted a role of EPCR in the control of thrombosis and inflammation and in the host response to Gram-negative infection. Inhibition of protein C binding to EPCR exacerbates the baboon response to sublethal Escherichia coli, converting it into a lethal syndrome of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) and exuberant inflammation [17]. In animals challenged with lethal levels of E. coli, infusion of APC was able to block microvascular thrombosis and leukocyte activation [34], indicating crosstalk between both pathways via APC and other mediators. In humans, however, the originally demonstrated efficacy of recombinant human activated protein C (drotrecogin alfa activated) for treatment of severe sepsis and septic shock [35] was not recently confirmed [36]; this led to drug withdrawal and modification of the latest Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines [5, 37].",

In this regard, the H1 haplotype consists of a combination of T at nt 3787, A at nt 3877, C at nt 4216, C at nt 4868, A at nt 5233, C at nt 5760, C at nt 6333, C at nt 7014, G at nt 7968, and A at nt 7999, while H3 differs from the H2 haplotype at four nucleotide positions (G at nt 1651, C at nt 3610, A at nt 4216, and G at nt 6936). Therefore, any of these nucleotides may be responsible for the low rates of severe sepsis or septic shock in carriers of alleles belonging to both H1 and H3 haplotypes. The molecular mechanism by which the presence of both H1 and H3 haplotypes decreases the risk of developing severe sepsis or septic shock, however, remains to be identified. Several polymorphisms defining the H1 and H3 haplotypes are located within intronic regions. The SNP affecting nt 1651 is located in the 5\u2032-UTR and the nt 6333 in an intron. Polymorphisms in promoter regions, intronic enhancer regions, or 3\u2032-UTR that augment transcription efficiency and protein synthesis have been described in other genes [38]. Alterations in DNA sequence may affect RNA stability, protein function, or other cellular mechanisms. Hence, developing high-throughput approaches for analysis of alternative mechanisms by which SNPs can cause disease remains one of the challenges for genomic research.",

A limitation of our study is that the power calculated in advance, although sufficient to evaluate an overall association (Table 3), was not adequate to document possible effects of alleles belonging only to H1 or only to H3. Therefore, pending future investigations, we cannot confidently exclude the possibility of a false-positive result concerning the effect of the simultaneous presence of alleles belonging to both the H1 and H3 haplotypes, but this also applies to all but the largest genetic association studies. Moreover, residual statistical concerns would be best addressed through the generation of functional data. Strengths of our study are the employment of state-of-the-art technology for genotyping and the fact that the diagnosis of severe sepsis and septic shock in both participating hospitals was based on criteria set in international guidelines.",

In this context, our study provides new evidence that EPCR polymorphisms may be implicated in determining sepsis severity; that is, in our cohort of critically ill patients, those who carried alleles belonging to both H1 and H3 haplotypes in the EPCR gene had reduced risk of developing SS/SS. These findings generate hope that successful use of modern molecular diagnostics could enable rapid identification of particularly susceptible or less susceptible individuals, leading to tailored therapeutic approaches.",
