The symptoms associated with CoV infection were first described over four decades ago [1], and can range from relatively mild upper- to more severe lower- respiratory tract infections with increased severity in certain patient populations [1,2]. It has been reported that immunocompromised patients, particularly hematopoietic cell transplant recipients, are at increased risk of lower respiratory tract infections, prolonged viral shedding and mortality, often comparable to what is seen with influenza virus [3,4]. Similar to other non-influenza respiratory viruses, CoVs are still relatively understudied despite being a common cause of hospital- and community-acquired respiratory infection [5,6].",

Recent findings demonstrate a seasonality for CoV infections, with peak numbers being observed in the winter months [2]. However, this data is based on nationally-reported findings from the United States, and may not reflect local or national epidemiology in Canada. Moreover, the receptor-binding domain of the glycoprotein of 229E has undergone adaptation over the last 50 years [8], suggesting that ongoing viral evolution may influence which strains predominate from year to year. This is further supported by phylogenetic data examining OC43 isolates, which showed that the circulating genotypes in southeast Asia changed over time [9]. A recent study in the midwestern USA reported frequent identification of HKU1, whereas a separate study from China reported OC43 to be more prevalent [10,11]. Therefore, determining the regional prevalence is important to understand the burden of these infections.",

Most hospitals do not routinely test for CoV resulting in gaps in our clinical and epidemiologic understanding of this virus. The predictors of severe infection are well known for CoV associated with acute respiratory syndromes (eg. Middle East Respiratory Syndrome CoV, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome CoV), yet few studies have identified these predictors for the more common four circulating CoV strains such as OC43, 229E, HKU1 and NL63 [12,13]. The primary objective of this study was to describe the burden of CoV among patients admitted to an acute care hospital in Toronto, Canada over a six-year period, and identify the predictors of severe disease.",

The Chi-squared/Fisher's exact test, Kruskal Wallis, Mann-Whitney and unpaired T-tests were used to assess the presence of statistically significant correlations between dependent and independent variables. Statistically significant correlations were included in univariable logistic or non-parametric regression analyses to evaluate the predictive ability of the independent variable. A bivariate and a multivariate logistic regression analysis were also performed including the following variables: age, smoking status (current or previous smoker vs. non-smoker), viral strain (OC43 vs. non-OC43), nosocomial vs. community acquired infection, gender, and number of comorbidities (3 or more vs. less than 3).

Patients with OC43 had 2-fold odds of requiring O2 or intubation compared to non-OC43 strains, while no difference in mortality or ICU admission was found based on CoV strain. Increased age was associated with increased numbers of symptoms, comorbidities, and radiographic changes. A bivariate analysis identified both nosocomial acquisition (OR 2.25; CI 1.089\u20134.655; p-value 0.02) and female gender (OR 0.485; CI 0.248\u22120.948, p-value 0.03) as being associated with ICU admission and/or mortality. The multivariate model passed the test for co-linearity, and indicated that female gender was significantly associated with ICU admission and/or mortality (OR 0.45; 95 % CI, 0.23\u22120.90; p = 0.02) as was smoking status (OR 0.30; 95 % CI, 0.084\u20131.06; p = 0.06, while strain type, co-morbidities, age and nosocomial-acquisition were not associated with ICU admission or mortality.",

With other coronaviruses including MERS-CoV, there is often a predominance of male cases [19,20]. However, females represented the majority of CoV infections in our cohort, and our analysis indicated that female gender was associated with more severe outcome. This finding differs from what has been reported for SARS-CoV patients in Singapore [21], and MERS-CoV 17] where male gender was predictive of poor outcomes. Interestingly, our bivariate analysis indicated that nosocomial acquisition was associated with poor prognosis.

Previous studies have similarly shown OC43 and 229E account for up to approximately 30 % of common colds [22], and our data indicate that approximately 70 % of coronavirus infections in our cohort were due to these two strains. More recent four-year prevalence data from military personnel in the USA revealed season-to-season variability where OC43 and 229E alternated as the most common strain identified [23]. Other studies have highlighted prevalence of a particular strain, often showing variation between locations and patient populations (eg. transplant vs. non-transplant; inpatient vs. ICU etc) [3,10,11,23]. Sequencing analysis by Lau and colleagues of clinical isolates of OC43 suggested recombination may play a role in the generation of novel CoV genotypes [24]. This highlights the importance of determining the local epidemiology, and suggests that genomic sequencing of isolates may be a necessary next step to investigate genetic changes over time. Interestingly, there is increasing reports of both co-infections with multiple respiratory viruses and viral and bacterial pathogens, and data suggesting this may be associated with more severe disease [[25], [26], [27], [28]]. In our cohort bacterial co-infections were only identified in 7.9 % of individuals, and viral co-infections in 3.1 %; both of which are lower than what has been reported by other groups [28,29], and we did not have sufficient numbers to investigate any correlations with disease severity. However, this is an area where additional studies are needed.",

We only included patients who presented to the hospital for acute care, thus representing a subset of the most ill patients with CoV infection in the community. Furthermore, it cannot be discounted that higher number of positives were seen during influenza season due to heightened testing of respiratory viruses during this time of year. Importantly, our study did not include asymptomatic or subclinical cases or non-CoV controls, which makes it challenging to identify determinants of severity relative to these other populations. Moreover, as data emerges on the association of CoVs with central nervous system sequalae, future studies should investigate the incidence of strokes, and seizures in cases of CoV infection [30]. The number of patients receiving extracorporeal membrane oxygenation should also be considered in subsequent studies. Since our assay was not quantitative we are unable to determine the role of viral load in influencing disease severity, although it has been noted by others that viral load did not correlate with outcome [31]. Furthermore, we did not include biomarkers associated with liver function. It has been reported that elevated ALT was associated with adverse outcomes in patients infected with SARS [32], and further investigation is necessary to determine the prognostic value in other CoV infections. Finally, the relatively small numbers of cases of each strain (e.g. OC43, 229E, HKU1, NL63) prevented separate analysis of any potential effects of individual strains on patient outcome.",
