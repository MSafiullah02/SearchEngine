Briefly, cells were grown in 500 ml Luria Broth (LB) containing ampicillin agitating at 37 \u00b0C until the OD600 (optical density) reached 0.4. Isopropyl-\u03b2-d-thiogalactoside (IPTG) was then added to a final concentration of 0.2 mM. Three hours later the induced cells were pelleted, resuspended in 30 ml Lysis Buffer (1% Triton X-100, PBS, pH 7.3), and shaken at 4 \u00b0C for 30 min. After sonication, the suspension was centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 15 min. The supernatant was collected and bonded with glutathione\u2013Sepharose 4B at 4 \u00b0C for 30 min with shaking. The mixture was then loaded into a column, washed by 10 column volumes of PBS (pH 7.3), and cleaved by 80 U thrombin at 22 \u00b0C for 3 h. The peptides were eluted with 4 ml PBS, which were collected and further purified by RP FPLC. Fractions containing the peptides were vacuum dried overnight and dissolved in PBS. At last, these products were detected by SDS\u2013PAGE in a 15% Tris/Glycine gel and the concentrations were determined through bicinchoninic acid protein analysis (Micro BCA assay kit; Pierce).",

After further 48 h incubation, the supernatant containing the pseudotyped virus was collected and filtered through a 0.45 \u03bcm Millipore-sized membrane. For the inhibition assay, 0.5 ng of HIV-luc/SARS pseudotyped virus was incubated with serially diluted peptides at 37 \u00b0C for 30 min. The virus/peptide mixture was then transferred to 96-well plates seeded with Vero E6 cells (3 \u00d7 103\n cells/well). Each concentration was tested in octuple. After overnight incubation, the medium was replaced and the sample was incubated for an additional 36 h.

            "text": "In this study, we found that none of the 20 different peptides corresponding to HR2 region had a higher inhibition activity than HR1-1. This result is in contrast to most other enveloped viruses, such as HIV-1 and MHV, whose peptides in the HR2 region outperform those in HR1 in inhibiting virus fusion [30], [31]. In the enveloped virus fusion model, the HR1 region forms an inner, trimeric, coiled-coil core surrounded by three helical HR2 regions outside [9], [10], [11], [12], [17]. In this way, HR1 interacts not only with HR2, but also with other HR1 molecules. It has been proposed that HR1 are poor inhibitors for some viruses because they can form self-associated oligomers and aggregate in isolation, therefore interfering with their ability to efficiently block the formation of a six-helix bundle [17], [31]. In the case of SARS-CoV, the more potent inhibition activity of HR1-1 may correlate with its atypical-helix structure (as the CD spectra show in Fig. 4). This conformation, with its low coiled-coil tendency, might inhibit the self-associated oligomerization, and thus increase the inhibition potency of HR1-1. Our analysis of the HR1-1 structure was consistent with the recent report by Liu et al. [32]. It has been reported that the major localization of helical content in HR1 is downstream of HR1-1 [33], such as HR-N13 (residues 927\u2013973) with typical \u03b1-helix structure. However, we found HR1-3 similar to HR-N13 did not show any viral entry inhibition activity. Similarly, in the case of MHV, it has been demonstrated that the HR1 region with a typical \u03b1-helix structure showed low inhibitory activity [16]. These evidences support our proposition above. It has been reported that HR2 peptide of HIV could induce the formation of the coiled-coil HR1 core [34]. Therefore, this suggests, in the presence of the endogenous HR2 region, that the HR1-1 may undergo conformational changes from an atypical-helix structure to a typical-helix structure and bind to the HR2 region to block fusion in the intermediate state.",

In the recent report, a peptide corresponding to HR2 had a stronger \u03b1-helical spectrum than HR2-18, but this also showed low inhibitory activity [32]. Therefore, potent inhibitors for the entry of SARS-CoV are still under identification. In addition, during screening the peptides we found slight differences between each peptide could affect their inhibitory activities. For example the peptide HR2-17, with just three amino acids more than HR2-18, showed no inhibition activity. Moreover, our peptide HR2-11 did not show any activity to inhibit virus entry, but with the addition of only two amino acids in the C-terminal, peptide CP-1 was identified to have inhibition activity by Liu et al. [32]. It is possible that the addition or deletion of several amino acids may change the conformational structure of the peptides and consequently influence their inhibitory effects. Based on this, we will further refine the mapping of the peptides to detect the changes in their conformation and inhibitory activity in order to identify possible correlations.",
