Although the incidence of HAV infection has fallen dramatically since the introduction of vaccines, it still causes approximately 60,000 infections per year and occasionally causes dramatic outbreaks with fulminant hepatitis and death.1 Fecal-oral transmission is facilitated by extensive viral shedding in feces during the 3- to 6-week incubation period, which reaches a maximum just before the onset of hepatocellular injury.1 An increasing incidence has been noted among urban homosexual men. An effective vaccine has been developed.",

These patients have high levels of HBV replication but little to no liver inflammation and normal serum aminotransferase levels. Serum HBeAg is detectable, and HBV DNA is markedly elevated.10., 11., 15. As the host immune system matures, the patient enters the immune clearance phase, which is characterized by immune mediated liver injury.

Serum aminotransferases increase, and liver histology shows active chronic hepatitis with evolving fibrosis.10 Although most patients remain asymptomatic, some present with flares that mimic acute hepatitis, and this may precede the development of antibodies to HBeAg and remission of hepatitis activity.10 Spontaneous seroconversion to HBeAb-positive status occurs in up to 90% of white adults with chronic hepatitis B within 10 years of follow-up, and it is more likely in those with high transaminase levels, which indicate a vigorous immune response to HBV.10\n,\n15\n",

Varying degrees of lobular necroinflammatory activity are present, but typically not to the extent seen in acute viral hepatitis. Hepatocyte anisonucleosis may be conspicuous. A characteristic feature of chronic HBV is the presence of ground glass hepatocytes (Fig. 10-4\n), which contain HBsAg. These hepatocytes show a finely granular cytoplasmic inclusion that displaces the nucleus and is surrounded by a pale halo. Ground glass hepatocytes can be demonstrated by various histochemical stains such as Victoria blue, orcein, or aldehyde fuchsin17 and by immunohistochemical stains for HBsAg. In some cases, the hepatocyte nuclei have a \u201csanded\u201d appearance due to the accumulation of HBcAg, although these are difficult to recognize and also are seen in delta hepatitis.17\n",

This pattern is characterized by canalicular and cellular cholestasis, ballooning of hepatocytes, and scattered acidophil bodies with relatively scant parenchymal inflammation. Portal tracts are mildly to moderately inflamed and show periportal fibrosis, with immature fibrous tissue extending as thin perisinusoidal strands into the acinus. At the interface, a proliferation of ductal-type cells lends a hypercellularity to the portal areas. Immunohistochemical stains show extensive cytoplasmic and membranous expression with HBsAg and extensive nuclear and cytoplasmic HBcAg.21., 23., 24. The combination of high HBV antigen expression, marked hepatocyte injury, and relatively little inflammation suggests that the virus itself may be cytopathic in this setting.21., 22., 24. Fibrosing cholestatic hepatitis is associated with a high rate of viral replication, with high serum HBV DNA, high serum HBsAg titers, and rapid deterioration.22., 23., 24. It has also been described in HBV infection in other settings involving immunosuppression, including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection25 and bone marrow transplantation.26\n",

However, the reduced immune reaction is potentially responsible for the relatively reduced inflammation in these patients despite their higher HBV viral replication rates.28 Even though there is reduced inflammation, HBV infection is more progressive in HIV-positive patients, including development of cirrhosis and its complications.28 A pattern of hepatitis similar to fibrosing cholestatic hepatitis has been described in HIV patients with concurrent HBV infection.25 The HBV-related mortality in HIV patients has increased since the introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), possibly because of increased immunologic injury to the liver with immune reconstitution, toxicity of the antiviral drugs, or longer life spans in HIV patients.28 Conversely, the use of antiretroviral agents that also have activity against HBV may slow the progression of chronic HBV and even result in seroconversion, whereas their discontinuation can cause significant liver disease due to re-emergence of HBV replication.27\n",

In one study,80 parvovirus B19 DNA was found in liver tissue in four of six patients with fulminant hepatic failure associated with aplastic anemia and in two of four patients with cryptogenic acute liver failure (without aplastic anemia), but not in six patients with known causes of acute liver failure. Histology studies in DNA-positive cases showed massive hepatic necrosis and collapse without inflammatory infiltrates or viral inclusions. In contrast, other investigators found no parvovirus B19 DNA by PCR in 33 cases of cryptogenic acute liver failure but detected parvovirus B19 DNA in several patients with known causes of acute liver failure.82 In that study, several patients had low-titer IgM positivity without confirmatory PCR positivity. In another study, parvovirus B19 DNA was found with similar frequency in patients with fulminant hepatitis and with hepatitis B or C. Furthermore, RNA transcripts could not be detected in any of the liver tissue samples, arguing against active viral replication.83 These studies suggest that low levels of PCR positivity may reflect remote infection, and they raise questions about the role of parvovirus B19 in hepatitis and acute liver failure.",

Dengue shock is caused by severe plasma leakage and manifests as cyanosis, hypotension, and encephalopathy.107 There are four serotypes of dengue virus, and infection with one serotype confers future protective immunity against that serotype only.

Hepatic granulomas have been described in patients after intradermal injections of BCG.127\n,\n128 Pneumonitis or granulomatous hepatitis, or both, affect 0.7% of patients who receive multiple intravesical instillations of BCG and are more likely after traumatic catheterization, extensive tumor resection, or bladder perforation.129 The liver shows noncaseating epithelioid granulomas, mild steatosis, and hepatocyte necrosis. Often, acid-fast bacilli are not identified, and cultures are negative. This has led to the suggestion that the granulomatous hepatitis represents a hypersensitivity reaction to antigens present in the BCG preparation,127 particularly because some cases show additional features of extrahepatic granulomas, leukocytoclastic vasculitis, or bile duct injury and eosinophils (Fig. 10-18\n).130\n,\n131 However, in some reported cases, acid-fast bacilli have been identified in the granulomas, blood cultures have been positive for M. bovis, or PCR for mycobacterial DNA has been positive, indicating disseminated BCG infection.131., 132., 133. Some have suggested that two types of adverse reactions may occur, one a disseminated infection that responds to anti-TB therapy and the other a sterile hypersensitivity reaction that is delayed in appearance and responds to steroids.131\n",

            "text": "Culture of aspirated purulent material from the abscess or of blood may yield the offending organisms, although both of these are occasionally negative. Sometimes blood culture results do not correlate with pus culture results; therefore, blood culture alone is not sufficient to determine the etiology.138 Depending on the organism, serology may be useful. The most commonly isolated organisms are Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterococcus, Streptococcus, and Pseudomonas species.138., 139., 142. A third of infections are polymicrobial (Fig. 10-19\n). Organisms that produce formic hydrogenlyase, such as Klebsiella spp. and E. coli, can convert acids that accumulate within the abscess to carbon dioxide and hydrogen gas; infection with these organisms can result in gas-forming pyogenic abscess, which carries a higher risk of septic shock, bacteremia, and mortality.143 Abscesses secondary to Yersinia enterocolitica or Yersinia pseudotuberculosis are often associated with underlying hemochromatosis.144., 145., 146., 147. Anaerobes are isolated in up to 25% of cases, sometimes together with aerobes.139., 148., 149. Microaerophilic streptococci, Bacteroides fragilis, Fusobacterium necrophorum, and Clostridium spp. are the most commonly implicated anaerobes. Actinomyces spp. are infrequently found by either anaerobic culture of aspirated pus or identification of filamentous bacteria and sulfur granules on histologic examination of resection material (Fig. 10-20\n); these organisms may be associated with the formation of sinus tracts.150., 151., 152., 153. Rarely, Francisella tularensis,154\nBurkholderia pseudomallei (the agent of melioidosis),155\n,\n156 or Listeria monocytogenes\n157 causes liver abscesses. Fungi, such as Candida and Aspergillus, are found in about 15% of cases.148\n,\n158\n",

Bacterial colonization of the biliary tree in the absence of obstruction produces no symptoms; conversely, sterile obstruction of the bile duct produces a picture of aseptic obstructive jaundice.161 The route by which bacteria colonize the bile ducts is uncertain. Possible sources include reflux of intestinal contents through the choledochal sphincter; passage from an infected gallbladder; and lymphatic, hepatic arterial, or portal venous bacteremia.161 Obstruction is most often due to gallstones. Other causes include strictures, malignancy, and congenital anomalies of the ampulla of Vater. How bactibilia and obstruction leads to biliary septicemia is uncertain. Cholangiovenous reflux with increased intrabiliary pressure can be demonstrated using contrast, and higher biliary pressures are associated with an increased incidence of purulent bile, sepsis, and bacteremia.161\n",

The trademark palmar rash of syphilis may be the key to diagnosis.204\n,\n205 Histologic examination of liver may show a variety of pathologic patterns. In most cases, portal inflammation with mononuclear cells or neutrophils surrounding damaged bile ducts (pericholangitis) is the main finding.200., 201., 206., 207. Scattered foci of necrosis may be present in the lobules, sometimes accompanied by inflammation around the central veins and Glisson's capsule.201., 203., 207., 208.

Hepatic infection in the absence of pulmonary disease may be caused by spread from a gastrointestinal source.250 These fungi have broad (10 to 20 \u00b5m), aseptate or hyposeptate, ribbon-like hyphae with right-angle branching, and they have a propensity to invade blood vessels, leading to extensive necrosis, infarctions, and dissemination.250., 251., 252., 253. Diagnosis requires identification of the fungus in tissue or culture. However, tissue culture sensitivity is poor, possibly because the grinding of tissue in preparation for plating destroys the delicate hyphae, and this technique is no longer recommended.250 Blood cultures are always negative. In tissue identification, erroneous classification as Aspergillus may occur if the hyphae are hyposeptate.250\n",

In patients with AIDS, the organism has been known to infect the biliary tree, producing a syndrome similar to primary sclerosing cholangitis.96 Signs and symptoms include right upper quadrant abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, fever, and biochemical evidence of anicteric cholestasis.96 Dilatation of the common bile duct is often seen on ultrasonography or computed tomography scanning, and cholangiography reveals attenuation and pruning of duct branches, stricturing and beading of the proximal intrahepatic bile ducts, and dilatation or stricturing of the extrahepatic duct.96 The histologic picture reflects the intense periductal inflammatory response elicited by the organism, with portal edema, inflammation, and hyperplastic periductal glands. The biliary epithelium may be reactive or frankly necrotic. Organisms can be detected on the luminal surface of the epithelial lining of small biliary radicles, peribiliary glands, the pancreatic duct, and the gallbladder.96 Concomitant CMV infection may be found.",
