These methods have, however, many limitations. They require the experimental animals to be sacrificed in order to identify the sites of infection and to quantify the replication of the pathogens. They hence require large numbers of animals and are costly. They do not allow the real\u2010time monitoring of spatial and temporal progression of infection in the same animal. Important variations in host\u2013pathogen interactions might therefore be overlooked, while dissemination of a pathogen to unexpected anatomical locations might be missed, simply because the infected tissue is not harvested and analysed (Hutchens and Luker, 2007; Luker and Luker, 2008a). As of recently many of these limitations of the conventional techniques can be overcome by powerful new methods that involve non\u2010invasive imaging of pathogen replication and spread in infected live animals.",

            "text": "As a member of the Coronavirus (CoV) family, the mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) provides a practical model system for studying CoV\u2010induced pathogenesis in mice. Depending on the inoculation route, the virus strain and the genetic background of the host, MHV infection can result in a variety of pathological disorders (Compton et al., 1993). The most commonly used laboratory strains primarily infect the liver and the brain, thereby providing animal models for studying encephalitis and hepatitis as well as for immune\u2010mediated demyelinating disease that sometimes develop during a later stage of infection (Perlman, 1998). Inoculation of susceptible mice, either intracranially or intranasally, with neurotropic MHV strains can result in a number of different outcomes, ranging from acute encephalomyelitis to chronic demyelinating disease (Houtman and Fleming, 1996). Besides a mild encephalitis, MHV strain A59 also causes enteric disease and moderate hepatitis (Lavi et al., 1986). The differences in pathogenesis between various MHV strains have been linked mainly to the spike protein which mediates virus\u2013cell attachment and subsequent membrane fusion (Phillips et al., 1999). However, other viral genes have been shown to also significantly contribute to pathogenesis (de Haan et al., 2002; Sperry et al., 2005; Iacono et al., 2006).",

Both humoral and cellular immune reactions are essential to guard against MHV infections (Bergmann et al., 2001; Marten et al., 2001; Morales et al., 2001). Clearance of virus during acute infection is predominantly regulated by a typical expression pattern of proinflammatory chemokines that attract CD8+ and CD4+ T lymphocytes to sites of infection (Glass et al., 2002; Lane et al., 2006; Stiles et al., 2006). Also interferon (IFN)\u2010 and perforin\u2010mediated mechanisms are involved in the clearance of MHV from different cell types (Weiss and Navas\u2010Martin, 2005). The kinetics and the extent of the host immune response, which aims to limit the production of infectious virus and viral spread without inducing extensive deleterious effects, is important in determining survival of the host. Infectious virus is usually cleared from MHV\u2010infected mice within 2 weeks. Most animals, however, do not appear to obtain complete sterile immunity, since viral RNA is often found to persist within the central nervous system (CNS).",

            "text": "Recent biotechnological advances now allow the real\u2010time imaging of pathogen replication and spread in living animals by making use of bioluminescence imaging (BLI). To this end, light emitted by luciferase reporter proteins is detected by a cooled charge\u2010coupled device (CCD) camera (Contag et al., 1997; Wu et al., 2001). Important advantages of BLI are an intrinsically low background combined with a very high sensitivity for monitoring light emission in vivo (Contag and Bachmann, 2002; Hutchens and Luker, 2007). Furthermore, the substrate for firefly luciferase (FL), d\u2010luciferin, is able to cross cellular membranes as well as the intact blood\u2013brain barrier, thereby allowing the imaging of any anatomic location. In addition, d\u2010luciferin is non\u2010toxic, allowing the monitoring of individual mice over time through consecutive imaging. Thus, fewer animals are typically needed to acquire statistically meaningful data at multiple time points as compared with conventional approaches (Hutchens and Luker, 2007). Initially, BLI was used to identify sites of bacterial replication in intact animals (Contag et al., 1995). Nowadays, this technique is widely used to study the formation and spread of cancer metastases and to visualize the effect of chemotherapy (Shah et al., 2004). BLI has also been used to study the dissemination of herpes simplex virus, Sindbis virus, Vaccinia virus, and Infectious hematopoietic necrosis virus (Rodriguez et al., 1988; Luker et al., 2002; Cook and Griffin, 2003; Harmache et al., 2006).",

Although these conventional approaches have defined important factors that dictate replication and virulence of MHV in vivo as described above, non\u2010invasive whole\u2010body imaging of MHV infection in living mice is likely to offer new insights into virus replication, dissemination and pathogenesis. Here, we have taken advantage of BLI to study the replication and spread of FL\u2010expressing MHV (de Haan et al., 2003; 2005a) in mice in real\u2010time. We were also able to demonstrate differences in virus replication and spread, resulting either from differences in virus doses, mutations in the spike gene, differences in host susceptibility or from the administration of antiviral compounds. In addition, we identified new anatomic sites of virus replication. Our results provide new insights in CoV pathogenesis and demonstrate the potential of BLI to study CoV\u2013host interactions in vivo.",

            "text": "In our previous studies we extensively characterized various recombinant MHVs expressing luciferase reporter genes. The insertion of an FL expression cassette at different positions in the viral RNA genome was shown not to appreciably affect virus multiplication in vitro, while the FL expression levels were demonstrated to be a reliable measure for virus replication (de Haan et al., 2003; Verheije et al., 2008). To verify the feasibility of detecting MHV infection in vivo with BLI, we compared two recombinant MHVs containing the luciferase gene at different positions in the viral genome with a recombinant wild\u2010type MHV\u2010A59 with respect to virus replication. Therefore, we prepared new stocks of MHV\u2010EFLM (containing the FL gene as an additional expression cassette between the E and M gene), MHV\u20102aFLS (containing the FL expression cassette at the position of the haemagglutinin esterase pseudo\u2010gene) and wild\u2010type MHV\u2010A59 (Fig. 1A). In agreement with the previous studies we observed that the growth characteristics of the luciferase\u2010expressing viruses in tissue culture were highly similar to that of the parental MHV\u2010A59 (Fig. 1B), with the FL reporter gene being expressed at high levels for both MHV\u2010EFLM and MHV\u20102aFLS. For the characterization of the FL\u2010expressing viruses in vivo we used BALB/c mice, which have been shown to be susceptible to MHV infection (Ohtsuka and Taguchi, 1997). As the inoculation route largely determines the dissemination of virus infection in an animal, we made use of both intranasal and intraperitoneal injection. The 6\u2010 to 8\u2010week\u2010old mice were inoculated with 106 tissue culture 50% infectious dose (TCID50) of virus or with phosphate\u2010buffered saline (PBS) (control) and sacrificed at 5 days post inoculation, at which day virus titres peak (MacNamara et al., 2005). As MHV\u2010A59 mainly targets the liver and brain (Lavi et al., 1984; Haring and Perlman, 2001), these organs were taken for analyses. Tissue homogenates were prepared and subsequently tested for virus titres, RNA levels and FL activity. In intranasally inoculated animals, we detected high virus titres in the brains of all infected mice, with no disparity between the wild\u2010type and FL\u2010expressing viruses (Fig. 2A). Infectious virus could not be recovered from the liver homogenates. Also the viral RNA levels in the brains of the animals, as determined by quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT\u2010PCR), were indistinguishable between groups. However, viral RNA in the liver could only be detected in wild\u2010type MHV\u2010infected mice (Fig. 2B). All mice infected with the FL\u2010expressing recombinants showed high FL activity in the brain, as well as some FL activity in the liver (Fig. 2C). Although not statistically significant, the FL expression levels of MHV\u20102aFLS were somewhat lower than those of MHV\u2010EFLM, which is consistent with the relative expression levels observed in vitro (de Haan et al., 2003). After intraperitoneal inoculation, infectious virus could only be recovered from the livers of wild\u2010type MHV\u2010A59\u2010infected animals (Fig. 2A). Although viral RNA was detected in the livers of all groups, the levels were approximately a 1000\u2010fold lower for the FL\u2010expressing MHV recombinants (Fig. 2B). Furthermore, only in some livers of MHV\u2010EFLM\u2010 and MHV\u20102aFLS\u2010infected mice could FL activity above background level be detected. Overall, these data show that the introduction of the FL expression cassette into the genome of MHV\u2010A59 affected virus multiplication in the liver but, importantly, not in the brain of 6\u2010 to 8\u2010week\u2010old BALB/c mice. High levels of FL activity were measured in the brains of MHV\u2010EFLM\u2010 and MHV\u20102aFLS\u2010infected mice at 5 days post infection, indicating that these viruses are attractive candidates to be used for BLI after intranasal inoculation.",

            "text": "Thus, we applied whole\u2010body BLI to study the replication and spread of the two FL\u2010expressing MHVs. To this end, BALB/c mice were inoculated intranasally with 106 TCID50 of virus after which virus replication was followed over time in individual mice. In general, very similar patterns of virus dissemination were observed for both viruses. At 2 days post inoculation, a strong signal was observed, apparently emanating from the nasal cavity, when the mice were imaged at their dorsal side (Fig. 3A). When imaged from the ventral side, replication additionally could be observed in two distinct spots, probably representing the cervical lymph nodes of the animal. At this time point, no signal coming from the brain could yet be detected. Three days later, dissemination of virus replication to the brain was apparent, while replication in the cervical lymph nodes was no longer observed. At 7 days post inoculation, the signal coming from the brain appeared more dispersed, while its intensity was clearly declining. At 9 days post inoculation, signal from the brain was scarcely detectable in most mice, while it could no longer be detected at day 12 (data not shown). With BLI, it is important to note that the measurable photon flux decreases with increasing depth of the target tissue (Luker and Luker, 2008b). Thus, the signal coming from the brain is significantly attenuated when compared with the signal from the olfactory epithelium, because photons emitted from brain cells must penetrate considerably more tissue to be detected (Fig. 3B). As a consequence, signal intensities should only be compared when photons emanate from the same tissue. Photon quantification of the head regions demonstrated that mice infected with MHV\u2010EFLM showed significantly higher signal intensities than mice infected with MHV\u20102aFLS at 2 days post inoculation (Fig. 3B). In conclusion, with BLI the temporal and spatial spread of MHV replication could be readily visualized in living mice. While mice infected with different luciferase\u2010expressing viruses displayed very similar patterns of virus dissemination, BLI allowed the quantitative detection of relatively small differences in FL\u2010expression levels between MHV\u2010EFLM and MHV\u20102aFLS, which is consistent with our earlier observations (de Haan et al., 2003).",

To this end, BALB/c mice were infected with two different doses of MHV\u2010EFLM, a high dose of 5 \u00d7 106 and a low dose of 2 \u00d7 103 TCID50, and progression of infection was subsequently monitored by BLI at different time points post inoculation (Fig. 4A). As expected, photon quantification of the head regions at 2 days post inoculation demonstrated a clear correlation between the virus inoculation dose and the total signal produced from the olfactory epithelium (Fig. 4B). In addition, spread of virus replication from the nasal cavity into the CNS was more rapidly observed for the mice inoculated with the higher dose. This effect was quantified by dividing the head region into two sections (i.e. anterior versus posterior) after which the relative amount of photons emitted from these sections was determined (Fig. 4C). With a high virus inoculation dose, approximately 50% of the total amount of photons was coming from the posterior part at day 5, while with the low virus dose this degree of dissemination was delayed until around day 7. Consistently, while mice that received the high dose showed virus replication in the cervical lymph nodes after 2 days, this was apparent in the mice inoculated with the low dose only after 5 days (Table S1A). Interestingly, mice infected with the higher dose appeared to clear the virus infection faster than animals infected with the low dose. MHV replication was easily detectable at day 9 in mice inoculated with the low dose, whereas the luciferase signal of the high dose\u2010inoculated group was almost undetectable at this time point. In some mice infected with a high virus dose, we could additionally visualize infection of the liver and lungs after 2 days, whereas at later time points (9 days), strong signals from the eyes were occasionally detectable. For a summary of the results see Table S1A. In conclusion, virus dissemination was shown to differ in mice infected with a low or a high dose. In mice that received the low dose virus replication was initially restricted to the nasal cavity, while much faster dissemination of virus infection was observed after inoculation with a high dose. Strikingly, and counter intuitively, this rapid dissemination appeared to come at a cost, as these mice were able to clear the infection faster than the mice that received the low dose.",

            "text": "We next analysed the essential contribution of the S protein to virus dissemination by using BLI. The S protein of MHV is a major determinant of pathogenesis and tropism (Phillips et al., 1999). It mediates virus\u2013cell attachment and fusion via binding of the MHV receptor CEACAM1a both in vitro and in vivo (Blau et al., 2001; Hemmila et al., 2004). Schickli et al. (1997) have described a limited set of mutations in the S protein of an MHV\u2010A59 variant that had been acquired after extensive passaging in cell culture. We have recently shown that these mutations enable the virus to use heparan sulfate as an additional attachment/entry factor. As a result, viruses carrying these mutations appeared to have acquired an extended host range as they were capable of entering cells also in a CEACAM1a\u2010independent manner (Schickli et al., 1997; de Haan et al., 2005b). The physiological consequences of this adaptation in vivo, however, remain to be elucidated. Here, we examined the infection of mice by an MHV with such an extended host range. Therefore, we made use of a previously described recombinant virus (de Haan et al., 2005b), which contains the mutant spike gene (Srec) and the FL reporter gene. Thus, this recombinant virus MHV\u20102aFLSrec only differs from its control virus MHV\u20102aFLS in its spike protein. Both viruses replicated to comparable titres in murine LR7 cells as demonstrated by the one\u2010step growth curve shown in Fig. 1B and displayed similar FL expression kinetics (Fig. 1C). Next, BALB/c mice were inoculated via the intranasal route with these viruses. Clearly, MHV\u20102aFLSrec replicated to a lower extent than the parental virus MHV\u20102aFLS at all time points measured (Fig. 5A and B). Although the luciferase signal exhibited by the virus with the extended host range increased until 5 days post infection, the infection did not progress towards the CNS as was observed for the control virus. Apparently, the acquisition of a heparan sulfate\u2010dependent tropism significantly attenuated the ability of the virus to replicate and spread in vivo.",

It has been observed that the susceptibility of inbred mouse strains to different virus infections can vary significantly (Parker et al., 1978; Jubelt et al., 1991; Thach et al., 2000). In order to comparatively evaluate the MHV infection process in mice, we infected three commonly used mouse strains with MHV\u2010EFLM. To this end, BALB/c, C57BL/6 and 129SvEv mice were inoculated in parallel each with 106 TCID50 via the intranasal route after which virus replication was monitored over time. Clearly, at 5 days post inoculation BALB/c mice displayed the highest signal in the brain, followed by C57BL/6 mice (Fig. 6A and B). Interestingly, 129SvEv mice were significantly less susceptible to MHV\u2010EFLM infection. In contrast to BALB/c and C57BL/6 mice, virus replication was no longer detectable from 7 days post inoculation in these animals (data not shown). To confirm these observations, we inoculated mice also with MHV\u2010A59 wild\u2010type virus and determined the viral RNA load in the brain by quantitative RT\u2010PCR at 5 days post inoculation. In agreement with the BLI results, BALB/c mice showed the highest viral RNA levels, while the brains from C57BL/6 and 129SvEv mice contained considerably less viral RNA (Fig. 6B).",

To this end, the effect of IFN alpha receptor knock\u2010out (IFNAR\u2013/\u2013) was studied using 129SvEv mice. Wild\u2010type and knock\u2010out mice were inoculated via the intranasal route with 106 TCID50 of MHV\u2010EFLM and the infection process was monitored as before. Already at 2 days post infection a significant difference between the IFNAR\u2013/\u2013 and wild\u2010type mice was apparent when the animals were examined from the ventral side (Fig. 7A). A much higher signal was emitted from the nasal cavity in the IFNAR\u2013/\u2013 mice compared with the wild\u2010type mice while, in addition, infection of the cervical lymph nodes was only detected in the knock\u2010out mice. At later time points, infection was rapidly cleared from the wild\u2010type mice, whereas dissemination to other organs, including liver and intestine, was manifest in the IFNAR\u2013/\u2013 mice. Virus dissemination was accompanied by severe clinical signs, which included a significant decrease in body weight (Fig. 7B). Mice had to be euthanized at 7 days post infection. Interestingly, virus replication in the tail and paws could again be detected in the IFNAR\u2013/\u2013 mice, similar to what we had observed after inoculation of BALB/c and C57BL/6 mice via the intraperitoneal route (Fig. 5C). Ex vivo imaging of the abdominal region of the IFNAR\u2013/\u2013 mice clearly identified the liver as the major site of MHV\u2010EFLM replication (Fig. 7C), the organ showing a focal pattern of luciferase expression. This observation was confirmed by the histological analysis of liver sections, as focal lesions were only observed in IFNAR\u2013/\u2013 mice, but not in the control mice (Fig. 7D). Overall, these results indicate that mice lacking a functional type I IFN response exhibit disseminated infection after intranasal inoculation with MHV\u2010A59, which could be readily visualized using BLI. In view of the increasing availability of all kinds of mutant mice, BLI is an attractive approach to investigate the role of a particular host protein or pathway in virus replication and dissemination in vivo.",

It has been established before that IFN can bypass the blood\u2013brain barrier after intranasal delivery (Ross et al., 2004). Following subsequent intranasal inoculation with 2 \u00d7 103 TCID50 of MHV\u2010EFLM, mice were processed for BLI at the indicated time points as described above (Fig. 8A). At day 2, replication of MHV was not significantly affected by the application of IFN. However, while virus replication spread to the brains of the mock\u2010treated animals, this was not observed in the IFN\u2010treated mice. Rather, the luciferase signal was lost by day 7. These observations were confirmed by the photon quantification of the head regions of the individual mice (Fig. 8B). Thus, exogenous delivery of type I IFN did not prevent the initial replication in the nose, but prevented dissemination of virus infection to the CNS. The results also indicate that BLI is a promising technique for the non\u2010invasive screening of antiviral compounds, the major advantage being that this system allows the detection of virus replication and spread after application of an antiviral compound over time within the same animal.",

However, the conventional approaches for studying viral infections in mouse models are frequently limited by the need to sacrifice large numbers of animals to quantify viral titres, and establish the complete pattern of virus dissemination. The application of non\u2010invasive imaging methods for the monitoring of virus infections in living animals can significantly facilitate studies on determinants of viral spread and pathogenesis (Hutchens and Luker, 2007). We used BLI for the real\u2010time monitoring of MHV infection by using recombinant MHV viruses that express FL reporter proteins. We confirm and extend previous observations by demonstrating that MHV dissemination is critically dependent on the virus inoculation route and dose, the viral spike protein, the genetic background of the host, and the type I IFN system. In addition, the technology provided insights into the kinetics and dynamics of the infection process under these different conditions. Furthermore, BLI revealed an animal\u2010to\u2010animal variation in viral spread and elucidated new anatomic locations of virus replication.",

            "text": "Despite its many attractive features for studying MHV replication and spread, the BLI technology has also some inherent limitations. First of all, photon transmission is affected by hair and organ pigmentation. Thus, photon flux from the surface of an animal will be superior to that from an internal organ, because light is attenuated about 10\u2010fold for every centimetre of tissue through which it has to pass (Contag and Bachmann, 2002). As a consequence it is impossible to quantitatively compare bioluminescent signals derived from different anatomic locations. This phenomenon also explains why the photon flux from the head region at 2 days post infection is much higher than at later time points as the signal initially originates from the nasal cavity but thereafter increasingly derives from the CNS, where it is much more shielded by surrounding tissue. To partly overcome this limitation, we routinely imaged the mice from both the ventral and the dorsal side. Second, the introduction of a foreign gene into the viral genome may affect virus replication in vivo. Interestingly, no significant differences could be observed between the replication of wild\u2010type and FL\u2010expressing viruses in the brain of intranasally infected mice, indicating that introduction of the foreign gene did not affect replication in vivo per se. However, after intraperitoneal application the replication of reporter gene expressing viruses in the liver was clearly much lower. The cause of this apparent discrepancy is currently unknown. Importantly, however, FL expression was found at all the known sites of MHV replication (Robbins et al., 1990; Holmes and Lai, 1996; Komurasaki et al., 1996; McIntosh, 1996; Perlman et al., 1999; MacNamara et al., 2008).",

Although it has been suggested that host range variants might arise in vivo during persistent infection of tissues that express low levels of the native MHV receptor (Schickli et al., 1997; 2004), this particular host range extension was obtained after serial passaging in vitro. Clearly, the mutant virus replicated to a much lower extent in vivo and was not able to spread to the brain. Many viruses adapt to heparan sulfate as an entry receptor upon propagation of the virus in cell culture (Olmsted et al., 1984; Mandl et al., 2001; Lee et al., 2004). Often, but not always (Liu and Thorp, 2002; de Haan et al., 2008), this adaptation results in a reduction of virulence in living animals, consistent with our results.",

In our experiments we monitored the replication of MHV in three different mouse strains. C57BL/6 and 129SvEv mice appeared to be less susceptible to infection compared with BALB/c mice after intranasal inoculation. Similar results were obtained when mice were infected with wild\u2010type MHV\u2010A59 and viral RNA load monitored using quantitative RT\u2010PCR. Strikingly, MHV replicated to approximately the same extent in BALB/c and C57BL/6 mice after intraperitoneal inoculation. Previously, mouse susceptibility to MHV infection was found to be linked to the viral receptor genotype (Ohtsuka and Taguchi, 1997). However, quantitative RT\u2010PCR analysis of the CEACAM1a expression levels in brain and liver revealed only relatively small differences in the MHV receptor levels between the different mice strains, which did not correlate with the observed differences in viral replication (data not shown). Apparently, other yet unknown host factors contribute to or limit the dissemination of MHV. The resistance of 129SvEv mice to infection is not restricted to MHV, because also vesicular stomatitis virus replicated much more efficiently in BALB/c than in 129SvEv mice after intranasal inoculation (Durbin et al., 2002). The difference in MHV replication between BALB/c and C57BL/6 mice might be associated with the mouse strain variation in immune responses which have been described for other virus infections (Scalzo et al., 1992; Brenner et al., 1994; Thach et al., 2000; Leipner et al., 2004; Weinberg et al., 2004).

Interestingly, clear differences in the spatio\u2010temporal dissemination of the infection could be observed after intranasal inoculation with different virus doses. As expected, the virus inoculation dose correlated with the luminescent signal at 2 days post infection. However, inoculation with a low virus dose resulted in delayed spreading of the infection to the CNS and subsequent delayed clearance. This result suggests that a certain level of replication in the nasal epithelium is required for subsequent dissemination. Strikingly, at 9 days post infection higher levels of virus replication could be observed after inoculation with the low dose compared with the high dose. Thus after inoculation with the high dose, virus was cleared faster from the brain. Apparently, clearance of the virus is triggered by the extent of virus replication in the brain. Probably high levels of virus replication more effectively induce an antiviral innate immune response. These results are corroborated by the observation that the expression levels of type I IFN and other cytokines positively correlate with the viral load in the brain of MHV\u2010infected mice (M.

These mice appeared to be highly susceptible to MHV and showed severe spread of the infection throughout the body when analysed with BLI after intranasal inoculation. In contrast, the parental 129SvEv animals only showed some low levels of viral replication in the nasal cavity. These results confirm and extend recent studies in which MHV\u2010A59\u2010infected IFNAR\u2013/\u2013 mice were also shown to be highly susceptible to infection, both after intraperitoneal (Cervantes\u2010Barragan et al., 2007) and after intracranial inoculation (Roth\u2010Cross et al., 2008). We additionally demonstrated the importance of the type I IFN system in controlling MHV dissemination by administration of type I IFNs. Intranasal delivery of recombinant type I IFNs inhibited the spread of the infection to the brain, consistent with a previous study using the MHV strain JHM (Minagawa et al., 1987). It was interesting to observe that, while the spread to the brain was affected, the initial replication in the nasal epithelium was not decreased by the intranasally administered IFNs.

Thus, while the infection invariably targets organs like brain, cervical lymph nodes and liver, depending on the inoculation route/dose, other anatomical sites of replication are less frequently detected (see Table S1 for an overview). Occasionally, MHV replication was measured in the lungs, in the intestine or in the eyes. Quite frequently infection was also detected in the tail and paws, body parts not described earlier as sites of MHV replication. These results suggest that MHV can spread to and replicate in bone marrow in vivo, consistent with earlier in vitro studies demonstrating infection of bone marrow\u2010derived macrophages and dendritic cells (Zhou and Perlman, 2006; Roth\u2010Cross et al., 2008). Strikingly, MHV replication in tail and paws was never observed throughout the entire length of these extremities, but occurred only in distinct sites that differed between animals. In this respect, the dissemination of MHV is reminiscent of cancer metastases, which often also occur at distinct anatomical locations (Molloy and van't Veer, 2008). Similar to the importance of micro\u2010environmental host factors in determining the non\u2010random pattern of tumour localization, replication of MHV may also be enabled by local conditions in a specific micro\u2010environment.",
