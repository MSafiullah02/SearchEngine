Reversal was achieved with neostigmine methylsulfate (Neostigmine\u00ae, Hameln Pharmaceuticals Ltd) 40\u201050 mcg/kg slowly intravenously when necessary. The surgical treatment included routine phacoemulsification lens extraction (Oertli Faros 3000\u00ae, Oertli instruments; Oertli OS3\u00ae, Oertli instruments; AMO Sovereign\u00ae, AMO Signature\u00ae, Abbott Medical Optics; now Johnson & Johnson as of 2017), with or without placement of an artificial intraocular lens (IOL). The cornea was incised and a 2\u2010step or 3\u2010step corneal wound was constructed. Intracameral adrenaline (Dilute Adrenaline 1:10 000, Martindale pharmaceuticals) 0.2 mL was injected in the cases where topical mydriatics had not been given pre\u2010operatively. The eye was inflated with a viscoelastic device (2% hydroxypropylmethylcellulose\u2014HPMC; An\u2010Viscose\u00ae 2%, Visionary Surgical Solutions, and 1.4% or 2% sodium hyaluronate, AJL Ophthalmic SA) according to surgeon's preference. A side port was created when needed while using continuous irrigation. A continuous anterior curvilinear capsulorrhexis was performed whenever possible followed by phacoemulsification of the lens. Placement of an artificial intraocular lens was performed when the integrity of the lens capsule allowed it. Intracameral carbachol (Omnichol\u00ae 0.01%, Dioptrix, France) 0.2\u20100.4 mL was in some cases used at the end of the surgery according to surgeon's preference. Postoperative IOP monitoring was performed when patient cooperation allowed it and it varied between centers. When POH occurred, additional measurements were taken as decided by the surgeon. Postoperative treatment differed among centers and included topical and systemic anti\u2010inflammatories, topical and systemic antibiotics, mydriatic/cycloplegics, and IOP regulating medication.",

            "text": "The outcome of phacoemulsification in cats is rarely reported in the literature. Stiles (2013) reported that the success rate for cataract surgery in cats appears better than in dogs.2 Braus et al (2015) concluded that overall, cats appeared to develop less inflammation following lens trauma and lens surgery than did dogs.16 The results of our retrospective study show an overall success rate of 92.6% for cats that remained within the study with a 12\u2010month follow\u2010up, and 89.5% still visual at the last follow\u2010up (range 6\u20101898d). POH (42.6%) was the most common complication in the immediate postoperative period. Reports of POH in dogs vary between 37.5%\u201048.9%,17, 18 which is comparable to our findings. Another report found that POH in dogs occurred in 22.9% of eyes.12 The use of carbachol was suggested to be the factor contributing to a lower POH prevalence in that study.12 Overall, the use of carbachol to reduce POH after phacoemulsification in dogs has shown conflicting results in the literature, and its effect is not clear.19, 20 The use of carbachol and its effect in diminishing the development of POH in our study was statistically significant. However, the results may have been influenced by the multi\u2010centered nature of the study and the different surgical approaches used by individual surgeons. A prospective study with standardized variables would be required to confirm this finding. Carbachol is thought to prevent or attenuate POH by opening the ciliary cleft, which has been experimentally demonstrated to be collapsed for at least 24 hours following phacoemulsification in dogs.21 However, Crasta et al (2010) found that the use of carbachol did not prevent POH in dogs and concluded that this variable effect may be due to the fact that ciliary cleft collapse alone is not responsible for POH.19 Labradors have been reported to experience a significantly increased risk of POH when compared to other breeds.22 No breed association was evident in our study; however, it may have been significant with a larger number of cases.",

Uveitis would have been expected in every case following surgery, as a breakdown of the blood\u2010aqueous barrier occurs following phacoemulsification.23 The reduced percentage of cases experiencing uveitis is likely due to the lack of information registered in the medical records, as it is likely that only \u201cunusual\u201d complications were recorded. Despite this, we included uveitis as a postoperative complication as it was obvious that there is a marked reduction in its occurrence more than 90 days postoperatively. Synechia/dyscoria (25.9%) was another complication at 1\u201090 days postoperatively; the occurrence was statistically significant between the congenital/juvenile (16.1%) and trauma (39.3%) groups, being higher in the trauma group. This result correlates with the expected clinical findings, as a damaged iris following trauma and the resultant uveitis/iritis are a common finding in these cases. PCO (36.1%) was the most common complication in the more than 90 days postoperative period. Some studies in dogs have reported PCO as the most common complication after cataract surgery.24, 25 In our study, PCO was the most common long\u2010term complication, affecting more than one\u2010third cases. The identification and characterization of PCO have limitations; a grading system would have been needed to assess the degree of opacity and the apparent impact on vision.",

            "text": "Glaucoma has been commonly reported as a complication in dogs following cataract surgery, with a prevalence that varies from 6.7% to 28.8%.9, 24, 26, 27 The glaucomas are a diverse group of diseases united only by the fact that, at least initially, IOP is too high to permit the optic nerve and, in some species, the retina to function normally.28 Characteristic changes in glaucoma include disrupted axoplasmic flow in the optic nerve head, death of retinal ganglion cells and their axons, cupping of the optic disk, and visual impairment or blindness.28 Glaucoma was not a common complication in our study. Of the three eyes that were enucleated in the total reviewed cases, only one was enucleated owing to a diagnosis of secondary glaucoma 3.6 years after surgery (but no histology was performed). The referring veterinarian euthanized this same cat 1 year later because of suspected secondary glaucoma in the remaining eye. Only two eyes continued to receive IOP regulating medication at their last follow\u2010up (2/47; 4.2%) but no vision loss was documented. The eyes that received IOP regulating medication during the 1\u201090 day postoperative period (47/80; 58.7%) did not continue to suffer from an elevated IOP, did not have any reported visual loss, and eventually were tapered off of the medication (apart from the two cases mentioned above). One of the other two enucleated eyes from the trauma group was histologically diagnosed with post\u2010traumatic sarcoma at 620 days after phacoemulsification. Feline ocular sarcomas are malignant intraocular neoplasms that are often associated with a history of ocular trauma.29, 30, 31 In general, they are locally invasive, potentially metastasize, and usually necessitate enucleation of the affected eye.32 A report that looked at clinical and morphologic features of post\u2010traumatic sarcoma in cats concluded that the most common consequence was infiltration of the optic nerve, which may extend to the optic chiasm and brain causing blindness and neurological disease.29 In the cat reported here, the histology report concluded that it was a fairly early stage of the disease with no evidence of scleral or vascular invasion and no extension into the optic nerve. The cat was still alive 3 years after phacoemulsification and 1.3 years after enucleation.",

The ocular findings considered for the diagnosis of uveitis were aqueous flare, keratic precipitates and/or iris hyperemia, as these were the more commonly reported findings in the cats\u2019 medical records. Therefore, the assessment of uveitis, both in a lower than expected number of cases as it is likely that only \u201cunusual\u201d complications were recorded and with only selected ocular clinical signs, is one of the limitations of this retrospective study. Another limitation is found in the secondary to uveitis cataract group. In these cases, the cause was already established in the medical records and we cannot rule out that these cats experienced primary cataract formation and lens\u2010induced uveitis. The study involved five different referral centers with different surgeons and no standardization of the treatment protocols. Thirty\u2010four cases were lost to follow\u2010up. The lost to follow\u2010up cases are inherent to the nature of a retrospective study, and this decreases its power; clinically significant statistical differences (type II error) may have been observed in a larger population.",
