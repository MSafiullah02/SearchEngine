Nonstop flights of less than 24 h connect the world\u2019s major airports; hence, physicians must be prepared to expect the unexpected. In New York City, for example, more than 12 million passengers annually pass through John F. Kennedy (JFK) airport from more than 100 international destinations. With this traffic volume in one metropolitan airport alone, it is not surprising that human and stowaway passengers like mosquitoes have been implicated in the transmission of West Nile virus, HIV, influenza virus, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, SARS coronavirus, and chikungunya virus. Exotic agents can also transit internationally in legal and illegal (bushmeat) food products and companion animals. The annual traffic in bushmeat through Charles de Gaulle airport in Paris is estimated at 273 tonnes [1]. In work with nonhuman primate, rodent, and bat bushmeat seized at JFK by the Wildlife Conservation Society, EcoHealth Alliance, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, we have found evidence of infection with retroviruses, herpesviruses, and pathogenic bacteria [2]. Illegal importation of companion animals such as birds, primates, and rodents has been linked to outbreaks of poxviruses and Salmonella [3, 4].",

The majority of zoonotic diseases can be attributed to anthropogenic change. Loss of wildlife habitat to development and consumption of bushmeat necessitated by poverty or due to cultural preference increases opportunities for cross-species jumps. Global warming may also increase the geographic range of phlebotomus insects like mosquitoes and ticks that serve as reservoirs and vectors for infectious agents [7]. Given that there are more than 50,000 vertebrate species, if we assume an average of 20 endemic viruses per vertebrate species, the potential reservoir of vertebrate viruses can be estimated at one million. Although it is unlikely that all of them can be transmitted to humans and cause disease, it is sobering to consider the challenge of detecting and responding even to 1 % of them (10,000 novel viruses).",

Early investments in surveillance for biological weapons gave way to surveillance for emerging infections when sober reflection led to recognition that the latter were more likely threats to public health. However, advances in synthetic biology over the past decade have been so dramatic that clinicians and public health practitioners must again consider the possibility that high-threat known and novel pathogens may arise through deliberate genomic manipulation either in the form of bioweaponeering, inadvertent release of high-threat human pathogens, or legitimate gain-of-function research, whereby low-risk agents become high risk. The scientific and larger communities are currently grappling with the implications of gain-of-function research in the context of experiments designed to understand virulence and transmission of H5N1 (avian) influenza viruses [8\u201313].",

In some instances, the virus responsible for the induction of disease is present at a site of organ pathology, and there is precedent for the same or a related virus causing similar disease. A classic example is herpes encephalitis where the detection of herpesvirus sequences by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of a patient with encephalitis provides a clear diagnosis and suggests a specific therapeutic intervention [14]. PCR alone can be inadequate. In West Nile encephalitis, PCR of CSF is less reliable than assays of CSF for IgM antibodies to the virus [15, 16]. In some instances, the footprints of an agent cannot be found in or adjacent to the affected organ but can be detected in other compartments. PCR detection of enterovirus, for example, in the feces of a patient with aseptic meningitis, provides strong evidence of enteroviral meningitis [17]. Despite these examples of success, an etiological agent is not identified by any test in up to 70 % of what is presumed to be viral encephalitis. Similar figures pertain in viral pneumonias.",

However, viruses can also induce systemic damage through cytokine storm resulting in shock, acute respiratory distress, and/or organ failure, cause immunosuppression resulting in opportunistic infection, or break tolerance for self, resulting in autoimmune disease. Infection can be cryptic, impairing differentiated cell functions like hormone secretion, inducing neoplasia, or impairing developmental programs that may not become apparent for months or years. In summary, the challenge in viral diagnostics is to develop strategies for not only detecting footprints of the agent itself in target tissues but also enduring shadows of infection in accessible compartments.",

            "text": "Once the mainstay of viral diagnostics, culture now receives less emphasis in clinical microbiology, chiefly because assays require days rather than hours; thus, information obtained is unlikely to directly impact patient management. Culture nonetheless continues to play an important role in public health as well as basic and clinical research because it enables insights into pathogenesis and the efficacy of drugs, antibodies, and vaccines. The presence of virus can be detected by changes in cell morphology at the level of light microscopy including lysis, rounding, and syncytia formation\u2014fusion of cells as revealed by an increase in size and the presence of more than one nucleus\u2014visualization of pathognomonic structures by electron microscopy; or viral proteins that bind antibodies as revealed through immunohistochemistry or immunofluorescent microscopy. A wide range of cell lines has been established for culturing viruses. Some are immortalized; others are primary cultures that can only be propagated for a few generations. Although some viruses can grow in many cell types, others have fastidious requirements. Some viruses have never been cultured despite implication in disease. In some instances, propagation failure may be overcome by adaptation with serial passaging in the presence of a second, permissive type of cell (cocultivation), the use of antibodies or RNAi to suppress innate immune responses, or cells obtained from genetically modified animals. However, serial passaging can lead to adaptation, including changes in virulence (the capacity of the virus to cause disease) or tropism (the cells and organs the virus can infect). Indeed, serial passage may be utilized to develop less virulent strains that can be used as vaccines. A potential confound in characterizing samples that may contain more than one virus is that the culture environment can select for the agent that is more fit to replicate\u2014that may or may not be the agent of interest. In an attempt to address this potential confound as well as to propagate viruses that fail to grow in simple cultures, investigators have developed cultures that include more than one cell type. In some instances these complex cultures are designed to replicate the architecture of an organ like the respiratory tract. An alternative to culture in cells is animal inoculation. An advantage of animal inoculation is that the presence of a wide range of cell types is associated with expression of a wide range of receptors that may allow virus entry. Most investigators use suckling mice because their innate immune responses are immature. Others use mice genetically modified to abrogate immune responses.",

            "text": "These assays, designed to detect individual viruses, are the most common NATs employed in clinical microbiology. They take several forms, but quantitative real-time PCR, wherein nucleic acid replication results in either cleavage or release of a fluorescence-labeled probe oligonucleotide that binds to a sequence region between the regular forward and reverse primers, is the most popular. The continuous (\u201creal time\u201d) reading of the reporter fluorescence signal affords these systems with unprecedented dynamic range and low false-negative rate. The required equipment, thermal cycler with fluorescence detector and (laptop) computer for data analysis, is cost competitive, and rugged battery-powered instruments are available for field use. Loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) tests do not require programmable thermal cyclers [18\u201320]. In the laboratory, LAMP products are detected in conventional dye-stained agarose gels, but in field applications the estimation of product accumulation through turbidity or dye reading by the naked eye is also possible [21]. The sensitivity of all such assays is highest when primers and/or probe sequences perfectly match the selected single genetic target. Fluorescence-based TaqMan or molecular beacon assays, for example, typically have detection limits of <10 molecules per assay. Although ideal for detecting and quantitating a specific known agent [22, 23], these assays may nonetheless fail with templates of variable sequence composition, especially if this affects the region of reporter molecule binding. This can be particularly challenging in the diagnosis of RNA virus infections as RNA viruses are characterized by high mutation rates and include species with high genetic strain variability. In comparison, consensus PCR assays are less likely to be confounded by sequence divergence but are also less sensitive than the specific PCR assays. Nested PCR tests that can employ consensus or specific primers in two sequential amplification reactions with either one (hemi-nested) or two (fully nested) primers located 3\u2032 with respect to the first primer set may both accommodate sequence variation and be more sensitive than fluorescent or beacon-based singleplex assays. However, whereas in quantitative fluorescence- or beacon-based real-time assays reporter readings are taken indirectly without opening the reaction vessels (\u201cclosed system\u201d), nested PCR systems bear a high risk of contamination because of the transfer of (amplified) material from the first to the second, nested reaction [24, 25], even if scrupulous experimental hygiene is observed. Recently, automated (closed) systems have been developed that allow contamination-free transfer between separate reaction compartments of single-use cartridges that may present new opportunities for nested assay design.",

By combining multiplex PCR amplification systems with various protocols for direct or indirect (tag-mediated) bead hybridization of the products, assay panels have been developed that permit detection of up to approx. 20 genetic targets simultaneously [30\u201332]; the most commonly used respiratory panels range from 9 to 20 plex [33\u201337]. Like real-time PCR, these assays rely for assay specificity on a three-oligonucleotide interaction with the target sequence. They are thereby limited in their tolerance for mutated or variant templates when compared to mass spectroscopy (MS)-coupled platforms that require only two oligonucleotide-binding sites, such as MassTag PCR or the Ibis T5000 system.",

The Ibis T5000 system uses matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) MS to directly determine the molecular weights of the generated PCR products and to compare them for identification with a database of known or predicted product weights [38\u201340]. MassTag PCR uses atmospheric pressure chemical ionization (APCI) MS to detect molecular weight reporter tags attached via a photo-cleavable linkage to PCR primers [41]. Whereas the Ibis system or the subsequent electrospray ionization (ESI)-based Plex-ID system requires analytical MS to determine the exact weight of the PCR products and thus depends on advanced mass spectroscopic data analysis, MassTag PCR can be performed using smaller instruments and does not require sophisticated analyses because it only records the known masses of the 40\u201380 reporter tags used in a given multiplex test. The Ibis system may be able to alert of variants of known organisms via a divergent PCR product weight, but like MassTag PCR, it too requires subsequent sequencing of the product for detailed characterization. A wide variety of syndrome-specific MassTag PCR panels have been developed and applied to the detection of viruses, bacteria, fungi, and parasites associated with acute respiratory diseases, diarrheas, tick-borne diseases, encephalitides/meningitides, and hemorrhagic fevers [41\u201350].",

There is no functional equivalent in viruses to the pathogenicity islands found in bacteria, wherein specific sequences acquired through horizontal gene transfer confer specific pathogenic properties. The best established criteria for proof of causation in infectious disease were developed in the late 1800s by Koch and Loeffler [80]. Known as Koch\u2019s postulates they stipulate that an agent be present in every case of the disease, be specific for the disease, and be sufficient to reproduce the disease after culture and inoculation into a naive host. In the 1930s, Rivers suggested that the development of specific immunity to an agent following the appearance of disease could be used in demonstrating causation [81]. Adapting the original postulates to the molecular era, Fredricks and Relman later established that microbial sequences may be used as surrogates for culturing the actual organism [82]. Lipkin and colleagues recently established levels of confidence in the strength of association between an agent and a disease that considers viral burden and distribution, specific immunity, and prevention or amelioration of disease with use of specific drugs or vaccines [12]. Given the sensitivity of molecular methods, it is imperative that physicians and researchers consider the biological plausibility of an assay result and, where feasible, pursue confirmation with an independent assay, particularly when engaged in pathogen discovery.",

Although some NATs, such as microarrays and high-throughput sequencing, still require substantial investment in equipment and personnel, diagnostic platforms are becoming more accessible and less expensive through miniaturization and improvements in methods for bioinformatic analysis. Systems using handheld microarrays, for example, are in development that will ultimately enable diagnosis at the bedside or in the field. Benchtop sequencers are also in production. It is inevitable that as sequencing costs continue to decrease, clinicians will seek information concerning not only the presence of a single candidate organism but also the predisposition of the host to disease based on genetic factors and coinfections with other microflora. These improvements will bring dramatic benefits to medicine and public health.",
