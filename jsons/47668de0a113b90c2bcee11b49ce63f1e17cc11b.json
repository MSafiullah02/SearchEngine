Positive results were twice as likely in paediatrics, 7573/11 491 (65.9%), compared to adults, 5410/17 238 (31.4%). Co-infection was more frequent in paediatrics, 1642/7573 (21.7% of positives), compared to adults 299/5410 (5.5%). Adenovirus had a high prevalence as a co-infection, 639/990 (64.5%), in paediatrics. Testing frequency increased by 179% in the paediatric group and by 949% for adults over the 6 years of observation. Conclusions: This study demonstrated a significant difference in the positive detection rate of pathogens and co-infections between the population groups. Adenovirus had a surprisingly high prevalence as a co-infection, especially in paediatric patients. Over the study period, rapid uptake of the test was observed, especially in adults. This raises concerns about how we can ensure that testing remains rational and is able to be provided in a cost-effective manner in the future.",

Indications for testing include the ability to change patient management (either directly or for infection control reasons) or assisting communicable disease epidemiology. Respiratory testing is an uncomfortable procedure that incurs expense. The rapid uptake of testing over this period highlights the need for testing behaviours to remain rational and cost-effective. 13 In the setting of prolonged viral shedding long after clinical resolution of disease, a positive result may even disadvantage patients and health-care providers due to unnecessary periods of respiratory virus isolation in infected inpatients. The ability to perform a test and obtain a positive result alone is insufficient reason to conduct respiratory testing.",

            "text": "The proportion of paediatric PCR-positive respiratory samples is comparable with other studies with reported rates between 42.7 and 74%. 2, [14] [15] [16] In the adult population, there is less available evidence for comparison that is not exclusive to specific subpopulations or inclusive of paediatric patients. From available data, our proportion of positive samples (31.4%) appears to be comparable. [17] [18] [19] Both the annual (17.7%) and seasonal (30.7%; May to August inclusive) detection rates of paediatric RSV infection are similar to other studies, with reported rates of 17.2-67.1%. 2, 15, [20] [21] [22] The detection rate of adult influenza A infection (annual 7.0%; seasonal 9.0%) is consistent with other studies. 17,23 RSV had a higher rate amongst the paediatric population compared with adults, whereas influenza A was more likely to be detected amongst the adult population, a previously recognised observation. 17 The most commonly identified pathogen in both groups was the picornavirus (48.3% of total positive results, 31.3% paediatrics and 17.0% adults), making it easily the most commonly identified pathogen in both population groups. Across numerous studies, the picornavirus remains the most common respiratory pathogen identified. 3, 24, 25 Its presence also contributes to a significant proportion of co-infections overall and nearly all coinfections that contain three-pathogen combinations. This raises the question of a possible role for the picornavirus in respiratory illness presentations in children and adults. This may be as a primary pathogen, a co-factor for other viral or bacterial infections or as a trigger for non-infective respiratory presentations such as asthma. It is important to recognise, however, that it is the high detection of the picornavirus amongst healthy individuals has been well described. 26 However, recent concomitant blood and respiratory PCR detection of the rhinovirus in children with signs of lower RTI suggests it may play a role in up to one in six children with RTI who test positive for the rhinovirus. 27 The incidence of co-infections in paediatric positive results (21.7%) is marginally higher than described in other studies (11.3-20 .6%), 2, 22 with previous studies also demonstrating lower co-infection rates in adults (5.5%). 28 The high proportion of adenovirus infections presenting as a co-infection has also been recently described amongst children with CAP. 29 Although not described on this scale previously, the adenovirus is also present in a significant proportion of adult co-infection.",

Their rate of overall positive result (39.2%) was lower.

Since the introduction of this testing, asymptomatic carriage of respiratory pathogens on confirmed testing has been described at between 40 and 68%. 9, 31, 32 The high prevalence of the picornavirus in co-infections has been described previously 23 ; however, as far as we know, this is the first time the high prevalence of the adenovirus has been documented. It does, however, raise the question regarding the clinical significance and burden of disease associated with those presenting with single-pathogen detection versus co-infection.
