            "text": "The BHK-ATeam cells infected with BVDV, EMCV, and JEV showed a significantly lower ratio compared to mock samples as early as 3 hr. This indicates a high consumption of ATP during the early\nphase of infection. This decrease in cytoplasmic ATP has also been observed in other RNA viruses such as HCV [2] and influenza virus [29, 38]. However, the non-cytopathic BVDV showed a higher Venus/CFP ratio in infected cells at 6 hr until 24 hr\npost-infection. The initial cellular response to a stressful stimulus involves protecting the cell against insult and promoting recovery [13]. Thus, it\nis highly likely that the cells responded to the viral presence by increasing ATP generation while viral replication rates remained the same or lower. The JEV-infected cells continued to show\na significantly lower ratio compared to mock samples indicating a higher rate of ATP consumption by this cytopathic virus compared to the rate of ATP generation by cells throughout the\ninfection (Fig. 2B). In contrast, the EMCV-infected cells showed no significant difference in Venus/CFP ratio at 6 hr post-infection (Fig. 2C). It is likely that the cells have increased ATP generation to compensate for the consumption, leading to the generation-consumption equilibrium.\nHowever, at 12 hr, the EMCV-infected cells died, owing to the oxidative stress caused by the virus in the cells during infection [1]. The ATP in these RNA\nviruses is quickly consumed as many steps in the viral life cycle require high energy phosphoryl groups [2], such as the formation of the pre-initiation\ncomplex for de novo RNA synthesis by RdRp of flaviviruses [34], ATP-dependent transcriptional initiation and RNA replication by\ninfluenza virus RdRp [26, 43], and assembly and/or release of viral structural proteins possibly via interaction\nwith ATP-dependent chaperones [16, 28]. Under light microscopy, morphology-based CPE usually appears at 16 hr for\nEMCV, day 3 for JEV, while BVDV is noncytopathic (Supplementary Fig. 2); however, the ATP-based CPE using ATeam technology is\nalready evident at 3 hr (Fig. 2A). This indicates that the ATeam technology is not only an early marker for the CPE but also a novel indicator for the\n\u201cstealth infection\u201d without morphology-based CPE.",

The program set was used to analyze the Venus/CFP ratio of the infected\ncells by the selected viruses for 3 hr. All the viruses caused a significant difference in the Venus/CFP ratio although the pattern is not the same (Table\n2). The PTV and AKV showed a significantly lower ratio while the other viruses showed a significantly higher ratio as compared to the mock controls. This result of PTV and\nAKV-infected cells is similar to what was observed in BVDV, EMCV, and JEV infected cells, and in previously reported RNA viruses such as HCV, influenza virus, and dengue virus [2, 10, 29, 38]. The other viruses, namely\nBCV, BEV, BPIV3, and IBR showed a significantly higher ratio than the mock-infected cells. This result is similar to previously reported vaccinia virus [4], HCMV [32], baculovirus [35], and avian reovirus [5], where an\nincrease in intracellular ATP level was observed because of the upregulation of mitochondrial genes for proteins which are a part of the ETC, and upregulation of TCA to increase ATP production\nfor virus propagation [15, 32]. Among the viruses tested, the morphology-based CPE usually appears on day 3 for\nAKV, day 5 for BCV, day 6 for BPIV3 and BEV, while IBR and PTV showed no morphology-based CPE (Supplementary Fig. 2). Thus, the\nATeam system is a fast method to determine ATP-based CPE by a viral infection, as early as 3 hr when the morphology-based CPE is yet to be conclusive.",

            "text": "In the presence of a stressful stimulus, the initial cellular response is directed towards coping with the insult, by mounting an appropriate protective cellular response to ensure cell\nsurvival [13]. There are various pro-survival activities of the cell including the heat shock response, unfolded protein response (UPR), DNA damage\nresponse, and the response to oxidative stress, all aimed at restoring the cellular homeostasis [13, 14, 19]. Viruses, being an intracellular parasite, utilize the cellular machinery and resources for their replication which consequently elicits cellular stress\nresponses. It is reported that various viruses such as the African swine fever virus, cytomegalovirus, hepatitis B virus, papillomavirus, vaccinia virus, BVDV, JEV, and HCV modulate UPR by\nbinding of the master control binding protein to the accumulated misfolded or unfolded proteins, leading to the release of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) transducers: PKR-like ER kinase (PERK),\nactivating transcription factor 6 (ATF6), and the ER transmembrane protein kinase/endoribonuclease (IRE1) which subsequently leads to homodimerization and refolding of proteins [17, 22, 23]. Furthermore, the viruses cause ER stress by exploitation of the ER\nmembrane (e.g., poliovirus, coxsackievirus B3, dengue virus and hepatitis C virus), accumulation of misfolded proteins (e.g., influenza A virus, hepatitis A virus, JEV, and HCV), imbalance of\ncalcium concentration by viroporin (e.g., influenza A virus, coxsackievirus B3, poliovirus 1), and the sabotage or depletion of the ER membrane during virion release (e.g., rotavirus) [22, 39]. Viral infections also induce the formation of stress granules by cells, which are aggregates containing the\npre-initiation complexes where the translation is arrested, but interfered by viruses like the West Nile virus or dengue virus [30]. The viruses such as\nHCV, HIV, human adenovirus-5, Epstein-Barr virus, hepatitis B virus, and EMCV can induce reactive oxygen species (ROS) which directly or indirectly help them to survive [1]. All of these cellular responses affect the celular metabolites and require a lot of energy, thereby affecting the ATP level. Additionally, many viruses may modulate the\nmitochondrial-mediated pathways [1], and directly affects ATP. All of these protective cellular responses to viral infection requires ATP and thus,\ninfected cells will also increase the generation of ATP to compensate for the loss until all resources are exhausted by the viruses, leading to cell death. It is, therefore, logical to\nconsider the intracellular ATP level as an indication of viral invasion of cells and as an early sign of CPE.",
