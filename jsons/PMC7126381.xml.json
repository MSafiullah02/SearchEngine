            "text": "Fructus Forsythiae, the fruit of Forsythia suspense (Thunb.) Vahl (Oleaceae), is a well-known traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) and is widely used for the treatment of infections such as acute nephritis, pharyngitis, pyrexia erysipelas, ulcer, tonsillitis and gonorrhea [1]. Remarkably, Fructus Forsythiae was recommended for the treatment and prevention of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) [2] that may be caused by the inappropriate activation of complement systems [3]. So, it is hopeful to search for anticomplementary components from Fructus Forsythiae. Its main bioactive components were identified as phenylethanoid glycosides, lignans and flavonols according to phytochemical investigations [4], [5]. Forsythoside A (FTA) is one of the main phenylethanoid glycosides from Fructus Forsythiae, which possesses strong antimicrobial, antioxidant and antiviral activities [6], [7]. The chemical structure of FTA is composed of three chemical moieties including aglycone (caffeic acid), phenylethanoid aglycone (hydroxytyrosol), and sugar moieties. Its content was approximately 8% in total, which was much higher than other ingredients, but its absolute oral bioavailability was approximately 0.5%, which was significantly lower [8]. However, FTA bioavailability demonstrated a more direct relationship with the pharmacological efficacy of forsythia extract than the representative ingredients in lignans such as phillyrin [9], [10]. According to the reports, the mechanism of FTA intestinal absorption was passive diffusion and involved paracellular transport, which is mainly governed by tight junctions [11], and FTA may be a substrate of CYP3A4, CYP2C9, CYP1A2, UGT1A6, UGT1A3, UGT1A1 and UGT1A9 for in vitro metabolism in Sprague\u2013Dawley rat liver microsomes [12]. Moreover, most herbal medicines are orally administered, and their active components are therefore brought into contact with intestinal microflora in the alimentary tract, which are mostly composed of anaerobes [13]. Some of them are transformed by intestinal bacteria before absorption from the gastrointestinal tract. Studies on herbal component metabolism by intestinal microflora are of a great importance to understanding their biological effects [14], [15]. So far, there is no report on the metabolism of FTA by intestinal bacteria. In addition, most studies on bioactivity of FTA were focused on antibacterial and antiendotoxin activities but not anticomplementary activity. In our study, FTA was anaerobically incubated with human fecal microflora, its metabolites were identified via UPLC\u2013Q-TOF/MS and pharmacological effects were tested.",

The incubation process as well as the activity tests are under 37 \u00b0C or at low temperatures due to FTA instability at high temperature. Fortunately, no metabolites in our study was found (Figure not given) when FTA was incubated with blank that only contained GAM. Accordingly, the intestinal bacterial metabolism played an important role in the generation of three metabolites. FTA was proved to deglycosylated to CA and HT under the existence of glycosidase in the intestinal microflora. The same metabolic behavior was observed in naringin [22] and anthocyanin metabolism [23]. Hydrogenation also played an important role in CA metabolism in our study. These results were different from the Parkar's report [24], which demonstrated that CA may be metabolized into 3-hydroxyphenylpropionic acid and DCA mainly when incubated for 24 h with human fecal bacteria. This difference may due to different substrate concentrations or the presence of HT during the metabolic process.",

The gel-clot method is thought of as the most accurate and sensitive procedure for determining endotoxin content because fewer false-positive and false-negative results are observed when that method is used [35]. Our study reveals that among FTA and its intestinal bacterial metabolites, HT and DCA had an antagonistic effect against endotoxin. DCA, a possible metabolite of CA containing the o-dihydroxyl structure, expressed higher antiendotoxin, anticomplementary and antibacterial effects than CA. Previous results suggested that the olefinic double bond in CA is an important factor for enhancing antioxidant activity [36]. Thus, it is likely that the 2,3-double bond of CA is critical for the pharmacodynamic expression of DCA.",

What's more, anticomplementary and antiendotoxin properties of HT and DCA were determined for the first time in our study. Therefore, both DCA and HT were considered to be possible and effective metabolites in the body after oral administration of phenylethanoid glycosides such as FTA. The present result indicated that the biological activities were increased when FTA was metabolized to HT and DCA by human intestinal bacteria, which were coincident with the previous report that the intestinal flora played an important role in the metabolism of orally administered or bile-excreted compounds [39].
