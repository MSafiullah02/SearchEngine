Most individuals, including those infected with the 2009 pandemic H1N1 IAV (H1N1pdm), experience an uncomplicated influenza. Up to 75 % of infections with seasonal influenza or H1N1pdm are estimated to be subclinical [1\u20134]. However a low percentage of H1N1pdm-infected patients, many of them without known risk factors, develop primary viral pneumonia (PVP) and a minority even develop acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), requiring admission to an intensive care unit (ICU) [2, 4]. Inherited variability in host immune responses may influence susceptibility and outcome of IAV infection, but the molecular nature of such factors remains largely elusive [5\u20138].",

The variant IFITM3 rs12252-C alters a splice acceptor site and encodes an aberrant form of the protein lacking the N-terminal 21 amino acids (\u039421 IFITM3). Conflicting results about the impact of the IFITM3 rs12252-C variant, coding for the \u039421 IFITM3 protein, in controlling IAV restriction in vitro have been reported [9, 10]. It has been proposed that homozygosity for the rs12252-C allele is associated with development of severe influenza in Northern Europeans and severe IAV infection in Asians [9, 12, 13]. However, these results were not replicated in a recent report from the United Kingdom [14]. In the present study, we assessed whether the IFITM3 rs12252-C allele is associated with susceptibility to and severity of influenza virus infection (IVI) among a white Spanish population.",

Later, Zhang et al.

These studies suggested that homozygosity for the IFITM3 rs12252-C allele was associated with a population-attributable risk for severe influenza of 5.4 % in Northern Europeans and 54.3 % for severe H1N1pdm infection in Chinese [9, 12]. Both studies included small sample sizes. Moreover, the association found by Everitt et al. [9] relied on imputed control genotypes, which may bias the frequencies when rare SNPs, such as rs12252, are studied. In addition, not all of their three rs12252-C homozygous patients have undergone population stratification analysis, thus not ensuring only Caucasian ancestors.",

By contrast, two rs12252-C homozygous individuals in a group of 259 Caucasian patients with mild influenza, and four in a group of 2,623 Caucasian controls who had never required hospital admission, were identified. The authors found a recessive association of the rs12252-C variant with mild influenza, but not with severe influenza. These data contrast with those of Zhang et al., who found an association with severe but not mild influenza [14]. Among our 118 patients with IVI, the only patient homozygous for rs12252-C was a 15-year-old girl who had a severe neurological disorder (West syndrome), a risk factor for severe influenza. However, after infection with H1N1pdm, she presented with mild influenza. Hence, no association with severe IVI was observed in our study. By contrast, we found a nonsignificant increase of the rs12252-C allele, but not genotypes, in patients with IVI compared to control Spanish individuals. In addition, when data from our study and those from Mills et al. [14] were analyzed together, a marginal significant association of homozygosity for rs12252-C with mild IVI was observed. These data suggest that, at least in populations of European origin, homozygosity for rs12252-C could confer an increased risk for IVI, but not for severe influenza. Since no patients with mild influenza were included in the study of Everitt et al. [9], their results might also arise as a consequence of the association of rs12252 with susceptibility to, rather than severity of, IVI.",
