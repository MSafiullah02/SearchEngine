            "text": "Purpose The usual first-line strategy of wild-type EGFR (wtEGFR) non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) remains cisplatinbased chemotherapy. However, cisplatin often loses effectiveness because most tumors acquire drug resistance over time. As EGFR is the most important pro-survival/proliferation signal receptor in NSCLC cells, we aimed at investigating whether cisplatin resistance is related to EGFR activation and further evaluating the combined effects of cisplatin/gefitinib (EGFRtyrosine kinase inhibitor, EGFR-TKI) on cisplatin-resistant wtEGFR NSCLC cells. Materials and methods EGFR activation was analysed in parental and cisplatin-resistant wtEGFR NSCLC cell lines (H358 and H358 R , A549 and A549 R ). Cellular proliferation and apoptosis of H358 R /A549 R cells treated with cisplatin or gefitinib, alone or in combination were investigated, and the related effector protein was detected by western blot analysis. Anti-tumor effect of two drugs combined was evaluated in animal models of H358 R xenografts in vivo. Results EGFR was significantly phosphorylated in cisplatin-resistant wtEGFR NSCLC cells H358 R and A549 R than their parental cells. In H358 R and A549 R cells, anti-proliferative ability of gefitinib was further improved, and gefitinib combined with cisplatin enhanced inhibition of cellular survive/proliferation, and promotion of apoptosis in vitro. The combined effects were also associated with the inhibition of EGFR downstream effector proteins. Similarly, in vivo, gefitinib and cisplatin in combination significantly inhibited tumor growth of H358 R xenografts. Conclusion Abnormal activation of EGFR may induce wtEGFR NSCLC cell resistance to cisplatin. The combined effects of cisplatin/gefitinib suggest that gefitinib, as a combination therapy for patients with cisplatin-resistant wtEGFR NSCLC should be considered.",

Michaud et al. 2009 ) and off-target resistance (Ren et al. 2010; Shen et al. 2010; Yu et al. 2011) . The susceptibility of wtEGFR NSCLC cells to cisplatin can be limited by offtarget mechanisms, that is, molecular circuitries that deliver compensatory pro-survival signals even though they are not directly activated by cisplatin (Galluzzi et al. 2012) .",
