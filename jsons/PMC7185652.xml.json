Routine mycologic analysis on BAL samples consisted of direct examination (Musto staining), semiquantitative culture, determination of galactomannan index (Platelia Aspergillus antigen, Bio-Rad, Schiltigheim, France), and Pneumocystis jirovecii detection by PCR. The semiquantitative cultures were realized as follows: 2 to 6 mL of BAL, depending on initial BAL volume received, was centrifuged (15 minutes, 2500 \u00d7 g), and 100 \u03bcL of the pellet was cultivated onto ChromID Candida medium (bioM\u00e9rieux, Paris, France) and incubated for 9 days at 35\u00b0C followed by 7 more days at 27\u00b0C. Morphologic A. fumigatus identification was confirmed by \u03b2-tubulin sequencing and comparison to the Genbank, Centraalbureau voor Schimmelcultures (CBS), and European Molecular Biology Laboratory databases. The mean inhibitory concentrations (MICs) to amphotericin B, caspofungin, fluconazole, voriconazole, and posaconazole were determined by Etest (bioM\u00e9rieux). Determination of galactomannan index (Platelia Aspergillus antigen, Bio-Rad) was performed on the BAL supernatant and concomitant serum samples. DNA for P. jirovecii detection was obtained using a manual extraction kit QIAamp DNA mini kit (Qiagen, Courtaboeuf, France).",

The studies using the AsperGenius kit showed 65.5% to 84.2% sensitivity and 80% to 91.4% specificity with cross-reactivity with Rhizopus oryzae and Penicillium chrysogenum.23, 30, 31 The MycAssay Aspergillus kit had various sensitivities (80% to 100%) and specificities (92.9% to 98.6%, cross-reactivity with A. flavus).21, 32, 33 The MycoGENIE A. fumigatus study showed 92.9% sensitivity (versus culture) and 90.1% specificity.34 Variation in sensitivity may be explained by various PCR targets, including 28S rRNA (AsperGenius, MycoGENIE), 18S rRNA (MycAssay), and ITS1 (A. fumigatus Bio-Evolution), as well as by different methods of DNA extraction. Although Wheat et al2 described equivalent performances for manual and automated DNA extraction processes, a better sensitivity was observed by others with automated extraction.31, 32, 33, 35, 36 In a multicenter analysis, White et al37 demonstrated a better PCR sensitivity using larger sample volumes and small elution volumes (\u2264100 \u03bcL). In our study, DNA was previously manually extracted for P. jirovecii routine PCR, and the kits were evaluated in our routine conditions. BAL-extracted volume depended on the volume of the initial sample received and varied from 2 to 6 mL. A study showed an equivalent efficiency for pellet and supernatant extraction for A. fumigatus detection,38 whereas others revealed better efficiency extraction using pellet.31 Here, BALs were concentrated by centrifugation and 200 \u03bcL of the pellet were extracted, as recommended by the extraction kit's manufacturer. Elution volume used during the extraction process was 200 \u03bcL, according to our routine extraction protocol. An optimized elution volume (50 or 100 \u03bcL) may improve detection capacities of the tested PCR.",

However, an extensive study to evaluate the detection of cryptic A. fumigatus species would be valuable. Nevertheless, identification of Aspergillus species at species level in the case of a negative BAL culture results has improved the diagnosis accuracy and could allow the quick adjustment of antifungal therapy, especially when a non-Aspergillus infection was suspected.",

Several studies propose serum DNA detection as a noninvasive screening technique for the population at risk of IPA because of its feasibility and specificity. BAL fluids are more difficult to obtain and thus could be used to confirm Aspergillus presence and to enhance the sensitivity of Aspergillus detection in respiratory samples.44 However, Aspergillus DNA detection in BAL does not differentiate colonization from an invasive pulmonary infection or from an allergic aspergillosis and, as culture or galactomannan, remains just a detection method of Aspergillus presence.",
