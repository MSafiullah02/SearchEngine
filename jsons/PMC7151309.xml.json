            "text": "Foreign direct investment (FDI) by multinational enterprises (MNEs) represents one of the most researched phenomena in international business (Blonigen, 2005, Werner, 2002, Paul and Singh, 2017). However, most reviews of the FDI literature do typically focus on a specific subset of FDI only (e.g., Buckley and Casson, 2009, Chan et al., 2006, Meyer, 2003, Blonigen, 2005, Fetscherin et al., 2010, Klier et al., 2017, Paul and Benito, 2018). For instance, Meyer (2004) surveyed the research on FDI spillovers in the context of emerging market economies. Chan et al. (2006) examined the interdependencies between FDI and MNE foreign-market-entry strategies. Blonigen (2005) reviewed past research on host-country-specific determinants of FDI. Buckley and Casson (2009) analyzed the progress of FDI research and internalization theory. Fetscherin, Voss, and Gugler (2010) conducted an interdisciplinary literature review on FDI in China.",

In this context, our goal is to come out with the most comprehensive review of the MNE-FDI literature. We focused on FDI that occurs when MNEs invest in assets in foreign countries and establish some form of a subsidiary to execute market-seeking, strategic asset-seeking and/or efficiency-seeking activities (Dunning, 1993, Dunning, 1998). With coverage of all topics under FDI, our review highlights specific gaps in the extant literature and offer directions for future research.",

Similarly, we discuss some of the key contributions to the FDI literature focusing on theories and variables. Dominant theories applied were identified -including the eclectic OLI (Ownership, Location, Internalization) paradigm and internalization theory, amongst others- and provide a path to contrast the more established theories with those more recently introduced such as Conservative, Predictable and Pacemaker (CPP) model. Further, we provide a citation analysis of the most impactful articles and authors in the last five decades of research. Next, we identify the most widely used variables in FDI research such as IFDI and OFDI, locations and determinants, economic growth, FDI spillover effects, entry modes, MNE strategy, etc. Afterward, we report dominant research methodologies including statistical approaches. Finally, we provide suggestions for future research regarding theories, content, and methodology. The value of this review lies in its breadth and the exhaustiveness of the literature identified. It complements the focused sub-analysis of the past and therefore represents a valuable base reference tool for future MNE-FDI research.",

Next, we performed a keyword search across selected online databases, including Business Source Premier, JSTOR, ScienceDirect, ProQuest, and Google Scholar for the articles on FDI published during the last five decades. Keywords included Foreign Direct Investment, FDI, Inward FDI, Outward FDI, Multinational Enterprise, MNE, and Foreign Subsidiary. In the first phase, we incorporated empirical papers that used at least one statistical technique based on primary or secondary data. However, based on feedback from experts, we then also included selected high-impact theoretical articles (based on citation counts- minimum 500 citations) to identify key contributions to theory.",

Next, we reduced the total number of articles by excluding those that were not published in journals included in the Social Sciences Citation Index (SSCI) completing our final sample with 500 articles. Additionally, we established a research agenda for the future, related to content (antecedents, characteristics, and outcomes of FDI) and methodology.

Rugman (1980) provided an integrative framework for the existence of the MNE by integrating internationalization and internalization logic. Internalization (Buckley and Casson, 1976, Buckley and Casson, 2009) explains the motivation for firms to engage in FDI by exploring home-country (country of origin) internal firm-specific advantages (resources and/or capabilities) instead of relying on local factor endowments in individual foreign product markets (Verbeke & Kano, 2016). Hennart, 1982, Hennart, 1986 developed the internalization model further by extending it along with vertical and horizontal integration of MNE-FDI activities. This has spurred recent studies to draw on internalization theory to explain FDI in the context of regionalization and global value chain disaggregation (Rugman and Verbeke, 2003, Pak and Park, 2004, Rugman, 2010, Verbeke and Kano, 2016).",

            "text": "Dunning\u2019s OLI paradigm (e.g., 1988, 2000) has been the most widely used lens in MNE-FDI research. This paradigm explains the way firms leverage resources - namely ownership advantages (O), location advantages (L), and internalization advantages (I) to compete in foreign locations (Dunning, 2001). The use of the OLI paradigm remains in effect in contemporary FDI research. Over 30 studies in our sample were framed either along all three OLI dimensions or were focused on one of the dimensions in finer-grained approaches. For instance, Delevic and Heim (2017) stated that home market deficiencies are compensated by the host country's location advantages, and Cook, Pandit, Loof, and Johansson (2012), using a geographical clustering approach for global cities, built on the L-advantages notion and found that more experienced MNEs and those with stronger home-country resource positions are more likely to engage in OFDI. One reason for the prevalence of the OLI paradigm might be that it forms a grounded starting point for developing other theories/frameworks that explain the evolving MNE-FDI phenomenon. Also, the OLI paradigm even if not represent a theory but allows linking international business phenomena with other theories \u2013 such as including transaction cost economics and the resource-based view - and also with other fields like economic geography. Despite the relevance of the OLI paradigm and its refinements, Dunning (2006) admitted that the unique context of OFDI from EMNEs could require a revision of some of its premises. Barkema, Chen, George, Luo, and Tsui (2015) pointed towards the difficulty of testing Western theories with Eastern constructs by discussing the properties of equivalence, salience, and infusion, and provided directions for creating new theories and paradigms. In addition, the OLI paradigm might not be suitable for explaining FDI patterns of new-generation firms (e.g., Cannon and Summers, 2014, Ross, 2016) such as Google, Uber, Airbnb, and Bitcoin, which are asset-light and often virtual in their internationalization approach.",

            "text": "PLC theory represents the focal theoretical lens in several FDI studies, though it has not received the same level of attention as the OLI paradigm in recent years. Vernon (1966) developed the theory based on FDI from U.S.-based MNEs in Western Europe after World War II \u2014 specifically, those in the manufacturing sector. Vernon identified four stages of production which he believed formed a continuous cycle: innovation, growth, maturity, and decline. As per this theory, firms undertake exports before thinking about production abroad in the form of FDI. The PLC theory suggests that capital-intensive and technologically sophisticated innovations are typically developed for the domestic market and progress through various stages in which production shifts to other (mainly) developed countries and, finally, to developing countries; such as Contractor, Dangol, Nuruzzaman, and Raghunath (2019, p.2) that indicate that \u201cmultinational companies are willing to take the risk by investing in a country with a lower institutional quality at one stage of the investment\u2019s life-cycle in exchange for a more developed institutions, or easier regulations, at another stage of the life cycle\u201d. The scope of PLC theory is not limited to FDI research. It is being applied in other fields as well, such as marketing, where PLC theory was particularly popular in the 1980s and 1990s (Calvet, 1981, Boddewyn, 1983, Kim and Lyn, 1987, Trevi\u00f1o and Daniels, 1995).",

According to institutional theory, organizational structures and behavior are to a large extent determined and legitimated by the surrounding environment (e.g., Eisenhardt, 1988, Child, 1997). Several studies have applied institutional theory while focusing on the choice of appropriate organizational forms such as IJVs versus wholly-owned subsidiaries for foreign market entry (e.g. Li and Meyer, 2009, Roy and Oliver, 2009, Peng, 2003, Yiu and Makino, 2002, Lu et al., 2018). Meyer (2004) highlighted the relevance of institutional theory when considering and deciding on the suitability of different market-entry modes for EMNEs from emerging countries. Some researchers (Cui and Jiang, 2012, Deng, 2013, Delevic and Heim, 2017) have used institutional theory to explain that EMNEs are subject to institutional constraints such as state interference.",

RBV is an approach used to explain how firms achieve competitive advantage while going international. RBV gained popularity in the 1980s and 1990s, after the major works published by Wernerfelt, 1984, Barney, 1991. Ghoshal (1987) was one of the pioneers in applying RBV to international business. The proponents of the RBV argue that firms should look internally to find the sources of competitive advantage instead of searching for it in the external competitive environment. In this approach, resources are classified as either tangible or intangible. One of the key factors is that intangible resources (such as intellectual property rights and brand equity) are the main sources of sustainable competitive advantage (Wernerfelt, 1984, Barney, 1991). Some researchers have applied RBV in the context of OFDI from EMNEs (Cui and Jiang, 2009, Cook et al., 2012, Lin, 2016, Gaur et al., 2018).",

            "text": "In recent years, the LLL model and the Springboard Framework (discussed below) have gained immense popularity because of their utility in explaining the specific determinants, motivations, and processes of outward OFDI from EMNEs. With the LLL framework, Mathews, 2002, Mathews, 2006 extended the OLI framework to EMNEs with strategic asset-seeking FDI. The LLL framework explains the way EMNEs from peripheral countries in the Asia-Pacific region established themselves successfully in more developed countries. Mathews (2002) suggested that FDI, in pursuit of new capabilities, requires a different perspective than FDI meant to exploit existing capabilities. EMNEs can develop capabilities to the maximum, such that they can globalize (Hobdari, Gammeltoft, Li, & Meyer, 2017) and, also, EMNEs engaged in OFDI from emerging countries, often, enter late to already developed markets and thus principally exhibit catch-up strategies. EMNEs frequently exhibit accelerated or even leapfrogging internationalization patterns. Most researchers have used the LLL model in the context of the internationalization of Asian firms - particularly Chinese firms. For instance, Ge and Ding (2007) applied the LLL model to demonstrate how Chinese firms, such as Galanz Group, developed unique competitive strategies that helped them succeed in foreign markets. On the other hand, Narula (2006) argued that the tenets of the LLL model are interesting, but it proposed modifications, in comparison to the OLI paradigm, seem less than convincing.",

The most cited articles were published in the Journal of International Economics, Journal of International Business Studies, and American Economic Review; thus, these articles were not strictly confined to business journals. Empirical articles with more than 2,000 citations (as of January 30, 2020) include Feenstra and Hanson, 1997, Balasubramanyam et al., 1996, Markusen and Venables, 1999, Dunning, 2000, Helpman, 2006, Cheng and Kwan, 2000.",

Enderwick (2005) found that the benefits derived from MNE activities for FDI-receiving countries depend on quality rather than quantity. Higher-quality FDI includes investments focused on technology or research and development (R&D) that can lead to, for example, knowledge spillovers to other firms in FDI-receiving locations. Alfaro et al., 2004, Durham, 2004 found that the realization of these benefits is dependent on the absorptive capacity of local firms in FDI-receiving countries. While the general understanding of host-country determinants (e.g., regulatory, political, economic, and cultural institutions) that stimulate FDI has progressed considerably, findings concerning the effects of FDI on receiving countries remain mixed. FDI host-country effects range from positive to insignificant, to negative - depending on the conceptual lens or the contextual setting deployed in a specific research project (e.g. Alvarez and Marin, 2013, Asiedu et al., 2009).",

For example, Kedia, Gaffney, and Clampit (2012) posited that an EMNE strategic orientation predicts its propensity to engage in knowledge-seeking FDI and that the type of knowledge sought predicts location choice and entry mode. In recent years, OFDI characteristics related to MNE home countries have attracted increasing attention amongst scholars (Sauvant, 2005, Kedia et al., 2012). Here, research on EMNEs is experiencing a particularly strong surge (e.g. Filatotchev et al., 2007, Bhaumik and Driffield, 2011, Cui and Jiang, 2009, Cui and Jiang, 2012). Several focused journal issues and summary papers have now begun to discuss the characteristics of EMNE internationalization processes - shedding more light on the subject (e.g., Kearney, 2012, Gray et al., 2014, Cuervo-Cazurra et al., 2014).",

Furthermore, the US, China, and Japan have been most often studied in the context of outward MNE FDI (see\nTable 2\n). The reasons for this might lie in (a) the magnitude of outward MNE FDI from these three countries and/or (b) the fact that data from these countries are more easily obtainable and that they thus provide better opportunities for quantitative analyses. Only a handful of studies have so far examined outward MNE-FDI from other countries such as India, Turkey, etc. (e.g., Bhaumik and Driffield, 2011, Narayanan and Bhat, 2011, Demirbag et al., 2009).",

IFDI research has been mainly concerned with various host-country determinants that are associated with attracting firms to specific locations (e.g., Balasubramanyam et al., 1996, Balasubramanyam et al., 1999, Borensztein et al., 1998, Alguacil et al., 2002, Chakraborty and Basu, 2002, Liu et al., 2002, Buckley et al., 2006, Baharumshah and Thanoon, 2006, Delevic and Heim, 2017). The most frequently investigated determinants include market size, government policies (including entry barriers, cost of production, and wage rate), infrastructure, etc. (e.g., Kobrin, 1976, Rolfe et al., 1993, Loree and Guisinger, 1995, Luo and Tan, 1997, Reiljan, 2003, Ramamurti and Doh, 2004, Blonigen, 2005, Galan and Gonzalez-Benito, 2006, Blonigen and Piger, 2014). Ramamurti and Doh (2004) found that the 1990s witnessed a boom in FDI flow in developing countries (particularly in infrastructure sectors) that were characterized by weak institutions and political instability. Meyer and Nguyen (2005) offered a theoretical framework to analyze how institutions in an emerging economy influence MNEs\u2019 entry strategy decisions on where and how to set up operations. They found that sub-national institutional variables influence significantly location and entry mode. Similarly, Feils and Rahman (2011) revealed that after regional integration exists an increase in IFDI into neighboring countries. On the other hand, Jin, Garc\u00eda, and Salomon (2018) observed that IFDI affects more innovative firms than straggling ones.

Studies concerned with OFDI seek to explain FDI motives, FDI determinants, and characteristics of MNEs regarding their particular home countries (e.g., Stevens and Lipsey, 1992, Desai et al., 2005). Some researchers in the recent past have investigated how to encourage or even participate in corporate OFDI to facilitate the internationalization of private as well as state-owned firms from emerging countries (Kearney, 2012, Gray et al., 2014, Cuervo-Cazurra et al., 2014). Although the emerging market MNE internationalization phenomenon is not new, its rapid increase in scale only started in the early 2000s (Ramamurti and Singh, 2009, Luo et al., 2010). A key part of this development is arguably due to the rise of Chinese (see, for example, Buckley et al., 2006, on the determinants of OFDI from China) and Indian MNEs (Rienda, Claver, & Quer, 2013) - have become major sources of OFDI. In emerging countries, the pattern of OFDI is shaped by local firms\u2019 idiosyncratic contexts such as business groups (a dominant organizational form in emerging countries) and the resources that those firms developed to fit the contexts (Tan and Meyer, 2010, Lin, 2016). Chari (2013) found a positive relationship between business group affiliation and OFDI overall, in the case of firms from developing countries using Indian data as well as between business group affiliation and OFDI into advanced countries. Ali, Shan, Wang, and Amin (2018) results showed that positive or negative changes in outward FDI trigger meaningfully economic growth in China, demonstrating asymmetry between OFDI and economic growth relationship.

Studies on Outcomes (O) usually seek to discuss variables such as performance after innovation, technology and knowledge transfers including reverse transfers and goes beyond financial results to encompass strategic outcomes such as survival or success of the firms involved in FDI.",

However, research investigating the relationship between GDP and MNE-FDI is characterized by somewhat diverging findings. For example, Angresano, Bo, and Muhan (2002) found that real GDP has a considerable positive effect and that GDP growth has a minor positive effect on FDI inflows. Hsiao and Shen (2003) identified a reciprocal relationship between FDI and GDP growth. However, by drawing on data from 28 developing countries, they found that FDI has neither consistent long-term nor short-term effects on GDP growth. Findlay (1978) investigated the role of FDI as a carrier of foreign technology, claiming that it could increase economic growth. Using simultaneous equation methods, Ruxanda and Muraru (2010) obtained evidence of a circular self-reinforcing relationship between FDI and economic growth, meaning that incoming FDI stimulates economic growth and that, in turn, a growing level of GDP attracts new FDI. Anwar and Nguyen (2010) found similar results. Table 6\nlists recent papers that investigate the relationships between GDP, economic growth, and FDI.",

Brouthers and Brouthers (2003) found that the investment-intensive nature of manufacturing, environmental uncertainties, and risk propensity influence manufacturers\u2019 entry-mode choices, while behavioral uncertainties, trust propensity, and asset specificity influence service providers\u2019 entry-mode choices. Meyer, Ding, Li, and Zhang (2014) analyzed equity stake decisions, that drive MNEs to choose between two establishment mode routes: greenfield or acquisition. Delios and Beamish (2001) examined the influences that a firm\u2019s intangible assets and its experience have on foreign subsidiary survival and profitability using a sample of 3,080 subsidiaries of 641 Japanese firms. They show that survival and profitability have different antecedents. Host country experience has a direct effect on survival but a contingent relationship with profitability; this relationship is moderated by the entry mode. Luo (2001) found that entry-mode selection in an emerging economy is influenced by situational contingencies at four levels: nation, industry, firm, and project. He suggested that the joint venture\u2019s mode is preferred in China when perceived governmental intervention is high or host-country experience is low. Chung, Xiao, Lee, & Kang (2015) showed that institutional pressures exerted by the home-country government have a significant effect on the OFDI mode decisions of Chinese firms. Those Chinese MNEs facing greater institutional pressures from their own government are more inclined to choose joint ventures over wholly-owned foreign subsidiaries when investing abroad.",

Subsidiary performance improves with (i) the integration of a parent firm's technological and marketing knowledge resources, (ii) high technological (market) relatedness between a parent firm and subsidiaries for transfer of parent technological (market) knowledge, and (iii) the co-presence of high technological and market relatedness (Fang, Wade, Delios, & Beamish, 2013).

Lee and Rugman (2012) examined two types of firm-specific advantages (FSAs) \u2014 innovation capabilities measured by R&D intensity and marketing capabilities measured by selling, general, and administrative intensity. The results showed that both FSAs affect MNE performance in a non-linear, U-shaped fashion and that the investing MNE\u2019s home region moderates the curvilinear relationship between the two constructs into an inverted U-shaped one. S\u00e1nchez-Sellero et al. (2013) investigated the determinants of absorptive capacity from FDI spillovers and found that firm behavior, capabilities, and structure drive absorptive capacity such as R&D activities and expenditures, R&D results, internal organization of innovation, external relationships of innovation, human-capital quality, family management, business complexity, and market concentration. Their results complement previous evidence of absorptive capacity, particularly with different approaches to innovation activities as mediators of the capability.",

They found empirical support for a significant positive relationship at the aggregate level. Similarly, Chen and Tan (2012) examined the relationship between internationalization and firm performance using the data of 887 publicly listed Chinese firms (and the geographic region to which they internationalize) by classifying the regions as Greater China, Asia and outside Asia.

Therefore, we call for new and novel theories to use in this area of research. We suggest that with the rise of EMNEs and the emergence of new industries (Cannon and Summers, 2014, Ross, 2016) and new corporate firms like Google, Uber, and Bitcoin, recently developed theories/models such as CPP (Conservative, Predictable & Pacemaker markets and firms), Model for firm internationalization (Paul & Sanchez-Morcillo, 2019) or 7-P framework (Paul & Mas, 2019), based on Potential, Path, Process, Pace, Pattern, Problems and Performance, can be used as a theoretical lens in future.

Further, research on EMNE-OFDI has so far looked at a limited number of determinants and is based on EMNE data from a very limited number of home countries (mainly China). We suggest that for EMNE research, in particular, the LLL (Mathews, 2006), Springboard Perspective (Luo & Tung, 2007) and ADO framework (2018) provide potentially better fitting and organized starting point for research on EMNEs. Similarly, it would be insightful if researchers use frameworks such as i) Luo (2005) typological framework (aggressive demander, silent implementer, ardent contributor, and network captain) to analyze the simultaneous cooperation and competition between geographically dispersed sub-units of MNEs ii) Paul and Sachez-Morcillo (2019)\u2019s CPP, model to explore the direction and pattern of FDI.

We suggest that utilizing contingency models from the strategy domain might create an opportunity to more accurately connect country-level and firm-level FDI research with the literature on MNE strategy. Another area of opportunity lies in comparative analyses in the context of FDI from developed countries and developing countries while drawing on existing models, including the CAGE framework (Ghemawat, 2001, Ghemawat, 2003). Previous theory development has been based on the notion that most MNE-FDI is directed toward predictable markets (markets with similar features in terms of cultural, administrative, geographical, and economic distance). This notion is likely a result of firms avoiding dealing with any liability of foreignness issues, problems arising from cognitive biases, and resource constraints. Today\u2019s level of economic development of emerging markets and the level of developed market-bound investments by EMNEs (Mathews, 2006, Luo and Tung, 2007, Demirbag et al., 2009) should provide ample opportunities for such research. It is also worth extending the institutional theory and RBV in such studies. For instance, there are opportunities to develop theories and frameworks and extend the available theories to explain the FDI phenomenon of emerging market firms - in particular, Asian firms. This is true especially considering that Asia has emerged as a strategically important region. There are opportunities to develop separate frameworks to analyze the path, process, pace, pattern, problems, and potential of MNE investment concerning the past, present and future all within the context of strategy. For example, there is scope for developing theories that explain the pace of internationalization regarding entry mode switch from exporting to FDI.",

Current FDI research is largely cross-sectional, in nature. We suggest investigating longitudinal FDI patterns using firm-level data for different industries and countries. We believe that characteristics-based studies offer ample potential for future research. In this regard, we feel that it would be interesting to examine the linkage between business groups and the mode of entry into foreign countries. For example, research on the pertinent question \u2014 do the firms supported by business groups follow the same pattern and entry mode while going international in the form of FDI? This phenomenon can be examined in the context of both developed as well as developing countries. Further, we believe that a fruitful area of investigation is entry and establishment modes based research (Dikova & Brouthers, 2016) at either the firm level or industry level, particularly for high-value, knowledge-intensive industries. Here, the emerging research on global value chain disaggregation (e.g., Mudambi & Puck, 2016) could benefit strongly from such an approach.",

While FDI research on country-level outcomes is abundant in literature, research studies dealing with firm-level outcomes are not as many as the country-level studies. We believe that this provides a promising opportunity for future research. For example, Yang, Martins, and Driffield (2013) found a significant relationship between the breadth of a firm\u2019s FDI and performance. They showed that the return on FDI over time in developing countries represents a U-shaped relationship, indicating that multinationals are likely to face losses in the early stage of their investment in developing countries before positive returns are realized. We suggest that researchers test the FDI\u2013profit relationship hypothesis further with reference to wholly-owned subsidiaries and joint ventures and find evidence from different countries. While a substantial amount of research provides insights into antecedents and characteristics of acquisitions or greenfield FDI, the outcome of such investments at the firm and industry levels is very limited. Similarly, research on the outcomes of technology transfer for FDI intensity should be particularly fruitful.",

This implies the scope for developing new frameworks, paradigms, and theoretical models to explain different dimensions of MNE-FDI such as key motivates (antecedents), entry /and establishment mode decisions and characteristics or outcomes as suggested by Paul and Benito (2018). There are immense possibilities to develop typologies for discussing one or more of the dimensions of FDI such as - Potential, Path, Process, Pace (ex, switching entry mode), Problems or/and Performance. Although the methods used in FDI research have grown to be more sophisticated, there are opportunities to develop integrative approaches by studying the antecedents, characteristics, and outcomes of FDI simultaneously. On the other hand, most studies build models in single countries only. It would be very useful if researchers conduct comparative analyses either for a group of countries or for two countries with similar or dissimilar features.",

Here, propensity score matching that is similar to what was done by Hayakawa, Matsuura, Motohashi, and Obashi (2013) could provide interesting results. Such a novel approach would be valuable, as plenty of studies have already been published on FDI using multiple regressions with control variables. Recent advances in structural equation modelling techniques could also be deployed. Another important aspect is that researchers in this area should specify carefully the degree to which their insights are likely to generalize in different settings. One suggestion is to collect primary data from at least three firms/MNEs as there is less number of studies using such data, in comparison to the number of studies using secondary data. Nevertheless, it is important to understand that secondary data may provide useful benchmarks.",
