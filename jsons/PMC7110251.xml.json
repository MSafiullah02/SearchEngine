These include the folate receptor,10 members of the Tyro3 family of receptor tyrosine kinases (Axl, Dtk, Mer)11 and T cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain 1,12 although the relevance of the folate receptor for filovirus entry was later disputed.13,14 In addition, numerous C-type lectins, calcium-dependent carbohydrate-binding molecules, including the asialoglycoprotein receptor,15 DC-SIGN and DC-SIGNR,16,17 human macrophage galactose-type C-type lectin18 and liver and lymph node sinusoidal endothelial cell C-type lectin19 have been reported to interact with GP1 and promote filovirus entry.",

Given low case numbers and geographical restriction to resource-limited regions, industry-sustained drug development programmes are unlikely. Nonetheless, there is a clear unmet clinical need from naturally occurring cases as well as an additional potential need given that filoviruses are considered to be CDC category A bioterrorism agents (www.bt.cdc.gov/bioterrorism). Given the complex filoviral route of entry, we hypothesized that drugs which perturb cellular signalling networks and are approved for other indications might also interfere with filovirus entry. We performed a small-scale screen and found that amiodarone, a multi-ion channel inhibitor used clinically as an anti-arrhythmic agent, acts as a potent and specific inhibitor of filoviral cell entry. The concentrations of amiodarone that are required for filovirus inhibition are well within the range that is achieved in serum during anti-arrhythmic therapy in humans, i.e. 1.5\u20132.5 \u03bcg/mL.28",

There was a clear concentration-dependent reduction in the percentage of NP-positive cells while the overall cell number was unchanged (Supplementary Data). Significant inhibition was observed at amiodarone concentrations of 0.5 \u03bcg/mL or higher (Figure 3). On averaging all the experiments performed, the IC50 was 0.25 \u03bcg/mL, corresponding to a calculated therapeutic index of above 50. Of note, the apparently flatter slope of the concentration response curve is most likely due to the fact that experiments performed on separate occasions were averaged.

Pseudoparticles bearing GP of the Ebola virus species Tai Forest, Reston, Sudan and Zaire, as well as MARV, were similarly inhibited by amiodarone (Figure 4a). Thus, amiodarone is a blocker of cell entry mediated by viral GPs from across the Filoviridae family. Among a broader range of human pathogenic enveloped viruses that enter target cells through endocytosis and in a pH-dependent manner, we observed a significant inhibition of pseudoviruses bearing the GP of the New World arenavirus Guanarito (Figure 4b). VSV-G- (Rhabdoviridae family), Lassa virus GP- (Old World arenavirus) and Hantaan (Bunyaviridae family) virus GP-pseudotyped lentiviruses were affected to a lesser extent. Since all pseudoviruses have the same lentiviral NP and reporter genome, these differences strongly support the fact that amiodarone exerts its inhibitory effect on viral cell entry, i.e. a replication cycle step up to the point of fusion of the viral envelope with a cellular membrane.\n",

Amiodarone was present either 1 h before the cells were washed three times and then EBOV or MARV pseudoparticles were added to the cells, or during the 6 h when the cells were exposed to the pseudoparticles, or both (Figure 5a). We observed the most marked inhibition when the drug was present throughout the experiment, i.e. from 1 h prior to addition of pseudoviruses until 6 h after, followed by the set-up where amiodarone was present only during the cell entry phase. In the case of MARV, there was also significant inhibition when the drug was present only before the pseudoparticles were added to the cells. This is suggestive of a cell-directed mechanism of action. However, the effect on the target cells appears to be reversible upon removal of the drug. Moreover, when EBOV pseudovirus was incubated with a high concentration (4.5 \u03bcg/mL) of amiodarone and then washed in 100 kDa filter devices in order to remove drug, we observed a subsignificant 52% reduction of infectivity relative to VSV-G pseudoviruses (Supplementary Data). Next we assessed whether EAhy cells could be adapted to amiodarone by growing them in the presence of 1.5 \u03bcg/mL amiodarone for 2 weeks prior to experimentation. Cell growth was largely unaltered and there were no obvious morphological alterations. We observed a comparable degree of inhibition of EBOV and MARV pseudoparticles, suggesting that prolonged exposure to amiodarone does not lead to compensatory changes in the host cell (Figure 5b).\n",

Thus, several agents that are either non-specific ion channel inhibitors (amiodarone, dronedarone) or inhibitors of L-type calcium channels (verapamil) inhibit cell entry mediated by filoviral GPs, while other agents possessing some of the other multiple pharmacodynamic effects of amiodarone do not.\n",

Mortality is very high in resource-poor settings, and even when modern intensive care is available, treatment is challenging.43 Several potential approaches have been suggested based on in vitro or animal data. These include monoclonal antibodies isolated from survivors,44 lipid-stabilized small-interfering RNAs directed against viral genes45 and a recombinant VSV-based vaccine.46 However, it will be difficult to transfer these highly experimental approaches into routine clinical care. Very recently, the oestrogen receptor modulator clomiphene, which is licensed for ovarian stimulation in humans, has been reported to inhibit filovirus infection, possibly by perturbing the role of NPC1 in filoviral entry.47,48 Amiodarone is available both as an oral and an intravenous formulation and has been used for decades for both the long-term and short-term treatment of cardiac arrhythmias. As a generic drug, its use would be feasible in both resource-rich and resource-poor settings. It is known to have a narrow therapeutic window, but serum levels to treat cardiac arrhythmias are in the range of 1.5\u20132.5 \u03bcg/mL, which is 6- to 10-fold above the in vitro IC50 we observed for authentic filoviruses.28 The known side effects of amiodarone (which include ocular and pulmonary toxicity, thyroid dysfunction and pro-arrhythmic effects) are generally manageable, especially in the short term. Importantly, they would clearly be acceptable if the drug at the same time increased the odds of survival in the setting of acute filoviral haemorrhagic fever. Given that filoviral haemorrhagic fever involves the spread of infection to a broad range of cells and tissues, it is plausible that a potent entry inhibitor would limit systemic spread and hence might reduce mortality. However, clinical studies would be needed to determine this.",

However, there was also a trend to reduced infectivity when pseudoviruses were pre-treated with amiodarone and then washed before being added to the target cell. This might suggest that either we were unable to completely separate the drug from the virus or that amiodarone inhibition requires some form of ternary interaction between drug, filovirus and host cell.",

Since both are thought to enter target cells via the late endosome, this would be consistent with an amiodarone-mediated perturbation of this compartment.22,51,52 Indeed Shoemaker et al. have reported that clomiphene and other related inhibitors of filoviral entry they have identified have in common that they are cationic amphiphiles causing a Niemann\u2013Pick-like accumulation of cholesterol in the endosomes.47 This could be due to inhibition of acid sphingomyelinase by a broad range of cationic amphiphiles.53 Amiodarone, dronedarone and verapamil, with pKa values of 8.5, 9.8 and 8.8, respectively,49,54 all fit into that category. Moreover, entry through late endosomes has also been suggested for hantaviruses, one of which was modestly inhibited by amiodarone in our research.55 In a different study, an inhibitory effect of very high concentrations of amiodarone on severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus was reported.50 That paper suggests that the inhibition of infection occurs after fusion of the viral envelope with the late endosomal membrane and delivery of the viral genome to the cytosol. Since a block at a post-fusion step would be expected to affect all pseudoviruses equally, this does not explain our observation that some pseudoviruses are inhibited by amiodarone while others are not.",

Amiodarone is a pleiotropic drug known to target potassium channels, sodium channels, calcium channels, and \u03b1- and \u03b2-adrenergic receptors. When testing other agents with a narrower range of molecular target, only the L-type calcium channel blocker verapamil exhibited an anti-filoviral effect. These findings may suggest a role for calcium currents in filoviral entry. While their role is more obvious in excitable tissues such as muscle and neuronal cells, L-type calcium channels are also present in many non-excitable cells including endothelial and epithelial cells.56,57 Calcium fluxes can cause rapid shifts in intracellular calcium levels and are an important part of cellular signalling processes, most notably maybe the phospholipase C/1,4,5-inositol trisphosphate/diacylglycerol pathway.58 Thus, interference with the calcium-mediated cell signalling events required for the orchestration of filoviral entry is another plausible mechanism. Interestingly, it has very recently been reported that gabapentin, verapamil and other inhibitors of voltage-gated calcium channels, as well as the siRNA-mediated knockdown of calcium channel subunits, inhibit infection by the New World arenavirus Junin.59",

(a) EAhy cells were transduced with EBOV (upper panels) or MARV (lower panels) pseudoparticles in the presence of the indicated concentrations of dronedarone. Individual data points represent the mean \u00b1 SD of n = 3 independent replicates from a representative of three independent experiments. (b) Transduction in the presence of calcium channel blockers. For each drug, a lower and a higher concentration was used as follows: ethosuximide, 100 and 300 \u03bcg/mL; verapamil, 20 and 60 \u03bcg/mL. Individual data points represent the mean \u00b1 SD of n = 3 independent replicates from a representative of three independent experiments. (c) Transduction in the presence of the sodium channel blocker lidocaine (5 and 15 \u03bcg/mL), the \u03b2-receptor blocker metoprolol (0.2 and 0.6 \u03bcg/mL) and the potassium channel blocker/\u03b2-receptor blocker sotalol (3 and 9 \u03bcg/mL).
