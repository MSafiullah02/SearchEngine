            "text": "Three large studies provided new epidemiological data. The AbSeS (Epidemiology of intra-abdominal infection and sepsis in critically ill patients), a multicenter, observational study in adult ICU patients diagnosed with intra-abdominal infection (IAI) in the year 2016, included 2621 patients from over 300 ICUs and 42 countries [1]. IAI was community-acquired in 31%, mortality was almost 30% and prevalence of multidrug-resistance 26.3% (with great variation according to geographic region but without difference between community-acquired and hospital-acquired IAI). Madsen et al. conducted a Scandinavian, multicentre, prospective cohort study in 409 adults with necrotising soft-tissue infections NSTI [2]. The main finding was the surprisingly low (18%) 90-day mortality despite the presence of septic shock in half of the population, acute kidney injury in 20% and comorbidity in 70%. Monomicrobial group A streptococcus infection, mostly in NSTI of the extremities, was associated with lower mortality compared with polymicrobial infection, mostly in abdominal/anogenital NSTI. Miailhe et al. reported one of the largest registries for severe leptospirosis in metropolitan France (a non-tropical area) [3]. They reported on 160 patients with a very low rate for ICU admission (0.04%) and a moderately low hospital mortality (9%) despite a high severity and organ failure score. Among four phenotypes, mortality was worst in neurologic leptospirosis. The main risk factors for leptospirosis contamination were contact with animals, contact with river or lake water, and specific occupations.",

Another controversial topic in the filed in infection diagnosis is ventilator-associated lower respiratory tract infections (VA-LRTIs), either ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or tracheobronchitis (VAT). The VAPrapid2 trial, a prospective randomized trial in patients with suspected VAP, assessed the impact of measuring IL-1\u03b2 and IL-8 in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid on antibiotic prescription [10]. Although low biomarker levels had a negative predictive value of 100%, the antibiotic consumption in the first 7 days after BAL was not affected by biomarker-guided recommendations. Another interesting study showed that 16S rRNA taxonomic profiling of bacteria in respiratory specimen early after intubation in antibiotic-naive patients recovered more VAP pathogens compared with conventional cultures with the abundance of Bacilli being associated with subsequent VAP in a matched case\u2013control study. This promising diagnostic approach requires further investigation [11].",
