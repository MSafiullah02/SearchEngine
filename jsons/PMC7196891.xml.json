The number of admissions to ICUs\nis expected to continue to increase in many countries for some time to come. About\none-tenth of patients with COVID-19 will require some form of ventilatory support\n(invasive and non-invasive) on ICUs that are already (almost) full under normal\ncircumstances. The lesions of COVID-19 are potentially reversible, so that efforts\nto support patients must be sustained. But the acute course of the disease can last\nmany days and even weeks, so that bed occupancy is often prolonged, resulting in a\ncritical shortage of ICU bed availability and ventilators.",

            "text": "The same rule of reserving ICU beds for the most likely to benefit also applies in\nother conditions of disaster medicine. However, although the pandemic situation is\nsimilar in many aspects to disaster medicine, there are five important differences\nbetween a single catastrophe (for example, an explosion in a factory, a train crash,\na collapsed building) and an epidemic: In a catastrophe, the number of patients is generally known and\nfixed at a relatively early stage although of course some patients may\ndeteriorate later. The number of beds likely to be needed is therefore\nfairly easy to predict. In epidemics, it is difficult to predict how\nmany patients will become infected and need ICU\nadmission.In a catastrophe, there is a one-off trigger event and the acute\nsituation is limited in time. Some patients may deteriorate over\nsubsequent days, but these are usually limited in number, and this is\nnot generally a major challenge. The amplitude of the problem is quickly\nappreciated. In epidemics, patients continue to be infected over a\nprolonged, and generally difficult to predict, period of time, with\ninitially small numbers of cases increasing often rapidly over a period\nof days, weeks or even months.In a catastrophe, healthcare staff are generally not affected and\nthere are many who can be called in to help. In epidemics, some of the\nspecialized personnel will also become ill or need to be quarantined\nand, over time, it can be increasingly difficult to replace\nthem.In a catastrophe, patient transfer is usually possible from one\ncentre (often the hospital or clinic closest to the catastrophe) to\nother more specialized centres. In epidemics, this is particularly\ndifficult because of the extra hygiene measures necessary to protect\nstaff and other patients and the fact that most, if not all, hospitals\nwill be under similar pressure with shortages of staff, beds and\nequipment.In a catastrophe, most hospitals have established disaster plans\nin place, which are periodically enacted and can be activated\nimmediately. In epidemics that affect several regions or countries\nsequentially, hospitals may have some time to prepare for the arrival of\nthe epidemic in their country, to already start to reorganize the\nhospital to free up ICU beds, and to establish rules of triage and\napproaches to the likely difficult ethical decisions that will be faced.\nThey can also learn from the approaches implemented by other affected\ncountries.",

The numbers of ICU beds\nwithin each hospital are usually relatively small and they are generally well\noccupied. The obvious solution to lack of ICU bed availability is to somehow\nincrease the number of beds available for critically ill patients (Table 1). This could\nbe achieved by transforming less sophisticated units, such as recovery rooms,\ncoronary care units or stroke units, into ICUs. This raises potential problems,\nhowever, related to obtaining sufficient numbers of trained staff for the extra\nbeds. A second option is to perform some interventions normally reserved for the\nICU on general wards. There are three types of ICU treatment that cannot be\nprovided elsewhere: mechanical ventilation for acute respiratory failure, renal\nreplacement therapy for acute renal failure and cardiovascular support for acute\ncirculatory failure (shock). In the case of COVID-19, one could consider using\nsome forms of respiratory support, such as high flow oxygen therapy, continuous\npositive airway pressure or non-invasive respiratory support, outside the ICU,\neven though there is a risk if staff are not familiar with these techniques or\ntrained to use them.",

A Clinical Frailty\nScore5 could also be calculated, as has been recommended by\nthe National Institute for Health and Care Excellence in the UK.6 These\nscores, combined with other factors including clinical evaluation, age and\ncomorbid conditions, could potentially be used to create a priority score to\nguide limited resource allocation.7 Working closely with\nother medical disciplines, including geriatric medicine, can help in these\ncomplex decisions.",
