The infection is associated with high morbidity in animals of all ages and with high mortality in suckling piglets and may cause devastating economic problems [1], [2], [3], [4]. TGEV is composed of three major structural proteins, the spike (S), the integral membrane (M) glycoprotein, and the nucleocapsid (N) protein, containing 1447, 262 and 382 amino acids, respectively [5], [6], [7]. A positive single-strand RNA approximately 4.3 kb in size, regulates and encodes the synthesis of S protein [8], [9]. Virus neutralization in the absence of complement is directed against the S protein [10], [11], [12]. The amino-terminal half of glycoprotein S encodes four major antigenic epitopes primarily responsible for inducing neutralizing antibodies [13], [14].",

            "text": "Like TGE, PRV infection (Aujeszky's disease, AD) is another serious, worldwide problem in swine that cause significant economic losses. In young piglets as well as in the other susceptible species, PRV infection is often fatal, and animals die from central nervous system disorders [20]. Taxonomically, PRV belongs to the herpesvirus group of enveloped animal viruses, which constitute a large family of DNA viruses whose genome consists of linear, double-stranded, noncircularly permuted DNA molecules [21]. The genome of the herpesviruses has been divided into three or five classes (depending on different nomenclatures); correspondingly, the genome of PRV is a class 2 or class D [22], [23]. PRV genome of approximately 150 kb encodes at least seven glycoproteins [24], [25]. gE (gI), gC (gIII), gI (gp63), and gG (gX) are not required for viral growth in tissue culture and are therefore designated non-essential [26], [27], [28], [29]. In contrast, gB (gll), gD (gp50), gL and gH (gL and gH are a complex) are thought to be essential for PRV replication [30], [31], [32], [33], [34]. The multiple nonessential regions within the large size genome of PRV allows the insertion of large and/or multiple DNA fragments encoding foreign antigens to create vectored vaccine. Furthermore, PRV has a broad host range, infecting most mammals and some avian species. However, higher primates including humans are not susceptible to infection [20]. These characteristics, together with the verified immunogenicity [35] and the nononcogenic properties, make it suitable to exploit PRV and its genome for vaccine development.",

Two fragments named Ga and Gb containing partial PK and full-length gG genes of PRV genome were amplified respectively by PCR using the extracted genome as template. Ga fragment was amplified with sense primer 5\u2032-TTTTGATGGAGGGCATGCTGAAGCG-3\u2032, whose position is on SphI site of PK gene, and anti-sense primer 5\u2032-ATTTAGCACGACGATGTACAGGCCGG-3\u2032, whose position is downstream of PstI site of gG gene. Gb fragment was amplified with sense primer 5\u2032-TTTACGTGAACGCCAGCCTCGTGCTGCAG-3\u2032, whose position is on PstI site of gG gene, and anti-sense primer 5\u2032-TTTGAATTCGCCACGTGGCGGTAGCCGTCG-3\u2032, whose position is nearby the most 3\u2032 end of gG gene. A recombinant plasmid pUG was constructed via inserting Ga and Gb into SphI and EcoRI site of cloning vector pUC119 (TaKaRa). In parallel, another recombinant plasmid pHS was generated by introducing the amino-terminal half (about 2.2 kb) of glycoprotein S of TGEV designated S1 subunit encoding four major antigenic sites into BamHI and EcoRI sites of a prokaryotic expression vector pPROEX HTc (GIBICO). SV40 polyA sequence derived from plasmid pEGFP-N1 (CLONTECH) was amplified by specific sense primer 5\u2032-TCGGCATGGACGAGCTGTACAAGTA-3\u2032 and anti-sense primer 5\u2032-AAACTGCAGGGCACCTCGACCCCAAAAA-3\u2032. The restriction enzyme sites of primers are in bold. The polyA was then inserted into XbaI and PstI sites, locating the downstream of S1 fragment of pHS. The continuous fragment containing S1, multiple cloning sites (MCS) from pPROEX HTc and SV40 polyA gene was digested from pHS, and was subsequently subcloned into BamHI and PstI sites of gG promoter downstream of pUG. The new recombinant was termed pUGS. In addition, a report gene LacZ controlled by the immediate early promoter of CMV was inserted into the PstI site of pUGS. The construction flowchart of the PRV transfer plasmid designated as pUGS-LacZ containing major antigen sites of S gene of TGEV is briefly illustrated in\nFig. 1.",

Moreover, current conventional virus vaccines may lead to the recovery of virulence and the emergence of antigenic variant viruses. In contrast, the inactivated vaccine is relatively safe, but it produces weaker lactogenic protection to the piglets. It is supposed that immunogenicity of the latter is too low to induce adequate S-IgA. Currently, some genetic engineering subunit vaccines are also being under investigated [37], [38], [39]. Although this kind of vaccines may prevent the infection to piglet from authentic virus, the low immunogenicity, difficulty of inoculation and production cost, etc. are still bottlenecks for their actual application.

Besides vaccinia virus and herpesvirus including PRV, other above-mentioned viruses share some inherent deficiencies for vaccine exploration, such as smaller nonessential region size, need for helper virus or specific host cell lines and poor safety. The application of vaccinia virus vector is also partially limited due to its relatively narrow host range. In contrast, PRV, as a member of herpesvirus demonstrates some significant advantages: firstly, there are multiple non-essential regions within the large genome of PRV, allowing up to 40 kb insertion of foreign genes; secondly, this virus can result in efficient mucosal infection capable of inducing a stable specific immune response; furthermore, PRV indicates no evidence for oncogenesis [49]. More recently, a bivalent vaccine prepared by integrating NS1 protein gene of Japanese encephalitis (SA14-14-2) virus into PRV genome illustrated the enormous potential and exploited prospects for future application of PRV genome-based vector [50].",

Five recombinants containing either the full-length or the S1 subunit of TGEV S gene have been constructed via inserting the foreign genes into the E3 region of porcine adenoviruses of serotype 5. Three of them all induced TGEV- and PAdV-5-specific virus-neutralizing antibodies by oral immunization of pigs [17]. This suggests that generation of TGEV/PRV live vector vaccine has potential for use as an improved vaccine, because adenoviruses and PRV are similar in terms of inducing mucosal immunity. Our previous experiment also indicated that the DNA vaccine encoding the S1 subunit of TGEV can elicit more potent humoral and cellular immune responses in immunized mice than that induced by DNA vaccine encoding full-length S gene of TGEV (unpublished data).",

            "text": "The constructed PRV genome-based high-efficiency transfer vector was composed of a strong promoter, polyA and length-optimal homologous arm sequences, etc. In order to facilitate gene expression, the S1 fragment was located at the downstream of gG glycoprotein promoter regulated by immediate early and early gene products. Some foreign genes, such as human tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), Escherichia coli LacZ or glycoprotein E1 of hog cholera, have been expressed by the same way [51], [52], [53]. It was reported that the heterologous fragment insertion in gG gene gave rise to no changes in cell tropism and virulence [54]. Interestingly, however, we found that the cytopathic effect (CPE) caused by the recombinant was morphologically different with that infected by parental virus (Bartha K-61), in which the former demonstrated vacuolization, and the latter showed syncytia formation (data not shown). Further experiments are needed to determine if the dissimilarity was due to the deletion of gG gene or the insertion of foreign gene. The aim for insertion of SV40 polyA sequence in the construct is to improve the stability of mRNA, facilitating mature mRNA through nuclear membrane into cytoplasm and enhancing the foreign gene expression. Using the parental vaccine virus as template to amplify homologous arms of enough length will guarantee both effective recombination frequency and safety. Theoretically, the recombination probability between PRV genome and transfer vector in cellular nucleus is about one in a thousand; the integration of Lac Z reporter gene greatly contributes to the screening of recombinant virus. Meanwhile, PCR performed with site-specific primers has demonstrated the incorporation of S1 fragment of TGEV into the PRV genome. The recombinant virus displayed the similar replicative kinetics as the parental virus, which allows us to hypothesize that the expression of S1 subunit of TGEV can be detected in the future. The transfer vector possesses significant universality due to the introduction of multiple cloning sites; therefore, it can also be utilized for generation of multifold and/or multivalent vaccines.",
