While both subtypes can simultaneously circulate during outbreaks, a few distinct genotypes of each subtype can predominate within a community. The dominant strains can also shift yearly. This shifting of viral strains, along with the waning protective immunity from natural infection, might account for frequent re-infections throughout life [38] . RSV usually causes mild and self-limited URTI in healthy older children and nonelderly adults, but certain patient populations are at risk for developing severe RSV infection, including premature or very young infants, elderly patients with comorbidities, or immunocompromised hosts [39] [40] [41] . RSV has been associated with apnea in young or preterm infants [42] and can cause severe LRTI in children including bronchiolitis, pneumonia, and acute respiratory failure [42] . Among adults infected with RSV, more than 80% are symptomatic, and lower respiratory tract signs and symptoms can occur in a quarter of the patients [43] .

In particular, RVIs are frequently associated with significant morbidity following hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) or solid organ transplantation (SOT). A number of RNA and DNA viruses can cause respiratory tract infections. This chapter focuses on the epidemiology, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, treatment and prevention of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), parainfluenza viruses (PIVs), human metapneumovirus (HMPV), influenza viruses, human coronaviruses (HCoV), and human rhinoviruses (HRV).", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "The respiratory viruses are associated with a wide range of clinical syndromes in the general population, including the common cold, pharyngitis, tracheobronchitis, laryngotracheobronchitis (croup), bronchiolitis, and pneumonia. For transplant recipients, disease spectrum similarly spans from asymptomatic or mild infections to life-threatening lower respiratory tract involvement, although severe complications tend to be more frequent. The severity and outcome of infection largely depend on the type of virus as well as host factors, including the type of transplantation and the degree of immunosuppression at the time of infection. Coinfections with other pulmonary pathogens including bacteria or fungi, e.g., Aspergillus species, Pneumocystis jiroveci, or other viruses like CMV or more than one respiratory viruses, are also common and can further complicate treatment and lead to poorer outcomes [1] [2] [3] .

Infections with RSV, influenza, HMPV, PIVs, and adenovirus have a higher risk of progression from upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) to lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) and tend to cause the most serious disease, with mortality rate of up to 40-60% among those with LRTI [6] [7] [8] [9] ; HRV and HCoV infections tend to be mild, but severe LRTI from these viruses can rarely occur [10] .
