In the United States, most generalists do not have ready access to some pre-travel vaccines (typhoid and Japanese encephalitis since they would not frequently be used in a typical primary care practice, yellow fever due to certification requirements), and most pre-travel care is provided in specialty clinics mostly staffed by infectious disease physicians.3 Trained, experienced nurses provide much of the pre-travel care in some of these clinics, and they use established protocols under physician guidance to make prescriptions for medications available to travellers.3 North American primary care providers not specifically trained in travel medicine would be more likely to limit their travel medicine advice to travelers going to settings where vaccination beyond hepatitis A is not needed.",

In addition, a prescription for an antibiotic to use in the event of bothersome travelers' diarrhea is often provided. A quinolone or azithromycin would be the most likely antibiotic used in this setting.",

With the ready availability and side effect profile of atovaquone-proguanil, however, many travel medicine clinics are increasingly prescribing this product as the mainstay of malaria protection. Concurrently, there is an emphasis on mosquito avoidance and the use of chemical repellents on exposed skin and insecticides on clothes and bednets. \u2018Stand by\u2019 malaria treatment is not commonly recommended in the United States, and rapid displacement to a site of good medical care is advised for a traveler who might have malaria.",

Notable differences, however, center on the use of both infectious disease specialists and nurses in North American pre-travel consultations rather than primary care physicians and on the non-union of aviation medicine and travel medicine in the United States. Americans' specific pre-travel interventions are also similar to those in Australia, but influenza, pneumococcal, and hepatitis A vaccines are used more widely for even at-home populations in the United States. As similarities and differences are explored and documented, it is clear that while travel medicine is truly a global specialty, the specific risks and resources vary between sites, and these affect the details of a travel medicine practice.",
