CPV-2 emerged in the late 1970s but in a few years it was replaced completely by two antigenic variants, named types 2a and 2b, that are characterized by amino acid substitutions occurring in the capsid protein (VP1/VP2) gene (Parrish et al., 1988) . While the original type 2 is no longer circulating in the dog population and is present only in vaccine formulations (Parrish et al., 1991) , its antigenic variants are distributed worldwide (Mochizuki et al., 1993; De Ybanez et al., 1995; Greenwood et al., 1996; Truyen et al., 1996 Truyen et al., , 2000 Sagazio et al., 1998; Steinel et al., 1998; Buonavoglia et al., 2000; Pereira et al., 2000; Buonavoglia et al., 2001; Martella et al., 2004 Martella et al., , 2005b Decaro et al., 2005a Decaro et al., ,c, 2006b Desario et al., 2005) .
