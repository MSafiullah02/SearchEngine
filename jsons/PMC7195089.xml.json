This is prefaced by stating that such measures would be for emergency purposes only, such as at the present time, where the US president has declared a national state of emergency.8 As COVID-19 becomes more pervasive, recommended and mandated social distancing becomes more pronounced. Several countries have initiated widespread quarantine measures to try to contain and mitigate the spread of SARS-CoV-2. During a pandemic where a national state of emergency has been declared and quarantine measures are recommended or mandated, \u201cred zone\u201d measures must be considered.2\n,\n7\n,\n8 A helpful view of a stratified approach is presented in Figure 2\n. Much of what follows relates to \u201cred zone\u201d operations. Some of the suggestion below may be most appropriate for a greater level of social distancing and quarantine than exists in the moment, and, as such, the clinician must view these as conditional recommendations to be incorporated within context-specific, evolving situations.",

The virus has been named SARS-CoV-2 and the disease it causes \u201ccoronavirus disease 2019\u201d (COVID-19).1\n,\n2 China first notified the World Health Organization of several cases of a human respiratory illness that were linked to an open seafood and livestock market in the city of Wuhan in December 2019, which appears to have originated in chrysanthemum bats.1\n,\n3 Worldwide community transmission is now evident, and it is clear that SARS-CoV-2 is a highly contagious virus.3 Cases have been identified across the globe, and on 1 cruise ship alone more than 700 infections were reported, demonstrating the high level of potential contagion.1\n,\n4 The spectrum of disease ranges from severe respiratory illness and fatality from these complications (particularly in the elderly and those with comorbidities) to asymptomatic spread,1\n,\n5\n,\n6 with the proclivity of SARS-CoV-2 for person-to-person transmission in asymptomatic individuals presenting one of the most vexing problems from a public health standpoint.1 Of note, based on data at the time of drafting this document, serious illness appears to occur in approximately 14% to 16% of cases.2\n,\n6 However, we cannot stress enough that these are fluid situations that may change hourly. Given the rapid and pervasive spread, the World Health Organization declared SARS-CoV-2 a public health emergency of international concern on January 30, 2020, and a pandemic on March 11, 2020, and on March 13, 2020, the president of the United States declared a national emergency in the United States, consistent with similar actions taken in several other countries.7\n,\n8 Information is sparse in some instances, and inconsistent in others, but there is anticipated widespread caseload across the North America and an urgent need to match the pace of the outbreak to the capacity of national health care systems to serve the needs of affected individuals in an urgent and timely manner (Figure 1). It is incumbent on each physician to monitor the day-to-day evolution of the pandemic in their region, and to be prepared to implement the recommendations of authorities and experts. The situation is changing quickly and requires a rapid, flexible, and informed response.",

However, this approach is limited by a lack of timely and accurate testing and overlap of mild COVID-19 with seasonal viral infections. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has recommended the use of personal protective equipment by health care workers including standard, contact, and airborne precautions and the use of eye protection. This means health care workers caring for a patient with suspected COVID-19 should wear a gown, gloves, and either an N95 respirator plus face shield and goggles or a powered air-purifying respirator; however, the CDC also notes that a face mask may be substituted for an N95 respirator if one is not available. At present a negative pressure room may be reserved for patients undergoing aerosol-generating procedures.1\n,\n2 As is with any of this information, this is fluid and may continue to change. Commonsense strategies are important in controlling the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and are detailed in Table E1 in this article's Online Repository at www.jaci-inpractice.org.2\n,\n11 During the COVID-19 pandemic the concept of social distancing has also been incorporated into prevention strategies, with the CDC recommending avoiding close contact (<6 ft).2\n,\n11\n",

Asthma is a major health problem around the globe.30 Because SARS-CoV-2 is a respiratory pathogen, it is important to know what risk patients with asthma have in this time of a COVID-19 pandemic. There are relatively few data at this time to demonstrate a specific increased risk for COVID-19 from asthma, or an increased disease pathology in patients with asthma infected with SARS-CoV-2. However, this association could evolve. Early published data from China noted that asthma was not a strong risk factor for severe COVID-19 disease. One study of 140 patients with COVID-19 found none with asthma,31 and in a larger study of 1099 hospitalized patients, asthma was not described.32 In this larger study, chronic obstructive lung disease (COPD) was noted in patients hospitalized with COVID-19, but the rate of patients with COPD who had COVID-19 (1.1%) was lower than the rate of COPD in the general Chinese population (which is at least 10%).33 Data from Korea also indicate that asthma is not a relevant comorbidity.10 Together these data suggest that the risk of severe COVID-19 may not be dramatically elevated in those with asthma or COPD. However, these data are based on hospitalized patients and may have significant limitations due to selection and reporting bias. It is also important to note that asthma appears underdiagnosed and underreported in China, with an estimated prevalence of only 4.2%.34 The actual risk of disease in those with asthma or COPD within the broader Chinese population or those of non-Chinese background is not known, and may evolve with additional data reporting.",

Currently, the World Health Organization and the CDC recommend that in the general population with COVID-19, systemic corticosteroids should be avoided because of a potential for prolonged viral replication that was observed in patients with Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus. However, there is also acknowledgment that there may be a role for systemic corticosteroids when indicated for other reasons, such as septic shock.2\n,\n37, 38, 39 For example, in a study of 309 intensive care unit patients with Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, 151 received corticosteroids acutely, and those who received corticosteroids were more likely to receive mechanical ventilation (93.4% vs 76.6%; P < .0001), had higher 90-day crude mortality (74.2% vs 57.6%; P = .002), and had delayed viral clearance. Of note, mortality rates did not differ by corticosteroid use when adjusted by time-varying confounders.38 Approximately 20% to 30% of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 have pneumonia and may require intensive care for respiratory support2\n,\n39; thus, it is important to appreciate that corticosteroids may have distinct roles in treating lung injury versus airway inflammation. Recently, Russel et al40 summarized current evidence in relation to the use of corticosteroids for mitigating lung injury from coronaviruses and concluded that there is likely to be a lack of efficacy in COVID-19 lung injury.",

In fact, it may be more likely that a patient with asthma would have an exacerbation from other causes, including seasonal pollen exposure or a virus other than SARS-CoV-2 if they stopped regular use of indicated controller therapy based on best evidence. An exacerbation could require them to enter the health care system, which would put them at increased risk of being exposed to SARS-CoV-2 during the current pandemic.

Many patients with food allergy, eosinophilic esophagitis, and anaphylaxis are generally healthy, with the exception of other allergic comorbidities such as asthma, allergic rhinitis, or eczema. With limited exception, most of the care of these conditions would reasonably qualify under temporarily nonessential ambulatory elective services, which could be delayed or deferred in the short- to intermediate-term (a few weeks to even a few months) with no anticipated significant serious untoward effects. Most of the care for patients with these conditions could forego any face-to-face visits in the short-term, and if necessary be addressed through virtual care until the pandemic subsides. Many such patients could likely forego any care in this time interval. When considering what is critically necessary, routine food allergy follow-up visits and many new referrals should be considered to fall under a more elective category, where such visits could be handled via telehealth, potentially. Food challenges, with limited exceptions, would also follow suit. In the setting of a pandemic with quarantine measures, unless there is a critical acute nutritional need for introduction of a key nutrient, it is likely that all food challenges would be deferred. Research visits for ongoing study protocols and food allergy immunotherapy visits for initiation and escalation could also be delayed, with the possible exception of food challenge visits at the end of a study interval where delay would risk influencing the primary/secondary outcomes. However, sponsors are likely issuing their own directives for handling this, which should be followed unless the local facility issues guidance that supersedes that of the sponsor with regard to access to space or staff. Where possible, it is recommended that there be planning to provide telehealth visits without testing to provide essential diagnostic management and make medication adjustments, or a plan to address this through phone triage.",
