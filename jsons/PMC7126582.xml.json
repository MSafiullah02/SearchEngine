            "text": "Recently, graphical techniques have emerged as a powerful tool for the visualization and analysis of complicated biological systems. These methods can provide an intuitive picture and help people gain useful insights. Many graphical approaches have also been used to deal with a wide variety of biological problems. For instance, various graphic schemes have been successfully used to study enzyme-catalyzed system (King and Altman, 1956; Chou et al., 1979; Chou, 1980; Chou and Forsen, 1980, Chou and Forsen, 1981; Chou and Liu, 1981; Cornish-Bowden, 1979; Myers and Palmer, 1985; Zhou and Deng, 1984; Chou, 1989, Chou, 1990; Lin and Neet, 1990; Kuzmic et al., 1992; Andraos, 2008), protein folding kinetics (Chou, 1990, Chou, 1993), condon usage (Chou and Zhang, 1992; Zhang and Chou, 1994), HIV reverse transcriptase inhibition mechanisms (see Althaus et al., 1993a, Althaus et al., 1993b, Althaus et al., 1993c, as well as a review article, Chou et al., 1994), and base frequency distribution in the anti-sense strands (Chou et al., 1996). Recently, the images of cellular automata were also used to represent biological sequences (Xiao et al., 2005a, Xiao et al., 2005b), predict protein subcellular location (Xiao et al., 2006a, Xiao et al., 2006b), investigate HBV virus gene missense mutation (Xiao et al., 2005a, Xiao et al., 2005b) and HBV viral infections (Xiao et al., 2006a, Xiao et al., 2006b), predicting protein structural classes (Xiao et al., 2008) and G-protein-coupled receptor functional classes (Xiao et al., 2009), as well as analyze the fingerprint of SARS coronavirus (Wang et al., 2005; Gao et al., 2006). Graphic approaches have been also used recently to examine the similarities/dissimilarities among the coding sequences of different species (Qi et al., 2007; Qi and Qi, 2007, Qi and Qi, 2009; Qi and Fan, 2007; Yao et al., 2006), analyze the network structure of the amino acid metabolism (Shikata et al., 2007), and study cellular signaling networks (Diao et al., 2007).",

In Sorimachi and Okayasu (2004), 23 eubacteria was classified (11 Gram-positive and 12 Gram-negative eubacteria) into two groups, \u201cS-Type\u201d represented by Staphylococcus aureus and \u201cE-Type\u201d represented by Escherichia coli, based on their patterns of amino acid compositions by radar charts determined from the complete genome.

Here, we firstly obtain a 16-dimension vector set of dual nucleotides by PN-curve from the complete genome of organism. Each vector of the set corresponds to a single gene of genome.

Concentration of dots of them is mainly in the left dot-clusters and (ii) the other consists of the following, L. monocytogenes, C. jejuni, M. pulmonis, H. pylori J99, H. influenzae, M. genitalium and H. pylori 26695. Concentration of dots of these bacteria is mainly in the right dot-clusters. Similarly, \u201cE-Type\u201d can be also classified into two subgroups. The first subgroup includes those bacteria whose dots are classified into two clusters. They are E. coli, S. typhi, V. cholerae and Y. pestis. Concentration of the dots of the second is mainly one dot-cluster. They are M. tuberculosis, M. leprae, N. meningitides, T. pallidum, M. pneumoniae and U. urealyticum, respectively. The above results show that bacteria in Table 1 are grouped into two classes: S. aureus \u201cS-Type\u201d and E. coli \u201cE-Type\u201d, based on their genomic structures. As Okayasu and Sorimachi (2009) reported both types \u201cS-Type\u201d and \u201cE-Type\u201d, the above species were classified further into their subgroups based on amino acid compositions or codon usages. Similar results have also been obtained by Sorimachi and Okayasu (2004).",

Similarly, we also classified these eubacteria into two groups, \u201cS-Type\u201d and \u201cE-Type\u201d, according to particular dot-cluster derived from complete genomes data by PCA. Compared with the research results of Sorimachi and Okayasu, our results show some diversity in three eubacteria: H. influenzae, M. pneumoniae and U. urealyticum. Here, H. influenzae belong to \u201cS-Type\u201d while M. pneumoniae and U. urealyticum are \u201cE-Type\u201d. We do not think that the diversity imply some failure in our approach or Sorimachi and Okayasu's scheme. The proportion of diversity is low, only 13%. Looked by statistics viewpoint, the diversity is acceptable.",

The more similar the structures of dot-cluster are the more similar the organisms are.

Closely observing Fig. 1, we find that in \u201cS-Type\u201d the more similar species groups are the following: S. aureus Mu50, S. pyogenes M1 and B. subtilis; L. monocytogenes, H. pylori J99, H. influenzae and H. pylori 26695.
