In this study we performed genome-wide microarray analyses of the expression patterns of mouse hepatitis coronavirus (MHV)infected cells. At the time of MHV-induced host translational shutoff, downregulation of numerous mRNAs, many of which encode protein translationrelated factors, was observed. This downregulation, which is reminiscent of a cellular stress response, was dependent on viral replication and caused by mRNA decay. Concomitantly, phosphorylation of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2a was increased in MHV-infected cells. In addition, stress granules and processing bodies appeared, which are sites for mRNA stalling and degradation respectively. We propose that MHV replication induces host translational shutoff by triggering an integrated stress response. However, MHV replication per se does not appear to benefit from the inhibition of host protein synthesis, at least in vitro, since viral replication was not negatively affected but rather enhanced in cells with impaired translational shutoff.",

CoVs replicate entirely within the cytoplasm of their host cells, where they produce a nested set of (sub)genomic mRNAs, containing identical 5\u2032-leader sequences and coterminal 3\u2032-ends (Pasternak et al., 2006) .

Raaben and C. A. M. de Haan, unpubl. results) . The mechanism by which this occurs and how CoVs themselves escape from it is not known. As the leader sequence, present on all viral mRNAs, enhances translation in MHV-infected cells, it has been suggested that the apparent downregulation of host protein synthesis is not primarily due to inhibition of translation . On the other hand, the reduced host mRNA translation in MHV-infected cells has also been associated with a decrease in the number and size of polysomes and an increase of inactive single 80S ribosomes (Hilton et al., 1986) , and with cleavage of 28S ribosomal RNA (Banerjee et al., 2000) . Furthermore, it has been suggested that a decline in steady-state levels, found for some host cell mRNAs, contributes to the downregulation of host protein translation (Hilton et al., 1986; Kyuwa et al., 1994; Tahara et al., 1994) . More recently, the expression of the SARS-CoV non-structural protein 1 (nsp1) was reported to induce mRNA degradation and inhibition of host protein synthesis (Kamitani et al., 2006) .",

            "text": "Host shutoff is not restricted to virus infected cells, but is induced by various stress stimuli (Brostrom and Brostrom, 1998) . For example, cells deprived of nutrients inhibit protein synthesis to conserve amino acids for essential metabolic processes. In addition, cells also shut down protein synthesis in response to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, heat and oxidative stress. These different stress stimuli induce translational shutoff via the increased phosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF)2a (de Haro et al., 1996) . In mammalian cells there are at least four eIF2a kinases, including GCN2, PKR, PERK and HRI, which are activated by amino acid starvation, double stranded RNA, ER stress and haem depletion, respectively (Berlanga et al., 1999; Harding et al., 1999; Kaufman, 2000; Lu et al., 2001) . Upon phosphorylation of eIF2a, cytoplasmic structures containing stalled translational preinitiation complexes, frequently referred to as stress granules (SGs), are formed. The actual formation of SGs occurs upon aggregation of the RNA binding proteins TIA-1 (T-cell internal antigen-1) and TIAR (TIA-1-related protein) (Kedersha et al., 1999) . SGs are thought to recruit specific mRNA transcripts, such as 'housekeeping' protein encoding mRNAs, to regulate their translation in adaptation to altered conditions . SGs are also referred to as triage centres because they sort mRNAs for either storage, reinitiation of translation, or degradation (Anderson and Kedersha, 2006) .",

However, at 6 h post infection, a significant number of genes appeared to be altered in their expression (Fig. 2B ). Besides the apparent upregulation of several mRNAs, a large number of mRNAs (678) was significantly downregulated upon infection. This set of mRNAs is represented by the yellow dots in the different panels of Fig. 2 . Actinomycin D (ActD), an inhibitor of cellular transcription but not of CoV replication (Robb and Bond, 1979; Lai et al., 1981) , was used to establish whether the observed mRNA downregulation was the result of a transcriptional or a post-transcriptional mechanism. Treatment of both infected and uninfected cells with ActD, did not affect the downregulation of mRNAs, indicating that the observed decrease is the result of posttranscriptional mRNA degradation (Fig. 2C) . To study the specificity of this virus-induced mRNA degradation, the effect of ActD treatment was analysed in the absence of a viral infection. Treatment of cells with ActD, or with other transcriptional inhibitors, induces the downregulation of short-lived mRNAs (Cheadle et al., 2005) . Indeed, downregulation of many mRNAs was observed in ActD-treated cells when compared with mock-treated cells (Fig. 2D ).",

As approximately 20% of the viral RNA present in the LR7 cells at 6 h post infection was not removed by the oligo capture technique (M. Raaben and C. A. M. de Haan, unpubl. results), a large number of the mRNAs upregulated in the presence of ActD are likely to result from cross hybridization of the remaining viral RNA. Indeed, this was confirmed for some hits using quantitative RT-PCR analysis (data not shown). However, we cannot exclude that some of these hits might also result from increased mRNA stability upon virus infection, a subject of further research. In order to exclude (potential) false-positive hits, the genelists of the experiments performed in the absence or presence of ActD were compared. As a result, 243 genes were excluded from the analysis since they were upregulated under both experimental conditions, leaving 40 genes that were specifically upregulated at the transcriptional level in MHV-infected LR7 cells at 6 h post infection. The genes identified were clustered according to their GO terms for biological processes (see Supplementary Table S2 ). Out of the 40 genes, we could annotate 29 genes. Examples of genes of which the expression was induced were those encoding inflammatory cytokines (Cxcl1, Cxcl2), a marker of the unfolded protein response (Herpud1), and dual specificity phosphatase 1 (Dusp1). In addition, several genes involved in regulation of transcription were differentially expressed.

Recently, SGs have been associated with the initiation of host translational shutoff during stress. A key aspect in the formation of these cytoplasmic structures, which contain stalled translation preinitiation complexes, is the phosphorylation of the translation initiation factor eIF2a at serine 51, which results in the aggregation of the mRNA binding proteins TIA-1 and TIAR, both markers for SGs (Kedersha et al., 1999; Kedersha et al., 2005) . Phosphorylation of eIF2a was analysed in MHV-infected LR7 cells at 4 and 6 h post infection, i.e. before and at the time of host translational shutoff, respectively (Fig. 3A) . Mock-infected cells and cells treated for 30 min with 0.5 mM sodium arsenite, were taken along as controls. Sodium arsenite has been shown to induce phosphorylation of eIF2a at serine 51 (McEwen et al., 2005) . The expression levels and phosphorylation status of eIF2a in all samples were visualized by immunoblotting using antibodies against total eIF2a and phosphorylated eIF2a (eIF2aP) respectively. Quantitative analysis revealed that the levels of phosphorylated eIF2a, corrected for the total amount of eIF2a, in MHVinfected cells were reproducibly~2.5-fold higher at 6 h post infection compared with mock-infected cells, while at 4 h post infection no increase could be observed. Subsequently, we investigated whether SGs were formed in LR7 cells upon MHV infection. As a positive control, LR7 cells were incubated with sodium arsenite as described above. The cells were fixed at the indicated time points post infection, and processed for immunofluorescence using anti-TIAR antibodies. Indeed, cytoplasmic foci containing TIAR, representing SGs, could be detected at the time of increased eIF2a phosphorylation and host translational shutoff (at 6 h post infection), but hardly or not at 4 h post infection (Fig. 3B ). SGs were observed both in single cells and in syncytia.",

            "text": "To investigate to what extent the cellular stress response and the host translational shutoff affects MHV infection, we studied replication in MEFs expressing a mutant form of eIF2a (eIF2aS51A) that cannot be phosphorylated at serine 51 (Scheuner et al., 2001) . Host translational shutoff is not observed in these cells during stress or alphavirus infection (Scheuner et al., 2001; McInerney et al., 2005) . In addition, replication was monitored in TIA-1 -/and TIAR -/-MEFs. These MEFs have been demonstrated to exhibit impaired SG assembly, as well as delayed host translational shutoff after virus infections (Gilks et al., 2004; McInerney et al., 2005) . Unfortunately, host translational shutoff could not be studied by metabolic labelling of the cells upon infection with MHV, as only 10-20% of the MEF cells in a dish could be infected after a high multiplicity infection with MHV (data not shown). Nevertheless, viral replication in the MEF cells was monitored, not by determining the production of infectious virions, but by following the expression of a reporter gene after infection with MHV-EFLM, which carries the firefly luciferase (FL) in an MHV-A59 background. FL expressed by MHV has been shown to be a reliable measure for virus replication (de Haan et al., 2005) . The intracellular FL levels were determined at different time points post infection and normalized for the number of infected cells, which differed slightly between the MEF cell lines. Clearly, MHV replication was enhanced in the eIF2aS51A-expressing cells as compared with the wild-type eIF2aexpressing cells (Fig. 4A) . Similarly, replication was also enhanced in the TIAR -/cells, while MHV replicated to approximately the same extent in the TIA-1 -/and wildtype MEF cells (Fig. 4B) . Overall, the results show that replication of MHV is not negatively affected but rather enhanced in cells with impaired host translational shutoff.",

For MHV it was shown already in the eighties that infection induces host translational shutoff, while maintaining its own protein synthesis (Rottier et al., 1981; Siddell et al., 1981; Hilton et al., 1986) . However, the cellular processes underlying MHVinduced inhibition of host protein synthesis remained largely unknown. We now show that this inhibition coincides with degradation of numerous mRNAs, many of which encode protein translation-related factors. In addition, infection with MHV results in increased phosphorylation of eIF2a and in the formation of SGs and P bodies, Fig. 3 . MHV induces phosphorylation of eIF2a at Ser51, and the subsequent formation of SGs and P bodies. A. The phosphorylation state of eIF2a in MHV-infected LR7 cells at 4 and 6 h post infection (indicated by 4 and 6) or after mock infection was determined by Western blotting using eIF2aP-specific antibodies (top) and related to total eIF2a levels by stripping and reprobing of the membrane (bottom). The fold change differences between MHV-infected and mock-infected cells are indicated above each lane. As a positive control, LR7 cells were treated with 0.5 mM sodium arsenite (indicated as S.A.) for 30 min. This experiment was repeated twice with similar results. B. LR7 cells were mock-infected, treated with S.A. for 30 min, or infected with MHV. Cells were fixed and processed for immunofluorescence using TIAR (aTIAR) and GW182 (aGW182) antibodies according to Experimental procedures. MHV-infected cells were fixed at 4 and 6 h post infection (indicated by 4 and 6). Representative images are shown for each condition. The scaled bar corresponds to 20 mM.",

Relatively few genes (40) were identified, of which transcription was enhanced (see Supplementary data). Among these were genes encoding inflammatory cytokines (Cxcl1 and Cxcl2) and proteins associated with cellular transcription. The induction of Dusp1, which plays an important role as a protein phosphatase in the cellular response to stress (Keyse and Emslie, 1992; Ma and Hendershot, 2004 ) and of Herpud1, which is a marker of the unfolded protein response (Keyse and Emslie, 1992; Ma and Hendershot, 2004) , suggests that cells infected with MHV elicit a stress response. Several of these upregulated gene transcripts have also been identified in a gene expression profiling study of MHV-infected cells using a different microarray platform (Versteeg et al., 2006) . Perhaps more striking is the decline of a large number of mRNAs at the time of host translational shutoff (see Supplementary data). This reduction was shown to be dependent on viral replication and to be caused by mRNA degradation, because it was also observed in the presence of the cellular transcription inhibitor ActD. Transcriptional inhibition results in a fast degradation of short-lived mRNAs, especially those containing AU-rich elements (AREs) in their 3\u2032 UTRs (Tebo et al., 2003) . However, ActD treatment itself resulted in a different expression profile as compared with MHV infection, indicating that MHV infection does not simply result in increased instability of short-lived mRNAs.

In agreement with our results, mRNA decay was demonstrated to be the main cause of the observed downregulation of these mRNA levels (Grigull et al., 2004) . These results indicate that CoV infection elicits a cellular response, which resembles the reaction of yeast cells upon environmental stress. Recently, expression of the SARS-CoV nsp1 has been shown to result in degradation of several host mRNAs and in translational shutoff (Kamitani et al., 2006) . A direct role for nsp1 in mRNA degradation might explain the observed effects, even though nsp1 has no sequence similarities with any known RNases, and is only poorly conserved among CoVs. Alternatively, expression of the SARS-CoV nsp1 might induce a cellular stress response resulting in mRNA decay and in inhibition of protein synthesis. In agreement herewith, others showed that expression of SARS-CoV nsp1 induced activation of the stress-related transcription factor NF-kB and chemokine upregulation (Law et al., 2007) .",

Similarly, the induction of SGs has recently also been demonstrated after infection with reovirus (Smith et al., 2006 ), Semliki Forest virus (McInerney et al., 2005 and herpes simplex virus type 1 (Esclatine et al., 2004) , all of which are able to induce host translational shutoff.",

P bodies were formed at the time of mRNA decay, suggesting that these structures play a role in the degradation of the host transcripts. Whether also viral mRNAs localize to P bodies and are subsequently degraded remains to be established. We cannot exclude that other RNA decay pathways may be induced upon infection with MHV as well. However, the interferon-depended 2\u2032,5\u2032oligoadenylate synthetase pathway (Clemens, 2005) is not likely to play a major role in MHV-infected cells, because no prominent upregulation of interferon-mediated gene transcription was observed, which is consistent with the results of others (Banerjee et al., 2000; Versteeg et al., 2006) .

On the other hand, as the coronaviral mRNAs are structurally equivalent to the host mRNAs, viral protein synthesis might also be impaired, even though viral protein synthesis is still robust after host translational shutoff. The results obtained with the host translational shutoff-deficient (eIF2aS51A) MEF cells show that in the absence of phosphorylatable eIF2a MHV replication is not negatively affected. Thus, the stress response induced upon infection with MHV, which results in the phosphorylation of eIF2a and the subsequent inhibition of protein synthesis, does not appear to be beneficial for MHV replication in vitro. This is in contrast to reoviruses, replication of which has been demonstrated to be facilitated by the induced cellular stress response and eIF2a phosphorylation (Smith et al., 2006) . Our conclusions are corroborated by the results obtained with the TIA-1 -/and TIAR -/-MEFs, which exhibit impaired SG assembly and host translational shutoff, and in which MHV replication was also not negatively affected but, rather, enhanced. Similar results, using the same TIA-1 -/and TIAR -/-MEFs, were previously obtained for the replication of vesicular stomatitis virus, Sindbis virus and herpes simplex virus type 1, but not for West Nile virus (Li et al., 2002) . The latter virus was found to require TIA-1 and TIAR binding to viral RNA for efficient replication. The importance of the CoV-induced cellular stress response and the host translational shutoff for virus replication in vivo remains to be established.",

Several factors are likely to play a role in the CoV 'escape' from translational inhibition. Previously it has been reported that the leader sequence present at the 5\u2032-end of all MHV encoded mRNAs mediates their preferential translation (Tahara et al., 1993; . However, the precise mechanism by which this is established is still unknown. The exponential increase in the abundance of viral mRNAs during infection is also likely to contribute to a preferential translation of these mRNAs, simply as a result of increasing abundance in the competition for the limited translational machinery. We have calculated that at 6 h post infection up to 40% of all mRNAs in the cell is virus-encoded. Furthermore, the downregulation of many mRNAs encoding protein translation-related factors, probably via the induction of P bodies, is also likely to increase the success of the viral mRNAs in their competition with the host-encoded mRNAs.",

After blocking with PBS containing 5% FCS, TIAR or GW182 were detected using a rabbit polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnologies) or a monoclonal antibody (Abcam) respectively. Subsequently, affinity-purified goat antirabbit or donkey anti-mouse secondary antibodies conjugated to Cy3 were used for visualization. The cells were mounted with FluorSave Reagent (Calbiochem) and fluorescence was viewed with a Leica TCS SP confocal microscope.",
