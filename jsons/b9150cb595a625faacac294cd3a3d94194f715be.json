            "text": "We assess the efficacy of spatially targeted lockdown or mass-testing and case-isolation in individual communities, as a compliment to contact-tracing and social-distancing, for containing SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks. Using the UK as a case study, we construct a stochastic branching process model for the virus transmission, embedded on a network interaction model encoding mobility patterns in the UK. The network model is based on commuter data from the 2011 census, a catchment area model for schools, and a phenomenological model for mobility and interactions outside of work, school, and the home. We show that for outbreak scenarios where contact-tracing and moderate social distancing alone provide suppression but do not contain the spread, targeted lockdowns or mass-testing interventions at the level of individual communities (with just a few thousand inhabitants) can be effective at containing outbreaks. For spatially targeted mass-testing, a moderate increase in testing capacity would be required (typically < 40000 additional tests per day), while for local lockdowns we find that only a small fraction (typically < 0.1%) of the population needs to be locked down at any one time (assuming that one third of transmission occurs in the home, at work or school, and out in the wider community respectively). The efficacy of spatially targeted interventions is contingent on an appreciable fraction of transmission events occurring within (relative to across) communities. Confirming the efficacy of community-level interventions therefore calls for detailed investigation of spatial transmission patterns for SARS-CoV-2, accounting for sub-community-scale transmission dynamics, and changes in mobility patterns due to the presence of other containment measures (such as social distancing and travel restrictions).",

In particular, we note that the efficacy of spatially targeted interventions are sensitive to the relative proportions of intra-versus inter-community transmission (for a given definition of community boundaries), which in turn is sensitive to the assumptions about the transmission dynamics across different contexts. Whilst the assumptions made here about transmission across contexts are motivated, we are currently updating our model to make the estimated inter-and intra-community transmission rates as robust as possible, as well as running a comprehensive suite of sensitivity tests and different outbreak scenarios. : medRxiv preprint 2 We split the UK into 'Middle Super Output Areas' (MSOAs) -communities with between five and sixteen thousand inhabitants.",

Despite containment efforts, the virus spread across the globe, resulting in a global pandemic with over 2.5 million confirmed cases and 170, 000 deaths worldwide as of 23 April 2020. In order to contain or mitigate the spread of the virus, countries have deployed various combinations of measures, including tracing and isolation of contacts, social-distancing, and in many cases stringent lockdowns 5, 6 . The heterogeneity of the implemented strategies across countries reflects the fact that the optimal approach is unknown, and likely context dependent.",

            "text": "The efficacy of contact-tracing as a containment strategy is dependent of four key factors: the proportion of transmission that occurs before symptom onset (and from asymptomatic cases) [15] [16] [17] , the basic reproduction number 16, 17 (R 0 ), the delay from symptom onset to isolation 14, 16, 17 , and the fraction of contacts that are successfully traced and quarantined or isolated 14, [16] [17] [18] . SARS-CoV-2 presents a particular challenge due to its relatively high reproduction number (R 0 3 \u2212 4 5, 19, 20 ) , significant pre-symptomatic 21, 22 and possibly asymptomatic 23, 24 transmission. This puts onerous requirements on any digital (or other) contact-tracing effort to trace a high fraction of contacts, and isolate them promptly. It is estimated that for the SARS-CoV-2 pathogen, contact-tracing alone is only able to achieve containment with around 80% of contacts traced 14, 17 , rapid isolation and/or quarantining of large numbers of traced contacts who do not yet show any symptoms 14, 18 , and a modest number of imported cases 17 . Even for countries with high smartphone ownership, this is likely unrealistic for digital contact tracing alone; in the UK for example, 80% of adults own a smartphone 25 , which naively puts an upper limit of 64% 1 on the number of contacts traced through digital contact tracing (even if app adoption was mandatory). Digital contact tracing is hence unlikely to be enough to achieve containment on its own, and additional measures will be necessary, including (some combination of) supplementary manual contact tracing, social distancing measures and travel restrictions, isolation of individual households, schools, or workplaces, mass testing 26 , and possibly community-level interventions 27 , etc.",

For transmission that occurs in the community and in the workplace, the intra-community transmission constitutes 10 \u2212 20%, while in schools intra-community transmission accounts for \u223c20-40% of the total. This means that the community and workplace interaction terms describe high levels of mixing, school interactions somewhat less so, and home interactions are entirely intra-community. The gravity model for community interactions (and to a lesser extent, the commuter data) ensures that the distribution of transmission distances has a heavy-tail leading to plausible levels of long-range transmission; 5% of transmission events occur over 100km, 2% over 200km and 1% over 250km.",

Summary statistics of simulated outbreaks for two cases: contact-tracing and modest social distancing only (baseline), and with the addition of targeted two-week lockdowns at the communuty-level. 1000 outbreaks are simulated for each of the two cases. (A) The proportion of simulated outbreaks that are terminated for each of the three stopping conditions: the outbreak is contained within 8 months (i.e. zero active infections at 8 months), the outbreak is uncontrolled within 8 months (i.e. active infections at 8 months exceeds the ten thousand case limit), and the outbreak is neither contained nor uncontrolled within 8 months (i.e., fewer than ten thousand active infections at eight months but the outbreak is ongoing). (B) The maximum number of people who are in lockdown at any one time in the targeted two-week lockdown protocol. (C) Effective reproductive number of outbreaks for the baseline case. (D) Effective reproductive number of outbreaks when targeted two-week lockdown is used in conjunction with the baseline interventions.",

In this proof-of-concept we used simple (and a priori fixed) community definitions and a somewhat crude intervention threshold. Optimal community definitions could involve generating community boundaries with the goal in mind, ie., such that the intra-community transmission is sufficiently high that local interventions should be effective. Community boundaries also need not be static, and could be updated as mobility patterns change under changing social distancing (and other) measures. Intervention thresholds too should take into account the 'nowcast' infection surface, and the interventions themselves (eg., which communities are targeted at a given time) may be a function of their inter-connectedness due to mobility patterns.",

The interplay between these sub-community-scale factors and the mobility model should constrain the relative fraction of intra-community transmission with greater confidence, allowing for stronger statements on the efficacy of community-level intervention measures. We are also exploring the use of social network data 45 for improving the interaction model (in particular, mobility patterns outside of work, school and household contexts).",
