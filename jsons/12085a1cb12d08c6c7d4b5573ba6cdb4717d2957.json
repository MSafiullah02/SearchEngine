            "text": "For the OLS regression, * P<0.01, ** P<0.001. Outcome is overall preparedness, on a 0 to 9 scale. The logistic regression specification, used in the manuscript, represents fulfilling 5 or more (at least half) of items. The ordinary least squares specification uses overall preparedness as a continuous outcome and includes P-values to denote statistical significance. The multinomial logistic regression examines three categories of preparedness (low (0-3 items), medium (4-6 items), and high (7-9 items)), with low as the reference category. For each coefficient, there are two odds ratios corresponding to level 2 versus level 1 (i.e., medium versus low) and level 3 versus level 1 (i.e., high versus low). Abbreviations: adjusted odds ratio (aOR), confidence interval (CI). Preparedness is defined by fulfilling at least half of items. The study sample is limited to participants who responded to the 9 questions on specific preparedness items. To adjust for possible nonresponse bias, this replicates Table 2 from the manuscript using a logistic regression weighting method. Notes: Pearson correlation coefficients. P-values are not provided because with such a large sample, many associations are statistically significant although not meaningful qualitatively.",
