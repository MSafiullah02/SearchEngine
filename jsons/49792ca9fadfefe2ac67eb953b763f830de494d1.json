As of May 10, 2020, it has caused an outbreak with more than 41,78,000 confirmed infections and more than 2,83,000 reported deaths globally. Due to the unavailability of an effective treatment (or vaccine) and insufficient evidence regarding the transmission mechanism of the epidemic, the world population is currently in a vulnerable position. The daily cases data sets of COVID-19 for profoundly affected countries represent a stochastic process comprised of deterministic and stochastic components. This study proposes an integrated deterministic-stochastic approach to predict the long-term trajectories of the COVID-19 cases for Italy and Spain. The deterministic component of the daily-cases univariate time-series is assessed by an extended SIR (SIRCX) model whereas its stochastic component is modeled using an autoregressive (AR) time series model. The proposed integrated SIRCX-AR (ISA) approach based on two operationally distinct modeling paradigms utilizes the superiority of both the deterministic SIRCX and stochastic AR models to find the long-term trajectories of the epidemic curves. Experimental analysis based on the proposed ISA model suggest that the estimated numbers of cases in Italy and Spain between ), respectively. Additionally, the expected number daily cases on 09 July, 2020 for Italy and Spain are estimated to be 30 (0-183) and 92 (0-602), respectively. These log-term forecasts for Italy and Spain of the coming outbreaks will be very useful for the effective allocation of health care resources to mitigate COVID-19.",

In previous studies, mathematical modeling approaches (e.g. SIR and SEIR models) (13; 11) performed more effectively for predicting the long-term trajectories of the epidemic whereas stochastic forecasting models (classical ARIMA and Wavelet-based forecasting model) (4) gave superior real-time short-term forecasts for some profoundly affected countries. However, a close look at the daily cases time series data sets of confirmed COVID-19 cases for different countries exhibits both the deterministic trend and stochastic behavior in the series. This indicates that the predictions of long-term trajectories of COVID-19 daily cases can be greatly improved by integrating both the deterministic and stochastic approaches. This study attempts to blend deterministic and stochastic methods for studying the long term trajectories of COVID-19 cases for Italy and Spain.",

The underlying characteristics of the epidemic curves show both the deterministic and stochastic nature that intrigued the need for developing an integrated deterministic-stochastic model to forecast the long-term trajectories of COVID-19 cases. In the first stage of the model, an extended version of SIR model (SIRCX) is built that preserves the characteristic of the deterministic process in the long run. The deterministic SIRCX model leaves a certain part of the examined time series unexplained and we overcome these uncertainties with the help of a stochastic model. In the second stage of the integrated approach, a stochastic autoregressive (AR) model is applied to analyze the uncertain behavior of the residuals produced by the compartmental SIRCX model. This newly introduced integrated SIRCX-AR model, we call it as ISA model, exploits the benefits of two methodologically contrasting paradigms and overcome their individual shortcomings. The proposed ISA model preserves both the long-term and short-term characteristics of the current pandemic time series when applied to the daily confirmed cases data sets of Italy and Spain. This combined approach is also useful for explaining complex autocorrelation structures in the COVID-19 time-series data and reduce the inductive bias and variances of the individual models from a modeler's point of view. Besides that, we estimate the basic reproduction number, expected total cases after one month and expected daily cases after two months. In the absence of vaccines or antiviral drugs for COVID-19, these estimates will provide an insight into the resource allocations for Italy and Spain to keep this epidemic under control.",

The long term memory property of a time series is measured using the Hurst exponent (HE). The value of HE lying between 0.5 and 1 proves that the series is sufficiently long. To check the HE for the given data sets, we use 'pracma' package in R statistical software. For daily cases data of Spain the value of HE is 0.775 and 0.753 for Italy. Thus, it is confirmed that the data sets have long-term memory. Next, we test if there are deterministic terms in the daily cases data sets using seasonal Mann-Kendall (M-K) trend test with an R package 'Kendall'. M-K test is a nonparametric test where the alternative hypothesis corresponds to the existence of a deterministic trend. The two-sided p-value of 0.808 for the series of Italy and 0.856 for the Spain data set confirmed that there exists trends (deterministic nature) in the data.

Using the 'best' fitted AR models, two month ahead mean forecasts of the residuals are generated for Italy and Spain along with the confidence intervals. Finally, the ODE generated forecasts and AR-based residual forecasts were added together to get the final forecasts. The ODE model predictions and ISA model forecasts are then compared using four widely used goodness-of-fit metrics, namely mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), symmetric MAPE (SMAPE), root mean squared error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE). By convention, the models with lower values of goodness-of-fit metrics are capable of giving better forecasts. The formulae to evaluate these performance metrics are as follows: 7 All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.",

We predicted two month ahead forecasts (long-term) for both Spain and Italy to understand the future outbreaks of the pandemic for Italy and Spain. The plots of actual vs predicted values along with the long-term forecast values are given in Figure 4 . Figure 4 depicts that the proposed ISA approach fitted the training data more adequately in comparison with the ODEbased SIRCX model. The band-width presented in Figure 4 shows slow decay in number of future COVID-19 outbreaks in Italy and Spain. The predicted vs actual forecasts suggest that the integrated approach are more accurate than simply relying on the compartmental model.

The availability of limited data and inadequate epidemiological knowledge make the problem more challenging. Mathematical and statistical forecasting models always try to give insightful information about the future of COVID-19 spread in the community. In this study, we proposed an integrated deterministic-stochastic framework for predicting the long-term trajectories of COVID-19 cases in two profoundly affected countries, namely Italy and Spain. This idea of combining two contrasting paradigms (deterministic and stochastic models) presented in this study is fairly new. We assumed that the time-dependent stochastic process consists of both the deterministic and stochastic components and examined it for the daily cases data sets of COVID-19. The proposed ISA model outperformed the individual SIRCX model in terms of four performance metrics on the training data. Two month-ahead forecasts are provided for Italy and Spain. The estimated numbers of cases in Italy and Spain from 11 May, 2020 to 09 June, 2020 are found to be 10982 (6383-15582) and 13731 (3395-29013), respectively. Furthermore, the expected number of daily cases on 60 th day (09 July, 2020) for Italy and Spain are estimated to be 30 (0-183) and 92 (0-602), respectively. These results indicate that COVID-19 will pose less threat on Italy and Spain in near future. However, the current mitigation and control interventions should be maintained as there are high values of basic reproduction numbers for Italy and Spain (4.78 and 3.25, respectively) being observed.",

These assumptions can be relaxed in future study. The proposed integrated deterministic-stochastic approach will be best-suited when the peak of the epidemic is passed.
