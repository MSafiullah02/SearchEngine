The WHO has recommended the testing of COVID-19 J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f infection using a reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)-based protocol to target different viral genes [7] . However, these testing protocols require RNA extraction kits, costly RT (quantitative) -PCR machines and trained technicians to operate them. These resources are limited in countries with poor scientific infrastructure, such as Nepal, where there was only one laboratory equipped to test for coronavirus infection [8] , with an increase to three planned for the end of March 2020 [9] . The establishment of fully equipped testing laboratories that fulfil WHO guidelines would require huge investment, expertise and time, which are currently limited by the COVID-19 crisis. Alternative testing protocols that allows COVID-19 testing with limited resources and available manpower in the country, will be highly useful in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic.",

            "text": "We suggest that colorimetric loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) can serve as an alternative COVID-19 testing protocol in developing countries. This method requires a centrifuge (e.g. for RNA extraction, if needed) and a heating system (e.g. a water bath for RNA amplification) as the two major instruments, and these can be easily arranged, even in countries with limited scientific infrastructure [10] . LAMP is a novel nucleic acid amplification technique that amplifies DNA with high specificity, efficiency and rapidity under isothermal conditions (usually 65\u00b0C) [11] . Recently, multiple pre-print publications [12] [13] [14] [15] ( Table 1 ) have reported the successful use of LAMP-based protocols to test for SARS-CoV-2 RNA in serum, urine and saliva, as well as oropharyngeal and nasopharyngeal swabs (Table 2) , both with or without the requirement of viral RNA extraction [12] . Researchers have also used computed tomography (CT) scanning to diagnose COVID-19, demonstrating good diagnostic sensitivity (97%) relative to RT-PCR [16] . CT can assist in making a fast diagnosis, which can be helpful in the rapid isolation and treatment of patients. However, CT technology has inherent problems that limit its use in COVID-19 testing, especially in developing countries. First, it requires deep cleaning of the scanning suites to avoid potential contamination between examinations. This drastically slows patient throughput, a high level of which is needed in limited resource scenarios such as those found in developing countries. Second, and more importantly, contamination of the CT machine can potentially result in the infection of COVID-19-negative patients during scanning.",

Collaboration between international and national organizations (e.g., private hospitals, universities, medical colleges) would be helpful in establishing biosafety facilities and for provision of the necessary supplies in these countries. For example, contamination risk during sample collection, transportation and preliminary laboratory processing (e.g., RNA extraction) can be reduced by concentrating financial and technical efforts on specific laboratories outside the capital city Kathmandu to which patient samples can be transported within hours. In fact, the first ever COVID-19 case in Nepal was diagnosed by government collaboration with a basic science research institute in Nepal",
