It was then used as part of our influenza A/H1N1/2009 diagnostic strategy, alongside universal influenza A16 and influenza B17 screening assays, and seasonal influenza A H3 and H1 subtyping assays [Centre for Health Protection (Hong Kong): CHP molecular diagnostic protocols for the detection of human swine influenza virus type A (subtype H1), http://www.01.chp.gov.hk/files/pdf/CHP_Protocols_for_the_Detection_of_Human_Swine_Influenza.pdf, last accessed May 26, 2009]. After RNA extraction, all samples were screened for influenza A viruses of human, avian, and swine origin, influenza B virus, and the pandemic influenza A/H1N1/2009 simultaneously. For samples with detected influenza A, but tested negative for the pandemic strain, further seasonal influenza A subtyping rRT-PCR assays (to human H1 or H3 viruses) ensued. All four screening and subtyping assays used in our diagnostic suite were from previously published literature (as above) and were optimized to conform to our laboratory setting (eg, instrument/platform availability). A small but important modification was made to Spackman's universal influenza A assay16 with the inclusion of an additional reverse primer, M124R\u2032 5\u2032-TGCAAAGACACTTTCCAGTCTCTG-3\u2032, to enhance the detection of swine-origin influenza virus (Table 1).1617 The CDC's Emergency Use Authorization assay was run in parallel for the first 100 influenza A/H1N1/2009 positive samples during the initial clinical validation of our in-house assay.",

The PCR efficiency values were calculated with the formula E = 10\u22121/slope. The slope of the standard curve, which describes the kinetics of the PCR amplification and indicates how quickly the amount of target nucleic acid can be expected to increase with the amplification cycles, is related to as the efficiency of the amplification reaction. To determine the interassay reproducibility, 15 replicates of the six-point, 10-fold serially diluted NP and HA RNA transcripts (5 \u00d7 102 to 5 \u00d7 107 copies per PCR) were prepared in equivalent copy numbers for the NP and HA gene segments and analyzed in 15 consecutive batch runs by two different operators.",

Of these, there were 20 influenza B, 17 seasonal H1 influenza A, 143 seasonal H3 influenza, and 943 cases of A/H1N1/2009 virus infection (see Table 2). The first 100 positive cases of A/H1N1/2009 detected by the dual-gene duplex assay gave a 100% concordance with the CDC method. The assay appears to be highly specific for the pandemic influenza A variant, in the presence of seasonal influenza virus A(H1N1), A(H3N2) and B subtypes\u2014none of the samples showing positivity for either seasonal influenza A or influenza B gave a positive result with the dual-gene assay. There were, however, six HA-only and 16 NP-only positive results (of the total 943 cases of A/H1N1/2009-positives), which were found in patients who were shown to be infected by the pandemic influenza strain by a sister laboratory that used another laboratory-developed method of their own (unpublished data). All 22 cases were found to be patients on post-antiviral treatment follow-up, with low viral titers (detection threshold >35 cycles), where virus detection probably became stochastic at the later stages of viral shedding. When such a scenario arose, we would repeat the assay and in the event that the repeats were consistently discrepant, we used our backup assay (the CDC EUA assay) to provide the correct result. In our hands, the dual-gene duplex assay had clinically validated sensitivity of 97.7% and specificity of 100%, based on 943 cases, positively infected with influenza A/H1N1/2009, and a rapid turnaround time of about 2.5 hours from sample receipt to result output.",

This in-house dual-gene rRT-PCR assay targeted a region in the HA gene segment that could reliably discriminate influenza A/H1N1/2009 virus from other influenza A(H1) strains (both human and swine) and influenza B. As the HA gene is known to have a relatively high mutation rate, which may cause primer/probe mismatches and a subsequent loss of assay sensitivity, a second region on the more conserved internal NP gene was also targeted in the design of the dual-gene assay. The region targeted in the NP gene is common to only swine-origin influenza, increasing the specificity and confirmation of this assay against influenza A/H1N1/2009 from other human seasonal influenza.",

The R2 obtained for 15 separate amplifications of both the NP and HA genes (obtained from plasmids, not clinical samples) were 0.988, confirming the suitability of this assay for viral load quantification of the influenza A/H1N1/2009 variant. Repeat analysis of 286 clinical specimens performed in two separate runs several days apart showed that the majority of Ct values of the initial versus the repeat testing were well correlated (R2 of 0.94685 for NP and 0.89384 for HA), substantiating the high reproducibility of this RNA-based assay in clinical specimens over the wide range of viral loads expected in infected patients. The differences between duplicates in patients were, as expected, not as good as those for duplicate analyses from plasmid transfects. We attribute this to the likely presence of inherent \u201ccontaminants\u201d in the former, which could act as potential inhibitors of PCR amplification, often referred as the \u201cmatrix effect.\u201d",

Unlike with previous pandemic influenza viruses, which displaced the previous seasonal influenza strains to become the current predominant circulating strain18, there appears to be a recent sporadic resurgence of seasonal influenza H3 and B viruses in certain parts of the world [World Health Organization: Pandemic (H1N1) 2009. update 98, http://www.who.int/csr/don/2010_04_30a/en/index.html, last accessed 2 July, 2010]. However, given its continued global circulation, a reliable diagnostic assay will still be required to screen for this novel influenza A/H1N1/2009 subtype, rapidly and accurately. In addition, the quantitative capability of this assay for viral load measurements enables better monitoring for drug-resistant influenza A/H1N1/2009 mutations, which are beginning to evolve in some infected patients post-treatment (eg, oseltamivir resistant influenza A/H1N1/2009, with probable human-to-human transmission, was first reported on November 20, 200919). A recent study describing the natural viral load profile of the pandemic virus reported a reduction rate of 0.638 log10 copies/ml/day (post symptom onset) in patients who received oseltamivir within two days of symptom onset versus \u22120.409 log10 copies/ml/day in those who did not receive treatment, and viral load was undetectable by the day 7 of oseltamivir treatment.20 Observation of persistently high viral load in a clinically suspicious or oseltamivir-treated patient would suggest the presence of the drug-resistant A/H1N1/2009 mutant and may warrant further identification study.20 In this context, this dual-gene duplex rRT-PCR assay in both its qualitative and quantitative modes, offers a robust, sensitive, and specific option for detection and quantitative viral load determination of the influenza A/H1N1/2009 variant.",
