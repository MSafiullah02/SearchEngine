There are well documented cases transmission in the orbit, and from throat, with fatality. It seems intuitive, and is born out from the literature that seroconversion is influenced by duration of exposure and proximity to infective sources. With respect to identification of patients with infection, the signs of infection may mimic non coronavirus disease, and in addition patients may be asymptomatic at initial presentation (11, 12) . Currently there is no policy for testing asymptomatic patients with surgical disease, and the existing tests do not have 100% sensitivity and specificity, so need repeating and are therefore not infallible in the very short term. (13) With respect to the incubation period of the virus, in a recent paper there were 181 confirmed cases with identifiable exposure and symptom onset windows to estimate the incubation period of COVID-19. The median incubation period was estimated to be 5.1 days J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f (95% CI, 4.5 to 5.8 days), and 97.5% of those who develop symptoms did within 11.5 days (CI, 8.2 to 15.6 days) of infection. However these estimates imply that, under conservative assumptions, 101 out of every 10 000 cases (99th percentile, 482) will develop symptoms after 14 days of active monitoring or quarantine. (14) This has immense significance for mitigating the infection if delaying surgery to await resolution of infection.",

Some secondary deformities have a good prognosis -using only slight departures from acute surgery ( anterior wall frontal sinus), some have a moderately These are groups of fractures that can be treated conservatively with reasonable likelihood of healing e.g. .a mildly displaced fracture, or an anterior wall frontal sinus fracture which requires the same surgical approach, but with a mesh repair or alloplastic bone. In this group a secondary repair will predictably produce an excellent result.",
