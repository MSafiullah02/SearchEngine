Pseudotyped lentiviral particles expressing heterologous viral glycoproteins have been reported for SARS, HCV, Ebola, and dengue viruses [11], [17], [18]. It has also been reported that lentiviral particles pseudotyped with HA from H5N1 (H5) have entry characteristics (i.e., receptor usage, pH requirements, and neutralization) that are similar to those for the real H5N1 [11]. We therefore used a HIV-1-defective genome carrying a luciferase gene to generate two types of pseudotyped viruses: HA alone and HA/NA of the H5N1 virus. Results from TEM examinations revealed that both H5 and H5N1 pseudotyped virus particles contained spike-like HA structures on their surfaces (Fig. 1C). We also observed higher numbers of pseudotyped virus particles generated by HA/NA co-transfection compared to HA alone. Nefkens et al. [11] used a similar system to produce lentiviral pseudotyped viruses with HA from H5N1, adding neuraminidase to culture medium to harvest larger quantities. Their data are consistent with our observation that pseudotyped virus particles bearing both HA and NA proteins are much more easily released from cell surfaces compared to particles bearing the HA protein only.",

In addition, both MDCK and HEK293T cells were more susceptible to pseudotyped virus infection than the Vero cells (Supplementary Table 1).

            "text": "We used two cell lines\u2014B-THP-1 and B-THP-1/DC-SIGN (a stable B-THP-1 clone expressing DC-SIGN molecules)\u2014to investigate whether DC-SIGN is capable of mediating the binding and entry of H5N1 pseudotyped viral particles to target cells. Cells were incubated with H5N1 pseudotyped viruses; viral infectivity was determined with luciferase assays. As shown in Fig. 2\nA, B-THP-1/DC-SIGN cells expressed twice as much luciferase activity as the B-THP-1 cells, and the ability of the H5N1 pseudotyped virus to infect B-THP-1/DC-SIGN cells was reduced when the cells were pre-treated with an anti-DC-SIGN monoclonal antibody. Similar results were observed using the combination of THP-1 and THP-1/DC-SIGN cell lines (data not shown). To rule out the possibility that enhanced infectivity was due to differential expression levels of avian influenza viruses that bind only to the \u03b1-2,3-linked SA receptor, both cell lines were stained with SNA and MAA. As shown in Fig. 2B-1 and -2, both cell lines had identical distributions of \u03b1-2,3- and \u03b1-2,6-linked SA receptors. To clarify whether DC-SIGN is a receptor that mediates the entry of H5N1 pseudotyped viral particles or if it simply enhances viral entry via SA receptors, we used vibrio cholerae sialidase to eliminate \u03b1-2,3-linked SA from the cells. Our results show that almost all of the \u03b1-2,3-linked SA was removed but DC-SIGN levels remained unchanged (Fig. 2B-3). Following treatment with sialidase, B-THP-1 and B-THP-1/DC-SIGN cells were incubated with H5N1 pseudotyped viral particles; we detected very low luminescence levels in the resulting cell lysates (data not shown). This strongly suggests that H5N1 pseudotyped viral particles interact with DC-SIGN and facilitate viral entry into target cells in cis via SA receptors. Transmission electron microscopy images demonstrate the attachment of many H5N1 pseudotyped viral particles to the surfaces of cells expressing DC-SIGN (Fig. 2C); indirect immunofluorescent antibody assay (IFA) results further indicate a colocalization between H5N1 pseudotyped particles and DC-SIGN (Fig. 2D). In addition to transmission electron microscopy and IFA colocalized staining, we also used HIV p24 quantification to study the binding of H5N1 pseudotyped virus particles to DC-SIGN, and found that p24 antigen levels in the cell lysates of DC-SIGN-expressing cells were significantly higher than those in the B-THP-1 and THP-1 control cells. Furthermore, p24 levels were reduced in the presence of anti-DC-SIGN monoclonal antibodies, with inhibition percentages of 23% and 28% for B-THP-1/DC-SIGN and THP-1/DC-SIGN cells, respectively (Table 1\n). These results are similar to those found in a previous report on HCV pseudotyped virus binding to DC-SIGN [14]; those authors reported that the anti-DC-SIGN monoclonal antibody (MAb 612X) had a 19\u201341% inhibitory effect on HCV pseudotyped virus binding to DC-SIGN.",

Furthermore, the morphologies of both mDCs and iDCs changed dramatically 24 h post-infection with H5N1 pseudotyped viruses. At 48 h post-infection, both mDCs and iDCs adhered to the bottom of culture plates (Fig. 3B). Following incubation with the H5N1 pseudotyped virus at 4 \u00b0C for 1 h, DCs were co-cultured with MDCK cells and the resulting luciferase activity of MDCK lysates was measured. The results show that iDCs had a significantly higher capture ability compared to mDCs, and that this effect can be blocked by pre-treatment with anti-DC-SIGN monoclonal antibodies (Fig. 3C). Based on these findings, we conclude that iDCs play an important role in the dissemination of H5N1 pseudotyped virus infection due to its ability to capture and transfer viral infections to target cells.",

Our results also imply that a reduction in DC-SIGN expression may lead to the phenomenon described in this report. Based on our findings, we suggest that iDCs residing in the lower respiratory tract or deep lung compartments are susceptible to H5N1 virus infection via the \u03b1-2,3-linked SA receptor and DC-SIGN. Infected iDCs then migrate to lymphoid tissues and other organs and transfer the H5N1 virus to other target cells expressing \u03b1-2,3-linked SA receptors, resulting in a systemic infection. Another recently published study suggests that CD4+ T-cells may be an important target for H5N1 virus infection [23].",
