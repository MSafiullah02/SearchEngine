Owing to the deletion of 29 nucleotides [between T27867 and A27868 for strain SG2774 (accession number AY283798)], two overlapping ORFs (ORF8a/ORF8b) were found in most human isolates (Fig. 1). ORF8a and ORF8b are predicted to encode two small proteins, 8a and 8b, whereas ORF8 encodes a single protein, 8ab, representing a fused form of proteins 8a and 8b. To understand the functions of these proteins, cDNA fragments covering these ORFs were cloned into pFlag, giving rise to five constructs either with or without a Flag\u2010tag at the N\u2010terminus (Fig. 1). These constructs were then expressed in both in vitro expression systems and in intact cells.",

Expression of the same four constructs in rabbit reticulocyte lysates in the presence of [35S]methionine gave rise to the same four products (Fig. 2B, lanes 1\u20134). In addition, a series of bands (ladder bands) with increases of approximately 10 kDa were detected when pF\u20108b and pF\u20108ab were expressed in the system (Fig. 2B, lanes 3 and 4). The patterns of these bands suggest that they may represent ubiquitinated forms of proteins 8b and 8ab. To determine whether these bands are related to the 8b region, immunoprecipitation was carried out using rabbit polyclonal antibodies to protein 8b. As shown in Fig. 2B, the 10.2 kDa protein 8b and the 14.4 kDa protein 8ab, together with their corresponding ladder bands, were precipitated with the antibodies (lanes 7 and 8). The fact that these bands were efficiently immunoprecipitated by the antibodies to protein 8b suggests that proteins 8b and 8ab may be modified by ubiquitination.",

Interestingly, a prominent band (8ab*), migrating more slowly than the 14.4 kDa protein 8ab, was detected in cells expressing pF\u20108ab (Fig. 2C, lane 4). This may represent a post\u2010translationally modified protein 8ab; characterization of this modification was conducted, and the results are presented in a later section.

As shown in Fig. 3A, western blot analysis using antibody to Myc resulted in the detection of monoubiquitin and polyubiquitin in cells expressing the Myc\u2010tagged ubiquitin alone (Fig. 3A, lane 3). The monoubiqitin was not detected in cells coexpressing the Myc\u2010tagged ubiquitin with either protein 8b (Fig. 3A, lane 1) or protein 8ab (Fig. 3A, lane 2). Instead, weak polyubiquitin bands were observed (Fig. 3A, lanes 1 and 2). Immunoprecipitation of cell lysates prepared from these transfected cells with antibody to Flag led to the detection of massive free and ubiquitin\u2010conjugated protein 8ab by western blot with antibody to Flag (Fig. 3A, lane 5). However, much lower amounts of protein 8b were detected in cells coexpressing ubiquitin and protein 8b (Fig. 3A, lane 4). Western blot analysis of the same precipitates with antibody to Myc resulted in efficient detection of polyubiquitin bands in cells coexpressing the Myc\u2010tagged ubiquitin and the Flag\u2010tagged protein 8ab (Fig. 3A, lane 8). Much weaker detection of polyubiquitin bands, however, was obtained with cells coexpressing the Myc\u2010tagged ubiquitin and the Flag\u2010tagged protein 8b by western blot analysis with antibody to Myc (Fig. 3A, lane 7). These results strongly suggest that proteins 8b and 8ab are modified by ubiquitination.",

In this study, ORF8a was expressed in vitro in both wheat germ extracts and rabbit reticulocyte lysates as a 5.3 kDa protein. Owing to the lack of a specific antibody, the protein was not detected in cells. In the genomic RNA of SARS\u2010CoV, ORF8a is located immediately downstream of a strong body transcriptional regulatory sequence (AGUCUAAACGAA\nAUG)[14], and is the 5\u2032\u2010most ORF of the subgenomic mRNA. With the recent detection of proteins 3a and 7a from subgenomic mRNA3 and mRNA7, respectively, the majority of the 5\u2032\u2010most ORFs of genomic and subgenomic mRNAs of SARS\u2010CoV are known to encode proteins [13, 15]. In patients infected with SARS\u2010CoV strains carrying the 29 nucleotide deletion, antibodies against the 8a peptide were present, confirming the expression of the protein [16, 17]. ORF8ab was expressed as a 14.4 kDa Flag\u2010tagged protein in this study. Although expression of ORF8ab in virus\u2010infected cells and production of antibodies against this protein in patients are yet to be established, protein 8ab was likely to be expressed by a mechanism similar to ORF8a, as it is the only ORF in the subgenomic mRNA8 encoded by SARS\u2010CoV strains without the 29 nucleotide deletion. ORF8b was expressed as a 10.2 kDa Flag\u2010tagged protein. However, translation of the protein was not detected from expression of the overlapping ORF8a/ORF8b. This ORF was previously speculated to be translationally silent [14], and no antibodies against the protein have been found in patients [16]. Although ORF8b was located downstream of a weak transcriptional regulatory sequence (CUAAUAA ACUCAUG)[1], no additional subgenomic mRNA starting from this position was identified. If protein 8b was synthesized from ORF8a/ORF8b, it would be unlikely to be translated by the conventional ribosomal scanning mechanism.",

Although the same residue is present in protein 8b, glycosylation of protein 8b was not detected. Glycosylation plays a fundamental role in the oligomerization, sorting, transport and folding of proteins [18]. During glycosylation, glycan residues are transferred to Asn of the target sequence motif Asn\u2010X\u2010Ser/Thr on a nascent peptide by oligosaccharyltransferase in eukaryotic cells [19]. The glycan is the \u2018admission ticket\u2019 for proteins to undergo folding or oligomerization, sorting and transport [18]. Substitution mutation of the N81 to an Asp in protein 8ab made the protein more susceptible to degradation. In the absence of the 8a region, protein 8b was also rapidly degraded, as the protein was not glycosylated, although it contains the potential target sequence motif for glycosylation. It is therefore speculated that glycosylation may assist in folding of protein 8b. In general, the folding process happens in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the Golgi apparatus [20, 21]. In the ER, the calnexin\u2013calreticulin cycle is involved in the folding process of glycosylated proteins [22]. In this process, calnexin and calreticulin bind transiently to glycosylated proteins, and subsequently form a complex with cochaperone ERp57 [23]. The three\u2010protein complex folds glycosylated proteins by forming the appropriate disulfide bonds [24]. Protein 8ab is rich in cysteine residues in the 8a region, and may attain the correct conformation by forming disulfide bonds in this region.",

            "text": "More intriguingly, proteins 8b and 8ab could covalently and noncovalently bind to monoubiquitin and polyubiquitin, and facilitate the binding of the two proteins to cellular ubiquitinated proteins. The noncovalent binding of proteins 8b and 8ab to ubiquitin suggests that the two proteins may contain a ubiquitin\u2010binding domain (UBD). UBDs are able to bind to ubiquitin noncovalently and covalently [25]. So far, nine UBDs, such as the ubiquitin\u2010binding motif and ubiquitin\u2010associated domain, have been identified [26, 27, 28]. Many UBDs were initially discovered by homology search with the identified UBDs [25, 29, 30]. However, proteins 8b and 8ab do not share homology with any known UBD, suggesting that they might contain a novel UBD. As proteins 8b and 8ab but not protein 8a are conjugated with polyubiquitin and form complexes with monoubiquitin and polyubiquitin, the novel UBD is probably located in the 8b region. Ubiquitin conjugation of UBDs could facilitate the formation of complexes between a UBD and free mono/polyubiquitin. It is generally believed that UBDs are able to bind to other ubiquitinated proteins [25], disrupting the function or transportation of polyubiquitinated proteins [27, 28].

            "text": "Another intriguing and essential issue is whether splitting of the single ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b by the deletion of 29 nucleotides is evolutionarily advantageous. The following considerations and clues provided by this study would suggest that it is beneficial to the virus. First, as splitting of the single ORF8 results in the formation of a bicistronic mRNA species, expression of the downstream ORF8b would be regulated by various translational control mechanisms. Evidence obtained from in vitro and in vivo expression of constructs containing the two separate ORFs suggests that the downstream ORF is either silent or expressed at a low level. It is unclear at the moment whether this ORF is expressed in virus\u2010infected cells. One recent study found positive staining in some of the SARS\u2010CoV\u2010infected cells with polyclonal antibodies to protein 8b, suggesting that the protein may be expressed [11]. Second, the data presented in this study show that the 8b region may contain multiple functional domains, such as for ubiquitin binding, ubiquitination and glycosylation, involved in the regulation of the stability, host\u2013virus interaction and biochemical properties of protein 8ab. However, no functional domain has so far identified in the 8a region of the protein. Although protein 8a would certainly be expressed from the bicistronic mRNA8, the absence of the 8b region would result in the loss of the functions assigned to the 8b region of protein 8ab. Finally, as ubiquitination and the binding to mono/polyubiqutins, as well as ubiquitinated cellular proteins, may regulate cellular signaling pathways involved in the host antiviral response, silencing the expression of protein 8ab may constitute a viral strategy to evade the host antiviral defense mechanisms. More systematic studies of the functions of these proteins are required to address this issue further.",

(C) Inhibition of the degradation of the unglycosylated protein 8ab by lactacystin and NLVS. Cos\u20107 cells expressing protein 8ab were incubated either with dimethylsulfoxide (lane 1) or with 8 \u00b5m lactacystin plus 32 \u00b5m NLVS (lane 2), and harvested at 18 h post\u2010transfection. Total cell lysates were separated on SDS/20% polyacrylamide gel and analyzed by western blot with antibodies to Flag. The same membrane was also probed with antibodies to actin as a control.",
