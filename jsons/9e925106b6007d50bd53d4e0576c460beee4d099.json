The fact that they are not evolutionary conserved, even between related species could indicate that most of them are non functional and may represent just transcriptional noise. To date, only 200 lncRNAs have been studied functionally with variable outcome, although many of them show at least functional evidence in vitro. Only a few lncRNAs have been studied in animal models, suggesting that they are not essential for viability. For example, mouse homologue of HOTAIR is poorly conserved in sequence and its deletion, along with the deletion of the HoxC cluster, has only a little effect in vivo, neither on the expression pattern or transcription effi ciency, nor on the amount of K27me3 coverage of different Hoxd target genes [ 14 ] .

            "text": "Low degree of lncRNA conservation among species suggests their different evolutionary design to protein coding genes. The limited phylogenetic range of lncRNA could be also explained by specifi c existence, but rapid declination within particular lineages [ 15 ] . A fi rst possible scenario for lncRNA emergence is metamorphosis of protein-coding gene into non-coding RNA seq uence. A protein-coding gene may under go mutations such as a frame shift that disrupts its open reading frame while maintaining the expression of the RNA transcript. For example, Xist gene encodes an lncRNA that is crucial for X chromosome inactivation. Recently, it's been shown that several exons and the promoter of Xist are derived from the protein-coding gene Lnx3 that has acquired frame shift mutations during early mammalian evolution [ 16 , 17 ] . It is possible that such a metamorphosis involved two steps: initial degeneration of the original sequence, followed by subsequent emergence of residual exons into newly formed Xist gene. Possibly these events occurred concurrently ( Fig. 4.2a ) . A nother possibility includes chromosomal rearrangement, when two separate sequences are joined and together create an expressed non-coding sequence ( Fig. 4 .2b ). One such example comes from the observation that a dog testis-derived non-coding RNA has arisen only recently following a lineage specifi c change. Also duplications in a non-coding RNA [ 18 ] . Local, tandem duplication might also lead to generation of repeats increasing the size of lncRNA ( Fig. 4 .2c ). Insertions of transposable element s may also emerge as lncRNA. For example, BC1 and BC200 (brain cytoplasmic RNA1 and 200-nucleotide) ncRNAs derive from two separate transposons , in the rodent and anthropoid lineages. Despite their lack of common origin, BC1 and BC200 are involved in similar roles in translational regulation. Furthermore, a transposable element containing a transcriptional start site can be inserted into the genome to create a functional, but noncoding RNA sequence [ 19 ] (Fig. 4.2d ) .",

With respect to transcriptional start sites, NATs can be divided into three types: (1) overlapping, (2) intronic and (3) [ 25 , 26 ] . Sequence of overlapping NATs partly overlaps with sense mRNA sequence with preference for the 3\u2032-untranslated region (3\u2032 UTR).

These lincRNAs have been implicated in diverse biological processes, including cell-cycle regulation, immune surveillance, and embryonic stem cell pluripotency. However, the mechanism by which these lincRNAs function remains elusive. To date, there are approximately 3300 of human lincRNAs identifi ed by analyzing chromatin -state maps in various human cell types. It is known that one of the well-characterized lincRNA HOTAIR binds the polycomb repressive complex (PRC2). Remarkably, approximately 20 % of lincRNAs expressed in various cell types are bound by PRC2. Other lincRNA interact with different chromatin-modifying complexes. Furthermore depletion of certain lincRNAs associated with PRC2 leads to changes in gene express ion , causing the up-regulation of genes that are normally silenced by PRC2. Therefore it is suggested that some lincRNAs guide chromatin-modifying complexes to specifi c genomic loci to regulate gene expression [ 2 , 5 ] .",

Such a bi-directional transcription results in so called cryptic unstable transcripts (CUTs) in budding yeast [ 30 -32 ] . CUTs are Pol II-dependent transcripts produced from promoters in opposite direction to the coding gene, which are degraded by the nuclear exosome shortly after their synthesis. Another type of transcript derived from promoter regions are stable unannotated transcripts (SUTs), which are not processed by exosome [ 32 ] . Bidirectional transcription is not only limited to yeast species, but extends to higher eukaryotes too. Studies using exosome depletion in human fi broblasts have revealed lncRNAs, which correspond to upstream regions of protein coding genes. Such promoter-upstream transcripts are referred to as PROMPTs [ 33 ] . Furthermore, RNA-seq analysis from mouse embryonic stem cells has shown many promoter associated transcripts, which are transcribed in nonrandom, divergent orientation [ 34 ] . Another sequencing approach employed global run on sequencing (GRO-seq) to indentify nascent RNAs in human fi broblasts. This study revealed that almost 80 % of the active promoters display bidirectional transcriptional activity [ 35 ] . It is now known that bidirectional transcription is a widespread phenomenon, which is conserved across species.

The presence of sense lncRNA, which contain exons from mRNA sequences and intronic lncRNA that are derived entirely from intronic sequence, has lead to the hypothesis that many lncRNA transcripts are unprocessed pre-mRNAs prior to splicing and that intronic lncRNAs are by-products of this processing step. However, this is not the case for all sense and intronic lncRNAs since the expression patterns of some of these transcripts are not the same as their associated protein-coding gene [ 41 ] . Another hypothesis suggests that some lncRNA sequences are precursors to short miRNAs. An example of this is the lncRNA H19 which encodes the miRNA miR -675 [ 4 ] . Based on this evidence, post-transcriptional processing may occur with many lncRNA transcripts, but until more of them are functionally defi ned this question remains open.",

Tsix prevents RepA binding to either X chromosomes until post-cellular differentiation, when RepA in association with the chromatin -modifying complex PRC2 (polycomb repressive complex 2) binds to one of the two X chromosomes at the so called inactivation center [ 50 ] . Full-length Xist, produced from the X chromosome , destined to be inactivated, also binds to PRC2 and leads to the spreading of X inactivation from the center to the entire X chromosome in cis . Active chromatin status of the other X chromosome is protected by Tsix, which blocks transcription of Xist. It is not well understood, what prevents Xist from escaping the inactive X chromosome and acting on the active X chromosome in trans or how 20 % of X chromosome genes escape inactivation in human females [ 51 , 52 ] . Once inactivation is established, X chromosome is condensed into facultative heterochromatin and forms a round body at the nuclear periphery [ Genomic imprinting is another epigenetic phenomenon that utilizes lncRNA [ 56 ] . Imprinted genes play an important role in mammalian development and therefore their expression has to be tightly regulated [ 57 ] . Interestingly, many imprinted gene loci express lncRNAs that play a crucial role in regulating the expression of neighboring imprinted coding genes in cis [ 58 ] . One such lncRNA involved in genomic imprinting in cis is Air , which is mono-allelically expressed from the paternal allele. Air is known to bind to G9a histone methyltransferase and associate with chromatin to participate on silencing of three imprinted genes: Slc22a3, Slc22a2 and Igf2r. Loss of Air leads to bi-allelic expression of Slc22a3 and loss of G9a recruitment to imprinted genes. It has been suggested that Air acts to guide G9a to chromatin at the Slc22a3 promoter [ 59 ] .",

One such an example is a lncRNA that is transcribed from a minor promoter upstream of the human dihudrofolate reductase DHFR gene. Transcription of this full length lncRNA is thought to repress transcription from the major DHFR promoter [ 67 ] in an RNA dependent manner. The lncRNA binds to the major DHFR promoter and the general transcription factor IIB and leads to dissociation of the pre-initiation complex. It is proposed that the singlestranded lncRNA hybridizes to double-stranded DNA in the promoter region to form a triplex structure. Such a structure is predicted to be most concentrated around human promoters [ 68 ] , but it is unclear whether this is a common mechanism for lncRNA transcriptional repression. Another type of transcriptional gene regulation by lncRNA is the recruitment of transcription factors. When a lncRNA sequence is located near to transcription factor binding site, the lncRNA transcript may enhance the binding of the transcription factor to promoter region. An example of this type of regulation is the lncRNA called Evf2 , which regulates two homeodomain genes, Dlx5 and Dlx6 , involved in neuronal differentiation, migration and limb pattering [ 69 ] . Single-stranded Evf2 forms a complex with Dlx2 , another homeodomain protein. This Evf2 -Dlx2 complex activates Dlx5 / 6 enhancer, by a yet unknown mechanism.",

Trimeric HSF1 activates heatshock proteins by binding to their promoters . Formation of HSR1 -HSF1 is induced by heat shock and knockdown of HSR1 causes cells to become thermo-sensitive.

Unlike NATs associated with imprinting genes such as Tsix, Air or HOTAIR, which induce epigenetic changes in chromatin and lead to gene silencing, other NATs can form RNA duplexes to mask key cis regulatory elements. This can lead to an alternative splicing pattern of overlapping gene transcripts. For example, the Zeb2/Sip1 NAT is complementary to the 5\u2032 splice site of an intron of the zinc fi nger Hox mRNA Zeb2, which is involved in epithelialmesenchymal transition (EMT). Zeb2 NAT is expressed upon EMT and masks the splice site, so blocking splicesome function. This causes the translation machinery to recognize and bind to an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) in the retained intron resulting in more effi cient Zeb2 translation (Fig. 4.7 ) [ 72 ] .",

A number of miRNA and pseudogene transcripts are also directly involved in PTEN dosage regulation at a post-transcriptional level. PTEN and PTENP1 3\u2032 UTRs are highly conserved. PTENP1 RNA , which is also referred to as competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA), binds to common miRNA preventing their Post-transcriptional regulation by lncRNA. Brown block arrow is Zeb2 gene. Intron is colored in orange . Hairpins correspond to miRNAs binding to miRNA response element in 3\u2032 UTR of PTEN .
