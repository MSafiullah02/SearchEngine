The current study aimed to examine retrospectively stored specimens for the presence of HCoV-NL63 using nested RT-PCR assays targeting the 1a and 1b genes. The study population was composed of patients with acute respiratory disease warranting presentation to Queensland hospitals. HCoV-NL63 was detected in the nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPA) of 16 of 840 specimens representing 766 patients (2%). HCoV-NL63 positive individuals were diagnosed most commonly with lower respiratory tract (LRT) disease (81%). The clinical diagnosis was commonly supported by an abnormal chest X-ray (56%) together with respiratory distress (50%), wheeze (44%), and r\u00e2 les (25%) on first presentation with HCoV-NL63 infection. All patients positive for HCoV-NL63 required admission to hospital. Among 38% of HCoV-NL63 positive specimens a second pathogen was detected. Sequencing of amplicon from gene 1b revealed more than 99% nucleotide homology with the viral type strains while sequencing amplicon from gene 1a permitted the grouping of viral strains. It was shown that HCoV-NL63 is associated with severe LRT disease in an Australian hospital setting during the cooler months of the year. We propose that HCoV-NL63 is a global and seasonal pathogen of both children and adults associated with severe LRT illness.",

Viruses are also a common cause of lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) and include the diseases bronchitis, bronchiolitis, laryngotracheobronchitis, and pneumonia, which may necessitate mechanical ventilation. Human rhinoviruses (HRV), respiratory syncytial virus (hRSV), and parainfluenza viruses (PIV) are the viruses isolated most commonly [Selwyn, 1990; Hall, 2001; Hayden, 2004] . Features of mild URT disease include fever, cough, and coryza, while LRT infections may also exhibit the more severe signs of dyspnoea, r\u00e2 les, respiratory distress, and wheeze. Most recently, the discoveries of human metapneumovirus (hMPV) and SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) have exemplified the benefits of a molecular approach to rapidly identify and characterize previously unknown microbial causes of serious respiratory illness and to determine their epidemiology. Nonetheless, up to 60% of respiratory tract infections continue to go undiagnosed among hospitals and clinics worldwide [Nicholson et al., 1997] .",

The prototype HCoV, 229E, and OC43, were identified in the 1960s [Hamre and Procknow, 1966] but until the discovery of the SARS-CoV, received relatively little attention as human pathogens beyond their causal role in the common cold and associated viral wheeze [Hendley et al., 1972; Vile et al., 1995] . It is entirely possible that the prevalence of these viruses has been underestimated because of the widespread use of serological assays to diagnose infection and the fastidious nature of viral growth in vitro [Simons et al., 1996; van Elden LJR et al., 2004] . However, recent reports have associated HCoV with gastrointestinal problems , acute disseminated encephalomyelitis [Yeh et al., 2004] , and more severe respiratory tract infection, particularly in the elderly and the immunocompromised [Falsey et al., 2002; Pene et al., 2003] , pointing to a greater role for HCoVs in disease than previously thought. Apart from the laboratory adapted type strains, related variants are known to exist yet there are few reports detailing the extent of genetic variation within the three serogroups within the genus Coronavirus.",

A second group from the Netherlands recently described the detection of HCoV-NL63 from four infants and a child suffering from respiratory tract disease [Fouchier et al., 2004] . Detections of HCoV-NL63 by van der Hoek and colleagues occurred in four children and three adults, with a peak detection rate of 7% among ill visitors to a Medical Center in Amsterdam during mid-winter. No virus was detected during the warmer months. Interestingly, the data indicated the possible existence of several viral lineages within the HCoV-NL63-like genomes. Because very little is known about this pathogen, an Australian patient population was investigated for the presence of HCoV-NL63. Once found, this study determined the clinical features of disease associated with infection and examined local strains for genetic variability from the type strain.",

Specimens were predominantly nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPA; 93%), but also included bronchoalveolar lavages (3.4%), endotracheal aspirates (1.4%), and bronchial washings (2.0%) collected either at the time of visit or following hospital admission. The majority of patients visited the Royal Children's Hospital, Royal Brisbane, and Women's Hospitals in Brisbane, Queensland while others visited the Ipswich, Logan, Redlands, Redcliffe, and Cairns Hospitals in Queensland. Nonconsecutive specimens were selected by season, without prior knowledge of patient details or microbiological status. The subjects ranged in age from 3 days to 80 years (median \u00bc 1.3 years), with children 5 years of age or younger comprising 77.6% of the study population. Specimens from winter (n \u00bc 492), spring (n \u00bc 183), summer (n \u00bc 86), and autumn (n \u00bc 79) were tested. Prior to this retrospective study, all specimens had been tested for common microbial respiratory pathogens and stored at \u00c0708C. The laboratory assays included culture-amplified direct fluorescent assay and subsequent RT-PCR [Syrmis et al., 2004] of negative specimens for hRSV, human adenoviruses (hAdV), PIV types I, II, and III, and influenza viruses A (FluA) and B [Syrmis et al., 2004 ]. An in-house RT-PCR was used to simultaneously detect all four subtypes of hMPV. PCR assays for the HCoV OC43, and 229E (Table II) and Bordetella pertussis [Kosters et al., 2002] were also performed. Selective culture media were used to grow bacterial pathogens including Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Streptococcus species, Hemophilus influenzae, Neisseria species, Staphylococcus species, Legionella pneumophila, and Candida albicans. No microbes were detected in 557 specimens taken from 506 patients (66%) while a suspected pathogen was detected in the remaining 283 specimens representing 260 patients (34%).",

The current data have confirmed and further expanded the epidemiological component of previous research by determining that HCoV-NL63 exists at a similar prevalence among ill patients in Australia and the Netherlands. Specimens were predominantly chosen to examine the prevalence of HCoV-NL63 during winter, however, specimens were also tested from spring, summer, and autumn. The peak monthly prevalence was on a par to that reported in the Netherlands, although this study detected a broader seasonal prevalence whereby a third of detections occurred outside of winter; during late autumn or early spring.

However, the 1a gene exhibited greater variability suggesting the existence of two main viral lineages. Further studies will be required to characterize the degree of genetic diversity among less conserved genes from viral strains worldwide. Until this can be defined and the applicability of current diagnostic molecular assays truly evaluated, the use of more than one PCR screening assay, as presented by both earlier reports is a sensible approach for studying the epidemiology of HCoV-NL63.",

Therefore severe URT infection with HCoV-NL63, which indirectly causes LRT disease cannot be excluded. Many diagnoses of viral LRT disease are based on the combined clinical data and laboratory detection of virus from URT tissue. A study using specimens collected from the LRT without possible contamination by tissue from the URT is essential to more accurately determine the etiology of HCoV-NL63 disease.

These data may indicate a significant characteristic of HCoV-NL63 epidemiology since such a high rate of coinfection is uncommon. Furthermore, fewer of the HCoV-NL63 infected patients in the study had underlying medical conditions than reported by Fouchier et al. [2004] . All studies to date have found HCoV-NL63 infections in patients with underlying disease, whether they are immunocompromised due to chemotherapy or HIV infection or have another medical condition such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Further study will be required to determine whether patients with codetected microbes have more severe disease or a worse long-term prognosis than patients with a single detected microbe using clinically validated severity scores. It is noteworthy, however, that HCoV-NL63 infection was more commonly associated with LRT disease than hRSV, HAdV, PIV, or FluA infection among our population.

Taking into account the seasonal spread of infections over the study period, the recent detection of HCoV-NL63 in specimens dating back to 1988 by Fouchier et al. [2004] and the extent of genetic homology to HCoV-229E, it does not appear that HCoV-NL63 arose from a recent animal virus mutation as may have occurred for the SARS-CoV [Fouchier et al., 2004; Marra et al., 2004] . Therefore, the result of infection by HCoV-NL63 may more accurately be labeled a redefined infectious disease (RID) rather than an emerging infectious disease, which is defined as disease that has newly emerged in a population or significantly increased in incidence or geographic range [Morse, 1995] . While HIV, Escherichia coli O157:H7, and the SARS-CoV are examples that cause the former, hMPV exemplifies a cause of RID [van den Hoogen et al., 2001] .",

It should be considered in the differential diagnosis of hospitalized children, the elderly and those with pre-existing immunocompromise or chronic respiratory disease during the cooler months of the year. Ongoing studies will address the transmission, incidence, and molecular epidemiology of HCoV-NL63 in the non-hospitalized community to determine whether the pathogen circulates among the community in a similar seasonal pattern causing less severe disease. The identification of this respiratory pathogen will help clinicians improve methods of patient management, reduce antibiotic use, and implement better infection control procedures within the hospital environment. The development of a single well-characterized and evaluated molecular assay to detect all HCoV-NL63-like viruses is essential before the full impact of this pathogen on community acquired respiratory disease and the significance of co-infection with characterized microbes on clinical outcome among infected patients can be elucidated.",
