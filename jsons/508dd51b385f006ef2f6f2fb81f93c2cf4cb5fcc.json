Maternal vaccines that can induce lactogenic immunity to protect suckling piglets via colostrums and milk are pivotal for the prevention and control of PEDV infection in neonatal suckling piglets. In this study, a group of pregnant sows were first orally immunized with coated PEDV-loaded microspheres and boosted with killed PEDV vaccines (heterologous prime-boost). It has been detected that the levels of PEDV-specific antibodies (IgG and IgA) in their sera and milks were higher than other negative groups (P < 0\u00c1001 or P < 0\u00c105). Furthermore, it has been proved by the neutralization assay that the induced antibodies could significantly inhibit virus infection as compared to other negative groups (P < 0\u00c101 or P < 0\u00c105). Importantly, after PEDV challenge, more than 90% of the suckling piglets delivered by the sows in the heterologous prime-boost group were completely protected. Overall, the results show that 'heterologous prime-boost' form is an efficient and effective way to provide protection for suckling piglets against PEDV through lactogenic immunity.",

PEDV, a member of the genus Alphacoronavirus within the family Coronaviridae (Pensaert and de Bouck 1978) , is an enveloped, single-stranded, positive-sense RNA virus with a genome of appropriately 28 kb in length (Pensaert and de Bouck 1978) . Its genome is sequentially composed of 5' untranslated region (UTR) , open reading frame 1a/1b (ORF1a/1b), spike (S), ORF3, envelope (E), membrane (M), nucleocapsid (N) and 3' UTR (Liu et al. 2017) . The clinical signs of PED are characterized by severe watery diarrhea with subsequent dehydration in all ages of swine, and a high mortality rate in suckling piglets (Stevenson et al. 2013) . A case of PED was first reported in Belgium in 1978, and since then the disease has been rapidly spreading to other regions in Europe and Asia (Pensaert and de Bouck 1978; Song and Park 2012) . Since 2010, a Letters in Applied Microbiology 69, 258--263 \u00a9 2019 The Society for Applied Microbiology large number of PED outbreaks have been reported in China, with a mortality rate of 50-100% among infected suckling piglets (Sun et al. 2016) . In 2013, PED spread rapidly to the United States, causing high rates of death among piglets and substantial economic losses to the porcine industry there (Vlasova et al. 2014) .",

            "text": "It has been widely acknowledged that multiple immunizations (the 'prime-boost') are indispensable for a vaccine to be effective. This means that the immunized subjects have to go through several immunizations before ideal efficacy can be expected. Research has proved that in many cases, priming immunizations and boost immunizations (heterologous prime-boost) using different types of vaccines targeting the same antigens, is more immunogenic than using the same types of vaccines (homologous prime-boost) (Lu 2009 ). The efficacy of the heterologous prime-boost has been further proved by Wang et al. in their study where the combination of a fusion expression plasmid of CTLA4 and (Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome Virus) PRRSV GP5 and inactivated PRRSV vaccines in the 'prime-boost' format are found to be able to induce significant humoral and cellular responses (Wang et al. 2013) . In the study of Pan et al. after sequentially immunized with a haemagglutinin (HA) DNA vaccine and an inactivated avian influenza (AI) vaccine, the Specific-Pathogen Free (SPF) chickens were completely protected after intranasally challenged with H9N2 AIV (Pan et al. 2009 ). Furthermore, it has been supported by the study of Wang et al. that the use of HA DNA vaccines as the prime combined with inactivated flu vaccines as the boost is more effective in eliciting protective antibody responses than the use of DNA vaccines or inactivated vaccines alone (Wang et al. 2008) . In addition, several other studies that also used the 'heterologous prime-boost' strategy have demonstrated better enhanced immune responses in the 'heterologous prime-boost' group compared with the use of only one type of vaccines alone (Schneider et al. 2001; Boyer et al. 2005; Ranasinghe et al. 2006) , indicating that the heterologous prime-boost is indeed a more effective way of immunization.",

It causes enteritis in swine of all ages and is often fatal in neonatal piglets (Stevenson et al. 2013) . Some reports show that the only effective way to protect neonatal suckling piglets from PEDV infection is maternal vaccines through lactogenic immunity (Chattha et al. 2015) . In this study, coated PEDV-loaded microspheres combined with inactivated PEDV vaccines were used to immunize pregnant sows to protect their newborn piglets against PEDV infection.",

            "text": "In our previous study, we found that coated PEDVloaded microspheres induced PEDV-specific immunity via oral administration one time in weaned piglets (Wen et al. 2018) . It is not unusual that multiple immunizations (i.e. 'prime-boost') are required for many vaccines to be successful (Lu 2009 ). To enhance the immune responses against PEDV, we have tried the prime-boost immunization regimen. Pregnant sows were primed with coated PEDV-loaded microspheres and then boosted with coated PEDV-loaded microspheres or inactivated PEDV vaccines. As shown in Fig. 1 , we detected higher levels of PEDV-specific IgG in serum samples collected from sows in the 'coated PEDV-loaded microspheres + inactivated vaccines' group at day 35 after the first immunization (P < 0\u00c105), compared to other negative controls (Fig. 1a) . Moreover, we also observed higher PEDV-specific IgA titres in milk samples collected from sows in the 'coated PEDV-loaded microspheres + inactivated PEDV vaccines' group (P < 0\u00c1001), compared to other negative groups ( Fig. 1b) , indicating the prime-boost strategy can enhance humoral responses in pregnant sows. In addition, we also found that the pregnant sows in the group of 'coated PEDV-loaded microspheres + inactivated PEDV vaccines' are with significantly higher levels of antibodies compared with the pregnant sows boost immunized with coated PEDV-loaded microspheres, indicating that the heterologous prime-boost immunization can be more immunogenic than the homologous prime-boost. This result is supported by other similar studies (Wang et al. 2008; Pan et al. 2009 ). Virus neutralizing antibodies are very important for the protective immunity against PEDV, as it can inhibit PEDV replication in intestinal epithelial cells by blocking PEDV attachment and internalization in the cells (Li et al. 2017) . Considering that neutralizing antibodies play pivotal roles in protecting neonates from enteric infections, we tested whether serum and milk samples collected from the sows in different vaccines groups can inhibit PEDV infection in target cells by detecting the number of neutralizing antibodies in these serum and milk samples. As shown in Fig. 2 , sera collected from sows immunized by coated PEDV-loaded microspheres + inactivated PEDV Letters in Applied Microbiology 69, 258--263 \u00a9 2019 The Society for Applied Microbiology vaccines have higher neutralizing antibody titres than the sera collected from sows in other negative groups (P < 0\u00c105 or P < 0\u00c101) (Fig. 2a) . Similarly, milk samples collected from the sows after their delivery also have higher neutralizing antibody titers in the 'coated PEDV-loaded microspheres + inactivated PEDV vaccines' group (P < 0\u00c105), compared to other negative groups (Fig. 2b) . Our data show that the titres of neutralizing antibodies in the serum and milk of the sows were significantly increased after they were immunized with inactivated PEDV vaccines. In addition, we found that all the inoculated sows and those in the control group did not show any clinical problems (data not shown), proving that the coated PEDV-loaded microspheres are safe for sows.",

In this study, all the suckling piglets delivered by the sows were challenged with PEDV via oral feeding, and we found that suckling piglets from the 'coated PEDV-loaded microspheres + inactivated PEDV vaccines' group had the highest protection rate (91\u00c12%) (Fig. 3) after the PEDV challenge without any clinical problem displayed, indicating that the heterologous prime-boost immunization can most efficiently induce lactogenic immunity and protect suckling piglets against PEDV infection. However, there are still several important questions that need to be addressed. For example, what is the protective mechanism of the heterologous primeboost immunization? Can the protection rate in neonatal suckling piglets be increased by vaccines combine with adjuvants? Does the vaccination provide cross-protection against other PEDV strains? The further elucidation of these questions will help us better control PED.",
