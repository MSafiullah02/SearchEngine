ACE2 was first known as a vasoconstrictive protein that regulated the renal and cardiovascular function, abundantly expressed in the pneumocytes of lung epithelia and enterocytes of small intestine [12, 13] . This may explain why in addition to the predominant respiratory or pulmonary manifestation, the gastrointestinal symptoms occurred in a substantial portion of COVID-19 patients [14] , including diarrhea or vomiting found in our study. This virus entry is further facilitated by a polybasic site containing several arginine residues in S protein of SARS-CoV-2, subject to the highly efficient cleavage of a serine protease TMPRSS2 in the target cell, which in turn drives the fusion of viral and host cellular membranes [15, 16] .",

Upon hospital admission, our clinical data from a substantial portion of COVID-19 patients showed the abnormality in several blood parameters, including peripheral blood cells, hepatic enzymes, renal metabolites and myocardial proteins, indicating acute assaults to immune systems together with damages to major organs including liver, kidney and heart. All parameters (except Cr and CPK) showed significant difference between ICU and non-ICU patients, establishing them as prognostic markers for status of COVID-19 severity. This result is in concert with previous reports [1, 20] . However, none of those parameters suggested a difference between survivors and non-survivors in ICU group, except myocardial markers including TnT, CK and Mb.

In comparison, there were no significant difference between non-survival and survival groups for all other laboratory parameters (i.e., WBC, AST, etc.). Besides, the factors of patient age, gender and comorbidity did not contribute to make a noticeable difference between survival and non-survival outcome. Relationship between myocardial injury and prognosis for ICU patients was manifested in Figure 4, where percentages of patients with abnormal blood parameters in non-survival and survival group were plotted versus each other. Diagonal line presumed a hypothetically equal percentage in two groups, and around this diagonal were scattered and surrounded by routine parameters including WBC, neutrophils, ALT and AST, etc., which did not show significant difference between nonsurvival and survival; however, away from the diagonal, all serological parameters representative of abnormal myocardial metabolism (except LDH) in COVID-19 ICU patients portrayed a poor prognosis. The higher above the diagonal, the poorer prognosis to be expected. For example, for COVID-19",

Thereby the gas exchange could be gradually impaired at the interface of alveolo-capillary membrane, leading to fluid filling in alveolar units and eventual pulmonary edema, which posts a proof of severe pneumonia and a warning of respiratory failure. This echoes other radiological findings in COVID-19 patients where 61.1%-85.0% critically ill patients did not survive ARDS after mechanical ventilation [7, 20, 25-27]. In our study 15 (83.3%) out of 18 COVID-19 deceased cases suffered and died from respiratory failure (data not shown). Postmortem biopsy of one COVID-19 patient showed evident ARDS signs in both lungs, represented by diffuse alveolar damages, hyaline membrane formations, and viral cytopathic changes in the intra-alveolar space [28]. This pathological finding correlates the prevalence of ARDS-caused mortality in COVID-19 patients and postulated a possibility of viral invasion in deep lungs.",
