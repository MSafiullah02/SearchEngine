While medical researchers are working hard to find a cure and doctors/nurses to attend the affected individuals, measures such as 'lockdown', 'stay-at-home', 'social distancing' are being implemented in different parts of the world to curb its further spread. To model this spread which is assumed to be a non-stationary count-valued time series, we propose a novel time varying semiparametric AR(p) model for the count valued data of newly affected cases, collected every day. We calculate posterior contraction rate of the proposed Bayesian model. Our proposed structure of the model is amenable to Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) sampling for efficient computation. We show excellent performance in simulations. Our method is then applied on the daily time series data of newly confirmed cases to study its spread through different government interventions.",

Thus, this count-valued time-series of daily new cases of infection is expected to vary largely. While initially by the contagious nature these spread looks exponential, once some measures are undertaken the number of cases go down but at varying degrees depending on how strict was the enforcement, how dense is the population etc. There have been ample research study in a very short time to discuss effectiveness of lockdown and forecast of the future path of how the virus will spread. However, due to the lack of an inferential point of view in these research, all these projected path or analysis of past observed effects remain statistically unwarranted. SIR model (Song et al., 2020) , proportional model (Deb and Majumdar, 2020) , some Bayesian epidemic models (Clancy et al., 2008; Jewell et al., 2009) etc. have been used in the context of continuous modelling because it benefits time-series formulation and ready computation. Relatively straight-forward models are considered such as polynomial trends or presence of an ARMA structure etc. However, we wish to stick to the actual daily count of new affections and this brings us to an unique juncture of analyzing a count time series with smooth varying coefficients.",

This stream was furthered by Chan and Ledolter (1995) where Poisson generalized linear models (GLM) with an autoregressive latent process in the mean is discussed. A wide range of dependence was explored in Davis et al. (2003) for simple autoregressive (AR) structure and external covariates. On the other hand a different stream explored interger-valued time series counts such as ARMA structures as in (Brandt and Williams, 2001; Biswas and Song, 2009) or INGARCH structure as done in Zhu (2011 Zhu ( , 2012c . However, from a Bayesian perspective, only work to best of our knowledge is that of Silveira de Andrade et al. (2015) where the authors discussed an ARMA model for different count series parameters. However, their treatment of ignoring zero-valued data or putting the MA structure by demeaned Poisson random variable remains questionable. None of these works focused on time-varying nature of the coefficients except for a brief mention in Karmakar et al. (2020+) .",

Rapid change in the observed counts make all earlier time-constant analysis invalid and builds a path where we can explore methodological and inferencial development in tracking down the trajectory of this spread. We propose a novel semiparametric time varying autoregressive model for counts to study the spread and examine the effects of these interventions in the spread based on the time-varying coefficient functions. A time varying AR(p) process consists of a time-varying mean/intercept function along with time varying autoregressive coefficient functions.",

First, this modelling is to the best of our knowledge first such work for count time series with time-varying coefficients. The mean function stands for the overall spread and the autoregressive coefficients stand for different lags. Since this virus can be largely asymptomatic carrier for the first few days we wish to identify which lags are significant in our model which can be directly linked to how many days the symptom spread but did not show up. We show that for different areas lags 6 to 10 are significant. These findings are in-line with several research articles discussing the incubation length for the novel coronavirus with a median of 5-6 days and 98% below 11 days. For example see Lauer et al. (2020a) . A few province, state, countries have ordered lockdown or stay-at-home orders of various degree and we find that even after these orders are in effect it takes about 14-20 day to reach the peak and then the both the intercept and autoregressive coefficient function starts decreasing. This is also an interesting find which characterizes the fact that number of infected but asymptomatic cases are large compared to the new cases reported.",

            "text": "Finally, we want to highlight our contribution in proposing a Bayesian methodology inspired from B-spline series priors. These priors ensure high degree of smoothness on the coefficient functions. In Bayesian literature of non-linear function modeling, B-splines series based priors have been extensively developed under different shape constraints (He and Shi, 1998; Meyer, 2012; Das and Ghosal, 2017; Mulgrave et al., 2018; Roy et al., 2018) . To the best of our knowledge, there is no other work that puts (2.2)specific shape constraints, required for a time-varying AR using B-spline series. We also calculate posterior contraction rate based on minimal assumptions. Although, Poisson nonparametric regression is discussed in Ghosal and Van der Vaart (2017) , the most intuitive link functions that we consider here due to the autoregressive nature of the model are beyond the coverage of their book. We also discuss a pointwise inferential tool by drawing credible intervals. Such tools are important to keep an objective perspective in terms of the evolution of the time-varying coefficients without restricting it to some popular models. See Karmakar et al. (2020+) for a comprehensive discussion on timevarying models and its applications. In our present context, the number of affected can be covered by the popular SIR model in this case, however they assume additional structure on how these numbers evolve and then tries to estimate the rate. Instead, we do not assume any such specific evolution and offer a general perspective. Our simulation results corroborate consistent estimation of the unknown functions.",

Other provinces in China, listed down in Table 2 have implemented partial lockdowns. South korea and Singapore took an alternative measure to track the movements of all affected individuals and to conduct tests for COVID-19 for as many countrymen as possible. Due to the measures in Singapore from the very begining, the numbers never went up exponentially high even though the first reported case was recorded as early as January 23rd.

            "text": "In the COVID-19 dataset, we find that the mean function started to have downward slope around 12 days after the lockdown date both for Hubei, China and Italy. Other countries considered in this analysis have not been completely under lockdown. It suggests that the curve of daily new affected cases starts to flatten roughly after 12 days from the lockdown. For South Korea too, (Figure 7 ) it took around 10 days from the time they took up the aggressive testing strategy. Interestingly, for South Korea AR(1) coefficient function is significantly larger than other countries. This might be attributed to the aggressive testing strategy as well since all the individuals who came in contact with a newly affected individual in last couple of days were also identified and advised to have tested. Also interestingly, note that South Korea had a significantly low \u00b5(\u00b7) trend when the autoregressive components were high. These simultaneous interesting patterns is probably due to many small values in the beginning. Figure 9 and 10 show much larger derivative values for USA than all the other countries. This aligns with the sudden increase in number of confirmed cases near the end of March. Large estimated derivatives of the mean function as in Figure 11 show that the strict lockdown policy helped the number of new cases to come down to a level similar to the other provinces. However, Figure 12 show similar level of ranges in the derivatives of AR(1) coefficient functions for all the provinces in China. We also fit TVBARC(10) for some of the countries. We find that the most significant lag for most of the countries is at around 6 or 7. This aligns with the current study on incubation period of COVID-19 (Lauer et al., 2020b) . In the Figure of the derivative of \u00b5, the rate of increase in USA is the highest among all the other place due to the current shift of epicenter to NYC. 640  631  0  Jiangxi  936  934  1  Jilin  95  92  1  Liaoning  128  124  2  Macau  31  10  0  Ningxia  75  75  0  Qinghai  18  18  0  Shaanxi  253  242  3  Shandong  771  752  7  Shanghai  451  331  5  Shanxi  135  133  0  Sichuan  547  536  3  Tianjin  151  133  3  Tibet  1  1  0  Xinjiang  76  73  3  Yunnan  178  172  2  Zhejiang  1243 1222 1 (a) Italy-\u00b5(\u00b7) function (b) Italy-a 1 (\u00b7) function We summarize our main findings from the analysis of COVID-19 datasets here. First we address the time-varying nature of the dataset that takes care of not only how the virus spreads but also different executive restrictions or government interference. It is a difficult task to pour in other covariates as first it is debatable exactly what to include and second different countries, province even the residents probably behave differently. To keep the flexibility of how the numbers evolve outside the autoregressive effects we choose to keep a mean/intercept coefficient \u00b5(\u00b7). With that model set-up we analyze many different countries and provinces of China. We find out interesting similarities between how the \u00b5(\u00b7) behaves over time and see that typically there is a downward trend after a period of around 12 days after lockdown measures have been enforced. However for the AR(1) coefficient, the trends often show multiple peaks probably due to the asymptomatic spreading capability of the virus. On the same note, another interesting find is to see how we find lag number 6-7th to be important in majority of the cases conforming to the facts published about the incubation period length of coronavirus. Note that, we also provide statistically valid pointwise confidence intervals instead of restricting ourselves to a certain type of polynomial or exponential trend and then testing for it.",

            "text": "As a future work, it will be interesting to include some country specific information such as demographic information, geographical area, effect of environmental time-series etc in the model. These are usually important factors for the spread of any infectious disease. We can also categorize different type of government intervention effects to elaborate more on specific impacts of the same. In the future we wish to analyze the number of deaths, number of recovered cases, number of severe/critical cases etc. for these diseases as those will hopefully have a different dynamics than the one considered here and can provide useful insights about the spread and measures required. For computational ease, we have considered same level of smoothness for all the coefficient functions. Fitting this model with different level of smoothness might be able to provide more insights. Other than building time-varying autoregessive models for positive-valued data using the hierarchical structure from this article, one interesting future direction is to extend this model for vector-valued count data. In general, it is difficult to model multivariate count data. There are only a limited number of methods to deal with multivariate count data (Besag, 1974; Yang et al., 2013; Roy and Dunson, 2019) . Building on these multivariate count data models, one can extend our time-varying univariate AR(p) to a time-varying vector-valued AR(p). On the same note, even though we imposed Poisson assumption for increased model interpretation, in the light of the upper bounds for the KL distance, it is not a necessary criterion and can be applied to a general multiple non-stationary count time-series. Extending some of the continuous time-series invariance results from Karmakar and Wu (2020) to multiple count time-series will be an interesting challenge.",

Estimated AR coefficient functions until lag 10 for USA and Italy.7 Discussion and ConclusionWe propose a time-varying Bayesian autoregressive model for counts (TVBARC) with linear link function with Poisson to study the time series of daily new confirmed cases of COVID-19. We develop a novel hierarchical Bayesian model that satisfies the stability condition for time varying autoregessive model and propose HMC algorithm based MCMC sampling scheme. We establish a posterior contraction rate result of the proposed Bayesian method. The 'R' function with a example code can be found at https://https://github.com/royarkaprava/TVBARC. Relaying on the proposed hierarchical Bayesian model, one can develop a time-varying Bayesian model for positivevalued time-series data too.",

Due to time varying nature of the coefficient with an AR(1) structure, we could not bound above KL directly using Lemma 2.9 of Ghosal and Van der Vaart (2017) type results that are used for nonparametric Poisson models. Thus, we consider Assumption A.3 to tackle this complicated structure.Proceeding with the rest of the proof of Theorem 1, we use the results of B-Splines,We also have, Consider the following sieve for the parameter space W T = {K 1 , K 2 , \u03b1 :Then the T -entropy of the sieve is bounded by a constant multiple of (K 1T + K 2T ) log T . The prior on K 1 and K 2 satisfy the condition A1 from Chapter 10.4 of Ghosal and Van der Vaart (2017) and the induced prior on \u03b1 is log-normal which satisfies A2 and A3. The H\u00f6lder smooth functions with regularity \u03b9 can be approximatedly uniformly up to order K \u2212\u03b9 with K many B-splines. Thus we have T max{K \u2212\u03b91 1T , K \u2212\u03b92 2T } Now we use Lemma 10.20. As overall concentration can not be better that T \u22121/2 , we assume log(1/ T ) log T .Then the probability on an 2 T -sized around the truth within the sieve W T can be lower bounded by K T +J T T . Also T -entropy of the sieve is bounded by (K 1T +K 2T ) log T using Lemma 10.20. Using the same Lemma we get the upper bound of prior probability in the complement of sieve. It will be exp[\u2212b 12 K 1T (log K 1T ) b13 \u2212 b 22 K 2T (log K 1T ) b23 ] for K 1T and K 2T . For \u03b8 it will be K 1T exp(\u2212bT 2 ) for some constant b. To satisfy the conditions from general theory of posterior contraction, we haveFollowing the steps given after Theorem 10.21, we calculate T equal to max T \u2212\u03b91/(2\u03b91+1) (log T ) \u03b91/(2\u03b91+1)+(1\u2212b13)/2 , T \u2212\u03b92/(2\u03b92+1) (log T ) \u03b92/(2\u03b92+1)+(1\u2212b23)/2 .",
