Many of the discussions have been over preserving public access to basic research assets, such as basic biological research materials and genomic databases. The debate has been accentuated by the profound changes in the organisational structure and the funding of life science research infrastructures, especially since the early 1990s, when the commercial promise of genomics became apparent, and private funding for genomics in for-profit companies began to accelerate (Cook-Deegan and Dedeurwaerdere, 2006).",

This paper aims to contribute to the understanding of these changes by focusing on a case study within the particular field of microbiology. The reason for this choice is double. First, the international network of public culture collections historically has been one of the first global research infrastructures providing public access to basic biological research materials (Stern, 2004, Reichman et al., 2013), held in a distributed network of collections throughout the world (Smith, 2003). Second, the importance of these public collections has grown over the last two decades, with their transformation to multi-service biological resources centres, which provide expertise in genetics and bioinformatics, in addition to their traditional taxonomic expertise (OECD, 2001). As a result, the network of public microbial collections has increasingly evolved from purely governmental institutions to a heterogeneous group encompassing both public sector and private sector funding strategies. Therefore, culture collections is an interesting case of a research infrastructure providing publicly available knowledge assets, whose organisational structure is increasingly based on public-private economic interdependencies (please refer to the electronic supplement for additional background to PSMCs).",

However, two important features are specific to the microbial collections. First, microbial organisms have an extremely high genetic variation within species and very high mutation rates upon reproduction. As a result, there is no equivalent to the relatively well-defined species concept for plants and animals. Therefore microbial science depends on the in vitro organisms held in the microbial ex situ collections. This explains the importance of a broad range of wild biodiversity held and still massively collected by the microbial collections, while the ex situ conservation efforts in the agricultural plant and animal collections that have been the focus of previous studies the main focus is on domesticated varieties and breeds (Halewood, 2010) Second, the public microbial collections provide on average a comparable amount of materials to public sector and private sector entities in the life sciences. This hybrid character of the distribution practices of the public microbial collections makes this case a rich source for quantitative analysis of conservation and distribution strategies in life science research infrastructures.",

In particular the paper aims to analyse core aspects of the economic and institutional conditions that contribute to PSMCs\u2019 conservation of microbial material and its distribution as publicly available basic knowledge assets for life science research. It is expected that this analysis will contribute to the design of strategies that secure the sustained long term conservation of microbial material with public good properties. This seems especially relevant in the context of uncertainty created by recent changes in the institutional landscape in which PSMCs operate, for instance due to the stress on public funding for basic research and infrastructures, and the increasing commercial interest by the industry in microbial resources generally.",

These results call into question the role of markets alone or pure public funding alone for assuring the provision of publicly available biological resources in a globalised research context.",

For instance, market oriented policy planners in the USA and elsewhere have realised the opportunity to diminish time laps between basic research findings and commercialised products (Rai, 1999; Bartsev, Pers. Comm.). This has come timely because financial pressure among PSMC have mounted under rapidly accumulating stocks of microbes, while governments\u2019 finances are undergoing increasing stress (Baker, 2004): a major challenge is associated with the high costs that are incurred in the conservation, quality management and documentation of microbial strains. For instance it is estimated that one million USD are needed for creating a new collection of about five thousand strains, excluding the costs of long term maintenance and use (Baker, 2004). In this context, the income generated by the selling of microbial strains is an important source of income that complements other non-governmental sources of income, including contract research, identification services, and, where this applies, income from patent and safety deposits as found in this paper (see Section 3). Hence, new conditions have been created for private cost sharing of public collections (Furman and Stern, 2006).",

Table 2\n). Further, while some collections were created with the explicit aim of having many TS (Smith, Pers.

Hence, TS can be regarded as a hybrid material/informational good, with public good characteristics associated both to the material itself and to the informational content. As biological resources, TS hold properties that are similar to those of a public good, since TS are characterised by relatively low rivalry in use since a similar strain can be cultivated from the original strain.5\nThe information content of TS is of course non rival in the sense that usage does not reduce the information content. While their biological component is characterised by relatively low cost of exclusion since access is conditioned on consent from the holder of the TS, such as a PSMC, the information content related to the properties of TS has very low exclusion. That is, in order to achieve a broad diffusion and to capture coordination benefits, information content of TS is placed in the public domain, such as in scientific journals and PSMCs\u2019 internet portals.

For such research collections, moderate support from the government and the private sector for TS conservation is expected to be important as well.

This indicates a role of private funding in the provision of TS. However, this is a nonlinear effect. The data suggest that it is a mix of public-private funding strategy that characterises those collections that may prioritise investment in TS. This result is consistent with previous conclusions from crop breeding analyses (Gollin et al., 2000, Visser et al., 2000). In line with public good theory as well as search theory, society relies on public investment for the provision of diversity of biological research materials that otherwise would be underprovided by markets alone. The role of industry is probably to provide cost-sharing to the costly enterprise of holding such microbes, as a means to secure access to such resources.",

Additionally, we can see that a formal transfer mode by charging a fee is associated with specialisation in TS. To the extent that TS are public goods, as argued here, this result indicates that more business like ways of handling research materials have gained a strong influence in public good microbe holdings.

The same outcomes are shown for low public funding. The remaining funding variables do not have statistically significant effects. This reflects a diversified funding strategy for industry oriented collections. Specifically, such outcome indicates that a strong public service mandate, as reflected by heavy public funding, is associated with an orientation towards other users than the private industry. Notably, even if all PSMCs to some extent belong to the basic research infrastructure, at least half of the PSMCs in the dataset receive also private funding. Such cost-sharing appears to play an important role in conservation because it is associated with both large collections, and collections which specialise in TS.",

As expected, the scale or size of the collection (the variable STOCK) and sourcing of microbes (the variable INFLOW) foremost included for the conservation regression have no meaningful statistically significant effect on the industry orientation. However, the variable denoting a higher relative provision of microbes to academia and hospitals (the variable FLOWACAD) is statistically significant and indicates that industry in contrast to other sectors have structurally different preferences and needs. For instance, it is not necessarily the case that whichever high demand for microbes from a PSMC, irrespective of the type of demander, signals that the collection also attracts demand from industry. Rather, more traditional users such as academia and hospitals may have different preferences than industry, related to issues such as institutional arrangements regarding microbe transfers or the content and quality of microbes and associated information.",

Based on a unique world-wide survey of culture collections the paper provides novel insights about the way that public-service microbial collections constitute a highly heterogeneous group of organisations, how the evolving funding mechanisms relate to their conservation of publicly available microbial resources, and to the distribution patterns of microbial resources to private sector and public sector recipients. Moreover, in order to cast further light on the important question of private influence on public goods, microorganisms with particularly strong public good properties are contrasted to other microorganisms.
