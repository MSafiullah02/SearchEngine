Next, the adhesive foam was cut into a 12-inch long strip. We attached the sticky side to the inner circumference of the frame (Figure 2 ). The foam acts as a cushion and prevents abrasions of the user's forehead with extended wear. Using a hole puncher, we punched 3 holes, 4-inches apart on the wide side of the transparency films. Finally, each hole fit snugly into one the 3 rounded projections along the frame (Figure 2 ).",

Maintaining a good balance between printing time and quality is important; adjusting the above parameters should be done with caution in order to maintain the quality of the final 3D object. Increasing extruded layer height or having larger nozzle will decrease the printing time. Our printer's speed was 80-100mm/s. In order to print multiple frames during same time interval (i.e. decrease the production time), we stacked frames on top of each other and then individually separating them ( Figure 3 ). In our project, the required production time was 5 hours. Other designs production time varied from 3.5 to 9.5 hours depending on the size of the original design.",
