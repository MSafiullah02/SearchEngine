The innate immune system reacts promptly to invading pathogens and instructs antigen presenting cells (APCs) to activate and secrete cytokines that, among other things, regulate T- and B cells towards an appropriate adaptive effector phenotype. Activation of APCs in response to pathogenic stimuli is mediated by unique pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs) and results in the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and co-stimulatory molecules which participate in the activation of the adaptive immune response [1], [2], [3]. Several soluble PRRs have been characterized as LPS-binding proteins, collectins, pentraxins and alternative pathway complement components in addition to cell-associated receptors like C-type lectins, scavenger receptors, Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and various intracellular receptors. Many PRRs are highly conserved and provide the cornerstones upon which the antimicrobial immune response is built. Moreover, vaccine-induced protective immunity can be regulated by PRR stimulation by pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMP) in order to perform the \u201cadjuvant effect\u201d which is central to successful vaccinations.",

            "text": "The serum protein mannose-binding lectin (MBL) is an important soluble PRR that belongs to the C-type collectin family. MBL binds to mannose and other sugar residues present on the cell wall of bacteria, viruses and parasites with high affinity [4]. As these sugars do not naturally occur in higher organisms, MBL represents an important mechanism for discrimination between pathogens and host. MBL exhibits a number of innate immunological properties. By binding to, e.g. microbial cell wall antigens, MBL can act as an opsonin and mediate phagocytosis directly through MBL receptors expressed on the surface of neutrophils and monocytes [5], [6], [7]. Alternatively, MBL can activate the complement system through the \u2018lectin pathway\u2019 causing pathogen lysis or phagocytosis via complement receptors on phagocytic cells. In addition, MBL is important for the removal of circulating immune complexes. Knowledge of the functional role of MBL in the immunity of both humans and animals is increasing [8], [9], [10], [11], [12]. Individuals with MBL deficiency are reported more susceptible to viral and bacterial infections as well as autoimmune diseases especially during the early neonatal period or when rendered neutropenic from chemotherapy [13], [14]. It has also been shown that MBL deficiency in humans has a genetic basis [15], [16], [17], [18].",

We have also shown that low MBL concentration is associated with increased numbers of Pasteurella multocida in the spleen in a non-selected exotic breed after an infection [21]. Finally, preliminary results with the parasite Ascaridia galli showed that the parasite egg burden post infection was higher in birds with low serum MBL concentration (unpublished). These results confirm that MBL, as proven in mammals, plays a major role in the outcome of various infections in chickens.",

Recently, this was also shown in mouse models where the specific IgG response was increased in MBL-deficient mice following immunization with a Group B streptococcus vaccine [23] and in double MBL knockout mice injected with soluble hepatitis B surface antigen [24]. These results suggest that MBL influences the production of specific antibodies either by directing the immune response into a more cellular response (Th1 vs. Th2) by neutralizing the microorganism via the complement membrane-attack complex, and/or by inhibiting the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines via interaction with other surface receptors [13]. The latter has been shown in a human whole-blood model where a low concentration of MBL enhances the cytokine production and a high concentration suppresses the cytokine production [25].",

In the future, this will be an important issue as breeding companies currently focus on selection markers that belong to the innate part of the immune system in their effort to produce more robust animals [26]. Improvement of genetically determined disease resistance is an attractive and inexpensive approach to improve the health status of our production animals. Therefore, the challenge in future vaccination strategies is to choose the optimal adjuvant design for innate robust animals.

The addition of mannose to the vaccine did not alter its capacity to induce protective immunity since no replicating virus was found in samples from the vaccinated group after infection with the IBV strain M41 even though we used a very high dose of virus for the challenge. Recently, new field strains of IBV have been isolated in domestic poultry in China (QX) and Europe (QX-like IBV) causing severe losses to both the layer and the broiler industry [29] because vaccination is no longer fully protective against these new strains. With hindsight, one of these strains may have been a better choice as challenge virus since both groups of animals were protected against infection with the M41 strain. In order to detect any effect of MBL and mannose in relation to vaccine-induced protection against IBV, a more virulent strain should therefore be used in further experiments.",

            "text": "By analogy with previous results [19], the MBL acute phase response was observed after IBV vaccination and infection followed by a decrease to below the baseline level [19] (Fig. 2). In the present study, this response was most pronounced in group 1 which was only challenge-infected. The acute phase response was much weaker after the challenge infection in the two vaccinated groups (groups 2 and 3) probably due to the adaptive memory response. No influence of mannose addition to the vaccine was observed for serum MBL levels. The decrease in serum MBL after the vaccination or the infection to below the baseline level may be due to a feedback mechanism from other parts of the immune system. This feedback mechanism may have occurred at the MBL transcriptional level, or alternatively by transfer of MBL from the blood to infected tissues thereby lowering the concentration of MBL in the blood as proposed by Valdimarsson et al. [30] or simply because MBL has been used for opsonization and thus has been engulfed by phagocytic cells. The decrease was then followed by an increase to above baseline level in all three groups which we have no explanation for. Age can be left out as an explanation at least after the vaccination since there was no increase in the mock-vaccinated group.",

In this study, we found no difference between the specific antibody titers in H- and L-chickens in group 1 after infection. This difference may be attributed to the time point chosen for termination of the experiment, i.e. too early, or the titer of the virus (it was calculated to 106.5\n ELD), i.e. too high, On the other hand, we did find differences between the two sub-lines in group 3, which received mannose together with the vaccine, both PV and PI (Fig. 3). H-chickens receiving mannose in combination with the vaccine showed very low specific IBV IgG antibody titers compared to L-chickens in the same treatment group, whereas the titers of L- and H-chickens were very similar in group 2 that did not receive mannose. This indicates that high serum levels of MBL influence the production of specific antibodies and that addition of mannose to such high birds MBL with high MBL-levels alters their antibody production in a negative way. Likewise, one may likewise speculate that in birds with constant low levels of serum MBL compensatory mechanisms for induction and regulation of antibody responses are activated and therefore mannose addition does not affect antibody production in L-chicken. The direct involvement of other mannose specific receptors can be ruled out since no difference was found in the L-chickens from groups 2 and 3 presuming that these receptors are genetically identical in the two sub-lines.",

DC-SIGN is known to bind to different pathogens and triggers intracellular signaling cascades that affect TLR signaling and thereby adaptive immune responses (reviewed in [32]). The specific modulation of the immune responses is dependent on the pathogen involved and can lead to the inhibition or promotion of T helper type 1 (Th1) polarization, Th2 responses and/or induction of regulatory T cell differentiation [33]. In chickens it has been shown that the S protein of IBV alone is sufficient to induce protection [34].",

However, it should be mentioned that even though the H-chickens have a very low specific antibody titer in this study, the chickens were protected against the infection as no M41 virus was replicating in the OPA (Fig. 1) indicating that antibodies may not be decisive for protection against IBV as previously suggested by others [36].",

Within these populations the majority of the CD8\u03b1+high cells in the circulation are \u03b1\u03b2 T-cell receptor (TCR) T-cells expressing the CD8\u03b1\u03b2 heterodimer on their surfaces (Fig. 4a), i.e. they have the cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) phenotype. The CD4+ cells are considered \u201cclassical\u201d T-helper cells, whereas the majority of the CD8+dim positive cells also carry the CD4 molecule on the cell surface and hence are double CD4CD8 positive \u03b1\u03b2 TCR T-cells expressing the CD8\u03b1\u03b1 homodimer. The function of the latter population is still unknown in the chicken but in the pig they have been identified as memory cells [37]. In the circulation, chicken CD4\u2212CD8\u2212 is dominated by \u03b3\u03b4 TCR expressing T-cells [38], [39]. Chickens belong to a group of animals that can have 20\u201350% of \u03b3\u03b4 T-cells in the circulation [40], which suggests that \u03b3\u03b4 T-cells play an important role in the chicken immune system. However, the function of chicken \u03b3\u03b4 T-cells is still largely unknown, but in vitro studies have shown that they can have cytotoxic and immuno-regulatory properties. Moreover, it is not known if chicken \u03b3\u03b4 T-cells recognize classical peptide MHC antigens or bind to alternative antigens. In mammals, the function of \u03b3\u03b4 T-cells is likewise not firmly identified; studies in humans [41] and cattle [42] have for instance revealed the existence of several subpopulations of \u03b3\u03b4 T-cells, that recognize both MHC and non-MHC-associated antigens. These studies have suggested a number of functions such as killer cells, classical T cells with central memory, immune-modulators through cytokine production and as antigen presenting cells.",

This increase in CD4\u2212CD8\u2212 cells was most pronounced in those H-chicken where mannose was added to the vaccine (group 3). Interestingly, it has recently been shown in humans that \u03b3\u03b4 T-cells can proliferate, express memory markers, and produce cytokines in response to infection with Candida albicans which contains mannose structures [41]. Our results (Fig. 3, Fig. 4) indicate a role of CD4\u2212CD8\u2212 \u03b3\u03b4 T-cells in the defense against IBV especially in chickens with low levels of specific antibodies to the virus, e.g. as killer cells. An alternative explanation is that the CD8\u03b1+high \u03b1\u03b2 T-cells, i.e. CTL's, in these chickens have been translocated from the circulation to the respiratory organs, because it has been shown by adoptive transfer that \u03b1\u03b2 T-cells bearing CD8 molecules are critical in protecting chickens from IBV infections [36]. This could, however, be addressed by absolute rather that relative counting the different T-cell subtypes in the blood which will be obvious to do in the next experiment.",

These results indicate that MBL is involved in the regulation of the adaptive immune response to IBV. MBL should therefore be considered when designing future vaccines in relation to inhibition or promotion of T-helper type 1 (Th1) polarization, Th2 responses and/or induction of \u03b3\u03b4 T-cells.
