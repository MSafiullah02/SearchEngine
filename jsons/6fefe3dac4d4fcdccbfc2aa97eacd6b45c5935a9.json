For instance, disease outbreaks have contributed to several near extinctions and population crashes (see references in Woodroffe 1999; de Castro and Bolker 2004) , directly and indirectly threatening wildlife populations by killing hosts faster than replacement, an outcome that makes small populations vulnerable to stochastic extinction (Woodroffe 1999) . Generalist pathogens may pose the greatest risk to threatened wild populations because they can remain at high prevalence in numerous host species, lowering a pathogen's density threshold for transmission in small populations, which themselves are not dense enough for disease transmission (Lyles and Dobson 1993; Woodroffe 1999) . The threat of infectious disease and pathogen-mediated population declines is compounded in threatened and endangered populations because they are small and often lack the genetic variability necessary to combat virulent pathogens (Spielman et al. 2004) , making disease monitoring a necessary component of conservation programs.",

For example, the catastrophic canine distemper virus (CDV) epizootic in wild endangered black-footed ferrets (Mustela nigripes) was likely transmitted by sympatric coyotes or badgers (Taxidea taxus- Williams et al. 1988) . Similarly, dense populations of domestic dogs (Canis lupus familiaris) act as rabies vectors for endangered Ethiopian wolves (Canis simensis- Randall et al. 2004) . Generalist viral pathogens like CDV or rabies are most often responsible for disease-driven population declines, but other pathogenic groups, such as bacteria, helminths, arthropods, or protozoa, can also be detrimental for small populations (Pedersen et al. 2007 ). Although such pathogens are generally not lethal on their own, co-infections combined with stressful situations could reduce individual fitness and negatively affect population growth, as well as reduce juvenile survival (Forrester 1971) . Inbreeding and reduced genetic variation can also interact with sublethal parasites to decrease fitness, as observed in an inbred population of Soay sheep (Ovis aries), where individuals with low genetic variation had more gastrointestinal parasites and lower survival rates during harsh winters than more genetically diverse sheep (Coltman et al. 1999) .",

            "text": "Among mammals, carnivores are particularly susceptible to disease, with the highest number of species threatened by pathogens found in the canid family (Pedersen et al. 2007 ). Canid social behavior may explain their heightened susceptibility to pathogens as they commonly lick each other, smell and eat feces, and smell urine that may be infectious (Woodroffe et al. 2004 ). Other disease risk factors for wild canids include their close genetic relatedness to domestic dogs, which are globally distributed and harbor diseases easily transmissible to wild canids, their trophic position, which can expose canids to infected prey (Woodroffe et al. 2004) , and their low population size. These various risk factors emphasize how disease can contribute to population declines and local extinction in canids, the best documented examples of which include: rabies in African wild dogs (Lycaon pictus- Gascoyne et al. 1993) , gray wolves (Canis lupus -Chapman 1978; Ballard and Krausman 1997) , and Ethiopian wolves (C. simensis- Sillero-Zubiri et al. 1996; Randall et al. 2004 ); canine parvovirus (CPV) and CDV in gray wolves (Johnson et al. 1994; Mech and Goyal 1995) ; and sarcoptic mange (caused by the mite Sarcoptes scabiei) in arctic foxes (Vulpes lagopus semenovi- Goltsman et al. 1996; Ploshnitsa et al. 2011 ). In the United States, the red wolf (Canis rufus), one of the most endangered canids in the world, is emblematic of the need to evaluate and incorporate disease in canid species management.",

            "text": "Historically, red wolves were abundant throughout the eastern and southeastern United States, but populations were decimated in the 20th century due to habitat loss, intense predator control programs, hybridization, and disease, and the species was declared extinct in the wild by 1980 (Phillips and Parker 1988; Hinton et al. 2013 ). In the 1970s, the last remnant red wolves were trapped from southwestern Louisiana and southeastern Texas to start a captive breeding program. Two populations of red wolves were reintroduced, one in northeastern North Carolina (1987) and one in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park, Tennessee (1991). In 1998, Tennessee restoration efforts were discontinued due to poor pup survival associated with malnutrition and possibly parasites and CPV infections (Henry 1998 Red wolf viability had already been critically affected by disease in the remnant Louisiana-Texas population and the Smoky Mountain site, and contemporary wild red wolves in North Carolina could be vulnerable as well. North Carolina red wolves may be at risk for disease-driven declines because they persist in one small population, are inbred (Brzeski et al. 2014) , and co-occur with high population density species, such as domestic dogs and coyotes (Canis latrans), that can be infected with the same pathogens and act as pathogen reservoirs (Eads 1948; Almberg et al. 2009 ). Coyotes are of particular concern because they hybridize and interact with red wolves, and although hybridization is effectively controlled by management (Stoskopf et al. 2005; Gese et al. 2015) , their frequent interaction could increase disease transmission to red wolves. Additionally, coyotes may expose red wolves to new diseases that they carry into the recovery area from surrounding regions (Hinton et al. 2012) and from elsewhere in the southeast where coyotes have been moved by humans (Hill et al. 1987) .",

Yet, vaccines may not adequately protect red wolves because they are administered opportunistically, only a small fraction of the coyote population is vaccinated, and the efficacy of domestic dog vaccines for wild species is uncertain (Harrenstien et al. 1997; Acton et al. 2000; Acton 2008 ). For instance, initial vaccines are administered to wolves around 9-12 months of age, leaving younger pups exposed to infection after losing maternal antibodies around 5 months of age (Johnson et al. 1994) . Another possible threat is the emergence of new vaccine-resistant viral strains, a scenario observed in Africa when a virulent new bio-type of CDV was responsible for mortality among Serengeti lions (Panthera leo- Roelke-Parker et al. 1996) .",

Evaluating pathogen loads and diversity in red wolves and sympatric coyotes, and the factors that influence disease infection are needed to inform any disease prevention plan in the recovery area. The first steps for assessing disease risk factors include an evaluation of past red wolf disease and disease occurrence in the region surrounding the North Carolina population to identify potential threats already present on the landscape. Additionally, collecting contemporary disease data on both red wolves and sympatric coyotes will establish baseline parasite prevalence and diversity and reveal differences and similarities between the species' pathogens. To accomplish these goals, we 1) reviewed past disease occurrences in wild and captive red wolves, 2) reviewed wildlife disease literature from the southeastern United States to evaluate broadly the regional disease occurrence in mammals, and 3) collected contemporary parasite data from wild red wolves and sympatric coyotes to examine current baseline infection patterns.",

Explanatory variables for each model included age class, sex, species, and year collected with a random effect of region captured (coyotes) or pack (wolves). We included random effects to control for nonindependence between individuals from the same pack or trapping region. We defined age classes as pup (less than 12 months old), juvenile (greater than 12 months but under 2 years), and adult (greater than 2 years); we determined age by date of birth for wolves and based estimated ages on tooth wear (Gier 1975 ) and sexual maturity for coyotes. We ran 12 a priori candidate model sets, including a null and global model (Supporting Information S1-8), separately for each of the following response variables: endoparasite counts (tally of infectious species, weighted by infection level), heartworm presence, ectoparasite loads, and any other pathogenic parasite (either individual endoparasite species or tick-borne bacteria) with an observed infection rate above 10%. We evaluated the probability of specific endoparasite species, heartworm, and tick-borne bacteria using GLMMs with a logit-link function and binomial error distribution; models with ectoparasite loads were evaluated using CLMMs with a log-link function. We assessed endoparasite counts using GLMMs with a log-link function and Poisson distribution. All models were ranked with AIC c and AIC c weight (w i - Burnham and Anderson 2002) and validated by examining residuals and fitted values as suggested by Zuur et al. (2009) . We averaged models within \u03942 AIC c of the top model using the naturalaverage method (Burnham and Anderson 2002) in R package MuMIn (Barto\u0144 2009 ); we also used analysis of variance to evaluate if additional variables significantly improved model fit. Given that adult heartworm prevalence was high, we evaluated if adult red wolves were more likely to have heartworm than adult coyotes with Fisher's exact test; we were unable to test this with GLMMs given small sample sizes (adult red wolves tested for heartworm = 13, adult coyotes tested for heartworm = 10).",

All 3 parasites were considered limiting factors to red wolf survival and may have affected morbidity and mortality significantly (Riley and McBride 1972; Carley 1975; Custer and Pence 1981b) . Hookworm infections were especially high in pups and juveniles and may have been a leading cause of juvenile mortality (Custer and Pence 1981a) . The severity of heartworm infections increased with age (Custer and Pence 1981b) , resulting in pathological responses such as enlarged and deformed hearts, and increasing stressinduced mortality that healthy wolves would likely have survived (Riley and McBride 1972; Carley 1975) . Sarcoptic mange was the most serious ectoparasite; infections were so numerous that by the 1970s, 90% of observed red wolves were at least partially devoid of hair (Riley and McBride 1972) . Other detected parasites included tapeworm (Taenia sp.), demodectic mange mites (Demodex sp.), spiny headed worms (class Archiacanthocephala), flatworms (Heterobilharzia americana), several species of ticks (Amblyomma sp., Ixodes scapularis), and 1 louse (Trichodectes canis- Riley and McBride 1972; Custer and Pence 1981a; Pence et al. 1981) .",

No captive red wolves had heartworm, and only 1 of 7 tested wild wolves was heartworm positive. Wild adult wolves, however, had been regularly treated with ivermectin, a heartworm prophylactic, prior to release. Captive red wolves had fewer endoparasites (48% infected) than wild wolves (67% infected), but both were infected with several different intestinal parasites including hookworms (both wild and captive wolves), ascarids (more common in captive wolves and only found in pups), whipworms (wild only), and tape-worms (both wild and captive wolves-Phillips and Scheck 1991). Phillips and Scheck (1991) suggested that hookworm was the only parasite occurring at high enough frequencies to be of concern to red wolf health. Three tick species, American dog tick (Dermacentor variabilis), lone star tick (Amblyomma americanum), and black legged tick (I. scapularis), were detected on wild and captive wolves (Phillips and Scheck 1991) . Since reintroductions, several tick related illnesses have been detected in wild wolves. Tick paralysis may have occurred in a female red wolf from North Carolina and was positively observed in 1 male, who recovered fully once ticks were removed (Beyer and Grossman 1997) . Several red wolves housed at the Great Smoky Mountains National Park were serologically positive for the bacteria causing Lyme disease (B. burgdorferi); one positive wolf also exhibited B. burgdorferi clinical symptoms, including decreased appetite, weight loss, and carpal lesions (Penrose et al. 2000) . Acton (2008) evaluated CPV2 and CDV prevalence in northeastern North Carolina carnivores, including red wolves, and assessed vaccine efficacy. Based on samples collected from 2000 to 2006, red wolves and coyotes were naturally exposed to both CPV2 and CDV, but North Carolina canid titers were lower than those for other wild canid populations (Acton 2008) . CDV vaccines appeared to elicit 100% seroconversion, or the development of detectable vaccine antibodies, but CPV2 vaccines did not reliably elicit seroconversion (Acton 2008) . This is similar to results reported by Harrenstien et al. (1997) , where red wolf response to CPV2 vaccines was minimal. Based on seroprevalence, poor vaccine efficacy, and neonatal antibody assays, Acton (2008) suggested that CPV2 may contribute to juvenile mortality in wild red wolves. A recent study by Anderson et al. (2014) found 100% and 96.9% of captive wolves had positive CPV and CDV vaccine titers, respectively, 3 years after vaccination, but this was after a full juvenile vaccination series and a 1 year booster, which wild canids usually do not receive. Seroconversion for canine adenovirus was sporadic (Anderson et al. 2014) .",

Interactions between coyotes and red wolves may facilitate disease transmission between the species, leading to the introduction of new pathogens to the red wolf population. This could affect long-term population recovery because small, endangered populations like red wolves are likely to be immunologically na\u00efve and lack the genetic variation necessary to combat new diseases (Spielman et al. 2004 ). Interestingly, coyotes and red wolves did not significantly differ in their probability of infection in any of the parasites we evaluated (Table 2) , with the exception that adult red wolves were more susceptible to heartworm than coyotes and twice as many coyotes tested positive for the bacteria causing Lyme disease. Perhaps differences in red wolf and coyote diet, foraging behavior, or habitat preference cause differential exposure to the heartworm and Lyme disease vectors: mosquitoes and Ixodes ticks, respectively.

Pups (under 12 months) and juveniles (between 12 and 24 months) were more likely than adults (over 24 months) to have higher endoparasite loads. Mange epizootics likely do not have long-term demographic effects for common species like coyotes or foxes but can be devastating to small populations such as red wolves because the loss of just a few individuals can reduce population growth (Pence and Ueckermann 2002) or even lead to local extinction (Henriksen et al. 1993; Ploshnitsa et al. 2011) . Treatment of mange is difficult in wild animals because it requires capturing and administering ivermectin to both infected individuals and those they contacted (Bornstein et al. 2001 ) but would be warranted for red wolves if a mange epizootic occurred since there have been 46 cases of mange infections successfully treated in wild red wolves.",

Although currently these viruses do not appear to be epizootic within the southeast region (although see Dyer et al. 2013; Supporting Information S9) , the red wolf population may be at risk. Wild red wolves and sympatric coyotes have been exposed to both CPV and CDV in North Carolina (Acton 2008) , where at least one red wolf death was attributed to CPV. Red wolves can mount a positive serological response to CPV and CDV vaccines, but the efficacy of opportunistic vaccinations in the wild population is not well established (Acton 2008; Anderson et al. 2014) .",

Vaccines and other interventions such as ivermectin for mange could have negative evolutionary consequences in wild populations because selection pressures for immunity may be weakened with continued treatment. Opportunistic vaccines and treatments that do not provide life-long immunity could also result in multiple individuals becoming susceptible to disease simultaneously, increasing the risk of an epizootic (Woodroffe 1999) . The potential drawbacks of vaccines and medical intervention need to be considered by managers and the risk of infection found sufficient to justify intensive prevention efforts. For red wolves, the very real risk of extinction due to their extremely small population size outweighs the potential negative effects of intervention, especially for virulent viral pathogens such as rabies and treatable conditions like mange. As the red wolf population prevalence among endangered wild red wolves (Canis rufus) and sympatric coyotes (Canis latrans) in northeastern North Carolina. Adults (older than 2 years) were more likely than pups (under 12 months) or juveniles (between 12 and 24 months) to be heartworm positive; adult red wolves may also be more susceptible than adult coyotes to heartworm.",

The most prevalent parasites detected in red wolves during our 2013-2014 sampling were hookworm (Ancylostoma spp.) and heartworm (D. immitis), both of which were widespread throughout southeastern wildlife as well; positive infection rates were 94% and 45%, respectively. Hookworm increased pup mortality in the remnant Louisiana and Texas population (Custer and Pence 1981a) and remains a management concern due to its current prevalence rate and high loads in young wolves (Fig. 2) . High heartworm prevalence may be a more immediate threat because heartworm infections have caused the death of at least nine red wolves and adults may be especially susceptible to them (Fig. 3) . Compounding the negative effects of hookworm and heartworm is that wild red wolves are inbred (Brzeski et al. 2014) , which may cause them to suffer more from co-infections or stressful conditions than an outbred population, like coyotes (Coltman et al. 1999; Spielman et al. 2004) . Management efforts, such as cross fostering captive born pups into wild litters, can help mitigate the deleterious effects of inbreeding (Brzeski et al. 2014 ), but continued monitoring of endoparasites and more rigorous demographic modeling of the impact of heartworm related deaths will be useful for future disease prevention.",
