Viruses are perpetuated as a consequence of many rounds of persistent or acute infections, with possible extracellular stages in which genomes remain basically invariant. Despite lacking direct evidence, we presume that multitudes of successive transmissions have allowed viruses to survive at least for thousands of years, probably undergoing continuous genetic change. Picornavirologists are familiar with an Egyptian stela dated 1550\u20131333 BCE. (18th Egyptian dynasty) that portrays the image of a man with an atrophic leg probably a consequence of infection with poliovirus (PV) or a related virus (Eggers, 2002). In this chapter, we deviate from the focus on how viral population numbers affect short-term survival and evolution, and we turn to features of viruses as they infect successive hosts to permit virus perpetuation in nature.\n",

Vertical transmission occurs from parental organisms to their offspring, and it includes infection through the germline in animals and plants, from the mother to the embryo during fetal development, and also postnatal transmission to the newborn via blood, milk, or contact (Mims, 1981, Nash et al., 2015). In horizontal transmission, a virus spreads from infected individuals to susceptible recipients. We are most familiar with this type of transmission. It frequently gives rise to disease outbreaks (infection episodes localized in space and time that affect a few individuals), epidemics (that affect an ample geographical area and are often extended in time), and pandemics (that affect most areas of our planet), typically the periodic influenza pandemics.",

            "text": "All transmission modes have probably contributed to the maintenance of viruses in our biosphere. Persistent infections are likely to have played a major role when the number of individual humans or animals living in close contact was limited throughout the pre-agricultural era, earlier than 10,000 years ago. A favorable climate change during the Holocene (the geological epoch that began at the end of the Pleistocene, around 12,000 years before the present; compare with Chapter 1) was probably an important driver toward large-scale domestication of plants and animals, 10,000\u20137000 years BCE. From the behavior of current viruses, there might have always been a dynamics of virus change for adaptability within individual hosts, and transmissions among animals or plants. The probability of transmission increased as host population numbers rose with agricultural practices and urban life in the last several thousand years. Intensive agriculture must have contributed to accelerated sequence space exploration by viruses with consequences for the emergence of viral disease (Section 7.7). Probably, there has been a continuous dynamics of viral emergences, reemergences, and extinctions with patterns that may be parallel to those observed in present-day viruses. Virology has existed as an organized scientific discipline with the possibility to isolate, store, and study viruses only for about one century. The challenge to reconstruct the events that might have led to viruses similar to the ones we isolate today was addressed in Chapter 1, with a critical first question being if viruses originated 4000 million years ago, or \u201conly\u201d 2000 million years ago (diagrams in Figs. 1.3 and 1.4, and Section 1.5 in Chapter 1). In this chapter, we are more modest in our aspirations, and we will analyze, with the tools of genomics, what happens when viruses evolve for months or years in what we call interhost virus evolution.",

Fortunately, there is a different historical record of ancient viral sequences in the DNA of differentiated organisms, in the form of integrated virus-like genetic elements. The research area that consists in rescuing ancestral viral sequences is termed paleo-virology, and it is providing information on viruses that circulated thousands of years or even millions of years ago in the case of viral sequences integrated into cellular DNA (Aswad and Katzourakis, 2012).",

Despite the current capacity to amplify tiny amounts of viral nucleic acids for nucleotide sequence determinations, proposals on how long-term viral evolution might proceed have to be based mainly on the comparison of viral genomes and the structure of viral proteins from modern representatives of different virus groups. First, we should understand the basic concepts related to virus transmission, keeping in mind viral population numbers and the complexity of viral populations.",

At a population level, a value of R\n0 larger than one means that a virus will continue its propagation among susceptible hosts if no environmental changes or external influences intervene. An R\n0 value lower than one means that the virus is doomed to extinction at the epidemiological level under those specific circumstances. The basic models of infection dynamics were developed by R.M. Anderson, R.M. May, and M.A. Nowak, with inclusion of the following key parameters: rate k at which uninfected hosts enter the population of susceptible individuals (x), their normal death rate (u) (so that the equilibrium abundance of uninfected hosts is k/u), number of infected hosts (y), mortality due to infection (v) (so that 1/u\n + \nv is the average lifetime of an infected host), a rate constant (\u03b2) that characterizes parasite infectivity (so that \u03b2x is the rate of new infections and \u03b2xy is the rate at which infected hosts transmit the virus to uninfected hosts). These parameters are schematically indicated in Fig. 7.1\nand they provide a theoretical value for R\n0 (Anderson and May, 1991, Nowak and May, 2000, Nowak, 2006, Woolhouse, 2017).",

Despite uncertainties, consistent R\n0 values have been estimated for different viral pathogens based on field observations. Values of R\n0 for human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus range from two to five; for PV the range is 5\u20137, and for Ebola virus is 1.5\u20132.5. For the measles virus (MV), which is one of the most contagious viruses described to date, the R\n0 reaches 12\u201318 (Heffernan et al., 2005, Althaus, 2014). Most isolates of the SARS coronavirus that circulated months after the emergence of this human pathogen had modest R\n0 values, and this is consistent with SARS not having reached the pandemic proportions that were feared immediately following its emergence. In contrast, MV is highly transmissible, thus explaining frequent outbreaks as soon as a sizable population stops vaccinating its infants. This is an important problem, fueled by antivaccination campaigns without scientific basis. Since some of the parameters that enter the basic equations of viral dynamics depend on the nucleotide sequence of the viral genome, mutations may alter R\n0 values, allowing some virus variants to overtake those that were previously circulating in the population (Fig. 7.2\n). Viral replication, fitness, load, transmissibility, and virulence are all interconnected factors that contribute to virus persistence in its broader sense of virus being perpetuated in nature. These parameters can affect both disease progression in an infected individual and transmissibility at the epidemiological level.",

The larger the population size and genetic heterogeneity of the virus in an infected individual, the higher will be the likelihood that independent transmission events have different outcomes. Individual susceptible hosts will receive subsets of related but nonidentical genomes. In a bright article that emphasized the molecular evidence and medical implications of quasispecies in viruses, J.J. Holland and colleagues wrote the following statement: \u201cTherefore, the acute effects and subtle chronic effects of infections will differ not only because we all vary genetically, physiologically, and immunologically, but also because we all experience a different array of quasispecies challenges. These facts are easily overlooked by clinicians and scientists because disease syndromes are often grossly similar for each type of virus, and because it would appear to make no difference in a practical sense. However, for the person who develops Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome following a common cold, or for the individual who remains healthy despite many years of HIV-1 infection, for example, it may make all the difference in the world\u201d (Holland et al., 1992). The ever increasing number of identified human genes whose allelic forms influence viral infections provides strong support for the predictions of Holland et al. Indeterminacies in the process of virus spread can be viewed as an extension of the diversification due to bottleneck events in the case of virus transmission, as visualized in Figs. 6.1 and 6.2 in Chapter 6, when dealing with the limitations of the virus samples retrieved from an infected host as the starting material for experimental evolution approaches.",

Some viruses remain infectious in the environment for prolonged time periods, until they reach a susceptible host in which to initiate replication rounds. This is the case of viruses transmitted by the fecal-oral route, such as enteroviruses. FMDV can adhere and remain infectious on many objects (fomites), including dust particles, food products with neutral pH, or insects that can transport the virus mechanically. Infectious FMDV can traverse long distances (many kilometers) on dust particles, people, trains, and the like. Even if some infectivity is lost, a few infectious particles are sufficient to infect an animal (Sellers, 1971, Sellers, 1981). There are some classic examples of long-distance transport of FMDV, a virus subjected to close scrutiny due to its economic impact. One is the spread of SAT1 and A22 FMDV during the 1960s in Turkey along the railway line from the cattle-raising region of Lake Van to slaughterhouses in Istanbul [this and other examples are described in (Brooksby, 1981)]. Computer models have been developed to explain and predict possible airborne FMDV transmission in different geographical areas, the origin of epidemics, and the effectiveness of contingency plans (Sorensen et al., 2000, Tidesley et al., 2017). [As an anecdote, in my experience as a member of the Research Group of the Standing Technical Committee for the Control of FMD of Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) in the 1980s, FMD outbreaks in any country always came from somewhere else]. A time-dependent bias in evolutionary rates for viruses has been amply documented (Duchene et al., 2014, Aiewsakun and Katzourakis, 2016), including when rates are compared between present-day isolates and those that circulated thousands of years ago (Muhlemann et al., 2018).",

(iii) In this case, virus transport is assumed to be mechanical (on dust particles carried by wind, aerosols, insects, etc.) without additional viral replication during transport. However, subpopulations of the most environment-resistant particles, or particles that adhere best to the transporter object, may bias the composition of the virus that will reach an animal to pursue replication. Such events, occurring for 10 to 100 rounds of host infections, render the appalling virus diversity described in Chapter 1 a bit less appalling. Since several additional environmental circumstances are changeable and unpredictable, it is unlikely that rates of viral evolution in nature can remain invariant on the basis of some internal principle of constant mutation occurrence (as if the accumulation of mutations was as monotonous as radioactive decay!).",

Some of the mutants reverted to the wild-type sequence after transmission to individuals negative for the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) alleles associated with long-term HIV-1 control (Leslie et al., 2004). Strong intrahost selective pressures and reversion of a part of the selected mutations upon transmission to a susceptible individual is one of the possible mechanisms behind diminished evolutionary rates when viruses from multiple host individuals are compared (Fig. 7.4\n, Box 7.1\n).Box 7.1Models for nonlinear rates of evolution\n\u2022For viruses that remain infectious in the extracellular environment, stasis due to the absence of replication will result in rates of evolution inversely correlated with the time between the isolation of the compared viruses.\u2022Adapt and revert.

Redd and colleagues reported that the viral populations found in the newly infected recipients were more closely related to ancestral sequences from the donor than to the sequences found in the donor near the time of transmission (Redd et al., 2012).

Fraser provided evidence that cycling of HIV-1 through long-lived memory CD4+T cells is probably the main contributing factor to slower HIV-1 evolution at the epidemic level (Lythgoe and Fraser, 2012). Ancestral sequences of HIV-1 in infected individuals may arise by the activation of proviral sequences kept in the form of quasispecies memory. In this case, we refer to the type of molecular memory defined as a reservoir, anatomical, or cellular memory in Section 5.5 of Chapter 5. A related type of reservoir memory is found in HBV, in the form of covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA) that persists in the nuclei of infected hepatocytes, and acts as a template for the synthesis of pregenomic RNA and viral mRNAs (Kay and Zoulim, 2007). In this case, a record of ancient sequences is registered in the cccDNA. It should be noted that memory levels are dependent on fitness values, as evidenced experimentally with FMDV and expected from the theoretical basis of memory implementation (Chapter 5). In consequence, the most abundant memory genomes established early in an infection might be those displaying the highest fitness early in infection, and they might be better adapted to initiate infections than to sustain them (Fig. 7.4).",

The permanence of viral genomic sequences in cellular DNA is a mechanism of evolutionary stasis, as it was emphasized in Chapter 3 with the comparison of the evolutionary rate of the retroviral v-mos gene and its cellular counterpart c-mos (Gojobori and Yokoyama, 1985), among other evidence. Considerable evolutionary stasis is also observed by comparing isolates of HTLV-1 and HTLV-2, whose replication displays a preference for maintaining its integration in cellular DNA (Melamed et al., 2014).

The differences were mainly due to nonsynonymous substitutions at limited sites. These observations were interpreted as a rapid switch of HBV between colonization (invasion of new host) and adaptation (quasispecies optimization in the new host). The authors referred to the colonization-adaptation trade-off (CAT) model or alternations of virus facing an environment marked by a limited host immune response followed by a period of active immune response. In the former environment, viruses displaying rapid replication are selected, while in the latter environment, HBV escape mutants with lower productivity are selected. In each transmission, when the virus reaches a new host, the previously adapted subpopulations are overgrown by the rapidly replicating ones.

According to the clock hypothesis, the rate of accumulation of mutations coincides with the rate at which mutations arise in infected individuals. This holds for neutral mutations, and as mentioned in several chapters of this book, very few mutations occurring in highly compact viral genomes are truly neutral (with no functional consequences in any environment; see Section 2.3 in Chapter 2). Even for neutral evolution, spatial asymmetries in populations are sufficient to perturb the molecular clock rate, as documented with a theoretical model of broad applicability (Allen et al., 2015). However, quasispecies and the operation of a clock are not totally irreconcilable. An epidemiological study with FMDV suggested that viral quasispecies could produce a transient molecular clock due to the periodic sampling of components of the mutant spectrum in transmission (Villaverde et al., 1991). In this case, both time differences between transmissions and spatial heterogeneities would blur the transiently observed regularity.",

For the latter group of viruses, the same vaccine can maintain its efficacy over many decades; examples are rabies virus (RV) and MV, two RNA viruses that show remarkable genetic diversity in nature, and estimates of mutation rates and frequencies comparable to other RNA viruses. Antigenic constancy is a determinant of long-lasting immunity after infection or vaccination. MV infection produces lifelong immunity (probably as a result of several factors) while patients that have cleared the hepatitis C virus (HCV) can be reinfected by the same virus.

However, mutation rates along a viral genome are not uniform, as evidenced by the occurrence of hot spots for variation. Influences such as nucleotide sequence context or RNA structure may conceivably alter mutation rates. It was proposed that a predicted double-stranded RNA at the region encoding the major antigenic site of FMDV might increase the polymerase error rate locally and give rise to multiple amino acid substitutions (Weddell et al., 1985). While at some specific sites polymerases may be more error-prone than average, subsequent evidence for FMDV indicated that antigenic variation is due to amino acid substitutions at different antigenic sites and that even variation at the major site can be mediated by distant amino acids on the viral capsid (Rowlands et al., 1983, Geysen et al., 1984, Mateu et al., 1990, Feigelstock et al., 1996). Later molecular studies have not provided evidence that viruses may have a large number of serotypes because their polymerases are more error-prone when copying regions encoding amino acids that belong to antigenic sites.

Indeed, there is no universal procedure used to classify viruses serologically, and therefore, strictly speaking, there is the possibility that a different number of serotypes could be obtained using alternative classification procedures. FMDV is a pertinent example. Its seven serotypes are defined on the basis of a very stringent test that cannot be performed with human viruses for obvious reasons: the absence of cross-protection resulting from vaccination or infection with a given FMDV. Infection or vaccination with FMDV of one serotype does not confer protection against FMDV of a different serotype. In contrast, the subtype classification of FMDV was based on serological assays, such as cross-neutralization or complement fixation tests, usually using sera raised in guinea pigs. These assays allowed classification of FMDV in more than 65 serological subtypes. Subtyping was stopped when it was realized that using increasingly discriminatory assays such as reactivity with MAbs, virtually any new isolate could define a new subtype [(Mateu et al., 1988); see (Domingo et al., 1990, Sobrino and Domingo, 2004, Mateu, 2017) for review of serotype and subtype classification of FMDV]. Despite these considerations, it is unlikely that serological assays using in vitro tests would be responsible for a 100-fold difference between two human pathogens such as HRV and HAV.

It is the preferred model of molecular virologists. The initial concept was proposed by M.G. Rossmann, in his canyon hypothesis (Rossmann, 1989), based on studies with HRV14. A canyon in the virus preserves the receptor-binding site inside while permitting amino acid substitutions that affect antigenicity, without consequences for receptor recognition. A physical and functional separation between receptor and antibody binding allows extensive antigenic variation. Clearly, in many viruses, there is an overlap between antigenic and receptor recognition sites (Section 4.5 in Chapter 4), that could limit antigenic variation. A difference in constraints is also supported by a structural comparison carried out by J.M. Casasnovas and his colleagues of the interaction of PV and HRV16 with their respective cellular receptors that revealed a receptor-binding site more accessible in PV than in HVR16, rendering the latter suited to escape antibody neutralization (Xing et al., 2000). This would render HRV a picornavirus prone to antigenic variation, as indeed found in nature. Thus, constraints imposed by the requirement to interact with the cellular receptor may explain the limited capacity for antigenic diversification, and perhaps with the contribution of other influences, the puzzle of widely different antigenic types despite similarly high genome mutability. Additional structural and functional studies with viruses of different families are necessary to substantiate this proposal.\n",

Thus, it is possible that following selection by an antibody, some mutants may decrease in frequency due to a fitness cost, or that their level is maintained due to additional compensatory mutations acquired by the replicating genomes (Fig. 7.6\n). Viruses that are highly constrained for antigenic variation may be diagnosed through fitness decrease of MARM mutants despite their occurring at similar rates as those that affect unconstrained sites. This is a concept similar to the distinction between fitness and function that we made in Section 5.8 of Chapter 5. That is, the occurrence of an antigenic change does not guarantee that the change will be perpetuated in nature and contribute to natural antigenic diversification. Again, fitness should be considered as a relevant parameter, and fitness effects on antigenic stability have been largely unexplored.",

No phylogenetic tree that connects the viruses that have been characterized to date can be derived in a reliable way, not even a tree for DNA or for RNA viruses. What we can do is to produce trees for related viruses that probably share a common ancestor. Many data banks are available for viruses to retrieve sequences for comparison with new isolates. Despite the fact that data banks are periodically updated, some are listed in Table 7.3\n, and can serve as the starting point to reach the desired uniform resource locator (URL) to implement a procedure for genome characterization. Prior to any comparative study of nucleotide or amino acid sequences (not only to establish phylogenetic relationships, but also to calculate genetic distances, to identify regulatory regions, functional domains, and structural motifs, to design oligonucleotide primers for amplification, or other applications) it is essential to align sequences accurately, and some programs for sequence alignments are also given in Table 7.3, including processing of large data sets obtained by deep sequencing (Kearse et al., 2012, Kumar et al., 2016, Kumar et al., 2019, Lai and Verma, 2017, Nakamura et al., 2018), and visualization of pangenome networks (Peng et al., 2018).",

Such types of amino acid sequence alignments may help in the identification of relevant structural and functional motifs.

Statistical acceptability derives from the chemical nature and shape of the amino acid side chains, their structural context, and also the limitations that the genetic code imposes on amino acid replacements (Porto et al., 2005). The basic assumption is that the more conserved the amino acid sequences, and the more similar are the variant amino acids, it is more likely that the proteins are derived from a common ancestor. M. Dayhoff pioneered the early comparison of protein sequences establishing a protein information resource (PIR) in the middle of the 20th century. Tables named PAM (percent accepted mutation) were constructed, and several evolved versions such as BLOSUM matrices, based on the BLOCKS database, are used to compare protein sequences. The BLOSUM62 amino acid substitution matrix groups amino acids according to their chemical structure and provides a probability of occurrence of each amino acid replacement: zero, amino acid replacement expected by chance; positive number, replacement found more often than by chance; and negative number, replacement found less often than by chance.",

Application of phylogenetic methods to virus evolution requires careful consideration of the evolutionary models to be used, including probabilities of the different types of nucleotide and amino acid replacements, and the rates at which they may occur. Statistical methods (i.e., likelihood ratio tests) are available to select an adequate model for a given data set (Salemi and Vandamme, 2004). At the nucleotide sequence level, it is often assumed that when transitions are more frequent than transversions in a set of related sequences, no saturation of mutation took place. In contrast, when transversions are more frequent than transitions, saturation is presumed (Xia and Xie, 2001). Parameter \u03b1 applied to amino acid sequence alignments (e.g., using the program AAml from PAML package, version 3.14) takes into account multiple amino acid replacements per site, as well as unequal substitution rates among sites (Yang et al., 2000). Parameter \u03b1 can be calculated using the amino acid replacement matrix WAG available in the program MODELTEST (Posada and Crandall, 1998). Despite their obvious utility, it is unlikely that these statistical procedures which were developed on the assumption of successions of defined sequences (rather than mutant clouds) can capture the complexities underlying long-term evolution of viruses in nature.",

The evolutionary trace (ET) clustering method combines phylogenetic partition of sequences with structural information (Chakravarty et al., 2005), and it may help in identifying functionally relevant domains shared by divergent isolates in particular highly variable capsid and surface viral proteins. ET can be applied to proteins and nucleic acids, and its clustering features may reveal conserved structures that are overlooked when all sequences are compared together. As explained in Chapter 1, the great diversity of amino acid sequences recorded among viral structural proteins (several URL links in Table 7.3) are actually reduced to a limited number of morphotypes at the structural level. In another approach, the probabilities of equivalence between pairs of residues in viral proteins are converted into evolutionary distances (Bamford et al., 2005, Ravantti et al., 2013). The structure-based classification has grouped the coat protein of icosahedral viruses in separate classes, each of which, interestingly, embraces different domains of life (Archaea, Bacteria, and Eukarya) (McTavish et al., 2017). A lineage of structurally related viruses includes tailed bacteriophages and the herpesviruses, suggesting that parts of the genomes of complex viruses may have a very ancient origin. They might have belonged to viruses that infected primitive cells before the latter diverged into the domains of life that we identify in our biosphere (Bamford et al., 2005, Villarreal, 2005) (compare with models of virus origins in Chapter 1).",

Emergence is defined as the appearance of a new pathogen for a host, while reemergence often refers to the reappearance of a viral pathogen, following a period of absence. Being a popular topic, the reader will find numerous books and reviews on the subject. It is worth emphasizing that in the 20th century many authors took the lead in emphasizing the problem of viral emergences and the need to investigate the underlying mechanisms, notably S.S. Morse and J. Lederberg [see several chapters of Morse, 1993, Morse, 1994]. Given the adaptive capacity of viruses, in particular, the RNA viruses, the reader will certainly suspect that genetic variation of viruses must be one of the factors involved in viral emergences. Indeed, most of the high-impact new viral diseases recorded recently or historically are due to RNA viruses. A statement by J. Lederberg reflects our vulnerability in the face of the nearly unlimited potential of viruses to vary: \u201cAbundant sources of genetic variation exist for viruses to learn new tricks, not necessarily confined to what happens routinely or even frequently\u201d (Lederberg, 1993). The situation is even more complex because a genetic variation of viruses is only one of many ingredients that promote the introduction of new viral pathogens in the human population. A report issued by the U.S. Institute of Medicine in 2003, analyzed and documented 13 factors that, individually or in combination, participate in the emergence of microbial disease. They include a number of sociological, environmental, and ecological influences that act to promote the emergence and reemergence of viruses, bacteria, fungi, and protozoa (Smolinski et al., 2003) (Box 7.2\n).Box 7.2Factors in the emergence of microbial disease\n\u2022Microbial change and adaptation.\u2022Human susceptibility to infection: impaired host immunity and malnutrition.\u2022Climate and weather.\u2022Changing ecosystems: vector ecology; reservoir abundance; and distribution.\u2022Human demographics and behavior: population growth; aging; and urbanization.\u2022Economic development and land use.\u2022International travel and commerce.\u2022Technology and industry.\u2022Breakdown of public health measures.\u2022Poverty and social inequality.\u2022War and famine.\u2022Lack of political will.\u2022Intent to harm: bioterrorism and agroterrorism.\nPoints summarized from Smolinski, M.S., Hamburg, M.A., Lederberg, J., 2003.

Concerning the recipient hosts, the higher the number of potentially susceptible hosts that come into contact with an infected donor, the higher the probability of establishment of an emergent infection. It is likely that the advent of agricultural practices some 10,000 years ago, combined with increased contacts between humans and animals, inaugurated a time of new viral emergences.

As correctly emphasized by S.S. Morse, changes in viral traffic may allow viruses to come near potential new hosts that had never been encountered before. Several sociological and ecological factors that can impact directly or indirectly the accessibility to an infected donor play a role. A typical example that connects several of the points listed in Box 7.2 is provided by the increase of arbovirus vectors during a humid season due to the climate change because insect larvae can proliferate on water reservoirs. Increased travel may put humans infected with arboviruses in contact with the flourishing insect vector population. Climate change may modify the migration routes of some birds, again putting these potential vertebrate hosts in contact with infected animals and insect vectors.",

Experts anticipate new influenza pandemics to arise somewhere in Asia from the avian reservoirs of IV; however, in 2009, the new influenza pandemic originated in Central America.

Despite considerable methodological progress, we are still in the realm of uncertainty regarding the prediction of when and where a new viral pathogen will emerge (see Summary Box).Summary Box\n\u2022Long-term evolution of viruses is the result of a history of virus transmission among hosts. Basic principles of transmission dynamics must take into consideration sampling effects and the inherent heterogeneity of viral populations.\u2022Rates of evolution of viruses in nature are extremely high as compared to the estimated rate for their host organisms. Contrary to some tenets of neutral evolution, rates of viral evolution are not constant with time. In particular, several mechanisms explain why intrahost virus evolution is faster than interhost evolution.\u2022Several procedures for sequence alignments and derivation of phylogenetic trees allow a partial description of virus diversification in nature.\u2022Antigenic diversification of viruses is subjected to constraints that differ among viruses. Some viruses have a single serotype while others have 100 serotypes. Several possible mechanisms may contribute to this difference.\u2022The emergence and reemergence of new viral pathogens is a multifactorial event with a clear influence of host and virus population numbers.
