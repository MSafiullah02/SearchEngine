We found that TOR regulates ribosome biogenesis in plants at multiple levels, but through mechanisms that do not directly depend on the canonical 5\u2032 oligopyrimidine tract motif (5\u2032TOP) found in mammalian ribosomal protein mRNAs. To investigate this further, we focused on a putative TOR substrate identified in our phosphoproteome: LARP1, a eukaryotic RNAbinding protein that is proposed to mediate TOR translational control of 5\u2032TOP mRNAs in humans and that has gained increased interest because it associates with SARS-CoV-2. By conducting parallel global profiling experiments with larp1 mutants, we discovered that the TOR-LARP1 signaling axis controls 5\u2032TOP mRNA translation in plants and defined a set of conserved eukaryotic 5\u2032TOP mRNAs that encode cyclins, importins/karyopherins, translation elongation factors, and TCTP1, among others. We then identified novel, plantspecific 5\u2032TOP mRNAs involved in critical biological processes, including ribosome biogenesis, chromatin remodeling, and auxin signaling. Our study illuminates the ancestral roles of the TOR-LARP1-5\u2032TOP metabolic regulatory network and provides evolutionary context for ongoing debates about the molecular function of LARP1 in eukaryotic cells.",

            "text": "TARGET OF RAPAMYCIN (TOR) is a conserved eukaryotic serine/threonine protein kinase that regulates metabolism by promoting anabolic processes when nutrients are available (Liu and Sabatini, 2020) . In the most well-studied pathway, mammalian TOR is stimulated by amino acids to promote protein translation, acting as a rheostat to couple free amino acid availability with rates of amino acid incorporation into proteins (Valvezan and Manning, 2019) . TOR is under intense biomedical investigation because dysregulation of the TOR network causes or contributes to a wide range of human diseases, prominently including cancer (Saxton and Sabatini, 2017) . Therefore, many details of the TOR signaling pathway have been elucidated in mammals and yeast; less is known, however, about the TOR network in other eukaryotic lineages. In the plant model for genetics and molecular biology, Arabidopsis thaliana, TOR is essential for the earliest stages of embryogenesis (Menand et al., 2002) , and inhibiting TOR strongly represses growth and development (Deprost et al., 2007; Xiong and Sheen, 2012) . Plant TOR activity is controlled by a number of upstream signals, such as glucose , light (G. H. X. Li et al., 2017) , nucleotides (Busche et al., 2020) , and phytohormones including auxin (X. Schepetilnikov et al., 2017) , brassinosteroids (Zhang et al., 2016) , and abscisic acid (Wang et al., 2018a) . When plant TOR is active, it promotes the transcription of genes involved in cell cycle progression, ribosome biogenesis, and various other metabolic processes, depending on developmental context . As in other eukaryotes, plant TOR associates with at least two additional proteins, RAPTOR (REGULATORY ASSOCIATED PROTEIN OF TOR) and LST8 (LETHAL WITH SEC13 8), to form an active complex called TORC1 (TOR COMPLEX 1) (Deprost et al., 2005; Mahfouz et al., 2006; Moreau et al., 2012) ; it is not known whether TOR acts in any RAPTOR-or LST8-independent complexes in plants . Very little is understood about the signal transduction networks downstream from TOR in plants; elucidating these signaling pathways is a major goal to understand how TOR signaling evolved in eukaryotes and how TOR signaling networks could be manipulated to promote agricultural yields while reducing reliance on expensive and environmentally-harmful fertilizer inputs (Busche et al., 2020) .",

As a simplified model, in mammals, TOR specifically promotes the translation of mRNAs that encode ribosomal proteins (RPs) and a handful of other components of the protein translation apparatus; in turn, these additional ribosomes increase global rates of protein translation. Vertebrate RP mRNAs have evolved a regulatory motif, called a 5\u2032 terminal oligopyrimidine tract (5\u2032TOP), which begins with a cytosine at the 5\u2032 cap and is followed by several uracils and/or cytosines, but no (or very few) adenines or guanines . Approximately 100 mammalian transcripts are classically considered 5\u2032TOP mRNAs, including all ~80 cytosolic RP mRNAs (Philippe et al., 2020) . The 5\u2032TOP motif is crucial for the TOR-mediated regulation of RP mRNA translation initiation in vertebrates: when TOR is inactive, 5\u2032TOP motifs are sufficient to strongly repress translation initiation (Meyuhas and Kahan, 2015) . Multiple TOR substrates have been proposed to mediate TOR-5\u2032TOP mRNA translation regulation (Berman et al., 2020; Meyuhas and Kahan, 2015; Philippe et al., 2020; Thoreen et al., 2012) , including eS6 kinases (S6Ks), eIF4E-binding proteins (4E-BPs), eIF4G initiation factors, and La-related protein 1 (LARP1), among others. The precise mechanisms remain contested, however, and only S6K, eIF4G, and LARP1 are conserved across eukaryotes.",

Subsequent mechanistic studies have alternatively proposed that LARP1 promotes translation of 5\u2032TOP mRNAs (Tcherkezian et al., 2014) , represses translation of 5\u2032TOP mRNAs (Fonseca et al., 2015; Philippe et al., 2020 Philippe et al., , 2018 , has dual and opposing roles in controlling translation of 5\u2032TOP mRNAs depending on its phosphorylation status (Hong et al., 2017) , or has no role in regulating translation, but instead stabilizes 5\u2032TOP mRNAs (Gentilella et al., 2017) . At a molecular level, LARP1 can bind directly to the 7-methylguanosine (m 7 G) and 5\u2032TOP (Cassidy et al., 2019; Lahr et al., 2017) , but may also associate with pyrimidine-enriched sequences elsewhere in a transcript (Hong et al., 2017) , and is often found in complex with the polyA tail via proteinprotein interactions with polyA binding proteins (PABPs) and/or direct interaction with the polyA RNA (Al-Ashtal et al., 2019; Aoki et al., 2013) . These apparently conflicting models (Berman et al., 2020) may reflect differences in the physiological status or genetics of the cell types used, multiple protein-and RNA-binding sites on the LARP1 protein with distinct affinities, or confounding effects of different techniques to identify LARP1 binding partners with distinct inherent biases. LARP1 is under increasing scrutiny because of its clinical significance: in addition to contributions to the progression of some cancers (Mura et al., 2015) and a possible link to Zika virus pathogenesis (Scaturro et al., 2018) , LARP1 was recently found to physically associate with the RNA-binding nucleocapsid of the recentlyemerged zoonotic coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (Gordon et al., 2020) . Therefore, in light of evidence that inhibiting TOR limits replication of a closely related coronavirus (MERS-CoV) (Kindrachuk et al., 2015) and the availability of FDA-approved TOR inhibitors (especially rapamycin and related, rapamycin-like compounds) and several additional TOR inhibitors in clinical trials, ablating TOR-LARP1 signaling has been proposed as a possible pharmacological target to treat severe coronavirus infections (Gordon et al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2020) .",

            "text": "Most strikingly, although LARP1 is deeply conserved in eukaryotes, the ubiquitous 5\u2032TOP motif in the 5\u2032 leader of cytosolic RP mRNAs only recently evolved in vertebrates, suggesting that LARP1 did not co-evolve with its proposed current primary function in humans, the direct regulation of cytosolic RP mRNA translation. In plants, LARP1 has been reported to associate with the cytosolic exoribonuclease, XRN4, and recruit XRN4 to specific transcripts during heat shock to promote their degradation (Merret et al., 2013) , but it is not known whether LARP1 regulates mRNA stability and/or translation under standard physiological conditions. Pioneering efforts to identify the mechanisms regulating translation of 5\u2032TOP mRNAs, however, did show that wheat germ extracts contain a repressor that specifically limits translation of 5\u2032TOP mRNAs in cell-free translation assays (Biberman and Meyuhas, 1999; Shama and Meyuhas, 1996) , suggesting that plants also discriminately regulate translation of 5\u2032TOP mRNAs. Here, we show that the TOR-LARP1-5\u2032TOP signaling axis regulates translation in Arabidopsis, impacting expression of a set of deeply conserved 5\u2032TOP genes, including translation elongation factors, polyA-binding proteins, karyopherins/importins, and the translationally-controlled tumor protein. Moreover, we identify new, plant-specific genes regulated by TOR-LARP1-5\u2032TOP signaling, including several genes involved in auxin signaling, developmental patterning, and chromatin modifications. Significantly, many of the 5\u2032TOP mRNAs do encode proteins that contribute to ribosome biogenesis, although only a handful of cytosolic RP mRNAs themselves have 5\u2032TOP motifs. We propose that TOR-LARP1-5\u2032TOP mRNA signaling arose early during eukaryotic evolution to coordinate protein translation and cell division with cellular metabolic status and nutrient availability, and we argue that TOR-LARP1-5\u2032TOP signaling has since evolved new, plant-specific targets that regulate plant physiology, growth, and development.",

Seedlings were grown to quiescence in half-strength MS media for 3 days under photosynthesis-limiting conditions with a 12 h light / 12 h dark diurnal cycle. Media were then replaced with half-strength MS media plus 15 mM glucose to activate TOR. 24 h later, media were replaced again with half-strength MS media plus 15 mM glucose (to maintain TOR activity) or half-strength MS media plus 15 mM glucose and 5.0 \u03bcM Torin2 (to attenuate TOR activity) (X. Montan\u00e9 and Menand, 2013) . Seedlings were collected 2 h after these treatments. At least 600 seedlings were pooled for each treatment and considered one sample, and the entire experiment was replicated three times. After collection, portions of each sample were divided for different analyses. Total RNA was extracted from one set of samples in polysome buffer with cycloheximide; an aliquot of this RNA was used to build RNA-Seq libraries after protease treatment and depletion of rRNA, and the rest of the RNA was used for ribosome footprint profiling (Hsu et al., 2016; Ingolia et al., 2009) . Total protein was extracted from a parallel set of samples and digested with trypsin; an aliquot of this digested protein was TMTlabeled and analyzed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), and the rest was enriched for phosphopeptides and then TMT-labeled and analyzed by LC/MS-MS. In summary, we quantified transcripts from 19,087 genes, ribosome footprints from 14,010 genes, peptides from 2,814 proteins, and phosphopeptides from 657 phosphoproteins (Supplementary File 1).",

Mitochondrial biogenesis is broadly suppressed, including not only mitochondrial RP mRNAs ( Figure 1B , Supplementary File 2), but also transcripts encoding OXPHOS electron chain subunits and proteins that participate in translocation of proteins into mitochondria ( Figure 1C , Supplementary File 2). Inhibiting TOR decreased levels of mRNAs that encode cell wall proteins that contribute to growth, including arabinogalactan proteins, extensins, and expansins ( Figure 1C , Supplementary File 2). Transcriptional programs associated with abiotic and biotic stress were widely induced after TOR inhibition, including accumulation of mRNAs that encode Nod-like receptors, receptor-like kinases, WRKY transcription factors, NAC transcription factors, and enzymes that contribute to secondary metabolic stress responses ( Figure 1C , Supplementary File 2).

This result is in strong agreement with the conserved role of TOR in promoting RP mRNA translation in other eukaryotic model systems. We also observed significant translational repression of many photosynthesis-associated genes ( Figure 1D , Supplementary File 3). In particular, the relative translational efficiency of 24 mRNAs encoded by the chloroplast significantly decreased after treatment with Torin2, indicating that TOR promotes translation within the chloroplast.",

Enrichment analysis was performed with PANTHER gene ontologies, as described in detail in the methods section.

Oppositely, uL30a phosphorylation somewhat increased, despite a significant decrease in uL30a transcripts. uL18a is a component of the 5S ribonucleoprotein particle, along with uL5 and the 5S rRNA, that is assembled as a subcomplex prior to incorporation into the large subunit. Recessive alleles of uL18a, including piggyback3 (Pinon et al., 2008) and oligocellula 5 (Yao et al., 2008) , impact Arabidopsis leaf development (Fujikura et al., 2009 ) and enhance phenotypes of asymmetric leaves 1 (Pinon et al., 2008; Yao et al., 2008) and angustifolia 3 mutants that drastically disrupt leaf patterning. The differentially phosphorylated residue in uL18a, Ser131, is not conserved in humans but is deeply conserved in the plant lineage.

These residues are conserved in most land plant RAPTOR sequences, including Physcomitrella patens and Marchantia polymorpha RAPTOR orthologues, but are not found in other eukaryotic lineages ( Figure 2D ). Torin2-sensitive phosphorylation of RAPTOR1 residues suggests that TORC1 could regulate its own activity, although further studies will be needed to determine whether RAPTOR1 is a direct substrate of TORC1 and how phosphorylation of these residues affects TORC1 activity.",

In mammals and yeast, the RAPTOR-independent TORC2 complex regulates actin filamentation through multiple pathways (Dos et al., 2004; Jacinto et al., 2004; Loewith et al., 2002; Rispal et al., 2015; Schmidt et al., 1996) . Recently, a forward genetic screen in Arabidopsis found that a recessive allele of ISOPROPYLMALATE SYNTHASE 1 (IPMS1) promotes actin filamentation in a TORdependent pathway (Cao et al., 2019) . IPMS1 is the first committed step of leucine biosynthesis; accordingly, ipms1 mutants exhibit broad defects in free amino acid accumulation (Cao et al., 2019) . While the exact cause remains undefined, the disruption of amino acid metabolism in ipms1 mutants apparently increases cellular TOR activity (Cao et al., 2019; Schaufelberger et al., 2019) . Reducing TOR activity by treating ipms1 mutants with ATP-competitive TOR inhibitors rescues the ipms1 actin organization phenotype, which suggests that TOR regulates actin filamentation in plants. We found that Torin2 decreases phosphorylation of VLN2 and VLN3, closely related VILLINs, at the same sites near the C-terminus in both proteins. VLN2 and VLN3 are required for normal plant development and actin bundling in Arabidopsis (Bao et al., 2012; Qu et al., 2013; van der Honing et al., 2012; Wu et al., 2015) , but their post-translational regulation remains underexplored in plants. Functional studies of TOR-promoted VLN2/VLN3 phosphorylation could reveal new links between TOR and the cytoskeleton in plants.",

            "text": "We chose to focus further studies on LARP1 for several reasons. LARP1 is deeply conserved in eukaryotes and is a consistent target of TOR in mammalian and plant phosphoproteomic screens, but the functional significance of TOR-LARP1 signaling remains unresolved (Berman et al., 2020) , even in biomedical model systems. We began by investigating the role of LARP1 in normal plant development and physiology. In some eukaryotes, such as Drosophila melanogaster, LARP1 is essential for early stages of development (Burrows et al., 2010) . In contrast, LARP1 is not essential in C. elegans, although larp1 mutants exhibit delayed growth and very low-frequency arrest of embryogenesis (Nykamp et al., 2008) . LARP1 contributes to heat stress recovery in Arabidopsis (Merret et al., 2013) , but its role in development under standard growing conditions has not been thoroughly characterized. To address this, we grew larp1 and wild-type plants for 15 days on half-strength MS media plus 0.8% agar, and then measured root growth ( Figure 3A ). We observed 36% shorter roots in larp1 than in wildtype plants, along with a reduction in the number of secondary roots (although this is possibly a consequence of the defect in primary root growth) ( Figure 3B ). The first true leaves of larp1 plants were also significantly smaller than in wild-type plants grown under these conditions ( Figure 3C ). We next assayed shoot growth in soil-grown plants four weeks post-germination. We did not observe any obvious defects in leaf morphology ( Figure 3D ), but again, the most recently-emerged leaf (L12) was significantly smaller in larp1 plants than in wild-type ( Figure 3E ). Given the growth defect in larp1 and that LARP1 is proposed to regulate translation in human cells, we next tested whether free amino acid levels are different between larp1 and wild-type shoots, which could indicate a global defect in protein biosynthesis ( Figure 3F ). We found virtually no differences between larp1 and wild-type plants, however, except that alanine accumulated to 38% higher levels than in larp1 shoots ( Figure 3F ).",

RNA-Seq revealed that several processes are disrupted in larp1 mutants compared to wild-type in glucose-supplied seedlings ( Figure 4A ). Most prominently, in larp1, we observed significant repression of genes involved in photosynthesis, especially genes encoding components of the photosynthetic electron transport chain (pETC) complexes ( Figure 4A , Supplementary File 5). Repression of photosynthesis-associated nuclear gene expression is consistent with our observation that chlorophyll levels were significantly lower in these larp1 seedlings than in wild-type ( Figure 3G ). Global proteomic analysis confirmed that photosynthesis-associated proteins are less abundant in larp1 mutants ( Figure 4B , Supplementary File 6). In addition to photosynthesisassociated transcripts, E3 ubiquitin ligase mRNAs, biotic stress response transcripts, and cell wall glycoprotein mRNAs (including those that encode arabinogalactan proteins) were also repressed in larp1 ( Figure 4A ). Several biological processes are transcriptionally induced in larp1 compared to wild-type, including genes involved in glucosinolate biosynthesis, HSP70/HSP90 chaperones, microtubule cytoskeleton, lipid degradation, and lipid body-associated genes (oleosins and caleosins), flavonoid biosynthesis, and cell cycle genes (especially those involved in cell division) ( Figure 4A ). In response to Torin2, larp1 mutants showed largely similar responses as wild-type seedlings, including extensive repression of cytosolic ribosome biogenesis, nucleocytoplasmic trafficking, cell wall biosynthesis, and cell cycle progression, as well as broad induction of genes involved in protein catabolism (including autophagy and E3 ubiquitin ligases), biotic stress response genes, protein chaperoning, and receptor-like kinases ( Figure 4D , Supplementary File 8).",

We observed at least a twofold change in TE for 835 transcripts in larp1 compared to wild-type when seedlings were supplied glucose ( Figure 4C ). The TE of several categories of mRNAs was relatively repressed in larp1 mutants, including mRNAs that encode cytoskeletal kinesins, proteins involved in chromatin modifications and organization, and proteins involved in translation ( Figure 4C ). Inhibiting TOR with Torin2 impacted the TE of 239 transcripts in the larp1 background compared to glucose-supplied larp1 seedlings ( Figure 4E , Supplementary File 9). As in wild-type, MapMan analysis showed that translation of cytosolic RP mRNAs was broadly repressed by Torin2 in larp1. Overall, these results demonstrate that LARP1 is not required for all effects of Torin2 on mRNA translation in plants, suggesting that other proteins may exert translational control in response to TOR deactivation.",

Under mock conditions, 96 phosphoproteins accumulated to significantly different levels in larp1 than wild-type seedlings. 36 of these overlapped with the Torin2-sensitive phosphoproteome, more than twice the number expected (p < 10 -11 ; at most 17 overlapping phosphoproteins would be expected, p > 0.05). Remarkably, all but one of these phosphoproteins was affected in the same pattern in mock-treated larp1 compared to mock-treated wild-type as in the Torin2-treated wild-type compared to mock-treated wild-type ( Figure 4F , Supplementary File 6). To validate these results, we assayed phosphorylation of the well-established TOR substrate, S6K-T449, in wild-type and larp1 plants using phosphospecific polyclonal antibodies against S6K-pT449 and monoclonal antibodies against total S6K ( Figure 4G ). As predicted by the global phosphoproteomic results, S6K-pT449 / S6K ratios are noticeably lower in larp1 ( Figure 4G ). Thus, LARP1 is required to maintain high levels of TOR activity in actively growing Arabidopsis seedlings, which could contribute to the growth defects we observed.",

In plants, however, it has been reported that RP mRNAs do not have 5\u2032TOP or pyrimidine-enriched motifs, although, to our knowledge, there has been no comprehensive effort to define plant 5\u2032TOP mRNAs. We sought to annotate Arabidopsis transcripts to identify likely 5\u2032TOP mRNAs using a modified version of the recentlydescribed TOPscore approach (Philippe et al., 2020) (Figure 5A ). TOPscores are calculated using quantitative transcription start site sequencing (TSS-Seq), which provides single-nucleotide resolution of 5\u2032 mRNA ends genome-wide ( Figure 5A ). Every TSS-Seq read in the 5\u2032 leader of an mRNA is scored by whether it is part of an oligopyrimidine tract: all 5\u2032 ends starting with purines are scored as 0, and 5\u2032 ends starting with a pyrimidine are scored as 1 plus the distance to the next purine in the 5\u2032 leader (thus, for example, a TSS-Seq read that starts with a pyrimidine followed by four consecutive pyrimidines and then a purine is scored as 5). The sum of these scored reads is then divided by the total number of TSS-Seq reads that mapped to the 5\u2032 leader.",

We next used MapMan to conduct Wilcoxon rank-sum analyses to determine if gene TOPscores broadly correlate with any biological functions ( Figure 5E ). We found that genes involved in RNA biosynthesis, especially transcription factors in the Zn finger C2C2 superfamily, have higher TOPscores. Genes encoding proteins involved in nucleocytoplasmic transport, including importin/karyopherins, nucleoporins, and Ran GTPases, also have significantly higher TOPscores. Genes involved in cell wall remodeling and biochemistry, however, have significantly lower TOPscores.

This result demonstrates that inhibiting TOR represses translation of mRNAs with high TOPscores. Strikingly, this effect is dependent on LARP1: in larp1 mutants, the median TOPscore of genes that are specifically translationally repressed upon Torin2 treatment is only 1.0 ( Figure 5F ), significantly lower than the median TOPscore for all genes (Mann-Whitney U test, p < 0.01).

(2020) , there are 70 cytosolic RP mRNAs and 35 other 5\u2032TOP mRNAs; excluding the RP mRNAs, over one-third of these (12 / 35) are conserved 5\u2032TOP mRNAs in Arabidopsis. Strikingly, the importance of regulating the expression of these non-ribosomal genes by TOR remains largely unstudied. For example, we found that importin/karyopherin mRNAs are translationally regulated by the TOR-LARP1-5\u2032TOP motif signaling axis in plants and humans. Importins/karyopherins selectively traffic proteins with importin recognition motifs (nuclear localization signals) from the cytosol to the nucleus; in humans, IPO5 and IPO7 are core 5\u2032TOP mRNAs, and in Arabidopsis, IMB1 is a high-confidence 5\u2032TOP mRNA (TOPscore: 3.02; \u0394TE(WT + T2 / WT) = -1.7-fold, \u0394TE(larp1 + T2 / larp1) = +1.2-fold) and the median TOPscore for all importins/karyopherins is 2.8 ( Figure 5E ), suggesting that others may also be subject to translational regulation by TOR-LARP1-5\u2032TOP signaling. In humans, both IPO5 and IPO7 are responsible for importing RPs to the nucleus; ribosome subunits are translated in the cytosol, but then must be transported to the nucleolus for assembly before ribosomes are exported to the cytosol. In Arabidopsis, the importin IMB3 (also known as KARYOPHERIN ENABLING THE TRANSPORT OF THE CYTOPLASMIC HYL1 or KETCH1) similarly promotes ribosome biogenesis by carrying RP subunits to the nucleus. The IMB3 transcript has a TOPscore of 2.9 and was slightly translationally repressed by Torin2 treatment in wild-type (\u0394TE = -1.1-fold) but not in larp1.",

As a result, in humans, some mRNAs only have 5\u2032TOP motifs in specific cell types, allowing for tunable regulation of gene expression by the TOR-LARP1 signaling axis (Philippe et al., 2020) . Currently, there are not sufficient publicly-available TSS-Seq data in plants to determine whether alternative transcription start sites fine-tune TOR-LARP1-5\u2032TOP regulation genome-wide, but upon close analysis of the core 5\u2032TOP mRNAs defined here, we did find that several genes that encode 5\u2032TOP mRNAs have two, apparently distinct TSSs. PIN1, for example, has two distinct TSS peaks, although both the longer and shorter predicted 5\u2032 leaders have high TOPscores (7.8 and 10.5, respectively) ( Figure 5B ). PABP8 has two strong TSS peaks with approximately equal coverage in the Arabidopsis root TSS-Seq dataset ( Figure 5B , 5D): the longer predicted 5\u2032 leader has a high TOPscore (3.4), but the shorter predicted 5\u2032 leader has a near-median TOPscore (1.3). Therefore, it is possible that, like humans, plants modulate which genes encode 5\u2032TOP mRNAs in response to developmental or physiological cues. Future investigations of plant TSSs and LARP1-dependent translation will be needed to thoroughly test this hypothesis genome-wide.",

From these screens, we identified thousands of genes that are regulated transcriptionally, translationally, or post-translationally by TOR. By comparing these results to distantly-related eukaryotes (e.g., yeast (Huber et al., 2009 ) and humans (Hsu et al., 2011; Yu et al., 2011) ) and to orthogonal experimental approaches in Arabidopsis (e.g., cell suspension culture proteomics (Van Leene et al., 2019)), we defined a core set of bona fide TOR-sensitive phosphoproteins in Arabidopsis, including LARP1. LARP1 is an RNA-binding protein that is highly conserved in animals, plants, and most fungi (Deragon, 2020) . To elucidate how LARP1 acts downstream of TOR, we repeated our global profiling experiments in larp1 mutants. Analysis of these results revealed that TOR-LARP1 signaling controls the translation of a specific set of mRNAs that begin with a 5\u2032TOP motif, demonstrating that TOR-LARP1-5\u2032TOP signaling is an ancestral function of the TOR signaling network in eukaryotes.",

The typical biomedical model for evolutionary comparison, S. cerevisiae, is unusual among eukaryotes because its genome does not include a complete LARP1 orthologue (Deragon, 2020) , which has limited progress on understanding the TOR-LARP1 pathway. Within mammalian model systems, investigations of LARP1 have focused primarily on the role of LARP1 in regulating cytosolic RP mRNA translation and/or stability, because virtually all vertebrate cytosolic RP mRNAs begin with a 5\u2032TOP motif. Plant and fungal cytosolic RP mRNAs do not all start with a 5\u2032TOP motif, but LARP1 is broadly conserved in these lineages, suggesting that the ancestral function of LARP1 might be entirely different from its current role in human cells. Our study revealed, however, that LARP1 does control the translation of 5\u2032TOP mRNAs in plants, and we discovered that humans and plants share a core set of deeply conserved eukaryotic 5\u2032TOP mRNAs. Moreover, while only a handful of RP mRNAs begin with 5\u2032TOP motifs in Arabidopsis, several other steps of ribosome biogenesis, including rDNA transcription, rRNA processing, and ribosome complex assembly, are controlled by the TOR-LARP1-5\u2032TOP signaling axis. Therefore, we speculate that the vertebrate lineage evolved an adaptive regulatory \"short-circuit\" that allowed TOR-LARP1-5\u2032TOP signaling to directly coordinate expression of RP mRNAs, but that the role of TOR-LARP1-5\u2032TOP signaling in coordinating nutrient availability with ribosome biogenesis was already present in the ancestors of plants and animals.",

Our discovery that these transcripts have likely been consistent effectors of the TOR-LARP1-5\u2032TOP signaling axis suggests that their coordinated expression with metabolic status sensed by TOR is adaptively important for eukaryotic cell biology. The significance of TOR in controlling protein translation, and thus a putative function for TOR in regulating expression of eEF1B subunits, PABPs, and RPs, has been understood for some time (Hara et al., 1998) : TOR is stimulated by amino acid levels and in turn promotes amino acid consumption in protein biosynthesis. Similarly, across eukaryotes, TOR acts as a gatekeeper for cell cycle progression, only permitting the G1/S phase transition when sufficient nutrients are available to support cell division (Brown et al., 1994; Kunz et al., 1993; , and thus providing a good hypothesis for the regulation of cyclin expression by TOR.",

            "text": "It is less immediately clear why TOR-LARP1-5\u2032TOP signaling coordinates translation of importins and ERGIC3. Several studies in plants and animals have shown that reducing importin levels can restrict ribosome biogenesis by limiting the transport of newly-translated RPs from the cytosol to the nucleolus for ribosome assembly (Chou et al., 2010; Golomb et al., 2012; J\u00e4kel and G\u00f6rlich, 1998; Xiong et al., 2020) . The importins encoded by 5\u2032TOP mRNAs, IPO5 and IPO7, are both specifically responsible for nuclear import of several RP subunits and are implicated as key contributors to cancer cell proliferation, tumorigenicity, and regulation of the p53 oncogenic pathway (\u00c7a\u011fatay and Chook, 2018; Golomb et al., 2012; Zhang et al., 2019) . Therefore, we hypothesize that importins are translationally regulated by TOR-LARP1-5\u2032TOP signaling as an additional regulatory step to promote post-translational ribosome assembly specifically when cells can metabolically sustain protein translation. Like importins, ERGIC3 is also strongly implicated in several cancers (Hong et al., 2016; Lin et al., 2015; Wu et al., 2013) , but its molecular function has not been thoroughly investigated. In mammalian cells, ERGIC3 cycles between the ER and golgi membranes, where it contributes to anterograde and/or retrograde secretory transport (Breuza et al., 2004; Orci et al., 2003; Yoo et al., 2019) . ERGIC3 is orthologous to yeast Erv46, which forms a retrograde receptor complex that is required for efficient localization of ER resident proteins that do not have the canonical C-terminal HDEL sequence (Shibuya et al., 2015) . To our knowledge, ERGIC3 has not been directly studied in plants to date. Deeper understanding of the molecular function of ERGIC3 may reveal why it is subject to metabolic regulation by TOR-LARP1-5\u2032TOP signaling.",

            "text": "Our parallel global profiling approach revealed that inactivating TOR rapidly represses translation in the chloroplast, and we observed a corresponding significant decrease in chlorophyll levels ( Figure 3G ), suggesting that TOR activity is required to maintain chloroplast physiology. In agreement with the glucose-TOR activation transcriptome, however, our experiments also show that briefly inactivating TOR does not impact the expression of photosynthesis-associated nuclear genes. Separate studies have demonstrated that prolonged inhibition of TOR activity can strongly repress expression of photosynthesis-associated nuclear genes (PhANGs). The coordinated expression of the nuclear and chloroplast genomes has been a major research focus for several decades, with the strong consensus that defective translation of the chloroplast transcriptome triggers retrograde signals that suppress PhANG expression (Brunkard and Burch-Smith, 2018; Koussevitzky et al., 2007; Susek et al., 1993; Woodson and Chory, 2008) . We speculate, therefore, that inactivating TOR first represses translation in the chloroplast, and that this secondarily leads to repression of PhANG expression via retrograde signaling, a hypothesis that we are currently pursuing. A previous study of ribosome protein abundance in plants with prolonged, mildly attenuated TOR expression in stable TOR RNAi lines found reduced levels of chloroplast ribosome subunits, and argued that this could be due to translational control via pyrimidine-rich elements in the 5\u2032 leader of some cytosolic mRNAs that encode chloroplast RPs (Dobrenel et al., 2016) . We did not observe any clear effects of Torin2 treatment on the TE of nuclear-encoded chloroplast RP mRNAs, however, indicating that TOR can control chloroplast genome expression through other mechanisms.",

In humans, elevated TOR activity promotes transcription of gelsolin genes (Nie et al., 2015) , which are orthologous to Arabidopsis VILLIN genes.

For example, CCT6B, a subunit of the chaperonin containing TCP1 (CCT) complex (also known as TRiC), is a 5\u2032TOP mRNA, and several other CCT mRNAs only slightly missed our stringent criteria for defining 5\u2032TOP mRNAs (e.g., CCT7 has a TOPscore of 8.4, was relatively translationally repressed 1.4-fold by Torin2 in wild-type, and was not relatively translationally repressed by Torin2 in larp1). The CCT complex promotes assembly of many proteins, including RAPTOR and LST8 (Cu\u00e9llar et al., 2019) , but is most famously associated with assembly of actin and tubulin subunits (Balchin et al., 2018; Dekker et al., 2008; Yam et al., 2008) . In mammals, TOR regulates CCT complex function by promoting phosphorylation of the CCT complex (Abe et al., 2009) , indicating that metabolic regulation of CCT complex activity by TOR may occur through multiple signal transduction pathways in different eukaryotic lineages. ACTIN DEPOLYMERIZING FACTOR 11 (ADF11), part of the cofilin family of actin destabilizing proteins, is also encoded by a 5\u2032TOP mRNA, providing another possible connection between TOR and actin filamentation (Bernstein and Bamburg, 2010) .

E2F transcription factors are regulated by the Cyclin (Cyc)-Cyclin-Dependent Kinase (CDK)-Retinoblastoma-related (RBR) pathway during cell cycle progression. In this canonical pathway, D-type cyclins bind to and activate cyclin-dependent kinases that phosphorylate and thus inactivate Retinoblastoma-related RBR1, de-repressing E2F transcription factors that drive the transcriptional program of the G1/S phase cell cycle transition (Ach et al., 1997; Choi and Anders, 2014; Ebol et al., 2004; Huntley et al., 1998; Serrano et al., 1993; Xie et al., 1996) . In addition to the glucose-TOR-E2Fa pathway, a recent investigation identified multiple recessive alleles of yak1 in a screen for mutants resistant to root growth arrest after treatment with TOR inhibitors (Forzani et al., 2019) . Subsequent analyses indicated that YAK1 is required for at least two responses to TOR inhibitors: repressing the expression of cyclins and inducing the expression of the SIAMESE-RELATED (SMR) family of CDK inhibitors (Forzani et al., 2019) .",

            "text": "We found that two critical D-type cyclins, CycD2;1 and CycD3;2, are translationally regulated by TOR-LARP1-5\u2032TOP signaling. In humans, several cyclins are translationally regulated by TOR, but through at least two distinct molecular pathways. Human CCNG1, a member of the atypical G-type cyclin family that evolved in animals, is encoded by a core 5\u2032TOP mRNA and is clearly regulated by TOR-LARP1-5\u2032TOP signaling (Philippe et al., 2020) . Unlike typical cyclins, CCNG1 is understood to primarily function in coordinating the vertebrate-specific PP2A-Mdm2-p53 pathway that controls stressresponsive cell cycle arrest (Bennin et al., 2002; Gordon et al., 2018; Okamoto et al., 2002; Russell et al., 2012) . Human CCND1, which encodes a member of the D-type cyclin family that promotes the G1 to S phase cell cycle transition, is also translationally promoted when TOR is active, but apparently through LARP1-independent mechanisms, including the TOR-4EBP-eIF4E signaling axis (Averous et al., 2008; Musgrove, 2006) . In Arabidopsis, in addition to CycD2;1 and CycD3;2, which are two clear examples of 5\u2032TOP mRNAs, we found that cyclin mRNAs have significantly higher TOPscores than other transcripts (median = 2.6, mean = 3.5, n = 16, Mann-Whitney U test, p = 0.001), suggesting that other cyclin mRNAs may also be regulated by the TOR-LARP1-5\u2032TOP signaling axis in some contexts. Therefore, we propose that TOR translationally controls expression of cyclins to promote cell cycle progression, in addition to regulation of YAK1 upstream (Forzani et al., 2019) and E2Fa downstream of cyclin-CDK-RBR1 signaling. Ongoing investigations of the role of TOR in cell cycle regulation could elucidate the relative contributions of the transcriptional, translational, and post-translational regulatory steps in this multilayered TOR signaling network (Ahmad et al., 2019; Lokdarshi et al., 2020) .",

PEAPOD2 (PPD2) is a member of the TIFY transcription factor family that represses transcription of CycD3;2 to stop cell cycle progression (Baekelandt et al., 2018) , which is required for patterning the leaf lamina (White, 2006) . Although they act antagonistically, PPD2 and CycD3;2 were both identified in our analyses as 5\u2032TOP mRNAs regulated by TOR-LARP1 signaling. Similarly, we found that several steps of auxin signaling can be regulated by TOR-LARP1-5\u2032TOP signaling, including translational control of transcripts that encode the Aux/IAA transcriptional repressors (which are degraded by auxin-sensing pathways) and that encode the putative auxin efflux carrier PIN proteins. Auxin has previously been shown to promote TOR activity, at least under certain physiological conditions (Beltr\u00e1n-Pe\u00f1a et al., 2002; G. H. Chen et al., 2018; X. Li et al., 2017; Schepetilnikov et al., 2017; Turck et al., 2004) , and auxin is a well-established plant growth substance that stimulates cell division in roots. Unraveling the interplay between auxin, TOR, and cell cycle progression will require detailed mechanistic studies focused on the role of LARP1-5\u2032TOP translational control of gene expression.",

            "text": "In this report, we showed that TOR, the master regulator of eukaryotic metabolism, coordinates mRNA translation in plants through diverse mechanisms at transcriptional, translational, and post-translational levels. Focusing on one of these mechanisms, we demonstrated that TOR specifically controls the translation of a distinct subset of mRNAs that begin with a 5\u2032TOP motif that is recognized by the putative TOR substrate, LARP1, identified in our TOR-sensitive phosphoproteomic screen. Rigorous phenotypic analysis and global profiling experiments in larp1 mutants revealed that, although LARP1 is not absolutely essential for plant development under standard physiological conditions, LARP1 is required to maintain TOR homeostasis in plants and to support wild-type growth rates (Figure 3 ). Our studies elucidate conserved transcripts that are translationally controlled by TOR-LARP1-5\u2032TOP signaling in both humans and Arabidopsis. Unexpectedly, although 5\u2032TOP motifs are most famously associated with cytosolic RP mRNAs in the vertebrate lineage, we found that the conserved eukaryotic 5\u2032TOP mRNAs instead encode other genes involved in the regulation of translation, ribosome biogenesis, and subcellular translocation. These evolutionary insights may prove useful for ongoing investigations of the role of LARP1 in cancers, genetic disorders, and infection by viruses, including Zika virus and SARS-CoV-2.",

(A) Phosphoprotein levels decreased for the majority (80%) of the 85 proteins that were significantly differentially phosphorylated after Torin2 treatment. The scatterplot displays the difference in phosphoprotein abundance in Torin2-treated seedlings for every detected phosphoprotein. Statistically significant differences are indicated by colored dots (red for decreased abundance, blue for increased abundance; p < 0.05, Mann-Whitney U test). (B) The protein ID, name, phosphosite(s), and the sequence of individual detected phosphopeptides from select proteins are shown. (C) The abundance of phosphopeptides shown in (B) in response to Torin2 are represented by dots in this scatterplot (mocktreated, dark blue; Torin2-treated, light blue). Black lines represent the mean and standard error. In each case, the difference was statistically significant (p < 0.05, t test). (D) Alignment of RAPTOR and TOPLESS protein sequences surrounding the phosphosites that were sensitive to Torin2 treatment. A. thaliana (1) shows RAPTOR1 and TOPLESS sequences; A. thaliana (2) shows the sequences of their closely-related paralogues, RAPTOR2 and TOPLESS-RELATED 1. Sequences from representative land plant species are shown in phylogenetic order: A. thaliana (thale cress, a rosid) Solanum lycopersicum (tomato, an asterid), Oryza sativa (rice, a monocot), Amborella trichocarpa (representing a basal lineage of angiosperms), Selaginella moellendorffii (spikemoss, a lycophyte), and Marchantia polymorph (common liverwort, representing a basal lineage of land plants). Phosphosites are highlighted in blue. (E) Categorical analysis of the molecular functions of Torin2-sensitive phosphoproteins is shown. (F) Categorical analysis of the subcellular localization of Torin2-sensitive phosphoproteins is shown. Figure 3 . LARP1 is required for normal plant growth and physiology. (A) Arabidopsis larp1 seedlings grown for 15 days in half-strength MS agar plates were smaller than WT seedlings (white scale bar, 1 cm), with shorter roots (B) and smaller leaf area (measuring the area of the first two true leaves) (C) in larp1 than WT seedlings. Results are represented with violin plots; the line shows the median and the dots represent each measurement (***p < 0.001, t test). (D) Leaf outlines of 4-weeks old WT and larp1 plants (Scale bar = 1 cm) showed that recently-emerged larp1 leaves (L12) are significantly smaller than WT, as shown with violin plots in (E). Results are represented with violin plots; the line shows the median and the dots represent each measurement (*p < 0.05). (F) Alanine levels were higher in larp1 leaves than in WT. Free amino acid levels are depicted in a bar graph showing average levels in WT (dark grey) and larp1 (light grey) from 4 samples, with error bars representing standard error (*p < 0.05). (G) Total chlorophyll levels were reduced in WT seedlings (dark grey) when treated with 5.0 \u03bcm Torin2 and were significantly lower in the larp1 background (light grey) regardless of treatment (n > 4). The bar graph shows mean total chlorophyll levels and standard error (***p < 0.001, **p < 0.01, *p < 0.05, n.s. = not significant).",

Most significantly, photosynthesis-associated nuclear gene expression was strongly repressed in larp1 mutants. Here and below, the observed foldchange in mRNA levels for each category is shown in box-whisker plots drawn with Tukey's method; the middle line represents the median and the dot represents the mean of the fold-changes. p values for each category were determined by the Mann-Whitney U test using MapMan gene ontologies and corrected for false positives with the stringent Benjamini-Yekutieli method. (B) Correlating with lower chlorophyll levels ( Figure 3G ), global quantitative proteomics revealed that most photosynthesis-related protein levels were lower in larp1 mutants. The color-coded dots represent proteins that were detected at significantly higher (blue) or lower (red) levels in larp1 compared to WT, with representative proteins labeled. (C) Many transcripts show differences in TE in larp1 compared to wild-type, as depicted in box-whisker plots (drawn as in A) showing significantly-affected MapMan categories with p values colored as in panel E. (D) Torin2 treatment in the larp1 background affects the mRNA levels of multiple functional categories, mostly similar to the effects of Torin2 on mRNA levels in wild-type plants ( Figure 1C ), including repression of protein biosynthesis, cell cycle progression, and protein sorting, alongside induction of stress responses and protein degradation pathways. (E) The TE of cytosolic ribosomal mRNAs is significantly repressed by Torin2 treatment in larp1 mutants. (F) TOR activity is reduced in larp1 mutants. Observed differences in phosphoprotein abundance in mock-treated larp1 compared to wild-type (y axis) are mapped against Torin2-treated WT versus to mock-treated WT (x axis); phosphoproteins that accumulated to significantly different levels (p < 0.05) in both comparisons are highlighted in red and blue. The strong positive correlation shown suggests that the TOR signaling network is relatively inactive in larp1 mutants than in WT. (G) Phosphorylation of the direct TOR substrate, S6K-pT449, is drastically reduced in larp1 mutants compared to WT, confirming the results shown in panel F. The densitometry ratio between the levels of S6K-pT449 and total S6K are shown above. This experiment was repeated three times with consistent results. TOPscores were calculated by scoring the transcription start site (TSS) reads for a given gene. Briefly, for every nucleotide in the annotated 5\u2032 leader of a gene, the number of TSS-Seq reads was multiplied by the length of the pyrimidine tract (TOP) starting at that nucleotide. The sum of these weighted reads was then divided by the total number of reads throughout the 5\u2032 leader (R). (B) Representative examples of TOPscore calculations in Arabidopsis. Nucleotides are color-coded for pyrimidines (blue) or purines (gold). The height of each nucleotide corresponds to the number of TSS-Seq 5\u2032 ends mapped to that nucleotide. (C,D) TCTP1 and PABP8 are 5\u2032TOP mRNAs in Arabidopsis. Gene models show the 5\u2032 leader (narrow white rectangle), open reading frame (wide grey rectangles), splice sites (thin lines), and 5\u2032 untranslated region. RNA-Seq and TSS-Seq read coverages are shown. The sequences of TSS-Seq peaks in the 5\u2032 leader are shown as in (B). (E) Categorical analysis of TOPscores by MapMan revealed four functional categories with significantly different TOPscores compared to the set of all genes (p < 0.05 after Benjamini-Yekutieli correction). Box-whisker plots show the distribution of TOPscores for each category. TOPscores in each category were compared using Mann-Whitney U tests; *p < 0.05. (F) In wild-type seedlings, TOPscores for transcripts that were translationally repressed by Torin2 treatment are significantly higher than the distribution of TOPscores transcriptome-wide and than the TOPscores for transcripts that were translationally repressed by Torin2 treatment in larp1 mutants (Mann-Whitney U, *p < 0.05). There was no statistically significant difference in TOPscore distributions between the whole transcriptome and the set of transcripts that were translationally repressed in larp1. (G) High-confidence 5\u2032TOP mRNAs in Arabidopsis participate in diverse biological functions, including RNA metabolism, protein metabolism, cell cycle regulation, and subcellular trafficking. Figure 5 , supplement 1. TOR-LARP1-5\u2032TOP signaling in Arabidopsis seedlings regulates translation of mRNAs that encode deeply conserved eukaryotic proteins, plant lineage-specific proteins, and diverse proteins involved in ribosome biogenesis. (A) Several mRNAs are translationally regulated by TOR-LARP1-5\u2032TOP signaling in both humans (Philippe et al., 2020) and Arabidopsis. (B) Some 5\u2032TOP mRNAs in Arabidopsis encode proteins that evolved in the plant lineage, including genes involved in chloroplast physiology and developmental patterning. (C) Although the translation of only a few RP transcripts are directly controlled by TOR-LARP1-5\u2032TOP signaling in Arabidopsis seedlings, multiple other steps of ribosome biogenesis are subject to TOR-LARP1-5\u2032TOP regulation.
