For example, researchers not only look for an 'average effect' of a drug on a typical patient, but also seek to understand individual variability. The presence of variability impacts significantly on the success of clinical trials and failure to identify this variability can result in the clinical trial being under-powdered to detect a treatment effect. For clinicians, failure to recognize variability can result in unintended toxicity or excessive harm in certain patients. Hence, understanding variability is critically important in both research and clinical practice.",

Traditional criteria such as age, clinical settings or disease severity are commonly used to enlist patients into clinical trials. However, these are crude measures of the inherent heterogeneity of a very complex syndrome in a diverse patient population. Although simple physiological parameters (e.g., systemic inflammatory response syndrome [SIRS] criteria), organ level indices (e.g., circulatory failure), or a combination of both (e.g., APACHE score) have been proved to be helpful in epidemiological studies, they are too non-specific as criteria to stratify patients in clinical trials. With the exception of recombinant activated protein C and anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) therapy, attempts to select patients based on disease severity or baseline mortality risk have consistently failed, as evidenced from analyses of clinical trials on anti-coagulant therapy, anti-inflammatory drugs, or low-dose corticosteroids [11, 12] . Investigators can also measure a vast array of physiological parameters and serum cytokines in sepsis patients. However, we do not know how these measurements relate to the observed heterogeneity, nor do we know how they can be used to predict a patient's possible response to a new drug. Consequently, there is currently no agreed upon method to identify and measure heterogeneity in sepsis patients.",

Fundamental questions have therefore been raised on the effectiveness of such criteria to define the complex range of heterogeneity found in septic patients [18] . Our data provide the first genomic evidence that the grouping of patients based on such criteria is too limited to represent the full spectrum of heterogeneity in sepsis patients.

A total of 3,714 genes were found to have their expression intensity altered by the endotoxin challenge. This is an impressively large number because it represents over 14 % of the protein-coding genes. When these genes were followed at 2, 4, 6, 9 and 24 hours, more complex changes were exhibited. In addition, the authors performed network analysis (see Table 1 for more details) and reported a further discovery of a vast interconnecting network of cellular activities. For example, by honing in on just one gene alone (i.e., nuclear factor kappa B), the authors unveiled a total of 619 interactions between 150 genes. With over three thousand genes showing simultaneous changes, the number of potential interactions is immeasurable. The immense complexity of these data provides an exciting opportunity to develop a potentially more powerful method to classify sepsis patients into clinically relevant and molecularly precise subgroups.",

We performed a pair-wise comparison of all the signature genes between each study. Our analysis of these studies reveals two important findings (Fig. 2) . References for included studies: Tang-2 [14] , Ramilo [20] , McDunn [21] , Tang-1 [15] , Prucha [22] First, there are over 400 signature genes that were identified as putative genomic markers of human sepsis. The vast majority of these genes have never been studied in the past. These data sets contain valuable sources of information and could potentially lead to the discovery of novel pathways which may help researchers explain heterogeneity. In fact, many of these genes are subsequently identified to be those involved in nucleosome assembly, signal transduction, transcription/translation regulation, and control of protein complex assembly.",

While there are main hubs in these networks, there are also extensive collateral sub-Rethinking Sepsis: New Insights from Gene Expression Profiling Studies networks that will provide alternative routes. This is akin to the airline network, where travelers can arrive at the same destination via complex re-routing or the use of alternative airlines. Consequently, there is a large amount of redundancy in its signaling system. To complicate matters further, there are conflicting feedback loops acting on each hub. For any given biological signal, multiple outcomes are possible depending on a variety of factors, such as the temporal pattern of each feedback loop and summation of individual stimuli. Cellular function is therefore a result of an integrative process. Such a system gives rise to a huge potential for variability and, hence, heterogeneity.",

This has not been supported by data from the gene-expression studies we surveyed, where investigators rarely reported the activation of well-known inflammatory genes, such as TNF, interleukin (IL)-1, IL-2, IL-6, or IL-10. Second, the gene-expression studies suggest that immune suppression is present in both the early and late phases of sepsis. Again, this is in contrast to the established model of sepsis where immune suppression is thought to occur later.

The analysis was performed on over 130 biological pathways, including those known to be involved in immunological functions. Some of the important findings are presented in Table 2 . As expected, well known pathways such as Toll-like receptor (TLR) or TNF signaling are confirmed to be involved in sepsis. However, our analysis also discovered a large number of pathways, many of which have not been studied previously with regard to their involvement in sepsis. This analysis demonstrates that it is feasible to assay immunological dysfunction on a global scale and to yield highly valuable biological information regarding the roles of both established and unknown pathways. Based on the data above, we hypothesize that a comprehensive architecture of the gene regulatory network of immune response in sepsis can be constructed using geneexpression data. Such a database should include transcriptional information on: 1) all functional pathways; 2) all possible interactions between genes and molecules; 3) how the system functions as a whole in response to perturbations (e.g., to trauma, ischemia, or infectious stimuli); 4) mathematical modeling which will help investigators predict the existence of hidden interactions or feedback loops.",
