To date, LTC settings are the segment of the healthcare system with the most notable burden of COVID-19 cases. 3 What is more alarming is that the overall quality ratings of LTC settings with COVID-19 outbreaks in King's County, Washington are at least 3 of 5 stars. 4, 5 Further, the average daily hours for direct care of residents by licensed nursing staff at these sites is at or above the national average.

Currently, this may lead to significant delays in discharge. As testing becomes more readily available, this should become less onerous for hospitals. Third, LTC settings should screen potential admissions for both typical and atypical signs and symptoms of COVID-19 ( Table 1) .

Since severe symptoms may take several days to develop, older adults hospitalized for what appears to be an exacerbation of a known condition, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, may be discharged to a LTC setting before there is clinical suspicion, let alone test results, for COVID-19. On March 13 th 2020, the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) issued an emergency declaration temporarily suspending the requirement for patients to have a 3-day qualifying stay prior to discharge to a skilled nursing facility; this renders the potential for delayed recognition of COVID-19 occurring in a LTC setting much greater. 8 Fourth, LTC settings that are currently COVID-19 na\u00efve should not accept any new admissions for whom there may be a concern for COVID-19. People recovering from emergent surgeries and other acute illnesses may have needs that exceed what can be provided at home and thus will need LTC settings for rehabilitation and recovery.",

Fifth, both acute and LTC settings need to work together to find places for COVID-19 patients who are ready to leave the hospital but are not able to return to the community. Healthcare systems and networks are best suited to implement this recommendation. LTC settings that already have residents with COVID-19 may consider temporarily designating their building as a COVID-19 recovery site. Those buildings should then also be supported with increased staff and resources, including increased access to COVID-19 tests and to PPE including N-95 or equivalent respirators. The goal is to increase capacity and help keep hospital beds open while still permitting separation of patients with COVID-19 from those without the infection.",

Many LTC settings are on the verge or have already exhausted their supply of gowns, gloves, and facemasks, despite attempts to practice PPE stewardship. Without PPE, LTC staff cannot carry out current recommendations to protect themselves or their residents from COVID-19. As staff develop respiratory symptoms and cannot care for residents, the number of healthcare workers available to care for residents will diminish. Inadequate staffing jeopardizes patient safety. Rather than increased inspections, to support the care and safety of their residents, LTC settings need increased access to COVID-19 testing and to PPE.",

To that end, we propose the following measures to help protect the 1.4 million individuals that already occupy beds in one of 15,600 LTC settings. 7 First, LTC settings should only accept patients with an active COVID-19 infection if they can provide effective airborne isolation. Although the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention no longer recommends negative pressure room for the care of COVID-19 patients, several essential elements remain including a single room in which the resident can safely reside with the door closed, which stipulates that person is not at risk for falls or wandering. Other necessities include ensuring an adequate supply of personal protective equipment (PPE) which includes regular masks for routine care and N95 respirators for aerosol generating procedures and ensuring there are enough staff members who are trained in proper use of PPE to meet all the care needs for those residents. The LTC setting's Infection Preventionist, Administrator, Director of Nursing, and Medical Director need to jointly determine if their building can provide these resources, and reassess that capability on at least a weekly, if not daily, basis.",
