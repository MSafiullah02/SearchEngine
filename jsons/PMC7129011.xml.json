Such routine drug assessment processes consider evidence on quality, safety, efficacy, and cost-effectiveness. Because of the increase in the number of different vaccines available and advances in the science behind decision making, we have drawn on existing literature and practices to develop the arguments around potential disparities with other pharmaceuticals when assessing vaccines for public funding. These arguments revolve around vaccine-specific features of herd immunity and eradication, which are not evident in pharmaceuticals, and features for which the effects of quality-of-life losses in very young children, parental care and work loss, time preference, macroeconomics, and uncertainty substantially influence cost-effectiveness estimates. Vaccines may increasingly be judged as unacceptable if these features are not acknowledged. We also illustrate these points for five specific vaccines that are currently under consideration for widespread use in high-income countries. We use the term \u201ccost-effectiveness\u201d in a broad sense throughout this article, encompassing cost-utility and cost-benefit analysis, although there are technical differences.1\n",

The Australian Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee is a rigorous and well-run system for evaluating drugs for acute care, chronic disease, palliation, and more recently vaccines. Many other countries have adopted a similar philosophy towards cost-effectiveness considerations for funding pharmaceuticals (eg, Belgium, Finland, Norway, Canada [Ontario], Portugal, Sweden, Netherlands, UK, and USA [some organisations]), but they deal with preventive public-health measures, such as mass vaccination, in different ways. Some countries have specific advisory groups to make funding recommendations on vaccinations (eg, UK Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation, US Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices). Often, cost-effectiveness evidence for vaccines is assessed in the same manner as for any drug. Nevertheless, as we discuss below, vaccination has special features that make it particularly challenging to assess. Furthermore, vaccination constitutes one of the largest preventive health programmes around the world, and increasing pressures on health-care budgets are as much a challenge for the use of vaccines as for other drugs.",

Furthermore, vaccination itself may modify vaccine effectiveness over time because of factors such as strain replacement and cross reactivity. Some of these indirect effects improve the cost-effectiveness (eg, non-exposure of most of the unvaccinated, cross reactivity), whereas others may reduce the cost-effectiveness (eg, shift in the average age of infection, serotype replacement). For most vaccination programmes, the sum of these effects substantially improves cost-effectiveness, but sometimes the reverse may be true.8, 9\n",

The risk perceptions driving this trade-off are distorted as a result of imperfect information. Reductions in vaccine-preventable disease make people believe that their child's risk of disease has decreased. However, their risk is highly dependent on historical and future rates of exposure and vaccination in the rest of the population and can quickly rebound when uptake declines.13, 14 Therefore, government intervention in the form of subsidies or public funding is required to ensure that vaccine uptake remains high enough to guarantee beneficial herd immunity.15 The UK's recent struggle with the measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine uptake illustrates this point.16 For other pharmaceuticals, this kind of trade-off is not even conceivable.",

These indirect costs can be very large for infectious diseases that affect virtually the entire population, even for generally benign illness. For example, the cost-effectiveness of childhood VZV vaccination is unlikely to be thought acceptable from the health-care budget perspective, but is possibly cost-saving from a societal perspective.8, 11, 27\n",

Discounting is a technique that aims to put costs and benefits occurring at different timepoints on the same basis of comparison. Discounting scales down future events, such that, the further into the future they occur or the higher the discount rate, the less important they are to a decision maker in the present. In health economics, there is continued debate about whether the discount rate for health outcomes should be lower than or equal to that for costs.34, 35 For curative therapies, most benefits accrue immediately or shortly after the intervention is initiated, and the cost-effectiveness of these interventions is therefore largely independent of these methodological disagreements on discounting. Conversely, the cost-effectiveness of most prevention programmes is highly sensitive to discounting because of the long time spans over which benefits accrue. A slight decrease in discount rate\u2014eg, from 5% to 3%\u2014could change the cost-effectiveness of vaccination from unacceptable to attractive. Country-specific recommendations on discount rates vary to the extent that a vaccine could be deemed cost effective in one country and cost-ineffective in another for this reason alone (table 1\n).",

One can argue that discounting at a constant rate exaggerates the importance we give for the present over the future.46, 47, 48 This assertion is backed by psychological empirical evidence, which suggests that the difference between equidistant outcomes is thought less important the further into the future the outcomes occur.47 So-called \u201cslow\u201d discounting procedures could be used for cases in which the discount rate decreases and falls close to zero for the more distant future (eg, 3\u00b75% for years 0\u201310, 1\u00b75% for years 11\u201320, 0% thereafter), thus yielding a higher present value of benefits.49, 50 Additionally, time preference may exist only to the time until risk exposure, and not the time until health consequences from risk exposure arise (eg, cervical cancer is the health consequence of a much earlier exposure to HPV).51 Adjustment of the discount procedure to account for these aspects is not current practice, but would substantially improve the estimated cost-effectiveness of prevention versus cure.49, 50 Currently, policy makers are presented with very wide cost-effectiveness ranges for preventive public-health actions when sensitivity to discounting is illustrated to them. In 1968, Baumol52 noted the \u201csorry spectacle\u201d that economists provided through their diverging understandings on this subject, and his assertion that \u201clittle help is provided to the decision maker who is confronted with such an enormous range of estimates\u201d rings through 40 years of subsequent vaccination research.",

In high-income countries, the main benefit of rotavirus vaccines is the prevention of parental care and productivity losses in virtually all households with infants or toddlers. However, as we have outlined, gains in quality-adjusted life-years in such young children and their parents, as well as parental care and work loss, are not standard features in cost-effectiveness analyses. Given the current price setting (\u20ac80\u2013120 per fully vaccinated child) and the recommended schedule for these vaccines (two doses Rotarix [GlaxoSmithKline]; three doses Rotateq [Merck]), they are unlikely to be judged as cost effective unless these so-called \u201csoft\u201d benefits are also included.32, 56, 57, 58 But if they are, why should they not also be considered for all other health-care interventions, thus potentially reshuffling the comparison between all health-care programmes (including the other vaccines discussed here)?

The cost-effectiveness of HPV vaccines depends heavily on the choice of the discounting approach used.59, 60 Furthermore, mathematical models for HPV vaccination ideally have to build in complexities related to herd-immunity effects from vaccinating cohorts of girls only and boys additionally, the optimum frequency of cervical cancer screening, and type-specific progressive infection and replacement, all over long time periods, which makes this a very complex programme to assess properly.59, 61 However, a more simple approach, based on static models, could give insights on the basic question: should we vaccinate girls before their sexual debut?60 Such models would underestimate the benefits of HPV vaccination, and therefore would only be helpful for policy if they resulted in favourable cost-effectiveness ratios. The static models that have been published so far have tended to be favourable.59, 60, 62 Policy makers could therefore quickly decide about vaccinating a limited number of cohorts before their sexual debut, and have reasonably confident cost-effectiveness evidence to support this decision. However, they cannot rely on such analyses to decide on more complicated aspects of the programme, such as the breadth of the programme in girls and boys.

Since chickenpox infects virtually all children by age 12 years, the accumulated societal savings, including avoided parental care and productivity losses, are likely to be greater than the costs of vaccination at a price of \u20ac15\u201350 per fully vaccinated person. However, childhood VZV vaccination increases the occurrence of shingles in adults and this may be such that it counteracts these societal savings and leads to adverse health effects.63 A further complication is that with single-dose infant vaccination many teenage breakthrough cases can still be expected, but the addition of a second dose to prevent this would make it a much less cost-effective programme. Modified VZV vaccine in adults was recently shown to prevent shingles, and was shown by static models to be cost effective.64, 65\n",

Furthermore, preparing for pandemic influenza demands very large investments, and this can only be shown to be worthwhile by modelling.70 A policy-relevant approach to modelling the cost-effectiveness of pandemic influenza vaccination would entail considering macroeconomic impacts across sectors and across countries.21 Clearly, deciding on the best options to prevent and control influenza requires an analytical framework and applied modelling work that substantially digresses from usual drug assessments.",

Therefore, guidelines should also be adapted in general terms to allow for (1) a wider perspective to account for effects on third parties, if these are affected substantially by specific interventions (eg, parents experiencing a quality-of-life impact through the illness of their child); (2) a wider scope of costs to be included, if appropriate, than health-care system costs alone (eg, irrecoverable losses caused by modified behaviour when faced with a large public-health threat); and (3) alternative discounting techniques to deal with social time preference over long time periods.",
