Supplementary References Supplementary Fig. 2 Abundance of draft genomes. 18 bacterial and 6 viral draft genomes determined by assembly based methods. Heatmap indicates fractional abundance of species in the sample. Day of sample is indicated on top columns. For each 9-square group size fraction is indicated from left to right: >3 \u00b5m, 0.02 -3 \u00b5m, and 0.025 -0.2 \u00b5m, and top to bottom: Aerosol, SSML, and bulk water compartments. Schematic in upper right corner indicates this sample arrangement. Blanks indicate samples below threshold limits. Supplementary Fig. 3 Genome spatial coverage trimmed bacterial and viral populations aerosolization distribution. The ratio of fraction of genomes in aerosols to the fraction in bulk plotted against ratio of fraction of genomes in aerosols to those in sea surface is shown for bacteria, a, and viruses, b, in genome spatial coverage trimmed data sets on select days. The upper right quadrants of a and b indicate genomes enriched in aerosol relative to both bulk and SSML (A:B and A:S > 1); the lower left quadrants indicates genomes that are primarily waterborne (A:B and A:S < 1). The upper left quadrants indicates genomes enriched relative to bulk but not SSML (A:B > 1, A:S < 1), and the lower right indicates genomes enriched in aerosol relative to the surface but not bulk (A:B < 1, A:S > 1). The data sets represent a, 76 bacterial genomes, and b, 30 viral genomes identified by read-based taxonomic assignments trimmed of species with low genome spatial coverage. Supplementary Fig. 4 Population distribution of aerosolization and surface enrichment data sets. Histograms of all aerosolization factors (AFs) and surface enrichment factors (S:B) for bacteria, a-c, and viruses, d-f given by log values. a, d represent pooled AF and S:B values for abundance trimmed but not coverage trimmed data. b, e demonstrate day resolved variance in A:B distributions of these partially trimmed data sets. c, f show the pooled AF and S:B values for the fully trimmed data sets. Supplementary Fig. 5 Bacterial aerosolization and surface enrichment. Taxonomy, aerosolization factors, and surface enrichment of bacterial genomes of spatial coverage and abundance trimmed data. Phylum, class, and orders are color coded to reflect species relationships. Genome annotation by read-based analysis, Heat map column labels indicate day and measurement. Aerosolization factor is expressed as the fraction of genomes in aerosol to bulk or surface (A:B or A:S). Surface enrichment is the fraction in SSML to the fraction in the bulk (S:B). Heat map values indicate ratio values (bottom legend). Species abundance is reported as the sum of fraction of the population across the experiment and as the number of samples above 0.5% of the population.",

Major phytoplankton blooms at Scripps Pier generally have chlorophyll a levels in the range of 18 -219 \u00b5g L -1 1 , placing this on the low end of natural major bloom from the same source water. Bacteria counts were found to be in the range of 0.65 X 10 6 \u00b1 0.01 X 10 6 to 3.98 X 10 6 \u00b1 0.02 X 10 6 cells mL -1 in bulk water, 0.36 X 10 6 \u00b1 0.01 X 10 6 to 3.34 X 10 6 \u00b1 0.03 X 10 6 cells mL -1 in SSML, and 0.09 X 10 7 \u00b1 0.06X 10 7 to 5.83 X 10 7 \u00b1 0.58 X 10 7 cells m -3 in aerosol. Oceanic values for bacteria range from 10 4 to 10 6 cells mL -1 2 , making the values here on the high end of ocean concentrations. However, considering bacterial abundance increases linearly with chlorophyll 3 and under certain conditions oceanic concentrations have been found to up to 10 8 cells mL -1 4 , these values seem especially relevant. Aerosol bacteria concentrations are estimated to be ~10 2 to 10 4 cells m -3 5 . Virus abundances were found to be 1 X 10 7 to 8 X 10 7 cells mL -1 in bulk and SSML and 0.3 X 10 7 to 7.7 X 10 7 cells m -3 in aerosol which is ~10-fold higher than water bacteria concentrations and approximately the same as bacterial concentrations in aerosol.

DNA abundance was determined by Qubit\u2122 (ThermoFisher).Metagenomic sequencing. A total of 625 million reads were trimmed and quality filtered generating on average 3.0 million sequence reads with lengths of 2 x 142 bp and GC content of 48% (Supplementary Table 2). Taxonomic profiling generated a total of 700 bacterial, 10 archaeal and 28 viral species in samples from the 0.02-3 \u00b5m size fraction after data filtering. The >3 \u00b5m and 0.025-0.2 \u00b5m fraction were also trimmed similarly to generate 613 species (576 bacteria, 8 archaea, 29 viruses) and 627 species (585 bacteria, 7 archaea, 35 viruses), respectively. The viral species from the three fractions were pooled to yield 46 viral species. Coverage analysis. 198 bacteria and 46 viral species identified using Kraken were further examined for genomic coverage. Scaffolds from species' assignments were examined against published genomes (Supplementary",
