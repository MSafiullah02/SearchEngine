Evidence demonstrates that the virus is transmitted mainly among people who are in close contact with one another or through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes. Although touching infected surfaces or objects is not generally considered the main mode of transmission, that also may be possible (6, 7) . Routine airborne transmission cannot be excluded, which is supported by the cluster of more than 600 (8) cases of infection inside the Diamond Princess cruise ship. In addition, more than 3,000 infected health care workers in Hubei province (9) and 2,055 laboratory-confirmed cases from 476 hospitals across China have been reported as of February 20, 2020 (10) , and the infection rates of serious and critical cases dropped dramatically from 45.0% in early January to 3.7% by the end of the month (11) . It has also been proposed by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that health care providers caring for patients with COVID-19 are at elevated risk of exposure (12) .",

However, a certain number of patients will spread virus to others while they themselves stay asymptomatic (11) . The COVID-19 virus is confirmed by testing for 2019-nCoV on respiratory material or serum by using reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis in accordance with the protocol established by the World Health Organization (WHO) (17) . A second test or even more tests are needed because false negative RT-PCR results have been generated in 3% (5 of 167) patients with positive chest computed tomography (CT) findings (18) and in some patients who have recovered from COVID-19 disease (19) .

The current treatment plans for treating COVID-19 patients include early supportive therapy; monitoring, prevention, and management of hypoxemic respiratory failure; acute respiratory distress syndrome; septic shock; and other complications. There is still a pressing need to accelerate protocols that lead to the discovery and implementation of rapid point-of-care diagnostic testing, effective antiviral therapies, and ultimately, a safe and immunogenic vaccine, despite the 522 clinical trials that are ongoing in China alone, as of 3:30 am, March 24, 2020 (China central standard time [CST]) (21) . Remdesivir (Gilead Sciences, Foster City, California), an antiviral medicine which may be potentially effective for treating this novel coronavirus (22) , has entered clinical trials.",

Presently, it is urgent that health care providers take appropriate and effective precautions when standing at the front line, and interventional radiologists (IRs) are not excepted. Although IR is not the practice where infectious diseases are typically treated, given the fact that an evolving role for IR in emergency treatment is revealed, IRs need to be equipped with sufficient knowledge of precaution in daily management of patients.

As a quick response to the outbreak of COVID-19, the Emergency Leadership Committee of this hospital was launched on January 21, 2020, to assess and manage the infection prevention control (IPC) risk; the infrastructure and workflow modifications; human resource control; logistical support; medical supplies and so forth, in preparation for the outbreak. According to COVID-19 infection conditions in Nanjing city and China, the hospital management strategies were dynamically divided into 3 phases. During Phase I, from January 16 to 24, structural and political alterations were made under the guidance of WHO and the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention. During Phase II, restrictions and controls were upgraded to the highest level, and regular hospital service was kept at a minimal level to ensure maximum prevention of cross-transmission between January 25 and February 14, as the epidemic became transmitted throughout the country. Conditions are currently in Phase III, since February 15, when new cases continuously decreased nationally as well as locally. The major challenge now is to create a balance between the elevated demand of regular medical services and anti-COVID-19 disease efforts.",

Given that most IR theaters are grouped inside the inpatient building, 2 of the 3 IR theaters were redesigned inside the quarantine area for patients without exclusion of COVID-19. As Q4 shown in Figure 1 , the modified IR theater was separated by clapboards into the quarantine zone and the regular zone with a buffer zone between them. However, a negative-pressure surgical theater, proposed during the 2003 SARS pandemic, was promoted as an alternative to and enhanced protection of surgical staff for providing a satisfactory airborne precaution. One of the 17 standard surgical theaters in the authors' hospital was adapted for negative-pressure and can be quickly equipped with mobile C-arm for angiography for IR patients with confirmed COVID-19 disease.",

Moreover, IRs can contribute to the treatment of COVID-19 patients who are experiencing emergency IR indications such as hemoptysis, gastrointestinal bleeding, vascular diseases, and others.
