Twenty (6.5%) of them were infected with hMPV, and they all developed pneumonia. Sixty five percent (13/20) of the cases were under 12 months. Phylogenetic analysis of F gene fragments indicated that three sub-genotypes of hMPV(A2a/A2b, B1,B2) circulated in Tianjin and A2b was the predominant subtype.

The objective of this study was to investigate the prevalence of hMPV in infants and young children who presented with ARTI in Tianjin, to identify the molecular characteristics of this virus, and to isolate hMPV in our laboratory. to February 2009 in Tianjin children's hospital were enrolled in the present study.

Two hundred and eighteen (70.3%) were male. Two hundred and eighty-two (91.0%) were pneumonia cases, 15 (4.8%) had bronchitis, and 13 (4.2%) had other respiratory infections.

Specific primer sequences and PCR amplification conditions have been described before [13, 14] . hMPV N-fragment-positive PCR specimens were detected by multi-PCR using Seeplex TM RV Detection Kit-1 (Seegene, Korea) for other respiratory viruses according to the manufacturer's instructions. First-strand of cDNA was synthesized using a RevertAid TM First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Fermentas, USA). hMPV F-fragment-positive products were purified using a QIAquick PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen, Germany) and sequenced by Invitrogen Biotechnology Co. Ltd., in Shanghai, China, using an ABI 3730 DNA Analyzer (Applied Biosystems, USA). Nucleotide sequence alignments were generated using the Clustal W algorithm of the MEGA 4.0.1 (http://www. megasoftware.net/mega.html) software. The nucleotide sequences identities were calculated by using DNAStar (version 5.01). Phylogenetic trees were constructed by MEGA, using the neighbor-joining method. Bootstrap proportions were plotted at the main internal branches of the phylogram to show support values. Other hMPV F gene sequences used in this study and their GenBank accession numbers are as follows: CAN00-14 (AY145299) and NL/1/00 (AF371337) for the A1 subtype; CAN97-83 (AY145296) and NL/17/00(AY304360) for the A2a subtype; JPS03-240 (AY530095) and BJ1887 (DQ843659) for the A2b subtype; CAN97-82 (AY145295) and NL/1/99 (AY525843) for the B1 subtype; CAN98-76 (AY145290), NL/1/94 (AY304362), and BJ1816 (DQ843658) for the B2 subtype; and APV-C (AY590688).",

It should be noted that the A2b subtype in Tianjin had a few differences compared with the same subtype in Beijing (BJ1887) and in Japan (JPS03-240).

Six days later, CPE (focal round cells, increased granules, cell disruption, and subsequent detachment) was observed in Vero-E6 cells. On day 9, most Vero-E6 cells were detached from the cell monolayer, but LLC-MK2 only showed mild CPE on day 10 after inoculation, which was easily confused with cell aging, as shown in Fig. 3 . The F fragment nucleotide sequences obtained from the passage-2 cultures were identical to those from the corresponding samples. It may be concluded that hMPV strains were successfully isolated in Vero-E6 cells and that hMPV could also be propagated in LLC-MK2 cells, but Vero-E6 cells are more susceptible to hMPV than LLC-MK2 cells are. We also found that hMPV isolation is dependent on the concentration of trypsin. Cells could not be maintained for a long period when 0.025% trypsin was used in the culture medium, whereas when using 0.013% trypsin, cells could grow well and be maintained for about 1 month.",

Data from the present study showed the incidence of hMPV in Tianjin was 6.5%, similar to 8.9% in Japan [5] , 6.4% in America [8] , 6.6% in France [9] , and 5.5% in Hong Kong [10] , but lower than 30% in Beijing, China [16] . Clinical manifestations associated with hMPV infections in young children range from common colds and mild upper respiratory tract infections to more severe lower respiratory tract infections, such as bronchiolitis and pneumonia. Several studies have demonstrated that hMPV is more likely to be associated with bronchiolitis in early childhood [17, 18] . However, other investigations, including the present study, showed that hMPV is more frequently associated with pneumonia than with bronchiolitis [19] [20] [21] . Data obtained from the present study indicate that 7.1% of children hospitalized with pneumonia in Tianjin suffer from hMPV infection. Some research has demonstrated that hMPV is involved in cases of coinfections, mainly with RSV, but the frequency and severity of symptoms vary greatly between reports [21, 22] . In this study, two hMPV-positive patients were simultaneously infected with adenovirus and rhinovirus, but no coinfection with RSV was found.",

In the present study, we found that 70% (14/ 20) of hMPVs detected in Tianjin were of the A2 subtype, and the F fragment nucleotide sequences shared an identity of 95.0-100.0%. Among them, 92.9% (13/14) were A2b subtype, and the nucleotide sequence identity within the A2b subtype was 99.4-100%, except for an A2b strain (TJ06-03) that shared a lower identity of 96.1-96.6% with other A2b subtype strains (data not shown). We also found that A2b (65%) was the predominant subtype circulating in Tianjin. It was observed that there was no correlation between the prevalent type and the season. To our knowledge, this may be the first report of the A2b subtype circulating in mainland China and becoming the most prevalent subtype in Tianjin. In the report by Huck et al. [29] , approximately one-third of all genotypes detected in Germany during two consecutive seasons were classified as A2b. Phylogenetic analysis in our study showed BJ1887, detected in Beijing, China, which had six nucleotide differences in the F gene fragment compared to the Japanese strain JPS03-240, should also be classified as A2b.",

The main reason is that it cannot replicate in the common cell lines, MDCK, HeLa, and RD, which are usually used to isolate respiratory viruses. The initial hMPV isolation was obtained in tertiary monkey kidney (tMK) cells [3] , and the cells usually displayed CPE on days 10-14 post-inoculation, which was longer than for other respiratory viruses. Subsequently, several groups have reported hMPV isolation in LLC-MK2 cells [11, 23, 24] . Further, it has been reported recently that the infection efficiency of hMPV in Vero-E6 cells was better than in LLC-MK2 cells [30] . At present, the only successful isolation of hMPV in mainland China was in Chongqing. In this study, we tried to culture hMPV in LLC-MK2 and Vero-E6 cells. The results showed that Vero-E6 cells were more sensitive than LLC-MK2 for hMPV, and Vero-E6 can be maintained for a longer period compared to LLC-MK2, which is more important for hMPV replication. We must point out that three aspects were 'a priori' for improved isolation of hMPV. First, the medium used to transport specimens, MEM without FBS, is superior to Hanks' or PBS. Second, specimens should be inoculated onto cells as soon as possible. Finally, our results indicate that the concentration of trypsin (0.13%) was better suited for hMPV isolation than 0.025%, which could be destructive to the cells during prolonged incubation.",
