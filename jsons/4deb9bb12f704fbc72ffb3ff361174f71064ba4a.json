Nearly 100 years ago, Marian von Smoluchowski introduced a mathematical model to describe coagulation phenomena in terms of diffusion-controlled reaction processes [1] . Despite its apparent simplicity, the kinetics of this model was found to yield a wealth of intriguing phenomena, whose analyses have widely enriched our understanding of pattern formation in chemical compounds, biological systems [2, 3] , and elsewhere.",

These phenomena result in a drastic slowing down in the rate of the reactions, forcing the system in a long-lived nonequilibrium state with a sublinear decay in the density of the surviving particles. Since this type of process grasps the essential kinetics featured by the spreading of pathogenantipathogen agents [10, 11] , or underlying the pattern formation of diverse chemical reaction [12] [13] [14] , the appearance of subdiffusive dynamics may become inefficient for practical applications, which typically aim in fast mixing regimes. With this goal, it was later proved that the adoption of L\u00e9vy processes indeed washes out segregation phenomena, leading to superdiffusive dynamics [15] .",

To track the evolution of each population, let us denote by \u03c1 1 and \u03c1 2 the concentration of A particles in networks 1 and 2, respectively; similarly, let \u03bc 1 and \u03bc 2 be the concentration of B particles in networks 1 and 2, respectively.

In Fig. 2(d) , it is depicted again the inverse particle density as a function of time for ER networks, only this time with a fixed fraction q = 0.008 and increasing values of the mean degree. For these substrates, we find that the same repulsion mechanism is obtained by both increasing k or decreasing q, as one might expect since a particle hopping to a node which is cross coupled to the other layer will diffuse to it with probability q/ k . Finally we tested the sensitivity of this dynamical scenario with respect to different choices of the initial concentrations \u03c1 0 . As shown in Figs. 2(e) and 2(f), increasing values of \u03c1 0 slightly affect the dynamical behavior of the system for both ER and SF interconnected networks, mainly influencing the transients in which the system indulges before entering the first diffusive regime. In particular, higher values of the densities make the particles in the two systems experience the repulsive effects earlier.",

            "text": "At this point, it is worth noting that the phenomenology described so far partially agrees with the results presented earlier in Ref. [30] by Garas, where the same system was investigated from the more general perspective of different strategies of cross-system interactions. However, by contrast with the conclusions drown in Ref. [30] , here we have shown that in the limit of low enough fractions of interconnected nodes, an initial separation of reactants generally leads to a spontaneous mechanism of repulsion among the reactants which, to the best of our knowledge, has been so far overlooked. Next, we investigate the effects that different values of the effective transmission probability q/ k have on the mixing properties of the system, so as to verify the accuracy of the approximations adopted to derive the relation (1) for t x . To evaluate this quantity, we have plotted the logarithmic derivative of the y axis in Fig. 2 , and searched for the maxima of the corresponding curves (see Fig. 3 ). The time at which a maximum is reached defines the mixing time t x , sharply marking the dynamical crossover between the two regimes. As shown in Fig. 4(a) , we find that the time t x for the A + B \u2192 0 process on ER (and equivalently, although not shown, RR) networks depends on q/ k as predicted by Eq. (1). To further support this behavior, in the inset of Fig. 4(a) we have validated the logarithmic dependency of q k t x due to the repulsion mechanism by comparing the pattern observed with the constant behavior that one would have found in the case of a purely diffusive process. By performing the same analysis on heterogeneous (SF and SR) networks, we find that the mixing time t x surprisingly follows the behavior predicted by the mean-field theory for homogeneous structures [ Fig. 4(b) ], although with slightly less accuracy. We trace the origin of this result to the fact that, in our model, low-degree nodes are indeed the most important ones for reactions to occur between the two populations, as they most likely carry the cross connections. In fact, as percolation results would suggest [47] , the probability of picking a hub at random is very low in SF or SR networks, making the chance of having hub-to-hub interconnections even harder. In this respect, we expect that degree-based couplings among networks will likely tune the effects of the repulsion mechanism, leading to a faster mixing of the reactants for, e.g., hub-to-hub couplings. To complete the analysis of the model for this Rapid Communication, we have tested the response to the system to finite-size effects, by adopting networks with equal topologies, but different number of nodes. In particular, for ER networks the three dynamical regimes encountered in Fig. 2 (b) remain unaltered in their main stages [ Fig. 5(a) ], and only exhibit an extinction point at earlier times for networks of decreasing sizes. Finally in Fig. 5(b) we have repeated the test for SR networks, where we have found that the pattern observed in Fig. 2(c) is again mainly unchanged, except that the convergence of the mixing time t x to its thermodynamic value is monotonic in N , enlightening the possible occurrence of finite-size effects in the case of power-law networks of small size whose study will be performed elsewhere.",

            "text": "Summary and conclusions. In this work we have studied, both numerically and analytically, the dynamics of an A + B \u2192 0 process on a pair of randomly coupled networks, where reactants are initially separated. For small enough values of the fraction q of interconnected nodes between the layers, we have found that the inverse particle density scales linearly at short times and then crosses over to a second linear regime at time t x . As the crossover determines the time at which the two populations start to extensively mix, we have analyzed the dependence of the mixing time t x on the effective diffusion rateq = q/ k , unveiling a repulsive mechanism whose spontaneous emergence delays the mixing of the reactants. We gave numerical evidence that, on randomly coupled synthetic networks, this effect does not show a sensitive dependence on the heterogeneity of the underlying topology, but it is in fact dominated by nodes with low connectivity. Whether or not the same behavior will appear on networks with targeted (e.g., hubto-hub, or non-hub-to-hub) interconnections [48] or on more realistic structures having, e.g., a spatial embedding or degreedegree correlations, remains an intriguing question calling for further investigations. Moreover, since the diffusion-controlled annihilation process adopted in this work can be considered as an archetypal model for reaction kinetics [49] , we believe that these results will inspire the investigation of the effects that the initial distribution of reactants, together with the mesoscopic architecture of the interconnected network, will have on the pattern formation in more elaborated and realistic spreading models [10, 50] , enlarging in this way our understanding of the interplay between structure and dynamics.",
