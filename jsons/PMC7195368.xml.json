Often, the risk of flare of the original disease may outweigh the chance of contracting COVID-19, necessitating the continuation of such drugs.14, 15, 16\n\u2022Patient with cirrhosis (even Child A) and those with prior liver transplantation should be discouraged from visiting a clinic or hospital, unless absolutely essential.\u2022Patients with decompensated cirrhosis should be considered for inpatient treatment only if there is a pressing indication for admission e.g. acute GI bleed, hepatic encephalopathy, tense ascites causing respiratory distress, liver cancer requiring locoregional therapy, or liver transplantation.\u2022Endoscopic variceal ligation as primary prophylaxis should be postponed till 4\u20136 weeks later, or till threat of COVID-19 infection has passed and beta-blockers should be preferred till then.\u2022Routine liver biopsies should be postponed for at least 4\u20136 weeks unless it is being carried out for confirming malignancy or an illness such as autoimmune hepatitis or acute cellular rejection.\u2022Postliver transplant patients should continue their standard immunosuppression till further data becomes available, (For more on COVD-19 and liver transplantation in India, please see Liver Transplantation Society of India guidance).17\n\u2022Liver transplantation recipients with COVID-19 infection should be monitored for drug-drug interactions, if they are prescribed lopinavir/ritonavir antiviral therapy because ritonavir is a potent CYP 3A4 inhibitor and can increase the levels of calcineurin inhibitors. (American Society of Transplantation Guidance).18\n\u2022Each hospital or clinic should adopt measures, as locally suitable and acceptable, and as per the regional or state policies and the local risk of occurrence of COVID-19 outbreak.\n",
