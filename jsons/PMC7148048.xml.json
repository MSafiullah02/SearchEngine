However, one limitation of typical recommender systems is the so-called popularity bias, which leads to the underrepresentation of less popular (i.e., long-tail) items in the recommendation lists [1, 4, 5]. The recent work of Abdollahpouri et al. [2] has investigated this popularity bias from the user perspective in the movie domain. The authors have shown that state-of-the-art recommendation algorithms tend to underserve users, who like unpopular items.",

Precisely, we extract 3,000 users that reflect the three user groups investigated in [2]. To this end, we use the mainstreaminess score, which is available for the users in the LFM-1b dataset and which is defined as the overlap between a user\u2019s listening history and the aggregated listening history of all Last.fm users in the dataset [3].

Furthermore, in Fig. 1b, we plot the ratio of popular artists in the profiles of our 3,000 Last.fm users. As in [2], we define an artist as popular if the artist falls within the top 20% of artists with the highest number of listeners. We see that around 1,000 of our 3,000 users (i.e., around 1/3) have at least 20% of unpopular artists in their user profiles.

We use the same evaluation protocol (i.e., 80/20 train/test split) and types of algorithms as in [2], which includes (i) baseline approaches, (ii) KNN-based approaches, and (iii) Matrix Factorization-based approaches. Specifically, we evaluate three baselines, i.e., Random, MostPopular, and UserItemAvg, which predicts the average listening count in the dataset by also accounting for deviations of u and a (e.g., if u tends to have in general more listening events than the average Last.fm user) [6]. We also evaluate the two KNN-based approaches [13] UserKNN and UserKNNAvg, which is a hybrid combination of UserKNN and UserItemAvg. Finally, we include NMF (Non-Negative Matrix Factorization) into our study [9]. To reduce the computational effort of our study, in our evaluation, we exclude ItemKNN [12] as well as SVD++ [11] in contrast to [2]. In Fig. 3, we plot the correlation of artist popularity and how often the six algorithms recommend these artists. For all algorithms except for Random, we find a positive correlation, which means that popular items are recommended more often than unpopular items. As expected, this effect is most evident for the MostPopular algorithm and not present at all for the Random algorithm. It also seems that this popularity bias is not as strong in the case of NMF, which we will investigate further in the next section of this paper.\n",
