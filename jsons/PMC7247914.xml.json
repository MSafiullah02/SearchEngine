Overcrowded hospitals with inadequate infrastructure predispose to cross-infection in all, including high risk groups. This may have a potential risk of increasing the infection in the community.",

We should use this opportunity to develop a system of giving appointments in secondary and tertiary care hospitals. Majority of people in our country have mobiles and can be encouraged to seek appointments at secondary and tertiary care hospitals. Staggered appointments may reduce crowding at a time in OPDs; this can be facilitated by information technology platforms. This will also reduce inconvenience to the patients. Before calling patients to the hospitals, a tele-consultation could be used as a filter. Only those who need physical examination may be called to the Outpatient department (OPD). Patients who need consultation along with some investigations, may be asked to get these investigations before coming to the hospital. This may reduce number of visits to the hospital.",

Over a period of time, HCPs will develop confidence and acceptance of COVID-19 as another infectious disease which can be faced using proper precautions and appropriate safety gears. Initially, hospital administration has to work hard to make the appropriate PPEs available to resume the non-COVID healthcare services also. Use of N95 masks along with face shields may become a norm with all patient contacts. Providing optimal PPE to HCPs will also help prevent shortage of the staff in this critical period, by avoiding unprotected exposures to COVID patients and subsequent quarantine.",

Conventionally, practical clinical examinations are conducted by formal clinical case work-ups and then by assessing student\u2019s ability to take proper history, skill of physical examination and then the analytical skill by discussing various clinical possibilities. There will be challenges in conducting clinical case examinations, and also getting examiners from outside of the city because of travel restrictions.
