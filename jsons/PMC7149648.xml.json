            "text": "The plus-strand RNA [(+)RNA] viruses comprise a very large group of viruses belonging to many families. Among these are viruses that cause epidemic disease in humans, including encephalitis, hepatitis, polyarthritis, yellow fever, dengue fever, poliomyelitis, and the common cold. The number of cases of human disease caused by these viruses each year is enormous. As examples, dengue viruses infect an estimated 50 to 100 million people each year; most humans suffer at least one rhinovirus-induced cold each year, with the cases therefore numbering in the billions; and most humans during their lifetime will suffer several episodes of gastroenteritis caused by astroviruses or caliciviruses. In terms of frequency and severity of illness, the (+)RNA viruses contain many serious human pathogens, and we will begin our description of viruses with this group.",

These seven families also contain numerous viruses that infect other vertebrates, of which many are important pathogens of domestic animals. Large numbers of (+)RNA viruses that infect plants are also known; in fact, most plant viruses contain (+)RNA genomes. The plant viruses, however, belong to different families and are currently classified by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) into nine families plus many unassigned genera. Because of their importance as disease agents of domestic crops, much is known about these viruses. Other families of (+)RNA viruses include two families of bacterial viruses, one of fungal viruses, and four families of insect viruses (the nodaviruses, in particular, have been intensively studied). Thus, the (+)RNA viruses have evolved into many distinctly different families and must have arisen long ago. In this chapter, the seven families of viruses that include human viruses as members are considered, followed by a brief discussion of the relationships of these viruses to the plant viruses and what this means in terms of virus evolution.",

The picornaviral genome is a single RNA molecule of about 7.5kb. It contains one open reading frame (ORF) and is translated into one long polyprotein. This polyprotein is\ncleaved by one or more virus-encoded proteinases to form more than 25 different polypeptides, including processing intermediates (not all of which are shown in the figure) as well as final cleavage products. The ORF in the genome contains three regions, called P1 (the 5\u2032 region), P2 (the middle region), and P3 (the 3\u2032 region). Region 1 encodes the structural proteins and regions 2 and 3 encode proteins required for RNA replication. The genome organization of all picornaviruses is similar, but each genus differs in important details. For example, the aphthoviruses and the cardioviruses have a poly(C) tract near the 5\u2032 end of the RNA that is important for virus replication. These two genera also have a leader polypeptide that precedes the structural protein region. The aphthovirus leader peptide is a papain-like protease that cleaves itself from the polyprotein and has a role in the shutoff of cellular protein synthesis. The function of the cardiovirus leader is not known. Hepatitis A virus, Aichi virus, and echovirus 22, representatives of three other genera, also have leaders.",

            "text": "The picornaviral genome has a small protein, VPg, covalently bound to the 5\u2032 end, which is the primer for initiation of RNA synthesis. VPg is normally removed from RNA that serves as mRNA by a cellular enzyme, but its removal is not required for its translation. The 3\u2032 end of the RNA is poly-adenylated. As described in Chapter 1, the 5\u2032 nontranslated region of a picornaviral RNA possesses an IRES (internal ribosome entry site) and the RNA is translated by a cap-independent mechanism. The translation of picornaviral RNA is greatly favored in the infected cell because picornaviruses interfere with host cell macromolecular synthesis and, in particular, interfere with host protein synthesis. Infection with entero-, rhino-, and aphthoviruses leads to proteolytic cleavage of a cellular protein called eIF4G that is a component of the cap-binding complex. Cleavage of this protein by 2Apro of entero- and rhinoviruses or by the leader protease of aphthoviruses results in inhibition of the translation of RNAs that require the cap-binding protein complex, that is, capped host cell mRNAs. The cardioviruses, which are also cap independent, interfere with translation of host mRNAs in a different way, by interfering with phosphorylation of cap-binding protein. Poliovirus also interferes with host protein synthesis by cleavage of poly(A)-binding protein by the viral 3Cpro, but the mechanism by which this interference operates on cellular protein synthesis and not viral protein synthesis, since poliovirus RNA is also polyadenylated, is not yet clear. In addition, 3Cpro of apthoviruses cleaves initiation factors eIF4A and eIF4GI, and it is thought that these cleavages lead to a decrease in the level of viral protein synthesis later in infection, which facilitates packaging of the viral RNA.",

The crystal structures of 3Cpro of poliovirus and of a rhinovirus have been solved to atomic resolution, and their core structure resembles that of chymotrypsin (Fig. 1.19A). The catalytic center has the same geometry as that of chymotrypsin, but in 3Cpro the catalytic serine has been replaced by cysteine. Moreover, in many, but not all, picornaviruses the aspartic acid in the catalytic triad has been replaced by glutamic acid. Thus, 3Cpro is related to cellular serine proteases and may have originated by the capture of a cellular serine protease during the evolution of the viruses.",

In poliovirus, 2Apro, like 3Cpro, is a serine protease in which the active site serine has been replaced by cysteine. 2Apro catalyzes one essential cleavage in the polyprotein of poliovirus, that between P1 and P2. This cleavage occurs in cis. The proteolytic activity of 2Apro is also required for other functions during poliovirus replication, the nature of which have not been established. An interesting experiment is illustrated in Fig. 3.3\nbecause it illustrates the power of molecular genetics and the tricks that modern virologists can play with viruses. This experiment will serve as a prelude to the discussion of the uses of viruses as vectors in Chapter 11. A poliovirus was constructed in which a stop codon was placed after the structural protein domain (region 1), so that 2Apro was not needed to remove P1 from the polyprotein precursor. The stop codon was followed by an IRES and a new AUG start codon, so that P2A and the rest of the genome could be translated from the polycistronic RNA. This virus was viable. However, when the 2A proteinase was inactivated by changing the active site cysteine, the resulting virus was dead, showing that the proteolytic activity of P2A is required not only to separate regions 1 and 2 of the polyprotein but also for other function(s).",

Thus, these two proteases in closely related viruses have different origins, and the viruses have solved the problem of how to separate regions 1 and 2 in the polyprotein in different ways. Furthermore, this finding illustrates that recombination to introduce new functions into viral genomes has been important in the evolution of these viruses, a theme to which we will refer many times in this book. Still another solution to the problem of separating regions 1 and 2 has been adopted by the cardio- and aphthoviruses. Protein 2A is not a protease in these viruses. Indeed, 2A is only 18 residues long, and cleavage between P1 and P2 is catalyzed by 3Cpro. Another interesting feature of these viruses is that the cleavage at the 2A\u20132B junction occurs spontaneously during translation, catalyzed by the specific amino acid sequence at the scissile bond. This cotranslational cleavage occurs only during translation on eukaryotic ribosomes, and it has been proposed that no cleavage actually occurs, but that the 2A sequence prevents synthesis of the specific peptide bond at the 2A\u20132B junction.",

Many, but not all, RNA viruses encode helicases to unwind duplex RNA during replication, and it is assumed that 2CATPase performs such a function.

One function of 3CDpro is to bind the viral RNA in conjunction with 3AB, the precursor for VPg, or with a cellular protein, poly(C)-binding protein. Formation of a complex with the viral RNA is essential for its replication, and differential cleavage of the 3C\u20133D bond during the infection cycle may regulate replication. A strategy in which precursor proteins perform different functions than those performed by the final cleavage products, such as those illustrated by 2BCATPase and 3CDpro, allows the virus to optimize the coding capacity of its small genome, because a given sequence is used for more than one function.",

Much more (+)RNA than (\u2212)RNA is produced, since (+)RNA is needed for translation and encapsidation into progeny as well as for replication, whereas (\u2212)RNA is needed only as a template for making (+)RNA. It is probable that disproportionate amounts of (+) and (\u2212) strands are synthesized because the promoters in the viral RNA recognized by the viral replication machinery for (+) and (\u2212)RNA synthesis (which might also be called origins of replication) differ in their strength, but other mechanisms are known to be used in at least some RNA viruses.",

This natural infection served to immunize the infant, protecting it from poliomyelitis for life. However, when the chain of immunization was interrupted upon removal of the virus from the environment by the development of hygienic conditions, unprotected children grew up, giving rise to susceptible populations.

However, surveys conducted in the twentieth century of lameness in populations, most of which is probably due to paralytic polio, found similar extents of lameness whether the virus was endemic or epidemic.",

Of these cases, about 20,000 were paralytic and 2000\u20133000 people died (Fig. 3.4\n). Death was often the result of the paralysis of the muscles required for breathing, and iron lungs were introduced for mechanical ventilation of poliomyelitis patients until their muscles recovered sufficiently that they could breathe on their own. Wards containing dozens of patients in iron lungs became a common sight in the large epidemics of the 1950s (Fig. 3.5\n), and there were fears that larger wards containing still more iron lungs would be required as the epidemics became more virulent. Of the survivors of poliomyelitis, many were permanently paralyzed and confined to wheelchairs or required the use of crutches for walking. One of the best known poliomyelitis cases is that of Franklin D. Roosevelt, who contracted poliovirus in 1921 at the age of 39 and was in a wheelchair for the rest of his life, although he continued to lead an active political life.",

The Salk vaccine, which was the first to be developed, is an inactivated virus vaccine that is given as a series of injections. Introduction of this vaccine resulted in a rapid decrease in the number of poliovirus cases. However, because the vaccine induces circulating antibodies but little in the way of mucosal immunity (see Chapter 10), it prevents poliomyelitis, the disease, by preventing spread of the virus from the gastrointestinal (GI) tract to the CNS, but not infection of the GI tract by the virus. The virus thus remained in circulation. The Sabin vaccine, introduced shortly thereafter, is a live attenuated vaccine that is given orally. Attenuation was achieved by blind passage of the virus followed by testing of the resulting virus in monkeys. The changes resulting from passage are now known and are shown in Table 3.4\n; two changes are sufficient to make the virus avirulent in the case of types 2 and 3. The introduction of the Sabin vaccine led to a further rapid decline in paralytic poliomyelitis. This vaccine has the drawback that it induces a very small number of cases of paralytic disease, termed vaccine associated paralytic poliomyelitis (VAPP), that result from reversion of the attenuated virus to virulence. The incidence rate is about 1 per million persons inoculated, and there were about 10 such cases per year in the United States until use of this vaccine was discontinued in the year 2000 (Fig. 3.4). The efficacy of the Sabin vaccine is very high, however, because it induces mucosal immunity as well as other forms of immunity. It prevents subsequent infection by the wild-type virus, thus allowing eradication of the wild-type virus if coverage is sufficiently broad. In addition, it is much cheaper and simpler to manufacture and administer than the Salk vaccine (oral administration of relatively small doses of live virus versus injection of large amounts of inactivated virulent virus), making it suitable for widespread use in developing countries. Worldwide use of this vaccine has resulted in the eradication of wild-type poliovirus in the United States and throughout the Americas (the last case of indigenous poliovirus infection in the Americas occurred in Peru in 1991). Poliovirus is in the process of being eradicated in other parts of the world, although it is still endemic in areas of Africa and Asia. With the extirpation of polio in the United States, the use of Sabin vaccine was discontinued in this country and it has been replaced with the Salk vaccine, in order to eliminate VAPP.",

Reversion to virulence requires the back mutation of the attenuating mutations in the vaccine viruses or, conceivably, recombination between two attenuated poliovirus strains that eliminates the attenuating mutations.

The original Salk vaccine was incompletely inactivated because the science of virology was insufficiently developed to assay for minute amounts of residual live virus in solutions containing very high concentrations of virus. The result was that this vaccine caused a small number of cases of poliomyelitis, but in retrospect the risk\u2013reward ratio was favorable because of the significant decline in natural infections (Fig. 3.4). As soon as the problem was recognized, more stringent methods of inactivation were quickly developed that resulted in complete inactivation of the infectivity of the virus, solving this problem and serving as an example for development of other vaccines. The introduction of the Salk vaccine, although enormously successful in controlling polio, also suffered from early problems when it was found that early lots were contaminated with the monkey virus SV40 (described in Chapter 7). Infection of humans by this virus appears to be benign, although there is some evidence that, very rarely, brain tumors may be associated with infection. In any event, this episode brought to light the issue of adventitious contamination of cell cultures with viruses that infect the host supplying tissues for culture. A third problem that arose during development of polio vaccines was the infection of a number of laboratory workers in Germany with Marburg virus. These workers were employed in the isolation of cells from the kidneys of wild-caught monkeys that were to be used in propagating polioviruses, and some of the monkeys were infected with Marburg virus, at that time an unknown virus. Several people died in the ensuing epidemic (described in Chapter 4).",

Although falling short of this goal, significant progress has been made. The number of polio cases worldwide fell from an estimated 300,000+ cases in the mid 1980s to fewer than 3000 by 2000 and subsequently to still lower levels (Fig. 3.7\n). In 2000 the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said that 2971 cases were reported of which 719 were confirmed by laboratory analysis. In 2001, 537 cases were reported of which 473 were confirmed by laboratory analysis, and these cases occurred in just 10 countries. It appeared that eradication would be achieved soon. The eradication campaign hit a snag recently, however, when Muslim clerics in Nigeria claimed that the vaccine could cause AIDS or infertility. In 2003, officials in some parts of Nigeria suspended local vaccination programs, and an epidemic of poliomyelitis in Nigeria resulted that then spread to neighboring countries that had been free of polio (Fig. 3.8\n). By 2005 polio had spread to a total of 16 countries that had previously been polio free. Further setbacks in the polio vaccination initiative have resulted from civil unrest in Sudan and other countries that resulted in interference with vaccine campaigns and the reestablishment of poliovirus transmission. Health ministers from Africa are stepping up vaccination\nprograms to reestablish control of poliovirus transmission, but these situations illustrate problems that result from the continuing conflicts among societies.",

Many paralyzed poliomyelitis patients were ultimately able to resume almost normal activities. Through a process of axonal sprouting and reenervation of muscles by the motor neurons that survived the infection, many learned to walk and use their previously paralyzed limbs. In many, recovery was effectively complete. However, a syndrome called post-polio syndrome has emerged to plague a significant fraction, perhaps 40%, of the survivors of paralytic poliomyelitis. This syndrome appears 30\u201340 years after polio infection and is characterized by fatigue, pain, and weakness. The weakness may be severe enough to require the use of a wheelchair. The syndrome results from the degeneration of motor neurons, but the reasons for the degeneration are not clear. The favored hypothesis is that it is the result of overuse of the surviving motor neurons, which are forced to do the work of many. A second possibility is that the surviving neurons were damaged by the original poliovirus infection and fail prematurely. A third, albeit unlikely, possibility is that poliovirus persists in neurons and is somehow reactivated, even in the presence of anti-polio antibody. In model studies using Sindbis virus infection of mice, it has been found that the virus can persist in neurons in a latent state for at least 1\u20132 years. There is no evidence that poliovirus might similarly persist in humans for 40 years, however, and such persistence seems unlikely. Other possible explanations for the failure of motor neurons in post-polio syndrome have also been suggested. Fortunately, paralytic poliomyelitis and its sequelae may soon be a thing of the past.",

In fact, it has now been established that most enteroviruses do cause disease, and many of them cause significant episodes of serious disease (Table 3.5\n). Study of disease caused by these viruses has been complicated by the fact that there are so many entero-viruses, of which at least some have multiple strains that may differ in disease-causing potential, and by the fact that serious disease is an uncommon complication of infection by most enteroviruses (even for poliovirus most infections do not result in significant disease). This has made it difficult to ascribe any particular disease to infection by any particular virus. However, even though serious disease is an uncommon complication, enteroviral infections are very common, and the total number of cases of disease caused by these viruses is large. These illnesses include very infrequent paralytic disease essentially indistinguishable clinically from that caused by poliovirus; myocarditis and pericarditis (caused especially by the Coxsackie B viruses) that is usually subclinical but can be acute and result in significant cardiac compromise; aseptic meningitis; encephalitis; hepatitis; the common cold (perhaps a quarter of summer colds are due to enteroviruses); diarrheal disease; febrile illnesses; rash; hand-foot-and-mouth disease (a common childhood illness caused by several serotypes in human enterovirus A); and epidemic acute hemorrhagic conjunctivitis (an epidemic disease caused by enterovirus 70 that appeared recently and spread around the world).

Infection by HAV usually results in a self-limited illness in which the patient recovers with relatively few sequelae. The illness can be quite serious, even fatal, however, because 90% of the liver tissue can be destroyed by virus infection, and liver function is severely impaired until the liver recovers. The seriousness of disease is age dependent. Very young children suffer little disease but with advancing age infection by the virus becomes more serious.

By June more than 2000 infected animals had been detected. The epidemic was controlled by restricting the movement of sheep, cattle, and swine, and culling of herds in which FMDV was found. Almost 4 million animals were destroyed in this process. The damage to the British cattle industry was particularly distressful because this epidemic occurred only a few years after widespread culling of cattle to control an epidemic of a prion disease called \u201cmad cow disease\u201d(Chapter 9). Beginning in March, many rural areas often visited by tourists were closed to prevent the spread of the virus, and the U.S. Department of Agriculture was especially vigilant in examining travelers returning from affected countries. British authorities considered vaccinating cattle with commercial vaccines to control the epidemic, but vaccines have not been used by the British to date. Vaccination for FMDV is used in some parts of the world, but is controversial because it is then difficult to distinguish between vaccinated animals and infected animals. Thus, for example, the United States does not allow the importation of beef from areas where vaccination is practiced because it is not possible to rule out the presence of FMDV infection. Although FMDV was thought to have been eradicated by June 2001, and restrictions were about to be lifted, 16 new cases of FMDV were then found in Britain that delayed lifting of the restrictions in that country. The last new case was found on September 30, 2001, and Britain was declared free of FMDV on January 15, 2002.",

As described, there is no cultured cell line in which to propagate the viruses, nor even an animal model in which to grow it, and studies have relied on human volunteers for virus propagation. This has severely limited the amount of information (and material) that can be obtained. However, because of the power of modern gene cloning technology, the entire genome of Norwalk has been cloned and sequenced, starting from stools of experimentally infected human volunteers. These genome sequences can be aligned with the genomes of other caliciviruses (Fig. 3.11), and the mechanisms of the expression of the genome and the functions of the encoded proteins can be predicted from studies of the animal caliciviruses. Thus, for example, it is assumed that the Norwalk viruses possess a 5\u2032-terminal VPg as does San Miguel sea lion virus, but to date it has not been possible to prove this. However, the genomic sequence of Norwalk virus contains a sequence related to the VPg of other caliciviruses, providing evidence that Norwalk virus RNA does in fact carry a 5\u2032-terminal VPg. Clones of various regions of the viral RNA can be expressed in cultured cells to study the expression and function of various domains. For example, the capsid protein of Norwalk virus has been expressed in insect cells and these proteins spontaneously assemble into T=3 virus-like particles of 38-nm diameter whose structure has been determined to atomic resolution by X-ray diffraction techniques. Of interest is the recent discovery of a mouse norovirus. The virus causes only silent infections in immunocompetent mice but, importantly, it will replicate in cultured cells, and thus has the potential to serve as a surrogate virus to work out details of the molecular biology of replication of noroviruses. Another recent development is the finding that human noroviruses will replicate in a cell system in which the viral RNA is introduced by transcription from cDNA clones.",

Analysis of available data suggests that perhaps 50% of food-borne outbreaks in the United States are attributable to Norwalk virus, and these viruses are therefore responsible for the majority of outbreaks of nonbacterial gastroenteritis in the United States. Further, the Norwalk outbreaks are larger than those associated with bacteria, a median of 25 cases per outbreak versus 15 cases in bacterial outbreaks and 7 cases in outbreaks of unknown etiology. More than half of the Norwalk outbreaks were associated with eating salads, sandwiches, or fresh produce, and in 40% of Norwalk outbreaks restaurants or caterers were associated.

Release of the genomic RNA, which is capped and polyadenylated, is followed by its translation into a nonstructural polyprotein that is cleaved into four polypeptides by a viral protease (Fig. 3.16). Activities present in these proteins include a capping activity in the N-terminal protein (nsP1); helicase, papain-like protease, and RNA triphosphatase activities in nsP2; and RNA polymerase in nsP4. A viral encoded capping activity is required to cap the viral mRNAs (the genomic RNA and a subgenomic RNA) because replication occurs in the cytoplasm and the virus does not have access to cellular capping enzymes. The RNA triphosphatase in nsP2 is required to remove the terminal phosphate in the 5\u2032 triphosphate on the RNA in order to prepare the RNA for capping by the viral enzyme, the RNA helicase is needed to unwind the RNAs during replication, and the protease is required to process the precursor polyprotein.

During or shortly after translation, the full-length polyprotein precursor (called P1234) cleaves itself in cis to produce P123 and nsP4. These form an RNA synthetase, probably together with cellular proteins, that can make complementary (\u2212)RNA from the genomic RNA template, but which cannot make (+)RNA efficiently. Subsequent cleavage of P123 in trans, between nsP1 and nsP2, gives rise to a synthetase that can make both (+)RNA and (\u2212)RNA. A second cleavage between nsP2 and nsP3 gives rise to a synthetase that can make only (+)RNA. Thus, (\u2212)RNA templates are made early, but as infection proceeds and the concentration of protease builds up, trans cleavage occurs and (\u2212)RNA synthesis is shut down (Fig. 3.18\n). After this time, plus-strand RNA synthesis continues from the preformed minus-strand templates but no further increase in the rate of RNA synthesis takes place. This control mechanism may have evolved not only to make the infection process more efficient, since genomic RNA for progeny virions and sub-genomic RNAs for translation of structural proteins required for assembly of progeny virions are needed in much larger quantities than minus-strand templates, but also to control the virulence of the virus. In the case of alphaviruses, it is particularly important to control the virulence of the virus in the mosquito vector. As discussed in more detail later, it is important that the infection process in the mosquito be tightly controlled, and shutting down minus-strand RNA synthesis not only prevents further exponential increase in virus replication but also allows downregulation of virus replication as minus-strand templates decay. It also has the effect that the infected cell becomes resistant to superinfection by the same or a related virus because no (\u2212)RNA templates can be made, which could be especially important in the mosquito vector. The resistance to superinfection by the same or related viruses is called superinfection exclusion or homologous interference.",

Termination at this codon produces P123, which can act in trans as a protease but cannot act as a synthetase because it lacks the nsP4 RNA polymerase. In addition to a more rapid buildup of protease that accelerates the rate of conversion to (+)RNA synthesis, this additional P123 and its cleavage products may serve to accelerate the rate of RNA synthesis. There is evidence from genetic studies that domains in nsP1 and nsP2, among others, are required for the recognition of viral promoters and the initiation of RNA synthesis, and additional helicase activity could also speed up the rate of RNA synthesis.",

The 4.1-kb subgenomic RNA is synthesized by the viral replicase from the (\u2212)RNA template using an internal promoter of 24 nucleotides. The activity of this core 24-nucleotide promoter is increased by enhancer sequences present in the 100 nucleotides upstream of the core promoter. The structural proteins are translated as a polyprotein and cleaved by a combination of viral and cellular enzymes. The capsid protein is itself a serine autoprotease that cleaves itself from the N terminus of the nascent polyprotein. It has a fold that is similar to that of chymotrypsin (Fig. 2.14B), suggesting that it was derived from a cellular serine protease during evolution of the virus. After release of the capsid protein, N-terminal signal sequences and internal signal sequences in the glycoprotein polyprotein precursor lead to its insertion into the endoplasmic reticulum (Figure 3.19\n). This precursor is cleaved by signalase, a cellular enzyme that resides in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum, to produce glycoprotein PE2 (a precursor to glycoprotein E2), 6K (a small hydrophobic peptide located between E2 and E1), and glycoprotein E1. PE2 and E1 quickly form a heterodimer. At some time, the C terminus of PE2/E2 is withdrawn from the lipid bilayer into the cytoplasm, where it can interact with the capsid during virus assembly. During transport of the heterodimer to the cell plasma membrane, PE2 is cleaved by another cellular enzyme, furin or a furin-like enzyme, to form E2 and E3. E3 is a small glycoprotein that in most alphaviruses is lost into the culture fluid.",

Four alphavirus promoters, or components of promoters, are illustrated in Figure 3.20\n. The best understood of these promoters is that for the production of the subgenomic mRNA for the structural proteins. The basal promoter consists of 24 nucleotides, of which 19 are upstream of the transcription start site and 5 are copied into the subgenomic RNA.

In other cases, the interactions of the complementary sequences near the ends of the RNA are stabilized by the binding of viral or cellular proteins. And in still other cases, cyclization is effected by cellular proteins. In one scenario, a cellular protein such as the poly(A)-binding protein binds to the 3\u2032 poly(A) tract and another cellular protein, such as one that binds to translation initiation signals, binds near the 5\u2032 end of the molecule.

Cleavage is necessary to prime the E2-E1 heterodimer for disassembly upon entry into a susceptible cell, which is required for formation of E1 homotrimers that are responsible for fusion. During transport or virus assembly, three E2-E1 heterodimers trimerize to form the spikes found in the virion.

More importantly, however, are studies showing that arbovirus infection results in decreased survival and reproductive capacity. Thus, the persistence of an arbovirus requires a delicate balance. The virus must replicate to sufficiently high titer in the vertebrate to cause sufficient viremia to infect a mosquito, which usually results in symptomatic disease.

            "text": "In humid tropical or subtropical areas in which mosquitoes are active throughout the year, an arbovirus can be maintained by continuous transmission between invertebrate and vertebrate hosts. Virus activity may vary during the year, for example it may be much greater during a rainy season when the number of mosquito vectors is higher, but the virus is active throughout the year and human infection can occur at any time. However, in temperate zones in which adult mosquitoes die off in the winter, or in very dry areas in which mosquitoes are only active after sporadic rains, the virus must have a mechanism by which it overwinters. Mosquitoes survive winters (or extended droughts) by suspending development of the young at some stage. In some mosquitoes, eggs are laid but do not develop until conditions are favorable. In others, developing young diapause, suspending development at some stage of embryonic development or larval development, until conditions are favorable, such as the return of spring. Thus, one mechanism for overwintering by some arboviruses is transovarial transmission, in which the virus infects oocytes in the infected female at an early stage of development; the replication cycle of the virus is suspended during diapause and the animal develops normally. When the newly hatched mosquito begins to fly, it is already infected. One way to search for transovarial transmission in the field is to look for virus in male mosquitoes. Since these do not feed on blood, the only way for them to become infected is by transovarial transmission. Some alphaviruses are known to use this mechanism whereas other alphaviruses do not. A second mechanism used by some arboviruses is persistent infection of a vertebrate host so that infected vertebrates are present when the mosquitoes emerge once again. Some alphaviruses are known to persist in humans or other vertebrates for extended periods, but such persistence is rare and it is not known whether this could be a means of overwintering. In some arboviruses, however, such as the coltiviruses (see Chapter 5), persis-tence is known to be essential to the maintenance of the virus in nature and the virus has evolved specific mechanisms to persist. A third mechanism is the reintroduction of the virus into an area from regions where it persists year-round, for example, by the return of migratory birds or by infected mosquitoes being blown over large distances by storms.

In spring when mosquitoes first arise, disease is also absent or rare. It is only with time that the intensity of virus transmission builds up to the point that humans become infected with some frequency. There have also been suggestions that the arboviruses that first appear may not be as virulent as viruses that appear later in the season, perhaps because they are adapted to the mosquito vector and must readapt to the vertebrate host. In any event, arboviral epidemics characteristically occur in mid to late summer and early fall in temperate regions. In other regions, epidemics may be associated with heavy rainfall that results in an increase in the mosquito population.",

From there it jumped to other islands having air contact with Fiji.

Sequencing studies have suggested that a mutation in glycoprotein E2 may have allowed this cycle to become established. The mosquito vector during this epidemic was Aedes polynesiensis. This epidemic was explosive with most of the people on the affected islands becoming infected by the virus and about 10% of them becoming ill. The epidemic eventually burned itself out because all the humans had become immune and the virus failed to establish an endemic cycle in other animals in the region. After 20 years without RRV in Fiji, three recent cases of RRV disease have been reported in travelers to Fiji. It is thought that RRV has been reintroduced into the island on these occasions and susceptible tourists infected, but that the native population is now largely immune to the virus and no new epidemic has occurred.",

The RNA is capped but lacks 3\u2032 poly(A). There is a stem-loop structure at the 3\u2032 end which serves the same function as poly(A) in other messengers. This structure increases the efficiency of translation of the RNA by about 10-fold and will substitute for poly(A) in model systems. Viral proteins are not required for this effect and therefore cellular proteins must interact with this structure in order to increase the efficiency of translation. It is known that during translation of mRNAs that are capped and polyadenylated, there is an initiation complex formed that contains both cap-binding protein and poly(A)-binding protein. Thus, the complex interacts with both ends of the mRNA to initiate translation. It is assumed that a cellular protein binds the 3\u2032 stem-loop of flaviviruses and interacts with the initiation complex so as to perform the same function as the poly(A)-binding protein. Formation of this complex in the case of flavivirus RNAs could be enhanced by cyclization of the viral RNA described later, although the primary function of cyclization appears to be in the replication of the viral RNA.",

The assembly of flaviviruses has clear parallels with that of alphaviruses, as described in Chapter 2. E of flaviviruses and E1 of alphaviruses are homologous proteins, having the same structure and function (see Fig. 2.17). A heterodimer is first formed, between prM and E in flaviviruses and PE2 and E1 in alphaviruses. Immature virus particles can be isolated that have uncleaved PE2 or prM whose infectivity is very low. The trimeric spikes\nin these immature particles are quite similar in structure (see Fig. 2.15). Flaviviruses have a triangulation number of 3 and therefore 60 trimeric spikes each consisting of 3 heterodimers of prM and E. Alphaviruses have a triangulation number of 4 and therefore there are 80 trimeric spikes each consisting of 3 heterodimers of PE2 and E1. After cleavage of prM or of PE2, however, the structures are quite different. Alphaviruses retain 80 trimeric spikes with E2-E1 heterodimers. In flaviviruses, however, the M-E heterodimer dissociates and there is a dramatic rearrangement whereby 90 E-E homodimers are formed and the particle shrinks from 60nm in diameter to 50nm. Upon infection of a cell and exposure of the mature flavivirion to acidic pH there is another dramatic rearrangement and 60 E-E-E homotrimers are formed that tilt up so that the fusion peptide at the extremity of domain 2 is inserted into the cellular target membrane and fusion results. It seems clear that the structures of alphaviruses and flaviviruses had a common origin, and that recombination during their evolution resulted in this common structure becoming associated with different suites of RNA replication enzymes. It is possible that this structure, which allows enveloped viruses to have a regular icosahedral structure, evolved only once.

Black Africans, who were brought as slaves to the New World to replace Native American slaves who had died in large numbers from European diseases, in general suffer less severe disease following yellow fever infection, presumably having been selected for partial resistence by millennia of coexistence with the virus. Their relative resistance to yellow fever resulted in the importation of even more black slaves into yellow fever zones.

Quarantine procedures to prevent the introduction of yellow fever were often thwarted by captains who concealed the presence of the disease to avoid a lengthy quarantine, even going to the extreme of secretly burying crew members who died while in quarantine. On June 6, 1855, the steamer Ben Franklin arrived from St. Thomas and anchored at the quarantine ground. There had been three cases of yellow fever on the ship during the voyage, of whom two died and were buried, one on land and one at sea. There was yet another case on board during quarantine who died and was buried ashore. Yet when the health officer, Dr. Gordon, visited the ship, he was told by the captain that there was no disease on the ship. The captain did admit that there had been two deaths during the voyage but ascribed them to other causes. After 13 days in quarantine and continued inspection by Dr. Gordon, who finding nothing amiss believed the captain's report that there was no disease aboard, the ship was allowed to dock. Yellow fever soon appeared in Norfolk. A number of early cases among the citizens of the town were ascribed to the ship passing within a half mile of their homes, and it is possible that infected mosquitoes were blown ashore, although it is also possible that workmen visiting the ship while laid up for repairs may have brought the disease into the town. The disease then spread in all directions at a uniform rate of about 40 yards per day until it encompassed the whole city. The epidemic peaked at the end of August and died out after a frost in October. During the epidemic, an estimated 10,000 cases of yellow fever occurred in a population of 16,000, and 2000 died of the disease. The report established two other facts about the disease: Persons who had had yellow fever previously were immune, and the epidemic was not spread by person-to-person contact.",

The Department of the Army sent an expedition, under the command of Walter Reed, to Cuba, recently acquired by the United States from Spain, to study the disease. The commission undertook to test the thesis that the virus was transmitted by mosquitoes, using themselves as human volunteers. Mosquitoes were allowed to feed on yellow fever patients and then on members of the commission. At first there was a lack of understanding about the fact that mosquitoes are infected only by feeding on patients early in their disease, before an effective immune response arises, and about the necessity for an extrinsic incubation period in the mosquito, during which the virus establishes an infection in the salivary glands, before it can transmit the virus. Ultimately, however, the investigation team did succeed in infecting themselves by mosquito transmission and one member of the commission, Dr. Jesse Lazear, died of it. Fortunately, his was the only death recorded in these experiments. It is of note that in the days before the introduction of a vaccine, most researchers who studied yellow fever in the field or in the laboratory ultimately contracted the disease and many of them died.",

It was (and still is) common for drinking water to be stored around houses throughout Latin America in large pots that served as excellent breeding places for Ae. aegypti. The campaign, which included smashing such water containers, succeeded in breaking the mosquito transmission cycle and yellow fever as an epidemic agent disappeared from Havana within months. This approach was later exported to other areas with great success, including Panama. These successes led to the belief that yellow fever could be eradicated, but the discovery of the endemic cycle of yellow fever dispelled this idea. Forest workers who cut down trees and brought the mosquitoes down from the upper canopy, where they transmit the disease to monkeys, were particularly at risk. Once infected, a person is able to bring the disease back to town where it can get into the Ae. aegypti population and start an urban epidemic.",

One such strain was derived from an infected human named Asibi. Theiler and Smith passed the Asibi strain of yellow fever in chicken cells, and after approximately 100 passages, it was found that the resulting virus was no longer virulent for rhesus monkeys. After additional passages, this virus, called 17D, was ultimately used as a live virus vaccine in humans and has proved to be one of the best and most efficacious vaccines ever developed. The vaccine virus has been given to about 350 million people. It causes very few side reactions, although three recent vacinees developed full-blown yellow fever and died. The vaccine is essentially 100% effective in providing long-lasting protection against yellow fever. This vaccine is routinely given to travelers to regions where yellow fever is endemic and is used to control the spread of epidemic yellow fever in Latin America and, with less success, in Africa. The success of this vaccine has served as a model for the development of other live virus vaccines, namely, passing the virus in cultured cells from a nonnative host. Recent sequencing studies have found that the 17D vaccine differs from the parental Asibi strain at 48 nucleotides that result in 22 amino acid substitutions. The substitutions responsible for the attenuation of the virus are not known, but it is suggestive that 8 of the amino acid substitutions are found in the E protein, where they might alter host range.",

Between 1986 and 1991, annual outbreaks of yellow fever occurred in Nigeria that probably resulted in hundreds of thousands of cases. An intense campaign beginning in 1992 to vaccinate the population of Nigeria has resulted in the virtual disappearance of yellow fever in Nigeria, but epidemics continue to occur in other African countries. Epidemics of yellow fever also continue to occur in Peru, Bolivia, Brazil, Ecuador, Columbia, and Venezuela, perhaps in part due to the reemergence of Ae. aegypti in South America as described in more detail later. There was one imported case of yellow fever in the United States in 1996, in which an American who visited the jungles of Brazil along the Amazon River without being immunized returned to the United States with yellow fever and died of the disease. Because of the endemic cycle in which monkeys are the reservoir, it is probably impossible to eradicate the virus as has been done with smallpox and as is planned for poliovirus and measles virus.",

The introductions of Asian viruses included more virulent strains of dengue that together with the circulation of multiple serotypes led to epidemics of DHF. Dengue virus is now a major health problem in Latin America. Dengue has also become more active in the Pacific region.

This suggests that the potential for immune enhancement exists for other flaviviruses but does not occur in humans other than the dengue viruses because the immune reaction to flaviviruses is normally strong and not cross-reactive and subneutralizing concentrations of antiviral antibodies do not exist. It does raise a warning flag for vaccines, however, and vaccines that increase the seriousness of disease caused by subsequent infection have occurred in the case of measles virus and respiratory syncytial virus (see Chapters 4 and 10).",

This chronic infection is well tolerated by some and in a minority of cases spontaneous remission may occur in the absence of medical intervention. However, in many persons chronic hepatitis results. Most seriously, in about 20% of chronic infections liver cirrhosis develops after a long lag, usually more than 20 years, and hepato-cellular carcinoma develops in up to 2.5%.

This treatment is not only expensive but relatively toxic and many patients tolerate it poorly. This consideration, as well as the fact that half the patients show no effect or only transient relief from this treatment, has led to intense efforts to develop new treatments. These include efforts to develop vaccines as well as efforts to develop antiviral agents that will interrupt virus replication or prevent the virus from interfering with the host defenses against the virus. Antivirals currently in clinical trials include nucleoside analogues that when incorporated into viral RNA result in chain termination, two compounds that bind to the viral RNA polymerase NS5B and inhibit its activity, two inhibitors of the viral NS3\u20134A protease, and three compounds that modulate the immune system.

Here we note that the first line of defense against viral infection is the production of type 1 interferons (IFN) \u03b1 and \u03b2, components of the innate immune system. The NS3\u20134A protease of HCV interferes with the induction of IFN by cleaving two intermediates, called MAV5 and TRIF, in two different but overlapping activation pathways. MAV5 is required in the pathway that starts from an intra-cellular sensor of double-strand RNA called RIG-1, whereas TRIF is required in the pathway that starts from a membrane bound sensor of double-strand RNA called Toll-like receptor 3 (see Chapter 10). The result is that both pathways are disabled.",

The mechanisms by which this occurs are incompletely understood. What is known is that successful clearance of HCV infection in humans is associated with a strong T-cell response, both CD8+ and CD4+, and that immunologic memory results such that although reinfection by HCV can occur, it does not lead to chronic infection. In humans in which the infection becomes chronic, CD8+ cytotoxic T cells are relatively few and these T cells recognize fewer epitopes.

Animals infected as adults by the virus may exhibit no disease or may have symptoms that include diarrhea, but they recover uneventfully. However, when a pregnant cow is infected by the virus, infection of the fetus may cause the fetus to become immunologically tolerant to the virus, resulting in a chronic infection that lasts for the life of the animal. Such in utero infection may lead to developmental abnormalities or runting in the calf, and may render the calf sensitive to infection by other microorganisms, all of which have serious economic effects. A more interesting effect of the chronic infection, however, is the development in some animals of fatal mucosal disease at the age of 1\u20132 years; once symptoms appear, the animal dies within weeks. Animals that die of this disease are found to be infected by two types of BVDV. One is the normal wild-type virus, which is noncytopathic in cultured cells. The second type of BVDV is a new strain that is cytopathic in cultured cells. The cytopathic BVDV strain is derived from the wild-type strain by recombination, which occurs during the persistent infection. Several different cytopathic BVDV strains have been sequenced, and they all have in common that NS2\u20133 (formerly called p125) is cleaved to produce NS3 (also called p80). It is the production of NS3 that renders the virus cytolytic in culture and causes lethal mucosal disease in cattle. As illustrated in Fig. 3.37, the cleavage to produce NS3 can be induced in several different ways. In at least three cytopathic BVDV strains, cellular ubiquitin sequences were inserted (in different ways) within the sequence encoding this protein, such that a cellular enzyme that cleaves specifically after ubiquitin cleaves the BVDV polyprotein to produce NS3. Another mechanism to produce NS3 was the insertion of the BVDV Npro autoprotease immediately upstream of the NS3 sequence. A third mechanism, not illustrated in the figure, is the insertion of cellular sequences derived from a protein called Jiv.",

For BVDV to persist in nature it must be able to establish persistent infection because persistently infected animals that continue to shed the virus are an important reservoir for the virus. Cytopathic viruses are not able to establish persistent infection and come to a dead end when they arise. It turns out that cleavage to form NS3 is essential for virus replication, and cleavage occurs early after infection by all BVDV strains, noncytopathic as well as cytopathic. Cleavage is effected by a protease in NS2, and this protease, like the NS3 protease of all members of the family, requires a cofactor for function. This cofactor is a cellular protein, however, not a virally encoded protein. This cellular cofactor is the protein Jiv, which forms a stable (but noncovalent) complex with NS2\u20133. The amounts of Jiv in the infected cell are limited; however, and it is soon titrated out. Once no free Jiv remains, NS2\u20133 cleavage cannot occur and no further increase in viral replication is possible, allowing the establishment of persistent infection with only limited amounts of virus being produced. If NS2\u20133 cleavage continues to occur because new protease sites have been introduced or because the virus encodes its own Jiv, virus replication continues to accelerate until it overwhelms the cell and the cell dies. As an aside, it is possible that the virus host range is controlled by the presence or absence in cells of sufficient Jiv able to act as a cofactor.",

It is a deubiquitinating enzyme (DUB) whose precise role in virus infection is unknown. Ubiquitin and ubiquitin-like proteins (UBLs) are small proteins that are covalently attached to other proteins by ubiquitinating enzymes, either as single molecules or as branched chains. The role of ubiquitination is only incompletely understood but plays an important role in many cellular processes. One role of ubiquitination is to target proteins for degradation by the proteosome, a well-studied phenomenon. Ubiquination is also involved in membrane protein trafficking, in the activation of the transcription factor NF\u03baB, in DNA repair, and in autophagy, a response to starvation in which double membrane structures are assembled that might serve as viral replication sites. Thus a viral DUB might stabilize proteins that enhance viral replication, or might be important for the induction of NF\u03baB, an important transcription factor during viral infection, or it might be important for constructing viral replication sites. There are also at least 10 UBLs derived from the same common ancestor as ubiquitin that are also conjugated to proteins to control cellular activities in ways that are but incompletely understood. One of these is the product of interferon-stimulated gene 15 (ISG15). This protein is induced by interferon and plays an unknown role in regulating the immune response to viral infection. It is not known if the viral DUB might also remove conjugated ISG15, but it is known that some other viruses target ISG conjugation.

The first mechanism proposed was primer-directed synthesis from the (\u2212)RNA template (i.e., from the antigenome produced from the genomic RNA). In this model, a primer of about 60 nucleotides is transcribed from the 3\u2032 end of the template, which is therefore identical to the 5\u2032 end of the genomic RNA. The primer is proposed to dissociate from the template and to be used by the viral RNA synthetase to reinitiate synthesis at any of the several sub-genomic promoters in the (\u2212)RNA template. Evidence for this model includes the fact that each subgenomic RNA has at its 5\u2032 end the same 60 nucleotides that are present at the 5\u2032 end of the genomic RNA, and that there is a short sequence element present at the beginning of each gene that could act as an acceptor for the primer (this sequence, e.g., is ACGAAC in the SARS CoV). A recent model proposes that the bulk of the subgenomic mRNAs are produced by independent replication of the subgenomic RNAs as replicons. Such replication is thought to be possible because the mRNAs contain both the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 sequences present in the genomic RNA, and therefore possess the promoters required for replication. Evidence for this model includes the fact that both plus-sense and minus-sense subgenomic RNAs are present in infected cells. The model favored is that the subgenomic RNAs are first produced during synthesis of minus-strand RNA from the genomic RNA. In this model, synthesis initiates at the 3\u2032 end of the genome and then jumps to the 5\u2032 leader at one of the junctions between the genes. Once produced, the subgenomic RNAs begin independent replication.",

These viruses are responsible for about 25% of human colds and are spread by a respiratory route. Unlike rhinoviruses, they cause not only upper respiratory tract infections but sometimes lower respiratory tract infections as well, which are more serious. There is weak evidence that coronaviruses might also cause gastroenteritis in humans, because there have been reports of coronaviruses in the stools of people suffering from gastroenteritis. The status of coronaviruses as human disease agents changed with the recent isolation of two new human coronaviruses, NL63 (group 1) and HKU1 (group 2A), and with the 2003 epidemic of SARS (group 2B). NL63 is an important cause of severe lower respiratory tract infections in both adults and children. HKU1 has been isolated from adults with pneumonia. SARS causes an atypical pneumonia that carries a 10% fatality rate. It is a bat virus that jumped to humans in China, causing an epidemic of SARS that began in 2002. In 2003 it was spread around the world by air travelers, eventually causing more than 8000 cases of human disease and almost 800 deaths. It was eventually controlled by culling of animals that served as intermediates in passing the virus from bats to humans, and by quarantine procedures. There is concern that epidemics will recur since the virus is widely distributed in China. This topic is covered in more detail in Chapter 8.",

Diseases associated with various coronaviruses in these animals include respiratory disease, gastroenteritis, hepatitis, and a syndrome similar to multiple sclerosis of humans, as well as other illnesses. Mouse hepatitis virus has been particularly well studied as a model for the genus. Feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) coronavirus has also been intensively studied. This virus causes a severe infection of cats that is often fatal. It is immunosuppressive and the high fatality rate results from an inability to control the infection such that viral replication eventually reaches very high levels. Vaccination of cats with either structural proteins or nonstructural proteins did not protect the animals. In fact, vaccination with structural proteins made subsequent infection with live virus more severe. Persistent infection was observed in most animals, and there is evidence that virus remains even in animals that eventually control the infection since virus replication can resume if the animals are immunosuppressed. There are some parallels with SARS infection of humans, in that T-cell lymphopenia and viral persistence have been reported.",

The virion (60nm) is enveloped, as are the coronaviruses, but the nucleocapsid, which is poorly defined, is probably icosahedral rather than helical. The arteriviruses could have arisen by the acquisition of new structural proteins by a coronavirus (or vice versa). The existence of this family, which appears to be a coronavirus with structural proteins that lead to icosahedral symmetry rather than helical symmetry, illustrates a problem for taxonomy. The ICTV has classified these viruses as a distinct family, but created the order Nidovirales to indicate their relation to the coronaviruses.",

In plant viruses in which the genome is present in more than one segment, each segment is packaged separately into different particles and infection requires the introduction into the same cell of at least one of each genome segment. It is of interest that such an arrangement is common in plant viruses but nonexistent in animal viruses, presumably because of differences in the mechanisms by which plant and animal viruses spread and infect new cells or new hosts.

This collection of viruses, sometimes referred to as the Sindbis superfamily or the alphavirus superfamily, includes the alphaviruses, the tobamoviruses, the bromoviruses, and other families of plant viruses. The genomes of the tobamovirus tobacco mosaic virus (TMV), the bromovirus brome mosaic virus (BMV), and the alphavirus Sindbis virus are compared in Fig. 3.41\n. The genome of TMV is one molecule of (+)RNA and two subgenomic RNAs are produced. The genome of BMV consists of three molecules of (+)RNA and one subgenomic RNA is made. The alphaviruses have been described. Notice that a characteristic of this superfamily is that all viruses in it produce at least one subgenomic mRNA. The members of this superfamily all share three proteins (or protein domains) with demonstrable sequence homology, as indicated in the figure. These three are a viral RNA polymerase, a helicase, and a capping enzyme (characterized by methyltransferase activity). In the case of the alphaviruses and the tobamoviruses, all three domains are found on one genome segment and readthrough is required to translate the polymerase. In the bromoviruses, the capping enzyme and the helicase are encoded on one segment, but the polymerase is encoded on a different segment. The alphaviruses encode a protease to separate the three domains from one another, but the plant viruses do not. While these three shared proteins have clearly diverged from a common ancestral source, other domains within the nonstructural proteins are different from family to family. The alphavirus protease and nsP3 are not shared with the plant viruses, while the plant viruses possess movement proteins that are not shared with the alphaviruses. The structural proteins of the different families are also distinct. These observations clearly point to the occurrence of extensive recombinational events during the evolution of this group of viruses from a common ancestral source. Recombination has brought together new combinations of genes appropriate to the different lifestyles of the various members of the superfamily. In addition, the structural proteins differ among these three families so that the structures of the virions are very different from one another. The alphaviruses are enveloped, icosahedral particles (Figs. 2.5, 2.14A, and 2.25C). TMV is rod shaped (Fig. 2.2). BMV is icosahedral but is not enveloped. Thus, recombination has brought together different RNA replication modules with different structural protein modules to give rise to the current families of viruses.",

The acquisition of an origin of replication that allowed the mRNA itself to be replicated by its encoded product would give rise to a self-replicating RNA and could have represented the first step in the development of a virus. Subsequent recombination with an mRNA encoding an RNA-binding protein that could be modeled into a capsid would give rise to a very simple virus. This protovirus could then evolve through continued mutation and recombination into something more complex. In support of this idea is the fact that the capsid protein of a large number of viruses, including bacterial viruses, plant viruses, and animal viruses that are otherwise unrelated to one another, share a common fold, suggesting that once a proper capsid protein arose it was retained during the evolution of many viruses while being modeled into new shapes.",

Computer-aided studies that have attempted to align the amino acid sequences of the proteins of different (+)RNA viruses have suggested that all these viruses share core functions that have common ancestral origins. These results are summarized in Fig. 3.43\n. All RNA viruses possess an RNA polymerase and these all appear to have derived from a common ancestral source. However, three lineages of RNA polymerases can be distinguished that probably diverged from one another early in the evolution of RNA viruses. Most RNA viruses also possess an RNA helicase that is required to unwind the RNA during replication. These helicases also appear to have diverged from a single source, but three lineages can be distinguished here as well. A third shared function in those RNA viruses with capped mRNAs is a methyltransferase gene (an activity required for capping), and two methyltransferase lineages can be distinguished. Finally there are the viral proteases that process polyproteins. The two distinct types of proteases with independent origins are the proteases derived from serine proteases (which may possess serine or cysteine at the active site) and the papain-like proteases. The different lineages of these four core activities have been reassorted in various ways during the evolution of the RNA viruses, as shown in the figure.",

            "text": "The second mechanism for divergence among viruses is mutation. Lack of proofreading in RNA replication means that the mistake frequency during replication is very high, on the order of 10\u22124. Most mistakes are deleterious and do not persist in the population. However, because the mistake frequency is so high, many different sequences can be tried rapidly because of the rapid replication rate of viruses. The net result is that the rate of sequence divergence in RNA viruses is very high, up to 106-fold faster than their eukaryotic hosts. Three studies of the rate of sequence divergence in RNA viruses are illustrated in Fig. 3.44\n. In these studies, regions of the genomes of viruses isolated over a period of many years were compared. The rates of sequence divergence in a picornavirus and in influenza virus(Chapter 4) were found to be 0.5\u20131% per year. Changes in third codon positions, which are usually silent, occur more rapidly than changes in first or second codon positions, which usually result in an amino acid substitution. In alphaviruses, which alternate between insect and vertebrate hosts, the rate of divergence was significantly less, 0.03% per year, because changes that might be neutral or positively selected in one host are often deleterious in the other host. One of the apparent paradoxes of such studies is the observation that despite rapid sequence divergence, the properties of most viruses appear to remain stable for centuries or millennia. This is due in part to the fact that although the sequence may drift, the virus continues to fill the same niche and selection ensures that the properties of the virus change only slowly. A second factor is that different domains of the genome, or even different nucleotides or amino acids, diverge at very different rates because of differences in selection pressure. Studies of the rates of divergence of viruses perforce will measure the rates of domains that diverge most rapidly. There is no fossil record to tell us when currently extant viruses might have diverged from one another, and viruses in collections have all been isolated within the last 70 years. Thus, all studies of divergence in nature examine only the divergence that has occurred within the last 70 years. Such considerations have two practical implications. Vaccines developed against most viruses continue to be effective for long periods of time, but ultimately may have to be reformulated as the virus drifts. Second, viruses can in principle change very rapidly. Human immunodeficiency virus(Chapter 6) and influenza virus(Chapter 4) do change rapidly in response to immune pressure, and viruses that jump to a new host have been known to change rapidly (e.g., the DNA virus canine parvovirus, Chapter 7, and SARS coronavirus, this chapter and Chapter 8).",

The wild-type construct pT7PVXL2 is shown in the top line. The 2A proteolytic activity normally cleaves the bond between domains P1 and P2 of the translated polyprotein. If this function is rendered nonessential, as in construct pT7PVE2A, by the insertion of a stop codon at the C terminus of P1 (solid diamond), followed by a second IRES and an initiation AUG at the beginning of 2A, virus is still produced, but forms small plaques. Thus separation of the structural region and the nonstructural region in this way results in viable virus. However, if the proteolytic activity of 2A is inactivated by mutation of the catalytic cysteine to alanine as in pT7PVE2AX, no virus is produced, demonstrating that the proteolytic activity of 2Apro is necessary for other functions in addition to the P1/P2 cleavage.
