            "text": "Plasmodium falciparum merozoite invasion into erythrocytes is an essential step of the blood-stage cycle, survival of parasites, and malaria pathogenesis. P. falciparum merozoite Rh5 interacting protein (PfRipr) forms a complex with Rh5 and CyRPA in sequential molecular events leading to erythrocyte invasion. Recently we described pfRipr as a conserved protein that induces strain-transcending growth inhibitory antibodies in in vitro assays. However, being a large and complex protein of 1086 amino acids (aa) with 87 cysteine residues, PfRipr is difficult to express in conventional expression systems towards vaccine development. in this study we sought to identify the most potent region of pfRipr that could be developed to overcome difficulties related to protein expression, as well as to elucidate the invasion inhibitory mechanism of anti-pfRipr antibodies. Using the wheat germ cell-free system, ecto-pfRipr and truncates of approximately 200 aa were expressed as soluble proteins. We demonstrate that antibodies against PfRipr truncate 5 (PfRipr_5: C 720 -D 934 ), a region within the pfRipr c-terminal eGflike domains, potently inhibit merozoite invasion. furthermore, the antibodies strongly block pfRipr/ Rh5 interaction, as well as that between PfRipr and its erythrocyte-surface receptor, SEMA7A. Taken together, PfRipr_5 is a potential candidate for further development as a blood-stage malaria vaccine.",

In 2016, more than 3 billion people were reportedly at risk of infection, with an estimated 200 million cases and more than 400,000 deaths, primarily in young children living in sub-Saharan Africa 1 . Development of a malaria vaccine of high efficacy is considered a critical global agenda towards the achievement of malaria control and elimination. However, this progress has been greatly hampered by antigen polymorphism and low efficacy among target antigens 2,3 . Relatively conserved antigens that induce broadly cross-reactive antibodies and cell-mediated immune responses may provide long lasting and more efficacious protection 4-8 . It is also suggested that the next generation vaccines should incorporate multi-stage and/or multivalent targets aimed at inducing both humoral and cellular immunity 9 .",

            "text": "The process of merozoite invasion of erythrocytes, that marks the beginning of the blood stage cycle of P. falciparum infections, takes less than 2 min and is characterized by dynamic molecular and cellular events 10-12 . Upon egress from the infected erythrocyte the merozoite is exposed to low potassium levels which trigger intracellular calcium release. The release activates secretion of adhesins and invasins, localized in the micronemes, onto the parasite surface 13-15 . Following the initial recognition of the host erythrocyte the parasite orients itself so that its apical end is directly facing the target erythrocyte membrane. The rhoptries are subsequently triggered to release invasion ligands that interact with erythrocyte receptors 16, 17 . Irreversible attachment of merozoites to erythrocytes then occurs through formation of an electron-dense nexus between the host and parasite membranes, termed a tight junction and composed primarily of PfAMA1 and RON complex proteins 15 . The nexus opens out into a ring-like moving junction, which envelops the merozoite, finally resealing behind it, such that the parasite is completely internalized within an intracellular parasitophorous vacuole 18 . Upon successful invasion echinocytosis occurs, most likely caused by entry of Ca 2+ into the erythrocyte, resulting in shrinkage of the infected erythrocyte 10, 11 . Because at the blood stage cycle the merozoites are exposed to various host immune responses, albeit for a short period between host cell egress and invasion, it is considered an ideal target for vaccine development 12, 16 .",

The PfRhs include PfRh1, PfRh2a, PfRh2b, PfRh3, PfRh4, and Rh5. Rh5, the smallest member of the PfRhs, is localized within the merozoite rhoptries where it relocates to the moving junction during invasion 20 . Unlike genes encoding other PfRhs and EBLs, although functionally important, only the gene encoding Rh5 (PF3D7_0424100) is refractory to targeted gene deletion 21, 22 . These reports suggest that the protein plays a crucial role in parasite survival, and this is supported functionally by confirmed binding to basigin on erythrocytes 23 . In addition, Rh5 forms a complex with P. falciparum Rh5-interacting protein (PfRipr) 24,25 and cysteine-rich protective antigen (CyRPA) 5,26 . Rh5, CyRPA, and PfRipr are now considered to be promising blood-stage vaccine candidates [5] [6] [7] 24, 26, 27 , since the PfRipr/CyRPA/Rh5 complex plays a central role in the sequential molecular events leading to merozoite invasion and the genes have limited sequence polymorphism in P. falciparum 5,27,28 .",

Additionally, we applied WGCFS and AlphaScreen, a protein-protein based interaction screening system, and surface plasmon resonance (SPR) to systematically screen for and validate potential receptors of PfRipr on the surface of human erythrocytes. We demonstrated that PfRipr directly interacts with recombinant proteins of three erythrocyte surface proteins. Antibodies to a region within the PfRipr C-terminal EGF-like domains inhibited merozoite invasion and PfRipr association with Rh5 and SEMA7A. Taken together, the identified PfRipr region represents a promising candidate for further development as a blood-stage malaria vaccine.",

Based on several studies 5, 26, 33 , we sought to understand the nature of the complex formed between PfRipr, Rh5, and CyRPA, and if this interaction was direct or indirect. To demonstrate and quantify the interaction between PfRipr and Rh5, as well as with CyRPA, surface plasmon resonance (SPR) analysis was performed. Recombinant ecto regions of both Rh5 and CyRPA were expressed as GST-fusion proteins using WGCFS and affinity purified by virtue of the GST tag. The sizes of affinity purified recombinant Rh5 and CyRPA were as estimated (Figs. 3a, S2). However, contrary to a recent study 34 , we observed that PfRipr directly interacts with Rh5 at a K D value of 4.8 \u00d7 10 \u221210 M (Fig. 3b, Table 1, Fig. S3a ). Comparably, PfRipr and CyRPA exhibited a K D value of 6.9 \u00d7 10 \u22128 M (Fig. 3b, Table 1, Fig. S3a ). Thus, we demonstrated for the first time that PfRipr interacts directly with both Rh5 and CyRPA. pfRipr binds to human erythrocytes. To understand the mechanism of invasion inhibition by anti-PfRipr antibodies, we sought to determine whether PfRipr binds directly to the surface of host erythrocytes. First, we generated transgenic parasite lines expressing full-length PfRipr (M 1 -N 1086 ) with a C-terminal 3 \u00d7 HA tag (PfRipr-HA). In vivo PfRipr-HA expression was confirmed by immunofluorescence assay (IFA), showing co-localization with AMA1 in the micronemes suggesting native PfRipr localization (Fig. 4a) . We further observed that anti HA-tag could immunoprecipitate basigin and Rh5 (Fig. S4a ). Since studies have indicated that culture supernatants can be a source of parasite proteins that bind host erythrocytes 35 , we used culture supernatants of the transgenic parasites to further confirm successful expression and release of PfRipr-HA into the culture supernatant (Fig. 4b) . Consistent with the reported size of native PfRipr 5,24 , signals at approximately 70 and 120 kDa were observed (Fig. 4b) . Although an earlier study had suggested that PfRipr is processed, and that the 60-70 kDa signal represents a processed C-terminal fragment, a recent study demonstrated that antibodies against the N-terminal and C-terminal EGF like domains of PfRipr detected the two signals, suggesting that the signals are derived from full-length PfRipr 5,24 and the 70-kDa signal might be due to multiple disulfide bonds in PfRipr despite reducing conditions. The ratio of the 2 signals varied in each preparation of the SDS-PAGE sample even from same culture supernatant or parasite lysate (data not shown).",

            "text": "Invasion of erythrocytes by P. falciparum merozoites is a fundamental step in malaria pathogenesis and therefore a primary target for vaccine development 16, 41 . Understanding biochemical interactions is key to identifying the role of proteins involved in the invasion process. One protein of particular interest is PfRipr, a leading subunit vaccine candidate and a vital protein in erythrocyte invasion 5, 25, 30, 42 . We recently determined that PfRipr is highly conserved among African isolates, with the region spanning C 720 -D 934 (PfRipr_5) having only a single amino acid substitution at E 829 Q 30 . The PfRipr/CyRPA/Rh5-basigin complex is suggested to play a central role in the sequential molecular events leading to merozoite invasion 25 . We and others have further demonstrated that specific antibodies raised against recombinant PfRipr exhibit strain-transcending inhibition of P. falciparum in vitro growth 25, 30 . However, it is not understood how Rh5 and CyRPA interact with PfRipr, and how anti-PfRipr antibodies consistently achieve high GIA activity in vitro. Here, we investigated the mechanism of anti-PfRipr antibodies in inhibiting merozoite invasion. PfRipr, being a 126-kDa protein with 87 cysteine residues, is difficult to express as full-length protein in conventional expression systems. Therefore, we utilized the eukaryotic WGCFS to express PfRipr, which we subsequently subjected to systematic biochemical analyses. We demonstrated that antibodies to a short region of PfRipr (PfRipr_5: C 720 -D 934 ) in the C-terminal spanning five EGF-like domains (fifth to ninth EGF-like domains) inhibited merozoite invasion, as well as blocked interaction between PfRipr and its erythrocyte receptors. The GIA potency observed was lower than in a recent study 43 , an aspect that should be given careful consideration in future studies. Nevertheless, PfRipr_5 is a relatively small region that deserves further evaluation for its candidacy as a blood-stage vaccine antigen.",

            "text": "Previous studies indicated that PfRipr localizes to merozoite micronemes and is released onto the parasite surface during invasion, forming a tripartite complex with Rh5 and CyRPA 25 . The complex is then anchored to the surface of erythrocyte via basigin 5, 24, 44 . However, the data presented here is somewhat contradictory to those studies. Specifically, using the AVEXIS assay Galaway et al. did not observe direct interaction between PfRipr/ Rh5 34 . Similarly, the Rh5/CyRPA/PfRipr complex structural analysis did not directly show PfRipr/Rh5 binding 45 . Nonetheless, they did observe that, after binding to basigin, the Rh5/CyRPA/PfRipr complex disassembled to generate an erythrocyte membrane associated Rh5, and PfRipr which migrated as a single band of high molecular weight (about 700 kDa), suggesting that they were in the same complex as oligomers. Based on the latter observation, our report on a PfRipr/Rh5 direct interaction may offer insight to the situational path of the Rh5/CyRPA/ PfRipr complex after binding to basigin. Indeed, our EBA studies with episomally expressed PfRipr fused with an HA tag (Fig. 4c) is consistent with previous results showing that PfRipr was present within the erythrocyte membrane pellet 45 . We further demonstrated that GST-PfRipr binds to the erythrocyte surface and is resistant to chymotrypsin, trypsin, and neuraminidase treatment similar to PfRipr-HA. In this non-traditional EBA, we incubated recombinant GST-PfRipr with erythrocytes, washed, and then hemolyzed the cell with tetanolysin. The erythrocyte ghost was further washed with buffer, mixed with sample buffer and applied onto an SDS-PAGE gel. Thus, using AlphaScreen, we probed for interactions between biotinylated PfRipr ectodomain as bait and GST-fused erythrocyte surface receptors (Fig. 5a,b) . Subsequently, analyses by SPR confirmed that PfRipr directly interacts with AMIGO2, SEMA7A, and NPTN (Fig. 5c ). In addition, anti-SEMA7A antibody immunoprecipitated recombinant GST-PfRipr suggesting that recombinant PfRipr could bind native SEMA7A (Fig. 5d) . Taken together, these findings suggest that PfRipr can function as a parasite ligand. These data need to be further validated since it could mean that (i) the native PfRipr indeed binds to erythrocyte SEMA7A, or (ii) recombinant GST-Ripr protein is structurally dissimilar from native PfRipr, perhaps due to lacking a parasite specific post-translational modification, giving it a different erythrocyte surface binding phenotype.",

            "text": "Attempts to genetically disrupt PfRipr have been unsuccessful, suggesting that it is essential for blood-stage parasite growth 24 . In addition, using P. falciparum lines conditionally expressing PfRipr, Volz et al. demonstrated that loss of PfRipr function blocks growth due to the inability of merozoites to invade erythrocytes 25 . Consistent with this, anti-PfRipr antibodies have been known to induce high GIA activity 30 . The key question is therefore, what is the mechanism of anti-PfRipr antibodies on parasite growth inhibition? In our study, anti-PfRipr polyclonal antibodies blocked the interaction between PfRipr and Rh5, as well as between PfRipr and a host receptor SEMA7A. It was therefore postulated that the antibody blockage of PfRipr binding to its multiple partners could explain the observed growth inhibition activity. However, we were unable to show a correlation between interaction inhibition in SPR and in vitro parasite GIA. Thus, in future studies we would like to address the mode of inhibition with monoclonal antibodies, as well as validate the in vitro SPR findings by an in vivo protein-protein interaction detection system. SEMA7A, the John-Milton-Hagen blood group antigen, was recently reported as the receptor for P. falciparum merozoite-specific TRAP homolog, MTRAP 46 . SEMA7A is a GPI-anchored membrane bound protein expressed www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/ on several tissues with diverse functions; however, the functional role of the interaction remains unclear since antibodies to either MTRAP or SEMA7A did not cause inhibition in in vitro parasite invasion assays 46 . Similarly, our attempts to inhibit merozoite invasion with anti-SEMA7A antibodies showed no GIA activity, possibly due to insufficient antibody molecules which target SEMA7A surfaces important for PfRipr/SEMA7A interactions (Fig. S4c) . Another possibility is that the inhibition caused by the anti-PfRipr_5 antibodies may not have been due to inhibition of PfRipr-SEMA7A interaction, but by another unknown mechanism such as anti-PfRipr antibodies inhibiting PfRipr/Rh5 interaction 43 . Our analysis showed that recombinant PfRipr/SEMA7A interacts at a nM level K D (Fig. 5c) ; however, we could not immunoprecipitate a native PfRipr/Rh5/SEMA7A complex. This could suggest that the interaction is a \"strong transient complex\" and a trigger would be needed for its dissociation 47 . Indeed, anti-PfRipr_5 antibodies inhibit both PfRipr/Rh5 and PfRipr/SEMA7A interactions (Fig. 6a,b) , suggesting that these PfRipr interacting regions are close. Recently, Healer et al. reported that neutralizing anti-PfRipr monoclonal antibody prevents merozoite invasion by not blocking Rh5/CyRPA/PfRipr complex formation but by another mechanism 43 . Although our results may support an alternative mechanism of blocking ligand-receptor interaction, this model needs confirmation. Still, the K D values determined by SPR with recombinant PfRipr and SAMA7A proteins were low and suggested a high affinity interaction; however, this is generally not the case for natural ligand-receptor interactions which have low affinity adhesion 48 . To understand the PfRipr/SEMA7A interaction in detail, we may need further analysis for K D values using other methods, for example radioligand binding assays.",
