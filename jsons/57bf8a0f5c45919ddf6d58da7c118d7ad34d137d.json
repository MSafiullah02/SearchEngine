Numerical analysis and model verification are performed to calibrate the system parameters with official public information about the number of people infected, and then to evaluate several COVID -19 scenarios potentially applicable to India. Our findings provide an estimation of disease occurrence in the near future, and also demonstrate the importance of governmental and individual efforts to control the effects and time of the pandemic-related critical situations. We also give special emphasis to individual reactions in the containment process.",

The aim of the lockdown was to slow down the spread of the novel coronavirus, to allow the Government to follow a multipronged strategy to add more beds in its hospital network, to increase the development of the COVID-19 test kits and of personal protective equipments (PPEs) for health workers, etc. The government frequently uses different platforms to keep the public aware of COVID -19. In India, conditions including very high population density in urban areas, unavailability of vaccines and inadequate data about the disease's transmitting process also make it a herculean task to adequately fight the disease.",

Recently, concerning the current COVID-19 pandemic, considerable research has been carried out using actual occurrence from the impacted countries, analyzing various aspects of the epidemic, as well as assessing the impact of preventive approaches adopted in order to limit the epidemic in the countries concerned [9]. In particular, various kinds of dynamical models have been employed, essentially considering nonlinear governing equations. For instance, the nature of human coronavirus infection and defining contact between human cells and the virus have been described in Ref [10] . The statistical model for estimating virus transmission, taking into account a condensed version of the bats-hosts-reservoir-people transmission model, known as a reservoir-people model was also reported in Ref [11] . Susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered (SEIR) model is an important tool for tackling coronavirus transmission statistical simulations. Lin and his co-workers have proposed a method to develop analytical models for the COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan taking into account human behavioral responses and government decisions, such as holiday extension, travel restriction, hospitalization, and quarantine [3] . Some recent studies based on these works use numerical simulations and attempt to provide a reliable real-time forecast of COVID-19 cases in various countries with the help of this mathematical model. For instance, Savi et al have obtained the general transmission of the novel coronavirus to test various scenarios of coronavirus propagation in different countries, taking into account the model testing of the evolution of infected populations in China, Italy, Iran and Brazil based on government and individual reactions [12] .",

Further, the general propagation of the novel coronavirus is also studied in our investigation to evaluate different scenarios of the propagation of coronavirus. In addition, the model verification takes into consideration the evolution of the infected population and simulates different scenarios based on the rate of transmission and the governmental and, especially individual reactions. Finally it proposes potential future evolution of the spread and possible mitigations, specifically emphasizing the significance of individual reactions at the societal level.",

This model was inspired by He et al's original influenza model [13, 14] . The SEIR model also has two supplementary terms: D is a public perception of risk with respect to serious cases and deaths, and C is the number of recorded and unreported incidents. In addition, S is the susceptible population, E is the population exposed, I is the currently infectious population (excluding the recovered and death cases) and R is the population removed which includes both the cases of recovered and deaths. The simplified version of the governing equations takes account of the interaction between all these populations, and is represented by the following set of coupled nonlinear differential equations [3] where \u03b3 is the mean infectious period, \u03b3 R is the delayed removed period, which denotes the relation between removed population and the infected one, \u03c3 is the mean latent period, d denotes the proportion of severe cases and \u03bb is the mean duration of public reaction [3, 4, 12] . In Eq.(1), \u03b2(t) denotes the transmission rate function which incorporates the impact of governmental action (1 \u2212 \u03b1), and the individual action, which is denoted by the function 1 \u2212 D N k [3, 12] . Here, the parameter k defines the intensity of individual reaction, which is measured on a scale of 0 to 10 5 with a normal value of 1117.3 obtained from previous and recent epidemic and pandemic studies [3, 13] . We also assume that the effect of governmental action is different during different lock-down periods. Therefore, the transmission rate \u03b2(t) is defined as",

It should be noted that our analysis considers all infected cases in entire India, and it is not restricted to any specific state or place. The parameters which are used in the model are specified in Table I , and these parameters should be treated as average since they are appropriate for the country as a whole. Initially, we started with the value of transmission rate starting with \u03b2 0 = 0.56 and the value attributable to governmental action strength is also considered as different during the periods before and after lock-down. Fig. 2 charts the transmission rate \u03b2(t), before and after the lock-down period with respect to various governmental action strengths. One may note that one important constraint on the parameter \u03b2(t) is that this variable should be a step-like function with time due to the impact of government action strength. Therefore, using the daily COVID-19 incidence data, numerical simulation is carried out for the model (2) with the value of \u03b2 0 = 0.56. Fig. 3 shows the evolution of the number of infected individuals (excluding both recovered and death population), indicating a strong agreement between simulation and actual data.

This study helps to predict newly infected individuals in the near future. For instance, we choose low values of governmental action strengths, \u03b1 = 0.3 and 0.4, in the third lock-down period (due to the announcement of relaxation in the lock-down by the Government of India) compared to \u03b1 = 0.45 during the second lock-down period, Table I. and our model study predicts the number of infected individuals reasonably well with the real data for \u03b1 = 0.4 in the region IV (See black curve in Fig.3(b) ).

Strategies for prevention include preventive mechanisms such as lock-down, information campaign by newspapers and television, adequate hand sanitation, social distancing etc. which results in slowing down the COVID-19 transmission process. These strategies of prevention as modeled in terms of the parameter \u03b1 and k in Eq. (2), which imply that there will be a reduction in the transmission rate \u03b2(t). Now, we start with the efficiency of prevention by varying government action strength alone, keeping k at fixed low strength k = 1117.3 [3] . For such low values of strengths, that is for \u03b1 = 0.22 and \u03b1 = 0.25, it is observed that the number of infected individuals will peak around 8 \u00d7 10 5 and 7 \u00d7 10 5 respectively by June 10 (see Fig.4(a)-(b) ). If the strength is increased (for \u03b1 = 0.30), the peak of the infected/active people cases may decrease and the occurrence of the peak is shifted down to 5 \u00d7 10 5 on June 10 (see Fig.4(c) ).

However, the later will not also help in reducing the infection to approach zero unless perhaps \u03b1 approaches a value close to unity. Moreover, it is not practical to keep increasing the governmental action to a higher and higher level even in the fourth lock-down period and further due to the necessity of opening up the economic front for survival of the nation. On the other hand, with relaxation of governmental action over time, particularly in the fourth lock-down period and subsequent period, the above type of prevention method alone will not end up in the eradication of the disease.",

It will also include alerting fellow citizens to wear masks, to follow personal hygiene and social distancing, political and social organizations urging fellow citizens to follow social norms and so on. Now, we also address the importance of individual reactions with low value of governmental action strength \u03b1 = 0.3 and \u03b1 = 0.4 in the region V (which corresponds to the period beyond May 18) in Figs. 5. We observe from Figs. 5 that the number of infected people increases for no action of individual response (for k = 0), while the number of infected people decreases when the value of individual response increases to k=3000, 5000 and 10000. From these figures we also learn that individual behavioral responses are also very important along with governmental action.",

The corresponding figures show that the disease continues to infect more and more people due to low value of governmental action strength, but it can become controllable with respect to appropriate individual reactions. In order to break the chain of infection spread and to get more controllable handle on infected individuals one may choose immediate action of the individual reaction response after third lock-down period, that is range IV, and consider appropriate values of \u03b1 and k in the time window V in Figs. 6. For \u03b1 = 0.3 or 0.4 and k = 10000 or k = 20000 the newly infected cases tend to decrease within a few weeks, after May 18 (see Figs. 6(a)-(b) ). If the individual reaction is increased further (k = 30000 and k = 50000) we see that the disease can be effectively eradicated within 1 to 2 months from 18 th May, 2020 (see Figs. 6(a)-(b) ).",

This amount of rise in the infected cases has happened after some minimal relaxation in the government lock-down, and several hundred new cases are reported every day from different locations across India. This is a worrying situation, because India is going to encounter a larger number of infected people amidst a huge population within a few days or weeks due to various local situations and other factors.

Our findings also indicate that the government and in particular individual efforts are important in reducing infected populations and also in reducing the overall epidemic period.

But we find that for appropriate increased values of individual reaction, even with low governmental action strength, there can be dramatic reduction in the total number of infected people. Depending upon the increased individual contribution the disease can be effectively controlled in a rather short period. It is then imperative that society as a whole contributes its might by simple social measures, besides appropriate governmental action. These combined efforts can contribute towards a total control of the disease in a short period in India and perhaps elsewhere as well.",
