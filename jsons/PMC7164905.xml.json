Despite knowing for many years that \u201ca serious international epidemic could be caused by a pathogen currently unknown to cause human disease\u201d,1 this virus is showing that most countries failed to prepare for such an emergency. The previous outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), and Ebola virus disease demonstrated that strong public institutions that can collaborate, communicate, and cooperate are essential to countering such a threat.2 We know that they are the backbone of a nation's security and a guardian of people's health. Yet, after these outbreaks we became complacent and failed to invest in them. Now we are paying a terrible price for this indolence.",

The abstracts selected for oral presentation at CUGH 2020 are included in this special issue of The Lancet Global Health. Additionally, some of the presentations slated for the conference will be compiled in an open access eBook in the next few months.",
