Employing a more realistic model that considers heterogeneous contact is consequently necessary. Here, we use a contact network to reconstruct unprotected, protected contact, and airborne spread to simulate the two-stages outbreak of COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) on the \"Diamond Princess\" cruise ship. We employ Bayesian inference and Metropolis-Hastings sampling to estimate the model parameters and quantify the uncertainties by the ensemble simulation technique. During the early epidemic with intensive social contacts, the results reveal that the average transmissibility was 0.026 and the basic reproductive number was 6.94, triple that in the WHO report, indicating that all 0 people would be infected in one month. The and decreased to 0.0007 and 0.2 0 when quarantine was implemented. The reconstruction suggests that diluting the airborne virus concentration in closed settings is useful in addition to isolation, and high-risk susceptible should follow rigorous prevention measures in case exposed.",

However, these models assume that epidemics transmit in a homogeneous population, i.e., new infectees are from the group of susceptible individuals who can be infected with the same transmission probability. This assumption is far from the social contact patterns, especially when population structure is a spatial-temporal variant with quarantine, and socioeconomic activities [13] .

This proves that the average transmissibility is more stable, and reasonable judgement can be derived by turning to . Based on the simulations and the related quantities, proper containment efforts can be deduced to address the various epidemic scenarios. Compared with protected contact, the airborne spread test is implemented in a larger population. However, its epidemic curves with or without quarantine are closer (data deviations of protected contact and airborne spread tests are 14.46% and 0.36%, respectively). We believe this difference is mainly attributed to incorrect control work, i.e., isolation works well in managing transmission in social contact scenarios; however, when a virus is transmitted via air, isolation may not be sufficient. Inspired by the NCSI Eq. (2), a better approach is to disperse the crowds and/or ventilate the closed spaces, which can dilute the virus concentration in air. It further provides the correct information that air exchanges are vital for the prevention of COVID-19 outbreaks in the closed special settings, such as hospitals, malls, and mass gathering activities.",
