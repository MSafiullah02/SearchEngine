ZIKV genome consists of a single-stranded positive sense RNA molecule of approximately 10,800 nt in length [3] . Although ZIKV enzootic activity was reported in diverse countries of Africa and Asia, few human cases were reported until 2007, when a large epidemic took place in Micronesia [4] . A large ZIKV outbreak occurred in French Polynesia during 2013-2014 and then spread to other Pacific islands [5] . In early 2015, a ZIKV epidemic outbreak took place in Brazil, currently estimated at 440,000-1,300,000 cases [6] . In November 2015, the Brazilian Ministry of Health reported a 20fold increase in cases of neonatal microcephaly, which corresponds geographically and temporally to the ZIKV outbreak [7] . Due to this global threat, World Health Organization (WHO) declared a public health emergency of international concern on February 1 st , 2016 [8] .",

The development of animal models permits to begin to understand the underlying pathology of ZIKV infection [12, 13] . Modeling ZIKV infection in mice revealed direct effects of ZIKV on neural precursor cells development, including proliferation, differentiation and cell death, which may link ZIKV with the development of microcephaly [14] . Notably, genes associated with microcephaly were downregulated in ZIKV-infected mice brains [14] and NPCs [11] .

Flaviviruses are characterized by a relatively long and highly structured 3'UTR [44] . This region contains a number of stem-loops (SLs) and tertiary structures conserved among members of the genus Flavivirus [45] , which makes it resistant to RNase degradation [46] . One of these SLs, the 3'SL located at the very end of the 3'UTR has been shown to be crucial for viral replication and interacts with a variety of proteins [47] . In order to gain insight into the location and possible functions of MD-21, the secondary structure of the 3'UTR of the consensus sequences obtained for ZIKV genomes included in these studies was established (Fig. 2) . Interestingly, we found that the pre-miRNA-MD21 is identical to flaviviruses 3'SL and contains the short 5'-ACAG-3' sequence in the top loop of the 3'SL, which is conserved among the members of this genus (see Fig. 2 ).",

These miRNAs are situated in different ZIKV genome regions and are highly conserved among ZIKV strains. Two of these miRNA (ZIKV-miRNA-MD1 and -MD17) were found to hybridize with target transcripts from genes previously shown to be associated with microcephaly.

Besides, previous phylogenetic analysis characterized two major genetic lineages of ZIKV, the African and Asian lineages[39]. Very recently, phylogenetic analyses revealed the presence of three distinct lineages, (Asian/American lineage, African lineage 1 and African lineage 2)[40]. For these reasons, it is important to establish the degree of conservation of the pre-miRNAs and mature miRNAs sequences of predicted miRNAs in the genome of Natal-RGN ZIKV strain among ZIKV strains from all genetic lineages and isolated elsewhere.In order to gain insight into this matter, all available and comparable ZIKV strains for which complete genome sequences are known were downloaded from the GenBank",
