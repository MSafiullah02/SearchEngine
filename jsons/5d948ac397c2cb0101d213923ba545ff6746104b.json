Five of those 6 were identified as being infected with the 2019-nCoV, but none had been to the Wuhan market, and only 2 had visited a Wuhan hospital.

Five days before that onset, patients 2 and 3 came from Wuhan, the focus of the 2019-nCov epidemic. It was confirmed that patients 2, 3, and 4 had not any symptoms for at least 2 weeks before the onset of illness in patient 1. Although the initial infection sources in patient 1 were most likely patient 2 or 3 during their incubation period, it is also possible that patient 4 was infected by patient 2 or 3 and then infected patient 1 during her incubation period. Because they lived in one bedroom. Thus, the infection source for patient 1 may have been patients 2, 3 and/or 4. The findings indicate that a person with 2019-nCoV might be infectious during the incubation period. Patients 2 and 3were living in Wuhan. They did not eat out, come into contact with wild animals, or visit a farmers markets. They were not exposed to patients with fever or pneumonia and did not visit local hospitals in Wuhan. Zeng and colleagues [13] have reported that SARS cases are infectious only during their symptomatic period and are noninfectious during the incubation period [13] . Both SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV infect intrapulmonary epithelial cells more than cells of the upper airways [14, 15] . Therefore, individuals in close contact with symptomatic patients with SARS should be isolated for medical observation. However, human airway epithelial cells were used to isolate 2019-nCoV, which was declared to be the seventh member of the family of coronaviruses that infect humans, different from both MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV [6] . The nasopharyngeal and throat swab samples from all 4 patients were 2019-nCoV positive in our study, indicating that 2019-nCoV can infect the upper respiratory tract. According to the National Health Commission's guideline for diagnosis and treatment of pneumonia caused by 2019-nCov, isolation and in vitro cultures showed that 2019-nCov can be found in human respiratory epithelial cells in about 96 hours [16] . These results support the hypothesis that 2019-nCoV is more infectious than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, as it is easily discharged through the respiratory tract.",

Here are our recommendations. First, the epidemiological exposure history should be taken as the most important reference for judging the potential source of infection, and isolation and protection measures should be further strengthened for the relevant persons with clear risk factors for exposure history. Second, the determination of close contacts should also include those who are exposed to case patients during their incubation. Third, research into and development of a high-sensitivity rapid diagnostic reagent for 2019-nCoV should be accelerated, to facilitate the screening of infected persons among clinical and close contacts. Fourth, health education should be further strengthened, and protective equipment should be properly used to reduce the exposure to 2019-nCoV. Finally, if possible, the isolation and medical observation of close contacts should be centralized under the premise of the safely transport, such as masks, single-person transfer and transport vehicle disinfection, et al. It is important to establish a community supervision mechanism when home isolation and observation are needed. ",
