Indeed, substantially elevated levels of IFN\u03b3 are measured in patients with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome24, 25 and HLH,26, 27, 28 both cytokine driven diseases. Furthermore, overexpression of IFN\u03b3 in transgenic mice is sufficient to drive systemic and organ inflammation,29 and in animal models of pHLH30, 31 and sHLH,16, 17 cytokine neutralization studies revealed the pivotal role of IFN\u03b3. In the model of TLR9-induced cytokine release syndrome, IFN\u03b3 was shown to be critical for the development of some features of sHLH including cytopenias and hepatic dysfunction.16, 17 Although these findings are intriguing, their relevance to the pathophysiology of human disease remains to be proven.",

Using a model that mimics infection-driven sHLH (by giving mice repeated injections of CpG-ODN), for the first time, we quantify the magnitude of IFN\u03b3 produced as compared to steady-state conditions. Neutralization at various points of disease demonstrated that the complete neutralization of IFN\u03b3 activity in organs was necessary to reverse disease parameters. This abrogation of IFN\u03b3 correlated with the decrease of 2 IFN\u03b3 signature chemokines, CXCL9 and CXCL10, in blood, which served as robust serum biomarkers to reflect disease status. These CXCL9 and CXCL10 levels positively correlated with sHLH parameters, including thrombocytopenia, hyperferritinemia, and lymphopenia. These results were in fact also clinically meaningful as they could be translated to human using data obtained from pediatric sHLH patients. In these children, circulating CXCL9 and CXCL10 concentrations were found to be proportional to IFN\u03b3 levels and correlated with active sHLH parameters (ie, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, hyperferritinemia, and hepatic dysfunction). Taken together, the results of this translational study support the expansion of clinical trials beyond blockade of IFN\u03b3 in pHLH to other cytokine release syndromes. Furthermore, these observations support the use of CXCL9 and CXCL10 as markers of Type II interferonopathies as well as indicators of response to therapeutic intervention.",

Primary HLH was excluded based on the absence of family history, absence of mutations in the genes known to cause HLH, and presence of normal functional studies (including NK activity, perforin expression, and CD107 degranulation assay). An underlying infection was demonstrated in 7 patients (Ebstein-Barr virus in 2, cytomegalovirus in 1, rotavirus in 1, human herpes virus 6 in 1, propionibacteria sepsis in 1, and morganella morganii osteomyelitis in 1).

This step ensured the stability of the mAb-cytokine complex allowing for a more precise quantification of the total IFN\u03b3.

The stimulation of TLR9, provoked by DNA rich in CpG-ODN motifs repeatedly injected led to hypercytokinemia (Fig 1\nA). Within 6 hours after the first TLR9 stimulation, IFN\u03b3, IL-6, TNF\u03b1, CXCL9, and CXCL10 were elevated in the blood. This was accompanied by de novo messenger RNA (mRNA) synthesis of proinflammatory mediators in the liver (Fig 1\nB) and spleen (Supplementary Fig 1). After subsequent TLR9 stimulations, IFN\u03b3, CXCL9, and CXCL10 levels oscillated similarly suggesting that these chemokines may be biomarkers of fluctuations in IFN\u03b3 activity. Conversely, IL-6 and TNF\u03b1 levels were measured at a more stable rate (Fig 1).",

To investigate this possibility, we set out to quantify the amount of IFN\u03b3 produced in tissues, by injecting the anti-mIFN\u03b3 mAb, XMG1.2, to mice while receiving the disease inducing CpG-ODN. We took advantage of a previously described phenomena,32 in which IFN\u03b3 in tissues is captured by XMG1.2, that then drains via the lymphatics into the blood leading to accumulation of the cytokine as a complex to the mAb.

Owing to these levels of total IFN\u03b3 produced in this model and our experience with other IFN\u03b3-induced disease models, for example, pHLH,31 we next evaluated if the dose of 100 mg/kg of XMG1.2 was sufficient to neutralize IFN\u03b3 tissue activity. To this end, mice were injected with XMG1.2 24 hours post CpG-ODN administration, and the mRNA expression in liver of the IFN\u03b3-dependent gene, CIITA pIV, was evaluated over time. As a robust induction of CIITA pIV, mRNA was observed after the first CpG-ODN injection, the elimination of CIITA pIV expression after XMG1.2 administration demonstrated that complete neutralization of IFN\u03b3 in tissues was achieved (Fig 3\nB).",

XMG1.2 was administered on day (d) 1 (post the peak of total IFN\u03b3), d3, and d6 to mice challenged with CpG-ODN on d0, 2, 4, and 7. Serum levels for both IL-6 and TNF\u03b1 were significantly lower and maintained close to baseline (Fig 3\nC). Interestingly, neutralization of IFN\u03b3 in tissues resulted in the decrease in mRNA levels for IL-6 in the liver (Fig 3\nD) and spleen (Fig 3\nE), and for TNF\u03b1 in the liver (Fig 3\nD). IFN\u03b3 neutralization significantly reduced body weight loss, splenomegaly, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, and hyperferritinemia (Fig 4\nA). Liver inflammation, illustrated by cellular infiltration creating inflammatory cell foci, was also reduced after administration of XMG1.2 (Fig 4\nB). The role for IFN\u03b3 at a later stage of disease was also investigated, that is, when clinical features and laboratory abnormalities were established (Fig 2), and total IFN\u03b3 production was at a plateau (Fig 3\nA). Neutralization of IFN\u03b3 from d4 resulted in the abrogation of the hyper-release of IL-6 and TNF\u03b1 to the blood (Fig 5\nA). Moreover, this delay IFN\u03b3 neutralization resulted in a reduction of body weight loss and an improvement in splenomegaly (Fig 5\nA). Thrombocytopenia, anemia, and hyperferritinemia were ameliorated although lymphopenia remained unchanged (Fig 5\nA). The delayed inhibition also controlled liver inflammation as a significant drop in cellular infiltration as well-decreased IL-6 and TNF\u03b1 mRNA expression were observed (Fig 5\nB). Taken together, the efficient neutralization of the high rate of tissue production of IFN\u03b3 was required to induce a significant amelioration of the cytokine release syndrome parameters.",

The significant decrease in CXCL9 and CXCL10 in blood (Fig 6\nB) is further testament to the shutdown of chemokine production in tissues. These results suggest that serum levels of CXCL9 and CXCL10 reflect IFN\u03b3 activity in TLR9-induced sHLH. Confirming this association, a significant correlation of serum IFN\u03b3 levels with serum concentration of CXCL9 and CXCL10 was observed in CpG-treated mice in absence of XMG1.2 (Fig 6\nC). Finally, correlative analysis was performed and demonstrated that levels for the IFN\u03b3-dependant chemokines in blood were associated to syndrome parameters including thrombocytopenia, hyperferritinemia, and lymphopenia (Fig 7\n). However, no significant correlation was seen between serum IFN\u03b3 and the previously parameters, excepting for lymphocyte counts (P = 0.0022, Fig 7). These data reinforce that circulating CXCL9 and CXCL10 levels mirror tissue IFN\u03b3 activity and, importantly, disease parameters in blood.",

From 20 blood samples obtained at different times during active sHLH disease, IFN\u03b3 levels significantly correlated with levels of CXCL9 and, to a lesser extent, of CXCL10 (Fig 8\nB). We also investigated the correlation of circulating levels for IFN\u03b3, CXCL9, and CXCL10, with laboratory parameters of sHLH including neutrophil and platelet counts, ferritin, lactate dehydrogenase, and alanine transaminase levels. We found that blood CXCL9 levels were significantly correlated with all the 5 laboratory parameters studied (Fig 8\nD). IFN\u03b3 and CXCL10 levels were also significantly correlated with the previously mentioned disease parameters, with the exception being between IFN\u03b3 and platelet counts (Fig 8\nC), and CXCL10 and ferritin levels (Fig 8\nE), not reaching significance. Taken together, our findings in patients further suggest the pathogenic role for IFN\u03b3 in sHLH and advocate the use of blood levels for CXCL9 and CXCL10 as potential biomarkers of IFN\u03b3 activity in sHLH.",

However, as the high-affinity receptor for IFN\u03b3 is ubiquitously expressed,33 facilitating a rapid elimination of the cytokine at sites of production, we hypothesized that the measured concentration of IFN\u03b3 in the blood is a poor indicator of the true quantity being produced. Indeed, our results support the notion that what is measured in blood can be considered as spillover from events occurring in tissues that have succumbed to hyperinflammation.1, 34, 35, 36 Adapting a method that exploits the ability of the anti-mouse IFN\u03b3 mAb, XMG1.2, to capture IFN\u03b3 present in organs and mobilize it as an immune complex into the blood compartment,32 we observed a rapid and dramatic increase in IFN\u03b3 above basal levels after the first CpG-ODN injection. Subsequent TLR9 stimulation resulted in incremental increases of total IFN\u03b3 levels, finally reaching steady-state concentrations 169-fold higher than those measured in mice under homeostatic conditions. Importantly, the ability of XMG1.2 to infiltrate organs was demonstrated by the abrogation in tissues of CIITA pIV expression (an IFN\u03b3-inducible gene) and the diminished de novo transcription of CXCL9 and CXCL10 in the liver corresponding to the rapid disappearance of these IFN\u03b3-inducible chemokines from the blood. These alterations in proteins regulated by IFN\u03b3 reinforce the notion that the source of the hypercytokinemia observed in sHLH occurs at the organ level. In addition, the results infer that cytokine levels detected in blood may fail to reflect the true magnitude of total cytokine production occurring in the body. This phenomenon is also exemplified in severe infections affecting the respiratory tract (eg, avian influenza or severe primary influenza virus infections), where the inflammatory cascade leading to hypercytokinemia and consequent immunopathology occurs in the deep tissues.1\n",

However, the authors concluded that some disease parameters, leukopenia and hyperferritinemia, were IFN\u03b3-independent. Here, we demonstrated that the neutralization of IFN\u03b3 in organs controlled the hypercytokinemia and ameliorated the laboratory and clinical sHLH parameters in this mouse model including body weight loss, anemia, lymphopenia, hyperferrinitinemia, splenomegaly, and hepatic inflammation. We and others have shown that a range of 30\u2013100 mg/kg of XMG1.2 is required to achieve a therapeutic benefit in a mouse model of pHLH, where perforin-deficient mice are infected with LCMV.30, 31 Our data help to explain the observation that when a lower dose of XMG1.2 (ie, 8 mg/kg) was administered in an alternative HLH model, involving perforin-deficient mice infected with mouse cytomegalovirus,37 it was not possible to significantly alter the disease. Taken together, these results underline how the local hyper-production of IFN\u03b3 drives the organ pathology, triggering inflammation and tissue damage, and ultimately disseminating systemically.",

            "text": "Others have shown that serum peaks of IFN\u03b3 after CpG injections, although modest, suggested an important role for this cytokine in driving tissue pathology seen in CpG-treated mice.16 Nonetheless, using IFN\u03b3 as a blood biomarker is complicated by the fact that the cytokine is rapidly catabolized and, or used in tissues. This limitation was addressed in our study by demonstrating that blood levels of the chemokines, CXCL9, and CXCL10, which are directly induced by IFN\u03b3, were altered and correlated with HLH parameters including thrombocytopenia, hyperferritinemia, and lymphopenia. These abundantly produced chemokines serve as biomarkers for IFN\u03b3 activity in mouse organs. The clinical importance of this finding was borne out by the translation of these observations to pediatric patients with sHLH where high levels of IFN\u03b3, CXCL9, and CXCL10 were detected in blood from patients with active disease. Although infections were demonstrable in only half of the patients, it is well known that the infectious trigger may not always be apparent at time of HLH diagnosis.38 Moreover, since the patients studied did not have mutations in known genes causing HLH, had normal CD107 degranulation, as well as perforin expression and NK cytotoxicity, did not experience HLH reactivation, and had a negative family history, it is highly unlikely that any patient with pHLH was included in the analysis. Our findings that sHLH patients with active disease have high circulating levels of IFN\u03b3 extend the data reported by Xu et al.39 Although they did not report levels of IFN\u03b3 specifically in patients with sHLH, they found high levels of IFN\u03b3 in a population of HLH patients comprising a relevant portion (ie, 50%) with documented infections. Moreover, our data show that levels of CXCL9 and, to a lesser extent CXCL10, in the blood correlated to those measured for IFN\u03b3. As in the mouse model of sHLH, increased levels of CXCL9 correlated with several laboratory parameters of disease severity.",

Although IFN\u03b3 levels have been monitored in patients with sHLH, our observations support this cytokine as key driver of hypercytokenimia in HLH and advocate the use of CXCL9 and CXCL10 levels as biomarkers of IFN\u03b3 activity. We therefore anticipate that ongoing efforts investigating the blockade of IFN\u03b3 in patients with pHLH will ultimately support this strategy as a therapeutic approach in secondary forms of the disease.",
