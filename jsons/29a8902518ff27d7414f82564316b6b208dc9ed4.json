Although the close phylogenetic relation of human MERS-CoV isolates initially suggested bats as a putative natural reservoir [3] , there is increasing evidence that dromedary camels serve as the primary source of MERS-CoV infection in humans [4] . MERS-CoV sequences have been identified in dromedary camels' nasal secretions [5, 6] , but also in raw milk samples of infected animals [7] . There is serologic evidence for MERS-CoV infection in camels and calves from various regions in the Middle East and beyond [8] [9] [10] . Isolated viruses are matching to a high degree to the genomes of the human MERS-CoV [11] , and phenotypic characterization of viruses revealed that cell tropism and replication kinetics/competence of human and dromedary MERS-CoV are similar [12] . Recently, virus replication and shedding was confirmed in the upper respiratory tract of experimentally infected camels [13] .",

This raised important questions: Was this a real increase in cases or simply a surveillance artefact due to reporting of false positives or a change in surveillance practice with a more sensitive case detection? Was this increase caused by an increased number of new introductions from the natural reservoir and/or did this increase indicate a breach in infection control measures that allowed increased nosocomial transmission?

Nosocomial transmission is a particular risk factor for international spread, especially if exposure in healthcare settings is more likely than exposure through enzootic contact. The large outbreaks of MERS-CoV in Jeddah and Riyadh have stressed the importance of infection control strategies and practices, not only when caring for suspected MERS-CoV patients, but for overall patient care. Identification of the specific factors that facilitate transmission in the healthcare setting will be key to inform measures for interruption of transmission as shown with SARS [24] . Up to now, no sustained human-to-human spread has been shown for MERS-CoV in the community setting. The role of super-spreading of MERS-CoV in the hospital setting, however, remains to be further elucidated. In the SARS outbreak in 2003, super-spreading events accounted for >70% of the cases, with SARS-CoV being moderately transmissible [25] .",
