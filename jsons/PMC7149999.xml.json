            "text": "During the time of the waste sites closure, Niagara Falls experienced rapid economic expansion and rapid population growth to a point where it exceeded growing by 33 percent in a space of 20 years ranging from 1940 to 1960 from 78,020 to 102,394 [31], [32]. Land for development of new schools was required by the Niagara Falls City School District. Subsequently, the school district made an attempt to buy the land which was used to bury toxic waste from Hooker Chemical. The attempt was disallowed due to the associated safety issues. Despite this, the school district remained persistent [31], [32]. After a period of time, Hooker Chemical was faced with parts of property being issued with condemnation and expropriation, and so they settled with selling the property but only provided the school district bought the entire property for one dollar. As a means of ensuring the school district knew what the potential consequences and risks associated with signing the deed and then owning the property were, Hooker Chemical, using their own expenditure conducted borehole tests on site with members of the school district as observers. Moreover, Hooker Chemical made sure the school district understood how unsuitable the site was for what the school district itself had planned. Regardless of that, the school district had no interest in making adjustments to their plans. Furthermore, on April 28, 1953, the agreement of selling this property to the school district was made, and in addition Hooker Chemical included a seventeen-line warning regarding the threats and risks of building on the property. In doing so, Hooker Chemical were assured they were no longer going to be affected by the legal issues associated with the consequences linked to the aforementioned threats and risks that could arise in the future [31], [32]. \u201cPrior to the delivery of this instrument of conveyance, the grantee herein has been advised by the grantor that the premises described above have been filled, in whole or in part, to the present grade level thereof with waste products resulting from the manufacturing of chemicals by the grantor at its plant in the City of Niagara Falls, New York, and the grantee assumes all risk and liability incident to the use thereof. It is therefore understood and agreed that, as a part of the consideration for this conveyance and as a condition thereof, no claim, suit, action or demand of any nature whatsoever shall ever be made by the grantee, its successors or assigns, against the grantor, its successors or assigns, for injury to a person or persons, including death resulting there from, or loss of or damage to property caused by, in connection with or by reason of the presence of said industrial wastes. It is further agreed as a condition hereof that each subsequent conveyance of the aforesaid lands shall be made subject to the foregoing provisions and conditions.\u201d",

            "text": "Regardless of this clause, the school district proceeded with construction of the \u201c99th Street School\u201d where it was initially intended for location. In January 1954, the school's architect informed that education committee that during excavation, workers found two dump-sites containing 55-US-gallon (210 l; 46 imp gal) drums of chemical wastes. Additionally, the architect said it would be an inadequate approach to build on the property because it was not known what wastes existed below ground, and so there could have been potential damage to the concrete foundation [31], [32], [33], [34], [35]. Accordingly, the school district moved the site for development, about eighty to eighty-five feet further north [31], [32], [33], [34], [35]. Moreover, relocation was also given to the kindergarten playground, as it was directly above a chemical dump. In 1955, the development was complete, allowing 400 children placement in the school. This occurred along with openings of a number of other schools which were developed for other students. Within the same year, a twenty-five-foot area fell apart, exposing harmful chemical drums. These drums filled with water after occurrences of rain events. The children saw this an opportunity to be playful in large puddles of water [31], [32], [33], [34], [35]. Still in 1955, a second school opened six blocks away. Later in 1957, the City of Niagara Falls developed sewers systems for single-family and low-income residents. This was developed on lands neighboring the landfill site. Furthermore, the remaining property was sold off by the school district, and so homes were to be developed by private housing developers as well as the Niagara Falls Housing Authority, whose plan was to build the Griffon Manor housing project. During construction of gravel sewer beds, construction teams reached the protective clay seal which penetrated the canal walls [31], [32], [33], [34], [35]. The local government took parts of the protective clay layer for use as fill dirt for the 93rd Street School. Moreover, they pierced holes into the clay walls for development of water lines and the LaSalle Expressway. This made it possible for the toxic waste to seep out when rainwater was no longer restricted from entering the partly removed clay layer. This eventually led to movement of the toxic waste particles through the generated pierced holes of the clay walls [32], [33], [34], [35]. Essentially, this promoted the built material to migrate from the canal. Furthermore, the property on which homes were built was not within the agreement between the school district and Hooker Chemical, and therefore none the home residents knew the canal's history [32], [33], [34], [35]. No monitoring or evaluation was given to the waste stored beneath the ground. To add, the clay layer covering the canal which was intended to be impermeable began to break [32], [33], [34], [35]. On the other hand, construction of the LaSalle Expressway constricted groundwater flow to the Niagara River, and as a result in 1962 when there was a wet winter and spring, the expressway caused the breached canal to overflow with water. In addition, people started reporting about oil and colored liquid puddles on their properties and within their basements.",

            "text": "In 1976, David Pollak and David Russell, two reporters for the Niagara Falls Gazette, tested a number of sump pumps near to Love Canal, whereby the findings showed evidence of toxic chemicals. These findings were kept on the down low, and then in early 1978, Michael Brown, who was also a reporter, investigated the potential health effects by means of carrying an informal door-to-door survey. He found birth defects and several anomalies, of which enlarged feet, heads, hands, and legs were included. Thereafter, he gave advice to local residents to initiate a protest group which was under the leadership of Karen Schroeder, whose daughter had these birth defects. The New York State Health Department went with the same pattern and found an irregular frequency of miscarriages. Consequently, the dumpsite was proclaimed a phenomenal state crisis on August 2, 1978. Furthermore, Michael Brown who wrote numerous articles regarding the dump, tested the groundwater and later found the dump to be three times bigger than initially suspected, with conceivable implications past the first evacuation zone. Additionally, he found evidence of highly toxic dioxins. Lois Gibbs, a neighborhood mother had a son Michael Gibbs who started school in September 1977 and developed epilepsy about three months thereafter. He started suffering from asthma and a urinary tract infection, as well as a decrease in white blood cells. This was all related to his exposure to the leaked chemical waste. Later Lois Gibbs found out that the neighborhood in which she resided had buried chemical waste beneath it [32], [33], [34], [35]. On August 2, 1978, she called a decision to head the Love Canal Homeowners' Association, and started rallying home owners [32], [33], [34], [35]. In the following years, Gibbs directed effort in investigating the neighborhood's worries about the residents' health. Gibbs along with other residents made frequent complaints about unusual smells and \u201csubstances\u201d found on their properties. Gibbs' neighborhood had a high rate of unexplained ailments, miscarriages, and mental illnesses [32], [33], [34], [35]. Moreover, the basements of some homes were covered in thick black substances and vegetation started dying out. To add, on some home owner properties, only shrubby grasses was found to grow [32], [33], [34], [35]. Despite asking city officials to investigate the area, the issue was not solved. Moreover, Michael O'Laughlin, mayor of Niagara Falls, disgracefully indicated that nothing was wrong in Love Canal. Based on the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in 1979, residents showed a \u201cdisturbingly high rate of miscarriages ... Love Canal can now be added to a growing list of environmental disasters involving toxic, ranging from industrial workers stricken by nervous disorders and cancers to the discovery of toxic materials in the milk of nursing mothers.\u201d There was a case where one Love Canal family had two of their four children having birth defects. To expand, a young girl was conceived deaf with a cleft palate, an additional row of teeth and a bit retarded; and a boy was with a deficit in his eye [32], [33], [34], [35]. Initially, scientific studies were not very convincing in proving the chemicals were the cause of the residents' illnesses. Moreover, even though eleven known or assumed cancer causing chemicals were identified, in which a predominant chemical was benzene, scientists remained at odds with this issue. Dioxin (polychlorinated dibenzodioxin), a very dangerous substance, was also found in the water. Dioxin is measured in parts per trillion, and for the Love Canal, water samples appeared to have as much as 53 parts per billion [32], [33], [34], [35]. Geologists were appointed for determining whether the chemicals found in residential areas were caused by underground swales. It was concluded that chemicals could seep into residents' basements as well as evaporate into the atmosphere of homes. Later in 1979, the EPA gave an announcement regarding the blood test results of residents in Love Canal. The results gave indication of a high presence of white blood cells which was a sign of leukemia [35], [36], [37] and damaged chromosomes. In actual fact, 33% of the residents were associated with damaged chromosomes, and this was significant because generally a 1% of the population have chromosomal damage [35], [36], [37]. In other studies which were conducted, no harm was found [32], [33], [34], [35], [36], [37]. Furthermore, in 1991, the United States National Research Council (NRC) carried out a survey on the Love Canal's health studies. They found that the major issue concerned groundwater and not drinking water because groundwater migrated into basements and then was exposed through the atmosphere and soil [35], [36], [37]. It was found that many of the studies made reports that residents exposed to this were associated with significantly lower weights in newborn babies and birth defects [35], [36], [37]. There was evidence that the harmful and unwanted effects decreased when there was no exposure [35], [36], [37]. The NRC additionally found a study indicating exposed children were associated with \u201cexcess of seizures, learning problems, hyperactivity, eye irritation, skin rashes, abdominal pain, and incontinence\u201d and stunted growth [27], [35], [36]. Furthermore, research was done on voles which are small rodents, in which it was found that their mortality significantly increased in comparison to controls (mean life expectancy in exposed animals \u201c23.6 and 29.2 days, respectively, compared to 48.8 days\u201d for control animals) [35], [36], [37]. To add, there is also an ongoing health study regarding the canal residents, by the New York State [35], [36], [37], [38]. Still in the same year, the Albert Elia Building Co., Inc., now known as Sevenson Environmental Services, Inc., have appointed principal contractor to safe re-burying of the harmful waste at the Love Canal. In the end, the government called for relocation of more than 800 families and gave reimbursement for their homes. The United States Congress passed the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA), or the Superfund Act, due to the Superfund Act containing a \u201cretroactive liability\u201d provision. Furthermore, although the cleanup of the waste was governed by U.S laws in 1994 when the disposal was made, Occidental was held liable. John Curtin, a Federal District Judge, stated Hooker Chemical/Occidental was negligent but not reckless in their approach to handle the waste and sell the property to the Niagara Falls School District [35], [36], [37], [38]. In addition, Curtin's decision contained an in-depth history of occasions paving the way to the Love Canal catastrophe. Finally, the EPA sued Occidental Petroleum who in 1995 agreed to pay $129 million in restitution [35], [36], [37], [38]. Finally, during the years which followed, settlement of the residents' lawsuits was achieved.",

            "text": "We present in this section some sources of groundwater pollution.\u2022\nStorage Tanks: May contain gasoline, oil, chemicals, or other types of liquids and they can either be above or below ground. There are estimated to be over 10 million storage tanks buried in the United States and over time the tanks can corrode, crack, and develop leaks. If the contaminants leak out and get into the groundwater, serious contamination can occur.\u2022\nSeptic Systems: On-site wastewater disposal systems used by homes, offices or other purpose arrangements that are not connected to a city sewer system. Septic systems are designed to slowly drain away human waste underground at a slow, harmless rate. An improperly designed, located, constructed, or maintained septic system can leak bacteria, viruses, household chemicals, and other contaminants into the groundwater causing serious problems.\u2022\nUncontrolled Hazardous Waste: In many developed countries around the world, more precisely in the United State of America today, there are thought to be over 20,000 known abandoned and uncontrolled hazardous waste sites and the numbers grow every year. Hazardous waste sites can lead to groundwater contamination if there are barrels or other containers laying around that are full of hazardous materials. If there is a leak, these contaminants can eventually make their way down through the soil and into the groundwater.\u2022\nLandfills: Landfills are the places where our garbage is taken to be buried. Landfills are supposed to have a protective bottom layer to prevent contaminants from getting into the water. However, if there is no such layer or it is cracked, contaminants from the landfill (car battery acid, paint, household cleaners, etc.) can make their way down into the groundwater.\u2022\nChemicals and Road Salts: The widespread use of chemicals and road salts is another source of potential groundwater contamination. Chemicals include products used on lawns and farm fields to kill weeds and insects and to fertilize plants, and other products used in homes and businesses. When it rains, these chemicals can seep into the ground and eventually into the water. Road salts are used in the wintertime to melt ice on roads to keep cars from sliding around. When the ice melts, the salt gets washed off the roads and eventually ends up in the water.\n\u2022\nAtmospheric Contaminants: Since groundwater is part of the hydrologic cycle, contaminants in other parts of the cycle, such as the atmosphere or bodies of surface water, can eventually be transferred into our groundwater supplies.\n",

            "text": "Contaminants found in groundwater cover a broad range of physical, inorganic chemical, organic chemical, bacteriological, and radioactive parameters. Principally, many of the same pollutants that play a role in surface water pollution may also be found in polluted groundwater, although their respective importance may differ. The following types can therefore be classified:\u2022\nPathogens contained in human or animal feces can lead to groundwater pollution when they are given the opportunity to reach the groundwater, making it unsafe for drinking. Of the four pathogen types that are present in feces (bacteria, viruses, protozoa, and helminths or helminth eggs), the first three can be commonly found in polluted groundwater, whereas the relatively large helminth eggs are usually filtered out by the soil matrix. Groundwater that is contaminated with pathogens can lead to fatal fecal-oral transmission of diseases, for instance, cholera, diarrhoea [39]. If the local hydrogeological conditions which can vary within a space of a few square kilometers are ignored, pit latrines can cause significant public health risks via contaminated groundwater.\u2022\nVolatile organic compounds. Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are a dangerous contaminant of groundwater. They are generally introduced to the environment through careless industrial practices. Many of these compounds were not known to be harmful until the late 1960s and it was some time before regular testing of groundwater identified these substances in drinking water sources.\u2022\nNitrate. The issue of nitrate pollution in groundwater from pit latrines, which has led to numerous cases of \u201cblue baby syndrome\u201d in children, notably in rural countries such as Romania and Bulgaria [40]. Nitrate levels above 10 mg/L (10 ppm) in groundwater can cause \u201cblue baby syndrome\u201d (acquired methemoglobinemia) [40], [41]. Nitrate can also enter the groundwater via excessive use of fertilizers, including manure. This is because only a fraction of the nitrogen-based fertilizers are converted to produce and other plant matter. The remainder accumulates in the soil or gets lost as runoff [41], [42]. High application rates of nitrogen-containing fertilizers combined with the high water-solubility of nitrate lead to increased runoff into surface water as well as leaching into groundwater, thereby causing groundwater pollution [42], [43], [44]. The excessive use of nitrogen-containing fertilizers (be they synthetic or natural) is particularly damaging, as much of the nitrogen that is not taken up by plants is transformed into nitrate which is easily leached [43], [44]. The nutrients, especially nitrates, in fertilizers can cause problems of natural habitats and of human health if they are washed off soil into watercourses or leached through soil into groundwater.\u2022\nArsenic. In the Ganges Plain of northern India and Bangladesh severe contamination of groundwater by naturally occurring arsenic affects 25% of water wells in the shallower of two regional aquifers. The pollution occurs because aquifer sediments contain organic matter that generates anaerobic conditions in the aquifer. These conditions result in the microbial dissolution of iron oxides in the sediment and, thus, the release of the arsenic, normally strongly bound to iron oxides, into the water. As a consequence, arsenic-rich groundwater is often iron-rich, although secondary processes often obscure the association of dissolved arsenic and dissolved iron.\u2022\nFluoride. In areas that have naturally occurring high levels of fluoride in groundwater which is used for drinking water, both dental and skeletal fluorosis can be prevalent and severe [45].\u2022\nOrganic. Organic pollutants can also be found in groundwater, such as insecticides and herbicides, a range of organohalides and other chemical compounds, petroleum hydrocarbons, various chemical compounds found in personal hygiene and cosmetic products, drug pollution involving pharmaceutical drugs and their metabolites. Inorganic pollutants might include ammonia, nitrate, phosphate, heavy metals, or radionuclides.\n",

            "text": "Waterborne diseases are caused by pathogenic microorganisms that most commonly are transmitted in contaminated fresh water. Infection commonly results during bathing, washing, drinking, in the preparation of food, or the consumption of food thus infected. Various forms of waterborne diarrheal diseases probably are the most prominent examples, and affect mainly children in developing countries; according to the World Health Organization, such diseases account for an estimated 4.1% of the total daily global burden of disease, and cause about 1.8 million human deaths annually. The World Health Organization estimates that 88% of that burden is attributable to unsafe water supply, sanitation, and hygiene [46]. The term waterborne disease is reserved largely for infections that predominantly are transmitted through contact with or consumption of infected water. Trivially, many infections may be transmitted by microbes or parasites that accidentally, possibly as a result of exceptional circumstances, have entered the water, but the fact that there might be an occasional freak infection need not mean that it is useful to categorize the resulting disease as waterborne. Nor is it common practice to refer to diseases such as malaria as waterborne just because mosquitoes have aquatic phases in their life cycles, or because treating the water they inhabit happens to be an effective strategy in control of the mosquitoes that are the vectors.",

            "text": "\nMicroorganisms causing diseases that characteristically are waterborne prominently include protozoa and bacteria, many of which are intestinal parasites, or invade the tissues or circulatory system through walls of the digestive tract. Various other waterborne diseases are caused by viruses. In spite of philosophical difficulties associated with defining viruses as organisms, it is practical and convenient to regard them as microorganisms in this connection [47]. Yet other important classes of waterborne diseases are caused by metazoan parasites. Typical examples include certain Nematoda, that is to say roundworms. As an example of waterborne Nematode infections, one important waterborne nematodal disease is Dracunculiasis. It is acquired by swallowing water in which certain copepoda occur that act as vectors for the Nematoda. Anyone swallowing a copepod that happens to be infected with Nematode larvae in the genus Dracunculus becomes liable to infection. The larvae cause guinea worm disease [46], [47], [48]. Another class of waterborne metazoan pathogens are certain members of the Schistosomatidae, a family of blood flukes. They usually infect victims that make skin contact with the water [46], [47]. Blood flukes are pathogens that cause Schistosomiasis of various forms, more or less seriously affecting hundreds of millions of people worldwide [47], [48]. Long before modern studies had established the germ theory of disease, or any advanced understanding of the nature of water as a vehicle for transmitting disease, traditional beliefs had cautioned against the consumption of water, rather favoring processed beverages such as beer, wine, and tea. For example, in the camel caravans that crossed Central Asia along the Silk Road, the explorer Owen Lattimore noted, \u201cThe reason we drank so much tea was because of the bad water. Water alone, unboiled, is never drunk\u201d. There is a superstition that it causes blisters on the feet [49]. Waterborne diseases can have a significant impact on the economy, locally as well as internationally. People who are infected by a waterborne disease are usually confronted with related costs and not seldom with a huge financial burden. This is especially the case in less developed countries. The financial losses are mostly caused by, for instance, costs for medical treatment and medication, costs for transport, special food, and by the loss of manpower. Many families must even sell their land to pay for treatment in a proper hospital. On average, a family spends about 10% of the monthly households income per person infected [50]. In general, we have the following types of infections:\u2022Algal Infections, with disease: Desmodesmus Infection\u2022Viral infections, with diseases: SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome), Hepatitis A, Poliomyelitis (Polio), Polyomavirus infection.\u2022Bacterial infections, with disease: Vibrio Illness, Typhoid fever, Salmonellosis, Otitis Externa (swimmer's ear), Leptospirosis, Legionellosis (two distinct forms: Legionnaires' disease and Pontiac fever), Dysentery, M. marinum infection, E. coli Infection, Cholera, Campylobacteriosis, Botulism.\u2022Parasitic infections, with disease: Enterobiasis, Ascariasis, Coenurosis, Echinococcosis (Hydatid disease), Hymenolepiasis (Dwarf Tapeworm Infection), Fasciolopsiasis, Taeniasis, Dracunculiasis (Guinea Worm Disease), Schistosomiasis (immersion).\n\u2022Protozoal infections, with disease: Microsporidiosis, Giardiasis (fecal-oral) (hand-to-mouth), Cyclosporiasis, Cryptosporidiosis (oral), Amoebiasis (hand-to-mouth).\n",

            "text": "The convection\u2013diffusion equation can be derived in a straightforward way from the continuity equation, which states that the rate of change for a scalar quantity in a differential control volume is given by flow and diffusion into and out of that part of the system along with any generation or consumption inside the control volume:(3.1)\u2202c\u2202t+\u2207.j\u2192=R, where j\u2192 is the total flux and R is a net volumetric source for c. There are two sources of flux in this situation. First, diffusive flux arises due to diffusion. This is typically approximated by Fick's first law:(3.2)j\u2192diffusion=\u2212D\u2207c. The above equation means the flux of the diffusing material relative to the bulk motion in any part of the system is proportional to the local concentration gradient. Second, when there is overall convection or flow, there is an associated flux called adjective flux:(3.3)j\u2192advection=v\u2192c. The total flux (in a stationary coordinate system) is given by the sum of these two:(3.4)j\u2192=j\u2192advection+j\u2192diffusion=v\u2192c\u2212D\u2207c. Plugging into the continuity equation, we obtain:(3.5)\u2202c\u2202t+\u0394.(v\u2192c\u2212D\u2207c)=R which is the model used to predict the movement of pollution within the geological formation called aquifers. In this equation the parameters involved are:\u2022\nc\nis the variable of interest (species concentration for mass transfer, temperature for heat transfer),\u2022\nD is the diffusivity (also called diffusion coefficient), such as mass diffusivity for particle motion or thermal diffusivity for heat transport,\u2022\nv\u2192 is the average velocity with which the quantity is moving. For example, in advection, c might be the concentration of salt in a river, and then v\u2192 would be the velocity of the water flow. As another example, c might be the concentration of small bubbles in a calm lake, and then v\u2192 would be the average velocity of bubbles rising towards the surface by buoyancy (see below). For multiphase flows and flows in porous media, v\u2192 is the (hypothetical) superficial velocity.\u2022\nR describes \u201csources\u201d or \u201csinks\u201d of the quantity c. For example, for a chemical species, R>0 means that a chemical reaction is creating more of the species, and R<0 means that a chemical reaction is destroying the species. For heat transport, R>0 might occur if thermal energy is being generated by friction.\u2022\u2207 represents gradient and \u2207\u22c5 represents divergence.\nUnderstanding the terms involved. The right-hand side of the equation is the sum of three contributions.\u2022The first, \u2207\u22c5(D\u2207c), describes diffusion. Imagine that c is the concentration of a chemical. When concentration is low somewhere compared to the surrounding areas (e.g. a local minimum of concentration), the substance will diffuse in from the surroundings, so the concentration will increase. Conversely, if concentration is high compared to the surroundings (e.g. a local maximum of concentration), then the substance will diffuse out and the concentration will decrease. The net diffusion is proportional to the Laplacian (or second derivative) of concentration.\u2022The second contribution, \u2212\u2207\u22c5(v\u2192c), describes convection (or advection). Imagine standing on the bank of a river, measuring the water's salinity (amount of salt) each second. Upstream, somebody dumps a bucket of salt into the river. A while later, you would see the salinity suddenly rise, then fall, as the zone of salty water passes by. Thus, the concentration at a given location can change because of the flow.\u2022The final contribution, R, describes the creation or destruction of the quantity. For example, if c is the concentration of a molecule, then R describes how the molecule can be created or destroyed by chemical reactions. R may be a function of c and of other parameters. Often there are several quantities, each with its own convection\u2013diffusion equation, where the destruction of one quantity entails the creation of another. For example, when methane burns, it involves not only the destruction of methane and oxygen but also the creation of carbon dioxide and water vapor. Therefore, while each of these chemicals has its own convection\u2013diffusion equation, they are \u201ccoupled together\u201d and must be solved as a system of simultaneous differential equations.\n\n",

A risk assessment is a systematic evaluation used to determine the potential risk posed by the detected contamination to human health and the environment under present and possible future conditions. If the risk assessment reveals that an unacceptable risk exists due to the contamination, a remedial strategy is developed to assess the problem. If corrective action is deemed necessary, the risk assessment will assist in the development of remedial strategies and goals necessary to reduce the potential risks posed at the site. The USEPA and the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) have developed comprehensive risk assessment procedures. The USEPA procedure was originally developed by the United States Academy of Sciences in 1983. It was adopted with modifications by the USEPA for use in Superfund feasibility studies and RCRA corrective measure studies [52].

            "text": "Groundwater remediation techniques span biological, chemical, and physical treatment technologies. Most ground water treatment techniques utilize a combination of technologies. Some of the biological treatment techniques include bio-augmentation, bioventing, biosparging, bioslurping, and phyto-remediation. Some chemical treatment techniques include ozone and oxygen gas injection, chemical precipitation, membrane separation, ion exchange, carbon absorption, aqueous chemical oxidation, and surfactant enhanced recovery. Some chemical techniques may be implemented using nano-materials. Physical treatment techniques include, but are not limited to, pump and treat, air sparging, and dual phase extraction. Biological treatment technologies. Within this category, we have the following well-known techniques:\u2022Bio-augmentation: If a treatability study shows no degradation (or an extended lab period before significant degradation is achieved) in contamination contained in the groundwater, then inoculation with strains known to be capable of degrading the contaminants may be helpful. This process increases the reactive enzyme concentration within the bioremediation system and subsequently may increase contaminant degradation rates over the non-augmented rates, at least initially after inoculation [53].\u2022Bioventing is an in situ remediation technology that uses microorganisms to biodegrade organic constituents in the groundwater system. Bioventing enhances the activity of indigenous bacteria and archaea and stimulates the natural in situ biodegradation of hydrocarbons by inducing air or oxygen flow into the unsaturated zone and, if necessary, by adding nutrients [54]. During bioventing, oxygen may be supplied through direct air injection into residual contamination in soil. Bioventing primarily assists in the degradation of adsorbed fuel residuals, but also assists in the degradation of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) as vapors move slowly through biologically active soil [55].\u2022Biosparging is an in situ remediation technology that uses indigenous microorganisms to biodegrade organic constituents in the saturated zone. In biosparging, air (or oxygen) and nutrients (if needed) are injected into the saturated zone to increase the biological activity of the indigenous microorganisms. Biosparging can be used to reduce concentrations of petroleum constituents that are dissolved in groundwater, adsorbed to soil below the water table, and within the capillary fringe.\u2022\nBioslurping combines elements of bioventing and vacuum-enhanced pumping of free-product that is lighter than water (light non-aqueous phase liquid or LNAPL) to recover free-product from the groundwater and soil, and to bio-remediate soils. The bioslurper system uses a \u201cslurp\u201d tube that extends into the free-product layer. Much like a straw in a glass draws liquid, the pump draws liquid (including free-product) and soil gas up the tube in the same process stream. Pumping lifts LNAPLs, such as oil, off the top of the water table and from the capillary fringe meaning an area just above the saturated zone, where water is held in place by capillary forces. The LNAPL is brought to the surface, where it is separated from water and air. The biological processes in the term \u201cbioslurping\u201d refer to aerobic biological degradation of the hydrocarbons when air is introduced into the unsaturated zone.\u2022In the phyto-remediation process certain plants and trees are planted, whose roots absorb contaminants from groundwater over time, and are harvested and destroyed. This process can be carried out in areas where the roots can tap the groundwater. Few examples of plants that are used in this process are Chinese Ladder fern Pteris vittata, also known as the brake fern, is a highly efficient accumulator of arsenic. Genetically altered cottonwood trees are good absorbers of mercury and transgenic Indian mustard plants soak up selenium well.\nChemical treatment technologies\n\u2022Chemical precipitation is commonly used in wastewater treatment to remove hardness and heavy metals. In general, the process involves addition of agent to an aqueous waste stream in a stirred reaction vessel, either batchwise or with steady flow. Most metals can be converted to insoluble compounds by chemical reactions between the agent and the dissolved metal ions. The insoluble compounds (precipitates) are removed by settling and/or filtering.\u2022Ion exchange for groundwater remediation is virtually always carried out by passing the water downward under pressure through a fixed bed of granular medium (either cation exchange media and anion exchange media) or spherical beads. Cations are displaced by certain cations from the solutions and ions are displaced by certain anions from the solution. Ion exchange media most often used for remediation are zeolites (both natural and synthetic) and synthetic resins.\u2022Carbon absorption: The most common activated carbon used for remediation is derived from bituminous coal. Activated carbon absorbs volatile organic compounds from groundwater by chemically binding them to the carbon atoms.\u2022Chemical oxidation: In this process, called In Situ Chemical Oxidation or ISCO, chemical oxidants are delivered in the subsurface to destroy (converted to water and carbon dioxide or to nontoxic substances) the organic molecules. The oxidants are introduced as either liquids or gasses. Oxidants include air or oxygen, ozone, and certain liquid chemicals such as hydrogen peroxide, permanganate and persulfate. Ozone and oxygen gas can be generated on site from air and electricity and directly injected into soil and groundwater contamination. The process has the potential to oxidize and/or enhance naturally occurring aerobic degradation. Chemical oxidation has proven to be an effective technique for dense non-aqueous phase liquid or DNAPL when it is present.\u2022Surfactant enhanced recovery increases the mobility and solubility of the contaminants absorbed to the saturated soil matrix or present as dense non-aqueous phase liquid. Surfactant-enhanced recovery injects surfactants (surface-active agents that are primary ingredient in soap and detergent) into contaminated groundwater. A typical system uses an extraction pump to remove groundwater downstream from the injection point. The extracted groundwater is treated above-ground to separate the injected surfactants from the contaminants and groundwater. Once the surfactants have separated from the groundwater they are reused. The surfactants used are non-toxic, food-grade, and biodegradable. Surfactant enhanced recovery is used most often when the groundwater is contaminated by dense non-aqueous phase liquids (DNAPLs). These dense compounds, such as trichloroethylene (TCE), sink in groundwater because they have a higher density than water. They then act as a continuous source for contaminant plumes that can stretch for miles within an aquifer. These compounds may biodegrade very slowly. They are commonly found in the vicinity of the original spill or leak where capillary forces have trapped them.\nPhysical treatment technologies\n\u2022Pump and treat is one of the most widely used groundwater remediation technologies. In this process groundwater is pumped to the surface and is coupled with either biological or chemical treatments to remove the impurities.\u2022Air sparging is the process of blowing air directly into the groundwater. As the bubbles rise, the contaminants are removed from the groundwater by physical contact with the air and are carried up into the unsaturated zone. As the contaminants move into the soil, a soil vapor extraction system is usually used to remove vapors.\u2022Dual-phase vacuum extractionDual-phase vacuum extraction (DPVE), also known as multi-phase extraction, is a technology that uses a high-vacuum system to remove both contaminated groundwater and soil vapor. In DPVE systems a high-vacuum extraction well is installed with its screened section in the zone of contaminated soils and groundwater. Fluid/vapor extraction systems depress the water table and water flows faster to the extraction well. DPVE removes contaminants from above and below the water table. As the water table around the well is lowered by pumping, unsaturated soil is exposed. This area, called the capillary fringe, is often highly contaminated, as it holds undissolved chemicals, chemicals that are lighter than water, and vapors that have escaped from the dissolved groundwater below. Contaminants in the newly exposed zone can be removed by vapor extraction. Once above ground, the extracted vapors and liquid-phase organic and groundwater are separated and treated. Use of dual-phase vacuum extraction with these technologies can shorten the cleanup time at a site, because the capillary fringe is often the most contaminated area.\u2022Monitoring-wells are often drilled for the purpose of collecting groundwater samples for analysis. These wells, which are usually six inches or fewer in diameter, can also be used to remove hydrocarbons from the contaminant plume within a groundwater aquifer by using a belt style oil skimmer. Belt oil skimmers, which are simple in design, are commonly used to remove oil and other floating hydrocarbon contaminants from industrial water systems. A monitoring-well oil skimmer remedies various oils, ranging from light fuel oils such as petrol, light diesel or kerosene to heavy products such as No. 6 oil, creosote, and coal tar. It consists of a continuously moving belt that runs on a pulley system driven by an electric motor. The belt material has a strong affinity for hydrocarbon liquids and for shedding water. The belt, which can have a vertical drop of 100+ feet, is lowered into the monitoring well past the LNAPL/water interface. As the belt moves through this interface it picks up liquid hydrocarbon contaminant, which is removed and collected at ground level as the belt passes through a wiper mechanism. To the extent that DNAPL hydrocarbons settle at the bottom of a monitoring well, and the lower pulley of the belt skimmer reaches them, these contaminants can also be removed by a monitoring-well oil skimmer. Typically, belt skimmers remove very little water with the contaminant, so simple weir type separators can be used to collect any remaining hydrocarbon liquid, which often makes the water suitable for its return to the aquifer. Because the small electric motor uses little electricity, it can be powered from solar panels or a wind turbine, making the system self-sufficient and eliminating the cost of running electricity to a remote location.\n",

They are also distinguished by the type of sensitivity measure, be it based on, for instance, variance decomposition, partial derivatives, or elementary effects. In general, however, most procedures adhere to the following outline:aQuantify the uncertainty in each input for example ranges, probability distributions. Note that this can be difficult and many methods exist to elicit uncertainty distributions from subjective data [57].bIdentify the model output to be analyzed (the target of interest should ideally have a direct relation to the problem tackled by the model).cRun the model a number of times using some design of experiments [58], dictated by the method of choice and the input uncertainty.dUsing the resulting model outputs, calculate the sensitivity measures of interest. In some cases this procedure will be repeated; for example, in high-dimensional problems, where the user has to screen out unimportant variables before performing a full sensitivity analysis, we present some approaches used for sensibility analysis starting with the best one. One-at-a-time approach is that of changing one-factor-at-a-time (OFAT or OAT), to see what effect this produces on the output [59], [60], [61].

            "text": "Sensitivity may then be measured by monitoring changes in the output, for example by partial derivatives or linear regression. This appears a logical approach as any change observed in the output will unambiguously be due to the single variable changed. Furthermore, by changing one variable at a time, one can keep all other variables fixed to their central or baseline values. This increases the comparability of the results (all effects are computed with reference to the same central point in space) and minimizes the chances of computer programme crashes, more likely when several input factors are changed simultaneously. OAT is frequently preferred by modelers because of practical reasons. In case of model failure under OAT analysis the modelers immediately know which is the input factor responsible for the failure [59], [60], [61].\u2022\nScreening method. Screening is a particular instance of a sampling-based method. The objective here is rather to identify which input variables are contributing significantly to the output uncertainty in high-dimensionality models, rather than exactly quantifying sensitivity, that is to say, in terms of variance. Screening tends to have a relatively low computational cost when compared to other approaches, and can be used in a preliminary analysis to weed out uninfluential variables before applying a more informative analysis to the remaining set [62], [63]. One of the most commonly used screening methods is the elementary effect method.\u2022\nScatter plots method. A simple but useful tool is to plot scatter plots of the output variable against individual input variables, after randomly sampling the model over its input distributions. The advantage of this approach is that it can also deal with \u201cgiven data,\u201d implying a set of arbitrarily-placed data points, and gives a direct visual indication of sensitivity. Quantitative measures can also be drawn, for example, by measuring the correlation between Y and Xi, or even by estimating variance-based measures by nonlinear regression [64].\u2022\nRegression analysis, in the context of sensitivity analysis, involves fitting a linear regression to the model response and using standardized regression coefficients as direct measures of sensitivity. The regression is required to be linear with respect to the data like a hyperplane, hence with no quadratic terms, and so on, as regressors because otherwise it is difficult to interpret the standardized coefficients. This method is therefore most suitable when the model response is in fact linear; linearity can be confirmed, for instance, if the coefficient of determination is large. The advantages of regression analysis are that it is simple and has a low computational cost [65], [66].\u2022\nLocal methods. Local methods involve taking the partial derivative of the output Y with respect to an input factor Xi:(3.12)|\u2202Y\u2202Xi|x0, where the subscript X0 indicates that the derivative is taken at some fixed point in the space of the input, hence the local in the name of the class. Adjoint modeling and Automated Differentiation are methods in this class [65], [66].\u2022\nVariance-based method. Variance-based methods [67], [68], [69] are a class of probabilistic approaches which quantify the input and output uncertainties as probability distributions, and decompose the output variance into parts attributable to input variables and combinations of variables. The sensitivity of the output to an input variable is therefore measured by the amount of variance in the output caused by that input. These can be expressed as conditional expectations; that is to say, considering a model Y=f(X) for X=X1,X2,...Xk, a measure of sensitivity of the ith variable Xi is given as(3.13)VarXi(EX\u223ci(Y|Xi)) where \u201cVar\u201d and \u201cE\u201d denote the variance and expected value operators respectively, and Xi denotes the set of all input variables except Xi. This expression essentially measures the contribution Xi alone to the uncertainty (variance) in Y (averaged over variations in other variables), and is known as the first-order sensitivity index or main effect index. Importantly, it does not measure the uncertainty caused by interactions with other variables [67], [68], [69]. A further measure, known as the total effect index, gives the total variance in Y caused by Xi and its interactions with any of the other input variables. Both quantities are typically standardized by dividing by Var(Y)\n[67], [68], [69]. These methods allow full exploration of the input space, accounting for interactions, and nonlinear responses. For these reasons they are widely used when it is feasible to calculate them. Typically this calculation involves the use of Monte Carlo methods, but since this can involve many thousands of model runs, other methods such as emulators can be used to reduce computational expense when necessary. Note that full variance decomposition is only meaningful when the input factors are independent from one another [67], [68], [69].",

Despite its simplicity, however, this approach does not fully explore the input space, since it does not take into account the simultaneous variation of input variables. This means that the OAT approach cannot detect the presence of interactions between input variables. Local method. Similar to OAT/OFAT, local methods do not attempt to fully explore the input space, since they examine small perturbations, typically one variable at a time. Variance based-method. It is designed to test against any and all alternatives to the null hypothesis and thus may be suboptimal for testing against a specific hypothesis. It is optimal when losses are proportional to the square of the differences among the unknown population means, but may not be optimal otherwise. For example, when losses are proportional to the absolute values of the differences among the unknown population means, expected losses would be minimized via a test that makes use of the absolute values of the differences among the sample means. It is designed for use when the observations are drawn from a normal distribution and though it is remarkably robust, it may not yield exact p-values when the observations come from distributions that are heavier in the tails than the normal. Even in cases when the analysis of variance yields almost exact p-values, it may be less powerful than the corresponding permutation test when the observations are drawn from non-normal distributions under the alternative. Scatter plots method. One major limitation of scatter-plots is that they are most effective with small numbers of dimensions, as increasing the dimensionality results in decreasing the screen space provided for each projection. Strategies for addressing this limitation include using three dimensions per plot or providing panning or zooming mechanisms. Other limitations include being generally restricted to orthogonal views and difficulties in discovering relationships which span more than two dimensions. Advantages of scatter-plots include ease of interpretation and relative insensitivity to the size of the data set.",
