Further strategies discussed are opossum attack, double parasitism (doubling of the normal reproductive set), duplex arrangement (separated male-female pairs), simple rebrooding, and describing how displaced parasites and superinfections may partly elucidate life cycles. Proportional stunting masks life history effects of parasitism; cuckoo copepods are true parasites and not just associates; burrowing barnacles (acrothoracicans) are not parasites. Further findings based on life cycle information: branchiurans and pentastomes are possibly not related; firefly seed shrimp are not parasites; copepod pre-adult life cycle stages are common in the western pacific but rare in Caribbean; harpacticoids on vertebrates are not parasites; cuckoo copepods are true parasites; explained the importance of pennellid intermediate hosts. Crustacean parasite life cycles are largely unknown (1% of species). Most crustacean life cycles represent minor modifications from the ancestral freeliving mode. Crustacean parasites have less complex and less modified life cycles than other major parasite groups. This limits their exploitation of, and effectiveness, in parasitism. However, these life cycles will be an advantage in Global Change. Most metazoan parasites will be eliminated while crustaceans (and nematodes) will inherit the new world of parasites.",

Carlson et al. (2017 and references) considered that conservation of parasites is essential to maintain the diversity in major ecosystems, particularly during global climate change. Because parasites are typically small and cryptic and often infect multiple hosts and/or host species during their life cycle, unravelling the life cycles of even a small percentage of parasite species has proven to be challenging. Indeed, while life cycles and life histories have been extensively investigated for a small number of model species (mostly species that impact the health of humans and/or plants and animals of economic importance to humans), we know virtually nothing about the vast majority of species.",

Most non-fish infections appear to be incidental or accidental, but Poly (2003) described a species from a Mexican salamander. Because of their temporary association with hosts, they may more appropriately be referred to as 'micropredators' (e.g. Lafferty and Kuris 2002) ; however, we feel that serial parasites 1 * is more appropriate. Much of the interest in this group stems from their negative effects on aquaculture and aquarium fishes (Lafferty et al. 2015) and vector fish viral diseases (M\u00f8ller 2015) . The Japanese fish louse, Argulus japonicus Thiele, 1900, is probably the most famous and has been spread around the world with cyprinids (Bunkley- Williams and Williams 1994) . However, the common fish louse, Argulus foliaceus (Linnaeus, 1758), is also widespread, and occurs from fresh to marine waters (M\u00f8ller 2015) . In two cases, these parasites have infected humans. Hargis (1958) found Argulus laticauda Smith, 1873, in the eye orbit of a child in Virginia; and an argulid has also been observed in the orbit of a tilapia aquaculturalist in Venezuela (Williams and Bunkley-Williams, personal observation) .",

            "text": "The life cycles of only~20 branchiuran species have been examined, mostly in Argulus M\u00fcller, 1785, and a few species of Dolops Audouin, 1837. Most males transfer sperm directly to the females using a variety of modified structures on the third and fourth thoracic legs; however, in Dolops, sperm are transferred in chitinous spermatophores. Sperm morphology originally linked fish lice with tongue worms (see Sect. 5.3) . Molecular evidence also supports their similarities. Only the life cycle of Argulus is well known (Poly 2008; Neethling and Avenant-Oldewage 2016) , and no life cycles of marine species are known. A mature female Argulus leaves its host and lays eggs in rows on a hard, submerged surface ( Fig. 5.1 ). As many as 1200 eggs are laid at any one time and are cemented to the substrate. The eggs hatch 12-80 days later, varying by species and water temperature. Eggs hatch into (1) free-swimming metanauplius-like larvae (7 species of Argulus), (2) freeswimming juvenile-like larvae (4 Argulus, 2 Dolops) or (3) non-swimming larvae (6 Chonopeltis Thiele, 1900). The three larval stages (above) moult into secondstage juveniles, which are parasitic and repeatedly change hosts (serial parasite). The 8-12 stages before the adult are also parasitic and host-hopping*. The maxillule undergoes a profound metamorphosis around the fifth stage, changing from a long limb bearing a powerful distal claw, into a short but powerful circular sucker (Martin et al. 2014 ). This is a remarkable transformation. M\u00f8ller et al. (2007) described swimming and self-cleaning in the hatching, free-swimming stage and the subsequent juvenile stages of Argulus foliaceus. Wilson (1904) and reproduced with permission from Benz and Bullard (2004) . Mature adults copulate on or off the host, and gravid females will then swim and find hard inanimate objects (such as stones, walls, equipment, etc.) on which to deposit eggs. Hatching times vary according to temperatures and can take from weeks to months to occur. Once hatched, infective larvae will search for a host, attach to the suitable host, and undergo multiple moults before reaching maturation. Image modified from Benz and Bullard (2004) Neither larvae, nor juveniles, nor adult Chonopeltis can swim and are therefore referred to here as 'Non-swimming fish lice*'. Adults leave the host, mate, and deposit eggs, and how, or if, they return to a host is unknown. They have seven to eight free-living, developmental stages and are said to have intermediate hosts, but, as in other fish lice, these are really transfer hosts*. All host infection and reinfection are through host contact with the bottom. Intermediate hosts are small, bottomdwelling fishes, and the definitive hosts are larger, bottom-dwelling fishes (Grundlingh 1996) . How they infect or attach to hosts is still unknown, possibly only floating to a new host (Fryer 1961; Piasecki and Avenant-Oldewage 2008) .",

            "text": "Few parasite embryos have ever had mutualistic symbionts, but Banerjee et al. (2016) have found one. A rotifer, Philodina roseola Ehrenberg, 1832, feeds off the jelly coat of the egg strips of Argulus bengalensis Ramakrishna, 1951 . This makes the coating thin enough for larvae to break out. If the rotifer does not feed, the larvae cannot emerge. They suggested this knowledge of the life cycle could afford parasite control. Van As and Van As (2015) found adult and larvae Chonopeltis lisikili Van As & Van As, 1996, on the same host specimens and suggested host-change does not occur in C. lisikili, as was reported for other Chonopeltis spp. These stages, and freeswimming adults, are attracted by bright objects, light, and motion, as Mikheev et al. (2015) demonstrated in aquarium studies. In daylight, the parasite employed hoverand-wait tactics with low swimming speed and an inclined position of the body. In the dark, cruising tactics were employed, characterised by a much higher swimming speed and a horizontal position of the body. Vision, olfaction and mechanoreception are used in daylight, whereas only the latter two are used at night. Swimming speed was 5-6 times greater at night than in the daylight. Host-induced cues increased mean swimming speed by a factor of 1.5-3. In adults starved for 1-2 days, the swimming speed was 3-4 times greater than those freshly detached from the host. A longer starvation caused a decrease in swimming activity (Mikheev et al. 2015) . Mikheev et al. (2015) found receptive females largely rested on hosts and attracted free-swimming males with pheromones. They also found females deposit eggs in fish spawning or nursery areas, where their offspring will have access to many fish. Mikheev et al. (2015) suggested fish lice manipulate the behaviour of hosts for their benefit: (1) when one attaches to a fish, the host reaction attracts other lice; (2) injuring a host by attacking it may cause a predator-attack tightening of a school, favouring more parasite attachment. However, these effects seem too inadvertent, reactive, and temporal, to be called parasite-induced host behavioural changes. They do not help the individual parasite causing the reaction, possibly even harming it, similar to a positive precursor. They are certainly nothing like the host behaviour changes such as found in parasitic barnacles. Mikheev et al. (2015) also suggested microbial pathogens were changing the behaviour of hosts and fish lice to spread their infection. They found 'sick' fish had more fish lice and stated that the parasites vector these diseases (see Chap. 7). Banerjee's et al. (2016) mutualistic rotifer has obviously co-evolved with Argulus bengalensis. We suggest that at one point, the rotifer appears to have been a hyperparasite (many in its genus are parasites) or predator harming the egg strip. The parasite gradually thickened the coating on its egg strip, protecting it from the rotifer. Finally, the embryos were sufficiently protected, to turn the rotifer into a mutualist, and the organisms became inexorably linked. Our suggestion is that this is first evidence of a hyperparasite evolving into a mutualist.",

Their phylogenetic relationship was once mysterious because they only have reduced parasitic morphologies. Until recently, no fossil forms (~0.5 billion years ago) were known. Molecular work has suggested a relation to fish lice (e.g. Li et al. 2016 and references) , although this is still debated. Williams (1995) suggested that these parasites were important and were once parasites of dinosaurs since the remaining species parasitise many extant close relatives of dinosaurs (e.g. crocodilians and birds). Bunkley- Williams and Williams (1994) found sebekid nymphs in freshwater largemouth bass and peacock bass in Puerto Rico and speculated that spectacled caiman was the final host (Williams and Britton 1995) . We now identify these nymphs as Sebekia oxycephalum (Diesing, 1836) , and they are common in Puerto Rico (Williams and Bunkley-Williams unpublished data) . reported nymphs in coral reef fishes in Okinawa and suggested the final hosts were sea snakes.",

Stored sperm fertilize ova released continuously from the ovaries of mature females. Fertilized eggs mature as they descend the uterus of porocephalids. Gravid females of Armillifer Sambon, 1922, and Linguatula Fr\u00f6lich, 1789 , species may contain millions of eggs. The eggs of cephalobaenids are stored in a saccate uterus until they contain 30-50% fully mature primary larva and are infectious; then egg deposition begins. The vagina is equipped with a sieve-like mechanism only allowing mature eggs to escape. They lay eggs in the respiratory track of vertebrates, which are either coughed or sneezed out by the host or leave the host body through the digestive system. Usually, an insect or vertebrate ingests the eggs. The larva hatches into a nymph, penetrates the intestinal wall, and forms a cyst in the intermediate host's body. The nymph is rounded in form, with 4-6 short legs. The final host is infected when it eats the intermediate host, and the nymph crawls into the respiratory tract from the oesoph agus or stomach. It moults several times to become a post-larval juvenile and finally an adult. A few species, mostly in birds, have direct life cycles. Subtriquetra subtriquetra (Diesing, 1836) , in South American crocodiles, is the only tongue worm known to have a free-swimming larva. It searches for fishes as its intermediate hosts (Winch and Riley 1986) .",

Kretzler (1984) found 5000 specimens in 218 host specimens of four species of sea urchins. He reported no damage; therefore, even heavy infections do not obviously affect hosts. Bennett et al. (1997) found 17 of 28 epaulette sharks examined had Sheina orri Harding, 1966, ostracods attached in the gills. Light and scanning electron microscopy showed ostracods were anchored to gill tissues with their mandibular and maxillular claws. They damaged host tissues and were often located in distinct pockets, formed by local distortion of shark respiratory lamellae, strongly suggesting that they had been attached to the gills for considerable time. These details were presented because of some controversy whether Sheina orri was parasitic. It has also been found in the bluespotted ribbontail ray, Skogsbergia squamosa (Mueller, 1894), and may be a bony fish parasite (Monod 1923) , but this was not clear. Wilson (1913) found 50, 50, and 12 Photeros parasitica (Wilson 1913) in the gills and nasal tubes of three smooth hammerheads, one on the gills of a rock hind, and three on a blue runner in Jamaica. hypothesised that P. parasitica was specific to sharks and rays and only accidental on bony fishes in the Caribbean. Cohen and Morin (2010) reported that P. parasitica is a luciferin bioluminescent carrion feeder, not a parasite. Brian (1931) found Cypridina sp. on the gills of dolphinfish (Coryphaena Linnaeus, 1758) and called them parasites. However, this form is another luciferin bioluminescent seed shrimp, like P. parasitica, and is unlikely to be a parasite . It is related to the famous sea firefly. Thus, 'firefly seed shrimp' do not appear to be parasites. Bioluminescent seed shrimp are sometimes reported as gill parasites because they feed on detritus, and the gills of an organism are the first part to deteriorate.",

The egg usually hatches into a nauplius larva with a small, unsegmented body, and three pairs of functional appendages (antennules, antennae and mandibles). A maximum of six naupliar stages can occur, and all six are found in most freeliving copepods and in some parasites. Nauplii may be planktotrophic (feed on plankton) or rely on its yolk (lecithotrophic). Parasitic nauplii are usually lecithotrophic, have reduced setation on the three limb pairs, and no naupliar feeding process on the coxae of the antenna. In many parasites, the naupliar phase is abbreviated or occasionally lost. The final nauplius stage moults to become the first copepodid with a segmented body, a full adult set of cephalic appendages, and the first and second swimming legs. Free-living copepods have a maximum of five copepodid stages with one body somite added at each moult. In almost all copepod parasites, copepodid I is a free-swimming stage. Only Parachordeumium aphiurae (H\u00e9rouard, 1906) and internal sea cucumber copepods have copepodid II hatching from their eggs (Martin et al. 2014 ). Copepodid I is in the typical crustacean form with two pairs of biramous swimming legs, each with 1-segmented rami. It begins free-living but is usually the infective stage. The copepodid stages provide a gradual transition from the copepodid body form to adult morphology, however transformed. In the more derived families, successive copepdid stages have increasing modifications in body form and limb structures. The fifth copepodid stage moults into an adult male or female. Following this moult, the female becomes sexually receptive.",

Their simple life cycles may inhibit them from colonising more diverse vertebrates since their only mammal parasite has their most complicated life cycle. The life strategies of copepods suggest the simpler the host, the easier it is to parasitise. reported, based on decades of research, that copepodids, chalimus, and immature adult copepods were very rare on Caribbean coral reef fishes but rather common on Western Pacific coral reef fishes (a 1-year study). One possible explanation for this difference is that Caribbean, small cleaner gobies (Elacatinus Jordan, 1904) , are much more efficient in locating and removing these small, life cycle stages than are the larger Indo-Pacific cleaner wrasses (Labroides Bleeker, 1851). Thus, life strategies of Caribbean and Indo-Pacific parasitic crustaceans may operate under quite different selective pressures. Brusca (1978) found adult cymothoid isopods of the genus Nerocila Leach, 1818, with damaged pleotelsons and uropods and speculated these injuries might represent predation by cleaner fishes. Williams and Williams (unpublished data) have found numerous injuries and missing parts of fish lice, fish-parasitic copepods, fish isopods, and gill worms (Monogenea) on, and in the gills, or mouths of fishes, and have observed copepods on fishes scurrying away from cleaner fishes, even though they were obviously too large to be removed. Cleaners may bite and injure crustacean parasites that are too large for them to remove (Cleaner nipping*). Cleaner nipping is a widespread, important, but hitherto unrecognised, life history peril for ectoparasites. Mahmoud et al. (2017) experimentally induced nipping and removal of fish parasitic isopods by portunid crabs. Cleaner shrimp similarly snip off the legs of small crustacean parasites to remove and eat them (Williams and Bunkley-Williams 1998b, unpublished data Many copepod parasites of invertebrates also have direct life cycles, but some have endoparasitic larvae and free-swimming adults, mesoparasitic larvae and ectoparasitic adults, and abbreviated or no larval stages.

The copepodid phase in Thaumatopsyllus paradoxus Sars, 1913 comprises the full five stages preceding the adult, and the entire phase from final nauplius to adult is completed without further food intake.",

The confusion lies in the apparent occurrence of all three cycles in the same species of anchor worm. The first copepodid usually attaches and develops through copepodid stages on the gills of a fish host. This may occur on the definitive host specimen, on a different specimen of the same species, or on a different species of fish. In the final copepodid stage, the female usually leaves the gills and attaches on the body of the same fish specimen (direct) or on a different one (indirect). Thus, a real intermediate host can occur, but this is not obligatory. Some of these species may be evolving towards an obligate intermediate host. This would represent a third method of developing, through an intermediate host, for which we propose the term parallel incorporation*.",

Until the external portion is matched with the internal portion in a single species, Ockham's razor would suggest these are portions of two different life cycles of tisbids on octopuses. The complete life cycle is thus still unresolved. Ogawa et al. (1997) suggested Balaenophilus Aurivillius, 1879, species on sea turtles spend their entire life cycle on one host and cannot swim, like whale lice. Dom\u00e8nech et al. (2017) experimentally found nauplii can only crawl, but copepodids and adults can swim, albeit only for short distances. Zwerner's (1967) discovery of Neoscutellidium yeatmani in the gills of Antarctic eelpout has been uncritically repeated so many times that it appears to be widely believed. However, this form has never been reported again. He found a mere seven specimens in the gills of 92 fish. These numbers are too low to sustain a viable life cycle for a parasite. This was very likely an accidental infection. This deep-water fish is known to eat molluscs, and 13 species of parasites in this family infect the gills of deep-water octopuses. These copepods could have spilled from an octopus to the fish consumed (see Prey Predator Transfer). More specimens with this association, with higher numbers per host, would need to be observed before this species could be confidently regarded as a fish parasite.",

In parasitic copepods, the infective larva is, with rare exceptions, the first copepodid, and life cycles are direct, involving only a single host. In fish parasites, the nauplius phase is reduced to two lecithotrophic stages and has uniseriate egg strings in which disc-shaped eggs are closely packed into one row extending the length of the string; and most nauplii have a single pair of modified caudal setae known as balancers (function unknown). Related families with Fig. 5.4 Cuckoo copepods (nicothoids) parasitise the eggs of lobsters and spider crabs in Asia and Brazil. They mimic the eggs of their host and are not removed from the host's eggs, which they eat. The copepod (arrow) has egg strings. See life cycle in Otake et al. (2016) . Image \u00a9 Kaori Wakabayashi multiseriate egg strings, such as lernaeopodids, sphyriids, and two genera of hatschekiids, have nauplii lacking balancers. In some lernaeopodids (Allela Leigh-Sharpe, 1925; Clavella Oken, 1815; and Nectobranchia Hesse, 1863) , the nauplius phase is reduced to one stage. In other lernaeopodids and some pennellids (Salmincola Wilson, 1915; Cardiodectes Wilson, 1917; and Peroderma Heller, 1865) , it is lost completely, and eggs hatch directly into the infective first copepodid. Life cycle abbreviation also occurs in some parasites of invertebrates. The Herpyllobiidae and the genus Trochicola Dollfus, 1914, have only two naupliar stages, and only one nauplius is known for Gonophysema Bresciani & L\u00fctzen, 1960, and for some genera of nicothoids. In other genera of nicothoids, some chordeumiids, and cucumaricolids, there is no nauplius stage. Izawa (2010) experimentally showed that there could be five naupliar stages in Gangliopus pyriformis Gerstaecker, 1854. In most fish parasites, the first copepodid secrets a chitinous frontal filament from an anteriorly located gland, soon after it settles on the host. This filament anchors the developing chalimus larva securely to its host (Rohde 2005) .",

This attention is due to the damage that they cause cage cultured fishes, particularly of salmonids (Lafferty et al. 2015) . Knowing the correct life cycle is critical in determining when to treat for the damaging stages. Caligid sea lice were thought to have four chalimus stages and one or two pre-adult stages. Several recent papers have challenged this scenario (e.g. Hamre et al. 2013; Venmathi Maran et al. 2013) . They found that the typical caligid life cycle comprised eight stages: two naupliar, one copepodid, and four chalimus stages preceding the adult in Caligus M\u00fcller, 1778, but with the four chalimus stages represented by two chalimus and two pre-adult stages in Lepeophtheirus Heegaard, 1943. This is a profound change with significant implications for the aquaculture industry. As the typical caligid life cycle may not exist, it may be necessary to determine the life cycle of every species of damaging sea louse. Again, only 3.8% (17) of life cycles are known for 450 caligid species (Venmathi Maran et al. 2013) .",

Frontal filaments and chalimus larvae occur in most fish parasites for which the larvae are known, but none occur in the lernanthropids. Nicothoids use a similar filament to attach their developing larva to the exoskeleton of a crustacean host. The basic copepodid stages, as primitively retained in Cancerilla Dalyel, 1851, comprise five stages plus the adult. One pre-adult stage in Caligus clemensi Parker & Margolis, 1964, or two pre-adult stages in sea lice, as true moult stages, have been added to the basic life cycle. The general trend in parasites is to simplify or reduce ancestral free-living life cycles. These additions are quite unusual and have only been found in this order.",

            "text": "Not all marine anchor worms have intermediate hosts. Okawachi et al. (2012) suggest Peniculus minuticaudae Shiino, 1956, has a direct life cycle, unlike most pennellids, because copepodids, chalimi, adult males, premetamorphic adult females, and post-metamorphic adult females of the parasite were all found on a single fish. They also describe adult male, copepodid I, and late chalimus stages and redescribe post-metamorphic and premetamorphic adult females. Ismail et al. (2013) described a complete, direct life cycle of a pennellid, Peniculus minuticaudae Shiino, 1956. The hatching stage was an infective copepodid followed by four chalimi and adult instars. Males associated with various pre-adult females, but copulation only occurred between adults. Fertilised premetamorphic adult females carrying spermatophores may detach from the host and settle again before undergoing massive differential growth into the post-metamorphic adult female. Many marine anchor worms (pennellids) have intermediate hosts. This is the first life cycle of the group in which the female remains in the same position on the same host specimen (Ismail et al. 2013) . Otake et al. (2016) had named a new cucukoo copepod* in 2013 and described its abbreviated nicothoid life cycle of free-living nauplius I (NI) observed hatching from female egg sac, copepodid I (CI) found on body of host, and copepodid II+ (CII+) and adults found on host eggs. They surmised NI develops into infective CI in the water column, CI settles on the body of host, and CI moults to CII, migrates to host egg masses, and develops into CII+ and then adults. Adults mate on host egg masses. Brazenor and Hutson (2013) examined the effects of temperature and salinity on the life cycle of Lernanthropus latis Yamaguti, 1954, on the euryhaline barramundi in Australia. Nauplii hatched best at 30-32 C and 35\u2030. None hatched in freshwater and only a few in brackish water. Lernanthropus latis is euryhaline, but freshwater can be used to break its life cycle. \u00d8kland et al. (2014) described two new rhabdovirid viruses, which occurred in all life cycle stages of the salmon sea louse in Norway. The viruses caused tissue necrosis in adult copepods but did not infect fish. They speculate the copepod injects the virus in the fish to confuse its immune system as part of its purposeful life cycle strategy. We find their suggestion interesting but rather astonishing. Copepods do not purposely use viruses; theirs was not the first report of copepod viruses but the fifth; many other fish-parasitic viral vector mutualists* exist to the benefit of crustacean infective stages; and we designated the first viral crustacean mutualists*.",

The contamination of the environment by salmon sea lice from fish farms is a politically and economically important question that has received recent attention. Serra-Llinares et al. (2016) found that farms increase the infection of local, wild salmonids. They also noted Thorstad et al. (2015) , and others strongly suggested the transmission of lice from farm salmon to wild salmonids in systems where the fish occur in close vicinity. These adult caligids can freely swim between hosts (host hop*) and build up in fish cages. Few parasitic copepods have this life-history advantage (serial parasites). The filtering effect of cages tends to concentrate sea lice. Adult male and female caligids are frequently found in plankton samples (Venmathi Maran and Ohtsuka 2008) . They must spend considerable periods free-swimming off hosts. Some species have even been described only from the plankton, and their hosts remain unknown. Ohtsuka et al. (2011) previously described a dajid isopod and a nicothoid copepod parasitising the marsupial lumen of a mysid in Japan. The adults eat mycid eggs and drastically reduce the population of mysids. Infective stages of the copepod penetrate host body tissues, feed, and grow. Infective isopods penetrate the space between the carapace and the dorsal tergites. Remarkably, isopods and copepods rarely occur together, but alternately, albeit continuously, parasitised the same host at different times of the year. This life history association is unique in parasitology. We will call it alternate host sharing*. This allows both parasite species to use all available resources of the host.",

Tang et al.

The CI is infective (found in galls; Izawa 2008) and settles from the plankton onto a host and forms a cyst or gall under the skin on the fins or body of a variety of different bony, coral reef fishes. Lewis (1964) found surgeonfishes (acanthurids) were preferred in Hawai'i. However, parrotfishes were preferred in Puerto Rico (Williams and Bunkley-Williams unpublished data) . The cysts are open posteriorly for respiration (mesoparasite). After feeding, developing, and moulting through CI-CIV, the fifth copepodid emerges from the cyst leaving a moulted exoskeleton behind. Lewis (1964) found these forms were soft and pliant, which he interpreted to be of value in leaving their cysts. It was actually because they had recently moulted. The CV then swims out and searches for a shark definitive host. There could be some predator transfer involved since the copepodids are in hosts preyed upon by sharks. The encysted copepod life cycle* is the only mesoparasitic life cycle known in parasitology and only the second obligate intermediate host life cycle discovered in copepod parasites of fishes. Many tapeworm (cestode) shark parasites have bony fish intermediate hosts, but this is the first crustacean one ever discovered.",

Faster Attachment-when the female settles on the final host, water currents, host movements, and sometimes host cleaning or cleaner organisms make her stay perilous (loose on the host). Nutrients from the intermediate host can be used to permanently attach without waiting to feed on the final host and digest. 7. Widen Host Range-the only crustacean parasite to infect mammals cannot do so without an intermediate host. Kik et al. (2011) found Lepeophtheirus acutus Heegaard, 1943, was a potentially dangerous sea louse of elasmobranchs in captivity. Not only did it damage sharks and rays but could complete its life cycle in an aquarium. Mu\u00f1oz et al.

Mu\u00f1oz et al. (2015) concluded these juvenile fishes were intermediate hosts for these copepods. However, caligids are not known to have intermediate hosts, and pennellid intermediate hosts are adult fish or squids. They had also concluded the copepods would mature too soon to develop with the host fishes. However, we believe the hosts and the parasites will grow up together in these cases. Alternatively, these may be small predators* feeding on juvenile fishes as a part of their life cycles (Table 5 .1). Whichever is the case, this extends and prolongs life cycles further than we had imagined. Interestingly, only copepods are taking advantage of this resource, not only among crustacean parasites but also among all parasites. Mu\u00f1oz et al.

Adults are sessile, with females consisting of a sac attached to the crab host (externa) (Fig. 5 .5) with rootlets of tissue flowing cancer-like through the host's body (interna) and dwarf males inside the female. Some females sequentially only produce male larvae from large eggs, female larvae from small eggs or mixed sexes. They have the usual naupliar instars and infective cyprid; however, in some species, embryos develop directly into cypris larvae before adult females release them. The nauplii are smaller than those found in other barnacles, which may be necessary to produce them in much greater numbers. The larvae are lecithotrophic. The cypris are usually at least 2 days old before they settle on a host. In kentrogonids, male cyprids are larger than female ones. Some have a naupliar eye, and others have compound eyes. Injection of the vermigon (the migratory internal stage) happens within 1-3 days after settlement. When many male larvae exist, only the fastest and strongest will succeed. When there are few males, the female remains receptive longer. When a virgin is found, the male cyrid must settle close to the orifice, enter the brood chamber, and inject a trichogon stage. The trichogon looks like a verogon, except with a spiny collar. It becomes a dwarf male and reaches one of two male receptacles. Once established, the dwarf male undergoes spermatogenesis and is nourished by the female parasite for the duration of its life (cryptogonochorism). The male cypris of akentrogonids penetrate the host or the virgin female with their antennules and without a kentrogon or trichogon. A single male can fertilise all the broods of the female. A female externa produces several batches of larvae and drops off the host just before the host moults.

They have a characteristic bobbing motion when swimming that makes them easy to distinguish in plankton samples. The function and homology of the naupliar horn pores and dorsocaudal organs have been much debated but remain uncertain. They are either planktotrophic or lecithotrophic. Only lecithotrophic nauplii have been raised through all five instars. Planktotrophic nauplii have food visible in their stomachs. Unlike barnacle larvae, the y-cyprid is constantly swimming. This larva is distinctively the costracan. The y-cyprid has a univalved carapace that only partially covers the larval body and resembles an inverted boat but with elongated sharp posterior ends (Fig. 5.6 ). Paired compound eyes lie anteriorly in the body with antennules, labrum, paraocular processes, postocular filamentary tufts, and two pairs of rudiments of antennae and mandibles underneath (ventrally). The antennules have four segments. All larval stages are free-living and semitransparent. The cyprid does not feed. A number of species have been described based only on a y-cyprid (N \u00bc 7) or even a y-nauplii (N \u00bc 4). As with barnacles, the cyprid seeks a host to infect. It has compound eyes, is ambulatory with its antennae, and can produce an adhesive glue. Recently, possible juvenile forms have been produced by treating y-cyprid with the hormone 20-hydroxyecdysone to stimulate ecdysis and the transition to the next life cycle phase. The resulting slug-like, unsegmented, and limbless form was called 'ypsigon' (Fig. 5.6 ). It is formed in the cypris and escapes from its body (Glenner et al. 2008 ). This may be a juvenile.

This may be true, but just because formless structures are produced by similar methods and appear similar does not make them the same. Their notion is courageous, albeit premature. Glenner et al. (2008) found that 40+ morphological types of y-larvae occurred very abundantly around Sesoko Island in Okinawa. This unusual situation may indicate a centre of origin or, possibly, a diversity hot spot. Yet, the adults remain unknown. The 'phantom' adults are neither too rare to discover, nor in some obscure unexamined hosts, nor in some restricted localities. The larvae are just too abundant, widespread, and diverse for such restrictions. This is an adult that parasitologists may be encountering all the time but just cannot recognise. The adult y-parasites may be morphologically similar to another parasite, with which they are confused, or so morphologically indistinct as to be unrecognisable as a parasite. Glenner et al.

A-nauplii have an oval, bowl-shaped head shield, which is broader anteriorly, and setiform frontal filaments. A-cypris have a bivalve carapace and antennules with hooked claws. Echinoderm copebarnacles brood their larvae and only release a-cypris, while coral copebarnacles release nauplii. Usually, six naupliar instars (sometimes two brooded) are followed by one to two cypris-like stages (a-cypris, ascothoracid larvae) (similar to the cirripede single cypris and the y-cypris of y-parasites). Many are lecithotrophic, but some species are planktotrophic. Coral copebarnacles a-cypris occur in the plankton. The a-cypris (ascothoracid-larva) attaches by grasping antennules rather than by glandular secretions as in cirripede cyprids. When two a-cyprid instars occur, the second is the settlement stage. Many species have an abbreviated ontogeny, and the entire naupliar phase is sometimes brooded or embryonised. No complete life cycle is known for any copebarnacle. Neither host infection, nor copulation has ever been observed. Most females have seminal receptacles on their legs, but not in dendrogastrids. Some male a-cyprids have testes with mature sperm and possibly fertilise the females through the pore in the host. Some dwarf males sit close to the aperture, and others live in the mantle cavity of the female. The transition from a bivalved stage to a sac-like carapace is suspected to occur in one moult, but this remains unresolved. A 'post-larval' stage of females and males has been discovered, and second-stage a-cyprids, ready to moult to the male stage, have been observed. The cypris for the modified, enlarged female, and dwarf males of Gorgonian copebarnacles (Gorgonolaureus Utinomi, 1962) are not known. The complete life cycle is equally not known (Kolbasov et al. 2015) . Threefive naupliar instars occur.

Whale lice also like creases, crevices, and barnacles for attachment. By eating algae, they control its growth on their host. In general, slow swimming whales have more whale lice, than fast swimming whales. Some suggest that host jumping or breaching is done in order to knock off whale lice. Some online videos show human divers easily brushing whale lice off whales with only their fingers. Heavy infections reportedly harm humpback and gray whales.

Scuds in six families associate with bivalve mollusc hosts but never in high numbers of adults. Shin et al. (2013) found no damage to the host. Kretzler (1984) could not detect obvious physical damage to sea urchins even by very heavy infections of scuds. They could not determine if the association was obligate. They called it commensalism. We feel the high prevalence (100%) and intensity [1-169 (av. 28.8)] in the broad angel wing, and the lack of free-living collections suggests that it is an obligate parasite. This bivalve is no stranger to crustacean parasitism having two species of parasitic copepods. Shin et al.

            "text": "Mating occurs on a host jelly, males depart, and ovigerous females remain on the host while brooding the eggs. Brood sizes range from 50 to several hundred eggs. The eggs are relatively small for amphipods. Larval stages are in the female marsupium. The first stage is the pantochelis larva with four cheliform pereopods and unsegmented and limbless metasoma and urosome. The pantochelis stage metamorphoses into a 'protopleon' larva (often divided into three sub-stages), having a segmented metasome and imperfect pleopods. In many species, there is no pantochelis stage, and the egg hatches directly into a first protopleon stage. The last (or only) protopleon stage gives rise to the first juvenile stage (a miniature adult) and marks the demarsupiation or the deposition by the female of the larvae (in rare cases the juveniles) into a host. During demarsupiation, the gravid female swims out to find a host and deposits one or a few larvae upon the host specimen (depending on host size and capacity). She continues infecting one host after another. Some females penetrate a host, split a gonad with its mouthparts, and inserts the larvae deeply into the organ. As they grow, the juveniles leave the gonad and start feeding on the prey trapped by the host. Some females deposit pantochelis larvae on the surface of salps with their specialised seventh pereopods. When the larvae moult a few hours later, the ensuing protopleon larvae enter the branchial cavity and eat its wall or feeds on the collected suspended matter. Once the host can no longer support the young as they mature, they leave it for another salp in the chain. Species of phronimids excavate solitary salps or pyrosomes into 'barrels' open at both ends and in which they hide and use as a nursery. The larvae are demarsupiated into the barrel where they soon bunch together into a tight cluster that slowly moves around on the inner barrel wall. The female stays with the barrel and prevents the young from passing to the outer surface. At intervals, she makes short excursions into the water and returns with prey to feed her brood. The pereopods are used to maintain the position of the animal within the barrel, and beating of the pleopods propels the combined barreljelly parasitoids through the water (bio-jet ski).",

They certainly use jellies as places to rest. Jelly parasitoids seem immune to the stings of medusa. Males are better swimmers than females. Gasca and Browne (2017) found ten hyperiid amphipods, a copepod, and a pycnogonid in jelatinous plankton in the Gulf of California. They also named a new species, Megalanceoloides aequanime Gasca, 2017, based on a redescription of M. remipes (Barnard 1932) in Gasca and Haddock (2016) , distributions, sizes, and a few morphological differences. We name Megalanceoloides gascae n. sp. based on the descriptions by Vinogradov (1964) and Vinogradov et al. (1996) of 'M. remipes'. We also distinguish M. gascae from M. remipes on the basis of geographical distributions in the northern Indian Ocean (Vinogradov 1964) vs southwest Atlantic (Barnard 1932; USNM 301871, 1090231) , south-east Pacific (USNM 1090233, 1090237), and Antarctic Ocean (USNM 1090236). The former three records represent two new locality records. The two species are further distinguished based on the sizes of females, 19 mm female (Vinogradov 1964) vs 40 mm male (Barnard 1932) , and morphological differences discussed by Gasca and Haddock (2016) . The holotype is the specimen collected by Vinogradov (1964: 114-117 , by monotypy ICZN 1999: Art 73.1.2) and also in illustrated ions by Vinogradov (1964: Figs. 4, 5) and Vinogradov et al. (1996: Fig. 26 ) (ICZN 1999: Art 72.5.6, 73.1.4) .

Ten species in one genus, Anuropus Beddard, 1886, are known, but only two have been associated with scyphozoans. They live in and feed on their host, but very little else is known (Ohtsuka et al. 2009 ). Our lack of knowledge may be an artefact of destructive net collections (Gasca and Browne 2017).",

No cirolanids are parasites, some corallanids may be parasites (Gentil-Vasconcelos and Tavares-Dias 2015) , and, very likely, some salve bugs (Aegidae) and nasal isopods* (Tridentellidae) are parasites (e.g. Bruce and Wong 2015) .",

Brood pouch development may include egg, oblong embryo predator, curled embryo with enlarged cephalic end and tapered posterior, uneyed embryo, eyed embryo, pre-manca, and manca juvenile (Williams and Williams 1985a, b) . Embryology is often neglected in species descriptions and even in life cycle studies. Embryos in brood pouches number from 37 to 1600 (Adlard and Lester 1995) but are usually in the low to mid-hundreds. Larger and older supra-females have more offspring. Although some brood mortality is expected, Bakenhaster et al. (2006) found none in Glossobius hemiramphi Williams & Williams, 1985. Pre-manca in the marsupium of some species are larvae. Mancae in, and escaping from, the marsupium are juveniles. To avoid confusion, we here refer to this as a manca juvenile*. Once the manca juvenile begins to form the seventh pair of legs in 1-4 moults, we consider these instars juveniles. The few juvenile stages that we know spend the daytime in the surface plankton. They descend at night, finding transfer or definitive hosts. The first to settle on a definitive host develops through the male stage and directly into a female. The second becomes a male. This was the traditional infective assumption based on little data. However, they may actually be infected by founder pairs. Mladineo and Valic (2002) and Mladineo (2003) found only two Ceratothoa oestroides (Risso, 1816) manca infected each annular sea bream even when more mancae were available. They attached to the fish body and migrated under the operculum, rather than being swallowed as previously suspected (e.g. Bunkley-Williams and Williams 1998a).",

A female on a brown chromis in a coral reef reared her posterior from the surface of the host and released a juvenile from the rear of her marsupium, slowly lowered back down, and reared up again to release another. This process was slowly and methodically repeated, although the complete release was not observed. Adlard and Lester (1995) found it took 1-3 h in the lab. The juveniles swam upwards towards the surface. Some authors have mistaken our burst release (Williams and Williams 1985c) with the normal release process. Burst release occurs when a host is caught or struck. All juveniles are released at once even if they are not quite mature (pre-manca and manca; Williams and Williams 1985c) .

The fish isopod manca juvenile has six pairs of legs. Most manca juveniles are much more setose than later juvenile stages. The final juvenile has seven pairs of legs. Intermediate juveniles may have 6.25-, 6.5-, and/or 6.75-leg pairs. Some suggest escaping mancae require a free-swimming period before they can attach to hosts; however, Thatcher (2000) found they were ready to attach to fishes as soon as they left the brood pouch, and Williams and Williams (1985c) reported that Anilocra chromis Williams & Williams, 1981 , and Cymothoa oestrum (Linnaeus, 1758) could attach immediately. Large samples of all post-manca juvenile stages (C. oestrum) have only been examined by Williams and Bunkley-Williams (1994) . Juveniles are positively phototaxic and can be captured in light traps at night. They swim to the surface light when released from the female. They can also be captured with surface plankton nets during the day. They thus appear to avoid the diurnal planktivores on the reef. Adlard and Lester (1995) found they rested at the surface of the water with their hooks (dactyls) through the day, but this was demonstrated in aquaria and not in the field. They descend back to the reef at night and can be caught near the bottom with diver-towed plankton nets. Some have suggested juveniles must feed within 1-2 days to survive (Lester 2005) . However, manca juveniles, unfed, for more than a week, are still capable of infecting hosts. Adlard and Lester (1995) reported that only half of the mancae were infective after 8 days. Juveniles of Glossobius hemiramphi and Livoneca ovalis (Say, 1818) use resting hosts before locating their final hosts. Cook and Munguia (2015) found mancae of Cymothoa excisa Perty, 1833 had a window of 7 days to infect hosts. Juveniles of L. ovalis are micro-males since an adult male has never been found. Resting hosts are commonly used by many species (Thatcher 2000) and may be a part of the normal life cycle. This predisposes them to becoming micro-males. Thatcher (2000) described an interesting life cycle strategy. A manca juvenile swimming right-side up (dorsal up), stops swimming, falls to the bottom landing upside-down (ventral up), and does not move. When a small fish comes near to investigate or eat it, the manca springs to life and attaches to the hapless fish. The isopod now has either a resting host to feed on or a final host on which to mature. This 'dead bug' or 'playing opossum' behaviour, we will call the opossum attack*. Thatcher (2000) found mancae could feed on and kill up to four small fishes in 24 h. This behaviour was in freshwater isopods.",

(2015) gave the 'complete' life cycle for Cymothoa frontalis Milne Edwards, 1840. However, they have the same problems discussed above: (1) omitting how the manca are naturally released (demarsupiation) and (2) omitting the number of free-swimming juvenile stages. They did recognise six female stages. However, their stages Fs-1 to Fs-3 appear to be within the first female instar, which is confusing. Furthermore, size alone does not determine supra-stages or instars (see size discussion below). Their Fs-4 would be our vegetative* supra-female (Sf-2). Their Fs-5 to Fs-6 would be the second marsupial stage (Sf-3). Overall, this does agree with our assertation that females have more than one brood with feeding vegetative stages in between.

Older, larger females can be quite different morphologically from males and immature females (supra-females, Bunkley-Williams and Williams 2003). These differences have caused many taxonomic problems. Adult females moult on the host in two parts. This is probably necessary to have some hardening of the pereopods to maintain attachment on the host. We have seen this many times on Anilocra spp. where the posterior part is shed usually posterior to the 3rd pereon, sometimes the 4th. There must be a considerable delay between moult halves, or we would have never seen so many. We call these mid-moult stages. The delay allows the new hooks (dactyls) to harden before the last anterior segments are shed. We have seen mid-moult stages with a large posterior body and a much smaller anterior body (Williams and Bunkley-Williams unpublished data). We have also seen mid-moult stages in four wild Cymothoa oestrum juveniles .",

As noted above, isopod effects on hosts often cannot be measured with fish condition factors. We studied 120 specimens (85 infected) of doctorfish with 0-8 specimens of two species of adult isopods and noted there was no difference in condition factors (Williams and Bunkley-Williams unpublished data). The isopods cause the host to grow more slowly, but they remain proportional (proportional stunting). \u00d6stlund-Nilsson et al. (2005) also found no conditional factor difference and summarised the literature on this topic. A malefemale pair of Livoneca redmanii in each gill chamber of mackerel will cause a decline in condition factor and often kills the host . Lanzing and O'Connor (1975) also found host condition was only reduced in multiple isopod infections. However, Robinson (2005) found a reduced condition in bicolor damselfish infected with single Anilocra partiti Williams, 1981 females, and Sala-Bonzano et al. (2012) found no condition factor effect of Ceratothoa italica Schioedte & Meinert, 1883, on sand steenbras in a protected area, but severe effects in a similar overfished (unprotected) area. The prevalence of infection was also different (30 vs 47%, respectively). Obviously, the life cycle success rate was improved by stresses on the host, particularly when the lower abundance of host specimens should have had the opposite effect.",

Simple rebrooding* with relatively small brood sizes, where the female internal organs are only flattened by the marsupium, not atrophied, and no vegetative moult is necessary to re-establish feeding. Complex rebrooding* with large brood sizes, where female internal organs are atrophied, a moult to a vegetative supra-female is necessary to re-establish feeding, and a second moult is necessary to re-establish a supra-female with a marsupium. Simple rebrooding is more economical and faster but limited numerically in offspring. Complex rebrooding is slower and uses more resources but produces many more offspring. Adlard and Lester (1995) found simple rebrooding in an externalattaching isopod. found complex rebrooding in a gill chamber-dwelling isopod, Williams and Williams (1986a) in an externally attaching isopod, and Aneesh et al.

Juveniles with full male characters have been found in several species, but these have never been suspected to be sexually active.

It protects vulnerable juveniles from cleaners. 5. It produces greater genetic diversity as many micro-males are available at different times to fertilise each female, instead of one permanent male partner. 6. The abundance and close proximity of numerous micro-males solve the problem of finding a mate. 7. Micro-males form a quick reserve available for developing new females. 8. Micro-males become sexually mature quicker than true males. 9. The energy necessary for a female to hormonally control a male partner is unnecessary. 10. Larger-growing females quickly become too large for cleaner organisms to threaten. 11. Micro-males can parasitise smaller hosts that do not seek out cleaner organisms. 12. Micro-males can easily change host specimens and/or species and are thus more flexible and resilient. 13. Micro-males could potentially use up the resources of one host and just move to another with little effort or danger. 14. The lack of host specificity in micro-males allows them to exploit a broader and more available food supply and to be more flexible and resilient. 15. The time a planktonic reproductive form has to locate a final host is almost infinitely extended by being able to exploit a broad range of more available smaller fishes. 16. Copulation while on the outside of a fish host is easier and safer with a tiny micro-male than with a larger and more bulky 'true' male. 17. This life cycle also resolves the classic question of the expense of sexual reproduction, since all adults produce eggs. 18.

            "text": "Even the most basic life cycle of fish gnats has only very recently been discovered (Fig. 5.12; Smit and Davies 2004) . Zuphea are the first juvenile stage of fish gnats that leave the female, find a host, gorge and swell up with blood, and become the second stage called 'praniza'. The praniza eventually drops off the host and finds a secluded place on the bottom to develop into the next zuphea (Z2). Z2 swims up, finds a host, and repeats the cycle (P2). Zuphea feeding times vary from a few hours to a few days with Z3s taking the longest. They can be as short as an hour on coral reef fishes. Zuphea may attack, feed off (snack*), and kill larval or juvenile fishes as smaller predators*. Eventually, P3 moults into an adult (Fig. 5.12) . In some species, in genera Elaphognathia Monod, 1926, Gnathia, and Paragnathia Omer-Cooper & Omer-Cooper, 1916 , this occurs in one moult. In one species in genus Caecognathia Dollfus, 1901, the first moult results in a pre-adult, which later moults into an adult. We call these feeding and metamorphing units serial parasites, which is somewhat similar to the life cycle found in ticks (arachnids). Praniza may only stay on bony fishes for a few hours but on sharks and rays for weeks. Complete life cycles vary from short to lengthy, directly in relation to seawater temperature: polar (~4-5 years), temperate (~2 years males,~1 year females), and tropical (~2 months) (Smit et al. 2003) . Life cycle fluctuations appear to be seasonal in most species but could be dependent on host availability in some. Adults are benthic, nonfeeding, and semelparous.",

This can have great importance in fish recruitment (Artim et al. 2015) . Sikkel et al. (2017) suggested gnathiids are micropredators [\u00bc our minipredators*] but act like parasites by not leaving the host during each larval life cycle instar (protelean). Barnard, 1914 on its host fish, Clinus superciliosus (Linnaeus, 1758). Image from Smit et al. (2003) Fish gnats are also implicated in the spread of a parasitic protozoa such as Haemogregarina bigemina Laveran & Mesnil, 1901, between hosts (Smit and Davies 2004) . Juvenile fish gnats on fishes often cannot be identified morphologically as the taxonomy is based on adult males, although this is beginning to change in recent studies (Jones et al. 2008) . Fish gnats on coral reefs appear most active at night (Sikkel et al. 2006) , although this may not be the case in other environments. At least in the eastern Caribbean, diel activity appears to be related to both life history stage and sex (Sikkel et al. 2006) . Fish gnats appear to be generalists. They are known to parasitise 61 families in 18 orders of fishes; however, some fishes are infected more often and more heavily (Tanaka 2007; Coile et al. 2014 ). This could be attributable to some combination of preference, host susceptibility, and/or host behaviour. Fish gnats may even appear on pelagic fishes . For example, amberjack (Carangidae), which fed near the bottom, have been infected with fish gnats, and fish species which did not feed near the bottom were free of gnathiids (Williams and Bunkley-Williams unpublished data). Coile et al. (2014) found fish gnats, which fed on more susceptible hosts, produced larger, presumably more successful offspring.",

With implications for our understanding of cleaning symbioses, cleaner fishes often do not eat the fish gnats that are not gorged with blood.

The microniscan attaches externally to a pelagc calanoid copepod, pierces its cuticle to feed on its blood, and undergoes six moults and becomes a cryptoniscan (cryptoniscus and cryptoniscid). When it drops off its copepod host, it seeks a crab or shrimp definitive host in the earliest post-larval stage. On the host, it develops into a juvenile (bopyridium) and then into a female. The first cryptoniscan arriving at a host becomes a female and the second, a male (epigametic sex determination). The female attracts a male with pheromones and hormonally controls it to remain a male similar to cymothoids. The female grows large, while the male remains a dwarf attached to the female.",

Anker (2016) published a photograph of a decapod isopod on Synalpheus brevicarpus (Herrick, 1891), which is definitely a hyperparasite. Several other species of sponge shrimp have hyperparasitic decapod isopods. Duffy et al. (2000) showed that shrimp of the Synalpheus gambarelloides group, and S. regalis, in particular, were sponge parasites. \u010euri\u0161 et al. (2011) studied Typton carneus in Caribbean fire sponges in Belize and found it was parasitic. They also examined two other species of Typton Costa, 1844, and three species in three other genera of palaemonids (Pontoniinae) from the western and eastern Atlantic and Indo-Pacific and one alpheid from the Indo-Pacific and found them to be parasites. Their results suggested parasitism by sponge shrimp was widespread. Zitzler and Cai (2006) reported the first obligate sponge shrimp*, Caridina spongicola Zitzler & Cai, 2006 , in freshwater. This spectacularly coloured, now popular aquarium, shrimp infects an undescribed spongillinid sponge in an ancient lake in Indonesia. We believe it is also the first obligate parasitic sponge shrimp reported from freshwater. Zitzler and Cai (2006) only found diatoms in six shrimp stomachs and called them commensal. However, they have a life cycle like eusocial sponge shrimp [a few (12-18) black eggs directly develop and are released as immature adults with no planktonic phase]. Have numbers (up to 137/host) like eusocialists. We doubt diatoms alone would support any shrimp, much less this many. All marine obligate sponge shrimp, studied thus far, are parasitic.",

Females only mate once and store the sperm to fertilise all their batches of eggs. The eggs are released onto the female's abdomen, below the tail flap, secured with a sticky material, and protected there during embryonic development. Females with eggs are called 'berried' (as are all egg-carrying decapods) because the eggs resemble round berries. When development is complete, the female releases the newly hatched larvae into the gall; they pass out into the water and become part of the plankton. Zoea have a tall dorsal spine and may have additional spines for predator deterrence. The zoea of most species must find food (planktonic), but some crabs provide enough yolk in the eggs that the larval stages can live off the yolk (lecithotrophic). Larval development is scarcely known for coral enveloped crabs but is thought to consist of at least five, and possibly seven, planktonic larval stages (Van Der Meij 2014). Different species may have various numbers of zoeal stages, separated by moults, before they change into a megalopa stage. This last larval stage resembles an adult crab, except for having the abdomen (tail) sticking out behind. Megalopae settle in hole, cracks, or creases in living corals. After one more moult, the crab is a juvenile. The coral grows around the crab, and somehow the crab forms a gall to its particular specifications. Females become sexually mature after the 4th instar in the gall but continue to enlarge until the 7th instar. They somehow manage to enlarge the gall. They produce multiple broods of eggs fertilised by the first mating.",

Females cannot leave their gall, but males can. Sometimes pairs live together in one gall, in adjacent galls, or even in interconnected galls. They cause no real harm to corals. These crabs form their gall to their own size and design. Related crab species form similar galls; therefore, the galls have phylogenic importance (Wei et al. 2013) . Some galls are too closed to be accessible to males. These females copulate before the gall closes, store sperm, and produce up to eight broods over the next 10 months (Vehof et al. 2016) . They found evidence of recent mating of females in more open galls. Castro (2015) discussed all the publications concerning the food habits of gall crabs. They were largely based on supposition, and Castro concluded, like Vehof et al. (2016) , that we still do not know what they eat. He also found the question of their types of symbiosis unresolved. Badaro et al. (2012) observed mucus feeding in the laboratory and suggested all enveloped crabs fed this way and that they are not parasites. We disagree with Badaro et al. (2012) because corals are their obligate hosts and they feed off coral-produced products, if not tissues, which the corals need.

However, we documented the first record of predation on a male, and probably at night, since it was by a cardinalfish, on a coral reef in Okinawa (Williams and Williams 1986c) . Pea crabs find females by their pheromones. Male crabs sometimes must rub, or tickle, bivalve mollusc hosts for hours to make them open up (Trottier and Jeffs 2015) . Once in the host, they copulate with the female, who never leaves the host. Thus, females can become relatively larger (still only pea-size) to produce eggs, while the polygamous males are smaller and flatter to sneak in and out of hosts. In hosts with more roomy accommodations, males may reside with females. Females carry egg masses attached to the pleopods, where they develop until they hatch into zoeae.",

(2011) examined Dissodactylus primitivus Bouvier, 1917, ectoparasitic on two spatangoid echinoid (heart urchins) hosts, Meoma ventricosa (Lamark, 1816) and Plagiobrissus grandis (Gmelin, 1791), which have the entire life cycle on M. ventricosa and only adults on P. grandis, but with more fecundity. Crabs detected hosts by olfactory cues. Crabs from P. grandis were more attracted by this host (where the entire life cycle can be fulfilled, possible imprinting). Crabs from M. ventricosa are equally attracted to either host. Host switching may explain asymmetrical infection rates and specialisation on P. grandis may be in progress. Jossart et al. (2014) characterised pea crabs ectoparasitic on sea urchins at Discovery Bay, Jamaica, in which both sexes changed hosts, searched for sexual partners, and had a polygamous mating system. Most mate by polygynandry between large females and wandering small males, although some by monogamy, or temporary monogamy between adults of similar sizes, and a few by swarming of males (Castro 2015) . Ambrosio and Baeza (2016) found the pea crab, Tunicotheres moseri (Rathbun, 1918), did not attempt to infect previously, conspecific infected ascidian hosts, Styela plicata (Lesueur, 1823), to avoid conflict, even though this host was scarce and defence of the host was minimal. This is another variety of negative precursor. We wonder if defence of the host was once fiercer, incited this avoidance, and then faded with non-use. Castro (2015) listed many damages attributed to pea crabs. The most common was slowed growth, and the most harmful, sterilization and sex reversal. He concluded that most associations were parasitic and only some more loosely associate forms in tube-or burrow-dwelling hosts might be commensal.",

Even their life cycles are similar with intermediate hosts, except that it is not an obligate intermediate in the anchor worm. Furthermore, the anchor worm is freshwater, and marine anchor worms are marine, and they are classified in different orders. Lafferty and Kuris (2002) recognised four life cycle strategies (a bit too simple) and ten trophic strategies. Poulin (2011b) arranged all parasites into six major life strategies (see Table 5 .2). All categories, except vector transmission, apply to crustaceans. Poulin and Randhawa (2015) further defined and defended the categories but made little more use of them. Half were named for transmission methods and half for effects on the hosts, which seems confusing as they are not, necessarily, mutually exclusive. In order to standardise his terms, we rephrase parasitoid to 'adult injection transmitted', parasitic castrator to 'larval penetration/injection transmitted', and Table 5 .2). We also add a seventh strategy. Most microbial parasites have no animate transmission agent. They contaminate potential hosts in incidentally shed host products or by long-lived free-living stages. Some symbionts on sea turtles and manatees spend their entire life histories on their hosts, never leaving, never transmitted. Poulin and Randhawa (2015) call their categories 'dead ends', but we do not believe micropredator is necessarily a parasitological dead end.

They can either convert their free-living stages to parasitism or metamorphose new parasitic stages. Those few that have developed parasitic larval or juvenile parasitic stages are progressing. However, the free-living adults many retain must become parasitic. Adults must also become more modified and adapted to a parasitic existence. Crab barnacles have done a pretty good job of this, and a few copepod adults are well modified, but in general, crustaceans have done a terrible job of adapting to and exploiting parasitism.",

Unfortunately, they are also practically unchangeable in having no free-living forms to become parasitic, no adults in invertebrates, major parasitic modifications, and low species abundance.

They would eventually evolve into Climax Parasites but now possess just the opposite of the climax characters stated above. The Climax Parasites have traded flexibility and the ability to innovate for stability and the maximum parasite experience. They are rigid and vulnerable with exposed multiple hosts and complex life cycles, unable to make major host group shifts, life cycle reductions or additions, and too involved in, and dependant on, stability.

'Spillover' suggests the pen is so full of free-swimming, infective parasites (copepodids) that a few are forced out. See filtering. Sterilisation-the act of making an animal unable to reproduce. See partial sterilisation, hormonal sterilisation, and nutritional sterilisation. Strict parasite-see true parasite. Superinfection-a mass infection with about as many parasites that can fit on or in a host. This usually results in the death of the host and the parasites. Supra-females (post-adult stages, supra-adult)-stages after the first adult female stage with size and/or morphological differences with the first adult and each other. These can be growth stages or instars and often occur in crustaceans. Supra-males-see supra-females. Tantulus larva-the only larval stage of minute crustacean parasites (tantulocarids) with a dorsal head shield, six-segmented thorax, and biramous urosome. Temporary parasite-(a) a facultative parasite; (b) a parasite that survives for a time after ingestion by a host species other than its customary host; (c) a minipredator, associated with a prey item just long enough for it to be called a host but largely free-living and rarely found associate with a host; or (d) a parasite with any freeliving stage. Thoracopod-see pereopod.",

This is not an intermediate host because no larval stages are involved. See paratenic host, micro-male host, and prey-predator life cycle. Transitional parasite-a crustacean or roundworm (Nematoda) in the clade Ecdysozoa. They are relatively new parasites with many free-living relatives and little evolved towards a climax parasite state. See climax parasite. Transport host-see paratenic host. Trichogon-injected into a female by a male crypis, of parasitic barnacles (rhizocephalans), and becomes a dwarf male. Trophic transmission-see parasite-induced trophic transmission. True parasite (good parasite, strict parasite)-a small organism, which feeds from and harms a larger organism. True parasites have a definitive host, which they never leave. True predator (carnivore)-an organism that hunts, kills and eats other organisms (prey) . See ambushing, opossum attack, and Vector mutualists-when a disease or parasite transmitted to a host also benefits the vector. When crustacean parasites are vectors, the infective stage of the crustacean benefits by the invasive transferred organism confusing the immune system of the host and increasing infective crustacean survival. See viral crustacean mutalists. Vegetative stage-is a term we borrowed from botany to describe a feeding and nonreproductive female stage of fish isopods (cymothoids) between stages with a marsupium. See complex rebrooding. Vermigon-a migratory internal stage injected by the kentrogon stage of a parasitic barnacle (rhizocephalans). Viral crustacean mutualists-a virus benefiting its crustacean host and doing little or no harm to the host. Virgin female-a term used in the literature for an adult female lacking a marsupium.",
