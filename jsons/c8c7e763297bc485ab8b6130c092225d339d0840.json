COVID-19 was first reported in Wuhan, China, and subsequently spread worldwide. The coronavirus was officially named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses based on phylogenetic analysis. SARS-CoV-2 is believed to be a spillover of an animal coronavirus and later adapted the ability of human-to-human transmission. Because the virus is highly contagious, it rapidly spreads and continuously evolves in the human population. In this review article, we discuss the basic properties, potential origin, and evolution of the novel human coronavirus. These factors may be critical for studies of pathogenicity, antiviral designs, and vaccine development against the virus.",

Since initially emerged in China, the virus has evolved for four months and rapidly spread to other countries worldwide as a global threat.

The replicase polyprotein pp1a/ab encodes and is proteolytically cleaved into 16 putative nsps, including nsp3 (papain-like protease), nsp5 (3C-like protease), nsp12 (RNA-dependent RNA polymerase [RdRp]), nsp13 (helicase), and other nsps [10, 13, 20] . The spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 binds to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) in human and Chinese horseshoe bats, civet for cell entry, that is also dependent on S protein priming by the serine protease TMPRSS2. A similar panel of mammalian cell lines can be infected with SARS-CoV-2-S and SARS-CoV-S [21] [22] [23] [24] . The spike protein could be cleaved by host proteases into the S1 and S2 subunits, which are responsible for receptor recognition and membrane fusion, respectively. S1 also can be divided into an N-terminal domain (NTD) and a C-terminal domain (CTD). The S1 CTD of SARS-CoV-2, but not the NTD, showed strong affinity for human ACE2 (hACE2). The receptor-binding domain (RBD) within SARS-CoV-2 CTD is the key region that interacts with the hACE2 receptor with higher affinity than the RBD of SARS-CoV by 10-to 20-fold with kinetic quantification [23, 25] .

Domestic animals can suffer from disease as intermediate hosts that cause virus transmission from natural hosts to humans; for example, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV crossed the species barriers into masked palm civets and camels, respectively [30, 31] [ Table 1 ]. SARS-CoV-2 sequenced at the early stage of the COVID-19 outbreak only shares 79.6% sequence identity with SARS-CoV through early full-length genomic comparisons. However, it is highly identical (96.2%) at the whole-genome level to Bat-CoV RaTG13, which was previously detected in Rhinolophus affinis from Yunnan Province, over 1,500 km from Wuhan [21] . Bats are likely reservoir hosts for SARS-CoV-2; however, whether Bat-CoV humans because of the similarity of the pangolin coronavirus to SARS-CoV-2 [32, 33] . The additional analysis of phylogenetic networks can be effective and useful to trace undocumented COVID-19 infection sources [34] . In addition to the zoonotic origins of SARS-CoV-2 by natural evolution, there are still some disputes about the origin of the virus because its spike protein seems to perfectly interact with the human receptor in contributing to human-to-human transmission after evolution in a short period. Nevertheless, more direct evidence is required to clarify the arguments.",

The synonymous substitution rate for coronaviruses might be approximately 1 \u00d7 10 -3 /synonymous site/year, which is lower than some other RNA viruses. The mutation rate during coronavirus replication could be partially controlled by the viral exoribonuclease nsp14 [36, 37] .

Since the viral sequences continuously change, the construction of a phylogenetic network is crucial to investigate the adaption of the virus in different human populations and environments. Although the virus keeps evolving within humans who could also be susceptible to other human coronaviruses, recombination between SARS-CoV-2 and old human coronaviruses, such as HCoV-229E, OC43, NL63, and HKU1, has not been found. Nevertheless, a recent study revealed that three genetic types, A, B, and C, of the virus have been circulating globally [34] . The study demonstrated that the genotypes could also correlate to the geographic locations. This indicates that the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 may be affected by replication environments, such as genetic and immunological restrictions in different human populations. With evolutionary pressure, the selection of SARS-CoV-2 mutations will be ongoing. The investigation of the geographic patterns of SARS-CoV-2 variations will provide information on vaccine development for different populations.",

The conformational change in the S protein after receptor binding facilitates viral envelope fusion with the cell membrane through the endosomal pathway. The viral RNA genome is then released into the cytoplasm and translated into viral replicase polyproteins pp1a and 1ab, which can be cleaved into small products by virus-encoded proteinases. The polymerase transcribes a series of subgenomic mRNAs by discontinuous transcription. The subgenomic mRNAs are finally translated into viral structural proteins. The S, E and M proteins enter the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi apparatus, and the N protein is combined with the positive-stranded genomic RNA to form a nucleoprotein complex. The structural proteins and nucleoprotein complex are assembled with the viral envelope at the ER-Golgi intermediate compartment. The newly assembled viral particles are then released from the infected cell [Fig. 2].",

Furthermore, the earliest three patients with symptom onset had no known history of exposure to the Huanan market [1]. Therefore, there may be multiple sources of COVID-19 in the beginning. According to previous studies by metagenomic sequencing for the samples from Malayan pangolins (Manis javanica) in Guangxi and Guangdong, China, it has been suggested that pangolins might be the intermediate hosts between bats and",
