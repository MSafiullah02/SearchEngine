These clinical subtypes are closely related to prognosis, which is extremely poor for the aggressive subtypes [7]. Although the best clinical results are achieved by systemic chemotherapy, the median survival time is only 12.7 months and complete response is achieved in only 40% of treated cases [8]. Most of these patients eventually relapse and have a median progression-free survival time of 5\u20137 months. Moreover, the treatment options are extremely limited for those who do not respond to the initial chemotherapy. New immunotherapy or immunomodulatory agents, such as mogamulizumab (anti-CCR4 monoclonal antibody) [9, 10] and lenalidomide (an oral immunomodulatory drug) [11] have recently been used as treatments for ATL in Japan and are effective in some patients.

A nationwide retrospective study of allo-HSCT for the treatment of ATL [15] demonstrated several pretransplantation factors that are associated with poor survival rates, such as poor Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status (ECOG-PS) rating, higher age, male sex, non-complete remission (non-CR) at transplantation, and the use of unrelated cord blood as the stem cell source. In that study, non-CR at transplantation was also identified as a risk factor for disease-associated mortality (DAM). Although disease status at transplantation is known to be an important factor associated with outcome after allo-HSCT for ATL, it is often difficult to achieve CR in ATL patients. As a consequence, some ATL patients are compelled to receive allo-HSCT despite their non-CR status. Indeed, in daily practice, we often encounter patients whose ATL tumor cells become chemoresistant during their planned chemotherapy. We therefore think that it is essential to improve the allo-HSCT treatment strategy in ATL patients, especially those in non-CR.",

Chemotherapy regimens prior to transplant and detailed transplant procedures are shown in Tables S1 and S2, respectively. Conditioning regimen, graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis, and infection prophylaxis were similar in both transplant centers. Cyclophosphamide + total-body irradiation was used as the myeloablative conditioning regimen, while fludarabine + melphalan-based or fludarabine + busulfan-based regimen was used as the RIC regimen. For GVHD prophylaxis, cyclosporine A + short-term methotrexate was used in patients transplanted from an HLA-matched related donor, while tacrolimus + short-term methotrexate was used in patients transplanted from an unrelated or HLA-mismatched related donor. Antimicrobial prophylaxis with levofloxacin, antifungal prophylaxis with fluconazole or voriconazole, varicella-zoster virus prophylaxis with acyclovir, and Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia prophylaxis with trimethoprim\u2013sulfamethoxazole were standard prophylaxis for infection.",

A low number of naive T-lymphocytes may underlie the mechanism of immunodeficiency in HTLV-1 infected individuals [26]. Indeed, ATL patients are susceptible to various opportunistic infections and it has been reported that infection-related mortality is significantly higher than in patients with AML and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) [27].

Kozako et al. reported that the expression of programmed death-1 in CD8+ T-cells, including in cytomegalovirus- and Epstein\u2013Barr virus specific cytotoxic T-cells, was significantly higher in patients with ATL than in HTLV-I carriers and control individuals [28]. It is tempting to speculate that the compromised cellular immunity in ATL patients is attributable to T-cell exhaustion induced by overexpression of programmed death-1 ligand in tumor cells [29]. Therefore, compared with those in CR, patients with ATL in non-CR may show reduced immune responses to various pathogens. We also noticed that a certain number of Pt-non-CR died of transplant-related complications other than infection, but we could not clarify whether residual ATL gave rise to these complications (Table 4).",

It also showed that transplant-related events were the principal causes of early death, while disease-associated deaths were more common in the later phases [15]. We demonstrated that transplant-related deaths in the early phase of allo-HSCT in ATL patients were prominent among Pt-non-CR (Fig. 3 and Table 4). Interestingly, the cumulative incidence of disease-associated death of Pt-CR at transplantation was roughly equivalent to that of Pt-non-CR in the current study. These results suggest that disease progression after transplantation in Pt-non-CR cannot be evaluated properly due to the early deaths of the patients.",

Patients with aggressive ATL who do not receive allo-HSCT in Okinawa Prefecture show poorer clinical outcomes than those patients in other areas of Japan [30]. The difference in clinical outcomes between patients with ATL in Okinawa and those in other areas of Japan might be partly attributed to the different distribution of the HTLV-1 tax genotype in Okinawa from mainland of Japan [31]. Further study is needed to clarify the impact of geographical factors and/or genetic backgrounds of ATL patients on transplantation outcomes after allo-HSCT in Okinawa.",

However, our study included all patients with aggressive ATL who received allo-HSCT in Okinawa Prefecture during the study period. Therefore, the results of our study reflected actual conditions of allo-HSCT for ATL in Okinawa. Because patients received transplantation without strict transplant eligibility criteria, patients with poor ECOG-PS were included in this study. Indeed, there was one patient with an ECOG-PS of three in Pt-CR and four patients with an ECOG-PS of three in Pt-non-CR. No patients had ECOG-PS 4 in either group. Even after excluding patients with ECOG-PS of three, similar results were seen in these patients (Fig. S5 and Table S4). In this study, 41 Pt-non-CR included 20 patients with partial response, 6 patients with stable disease, and 15 patients with progressive disease at transplantation (Table 1). Worse disease status was associated with lower overall survival and higher TRM, but did not affect DAM (Fig. S6).",

However, it is difficult to complete planned treatments because of toxicity and/or loss of effectiveness of the chemotherapy [8]. In cases of dismal outcomes after intensive chemotherapy in ATL patients, hematologists often consider allo-HSCT as a treatment option for patients with aggressive ATL in non-CR. Indeed, in the current study, and in other retrospective studies of allo-HSCT for aggressive ATL, the number of Pt-non-CR tends to be more than double that of Pt-CR [15, 27]. Since the early application of allo-HSCT is considered to reduce TRM and improve overall survival in patients with aggressive ATL, we should consider both the disease status at transplantation and the optimal timing of allo-HSCT. Furthermore, we should also consider more effective treatment strategies to reduce disease progression and relapses after allo-HSCT.",

Even after overcoming complications in the early phase, disease progression and relapse remain important problems in patients with ATL both in non-CR and in CR at transplantation. Our findings suggest that not only treatment for disease control but also intensive management to prevent transplant-related complications is required in order to improve the success rate of transplantation in ATL patients who cannot achieve CR before allo-HSCT. Furthermore, more effective therapeutic strategies for ATL are required to attain CR in patients undergoing allo-HSCT.",
