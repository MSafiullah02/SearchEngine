We aim to investigate the corresponding clinical, radiological and laboratory characteristics between different clinical stages. A retrospective, single-centre study of 101 confirmed patients with COVIDwas enrolled; follow-up endpoint was on 8 February 2020. Clinical data were collected and compared during the course of illness. The median age of the 101 patients was 51.0 years and 33.6% were medical staff. Fever (68%), cough (50%) and fatigue (23%) are the most common symptoms. About 26% patients underwent the mechanical ventilation and 98% patients were treated with antibiotics. Thirty-seven per cent patients were cured and 11 died. On admission, the number of patients with uncomplicated illness, mild, severe and critical pneumonia were 2 [2%], 86 [85%], 11 [11%] and 2 [2%]. Forty-four of the 86 mild pneumonia progressed to severe illness within 4 days, with nine patients worsened due to critical pneumonia within 4 days. Two of the 11 severe patients improved to mild condition while three others deteriorated. Significant differences were observed among groups of different clinical stages in numbers of influenced pulmonary segments (6 vs. 12 vs. 17, P < 0.001). A significantly upward trend was witnessed in ground-glass opacities overlapped with striped shadows (33% vs. 42% vs. 55% vs. 80%, P < 0.001), while pure ground-glass opacities gradually decreased as disease progressed (45% vs. 35% vs. 24% vs. 13%, P < 0.001) within 12 days. Lymphocytes, prealbumin and albumin showed a downtrend as disease progressed from mild to severe or critical condition, an uptrend was found in white blood cells, C-reactive protein, neutrophils and lactate dehydrogenase. The proportions of serum amyloid A > 300 mg/l in mild, severe and critical conditions were 18%, 46% and 71%, respectively.",

Yet the SARS-CoV-2 was also found with R0 [4] . It has more clinical symptoms of dyspnoea while headaches and diarrhoea are rare [5] . As to radiological features, COVID-19 usually has abnormalities on chest computed tomography (CT), of which the most typical one is ground-glass opacity, and the lesions are generally multiple and located in the posterior or peripheral lung [6] . Patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 normally develop symptoms in 2\u22127 days after infection with a rapid disease progress.

Laboratory indicators of blood routine test, blood coagulation and their medical reference ranges were collected. The presence of SARS-CoV-2 in respiratory specimens was detected by real-time RT-PCR methods, issued by the Chinese CDC [7] . All the thin-layer images were collected in the format of Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM). Then the imaging signs and their features were extracted using a double-blind method, by which two intermediate radiologists in respiratory medicine (with more than 5 years' experience) would read and report the images independently and their results would finally be reviewed and confirmed by a senior doctor (engaged in imaging diagnosis for more than 15 years). Radiological findings such as lesions, lesion size (the longest diameter of the lesion) and radiological patterns were extracted. In addition, to evaluate the lesion size accurately, a diagnosis system for novel coronavirus pneumonia based on artificial intelligence (AI), was employed to analyse CT images using CT value to measure volume ratio of pneumonia automatically, which had been used at this hospital in early January [8] [9] [10] [11] .",

This finding further confirms the viewpoint that the median time from onset to admission was 7 days by Huang et al. [5] .

This sharp downtrend could also be witnessed for median time from admission to diagnosis. Notable, the majority (72%) of the non-medical-staff patients had complications, which primarily were cardiovascular diseases and diabetes. This proportion was higher than SARS but close to MERS [14] , suggesting that patients with pre-existing conditions should get well-prepared for the prevention of SARS-CoV-2. On admission, most patients had fever (68%), the most common symptom of the disease in the study.

This suggested that we should pay more attention to the disease at an early stage, rather than neglecting the mild illness. Besides, we could see that COVID-19 progresses rapidly within 4 days from mild-to-severe condition, further illustrated by variations in radiological characteristics over time in this study. Indeed, it is significantly crucial to speed up the diagnosis process of suspected cases and make sure all potential patients are able to get access to hospitals for observation and treatment at an early stage. Furthermore, patients with complications could highly develop severe and critical illness as disease progressed. Also whether or not having dyspnoea as initial symptoms and the respiratory frequency in physical examination on admission were both significantly different among groups of different clinical stages (higher probability observed in severe or critical stage than the mild one), suggesting that attention should be paid to the patient's underlying disease and first symptoms when treating COVID-19 [8, [15] [16] [17] .",

Also, the most common lesions were on the posterior and lateral sides of the lower pulmonary lobe. Yet it was light in the shadows of infiltration of inflammation in lung lobe at the beginning, mainly related to its pathological changes, still suggesting that the SARS-CoV-2 already affected the lung before symptoms were being recognised. As the disease progressed, an upward trend was observed in the numbers of ground-glass opacities overlapped with striped shadows, of affected pulmonary segments, illustrating that pulmonary fibrosis became more severe and to some extent further suggesting that patients are at risk of irreversible damage to lung function in the future, which may further lead to functional disability and affect the quality of life. Such sequelae occurred in both patients infected with SARS or MERS [11, 18] . Hence, adding supportive treatment to the therapeutic regimen should be taken into consideration to improve patient's immunity, to weaken the damages to the lungs caused by viral pneumonia and to reduce the risk of sequelae. In addition, no significant difference was shown in typical radiological patterns among groups of different clinical stages but mosaic signs and pleural effusion, which might relate to prognosis. Meanwhile, AI-based diagnosis system showed similar results in assessment of lesions size as what was evaluated by the radiologists. It is also worth mentioning that such AI system greatly improved diagnostic efficiency of COVID-19, alleviating the surge in demand of radiologists when the virus is stalking China.

Some of those indicators were inconsistent with previous studies [13] . In addition, we observed that the amount of albumin and prealbumin in critically or severely ill patients were significantly lower than those of mild ones. Such differences might relate to the cytokine storm caused by the virus at the late stage of the disease and other factors, such as subsequent hypoxia, gastrointestinal dysfunction, endocrine and metabolic disorders, insufficient nutrition intake and the use of ventilator with positive pressure, and increased energy consumption in the body. Eventually, malnutrition would be caused or aggravated. As a negative acute phase response protein and a kind of substance in non-specific host defense, prealbumin can clear the toxic metabolites released in the circulation during the infection process, and therefore its amount reduced in blood as it was gradually consumed. This reminds us to provide nutrition support for these kind of patients [19] . Meanwhile, we found that some inflammation indicators, such as C-reactive protein, and serum amyloid A, increased in the early stage of the disease, but higher amounts of them were observed in severe and critical patients than that of mild cases. This might indicate the patients were in the state of acute stress with elevated serum amyloid A and C-reactive protein, which are able to bind various microorganisms' polysaccharides and tissue cells' phospholipids and nucleic acids to activate the immune system, improving immunity and mediating inflammatory responses.",

In addition, the evidences collected in this study cannot confirm which treatment can obviously control the disease progression among current clinical treatment regimens. Therefore, pro-active actions should be taken to accelerate the clinical trial for potential effect drugs, such as Remdesivir, and various drug combinations [9, 20] ; meanwhile, more existing drugs on the market, which can enhance immune response, reduce immunopathology and prevent or suppress ARDS, such as metformin, glitazone, sartans, atorvastin and relative nutritional supplements and biologics, might be effective treatment options for this disease [4, [21] [22] [23] .",
