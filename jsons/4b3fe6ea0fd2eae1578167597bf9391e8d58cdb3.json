Heterogeneity in transmission risk is a known phenomenon in infectious diseases and was also seen in SARS and MERS outbreaks since 2003. The pandemic has led countries to control the pandemic spread using unprecedented severe mitigation strategies that include quarantine and lock-down. This has has been highly successful in terms of halting the spread, but had enormous socioeconomic cost. We set out to theoretically explore whether a model that includes the phenomenon of \"superspreaders\" may guide us towards a cost-effective mitigation strategy.",

This allow us to investigate effect of containment strategies in both a random SEIR like scenario, and in a transmission model that work with structured society. Our model considered even contact patterns in three settings: home, school/work and a category of \"other\" settings representing diffuse social contacts. We introduced superspreaders either as a fixed proportion of the population, or as a broad spectrum of infectivity. For each choice, the model was then calibrated to an overall realistic daily growth rate of 23%. As sensitivity analyses we varied the fraction of superspreaders as well the distribution of their infectivity. To compare the simulation findings for each mitigation scenario we considered the maximum daily ICU utility.",

However when introducing mitigation strategies imposed on each of the three settings, we find that the presence of \"superspreaders\" made a substantial difference. The simulations demonstrate that the best strategy is to focus on limiting contacts in the \"other\" category. This in particular suggests that limiting diffuse social contacts in settings such as bars, transportation, restaurants, parties, concerts and lecture halls is far more effective than limiting the same amount of contact events in the \"home\" and \"school/workplace\" setting.",

Doing so, we found that wide distribution of infectivity favours strategies that reduces the max, while leaving the typical behaviour undisturbed. We found that most workplaces may be opened without much influence on the epidemic, while one could snuff out transmission with an effective avoidance of \"other\" contacts. Interestingly, including a consideration of \"superspreaders\" can help explain the dramatic success of even moderate lock-down strategies as that practiced in Denmark and Sweden. And it points to the need to avoid mass gatherings until either flock immunity has been achieved or an effective vaccine is available.",

For example, as South Korea reopened the country carefully recently, a single infected person visiting a night club led to at least 50 new infections. In the US, a 2,5 hour long choir rehearsal tragically led to 75% of the participants getting infected and several deaths. These, as well as outbreaks in prisons and hospitals and following carnevals are vivid examples of SARS-CoV-2 superspreader events illustrate that these are important in the spread of this novel virus. It is also reminiscent of documented superspreader events in the dissemination of SARS-CoV in the 2003 outbreak in Asia and Canada. One recent study estimated that 80% of infections may be caused by 10% of the infected population, pointing to transmissibility (R 0 ) being highly heterogeneous 2 . Thus, the practice of relying on average R 0 in dynamic disease models can obscure considerable individual variation in infectiousness including extreme transmitters 3, 4 . It is also understood that such heterogeneity will not affect the epidemic spread by much in standard dynamic SEIR models. One might ask why are we often seeing superspreading events as a precurser to outbreaks? Also, why do we see marked heterogeneity in the geographical distribution and intensity of outbreaks across countries and regions?",

The model is simulated in discrete time-steps of 6 hours, during which each infected agent has a probability of infecting another agent, potentially leading to transmission of the disease. We have checked that smaller time steps do not change our results. As time progress an infected agent may change state, with rates set by the duration of each interval in the top panel of Fig. 1 . As we further follow the occupation of ICU, then the model also simulate the agents through the latter steps of the disease using probabilities from table 1.",

Next, in Panel b) we introduce superspreaders and obtain a better fit. In this scenario it is sufficient to assume that the general distance/hygiene factor only reduce the \"Other\" sector (and not in the work/school sector). Alternatively, one could interpret the reduction in contact rate as the effect of closing down venues where many people meet. The one month forecast past the recent second reopening is far more optimistic with than without superspreaders in the model (compare panel a and panel b). Not surprisingly, a scenario in which we completely return to pre-pandemic interactions and hygiene is far more gloomy -regardless of whether there are superspreaders (See Fig. 5c ).",

How could the epidemic be so slow to spread in the epicenter in Wuhan with an estimated growth of 10% a day 16 , while it later expanded with 30% per day. Why did it spread so slowly in Japan and why did it never cause a major epidemic in Africa while causing disaster with growth in death rates of up to 40%/day in northern Italy and Spain. Are we missing something? Was it the elimination of superspreading opportunities that ended the SARS outbreak in 2003?",

While we have observed even dramatic superspreading events in which a single person manages to infect up to hundreds in a short time span, it nevertheless appears to be important for the dissemination of COVID-19 epidemic. But the mechanism behind the phenomenon is not well understood; are for example some individuals genetically more prone to spreading widely? Or is anyone a superspreader the day of symptom onset? or could it be that certain activities or gatherings with singing, yelling facilitates superspreading? Because we do not know this we modeled superspreading as a fixed proportion of individuals who transmits 50-fold more than others. Then, in sensitivity analyses, we explored other possibilities such as a smaller fraction and a power-log distribution of superspreaders among all infected individuals.",

As expected, the presence or absence of superspreaders does not matter much to an unmitigated epidemic. However, in a mitigated epidemic, as COVID-19 just now, superspreaders matters profoundly. With this model and assumptions we simulated COVID-19 epidemics with a focus on the magnitude, trajectory of the outbreak and noting the peak level of ICU utilization (the latter as a measure of impact on the health system). We found the following major results for our agent-based model where superspreaders was acting within a socially structure: 1. In comparison to mitigating in the \"home\" and \"work/school\" sector, mitigating the \"other\" sector has a profound impact -it halts the epidemic. This finding suggests that limiting diffuse/random social contacts such as that occurring in transportation, gatherings, weddings, religious meetings, and frequent trips to shops, bars and restaurants is what drives the COVID-19 epidemic. This dramatic finding only obtains when superspreaders are in the model. 2. When we fit our model to actual observed daily Danish COVID-19 hospitalization data from the epidemic pre-intervention period and two months after the lockdown was in effect (March 13), we found that our one month forecast of the epidemic trajectory following the reopening of the country looked far more promising with than without superspreading, providing one continue to limit social contacts in the \"other\" sector.",

On the other hand, part of the interactions in the \"work\" sector would involved non-known persons, such as casual contacts at cafeterias, conferences and workshops. Importantly, all of this is not too concerning, because what really matters is how many different people a superspreader meets during the period where he/she infects excessively. Now, about 4 months into the pandemic we see a heterogeneous epidemic patterns across European countries. One possible reasons for this could be the work of superspreaders. An epidemic take-off may well require a superspreader because the R 0 would be below 1 for the rest of the population. But if a superspreader is infected, the disease may spread to other superspreaders. Although hard to prove, it would not surprise us if the observed major differences across cities, regions and countries could be understood as a stochastic phenomenon modulated by a larger chance for the epidemic to percolate among superspreaders in large cities.",

For the base model, and for all dynamic simulations inFig. 2 and 4we use s i = 50 for 10% of the population. In the sensitivity analysis (seeFig. 4e,f) we first consider a range of prevalence of superspreaders (from 0% to 20% of the population). Then we consider a distribution of superspreader intensity, where s i are drawn from a distribution p(s) \u221d 1/s \u03b3 , s \u2208 [1, 1000]. The choice of the upper cut-off also influences the results, as the the average infections per person are divergent with the upper limit when \u03b3 \u2264 2.
