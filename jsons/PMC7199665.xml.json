            "text": "In every stage of production pigs can encounter pathogens that may cause detrimental effects on growth performance and health. In the U.S., 2 newly-emerged enteric pathogens which compromise health and production are porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) and porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV). Both of these RNA viruses are of the Coronaviridae family (Woo et al., 2012) that infect enterocytes of the gastrointestinal tract. In April 2013, PEDV was first identified in the U.S. (Stevenson et al., 2013) with clinical signs including diarrhea, dehydration, anorexia, and mortality. Severe clinical signs and mortality have been primarily observed in suckling pigs (Stevenson et al., 2013); however, PEDV clinical signs are also observed in weaned pigs with varying levels of morbidity (Madson et al., 2014) in experimental conditions. In February 2014, PDCoV was first detected in the U.S. and was shown to be related to 2 Chinese strains with clinical signs of diarrhea in sows and piglets and mortality in piglets (Wang et al., 2014). The majority of research on PDCoV has focused on etiology, propagation in cell culture, and genome sequencing (Chen et al., 2015; Hu et al., 2015; Jung et al., 2015c; Ma et al., 2015; Homwong et al., 2016); however, little research is available on the effect of PDCoV on growth performance.",

Interestingly, the long-term effects of PEDV and PDCoV on pig performance and lean tissue accretion have not been reported. Such research can provide critical information as to how long it takes infected pigs to recover from either virus infection, and how the infection affects overall lean accretion. Therefore, our objective was to compare and determine how these 2 coronaviruses modulate nursery pig growth performance and tissue accretion rates over a 6 wk period.",

Briefly, all pigs were fasted overnight prior to scanning and the designated 24 body composition pigs were then removed from their pens, anesthetized via intramuscular injection with telazol:ketamine:xylozene (2:1:2; 4.4 mg/kg BW and 2.2 mg/kg BW, respectively) at a dosage rate of 1 mL per 45.5 kg BW. Anesthetized pigs were placed on the DXA scan table in sternal recumbancy with fore and hind legs extended. Once scanned, pigs were allowed to recover and then returned to their pens. The DXA output provided information on whole body bone, fat, and lean tissue mass. Scan data was corrected for gut fill and blood volume using internally built calibration curves for pigs using the following regressions: Live weight, y = 1.0822x-1.826, R2 = 0.9970; Fat, y = 0.9515x-1.06, R2 = 0.9308; Bone mineral ash, y = 2.1473x-0.1411, R2 = 0.9219; Lean, y = 1.0668x-0.1411, R2 = 0.9909; Protein, y = 0.2206x-0.6611, R2 = 0.9758; where x = DXA results and y = chemical proximate on an empty whole body (i.e., no luminal, urine or gall bladder contents).

In weaned pigs, PRRSV infection has also been shown to decrease ADFI and G:F ratios within the first 14 dpi compared with negative pigs (Rochell et al., 2015).

In suckling pigs (\u223c2 kg BW), viral shedding was variable where some pigs began to shed virus at dpi 2 and others at dpi 5 (Chen et al., 2015). Ma et al.

This information, along with published performance data of PEDV and PDCoV infected pigs (Kim and Lee, 2014; Chen et al., 2015; Ma et al., 2015; Schweer et al., 2015), led us to expect a reduction in ADG, ADFI, and G:F in pigs inoculated with either PEDV or PDCoV. Pigs inoculated with PEDV have been reported to have severe reductions in ADG (-18 g/d) compared to their negative counterparts (27 g/d) after 7 dpi (Kim and Lee, 2014). In pigs that were similar in size to our current study and inoculated with the same PEDV strain, there was a 29% decrease in ADFI for PEDV pigs compared with negative pigs (Schweer et al., 2015) which was similar to the 23% reduction during dpi 0 to 7 which was not statistically significant in the current study. However, this paper reported a 47 and 28% reductions in ADG and G:F, respectively, of pigs inoculated with PEDV which was less than our observed reduction of 78 and 58%, for ADG and G:F, respectively, during dpi 0 to 7.

However, there have been reports of ADG and BW changes due to PDCoV challenges. Chen et al. (2015) inoculated 5-d old pigs with 10 mL of 3 \u00d7 103 TCID50/mL of a cell culture isolate of PDCoV (USA/IL/2014), and reported that after dpi 4 and 7, PDCoV pigs did not differ in BW or ADG compared with negative pigs. However, in 10 d-old pigs, Ma et al. (2015) observed a 10 to 15% reduction in BW of pigs inoculated with 106 PFU of PDCoV, MI strain compared with negative pigs after dpi 10. We did not observe a difference in ADG or G:F of PDCoV pigs compared with Control pigs. As with PEDV, these differences may be due to strain of PDCoV used, virulence of inoculum, age, genetics, housing conditions, or health status. For both PEDV and PDCoV, we did not observe any differences in growth performance after dpi 21 compared with Control pigs. This indicates that pigs infected with either of these viruses at this BW can recover and begin to perform similar to their negative counterparts. However, the initial impact of PEDV on ADFI and ADG will increase the number of d to reach a desirable final market weight compared to negative pigs.",

In our study, we determined that PEDV decreased lean, protein, fat, and BMC accretion compared with Control pigs over a 6 wk period, but PDCoV did not differ from the Control pigs. There are few published studies on the effect of an immune challenge on whole body composition and tissue accretion of pigs (Escobar et al., 2002; Escobar et al., 2004; Gabler et al., 2013). Escobar et al. (2002 and 2004) used the serial slaughter technique to determine whole body composition and calculated tissue accretion rates. After 7 d of PRRSV infection in 4 wk-old pigs, there was a 41 and 63% reduction in protein and lipid accretion, respectively, compared with negative pigs (Escobar et al., 2004). After 80 d of PRRSV infection in pigs (start BW = 33 kg), there was a 14% reduction in lean and protein accretion and an 18% reduction in fat accretion compared with negative pigs (Gabler et al., 2013). These studies show that PRRSV not only impacts short-term tissue accretion, but also reduces tissue accretion long-term. Peak viremia of PRRSV is usually within 7 d after inoculation (Johnson et al., 2004; Islam et al., 2013) and reduced feed intake is observed within dpi 0 to 14 (Schweer et al., 2015) which may explain a bigger reduction in tissue accretion during a shorter time period after onset of infection. During an immune challenge, there is a demand for energy and nutrients at a time that is coupled with reduced feed intake. This situation may cause mobilization of AA and FA from muscle and adipose, respectively, thus altering body composition. Pigs inoculated with PEDV had severe reductions in ADFI within and began to perform similar to Control pigs after dpi 21, but we still observed reductions in tissue accretion over 42 d for PEDV pigs.",

In 26-d old pigs, immune stimulation, as initiated by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) injection, increased circulating total AA concentrations during the fasted state (Orellana et al., 2012). In rotavirus-infected pigs, total circulating AA concentrations were also increased during the fed state (Rhoads et al., 2007). Increasing circulating AA concentration during an immune stimulation indicates that the body is repartitioning its AA pool to tissues in need of AA and one of the major AA pools in the body is muscle. In fasted 7-d and 26-d old piglets, LPS injection was used to determine severity of muscle degradation during systemic inflammation (Orellana et al., 2012). Despite the high protein turnover rate in 7-d old piglets compared with 26-d old piglets (Davis and Fiorotto, 2009), both age groups had increased abundance of proteins involved with skeletal muscle degradation including: NF-\u03d7B, caspase 3, AMPK, E3 ligases (MuRF1 and atrogin1), and cleaved \u0251-actin, a result of muscle proteolysis.",

            "text": "Enteric infections have been shown to modulate protein synthesis machinery in a tissue dependent manner (Rhoads et al., 2007). One of the main pathways involved in protein synthesis is the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway. This pathway is regulated by many inputs including energy and amino acid status, stress, and growth factors. Two proteins downstream of mTOR that are thought to be involved in the initiation of protein synthesis are p70s6k and its downstream target ribosomal protein S6. In rotavirus-challenged 4-d old pigs, protein abundance of total and activated (phosphorylated) p70S6K were increased during peak infection in the jejunum compared to negative pigs (Rhoads et al., 2007). In that study, another group of pigs was rotavirus-infected and malnourished by diluting the complete formula by 50% with an electrolyte solution. Regardless of having reduced energy intake, the malnourished-infected pigs also had increased protein abundance of total and activated (phosphorylated) p70S6K in the jejunum. However, in the muscle of both infected groups, there was a reduction of total S6 protein during peak infection compared to healthy controls. A reduction in protein synthesis in the muscle agrees with the current study that there was a decrease in protein accretion in PEDV pigs. The degradation occurring in the muscle most likely is due to the increased demand of AA in the intestine to aid in recovery of the epithelium. This indicates that the effects of enteric challenges are not driven by reduced feed intake alone, but there are post-absorptive changes during an enteric challenge that can lead to changes in body composition due to metabolic shifts within tissues.",
