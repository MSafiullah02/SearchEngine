Two patients had fever and dry cough, whereas the rest of 3 patients were asymptomatic. Three patients had unilateral ground glass opacities with or without consolidation in the subpleural region on highresolution chest CT, 1 patient had bilateral ground glass opacities, and 1 patient was negative for CT. We note that up to 66.7% asymptomatic patients had pulmonary lesions, so the asymptomatic children with Wuhan contact are recommended to do a 2019 novel coronavirus realtime fluorescence polymerase chain reaction screening. Unlike adult patients, only a small amount of patients had multilobes affected, so we speculate that the pediatric patients generally have milder CT findings than adults. FIGURE 2.

Two patients (case 1 and 3) in our study were symptomatic, both of them had fever and dry cough, and one of them had diarrhea in addition. Thus, fever and dry cough are 2 core symptoms of pediatric patients, which is in line with the adults. 4 However, up to 60% of the patients (case 2, 4, and 5) in the present study were asymptomatic, so the asymptomatic children with Wuhan contact (lived or traveled to Wuhan or had close contact with any confirmed patients) are recommended to do a COVID-19 RT-PCR screening. Besides, we noted that up to 66.7% asymptomatic patients (case 2 and 4) had pulmonary GGO, so asymptomatic pediatric patients may be positive for HRCT, and thus, HRCT is recommended in the screening of suspected pediatric patients.",

It is reported that up to 44% adult patients had all 5 lobes affected, 1 whereas only 1 patient (case 2) in the present study affected bilaterally, and 3 patients just affected 1 lobe. The HRCT manifestations of adult patients with COVID-19 were reported to be very diverse 1-3 : most appeared as pure GGO, GGO with consolidation, interlobular septal thickening, bronchiolar wall thickening, and crazy paving pattern, whereas rare manifestations included halo sign, pleural effusion, pericardial effusion, and lymphadenopathy. In our series of pediatric patients, only GGO and consolidative GGO were found. Pan et al 5 studied the time course of lung changes of adult COVID-19 patients and concluded that lung lesions would gradually be absorbed in 2 weeks. On the contrary, most lesions in our study were fully resolved in a week. Furthermore, Song et al 3 divided the adult patients with COVID-19 to younger (<50 years) and elder group (>50 years) and found that elder group tended to have more areas of lung involvement and more consolidation. Taking their evidence together, we speculate that the pediatric patients generally have milder CT findings than adults.",
