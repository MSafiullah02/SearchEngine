            "text": "The term autophagy comes from the Greek words \u201cphagy\u201d meaning eat and \u201cauto\u201d meaning self. Autophagy is an evolutionarily highly conserved self-digestive process in response to environmental stress to eukaryotic cells, by which cytoplasmic components such as defective/damaged or redundant organelles or protein aggregates are delivered to the lysosome for recycling and degradation. There is convincing evidence indicating that activation of the autophagic process is promoted by MAMPs and/or DAMPs [2, 3]. In more simple words, autophagy is a classical cell-protective and cell-autonomous process of the innate immune system aimed at maintaining and restoring homeostasis at both the cellular (cell-intrinsic) and organismal (cell-extrinsic) level [4]. Although autophagy was initially identified in mammals, a significant breakthrough in our understanding of how autophagy is controlled came from the analysis in the genetically tractable yeast system. Pioneering work from Ohsumi\u2019s group showed that the morphology of autophagy in yeast was similar to that documented in mammals [5]. (As known, Ohsumi received the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 2016.) In fact, the discovery of the autophagy-related genes in yeast has significantly advanced the understanding of the molecular mechanisms participating in autophagy and the genes involved in regulating the autophagic pathway. Many yeast genes have mammalian homologues, confirming that the basic machinery for autophagy has been evolutionarily conserved along the eukaryotic phylum [6\u20139].",

The 26S proteasome that is present in the cytoplasm and nucleus is usually formed by one 20S proteasome complex and two 19S proteasome complexes, which are composed of proteases and structural units. The 26S proteasome is a giant protease responsible for the regulated degradation of polyubiquitylated proteins (see Box 18.2). It consists of at least 33 distinct subunits and is arranged into two modules: core particle containing catalytic sites and regulatory particles. The cylinder-shaped proteolytic core is the 20S core particle, which is capped at one or both ends by 19S regulatory particles.",

The Rieske iron\u2013sulfur protein is an essential subunit of mitochondrial cytochrome bc1 complexes and, like the majority of mitochondrial proteins, is encoded by a nuclear gene and synthesized on cytoplasmic ribosomes as a precursor with a 32-residue amino-terminal extension. The iron\u2013sulfur protein is then post-translationally imported into the mitochondria where it is inserted into the bc1 complex in the inner mitochondrial membrane. At first, the precursor is translocated via translocation contact sites into the matrix. There, cleavage to an intermediate containing an 8-residue extension occurs. The intermediate is then redirected across the inner membrane, processed to the mature subunit, and assembled into complex III.",

In its simplest form, ubiquitin can be attached to the target protein as a single moiety resulting in monoubiquitination. Ubiquitin itself can be ubiquitinated, resulting in the formation of ubiquitin chains attached to the target protein: polyubiquitination. Polyubiquitination of proteins is the triggering signal that leads to subsequent degradation of the protein in the proteasome. Ligases play a central role in polyubiquitination. Ligases are enzymes that catalyze the synthesis of polyubiquitin chains. Ubiquitin conjugation requires typically three classes of enzymes. E1 (ubiquitin-activating enzyme) hydrolyzes ATP and forms a thioester-linked complex between itself and ubiquitin. E2 (ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme) receives ubiquitin from E1 and forms a similar thioester-linked intermediate with ubiquitin. E3 (ubiquitin ligase) finally binds both the E2 and a substrate and catalyzes the transfer of ubiquitin to the substrate. Ubiquitin itself is often a substrate for further ubiquitylation, which results in the formation of so-called polyubiquitin chains. Ubiquitin has seven lysine residues, and depending on the lysine residue used for ubiquitin\u2013ubiquitin chain formation, the polyubiquitin chain can signal different functions. Proteins modified by lysine-48 (K48)- or lysine-29 (K29)-linked chains are usually degraded by the proteasome. In contrast, modification by K63-linked chains or by a single ubiquitin moiety (monoubiquitylation) seems to trigger other functions, e.g., protein sorting, gene expression, and DNA repair.",

In more detail, the process begins with the formation of a membrane of unknown origin, the initial phagophore or isolation membrane. The phagophore then expands, surrounds proteins or organelles, sequesters cytoplasm, and, on completion, develops into a large double-membrane transport vesicle, the autophagosome. Subsequently, the autophagosome fuses with a lysosome containing acid hydrolases and releases its contents into the lytic acid hydrolases-containing compartment as part of single-membrane vesicles, termed autophagic bodies. The fused compartment where the autophagic body and its contents are degraded is called an autophagolysosome or autolysosome (Fig. 18.1). Notably, the process of phagophore expansion provides tremendous flexibility and capacity with regard to cargo, allowing entire organelles to be deleted via autophagy; however, this flexibility also means that autophagy must be tightly controlled in order to prevent inappropriate degradation, which could lead to cell death (for relevant papers, see [6\u20139, 14\u201316].",

The biogenesis of autophagosomes needs the ordered intervention of autophagy-regulated (ATG) proteins that act on different modules. Thus, more than 30 ATG genes have been identified in human that orchestrate the complex membrane dynamics involved in autophagic sequestration. These ATG proteins act sequentially in three macromolecular complexes involved in the three successive stages of autophagy. Initiation of autophagy requires the UNC-51-like kinase 1 (ULK1)-ATG13-FIP200 (also known as RB1-inducible coiled-coil 1) complex, whereby the kinase activity of ULK1 is controlled by the kinase mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) in mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1), which is sensitive to rapamycin [9]. The next process, membrane nucleation, requires the Beclin1/class III PI3K complex, which also plays a major role in membrane trafficking and restructuring involved in autophagy [15, 17]; the final process refers to the elongation, expansion, and closure of the phagophore membrane/autophagosome which mainly relies on ATG8/microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC3) lipidation. In fact, ATG8/LC3 lipidation is regarded as a hallmark of autophagy and is established by a covalent linkage of cytosolic LC3 to the lipid phosphatidylethanolamine on the surface of the autophagosome [7, 9].",

Though microautophagy is the least studied form of autophagy, a molecular signature of the process has begun to emerge and has led to the definition of microautophagy as a type of autophagy in which the cargo is directly internalized in small vesicles that form at the surface of the lysosome/vacuole or late endosomes (multivesicular bodies), respectively [10].",

Also, and of high interest, in a clinical study on patients with chronic hepatitis B, HMGB1-induced autophagy was found to maintain Treg function during chronic viral infection [49]. Moreover, in studies on a mini pig lung IRI model, evidence was provided indicating that autophagy, when triggered by DAMPs such as HMGB1 and HSP60 during IRI, amplifies the inflammatory response through enhancing K63-linked ubiquitination of TRAF6 and activation of the downstream MAPK and NF-\u03baB signalling (for TRAF6, MAPK, and NF-\u03baB signalling, see Part VI, Sect. 10.1007/978-3-319-78655-1_22).",

In this context, as stressed by Galluzzi et al.

In view of these facts and findings, these authors recommend to favor genetic approaches and to test the involvement of at least two different proteins of the macroautophagy apparatus in a specific instance of RCD before etiologically attributing it to macroautophagy.",

To understand any discussion on a role of ROS in host defense or human diseases, one should define free radicals. According to Halliwell and Gutteridge [58], \u201ca free radical is any species capable of independent existence that contains 1 or more unpaired electrons.\u201d An unpaired electron is one that occupies an atomic or molecular orbital by itself. Radicals can be formed by the loss of a single electron from a non-radical, or by the gain of a single electron by a non-radical. In this sense, superoxide anions (O2\n\u00b7\u2212), hydroxyl radicals (\u00b7OH), peroxyl radicals (RO2\n\u00b7), and alkoxyl radicals (RO\u02d9) are oxygen radicals. Of note, ROS is a collective term often used by scientists to include not only the oxygen radicals but also some non-radical derivatives of oxygen such as H2O2, hypochlorous acid (HOCl), ozone (O3), and singlet oxygen (1O2). Nitrogen-containing oxidants, such as NO\u00b7 are called RNS. Generation of ROS is generally a cascade of reactions that starts with the production of superoxide anions. Superoxide rapidly dismutases to H2O2 either spontaneously (especially at the low pH) or catalyzed by SOD. Other elements in the cascade of ROS generation include the reaction of superoxide with NO to form the very toxic peroxynitrite, the peroxidase-catalyzed formation of HOCl from H2O2, and the iron-catalyzed Fenton reaction, leading to the generation of hydroxyl radical.",

            "text": "The NADPH oxidases were initially considered as enzymes expressed only in phagocytic cells involved in host defense and innate immunity; however, recent evidence indicates that there is an entire family of NOXes based on the discovery of gp91phox homologues. The family comprises seven members, including NOX1, NOX2 (formerly termed gp91phox), NOX3, NOX4, NOX5, DUOX1, and DUOX2 [63]. Three members out of the enzyme family are important sources of ROS in the vasculature, namely, NOX1, NOX2, and NOX4 [64\u201366]. Today, NOXes are perhaps the best-studied enzymes involved in ROS production in the blood vessels. Remarkably, different members of the NOX/DUOX family engaged in IRI are localized in various cells, that is, in vascular cells and phagocytes. This may lead to the notion that NOXes in vascular cells are responsible for the first wave of ROS production because vascular cells are first confronted with reintroduced molecular oxygen. As generally believed, there is, in fact, no vascular specific NOX isoform but rather a complex expression of various NOX isoforms in different cells and regions of the vascular system. Nevertheless, in arteries from humans and animals, NOX2, NOX4, and a shallow level of NOX1 have been consistently found to be present both as messenger RNA and as protein [63]. Altogether, the findings and data briefly described here make clear that vascular cells are equipped with efficient machinery able to efficiently produce ROS. Regarding the different enzymatic sources, superoxide radicals appear to be predominantly generated compared, for example, to hydroxyl radicals.",

            "text": "Mitochondria have been implicated as potential oxygen sensors by increasing the generation of ROS which regulate a variety of hypoxic responses [67\u201370]. In fact, mitochondria are increasingly recognized as lynchpins in the evolution of tissue injury during postischemic reperfusion. It is generally acknowledged that the majority of intracellular ROS production is generated in the mitochondrial ETC and its associated metabolic enzymes. However, very little is known about which mitochondrial sites are involved in physiological or pathological ROS production under native conditions. Of note, using inhibitors to manipulate the redox states of particular sites and prevent superoxide generation from others, at least ten different locations of superoxide/H2O2 production in the ETC and associated enzymes (Krebs cycle, \u03b2-oxidation, etc.) have been identified in mammalian mitochondria. In fact, the relative and absolute contributions of specific sites to the production of ROS in isolated mitochondria depend very strongly on the substrates being oxidized, and the same is likely valid in cells and in vivo [71]. For example, superoxide formation occurs on the outer mitochondrial membrane, in the matrix, and on both sides of the inner mitochondrial membrane (Fig. 18.3). Complex I (NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase) accepts electrons from NADH; these electrons are carried to complex II (the succinate dehydrogenase-CoQ oxidoreductase), where they are used to oxidize succinate to fumarate. Afterward, electrons continue to travel down their electrochemical gradient to complex III (the cytochrome bc1 complex (ubiquinol-cytochrome c oxidoreductase)), and subsequently to complex IV (cytochrome c oxidase); finally, the electrons are used to reduce molecular oxygen to water. Thus, complex I and complex II oxidize the energy-rich molecules NADH and flavin adenine dinucleotide H2, respectively, and then transfer the resulting electrons to ubiquinol that carries it up to complex III (for competent articles, see [72, 73]).",

Regarding complex I, it was recently demonstrated that inhibition of ND5, a subunit of complex I, suppresses the activity of this complex and thus ROS production [74]. Furthermore, data from another set of studies on complex I showed that stable down-modulation of its subunits GRIM-19 and NDUFS3 decreased complex I activity that was associated with a significant reduction in the overall NADH oxidation rate but with an increased production of ROS by the target cells [75]. Similar results have been found in studies on complex II: there is evidence suggesting that inhibition of complex II on the level of subunits even leads to an increase in ROS production. The phenomena can be explained by assuming that, if electrons provided in the course of the ETC cannot efficiently be transferred to the next complex, they would leak out from the inhibited complex and generate ROS [76].",

Thus, it was shown that RISP promotes the hypoxic stabilization of the transcription factor HIF-1\u03b1 protein [77] and UQCRB was found to mediate hypoxia-induced tumor angiogenesis via mitochondrial ROS-mediated signalling [78, 79]. Also, and of note, a mouse model to permit conditional deletion of the nuclear-encoded RISP gene was recently developed to assess its role in hypoxia-induced ROS signalling in the pulmonary circulation [80]. It was found that depletion of RISP abolishes the ROS response to hypoxia in isolated pulmonary arterial SMCs and isolated pulmonary artery segments. Further, in this article, it was discussed that mitochondria are not the only source of ROS during hypoxia. Thus, studies using a genetic knockout of p47phox suggested that cytosolic NADPH oxidase systems may also contribute to a hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction response during acute hypoxia [81, 82]. According to the authors\u2019 conclusion, the blockade of hypoxia-induced ROS responses (in these studies observed with depletion of RISP) suggests that the mitochondria may act as the initiators of ROS production, which could be amplified by engagement of NADPH oxidase systems elsewhere in the cell. Such \u201cROS-induced ROS release\u201d might permit small ROS signals generated by mitochondria to activate ROS signalling throughout the cell, thereby avoiding mitochondrial damage that might arise if the entire cellular oxidant signal originated from that organelle [83] (or even leading to excessive ROS production?).",

As a fourth defense system, the antioxidant nutrients such as vitamins E and C as well as carotenoids were appreciated [84]. It was generally accepted that the first line of enzymes is of enormous importance in limiting ROS-mediated damage to intracellular macromolecules. For example, among the most important regulators of ROS levels were the SOD enzymes: Cu/ZnSOD in the cytoplasm and outer mitochondrial space and MnSOD exclusively in the inner mitochondrial space. Mechanistically, superoxide is converted to H2O2 and oxygen (O2\n\u00b7\u2212 + O2\n\u00b7\u2212 + 2H+ \u2192 H2O2 +  O2) by SOD. Peroxiredoxins and abundant catalase enzyme then scavenge H2O2, converting it to molecular oxygen and water. Another example of a first-line defense molecule is TRX. Thioredoxin contains two adjacent \u2013SH groups in its reduced form which are converted to a disulfide in oxidized TRX. Notably, it can undergo redox reactions with multiple proteins using the reaction TRX  (SH)2 + protein \u2212 S2 \u2194 TRX \u2212 S2 + protein \u2212 (SH)2.",

Because certain compounds of the chemicals generated after an interaction of ROS with macromolecules are highly reactive, there must be an equal necessity to detoxify these secondary oxidation products to prevent them from also damaging DNA, proteins, and lipids. Without the adequate detoxification of such products, an extended chain reaction will occur resulting in the degradation of cellular components and the ultimate death of the cell. This second line of defense against ROS is provided by those detoxifying enzymes.

In this scenario, Keap1 homodimer binds to a single Nrf2 protein via a high-affinity so-called \u201cETGE\u201d motif and low-affinity so-called \u201cDLG\u201d motif. The two-site recognition of Nrf2 by the Keap1 dimer is essential for polyubiquitination of Nrf2 (also see Part II, Sect. 10.1007/978-3-319-78655-1_5) (for polyubiquitination, see Box 18.2). In this sense, the Keap1 \u2194 Nrf2 system can be regarded as a vital part of regulating cells under a homeostatic environment. However, in case of dangerous and threatening oxidative (and xenobiotic) stress, the system instigates a stress response that is characterized by a rapid and dramatic cessation of the Keap1-dependent polyubiquitination process resulting in a rapid increase of Nrf2 abundance. In fact, exposure to ROS-mediated stress (or electrophilic stress) is thought to modify the reactive \u201cIIC-4 DAMPs-sensing\u201d cysteine residues in Keap1, which is associated with a conformational change of the protein resulting in a loss of Keap1 ubiquitination activity (Fig. 18.4). Notably, as a cysteine-rich protein, the human Keap1 possesses 27 cysteine residues, and they are all reactive to stress to varying degrees. Among these sensor cysteines of Keap1, C151 is best characterized. Evidence from a number of studies has suggested that C151 is the most reactive and critical to the Keap1 \u2194 Nrf2 stress-sensing response. Even, there is already evidence from a first atomic-level view suggesting that the unique environment of Cys 151 (besides Cys171, Cys273, and Cys288) appears to be the critical residue of Keap1 responsible for detecting increased levels of oxidative stress [91, 92, 97].",

Instead, newly synthesized Nrf2 is translocated to the nucleus to trigger the transcription of Nrf2-dependent genes. The other model denoted as the \u201cconformation cycling\u201d model claims that Keap1 uses a cyclic mechanism to target Nrf2 for polyubiquitination and proteasomal degradation.

Thus, oxidative stress is known to contribute to many pathological conditions, including cancer, neurological disorders, atherosclerosis, hypertension, ARDS, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, just to mention a few of them. Plausibly, these disorders are motivation enough to search for new effective therapeutic options by harnessing the new insights into mechanisms of the Keap1 \u2194 Nrf2 system.

Thanks to this property, they form a chaperone network involved in correct protein folding, trafficking, and complex assembly (for reviews, see [103\u2013109]). In order to be released from engagement with proteins after folding and take part in further rounds of activity, HSP70 and other chaperones utilize an intrinsic ATPase domain to hydrolyze ATP and assume a free conformation [110].

Interestingly, a recent study in support of these earlier findings provided evidence of the existence of a plasma membrane-dependent mechanism of HSF1 activation in animal cells, which is initiated by specific membrane-dependent TRPV calcium channel-like receptors [130]. These findings lend support to the notion that heat sensing and signalling in mammalian cells are dependent on TRPV channels, suggesting that these receptors may act as a major HSR sensor in different epithelial non-cancerous and cancerous cells, capable of triggering the cellular HSR [130]. In another line of experiments, TRPV2 was demonstrated to mediate the effects of transient heat shock on endocytosis of human monocyte-derived DCs, suggesting a central role of TRPV2 in mediating the cellular action of heat shock on these important cells of the innate immune system [131] (for TRPV channel receptors, also compare Part II, Sect. 10.1007/978-3-319-78655-1_5).",

            "text": "To cope with ER stress, cells have the unique possibility to activate the UPR, a dynamic signalling network that orchestrates the recovery of homeostasis or triggers RCD modalities, depending on the level of damage. Perception of any perturbation of the ER is provided by three sensor molecules of the UPR embedded in the ER membrane: the PERK, IRE-1, and ATF6. The UPR-mediated recovery of ER homeostasis mainly occurs through the PERK-eIF2\u03b1-mediated temporary shutdown of protein translation and the activation of a complex genetic program that aims to improve ER quality control and adaptive responses [140\u2013143] (Fig. 18.6). Accordingly, PERK, devoted to perceiving dyshomeostatic DAMP- emitting ER perturbations (so far, no clear evidence for IRE-1 and ATF6 in this respect), may be regarded as a new family of non-classical PRMs, at least in a broader sense. In non-stressed conditions, the three sensors of the ER homeostasis are kept in an inactive state by the ER-luminal binding immunoglobulin protein (BiP). The protein BiP, also known as glucose regulated protein 78 (GRP78), is a member of the HSP70 family of proteins (specifically HSPA5). It functions as a chaperone to selectively bind unfolded proteins in the ER lumen by interacting with exposed hydrophobic residues on nascent peptides [151]. However, in conditions of ER stress, BiP is detached from these sensors allowing their activation to trigger pathways, collectively included in the term of UPR. This stress response acts as a corrective path, capable of both increasing the ER folding capacity and decreasing the incoming polypeptide load.",

Moreover, as reviewed [152], upon dissociating from BiP, each of the three sensors modifies the ER to mitigate stress in its own unique way. For example, ATF6 is often the first sensor to respond to ER stress. Once ATF6 dissociates from BiP, it is translocated to the Golgi apparatus for cleavage. The cytosolic domain of ATF6 is then free to move to the nucleus, where it moderates increased expression of several proteins involved in lipid biosynthesis and chaperones. This allows an increase in the volume of the ER and provides more chaperone proteins to aid in folding, thus relieving some of the ER stress. The other two sensors, IRE-1 and PERK, remain as integral ER proteins but oligomerize and autophosphorylate following BiP disassociation (autophosphorylation, a type of post-translational modification of proteins (see Part VI, Sect. 10.1007/978-3-319-78655-1_24); typical for this biochemical process, a phosphate is added to a protein kinase by itself).",

            "text": "Strikingly, there is a considerable interconnectedness of the ER stress-promoted UPR with other innate immune processes. For example, an increasing number of studies support the view that oxidative stress has a strong connection with ER stress. During the protein folding process, ROS are produced as by-products, leading to impaired redox balance conferring oxidative stress. As the protein folding process is dependent on redox homeostasis, the oxidative stress can disrupt the protein folding mechanism and facilitate the production of misfolded proteins, causing further ER stress [163]. Moreover, this stress response functions as a productive source of DAMPs. Typically, HSPs and CALR, like other ER chaperones, can translocate to the cytosol and eventually to the surface of cells. Once exposed, these molecules can operate as Subclass IB-1 DAMPs to facilitate engulfment of antigens as mostly described in the context of induction of ICD [148, 164\u2013168]. Via these mechanisms and by crosstalk with other molecular machines of the innate immune system including NLRP3 inflammasome activation via TXNIP (see Part IV, Sect. 10.1007/978-3-319-78655-1_13 and Part VI, Sect. 10.1007/978-3-319-78655-1_22), the UPR may contribute to sterile inflammation and immunity (for articles, see Refs [153\u2013157, 169\u2013172]). Also, several signalling cascades triggered by the three sensors are apparently potent inducers of autophagy at a cell-wide level that\u2014as mentioned above\u2014normally has an adaptive/protective function and consists of the three major types: chaperone-mediated, macro- and microautophagy. Interestingly, recent evidence has indicated that UPR-induced autophagic processes are capable of alleviating the UPR pointing to a crosstalk between these two innate immune defense mechanisms [173, 174]. Strikingly, a complex relationship reportedly exists between autophagy and DAMPs in cellular adaption to stress and injury and cell death characterized by a crosstalk between autophagy induction and secretion or release of DAMPs. In fact, growing evidence indicates that autophagic mechanisms are involved in regulating release and degradation of DAMPs including CALR, HMGB1, ATP, and DNA in several cell types [37, 148, 175]. This scenario may contribute to the observation that autophagy is also able to shape a supportive cellular immune response [176, 177]. This kind of innate immune interrelationships is, for example, involved in mechanisms of both reperfusion-mediated cell injury and ICD of cancer cells (see Refs [40, 178\u2013190]).",

However, the outcome is not always in favor of the host; the pathogen may also profit from this stress response, at least under certain circumstances. An increasing number of reports have recently been published on this emerging topic (such as Refs [192\u2013197]), the quintessence briefly being addressed here.",

The central mechanisms of perturbation of the ER during virus infection can be seen in the production of large amounts of viral proteins by the virus concerned. Such accumulation of viral proteins in the ER implies a challenge to the protein folding machinery which may cause ER stress and, in turn, activate the UPR resulting in restoration of the ER homeostasis or apoptosis. So far, at least 36 viruses have been found to be able to induce ER stress and activate the three UPR stress signalling pathways [198]. Moreover, ER stress can be caused by viruses via other mechanisms, for example, as a result of ER membrane exploitation, imbalance of calcium concentration, or sabotage/depletion of the ER membrane during virion release.",

For example, the PERK-mediated global translation shutdown is a very efficient antiviral mechanism, and a similar shutdown by PKR has been used in the interferon pathway to defend against viral infection [199]. Also, the virus-related UPR was found to trigger host inflammatory signalling cascade through innate immune signalling pathways that activate NF-\u03baB and AP-1 transcription factors as a result of chronic ER stress. In fact, overexpression of viral proteins in the ER has long been known to activate these transcription factors which induce expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6 [200, 201]. Increasing evidence supports the notion that the UPR signalling synergistically interacts with virus-induced signalling to produce inflammatory cytokines and type I IFNs. In addition, other lines of studies have shed light on a role of NOD1 and NOD2 receptors in transducing virus-related ER stress signals to elicit inflammation [197]. So far, however, a possible contribution of DAMPs to the promotion of these signalling pathways has not been investigated.",

In particular, the link between the UPR and autophagy are intensely discussed to be involved in this scenario. These two systems may act dependently, or the induction of one system may interfere with the other [202]. Thus, experimental studies could demonstrate that different viruses modulate these mechanisms to allow them to circumvent and bypass the host immune response or, worse, to exploit the host\u2019s defense to their advantage. According to current knowledge, RNA viruses including influenza virus, poliovirus, coxsackievirus, enterovirus, Japanese encephalitis virus, HCV, and dengue virus were shown to regulate these processes. For example, recent studies on HCV-infected hepatocytes confirmed the evidence that virus-associated ER stress and UPR are linked to cellular autophagy. Thus, induction of the cellular autophagic response is reportedly required to improve survival of infected cells by inhibition of cellular apoptosis. Moreover, the autophagic response was demonstrated to inhibit the cellular innate antiviral program that usually inhibits virus replication.

Following recognition, MRN recruits ATM to this DNA lesion where it binds to the C-terminus of NBS1 as a component of MRN [230]. Following binding, ATM kinase is activated. However, the exact mechanism whereby MRN activates ATM is still not fully understood (discussed in [226]). Recognition of DSBs is also realized by Ku70/80 heterodimer that has been shown to bind broken dsDNA ends preferentially [231]. It is the Ku70/80 then that recruits the catalytic subunit of DNA-PK (DNA-PKcs) at the site of DSBs to form the DNA-PK holoenzyme. The major role of activated DNA-PK is to promote a peculiar DNA repair mechanism called non-homologous end joining (NHEJ), a pathway that repairs double-strand breaks in DNA [231]. In fact, NHEJ repairs most DSBs in mammalian cells. As its name implies, NHEJ involves ligation of two broken DNA ends without needing a repair template [232].",

In fact, first evidence suggests that ssDNA is initially sensed by RPA which then recruits and activates PRP19 [229].

Perception of any perturbation of the ER is provided by three sensor molecules of the unfolded protein response embedded in the ER membrane: the PERK, IRE-1, and ATF6. PERK perceives dyshomeostatic DAMP (Subclass IIC-4 DAMP)\u2014emitting ER perturbations (IRE1 and ATF6 still questionable). PERK phosphorylates eIF2a to up-regulate transcription factor ATF4 that induces the expression of transcription factor CHOP. IRE1a signals through its RNase via the splicing of XBP1 mRNA. The active transcription factor XBP1s translocates to the nucleus. ATF6 is exported from the ER to the Golgi complex to enter the nucleus as a potent transcription factor. Together, these transcription factors of the unfolded protein response determine the cell fate by the regulation of distinct subsets of target genes toward recovery of ER homeostasis and cell survival or the induction of regulated cell death in form of apoptosis and ferroptosis. In addition, the transcription factor ATF4 is differentially translated, up-regulating genes participating in autophagy and other homeostatic pathways.

In response to DNA damage, the three phosphoinositide 3-kinase-related kinases are recruited and activated. DNA-PKcs is recruited and activated by Ku-bound DSB ends; ATM is recruited and activated by DSBs through the MRN complex; ATR is recruited to RPA-coated ssDNA by its stable binding partner ATRIP. The cellular response to damage may involve activation of a cell cycle checkpoint, commencement of transcriptional programs, execution of DNA repair, or, when the damage is too severe, initiation of apoptosis. Upon sensing DNA damage, cell cycle checkpoints are activated to arrest cell cycle progression to allow time for repair before the damage is passed on to the cell.
