In this scenario of multiple viruses causing the same spectrum of disease, diagnostic tests are helpful for identifying possible etiologies, which may ultimately help target prevention and treatment strategies. In addition to the agent, the host also plays an important role in determining outcomes.4, 5\n",

Identification of this special population by health care professionals along with fast diagnosis of the viral nature of the disease, allow a more aggressive approach that may help to reduce morbidity and mortality in this group. Recent changes in Brazil, with broader access of the available prevention tools, through directed programs for high-risk population, will probably result in the reduction of severe respiratory infections in children. Future studies evaluating this new scenario are necessary to confirm the positive impact of these prophylaxes.",
