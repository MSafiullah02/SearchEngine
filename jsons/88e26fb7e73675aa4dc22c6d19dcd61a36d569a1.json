Like other Reoviridae members, reoviruses are nonenveloped, icosahedral particles that contain a segmented, double-stranded (ds) RNA genome surrounded by concentric protein shells (Schiff et al. 2007 ). These viruses are ubiquitous and display a broad host range, resulting in infection of wide variety of mammals including humans (Virgin et al. 1997) . However, reovirus causes disease primarily in the very young (Mann et al. 2002; Tardieu et al. 1983; Tyler et al. 2004 ). These viruses have served in some respects as prototypes for the study of the Reoviridae due to the availability of isolates that display dissimilar phenotypes, the ability to perform genetic analysis using reassortant viruses and reverse genetics, and the existence of a murine model of virus-induced disease.",

Delivery of this rather large cargo ($70 nm in diameter) requires an exquisitely timed and regulated series of events both at the host cell surface and within host endosomes. The virus must attach to host cells, internalize and traffic to cellular endosomes, undergo proteolytic disassembly to expose the viral membrane-penetration apparatus, and penetrate host cell membranes for delivery of the viral core into the cytoplasm. These early events during reovirus infection activate innate immune signaling pathways. Here, we describe our current understanding of each of these steps in the cell entry pathway used by reovirus.",

            "text": "Reovirus particles are approximately 850 \u00c5 in diameter and consist of two concentric protein shells, the inner core and outer capsid (Dryden et al. 1993; Schiff et al. 2007 ) (Fig. 1) . The reovirus genome consists of ten segments of dsRNA, which range in length from $1.2 to $3.9 kilobases. The genome segments are named based on size, with three large (L), three medium (M), and four small (S) segments. Reovirus proteins are designated according to the encoding gene segments, lambda (l) for L, mu (m) for M, and sigma (s) for S. The reovirus inner core has T \u00bc 1 symmetry and is primarily formed by a shell of 60 asymmetric dimers of l1 and 150 monomers of s2 . Pentameric turrets of l2, a capping enzyme and conduit for viral transcripts exiting the core, are located at the icosahedral vertices of the reovirus particle and span both the inner core and the outer capsid Fig. 1 Reovirus disassembly intermediates. Surface-shaded representations of cryo-EM image reconstructions of reovirus are shown, as viewed along a twofold axis of symmetry. Density corresponding to s1 can be seen extending from turrets of l2 at the icosahedral axes of virions and ISVPs. Cores lack s1. Image adapted from Dryden et al. (1993) ( Bartlett et al. 1974; Cleveland et al. 1986; Dryden et al. 1993; Fausnaugh and Shatkin 1990; Furuichi et al. 1976; Gillies et al. 1971; Luongo et al. 1998 Luongo et al. , 2000 Mao and Joklik 1991; Reinisch et al. 2000) . Minor core components include m2 ($24 copies) and l3 (12 copies) (Coombs 1998; Dryden et al. 1998) . Each copy of viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase l3 is associated with three monomers of l1 and occupies a single icosahedral vertex in the inner core (Drayna and Fields 1982; Starnes and Joklik 1993; Tao et al. 2002; Zhang et al. 2003) . Surrounding the core is the outer capsid, which has quasi T \u00bc 13 (laevo) icosahedral symmetry (Metcalf 1982) and is composed of 200 heterohexamers of the membrane-penetration protein, m1, and its protective cap, s3 (m1 3 s3 3 ) (Dryden et al. 1993; Liemann et al. 2002; Metcalf 1982) . Extending from a l2 turret at each vertex of a reovirus particle is a trimer of s1, the viral attachment protein, which is released during entry (Chappell et al. 2002; Dryden et al. 1993; Fraser et al. 1990; Furlong et al. 1988; Strong et al. 1991) . The reovirus s1 protein mediates binding to cellular receptors (Barton et al. 2001b; Chappell et al. 2000) and influences target-cell selection in the infected host (Weiner et al. 1977 (Weiner et al. , 1980 . The 455 amino acids of strain T3D s1 fold into a trimer approximately 480 \u00c5 long and 90 \u00c5 wide at its broadest point, with a globular C-terminal head, a central body, and a slender N-terminal tail (Chappell et al. 2002; Fraser et al. 1990 ; Guglielmi et al. 2006) (Fig. 2) . Residues 310-455 comprise the head, which is constructed from two Greek-key motifs that assemble into an eightstranded b-barrel (Chappell et al. 2002; Schelling et al. 2007) . With the exception of the loop connecting b-strands D and E (D-E loop), which contains a 3 10 helix, loops connecting individual strands of the b-barrel are very short. N-terminal to the s1 head, residues 246-309 form repeating units of two antiparallel b-strands Fig. 2 Model of reovirus attachment to JAM-A on the cell surface. A ribbon-trace model of fulllength T3D s1, extending from a schematic virion, with the known structure of the C-terminus (Chappell et al. 2002) in tricolor and the prediction for the N-terminus in gray. The predicted SA-binding site (Chappell et al. 2000; Dermody et al. 1990 ) is marked with a hexagon. The extracellular domains D1 and D2 of JAM-A (Prota et al. 2003) and schematic representations of the transmembrane (TM) and intracellular domains are shown in green. Asterisks indicate regions of flexibility. For clarity, only two JAM-A monomers are shown bound to s1. Figure and legend modified from Kirchner et al. (2008) connected by short loops. Three such units assemble into a triple b-spiral, which is a motif observed to date only in viral fibers, including the adenovirus fiber (van Raaij et al. 1999) , bacteriophage PRD1 P5 (Merckel et al. 2005) , avian reovirus attachment protein sC (Guardado et al. 2005) , and mammalian reovirus T3D s1 (Chappell et al. 2002) . In addition to the three b-spiral repeats observed in the crystallized s1 fragment, sequence analysis suggests that the remainder of the T3D s1 body (residues 167-249) contains an additional five N-terminal b-spiral repeats (Chappell et al. 2002; Guglielmi et al. 2006) . Alternatively, these residues may form a combination of b-spiral repeats and a-helical coiled-coil, as suggested by sequence analysis (Chappell et al. 2002; Guglielmi et al. 2006; Nibert et al. 1990 ) and an observed narrowing in this region in a composite negative-stain electron micrograph (EM) (Fraser et al. 1990 ). The structure of the N-terminal tail, residues $1-160, of s1 is unknown. However, a repeating heptad sequence motif is predictive of an amphipathic a-helix, which likely assembles into an a-helical coiled-coil in the trimer (Chappell et al. 2002; Guglielmi et al. 2006; Nibert et al. 1990 ). The extreme N-terminus of s1 does not contain any obvious sequence motifs. It is hydrophobic and anchors the protein into the pentameric turret formed by l2 in the reovirus virion (Dryden et al. 1993; Furlong et al. 1988 ). This symmetry mismatch suggests an interaction of limited strength, which may aid in s1 release during viral disassembly .",

One site of substantial flexibility in T3D s1 is contributed by a four-residue insertion between the two most C-terminal b-spiral repeats (Cavalli et al. 2004; Chappell et al. 2002) . Sequence alignments suggest that s1 of reovirus prototype strains T1L and T2J each contain a six-residue insertion at the same position (Chappell et al. 2002) . This insertion appears to correspond to a region of flexibility observed just below the s1 head in EM images (Fraser et al. 1990) . A second region of flexibility observed at the midpoint of s1 may correspond to the transition between the predicted a-helical coiled-coil region of the tail and the b-spiral-containing body, and a final region of flexibility close to the N-terminus likely represents the virion insertion domain (Chappell et al. 2002; Fraser et al. 1990; Guglielmi et al. 2006; Nibert et al. 1990) .",

A cluster of six conserved aspartic acid residues on a rigid b-hairpin at the base of the s1 head, sandwiched between hydrophobic residues that block access to solvent, forms the main contact area between monomers in the trimer (Chappell et al. 2002; Schelling et al. 2007 ). Of the two aspartic acid residues contributed by each monomer, one (Asp346) is neutralized by a salt-bridge interaction with a nearby residue, while the other (Asp345) is not (Chappell et al. 2002; Schelling et al. 2007 ). The three Asp345 side chains closely appose each other at the center of the trimer in an otherwise hydrophobic environment. Since accumulation of negative charge in this region is predicted to destabilize the trimer (Cavalli et al. 2004) , and a D345N mutation results in s1 trimers with a structure indistinguishable from wild-type (Schelling et al. 2007) , it is likely that Asp345 is protonated in the s1 crystal structure (Chappell et al. 2002) , representing the \"closed\" conformation of s1. This conformation might form during crystallization at near-neutral pH and physiologically in conditions of low pH, similar to those encountered in the endocytic compartment during reovirus entry (Schelling et al. 2007 ). Thus, the aspartic acid sandwich motif may contribute to s1 conformational rearrangements by acting as a molecular switch that mediates the oligomeric state of the s1 head, depending on environmental pH (Schelling et al. 2007 ).",

T3D exhibits a reduced capacity to agglutinate erythrocytes following treatment with neuraminidase, which removes terminal SA moieties (Gentsch and Pacitti 1987) . Preincubation of either L cells with neuraminidase or virus with sialosides also significantly diminishes T3D binding (Gentsch and Pacitti 1985; Paul et al. 1989 ). SA residues linked in either a2,3 or a2,6 configurations effectively block serotype 3 reovirus binding to L cells (Paul et al. 1989) . Reovirus T3D binds to sialoglycophorin, but not to asialoglycophorin, with an avidity of $5 \u00c2 10 \u00c09 M ( Barton et al. 2001a) , which is a property mediated by the s1 protein (Chappell et al. 2000) . Thus, SA functions as a serotype 3 reovirus receptor in cultured cells. In addition, SA binding also serves an important role in reovirus tropism and pathogenesis in vivo (Barton et al. 2003 ). An SA-binding strain of reovirus, but not a non-SA-binding strain, causes bile duct injury in newborn mice and exhibits 1,000-fold greater binding capacity for human cholangiocarcinoma cells, which are derived from bile duct epithelium.",

For both T1L and T3D, interactions with carbohydrate are mediated by a region of predicted b-spiral (Chappell et al. 2002) . The capacity to bind SA is essential for reovirus infection of murine erythroleukemia (MEL) cells (Chappell et al. 1997; Rubin et al. 1992 ). Adaptation of non-SA-binding reoviruses to growth in MEL cells results in amino acid substitutions at residues 198, 202, and 204 of s1 that confer SA-binding capacity on the resultant viruses (Chappell et al. 1997) . Molecular modeling of the s1 body, based on available structure and sequence data, suggests that these residues are surface-exposed and proximal to one another in the predicted b-spiral region (Chappell et al. 2002) . Thus, residues 198, 202, and 204 are likely to contribute to an SA-binding site in T3D s1.",

JAM-A was identified as a reovirus receptor using a genetic screen and subsequently shown to bind directly to the s1 head domain with nanomolar affinity (Barton et al. 2001b; Schelling et al. 2007 ). Human and murine homologs of JAM-A, but not JAM family members JAM-B or JAM-C, serve as receptors for all reovirus serotypes and strains tested to date (Barton et al. 2001b; Campbell et al. 2005; Prota et al. 2003) . The role of JAM-A as a reovirus receptor in vivo has been examined using JAM-A-null mice (Antar et al. 2009 ). Following peroral inoculation, JAM-A is dispensable for reovirus growth in the intestine. However, it is required for infection of vascular endothelial cells and promotes efficient hematogenous dissemination of reovirus to sites of secondary infection. Thus, JAM-A serves as a high-affinity reovirus receptor in cultured cells and in vivo.",

Mutation of individual JAM-A D1 domain residues Arg59, Glu61, Lys63, Leu72, Tyr75, and Asn76, which lie in or adjacent to the dimer interface, diminishes or abolishes s1 binding and reovirus infectivity ). Concordantly, the structure of the s1-JAM-A complex shows that each s1 trimer binds three independent JAM-A monomers (Kirchner et al. 2008) . Contacts primarily involve the JAM-A dimer interface and a conserved region at the base of the s1 head (Chappell et al. 2002; Kirchner et al. 2008) (Fig. 3 ). In addition, the structure of the s1-JAM-A complex also identifies residues bound by s1 that are found just outside the dimer interface of JAM-A (Kirchner et al. 2008) . These residues may serve as initial contact points for s1 and facilitate disruption of the JAM-A homodimer to allow interaction of s1 with the JAM-A dimer interface. It is also possible that a cavity in the JAM-A dimer interface renders the homodimer intrinsically unstable, thereby promoting its disruption by s1. Regardless of the mechanism, the s1-JAM-A interaction is thermodynamically favored, as the K D is approximately 1,000-fold lower than the K D of the JAM-A homodimer interaction Kirchner et al. 2008) .",

Expression of a JAM-A truncation mutant lacking a cytoplasmic tail allows reovirus to infect nonpermissive cells (Maginnis et al. 2006) , suggesting that molecules other than JAM-A mobilize the internalization apparatus that promotes reovirus cell entry. Based on similarities in the structures of the reovirus and adenovirus attachment proteins and receptors , it was hypothesized that reovirus and adenovirus employ similar integrin-dependent internalization mechanisms to enter cells. In keeping with this hypothesis, reovirus l2 protein contains conserved integrin-binding motifs, RGD and KGE (Breun et al. 2001; Seliger et al. 1987) . These sequences are displayed on surface-exposed loops of l2 , where they could interact with integrins. Interestingly, the l2-encoding L2 gene segment is genetically linked to viral shedding in infected mice and spread to littermates (Keroack and Fields 1986) , suggesting a role for l2 in reovirusinduced disease. Treatment of cells with antibodies specific for b1 integrin reduces reovirus infection, while antibodies specific for the other integrin subunits expressed on permissive cells, including those specific for a integrin subunits, have no effect (Maginnis et al. 2006 ). However, antibodies specific for b1 integrin do not alter infection by in-vitro generated infectious subvirion particles (ISVPs) (Maginnis et al. 2006) , which directly penetrate the plasma membrane and do not require endocytosis (Hooper and Fields 1996; Lucia-Jandris et al. 1993 ). These findings suggest that b1 integrin blockade inhibits endocytic uptake of virions. In comparison to b1 integrin-expressing cells, b1-null cells are substantially less susceptible to infection by reovirus virions, while infection by ISVPs is equivalent in both cell types (Maginnis et al. 2006) .

ISVPs are characterized by the loss of s3, a conformational change in s1, and cleavage of m1 to form d and f. The rate-limiting step in reovirus disassembly is the proteolytic removal of s3 Sturzenbecker et al. 1987) . Proteolysis of s3 is dependent on acidic pH in some cell types (Dermody et al. 1993; Sturzenbecker et al. 1987 ) and endocytic cysteine proteases . Cathepsins B and L catalyze reovirus disassembly in fibroblasts . Both enzymes are optimally active at acidic pH and serve functions in extracellular matrix formation, antigen presentation, and apoptosis (Chapman et al. 1997 ). These enzymes also mediate cell entry of several other viruses, including Ebola virus (Chandran et al. 2005) , Hendra virus (Pager and Dutch 2005) , and SARS coronavirus (Huang et al. 2006) . Cathepsin S, a neutral pH cysteine protease required for processing internalized antigens (Riese et al. 1996) , mediates uncoating of some reovirus strains in a macrophage cell line (Golden et al. 2004) . It is possible that the broad tissue tropism displayed by reovirus is determined in part by the multiple host proteases capable of mediating its disassembly, analogous to highly pathogenic influenza viruses that disseminate systemically by utilization of alternative proteases for hemagglutinin processing (Goto and Kawaoka 1998; Stieneke-Grober et al. 1992) . Proteolytic enzymes also are required for reovirus infection following peroral inoculation of mice (Bass et al. 1990; Bodkin et al. 1989) . Reovirus virions are converted to ISVPs in the intestinal lumen by the resident serine proteases chymotrypsin and trypsin. ISVPs produced in this fashion infect intestinal M cells to allow systemic dissemination of reovirus in the host (Amerongen et al. 1994) . ISVPs generated by chymotrypsin or trypsin in vitro or in the gut lumen (Bass et al. 1990; Bodkin et al. 1989 ) are indistinguishable from ISVPs generated by cathepsin B or cathepsin L in vitro or in the endocytic compartment of cells (Baer et al. 1999; Ebert et al. 2002) .",

Since sequence polymorphisms in the s3 C-terminus determine susceptibility to proteolysis, the initial cleavage of s3 probably occurs in this region. During proteolysis by cathepsin L, subsequent cleavages occur between residues 243-244 and 250-251 (Ebert et al. Ebert et al. (2002) 2002) (Fig. 6a) . These cleavage sites are physically located near the C-terminus in the s3 crystal structure (Olland et al. 2001) (Fig. 6b, c) . Because of this proximity, the small end fragment released following initial cathepsin L cleavage likely exposes the cleavage sites between residues 243-244 and 250-251, rendering them sensitive to proteolysis. The C-terminus therefore appears to control access to internal, proteolytically sensitive sites in s3. Because reovirus disassembly in some cell types is acid-dependent (Dermody et al. 1993; Sturzenbecker et al. 1987 ), the C-terminus might be primed for movement at acidic pH. Mutations near the C-terminus, like Y354H, may alter the conformation of the protein to allow improved access to these cleavage sites and thus accelerate outer capsid disassembly (Wilson et al. 2002) . High-resolution structural analysis of Y354H-s3, which is currently ongoing, will enhance an understanding of s3 proteolysis.",

            "text": "Studies to assess the capacity of reovirus entry intermediates to penetrate artificial lipid bilayers, model membranes of erythrocytes, or membranes of cells that support reovirus infection indicate that ISVPs but not virions or cores mediate membrane penetration (Borsa et al. 1979; Chandran and Nibert 1998; Chandran et al. 1999 Chandran et al. , 2001 Hooper and Fields 1996; Lucia-Jandris et al. 1993; Tosteson et al. 1993) . Such studies led to the idea that ISVPs or a related subviral particle is the membrane-active intermediate in the reovirus entry pathway. Since ISVPs differ from cores by the presence of outer-capsid proteins s1 and m1 (Coombs 1998; Dryden et al. 1993) , and because cores recoated in vitro with m1 alone are capable of membrane penetration (Chandran et al. 1999) , these findings point to a role for the m1 protein in membrane penetration. This biochemical evidence is also supported by several genetic studies. Differences in membrane-penetration efficiency displayed by reovirus strains T1L and T3D segregate with the m1-encoding M2 gene segment Lucia-Jandris et al. 1993 ). Additionally, viruses selected for resistance to denaturants such as ethanol contain mutations within the M2 gene segment and display alterations in membrane penetration capacity Danthi et al. 2008b; Hooper and Fields 1996; Wessner and Fields 1993) . Together, these data demonstrate a function for the m1 protein in membrane penetration. The m1 protein folds into four distinct domains (Fig. 7a) . Domains I, II, and III are primarily a-helical and show no homology with other proteins. Domain IV forms a jelly-roll b-barrel commonly found in the capsid proteins of many nonenveloped viruses (Harrison 2001) . This domain interacts extensively with similar domains of the neighboring m1 molecules and with s3. The m1 protein also contains three proteolytic cleavage sites (Fig. 7b) . These include an autocatalytic cleavage site at amino acid 42, which separates m1N and m1C, a cleavage site at approximately amino acid 580, which releases the d and f fragments, and a cleavage site at the C-terminus that releases an $10 amino acid peptide Mendez et al. 2003; Nibert and Fields 1992; Odegard et al. 2004 ). While the physiologic roles of both the d-f and the C-terminal cleavages are unclear, studies using reovirus cores recoated with a m1N-m1C cleavage-resistant m1 mutant indicate that cleavage of m1 to generate m1N and m1C is required for membrane penetration and virion infectivity (Odegard et al. 2004 ). Since m1N is released from Liemann et al. (2002) . (c and d) A 3% v/v solution of bovine erythrocytes was incubated with 5.4 \u00c2 10 10 ISVPs of wild-type rsT3D or the indicated m1 d (c) or m1 f (d) mutant at 37 C for 1 h. Hemolysis was quantified by determining absorbance of the supernatant at 415 nm. Hemolysis following treatment of an equal number of cells with virion-storage buffer or virion-storage buffer containing 1% TX-100 was considered to be 0 or 100%, respectively. Results are expressed as mean percent hemolysis for triplicate samples. Error bars indicate SD. *, P < 0.05 as determined by Student's t-test in comparison to rsT3D. Figure modified from Danthi et al. (2008a, b) viral particles, it is postulated that cleavage of m1 is required for release of m1N, which then interacts with membranes as a function of its myristate moiety to effect membrane penetration . The requirement for the release of a small hydrophobic peptide for membrane penetration is strikingly similar to the entry mechanisms employed by other nonenveloped viruses such as adenoviruses (Wiethoff et al. 2005) , nodaviruses (Schneemann et al. 1992; Walukiewicz et al. 2008) , and picornaviruses (Danthi et al. 2003) .",

Based on these studies, massive conformational rearrangements resulting in unwinding of the m1 trimer must be required to release m1N during cell entry (Liemann et al. 2002; Zhang et al. 2006) . Evidence for conformational changes in particle-associated m1 following interaction of ISVPs with membranes or when exposed to high salt concentrations has led to the identification of an ISVP-like entry intermediate in the reovirus cell entry pathway . This intermediate, referred to as ISVP*, is characterized by changes in the conformation of the m1 d fragment, loss of the s1 protein, and an increase in the overall hydrophobicity of the particle . Thus, the m1 protein associated with ISVPs is in a metastable state primed to undergo conformational changes to assume a more hydrophobic structure capable of interaction with membranes. While it is not understood how these conformational changes in m1 are triggered, it is thought that interaction of an anion-binding site in domain IV with phospholipid head groups in endosomal membranes might trigger the requisite rearrangements in m1 that reveal the myristoylated m1N and the internal hydrophobic residues (Liemann et al. 2002) . At high particle concentrations, ISVP* conversion is regulated by a positive feedback mechanism in which m1N, which is released during ISVP* formation, promotes ISVP-to-ISVP* conversion of the remaining particles . Acceleration of ISVP* formation by m1N is dependent on temperature and target flexibility, suggesting that particle dynamics are required to expose a m1N interaction domain ). Since such particle concentrations are unlikely to be achieved following a low multiplicity viral infection, it remains unclear how these findings translate to ISVP* formation in cellular endosomes during viral entry.",

These and other stability-altering residues identified in thermostable reovirus mutants (Middleton et al. 2007 ) are located between residues 383 and 612 of m1 and map to either domain IV that forms the jelly-roll b-barrel or the a-helical portions of domain III that lie just below the b-barrel structure. Since these m1 domains participate in interactions between neighboring m1 monomers, these residues are thought to modulate viral stability by preventing unwinding of the m1 trimer (Liemann et al. 2002) . Consistent with an increase in m1 protein rigidity in ethanol-resistant and thermostable mutants, viral cores recoated with mutant m1 proteins, or recombinant reoviruses containing single amino acid substitutions in m1 in an otherwise wild-type background, display diminished ISVPto-ISVP* conversion and have defects in membrane penetration (Wessner and Fields 1993; Hooper and Fields 1996; Chandran et al. 2002; Middleton et al. 2007; Danthi et al. 2008a, b) (Fig. 7c, d) . These studies suggest that a central region of m1 involved in intermolecular interactions is an important regulator of the ISVP-to-ISVP* transition. In addition to these residues, changes in the C-terminal f fragment also control viral stability (Middleton et al. 2007 ) and affect membrane penetration by reducing the efficiency of ISVP-to-ISVP* conversion (Danthi et al. 2008a ). While it is not clear how f residues modulate these properties, since both m1N and f are released from the virus particle during ISVP* formation , it is likely that conformational rearrangements in m1 during ISVP* formation are not restricted to the d domain but also involve the m1N and f domains. Therefore, amino acid substitutions within f that negatively affect its conformational flexibility would likely prevent the m1 reorganization required for ISVP* formation. Biochemical and structural characterization of additional mutant viruses that may be affected to varying degrees in the capacity to undergo m1 conformational changes may identify as yet unknown intermediates during ISVPto-ISVP* conversion and offer insights into mechanisms that promote the elaborate remodeling of m1 required for membrane penetration.",

Both m1N and ISVP*s associate with erythrocyte membranes (Agosto et al. 2006; Ivanovic et al. 2008 ), but m1N is capable of pore formation in the absence of other viral components ). While f also associates with membranes ), its recruitment does not result in membrane penetration. These findings are consistent with the observation that viruses incapable of d-f cleavage can penetrate membranes and are fully infectious (Chandran and Nibert 1998; Chandran et al. 1999 ). Since pore formation by m1N is enhanced by the presence of f, it is possible that f functions as a m1N chaperone and facilitates membrane penetration by reovirus . Pores formed by released m1N fragments are considerably smaller than those required to allow the viral intermediate to traverse the membrane (Agosto et al. 2006) . Therefore, it is not clear how pore formation in model membranes relates to membrane penetration during cell entry. Analogous to erythrocyte membrane rupture, pore formation may result in osmotic lysis of endosomes in which viral particles are present. Alternatively, the initial small pore formed by the virus might recruit cellular factors that produce larger pores or channels through which the viral intermediate can translocate.",

While d is found distributed diffusely throughout the cytosol, viral cores display a more punctuate cytoplasmic localization . These observations suggest that the d fragment disassociates from the ISVP* either during or immediately after membrane penetration. This idea is supported by the evidence that reovirus cores are transcriptionally active in the cytoplasm and that activation of transcription requires complete removal of the m1 fragments. Removal of d from cores is thought to be accomplished by direct interaction of d with the host chaperone Hsc70 via an ATPdependent process (Ivanovic et al. 2007 ). Based on the finding that chaperones can translocate proteins across membranes (Young et al. 2004) , it is possible that concomitant with removal of particle-associated d, Hsc70 also aids in transport of the viral core across membranes (Ivanovic et al. 2007) . Additional experiments are required to reveal the precise mechanism by which host membranes are breached by reovirus.",

            "text": "Reovirus infection elicits apoptosis of cultured cells and in vivo. Apoptosis induction by reovirus requires activation of innate immune transcription factors NF-kB and IRF-3 (Connolly et al. 2000; Hansberger et al. 2007; Holm et al. 2007 ) (Fig. 8) . In cultured cells, reovirus-induced apoptosis does not require de novo synthesis of viral RNA and protein (Connolly and Dermody 2002; Danthi et al. 2006) , indicating that the proapoptotic stimulus is contained within infecting viral capsids. Consistent with these findings, strain-specific differences in the capacity of reovirus to induce apoptosis segregate genetically with the viral S1 and M2 gene segments (Connolly et al. 2001; Tyler et al. 1995 Tyler et al. , 1996 , which encode s1 and m1, respectively (McCrae and Joklik 1978; Mustoe et al. 1978) . Antibody-dependent uptake of reovirus virions in an entry process that does not require JAM-A and SA leads to apoptotic cell death, indicating that signaling pathways triggered by s1-receptor interactions are dispensable for reovirus-induced apoptosis (Danthi et al. 2006) . Regardless of the receptors used to mediate attachment, initiation of prodeath signaling following reovirus infection requires viral disassembly in cellular endosomes (Danthi et al. 2006) , suggesting an essential function for the m1 protein in apoptosis induction. Introduction of single amino acid substitutions into the d region of m1 decreases the capacity of the resultant mutant viruses to effect membrane penetration, mobilize NF-kB, and evoke apoptosis (Danthi et al. 2008b) (Fig. 8c) . These findings suggest that the membrane-penetration and apoptosis induction-functions of m1 are linked and that the d region of m1 is an essential modulator of both processes (Danthi et al. 2008b) . It is possible that membrane penetration directly initiates proapoptotic signals. Alternatively, membrane penetration might allow delivery of the m1 cleavage fragments into the cytoplasm where prodeath signaling is elicited. Two lines of evidence support the latter possibility. First, plasmid-driven expression of the m1 f domain in the cytoplasm is sufficient to induce apoptosis (Coffey et al. 2006) . Second, recombinant viruses with engineered substitutions within f are diminished in NF-kB activation and apoptosis (Danthi et al. 2008a) (Fig. 8d) . Importantly, a membrane-penetration-proficient f mutant is impaired in the capacity to activate prodeath signaling, indicating that f modulates apoptosis independent of an effect on membrane penetration (Danthi et al. 2008a ). Based on these findings, it appears likely that cytoplasmic delivery of f subsequent to membrane penetration initiates prodeath signaling following reovirus infection (Danthi et al. 2008a ).",

Empty reovirus particles devoid of genome can stimulate NF-kB but not IRF-3, providing additional support for the idea that NF-kB and IRF-3 are activated following reovirus infection via distinct mechanisms (Connolly et al. 2000; Holm et al. 2007 ). Since reovirus empty particles are capable of eliciting apoptosis (Connolly and Dermody 2002) but do not lead to IRF-3 activation Danthi et al.

            "text": "The process of cell entry is poorly understood for many pathogenic viruses. This gap in knowledge has been a significant impediment to the rational design of antiviral agents and vaccines that target distinct steps in the entry process. Studies of mammalian reovirus have uncovered discrete attachment and internalization receptors, a function for cathepsin proteases in disassembly, an intricate mechanism for protein-membrane interactions, and a framework for activation of innate immune response signaling. Many of these functions are shared by other viral pathogens, suggesting conserved mechanisms of cell entry that should be amenable to common therapeutic approaches. However, there is much more to learn. The current model of s1-JAM-A interactions at the cell surface suggests that structural characteristics of s1 may facilitate concurrent engagement of JAM-A and carbohydrates by appropriately positioning the receptor-binding domains. Indeed, studies of adenovirus fiber, which is structurally homologous to s1 , have highlighted the importance of length and flexibility in viral tropism (Wu et al. 2003) . However, the contributions of s1 length and flexibility to reovirus receptor engagement have not been explored. In the structure of a s1-JAM-A complex, the s1 head forms a trimer. Yet, there is evidence to suggest that s1 may at times exist in a partially detrimerized conformation (Fraser et al. 1990; Schelling et al. 2007 ). An improved understanding of the role of the unusual aspartic acid sandwich trimerization motif may lend insight into the contributions of trimer instability to reovirus attachment and entry.",

            "text": "Reovirus serotypes display striking differences in pathogenesis that are directly linked to s1 (Tyler et al. 1986; Weiner et al. 1977 Weiner et al. , 1980 . However, each of the reovirus serotypes uses JAM-A as a receptor (Campbell et al. 2005) . Considering previous studies of reovirus interactions with JAM-A and carbohydrates, we think there are three possible explanations of s1-mediated serotypespecific differences in reovirus tropism and disease. First, the carbohydrate specificity of a particular strain of reovirus might direct infection to specific cells or tissues. In support of this idea, serotype 3 reovirus strains that vary in SA utilization also vary in disease pathogenesis in the hepatobiliary system (Barton et al. 2003) . While there is some evidence that T1L binds SA in intestinal loops (Helander et al. 2003) , the exact nature of the carbohydrate coreceptors used by reovirus serotypes 1 and 2 remains undefined. Second, variations in the interaction kinetics or affinity of a particular s1 serotype for JAM-A might contribute to differences in tropism. While there is overlap among JAM-A residues required for reovirus T1L, T2J, and T3D binding, there is evidence that the binding sites in JAM-A for these viruses differ ). Furthermore, sequence alignments reveal that the residues in T3D s1 that contact JAM-A in the complex (Kirchner et al. 2008) are not entirely conserved among reoviruses of all serotype (Campbell et al. 2005; Chappell et al. 2002) . On a cell that expresses only low levels of JAM-A, differences in receptor interaction kinetics or affinity might determine whether or not reovirus can initiate infection. Third, JAM-A might serve as a serotype-independent reovirus receptor at some sites within the host, and other, as yet unidentified, receptors confer serotype-dependent tropism in the central nervous system. Indeed, studies using non-SA-binding reovirus to infect JAM-A-null mice provide support for this hypothesis and point specifically to the existence of unidentified receptors in both the intestine and the central nervous system (Antar et al. 2009 ). Future exploration of each of these possibilities will help clarify the role of s1 in reovirus pathogenesis.",

Furthermore, it is unclear whether activation of signaling pathways is required to trigger reovirus internalization by b1 integrin. Studies using mutant b1 integrin constructs suggest that NPXY motifs within b1 integrin direct transport of reovirus to the subcellular compartment for disassembly and membrane penetration (Maginnis et al. 2008 ). However, the composition of the endocytic machinery recruited by the NPXY motifs that directs reovirus to the appropriate endocytic organelle for disassembly is yet to be identified. Since early steps in reovirus replication influence several stages of reovirus-host interactions (Virgin et al. 1997) , it is possible that engagement of b1 integrin influences reovirus pathogenesis.

            "text": "In addition to enhancing an understanding of fundamental aspects of entry mechanisms employed by nonenveloped viruses, studies of reovirus cell entry are also pertinent to the development of optimal reovirus-based oncolytic and vaccine vectors. Reovirus infects transformed cells much more efficiently than it does nontransformed cells (Duncan et al. 1978 ). Based on initial success in using reovirus for tumor killing in animal models (Coffey et al. 1998; Hirasawa et al. 2002) , reovirus is currently undergoing clinical trials as a virotherapeutic for aggressive and refractory human tumors (Stoeckel and Hay 2006) . Since reovirus undergoes primary replication in intestinal tissue with few or no symptoms in humans (Tai et al. 2005) and is now amenable to genetic modification (Kobayashi et al. 2007) , it also is an excellent candidate for development of a multifunctional vaccine modality to elicit mucosal immunity. Therefore, understanding the precise mechanisms by which reovirus attaches to host cells and initiates an infectious cycle will allow reovirus to be strategically engineered to facilitate retargeting to distinct host cells or enhance the efficiency of cell entry for a variety of therapeutic applications.",
