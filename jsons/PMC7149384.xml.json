Different strains of inbred mice may vary many thousandfold in their susceptibility or resistance to a given virus. The severity of an infection depends on the interplay between the virulence of the virus and the resistance of the host. One can regard an acute infection as a race between the ability of the virus to replicate, spread in the body, and cause disease, and the ability of the host to restrict and control these events. A highly virulent strain of virus is less lethal for a highly resistant animal than for a susceptible animal; conversely, a relatively avirulent strain of virus may be lethal for an unusually susceptible animal.",

There are many of these genes, most of them situated in the region known as the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) (see Chapter 9). Most other genetic determinants of virus susceptibility are not directly related to the immune response and map outside the MHC locus. Individuals with a genetically determined poor immune response to neutralizing epitopes on the surface proteins of a given virus would presumably have difficulty in controlling infection with that particular virus. In the mouse at least, absence of a specific response is generally recessive. Susceptibility of mice to infection with cytomegaloviruses, retroviruses, and lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus has been shown to be linked to particular MHC genotypes. Some breeds of domestic animals (e.g., sheep) are so inbred that particular viral susceptibility and resistance patterns have been found to be associated with specific immune responsiveness patterns.",

It has been repeatedly demonstrated that severe nutritional deficiencies will interfere with the generation of antibody and cell-mediated immune responses, with the activity of phagocytes, and with the integrity of skin and mucous membranes. However, often it is impossible to disentangle adverse nutritional effects from other factors such as poor husbandry. Moreover, just as malnutrition can exacerbate viral infections, so viral infections can exacerbate malnutrition, thus creating a vicious cycle.",

For example, during this time mice pass from a stage of immunological nonreactivity (to many antigens) to immunological maturity. This change profoundly affects their reaction to viruses like lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus, which induces a persistent tolerated infection when inoculated into newborn mice, but an immune response in mice infected when over a week old. Most domestic animals are reasonably mature immunologically at the time of birth, but still very susceptible to infection with those viruses against which their dam has no antibody. If the umbrella of maternal antibody usually provided in mammals through colostrum or transplacental transfer is missing, the newborn animal is particularly vulnerable to infections with viruses such as canine distemper virus, canine parvovirus, hog cholera virus, bovine virus diarrhea virus, enteropathogenic coronaviruses, rotaviruses, and various herpesviruses during the first few weeks of life.",

Interleukin-1 is induced by immunological mechanisms, e.g., generalized antigen\u2013antibody and cell-mediated immune reactions. It is found in inflammatory exudates and acts on the temperature-regulating center in the anterior hypothalamus. Interferons are also pyrogenic when present in sufficiently high concentration; their antiviral and immunomodulatory functions are discussed below.",

It was subsequently suggested that temperature-sensitive (ts) viral mutants might therefore be expected to be less virulent, and this correlation has now been observed with ts mutants of many viruses, some of which are being used as vaccines (see Chapter 14).",

Certainly, interferons can be found in the mucus bathing epithelial surfaces such as the respiratory tract, and interferon is produced by most or all cells of mesenchymal origin. Lymphocytes, especially T cells, NK cells, and K cells, as well as macrophages, produce large amounts of interferons \u03b1 and \u03b3, and probably comprise the principal source of circulating interferon in viral infections characterized by a viremic stage.",

            "text": "There are data supporting a central role for interferons in the recovery of animals and humans following at least some viral infections. The most telling evidence that interferon can indeed be instrumental in deciding the outcome of a natural viral infection is that mice infected with any of several nonlethal viruses, or with sublethal doses of more virulent viruses, die if antiinterferon serum is administered. In general, however, we know very little about the relative importance of the various interferons. While it is widely postulated that interferons constitute the first line of defense in the process of recovery from viral infections, it would be naive to believe that they are the only, or even the most important factor. If this were so, one might expect that a systemic infection with any virus, or indeed, immunization with a live vaccine, might protect an animal, for a period at least, against challenge with an unrelated virus. While some experimental data suggest that this may occur, the phenomenon cannot be generally demonstrated. Evidence is somewhat stronger that infection of the upper respiratory tract with one virus will provide temporary local protection against others. Perhaps this distinction provides the clue; the direct antiviral effect of interferons is limited in both time and space. Their main antiviral role may be to protect cells in the immediate vicinity of the initial focus of infection.",
