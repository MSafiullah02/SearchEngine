            "text": "levels of 3.02 \u00b5g/mL and a paO2 of 83 mmHg. A chest X-ray showed no abnormality. In light of this presentation, a nasopharyngeal swab was collected on 23 March 2020 and tested positive for COVID-19. The patient's clinical condition deteriorated with a fever of 38.4\u00b0C, requiring the administration of oxygen at 3 L/min. Given the discrepancy between his hypoxemia and the chest X-ray, a chest CT scan with contrast injection was performed on 24 March 2020 (7 days after the onset of symptoms). The chest CT scan showed parenchymal damage indicative of COVID-19 pneumonia of moderate severity with lobar and segmental pulmonary embolism involving the middle lobe with a CO-RADS score of 5 (Figure 1-B and C). The patient was treated with effective anticoagulation (enoxaparin 8000 IU/12h). The global spread of the COVID-19 epidemic has been shown to occur through travel. 2 Long-haul flight travel is a known risk factor of pulmonary embolism. 3 Only one case of pulmonary embolism was reported during the MERS and SARS coronavirus epidemics. 4 A retrospective series suggests that patients with COVID-19 pneumonia may be at risk of developing pulmonary embolism. 5 The case described here reinforces this hypothesis. Moreover, patients with COVID-19 infections exhibit state of hyperinflammation and coagulopathy, frequently hypoxemia leading to inactivity and prolonged bed rest. Accordingly, clinicians should consider looking for this complication in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia who have travelled on long-haul flights.
