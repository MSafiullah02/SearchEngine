With the cooperation of the whole hospital and radiology department, a number of effective evaluation methods have been carried out to ensure the optimization of clinical protection. These practical methods provide a basis for the further promotion of management strategies and reduction of nosocomial infection. To our knowledge, the establishment of standardized protection and clear process has opened up a new idea of epidemic prevention management, which can effectively provide timely, efficient, and accurate support for clinical research, and promote the transformation from clinical research type to scientific research management type.",

The equipment is only used for examination of patients with fever to minimize cross-infection. At the same time, to control the movement of sources of infection in the hospital, we selected and cooperated with the fever clinic to arrange an examination green path to the nearest equipment to ensure the smooth CT examination of patients and reduce the waiting time in the examination and the time to find the examination equipment. Second, CT equipment should support the automatic upload function of examination images. After a patient examination, all the examination information is automatically subjected to thinslice reconstruction and uploaded to the Picture Archiving and Communication System for radiologists to read the film in time (Fig. 1) . Before CT examination, the diagnosing physician should make electronic labels, set up a reminder pop-up, and save alternate contact information in HIS for confirmed and suspected COVID-19 cases. When the radiology department receives the HRCT examination information from the patients, designated personnel send an individualized reminder according to the patient's condition, examination requirements, and nosocomial infection status and call the patients to inform them of the matters needing attention. When there are too many patients, diagnosis videos will be played on a loop. Patients should wear masks and disinfect their hands quickly before HRCT examination. We do not recommend queuing and set up waiting areas. The patient should understand the CT examination procedure to the greatest extent they can. Therefore, a noticeable prompt or voice prompt should be set in the fever clinic and next to the CT examination room. Metal accessories worn by the patients should be removed in advance, and the patients should hold their breath during the examination to ensure the success of the examination.",

So far, our hospital has received 176 pregnant women and 21 children, all of whom underwent CT examination and nucleic acid amplification test by reverse transcriptionpolymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) to detect SARS-CoV-2 in the hospital. These special patients, in addition to needing our attention for infection prevention and examination bed disinfection, need careful attention to protect them from radiation. For the children who do not cooperate with the examination, family members are required to be present at the examination. These family members also need to receive infection protection and radiation protection. The emergency response budget should also provide for patients with no ability to pay or patients seeking medical treatment from other places. We also provide a pathway to pay fee conveniently as well as free examination services.",
