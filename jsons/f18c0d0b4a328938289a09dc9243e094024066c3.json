            "text": "Main ARDS finding is the increased permeability of lung capillaries due to both alveolar epithelium and end vascular endothelium injuries. As consequence a protein-rich fluid accumulates into alveoli, cytokines are released, and a diffuse alveolar injury develops [7] . Alveolar epithelium is composed of type I and II pneumocytes. Injury of type I cells leads to liquid accumulation into alveoli and to a reduction in clearance ability, while injury of type II cells leads to surfactant reduction, alveolar collapse, and lung compliance decrease [5] . ARDS pathological pathway is described as a three-phase process: inflammatory, proliferative, and fibrotic phase with each one that could be stopped or complicated by worsening of patient's symptoms or other complications. Common ARDS risk factors are pneumonia, sepsis, inhalation/aspiration injury, trauma, pancreatitis, burns, non-cardiogenic shock, drowning, and transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI) [8] . However, pneumonia is the leading cause of ARDS, so microbiological investigations aiming to pathogen's identification are milestones in the diagnostic process. Communityacquired pneumonia is still the leading cause of ARDS in case of pneumonia etiology [9], while a recent study found that viral pneumonia is becoming more frequent going from 5% to 10% [10-12] to 36%. Among viral pneumonia, respiratory virus is predominant [13] ; in this case, the first-line diagnostic test is polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test on bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) [14] . Less frequent ARDS causes are represented by CMV and HSV infections [12, 15] and by parasites (such as Toxoplasma gondii, Aspergillus fumigatus, Pneumocystis jirovecii) mainly present in immunocompromised patients.",

Since lungs are characterized by diffuse edema, with the superimposed pressure causing atelectasis and collapse of dependent lung zones, consolidated areas are typically located in dependent lung regions [18] . Lung CT scan is also helpful in lung potential of recruitment evaluation, i.e., the proportion of consolidated lung that regain aeration after an increase in alveolar pressures. In ARDS patients, potential of recruitment could range between 0% and 70%. Moreover, lung CT scan could help clinician in identifying ARDS etiology; in fact, in pulmonary ARDS consolidated and ground glass areas are similar, while in extrapulmonary ARDS ground glass areas are predominant [19] . Next to CT scan, ultrasound of lung parenchyma, pleura, and air may be helpful in diagnostic evaluation, clinical management, and monitoring of ARDS patients [20] [21] [22] [23] . In respiratory failure patients, lung ultrasound is characterized mainly by B-line (hyperechogenic vertical artifact line that starts from pleura) [21] , while the B-pattern composed of three or more B-lines appears to be correlated with an interstitial pathological process [24] . A bilateral homogeneous B-pattern is not decisive between ARDS and cardiogenic edema and deserves further analysis [25] , while bilateral, nothomogeneous B-pattern plus C-pattern composed of consolidated areas and pleura abnormalities are suggestive of ARDS etiology [26] .

            "text": "Invasive mechanical ventilation is a supportive therapy able to guarantee adequate gas exchange (increase PaO 2 and clear CO 2 adequately) and reduce the respiratory muscle activity [30] . Mechanical ventilation presents a double effect on patient oxygenation: it allows a continuous and precise FiO 2 titration and during the inspiratory phase applies a positive airway pressure that reopens collapsed alveolar units. This second effect is likely to be limited in time, unless an adequate positive endexpiratory pressure is applied during the expiratory phase to avoid the alveolar recollapse [31] . The ventilatory setting in ARDS patient remains a daily challenge, and the choice should be adapted to each patient considering his/her hemodynamic parameters, respiratory mechanics, and gas exchange. During the last 30 years, literature has already widely demonstrated that high-volume/high-frequency ventilation can damage the lungs [32] mainly through the cycling collapse-reopening and alveolar overdistention phenomena that contribute to the so-called atelect-trauma [33] . The application of high PEEP allows collapsed alveoli reopening and intrapulmonary shunt reduction, moreover it reduces the repetitive alveolar opening and closing which occurs during the respiratory cycle [34] . However, it's not always useful to set high PEEP levels, as it could appear at first; indeed, two randomized and controlled trials comparing ARDS patients treated with low vs. high PEEP [35, 36] have not shown any benefit from the use of the high PEEP strategy. These contradictory results can be explained by the pulmonary recruitment concept, i.e., the volume of collapsed pulmonary parenchyma in which is possible to re-establish a normal aeration by an increase in the airway pressure [37] . To recruit collapsed lung regions and keep them open, it is necessary to apply an airway pressure higher enough to counterbalance the superimposed pressure, i.e., the pressure generated by the weight of the lung and the rib cage that acts on the lung below [38] . Several maneuvers can be used to recruit the lung: the sigh (i.e., one high-volume breath intermittently provided by the ventilator), the extended sigh (i.e., a progressive increase in PEEP or a progressive increase in both PEEP and plateau pressure), and the sustained inflation (i.e., a static sustained increase in the airway pressure [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] [40] protracted for 20-40 seconds) [39] . The target of these maneuvers is to increase the transpulmonary pressure for a period of time sufficiently long to reinflate the alveolar units previously closed. While these maneuvers are able to improve the oxygenation for a variable period of time, their systematic use did not result in a mortality reduction [40] . While the lung CT scan is the gold standard for the potential of recruitment evaluation, the lung ultrasound seems to be a promising alternative available at the patient's bedside with several advantages such as safety and repeatability; however further studies are necessary to confirm this data [41] .",

The PEEP optimization is therefore crucial in the individual patient to avoid the continuous opening and closing and the overdistention phenomena in some parenchymal areas. Different approaches have been proposed to choose the best PEEP, but the most commonly used is the one based on the PEEP/FiO 2 table, which use the patient's saturation/oxygenation as target [36] . Another method is based on the respiratory mechanics: PEEP is progressively increased while keeping the tidal volume constant and the airway pressure within a safety range (26-28 cmH 2 O) [42] . Conversely, our group uses the esophageal pressure variation during the breath, to evaluate the transpulmonary pressure. It is measured as: (plateau pressure \u2212 total PEEP) \u2212 (esophageal pressure at plateau \u2212 esophageal pressure at ZEEP ",

Therefore, to maintain low stress and strain, it is necessary to apply a low tidal volume or have a high residual functional capacity [42, 45] . A recent meta-analysis has shown how the use of \"protective ventilation,\" with a tidal volume of 6 mL/kg (calculated on kg of ideal body weight), guarantees a reduction in mortality [46] . Since the actual body weight isn't an accurate index of lung size, it is recommended the use of the ideal weight (calculated based on gender and height) to calculate the best tidal volume; however, the ideal weight is not correlated with the functional residual capacity of the lung, highlighting that the same tidal volume can generate very different stress and strain values [47] in people with the same gender and height but different functional residual capacity. Amato, in a recent study performed over a group of 3500 patients with ARDS ventilated with different combinations of PEEP and tidal volume, showed that the variable most closely associated with the outcome of patients is represented by the driving pressure of the airways, calculated as (plateau pressure \u2212 total PEEP). Furthermore in that study was demonstrated that high levels of PEEP appeared protective only when associated with reduced driving pressure, with a pressure cutoff of 15 cmH 2 O [48] . However, the use of driving pressure has several limitations: the main one is the fact that the pressure that extends the lung is the transpulmonary pressure and not the airway pressure.",

Meduri in his study carried out in the early phases of the ARDS, showed that the use of a decremental infusion scheme of corticosteroids leads to a mortality reduction in intensive care [57] . However, in other studies, this result has not been confirmed [58, 59] . Although nitric oxide (NO) has a known vasodilatory effect on the pulmonary vessels thus ensuring an improvement of the ventilation/perfusion coupling, its use in patients with ARDS is not universally accepted [60] .
