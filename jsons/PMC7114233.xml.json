            "text": "The history of medicinal plants dates back to the origin of human civilization on earth. Several of these may have been used to treat viral infections in the past, however, first recognized interest in their development as antiviral agent is the efforts of the Boots drug company (Nottingham, England) to screen 288 plants for anti-influenza activity (Chantrill et al., 1952). Later studies have reported the inhibitory effects of medicinal plants extracts on the replication of several viruses. Particularly herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) (Debiaggi et al., 1988), HIV (Asres and Bucar, 2005, Vermani and Garg, 2002), hepatitis B virus (HBV) (Huang et al., 2006, Kwon et al., 2005), and emerging viral infections associated with poxvirus and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) virus (Kotwal et al., 2005) were strongly inhibited by various plants extracts. Most of these studies have utilized either water soluble or alcoholic extracts of medicinal plants, and limited efforts have been directed toward the identification of active natural ingredient exhibiting antiviral effects. Moreover, recent studies showing antiviral potential of plant extracts against viral strains resistant to conventional antiviral agents (Serkedjieva, 2003, Tolo et al., 2006) have challenged the modern drug discovery practices, and deem a very careful look toward exploring natural antiviral components of medicinal plants.",

            "text": "The molecular mechanisms associated with the antiviral effects of plant extracts may vary among different viruses. However, the potentials of plant extract to boost inherent antiviral defense of human body which involves an intricate immune system might utilize common pathways. In recent past, a number of studies have explored immunostimulatory properties of plant extracts having antiviral properties (Webster et al., 2006). The root extracts of medicinal plant Heracleum maximum Bartr. (Umbelliferae) which possess antiviral effects besides antifungal and antibacterial properties, stimulated Interleukin 6 (IL-6) production in the macrophage activation assay, confirming antiviral effects association with the immunostimulatory properties (Webster et al., 2006). Furthermore, Plantago major Linn. and P. asiatica Linn. (Plantaginaceae) commonly used plants as folk medicine in Taiwan for the treatment of infectious diseases, exhibited lymphocyte proliferation and secretion of interferon-gamma (IFN-\u03b3) at low concentrations. Both lymphocyte proliferation activity and induced secretion of interferon-gamma (IFN-\u03b3) are indicators of cell-mediated immune response modulation (Chiang et al., 2003). Along with similar lines, Sambucol, a product isolated from Sambucus nigra L., which is effective against various strains of influenza had shown to boost immune responses by secreting inflammatory cytokines (IL-1 beta, TNF-alpha, IL-6, and IL-8) (Barak et al., 2001).",

Further exploration and identification of natural products for controlling HIV and associated infections is necessary due to several reasons. First, efforts in the past to find an effective cure for HIV infection has met with disappointing results. Second, development of vaccine for HIV pandemic seems a far-fetched dream. The most effective therapeutic regimen for HIV-infected individuals is highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) which is a combination of protease inhibitors and nucleoside or non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors. HAART can only control HIV infection among individuals continuously on therapeutic regimen and withdrawal of medication leads to reemergence of the diseases. Furthermore, based on HIV pathogenesis efforts have been made to target every step of viral life cycle starting from entry to viral morphogenesis as shown in Fig. 1\n, however, none of these strategies have led to cure.",

Screening of each and every plant or their individual parts (stem, leaves, roots, flowers, bark) for the identification of antiviral components is impossible. Current knowledge relevant to antiviral properties of medicinal plants is based on subjective information. There are also examples of antiviral properties of plants, or phytochemically screened products based on the properties of newly identified phytocomponents. One such example is a potential antiviral compound, cyanovirin N (CV-N), an 11-kDa protein isolated from the cyanobacterium Nostoc ellipsosporum. The CV-N possesses broad-spectrum antiviral activity besides inhibiting HIV-1 infection (Boyd et al., 1997) and is on the list of potentially emerging antiviral compounds (De Clercq, 2005, Witvrouw et al., 2005). The antiviral activity of CV-N has been dissected at molecular levels and involves highly specific interactions with the viral envelope glycoprotein gp120 (Barrientos et al., 2003, Esser et al., 1999). The viral envelope plays a major role in the infectivity of permissive cells and mediates interactions with permissive cells CD4 receptors in concert with chemokine receptors, CXCR4, CCR5. There is also a class of antiviral compounds known as HIV entry inhibitors, which interact either with viral envelope or host cell receptors mediating viral entry. Besides CV-N, Baicalin, another natural product originating from plant source interacts with chemokine receptors and inhibits entry of HIV (Kitamura et al., 1998, Li et al., 2000, Wang et al., 2004, Zhang et al., 1991). Now a days effort have been directed to characterize the anti-HIV activity of medicinal plants at molecular level. A recent study compared various plants and their individual parts (stem, leaves, roots, etc.) in inhibiting viral reverse transcriptase (RT) and integrase, the two essential enzymes in HIV infection (Bessong et al., 2006). In comparing organic solvents and aqueous fractions of various medicinal plants, the alcoholic, n-butanol fraction of the Bridelia micrantha (Hochst) showed highest anti-RT activity. None of the six potential antiviral medicinal plants tested in this study inhibited integration step. This study also identified a potential anti-RT component of a medicinal plant which requires further investigation. RT inhibitors are already in the armamentarium of anti-HIV agents. As RT plays a major role in controlling viral infectivity and replication, in the past, several reports have linked medicinal plants capability to inhibit RT activity an indirect measurement of anti-HIV effect (Fu et al., 2006, Kostova, 2006, Woradulayapinij et al., 2005).",

For example, aqueous extract of plant material has been used to treat HSV-associated infections. The phytochemical, Podophyllotoxin, isolated from the aqueous extract of Podophyllum peltatum L. inhibited HSV type 1 (HSV-1) (Bedows and Hatfield, 1982). Besides aqueous extracts, organic solvents extracts of various plants have also shown anti-HSV activity, suggesting varied nature of antivirals present in medicinal plants. Two compounds namely geraniin and 1,3,4,6-tetra-O-galloyl-beta-d-glucose (1346TOGDG), isolated from the acetone extract of another plant Phyllanthus urinaria, also suppressed HSV-2 and HSV-1 (Yang et al., 2007). HSV infections are usually serious problems among immunocompromised individuals, particularly HIV-infected individuals. Moreover, development of resistant herpes strains refractory to conventional antiviral drugs is also a major issue. There has always been a quest for antiviral which can overcome resistant strains of viruses or suppress emergence of viral resistance. Based on available information one can easily speculate about the presence of natural antiviral compounds effective against resistant strains of viruses. One such precedent is an aqueous extract from the roots of Carissa edulis (Forssk.) Vahl (Apocynaceae), a medicinal plant locally growing in Kenya, showing remarkable anti-HSV activity in vitro and in vivo for both wild type and resistant strains of HSV (Tolo et al., 2006).",

Clinical studies were also designed to compare anti-hepatitis B effects for different species of Phyllanthus, i.e. P. amarus (L.), P. niruri (L.) and P. urinaria (L.) (Wang et al., 1995). Molecular studies on antiviral potentials of P. amarus (L.) showed its inhibitory effect on HBV polymerase activity and mRNA transcription due to interactions with HBV enhancer I and C/EBP alpha and beta transcription factors (Lee et al., 1996, Ott et al., 1997). Microarray analyses revealed the anti-HBV activity of ethanolic extract of another member of Phyllanthus (P. nanus) due to over expression of several genes particularly annexin 7 (Anx7) (Lam et al., 2006).",

However, in the case of HBV infection in humans, duck hepatitis B virus (DHBV) model has served as an excellent screening system (Niu et al., 1990). The DHBV system has been used for screening anti-HBV effect of various medicinal plants. Based on previous observations, that suggested anti-HBV effect of Phyllanthus species, various members of this plant family were screened for their antiviral effects in DHBV model. Initial findings revealed that Phyllanthus amarus has no significant inhibitory effect on DHBV DNA replication in vivo (Niu et al., 1990). Further studies compared antiviral activity of P. amarus and P. maderas (Munshi et al., 1993a), P. maderaspatensis (Munshi et al., 1993b) in DHBV model and concluded that these medicinal plants do not have any therapeutic potential against HBV in humans as previously thought. Although P. nanus, another member of the Phyllanthus genus of plants showed strong inhibitory effect in controlling DHBV in primary cell culture model (Lam et al., 2006). Such controversial data need further investigation at molecular level to validate initial clinical data in the DHBV model. Besides resolving initial observation relevant to therapeutic development of Phyllanthus species plants, DHBV model has been very helpful in identifying a number of other plants which could be potentially utilized for isolation of candidate therapeutics for appropriate clinical trials. For example screening of 56 different Chinese medicinal herbs led to the identification of two potentials anti-DHBV plant extracts, i.e. Ardisia chinensis, and Pithecellobium clypearia (Leung et al., 2006). The identification of anti-HBV potentials of Oenanthe javanica Blume DC flavones (OjF), as a strong inhibitor of HBsAg and HBeAg secretion (involved in viral pathogenesis) in 2.2.15 cells and reducing DHBV-DNA levels in the HBV-infected duck model is also credited to this valuable model (Wang et al., 2005).",

Most of the books published in phytomedicine have mainly paid attention to classical isolation procedures. Unfortunately, some of these classical procedures have limitations of reproducibility and quality, thus compromising the safety and efficacy of phytomedicinal preparations. As such there is an urgent need to refine and further develop classical methodologies to obtain procedural consistency and highly pure plant components exhibiting medicinal value. In recent past, increased interest in traditional medicine has complemented quality awareness and refinement in extraction methodologies and standardization of procedures for phytochemedicinal products isolation (Atta-ur-Rahman and Choudhary, 1998, Ong, 2004). To ensure high quality herbal preparations, efforts are ongoing to replace traditional methodologies with modern sample preparation and extraction procedures. Classical solvent separation of phytomedicinal products is being complemented with modern techniques like microwave-assisted extraction, pressurized-liquid extraction, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (Wu et al., 2007) and several others. To further facilitate plant-based drug discovery efforts are also being directed toward standardization of methodologies which can be used to study pharmacokines/pharmacodynamics behavior of phytomedicinal products (Lin et al., 2005).",

Improved separation technologies offer potentials to screen medicinal plant's anti-infectious/antiviral nature. Several problems previously thought to be hurdle in the medicinal plants antiviral drug discovery program are no longer an issue. For example screening of the antiviral potentials of plant extracts always posed a threat of incidental infection to the workers.

Since the expression of first subunit vaccine for HBV surface antigen in 1992, several other different vaccine antigens have been successfully expressed in plants and their safety has been assessed in animal and humans (Glenz and Warzecha, 2006, Ma et al., 2003, Thanavala et al., 2005). While considering this aspect of plants for treating human viral diseases one has to be careful, as majority of viral vaccines are constituted of attenuated or inactivated viral particles. Due to these limitations efforts have been directed toward expressing coat proteins of different viruses which are presumed to assemble as virus-like-particles (VLP) in plants and are antigenic in nature. Several other issues like appropriate processing of protein to be expressed in plants are important aspects to be considered.",

One such issue is the isolation of active ingredient associated with the medicinal characteristics of a particular plant. In certain parts of the world crude plant extracts are used in healthcare and their efficacy is well-documented without any side effects. Although it will be hard to get these plant extracts approved through international regulatory agencies such as the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) of the United States of America or other equivalent European counterparts, however, for countries with limited resources, government sponsored explorations will serve as a gateway for merging of modern drug discovery with conventional Chinese/Eastern medicine. Moreover, considering the problems faced by the developed world such as drug resistance and failure in finding an effective vaccine for deadly infectious agent such as HIV, a causative agent for deadly AIDS, phytomedicinal products may provide a hope.",

It is only experience of the indigenous people using a particular plant/phytochemical product for treating an ailment. Clinical findings such as co-administration of medicinal plants kava-kava and St. John's Wort leading to hepatotoxicity (Musch et al., 2006) should be made available to the healthcare providers practicing traditional medicine. Generally, herbal remedies are perceived as harmless, however, several reports suggest hepatotoxicity associated with herbal medication (Pak et al., 2004, Schiano, 2003). Publication of scientific reports relevant to the cytotoxicities of medicinal plants usage should be encouraged and incorporated into a universal database system. Moreover, larger randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled multicenter clinical trials should be conducted before incorporation of a particular herbal remedy in treating people.",
