Approximately one-third of patients (33.8%) had COVID-19 at the time of admission.3 The nosocomial infection rate among COVID-19 patients was 7.1% (65 of 918). The most common nosocomial infection was pneumonia (32.3%), followed by bacteremia (24.6%), and urinary tract infection (21.5%). In total, among the 43 pathogens isolated from nosocomial infections, 17 were gram-positive bacteria, 21 were gram-negative bacteria, and 5 were fungi. Onset of nosocomial infection occurred as early as day 7 of the course of illness and as late as day 22, with an average of 14.3 \u00b1 8 d. The mortality of COVID-19 patients with nosocomial infection was 15.4%, significantly higher than that of COVID-19 patients without nosocomial infection (7.3%; odds ratio [OR], 3.87; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.84\u20134.16; P = .045).",

Rational utilization of antibiotics and steroids to treat patients with COVID-19 is important in preventing nosocomial infection, and special attention should be given to diabetic patients and patients with invasive devices (ie, CVC or PICC). Future studies are warranted to evaluate the efficacy of implementing infection control strategies or protocols on COVID-19 patients to achieve better therapeutic outcomes.",
