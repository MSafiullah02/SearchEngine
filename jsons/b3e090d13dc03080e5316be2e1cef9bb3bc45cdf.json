Expenses associated with vaccine R&D, testing and manufacturing as well as a poor profit margin compared with current drug markets, have led to a dramatic fall in funding from profit-driven pharmaceutical companies (Offit, 2005) . However, this decline is thought to be premature. As demonstrated throughout this review, VLP technologies are advancing rapidly with a strong focus on developing platform capabilities and improving VLP production yields to enable rapid production of safer and cheaper vaccines, particularly when combined with single-use bioprocessing systems. This progress is set to continue with financial investment provided from \"not-for-profit,\" sources, such as national governments, international organizations, and philanthropic bodies. In particular, Gavi, the vaccine Alliance (Balaji, 2004) and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation (www.gatesfoundation.org) are motivated to deliver affordable vaccines to third world countries that are the world's biggest vaccine market. To ensure vaccine purity, safety, efficacy, and stability, regulatory authorities govern every stage of vaccine manufacturing from raw materials and production processes to clinical trials and beyond. This includes the assessment and certification of safe and viable manufacturing processes (S. Plotkin et al., 2017) . Meeting regulatory requirements can be a complicated process, particularly when manufacturing vaccines for overseas markets or utilizing newly developed bioprocesses.

Indeed, the last decade has witnessed a trend toward the use of alternative vaccine designs to attenuated pathogens, having VLPs emerged as a powerful and versatile platform for their production. Today, VLPs are being used not only as vaccines of unmodified viral assemblies against parental viruses but also as scaffolds for displaying heterologous antigens. In addition, tremendous investments have been made to develop new technologies capable of (a) deciphering pathogen biology and vaccine mechanistic responses, and (b) storing and curating extracted data into biological references databases. Machine learning algorithms can then use this information for epitope prediction and structure-based modular design. Complemented with synthetic biology, this information will provide the basis for (a) engineering VLP functions and (a) developing generic VLP platforms offering not only the potential for streamlined bioprocesses, parallel infrastructure, and predictable biosafety but also the ability to manufacture vaccines against unrelated viruses or pathogens from other sources (i.e., bacteria and parasitic protozoans).

The ultimate goal being the incorporation of specific antigenic regions on a VLP scaffold. Thus, improving vaccine specificity for generation of effective vaccines.

VLPs can be engineered to enhance and tune the immune response to vaccination. Using synthetic biology tools, one can harbor immunogens inside or outside the VLP that upon vaccination are capable of triggering an early innate immune response that enhances vaccine effectiveness by increasing vaccine's uptake(Rosenthal, Chen, Baker, Putnam, & DeLisa, 2014). These immunomodulatory agents (e.g., pattern recognition receptor ligands, dendritic cells targeting antibodies, and endoplasmic reticulum targeting peptides) boost the immune response mainly through expansion of specific CD8+ T cells and the production of cytokines (without any long-lasting effects).", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF2": {"text": "VLPs used to display foreign antigens are HBcAg(Chu et al., 2016), HPV L1 protein(Slupetzky et al., 2001), and Q\u03b2 (O'Rourke, Peabody, &Chackerian, 2015).", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF3": {"text": "Novel strategies are, therefore, under development to create broadly cross-protective vaccines. Highly conserved antigens have been identified between divergent influenza viruses. These broadly reactive antigens, which are located within the membrane proximal stalk domain of the hemagglutinin protein have been inserted into VLPs and demonstrate success as vaccines candidates(Ben-Yedidia, 2011;Krammer, 2015;Wiersma, Rimmelzwaan, & de Vries, 2015). Broad protection is also possible through the simultaneous display of multiple, antigenically distinct(Prabakaran et al., 2010;Pushko et al., 2011;Schwartzman et al., 2015), or chimeric(Carter et al., 2016) HA antigens from different influenza subtypes within the same VLP.4 | VLP-BASED PLATFORM TECHNOLOGYThe engineering of viral structural proteins to display heterologous antigens presents an opportunity to manufacture vaccines against unrelated viruses, as well as pathogens from other sources, that is,bacteria and parasitic protozoans. This versatile nature, coupled with the suite of VLPs amenable to modularization, makes VLPs ideal candidates for the development of vaccine platforms. Noninfectious, generic VLP platforms offer the potential for streamlined bioprocesses, parallel infrastructure, predictable biosafety, and regulatory practices (Charlton Hume & Lua, 2017), which, in turn, would significantly reduce vaccine production times. Given the lack of preparedness during recent global outbreaks of influenza A (H1N1) (Fineberg, 2014), Zika (Boeuf, Drummer, Richards, Scoullar, & Beeson, 2016), and Ebola virus(Coltart, Lindsey, Ghinai, Johnson, & Heymann, 2017), as well as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome(Okba, Raj, & Haagmans, 2017), VLP platform technologies are pertinent to address the rapid spread of emergent viruses.4.1 | Platform capabilitiesSeveral viral structural proteins and bacteriophages are currently under development as vaccine platforms to target a variety of pathogens(Tables 1,2). Synthetic biology approaches have widened the scope of potential antigens for modularization and show that platforms can be modified to overcome specific challenges associated with VLP vaccine manufacturing(Figure 2). Nonenveloped VLPs are structurally less complex than their enveloped counterparts and can be produced in prokaryotic and lower order eukaryotic systems making them easily scalable, cost-effective, and rapid to manufacture.The presence of a lipid bilayer in enveloped VLPs necessitates the use of eukaryotic hosts for expression, which increases the overall production time and cost. Nonetheless, unlike nonenveloped VLPs, enveloped VLPs permit presentation of antigenic modules that require membrane-association.", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF4": {"text": "maintain the structural properties of complex peptides as shown with the presentation of a 20aa A-helix of the influenza HA2 chain on the FHV platform(Schneemann et al., 2012). This strategy, however, requires detailed structural knowledge of the chosen peptide and the identification of a suitable scaffold fragment. Antigens inserted into the immunodominant loops of the HBcAg platform require closely juxtaposed N-and C-termini to maintain VLP integrity(Walker et al., 2011). This imposes considerable limitations upon antigen choice. To support the modularization of antigens that possess an extended structure, a SplitCore system has thus been devised(Walker et al., 2011). Dividing the HBcAg core protein within the immunodominant c/e1 loop yields two fragments, which are able to form VLPs when coexpressed. Fusion of antigen to the c/e1 termini of either fragment before coexpression enables modularization of antigens that may otherwise have been structurally incompatible.", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF5": {"text": "AviTag and SpyTag/SpyCatcher platforms allow the conjugation of antigens post VLP assembly through biotin-streptavidin reactions (AviTag) or spontaneous formation of an irreversible isopeptide bond (SpyTag/SpyCatcher). With linkers already predefined, platforms remain constant permitting high throughput screening of vaccine candidates. In addition, independent production of the antigen in a different expression system is possible and of particular interest, if posttranslational modifications are critical for immunogenicity, provided these do not sterically inhibit attachment. Encapsulation of host-cell proteins and nucleic acid during cellbased VLP assembly can alter immunogenicity and contribute significantly to the batch-to-batch variation of vaccine preparations. Specific limitations regarding host contaminants are clearly stipulated in licensing regulations. Host contaminants can be removed by VLP disassembly and ex vivo reassembly, as necessitated for licensing of HPV L1 VLPs (McCarthy, White, Palmer-Hill, Koenig, & Suzich, 1998). Unfavorably, this complicates downstream processing and adds to manufacturing costs.

The vast majority of studies producing M1-VLPs utilize either mammalian cell lines (transient or stable expression) or insect cell lines (mainly transient expression using the baculovirus expression system, IC-BEVS). Synthetic biology has recently been applied to the IC-BEVS platform to overcome process-related drawbacks. When produced in IC-BEVS, VLPs and baculovirus are not easily separated owing to current limitations in purification and analytical techniques. A recently developed biorthogonal labeling strategy enables distinction between baculovirus and HA containing M1-VLPs. Thus, allowing greater control over vaccine contaminants (Carvalho et al., 2016). This system involves fluorescent labeling of an azide-tagged noncanonical amino acid, which is incorporated into the HA protein within the enveloped VLP. Combinatorial analysis using size exclusion chromatography (SEC), confocal microscopy, and flow cytometry demonstrated the possibility of obtaining VLPs independently of baculovirus.

E. coli is far superior to other expression systems in terms of cost, yield, and speed making it a popular choice for the production of single capsid protein nonenveloped VLPs (X.Huang, Wang, Zhang, Xia, & Zhao, 2017). The inability of E. coli to perform posttranslational modifications means that complexity is minimized. In cases where posttranslational complex modification is required, IC-BEVS is used to manufacture licensed VLP vaccines, such as Cervarix \u00ae and Porcilis PCV \u00ae , yet vaccine costs are high, owing partly to low production yield.Synthetic engineering of baculovirus vectors using combinations of transcriptional or translational elements can increase yield in this system (G\u00f3mez-Sebasti\u00e1n,L\u00f3pez-Vidal, & Escribano, 2014;Liu, Zhang, et al., 2015). Similarly, a synthetically designed expression cassette, containing rearranged genetic regulatory elements, transcription factors IE1 and IE0 and a transcription enhancer sequence linked to differential promoters, increased both expression and cell viability of porcine circovirus VLPs and rabbit hemorrhagic disease VLPs in IC-BEVS.Maintaining VLP integrity is another key consideration. In multiprotein capsids, specific protein ratios are required to prevent aggregation of unassembled VLPs (L. A.Palomares & Ramirez, 2009;Rold\u00e3o et al., 2012). Protein stoichiometry can be controlled in IC-BEVS and mammalian expression systems through manipulating multiplicity of infection, transfection ratios, or thermodynamics(Arevalo, Wong, & Ross, 2016; L. A. Palomares & Ramirez, 2009;Rold\u00e3o et al., 2012) though it involves increased process cost. Different strength promoters can also be synthetically integrated into multicistronic vectors resulting in differential expression of individual proteins(Jere, O'Neill, Potgieter, & van Dijk, 2014). However, given that optimal ratios vary depending on the specific VLP, individual optimization is required.

The Protein Variability Server (PVS) is a valuable tool for the identification of such conserved epitopes, which can facilitate the development of broadly protective vaccines (Garcia-Boronat, Diez-Rivero,Reinherz, & Reche, 2008). In this study, PVS was used to identify a conserved fragment in the ectodomain of HIV-1-gp41. Several databases retain classified and well-curated data from experimentally verified vaccines and/or vaccine components and, thus, are useful tools for vaccine design. The Immune Epitope Database and Analysis Resource(Peters et al., 2005; https://www.iedb.org) collects all published experimental data characterizing immune epitopes and the context in which the molecular structure is recognized as an epitope by the immune receptors. IEDB has over 88,382 epitopes and multiple tools to identify B-and T-cell epitopes(Vita et al., 2015).

A.Plotkin, Mahmoud, & Farrar, 2015). VLP vaccines have been under development for >30 years. Today there are six commercially licensed VLP vaccines and over 110 VLP vaccine trials (completed and current) documented at www. clinicaltrials.gov. Over 50% of these trials are designed to assess VLP vaccine candidates against various cancers (where Merck Sharp & Dohme Corp. and GlaxoSmithKline plc. are the leading sponsors) and over 20% against influenza (where Novavax, Inc. and Medicago Inc. dominate the trials). VBI Vaccines Inc. and Takeda Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd. are currently conducting trials for vaccines against cytomegalovirus and norovirus, respectively. India-based manufacturers, CPL Biologicals Pvt. Ltd. have developed Cadiflu-S, the world's first VLP influenza vaccine to successfully complete phase 3 trials (http://cadilapharma.com). These multistage clinical trials assess safety and efficacy and determine the suitability of vaccine candidates for licensing approval. Successful translation of vaccines, however, depends upon viable vaccine manufacturing processes to ensure reliable vaccine supply and to minimize production costs.", "latex": null, "type": "table"}}, "back_matter": []}
