            "text": "Early studies of mitotic chromosomes of the domestic cat revealed an easily distinguishable karyotype consisting of 18 autosomal chromosomes and the XY sex chromosome pair, resulting in a 2N complement of 38 chromosomes for the cat genome (Figure 43-1\n).57, 58, 59, 60 Cat chromosomes are fortuitously easily distinguishable, clearly defined by size, centromere position, distinctive giemsa banding patterns of the short (p) and long (q) arms of each chromosome, and the presence of only a few small acrocentric chromosomes, which have no p arms and are traditionally hard to distinguish. Various cytogenetic techniques, such as R-, RBG-banding and fragile site studies, have also helped distinguish and characterize the cat chromosomes.47, 48, 49, 52 For example, cats do not have a significant fragile X site on the X chromosome that is found in humans and is associated with mental retardation. Although a sequential numbering of the chromosomes has been suggested,3 the historical classification of chromosomes into morphologic groups has been retained in the cat. Hence cats have three large metacentric chromosomes (A1 to A3), four large subtelomeric chromosomes (B1 to B4), two medium-size metacentrics (C1 and C2), four small subtelomerics (D1 to D4), three small metacentrics (E1 to E3), and two small acrocentrics (F1 and F2). The X chromosome is midsize and subtelomeric, similar to chromosome B4.",

Karyotypic studies of male tortoiseshell cats have shown that they are often mosaics, or chimeras, being XX/XY in all or some tissues.* The minor chromosomal differences that are cytogenetically detectable between a domestic cat and an Asian leopard cat are likely the cause of fertility problems in the Bengal cat breed, which is a hybrid between these two species.

For example, the p arm of human chromosome 1 (1p) is largely composed of the same genes that are on the cat chromosome defined as C1, whereas human chromosome 1q is composed of genes that are found on cat chromosome F1. The chromosome painting technique could also be performed reciprocally, implying painting cat chromosomes onto human mitotic chromosome spreads and human chromosomes onto cat mitotic chromosome spreads, revealing the high conservation of chromosomal arrangement of cat to humans,56, 61 specifically compared to mice.53 Thus chromosome painting gave an excellent overview of cat genome organization,38 which greatly facilitates candidate gene approaches because the location of particular genes could be anticipated in cats from comparison with the genetic map of humans.55 This additional confirmation of conservation to human, with regard to genome organization, further supported additional genetic resource development for the cat as a valuable animal model for human disease.",

The cell line of one species\u2014usually a rodent, such as a mouse or Chinese hamster\u2014is compromised in some way, such as by having an enzyme deficiency that causes growth incompatibility in non-supplemented media. The cell line from the species of interest, in this case the cat, is damaged by a different, chemical means. The fusion of the two compromised cell lines leads to the chromosomes of the cat integrating into the nucleus and sometimes the chromosomes of the rodent cell line, which then rescues the rodent cell line as a functional enzyme is now present to support the growth of fusion cells. Many different fusion lines are maintained and propagated; however, the entire complement of cat chromosomes is never completely retained in a given cell line. Thus a given cell line will have all the rodent chromosomes, which happen to be mainly acrocentric chromosomes, and only one or a few cat chromosomes. A proper somatic cell hybrid panel would have a representation of at least each of the cat chromosomes in the set of fusion cell lines. Analysis of the mitotic chromosomes of the cell lines can often show which specific cat chromosome may be present because the cat chromosomes are clearly distinguished from those of rodents by size and shape. These cell lines can then be assayed for the presence or absence of specific proteins, or DNA sequences, thereby indicating that the genes that create the proteins or are represented by the DNA segments must reside on the cat chromosome that is within the cell line. This mapping approach provided the first rudimentary genetic map of the cat with 105 different loci,35 including the association for the genes for hemoglobin beta (HBB) and tyrosinase (TYR).36 The HBB polymorphism was shown to be associated with the Siamese coloration, also known as points. Recently, this coloration has been proved to be a mutation in TYR.\n13, 23, 51\n",

The Bengal cat breed has been influential in the construction of the first genetic maps of the cat. Bengals are a hybrid between domestic cats, primarily Abyssinians and Egyptian or Indian Maus, and a different species of felid, the Asian leopard cat (Felis [Prionailurus] bengalensis). The breed was developed in the late 1960s15 and is now one of the most popular breeds in the world, although not all registries recognize it. The evolutionary distance between the parental type cats of the Bengal breed is significant.16, 17 The millions of years of evolution between a leopard cat and a domestic cat have made the DNA sequence of each gene more genetically diverse than the gene sequence found between any two domestic cats or any two leopard cats. Thus a pedigree consisting of the first-generation Bengals (F1) and a second-generation backcross to one of the parental-type cats was the basis of the first recombination map for the cat.26 Genetic variation is required to build a genetic map based on recombination, and because these Bengal crosses would generate offspring with very high genetic polymorphism, the interspecies cross was efficient. The first version of feline interspecies hybrid-based linkage map contained approximately 250 microsatellite markers (also known as short tandem repeats [STRs]).26 This map was effective for the initiation of pedigree studies for families segregating for particular phenotypic traits or diseases. Although rudimentary, the interspecies backcross map assisted targeted candidate gene approaches\u2014in particular, the discovery of the mutation that causes feline polycystic kidney disease (PKD).62 The genetic map also led to the discovery that a chromosomal rearrangement involving the gene LIX1 causes spinal muscular atrophy in the Maine Coon cat.8, 12\n",

RH panels are a variation of the somatic cell hybrid technique.6 Radiation is used to fragment the DNA from the cat cell line, which is then rescued by the fusion process with the rodent cell line. Because the radiation fragments the DNA, smaller fragments get retained readily throughout the rodent chromosomes in the hybrid cells, not complete chromosomes. When the hybrid cells are tested for the presence or absence of a gene, genes must be in very close proximity to be found in the same cell line. Thus RH panels can map genes that are within 1 Mb or less on a chromosome. This level of resolution is a great improvement over a somatic cell hybrid panel and slightly better than a genetic map derived by recombination events in cat families. The current 5000Rad radiation hybrid map of the cat has had several reiterations and currently has a 1.5 Mb resolution, consisting of 1793 markers.24, 25, 30, 31, 32, 33 The RH map has also proved useful for assisting with sequence assembly for the feline genome sequencing project.",

The sequence assembly suggested the identification of 20,285 feline genes that have counterparts (orthologs) in the human genome.

The better coverage implies that more cat-specific genetic sequence will be known for any gene of interest. Mutation screening methods will be more efficient, leading to the identification of causative mutations more rapidly and more efficiently. In addition to more genetic variation being identified in the Abyssinian cat used for the feline genome project, additional cats were partially sequenced as well. Four representatives from six breeds, including Birman, Maine Coon, Norwegian Forest Cat, Egyptian Mau, Japanese Bobtail, and Turkish Van, were sequenced. A pool of wildcats was also included, as well as four random-bred cats from Southeast Asia. In addition, Hill's Pet Nutrition, Inc. supported a private sequencing effort, which included Sanger-based sequencing of single cats from five different breeds (Persian, Siamese, Ragdoll, Cornish Rex, Burmese) and also a western random-bred cat and an African wildcat.

The SNPs can be verified to be specific to one breed or common across many breeds and populations. The genome assembly supports the proper positioning of the SNPs across the genome. A resource called a DNA array or DNA chip can then be produced that contains assays for the highly polymorphic and evenly dispersed SNPs; thus these arrays can assess the entire genome of the cat in one experiment. Hill's Pet Nutrition, Inc. has also provided funding to support feline genome resource development12a; a cat SNP-based DNA array was commissioned and is due for release in early 2012. Each DNA chip, which is about the size of a microscope slide, has 12 regions; each region is used to test one cat. Each region has the assays for approximately 63,000 SNPs. The major benefit of the arrays is that they allow assessment of the entire genome; these are known as genome-wide association studies (GWASs). Because the SNPs are at such a high density, the cats used for a GWAS can be from a population, not direct relatives. Thus individual cases of diseases or traits can be examined from a population or across breeds and populations; cases (cats with the trait) and controls (cats without the trait) are required. In addition, because there is less concern for the mode of inheritance of the trait, a GWAS can be performed even with traits that may have complex inheritance but a high heritability or relative risk in a population. Fewer cases are required to investigate a recessive trait, more for a dominant trait, and even more for complex traits that cause an increased relative risk\u2014the lower the relative risk, the more cases required.",

The lower the LD, the lower the power of the SNPs to identify an association with a trait of interest. Thus either more SNPs are needed, or more cases and controls are required if LD is low, to have effective association studies. Because the chip will have a defined set of SNPs, the LD estimates will predict the number of cases and controls for a study. For a recessive trait, perhaps 30 cases and 30 controls will be required (typical for the dog),18 but if the population under consideration has high LD, fewer samples will be required.

            "text": "The available genetic resources for the cat are no longer a research bottleneck for feline studies; however, the acquisition of appropriate patients for sufficient cases and controls remains a rate limiting step. Hence the primary care veterinarian, veterinary specialists, and veterinary researchers need to join forces to properly characterize diseases and routinely collect research materials so that patients are not lost to important studies and health investigations. The development of the DNA tests for parentage and identification (http://www.isag.org.uk/), coat colors, and the prominent diseases (e.g., PKD and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy) has encouraged cat breeders to explore genetic research more openly and has encouraged their participation in research studies. For these reasons more cat breeders are banking DNA material from their animals and providing DNA to service and research laboratories. Many veterinary hospitals and large clinical conglomerates are developing electronic database systems that could facilitate the identification of proper patients, cases, and controls. Combined with DNA banking and specialty health care, the veterinary world stands to enhance the possibilities of complex disease research in the cat by leaps and bounds. Even though the origins of the cat remain a mystery and domesticated may not be the most appropriate term for the domestic cat, researchers are unlocking its genetic secrets to explain its form and function.",

This comparative approach indicates that if a gene of interest is known to be on human chromosome 13, its location can be predicted to be on chromosome A1p of the cat.",
