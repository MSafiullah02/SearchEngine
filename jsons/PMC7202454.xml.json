There is evidence that thousands of years ago, viruses (eg, small pox and polio) affected humans; these and other viruses were most likely present long before that [1]. Diseases that were caused by viruses were described long before the actual filterable agents were isolated and called viruses at the end of the nineteenth century. One important step in evaluating viruses was Koch's postulates. Dr. Koch stated that the following should be demonstrated before determining an agent as being the cause of a disease:The agent must be present in every case of the disease.The agent must be isolated and grown in vitro.The disease must be reproduced when a pure culture is inoculated into a susceptible host.The same agent must be recovered again from the experimentally infected host [2].\n",

Differences in replication strategy may be used to classify viruses by method of transcription, assembly, and release.

In most cases, however, the death of the cell results from the virus \u201ctake over\u201d of the cellular machinery for virus replication. Interference with cellular DNA, RNA, and protein synthesis may occur. The structures of the cell, including cell membrane and cytoskeleton, may be perturbed. Many viruses induce cell lysis for release from the cell, whereas others induce apoptosis. At a minimum, the function of the cell may be altered, and at most, the cell is destroyed. Lastly, cell death or injury may result from the host's immune response to the virus. This is due to destruction of infected cells and to so-called \u201cbystander killing\u201d of adjacent cells. Significant tissue damage can result in persistent infections where the antigen persists. Lesions may be due to production of immune complexes, cell-mediated destruction, and complement activation [5].",
