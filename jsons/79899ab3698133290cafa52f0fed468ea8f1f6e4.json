            "text": "The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV2 causes COVID-19, a pandemic threatening millions. As protective immunity does not exist in humans and the virus is capable of escaping innate immune responses, it can proliferate, unhindered, in primarily infected tissues. Subsequent cell death results in the release of virus particles and intracellular components to the extracellular space, which result in immune cell recruitment, the generation of immune complexes and associated damage. Infection of monocytes/macrophages and/or recruitment of uninfected immune cells can result in massive inflammatory responses later in the disease. Uncontrolled production of pro-inflammatory mediators contributes to ARDS and cytokine storm syndrome. Antiviral agents and immune modulating treatments are currently being trialled. Understanding immune evasion strategies of SARS-CoV2 and the resulting delayed massive immune response will result in the identification of biomarkers that predict outcomes as well as phenotype and disease stage specific treatments that will likely include both antiviral and immune modulating agents.",

Over the last two decades, three novel Betacoronaviruses, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS)-CoV, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS)-CoV and SARS-CoV2, have crossed the species barrier and caused significant outbreaks characterized by high case-fatality rates in humans (2) (3) (4) . The latest addition to human pathogenic coronaviruses (hCoVs) is SARS-CoV2, the cause of COVID-19. At the time of submission of this review SARS-CoV2 has infected over 2.6 million people worldwide and claimed 185.000 lives, threatening many more (https://gisanddata.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299 423467b48e9ecf6).

            "text": "The first hCoVs were described in 1966, E229-CoV and OC43-CoV (5, 6) . They are part of a group of currently four known seasonal hCoVs (shCoV) that also includes HKU1-CoV and NL63-CoV, which were only discovered in 2005 (7, 8) . All shCoVs are globally endemic and frequently cause common colds, accounting for 2-18% of all respiratory tract infections (9) (10) (11) (12) (13) . By their fourth birthday, 75% of children show antibodies directed against at least one of the shCoVs (14, 15) . Anti-shCoVs antibodies provide some cross-immunity and antibodymediated protection against infection by other species within the group (16) . While their overall pathogenic potential is comparatively low, in the immunocompromised, infants, the elderly and those with pre-existing pulmonary disorders, shCoVs can cause severe respiratory or sepsis-like presentations (17) (18) (19) (20) (21) . OC43 displays some neurotropism and can cause demyelination and CNS infections in vulnerable patient groups (22, 23) . While estimates of their contribution to annual respiratory illness vary, shCoVs remain asymptomatic in approximately 50% of cases (24) (25) (26) . This is in stark contrast to the clinical presentation encountered in infections with so-called \"novel coronaviruses\" SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV2, which are associated with morbidity and case-fatality ratios that far exceed the ones in shCoVs. than 60 years (28) . Health care workers in contact with SARS patients demonstrated a very low seroconversion rate of 2% in asymptomatic individuals. Less than 5% of all affected were children, and post-containment seroprevalence among children considered high-risk for significant exposure was extremely low. This suggests that subclinical SARS among children had not occurred (29) (30) (31) . Approximately 20% of SARS patients required intensive care support for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), half of who died within the following 28 days (32) .",

This soon led to the implication of the host response as an important factor in this fulminant disease process (38) . Animal models of SARS suggest that lung inflammation intensifies after viral clearance, peaking as late as 14 days after infection (39) , and similar observations were made in human SARS patients. This suggests that clinical deterioration later in the disease course was likely not due to uncontrolled viral replication, but rather uncontrolled immune responses and associated damage (40, 41) .",

Coronavirinae include the genera Alpha-, Betacoronaviruses, infecting only mammals, and Gamma-, and Deltacoronaviruses which infect both mammals and birds. Human CoVs E229 and NL63 are human pathogenic alpha-, while OC43 and HKU1 and all novel CoVs (including SARS-CoV2) are betacoronaviruses. The potential of Toroviruses to cause disease is humans is unknown https://talk.ictvonline.org/ictv-reports/ictv_9th_report/positive-sense-rna-viruses-2011/w/posrna_viruses/222/coronaviridae . Coronaviruses (CoVs) are large enveloped viruses with a single-stranded, nonsegmented, positive sense RNA genome that spans approximately 30 kilobases, making it the largest known genome of any RNA virus (56) . Being RNA viruses, CoVs readily evolve by mutation and homologous and non-homologous recombination, which expands their host range and facilitates crossing of species barriers. Extensive animal reservoirs, especially among bats, genetic recombination among CoVs, and their plasticity in terms of receptor use renders CoVs highly effective at host switching, sometimes across wide taxonomic distances (57, 58) .",

The virus membrane contains four structural components, the spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M) and nucelocapsid (N) protein (56) (figure 1). For SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2, the S protein is the primary determinant for host tropism and pathogenicity. It is the main target for neutralizing antibodies and therefore of great interest in terms of immunological response and vaccine design (64) . The spike structure is formed by homotrimers of S-glycoproteins, each of which consists of two subunits, whereby S1 forms the part involved in receptor recognition, and S2 is highly conserved, anchors the protein in the viral membrane and facilitates viral fusion (65) (66) (67) . S1 contains a hypervariable loop which differs greatly between betacoronaviruses on both size and sequence. Viral entry requires the proteolysis of the S protein in two locations, a process that utilizes host proteases, and results in irreversible conformational changes of the S protein (64, 67) . Some anti-SARS-CoV antibodies in humans mimic receptor engagement, thus modeling conformational S protein changes upon antigen-antibody interaction (67) . The amino acid sequence of receptor binding sites of SARS-CoV2 is 74% homologous to that of SARS-CoV suggesting similar or even identical cell entry mechanisms for both viruses (68) .",

Expression of T1IFN and down-stream signals modulate cell responses and reprogram cells into an \"anti-viral state\", subsequently promoting infection control and pathogen clearance (85) . As a first step, immune cells sense viral infection through identification of virus derived pattern associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), such as viral RNA. These bind to and activate pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) in/on immune cells and result in immune cell activation ( Figure 2 ). RNAs viruses, such as SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV2 and MERS-CoV are detected by endosomal RNA PRRs, including Toll-like receptors (TLR-)3 and 7 and/or cytoplasmic RNA sensors, namely retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) and melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5 (MDA5) (figure 2). Usually, TLR3/7 activation results in nuclear translocation of the transcription factors NF\u03baB and IRF3, while RIG-1/MDA5 activation result in activation of IRF3. In turn, this triggers increased expression of T1IFN (through IRF3) and other innate pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1, IL-6, TNF-\u03b1 through NF\u03baB) (76, 86) . In this context, T1IFN and other innate pro-inflammatory cytokines promote their own expression through auto-amplification: T1IFN activate the IFN-\u03b1 receptor complex (IFNAR) which results in the phosphorylation/activation of STAT family transcription factors 1 and 2 (figure 2), while IL-1, IL-6, and TNF receptor activation feeds into pro-inflammatory J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f cytokine expression though the transcription factor NF\u03baB (figure 2) (85) (86) (87) .

Three early studies from Wuhan linked cytopenia and/or significantly elevated inflammatory parameters with severe disease and unfavorable outcomes. One study, involving 99 patients reported neutrophilia (38%), lymphopenia (35%), and increased systemic inflammatory proteins (IL-6 in 52%, and CRP in 84%) as common symptoms in COVID-19 disease (72) . Another study involving 41 individuals, linked severe disease culminating in ICU admission and mortality, with neutrophilia and lymphopenia (4) . The third study reported significant leukopenia (11.8%), lymphopenia (77.6%), thrombopenia (41.2%), anemia (48.2%), hypofibrinogenemia (22.4%), and hypo-albuminemia (78.8%) in a cohort of 85 patients who died from COVID-19 (83, 92) . These observations are in line with findings in severe or lethal cases of SARS and MERS, in which increased numbers of neutrophils and monocytes/macrophages are present in the airways (83, 93) . Other groups reported severe clinical phenotypes and ICU dependency of patients to be associated with increased plasma levels of innate chemokines, specifically C-X-C motif chemokine 10 (CXCL10)/Interferon gamma-induced protein 10 (IP-10), chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 2 (CCL2)/monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1), Macrophage Inflammatory Protein (MIP-)1A/CCL3, and the pro-inflammatory cytokine TNF-\u03b1 (2). This, indeed, is similar to the situation reported in SARS and MERS in which uncontrolled inflammation centrally contributes to poor outcomes (94) (95) (96) .",

One possible explanation is the induction of endothelial and vascular cell damage and cell death as a result of viral replication. Virus-induced inflammatory cell death, including necrosis or pyroptosis result in pro-inflammatory cytokine expression, (uninfected) immune cell recruitment and activation (97) . Mice infected with SARS-CoV exhibit excessive T1IFN secretion from myeloid cells in infected tissues. Indeed, immune evasion through the suppression of anti-viral responses and T1IFN expression in respiratory epithelia results in high viral loads (38) . From this, it is hypothesized that (not infected) monocytes/macrophages and neutrophils recruited to the site of infection exhibit strong and poorly controlled inflammatory responses, resulting in tissue damage and systemic inflammation, both of which contribute to morbidity and mortality (53) (Figure 3) .",

Indeed, adaptive immune cells, namely T lymphocytes, which are observed in lung tissue sections of COVID-19 patients with ARDS and/or cytokine storm, may drive inflammation at later disease stages. Similar mechanisms have been reported in influenza and other viral infections (104, 105) . Overall, severely ill COVID-19 patients experiencing cytokine storm exhibit lymphopenia and sometimes atrophy of the lymphatic tissues, namely lymph nodes and spleen (51, 106, 107) .

This is surprising as children are prone to viral infections including severe manifestations. More than 75% of children get exposed to seasonal coronaviruses before their 4 th birthday and seroconverts. However, antibody titres wane over time, most obvious in those over 60 years (110) . This may reduce immune response to SARS-CoV2 in the elderly as (limited) cross-reactivity between antiseasonal coronavirus and anti-SARS antibodies exists, but also contribute to increased inflammation and complications. Immunological recall effects exist as anti-seasonal coronavirus titres increase in sera of convalescent SARS patients (111) which may influence immune pathology. As mentioned above, antibody-bound virions can enter susceptible cells, such as macrophages through Fc\u03b3 receptor ligation in a process termed antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) (112) . In other viral infections (e.g. Dengue fever), ADE allows immune cell infection and reduces type I IFN dependent antiviral responses while promoting proinflammatory IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1 expression (113, 114) . Furthermore, massive recall antibody production in individuals with a history of exposure to seasonal coronaviruses but waning titres, such as the elderly, can result in immune complex deposition and promote inflammation and damage, including immune complex vasculitis (110) . mortality (115) . However, heterologous immune responses to unrelated antigens may also contrite to inflammation-related complications. Frequently, adults exhibit memory T cells that are specific to antigens they were never exposed to, and cross-reactive memory T cells can narrow the T cell response by favoring \"high affinity\" clones. Indeed, limited memory T cell repertoires are a feature of immune senescence and associated with disease progression and T cell mediated damage in other viral infections, such as virus hepatitis and infective mononucleosis (116) .",

Variable ACE2 expression patterns affect disease susceptibility between tissues (e.g. respiratory epithelia vs immune cells), but potentially also between individuals (men vs women, children vs adults) thereby determining disease progression and outcomes. Recently, it has been suggested that ACE2 expression is highest in children and young women, that its expression decreases with age, and is lowest in individuals with chronic disease, including diabetes and hypertension, inversely correlating with risk for severe disease and unfavorable outcomes (118) . While ACE2 facilitates viral entry into cells, it also plays a role in controlling infection and inflammation. ACE2 is part of the ACE2/angiotensin-(1-7)/MAS system as it counteracts the pro-inflammatory effects of the angiotensin-2. It catalyzes angiotensin-2 processing into angiotensin-1-7, which counteracts vasoconstriction, modulates leukocyte migration, cytokine expression, and fibrogenic pathways (119) . Thus, ACE2 contributes to limiting tissue inflammation while favoring repair mechanisms. Furthermore, \"high\" ACE2 expression may be of benefit as SARS-CoV2 virus particles may compete with angiotensin-2 for cell surface binding sites and cellular uptake. Thus, relatively increased ACE2 expression may explain why children and young adults, especially young women, are relatively protected from COVID19 and associated complications.",

Early and sufficient control of virus replication and pathogen clearance may be altered in individuals at risk, such as the elderly, patients with diabetes or metabolic syndrome, etc. (74, 75) . Healthy children and young people, on the other hand, may effectively control viral load at early stages of infection and less frequently develop severe disease and life-threatening complications. Lastly, early antibody production may result in integration of viable virus into immune cells and increased viral replication, resulting in immune complex mediated pathology, which may contribute to pathology in young patients with no obvious risk factors (100).",

Further, due to the minimal severity of the SARS (774 deaths globally) and MERS (866 deaths globally) epidemics, few studies to generate a vaccine or therapeutic for other closely related coronaviruses have been undertaken, which could have efficacy for COVID-19 disease. Clinical trials testing treatments for COVID-19 are being undertaken, results from large randomized studies though remain outstanding at this stage.

Its phosphate and sulphate derivatives are administered as antimalarials, and hydroxychloroquine is widely used as immunomodulatory agent in systemic lupus erythematosus. In addition, chloroquine has antiviral activity against Influenza, Chikungunya virus, seasonal CoVs, and SARS (120) (121) (122) (123) . As for these viruses, cell entry and replication of SARS-CoV2 depends on pH-dependent internalization by endocytosis and lysosomal fusion (Figure 2 ). Itself being a weak base, hydroxychloroquine follows the cellular pH gradient and accumulates in the acid environment of endolysosomes and other acidic cell organelles, thereby alkalinizing endosomes. In addition, hydroxychloroquine interferes with the terminal glycosylation of ACE2, interfering with virus binding (123) . Antiviral activity of chloroquine derivatives against SARS-CoV2 was identified in vitro early on (124) . Based on this, the drug was rapidly introduced into clinical use, and preliminary reports suggested improved viral clearance and clinical outcomes in COVID-19 patients receiving a 10-days course of Hydroxychloroquine (125) . A small French pilot study, randomizing 36 patients with COVID-19 suggested accelerated viral clearance in patients treated with a combination of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin (126) . However, others have challenged results and found no benefit in either disease outcome or viral clearance (127) . Disappointingly, the largest (also retrospective) study to date assessing Hydroxychloroquine on its own or in combination with azithromycin found no benefit, but indeed an increased mortality risk among patients receiving hydroxychloroquine (128) . A study exploring chloroquine diphosphate in two dosing regimens was forced to terminate early for concerns over increased mortality in the high dose arm. The authors conclude that treatment with high dose chloroquine for 10 days is not sufficiently safe and should no longer be used in severe SARS-CoV2 patients (129) .",

However, unselective ACE blockade with currently available agents may be problematic as it could alter angiotensin-1 through -7, which have anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic properties (159) . Indeed, depletion of ACE2 by SARS-CoV2 may potentially contribute to increased disease activity in critically ill COVID-19 patients. In animal studies, ACE2 protects from ARDS (160) (161) (162) , while angiotensin II contributes to pulmonary pathology, including edema and fibrosis (163) . Thus, accumulation of angiotensin II in the absence of ACE2 may aggravate disease and organ damage. Consequently, ACE2 induction has recently been suggested for COVID-19 treatment (85, 159, 164, 165) . However, effects of ACE2 may vary between tissues and environments. Intestinal epithelia produce much higher levels of ACE2 than bronchial epithelia which is notable as not all patients develop gastrointestinal symptoms and when they do, symptoms tend to be mild, and some patients remain SARS-CoV2 positive in stool samples long after respiratory specimen became negative (78, (166) (167) (168) . Based on these observations, one could suggest that high-level ACE2 expression such as that seen in the intestine and in contrast to the respiratory tract, or in children and young people as compared to individuals at risk (the elderly, especially when obese or chronically ill), may protect from inflammation and tissue damage. However, additional factors, such as the immunological micro-environment or regionally variable microbiomes may significantly affect virus uptake, replication and/or clearance. Thus, the exact role(s) of ACE2 in the context of COVID-19 remains to be unveiled and may be complex.",

Similarly, rigorously evaluated data for its use in coronaviral infections is lacking -not only for its use in SARS-CoV2 (181), and a feasibility study exploring its use in MERS found that in many survivors, antibody titres were not high enough, thus further limiting the donor pool (182) .

Standard treatment in these conditions include high-dose corticosteroids (dexamethasone), the calcineurin inhibitor cyclosporine A, chemotherapy with etoposide, and ultimately stem cell transplantation (187) . While the underlying molecular causes of familial HLH are different to COVID-19 associated cytokine storm syndrome, clinical (fevers, organomegaly in some patients) and laboratory features (cytopenias, massively elevated inflammatory parameters including CRP, ESR and ferritin, hypalbuminemia, hyperfibrinogenaemia, etc.) and consequences (tissue and organ damage, death) overlap. Furthermore, based on observations in the H1N1 influenza pandemic in 2009, a significant proportion of individuals developing disease-associated secondary cytokine storm syndrome may have mutations in one or more genes associated with familial HLH (in H1N1 36% of fatalities were associated with mutations in genes associated with the perforin pathway (188) .Thus, clinical management of COVID-19 associated cytokine storm syndrome may, to some extent, be informed by what we know from familial HLH. However, treatment of COVID-19 associated cytokine storm should be more targeted and not include cytotoxic drugs and/or stem cell transplantation, as it is secondary to an infection, which will hopefully be cleared.",

First preliminary data from SARS and COVID-19 suggest that high-dose steroids did not have beneficial effects on lung injury (190, 191) . Instead, highdose corticosteroids are associated with complications in other forms of ARDS, including avascular osteonecrosis (192) . Short courses of low-or medium-dose corticosteroids, however, have been suggested to be of benefit in a Chinese cohort of critically ill COVID-19 patients (193) . Taken together, the limited data on the efficacy and safety of corticosteroids in ARDS are anecdotal and not conclusive; controlled trials do not exist. As their use is associated with widely variable effects on pathogen clearance, and evidence for their efficacy is lacking, high-dose corticosteroids cannot be generally recommended for the treatment of COVID-19 (194) , and the use of low dose regimens must be trialed in formal and controlled studies. (195) . As mentioned above, immune complexes containing viable virus may mediate infection, activate Fc\u03b3 receptors, and/or be deposited in tissues and organs, lastly resulting in pro-inflammatory responses (196) . Of note, ARDS and cytokine storm in SARS coincided with serum conversion in a majority of patients supporting these arguments. Furthermore, patients who ultimately died, seroconverted significantly earlier when compared to individuals who recovered from infection (40, 197) . Based on these observations, IVIG may be of benefit to some patients by inhibiting Fc\u03b3 receptors and limiting antibody-dependent enhancement (discussed above). Furthermore, aforementioned \"classical\" antiinflammatory effects may limit systemic inflammation, and anti-pathogen properties may be supportive in cases with bacterial superinfection or in patients who previously cleared SARS-CoV2 and developed specific antibodies (186, 198) .",

            "text": "The recombinant IL-1 receptor antagonist anakinra was originally developed to control cytokine storm and associated tissue damage in sepsis patients (203) . Subsequently, anakinra has successfully been used in patients with cytokine storm syndrome secondary to autoimmune/inflammatory (204, 205) infectious or malignant disease (206) . Anakinra may have significant potential at controlling hyper-inflammation in severe COVID-19 disease, considering the absence of severe side-effects in aforementioned sepsis trials (203) , and reduced frequency of neutropenia and hepatotoxicity when compared to tocilizumab. Currently, anakinra is being trialled in a randomised placebo-controlled study in children and adults with COVID-19 associated cytokine storm syndrome in China (NCT02780583) (91) . (JAK) with small molecules is a relatively new concept used in systemic autoimmune/inflammatory conditions. JAKs are involved in cytokine receptor signaling, including (but not limited to) the IL-6 receptor, as well as type 1 and type 2 IFN receptors (91, 207) . They mediate the phosphorylation of STAT family transcription factors which are, in turn, involved in pro-inflammatory cytokine expression. Thus, JAK inhibitors efficiently limit cytokine expression, and may aid in controlling cytokine storms (91) . However, JAKs are also centrally involved in controlling the expression of T1IFN, which plays a key role in limiting virus replication and initiating pathogen clearance (208) . At least in the initial stages of COVID-19 disease, when virus replication and infection may be limited to the epithelium, SARS-CoV2 likely limits T1IFN expression (see above). Therefore, additional J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f inhibition of JAK through small molecules may be counterproductive as they further limit pathogen containment and clearance, and may cause unforeseeable complications. Thus, JAK inhibition may not be the most suitable \"target-directed\" treatment option in COVID-19 associated cytokine storm syndrome and/or ARDS. To our knowledge, at least two clinical trials are ongoing to test efficacy and safety of JAK inhibitors in severe COVID-19 (ChiCTR2000030170, ChiCTR2000029580).",

Of note, immune modulation or suppression was not identified as a risk factor for poor prognosis in China or Italy (186, 210) . While this could generally be considered \"good news\", immune suppression and associated altered immune function may predispose patients to infection and potentially prolong virus spreading.

            "text": "J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f As immunity does not exist and a significant proportion of humans develop severe disease, the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV2 is a threat to millions globally. SARS-CoV2 has the capacity to escape innate immune responses, which allows the pathogen to produce large copy numbers in primarily infected tissues, usually airway epithelia. Through the infection of innate immune cells and/or the recruitment of uninfected cells from the circulation to the primary site of infection, massive immune reactions induce hyperinflammation that can result in a cytokine storm and life-threatening complications. We are only beginning to understand host factors, such as differential expression of cell surface proteins that may determine infection risk, disease presentation and outcomes. Unveiling tissue and stage specific factors contributing to pathology will result in new, effective and disease stage specific therapeutic approaches that control virus replication while limiting inflammatory damage until vaccinations become available. While RNA viruses usually activate TLR3 and/or 7 in endosomes (b) and cytosolic RNA sensors RIG-I and MDA-5 (c), SARS-COV2 effectively suppresses the activation of TNF receptor-associated factors (TRAF) 3 and 6, thereby limiting activation of the transcription factors NF\u03baB and IRF3 and 7, thereby suppressing early pro-inflammatory responses through type I interferons (IFN) and pro-inflammatory effector cytokines IL-1, IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1 (red symbols). Furthermore, novel CoVs inhibit the activation of STAT transcription factors (d) in response to type I IFN receptor activation, which further limits antiviral response mechanisms. Altogether, this prohibits virus containment through activation of anti-viral programs and the recruitment of immune cells. B) Tissue monocytes/macrophages express ACE2 to a significantly lower extent, making infection through this route less likely (a). However, immune complexes consisting of ineffective antibodies against e.g. seasonal CoVs and virus particles may be taken up by macrophages through Fc\u03b3 receptors resulting in their infection (b). In a process referred to as antibody directed enhancement (ADE), virions inhibit type I IFN signaling in infected macrophages while allowing pro-inflammatory IL-1, IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1 expression, which may contribute to hyperinflammation and cytokine storm syndrome (c,d). Inhibited type 1 IFN signaling suppresses anti-viral programs, while increased IL-1, IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1 expression auto-amplifies itself through positive feedback loops (f).",

Uninfected monocytes/macrophages from the blood stream invade the lungs where they detect virus particles and/or cytoplasmic and nuclear components. Within immune complexes, these particles are taken up into the cell (a) where they are presented to TLRs, activating NF\u03baB and/or IRF dependent pro-inflammatory pathways (b,c). As a result, uninfected monocytes/macrophages produce significant amounts of pro-inflammatory cytokines (d,e) which recruit additional innate and adaptive immune cells and cause additional tissue damage. While no approved and evidencebased treatments are available for COVID-19, a number of treatments promise potential. Virus particles may be caught and inactivated using antibodies from convalescent patients. Recombinant soluble ACE2 protein may bind SARS-CoV2 and/or mediate anti-inflammatory effects to prevent pulmonary damage and hyper-inflammation. (Hydroxy-)chloroquine, potentially in combination with azithromycin), can change the pH of endosomes and reduce virus entry and replication. Furthermore, both medications have immune-modulating effects that may control pro-inflammatory cytokine expression. Anti-viral treatment with protease inhibitors (lopinavir, ritonavir, etc.) and/or nucleoside analogues (remdesivir, etc.) can limit virus replication. As SARS-CoV2 suppresses antiviral cytokine production, virus clearance may also be supported by the substitution of type 1 interferons, which activate their cytokine receptor (IFNAR) and induce anti-viral cellular programs. Hyperinflammation and resulting tissue damage may be prevented through immune modulation. Blocking IL-1 signaling (e.g. through recombinant IL-1 receptor antagonist anakinra) or IL-6 signaling (e.g. through IL-6 receptor antibody tocilizumab) may limit further immune activation, tissue damage and cytokine storms. Additional, less specific effects may be mediated through corticosteroids, immunoglobulins, hydroxychloroquine and/or azithromycin. ",
