It bears the potential to create devastating social, economic, and political consequences in all the countries it touches. At the same time, it represents a great challenge for the entire scientific community. Indeed, the latter is currently making extraordinary efforts to increase knowledge on the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV 2), and so helps in containing the pandemic and hopefully in eradicating it. The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) has recently been put on the forefront as the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) 2 is targeted by SARS-CoV 2. In parallel, obesity appears as the main risk factor for severe forms of COVID-19. The RAAS and obesity are closely related, leading to the aggravation of the disease. Here, we focus on the endogenous imbalance of RAAS in obesity.",

Then, it has become clear that type 2 diabetes (DT2) also withstands as a risk factor. Scientist further speculated that ACE inhibitors and angiotensin II type 1 receptor (ATR1) antagonists, which are widely used in DT2 patients, could upregulate ACE 2 and consequently might account for the high prevalence of hypertension and diabetes among patients with severe disease course. However, this causative effect has not been confirmed so far [2, 3].",

A classic view opposes the pro-inflammatory and hypertensive angiotensin (ANG) II and ATR1 axis to the anti-inflammatory and vasodilator angiotensin 1\u20137 (ANG 1\u20137) and MAS receptor axis. ANG 1\u20137 may be synthesized using three different pathways including the hydrolysis of angiotensin 2 (ANG 2) through ACE 2. The latter also functions as a receptor for the SARS-CoV 2. The SARS-CoV-2 spike protein binds to ACE 2 on the host cell membrane and enters the pneumocytes, possibly leading to a loss of function of ACE 2. Thus, the interaction with the SARS-CoV-2 would result in a reduced ACE 2 enzymatic activity and consequently in an imbalance favoring the ANG II and AT1R axis and the lung injury response to the viral infection [3].",

A high receptor-ligand affinity has been observed in humans and macaque rhesus that decreases in the Syrian hamster, rat, and mouse to become very low in the bat [7]. Indeed, this is probably why the latter does not develop a clinically evident disease while hosting the virus. Therefore, the human polymorphisms of ACE 2 may be responsible for the increased ACE 2/spike affinity. This may account for the heterogeneity of the pandemic spread and, more importantly, for the different degrees of severity around the world and within the same countries [8].",

            "text": "Obesity is associated in humans and in experimental animals with an imbalance in the RAAS system resulting in an overexpression of the ANG II and AT1R axis at the systemic level [11] and at the level of the adipose tissue [12]. This statement is reinforced by findings in obese rats showing that without adequate exercise, the deleterious ANG II and AT1R axis predominates in spite of increased quantity of ACE 2 [13]. Actually, ACE 2 is largely expressed in adipose tissue and significantly more in visceral than peripheral subcutaneous adipose tissue [14]. Consequently, obese individuals, especially those with exceeding visceral adipose tissue, could develop an explosive systemic response of the ANG II and AT1R axis and could be able to host and stock a huge viral load, possibly contributing to development of a more severe form of the disease. As no specific symptoms or signs of adipose tissue infection develop, this is overlooked in clinical practice where clinicians focus on organ insufficiencies. Then, in the setting of COVID-19, obesity-related metabolic comorbidities should not be solely regarded as the direct responsible for the more severe disease course as suggested recently but also (or, maybe, rather) as accompanying clinical characteristics of a phenotype that could contribute, or lead, to the risk of mortality, i.e., the accumulation of visceral adipose tissue [15]. It is of paramount importance to note that weight loss, even modest, reverses the imbalance of the RAAS at the adipose tissue as well as at the systemic levels [11]. Additionally, the adipose tissue may host in obese individuals a larger viral load behaving as a reservoir and giving a higher potential for diffusing the virus and contaminating other individuals.",
