Starting in January 20, 2020, the Chinese government took a series of unprecedented measures to contain the spread of COVID-19. Because of the role of Wuhan as a central transportation hub, public transportation was suspended in and out of Wuhan and adjacent areas on January 21. Other provinces successively took precautionary actions in accordance with the Level-1 Response to Major Public Health Emergencies (Xinhua News Online, h t t p : / / w w w. x i n h u a n e t . c o m / p o l i t i c s / 2 0 2 0 -0 1 / 2 5 / c_1125502232.htm).

By 24:00 on February 11, 157 confirmed cases had been identified in Hefei, aged 44.40\u00b115.60 years, 74 female (47.1%) and 38 imported cases (24.2%). During the same period, 386 confirmed cases had been identified in Shenzhen, aged 45.15\u00b117.99 years, 202 female (52.3%) and 289 imported cases (74.9%). Hefei had a significantly lower proportion of imported cases compared with Shenzhen (P<0.001). The number of daily newly confirmed cases in Hefei exhibited a modest fluctuation. In contrast, in Shenzhen, the increase in the number of cases was slow during the week that followed the identification of the first case, but accelerated immediately after, reaching a peak of 60 new cases on January 31. Thereafter, the number of new cases decreased quickly ( Figure S1 in Supporting Information). To understand the changes in the epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19 ( Figure 1 ), we evaluated the change in R0 over the study period in Hefei and Shenzhen based on a slope prediction algorithm. The first order functions of time and R0 were obtained using the method of least squares. As shown in Figure 1A , the daily R0 values were >3.5 in both cities before the Level-1 Response. After the launch of the Level-1 Response, the R0 values in both cities started to decline slowly (both, P for trend <0.001). By February 11, the R0 in Hefei and Shenzhen were 1.93 and 1.48, respectively. Moreover, compared with Hefei, the decline in R0 in Shenzhen was apparently faster (predicted slope of R0, Shenzhen vs. Hefei, -0.133 vs. -0.031, P=0.091). Regarding the components used in the estimation of R0 shown in Figure  1B , the average growth rate declined significantly in both cities after the initial stage of response (both, P for trend <0.001). The average incubation period of both the cities increased over time (both, P for trend <0.001, Figure 1C ). Figure 1D indicates that the average infectious period in both cities dropped after the launch of the Level-1 Response, but slowly increased after the initial stage of the response (both, P for trend <0.05).",

Therefore, during the initial stage of the response, the R0 was strongly correlated with this population inflow. However, this inflowing population was composed mainly of Anhui natives who were returning home. They tended to have extensive local social connections and attended gatherings with the local people frequently. These gatherings accelerated the local COVID-19 spread and generated secondary cases. These local cases further spread the disease, even after the travel ban of Wuhan. This would explain the prevalence of clustered cases and the diminishing of the correlation between R0 and the population inflow observed after the initial stage of the response.",

The average incubation period was the mean value of the incubation period of non-input confirmed patients with a contact history over the previous 5 days.
