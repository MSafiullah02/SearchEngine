Nearly 2 million people have been formally diagnosed worldwide with over 100,000 deaths despite massive containments efforts. The full public health impact has yet to be recognized. There have also been significant burdens placed on our healthcare system with reports of inadequate numbers of beds and ventilators. Healthcare workers have been placed under great mental and physical burden with studies citing high rates of depression, insomnia, anxiety, and distress in healthcare workers, especially those on the frontline. [1], [2], [3] This crisis has impacted the medical and surgical specialties in different ways. Internal medicine, general surgery, anesthesia, and intensivists have the opportunity to use specific training in managing critically ill COVID patients, and have had to ramp up work hours to meet demand. Surgical sub-specialists have been impacted differently, as they have been deployed to fields outside of their subspecialties and have had to limit their surgeries to only those deemed as essential. Similar to other hospitals, in our hospital system this has manifested as spine surgeons working in the ICU and medical floors under anesthesiology and hospitalist leadership, with residents and fellows acting as assistance to the medical teams. Other hospital systems have been redeploying spine surgeons in alternative roles in a similar fashion as well. [4]\n",

Although the ACGME staged system has allowed program directors to waive milestones needed to obtain a graduation certificate, a primary goal of fellowship is to obtain the sub-specialty skills needed to thrive in your chosen practice with the fellowship year being critical to this. Any disruption in that time can have a significant impact on the confidence and skill of an orthopedic surgeon as he or she starts a practice. For spine surgery, specifically, it has been shown that at least 250 cases should be performed during fellowship year.[5] Although there can be significant difference in the number of spine cases a trainee is involved in during residency (average of 83 spine procedures for orthopaedic residents as compared to 493 for neurosurgery residents) there is no discernible difference between orthopedic spine and neurosurgical spine surgeons by the end of fellowship, highlighting the importance of this final year of \u201cfinishing school\u201d for spine surgeons regardless of their residency background.[6] Furthermore, the lost time may affect some programs more than others based on the case volume at a particular institution and the ability of the fellowship program to adapt to increasing didactic learning in the face of decreased clinical demands.",

The effects of these changes have been felt throughout the entirety of healthcare and for trainees this has led to a restructuring of education and an incorporation of resource allocation. The initiation of ACGME Stage 3 has signaled a deviation from routine graduate medical education to a complete reconfiguration of healthcare delivery toward patient care.[7]\n",

This decision offered re-allocation and conservation of resources to support the communities\u2019 broader response in combating this crisis while protecting patients and health-care workers. The extemporaneous effects of this decision on patient care have yet to be fully realized, however the loss of surgical volume has had immediate effects on trainees in all surgical subspecialties.

The effects of curtailed training greatly impacts fellows\u2019 case volumes and heightens concerns for those with limited exposure during residency.[8] This may have far reaching effects with regards to a spine fellow's preparedness for entering clinical practice.",

The heightened awareness of protection of patients, healthcare workers, and auxiliary staff has forced assessment of personal protective equipment (PPE) and utilization mandates. Skin based thermometers have been used to identify potentially symptomatic patients while surgical masks have been required for those entering hospitals. Patients and those accompanying them have been required to undergo screening protocols for potential symptoms in addition to focused travel histories. The large number of international patients within our hospital network has required initiation of screening protocols including restriction of patients from known \u201chot spots.\u201d Institutionally, operating rooms have been converted into double occupancy intensive care units along with designation of inpatient floors as isolated COVID-19 units. Training modules were rapidly mobilized and utilized by attendings, fellows and residents who were being deployed to participate in medicine and intensive care teams. Additionally, all staff were trained in optimal donning and doffing of PPE, as well as ventilator and medical management of complex patients. Management of COVID-19 patients with droplet precautions as outlined by the Centers of Disease Control (CDC) was widely implemented throughout the hospital as a universal precaution.[9] As these physical transitions occurred, care team restructuring rapidly transformed typical roles of physicians and staff to focus resources toward care of COVID-19 patients. Fellows rapidly filled roles for coverage needs with orthopaedic trauma clinics and inpatient COVID care teams.",

The alarming number of COVID-19 cases within our community during February and March rapidly elevated national and international attention with subsequent designation of New York City as a COVID-19 epicenter.[10] The implications of this pandemic altered the hospital's elective single surgical subspecialty focus to incorporate the care of COVID19 patients. Outpatient community clinics were repurposed to serve as orthopaedic urgent care clinics with the most notable transition occurring at the main hospital which housed the newly created orthopaedic triage center (OTC). The institution of the OTC occurred in conjunction with surrounding local emergency departments, healthcare networks and city and state officials. Fellows, along with physician assistants, were charged with providing coverage and coordination of care for OTC patients. Fellows\u2019 clinical roles, regardless of subspecialty, transitioned to meet the needs of these orthopaedic trauma patients. The repurposing of the orthopaedic healthcare delivery model allowed urgent and emergent onsite musculoskeletal care while accommodating medical-surgical and critical care needs inundating New York's hospitals.",

These advantages have been outlined in the literature since 1990\u2019s, but adoption has been slow due to resistance to change, cost, reimbursement, and other reasons.[11], [12], [13] Social distancing during a pandemic, however, has made implementation of telemedicine a necessity for all providers. As a result, there has been rapid expansion of telemedicine for evaluating new patients with spinal pathology and patients requiring routine follow-ups. The federal government has also eased regulations regarding utilization of telemedicine to facilitate appropriate reimbursement for physician services through \u201cvirtual\u201d interaction.[14] This has prompted multiple insurers to reimburse at rates comparable to in-person consultation, motivating many providers to rapidly adopt this technology. However, It should be noted that video conferencing is an essential portion of telemedicine for reimbursement purposes as it reimburses at a higher and more consistent rate than isolated telephone encounters. State governments have also suspended restrictions on out of state providers in conducting virtual care for patients residing in their locality. These developments have allowed both attendings and fellows to provide vital spine care for patients isolated to their homes in a broad swath of our region despite being unable to physically examine them. Fellows on-call, for instance, have been able to utilize telemedicine to quickly evaluate a post-operative wound in order to avoid sending a patient to the Emergency Room, potentially avoiding a potential exposure of the patient to COVID-19. Surgeons have also been able to identify patients requiring essential surgery by visually identifying neurologic deficits during virtual examination.",

On the other hand, if there are significantly more operative cases, there is a possibility that outpatient care, teaching, and research are being compromised. Most spine surgery fellowships around the country are designed in a manner that fellows will have done around 250 cases by the last quarter of the year.

Fellows (as well as residents and attendings) have been forced to adapt to a situation that is extremely unfamiliar.[18], [19] It is only human to be frustrated over losing crucial weeks (and maybe months) of operative training.

Not only has this helped alleviate the healthcare worker shortage, but it has also resulted in new relationships with colleagues across all specialties. As such, the new lessons of dynamic teamwork, empathy, courage, and quickly learning new tasks are essential to the personal development and the molding of a physician. This pandemic has forced everyone to understand the concept of rational management of limited resources and new versatility to adapt to constant change and uncertainty. It is important to remember that the role of surgical subspecialty trainees during this COVID-19 pandemic is critical and many have played a significant role in supporting healthcare colleagues and society. At some point, this crisis will pass, but until then, it is important to remain vigilant and serve our communities with whatever skills that have been bestowed upon us. There will come a day where all clinicians will return focus to their particular subspecialty. But until then, we have been given the gift of opportunity, and it is our duty to make the most of it, and play our role in guiding our communities through this pandemic.",

Changes that were made to hospital practice structures will benefit the community and ultimately our hospital system through this COVID-19 crisis and beyond. This includes ensuring proper training for our residents and fellows and adapting to the community as this crisis dictates. The spine fellowship has been impacted, but not diminished, by this crisis and ultimately we are uniquely positioned for the future to have had the opportunity to learn from a pandemic that has been unseen for the last 100 years.
