One source of strength was his ability to win votes, as demonstrated by twice being elected mayor of Greater London. At a time when the Conservatives were trailing in the opinion polls his campaigning skills made him appear a potential election winner when pitted against Jeremy Corbyn and Nigel Farage. In the three years after Johnson\u2019s shambolic first attempt to become prime minister, his opposition to May\u2019s negotiations had established him as a committed adherent of Brexit.",

His chief opponent, Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt, a late convert to Brexit, declared, \u2018If we don\u2019t do what the people tell us to do, we\u2019re not a democracy\u2019 (Sylvester 2019).",

Internal party divisions exacerbated the effect of being a minority government. The government\u2019s standing with public opinion was even worse. At the start of January 2019, the YouGov poll gave the Conservatives 41% support, six points more than Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s Labour party. After multiple defeats in the House of Commons and the European Parliament election, when Theresa May left office YouGov showed the Conservatives with only 19%, tied for third with Labour and behind the Liberal Democrats and the newly formed Brexit Party.

Johnson did so by sending Brussels the Act of Parliament requesting delay on a plain sheet of paper without his signature, and simultaneously sending a signed letter stating why he thought delay undesirable.

The election bill was fast-tracked through the Commons and approved on 30 October, the day before Johnson was due to die in a metaphorical ditch, in his own words, because of failing to deliver Brexit by then.

It was designed not only to appeal to those who had voted to leave the EU three years earlier but also to others who accepted the authority of a referendum and were tired of endless indecision in Westminster.

Getting Brexit done appealed to a significant bloc of voters who saw a hung Parliament as \u2018worrying, depressing or despairing\u2019.

If Boris Johnson had won a plurality rather than a majority of seats he would have been challenged to form a cross-party alliance to deliver Brexit since every other party had rejected his Brexit deal. Nor were other parties inclined to back a minority Labour government under Jeremy Corbyn to resolve the Brexit deadlock. Without a government in place Britain was scheduled to leave the EU without a deal on 31 January 2020.",
