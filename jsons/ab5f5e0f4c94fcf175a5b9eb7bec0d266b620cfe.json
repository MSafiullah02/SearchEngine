The dorsal portion of the left sixth arch persists as the ductus arteriosus joining the pulmonary artery and aorta, while the ventral left sixth aortic arch becomes the proximal portion of the left main pulmonary artery ( Fig. 28.1 ). Recent evidence, however, suggests that the pulmonary arteries may initially arise from the fourth and later merge with the sixth aortic arch. 6 The right and left pulmonary arteries, by day 50, have joined the vascular plexus that surrounds and infiltrates the lung buds. Small vessels within the lung buds are formed in situ by the process of vasculogenesis. 8 The pulmonary trunk is formed as the aorticopulmonary septum divides the truncus arteriosus into two major channels-the aorta and the pulmonary artery ( Fig. 28.1 ).6 After birth, the ductus arteriosus closes to become the ligamentum arteriosum.",

The vein rapidly branches into the right and left pulmonary veins, each of which further divides, producing a total of four pulmonary veins. The pulmonary veins connect with the venous plexus around the esophagus and developing lung buds. As the left atrium enlarges, it absorbs, by a process of intussusception, the main and then the right and left branches to just beyond the entry of their main tributaries. In this manner, four separate venous openings are found in the dorsal wall of the left atrium. Even in the adult, small connections persist between the pulmonary and esophageal veins near the lung hilum. During fetal life, the pulmonary veins carry little blood and are largely free of muscle. A continuous smooth muscle coat is only present near term.9",

Definitive bronchial arteries, which nourish the bronchi, pleura, and walls of vessels, arise from the aorta in the 9th to 12th week of gestation. 10 In the normal fetus, patent precapillary anastomoses between bronchial and pulmonary circulations are infrequently observed. There is, however, free communications between the two circulations at the capillary level, and both systems drain into the pulmonary veins. 7 ,11 Congenital Vascular Malformations Congenital malformations of the pulmonary vasculature are rare lesions, usually seen in children, and often associated with congenital cardiac anomalies. Two of the more notable conditions in which anomalous lung vessels play a role are the scimitar syndrome (anomalous pulmonary venous return) and intralobar sequestration (aberrant aortic-derived blood supply). The scimitar syndrome is discussed in Chapter 6, and intralobar sequestration is considered in Chapter 7. Other anomalies of the pulmonary vasculature that can contribute to pulmonary hypertension include persistent truncus arteriosus, aorticopulmonary septal defect, and assorted anomalies of pulmonary veins. These exceedingly rare malformations are discussed in the textbook by Wagenvoort and Wagenvoort. 12 Some selected important anomalies of pulmonary vessels are discussed in detail below.",

            "text": "Unilateral absence of a main pulmonary artery is an infrequent congenital anomaly that may present as an isolated lesion or in association with other cardiac or vascular anomalies (combined anomaly) in children or (more frequently) adults. Absence of the left pulmonary artery has been particularly associated with tetralogy of Fallot (e.g., pulmonary stenosis, ventricular septal defect, overriding dextroposed aorta, and right ventricular hypertrophy), while an absent right pulmonary artery more frequently occurs with patent ductus arteriosus.1 3 . 14 The blood supply to the affected lung may derive directly from the aorta as in some cases of absent right pulmonary artery, or from bronchial arteries or an aortic arch vessel in most cases of absent left pulmonary artery and other instances of absent right pulmonary artery. Collateral supply from the coronary arteries has also been described. 15 Patients exhibit respiratory complaints of recurrent pneumonia or, less frequently, hemoptysis. Cardiovascular symptoms depend on whether the lesion is an isolated or a combined anomaly. Patients with an isolated absence of the pulmonary artery may have no cardiovascular symptoms. Approximately 85% of combined anomalies progress to pulmonary hypertension. The most important finding on the plane chest x-ray is ipsilateral pulmonary hypovascularity. Unilateral thrombotic or embolic occlusion of a pulmonary artery is the most difficult lesion to distinguish angiographically from unilateral absence of the pulmonary artery ( Fig. 28. 2) (see also Fig. 28.32) . 16 Within the ipsilateral lung, intrapulmonary arteries may be either normal or exhibit features of pulmonary hypertension, such as medial hypertrophy, intimal fibrosis, or trophic muscular artery is in the position of a normal intraparenchymal pulmonary artery. ( Pleural collateral vessels may be prominent. 14.17.18 The lung on the affected slide is often hypoplastic. 17 ,19 Congenital Pulmonary Stenosis/Atresia and Tetralogy of Fallot: Vascular Remodeling in Low-Flow States Diminution of the pulmonary arterial pulse pressures and blood flow occurs in a variety of congenital cardiac malformations that impede right ventricular outflow, especially pulmonary artery stenosis, pulmonic valve stenosis or atresia, and tetralogy of Fallot. In tetralogy of Fallot, the pulmonary trunk is narrower than the aorta, while the main pulmonary arteries may be normal or hypoplastic. Stenosis of the distal pulmonary trunk and bilateral main pulmonary arteries may be diffuse or localized ( Fig.  28. 3).20 Saccular dilatation may occur distal to strictures. Intraparenchymal pulmonary arteries have a normal anatomic distribution. 8 The most constant finding in the elastic pulmonary arteries of any of these disorders is thinning of the media, often to a marked degree (Fig. 28.4) . 21 In tetralogy of Fallot mural thinning may extend to the level of muscular arteries, which, along with capillaries and pulmonary veins, may be markedly dilated. When mural thinning is extreme, medial muscle may be focally absent. Similar changes have also been described in pulmonic atresia. 22 Medial atrophy and widened vascular lumina tend to be more pronounced in isolated pulmonic stenosis than in tetralogy of Fallot. 21 Other associated findings include intimal fibrosis and thrombotic lesions (including web strictures in lobar, segmental, and/or peripheral branches. (From Goor DA, Lillehei Cw. Congenital malformations of the heart. New York: Grune & Stratton, 1975, with permission from Elsevier. Copyright \u00a9 1975.) lesions), which are more frequently seen in tetralogy of Fallot than in isolated pulmonic stenosis. 21 Rich 23 in 1948 had recognized the increased tendency toward pulmonary arterial and venous thrombosis in tetralogy of Fallot and had ascribed these changes to the influence of polycythemia and sluggish flow. This concept was later supported by Heath et a1. 24 In commemoration, recanalized In cases of pulmonic atresia with tetralogy of Fallot, the lungs are sustained by systemic blood flow. The systemic collateral supply to the lung (not including the ductus arteriosus) may be one of three types: Type I, seen in most instances of tetralogy of Fallot, consists of hypertrophied bronchial arteries that anastomose with intrapulmonary arteries. Type II anastomoses, most common in pulmonary atresia, represent aortic vessels that anastomose to the junction of interlobar and intralobar pulmonary arteries near the hilum. Type III anastomoses originate from aortic branch vessels to supply the central pulmonary artery.8.20.25 Pulmonary hypertensive changes infrequently occur in uncorrected tetralogy as a result of direct systemic arterial supply. The repair of tetralogy of Fallot involves surgical construction of a systemic-pUlmonary shunt. In cases of large shunts, pulmonary hypertensive changes, including plexiform lesions and necrotizing arteritis, may result from the systemic flow. Complete correction of tetralogy of Fallot rarely results in postsurgical pulmonary hypertension. 20 . 26",

Lesions of the pulmonary arteries, arterioles, capillaries, and veins, while histologically distinct, may all result in an elevation of pulmonary pressure, and present with similar symptoms such as dyspnea with exertion, fatigue, syncope, and lower extremity edema. While many cases of pulmonary vascular disease are diagnosed by clinical setting, radiologic findings, and hemodynamic measurements, lung biopsy is undertaken in patients for whom the diagnosis remains elusive. 1 The evaluation of lung biopsies for vascular disease requires careful consideration of subtle, and often overlooked, changes within the pulmonary vasculature.",

The intimal thickness is measured as a percentage of the internal vascular diameter, since this gives an indication of the degree of luminal obstruction. To minimize errors in sampling, 25 to 50 arteries are randomly selected for measurement. To accurately measure a vessel, cross sections should be circular or nearly circular.",

Undoubtedly, as additional advances are made in understanding the pathogenesis and etiologies of the various forms of pulmonary hypertension, the nomenclature will undergo further changes. Both terms will be used here, as much of the literature is replete with the term primary pulmonary hypertension.

Symptoms of pulmonary hypertension are related to right ventricular failure, or cor pulmonale, and include dyspnea, fatigue, syncope, lower extremity edema, and atypical chest pain. Clinical findings in cor pulmonale include right ventricular hypertrophy, manifested as a left parasternal or subxiphoid heave, split second heart sound, distended neck veins, peripheral edema, and pulsatile liver. Pleural effusions and ascites are uncommon. While death secondary to slowly progressive cor pulmonale is common in patients with severe pulmonary hypertension, some patients experience sudden death. Mechanisms of sudden death in these patients include arrhythmias, pulmonary hemorrhage, pulmonary embolism, and right ventricular ischemia. 46 The definition of cor pulmonale is problematic and varies within the medical literature from simple pulmonary hypertension to florid right heart failure due to underlying lung disease. 47 The morphologic definition of cor pulmonale espoused by the WHO expert committee is that of \"hypertrophy of the right ventricle resulting from diseases affecting the function and/or structure of the lungs, except when these pulmonary alterations are the result of diseases that primarily affect the left side of the heart, as in congenital heart disease.,,47,48 As reviewed in Chapter 1, the morphologic standard for determining right ventricular hypertrophy is to separately measure and compare ventricular weights. 49",

Human herpes virus-8 (the causative agent in Kaposi sarcoma) has been reported to occur in the lungs of at least 62 % of patients with primary pulmonary hypertension. 55 The virus leads to endothelial injury via the lytic phase of viral replication.

The pathogenesis of pulmonary hypertension in the setting of collagen vascular disease is not well established. Inflammation is believed to play a pivotal role in the development of pulmonary hypertension. Clustering of T cells and macrophages around vessels has been reported and may be linked to vascular remodeling. 72 The liberation of cytokines such as VEGF and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) in an inflammatory response may drive endothelial proliferation in these patients. 73 ,74 In patients with collagen vascular disease-associated hypercoagulable states, such as lupus anticoagulant or antiphospholipid antibodies, in situ thrombosis may play a role in the development of arteriopathy and pulmonary hypertension (see Chapter 20) . 75, 76 Portal Hypertension Portal hypertension, most commonly in the setting of liver disease, can be associated with pulmonary hypertension.

The mean CD4 count for those with HIV and pulmonary hypertension is 300/mm 3 , with a range of 0 to 900/mm3, and less than one third of these patients meet the clinical definition of AIDS. 83 . 84 The development of pulmonary hypertension in HIVpositive patients with no other risk factors initially led researchers to suspect a direct mechanism via viral infection of endothelial cells. However, HIV viral sequences have not been recovered from endothelial cells of affected patients, nor have viral particles been identified by electron microscopy.85 Therefore, the current models of HIVassociated pulmonary hypertension have focused on the role of cytokines in the mediation of HIV's effect. Platelet-derived growth factor may, at least in part, mediate some of the endothelial proliferation in response to HIV infection.s6 In addition, ET-l, a potent vasoconstrictor and mitogen produced by macrophages, appears to be increased by the HIV gp120 protein. 87 Furthermore, there does appear to be correlation between ET-l immuno staining and the overall pulmonary vascular resistance. 88 While virally mediated cytokines may facilitate the development of pulmonary hypertension, the majority of HIV-positive patients do not have elevated pressures. This would suggest, therefore, that there are other host factors involved in the development of disease. Of particular interest is the association of HIV-associated pulmonary hypertension with specific human leukocyte antigen (HLA) DR alleles. 89 Drugs",

Half of the affected patients were alive in a 10-year follow up, with most dying of right-sided heart failure. 91 ,98 In a later analysis, it appears that aminorex is more highly correlated with the development of pulmonary hypertension than is dexfenfiuramine, and was responsible for a fivefold increase in the number of pulmonary hypertension cases, as compared with the number expected for the same time period. 99 Toxic Oil Syndrome Toxic oil syndrome was described in Spain in 1981 following the illegal sale of rapeseed oil containing aniline.

Groshong et a1. ingestion of toxic rapeseed oi1. lOO Pulmonary hypertension was seen in up to 20% of patients following ingestion, although many cases appeared to spontaneously resolve. 101 However, some cases progressed, and were clinically and pathologically analogous to the idiopathic form of the disease, with right ventricular failure seen as early as 2 months following ingestion of the tainted oil. 102 Although the mechanism of the development of pulmonary hypertension in these patients is not known, it is suspected to involve direct endothelial toxicity by aniline. 101 Amphetamines, Methamphetamines, and Cocaine Stimulants such as amphetamine, methamphetamine, and cocaine have been associated with the development of pulmonary hypertension. 103 .104 While these drugs do have structural similarity to fenfiuramine and aminorex, it has been proposed that it is contaminants in the preparation of these substances, rather than the drug itself, that causes pulmonary hypertension. 104 Studies of patients with pulmonary hypertension associated with use of these drugs have often found foreign-body granulomas and microembolization in pulmonary arteries. 105 Drug additives believed to play a role, whether inhaled, smoked, or injected, include talc, corn starch, ascorbic acid, boric acid, plaster of Paris, phencyclidine, heroin, lidocaine, and phenytoin.

While many cases of pulmonary arterial hypertension are diagnosed clinically without lung biopsy, histopathologic evaluation can playa critical role in the diagnosis of patients with atypical clinical presentations. A common change in pulmonary arterial hypertension is medial hypertrophy of arterial walls (Fig. 28.12 ). In children, muscularization of arterioles may be the only histologic finding in pulmonary hypertension. While this appears to be rarely the case in adults, it has been described in chronic hypoxia. 121 Normal medial thickness in adults is 3% to 7% of the external vascular diameter. Mild hypertrophy ranges from 7% to 9%, moderate hypertrophy has a thickness of 10% to 14%, and severe disease typically has a thickness in excess of 15 % . 122 There is often good correlation with the thickness of the medial smooth muscle and the measured pulmonary artery pressure. In contrast, intimal hyperplasia, while a common finding in pulmonary hypertension, has poor correlation with the severity of disease. Intimal hyperplasia is seen in two distinctive forms. Cellular intimal hyperplasia, a relatively nonspecific finding, is loose and lacking in collagen deposition ( Fig. 28.13 ). Concentric laminar intimal hyperplasia, on the other hand, has dense deposition of collagen and elastin, and is a finding rarely seen except in primary pulmonary hypertension or other conditions, as described above, in which plexiform lesions develop ( Fig. 28 .14). Concentric intimal fibrosis is often present upstream to a plexiform lesion, as shown by three-dimensional vascular reconstruction ( Fig. 28.15 ).123 Occasionally, dilation creates vessels with large lumina and very thin walls that are reminiscent of pulmonary veins, so-called dilatation lesions ( Fig. 28.16 ).",

Oxygen is used to treat patients with dyspnea and prevent further vasoconstriction from hypoxia. Patients have also been shown to derive benefit from long-term anticoagulation with warfarin. 125 While oral vasodilators, such as calcium channel blockers, can provide long-term benefit, only 20% of patients with primary pulmonary hypertension respond to calcium channel blockers. 126 Perhaps the most important advance in the treatment of IPAH has been the use of the prostacyclins, such as epoprostenol. Prostacyclins are potent, short-acting vasodilators and inhibitors of platelet aggregation that have improved exercise tolerance, quality of life, and longterm survival in patients with severe pulmonary arterial hypertension. 127 Unfortunately, the 6-minute half-life of the drug necessitates a complex delivery system capable of continuous intravenous administration.

            "text": "Pulmonary artery aneurysm (PAA) is an exceedingly rare lesion. A comprehensive autopsy study by Deterling and Clagett 132 documented only eight cases out of 109,571 \u00ab0.01 %) autopsies. The classification and etiologies of pulmonary artery aneurysm are summarized in Table 28 .5.133 A basic division of PAA lies between aneurysms with and those without arteriovenous communication.133 S.D. Groshong et al. Etiology Infection (mycotic aneurysm) is an important cause of proximal PAA and some cases of arteriovenous aneurysms. 133 -135 Historically syphilis and tuberculosis were the most frequent infectious causes, but the pathogenesis differs greatly between the two entities. Syphilitic aneurysms are the result of chronic inflammation of the vasa vas ora of proximal pulmonary arteries, while tuberculous (Rasmussen) aneurysms are the effect of inflammation and necrosis of more distal arteries traversing, or adjacent to, cavitary lesions in chronic progressive tuberculosis. A variety of other bacteria or fungi, notably Staphylococcus aureus and streptococci, may give rise to mycotic aneurysms.133.1 34 Infectious agents also interact with congenital or acquired risk factors to contribute to the development of aneurysms. 13 4-137 Intravenous drug users who develop right-sided valvular endocarditis are a selective population at risk for mycotic PAA. 138 Other predisposing factors contributing to nonarteriovenous PAA include congenital heart disease, pulmonary hypertension, and vasculitis. 139. 140 Congenital cardiac anomalies accounted for 56% of central PAA in two autopsy series.132,l41 The two most frequent anomalies are patent ductus arteriosus and atrial septal defect.l33. 142.143 The mechanism of aneurysm formation may act through myxoid degeneration of the elastic arterial wall. D3. 144.145 This degenerative condition has been well described in aortic aneurysm and is frequently seen in elastic pulmonary arteries in patients with pulmonary hypertension (Fig. 28.9 ) (see above). Marfan syndrome, a systemic congenital disorder of connective tissue, is associated with medial myxoid degeneration, not only of the aorta, but also of pulmonary arteries, and occasionally is associated with PAA. 133 The presence of fever and hemoptysis in these patients has suggested an infectious etiology, which has never been proven. 133 It has also been theorized that Hughes-Stovin syndrome is a variant of Behc;et disease. 152 ,153 Trauma is another important cause of acquired PAA. Traumatic injury may be extrinsic due to blunt impact or penetrating lacerations, or intrinsic due to endovascular injury.1s3 The latter is usually an iatrogenic complication of pulmonary artery catheters or embolotherapy using devices such as metal coils or balloons to control hemoptysis. m ,154 Intravascular coils have the potential to migrate through the vessel wall causing structural weakening and predisposing to aneurysm development (see Fig. 40 .24 in Chapter 40). Arteriovenous communicating aneurysms are mostly congenital in nature and may be isolated (60% of cases) or associated with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (Osler-Weber-Rendu disease) in 40% of casesY3 Arteriovenous aneurysms are usually peripheral and present as one or more nodular densities on chest imaging studies.",

It has been estimated that 600,000 persons each year in the United States experience PTE, resulting in approximately 300,000 hospital admissions and 50,000 deaths (10%). This likely represents a conservative estimate since the clinical diagnosis of PTE is notoriously difficult due to the nonspecificity of associated cardiorespiratory symptoms or the absence of symptoms in many cases. Furthermore, the lack of autopsy confirmation in the majority of fatal cases is a major impediment in determining the true incidence of fatal PTE. ISS Even autopsy studies, however, do not provide a clear picture of the incidence of PTE, which is highly dependent on the thoroughness with which emboli are sought postmortem, and ranges widely from 6% to 69%.155,159-161 A reasonable incidence of PTE documented at autopsy is 40% to 50%.162 Pulmonary thromboembolism is estimated to be the solitary or major contributory cause of death in 3.5% to 18.1 % of adults in acute general hospitals. 155,1 59-161.163",

In larger pulmonary arteries, hemosiderin-laden macrophages and primitive capillaries are part of an exuberant granulation tissue reaction that extends into the embolus (Fig. 28 .24C) and gradually converts it into a fibrous lesion that may be eccentric, or bridge the lumen as an intravascular web (see Fig. 28 The organization of intravascular thrombi or emboli has been divided into six overlapping histologic phases by Irniger172,174 (Table 28 .7; Fig. 28 .24). The timetable governing these phases of organization likely varies with the type and size of the involved vessel. In attempting to date the onset of a pulmonary thromboembolus, one must be cognizant that some degree of organization may have occurred at the systemic site of origin (see Chapter 31). Subsequent propagation of more recent thrombus may also occur within the pulmonary artery. In general, dating is considered to be approximate at best, and often unreliable. 172",

The mechanism of trophoblast dispersal appears to be uterine contraction, especially in the setting of eclampsia. Trophoblast emboli usually represent incidental findings that do not evoke arterial thrombosis or pulmonary hypertension. They are most readily identified within the first few days of delivery, and dissipate over time. 267 Rare instances of massive trophoblastic pulmonary embolization have been reported to be a cause of death in patients with trophoblastic proliferations such as hydatidiform mole. 268 Fatal trophoblastic embolism not associated with trophoblastic disease is rare. 269 -271 Histologically, cyto-and syncytiotrophoblast cells must be distinguished from those of metastatic choriocarcinoma and from pulmonary megakaryocytes. Compared to megakaryocytes with their large lobulated nuclei, syncytiotrophoblasts contain numerous round to oval nuclei with a coarsely granular chromatin pattern (Figs. 28.38 and 28.39). Immunohisto- chemical staining for human chorionic gonadotrophin or placental lactogen may also help to identify syncytiotrophoblasts. 271 In the case described by Delmis et al., 271 numerous trophoblastic cells obliterated the pulmonary microvasculature and were associated with interstitial pneumonitis.",

Patients with indwelling venous access devices may be at risk for illicit use of psychoactive drugs. Tablet components, especially microcrystalline cellulose and talc, are also birefringent, but can be distinguished from calcium phosphate with appropriate histochemical stains and by elemental analysis. 279 Xanthoma-like lipid deposits in the pulmonary capillaries and muscular pulmonary arteries have also been reported in a few pediatric patients on long-term intravenous hyperalimentation supplement (Fig. 28.40 ). 283 Histologically, finely vacuolated histiocytes expand the subintimal zone and constrict the vascular lumen. The lesion is reminiscent of vascular involvement in Gaucher disease, but the two disorders are readily separable by the different clinical scenarios (see Chapter 16) . Lipid-rich hyperalimentation fluid may also predispose to pulmonary vasculitis and deep-seated fungal infections due to Malassezia species (see Fig. 10 .61 in Chapter 10).284 Cholesterol emboli to the lung microvasculature are another rare form of non thrombotic pulmonary embolization, reported in association with aortocaval fistulas. 285 In a well-documented case by Sabatine et al.,285 cholesterol emboli were found in pulmonary and bronchial arteries where they produced marked intimal fibrosis and associated alveolar hemorrhage. Since an autopsy was not performed, the source of cholesterol crystals in that case was not identified. 285 ,286 Atheromatous lesions of the thoracic aorta may rarely be a source of cholesterol emboli to the bronchial arteries (Fig. 28.41 ).

A low intracapillary hydrostatic pressure and a high oncotic pressure relative to the perivascular space (i.e., interstitial space) favor retention of fluid within the capillary bed. The opposite conditions promote extravascular leakage of fluid. Fluid from the intravascular compartment exits through relatively leaky interendothelial junctions. 304 Pinocytosis across the endothelial cell plays only a minimal role in fluid transit. Within the alveolar interstitium, fluid tracks to lymphatics that originate in the vicinity of the terminal bronchioles. The capacity of the interstitium is about 500mL of fluid versus a volume of about 3000mL in the air-space compartment. 305 ,306 The lymphatics transport fluid out of the lung S.D. Groshong et al. to the ductus lymphaticus and then to the systemic veins. Fluid accumulation that exceeds lymphatic removal initially expands the interstitium in which it is retained by the relatively impermeable tight junctions of alveolar epithelial cells. Upon saturation of the interstitial compartment, alveolar flooding commences. 306 Lymphatic obstruction or reduced plasma oncotic pressure may contribute to pulmonary edema but is rarely its sole cause (Table 28 .10).",

[331] [332] [333] The disease may present at any age, but typically is seen in children and young adults. Adult cases show a male predominance (male-to-female ratio of 2: 1), while childhood cases show no sex predilection. The disease may present with an acute flu-like pneumonia, or slowly progressive exertional dyspnea and fatigue. 334 As the disease progresses, there are increasing symptoms of right-sided heart failure, including exertional syncope, chest pain, cyanosis, and hepatosplenic congestion. Since these symptoms are also typical of primary pulmonary hypertension, there can be significant diagnostic confusion in these cases. Pleural effusions are commonly seen in patients with PVOD, while they are rare among patients with primary pulmonary hypertension. Similarly, hemoptysis, an unusual symptom in primary pulmonary hypertension, may occur in patients with PVOD, but is rarely massive. 335 Radiologically PVOD may be suspected with a combination of a normal-sized left atrium, normal left-sided heart valves, a normal ejection fraction, normal-sized major pulmonary veins, yet enlarged pulmonary arteries. Kerley B lines and changes suggesting edema without shunting to the upper lobes may be seen. The wedge pressure is usually normal or low in patients with PVOD and is not elevated as is the case in congestive heart failure. Following injection of saline, the pressure curve shows immediate elevation that tapers to normal or low pressures as the collateral flow drains away the increased pressure. Extrapulmonary vein obstruction would lead to a persistently elevated pressure, as all vessels are equally involved. 336 There have been isolated reports of PVOD as a cause of sudden death in both adults and infants. 337 ,338 It appears that PVOD is a common pattern of injury from a wide variety of etiologies, Chemical and pharmaceutical exposures have been associated with the development of PVOD in a number of cases, Drugs with the highest association with PVOD include bleomycin, mitomycin, and carmustine,339 Additionally, some have suggested a greater risk in the setting of bone marrow transplantation, as opposed to cytoreductive chemotherapy,340 Other causes of PVOD include viral infection, toxins, radiation, autoimmune disease, and pregnancy.333,341 A few familial cases have also been described. 342",

Venous infarcts are characterized by ischemic necrosis of tissue at the periphery of the pulmonary lobule with preservation of the central portion of the lobule, where the best oxygenated blood is able to sustain the tissue (Fig. 28.51 ). These infarcts are distinct from the wedge-shaped arterial infarcts seen in cases of embolic disease. Veins can best be appreciated as they approach and drain into the interlobular septum. The process is characterized by intimal fibrosis within pulmonary veins traversing the interlobular septa ( Fig.  28.52A,B) . The fibrosis is variably dense, and can appear very loose and edematous. The venous lumen is narrowed or occluded, and may show localized thrombosis, or evidence of recanalization. The occlusion of veins may be partial or complete, and have variable cellularity ranging from cellular and spindle-like to overtly hyalinized, as seen in cases of old organized thrombus (Fig. 28.53 ). Over time, veins may become arterialized with additional elastic fibers and abundant smooth muscle creating distinct internal and external laminae, and may be confused with pulmonary arteries if the anatomic location is not properly identified (Fig. 28.52C ).",

Lymphatics are often markedly dilated and can give the appearance of lymphangiomatosis (Fig. 28.52D) .",

The entity was first described in a 71-year-old woman and has since been encountered in patients ranging in age from 6 to 71 years, but most occurring in the 20-to 40-year age group.347-349 It is recognized to occur in congenital, familial, and sporadic forms. Congenital PCH often occurs in association with other developmental abnormalities, and has been known to cause significant proximal occlusion of the airways.35o The familial form has an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern, and appears to be very rare with only a single documented affected family. 351 The more common spontaneous form of the disease typically presents in young patients with the onset of symptoms stereotypic for pulmonary hypertension. Often these cases are initially diagnosed as primary pulmonary hypertension or pulmonary veno-occlusive disease. The presence of hemoptysis or pleural effusion should raise suspicion for the possibility of PCH. When clinically suspected, the lesion is typically diagnosed via pulmonary angiography. Biopsy is rarely undertaken, and can result FIGURE 28 .54. Pulmonary capillary hemangiomatosis (PCH). A.

A clue to this disease is the low-power appearance of patchy \"conges-1071 in massive hemorrhage. Therefore, the histologic findings are often only seen at autopsy Pathogenesis While PCH has been considered by some to represent a low-grade vascular neoplasm, most consider the lesion to be a benign vascular proliferation in response to either an infectious agent, such as Mycoplasma pneumoniae, or inflammation due to an underlying collagen vascular disease. 347 ,352.35 3 The typical symptoms of hemoptysis and hemorrhagic pleural effusion are secondary to vascular invasion within bronchioles, air spaces, and the pleura. The mechanism of the associated pulmonary hypertension, however, has remained elusive. Current theories include vascular obliteration by capillary growth, in situ thrombosis, and hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction. 354 There has been a report of a case of PCH without pulmonary hypertension. 355 In this patient, there was significant alveolar and bronchiolar capillary proliferation, but no proliferation within vessel walls. Therefore, it seems likely that vascular compression by adjacent capillary proliferation may be the dominant mechanism of pulmonary hypertension in PCH.",

            "text": "Pulmonary hypertension and cor pulmonale have long been associated with severe spinal deformities that distort the dimensions of the thoracic cage and constrict the lungs. 381 Pulmonary function tests in patients with kyphoscoliosis are characterized by reduced lung volumes, ventilatory flow rates, and diffusing capacity. Arterial blood gases show hypercapnia and hypoxemia due to the small volume of lung that is ventilated. 382 The onset of pulmonary hypertension and cor pulmonale is a poor prognostic sign that frequently heralds death. Pulmonary hypertension tends to occur in those patients who develop hypoxemia. 381 ,383 Pathophysiology and Pathologic Features of Hypoxic Pulmonary Hypertension Hypoxia exerts its effects mainly on the small muscular pulmonary arteries and precapillary nonmuscular arterioles, but the mechanism of hypoxic vasoconstriction and vascular remodeling is complex and not completely understood. 384 Hypoxia profoundly affects the vascular endothelium to release vasoconstrictive and proliferative mediators. Chronic hypoxia promotes muscle and fibroblast proliferation as well as extension of smooth muscle FIGURE 28.56. Hypoxic vasculopathy. A. Muscularization due to chronic hypoxia in a patient with obstructive sleep apnea. The normally nonmuscularized arteriole has a well-developed musinto nonmuscularized vessels, probably by acting on pericytes and intermediate cells in the vascular wal1. 385 A loss of vessels has also been identified in experimental animals, although recent reports suggest that increased vascularity occurs through hypoxia-induced angiogenesis. 38 6-388 Other mechanisms of vascular remodeling in hypoxia may include release of mitogenic stimuli from smooth muscle cells, endothelial apoptosis, elevated levels of angiotensinconverting enzyme (ACE), inflammatory mediators (IL-8, IL-6), and reactive oxygen species. 384 Modulators such as endothelin-l, vascular endothelial growth factor, angiotension II, and nitric oxide have also been implicated in hypoxic vascular remodeling. 389 .390 The increase in mitogenic factors has been proposed to occur through the regulation/induction of various transcription factors such as hypoxia-inducible factor-l (HIF_l).384 Additionally, hypoxia contributes to pulmonary hypertension indirectly by promoting vasoconstriction and increased shear stress. 384 The pathologic features of hypoxia-induced pulmonary hypertension are similar among the various predisposing conditions. 121,359 The effects of hypoxia on the pulmonary trunk and main pulmonary arteries are well seen in dwellers of high altitude. The studies of Saldana and Arias_Stella360. 391 .392 indicate a greater medial thickness and persistence of the aortic configuration of thick, continuous elastic fibers in the central pulmonary arteries in individuals born and raised at high altitude. In general, the main histologic manifestation of chronic hypoxia in parenchymal vessels is muscularization of arterioles, with development of distinct internal and external elastic laminae, and a medial muscle coat that sometimes extends into vessels as small as 30 to 40!lm (Fig. 28.56A,B) . [393] [394] [395] Medial hypertrophy of larger muscular arteries may also be seen, but frequently muscularization of arterioles is associated with normal or minimally altered muscular arteries. l2l ,359.395,396 Autopsy data in patients with Monge disease are limited; however, one study showed hypermuscularization of small pulmonary arteries above that normally seen in dwellers at similar altitude. 360 Another general feature of hypoxic vasculopathy is longitudinally oriented smooth muscle bundles within the intima of muscular pulmonary arteries, although intimal fibrosis tends to be mild (Fig. 28.57 ).121.359,396 Pulmonary veins may also show excessive smooth muscle of a lesser degree than that seen in arteries. 397 Although the capillary network is usually described as normal, in some patients with severe sleep apnea syndrome and right ventricular hypertrophy extreme capillary proliferation and hemosiderosis may be seen FIGURE 28,57. Hypoxic arterial remodeling in a patient with severe kyphoscoliosis. Note concentric intimal thickening with longitudinally oriented muscle bundles. (Fig. 28.56C ).394The degree of capillary proliferation may simulate that seen in pulmonary capillary hemangiomatosis (see above), the key distinction being the absence of capillary infiltration of vessels and veno-occlusive-like changes. The cause of this proliferation is not completely determined, but it likely relates to concomitant left ventricular cardiac failure or possibly a direct angiogenic effect of hypoxia on the capillary bed.",
