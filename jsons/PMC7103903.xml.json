            "text": "Avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), which belongs to gammacoronavirus, is worldwide in distribution and causes a highly contagious disease in chickens. IBV has a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA genome of 27.6 kb in size. Two polyproteins 1a and 1ab account for approximately two-thirds of the viral genome-coding region and make up the replication transcription complex (RTC). The polyprotein 1ab is translated through the -1 frame-shift translation mechanism [1]. The 1ab protein is further cleaved into 15 nonstructural proteins (NSPs), which may account for virus pathogenicity [2]. The IBV genome encodes four major structural proteins: the spike glycoprotein (S), the small envelope protein (E), the membrane glycoprotein (M), and the nucleocapsid protein (N) [3].",

The sequence changes in viral genome associated with attenuation were studied in some wild strains, such as the pathogenic Arkansas-Delmarva Poultry Industry Ark/Ark-DPI/81 (ArkDPI) [4, 5], the Massachusetts strain (Mass), and the pathogenic Georgia 98 virus GA98/CWL0470/98 (GA98) in the US [5] as well as the CK/CH/LDL/97I strain [6], the YX10 strain [7], and SDZB0808 strain [8] in China. Comparison of the genome sequences of virulent and attenuated avian IBV strain Ark DPI viruses [4] revealed that most of these substitutions were located in the replicase 1a and spike genes. Analyses on the consensus full-length genome sequences of three different IBV serotypes (Ark, GA98, and Mass41) suggesting the potential role of NSP3 in the attenuation procedure [5]. Sequence variations in different genes, especially the S gene and NSP3, in the genomes of CK/CH/LDL/97I viruses might contribute to differences in viral replication, pathogenicity, antigenicity, immunogenicity, and tissue tropism [6]. In the live-attenuated vaccine candidate strain (YX10p90), 26 amino acid substitutions in 6 proteins and a 110-bp deletion in the 3\u2032 untranslated region were identified [7]. The study on virulent QX genotype IBV strain (SDZB0808) attenuation mechanism found that the replicase 1a sequence was truncated by 30 bp in the same gene region in the passage 60\u2013110 viruses [8].",

Gene 1 (replicase gene) and the accessory protein genes (genes 3 and 5) could be targets for rational attenuation for vaccine development. One or more of the gene 1 (replicase gene)-encoded proteins (NSP2-NSP16) are determinants of pathogenicity [10]. Very few amino acid substitutions within the replicase gene can result in attenuation following serial passage in embryonated eggs [2]. Four accessory proteins (3a, 3b, 5a, and 5b), whose functions may include antagonism of innate immune responses, encoded by genes 3 and 5, are not essential for replication [10]. Spike (S) protein is a determinant of cell tropism and could induce protective immunity but not alter the viral pathogenicity [2, 9, 12]. None of the structural or accessory genes derived from an IBV virulent isolate were able to restore virulence and the loss of virulence associated with the Beaudette strain resides in the replicase gene [2]. However, another study using the reverse genetics system based on virulent QX-like YN IBV strain in China [13] indicated that the S gene and 5a accessory gene are responsible for the attenuation. The S gene mutations and the 5a accessory gene of the attenuated IBV strain (aYN) were both accountable for the decreased pathogenicity of virulent IBV, which was not due to a replication deficiency in the recombinant viruses.",

However, in the previous study for two other IBVs (Ark/Ark-DPI/81 and Mass/Mass41/41) [5], no statistical difference was found between the wild and attenuated viruses at any of the time points tested when a higher virus titer (105 EID50/egg) was inoculated into chicken embryos. To clarify the difference from our observations, we used 3 different virus concentrations to inoculate chicken embryos in another experiment (Table 2). At the higher virus inoculation concentration (104.7 EID50/0.1 ml), we had similar findings like ArkDPI and Mass with no statistical difference between TW2575/98vac and TW2575/98w. At two lower virus inoculation concentrations (103.7 and 102.7 EID50/0.1 ml), the results revealed a similar observation in Table 1 that TW2575/98vac is significantly higher than TW2575/98w (p < 0.05). Therefore, the difference in replication efficiency between wild and vaccine IBV strains in chicken embryos could be observed when the virus inoculation concentration was decreased to a lower level. In addition, earlier embryonic death revealed from TW2575/98vac (Tables 1 and 2) may be the result of the higher replication efficiency and therefore account for the higher pathogenicity in chicken embryos.",

It is speculated that the amino acid substitutions within the replicase of TW2575/98vac, when compared with TW2575/98w, may be the possible reason. We discuss this question in 3 aspects: (1) the timing for the appearance of individual amino acid substitutions in specific TW2575/98 passages, (2) the comparisons of genetic changes acquired from the other vaccines attenuated from wild IBVs at the 30 corresponding sites in the TW2575/98, and (3) the switch on the substituted amino acid residue chemical characteristics from possible candidates for contributing virulence.",

Those substitutions appeared and cumulated in later passages may strongly contribute to the loss of virulence and lead to successful attenuation. Two of the other attenuated IBVs, the ArkDPI vaccine [25] and QX-like nephropathogenic vaccine [7] have been developed after continuous passages in chicken embryos. The decline in virulence of the wild ArkDPI and QX-like viruses for chickens could be observed gradually and became significantly after the 51st and 58th passages, respectively. In our laboratory, 1-day-old birds given 1 \u00d7 107 EID50 of passage 65 of TW2575/98 via the intranasal route had 20% (2/10) mortality [23]. Although the passage 65 of the IBV stock is not fully attenuated, it indicates the later substitutions appear after the 65th passage may have direct associations with attenuation. The data from 30 amino acid substitutions found in specific TW2575/98w passages are listed in Table 5. Nine amino acid substitutions that appear in the 69th and 77th specific passages may be potential candidates contributing to successful TW2575/98w to TW2575/98vac attenuation.

Based on the study of Cavanagh et al. and Armesto et al., gene 1 is the target of rational attenuation [2, 10].

Considering that the four amino acid substitutions (V342D, S1493P, P2025S, and F2308Y) are located in gene 1 and the latter 3 ones belong to the NSP3 in our study, these four candidates therefore may have great highly direct contributions for successful attenuation of the wild IB viruses (TW2575/98).

This kind of deletion was not found among the TW2575/98 passages during attenuation. The deletion (a fragment of different lengths) in 3\u2032-UTR downstream of the N protein gene has been found in the attenuated strain of several IBVs, such as TW2296/95 (TW-II group) in Taiwan (a 49-bp deletion at the 76th passage) [15], QX-like strain CK/CH/LHLJ/04 V (a 109-bp deletion at the 110th passage) [28] and YX10p90 (a 110-bp deletion at the 90th passage) in China [7], as well as Vic S, I, and S strains (a 58-bp deletion) in Australia [14], respectively.

Therefore, the methodology used in our study, which analyzes the appearance of amino acid substitutions in different homologous strain passages attenuated gradually from TW2575/98w to TW2575/98vac (longitudinal selection) and comparisons between amino acid substitutions observed after attenuation of TW2575/98 (TW-I group) and TW2296/95 (TW-II group) in Taiwan as well as the heterologous IBVs in several countries (horizontal comparison), may contribute to supplement the reverse genetics methodology for targeting virulence determinants. Therefore, further study to clarify the roles of the aforementioned four candidates (amino acid substitutions) involved in attenuation is potentially valuable in the future.",

Because of the ability to grow rapidly, vaccine strains often cause early embryonic death. The virus strain attenuation process selected by domesticating seems to be similar to that of unlocking the number-lock. Each number-lock can be set with a different code combination. That is why our findings in this study indicated that any one of all molecular variations found in TW2575/98 were not observed at the corresponding site of other IBVs and vice versa. Therefore, molecular variations contributed to the successful attenuation of different wild IBVs. IBVs are diverse and not restricted to a fixed pattern or specific amino acid alterations in viral proteins. Additionally, four amino acid changes within the replicase gene-encoded proteins might be associated with TW2575/98 virus virulence.",
