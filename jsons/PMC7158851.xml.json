Protease inhibitors have been considered as candidate therapy because they inhibit enzymes that activate envelope glycoproteins as part of the process of viral entry into cells [1]. The use of lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r) has been supported by data from in vitro studies, animal models and positive clinical outcomes when LPV/r was given to patients infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) diseases also caused by coronaviruses [2, 3, 4, 5]. Other antiretrovirals have been proposed based on virtual screening and in vitro studies, and several clinical trials are planned. Lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r) is included in rapid guidance issued by researchers from Wuhan University based on clinical use during prior epidemics of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and MERS coronavirus (CoV) infections [6].",

LPV/r was not associated with a statistically significant difference in time to clinical improvement; 28 day mortality was numerically lower in the LPV/r group (14/99) compared to the control group (25/100), but this difference was not statistically significant in the intention\u2010to\u2010treat analysis. Accelerated clinical recovery and reduced mortality were observed in those treated within 12 days of symptom onset, but not in those treated later. Almost half of patients in the LPV/r group (46 patients, 48.4%) and control group (49 patients, 46.7%) reported one or more adverse events: gastrointestinal\u2010related complaints including nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea were more common in the lopinavir/ritonavir group. A second randomized trial assessed patients admitted to hospital with mild/moderate COVID\u201019, and compared outcomes of 21 patients given LPV/r (200mg/50mg twice a day) with 16 patients given ardibol and 7 patients who were not given any antiviral therapy [24]. In this trial, LPV/r did not show any benefit in terms of time to viral clearance (PCR negativity) or progression to severe disease. For both trials, certainty of the evidence was low due to risk of bias (investigators not blinded to the intervention, and imprecision.",

The second study, from South Korea, retrospectively enrolled health care workers considered at high risk of MERS infection. Of 22 healthcare workers given post\u2010exposure prophylaxis (PEP) comprising ribavirin and LPV/r, none were infected; this compared to 9 of 21 healthcare workers not given PEP who became infected [39]. The third study, from China, compared characteristics of 8 HIV\u2010positive individuals on different antiretroviral regimens who had contracted COVID\u201019 infection with 1166 patients who had not been infected [40]. No statistically significant relationship was found between type of antiretroviral regimen and infection status. The certainty of the evidence across outcomes was again very low due to uncertainty due to limited sample size, lack of uniformity of regimens being used to treat patients, and lack of information regarding intensity of exposure (Appendix S2).",
