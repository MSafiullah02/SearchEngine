An elegant way to achieve this objective is to use a gene therapy approach in which the antiviral siRNA is stably expressed in the cell as a short hairpin RNA (shRNA).4 Stable expression of anti-HIV shRNAs in T cells results in potent inhibition of HIV-1 replication.5,6 However, the application of a single shRNA inhibitor is not sufficient to maintain inhibition. After extended culturing, resistant virus can emerge containing point mutations or deletions within the siRNA target site.7,8,9,10\n11 Thus, in order to achieve durable inhibition, multiple antiviral siRNAs should be expressed simultaneously,9,12,13 a strategy similar to current drug combination therapy of HIV-1-infected individuals.14,15 Strategies to express multiple siRNAs16 include extended shRNAs,17 long double-stranded RNA expression,18 and multiple shRNA expression,9,19 of which the latter is currently most promising.",

Retroviruses are naturally recombination prone, as the reverse transcriptase is a polymerase with poor processivity. During the transduction process, in which reverse transcriptase converts the RNA genome into DNA, reverse transcriptase can slip on repeats in the RNA template, resulting in a sequence duplication or deletion.27,28,29,30 This could seriously hamper the genetic stability of lentiviral vectors with multiple shRNA cassettes.",

Initial co-transfection experiments indicate that such a multiple shRNA expression strategy is effective because the individual shRNA activity was comparable for single and multiple shRNA constructs. However, a strikingly different pattern emerged in transduced cells, since the shRNA activity was diminished with an increasing number of shRNA cassettes. We analyzed cell clones transduced with the multiple shRNA lentiviral vectors and found that recombination occurs frequently. For instance, only 14% of the cell clones transduced with a triple shRNA lentivirus contained an intact provirus. Thus, the reduced shRNA activity was caused by a recombination-mediated deletion of shRNA cassettes. In order to prevent recombination, we designed a viral vector without repeat sequences. Four different shRNAs were expressed from four different promoters. We analyzed transduced cell clones and confirmed that deletion did not occur. Finally, we show for the first time that HIV-1 escape can be prevented when four different shRNAs are simultaneously expressed.",

For the development of a multiple shRNA approach, we constructed plasmids encoding two or three different shRNAs, each expressed from their own H1 promoter (Figure 1b). The shRNA2 construct encodes the Pol-47 and Gag-5 inhibitors, shRNA3 encodes Pol-1 in addition. We used appropriate Luciferase reporters to measure the activity of individual shRNAs. In initial co-transfection experiments, in which reporters for each shRNA target were co-transfected with the shRNA1, shRNA2, and shRNA3 plasmids, we measured specific reporter gene knock-down irrespective of the type of vector used. For instance, inhibition of Pol-47 was scored on the Luc Pol-47 reporter, showing equal activity of shRNA1, shRNA2, and shRNA3 (Figure 1c). Several control vectors, including the empty lentiviral vector JS1 and several unrelated shRNAs (Gag-5 and Pol-1) have no impact on the Luc Pol-47 reporter. Similar results were obtained for the other shRNAs in the multi-shRNA vectors on the matching reporters (data not shown).",

Transduced green fluorescent protein (GFP) positive cells were selected with live fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). We transfected these cells with the Luc Pol-47 reporter and observed good inhibition for shRNA1, but a profound decrease in the magnitude of inhibition for shRNA2 and shRNA3 (Figure 1d). A similar drop in activity was scored for the other shRNAs encoded by the shRNA2 and shRNA3 constructs on their respective targets (data not shown). Thus, a striking difference was observed in the transiently transfected cells versus the stably transduced cell lines. Whereas full activity of the shRNAs was observed in the former assay, the inhibitory potential of shRNA2 and shRNA3 is significantly reduced in the transduced cells. One could argue that this is due to saturation of the RNAi pathway, but this is highly unlikely because the transduced cells will only have a single lentiviral vector copy. Another possibility is that not all shRNA cassettes were effectively transduced, e.g., through recombination-mediated deletion due to the repeat sequences in the expression cassette (Figure 1b).27\n",

If we look at the single-cassette deletions, cassette B was most frequently deleted (9 of 12 clones). Cassette A and C were only deleted once and twice, respectively. For the double-cassette deletion mutants, both AB (3\u00d7) and BC (4\u00d7) deletions were observed. No proviruses were observed in which A and C are deleted, probably because it requires a double recombination event. Deletion of all three cassettes is not possible by repeat-induced recombination, and is indeed not observed. Deletion of C requires recombination at the H1 promoter, deletion of A is possible only through recombination at the terminator sequence. In total, deletion of A (4\u00d7) is seen less frequently than deletion of C (6\u00d7), which indicates that recombination at the H1 promoter is more likely, as would be expected since it represents the largest repeat sequence. Deletion of B occurs most often, in 16 of the 22 clones analyzed. We also observed deletions in cell clones transduced with the shRNA2 lentiviral vector (data not shown). Since deletion of each expression cassette was frequently observed in the cell clones, these results explain why the magnitude of inhibition was reduced for all shRNAs in cells transduced with shRNA2 and shRNA3. The same deletions with shRNA2 or shRNA3 have also been seen in a transduced T-cell line, SupT1, with 6 of 11 (55%) and 2 of 15 (13%) cell clones containing an intact double or triple cassette, respectively. Thus, repeat sequences should be avoided for effective multiple shRNA expression from a lentiviral vector.",

The shRNA4 combination was made with the H1 Pol-47, 7SK Gag-5, U6 Pol-1, and U1 R/T-5 cassettes (Figure 4a\n). We first confirmed siRNA expression by detection of siRNAs with a Northern blot. All siRNAs were expressed from the shRNA4 construct, albeit somewhat reduced when compared to the corresponding single shRNA-expression vector (Figure 4b). This may be caused by the transfection of a relatively high amount of vector construct (5 \u03bcg), which may restrict optimal shRNA processing by limitation of the cellular components of the RNAi machinery.34 In a more quantitative setting, we avoid such a competition effect by transfecting a low amount of vector construct (2 ng). We tested the shRNA4 construct in co-transfections with the four Luciferase reporters (Figure 4c). Control cells received no shRNA inhibitor (ctrl, activity set at 1.0). The shRNA4 construct was active against all four reporters. In fact, the inhibitory potential was similar to that of the appropriate single shRNA constructs. These results confirm that multiple shRNAs can be efficiently expressed from a single construct using different promoters.",

First, we selected 10 transduced cell clones to check the status of the integrated provirus. We performed the PCR across the insert and observed only the band corresponding to the size of the shRNA4 cassette (Figure 5a\n). The control lane (C) shows a PCR on the input shRNA4 plasmid. Two-cell clones, of either untransduced or Pol-47 transduced (shRNA1) cells, are also shown as controls. Thus, the shRNA4 cassette with the four different promoters is stably transduced. Second, we compared Luciferase reporter inhibition in the transduced 293T cells with the previously constructed single shRNA 293T cell lines (Figure 5b). Note that these shRNA1 cell lines express the indicated shRNA from the H1 promoter. Reporter inhibition in shRNA1 cells is similar in magnitude for each shRNA, and fully specific for the matching reporter. In the shRNA4 cells, inhibition is observed with all four reporters. Quantitatively, a similar level of reporter inhibition is observed for Gag-5, Pol-1, and Pol-47. R/T-5, expressed in shRNA4 from the U1 polymerase II promoter, has a reduced magnitude of inhibition as compared to the other shRNAs, which coincides with a reduced expression level (Figure 4b).

All cell lines were viable and no differences in growth rates were observed. We infected six independent cultures of each cell line with the HIV-1 LAI isolate.37 Efficient replication of this virus was measured in control vector\u2013transduced cells (Figure 6a\n). Virus replication was initially potently inhibited in Pol-47 cells (Figure 6a). However, after extended culturing, the replicating virus emerged in five of six cultures as judged by an increase in CA-p24 in the culture medium and syncytia formation. We tested this putative escape virus by infection of a set of SupT1-transduced cells. This virus indeed showed a resistant phenotype, as it only replicated in the control cells and Pol-47 cells, but not in cells that express another shRNA inhibitor (Gag-5, Pol-1, or R/T-5) or the shRNA4 combination (Figure 6b). Sequence analysis confirmed resistance, as point mutations within the 19-nucleotide Pol-47 target sequence of the five escape cultures were observed (G8A, 2 \u00d7 G15A, G9A, and G12T).",

Inhibition of virus replication was initially potent; however, slowly replicating virus did emerge in two cultures after 40 days. These viruses could represent escape viruses, perhaps still partially inhibited or slowly replicating due to mutations in multiple highly conserved sequences, resulting in a loss of viral fitness. Alternatively, slow spreading of the input wild-type virus may occur when it is not blocked completely. We and others have described such a pseudo-escape phenomenon in cell lines that allow efficient viral spread via cell\u2013cell contact.11,38 To critically discriminate between these possibilities, we passaged the accumulated virus to a set of uninfected cells. The virus was able to replicate in the control SupT1 cells (JS1), but not in any of the shRNA-expressing cells, with either a single inhibitor (Gag-5, Pol-1, Pol-47, and R/T-5) or shRNA4 (Figure 6d). This result indicates that the breakthrough virus is not resistant to any of the four shRNAs expressed in the shRNA4 cell line. This important conclusion was confirmed by sequencing of all four target sequences in the viral genome. Not a single point mutation was observed in any of the four targets.",

Thus, we also tested our lentiviral vectors in transduced primary CD4+ T cells. Again, cells were transduced at low MOI (0.2) with the control vector, JS1, shRNA1 vector Pol-47, or the shRNA4 vector and transduced cells were selected. As with the transduced SupT1 cell lines, no differences in viability or growth rates were observed. Next, we challenged the transduced cells with the wild-type HIV-1 virus (Figure 7a\n). In the control cells, efficient virus replication was detected. By contrast, virus replication was strongly inhibited in both the Pol-47 and shRNA4 cells, but more potent inhibition was scored in the latter cells. We also infected the transduced cells with an HIV-1 mutant that is resistant to Pol-47 due to a G to A mutation at target position 8 and 15 (Figure 7b). The mutant virus replicated equally well in the control JS-1 and Pol-47 cells, confirming its resistance to Pol-47, but it was as strongly inhibited in the shRNA4 cell line as the wild-type virus. These results show that the combined action of the four shRNAs results in a more potent inhibition as compared to a single shRNA in primary CD4+ cells.",

A relatively simple strategy would be to express each shRNA from a separate promoter. Several groups have reported expression of multiple RNAs from separate promoters in a lentiviral vector.6,9,19,25,39 Here we performed an in-depth analysis of a multiple shRNA expression strategy in which three shRNAs are expressed from repeated promoters. We found that this expression strategy causes frequent recombination within the lentiviral vector genome at repeat sequences of the expression cassette, resulting in deletion of one or two cassettes. Thus, when cells are transduced with the shRNA3 lentiviral vector, the result is a heterogenous population of integrated lentivirus proviral DNA expressing one, two, or three shRNAs. For the development of a successful RNAi-based gene therapy approach against HIV-1, this multiple shRNA expression strategy is unlikely to be successful. Cell populations that express only a single shRNA will provide a niche in which resistant viruses will be selected, ultimately leading to full resistance to all shRNAs.",

The shRNA4 vector titer was reduced due to an increase in vector genome size, but we note that the PGK promoter and GFP gene (1,255 nt) will eventually be removed from the clinical vector, thus avoiding this production problem. We next tested the effect on HIV-1 replication in a gene therapy setting. In a transduced cell line expressing only a single shRNA, HIV-1 could escape by mutating the target sequence. By contrast, HIV-1 did not escape in the shRNA4-transduced cell line. However, viral spread was observed in two of the six infected shRNA4 cell cultures, though these viruses are not true escape mutants, since they did not have a resistant phenotype upon viral passage to fresh cells. Furthermore, no genotypic changes were observed in the four target sequences. This result indicates that virus replication is not completely blocked by the combined expression of four shRNAs. This should not come as a surprise since RNAi does not target the incoming genome42,43 and RNAi does not silence gene expression completely. Thus, virus replication may still occur, albeit at a very low level, perhaps slowly accumulating until a certain threshold is reached at which CA-p24 production can be measured. Most importantly, we did not witness viral escape, which shows that the imposed genetic barrier is too high for the virus to overcome inhibition by four shRNAs.1,12,13\n",

Constructs used for shRNA expression are based on pSUPER (OligoEngine, Seattle, WA), pSilencer 2.0-U6 (Ambion, Austin, TX), psiRNA-h7Skhygro G1 (Invivogen, San Diego, CA), and pGeneClip-BasicVector (Promega, Madison, WI), which contain the human H1, U6, 7SK polymerase III promoters, and human U1 polymerase II promoter, respectively (which we renamed pH1, pU6, p7SK, and pU1). First, shRNA expression plasmids were constructed by inserting annealed oligonucleotides, encoding the shRNA transcript, into the appropriate insertion sites. In our oligonucleotide design additional restriction sites were added at 3\u2032 of the transcription termination sites of the U6 and 7SK constructs to facilitate cloning of the shRNA4 construct (BglII, ZraI, ClaI, XhoI for U6 and SalI, XhoI for 7SK). The shRNA4 plasmid was constructed from the different shRNA expression plasmids (pH1Pol47, p7SKGag5, pU6Pol1, and pU1R/T5) as follows. First, the 7SK cassette was inserted behind the H1 cassette with the ClaI/SalI restriction sites. Second, the U6 cassette was excised with Eco RI/BglII and inserted in front of the U1 promoter using the Eco RI/Bam HI sites. Finally, the U6-U1 double cassette was inserted in the SalI/XhoI site of the H1-7SK construct, yielding pH1Pol47-7SKGag5-U6Pol1-U1R/T5, or shRNA4. The shRNA4 cassette was excised with SmaI/XhoI and inserted in the lentiviral vector backbone of JS1 in the multiple cloning site (Eco RV/XhoI), resulting in JS1-shRNA4.",

For Northern blot analysis, 15 \u03bcg total RNA was heated for 5 minutes at 95 \u00b0C and electrophoresed in a 15% denaturing polyacrylamide gel (precast Novex TBU gel, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). To check for equal loading, the gel was stained with 2 \u03bcg/ml ethidium bromide in ultrapure water for 20 minutes. Destaining was performed by rinsing the gel three times with ultrapure water for 10 minutes. The bands were visualized under ultraviolet light.
