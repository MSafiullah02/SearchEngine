Methods and Results: Nine eluents were evaluated for recovery of infectious MS2 from PPE: 1AE5% beef extract (BE) pH 7AE5 with and without 0AE1% Tween 80, 1AE5% BE pH 9AE0 with and without 0AE1% Tween 80, 3% BE pH 7AE5 with and without 0AE1% Tween 80, 3% BE pH 9AE0 with and without 0AE1% Tween 80 and PBS with 0AE1% Tween 80. Methods were applied to experimentally contaminated PPE. Elution followed by two-step enrichment assay could recover virus inputs as low as 1AE5 log 10 , and could recover >90% of inoculated virus from used items of experimentally contaminated PPE worn by human volunteers. Conclusions: BE was effective for recovering infectious viruses from a range of PPE materials. Significance and Impact of the Study: PPE plays a crucial role in interrupting transmission of infectious agents from patients to healthcare workers (HCWs). The fate of micro-organisms when PPE is removed and disposed of has important consequences for infection control. Methods described here can be used to conduct rigorous studies of viral survival and transfer on PPE for risk assessments in infection control and HCW protection.",

Caring for patients with communicable diseases places HCWs at risk for exposure to pathogens during patient care activities, and requires protective measures such as patient isolation, HCW vaccination and the use of personal protective equipment (PPE). PPE plays a crucial role in interrupting transmission of infectious bacterial and viral agents from patients to HCWs. PPE includes use of barriers (gowns, gloves and eye shields) and respiratory protection (masks and respirators) alone or in combination to protect mucous membranes, airways, skin and clothing from contact with infectious agents during patient care (Siegel et al. 2007) .",

Nosocomial SARS also brought renewed attention to the question of whether viruses can spread from person to person via fomites in the healthcare environment, as SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) nucleic acids were recovered from hospital surfaces, including bedrails, doorknobs, telephones and ventilator controls, in outbreak settings (Dowell et al. 2004) .",

During the performance of healthcare tasks, items of PPE may become contaminated by viable pathogenic micro-organisms spread by contact, droplets or aerosols from patients' respiratory secretions, urine, faeces and other body fluids. Bacteria and viruses can survive for extended periods on the types of materials PPE is made from (Bean et al. 1982; Brady et al. 1990; Wang 1999) . Thus, PPE items are potential fomites, and may play a role in the transmission of disease if they become contaminated with infectious micro-organisms. The fate of contaminating micro-organisms when PPE is removed and disposed of has important consequences for infection control, and the possibility that PPE itself may be a fomite that contributes to the spread of viruses remains a poorly understood area in need of research. In order to determine the dynamics of virus survival and transmission via contaminated PPE and the attendant health risks, levels of viral contamination on PPE need to be quantified. This requires effective and reproducible methods to recover infectious viruses from items of PPE including contact isolation gowns, N95 respirators, gloves and eye protection.",

Many of the viruses that have been identified as important causes of nosocomial viral infection or have high potential for nosocomial transmission, such as rotaviruses, rhinoviruses, parvoviruses and noroviruses, are nonenveloped viruses. MS2 is a nonpathogenic, nonenveloped virus, and has been used extensively as a surrogate for nonenveloped pathogenic viruses of humans (Allwood et al. 2003; Meschke and Sobsey 2003; Dawson et al. 2005; Sickbert-Bennett et al. 2005; Bae and Schwab 2008) . MS2 has also been shown to have a higher binding potential for PPE materials than other viruses traditionally used as viral surrogates, such as FX174 (Lytle et al. 1991; Lytle and Routson 1995) , making it a conservative surrogate for studies of disruption of viral binding to PPE. These qualities suggest that MS2 may be a promising surrogate for evaluating methods for recovery of viruses from healthcare PPE.",

            "text": "Candidate eluents for recovery of virus from PPE should be selected for their potential to disrupt viral binding to PPE materials. The attachment of viruses to surfaces is largely governed by electrostatic and Van der Waals interactions with other molecules and surfaces (Gerba 1984) . PPE items are often made of synthetic polymers with both charged and hydrophobic characteristics. The protein coats of nonenveloped viruses can have pockets of hydrophobicity, and enveloped viruses have hydrophobic lipid membranes (Gerba 1984) . Therefore, virus attachment to PPE may be mediated by electrostatic interactions, where charged viral surfaces encounter charged groups on PPE surfaces and hydrophobic reactions, where hydrophobic molecules on the surface of both viruses and PPE are excluded by the surrounding water molecules. Methods to elute viruses from PPE materials can be designed to disrupt these interactions. Robust and efficient virus recovery methods based on altering the adsorption and attachment behaviour of viruses in contact with surfaces have been developed for eluting viruses from charged filter media using protein solutions (Polaczyk et al. 2007) . Molecules in proteinaceous eluents have a variety of surface charges, and compete with viruses for attachment and adsorption sites on surfaces (Gerba 1984) . These findings suggest that protein eluents, particularly beef extract (BE), may be effective for eluting viruses from different types of surfaces. The addition of detergents that disrupt hydrophobic interactions, such as Tween 80, may also promote virus recovery from surfaces (Farrah 1982; Lukasik et al. 2000) .",

It was hypothesized that this was a result of viruses in the inoculum existing as aggregates. The titre of viruses existing in an aggregated state can be underestimated by plaque count methods because of single plaques being formed by an aggregate consisting of multiple viruses (Teunis et al. 2005 such as BE can disrupt aggregates formed by viruses (Gerba 1984) . If aggregated viruses in the inoculum were subsequently dispersed by the BE eluent, the titre of virus recovered from the eluent would be higher than that of the inoculum. In an effort to address this problem, viruses in subsequent experiments were monodispersed by sequential filtration before being inoculated onto PPE. To evaluate the effect of monodispersion on virus recovery, monodispersed MS2 was inoculated onto multiple PPE types in amounts of 1AE5, 2AE5 or 4AE6 log 10 PFU and eluted as described above. As seen in Fig. 3 , when virus is dispersed, the titre of virus recovered from gowns and other PPE types does not differ significantly (using unpaired t-test) from the inoculum titre, with mean recoveries of 95% of initial viruses inoculated. These results indicate that monodispersion of viral inocula prior to application is necessary to accurately measure viral recovery from experimentally contaminated PPE materials.",

To accurately assess these risks, we need data on levels of viral contamination and the extent of viral survival on PPE items. The methods described in this work can help fill data gaps that currently exist in both these areas. The existing literature on viruses on PPE encompasses only some materials, and different studies have used a variety of methods to recover viruses from test materials, making comparisons between them difficult. Different methods for viral recovery may have different recovery efficiencies, especially if the method was not specifically developed for the recovery of viruses. This study demonstrated that a protein-based eluent, BE, is effective for eluting nonenveloped viruses from a range of PPE materials, possibly because of the disruption of both charged and hydrophobic interactions between the virus and the PPE surface. Greater than 90% of input virus was recovered from PPE experimentally contaminated with MS2 after it was worn by human volunteers, showing that immersion in neutral pH BE with agitation can efficiently recover a nonenveloped virus from PPE. Methods used for measuring viral contamination on PPE need to be able to recover low numbers of virus. The methods described here can recover as few as 30 PFU (1AE5 log 10 ) from contaminated PPE, making them applicable in studies of PPE used in healthcare practice, where levels of contamination may be very low. BE may also be efficacious for the elution of other types of pathogenic viruses from PPE, including enveloped viruses such as SARS-CoV, influenza, parainfluenza, mumps, measles and respiratory syncytial virus, but these methods need to be evaluated using these or other enveloped viruses to determine their recovery efficacy.",

            "text": "The results of this study indicate that BE elution can recover nonenveloped viruses without inactivating them, making them applicable to studies of virus survival. To date, there have been few studies assessing the survival of pathogens on materials used to make PPE (Yassi et al. 2005) , but they suggest that viruses have the potential to survive on PPE materials for longer than single-use PPE is usually worn, creating the potential for viral transfer when PPE is handled after wearing. Some investigations have found that viruses can survive on materials used to make other types of PPE. When deposited in high numbers (10 6 TCID 50 ), SARS-CoV has been found to survive on gowns for up to 2 days (Lai et al. 2005) . Enveloped ssRNA viruses have been shown to survive on latex glove material; human CoV 229E can survive for up to 2 h, although it loses up to 85% of its infectious titre (Sizun et al. 2000) , and avian influenza virus can survive for up to 6 days without loss of infectious titre (Tiwari et al. 2006) . Nonenveloped RNA viruses, such as human rotavirus and hepatitis A virus, can survive for several days on latex under ambient conditions, with only 1 log 10 loss in infectious titre (Abad et al. 1994) . These findings suggest that further studies are needed to determine how long pathogenic viruses can survive on PPE and what risk this might pose to HCWs. Comparative studies of survival of a range of pathogenic viruses on different PPE types can be greatly strengthened by the use of efficient elution methods designed for viruses, applied consistently across studies. The use of BE elution appears to be a candidate method for these types of investigations.",

            "text": "These methods are also applicable to studies of viral contamination on PPE during actual patient care activities. If patients shed viruses onto HCWs' PPE in the course of patient care, these viruses can remain infectious when PPE is removed. Transfer of viruses from experimentally contaminated fabrics (Rusin et al. 2002) , plastic surfaces (Gwaltney and Hendley 1982) and gloves (Hall et al. 1980) to hands has been demonstrated, suggesting that viruses can transfer from PPE to hands when contaminated items are handled in the course of removal and disposal. In addition, contamination can be present on skin after exposure to pathogens even when PPE is worn (Zamora et al. 2006) , and may be transferred to used items of PPE, if they are handled after removal. Virus transfer between hands and PPE items can encourage both accidental autoinoculation by the HCW and subsequent transmission of viruses to other patients, staff or family members, especially when inadequate hand hygiene is practised (Pittet et al. 2006) . Although this risk has been recognized, the magnitude of risk is difficult to assess because there are few data available on levels of viral contamination on PPE after use in patient care. The methods we have developed, which can recover low numbers of viruses, can be used to recover viruses from PPE items used in patient care, providing data that will aid in the assessment of risks posed by handling of contaminated PPE after patient care activities. The results of this study also suggest that MS2 is a promising surrogate for studying the dynamics of nonenveloped virus survival and transfer in healthcare settings. It has been used in studies of the efficacy of healthcare handwashing agents (Sickbert-Bennett et al. 2005) , virus transfer between hands and objects (Hall et al. 1980; Gwaltney and Hendley 1982; Rusin et al. 2002) and HCW contamination after removal of contaminated PPE (Casanova et al. 2008) . As a nonpathogenic virus that can be efficiently recovered and assayed for infectivity, MS2 may be a useful surrogate for modelling the spread viral of contamination during PPE use and removal in healthcare environments. Robust methods to measure viral contamination on PPE items can be applied to more accurately assess these and other microbial risks of PPE removal, handling and reuse in all healthcare settings. The methods described here are the first that have been shown to give high virus recovery with multiple types of PPE. These methods can be used with model viruses or evaluated for pathogenic viruses to conduct rigorous studies of viral survival and transfer on PPE for risk assessments in infection control and HCW protection.",
