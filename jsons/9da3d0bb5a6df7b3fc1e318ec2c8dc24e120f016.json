Mycorrhiza refers to an association or symbiosis between plants and fungi that colonize the roots during periods of active plant growth. The intimate symbiotic relationships developed between mycorrhizal fungi and plants, since the colonization of land by the latter, have led to interdependence between these organisms for many basic processes. The fungi require plants to accomplish their life cycle. Plants depend heavily on mycorrhizal fungi for many different functions, such as mineral nutrition and abiotic and biotic stress resistance. Substantial evidence has accumulated in the recent past about how the use of the microsymbiont could significantly contribute in decreasing use of fertilizers and pesticides in agriculture, forestry and flori-hortriculture, especially if combined with other beneficial soil microorganisms.",

The described species of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi mainly belong to Zygomycetes placed in the order Glomerales. However, the growing of arbuscular mycorrhizae in pure culture in the absence of living host roots is a matter of global concern. Unfortunately, their biotechnological applications cannot be exploited to the level they deserve due to their axenically unculturable nature.",

There is a resurgence in the demands for medicinal herbs. As a consequence, the herbs are now under pressure, also because of shrinking habitats, and are in a phase of extinction. It has, therefore, become necessary to cultivate medicinal plants on a large scale (Rai 1994) . At least 20-30 medicinal herbs have been declared chronically endangered by the Government of India. The main reason is increasing biotic pressure on forests and unscientific exploitation of medicinal plants. Conservation of threatened species and promotion of high yielding varieties can be achieved by various modern techniques of biotechnology, such as tissue culture, micropropagation and protoplast culture. Applying these techniques, endangered medicinal plants have been successfully multiplied and developed.",

When patients use home remedies for acute, often self-limited, conditions, such as a cold, sore throat, or bee sting, it is often because professional care is not immediately available, too inconvenient, costly, or time consuming.

Considerable progress has been made during the past two centuries when chemists and biologists accepted the challenge of combating these dreadful diseases by synthesizing a wide plethora of organic compounds having the capacity to combat various pathogens. However, indiscriminate use of synthetic drugs has resulted in mutation of strains making them insensitive to the chemical agent leading to global hazard of drug resistance.

OPs disrupt neurotransmission by inhibiting synaptic acetylcholinesterase (AChE-S), leading to an accumulation of acetylcholine in the synapse and neural overstimulation. The severity of the ensuing nicotinic and muscarinic symptoms is dose-dependent and can result in death due to cardiovascular and respiratory collapse.

It is common practice to attempt to clear MRSA colonization and infection in hospital patients with topical antimicrobials and antiseptics; mupirocin and chlorhexidine, for example, are currently employed as part of standard hospital MRSA decolonization protocols.

Furthermore, it has been shown that bacteria such as S. aureus that transiently colonize the skin were more susceptible to TTO than bacteria such as coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS), which are regarded as part of the normal commensal skin flora. It has been suggested, therefore, that TTO could be useful for removing transient skin flora while suppressing but still maintaining the resident flora, which acts as a natural defence against colonization by other pathogenic bacteria. Studies comparing the activity of TTO against planktonically grown clinical skin isolates of MRSA, meticillin-sensitive S. aureus (MSSA) and CoNS using both a modified broth microdilution method and a quantitative in vitro time-kill test method have been carried out (Pinto et al. 2006 ).",

The DSHEA requires no proof of efficacy, no proof of safety, and sets no standards for quality control for products labeled as supplements. Although the DSHEA requires that supplements do not promise a specific cure on the label, they may claim an effect. Now, if questions arise, the burden lies with the FDA to prove a product unsafe, rather than a company proving its product safe. Manufacturers must put a message on the label stating that the FDA has not reviewed claims, but this statement can be subtle. In contrast, regulating agencies in Germany, France, the United Kingdom, and Canada enforce standards of herb quality and safety assessment on manufacturers.",

This fungus grows on a large varieties of inorganic, organic and polyphosphates, and thus serves as a good model organism to study phosphorus metabolism (Malla et al. 2004 ). The molecular mass of denatured acid phosphatase (ACPase) of P. indica was found to be 66 kDa on SDS PAGE. This fungus mediates uptake of phosphorus from the substratum and its translocation to the host by an energy-dependent active process, serves as a strong agent for biological hardening of tissue culture-raised plants, protecting them from \"transplantation shock\", and renders almost 100% survival rate on the hosts tested. This fungus is also a potential \"bio-control agent\" against potent root pathogens. Thus, it displays immense potential to be utilized as a biological tool for plant promotion, protection from pests, and for relieving stress conditions such as those due to acidity, desiccation and heavy metal toxicity. Thus, it may be concluded that this novel fungus has immense potential for biotechnological applications.",

The phylogenetic position of the Sebacinaceae within the Basidiomycota gives an overview of phylogenetic relationships inside this subgroup of Hymenomycetes for which the new order Sebacinales is proposed. The ultrastructural data also indicate that P. indica is a member of the Hymenomycetes (Basidiomycota), and studies on the molecular phylogeny will help to reveal the closest relatives of this species (Fig. 3) . Immunological characterization showed its strong cross-reactivity with the members of Zygomycota (Glomerales) instead of Basidiomycota Singh et al. 2003b) , which needs further critical appraisal.",

In vitro studies, on P. indica and S. vermifera sensu recorded that these two symbiotic fungi profusely interacted with the root system of the crucifer plants viz., mustard (Brassica junacea), spinach (Spinaceae oleracea), cabbage (Brassica oleracea var capitata) (Kumari et al. 2003) and Arabidopsis thaliana (Pham et al. 2004a; Pe\u0161kan-Bergh\u00f6fer et al. 2004; Shahollari et al. 2005) . It would be useful to assess the non hosts of AM fungi with respect to their interaction with P. indica for its further functional characterization. In order to enlighten the molecular events that promote the root growth, the difference in protein expression was analyzed and modification arises due to the interaction with the fungus. Membraneassociated proteins from roots were separated by two-dimensional gel-electrophoresis (2D-PAGE) and identified by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) and tandem mass spectrometry (MS-MS).

In Ayurveda, several medicines are manufactured from this plant. Due to increasing demand for A. vasica by pharmacies, there is a need for its rapid multiplication. In the observations, cuttings of A. vasica were inoculated with P. indica to assess the growth-promoting property of P. indica on this important medicinal plant. Profuse proliferation of roots of A. vasica after inoculation of P. indica was repeatedly recorded (Fig. 5) .

Multiple shoot cultures of Withania somnifera were established from single shoot tip explants and their potential for the production of two principal withanolides, withaferin A and withanolide D, was investigated (Ray and Jay 2001; Ganzera et al. 2003) . The plantlets were then transferred to pots and maintained in a greenhouse for 4 months. 90% of these in vitro-propagated plantlets survived and showed normal growth. Leaves from these plants were used for isolation of the withanolides. Methanolic extract of leaves from plantlets growing in tissue culture and those transferred to the greenhouse were evaluated for immunomodulatory activity. While the extract from greenhouse samples showed potent immunosuppressive activity, those from tissue culture samples did not show any activity (Furmanowa et al. 2001) . Withaferin A acts as radiosensitizer from Withania somnifera. SER (sensitizer enhancement ratio) increased with drug dose, but at higher doses the increased lethality appears to be due to two effects, drug toxicity and radiosensitization The applicability of this drug as a radiosensitizer in cancer therapy needs to be explored (Devi et al.1996; Devi 1996) . The basal stem and leaf areas of treated plants were also enhanced. The lengths of the inflorescence and the number of flowers on inoculated S. calva plants were also increased relative to controls. Similarly, the number of flowers on the flowers on the inoculated plants of W. somnifera was higher than on controls. Seed counts were higher for treated than for control plants.",

It lives up to the description as recent clinical trials show that musli if taken on regular basis, it maintains health and youthfulness, keeps the person energetic and active, increases working capacity, increases tolerance to stress and strain, increases working capacity, gives sound sleep, develops a firm and muscular body, and improves conjugal capability. Phytochemicals like saponins, carbohydrate and proteins are present in the root. This plant has got immense market potential, both domestic and international. Peeled and dried roots are used for therapeutic purposes. Both tubers and seeds are used, but the tubers are a more viable option because they offer better germination rate and tuber growth than seeds. They are normally used to maintain the equilibrium of all the systems of the body and keeps the \"Body-Mind-Soul Complex\" in a state of harmony. On interaction with P. indica, significant growth promotional effect on the plant has been observed besides early flowering in the crop and 90% survival on transplantation (Fig. 7) .",

It was noticed that the rate of survival was very low, up to 40% in the field conditions. The salient reason could be the 'transient transplant shock' that resulted in the stunted growth. Biological hardening has proved to be fruitful. It provided better results for the overall performance of the plants. For employing the technique, inoculation of micropropagated plantlets with active cultures of AMF or mycorrhiza-like fungi appears to be critical for their survival and growth. These preacclimatized plantlets, when transferred to the field, overcame the transient transplant shock, and were able to cope with the changed environment of transplantation which also helped in their successful establishment. Pre-establishment of mycorrhiza in the host roots also helps in the development of the synergistic effect with other rhizosphere microflora that compete in the ecosystem for successful survival ).",

This fungus mediates uptake of phosphorus from the substratum and it is translocated to the host by an energy-dependent active process. The fungus serves as a strong agent for biological hardening of tissue cultureraised plants, protecting them from \"transplantation shock\", and rendering almost 100% survivals on the hosts tested. This fungus is also a potential \"biological agent\" against potent root pathogens. The growth promotion observed may have been caused by a greater absorption of water and mineral nutrients due to extensive root colonization and the proliferation of the mycelium into the soil. Thus, it can be concluded that this root-colonizing fungus promotes growth of many plant species of medicinal and economical importance, including cereals, legumes, ornamental plants, oilseed and vegetables, is a potential candidate for the hardening of tissue culture-raised plants and exerts fungicidal and herbicidal resistance. In plant biotechnology, the emphasis is on the manpower rather than on expensive equipment in both developing and developed countries because of its vast impact on agriculture. Today, micropropagation is the most widely and successfully used technology for the mass production of horticultural, ornamentals, fruits, vegetable, cereals, plantation crops, spices and medicinal plants.",
