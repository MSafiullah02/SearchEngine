            "text": "This population-based study provides valuable insights in the health seeking behaviors of ARI patients during the COVID-19 outbreak (from December 2019 through to March 2020) in Wuhan. Although adults were more likely to report ARI than children aged 3-17 years, a smaller proportion of adults sought medical assistance. Among the reasons for not seeking medical care, parents reported concerns with nosocomial infections for their sick children, while experiencing mild illness was linked to lack of seeking care in adults. Our findings highlight the possible relevance of self-isolation at home and/or at designated medical facilities to manage mild cases and lower the load on hospitals [4] .",

The health seeking behavior of typical patients with ARI may differ from that of COVID-19 cases. We asked adult participants if they were diagnosed as laboratory-confirmed or probable COVID-19 cases. Only 2.2% of them (57/2,595) self-reported to be a laboratory-confirmed or probable COVID-19 case. Among COVID-19 patients, 35.1% (20/57) did not answer the questions regarding healthcare seeking behavior. Hence there was not enough data to compare healthcare seeking behavior between COVID-19 cases and those with typical respiratory diseases. Additionally, the number of questionnaires completed by participants aged 60+ years was relatively small (n=361), probably due to the hurdles encountered by this segment of the population to fill an online All rights reserved.

However, these estimates were mainly based on laboratory-confirmed cases captured by surveillance system, which may overestimate COVID-19 severity. In fact, we found that the majority of mild cases did not seek medical assistance and thus were hardly detectable by surveillance systems. The number of COVID-19 cases in the community level remains unclear due to changes in health seeking behaviors during an outbreak; an assessment of the full severity pyramid of COVID-19 is lacking. While several studies have assessed the healthcare demand of the COVID-19 pandemic on hospital beds, ICU beds and ventilators [9, 10] , no study has evaluated the demand on outpatient facilities. Despite the aforementioned limitations, our study provides key metrics that can be instrumental to fill this gap.",
