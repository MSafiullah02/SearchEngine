            "text": "Acute lymphoid leukaemia (ALL) and chronic myelogenous leukaemia (CML) induced by the fusion gene product Bcr/Abl have a constitutively active tyrosine kinase activity. Specific Bcr/Abl kinase inhibitors (e.g. Imatinib) inhibit its constitutive activation, but several resistance conferring mutations were described. Researchers from Vienna, Austria, and collaborators tested whether the transcription factors Stat3 and Stat5, acting downstream of Bcr/Abl are critical for leukaemia maintenance and could be alternative pharmaceutical targets. They discovered that both factors are required for the development of Bcr/Abl -positive leukaemia, but once established only Stat5 is crucial for the survival and growth of leukemic cells. Therefore, they demonstrate that Bcr/Abl -positive leukaemia cells are addicted to Stat5 to maintain the leukaemic state. Thus, inhibition of Stat5 may provide a novel therapeutic approach for treatment of ALL and CML. /us Hoelbl et al., EMBO Mol.

It will identify characteristic substances in the blood which accompany a certain type of tumor. The technology is based on a microfluidic chip with tiny channels in which a blood sample from the patient circulates. The chip traces marker proteins which are indicative of cancer. The measured concentration of the tumor marker in the blood will help doctors to diagnose the disease at an early stage. Similar testing systems already exist but their measurements are not very precise and they can only detect molecules that are present in large quantities. Biofunctionalized nanoparticles developed by research scientists at the Fraunhofer Institute for Silicate Research ISC in W\u00fcrzburg are the key element in the new sensor.\"We have improved the detection limit compared with the present state of the art by a factor of one hundred,\" explains Dr. J\u00f6rn Probst, Head of the Business Unit Life Science at the ISC. \"We have placed antibody-occupied nanoparticles on the sensor electrode which fish out the relevant proteins. For this purpose, we repeatedly pump the blood across the electrode surface. As with a river, the flow is fastest in midchannel and the water runs more slowly near the bank. We have therefore made a sort of fishing rod using nanoparticles which registers the antibodies in the middle of the blood flow where most proteins swim by per unit of time.\" If an antibody catches the matching protein, a tumor marker, the electrical charge distribution shifts and this is picked up by the electrode.",

It demonstrates the potential of a differentiated nucleus to be reprogrammed back to an embryonic state when exposed to a suitable cytoplasmic environment, such as that of an oocyte. However, reprogramming is often incomplete resulting in embryo, fetal and post-natal mortality. The majority of the clones that do survive to adulthood do appear normal. This provides encouragement for the practical applications of nuclear cloning in the fields of agriculture, animal conservation and biomedicine. /us WIREs Nanomedicine and Nanobiotechnology:",

Understanding how the first organisms arose on Earth and defining the \"minimal genome\" are anything but exclusively intellectual pursuits, as insights into the chemical nature of life and the genetic material necessary to maintain basic properties of life will surely help us to create our own, tailored, biological systems. The application of such tailored systems for therapeutic purposes in mammalian cells appears to be just around the corner. And as xenobiological approaches (e.g. a 4-letter genetic code and artificial amino acids) demonstrate iconically, such work is aimed at complementing, repairing, enhancing or creating variations on \"natural\" living systems... /am",

The primary international repository for the Brachypodium genome sequence data called Brachy-Base is situated at Oregon State University (Corvallis, OR, USA). B. distachyon is an annual grass native to the Mediterranean and Middle East, with little agricultural or economic impor-parts with much more complex genomes, i.e. plants of high importance in world nutrition. Brachypodium has one of the smallest known genomes among grasses and it is physically small. The plants are easy to grow, easy to genetically manipulate, easy to study and have a short lifecycle. Thus, Brachypodium can serve as a model to support research on improved varieties of wheat, oats and barley, as well as switchgrass, a crop of major interest for biofuel production. /mk http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature08747",
