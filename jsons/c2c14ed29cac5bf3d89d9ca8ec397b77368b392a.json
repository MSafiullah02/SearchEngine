CoVs are divided into 4 genera and are capable on occasion of interspecies transmission, as postulated for the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus that emerged briefly in 2003 and a very recently identified lethal novel coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in the Middle East [2, 3] . Since the 1960s, CoV strains 229E and OC43, classified as alpha-and betacoronaviruses, respectively, have been recognized as frequent causes of the \"common cold\" [4] . In the past decade, CoV NL63 (an alphacoronavirus) and HKU1 (a betacoronavirus) were discovered as causes of respiratory illnesses and together with 229E and OC43 continue to circulate widely in humans during the winter months in temperate climates [5] [6] [7] . In addition to upper respiratory tract illness, these latter 4 strains are also associated with bronchitis, acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD), and pneumonia in all age groups [8] [9] [10] [11] . Infection rates range widely from 2% to 20% with marked variation in the predominant circulating strain. Coronaviruses are rarely isolated in routine tissue culture and without molecular diagnostic tests the majority of infections go unrecognized. Most descriptions of the epidemiology and clinical impact of CoV are in infants and young children, with only a few small long-term studies in adults, and none that evaluated illness in outpatient and hospitalized populations simultaneously.

We next compared the incidence of each virus in the prospective cohorts to the incidence in the hospital cohort. This should provide a reasonable gauge of the relative virulence of each virus, with a low ratio indicating that fewer outpatient infections are required to produce similar numbers of hospitalizations compared to a virus with a high ratio. For this analysis, asymptomatic infections and dual virus infections are included in the prospective cohorts.

However, unlike influenza, the impact and importance of other respiratory viruses are less well documented in this age group. Although coronaviruses have been identified in elderly adults and high-risk populations such as those with COPD, cystic fibrosis, or immune deficiencies, only a few studies have included extended periods or directly compared results to other viruses [10, 11, [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] . Our data indicate that depending upon the year, 3%-26% of prospectively enrolled outpatients were infected with OC43 and 229E CoV strains. More importantly, among the hospital cohort the incidence of coronavirus infection varied from 3.3% to 11.8%, with an average of 6.8% per year. These findings are consistent with reports from other investigators. In a 1-year analysis of 2215 patients with COPD enrolled in an influenza vaccine efficacy study, Gorse et al identified coronaviruses in 14% of acute influenza-like illnesses (defined as \u22653 respiratory symptoms or fever plus 2 respiratory symptoms), a rate similar to that of influenza [10] . In that study, OC43 was approximately 3 times more common than 229E; however, asymptomatic infection was not sought and thus the true number of infections was likely greater. In our study, we used less stringent criteria for evaluation and thus we likely detected a broader spectrum of illness. In contrast to our study, Gorse et al found that coronavirus and influenza infections were equally associated with the need for hospitalization, although only influenza was temporally linked to impairment of pulmonary function. In a community-based study from the Netherlands, Graat et al detected coronaviruses by RT-PCR in [11, 15] . In an analysis of a large number of outpatient respiratory illnesses in the United Kingdom, Gaunt identified CoV in approximately 1.1% of older adults over 3 years [8] . In that study, lower respiratory tract illness was noted in 43% of OC43 infections, but in no 229E infections. Our data also suggest that OC43 has greater clinical impact than 229E in adults. OC43 infection was significantly less likely to be asymptomatic or associated with mixed viral infection, the latter a common finding also noted by other investigators. We defined asymptomatic infection by a positive serologic rise during an asymptomatic interval rather than by a positive PCR in asymptomatic persons. The latter may represent \"colonization\" whereas the former likely represents true infection. The true frequency of coinfections is likely to be considerably greater, as we did not assess subjects for rhinovirus and we only performed culture for parainfluenza viruses. The most frequent coinfecting viruses, RSV and hMPV, have previously been shown by us and others to account for significant morbidity in elderly adults [12, 13, [21] [22] [23] . Thus, the observed illness in coinfected subjects may primarily be attributable to the coinfecting virus, a suggestion made by Prill et al in a study of CoV infection in infants [24] . Perhaps most significant is the lower ratio of outpatient infections to inpatient infections for OC43 compared to 229E, suggesting a virulence difference between strains. Our results imply that in elderly adults with a high incidence of underlying cardiopulmonary disease, it would require approximately 3-fold more outpatient 229E infections than OC43 infections to result in an equivalent number of hospitalizations. Although another group of investigators also simultaneously measured the incidence of infection in outpatient and hospitalized adults in the same community with a similar trend, they did not differentiate the coronavirus or influenza strains in the outpatient groups [11, 15] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 514, "end": 518, "text": "[10,", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 519, "end": 522, "text": "11,", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 523, "end": 527, "text": "[15]", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 528, "end": 532, "text": "[16]", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 533, "end": 537, "text": "[17]", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 538, "end": 542, "text": "[18]", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 543, "end": 547, "text": "[19]", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 1188, "end": 1192, "text": "[10]", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 1815, "end": 1819, "text": "[11,", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 1820, "end": 1823, "text": "15]", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 1990, "end": 1993, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 2927, "end": 2931, "text": "[12,", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 2932, "end": 2935, "text": "13,", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 2936, "end": 2940, "text": "[21]", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 2941, "end": 2945, "text": "[22]", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 2946, "end": 2950, "text": "[23]", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 3131, "end": 3135, "text": "[24]", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 3824, "end": 3828, "text": "[11,", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 3829, "end": 3832, "text": "15]", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "In a similar fashion, we were also able to compare the relative impact of both coronaviruses to that of other previously characterized respiratory viruses in these same cohorts.

In some studies, NL63 or HKU1 has been more frequently identified than OC43 and 229E, although the majority reported OC43 to be the most common coronavirus strain identified [8, 9, 17-19, 24, 26] . It is possible that some of our subjects diagnosed with OC43 or 229E by serology alone could include HKU1 or NL63 infections due to antigenic cross-reactivity within coronavirus groups [27] . In addition, we also did not include an asymptomatic control group for the hospital cohort to assess illness causality, as done in one pediatric study [24] . Futhermore, viral coinfections were likely underestimated, and thus the attributable impact of CoV infection may be overestimated. Finally, our study was limited to winter seasons, and although coronaviruses tend to be most active in the winter, we likely missed some CoV infections, especially in year 2 when OC43 was highly active at the start of our surveillance period. Because we performed serology for each winter season separately, we would not have detected summer illnesses.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 392, "end": 413, "text": "[8, 9, 17-19, 24, 26]", "ref_id":
