Acquired PAP is divided into idiopathic or autoimmune (90 % of the cases) and secondary, associated to exposure conditions (inhalation of silica, cotton, aluminum), infections (P. asteroids, cytomegalovirus), and immune disorders (human immunodeficiency virus infection, posttransplant immunosuppression).",
