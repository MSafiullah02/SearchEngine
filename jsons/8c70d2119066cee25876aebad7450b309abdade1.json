To protect staff and non-infected patients from potential COVID-19 cross-infection, traditional work routines were reviewed and modified in our anaesthesiology department and urgent measures were implemented.

Airway assessment is a risky time for the CA as he can be in close proximity to the patient's airway. In order to keep the patient's and CA's faces apart, we have opted for projecting the airway examination via a mirror placed in front of the patient (Fig 1) . This assessment was the last one to be made for the patient. After completion of the examination, the CA removes their gloves and gown, washes their hands, and uses an alcoholbased hand sanitizer to kill any remaining microorganisms. By following extraordinary measures, the risk of cross-contamination for both staff and non-infected patients could be greatly reduced while continuing to provide high levels of care. Projecting the airway assessment via a mirror placed in front of the patient can be a useful idea to minimizing viral contamination.",
