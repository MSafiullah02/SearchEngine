            "text": "Influenza A virus (IAV) infection causes annual epidemics and recurring pandemics, leading to substantial morbidity and mortality, as well as significant economic losses. IAV belongs to the family Orthomyxoviridae and has a segmented, negative\u2010sense, and single\u2010stranded RNA genome. Although vaccines remain a major means of prevention, a significant amount of time is required to develop and produce an effective vaccine against a new virus strain (Soema, Kompier, Amorij, & Kersten, 2015). Furthermore, vaccines need to be reformulated annually due to the frequent emergence of new viruses (Houser & Subbarao, 2015). Antiviral drugs, on the other hand, are essential for treatment and prophylaxis. However, the error\u2010prone nature of the influenza RNA polymerase, due to its lack of proofreading\u2010repair activity, makes the virus highly susceptible to mutation, resulting in its resistance to antivirals (Watanabe et al., 2014). For example, there has been rapid emergence of IAV strains that are resistant to amantadine and rimantadine, and these antivirals are thus no longer recommended for anti\u2010influenza treatment (Barr et al., 2007; Bright et al., 2005). Resistance against neuraminidase inhibitors, such as oseltamivir and zanamivir as well as newly developed peramivir and laninamivir, has also been reported (Barrett & McKimm\u2010Breschkin, 2014; Hurt et al., 2009; Kamali & Holodniy, 2013; Orozovic, Orozovic, Jarhult, & Olsen, 2014). Therefore, it is increasingly urgent to develop drugs that target host factors rather than viral proteins, which is less likely to cause drug resistance.",

Many host proteins and signalling pathways regulate IAV infection at different stages. Early in 2003, Wurzer et al. (2003) discovered that efficient IAV propagation depends on the activation of host caspase\u20103, a central player in apoptosis, as the presence of a caspase\u20103 inhibitor in cells strongly impairs viral replication. Several studies have shown that IAV stabilises the p53 protein, activates p53 signalling and consequently induces apoptosis in host cells (Nailwal, Sharma, Mayank, & Lal, 2015; Turpin et al., 2005; Zhirnov & Klenk, 2007). Recently, cyclophilin A was found to interact with the IAV M1 protein and thus to impair early viral replication (X. Liu et al., 2012). IAV also interacts with many other cellular pathways, including the NF\u2010\u03baB, PI3K/Akt, MAPK, PKC/PKR, and TLR/RIG\u2010I signalling cascades, to overcome host defences against the virus (Gaur, Munjhal, & Lal, 2011; Ludwig & Planz, 2008; C. Zhang et al., 2014).",

Wang, Stricker, Gou, & Liu, 2007). Several thousand miRNAs have been identified in plants, animals, and viral genomes (Akhtar, Micolucci, Islam, Olivieri, & Procopio, 2016). miRNAs are key modulators in diverse signalling pathways (Zamore & Haley, 2005). Increasing evidence indicates that miRNAs also participate in host\u2013virus interactions and play a pivotal role in the regulation of viral replication. For example, miR\u2010122, a liver\u2010specific miRNA, facilitates viral replication by targeting the 5\u2032\u2010UTR of hepatitis C virus RNA (Thibault et al., 2015). Cellular miR\u201024 and miR\u201093 target the viral large protein (L protein) and phosphoprotein (P protein) genes of vesicular stomatitis virus (Otsuka et al., 2007). In addition, miR\u2010323, miR\u2010491, and miR\u2010654 inhibit replication of H1N1 IAV by binding the PB1 gene (Song, Liu, Gao, Jiang, & Huang, 2010). miRNA can also modulate the type I interferon (IFN) system to combat viral infection. Wang et al. has demonstrated that IFN\u2010induced miR\u2010155 positively regulates the host antiviral innate immune response via type I IFN signalling by targeting suppressor of cytokine signalling 1 (SOCS1; P. Wang et al., 2010).",

The activation of Wnt/\u03b2\u2010catenin with Wnt3a enhances influenza virus replication, whereas the inhibition of the pathway with iCRT14 decreases influenza infection (More et al., 2018). In the present study, we sought to identify miRNAs that regulate IAV replication by modulating the Wnt/\u03b2\u2010catenin pathway. Here, we report the systematic screening of a miRNA expression library and identification of 20 miRNAs that modulate the activity of the Wnt/\u03b2\u2010catenin pathway. Four selected miRNAs that inhibit the pathway, miR\u2010193b, miR\u2010548f\u20101, miR\u20101\u20101, and miR\u2010509\u20101, were found to have anti\u2010IAV activities. miR\u2010193b suppressed IAV replication by targeting \u03b2\u2010catenin.",

Hu et al., 2016; K. Huang et al., 2010). To systematically identify miRNAs that regulate Wnt/\u03b2\u2010catenin signalling, we constructed a miRNA expression library composed of 738 human miRNA precursor expression vectors and performed screening using a TOPflash reporter luciferase assay as a readout for Wnt/\u03b2\u2010catenin signalling activity (Figure 1a). The TOPflash reporter vector contains three copies of T\u2010cell factor (TCF)/lymphoid enhancer\u2010binding factor (LEF) binding sites upstream of the luciferase reporter gene. The initial screening was performed in 96\u2010well plates with three replicates. Human HEK293T cells were transfected with a TOPflash luciferase reporter plasmid, miRNA expression plasmid, and the normalisation vector, pRL\u2010TK vector, for 24 hr and were then stimulated with Wnt3a for 24 hr, followed by the dual luciferase assay. Among 738 miRNAs, 85 miRNAs were found to up\u2010regulate and 20 to down\u2010regulate luciferase activity with a fold change \u22652, resulting in a hit rate of 14.2% (Figure 1a and Table S1).",

We selected approximately equal numbers of up\u2010 and down\u2010regulating miRNAs (up, 24 miRNAs with a greater than or equal to threefold change, and down, 20 miRNAs with a \u22652\u2010fold change, Figure 1b).

TOPFlash and FOPlash firefly luciferase activities, normalised to pRL\u2010TK Renilla luciferase activity, are shown in Figure 1c for the up\u2010regulating miRNAs and Figure 1d for down\u2010regulating miRNAs. A ratio of normalised TOPflash/normalised FOPflash are presented in Figure 1e,f. Using a TOPflash/FOPflash ratio of 1.5 as a cut\u2010off value, we identified 15 and five miRNAs that up\u2010 and down\u2010regulated the Wnt/\u03b2\u2010catenin signalling pathway, respectively.",

Because miR\u2010193b showed greater inhibition of Wnt/\u03b2\u2010catenin signalling than miR\u2010193a, we tested the anti\u2010IAV activities of miR\u2010193b and the other miRNAs. We overexpressed each miRNA in HEK293 cells for 24 hr, infected the cells with A/PR/8/34 at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.01 for 48 hr, and determined viral mRNA and protein expression in infected cells and the titre in the culture medium. The miRNA expression vector contains an enhanced green florescent protein (EGFP) marker, which can be used to monitor the transfection efficiency. EGFP images showed an approximately 75\u201385% transfection efficiency (Figure 2a), and overexpression of miRNAs was confirmed by real\u2010time polymerase chain reaction (PCR; Figure 2b). Western blot analysis showed that overexpression of miR\u2010193b, miR\u2010548f\u20101, miR\u20101\u20101, and miR\u2010509\u20101 in HEK293 cells reduced viral NP protein expression by 73 \u00b1 14%, 42 \u00b1 9%, 61 \u00b1 25%, and 35 \u00b1 19%, respectively, and NS1 protein expression by 98 \u00b1 1%, 61 \u00b1 21, 63 \u00b1 18, and 30 \u00b1 15%, respectively (Figure 2c,d). These miRNAs also reduced the mRNA levels of NP, NS1, and PB1 in cells by 30\u201360% (Figure 2e). Furthermore, progeny virus production in the culture media was suppressed by all of the miRNAs (Figure 2f). Immunostaining of NP revealed that these miRNAs also led to a decrease in IAV\u2010infected cells (Figure 2g). It is noteworthy that miR\u2010509\u20101 inhibited the Wnt/\u03b2\u2010catenin signalling, the second most but merely showed moderate suppression of the IAV infection, suggesting a possible off\u2010target effect of the miRNA. Taken together, the data showed that the miRNAs that down\u2010regulated the Wnt/\u03b2\u2010catenin signalling pathway reduced IAV infection.",

Due to the low transfection efficiency of plasmid into A549 cells, we used a lentivirus to overexpress miR\u2010193b. Lentivirus infection efficiencies under our conditions were nearly 100% as revealed by EGFP images (Figure 3a) although the intensities of GPF varied among cells. The miR\u2010193b level, as determined by real\u2010time PCR, was increased 26\u2010fold over miR\u2010Con in A549 cells (Figure 3b). Cell viability was not affected by lentivirus infection as determined by CellTiter Blue assay (Figure 3c). Overexpression of miR\u2010193b reduced the viral NP and NS1 protein levels in both multiple cycle (Figure 3d,e) and single cycle (Figure 3h,i) of infection. Overexpression of miR\u2010193b also decreased the mRNA levels of NP, NS1, and PB1 by 30% to 43% (Figure 3f) and progeny virus production in the culture medium by more than one log (Figure 3g). These results indicated that the anti\u2010IAV activity of miR\u2010193b was not cell type dependent.",

The IAV luciferase reporter vector contains a firefly luciferase under control of NP 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 UTRs of influenza A/WSN/33, so it is able to respond to IAV. Luciferase reporter activity was detected after reconstitution of the IAV polymerase complex after virus infection. The reporter vector was transfected into HEK293 or A549 cells along with the miR\u2010193b plasmid or miR\u2010con vector. The cells were then infected with A/PR/8/34, A/WSN/33, OK/09 H1N1, and A/Oklahoma/309/2006 H3N2 at the indicated MOIs for 48 hr, followed by the dual luciferase assay. The viruses were chosen because A/PR/8/34 and A/WSN/33 are the most representative laboratory H1N1 strains, whereas OK/09 is a pandemic H1N1 virus, and H3N2 is a virus strain that causes seasonal flu annually and endemic outbreaks. To obtain a proper readout of the luciferase activities, we first optimised the dose of the viruses with MOIs of 0.001, 0.005, 0.01, 0.05, and 0.1. The dose that resulted in a ratio (firefly/renilla) between 10 and 100 was selected (data not shown). The results showed that overexpression of miR\u2010193b inhibited IAV infection of all tested strains by 45\u201373% in HEK293 cells and by 25\u201376% in A549 cells (Figure 4a,b), indicating that the antiviral effect of miR\u2010193b was not strain dependent.",

A549 cells were infected with a sgRNA\u2010lentiCRISPR virus or a control virus, and one clone was chosen from each sgRNA after puromycin selection. The surveyor mutation assay showed that the mutations were generated in both miR\u2010193b knocked\u2010out clones (Figure 5b). DNA sequencing revealed that one base was inserted in the sgRNA1 clone, and two bases were deleted in the sgRNA2 clone (Figure 5c). miR\u2010193b expression was significantly reduced with both clones (Figure 5d), likely due to the disruption of miRNA processing (Chang et al., 2016). When miR\u2010193b\u2010knocked out A549 cells were infected with A/PR/8/34 at an MOI of 0.01 for 48 hr, viral NP protein level was significantly increased in both clones (Figure 5e,f).

Because miR\u2010193b inhibits Wnt/\u03b2\u2010catenin signalling, we narrowed down the target selection to the positive regulators of the signalling. Three positive regulators of the Wnt/\u03b2\u2010catenin signalling pathway, LEF1, CTNNB1, and FZD4, were predicted to contain binding sites for miR\u2010193b. FZD4 encodes frizzled 4 protein, which acts as a receptor for Wnt ligands (H. C. Huang & Klein, 2004). LEF1 and CTNNB1 encode the Wnt pathway transcription factor LEF1 and coactivator \u03b2\u2010catenin, respectively. Accumulation of \u03b2\u2010catenin in the cytoplasm and its eventual translocation into the nucleus act as a transcriptional coactivator of the transcription factor LEF1 (Komiya & Habas, 2008). The potential binding sites between miR\u2010193b and the 3\u2032\u2010UTR of the targets are shown in Figure 6a. To determine whether miR\u2010193b binds these targets, we cloned the 3\u2032\u2010UTRs of these genes into a luciferase reporter and transfected them into HEK293T cells along with the miR\u2010193b expression plasmid. miR\u2010193b reduced the luciferase activities by 35\u201350% of all targets (Figure 6b), suggesting that miR\u2010193b was able to bind the 3\u2032\u2010UTRs of LEF1, CTNNB1, and FZD4.",

The LEF1 and \u03b2\u2010catenin protein levels were reduced by 71 \u00b1 6% and 30 \u00b1 2%, respectively, in miR\u2010193b\u2010overexpressing HEK293 cells.

A number of miRNAs regulate Wnt signalling by modulating Wnt ligands, \u03b2\u2010catenin, transcription factors, and the destruction complex. For example, miR\u201022, \u2010200b, \u2010185, \u201026a, \u2010329, and \u2010410 target Wnt ligands to inhibit the Wnt/\u03b2\u2010catenin signalling pathway (G. Li et al., 2014; Shiah et al., 2014; Tang et al., 2013; Z. Wang, Humphries, Xiao, Jiang, & Yang, 2014; Zhao et al., 2014). The miR\u2010200 cluster targets \u03b2\u2010catenin to inhibit cancer progression (J. Liu et al., 2013; Tian et al., 2014). miR\u2010155 negatively regulates APC in multiple carcinomas, including HCC and papillary thyroid carcinoma (X. Zhang et al., 2013), to promote cell proliferation and tumorigenesis. In the present study, we found that miR\u2010193a/b, miR\u2010548f\u20101, miR\u20101\u20101, and miR\u2010509\u20101 significantly repressed Wnt/\u03b2\u2010catenin signalling.

It is noted that to the extent that a miRNA inhibits Wnt/\u03b2\u2010catenin signalling does not exactly correlate with its anti\u2010influenza virus activities (Figures 1f and 2d). It is likely that, in addition to Wnt/\u03b2\u2010catenin signalling, these miRNAs also target other pathways. Among the down\u2010regulating miRNAs, miR\u2010193b was the most effective suppressor of the Wnt/\u03b2\u2010catenin signalling pathway. miR\u2010193b is considered to be a biomarker of various cancers because it is down\u2010regulated in lung cancer (H. Hu, Li, Liu, & Ni, 2012), hepatocellular carcinoma (Xu et al., 2010), prostate cancer (Rauhala et al., 2010), and melanoma (Chen et al., 2010).

Excluding hepatitis B virus\u2010associated hepatocellular carcinoma (Mao et al., 2014), the role of miR\u2010193b in modulating viral infection has rarely been studied to date. In this study, we found that miR\u2010193b strongly suppressed IAV infection. We further demonstrated that miR\u2010193b inhibited IAV infection by targeting and repressing \u03b2\u2010catenin (Figures 6 and 7).

One important signalling pathway that modulates viral replication is the canonical Wnt/\u03b2\u2010catenin pathway. Two recent genome\u2010wide siRNA screens identified multiple components of the Wnt pathway that interfere with Rift Valley fever virus and flavivirus infection (Harmon et al., 2016; Smith, Jeng, McWeeney, & Hirsch, 2017). Previous studies have also shown that the deletion of Wnt pathway components significantly impacts IAV replication and interferon production (Shapira et al., 2009; Watanabe et al., 2014). \u03b2\u2010Catenin is a part of adherens junctions at the cell membrane and acts as a transcription factor that interacts with LEF/TCF to regulate the Wnt/\u03b2\u2010catenin pathway. Increasing evidence has suggested the importance of \u03b2\u2010catenin in viral replication, but some discrepancies exist. Hillesheim et al. (2014) showed that \u03b2\u2010catenin accumulates in the nucleus after IAV infection and that \u03b2\u2010catenin supports IRF3\u2010dependent transcription of genes responsible for the cellular innate immune response, such as IFN\u2010\u03b2 and ISGs. By contrast, Baril et al. (2013) reported that infection by SeV, another negative\u2010strand RNA virus, induces secretion of Wnt ligands and stabilisation of \u03b2\u2010catenin and decreases expression of IFNB1 via a feedback mechanism. Our study showed that the reduction of \u03b2\u2010catenin by miR\u2010193b indeed hampered IAV replication and that compensating \u03b2\u2010catenin by \u03b2\u2010catenin ectopic expression restored IAV infection (Figure 7). Similarly, Watanabe et al. showed that down\u2010regulation of \u03b2\u2010catenin significantly decreased the relative viral RNA polymerase activity by more than 50% (Watanabe et al., 2014). Although the reasons for the discrepancy in regard to the roles of \u03b2\u2010catenin in the RNA virus\u2010induced interferon response and virus infection are not known, different post\u2010translational modifications of the \u03b2\u2010catenin protein due to the different Wnt stimuli and the different viruses and cell types used might be plausible explanations.",

LEF1 forms a complex with \u03b2\u2010catenin to activate the Wnt/\u03b2\u2010catenin responsive genes. Two reports have shown that whereas overexpressing LEF1 alone does not activate the Wnt/\u03b2\u2010catenin signalling pathway, coexpression of LEF1 and \u03b2\u2010catenin results in 50\u2010 to 100\u2010fold increases in the TOPFlash activity (Ahrens, Romereim, & Dudley, 2011; Ishitani, Matsumoto, Chitnis, & Itoh, 2005). It has also been reported that Drosophila TCF activates gene transcription in the presence of Armadillo, the Drosophila homologue of \u03b2\u2010catenin. However, Drosophila TCF actually functions as a repressor in the absence of Armadillo (Cavallo et al., 1998; de Lau & Clevers, 2001). This may explain why LEF1 overexpression alone even resulted in a decrease of IAV NP protein expression and virus production (Figure 7d\u2013f). Furthermore, \u03b2\u2010catenin has a transactivation domain but not LEF\u20101 (Vleminckx, Kemler, & Hecht, 1999). These studies suggest that LEF1 requires \u03b2\u2010catenin for its transcription activation activity. Because miR\u2010193b reduces the protein levels of both \u03b2\u2010catenin and LEF1, overexpression of LEF1 alone cannot rescue the miR\u2010193b effects on IAV infection.",

Overexpression of miR\u2010193b in the Kasumi\u20101 acute myeloid leukaemia cell line decreases c\u2010Kit expression and inhibits the downstream PDK1/Akt signalling pathway (Gao et al., 2011). miR\u2010193b also targets the urokinase\u2010type plasminogen activator (uPA), an enzyme involved in the degradation of extracellular matrix proteins, resulting in the repression of tumour progression and invasion in human breast cancer (X. F. Li, Yan, & Shao, 2009). Last but not the least, miR\u2010193b induces G1\u2010phase arrest in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma by targeting KRAS, through which the AKT and ERK pathways were modulated (Jin et al., 2015).",

            "text": "A good number of studies suggest that crosstalk occurs between the cell cycle and Wnt signalling. It has been well demonstrated that Wnt/\u03b2\u2010catenin signalling stimulates the G1/S transition and promotes cell cycle progression and therefore proliferation through transcriptional up\u2010regulation of target genes that encode, for example, c\u2010Myc and cyclin D (Niehrs & Acebron, 2012). By contrast, the \u03b2\u2010catenin levels increase during the G1/S transition and peak during G2/M in normal and transformed epithelial cells (Olmeda, Castel, Vilaro, & Cano, 2003). It was recently found that the mitotic CDK14/cyclin Y complex promotes Wnt/\u03b2\u2010catenin signalling through phosphorylation of the LRP6 coreceptor (Davidson & Niehrs, 2010). Cyclin D1 is a major regulator of the progression of cells into the proliferative stage of the cell cycle and is necessary for cells to enter S phase (Baldin, Lukas, Marcote, Pagano, & Draetta, 1993). Down\u2010regulation of cyclin D1 induces G0/G1 arrest (Masamha & Benbrook, 2009; Radu, Neubauer, Akagi, Hanafusa, & Georgescu, 2003). We observed that cyclin D1 is markedly down\u2010regulated in miR\u2010193b\u2010overexpressing cells. This is likely due to the combined effect of a reduced Wnt/\u03b2\u2010catenin signalling activity and a direct repression by miR\u2010193b because cyclin D1 is a well\u2010known down\u2010stream target of Wnt/\u03b2\u2010catenin signalling (Shtutman et al., 1999), and cyclin D1 has been previously shown to be a direct target of miR\u2010193 in cancer cells (Chen et al., 2010).",

            "text": "Based on the observations that miR\u2010193b reduced cyclin D1 protein levels and induced cell cycle G0/G1 arrest, and that miR\u2010193b and cell cycle G0/G1 arrest suppressed viral vRNP nuclear import, we speculate that miR\u2010193b may inhibit vRNP nuclear import by minimising the cell cycle conditions needed for efficient viral nucleoprotein expression and/or transport. The correlation of the cell cycle and viral replication has been reported. For instance, some DNA viruses promote quiescent cells entry into S phase to support viral genome synthesis. By contrast, some large DNA viruses and RNA viruses can arrest cells in a particular phase of the cell cycle that is favourable for replication of a specific virus (Bagga & Bouchard, 2014; Emmett, Dove, Mahoney, Wurm, & Hiscox, 2005). Another mechanism may be related to cellular traffic. For example, Cawood, Harrison, Dove, Reed, and Hiscox (2007) demonstrated that the nucleocapsid protein of Coronavirus is more mobile in proliferative cells and localises to the nucleolus in a cell cycle\u2010dependent manner. The trafficking of viral proteins may depend on the dynamics of the nucleolar proteome in response to the metabolic profile of the cell. It is noted that two studies suggest that cell cycle G0/G1 arrest facilitates IAV infection (He et al., 2010; Jiang et al., 2013).",

We constructed the lentiviral CRISPR/Cas9 mediated miR\u2010193b gene editing vectors by subcloning each annealed sgRNA oligonucleotide pair into the sgRNA scaffold of lentiCRISPR v2 vector (Addgene, #52961) via the BsmII sites. A control vector was constructed by inserting an EGFP sgRNA sequence into the same vector. Lentivirus was prepared by transfecting sgRNA\u2010lentiCRISPR v2 vector and package plasmids pSPAX2 and pMD2G into HEK293T cells using PEI reagent. Stable cell lines were generated by infecting A549 cells with the CRISPR/Cas9 lentivirus containing sgRNA and selected with 1\u2010\u03bcg/ml puromycin.",
