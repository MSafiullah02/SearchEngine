Despite multiple efforts, this infectious burden is still increasing. For example, it has been reported that between 1.5 and 12 million people die each year from waterborne diseases [1, 2] and diarrheal diseases are listed within the top 15 leading causes of death worldwide [3]. Rapid population growth, climate change, natural disasters, immigration, globalization, and the corresponding sanitation and waste management challenges are expected to intensify the problem in the years to come.",

Viruses have been cited as potentially the most important and hazardous pathogens found in wastewater [9] and are included in the EPA contaminant candidate list. Viruses can lead to serious health outcomes, especially for children, the elderly, and immunocompromised individuals, and are of great concern because of their low infectious dose, ability to mutate, inability to be treated by antibiotics, resistance to disinfection, small size that facilitates environmental transport, and high survivability in water and solids.",

Traditional disease detection and management systems are based on diagnostic analyses of clinical samples.

Classic epidemiology observes disease outbreaks based on clinical symptoms and infection status but does not have the ability to predict \u201ccritical locations\u201d and \u201ccritical moments\u201d for viral disease onset. Recent research efforts in developing optimized detection systems focus on rapid methods for analyzing blood samples, but this approach assumes that patients are examined at a clinical setting after the outbreak has been established and recognized.",

The approach was first theorized in 2001 [10] and first implemented and reported for several illicit drugs in 2005 where the method was termed sewage epidemiology [11]. The methodology considers raw untreated wastewater as a reservoir of human excretion products; among these products are the parent compounds and metabolites of illicit drugs. If these excretion products are stable in wastewater as they travel through the sewage system, then the measured concentration from a wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) could correspond to the amount excreted by the serviced population. Table 5.1 presents a summary of prior studies utilizing the wastewater-based epidemiology methods to assess levels of various substances in a population.",

They are one of the more significant gastroenteritis-causing viral agents, considered to be a leading cause of the disease [79\u201381], and are commonly associated with disease outbreaks [19, 82, 83]. Noroviruses are one of the more commonly investigated and detected viruses in wastewater [24\u201326, 28\u201330, 32, 33, 36, 59, 60, 84, 85]. A number of studies have also investigated the presence of noroviruses in human feces [43, 47, 53, 54, 79, 86\u201388]. One such cited study reported quantification values for norovirus in stool following qPCR, in the range of 9.7\u2217105 to 1.1\u22171012 copies per gram, with a mean value of approximately 1011 copies per gram [87].",

Sapovirus, like norovirus, is a member of the Caliciviridae family and like its relative is a common cause of gastroenteritis [98]. Polyomaviruses are associated with a variety of diseases in humans, including nephropathy, progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, and Mercel cell carcinoma [99].

Additionally, localized sampling can be performed in specific neighborhoods where access points are available.

Watershed modeling would therefore become an integral component of the wastewater-based epidemiology methodology for rural locations. In a study performed by Xagoraraki\u2019s research group, preliminary investigation into the wastewater epidemiology methodology was conducted [132]. Samples were collected from a wastewater treatment plant and surrounding surface waters in Kampala, Uganda. Three sampling events were conducted in 2-week intervals. Four human viruses (adenovirus, enterovirus, hepatitis A virus, and rotavirus) were quantified at each sampling location via qPCR. Concentrations of each virus at each location from each sampling event were compared to one another to determine if significant differences could be observed from one sampling event to the next.

Xagoraraki\u2019s research group\u2019s studies have used metagenomic methods to identify human viruses of potential concern in wastewater. The first of these studies, conducted with samples from both Michigan and France, detected a comparatively high number of metagenomic hits for human herpesviruses and also detected human parvovirus and human polyomavirus in wastewater effluents [37]. Their other study, conducted in Uganda, detected human astroviruses, papillomaviruses, as well as a BLAST (Basic Local Alignment Search Tool) hit for Ebola virus [132]. While more research is still required to attain more robust genomic information and comparison databases, metagenomic methods can still be a useful tool for the identification of potential viruses that can then be monitored with qPCR methods.

Governmental census information has been found to underestimate the population of a community compared to estimation using biomarkers [140], and certain substances detected in wastewater have been shown to correlate with census data [141]. Several substances have been proposed and investigated as population biomarkers (Table 5.4), including creatinine [142], cholesterol, coprostanol [143], nicotine [144], cortisol, androstenedione, and the serotonin metabolite 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) [145]. Nutrients such as nitrogen, phosphorus, and oxygen [12], as well as ammonium [146], have also been proposed as population biomarkers, but these may more adequately reflect human activity and industry footprint rather than population [145, 147, 148].",

For example, mean concentration values of adenoviruses in excrement ranged from 104 to 106 depending on the study and whether the virus is excreted in stool or urine, indicating a wide data variance [39, 41]. Many factors can impact the shedding rate of viruses in excrement, including viremia (the presence of the virus in the bloodstream) [40, 87, 151].

The kinetic decay rate of a virus would thereby be primarily dependent not only on the characteristics of the individual virus but also environmental conditions within the sewage system, which could vary from location to location. Moreover, the fate of viruses may be different between wastewater systems in urban areas which typically use enclosed underground sewer pipes and rural areas which may utilize septic tanks, catchments, and the open environment.

Early detection is critical for effective management and prevention of outbreaks. Recent research efforts in developing optimized detection systems often focus on rapid methods for analyzing blood or excrement samples; however, these approaches require that individuals are examined in clinical settings, typically after an outbreak has been established. Wastewater-based epidemiology is a promising methodology for early detection of viral outbreaks at a population level. Analyzing wastewater is equivalent to obtaining and analyzing a community excrement sample. In the determination of whether an outbreak is imminent or already in progress, quantifying viral concentration in raw wastewater is a crucial first step in this process. Waterborne viruses appear to be prime candidates, as they are detectable and quantifiable in both wastewater and human excrement. Non-waterborne viruses have been shown to be detected in human excrement, and some have been reported to be detected in wastewater. Wastewater-based epidemiology therefore has the potential to expand beyond waterborne viruses.",

In addition, carefully designed spatial sampling of wastewater will allow detection of locations where an outbreak may begin to develop and spread (critical locations for the onset of an outbreak). Considerations in sampling locations must be taken with regard to the area of investigation, as urban and rural areas may have differences in the respective wastewater systems that can affect viral transport in the water environment. Moreover, to obtain an accurate estimation of disease cases in a population, other factors must be considered such as viral shedding rates, environmental transport and degradation rates, and correlation with reported clinical disease data. Ultimately, there is great opportunity for the use of wastewater-based epidemiology to investigate viral outbreaks within a community. Comprehensive application of the various factors discussed above is crucial for the full potential of this methodology to be realized. Further research could clarify many of these issues and allow for the full development and application of this new epidemiological technique for studying, identifying, and predicting viral outbreaks.",
