Third, only transient positive results in amniocentesis have been reported for pregnant women infected with Zika virus, another RNA virus.5 Finally, the virus might have been undetectable in amniotic fluid because of insufficient gestational age\u2014the best time for amniocentesis is after 18\u201321 weeks' gestation.6\n",
