Our results emphasize the importance of diminishing the inter-group infections in the effort of substantial flattening and delaying of the epi(demiologic) curve with concomitant mitigation of disastrous economy and social consequences. To exemplify with a limiting case, splitting a population into m (say, 5 or 10) noninteracting groups while keeping intra-group interaction unchanged yields a stretched epidemiologic curve having the maximum number of daily infections reduced and postponed in time by the same factor m (5 or 10). More generally, our study suggests a practical approach to fight against SARS-CoV-2 virus spread based on population splitting into groups and minimizing intermingling between them. This strategy 1 can be pursued by large-scale infrastructure reorganization of activity at different levels in big logistic units (e.g., large productive networks, factories, enterprises, warehouses, schools, (seasonal) harvest work). Importantly, unlike total lockdwon strategy, the proposed approach prevents economic ruin and keeps social life at a more bearable level than distancing everyone from anyone.",

Still, politics cannot push strict restrictions indefinitely, and \"how much is too much?\" is a question of time which unavoidably arises sooner or later. Fighting COVID-19 should not ruin economy. 2 This is certainly what a draconian lockdown across the world over months would do. Parenthetically, catastrophic economic consequences inherently make healthcare system itself also collapsing.",

Therefore, to better emphasize this idea, instead of a SIR-based approach (which would pose no special problem), in this paper we prefer to adopt the simpler logistic growth framework. The logistic model is particularly appealing in view of its simplicity and versatility demonstrated in approaching a broad variety of real systems with very different nature, [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] including population dynamics of epidemic states.

The parenthesis entering the right hand side of equation (5), which acts as Darwin's \"struggle for existence\" and suppresses the exponential growth, is similar to the Pauli blocking factor extensively discussed in electron transport theory. 36 Figure 1 : Logistic growth is characterized by a cumulative number of infected cases n(t) following an S-shaped (sigmoid) curve (panel a) exhibiting an acceleration stage (close to a J-shaped exponential growth), which switches to a deceleration stage beyond the half-time T 50 and attains p(= 95, 99, see equation (12)) percent of the plateau value N.
