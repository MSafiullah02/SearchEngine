Europe currently carries most of the global asbestos-related disease burden due to heavy asbestos use during earlier decades [2]. A peak in MPM incidence is expected in the 2020s due to the long disease latency, although most countries have already banned asbestos use [1,3,4,5]. In contrast, countries that still employ asbestos are very likely to display a substantial burden of asbestos-related disease and MPM nowadays and in the future. ",

BAP1 is a protein involved in DNA repair mechanisms, cell cycle control, apoptosis, and carcinogenesis [7,8,9,10,11,12,13]. BAP1 mutational status is clearly associated with the insurgence of MPM [9,10,12,13,14,15], the response to chemotherapy [16], patient survival [17], and, when coupled to other DNA repair gene alterations, it has suggested synthetic lethality therapeutic approaches [18,19]. MPM is frequently diagnosed at a late stage due to the lack of early symptomatology, reliable biomarkers, and screening tools. Current therapies in clinical practice consist of surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy. We recently reviewed all current and innovative therapeutic approaches and most relevant clinical trial results [20]. Such a detailed survey revealed that new therapeutic modalities and prognostic biomarkers are urgently needed in order to grant a fair chance of survival to all MPM patients. In this review, we examine the current unmet clinical needs in MPM, concentrating on immunotherapy dilemmas, highlighting the main emerging experimental therapies and clinical evidence, and, above all, exploring and analyzing the approaches that can be used to identify new fully human MPM-targeting antibodies for future therapies. To our knowledge, no other review has tackled the issue of targeting MPM from the same angle and perspective, providing useful suggestions regarding novel technologies to achieve this goal.",

IC inhibitors (ICIs), i.e., antibodies targeting CTLA-4, PD-1, or PD-L1, are used as immunomodulatory agents to interfere with the CTLA-4:B7-1/2 or PD-1:PD-L1 axes and to help to overcome tumor-immune escape [24,25,26] with very different efficacy.

PD-L1 is expressed by a substantial proportion of biphasic and sarcomatoid MPM cases, and its positivity above 1% is associated with a significant 10-months reduction in median OS compared to PD-L1 negative tumors [28,29]. Similarly, high PD-L1 expression (>50%) in epithelioid MPM patients correlates with shorter PFS (6.7 vs. 9.9 months) [28]. Despite its prognostic value [30,31,32], PD-L1 expression is not a valid predictive marker of response to anti-PD-L1 therapies for several tumor types [33,34], including MPM [35]. Anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapies were tested in different trials as second or third-line treatment in MPM patients [36,37,38,39,40,41,42,43], but, to date, only nivolumab has obtained regulatory approval in chemo-refractory mesothelioma patients in Japan [44]. At present, the pembrolizumab plus platinum/pemetrexed-based chemotherapy (PPC) combination as first-line treatment, in comparison to pembrolizumab or PPC alone, is being evaluated in the phase III trial NCT0278417, while nivolumab is being investigated in the randomized phase III trial CONFIRM (NCT03063450) in comparison with placebo [41]. The activity of durvalumab, a PD-L1 inhibitor, in combination with first-line PPC, was tested in the DREAM study (ANZ clinical trial registry number: ACTRN12616001170415). This treatment resulted in an objective response rate (ORR) of 61% using mRECIST and 53% using iRECIST criteria and in progression-free survival at 6 months of 71% (mRECIST). On the basis of these observations, a randomized phase 3 trial will be started [45]. ",

CAR-T-cells directed against mesothelin (MSLN), a glycoprotein expressed on MPM and other solid tumor cells, with a limited presence on normal tissues [51], represent a promising therapeutic option and many efforts have been made to improve their clinical efficacy and safety profile [52,53]. Recently, Adusumilli and colleagues reported the outcome of a phase I clinical trial, NCT02414269, [54,55] on patients with MPM and pleural metastases from lung or breast cancer treated with anti-MSLN CAR-T-cells. Of note, the inclusion of anti-PD-1 therapy was essential to elicit clinical efficacy and to avoid T-cell exhaustion since no patient had an objective response before pembrolizumab addition, showing the importance of also modulating the immune suppressive features of the tumor microenvironment (TME) in this therapeutic setting. The pembrolizumab plus anti-MSLN CAR-T-cell combination results in the best clinical outcome with an ORR of 63% (10/16) and a disease control rate of 75% (12/16). No evidence of on-target, off-tumor, or therapy-related toxicities higher than grade 1 was observed. Although applied to a limited number of patients so far, CAR-T therapies against MPM have shown impressive results, highlighting the difference in efficacy for advanced cell therapies compared to small molecule drugs or antibodies. Recently, a comprehensive review of immunotherapy in MPM has been published [56]. However, it is evident that the limited availability of therapeutically targetable antigens hinders the effectiveness of these strategies in MPM patients and this issue will need to be addressed in the future.",

            "text": "The efficacy of ICIs in MPM patients highlights the presence and the activity of immune cells in situ able to fight cancer if properly unleashed. However, to achieve this goal, TME must be modified in order to abolish/interfere with specific immune-suppressive cues. Interestingly, Barsky and colleagues recently reported a case of a man with MPM treated with a combination of palliative radiation and immune-gene therapy (GM-CSF) [57]. The outcome of this treatment combination was outstanding, resulting in a so-called \u201cabscopal effect\u201d. In oncology, the abscopal effect is a phenomenon by which localized radiation induces an anti-tumor response at distant sites. RT can trigger an immunogenic cell death (ICD) [58,59] and can stimulate antigen-specific, adaptive immunity [60]. ICD leads to subsequent anti-tumor immune responses, including the release of tumor antigens by irradiated tumor cells, the cross-presentation of tumor-derived antigens to T-cells by antigen-presenting cells (APCs), and the migration of effector T-cells from the lymph nodes to distant tumor sites suggesting that irradiated tumors can act as an in situ vaccine if appropriate conditions are in place [61,62,63]. The overall incidence of the abscopal effect of RT alone is low, with 46 clinical cases reported from 1969 [63]. Those statistics may be explained by the insufficiency of RT alone to overcome the immunoresistance of malignant tumors. Given that immunotherapy can reduce host immune tolerance towards tumors, it is possible that the combination of RT and immunotherapy can amplify the anti-tumor immune response, a hypothesis currently under investigation within the phase I trial, NCT02959463, in which adjuvant pembrolizumab after RT in lung-intact MPM patients is under evaluation. In a murine model of MPM, the abscopal effect can be induced by local RT and enhanced by immune-suppressive CTLA-4 blockade as infiltrated T-cells, both in primary and secondary tumor sites, are predominantly composed by anti-tumor cytotoxic CD8+ T-cells, while immunosuppressive regulatory T-cell (Tregs) are reduced [64]. Those observations corroborate the idea that systemic tumor response can be induced or unleashed by modifying the TME features locally.",

TLSs are also found in the stroma at the invasive margin and/or core of different tumor types [68,69]. TLSs are composed of a T-cell-rich zone harboring mature DCs juxtaposed to a B-cell follicle with GC characteristics surrounded by plasma cells (PCs). TLSs are privileged sites for local presentation of neighboring tumor antigens to T-cells by DCs and activation, proliferation, and differentiation of T and B-cells, resulting in the generation of effector memory T helper (TH) cells and effector memory cytotoxic cells, MBCs, and antibody-producing PCs [70,71,72,73,74,75]. TLS density is associated with higher numbers of CD8+ and CD4+ T-cells in tumors [76], and evidence indicates that TLSs play a major role in controlling tumor invasion and metastasis. A positive impact of TLS density on OS and disease-free survival in lung cancer [71,76,77,78], colorectal cancer [79,80], pancreatic cancer [81,82], oral squamous cell carcinoma [83], and invasive breast cancer [70,84,85,86] has been documented. Importantly, its prognostic value is independent of tumor\u2013node\u2013metastasis (TNM) staging in most malignancies, suggesting TLS can induce a systemic, long-lasting anti-tumor response. High endothelial venules (HEVs) similar to those that allow entry of lymphocytes into SLOs are usually detected near TLSs [70]. In this context, HEVs allow lymphocytes to enter into tumors. Therefore, therapies enhancing this feature would be beneficial to improve anti-tumor immune responses. Tregs negatively affect HEV formation, and their depletion in murine models of cancer lead to increased T-cell infiltration and activation, and to the eradication of the disease [87,88]. Tregs and other immune-suppressive cell types, such as myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), regulatory B-cell (Bregs), and soluble factors like TGFb and IL-10, contribute to the development of an immune-suppressive TME. Tumor-resident Tregs co-express high levels of CTLA-4, OX-40, and GITR compared to effector T-cells, and in murine models of mesothelioma, the combination of anti-OX-40 and anti-CTLA-4 has a synergistic effect and results into a 20% to 80% increase in tumor regression as compared to single-antibody treatment [89]. Coherently with this picture, the combination of anti-angiogenic drugs with anti-PD-L1 therapies increases HEV and TLS formation in murine models of breast cancer and neuroendocrine pancreatic tumors [90], supporting the idea that a powerful anti-tumor systemic response by ICIs is sustained, if not triggered, by the presence of TLSs in situ. TLS heterogeneity among human cancers, analyzed via a pan-cancer gene expression analysis of TME cellular composition on The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data and MPM, as well as lung adenocarcinoma and lung squamous cell carcinoma, displays a high expression of a 12-chemokine gene signature associated with TLS composition [91], hinting at a frequent, but also heterogeneous, presence of TLSs [92].",

Additionally, the presence of CD38+ CD138+ PCs around the follicle is highly suggestive of antibody production in situ [98]. Indeed, micro-dissected follicles subjected to BCR repertoire analysis revealed clonal amplification compared to peripheral B-cells, suggesting a local antigen-driven B-cell response to several malignancies [93,97,99,100,101,102]. Additionally, PCs isolated from dense aggregates in tumor stroma [98], produce anti-tumor antibodies of the immunoglobulin G (IgG) isotype in vivo, whose mechanism of action has not been yet determined. One possibility is that anti-tumor IgGs produce locally increase antigen presentation by DCs and/or directly promote the activity of specific subsets of CD4+ T-cells endowed with Fc\u03b3 receptors (Fc\u03b3Rs) [25]. In favor of this scenario is the presence of IgG deposits in TLS, the spatial organization of TLSs that may favor DC priming by locally produced IgGs, and the observation that tumor-derived immune complexes increase the expression of the co-stimulatory molecule CD86 on DCs in vivo [93]. In favor of the latter are the results of a meta-analysis in a large set of human cancers showing that the prognostic effect of T-cells is generally stronger when tumor-infiltrating B-cells or PCs are present, highlighting the importance of the coordination between cellular and humoral adaptive immune responses [103].

Frequency data from RNA-Seq datasets can inform on tumor heterogeneity and guide patient stratification. In lung cancer patients, for example, the abundance of alternative splicing variants correlates with the longest OS [113], suggesting that variants can be displayed and targeted by adaptive immunity. Altered sequences generated by improper splicing or mutations can be expressed and used to generate human antibodies specific to these moieties. A convenient strategy to generate human antibody fragments (Fabs and scFvs) against specific antigens or cells is phage display (reviewed in [114]). The importance of phage display technology was restated in 2018 by the award of Nobel Prize in Chemistry to George P. Smith and Sir Gregory P. Winter \u201dfor the phage display of peptides and antibodies\u201d. Phage display has allowed the production of clinically relevant antibodies (reviewed in [115]) via the classical approach that relies on the incubation of antibody-displaying phages with an antigen (biopanning), either produced as a purified protein immobilized on a solid substrate or expressed on a host cell surface for consecutive rounds of phage library and antigen exposure to progressively decrease antibody library complexity in favor of specificity (see Figure 1). While the first approach is straightforward and usually employs proteins expressed in bacteria or mammalian cells to recapitulate potential post-translational modifications, the latter allows the expression of the antigen in its physiological context, e.g., on cell membrane, at the cost of increased complexity of screening setup. Classically, single bacterial clones are selected and grown to produce antibodies or phages displaying specific antibodies and test their binding to the target of interest individually. ",

In this study, 95 mesothelioma-targeting scFvs were identified, and 21 candidates were further characterized by FACS, IHC, and for their in vitro internalization capacity on mesothelioma cells with the goal to deliver conjugated anti-tumor drugs directly inside tumor cells [117]. Further analyses identified MCAM/CD146, a surface transmembrane glycoprotein with adhesion functions that belongs to the immunoglobulin superfamily, as one of the antigens. CD146 had been previously described as a marker for advanced melanoma [118] and other tumors [119,120]; it is expressed by all mesothelioma histotypes and by a limited spectrum of normal human adult tissues, among that some vascular endothelial and smooth muscle cells [121]. Currently, the utility of MCAM/CD146 detection in pleural effusion fluid and peripheral blood samples is being investigated as a diagnostic and prognostic marker for MPM [122]. The generation of a phage antibody-display library from the entire antibody genes repertoire of a cancer patient has also been attempted. Rare cancer-targeting antibodies have been identified by this strategy [123]. However, the immunodominance phenomenon typical of certain cancers [114,124,125] has hindered a wider use of this strategy in early attempts.",

Several models have been generated over the past 25 years by different engineering strategies (reviewed in [126]). These transgenic animals can be vaccinated with human antigens, and single B-cell clones or derived hybridomas can be screened for the production of targeting antibodies via ELISA or flow cytometry-based assays. Companies like TRIANNI Inc., Kymab Limited [127], and Creative Biolabs [128] developed proprietary animal models to pursue this strategy. These platforms feed internal pipelines with novel biologics and are available to academic and private institutions in a pay-for-service modality or through the licensing of animals. Advantages include generation in vivo of high affinity, matured IgG antibodies (preferred format for therapy) bypassing additional affinity maturation steps typically used in phage display, high efficiency of the system and low hands-on-time required, ease of automation and throughput of screening. However, this strategy is not suited to raise antibodies against antigens extremely conserved between human and mouse since the murine immune system counter selects self-antigens to prevent the generation of autoantibodies. Human synthetic antibody phage display libraries, on the contrary, can be used to raise antibodies against any moiety at the cost of longer subsequent optimization steps. Both technologies have contributed to the generation of clinically relevant antibodies in several fields [129]. ",

            "text": "Bulk RNA-Seq data from tumor tissue contain a hitherto overlooked picture of a tumor and its ecosystem. Typically, this data is used to evaluate the expression of known transcripts, while de novo formed sequences, like those generated by T- and B-cells in the assembly and generation of their specific receptors, are usually discarded since they cannot be easily matched with the reference transcriptome. However, these sequences can be retrieved from raw data and employed to extract the sequence of TCRs and BCRs from tumor tissue infiltrated immune cells using specific bioinformatic tools. One of them is MiXCR [130], a universal tool that takes raw sequencing data, including RNA-Seq, as input and profiles TCR and BCR repertoires. As a reference, it uses a built-in library of V, D, J, and C gene sequences from human or mouse. As an output, it provides a list of clonotypes derived by assembling identical and homologous reads, corrected for sequencing errors. V\u2019DJer is another framework that can be applied to RNA-Seq data for this purpose [131]. It can be run on BCR light and heavy chain data and employs unmapped paired-end short reads aligning them against a reference transcriptome. Then, V\u2019DJer detects VDJ rearrangements, generates contigs, and quantifies the ones that represent the most abundant portions of the BCR repertoire. When the expression levels of BCR are low, there is an option to increase the sensitivity of the algorithm at the cost of increasing the demand for computational resources. V\u2019DJer has been used, for example, to retrieve antibodies from RNA sequencing data of melanoma patients from TCGA repository [131,132]. At present, TCGA contains expression analyses of 87 MPM patients (TCGA-MESO) that could be used for this purpose. In addition, RNA can be obtained from FFPE samples specifically showing TLSs by IHC in prospective and retrospective cohorts of patients. It is possible to infer the sequence of resident B-cell clones by applying bioinformatic tools to RNA-Seq or by sequencing amplicons for immunoglobulin chains using specific sets of degenerate universal primers from whole tissue DNA or RNA/cDNA. The latter approach is implemented by the immunoSEQ platform (Adaptive Biotechnologies, Seattle, WA). In contrast to profiling using bulk RNA-Seq data, it is more precise since the experimental design is optimized to identify the BCR repertoire through the ImmunoSeq Analyzer software, specifically for this data. Its starting material can be both genomic DNA (gDNA) and cDNA: in order to assess the clonal expansion of B-cells in tissues, gDNA is the best solution since each cell contains the same copy number, while mRNA transcripts can be very different among cells, depending on cellular activation and even the retrotranscription procedure can add other confounding factors. However, cDNA is a better starting material when the goal is to study different antibody abundance since there is a difference in the mRNA expression between activated and naive B-cells. Finally, independently of the method employed for their derivation, identified immunoglobulin heavy and light chain sequences can be further used to build and produce candidate antibodies to test their ability to bind to MPM target cells.

            "text": "Therefore, the immune system of elite responders can be mined to isolate MBCs producing targeting antibodies. MBCs derive mostly from affinity matured and somatic hypermutated B-cells from the germinal centers [133] and constitute a reservoir of high-affinity antibody producers. These features make the MBC pool very attractive so that companies invest in the design of screening platforms to exploit it. For example, Oncoresponse, a company that developed a proprietary, clinically validated human-antibody discovery platform in partnership with MD Anderson Cancer Center, follows this paradigm and aims to identify therapeutically relevant antibodies from patients showing elite response against cancer after immunotherapy. MBCs are easily accessible from the peripheral blood of donors and are suitable for viral immortalization to generate lymphoblastoid cultures for high throughput screens. MBC immortalization involves the infection and transformation of peripheral MBCs by Epstein Barr Virus (EBV) [134] or by BCL-6 / BCL-XL expressing vectors [135] and generates cells that express BCR on the membrane and release their antibody into culture medium at the same time. BCR presence is exploited to isolate cells binding to labeled soluble antigens by cell sorting [135] so that subsequently immunoglobulin sequences from isolated cells can be cloned into expression vectors for large-scale antibody production. Companies like Humabs and AIMM therapeutics exploit those strategies to raise antibodies against specific targets. However, the same technology can be used to isolate targeting antibodies in an antigen-unbiased manner, as shown for melanoma via cell-based screenings of EBV immortalized B-cells [136]. Additionally, human plasmablasts and MBCs can also be cultured for a limited time using specific cytokines [136,137,138,139,140,141]. Importantly, these approaches do not rely on prior knowledge of a specific target. Instead, target identification is postponed, initially drawing on the demonstration of efficacy and specificity towards MPM cancer cells. MBCs receptor repertoire can also be obtained by RNA-Seq from peripheral blood or draining lymph node purified MBCs mining for de novo formed or highly enriched variants after treatment in elite responders [142]. The advantages and drawbacks of the different screening strategies for fully human antibody selection are summarized in Table 1.",

The necessity of discovering novel antigens and ways to target them to cope with tumor heterogeneity and to provide more effective combined treatments for patients is now clear, and future therapies cannot disregard it. The most innovative screening technologies for the generation of fully human antibodies are in place and combine elements from fields of science that started far apart and came together to serve the purpose. These include protein engineering, next-generation sequencing (NGS), virology, cell biology, and genetic modeling of animals, providing an opportunity to find novel and unknown therapeutic targets for MPM and cancer in general.
