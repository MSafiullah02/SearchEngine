The contemporary disease is spreading exponentially around the world, and the pandemic has been felt in at least 185 countries reporting 1,844,863 confirmed cases with 117,021 deaths as at 14th April 2020 (WHO, 2020a, WHO, 2020b). In this time of the global pandemic, fifty-two (52) African countries have reported one or more confirmed cases of COVID 19 with only Comoros and Lesotho presently with no single confirmed case. As a result of changing medical data, Africa at the time of writing has recorded 10,787 confirmed cases, with 501 deaths. Algeria is the most hardly hit nation with 1983 confirmed cases and 313 deaths, although lesser confirmed cases compared to South Africa (2272) with 27 deaths (WHO, 2020a, WHO, 2020b). In other regions of the world, the United States of America (USA) with 553, 822 confirmed cases and 21,972 deaths remain the hardest-hit nation in America (North and South) and around the world. China, with 83,696 confirmed cases and 3351 deaths, is the hardest hit Asian country. In Europe, Italy, with 159,516 confirmed cases and 20,465 deaths although relatively less compared to confirmed cases in Spain with 169,496 with 17,489 deaths remains the hardest hit because of their superior coronavirus reported death cases. In the middle east region, Iran, with 73,303 confirmed cases and 4585 deaths is the worst-hit nation.",

However, outliers in the human-to-human transmission could be as a result of clusters that are yet to be explored. By advancing arguments for clusters of the novel coronavirus in Africa, we provided a social dimension to abating the spread of coronavirus diseases. Africa is predominantly famous for overcrowding their megacities like Pretoria, Lagos, Johannesburg, Cairo and Nairobi. Clustering by people either in public gatherings or residential facilities makes them endangered species. Even if social distancing is enforced in the public domain to prevent human-to-human transmission, it may be difficult if not impossible to enforce in an already overcrowded shared resident. By advancing arguments for inevitable human clustering at various residential or sub-groups in Africa, the study provides an econometric analysis of the social dimensions of the spread of coronavirus diseases in Africa. Apparently, this study leads the debate on spatial density and statistical credence of how confirmed cases is statistically related to attributable deaths from coronavirus diseases in Africa. We build upon the work of Sarkodie and Owusu (2020) to examine the phenomenological influence of outliers in the human-human transmission in Africa. The intricacies of these unobserved factors in abating human-to-human transmission of coronavirus disease in Africa underpin this study. We rely on publicly available data for Africa countries confirmed and death cases. We use a novel estimation method capable of accounting for cross-sectional dependence. We found a basis for the strict orthogonal relationship among the variable and accounted for unobserved heterogeneity of the human-to-human transmission.",

Although the lagged factors control for simultaneity bias, we cannot completely rule out the devastating influence of historical information leading to COVID-19 deaths. Types of shared residents, proximity to health care facilities, choice of healthcare utilisation in the time of illness and most importantly during this global pandemic, existing health conditions, as well as the devastating influence of COVID-19 attributable deaths to friends and family in terms of depression, frontline health workers who are saddled with the care and post-death management of patients, are magnanimous in this global pandemic era. In other climes, the number of confirmed cases is positive and statistically significant at 5%, implying 0.0453 percentage increase in COVID-19 attributable deaths in Africa. By way of intuition, a proportionate rise in confirmed cases is attributable to potential deaths by ~0.045.

Dynamic panel data estimates are known to suffer from problems of unobserved heterogeneity, dynamic endogeneity and simultaneity bias (Baltagi et al., 2015). System GMM, known explicitly for heteroscedasticity and non-normality assumptions unlike the least squares estimates, assumes linearity and uncorrelated error terms. Our first-order and second-order difference results in favour of the rejection of the null hypothesis in the first-order serial correlation examination and acceptance of the null hypothesis for the second-order serial correlation test. Blundell and Bond (2000) argued that the system GMM estimators requires the presence of first-order serial correlation and not the second-order serial correlation in the residual term. The result of Table II confirms that we obtained appropriate diagnostics. z = \u2212 2.42; p < 0.05 at 5% level of significance in the first order serial coreelation analysis and then no second order serial correlation based on calculated z that is not statistically significant at 5% (z = \u2212 0.96; \np > 0.05). The Hansen (1982) J-statistics test result confirmed the model has valid instruments since we fail to reject the null of overidentifying restriction at a 5% level of significance (p > 0.05; \ni. e p = 0.532).

We presented spatial and statistical evidence based on the situation reports from the World Health Organisation (WHO). We advise the public on the cautious interpretations of our statistical model, which rely on phenomenological models as in most social sciences research and not a clinical procedure that has a confidence interval of 99%. We found Algeria to be the most hardly hit African nation (at the time of writing) by the rampaging virus (estimated in terms of the number of deaths recorded), and also we establish a linear relationship between the number of confirmed cases and the number of attributable deaths. Our findings corroborate the finding of Sarkodie and Owusu (2020) in one of their strings of findings. The study is limited to facts obtainable at the present time of this global pandemic.",
