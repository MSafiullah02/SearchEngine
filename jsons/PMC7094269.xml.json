Mycobacteria can be divided into three groups based on the disease they cause: Mycobacterium leprae and Mycobacterium lepromatosis cause leprosy in man. The Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTC) is formed from species that cause tuberculosis in man and animals, such as M. tuberculosis, Mycobacterium bovis and Mycobacterium microti. In human medicine the word \u2018tuberculosis\u2019 is reserved for infections caused by the MTC species (Esteban and Mu\u00f1os-Egea, 2016). The rest of the mycobacterial species are grouped as non-tuberculous mycobacteria (NTM), which are mostly opportunistic environmental pathogens (Koh, 2017). Most mycobacteria have a particular host preference, but some can cause infections in other species, including man (Quinn et al., 2011).",

NTM infections affect both immunocompromised and immunocompetent patients (Koh, 2017) and the incidence of NTM isolates in human samples has been rising (Shah et al., 2016). Infections in people are classified into four distinct clinical syndromes: chronic pulmonary disease, lymphadenitis, cutaneous disease and disseminated disease (Koh, 2017). In animals MAC species are generally considered to be the most important NTM (Quinn et al., 2011) and these include M. avium, causing avian tuberculosis, and M. avium subspecies paratuberculosis, causing paratuberculosis or Johne's disease. Other NTM species are described to cause mostly sporadic, non-specific infections in several species (Thirunavukkarasu et al., 2017).",

            "text": "Tuberculosis in cats usually presents as a localized cutaneous disease or, less commonly, as a disseminated or systemic respiratory or alimentary disease (Gunn-Moore et al., 2011a, Gunn-Moore, 2014, Pesciaroli et al., 2014). NTM infections cause mostly cutaneous or subcutaneous nodules or granulomatous panniculitis with variable lymph node involvement (Gunn-Moore et al., 2011a, Gunn-Moore, 2014). The \u2018feline leprosy syndrome\u2019, a leprosy-like ulcerative and nodular skin disease especially affecting the head and limbs (Gunn-Moore, 2014), is also part of the NTM group of infections. Of the NTM species, a few cases of disseminated or systemic disease have been reported with M. avium (Morfitt et al., 1989, Barry et al., 2002, Griffin et al., 2003, Knippel et al., 2004, Baral et al., 2006, De Groot et al., 2010, Rivi\u00e8re et al., 2011), two cases with Mycobacterium xenopi (MacWilliams et al., 1998, Meeks et al., 2008) and single cases with Mycobacterium heckeshornense (Elze et al., 2013), Mycobacterium simiae (Dietrich et al., 2003) and Mycobacterium kansasii (Lee et al., 2017). Despite the reported cases, systemic mycobacteriosis caused by NTM species is still considered relatively rare, especially outside the MAC species (Lloret et al., 2013, Gunn-Moore, 2014, Mauldin and Peters-Kennedy, 2016).",

An idiopathic CD4+ (cluster of differentiation) T-cell lymphopenia was suspected to be the cause of a M. xenopi infection (Meeks et al., 2008) and local surgery may have caused fulmination of another M. xenopi infection (MacWilliams et al., 1998). FIV infection was described with M. heckeshornense infection (Elze et al., 2013). No apparent immunocompromising factors were noted in the history or macroscopical or histological findings in the present cases.

Lymph nodes and spleen were affected in all cases, while only cats A and C had gross changes in the liver and lungs. The presence of necrosis also varied between the cases. M. malmoense is phylogenetically closer to M. avium than to M. branderi/shimodei (Schrenzel, 2012), which could in part account for the different gross findings. However, no morphological differences are reported between different mycobacterial infections (Gunn-Moore et al., 2011a) and more cases are needed to determine whether there are differences between the infections caused by different mycobacterial species. In previous studies (Morfitt et al., 1989, Knippel et al., 2004; Baral et al., 2006; De Groot et al., 2010, Gunn-Moore et al., 2011a), lymph node involvement was common, as it was in the present study. Sampling an enlarged lymph node can be a fast and relatively easy way to confirm a diagnosis. M. avium has been described to cause enlarged abdominal lymph nodes (Barry et al., 2002, Knippel et al., 2004; Rivi\u00e8re et al., 2011), similar to cats B and C in this study and in addition to feline infectious peritonitis and lymphoma, mycobacteriosis should be considered as a differential diagnosis when markedly enlarged abdominal lymph nodes are noted.",

Histological patterns similar to those reported in cat C are described with M. avium infection (Morfitt et al., 1989, Knippel et al., 2004, Baral et al., 2006). To the best of our knowledge, there are no detailed descriptions in the literature concerning the histological pattern for M. branderi/shimoidei or M. malmoense infection, but Gunn-Moore et al. (2011b) found no significant differences between the histological changes related to infections by different mycobacteria. However, most of those cases involved infection with MTC species, MAC species or were culture-negative, with only one cat with M. malmoense infection studied. When considering giant cells, the present findings match the results of Gunn-Moore et al. (2011b), with giant cells appearing with M. malmoense infection, but being rare in lesions caused by M. avium. In cat C, mycobacteria-laden macrophages were also often seen within the adipose tissue of different organs, which could indicate similar predilection for adipose tissue as reported for some NTM species (Gunn-Moore, 2014).",

Based on these results, mycobacterial spreading between organ systems may happen faster than the formation of visible lesions.

Even though people and animals are readily exposed to the bacteria in the environment (Griffith et al., 2007), infections caused by NTM are rare and, to our knowledge, there are no reported animal-to-human infections of NTM species outside the MAC. However, considering the close relationship of owners and pets and the survivability of mycobacteria in the household environment, a cat shedding mycobacteria in its faeces and sputum may increase the owner's exposure to mycobacteria. This should be taken into consideration, especially if the animal is infected with MAC species or if the owner has any immunocompromise.",

The sequencing method used in this study could not differentiate between the two species. M. malmoense has been isolated from natural waters in Finland (Bittner and Preheim, 2016) and causes mainly pulmonary infections in people (Bittner and Preheim, 2016, Koh, 2017), with cases reported in immunocompetent patients (Jeon et al., 2015).
