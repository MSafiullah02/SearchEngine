Following viral infection, autophagy is often initiated to curtail infection by delivering viral particles for lysosomal degradation and further integrating with innate pattern recognition receptor signaling to induce interferon (IFN)-mediated viral clearance. However, some viruses have evolved anti-autophagy strategies to escape host immunity and to promote viral replication. In this chapter, we illustrate how autophagy prevents viral infection to generate an optimal anti-viral milieu, and then concentrate on how viruses subvert and hijack the autophagic process to evade immunosurveillance, thereby facilitating viral replication and pathogenesis. Understanding the interplays between autophagy and viral infection is anticipated to guide the development of effective anti-viral therapeutics to fight against infectious diseases.",

Autophagy is also selective for the recognition and degradation of specific cargoes tagged by ubiquitination by a group of E3 ligase family proteins such as the tripartite motif (TRIM) proteins [142] . Depending on the cargos being sorted for destruction, selective autophagy can be classified into mitophagy (damaged mitochondria), pexophagy (peroxisome), ribophagy (ribosomes), ER-phagy (ER), glycophagy (glycogen), xenophagy (pathogens), and lipophagy (lipid droplets) [119] . Specifically, the xenophagy, a type of selective autophagy specifically senses intracellular microorganisms, including viruses, and physically targets them to autophagosomes for further degradation [75] . Autophagy, programmed to dispose of cytoplasmic components, is first activated by the innate immune system to degrade and clear invading viruses [22, 34] , and then facilitates antigen processing followed by the induction of adaptive immune responses at later stages of infection [22, 103, 114] .",

Physically, these viruses settle down in the membrane-bound, the protected environment offered by the autophagosome; and metabolically, they utilize autophagy-generated energy and metabolites. In short, these viruses suppress the autophagic process to avoid being degraded or use the autophagosome as the site for replication. Lipophagy, another form of autophagy that degrades intracellular lipid droplets, can also be manipulated by viruses [53] . Lipid droplets serve as a desirable platform for virion assembly, and directly inducing lipophagy allows viruses to sustain the high ATP levels needed for viral replication. In brief, current evidence supports the notion that viruses have evolved strategies to either combat or exploit autophagy to benefit their own life cycle and survival.",

            "text": "Autophagy can also be activated by viral membrane fusion. Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) envelope glycoproteins (gp120 and gp41, called Env) up-regulate autophagy with their fusogenic activity between HIV-infected cells and uninfected CD4 T cells, which could be prevented by HIV fusion inhibitors T20 and C34, leading to the cell death of uninfected T cells ( Fig. 5.1, Step 3 ). There is not much known about the specific pathways and mechanisms that make up this process, although it hints that bioactive lipids involved in this fusion process and increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production may mediate the activation of autophagy [33] . It is also important to note that the signaling activity of CD4 and CXCR4 are not associated with autophagy activated by Env [33] . Events following the fusion initiate autophagy via distinct mechanisms. For instance, the delivery of viral components into the cytosol can lead to cytosolic pattern recognition receptor (PRR)-induced autophagy. This is best illustrated by viral particles containing single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) such as vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV): the cytosolic viral replication intermediates in VSV-infected plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) can be introduced and transported by autophagy to lysosome compartment for the recognition by Toll-like receptor (TLR) 7, which leads to the activation type I interferon (IFN) signaling and the production of IFN-\u03b1. Atg5-deficient pDCs were not allowed to recognize VSV infection through TLR7, further demonstrating the critical step of VSV-induced autophagy in the host defense of viral infection ( Fig. 5.1, Step 4) [71] .",

ER stress is thought to be activated via the accumulation of viral polyproteins [51] , which trigger the unfolded protein response (UPR) to restore homeostasis [51, 57] . In the case of CHIKV, its replication promotes the activation of inositol-requiring Ser/Thr protein kinase/endonuclease a (IRE-1a) pathway for provoking the UPR-elicited autophagy through the splicing of X-box-binding protein 1. CHIKV replication also induces increased ROS and reactive nitrogen species, which stimulates autophagy via AMPKmediated inhibition of the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) (Fig. 5 .1, Step 5) [60] .",

Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) encodes the neurovirulence factor ICP34.5 that binds to Beclin-1 and suppresses autophagy ( Fig. 5. 2) [100] . Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) encodes a functional homolog of ICP34.5 called TRS1 that works against autophagy as well ( Fig. 5. 2) [17] . Unlike ICP34.5, the PKR binding domain of TRS1 is irrelevant to autophagy inhibition. Instead, TRS1 interacts with Beclin-1 through its N-terminal region, and this binding is indispensable to suppress autophagy. Besides TRS1, IRS1, another protein encoded by HCMV, has also been proven to inhibit autophagy by interacting with Beclin-1( Fig. 5. 2) [95] . A myriad of viruses encode viral BCL-2 (vBCL-2), a protein mimicking its cellular counterpart (cBCL-2), and inhibit autophagy by directly interacting with Beclin-1 [104] . Biochemical and structural analyses showed that, compared with cBCL-2, vBCL-2 lacks the regulatory loop of cBCL-2, which is required for its phosphorylation by JUN N-terminal kinase (JNK). As a result, the association of cBCL-2 with Beclin-1 segregates Beclin-1 from the autophagy initiation complex, thereby attenuating the autophagosome formation [67, 149] . Human gamma-herpesvirus 4 (Epstein-Barr virus, EBV) encodes BHRF1 and BALF-1, two ortholog proteins of cellular Bcl-2, but their inhibitory effects on autophagy remain unclear [3] . Most members of the gamma-herpesvirus family encode and express vBcl-2 during their productive lytic infection process. For example, KSHV and murine \u03b3-herpesvirus 68 (MHV68) use ORF16 and M11 to antagonize autophagy ( Fig. 5. 2) [30] . These studies have collectively illustrated that vBCL-2 has evolved to become a highly mighty autophagy suppressor.",

            "text": "Coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) is in the same Picornaviridae family as PV. The mechanisms by which picornaviruses use to exploit autophagy for their benefits are still unclear. Whether picornaviral infection results in incomplete versus complete autophagy is disputable. Several studies have shown that CVB3 infection restricts the fusion of autophagosomes with lysosomes, leading to the production of giant autophagy-related vesicles during infections [63, 113, 148] . By contrast, another report suggests that CVB3 prompts complete autophagy [121] . A third recently published study showed that CVB3 infection compromises the autophagosome-lysosome/endosome fusion and, at least in part, promotes the accumulation of autophagosomes [94] . A new mechanism has been proposed: synaptosomal-associated protein 29 (SNAP29) and adaptor protein pleckstrin homology domain-containing protein family member 1 (PLEKHM1), known as regulators in autophagosome fusion, are both indispensable to the accumulation of autophagosomes. By cleaving SNAP29 and PLEKHM1 with proteinase 3C, CVB3 curtails Viruses manipulate autophagy to promote their replication. Double-membrane vesicles (DMVs), following picornaviral infection, furnish the virus an excellent physical platform for viral RNA assembly and replication. And some picornaviruses, such as PV and coxsackievirus, can spread via extracellular microvesicles (EMVs) in a non-lytic manner between cells. The poliovirus triggered membranes can be specifically induced by the co-expression of two viral proteins, 2BC and 3A. HCV infection prompts the expression of Rubicon and UVRAG, which separately increases and decreases the maturation of autophagosomes. And Rubicon can be triggered by HCV NS4B protein alone. IRGM, known to contribute to autophagy, is localized at the Golgi apparatus and regulates the fragmentation of Golgi membranes in response to HCV infection, resulting in co-localization of Golgi vesicles with replicating HCV. Non-structural viral proteins 2B, 2C and 3A with LC3 and viral structural protein VP1 with Atg5, and LC3 with LAMP-1 co-localize in FMDV-infected cells. DENV stimulates and needs AMPK signaling and AMPK-independent suppression of mTORC1 activity for proviral lipophagy. ZIKV NS4A and NS4B, down-regulate cooperatively the Akt-mTOR pathway and induce cellular dysregulation. ZIKV NS3-mediated cleavage of FAM134B blocks the formation of ER and viral protein enriched autophagosomes, and the reticulophagy pathway further. As for HIV, nondegradative stages of autophagy promote its yields at early stage; HIV Gag-derived proteins bind to and interact with LC3, and autophagy enhances productive Gag processing. And when autophagy progresses to the maturation stages, HIV protein Nef plays as an anti-autophagic maturation factor by the interaction with the autophagy regulatory factor Beclin-1, which protects HIV from degradation. The dual and delicate interaction of HIV with the autophagy pathway enhances viral yields by utilizing the early stages while inhibiting the late stages. SARS-CoV and MHV, activate the formation of DMVs. And MHV utilizes the pathway of EDEMosome formation to generate the DMVs. IAV M2 interacts with LC3 and leads to LC3 re-localization. And a highly pathogenic avian H5N1 strain of IAV is able to block mTOR, activating autophagy. HPIV3 induces incomplete autophagy by blocking autophagosome-lysosome fusion, leading to increased virus production. The viral phosphoprotein binds to SNAP29 and suppresses its interaction with syntaxin17, therefore preventing these two host SNARE proteins from mediating autophagosomelysome fusion. Matrix protein of HPIV3 shuttles to mitochondria and interacts with TUFM. The interaction between M and the LC3 protein that mediates autophagosome formation. These interactions with both TUFM and LC3 are required for the induction of mitophagy and result in inhibition of the type I interferon response. In RV-infected cells, RV NSP4 co-localized with LC3 in cap-like structures associated with viroplasms. And NSP4 enhances the release of calcium from the ER into the cytoplasm, leading to CaMKK-\u03b2 signaling to trigger autophagy. HBV HBx maintains interrelationships with PI3KC3 and DAPK, and directly activates Beclin-1 to trigger autophagy. EBV LMP1 up-regulates PERK and the unfolded protein response to drive its own synthesis autophagic flux and the resulting impaired versions of SNAP29/PLEKHM1 prompt viral replication [94] .",

However, it is still controversial whether HCV is able to efficiently prompt the fusion between autophagosomes and lysosomes. Several studies lean toward the viewpoint that HCV induces autophagosome formation but obstructs the fusion to benefit viral replication and to prevent virion degradation [126, 127, 136] . For example, Sir et al. demonstrated that HCV induces the accumulation of autophagosomes without causing autophagic protein degradation in cells, and this inducement relies on UPR [126] . Dreux et al. suggested that the autophagy pathway is required for the translation of incoming HCV RNA but not for the maintenance of replication [39] . In contrast, Ke et al. found that the entire autophagic process used to complete autolysosome maturation is essential for supporting HCV RNA replication [62] . Nevertheless, during the early stage of infection, the HCV RNA-dependent RNA polymerase NS5B binds to ATG5, meaning that HCV utilizes ATG5 as a proviral factor at the onset of infection. The resultant downregulation of autophagy via ATG5 silencing obstructs HCV replication and persistence (Fig. 5.3) [47]. Two autophagy regulatory proteins, ultraviolet radiation resistance-associated gene protein (UVRAG), and Rubicon, expressed with different kinetics upon HCV infection activate and suppress the maturation of autophagosomes (Fig. 5.3) . HCV is capable of temporally regulating autophagy by inducing the expression of these two proteins differentially to enhance its replication [145] . The early induction of Rubicon by HCV suppresses the fusion between autophagosomes and lysosomes, as a result of the accumulation of autophagosomes and encouragement of HCV replication [145] . Additionally, immunity-related GTPase family M protein (IRGM), an IFN-inducible GTPase, has been reported to regulate autophagy and the development of a variety of intracellular membrane compartments [46] . Upon HCV infection, IRGM interacts with Golgi apparatus-specific brefeldin A-resistance guanine nucleotide exchange factor 1 (GBF1) and facilitates AMPK-mediated GBF1 phosphorylation, thus activating GTPase ADB ribosylation factor 1 (ARF1) for Golgi apparatus fragmentation and coordinating viral replication (Fig. 5.3) [49]. Furthermore, the IRGM-mediated phosphorylation of ULK1 is triggered by HCV infection [16] . The sum of evidence points to the fact that HCV dynamically modulates autophagy to promote viral replication (Fig. 5.3) .",

The PI3K activity of VPS34 is non-essential for this induction and occurs very early, as ultraviolet-inactivated FMDV is still able to provoke the autophagosome formation [6] . In addition, co-localization of viral non-structural proteins 2B, 2C, and 3A with LC3 was observed and autophagosomes induced by FMDV contained VP1, the viral capsid protein, which co-localizes with p62, suggesting that autophagosome formation is activated at FMDV entry ( Fig. 5. 3) [97] . A recent study offered evidence that the expression of FMDV capsid protein VP2 is able to induce autophagy through the EIF2S1-ATF4-AKT-mTOR cascade. VP2 was found to interact with HSPB1 (heat shock protein beta-1) and up-regulate the EIF2S1-ATF4 signaling, leading to autophagy and enhanced FMDV replication [135] .",

Using 3-methyladenine or spautin-1, two autophagy inhibitors affect DENV infection [52, 89] . Lipophagy, a form of autophagy, regulates the storage of cellular lipids by lysosomal degradation [84, 124] . Within starving cells, lipophagy breaks down lipid droplets (LDs), in which the eukaryotic cells stock lipids to provide mitochondria with fatty acids, which are oxidized to create acetyl-CoA [84] . Viruses can also take advantage of lipophagy for their own benefits. The number of LDs is increased in DENV-infected cells, and in turn, the inhibition of LD formation remarkably damages DENV replication. Viral capsid proteins are contained in these LDs, which means that these DENV-induced LDs offer a platform for nucleocapsid formation as well as viral replication [117] . Moreover, lipophagy is activated in DENV-infected cells; and the stored triglycerides are depleted. \u03b2-oxidation and energy production are increased in this process, which creates a seedbed of viral replication. If exogenous free fatty acids are added into autophagy-deficient cells, DENV replication will be rescued. Etomoxir, a drug that blocks fatty acid transport into the mitochondria, will prevent it [52]. So, the quantity of free fatty acids and ATP released by lipophagy may be required for DENV replication and persistence. Moreover, DENV induces AMPK kinase activity, which prohibits mTORC1, and this modulation is crucial for virus-induced lipophagy (Fig. 5.3 ) [58] . Recently, AUP1, a lipid droplet-localized type-III membrane protein with dual localization marks for LDs and ER, was shown to be utilized by DENV to trigger lipophagy. Interaction of unmodified AUP1with the viral non-structural proteins NS4A and NS4B in DENVinfected cells triggers the acyltransferase activity of AUP1, generating phospholipids as the source of membrane components necessary for lipophagy formation and subsequent viral replication [151] . This mechanism seems to be a general phenomenon in flaviviruses and underlies the key role of post-translational modifications during viral infections [151] .",

Moreover, the spread of ZIKV might be up-regulated by noncanonical secretory autophagy, as it is for PV and CVB3 [153] . In human neural progenitor cells ER rearrangement and the formation of vesicular clusters in ZIKV infection were thought to be the sites for viral RNA replication and virion assembly [25, 98] . In ZIKV-infected primary fibroblasts, multi-membrane structures are formed resembling autophagic vesicles [48] . In addition, increased lapidated LC3 in ZIKV-infected placentae and decreased viral titers in ATG16-deficient mouse fetuses both work in favor of the proviral role of autophagy [15] . Zika virus (ZIKV) utilizes the ER as a source of membranes to establish their viral replication, assembly and maturation. A selective form of ER degradation by autophagy, or reticulophagy has evolved in the host to restrict DENV and ZIKV, mediated by an ER-resident reticulophagy receptor FAM134B [7] . The virally encoded proteases NS3 in several flaviviruses including ZIKV, DENV, and West Nile Virus (WNV) cleaves FAM134B to suppress the formation of ER and viral protein enriched autophagosomes, as a strategy that viruses manipulate autophagy for their replication (Fig. 5. 3) [74] . Furthermore, upon ZIKV infection in fetal neural stem cells AKT phosphorylation and subsequent mTOR activation will be inhibited through the viral protein NS4A and NS4B, which leads to the aberrant activation of autophagy and defective neurogenesis, thus promoting viral replication (Fig. 5.3 ) [81] .",

On the one hand, HIV Gagderived proteins co-localize with and bind to LC3, and autophagy supports productive Gag processing in early and nondegradative stages of autophagy to promote HIV yields (Fig. 5.3) . On the other hand, when autophagy enters its maturation stages, HIV protein Nef serves as an anti-autophagic maturation factor through interactions with Beclin-1, thus protecting HIV from degradation. Therefore, the perturbation of the early and late stage of autophagy process promotes HIV survival and replication [68] . However, during permissive infection, HIV attenuates autophagy in order to avoid proteolytic degradation. Normally, mTOR phosphorylates transcription factor EB (TFEB) and restricts its translocation by favoring its retention within the cytosol. When mTOR is suppressed, TFEB gets dephosphorylated and is allowed to transfer to the nucleus, where it can promote autophagy and lysosomal gene expression. Within infected macrophages, the interplay between HIV and TLR8 activates autophagy, which relies on the dephosphorylation and nuclear translocation of TFEB. During permissive infection, Nef interacts with Beclin-1, leading to mTOR activation, TFEB phosphorylation, and cytosolic sequestration, as well as the suppression of autophagy [14] .",

However, the exact derivation of the DMV lipid bilayers, the host protein content, and the identification of the cellular factors essential for DMVs formation remains unclear [66] . The probable participation of autophagy in the conversion of host membranes into DMVs has been reported [26, 87, 134] . The precise mechanisms that explain why CoVs limits subsequent autophagosome expansion are still a mystery. The non-structural protein 6 (NSP6) has been reported to trigger the autophagic pathway and limit autophagosome expansion to favor CoVs infection [26, 27] . Atg5, according to a study, is non-essential for MHV replication [154] . Contradictory evidence showed either the presence [108, 154] or the absence [31, 129] of LC3/Atg8 on DMVs. Another theory about the origin of virus-induced DMVs suggests that these DMVs are part of a reticulovesicular network of modified ER membranes and contain dsRNA in their interior, which came from a natural and intuitive analysis of SARS-CoV and MHV-infected cells via electron tomography [66] . This idea has been supported by several findings [50, 61, 99] . NSP4, when separately expressed, was shown to localize to the ER and then translocate to the DMVs upon infection [99] . But the deficiency of ER, ER-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC), or Golgi protein markers within CoV-induced DMVs might well mean that their biogenesis does not rely on the traditional pathway [99, 129, 143] . Of special interest is a study that determined MHV hijacks the pathway of EDEMosome (a vesicle involved in ER-associated degradation, ERAD) formation to generate the DMVs (Fig. 5.3) . In doing so, MHV trapped two ERAD regulatory proteins into the DMVs, and therefore, exploited the ERAD pathway for viral replication [109] . In addition, this study also revealed an autophagy-independent role for nonlipidated LC3-I [109] .",

Further study showed that M2 hijacks autophagy with its LC3interacting region [4] . M2 interacts with LC3 and induces LC3 re-localization to the plasma membrane, and disruption of this interaction down-regulates virion budding and stability (Fig. 5.3 ). Another protein, NS1 triggers autophagy by promoting the synthesis of hemagglutinin (HA) and M2 [155] . Recently, IAV M2 protein was reported to interact with MAVS and positively regulate MAVS-mediated innate immunity. Moreover, ROS production induced by M2 is pivotal for the activation of autophagy and the amplification of the MAVS signaling pathway [146] . In addition, a highly pathogenic avian H5N1 strain of IAV is able to activate autophagy by inhibiting mTOR [85] .",

Hepatitis B x protein (HBx) has been linked to an extraordinarily diverse group of pathways, like ones that maintain interrelationships with PI3KC3, or the ones that induce death associated protein kinase (DAPK) in a way that involves Beclin-1 [150] , or the ones that directly activate Beclin-1 expression [137] to trigger autophagy ( Fig. 5.3 ). Another one of its encoded proteins SHBs, can induce autophagy as well [78] . As an intermediate process, the accumulation of autophagosomes mirrors the balance between the rate of their generation and conversion into autolysosomes. Tang et al. suggested the view that HBx, at the initiation stage of autophagic progression triggers autophagy in a Beclin-1-dependent fashion (Fig. 5.3 ) [137] . Wang et al. suggested that HBV induces autophagy at the initiation stage by the interaction of HBx and c-myc to influence miR-192-3p-XIAP, which in turn regulates Beclin-1 [144] . Meanwhile, Liu et al. revealed that in the late phase of autophagy HBx induces the formation of autophagosomes where HBx evidently damages the lysosomal degradative ability [83] . And they partly supported the conclusion of Sir et al., which stated that HBx is enough to induce autophagosomes [83] .",

The sixtransmembrane spanning domains (6TM) of LMP1 up-regulate PERK, resulting in UPR-mediated autophagy (Fig. 5. 3) [69, 70] . Moreover, EBNA1-fragments instead of EBNA3C and EBNA2 are presented via MHC class-II through the autophagylysosomal process [138] . And, the accumulation of EBNA1 in autophagosomes suppresses the lysosomal acidification, resulting in a reduction of EBNA1-antigen presentation for CD4 + T lymphocytes recognition [138] . In summary, these findings illustrated that EBV latent antigens hijack autophagy and subsequently influence B-cell lymphomagenesis.",

            "text": "Autophagy also possesses anti-viral capabilities independent of its role in degradation. For mouse norovirus (MNV) infection in vivo, the ATG5/ATG12/ATG16L1 complexplays a key role in autophagosome formation and is essential for IFN\u03b3mediated anti-viral defense [54] . In ATG16L1 hypomorphic mice, MNV infection induced a phenotype that resembled Crohn's disease [13] . Interestingly, the initiation, fusion, and degradative activities of autophagy were indispensable; while IFN\u03b3-inducible GTPases, which were targeted to MNV replication complexes by LC3 suppressed viral replication [10] . HCV NS5A protein interacts with the IFN-\u03b2-inducible protein SHISA5, which transfers NS5A to autophagosomes for further degradation. SMURF1 is indispensable for the co-localization of the SINV capsid protein to p62, which prompts virophagy by shuttling the viral capsid to autophagosomes. FANCC also interacts with SINV capsid protein (not known to be ubiquitinated) and enhance virophagy. Poliovirus breaks the endosomal membrane and releases its genome into the cytoplasm, and Galectin-8 detects the permeated endosomes and marks them for autophagic degradation, but PLA2G16 facilitates viral genome translocation and prevents clearance. Upon HIV viral fusion, TRIM5\u03b1 induces the recruitment of Atg5 to the TRIM5\u03b1-Atg16L1-HIV-1p24 capsid complex, promoting lipidation of LC3 (LC3 II) and thereby mediating autophagosome formation. HIV Vif interacts with the HD6A/APOBEC3G complex to induce its rapid degradation. Autophagy selectively degrades the HIV-1 transactivator Tat, a protein that is essential for HIV-1 transcription and virion production",

On one hand, autophagy destructs viruses, regulates inflammatory responses, and provokes antigen presentation. On the other hand, viruses try all means to enhance their immune escape, replication, and release from infected cells by sabotaging or taking advantage of autophagy. Different virus finds its own strategies to survive the autophagic destruction while secures the membrane source provided by autophagy for viral replication. In summary, autophagy and viral infection are highly connected and continuing investigations on the virus autophagy interplays will be a fruitful area of scientific inquiry for many years to come. ",

            "text": "Fig. 5.3 Viruses manipulate autophagy to promote their replication. Double-membrane vesicles (DMVs), following picornaviral infection, furnish the virus an excellent physical platform for viral RNA assembly and replication. And some picornaviruses, such as PV and coxsackievirus, can spread via extracellular microvesicles (EMVs) in a non-lytic manner between cells. The poliovirus triggered membranes can be specifically induced by the co-expression of two viral proteins, 2BC and 3A. HCV infection prompts the expression of Rubicon and UVRAG, which separately increases and decreases the maturation of autophagosomes. And Rubicon can be triggered by HCV NS4B protein alone. IRGM, known to contribute to autophagy, is localized at the Golgi apparatus and regulates the fragmentation of Golgi membranes in response to HCV infection, resulting in co-localization of Golgi vesicles with replicating HCV. Non-structural viral proteins 2B, 2C and 3A with LC3 and viral structural protein VP1 with Atg5, and LC3 with LAMP-1 co-localize in FMDV-infected cells. DENV stimulates and needs AMPK signaling and AMPK-independent suppression of mTORC1 activity for proviral lipophagy. ZIKV NS4A and NS4B, down-regulate cooperatively the Akt-mTOR pathway and induce cellular dysregulation. ZIKV NS3-mediated cleavage of FAM134B blocks the formation of ER and viral protein enriched autophagosomes, and the reticulophagy pathway further. As for HIV, nondegradative stages of autophagy promote its yields at early stage; HIV Gag-derived proteins bind to and interact with LC3, and autophagy enhances productive Gag processing. And when autophagy progresses to the maturation stages, HIV protein Nef plays as an anti-autophagic maturation factor by the interaction with the autophagy regulatory factor Beclin-1, which protects HIV from degradation. The dual and delicate interaction of HIV with the autophagy pathway enhances viral yields by utilizing the early stages while inhibiting the late stages. SARS-CoV and MHV, activate the formation of DMVs. And MHV utilizes the pathway of EDEMosome formation to generate the DMVs. IAV M2 interacts with LC3 and leads to LC3 re-localization. And a highly pathogenic avian H5N1 strain of IAV is able to block mTOR, activating autophagy. HPIV3 induces incomplete autophagy by blocking autophagosome-lysosome fusion, leading to increased virus production. The viral phosphoprotein binds to SNAP29 and suppresses its interaction with syntaxin17, therefore preventing these two host SNARE proteins from mediating autophagosomelysome fusion. Matrix protein of HPIV3 shuttles to mitochondria and interacts with TUFM. The interaction between M and the LC3 protein that mediates autophagosome formation. These interactions with both TUFM and LC3 are required for the induction of mitophagy and result in inhibition of the type I interferon response. In RV-infected cells, RV NSP4 co-localized with LC3 in cap-like structures associated with viroplasms. And NSP4 enhances the release of calcium from the ER into the cytoplasm, leading to CaMKK-\u03b2 signaling to trigger autophagy. HBV HBx maintains interrelationships with PI3KC3 and DAPK, and directly activates Beclin-1 to trigger autophagy. EBV LMP1 up-regulates PERK and the unfolded protein response to drive its own synthesis",
