            "text": "The People's Republic of China-or mainland China-has emerged as the second largest economic power in the world with an average 10 percent growth of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) a year (World Bank 2015 ). The country was formerly administered by a huge, bureaucratic, communist politburo. It has undergone a post-Mao era's reform in 1978 to incorporate economic growth within its own fragmented, authoritarian polity (McGregor 2011 ; Zhao 2008 ) . As a consequence, at the start of Deng Xiaoping's economic reform and openness policy, the industrialized China lifted around 500 million of its 1.3 billion citizens out of poverty (World Bank 2015 ; French and Crabbe 2010 , p. XXIV) . However, China maintains its system of authoritarianism, notwithstanding regular cries for \"Western style democracy\" by Chinese students and citizens such as those of the Tiananmen Square protest in April 1989 (Leslie 2014 ) Moreover, it is also well documented that Western diseases or chronic non-communicable diseases are prevalent due to rapid changes in lifestyle, such as, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, obesity, lung cancer etc. (French and Crabbe 2010 , pp. 6-8) . The emergence of communicable diseases has been well documented in good case studies, such as those of bubonic plague in the nineteenth century (Pryor 1975 , pp. 61-70) and the epidemics or pandemics in the contemporary globalization period of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), bird fl u or H5N1, HIV/ AIDS, or even persistent tuberculosis and malaria. In addition, mental health-related issues such as high suicide rates, depression, and mental disorders are on the rise (Huang 2013 , p. 4; MacPherson 2008 , pp. 39-49) . All of these health hazards and ecological mishaps have had not only the microbes and some individuals to blame; socio-politico-cultural determinants are in fact the culprits. The low chance of the poor getting good education, the absence of strong civic organizations, morally corrupt interest groups and bureaucracies in food production and environmental regulation and control, public health policies, sanitary standards, healthcare funding, gender-related factors, the one-child policy, and the top-down health communication strategies could be mentioned as partly responsible as well (French and Crabbe 2010 , pp. XIII-XIV; Huang 2013 , p. 21; Wermuth 2003 , p. 63) . Not only domestic factors but also external factors such as globalization, policies of the World Trade Organization (WTO), the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) affect China's inequalities (Harris and Seid 2004 , p. 25) .",

According to Hopkins ( 2002 ) , globalization is a new term that denotes ongoing historical processes from before the 1500s up to the present day. According to Lie ( 2003 , pp. 101-116) , globalization can be understood as a fl ow of cultural products from one location to another. The location can be nations, communities, institutions, or individuals. Unfortunately, the global fl ows cannot be smooth because of nation states' boundaries, geocultural boundaries, such as East and West, and geo-economic boundaries, such as the North-South divide (Powell and Steel 2011 ) . Globalization makes some regions become centers of economic growth while others are outliers or closer to the periphery. This affects the life of the people in those regions a great deal. Harris and Seid ( 2004 ) explain that the transition from agrarian to industrial societies in most developing countries has been slower and more problematic than that in the developed nations as there are many people who did not benefi t from the developments.",

Social determinants that can be considered as negative consequences of globalization contributing to NCDs among populations include migration of the population from traditional means of subsistence, urbanization without provision of standard housing and employment, and large unregulated marketing of tobacco products and alcoholic beverages (Harris and Seid 2004 , p. 16; Yacht and Beaglehole 2004 , pp. 214-215) . The globalized world-equipped with high-speed transportation-has resulted in mobility and migration being deemed responsible for the emergence of new patterns of infectious diseases and speeding up the transmission rate of those diseases. Major infectious diseases have killed large populations: small pox (500 million people), measles (200 million), Spanish fl u (80 million), Bubonic plague (75 million), AIDS (40 million), and typhus (4 million) (WHO 2015 ) . Although the incidence of infectious diseases dropped from 40 percent to 17.5 percent between 1990 and 2010, new diseases have emerged at the rate of one or more per year since the 1970s. According to the World Health Organization ( 2015 ), several new infectious diseases are, for instance, the Severe acute respiratory associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV), henipaviruses (hendra and nipah), avian infl uenza virus, and the H1N1 virus (swine infl uenza). There are also historic, infectious diseases that are re-emerging, such as West Nile fever, human monkey pox, dengue, TB, and malaria.",

In turn, it affects the living conditions of workers and their health. environmental changes, and changes in lifestyle as well as communications that come with globalization take tolls on public health. Specifi cally in China, health can be examined through fi ve pathways, as suggested by Harris and Seid ( 2004 , p. 11 ): (a) economic growth, income distribution, and poverty; (b) democracy and governance; (c) health services; (d) nutrition and food security; and (e) other risk or mitigating factors. The latest data indicates that more than a quarter of the adult population in China, or around 350 million people, are overweight and obese (The Economist 2014 ), and according to WHO ( 2014 ), 6.5 percent of female and 4.6 percent of male Mainland Chinese adults aged more than 20 are obese. The more affl uent Hong Kongers witness excess weight and obesity among 48.3 percent of males and 31.4 percent of females. Obesity among children in both mainland China and in Hong Kong is on the rise. It is also worth noticing that 6.9 percent of male Chinese children are obese, which is twice the percentage of the male adults (The Economist 2014 ), and one out of every fi ve children in Hong Kong is obese (South China Morning Post 2015 ). It is also worth noting that obesity is expanding more in the rural areas than in the cities, as many farmers have sold their landholdings for development and moved to more sedentary lifestyles (The Economist 2014 ). The cause of obesity in cities in China is due to the lack of public spaces for exercise, and the changes in eating patterns as people consume more meat, potatoes, cow's milk, beers, fast food/deep-fried foods than in the past; hence, oils and fats (especially transfat or hydrogenated fat used for producing margarine), monosodium glutamate, sugar, and salt are on the increase while not enough grains are being consumed (French and Crabbe 2010 , pp. 49-73, 107) . Obesity may lead to a lack of concentration, sleep apnoea, constipation, osteoarthritis, slipped discs, bad backs, pulled muscles and infertility (French and Crabbe 2010 , pp. 7, 9-10) .",

NCDs accounted for 87 percent of total deaths in China in 2014 (WHO 2014 ). French and Crabbe ( 2010 , p. 7) reported that it was known in 2007 that bad diet, obesity and a lack of physical exercise are the factors that are associated with cancers among the women in Shanghai. The cancer diagnosis rates in Shanghai were more or less the same as those in the European Union (EU). It is alarming that 11.6 percent of the population in the mainland is diabetic, according to the latest survey (The Economist 2014 ). With reference to infectious diseases in mainland China, Zhang and Wilson ( 2012 ) HONG KONG PUBLIC HEALTH AND HEALTH COMMUNICATION POLICIES, 1842 -1941 During the period before the Second World War , the health policy and communication on the bubonic plague that broke out in Tai Ping Shan in Hong Kong in 1896 was examined by Pryor ( 1975 , p. 61 ). The plague bacillus was carried by rats to humans and through the air (Pryor 1975 , p. 62, 68) . Plague (or the Black Death) that killed 80,000 people was thought to have spread either from Yunnan, in the South of China, or via a transportation route from India (Pryor 1975 , pp. 62, 68) . One of the social determinants that helped spread the disease was the overcrowded tenements in which residents were divided in cubicles, some of which did not even have windows (Pryor 1975 , p. 68) . The fi rst public health strategy was a bio-medical approach focused on quarantine, the rapid disposal of corpses, fumigation or disinfection of residences, and evacuation. Hong Kong, then a colony under the British, demolished every house in Tai Ping Shan and rebuilt the area as a public park called Blake Garden (Ng 2014 , p.149 ). This is a top-down approach.",

In 1948, health communication in Hong Kong could therefore be called a participatory-based advocacy (Servaes and Malikhao 2010 ) . Communication as a non-anti-tuberculosis association was formed. At the same time, a structural intervention approach to public health was implemented when the housing authority resettled the slum dwellers to standard residential areas. Hong Kong also collaborated with international organizations like WHO to create outreach services. It also limited the number of migrants from mainland China. The health communication strategy-combining social marketing of vaccinations with behavioral change interventions-came up with promotional activities such as giving away gifts to the children who had been vaccinated. This strategy was used to battle cholera and hepatitis infections (MacPherson 2008 , pp. 23-24) . The public health of Hong Kong after 1997 will be analyzed in conjunction with that of mainland China as Hong Kong was returned to China under the one country, two systems arrangement after that particular year.",

In 1985, public health policies allowed the private health care establishments to reduce the role of the state (Huang 2013 , pp. 57-58) . It was a structural change of the public health system. Huang ( 2013 , p. 80) reported that this economic reform model in the health sector \"jettisoned the Maoist health model which emphasized quality and universalism\". The profi t-oriented approach had a profound effect on preventive measures as the public needed to bear the cost of medical fees (MacPherson 2008 , p. 36) . In 2006, it was found that historical diseases had re-emerged and new diseases such as HIV and AIDS, H5N1 or SARS spread rapidly. Hong Kong has had a \"socialist\" health care system providing good service at minimal cost to the people (MacPherson 2008 , p. 45) . In 2006, the Hong Kong SAR Government introduced private health insurance schemes for those who could afford them (MacPherson 2008 , p. 45).",

According to MacPherson ( 2008 , p. 40) , the number of people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) in Hong Kong remains low but the increase of HIV infection rates in Guangdong and Shenzhen, which borders Hong Kong, has triggered alarms. The HIV epidemic in China concerns three different socio-cultural and economic factors. The fi rst is a complex consequence of the poorly controlled blood, drug, and sex trades. The second is three socially marginalized populations: impoverished rural residents in central China, ethnic minorities in border regions, and female migrant workers in many cities. The third factor is homosexuality among Chinese males (Jun and Worth 2010 , pp. 13-41) .",

The media labeled and stereotyped PLWHA and their relatives. Zhang ( 2010 , pp. 177-194) studied the source of HIV-related stigma and discrimination in China. These, according to him, can be traced to ideas and metaphors associated with the attitudes of government agencies, news media, and health professionals; stigma is exacerbating the HIV/ AIDS epidemic as the infected people will not disclose their status, not even to their intimate partners, for fear of being outcast and losing income. Thus, health communication regarding HIV/AIDS in China is pretty negative and impedes the progress of public health. Shi and Chen ( 2014 , p. 295 ) conducted a quantitative content analysis about PLWHA on Weibo, the Chinese social networking application equivalent to Twitter, and found that more than half of the messages in the HIV/AIDS Weibo Group were about social support, either informational or emotional.",

Huang ( 2010 , pp. 47, 60) conducted ethnographic studies among female sex workers in China from 1996-2008 and contended that health knowledge alone will not be suffi cient to change HIV risktaking behavior. Promoting condom use among sex workers often failed to consider the complex power relations between new sex workers from poor areas, their handlers, and the customers who wanted unprotected sex (Huang 2010 , pp. 59-60) , and the government policy which used condoms as legal evidence to arrest and fi ne a sex worker before 2001. The nationwide condom use in local hotels was launched in 2004 and in entertainment areas in 2006 (Huang 2010 , p. 62) . This is a structural change intervention in the fi ght against HIV/AIDS. In 2003, the Chinese government launched the \"four frees, one care\" program consisting of free voluntary HIV testing and counseling; free anti-retroviral drugs for the poor, free medication for all pregnant PLWH, and free schooling for the orphans of people who have died of AIDS (Huang 2010 , p. 94) . The government also provides screening to prevent bloodborne infections, and a needle exchange program (Huang 2010 , p. 94) . This has been a biomedical intervention. The government launched a nationwide awareness and safe sex campaign, which was a social marketing communication strategy. From the above mentioned stigmatization studies, there is a need for more in-depth content analyses of the messages the government sent out to assess their relevance and impact.",

It is important that the time spent watching television and exposure to advertising and marketing strategies are analyzed.

The reasons given were: (a) television viewing is a sedentary activity; (b) television viewing is associated with unhealthy snacking and eating high fat, high sugar, and high salt (HFSS) pre-prepared and fast meals; (c) the exposure to advertisements of HFSS food products is high. Moreover, peers and children can infl uence HFSS food choice by peer pressure (pester power) or nagging the parents for it.

            "text": "Health communication research in China that borrows the Western quantitative analyses pays less attention to the enabling environment in which the health communication takes place. The political and economic environments infl uence the public health policy. Public health during outbreaks should be transparent and timely. Thanks to advances in epidemiological and microbiological research, which form a pivotal part of biomedical intervention, disease control and prevention are possible. However, the examples of disease outbreaks in China show that exclusively top-down command and lack of coherent communication between and among the responsible authorities can aggravate the situation. From the analyses of the public health policies of China, one can see that the civic organizations were not encouraged in China to check and balance the information from the authorities and help monitor the outbreaks. Participation is thus lacking in the health communication process in China. Advocacy-communication can be seen from the social networking sites such as Weibo and in microblogging. Mostly, behavior change interventions and school-based interventions took place for introduction of vaccination and promoting a hygienic environment. Capacity building, domestically in China and with Hong Kong Special Administrative Region or with other nations in times of a health crisis, have always proven to be effective. Law enforcement should be strengthened. Moral ethics should be on the agenda of media advocacy to make the citizens and government offi cials realize that one cannot make profi ts at the cost of other people's lives, and that one should not discriminate or victimize others (Malikhao 2016 ) . Public ethics and vigilance on any issue that affects people's wellness and well-being should be on the top agenda of communication and public health to ensure a good environment and food safety as well as a public space for recreation and well-being.",
