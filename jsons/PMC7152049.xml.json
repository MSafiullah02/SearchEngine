            "text": "The majority of emerging infectious diseases are zoonotic, and most originate in wild animals.1 The rate of emerging disease has increased significantly over the past few decades, and the majority of emerging pathogens are RNA viruses. These are distinctive in that they have the ability to mutate rapidly compared with DNA viruses and bacteria, allowing them to adapt to new hosts and spread more effectively.2 Little is understood about the dynamics of zoonotic viruses in their natural reservoirs, yet it is becoming clear that anthropogenic environmental change is driving the spillover of pathogens from wildlife populations into domestic livestock and humans. Activities such as urbanization, agricultural intensification, and global travel and trade are expanding the interface between people, livestock, and wildlife, providing continuous opportunities for pathogens to spill over into human populations and then move around the world.3 Viral spillover between wildlife and domestic animals or humans probably occurs more frequently than is recognized, owing to limited or poor surveillance systems.4 Zoonotic disease emergence is most likely to occur in regions where biodiversity and human population density are high and where human activities that alter the environment\u2014such as urbanization, agricultural expansion, and deforestation\u2014are most intensive.2, 5\n",

            "text": "Among mammalian taxa, bats (order Chiroptera) carry more zoonotic viruses than other mammalian groups.6 Why bats are special is not completely understood, but there appears to be a combination of ecologic, genetic, and immunologic factors, the last two of which have only recently begun to be explored.6, 7 Bats have been associated with several zoonotic viruses that have recently been discovered and linked to significant human and animal disease, including severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), Ebola and Marburg viruses, and Nipah virus (NiV)8 (see also Chapters 19, 34, and 42Chapter 19Chapter 34Chapter 42). There are more than 1200 species of bats in the world, forming the order Chiroptera, which makes them the second most speciose taxonomic group of mammals after rodents, representing 20% of mammalian diversity.9 Bats are found on every continent and in every environment in which humans live. They successfully exploit human dwellings, constructs, and food resources, which creates opportunity for direct and indirect contact with people and domestic animals. Although bats typically avoid direct contact with people, indirect exposure to excreta created by bats roosting within households, buildings, mines, and caves may lead to human infection with bat-borne pathogens.10 Frugivorous bats are often found roosting in trees in rural and even urban environments.11, 12 They will eat cultivated fruit such as mangos, rambutan, and guava, as well as and other human-provided food resources, which, when contaminated with bat excreta, may also serve as route of infection for people or animals. Despite their potential to carry zoonotic viruses, bats are overwhelmingly beneficial to people and plants, performing vital ecosystem services in the form of agricultural pest control13, 14 and seed dispersal and pollination.15 In many parts of the world, bats are hunted for food, sport, or traditional medicine.16 The butchering and consumption of bats provides an opportunity for the transmission of blood-borne pathogens.8\n",

The mangos attracted frugivorous bats that carried NiV; the proximity to the pig enclosures allowed contaminated fruit to be dropped and consumed by pigs. The size of the farm created an environment that could support a sustained NiV outbreak in pigs over the course of a year, which fueled the broader epidemic.19 The outbreak in Malaysia spread via the movement of infected pigs from farm to farm, ultimately leading to the depopulation and closure of thousands of farms and the infection of 265 people in Malaysia and Singapore, of whom 105 died.18 After NiV was stamped out by the systematic depopulation of pig farms, policies were put into place that required a buffer zone between orchards and livestock enclosures on commercial farms. This solution has proven effective in removing the key interface that led to NiV spillover and emergence on the index farm, and there has not been an outbreak since, despite the continued presence of the two pteropid host species and continued livestock production.",

Ebola Reston virus, a species causing disease in macaques but not humans or pigs, was detected in the common bent-wing bat (Miniopterus schreibersi), a common insectivorous bat, in the Philippines.48 Antibodies reactive to Ebola Zaire antigen have been found in Leishenault's fruit bat (Rousettus leishenaulti) in Bangladesh, and although a filovirus has not yet been identified, these findings suggest that an immunogenically related filovirus is circulating in these bats.49 Novel filoviruses, yet to be characterized, have been found in the cave nectar bat (Eonycterus spelea) and R. leishenaulti in China.50 These viruses may be closely related to those causing the immune response detected in the same species in Bangladesh. The NPC-1 receptor, used by filoviruses for cell entry, is conserved across several bat species, which further supports a broad bat species range for Ebola viruses.51 As with CoV and henipaviruses, filoviruses appear to be geographically widespread in bat hosts in both Africa and Asia. Although some Ebola viruses and Marburg virus have been associated with high mortality rates in people, Ebola Reston virus illustrates how genetic diversity within a viral group can influence pathogenicity in humans or domestic animals. Until there is an a priori method for determining pathogenicity from genetics, filovirus surveillance and ecologic research in bats and other wildlife\u2014including work done at the International Centre for Medical Research, Franceville (CIRMF)42, 47; the US Centers for Disease Control44, 45, 52; and the US Agency for International Development (USAID) under its Emerging Pandemic Threats: PREDICT program53\u2014will help to provide a better understanding of filovirus host ecology and viral genomics and inform strategies to reduce the risk of Ebola virus disease and outbreaks of Marburg virus disease (see also Chapter 19).",

Prior to the emergence of SARS and MERS, only four CoVs were known to infect humans.54 The SARS pandemic of 2002\u20132003 infected more than 8000 people in 27 countries and had a case fatality rate of ~9%.55, 56 MERS-CoV (as of June 2017) has infected more than 2000 people in 27 countries and had a 35% case fatality rate.57 These two epidemics solidified CoVs as a viral family of concern for human health. SARS-CoV emerged from bats through the live animal markets of southern China in 2003.55 The close caging of various mammalian species, including bats, and the general lack of effective biosecurity practices in handling and butchering animals in live animal markets facilitated the infection of multiple species, including civets (Paguma larvata), raccoon dogs (Nyctereutes procyonoides), and ferret badgers (Melogale spp.), all of which were initially suspected as being the primary source of the virus in early investigations.58 Initially, civets were implicated as the source of SARS-CoV, and markets and farms were depopulated of civets as a control measure. Importantly, farmed civets outside the marketplace did not have evidence of SARS-CoV infection, suggesting an alternate reservoir.59, 60 The eventual discovery of SARS-like CoVs in bats was an important step in understanding the natural reservoir, although early bat viral isolates did not use the same cell entry mechanism as SARS-CoV and therefore were not able to cause SARS in animal models. In 2012, nearly 10 years after the initial discovery of bat SARS-like CoVs, a CoV much more closely related to SARS-CoV and capable of directly infecting humans was identified among Chinese horseshoe bats (Rhinolophus sinicus) in Yunnan, China.61 Although bats are no longer legally sold in live animal markets in China, there are still communities, including some in Yunnan, that hunt and eat Rhinolophus bats, raising the possibility that SARS could reemerge.",

In addition, the high mutation rate of RNA viruses\u2014and in the case of CoVs the ability to recombine\u2014means that new genotypes are continuously being created. This presents a serious challenge to cataloging viral diversity, but doing so may ultimately pay off by allowing for the identification of genetic determinants of pathogenesis. Also, having a library of sequences from all bat CoVs, filoviruses, or henipaviruses may provide insight into where surveillance should be targeted based on viral diversity hot spots. Currently there are geographic regions such as Latin America where there is a disproportionately low number of zoonotic viruses that have been characterized in bats, relative to bat species richness, making this a region where surveillance efforts could potentially bring a high yield.6 Ultimately the integration of host ecology with viral discovery will be important for understanding the risk of viral spillover. NiV is an important reminder that simply the presence of a host and virus is not sufficient for zoonotic transmission to occur. A viable \u201cinterface\u201d or mechanism of transmission is also needed for spillover (provided that people or domestic animals are susceptible to infection). Experimental studies will also be vital to clarify the pathogenesis and transmissibility of novel viruses. Reverse engineering has made it much easier to \u201crescue\u201d or recreate viruses in the laboratory from sequence data. Genetically modified mice provide an important model for the study of susceptibility to infection and pathogenesis in human physiology.",

When newly identified viruses are related to known zoonoses, they are often presented as potential threats to human or animal health, but there is the potential to cause undue public alarm when reporting these findings. Given the potential for negative and scientifically unsupported actions against bats that include extermination, messaging to the public should provide appropriate context where there is a lack of evidence for human or animal health impact and emphasize that bats are ecologically invaluable animals. Extermination of bats should not be considered an effective response to an outbreak of a bat-borne pathogen or a control measure to prevent outbreaks.
