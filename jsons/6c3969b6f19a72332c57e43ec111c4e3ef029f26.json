A buddy system was introduced for directly-observed degowning of PPE to prevent the risk of self-contamination during degowning. HCWs were reminded to report respiratory symptoms and tested for SARS-CoV-2 if indicated. The clean zone was disinfected twice daily, while the patient zone was disinfected hourly, and immediately after patient discharge by sodium hypochlorite (1,000ppm). Since the indoor air of the hall was 6 air-change-per-hour without AIIRs at 4 AWE, partitions were built for collecting nasopharyngeal swabs (NPSs) at the outdoor covered area which was adjacent to the hall. Two fans of 88cm in diameter were set to enhance the air-change around the specimen collection area, in addition to natural ventilation. The NPSs were regularly sent to microbiology laboratory once every 2 hours for rapid molecular diagnostic test as described previously. 6 From 20 March 2020 to 19",

Fangcang shelter hospitals were built in China to meet the overwhelming number of hospitalized patients. 8 Here, we also set up a TTC within 48 hours to test almost one-third of clinically stable patients who were originally required to receive the tests in hospitals. On 19 April 2020, the TTC was closed when the service demand was no longer required. The hall of AWE was sequentially disinfected by sodium hypochlorite (1,000ppm) and ultraviolet irradiation. We could achieve zero infection among HCWs working in TTC after 14-day of medical surveillance.

            "text": "we have implemented proactive infection control measures including active surveillance, isolation of suspected and confirmed cases in airborne infection isolation rooms (AIIRs), provision of rapid molecular diagnostic test, and notification to Department of Health and Hospital Authority. 5,6 However, our AIIRs in the hospitals were fully occupied due to increasing number of symptomatic persons who were returning from countries with local transmission, as well as increasing number of COVID-19 patients in Hong Kong. We may need to admit suspected COVID-19 patients in non-AIIRs, which may pose a risk to our healthcare workers (HCWs). An innovative idea of setting up a temporary test centre (TTC) in the Asia World-Expo (AWE), which is within the Hong Kong International Airport (HKIA) complex, was put into practice within 48 hours from site visit (at 9:00pm on 18 March 2020) to commencement of service (at 8:00am on 20 March 2020). 7 The project was initiated and supported by Quality & Safety Division, Hospital Authority, and Hong Kong Government, respectively. A medical director and a chief nursing officer were seconded to AWE for administration, logistic, and manpower allocation. An infection control officer and a senior infection control nurse from a University-affiliated hospital were invited to participate in the project to coordinate and implement appropriate infection control 3 measures to prevent cross infection among patients (clinically stable symptomatic returning traveler aged 12 to 60 years) and HCWs. It was a challenging task to implement infection control measures in a nonhospital setting. It was important to design a unidirectional workflow for both patients and HCWs in a hall of ~60,000 square feet at AWE. We divided the hall into two zones: clean zone (~30% of area) and patient zone (~70% of area) with clear demarcation by double-fencing. The clean zone comprised of staff area for rest, dining, and changes of uniform, gowning area, and a central command centre. The patient zone included areas for patient registration, assessment, clinical specimen collection, and waiting for diagnostic test results. If the patients were positive for SARS-CoV-2, they would be transferred to a designated waiting area in the patient zone and waited for hospital admission. The degowning area was located at the exit of patient zone. Infection control refresher training was provided to 80 volunteered HCWs, who were working in 7 healthcare networks in Hong Kong. It was critically important to prevent transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in the TTC, especially for HCWs working in an unfamiliar setting. Audit for gowning and degowning of personal protective equipment (PPE), including gloves, gown, N95 respirator, and faceshield, was performed for 9 doctors, 41 nurses, 12",
