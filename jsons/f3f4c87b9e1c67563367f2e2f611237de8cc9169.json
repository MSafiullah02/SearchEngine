In this paper, a Caputo fractional-order derivative is applied to a system of non-integer order differential equation to model the transmission dynamics of respiratory diseases. The nonnegative solutions of the system are obtained by using the Generalized Mean Value Theorem. The next generation matrix approach is used to obtain the basic reproduction number R 0 . We discuss the stability of the disease-free equilibrium when R 0 < 1, and the necessary conditions for the stability of the endemic equilibrium when R 0 > 1. A sensitivity analysis shows that R 0 is most sensitive to the probability of the disease transmission rate.

The nonnegative solution of the model is provided by using the generalized mean value theorem.

We established and investigated the stability analysis of the fractional-order model with respect to the values of R 0 . The disease-free equilibrium is locally asymptotically stable if R 0 < 1. For R 0 > 1, using Lemma 5.1 and condition 6, we investigated the local stability of the positive endemic equilibrium state. Sensitivity analysis shows that R 0 is most sensitive to the disease transmission rate \u03b2. This recommends that periodic monitoring by medical professionals and researchers should be done to control the transmission of the disease. Additionally, we investigated the optimal control problem by the application of the optimal control theory. We used the Pontryagin's Minimum Principle to provide the necessary conditions needed for the existence of the optimal solution to the optimal control problem. Also, we applied the Atanackovic and Stankovic method to provide a numerical solution to system (5) . Lastly, the theoretical results were verified by numerical simulations to measure the efficacy and impact of control on the transmission of the respiratory diseases. From the numerical simulation, the size of the infected population is significantly reduced under the controlled conditions. This proposes that if all two control measures u 1 (quarantine of exposed population groups) and u 2 (monitoring and treatment of infected populations) are employed for the same period of time and continue for a considerable period of time, the future of free from transmission of a respiratory disease could be achieved.
