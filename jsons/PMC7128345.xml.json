While these concepts may be familiar to many, in the past weeks, an old concept, but new to many, has been disseminated to the country to decrease the spread of COVID-19: social distancing. This term includes measures from simply limiting unnecessary activities like in large gatherings such as concerts, marathons, and sports games, to more drastic measures like banning all gatherings more than 50 people, closing schools city-wide and in some cases state-wide, and furloughing non-essential personnel from businesses.8 The goal of these measures is to reduce the spread of the virus so that the doubling time of the virus is increased, the purpose being to have fewer patients present in a shorter time period to hospitals.",

This often requires difficult capacity and financial decisions during a preparation phase to make room for the anticipated influx of patients. Inherent in this, is assessing the number of currently occupied beds, planned procedures and admissions, and the maximum capacity for floor and ICU beds. More novel is what beds could be created in austere conditions by double bedding hospital and ICU rooms, conversion of PACU, operating rooms, and even hallways into ICU beds. A typical OR could house 3-6 patients depending on its size and could be staffed by CRNA\u2019s and Anesthesiologist as elective and even urgent cases are cancelled. Early and proactive bed management is key, as reports from Italy indicate that all non-critical and non-emergent care has ceased as the hospitals are now at 200% capacity.7 Given these capacity issues, systems are unable to provide adequate care for patients with everyday emergencies like stroke, myocardial infarction, and trauma. Thus, the early COVID-19 mortality numbers fail to account for many patients who will have a concurrent preventable mortality from other causes as the result of this unanticipated surge and subsequent resource exhaustion.",

Ingenuity with methods to create new ventilators from spare parts and retrofit old machines such as IPPB into working ventilators will be required. Additionally, if all patients are COVID-19+ as many as 4-patients could be linked in parallel on pressure control settings to attain reasonable minute ventilation and tidal volumes if required.11 Finally, while ventilators will be in high demand, endotracheal tubes are copious, and if family members are willing, bagging of patients by family members when no ventilator is available may be required.",

As the situation evolves staffing will become dynamic requiring a coordinated effort among physicians, advanced practice providers, and residents. Clear and definitive leadership will be required to best determine staffing and provider labor allocation for each facility. Buy-in from all respective division chiefs and departmental coordination will define and facilitate staffing levels. Situational flexibility will be paramount in conjunction with clear and efficient communication and multidisciplinary collaboration. All staffing plans must inherently assume attrition and furloughs required not only as the result of iatrogenic and community exposures, but also due to social instability, and/or resource consumption. As such, agreements should be in place to allow emergency credentialing and expansion of scope of practice to other facilities as necessitated by the needs of the community. In large health systems, or even regional cooperatives, a pool of surgeons can be mobilized to start covering cases at satellite hospitals as surgeons at these facilities are furloughed. Consideration should also be taken to minimize the risk to more senior partners to lower risk roles outside the hospital. Quarantined and senior surgeons can participate in telemedicine and even virtual critical care to increase the capacity to triage patients and care for the critically ill. Additionally, since this will be a prolonged surge if measures of social distancing are successful, consideration to weekly rotating teams off service of faculty, APP\u2019s, and residents to not deplete or expose all providers at once.",

Given the increased need for critical care expertise at this highest level, emergency general surgery (EGS) and trauma coverage should be transitioned to general surgery trained elective surgeons to allow deployment of any surgical critical care (SCC) trained physicians solely to the intensive care setting. We recommend a tiered reallocation of Acute Care Surgeons (ACS) faculty as appropriate for each respective facility. At severe manpower shortage levels, non-ACS familiar with high-acuity priorities and hemorrhage control, like vascular, transplant, and hepatobiliary surgeons may be required to take trauma call. Additionally, when supra-maximum patient capacity, with decreasing providers in Critical Care and Internal Medicine, subspecialized surgeons will likely be called to become general physicians to treat the non-critical patients with COVID-19. However, every nurse, therapists, ancillary staff, and physician regardless of specialty should have some basic training of ventilator management given the possibility of provider depletion and expansion of ICU\u2019s.",

While an emergency plan is focused on patient care, it must also support workforce sustainability in the event of quarantine, illness or injury. Resident participation in emergency preparedness plans is essential in hospitals with training programs. Planning for trainee allocation or quarantine has not been extensively studied. A hospital and graduate medical education department must decide the role trainees will play before their deployment is required, which will likely involve graduated promotion at the highest response level. The role of medical students should be carefully considered with the default response being for them to be dismissed to isolation with the general public.

For example, residents\u2019 roles in the disaster response to the Boston Marathon bombing was unclear. There was no understanding if residents would be expected to provide surge staffing or if they would be stratified by experience.13 Though most hospitals train nurses and attendings for mass-casualty events, fewer than half train residents.14\n,\n15 This is a gap in medical education that should be addressed as these incidences are unfortunately becoming more frequent. Most resident staffing during crises is managed ad hoc by chief residents or program directors. Communications should be in place, whether by group text, online meeting applications or other local mechanism, so that chief residents act as a liaison between institutional command, attending physicians and resident teams. It is likely that trainees could be asked to work beyond scheduled duty hours. Local graduate medical education leadership should be involved in preparations, and knowledge of ACGME program requirements is essential. It is possible residents will be asked to work beyond accepted duty hours, and these exceptions should be made known to the ACGME, but exemptions should be provided given the national emergency. Graduated autonomy and extension of attending physicians by senior residents as well as battlefield promotions of fellows and Chief Residents will be the most logical progression as the response to the crisis escalates and personnel are furloughed or quarantined.",

Several schemas have been created in the past to rationalize the choices that are now in front of many healthcare providers, some of which are to maximize number of life years (favors the young), social value (favors occupations that are deemed valuable in preserving society infrastructure and culture), and instrumental value (those that would have impact on the current outbreak like physicians and nurses).16\n",

While many practitioners in the US will rightly not want to set hard limits like this, the withholding of surgery with recognition of futility is readily decided upon. Surgeons inherently understand futility in end-stage cancer, overwhelming sepsis, and advanced age and comorbidities. COVID-19 patients, with progression to ARDS and multiple risk factors, will have similarly dismal potential for survival.

This tool evaluated not only if they had medical issues requiring evaluation, but also screened for potential COVID infections, utilizing the institutional infectious disease risk screening questions, embedded within the screening tool (eDocument 2). Utilizing this risk tool allowed a patient that was high risk to be directed to a COVID-19 testing site. All patients designated for upcoming clinics are assessed the week prior to the clinic appointment and determined to: 1. Not need to be seen physically nor virtually and their situation is evaluated by a clinic nurse phone conversation. 2. Be an ideal candidate for a virtual clinic visit or 3. In need of objective data, such as a radiograph or laboratory blood work prior to clinic so the type of clinic visit can be determined.

On arrival to the clinic if a patient has any active symptoms of a COVID-19 infection, they are directed to a testing site appropriate for their symptoms per institution protocols. Only 1 nurse and 1 attending can evaluate the patient. Utilizing these methods, in the first week of implementation, out of 21 scheduled ACS clinic patients, we have already identified 19 patients able to be managed by virtual or telephone visits (91% reduction in clinic visit exposure). Contact has been completed and they are being managed virtually revealing a potential 91% reduction in clinic visits. Objective data is being obtained for 2 patients (chest radiographs and laboratory values) in order to determine whether they will require a physical clinic visit. One of these 2 patient has staples that will be removed via a nurse visit or at their primary care provider\u2019s office, since they live over 1 hour away from our clinic office. While we are early in the process, transitioning our ACS clinics to a Virtual/Telemedicine Process, with appropriate resources, will continue to allow us to keep patients safe from exposure, preventing potential exposure risk to healthcare staff, as well as maintaining patient safety and perioperative surgical expectations.",
