CHIKV was first identified in Tanzania in 1953 (Lumsden, 1955). Since then it was transmitted to South and Southeast Asia, Africa, and Europe (Pialoux et al., 2007, Thiberville et al., 2013, Delisle et al., 2015). In the Western Hemisphere, however, the first locally-transmitted infection occurred in December 2013 (Leparc-Goffart et al., 2014a, Lanciotti and Valadere, 2014, Teixeira et al., 2015) in the Caribbean (Halstead, 2015, Weaver and Lecuit, 2015). By the end of 2014, >1.1 million suspect cases were reported in the Americas (Pan American Health Organization, 2017). In 2016 alone, there were over 500,000 cumulative CHIKV cases (Pan American Health Organization, 2017). In Canada, 479 confirmed and probable cases were diagnosed in 2014 (Drebot et al., 2015), of which, 128 cases were imported (Pan American Health Organization, 2017).",

CHIKV is usually self-limited, with the majority of symptoms typically resolving in 7-10 days (Pialoux et al., 2007). Generally, overall mortality is low but there exists a risk for severe disease and death associated with CHIKV infection (Renault et al., 2007). Rheumatologic symptoms and neurologic, carditis, respiratory, renal, and ocular manifestations are among the severe sequelae of CHIKV (Robinson, 1955, Lumsden, 1955, Sissoko et al., 2009, Brighton et al., 1983, Rajapakse et al., 2010). When developed, these conditions can persist for several months or years after acute infection (Sissoko et al., 2009, Brighton et al., 1983, Soumahoro et al., 2009, Borgherini et al., 2008, Larrieu et al., 2010). Furthermore, CHIKV is a common cause of virus-induced arthritis in the Eastern Hemisphere, with documented epidemics in Africa, Southeast Asia, and the Indian Ocean islands (Staples et al., 2009, Arroyo-Avila et al., 2017, Economopoulou et al., 2009, Leparc-Goffart et al., 2014b).",

The presence of these comorbidities was proposed to predispose CHIKV patients to severe complications of the viral infection (Padmakumar et al., 2010, Jean-Baptiste et al., 2016, Alvarez et al., 2017, Paganin et al., 2010). However, the prevalence of co-existing medical conditions in severe CHIKV cases has not been described. A systematic evaluation and detailed estimate for the prevalence of comorbidities in CHIKV severe cases may aid the public health sector in developing policies for surveillance, preparedness and response to the infection and its severe outcomes. The present study was undertaken to evaluate the prevalence of co-existing chronic conditions in CHIKV patients and in severe cases. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of published literature to describe the frequency of chronic comorbidities in CHIKV and to explore their possible contributions to the severity and complication of this viral condition.",

Limiting the search to English language resulted in 111 articles. When these articles were restricted to studies in human and deduplicated, 82 abstracts were searched for title and abstract review as they satisfied our selection criteria (see below). We excluded reports published as review articles, letters, editorials, conference abstracts, case reports (with less than 3 cases) or vaccination trials. Only 20 articles were considered for full text review (see Figure 1\n). Ten articles were excluded at the full text review stage as they were either not related to the study objectives (4 studies), not reporting prevalence of chronic disease in CHIKV (3 studies), case reports with small numbers of cases (i.e., <3 cases; 2 reports), or a review article (see Figure 1 and Supplementary Table S1). After identifying one study through bibliography searching, 11 reports were included for systematic review and meta-analysis (Arroyo-Avila et al., 2017, Economopoulou et al., 2009, Padmakumar et al., 2010, Jean-Baptiste et al., 2016, S\u00e1 deOliveira et al., 2017, Perti et al., 2016, Crosby et al., 2016, Chusri et al., 2014, Couturier et al., 2012, Tandale et al., 2009, Borgherini et al., 2007).",

The prevalence of comorbidities was measured by extracting the proportion of co-existing medical conditions from CHIKV cases and from severe disease outcome. Severe CHIKV was identified as cases that underwent ICU, those with acute diseases (e.g., acute encephalitis) and subjects with atypical CHIKV (atypical clinical manifestations of CHIKV include vesiculobullous lesions, febrile seizures, and meningoencephalitis), joints involvement (e.g., inflammatory joint destruction), hospitalization, and/or death. The primary outcome measure was to evaluate the overall prevalence of comorbidities in the CHIKV infection and stratify the estimates by severity. Weighted average was used to calculate the average age and the overall prevalence of clinical symptoms and comorbidities. Median age of the studies populations (\u223c50 years old) was used to categorize the CHIKV patients into two groups, below and above the median age. The weighted average prevalence of each comorbidity was calculated (\u00b1SD) within each group. Publication bias was assessed both by the visual inspection of funnel plot (Supplementary Figure S1) and by Egger\u2019s test. Egger\u2019s test is widely used to assess the tendency for the effects estimated in small sample size studies to differ from those estimated in larger studies. The results of Egger\u2019s test are presented in terms of bias coefficient. Publication bias was only observed in studies identified to estimate the proportion of cardiac diseases. Meta-analyses were carried out to assess the pooled prevalence (and 95% CI) of clinical symptoms and the proportions of each comorbidity in the overall and severe cases. Meta-analysis tests were conducted using Comprehensive Meta-Analysis software, CMA version 3.9 (Englewood, NJ, USA) (Borenstein, 2005). Variances of raw proportions or percentages were pooled based on a binary random-effects model (\u00c7o\u011faltay and Karada\u011f, 2015), given the population heterogeneity and assuming the relationships between comorbidities and CHIKV infections vary across populations. Forest plots were used to illustrate the prevalence of comorbidities in CHIKV from the selected studies in the entire patients and in severe cases.",

The Q test, however, does not report the extent of heterogeneity and has inadequate power to detect heterogeneity among the small number of studies identified for some comorbidities. Therefore, we calculated the I2 index to complement the Q test and describe the degree of between-study heterogeneity (Higgins and Thompson, 2002). I2 index values were categorized as low (0\u201330%), moderate (30\u201360%), substantial (60\u201390%), and considerable (>90%) as recommended (Liberati et al., 2009).

There was a small heterogeneity (Cochran\u2019s Q) in the estimates of clinical symptoms among the identified studies with an I\n2 index varied up to 56.8% (Table 1). As shown in Figure 2\n(panel A), hypertension was the most prevalent comorbidity in CHIKV infection (31.3% of the cases; 95% CI: 17.9-48.8%) followed by diabetes (20.5%; 95% CI: 12.7-31.3%), cardiac diseases (14.8%; 95% CI: 8.1-25.5%) and asthma (only in 7.9% of the cases; 95% CI: 3.3-17.7). Prevalence of obesity was reported only in one of the identified studies (Padmakumar et al., 2010). Characteristics of this study were mentioned in Table 1 but were excluded from any further meta-analysis given this limited data set. The prevalence of diabetes, hypertension, cardiac diseases and asthma varied by 25-, 5-, 28- and 50-fold among the identified studies, respectively. This wide among-studies variation in the proportion of comorbidities may have resulted in the heterogeneity (I\n2 index) observed for the estimates of comorbidities that varied from 25.1% to 96.4% (Figure 2). However, the true heterogeneity estimated by between-study variance in the random-effect model (\u03c42) was varied between 0.029 to 0.074 for the examined comorbidities. As shown in Table 2\n, the proportion of diabetes, hypertension and cardiac diseases was 4- to 5-fold higher (p <\n 0.05) in elder patients than their younger counterparts. We found a significant direct correlation between patients\u2019 age and the prevalence of diabetes (r\n = 0.65, p\n = 0.03), hypertension (r\n = 0.68, p\n = 0.033) and cardiac diseases (r\n = 0.65, p\n = 0.029) but inverse relationship (r\n = \u22120.88, p\n = 0.023) with asthma (data not shown).",

Meta-analysis of the data extracted from the identified studies (Figure 2) suggests that hypertension and diabetes are the most frequent comorbidities in patients with CHIKV infection with prevalence rates that varied from 20-30%. As expected, the prevalence of the examined chronic comorbidities was increased with age except for asthma. Although the reports identified here did not distinguish between the prevalence of type 1 and/or type 2 diabetes in CHIKV, results of the present study suggest an increased risk of developing severe CHIKV complications in people with diabetes (OR = 1.2; 95% CI: 1.05-1.48) than in those with other or no underlying chronic diseases. Similar observations were also reported in H1N1 (Badawi and Ryoo, 2016a), MERS-CoV (Badawi and Ryoo, 2016b) and influenza (Mertz et al., 2013). For example, a recent study noted that, compared to subjects with no comorbidities, severe pandemic influenza cases are significantly elevated with obesity (OR for mortality 2.74; 95% CI: 1.56-4.80), cardiovascular diseases (2.92; 95% CI: 1.76-4.86), hypertension (1.49; 95% CI: 1.10-2.01) and neuromuscular disease (2.68; 95% CI: 1.91-3.75) (Mertz et al., 2013). It may be worth noting that in CHIKV we identified only one study (Padmakumar et al., 2010) evaluating the effect of overweight on disease severity and this was not included in any of our meta-analyses. This study reported a significant association between overweight and CHIKV sequelae (OR = 1.3; 95% CI: 1.2-1.4) (Padmakumar et al., 2010). Chronic conditions influencing the severity of CHIKV such as diabetes were also noted to have similar effects in other respiratory illnesses (Badawi and Ryoo, 2016a, Badawi and Ryoo, 2016b, Mertz et al., 2013, Kusznierz et al., 2013). Furthermore, a number of case-control studies demonstrated the incidence of metabolic syndrome and related diseases, e.g., diabetes and hypertension, to be 2-fold higher in severe cases of dengue fever than in non-severe conditions (Fujimoto and Koifman, 2014, Pang et al., 2012).",

Comorbidities related to metabolic syndrome are thought to be etiologically linked to CHIKV pathogenesis. These disorders are known to downregulate key mediators of host innate immune response to pathogenesis. For example, diabetes, hyperglycemia and insulinopenia attenuate the synthesis of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IFN-\u03b3 and interleukins to functionally impair the innate and humoral immune systems of the host (Badawi and Ryoo, 2016a). Furthermore, the cytokine overload related to the Th1 to Th2 shift in severe viral infection, when accompanied by the increased cytokine synthesis from metabolic diseases, can be detrimental in synergistically affecting the endothelium and leads to a range of subsequent complications related to both the infectious and chronic conditions (Toledo et al., 2016). Furthermore, diabetes is known to impair macrophage and lymphocyte functions, subsequently reducing the host's immune response (Dooley and Chaisson, 2009). This was noted when increased levels of HbA1c (i.e., \u22659%) were linked to the severity of pneumonia (Akbar, 2001). While diabetes may impair the immune system leading to increased level and duration of viremia, heart conditions and hypertension were thought to facilitate the passage of neurotropic viruses, e.g., flavivirus, across the blood-brain barrier to predispose patients to neurologic complications (Jean et al., 2007).",

These factors may levy some limitations on the estimated contribution of chronic diseases to severe CHIKV cases and render our results as a guide to generate more accurate estimates for intervention strategies for infection in patients with chronic disorders. Furthermore, the small number of studies selected here did not allow us to evaluate the prevalence of chronic comorbidities in each outcome of the severe CHIKV cases.

However, even in the absence of causal inference between the non-communicable and infectious diseases, it may be justified that once non-severe episodes of infection are confirmed in subjects with diabetes that they remain under close surveillance to avert complications. This measure may prove important in averting severe disease outcome. Indeed, there are no current clear lines of prevention and treatment for CHIKV disease outside avoidance of mosquitoes and use of insect repellents. Coupling these practices with educating the public on the risk of severe infection can be an effective public health approach for the intervention of infection-related complications particularly in the middle- and low-income countries where the prevalence of chronic diseases is rising.",
