Molecular mimicry, the cross-activation of autoreactive T cells by mimic peptides from infectious agents, is a possible explanation for infectioninduced autoimmunity.

Clinical and epidemiological studies suggest that both genetic and environmental factors are important in the initiation and pathogenesis of MS [1] . Viral infections have been associated with other demyelinating CNS diseases, both in humans and animals [2] [3] [4] [5] , and various environmental factors have been associated with the initiation and exacerbation of MS, including viral infections [6, 7] . MS is believed to be mediated by myelin-specific CD4 + T cells. Although myelin-specific autoreactive T cells can be isolated from the blood of normal healthy individuals, they do not have an activated phenotype. Therefore, a critical question is how do these cells become activated in MS patients? One potential mechanism is molecular mimicry, whereby autoreactive T cells may be cross-activated by epitopes from infectious agents that share structural or sequence homology to self antigens [8, 9] . Direct evidence for molecular mimicry in human autoimmune disease is difficult to obtain and support is limited to demonstration of in vitro reactivation of myelin-specific T cell clones from MS patients by panels of antigens from infectious agents [10] . In this regard, molecular mimicry between the U24 protein of human herpesvirus-6 (HHV-6), a virus that may be associated with MS, and a candidate autoantigenic epitope for MS, MBP 96-102 , has recently been demonstrated [11] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 315, "end": 318, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 425, "end": 428, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 429, "end": 432, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 433, "end": 436, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 437, "end": 440, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 569, "end": 572, "text": "[6,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 573, "end": 575, "text": "7]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1070, "end": 1073, "text": "[8,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1074, "end": 1076, "text": "9]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1328, "end": 1332, "text": "[10]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1555, "end": 1559, "text": "[11]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "Therefore, better understanding of the potential mechanisms of molecular mimicry-induced autoreactive T cell activation is important in elucidating the pathogenesis of MS.

Therefore, the MHV+P peptide may \"target\" more \"PLP-specific\" cells (high IFN-c, moderate proliferation), rather than the MHV-specific cells (high proliferation, low IFN-c secretion).

It was postulated that the residue at p9 may be a critical susceptibility factor in I-A sassociated autoimmune disease with regard to presentation of self peptides [16] . To take this observation further and to attempt to understand the differences in PLP 139-151 -specific T cell cross-activating potential between the HI 574-586 and MHV 3821-3832 mimic peptides, we sought to determine the influence of the p9 MHC class II proline anchor residue in molecular mimicry between the \"self\" PLP 139-151 epitope and foreign viral antigens. Secondly, we wanted to establish whether viral delivery of the MHV mimic peptide could overcome the threshold necessary for cross-reactive activation of pathogenic, autoreactive PLP-specific Th1 cells similar to what we had previously reported for disease induction by the HI 574-586 mimic peptide.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 124, "end": 128, "text": "[16]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 295, "end": 299, "text": "[16]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Both PLP 139-151 and HI 574-586 have a proline residue (P, aliphatic) at p9 in the MHC class II ligand motif, whereas MHV 3821-3832 contains asparagine (N, amidic) . Interestingly, substitution of the secondary MHC class II contact residue at p9 (N?P) conferred an ability on the MHV peptide to induce stronger cross-reactive PLP 139-151 -specific T cell responses, as measured by T cell proliferation or IFN-c ELISA assays. In contrast, substitution of P?N at p9 of the HI mimic peptide (HI-P) abrogated the ability of that peptide to induce cross-activation of PLP 139-151 -specific T cells. In each case, mice made the most robust response to the immunizing peptide, as expected, but the gain or loss of proline at p9 either induced or negated the \"mimic potential\" of the peptide, respectively. Interestingly, mice immunized to MHV responded more strongly to recall with HI-P than HI, probably as neither peptide contained P at p9. Conversely, only MHV+P and not MHV peptide recall challenge induced IFN-c production by T cells from HI 574-586 -immunized mice, likely due to the presence of P at p9 in both peptides. Although mice responded with robust IFN-c responses to their initial immunizing peptide, only mice with a strong PLP 139-151 response (i.e., PLP 139-151 -immunized mice) exhibited clinical EAE. As the mimic peptide-specific T cells were shown to be competent IFN-c producers this suggests that they do not recognize or are not sufficiently reactivated in vivo in the CNS by endogenously presented PLP peptides and therefore do not induce clinical EAE [20] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1572, "end": 1576, "text": "[20]", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 152, "end": 163, "text": "(N, amidic)", "ref_id": null}], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Although immunization with the MHV+P peptide did not induce clinical disease, we further demonstrated its increased cross-reactivity to PLP compared to MHV, by peptide-coupled splenocyte tolerance studies.

Previously, we demonstrated the importance of studying PLP-mimic peptides in the context of a concomitant infection [12, 13] . Here, we corroborate this hypothesis as infection of mice with TMEV engineered to express the 30-mer MHV peptide induces a chronic autoimmune disease characterized by atypical clinical symptoms, similar in severity and time course to disease initiated with PLPor HI-expressing TMEV [12, 13, 21] . In contrast MHV/ CFA-immunized mice do not develop disease. This is likely due to the fact that MHV30-BeAn-infected mice develop a robust IFN-c-secreting PLP 139-151 -specific T cell population, unlike MHV/CFA-immunized mice. It is likely that activation of peripheral and central immune cells by TMEV infection provides innate immune stimuli that can overcome the threshold for activation of PLP 139-151 -specific T cells by the MHV peptide. Interestingly, Th1 recall responses, particularly IFN-c, to the self PLP 139-151 epitope were significantly higher in MHV30-BeAn-infected mice than were responses to the MHV mimic peptide itself. This likely reflects prolonged restimulation of high-avidity PLP 139-151 -specific CD4 + T cells by self peptide endogenously released as a consequence of chronic myelin damage presented locally in the CNS by infiltrating dendritic cells [22] , and the increased affinity of PLP 139-151 (IC 50 87 nM) for I-A s compared to MHV 3821-3832 (IC 50 727 nM) [15] . We also observed modest numbers of CD4 + T cells in the brain of MHV30-BeAn mice on day 40 post infection, in contrast to OVA-BeAn-infected mice, suggesting that the presence of MHV-specific T cells correlates with the early onset of disease observed in MHV30-BeAn mice. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the MHV mimic peptide is a natural epitope for the SJL mouse as infection with MHV30-BeAn encoding the MHV 30-mer mimic sequence could be processed and presented by APC as measured by in vivo DTH responses.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 324, "end": 328, "text": "[12,", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 329, "end": 332, "text": "13]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 617, "end": 621, "text": "[12,", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 622, "end": 625, "text": "13,", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 626, "end": 629, "text": "21]", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 1509, "end": 1513, "text": "[22]", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 1623, "end": 1627, "text": "[15]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "In conclusion, this study demonstrates that the secondary MHC class II (I-A s ) anchor residue at p9 plays a critical role in the ability of PLP 139-151 mimic peptides to induce molecular mimicry leading to induction of CNS autoimmune disease and may be an important consideration when identifying candidate mimic peptides encoded by infectious pathogens.
