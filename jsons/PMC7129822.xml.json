            "text": "It has been reported that PCV2 entered wild boar from avian species, and subsequently transmitted to pigs(Firth et al., 2009). Despite an increasing number of available sequences, the origin and transmission patterns of PCVs remain obscure. At the same time, there is controversy regarding the evolutionary relationship between circoviruses and their hosts. While particular studies have suggested co-speciation between circovirus and host (Johne et al., 2006), other studies indicate that these viruses may be introduced to new hosts through cross-species transmission (Firth et al., 2009; He et al., 2019a). The increasing availability of sampling and sequences data offers an important opportunity to reconstruct the origin and transmission patterns of PCVs. Here, we analysed 95 circovirus Rep from different hosts retrieved from GenBank (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) to trace the origin and evolutionary history of PCV (Table S1). Based on a maximum likelihood (ML) tree of the conserved Rep sequences from multiple hosts inferred using RAxML (v4.8.10), we found that PCV1 and PCV2 cluster together, while PCV3 represents a more divergent lineage from PCV1 and PCV2 (Fig. 1a) (Stamatakis, 2014). PCV3 clusters with BatCV in line with our previous report (Li et al., 2018c). Additionally, PCV1 and PCV2 may have originated from bat circovirus (BatCV), however not from the bat clade 2 because they are related to a novel bat genotype (Wu et al., 2016). These results are also confirmed by a Bayesian tree reconstructed using MrBayes (v3.8.2) with a mixed model and a sample size of 2,000,000 and a sample frequency of 200 (Fig. 1b). In addition, we performed selection analysis based on the ML tree and we identified positive selection in some branches (Fig. 1). In particular, we found positive selection in the branch (red branch) of the diversification of BatCV and PCV (Fig. 1) using DATAMONKEY (http://www.datamonkey.org/), suggesting that the transmission of circovirus between bats and the porcine host resulted in adaptation to pigs. Then PCV diverged into PCV1 and PCV2, moreover causing huge economic losses to the pig industry.",

After RDP4 analysis, one bat circovirus was detected by a potential recombinant between BatCV and PCV2. To confirm this, we observed the sequences characteristic and reconstructed a phylogenetic tree using recombined and non-recombined regions separated by the potential recombination breakpoint (the 777th nucleotide) (Fig. 2b). The position of the BatCV (YN/ZQ924) sequence varies in the two trees. The non-recombined region of the BatCV (YN/ZQ924) sequence clusters with other BatCVs. However, the recombined region clusters with PCV2. This indicates that BatCV recombined with PCV2 in the REP gene, suggesting that bats might be co-infected with PCV to form a new BatCV. Although it is not clear if this recombination facilitated the cross-species transmission of the virus, it suggests that virus transmission and recombination occurred between bats and pigs (Zhou et al., 2018). We can speculate that bat-originated DNA viruses can recombine and cross-species transmission concomitant with the migration, co-roosting and intra- or inter-species contact of other hosts. Our result suggests that the emergence and host range expansion of circoviruses could be the result of the close contact of domestic and wild pigs. Indeed, PCVs are highly prevalent in China while closely-related bat CVs have been sequenced from Southern China (Fig. 1 and Table S1) where there is a large number of pig slaughterhouses and a wide distribution and diversity of bat species displaying unique behaviour including characteristic flight patterns, mobility, diet, and roosting. This, together with the constant interaction of pig and humans, presents a potential threat to the pig industry and public health.",

Overall, we provide new insights into the evolution of CVs in different hosts and unravel transmission/recombination events between pigs and other hosts. Due to the special bat migration ecology and pig farming methods, the transmission models and instances of evolutionary adaptation need to be meticulously researched in the future. Given the fact that bats carry a variety of viruses with human infection potential and that pigs can act as adaptive intermediates for bat pathogens, it is important to monitor these animal species in China for the potential of the emergence of novel zoonosis.",
