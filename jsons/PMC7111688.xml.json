The traditional group 1, 2, and 3 coronaviruses have been replaced with three genera designated Alphacoronavirus, Betacoronavirus, and Gammacoronavirus, respectively. In recent years, a group of novel coronaviruses was identified in Asian leopard cats and some avian species (Dong et al., 2007, Woo et al., 2009) and they were proposed to represent a new coronavirus genus, i.e. the fourth genus Deltacoronavirus (Woo et al., 2010). During a molecular surveillance study conducted by a Hong Kong group, additional deltacoronaviruses were identified in avian and mammalian species including two porcine CoVs (HKU-15-44 and HKU-15-155) detected in pig samples collected in 2009 (Woo et al., 2012). Hereby, five coronaviruses have been identified in pigs: porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), and porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV) in the genus Alphacoronavirus; porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus (PHEV) in the genus Betacoronavirus; and porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV) in the genus Deltacoronavirus.",

PDCoV has also recently been detected in South Korea (Lee and Lee, 2014). It remains unclear when PDCoV was introduced into the US, but a recent PCR-based retrospective evaluation of diagnostic samples revealed that PDCoV could be detected as early as August 2013 in pig samples from the US (Sinha et al., unpublished data). The US PDCoV sequences determined thus far share high nucleotide identity (\u226599.8%), with 98.9\u201399.2% nucleotide identity to the Hong Kong strains, and 99.6\u201399.8% nucleotide identity to the Korean strain, at the whole genome level (Lee and Lee, 2014, Li et al., 2014, Marthaler et al., 2014a, Marthaler et al., 2014b, Wang et al., 2014a, Wang et al., 2014b, Woo et al., 2012). The genome organization and arrangement of PDCoV are in the order of: 5\u2032 untranslated region (UTR), open reading frame 1a/1b (ORF1a/1b), spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), nonstructural protein 6 (NS 6), nucleocapsid (N), nonstructural protein 7 (NS 7), and 3\u2032 UTR (Li et al., 2014, Woo et al., 2012).",

In this paper, the development of PDCoV peptide-specific rabbit antisera and the use of these antisera in immunofluorescence and immunohistochemistry assays for PDCoV detection are described. Additionally, 5-day-old piglets were experimentally inoculated with a plaque-purified US PDCoV cell culture isolate to characterize the pathogenicity and pathogenesis of this virus.",

Sera collected at Day 28, 56, 72 and 90 from one rabbit (#8005) immunized with the PDCoV M-peptide yielded positive IFA staining at 1:100, 1:200 or 1:500 dilutions.

One representative image is shown in Fig. 1B. Sera at Day 0 were IFA negative. Similarly, sera collected at Day 28, 56, 72 and 90 from one rabbit (#8049) immunized with the PDCoV S-peptide were IFA positive (Fig. 1D). However, even after optimization of serum dilutions, the PDCoV S-peptide rabbit antisera still produced stronger background staining in the negative control ST cells (Fig. 1H) compared to the negative control ST cells tested by the PDCoV M-peptide rabbit antisera (Fig. 1F). Sera collected from the second rabbit immunized with the PDCoV M-peptide, from the second rabbit immunized with the PDCoV S-peptide, and from two rabbits immunized with the PDCoV N peptide, were always IFA negative regardless of collection date or dilutions.

The first two approaches could take longer time to obtain the desired antibody reagents. In contrast, it is easier to synthesize peptides and generate peptide-specific antibody in less time. In this study, we took the latter approach to generate PDCoV M-, N-, and S-peptide-specific antisera in rabbits. As early as 28 days post immunization, PDCoV M-peptide-specific and S-peptide-specific rabbit antisera with high antibody titers were obtained and the antibody titers remained through 90 days post primary immunization. However, the sera generated from one of the two rabbits immunized with the PDCoV M-peptide or the PDCoV S-peptide, and the sera from two rabbits immunized with the PDCoV N peptide were negative by IFA in PDCoV-infected cells. Interestingly, all of the rabbit antisera contained high concentrations of antibodies against the corresponding target peptides when evaluated in an ELISA using the synthetic peptides as coating antigens (data not shown). This suggests that anti-peptide antibodies generated in some rabbits may not recognize and react with the natively expressed virus proteins. The PDCoV M-peptide rabbit antiserum was used for further evaluation and it specifically reacted to PDCoV but not to other porcine coronaviruses such as PEDV, TGEV, and PRCV. The PDCoV-specific immunofluorescence assay and IHC assay developed in this study provide additional tools to confirm virus isolation results, to determine virus distribution and cellular localization in tissues, and to facilitate study on PDCoV pathogenesis.",

Clinical materials positive for PDCoV by PCR are not ideal to evaluate viral pathogenicity because, although the clinical materials can be proved negative for the common enteric pathogens such as PEDV, TGEV, rotavirus etc., there is no absolute certainty that they do not contain other unknown pathogens. In contrast, plaque-purified cell culture isolate of PDCoV can be utilized to more precisely investigate PDCoV pathogenicity and clinical outcomes. Ideally, the pathogenicity and pathogenesis of PDCoV should be examined in pigs at different production stages (e.g. gilts, sows, weaned pigs, and neonatal pigs etc.). In the present study, 5-day-old neonatal pigs were chosen as the first step of these investigations because it is generally recognized that neonatal pigs are more sensitive than pigs at other production stages to infection with the swine enteric coronaviruses PEDV and TGEV.",

Average weight gain was also not significantly affected by PDCoV infection during the study period. Diarrhea was transient in PDCoV-inoculated pigs. Virus shedding in feces was not detected by PCR for 48 h post-inoculation and was then detected in 10%, 40%, 80% and 100% of rectal swabs at 2, 3, 4, 5\u20137 DPI, respectively, with average virus titers gradually increasing from 2 to 7 DPI, indicating that PDCoV infection progressed slowly under the conditions of this report. This study was terminated at 7 DPI in efforts to adequately capture gross and microscopic lesions caused by PDCoV infection; however, it would be interesting to investigate virus shedding dynamics in future studies by extending the duration of the study. Results from this study may help guide future PDCoV experimental designs as the clinical diarrhea and virus shedding patterns following PDCoV infection in the present study were distinctly different from published studies on PEDV and TGEV infections. While not a direct comparison to the pigs used in the present study, caesarian-derived-colostrum-deprived (CDCD) piglets at 1\u20133 days old inoculated with PEDV CV777 strain (2 ml of 104 pig infectious doses), Korean PEDV isolate SNUVR971496 (2\u00d7106.5\n TCID50), or US/Iowa/18984/2013 PEDV isolate (103 plaque forming units), developed diarrhea at 12\u201324 hours post inoculation (hpi) (Debouck et al., 1981, Kim and Chae, 2003, Madson et al., 2015) and all CDCD pigs inoculated with a US virulent PEDV shed virus in rectal swabs as early as 24 hpi (Madson et al., 2015). One-day old CDCD piglets inoculated with a Korean strain or two American strains of TGEV (2\u00d7106.5\n TCID50) developed diarrhea at 24\u201336 hpi (Kim and Chae, 2002). Even in 5-day-old na\u00efve neonatal piglets, the same pig model as used in the present study, three US virulent PEDV isolates caused severe diarrhea after 24 hpi and 100% of piglets shed virus in rectal swabs at 24 hpi (Chen et al., unpublished data).",

            "text": "Gross lesions consistent with virus infection were observed in the small intestines, ceca and colons of some PDCoV-inoculated pigs at both 4 and 7 DPI; however, histopathological lesions were only observed in small intestines. Pigs necropsied at 4 and 7 DPI tested negative for other enteric viral pathogens such as PEDV, TGEV, and porcine rotaviruses (groups A, B and C) and negative for enteric bacterial pathogens hemolytic E. coli and Salmonella. Although PRRSV and PCV2 are mainly respiratory rather than enteric pathogens, they can cause lethargy and occasional diarrhea. Pigs necropsied at 4 and 7 DPI were tested for PRRSV and PCV2 by virus-specific PCRs and were negative. These data indicate that the observed gross lesions and histopathological lesions in PDCoV-inoculated pigs were not due to concurrent infections with other known pathogens. Histopathological lesions and IHC staining were mainly observed in the middle and distal jejunum and ileum of the PDCoV-inoculated pigs, suggesting that middle and distal jejunum and ileum are better intestinal segments than duodenum and proximal jejunum for microscopic and IHC evaluations. This information is useful for choosing appropriate tissues for PDCoV diagnostic investigations. In this study, PDCoV viral antigen was detected by IHC in the villous epithelial cells of small intestines but was not detected in cecum, colon or other examined tissues. In contrast, PEDV viral antigen could be detected in mesenteric lymph node and some percentage of colon and spleen tissues (Jung et al., 2014, Madson et al., 2015).",

Previous studies also showed that PEDV viremia can occur in the acute stage of infection (Jung et al., 2014, Madson et al., 2015). However, it remains unclear if the PDCoV and PEDV detected in serum are present as free virus or cell-associated. Relatively high levels PDCoV RNA were detected in cecum, colon, mesenteric lymph node and stomach. However, the significance of these findings is unclear as no microscopic lesions or IHC staining was observed in these tissues. It is well known that IHC has lower analytical sensitivity than PCR and this may be one potential explanation for this difference in detection. Another possibility is that PDCoV RNA was present in gastric or fecal content that was included into the tissue homogenate during tissue processing for PCR but was not present within the actual tissue. Low levels of PDCoV RNA were detected in other tissues including tonsil, lung, heart, liver, spleen, kidney, skeletal muscle, and diaphragm, yet the significance of these findings is unknown and it is unsure if this was due to effect of viremia.",

These direct detection assays will be a valuable tool not only for future research purpose but also for confirming PDCoV-associated disease in field cases submitted to veterinary diagnostic laboratories. The pathogenic potential of PDCoV was confirmed as naive pigs developed mild to moderate diarrhea, shed virus in rectal swabs, and developed macroscopic and microscopic lesions in small intestines with viral antigen confirmed within lesions by IHC staining. However, under the condition of this report, the outcomes of PDCoV infection appear to be less severe than those caused by virulent PEDV and TGEV infections. The susceptibility of pigs at different stages of production to PDCoV infection, effect of virus administration dose, the duration of virus shedding, and the immune responses induced by PDCoV infection warrant further investigations.",
