This is especially true in the 21st century, the golden age of the \u201cgo global\u201d strategy for Chinese companies. Despite the financial crisis of 2008 and 2009 and weak outbound investment worldwide, China\u2019s OFDI flows have seen significant gains, growing ever more diverse in terms of investment destinations, industries and investment methods. However, the aftermath of the global financial crisis and the growing trend of anti-globalization in western countries has created new challenges for the globalization of Chinese enterprises.",

Through such research, CCG aims to decode existing patterns and map out the future direction of globalizing Chinese enterprises. This analysis helps CCG provide strategic, far-sighted recommendations to overcome the challenges Chinese enterprises face in the process of globalization. This work is a useful reference for enterprises, governments, and other research institutes. Moreover, CCG offers an open, inclusive and cooperative platform, as a think tank serving as a connecting point between research and recipient, providing intellectual support for the globalization of Chinese enterprises.",

Both quantitative and qualitative research methods are used to analyze the features of Chinese enterprises\u2019 globalization. This analysis provides a reliable reference for enterprises that have already gone global and those that plan to. In particular, this book investigates challenges confronted by Chinese companies when doing business in foreign countries. It summarizes research covering three angles, namely: the current situation, causation analysis and corresponding solutions, and recommendations for firms, government departments and other institutions. This book mainly focuses on the globalization of Chinese enterprises from 2014 to 2017.",

In 2014, many factors led to a decrease in global FDI flows, including the US draw down of quantitative easing, geopolitical crises in Eastern Europe and the Middle East, and the imbalanced recovery of the Euro Zone. After a one-year increase in 2015, the dominant causes of decreasing FDI over 2016 and 2017 appear to be the slow recovery of global markets and the rise of anti-globalization and protectionist policies and measures. Not only did FDI continue to fall in this period, the FDI drop in 2017 was also more severe compared to 2016.",

In Europe, elections in certain countries reflected a right-wing shift, hindering the progress of globalization. Furthermore, some European and North American countries strengthened their supervision and set up approval mechanisms for FDI.
