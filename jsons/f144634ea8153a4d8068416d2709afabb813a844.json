National immunization programs have prevented millions of deaths since WHO initiated the 'Expanded Program on Immunization' in 1974. Smallpox was eradicated in 1979, poliomyelitis is on the verge of eradication, and two thirds of developing countries have eliminated neonatal tetanus. Global immunization coverage was at 78% in 2005. Through their impact on childhood morbidity and mortality, immunization programs are contributing to reaching the 'Millennium Development Goal 4' -a two-thirds reduction of under-five mortality by 2015. However, the failure to reach more than 20% of the world's children with existing vaccines was responsible for at least 2.5 million of an estimated 10.5 million deaths of children under 5 years, mainly in developing countries. Of these deaths, 1.4 million could have been prevented by vaccines currently recommended by WHO. Rapid progress in our understanding of the pathogenesis of infectious diseases, immunology, and biotechnology has increased the number of candidate vaccine antigens available. Pressures are growing on public health decision makers to establish evidence-based ways to decide which new vaccines should be introduced on a large scale into national immunization programs. The gap in access to new vaccines between the developing and industrialized worlds is still wide, and wealthy countries are still the first to introduce and use new vaccines. Interest from countries and partner agencies in vaccination, as one of the most cost-effective public health interventions, continues to be strong, also due to rapid progress in biotechnology and vaccine development and the emergence of global infectious disease threats, including HIV/AIDS, SARS, and influenza. The establishment of the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization has focused global activities to support vaccination programs through raising considerable funds, and to assist especially poorer countries in improving and expanding their vaccination programs. Global efforts concentrate on further reducing the gap in the access to all existing vaccines between industrialized and developing countries.",

Smallpox was eradicated in 1979 [4] , poliomyelitis is on the verge of eradication [5] , and two thirds of developing countries have eliminated neonatal tetanus (NT). 1 Global immunization coverage, as measured by the reported infant coverage with the third dose of diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis (DTP) vaccine (DTP3), was at 78% worldwide in 2005 [6] ( Fig. 1) , as compared to 20% in 1980. By the end of 2004, 153 of 192 WHO Member States had introduced hepatitis B (HepB) vaccine and 92 countries had introduced Haemophilus influenzae type b vaccine (Hib) into routine infant vaccination programs [7, 8] , even though both vaccines are still underused in developing countries. The estimated number of deaths (from measles, pertussis and NT) prevented through childhood immunization in 2003 was more than 2 million. Infant HepB vaccination in 2003 was estimated to prevent a future 600 000 adult deaths, which would have occurred without vaccination, due to chronic liver disease and liver cancer.",

Programs in wealthy countries recognize and mostly adhere to global vaccination goals set by WHO, and address 1 potential life years saved through vaccination in cost-effectiveness analyses. Main motivators for vaccination programs in industrialized countries are morbidity reduction and improvements in quality of life, indirect societal savings and also moral causes [12] . As for vaccination programs anywhere in the world, the access to the best and most effective vaccines available is seen as a right of every child. Rapid progress in understanding of infectious disease pathogenesis, immunology, and biotechnology has increased the number of candidate vaccine antigens available, many of which have entered clinical phases of testing for safety, immunogenicity and eventually efficacy. Pressures are growing on public health decision makers, advisers and implementers to establish transparent and evidence-based ways to decide which new vaccines can and should be introduced on a large scale into national immunization programs. While the gap in access to new vaccines between the developing and industrialized world remains wide (see below), rich countries are still the first to introduce and use new vaccines. This is illustrated by the recent licensing of the first human papilloma virus (HPV) vaccine (see later in this chapter), the second possibly cancer-preventive vaccine since HepB. HPV vaccine is now being recommended by the Advisory Committee of Immunization Practices to be included into the U.S. immunization program.",

Among others, the goals called for were: -by 2010, achieve 90% coverage of children under 1 year of age nationally in each country, with at least 80% coverage in every district; -by 2010, reduce measles mortality by 90% compared to the 2000 levels, and -by 2015, reduce overall morbidity and mortality from vaccine-preventable diseases by two-thirds compared to the 2000 level. 3 Table 1 shows the 'basic' immunization schedule recommended by the EPI/ WHO [15] , which is followed in low-income and most lower middle-income 4 developing countries. Schedules in most upper middle-and high-income countries start later (e.g., 2 months), with longer intervals between doses [16, 17] . While the basic EPI schedule, with some variation, is still followed by many developing countries, vaccination schedules in middle-income and industrialized countries vary considerably, for historical, epidemiological, and economical reasons (compare the 2006 U.S. Child and Adolescent Immunization Schedule, Table 2 ). WHO keeps track of and publishes national immunization schedules [18] . To protect mothers and neonates against tetanus, WHO recommends implementing a five-dose tetanus toxoid (TT) schedule [19] for women of childbearing age, especially where most women in this age group have not previously received TT when they were young [20] . The different EPI contacts during the first year of life present opportunities for health education of mothers and caretakers and to deliver other basic health care interventions. For example, the measles contact at 9 months of age is used in many developing countries to administer vitamin A to children.",

To maximize returns of scarce resources, however, WHO recommends considering adding booster doses to immunization programs once they have reached routine coverage levels of 80% or higher. Boosting with BCG is not recommended, as there is no evidence of its efficacy [22] . Since many developing countries have now reached 80% coverage, they have begun to include booster doses in their schedules, based on epidemiological patterns of diseases, available resources, and health infrastructure. Events like the diphtheria epidemic in Eastern Europe in the early 1990s, or the recognition that pertussis-infected adults contribute to community spread [23] triggered renewed interest in, and importance attached to, booster doses. While high coverage with one dose of measles vaccine will reduce measles morbidity and mortality, a second vaccine dose is needed for more efficient measles reduction, or to achieve measles elimination [24] . This 'second opportunity' for measles vaccination is not intended as a true 'booster dose' but to give a second chance to seroconvert for children who did not respond to the first dose, and also to reach children who missed the first dose. Increasingly, additional measles vaccine doses in developing countries, intended to reduce measles mortality or to move towards measles elimination, are delivered through campaigns. As the EPI programs mature, WHO encourages adopting routine two-dose measles schedules, to sustain gains in measles mortality reduction [25] .",

More recently, SIAs are no longer used mainly to boost overall coverage, but have become the main tools for disease eradication and elimination initiatives -to achieve global polio eradication, reduce measles mortality, mainly in Africa, for measles elimination (in WHO Regions with a measles elimination goal [25] ), and for TT campaigns to eliminate MNT, targeting child-bearing age women.

This vaccination strategy component is particularly critical in tropical developing countries, where logistics and lack of reliable power supply and refrigeration equipment are frequent problems. The WHO recommends that the storage temperature for vaccines used in the EPI at health facilities be between 2 \u00b0C and 8 \u00b0C, a temperature range determined by the heat sensitivity of oral poliovaccine (OPV) and sensitivity to freezing of other vaccines (DTP, TT, HepB). Live vaccines (OPV, measles, BCG, yellow fever) can be stored in freezers at -20 \u00b0C. UNICEF and WHO, in collaboration with manufacturers, have set standards [31] for technologically appropriate cold-chain equipment and helped to develop such equipment, such as ice-lined refrigerators, which can maintain appropriate storage temperature for up to 16 h during power cuts, or refrigerators run on kerosene, gas and solar power in areas without grid electricity. Vaccine temperature is monitored over time during international and domestic vaccine transport using temperature-sensitive cards. More recently, vaccine vial monitors (VVMs) [32], attached to each vial of vaccine procured through UNICEF, have greatly facilitated vaccine use in the field, particularly to extend the 'cold chain' into remote areas during polio eradication campaigns. VVMs measure and indicate 'cumulative' heat exposure by changing color once vaccine potency is threatened. It was realized more recently that inappropriate freezing of freeze-sensitive vaccines is also a problem in many countries, potentially affecting the potency of vaccines with adjuvants (HepB, combination vaccines) [33] .",

While modern vaccines are safe and effective, no vaccine is entirely without risk. Effective vaccines may produce some undesirable side effects, which are mostly mild and self limited. Many of the adverse events attributed to the administration of a vaccine are actually not caused by the vaccine, but are either due to programmatic or human error (particularly in developing countries), or are simply coincidental events, which are not causally related to vaccine administration [34] . Surveillance for adverse events following immunization (AEFIs) in many developing countries has confirmed that most adverse events temporally associated with vaccination were not causally but only incidentally associated with vaccination. In cases where the vaccine of the vaccination program is the cause of an AEFI, events resulting from inappropriate handling of vaccines ('program error') are much more common than severe events related to properties of the vaccine itself [35] . Examples for reported serious adverse events related to program error are vaccine reconstitution with the wrong diluent, administration of dangerous drugs for vaccines, contamination of multi-dose vials leading to abscesses or sepsis, or transmission of blood-borne diseases (HIV, hepatitis B or C) through contaminated needles or syringes. If allegations regarding vaccine-related AEFIs are not rapidly and effectively investigated and clarified, confidence in a vaccine or the immunization program can quickly be undermined, even if the vaccine or the vaccination program is not at fault, with possible dramatic consequences for acceptance of vaccination and disease incidence.",

The measles network's primary roles are confirmation of suspected measles cases using IgM testing and genetic characterization of measles viruses. Measles laboratories also perform serological diagnosis of yellow fever in countries in Africa and Latin America where yellow fever is prevalent.

Public health systems in sub-Saharan Africa are overwhelmed by the increasing burden of HIV/AIDS, exacerbated by HIV-related illnesses, absenteeism and deaths among health workers. Since overall 'system-wide barriers' such as human resource capacity, logistics and overall financial resources seriously affect immunization services, these barriers will need to be addressed in joint action with all other parts of the health sector. However, efforts to strengthen immunization services can also help to reduce overall barriers to the equitable delivery of health services, for example by capitalizing on the well-established access of immunization services to children and women. Linkage of immunization contacts with routine health checks, or with the delivery of other essential health interventions, such as vitamin A, de-worming treatments and insecticide-treated bed nets to prevent malaria, has considerable impact on child health and reducing child mortality.",

This latter target has been achieved [61a] as a result of efforts in high-measles-burden countries, with the support of the 'Measles Partnership'. Global measles control is based on four main strategies [62] : -achieving high routine immunization coverage with measles vaccine given at 9 months of age -providing a 'second opportunity' for measles vaccination either through the routine immunization program or measles SIAs targeting the age group in which most susceptibles have accumulated, both to increase the chance that children not vaccinated before now get a dose of measles vaccine, and to allow children who did not sero-convert to the first dose to gain immunity -establishing an effective system to monitor coverage and conduct measles surveillance with integration of epidemiological and laboratory information -improving clinical management of every measles case, e.g., administering",

Despite this impressive progress, the goal of eliminating MNT by 2005 has not yet been achieved. While MNT has been essentially eliminated in the Americas and northern Africa [64] as of end-2005, 49 countries remained that were considered as not having eliminated MNT, including large countries like China, India and Nigeria [65] . Main reasons for missing the global elimination goal are continued relatively low TT coverage of pregnant and child-bearing age women: opportunities to vaccinate pregnant women visiting antenatal clinics or other health centers offering immunization are frequently missed.

The impact of a vaccine, particularly if administered to young adolescents, will not be measurable for decades to come -the amount of time it would take for girls to reach an age when they might otherwise have developed cancer. Socio-cultural issues regarding the vaccination of pre-adolescent and adolescent with HPV vaccine will need to be addressed with great sensitivity. Studies are under way to prepare for HPV vaccine use in developing countries, particularly to find out which sociocultural factors will determine vaccine acceptance and reaching sufficient coverage.

            "text": "The status of development of new vaccines against TB can illustrate the hurdles of new vaccine development in general. The existing BCG vaccine is the most frequently used vaccine worldwide, is low in cost, and protects infants against severe forms of disease, such as TB meningitis and miliary TB. However, the efficacy of BCG against pulmonary forms of disease is variable [96] . Genomic sequencing of Mycobacterium tuberculosis has opened the way towards a more rational approach to screening for antigens with protective capacity against TB. Promising approaches to TB vaccine development include protein subunit vaccines, DNA vaccines expressing protective M. tuberculosis genes, rationally attenuated live M. tuberculosis vaccines and modifications to BCG to boost its immunogenic properties. New live mycobacterial vaccines will benefit from the experience with BCG and BCG production; candidate vaccines are likely to have both good priming and initial protection. Like BCG, they also are expected to provide an adjuvant effect for other vaccines given at the same time. The main issues with new live mycobacterial vaccines relate to quality control and mutant stability. These new vaccines will have to be as safe as BCG, but at the same time significantly more efficacious, which will make it difficult to assess them clinically.",

Main concerns for sub-unit vaccines are that repeated use of the same vectors (such as MVA-antigen 85A) may decrease their efficacy, and adjuvants may be needed to obtain the protective effect, which will most likely increase cost. There is also some concern about risk of enhancement of pathology. The most effective future TB vaccination strategy may be to combine different vaccine candidates, using a prime-boost approach, as described in a recent comprehensive review [97] of 'state of the art' and future perspectives of TB vaccine development.",
