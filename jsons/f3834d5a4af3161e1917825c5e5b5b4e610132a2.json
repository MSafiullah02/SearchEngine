Herein we provide preclinical proof-of-concept for the treatment of liver failure through hepatocyte transplantation into lymph nodes in a large-animal model of hereditary tyrosinemia type 1 (HT1), a metabolic liver disease caused by deficiency of fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase (FAH) enzyme. FAH-deficient pigs received autologous hepatocyte transplantation into mesenteric lymph nodes after ex vivo transduction with a lentiviral vector carrying the pig Fah gene. Hepatocytes showed early (6 hour) and durable (8 month) engraftment in lymph nodes, with reproduction of vascular and hepatic microarchitecture. Subsequently, hepatocytes migrated to and repopulated the native diseased liver. The corrected cells generated enough liver mass to clinically ameliorate disease as early as 97 days post-transplantation, with complete normalization of tyrosine levels and liver function tests. Integration site analysis defined the corrected hepatocytes in the liver as a subpopulation of hepatocytes in the lymph nodes, indicating that the lymph nodes served as a source for healthy hepatocytes to repopulate a diseased liver. Ectopic transplantation of hepatocytes cures the pig model of HT1 and presents a promising approach to the treatment of liver disease in patients with pre-existing liver damage and fibrosis.",

Bioartificial liver devices and repopulation of decellularized liver scaffolds to create bioengineered organs for transplantation have yet to prove effective for the treatment of patients with liver failure. Cell therapy using primary hepatocytes has shown effectiveness in animal models, but the success of this approach has been very limited in the clinical setting. (2) One of the main reasons for this limited success is the inflammation, fibrosis, and scar tissue obstructing blood flow in the failing liver, which constitutes an adverse environment for hepatocyte engraftment and growth. (3) Hereditary tyrosinemia type 1 (HT1) is an ideal disease model to study treatment options for acute and chronic liver failure in the preclinical environment. HT1 is an inborn error of metabolism of the liver caused by a deficiency of the fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase (FAH) enzyme, which is responsible for the last step of tyrosine catabolism and results in the inability to completely metabolize tyrosine.(4) Untreated, HT1 often leads to fulminant liver failure as early as a few months of life. (5) In the chronic form of the disease, FAH deficiency leads to persistent accumulation of toxic metabolites in the liver, causing oxidative damage and subsequent inflammation, fibrosis, cirrhosis along with high rates of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). (6, 7) In HT1, inflammatory changes and liver injury are seen within days to weeks without therapy.",

(8) We have previously created and characterized the porcine model of HT1 and showed that this animal is an excellent model of acute and chronic liver failure by reproducing the inflammation, fibrosis and cirrhosis pattern seen in many human liver diseases (9) . We have since demonstrated that ex vivo gene therapy involving lentiviral transfer of a functional Fah cDNA into autologous hepatocytes is curative in both mouse and pig models of HT1. (10) In our previous work, primary hepatocytes were isolated from a partial hepatectomy and transduced ex vivo by a lentiviral vector carrying a functional human Fah gene. Once corrected, cells were transplanted back into the donor animal via portal vein infusion. However, a substantial clinical limitation to our previous approach is that orthotopic hepatocyte transplantation may not be feasible in patients with acute or chronic liver disease, as the diseased liver is often an inadequate and hostile environment for hepatocyte engraftment and expansion. (11) Alternative anatomical sites for transplantation of corrected cells could provide a healthier milieu to enable hepatocyte engraftment and proliferation. Lymph nodes are one such alternative site due to several defining characteristics. For example, they are prepared to harbor rapid expansion of T and B cells to support a swift immune response when needed. (12, 13) Lymph nodes are not only capable of accommodating immune cells, but are also a common metastatic site for many types of cancer. (14) They naturally provide a favorable environment for metastatic cell engraftment and growth. This is due, in part, to their high vascularization potential, which permits neoangiogenesis, (15, 16) as well as to their reticular network of fibroblasts and other stromal cells that provide physical and trophic support. (17, 18) Inherent plasticity, together with the fact that their systemic function is not hampered by the transplanted cells, (19) makes lymph nodes a promising site for ectopic cell delivery. Finally, lymph nodes are also easily accessible for both delivery and monitoring of the transplanted cells.",

(21) However, it is unknown whether these promising results are translatable into a larger animal model, where a substantially higher hepatic mass would be required for rescue of liver disease. In this preclinical proof of concept study, we demonstrate the therapeutic potential of ectopic transplantation of ex vivo corrected hepatocytes into lymph nodes in the HT1 pig, a genetic model of liver failure. In tracking the fate of these cells we show the ability of ectopically transplanted hepatocytes to engraft long term in the mesenteric lymph nodes where they recreate important liver architecture that gives rise to multiple cell lineages seen in the native liver, and serve as a reservoir for repopulation of the recovering native liver.",

Radiolabeling efficiency was ~20% and radioactivity concentration was ~0.1 MBq/10 6 cells. The animal received 6 x 10 8 hepatocytes through direct mesenteric lymph node injection. PET-CT imaging at 6 h posttransplantation demonstrated the presence of radioactivity within mesenteric lymph nodes (261.8 \u00b1 108.7 SUV; Fig 1D, Video S1). Radioactivity remained present within the mesenteric lymph nodes at the 54 and 150 h time points (101.1 \u00b1 34.7 and 70.0 \u00b1 26.4 SUV, respectively). Background activity was measured in the left lumbar paraspinal muscle (0.1 SUV). Interestingly, although no radioactivity was detected within the liver at the 6 h time point, increasing amounts of radiotracer were found in the liver at the 54 and 150 h time points (3.3 \u00b1 0.4 and 5.9 \u00b1 0.8 SUV, respectively), indicating accumulation of 89 Zr-labeled cells or cellular debris. The absence of radioactivity in bone, a known site of uptake for unchelated 89 Zr, suggested that the radiolabel was retained within the dinitrobenzamide DBN chelator construct and not indicative of unincorporated \"free\" label.",

Fah was the gene with the highest number of distinct integration sites in both groups, although it was only in the top 10 integrated genes in the lymph node population. Interestingly, all but two of the 135 unique integration sites within Fah locus in the liver hepatocyte population were represented in the 206 integration sites present in the lymph node hepatocyte population (Fig 5E) , indicating that the transplanted cells first engrafted in the lymph nodes, divided and then, after clonal expansion, migrated to the liver. The top four genes with the highest integration frequency in the liver population were also within the top 20 genes in the lymph node population, and were all approximately 5-fold enriched in the liver population when evaluated by the total number of reads present for each, suggesting unbiased expansion and enrichment of a subpopulation of lymph node hepatocytes within the liver. These genes were: Mir9799, microRNA; Ndufv2, NADH dehydrogenase ubiquinone flavoprotein 2; Ifrd1, interferon-related developmental regulator 1; and Suclg1, succinyl-CoA ligase (GDP-forming), alpha subunit. In native and ectopic liver samples obtained from our experimental animals after necropsy, expression of Suclg1, Ndufv2, and Ifrd1 was indeed disrupted compared to control liver levels, possibly due to the insertion of the LV construct in at least one allele in some of the corrected hepatocytes ( Fig 5F) . As a control, NIS expression was evaluated and only detectable in 2 of the 3 samples of hepatized lymph nodes analyzed. The fifth most prevalent integration site in the hepatocytes that migrated to the liver was Cenpp, centromere protein P, which was enriched over 78-fold compared to the lymph node population and could be an indication that this disruption caused a favorable migration, engraftment, and/or expansion profile for these clones specifically.",

Twelve thousand genes were identified as differentially expressed (DE) and contrasting control lymph node to liver tissues including hepatized lymph nodes ( Figure 6A) . T-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) showed a strong tendency of hepatized lymph node transcripts to cluster with liver tissues samples, whereas control lymph nodes were distinct from the other three groups ( Figure 6B ). These data suggest that a significant proportion of the lymph node transcriptome acquires a liver-like signature after hepatocyte transplantation. To estimate the similarity of hepatized lymph nodes with control liver, we first focused on 24 genes, which were previously described to be liver-specific (LiGEP , Table S2 and Figure S4 ). We then included 20 additional genes in our analysis, which can be classified as cytochrome P450 genes, other enzymes, plasma proteins, transporters, surface molecules and cytokines, and transcription factors (Table S2) .",

Orthotopic cell transplantation has shown low rates of engraftment, especially when the liver is compromised by inflammation and fibrosis, as is seen in many liver diseases. (29) It has been previously shown that hepatocyte transplantation into lymph nodes is able to generate enough ectopic liver mass to correct HT1 and rescue mice from acute and chronic liver disease. (21) In our study, we show a similar result in the large animal model of HT1, suggesting that hepatocyte transplantation into lymph nodes is scalable and may therefore be a clinically relevant technique that permits the creation of sufficient ectopic liver mass to significantly impact liver function.",

Syngeneic and allogeneic hepatocytes were used in the HT1 mouse study by Komori et al, and the HT1 mouse does not exhibit the full extent of liver injury seen in humans, including fibrosis and cirrhosis. (21) The current study was conducted in the HT1 pigs initially supported on NTBC, where liver disease could be delayed until the harvesting of autologous cells was complete. In this study we take advantage of the porcine HT-1 model of liver failure because 1-2 weeks after the withdrawal of NTBC we begin to see rapid and severe liver injury that includes all the same features we see in human liver failure including, inflammation, fibrosis and cirrhosis. This study design allows us to isolate the single variable related to ectopic transplantation of hepatocytes in LNs in the setting of liver failure while avoiding potential confounding variables related to immune suppression or the use of primary hepatocyte alternatives. Now that we have demonstrated the feasibility of targeting LNs for hepatocyte transplantation, subsequent evaluations should be performed in untreated HT1 pigs or other large animal models of liver disease using primary hepatocyte alternatives or allotransplantation and immune suppression.",

Even though the goal of this study was not to evaluate directly the use of ectopic LN hepatocyte transplantation for the treatment of any specific genetic liver disease, there are some potential applications that should be discussed regarding these diseases. Some optimizations in initial engraftment rates or other modifications (i.e., exogenously applied selective pressure or repeat administrations of corrected cells) would be necessary for diseases that do not inherently propagate healthy cells, such as phenylketonuria or Wilson's disease. However, it is the liver damage itself through the hepatectomy and not something specific to HT1 that provides the stimulus for initial successful engraftment. Additionally, unlike HT1, most liver diseases do not require complete repopulation of the diseased liver, and administration could be catered to effect to see a phenotypic change.",

However, healthy allogeneic hepatocytes could be transplanted in cases where partial hepatectomy is contraindicated, such as in acute liver failure or severe cirrhosis, which would require additional support via established immune suppression protocols. Possible future sources of hepatocytes include universal donor hepatocytes, IPS-derived hepatocytes, and HLA-matched farmed hepatocytes (30) (31) (32) . In our study hepatocytes were transplanted into pig mesenteric lymph nodes using an open technique due to the paucity of suitable peripheral lymph nodes in the neonatal pig, but the same procedure could foreseeably be performed into central or peripheral lymph nodes in humans via a percutaneous or endoscopic ultrasound-guided technique, as described previously. (28) In our model, we found that although hepatocytes demonstrated long-term survival within lymph nodes, forming appropriate liver architecture including bile ducts, some also subsequently engrafted in the liver after a period of engraftment and expansion in the LNs. This was suggested by bioinformatics data and confirmed by histology. This phenomenon was very limited in previous mouse studies (21) and could be related to the microanatomy and direction of flow in pig lymph nodes, which differ from those of other mammals. Their microarchitecture is inverted, with the germinal centers being located internal to the medulla, which has led authors to suggest that lymphocytes are transported back into a capillary system after passing through a lymph node, as opposed to the lymphatic system as in other animals. (33, 34) Indeed, during the injection procedure it was possible to observe injected fluid communicating from the lymph node into the capillary bed. Based on these results, we also analyzed in detail the overall integration profile of our lentiviral vector in both hepatocytes that remained in the lymph nodes and hepatocytes that migrated to the liver. In both cell populations, the lentiviral vector showed a benign integration profile, with no preference for integration in promoter regions or tumor-associated genes. Analysis of the genes with the highest integration frequency in both populations suggested that hepatocytes that migrated to and expanded in the liver were a subpopulation of hepatocytes that remained in the lymph nodes, although discerning any functional impact of disrupting the integrated genes was beyond the scope of the current study. Interestingly, prevalence of the top four integrated genes in the liver population was approximately five-fold higher than in the lymph node population, a linearity possibly supported by a clonal founder with all four integrations or up to 4 unique clonal founders with identical (unbiased) expansion after migration and liver engraftment. Of note, Fah was within the top twenty genes with the highest integration frequency and was the gene with the highest number of distinct integration sites in both groups. This suggests that homology may guide integration to some extent, a finding that provokes further development to possibly improve safety and predictability of lentiviral genomic disruption.",

The finding that ectopic transplantation of corrected hepatocytes seeded subsequent robust orthotopic engraftment was not anticipated, and the additional hypothesis that the hepatocytes that migrated to liver were a subset of those that were initially engrafted in the lymph nodes (as opposed to a unique population that never engrafted ectopically) was further developed and tested using bioinformatics.",

For biodistribution experiments, a female wildtype pig was used. For ex vivo gene therapy experiments, male and female Fah -/pigs were used. Fah -/pigs were produced in a 50% Large White and 50% Landrace pig as previously described. (36, 37) NTBC administration NTBC mixed in food was administered at a dose of 1 mg/kg/day with a maximum of 25 mg/day. All animals remained on NTBC until the time of transplantation, after which NTBC administration was discontinued to support expansion of the corrected cells. After hepatocyte transplantation, all animals were monitored daily for loss of appetite or any other clinical signs of morbidity. Animals were weighed daily for the first two weeks post-operatively and weekly thereafter. If loss of appetite, weight loss, or any other signs of morbidity occurred, NTBC treatment was reinitiated for seven days. Animals were cycled on and off NTBC in this fashion to stimulate expansion of corrected FAH-positive cells. Hepatocyte transduction Hepatocytes were co-transduced in suspension at a MOI of 20TUs with two third-generation lentiviral vectors carrying the sodium-iodide symporter (Nis) reporter gene or the pig Fah gene under control of the thyroxine-binding globulin promoter (Fig 1A) . The NIS reporter allows for longitudinal non-invasive monitoring of transplanted cells through single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) or positron emission tomography (PET). (42) Transduction occurred over the course of 2 h before transplantation using medium and resuspension techniques previously described.(10) Hepatocytes were resuspended in 0.9% sodium chloride (Baxter Healthcare Corporation, Deerfield, IL).",

We performed PET/CT imaging of these two treated pigs to monitor for the expansion of NIS-positive hepatocytes in the mesentery and other tissues. One hour prior to imaging, animals received 10 mCi (370 MBq) of [ 18 F]TFB. Pigs 265 and 268 were scanned at 104 and 203 days and 177 and 203 days respectively post-transplantation. Both animals showed NIS-positivity in mesenteric lymph nodes (15.7 and 39.0 SUV and 92.6 and 32.0 SUV, respectively; Fig 3A, Videos S2-5). Despite greater than 50% repopulation of the liver at necropsy with FAH-positive hepatocytes, minimal NIS activity was seen in the liver. To correlate NIS-positivity in mesenteric lymph nodes with histological findings, previously targeted lymph nodes were biopsied in two animals at day 140 post-transplantation. All lymph nodes samples were taken from the root of the mesentery and were grossly positive for hepatic tissue and confirmed by IHC staining for FAH expression, which would be unique to ex vivocorrected hepatocytes due to the use of the FAH -/pig and transgenic expression controlled by the liver-specific TBG promoter (Fig 3B). Transplanted hepatocytes were more commonly found in a subcapsular location within the lymph node. All experimental animals were euthanized at 212 to 241 days post-transplantation. Histology of the collected mesenteric lymph nodes showed sustained presence of FAH-positive hepatocytes (Fig 3B, right panels), which was observed in four out of five animals. The two animals that had been biopsied previously still had FAH-positive hepatocyte engraftment in lymph nodes at necropsy confirmed by FAH and cytokeratin 18 IHC staining (Fig 3B, left and middle panels). CD31-positive endothelial cells were found within areas of hepatocyte engraftment in positive tissues (Fig 3B, Pig 268 bottom right panel), suggesting that significant blood vessel remodeling took place after transplantation to sustain long-term engraftment and hepatic growth. Positivity for glutamine synthetase, an enzyme exclusively expressed in pericentral hepatocytes in mammals,(23) was found in hepatocytes surrounding CD31 positive neo-vessels, suggesting neo-formation of a central vein and, importantly, proper physiological zoning of the ectopic liver. Reproduction of hepatic microarchitecture within transplanted lymph nodes was further supported by the presence of hepatic lobules similar to those observed in native pig livers, and cytokeratin 7-positive bile duct cells within the areas of engraftment (Fig 3B, Pig 265 bottom right panel). Hepatocytes transplanted into lymph nodes migrate to the liver Migration of transplanted hepatocytes to the liver was confirmed by FAH IHC of liver tissue demonstrating multiple FAHpositive nodules within the livers of all five animals, covering 67 to 100% (84.7 \u00b1 7.0) of the total liver area at the time of necropsy. A negative correlation was found between percent liver repopulation with FAH-positive hepatocytes and sustained presence of FAH-positive areas of hepatocyte engraftment within lymph nodes; one pig with complete liver repopulation with FAHpositive hepatocytes showed little to no hepatocyte presence remaining within the lymph nodes at the terminal time point, while pigs with only partial liver repopulation with FAH-positive hepatocytes demonstrated a more robust hepatocyte presence within the lymph nodes at 235-239 days post-transplantation (Fig S2). As expected, FAH-negative areas of the liver showed marked hepatocellular damage and fibrosis due to prolonged NTBC withdrawal. However, the two fully FAH-positive livers demonstrated healthy, normal-looking tissue with minimal residual fibrosis,",

            "text": "limited by the presence of significant liver injury in the form of inflammation, fibrosis and cirrhosis,(11) underscoring the importance of evaluating alternative transplantation sites. Ectopic hepatocyte transplantation has been attempted in several preclinical and clinical studies.(19) Of the alternative sites tested, only spleen and peritoneal cavity have been able to accommodate a clinically significant number of cells.(24) Intrasplenic injection of hepatocytes improves liver function and prolongs survival in a mouse model of liver failure.(25) Although transsplenic access to the portal vein in human patients has been done(26), this may introduce hemorrhagic risk that is decreased with lymph node transplantation. Intraperitoneal transplantation of hepatocytes has been attempted in humans with acute liver failure, but transplanted cells are not able to survive in this environment for extended periods of time.(27)Lymph nodes are a highly favorable site for ectopic cell transplantation.(19) Not only does their plasticity and highly complex vascular network provide a healthy milieu for cell engraftment and expansion, as demonstrated by both their natural interactions with lymphocytes and their pathological interactions with metastatic tumor cells, but their accessibility makes it possible to perform minimally invasive cell delivery in the clinical setting. This could prove especially important in patients that are higher risk surgical candidates. There is ample precedent in the clinic for ultrasound-guided lymph node identification and targeting. Fine needle aspiration biopsies, for example, are now a routine diagnostic test. Multiple clinical studies have also made use of lymph nodes as sites for injection of immunotherapeutic agents, with patients rating the procedure comparable to a subcutaneous injection and less painful than venous puncture.(28) Furthermore, cell transplantation into lymph nodes does not appear to affect their function: no complications were noted in our study or in previous studies.(20) (21)All five animals treated through this method demonstrated NTBC independence within three to five months of treatment, as well as complete normalization of tyrosine levels and liver function tests.",

Of 135 unique integration sites in the Fah locus seen in the hepatocytes engrafted in the liver, only 1 was not among the 206 unique integration sites observed in the hepatocytes in lymph nodes. This result substantiates the conclusion that although cells migrate from the lymph nodes to the liver after transplantation they do so primarily after a period of engraftment in the lymph nodes. If the hepatocytes had migrated immediately to the liver after transplantation we would have expected a more disparate integration profile between the two populations. Further experiments conducted on a different large animal model with a similar lymphatic anatomy to humans would be required to judge whether the level of hepatocyte migration from mesenteric lymph nodes to liver remains the same. If so, central lymph node injection could potentially be considered a safer alternative to portal vein injection for hepatocyte delivery into the liver, since portal vein infusion of cells often leads to thrombotic complications and requires systemic anticoagulation.(35)",

This implies that transplantation of hepatocytes in lymph nodes and ex vivo lentiviral gene therapy does not significantly alter endogenous gene expression within the corrected cells. Together with the integration profiling data (discussed above), this advocates for the safety of the development of an ectopic liver in lymph nodes and the ex vivo lentiviral gene therapy approach. Given the clinical success of ex vivo lentiviral gene therapy in cancer via CAR-T cells (see review by Geyer and Brentjens, 2016) and the over 250 open FDA trials using lentivirus, our data support progression of this paradigm into additional indications. Ultimately, approval of expanded clinical application of ex vivo lentiviral gene therapy will be made on a risk:reward basis, and a growing body of literature from our laboratories and others support both safety (reduced risk) and efficacy (increased reward) of this approach.",

            "text": "Mesenteric lymph nodes were identified and hepatocytes were delivered directly into 10-20 nodes through direct injection with a 25-gauge one-inch needle. Each animal received a total of 6 x 10 8 hepatocytes in 10-20 mL of saline. Heparinization of the cell solution just prior to injection was performed at 70 U/kg of recipient weight as has been previously described for islet cell transplantation protocols.(43) Positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) imaging and analysis Imaging was performed on the high-resolution GE Discovery 690 ADC PET/CT System (GE Healthcare, Chicago, IL) at 6, 54, and 150 h post-transplantation in the 89 Zr-labeled animal. Noninvasive evaluation of NIS expression was performed by PET/CT at 3, 5, and 6 month posttransplantation in two of the NIS-labeled animals using [ 18 F]tetrafluoroborate ([ 18 F]TFB) radiotracer.(44) CT was performed at 120 kV and 150 mA, with tube rotation of 0.5 s and pitch of 0.516. PET was performed as a two-bed acquisition with 10 min per bed and 17-slice overlap, resulting in a 27-cm axial field of view. PMOD (version 3.711; PMOD Technologies, Switzerland) was used for image processing, 3D visualization and analysis. The anatomic location of liver and kidneys was identified from the registered datasets. Volumes of interest (VOIs) of mesenchymal lymph nodes were created on PET images, and standardized uptake values (SUVs) for body weight were obtained. Surface rendering was performed using the threshold pixel value for bone, liver and kidneys from the CT dataset and lymph nodes from the PET dataset to localize the lymph nodes with reference to the skeleton. Biochemical analysis Standard serum and plasma analyses were performed. Tyrosine values in plasma were determined using liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry via Mayo Clinic's internal biochemical PKU test. Histopathological and immunohistochemical analyses For H&E, Masson's Trichrome and FAH stains, tissue samples were fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin (Azer Scientific, Morgantown, PA), paraffin embedded and sectioned (5 \u03bcm). H&E and Masson's Trichrome stains were performed by means of standard protocols, while immunohistochemistry for FAH was performed as previously described.(42) Percent of FAH-positive hepatocytes was quantified using a cytoplasmic stain algorithm in Aperio ImageScope. For all other immunohistochemical stains, tissues were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 4 h, infiltrated with 30% sucrose overnight and then embedded in OCT compound prior to sectioning (5-7 \u03bcm). Sections were washed with phosphatebuffered saline (PBS) and blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) or milk for 30 min. Sections were then incubated with primary antibody for 1 h and secondary antibody for 30 min, and were coverslipped with a glycerol-based mounting media containing Hoechst. Images were captured with an Olympus IX71 inverted microscope. The following primary antibodies were used: ER-TR7 (ab51824, Abcam, Cambridge, MA), Glutamine Synthetase (ab64613, Abcam, Cambridge, MA), CD31 (MCA1746GA, Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA), Cytokeratin 7 (ab9021, Abcam, Cambridge, MA) and Cytokeratin 18 (10830-1-AP, Proteintech, Chicago, IL). Amplification, next-generation sequencing (NGS), and genomic DNA mapping of lentiviral integration sites Genomic DNA was isolated from snap-frozen tissue fragments of hepatized mesenteric lymph nodes and engrafted livers from Animal No. 265 using a Gentra Puregene Tissue Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Ligation-mediated PCR (LM-PCR) was used for efficient isolation of integration sites. Restriction enzyme digestions with MseI were performed on genomic DNA",

            "text": "Locations of integration points were categorized in: exons, introns, 3 prime UTRs, 5 prime UTRs and intergenic regions using information extracted from the susScr11 refflat file maintained by UCSC's Genomics Institute. To avoid conflict of feature categorization arising from multiple overlapping gene definitions, only the definition of the longest gene was used to annotate integration points. Additional features where computed including: the distance to the nearest transcription start site (TSS), makeup of CpG-rich regions of the genome (\"CpG islands\"), and enrichment to tumor-associated genes. This tumor gene list was comprised of 745 clinically validated tumor-associated human genes (from Mayo Clinic internal data). Those genes were related to their pig homologs based on GenBank's gene names. RNA isolation, tissue screening, and whole transcriptome sequencing (RNAseq) Total RNA was isolated from snap-frozen tissue fragments of hepatized or control (non-transplanted) mesenteric lymph nodes from three experimental animals, and of engrafted livers from the same three experimental animals or control liver from one untreated, control animal using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) according to manufacturer's instructions (including the optional on-column DNase digestion). RNA purity and concentration were measured using a NanoDrop 2000/c spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA). Screening of hepatized lymph nodes was performed by examining albumin and fah expressions using quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR). Non-transplanted mesenteric lymph nodes and a control liver were used as negative and positive controls, respectively. RNA was retrotranscribed using the iScript Reverse Transcription Supermix (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) and albumin and fah were amplified using the SsoAdvanced\u2122 Universal SYBR\u00ae Green Supermix (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) on a StepOnePlus Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Expression of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) was used for normalization of gene expression data. Relative changes in gene expression were calculated using the 2 -\u0394\u0394CT method.",
