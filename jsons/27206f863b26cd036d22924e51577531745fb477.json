Under these circumstances, there is a temptation to restrict diagnostic virology to what is simple and straightforward (e.g. the less expensive serology) and to reduce the number of specialist viroiogy laboratories in each country to one or two centralized facilities. The main function of these central reference laboratories would be to serve the epidemiologic needs of the country.

Kits followed rapidly, particularly for hepatitis B and HIV/AIDS, where there was, and is, a huge demand for screening blood and blood products for evidence of past infection before use [7] . The technology developed for these two viruses was soon adapted to others, and a variety of reagents, kits and systems for routine diagnosis have flooded onto the m a r k e t s o much so that laboratories have found that, provided they used enough of the material or kits, they often did not have to buy the otherwise expensive machine on which to run them; it would be readily available on loan. Further, similar enzyme-linked assays became available for other branches of laboratory medicine, particularly biochemistry, and one machine might, in theory, fulfill everyone's needs. So far, this form of rationalization has been slow to catch on but, as money becomes ever tighter, the pressure towards it will rise. Such assays are based on measuring levels in serum, and, in virologic terms, this means measuring antibody levels. These rise far too slowly to be useful in rapid diagnosis, but many still believe that 'viral titers' provide the essence of virologic diagnosis. Virus titers may be helpful in some cases, but only in retrospect; they have no place in deciding antiviral treatment, except in continuing infections such as AIDS and hepatitis.",

Inevitably, diagnostic kits have appeared, and their use and value are being explored [9] . These kits are not cheap and need high-class laboratory techniques to be reliable, but they are being hailed as a possible way to avoid the need for cell culture. Whether they can be rapid and cheap enough for routine use remains to be seen but, since they require known primer sequences, they cannot work with novel viruses. Cell culture is one of the traditional diagnostic tools, but one that is expensive in skilled staff time, reagents and space and impossible to standardize.",

The first is importation of known viruses into new areas, and recent cases of yellow fever imported into Germany in 1999, and originally thought to be due to Ebola virus, provide a good example. Global warming may bring insects, and the viruses they transmit, to areas previously free from them [l 11. Second, with increasing numbers of immunocompromised patients, either because their natural immunity is deficient or absent, or because they are on immunosuppressive drugs (for malignancies or following transplants), otherwise relatively harmless viruses can become seriously life-threatening. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is normally a silent infection, but reactivation in transplant patients or those with AIDS can be very serious and is the most widely known example [12], although it is not the only one. When CMV recurs, high and apparently adequate doses of appropriate antiviral drugs often fail to eliminate CMV activity, and exactly why this happens is unclear [13] . Such patients are increasingly managed in district hospitals, but specialist virology has to be close at hand for this to be done properly. With more anti-CMV drugs becoming available to help to manage this problem, the patients must also be monitored for the appearance of resistant strains of the virus [14] . Just as importantly, progress in reducing virus activity must be assessed regularly. Failure to achieve undetectable levels can be due to developing resistance, but this may not be the only reason. Assumption is not enough; the real reason must be found if the problem is to be solved.",

The R N A genomes of both influenza A and B are unstable, leading to antigenic 'drift', in which their surface antigens alter a little each year, possibly as a result of immune pressure, so that over several years mutants gradually outflank existing herd immunity [ 161. In addition, influenza A can undergo major antigenic changes through acquiring new segments of R N A by genetic reassortment with animal strains [ 161. These major 'shifts' occur at infrequent and unpredictable intervals, but are important because the new strains have changed their antigenic outer clothes to such an extent that no existing immunity in the community is effective and a worldwide pandemic may follow. Should this occur again (the last time was in 1968), there will be an urgent need for a new vaccine to protect the vulnerable. If the new strain is as pathogenic as Spanish flu was in 1918, the entire community will be at serious risk. The recent isolation of H5N1 [17] and H9N2 (J.S.M. Peiris, personal communication) strains of influenza A viruses in Hong Kong confirm that 'shift' changes occur and these dangers are not just theoretical.

Absence of contact leads to reliance on 'virus titers' alone. Secondly, the virologic staffing structure must be large enough to give the trainee virologists reasonable career prospects.

There have to be as many laboratories as are necessary to ensure adequate and sufiiciently broad monitoring, both epidemiologically and of individual patients, with properly trained and experienced staff in daily practice with the necessary catch-all techniques. At present, in the UK, too many senior vacancies are left unfilled-for example, during the last 10 years, four Consultant posts in Glasgow, two in Newcastle, one in Edinburgh, one in Leeds, one in Leicester. If this trend is not reversed, specialist virologists will become extinct through attrition, and because trainees will find their career prospects much greater in other specialities. The value of virology services directed by fully trained and in-practice speciahsts to transplant units, pediatricians, AIDS clinics, intensive therapy units (ITUs), epidemiologists, developers of vaccines and antiviral drugs (and those that evaluate them in trials) and commercial companies must be recognized, and their survival planned. Concerns about new viral activities developing in the community, and not being recognized until too late, were expressed as long ago as May 1989 at a meeting in Washington, DC on 'Emerging viruses: the evolution of viruses and viral diseases', sponsored by NIH in cooperation with The Rockefeller University. These well-justified anxieties were later published as a book [22] , in which Donald Henderson, architect of the W H O Smallpox Eradication Campaign, proposed a network of nationally based surveillance laboratories [23] . This is, one would have thought, only common sense, but no network can survive without staff, trained and in regular practice, to do the basic tasks of looking for new viruses or changes in the pattern of 'virus-like' diseases. In other words, they must be in post, and kept in practice by being given routine tasks to do. Now, 10 years later, the situation has got gradually worse and there still seems to be far too little awareness of the danger of losing the necessary breadth of techniques necessary for adequate surveillance, staffed by fully trained and experienced card-carrying virologists deploying their traditional slulls.",
