However, animal infectious throw mankind a deadly menace with infectious diseases initiating from animals [1], [2], [3]. Some diseases such as African swine fever and bovine leukemia only influence animals. But to some epidemic, those pathogenic bacteria can be spilled from domestic animals or wildlife to human beings, and the development and mutation during the transmission will make the pathogenic bacteria difficult to control [4], [5], [6]. A lot of diseases besetting human beings such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), SARS corona virus, Ebola virus and avian influenza viruses (AIV) all can trace their filiation from animals [7]. Taylor\u2019s achievement showed that about 75% of human epidemics stem from an animal source, and these zoo-noses are quite difficult to control after its prevalence among a crowd of human [8]. So preventing the formation and spread of zoonoses is quite important to public health of human beings.",

Among them, Jianjun Jiao et al. established an SIR model with impulsive vaccination and impulsive dispersal to analyze the effect of impulsive vaccination and restricting infected individuals boarding transports on disease spread [9]. Linfei Nie et al. proposed a state-dependent impulsive model with two control threshold values to study two-languages competition and they found the order-1 periodic solutions using qualitative analysis method [10]. Shengqiang Zhang et al. proposed a stochastic non-autonomous Lotka\u2013Volterra predator\u2013prey model with impulsive effects and investigate its stochastic dynamics [11]. Meng Zhang et al. considered the preventive control of computer worm\u2019s transmission through Internet [12]. Recently discussions regarding impulsive disturbance based on state feedback have dominated the research in field of control theory and optimization [13], [14], [15], [16], [17], [18]. Enlightened by those research about impulsive model, we construct a state feedback impulsive SIS model to analyze the therapy control of animal infectious diseases. In practice, animal epidemic is hardly to be detected during its latent period because no obvious symptoms can be observed. Veterinarians can find the disease only after the eruption and then can treatment measures be carried out. Nevertheless, a certain amount of animals have been infected by the virus at that time. Thus, it is more appropriate to represent the treatment of animal epidemics as a state feedback impulse which depends on the variable of infected animals.",

We also assume that the infected animals recover after treatment and become susceptible again. Then the model is established as follows: (1.1)dSdt=S(r\u2212SK)\u2212\u03b2SI\u2212d0S,dIdt=\u03b2SI\u2212dI\u2212d0I,I<I\u2217,\u0394I=\u2212\u03b8I\u2217,\u0394S=\u03b8I\u2217,I=I\u2217,where S(t) denotes the susceptible animals; I(t) represents the infected ones. According to the transmission feather, we make the following assumption: (1) animals increase in logistic pattern, and the environmental capacity is K; (2) only the healthy animals can propagate and the newborn animals are susceptible ones; (3) the infected rate of susceptible is linear with both susceptible and infected animals at \u03b2; (4) natural death rate is d0 and death rate caused by the epidemic is d ; (5) I\u2217 is the threshold that the infectious disease can be discovered, when the amount of infections is smaller than I\u2217, the infectious disease develops according to the common way which is expressed as the first two equations of model (1.1); (6) once the threshold I\u2217 is reached, the infectious disease can be spotted and efficient treatment will be performed immediately. A portion of infections, here we assume the ratio is \u03b8 (0<\u03b8<1), will be treated and turn into susceptible ones and can be infected again. Considering the practical significance, all the parameters in this paper are positive.",

Assume phase set N intersects the horizontal isoclinic line dIdt=0 at point B(d+d0\u03b2,(1\u2212\u03b8)I\u2217), and there must exist a trajectory LB passing through B and being tangent with phase set N:I=(1\u2212\u03b8)I\u2217 (see Fig. 4). Denote the intersection point of the trajectory LB and the impulsive set M as MB(xMB,I\u2217). For the impulsive set is below the equilibrium E2, i.e. I\u2217\u22641\u03b2(r\u2212d0\u2212d+d0\u03b2K), so xMB>d+d0\u03b2 which means the horizontal ordinate of point MB is larger than that of point B. Then the impulsive function \u03c6 maps MB(xMB,I\u2217) to a point NB(xMB+\u03b8I\u2217,(1\u2212\u03b8)I\u2217) in phase set. So the successor function of B is F(B)=xNB\u2212xB=xMB+\u03b8I\u2217\u2212d+d0\u03b2>0.In the following we will prove the existence of point C satisfying F(C)<0.First, we prove that in the first quadrant the line whose slope is \u22121\ncannot be tangent with any trajectory of system (1.1). To system (1.1), on the point where the slope of direction vector is \u22121 the coordinate must satisfy dIdS=\u03b2SI\u2212(d+d0)IS(r\u2212d0\u2212SK)\u2212\u03b2SI=\u22121.Then we have I=\u22121(d+d0)KS2+r\u2212d0d+d0S.Its graph is a parabola with the origin as vertex, downward opening and located under the x axis. So it is obvious that the line whose slope is \u22121\ncannot be tangent with any trajectory of system (1.1) in the first quadrant.Second, there exists a line L whose slope is \u22121 and the trajectory of system (1.1) runs across line L from right side to left side at the points whose vertical coordinate satisfying I<I\u2217. Assuming V=S+I, to system (1.1) we have dVdt=dSdt+dIdt=S(r\u2212d0\u2212SK)\u2212(d+d0)I.If the equation of line L is S+I\u2212e=0, then on line L we have dVdtL=(e\u2212I)(r\u2212d0\u2212e\u2212IK)\u2212(d+d0)I.If the parameter e satisfying e>(r\u2212d0)K+I\u2217, there must exist dVdt<0. Then on the points of line L satisfying I<I\u2217, the trajectories of system (1.1) pass line L from right side to left side.\n",

Then, there exist trajectories LI and LJ passing I and J, and they cross the impulse set M at MI and MJ respectively. MI must be located on the right of MJ. The impulse function \u03c6:MI\u2192NI, \u03c6:MJ\u2192NJ, xNI=xMI+\u03b8I\u2217 and xNJ=xMJ+\u03b8I\u2217, we have xNI>xNJ; here, NI and NJ are subsequent points of I and J respectively. The successor functions of I and J are F(I) and F(J), then, F(I)\u2212F(J)=(xNI\u2212xI)\u2212(xNJ\u2212xJ)=(xNI\u2212xNJ)+(xJ\u2212xI)>0.\nCase II: Select two different points I and J in phase set N satisfying xI<xJ<q, and they are located on different sides of horizontal isoclinic line dIdt=0 (see Fig. 8). Then, F(I)\u2212F(J)=>0. The prove is similar with that in case I.\nCase III: Select two different points I and J in phase set N satisfying xI<xJ<q, and both I and J are located on right side of horizontal isoclinic line dIdt=0 (see Fig. 9). Then, there exist trajectories LI and LJ initiating from I and J, and they cross the vertical isoclinic line at PI and PJ and reach the impulse set M at MI and MJ respectively. During the process from I to PI and J to PJ on LI and LJ, condition r\u2212d0\u2212SK\u2212\u03b2I>0 is satisfied. With the same vertical ordinate, the horizontal ordinate of the point in LI is smaller than the horizontal ordinate of the corresponding point in LJ, then the value of r\u2212d0\u2212SK\u2212\u03b2I is larger on the point belonging LI than the corresponding point belonging LJ. Similarly, during the process from PI to MI and PJ to MJ on LI and LJ, we have r\u2212d0\u2212SK\u2212\u03b2I<0. With the same vertical ordinate, the horizontal ordinate of the point in LI is smaller than that of the point in LJ, then the value of r\u2212d0\u2212SK\u2212\u03b2I is bigger on a certain point belonging LI than that on the corresponding point belonging LJ. Then we have xJ\u2212xI>xMJ\u2212xMI which results in F(I)\u2212F(J)>0.\nCase IV: Select two different points I and J in phase set N satisfying xI<q<xJ, and point I is located on right side of horizontal isoclinic line dIdt=0.\nCase V: Select two different points I and J in phase set N satisfying q<xI<xJ.The proofs of Case IV and Case V are similar to that of Case III and they are omitted here.By all accounts above, the successor function F(\u22c5) is monotonically decreasing in the phase set. Thus there exists only one point A satisfying F(A)=0. Hence, the order-1 periodic solution to system (1.1) is unique. This completes the proof.\n",

Apparently the number of infectious animals must be observed and recorded, since the treatment is activated by the value. Once the number of infectious animals accumulates to the threshold of impulsive set, human will carry out some treatment measures and the number of the infectious drop to the imagine set. That work costs huge manpower and material resources. In fact, since the periodic solution is unique and stable, the period of the periodic solution is a constant. If we observe the phenomenon that the interval between each time the amount of the infectious reaches the threshold is a constant, it forebodes the periodic solution has formed. In that case, we can carry out artificial intervention depending on the fix period instead of observing the infectious and record the amount.
