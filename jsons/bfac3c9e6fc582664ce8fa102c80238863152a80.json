Although the number of deaths from SARS was limited to 916 worldwide, which is significantly lower than the annual mortality figures for many other infectious diseases such as influenza, HIV infection or malaria, 1 it created panic among health care professionals and the public all over the world and severely disrupted businesses and travel to affected destinations. Based on figures from the World Tourism Organization (WTO), it reduced international passenger traffic by 2.6% in the first 4 months of 2003. 2 Travel to Asia Pacific countries dropped by 10% to 50% in late March to April 2003, 2 and this was related to the emergence of SARS. Tourist arrivals to Hong Kong in April and May, the peak SARS-affected months, dropped by 64.8% and 67.9% respectively. 3 Anecdotal reports suggest that public concerns about SARS have increased travel-related enquiries to travel medicine practitioners and health care professionals.

In the Amoy Gardens outbreak in Hong Kong, aerosolization of fecal waste contaminated with the SARS agent has also been proposed to have contributed to transmission.",

However, a number of unusual superspreading individuals played a major role in the spread of the disease. For instance, the Hong Kong index case is thought to have infected individuals who subsequently infected over 300 patients in Amoy Gardens in Hong Kong and over 60 patients in Singapore. [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] These latter two clusters may have resulted from two individuals who were both undergoing hemodialysis treatment.A further hemodialysis patient has been involved in the transmission of SARS in Toronto, so it is interesting to hypothesize that such patients, who may therefore have a relatively depressed immune system with associated high viral loads, may be unduly (or unknowingly) facilitating transmission of the virus.According to the World Health Organization (WHO), 29 secondary cases involving five international flights have been associated with the transmission of SARS from symptomatic probable cases to passengers and/or crew. 7 Only one of these flights resulted in a superspreading event, which accounted for 24 probable cases.However,the route of transmission on flights remains undetermined-droplet, contact, fecal-oral and limited airborne transmission, or a combination of modalities, are all plausible. 7 The SARS outbreak highlights how the nonspecific disease presentation, coupled with a relatively long incubation period (6.4 days) 9 and, initially, the absence of a reliable diagnostic test limited the understanding of the magnitude of the outbreak. Furthermore, widespread global travel readily spread the virus around the globe in a matter of days, giving an indication of the speed with which we may need to deal with the next emerging infectious disease.",

As in the case of SARS, transmission of disease between populations as a result of travel plays an important role in determining the health of not only those carrying the disease, but also the host nations and the health services of both native and host countries. Travel is undertaken for a number of reasons, including leisure and business, but inevitably the health of the individual can be an issue. 15 Communicable and noncommunicable health problems may develop both before and, more likely, during travel and can then be transmitted within the countries visited. A traveler can pass through several countries or areas within the incubation period of some diseases. If the port health authorities do not recognize the condition, as in the case of SARS with its nonspecific presentation, the host community is very likely to be exposed to the disease. The host environment may also create favorable conditions for the disease to spread. For instance, lack of readily available medical resources or medications may result in delayed diagnosis and treatment, which may be associated with increased mortality, and delayed recognition of a condition, as with SARS, can potentiate spread. Yellow fever, Ross River and dengue viruses are recognized as imported problems in many countries. For example, in 1979 an epidemic outbreak of Ross River virus infection occurred in Fiji, with 30,000 clinical cases, which was later suggested to have arisen from an infected tourist who arrived by air. 16 The impact of imported and exported cases on the epidemic could be enormous. This could cause a major outbreak in the city/country, affecting many sectors, including the travel industry and medical sector, and the health of the general population. On the other hand, the consequences of an imported or exported \"superspreader\" could be even more serious. For example, the outbreak in Hong Kong was caused by an imported case, which was then exported to Canada, Singapore and Vietnam, subsequently resulting in the worldwide epidemic.",

For instance, a number of health care professionals had to impose quarantine restrictions on themselves. This resulted in them not taking part in normal household activities and not being involved in any intimate relationships with spouses. A significant number isolated themselves within the hospital premises for extended periods of time. An understanding of the risks to themselves and their visiting clients is important for effective practice. Given the possibility that asymptomatic individuals could transmit SARS to others, stringent precautionary and infection control measures must be maintained. Our experience in Hong Kong showed that patients were afraid to contact health care professionals, following media reports of the high prevalence of infection in health care settings. Therefore, proper preventive measures (Table 1) should be taken to ensure that the travel health clinic is safe for patients to visit and that there are no or only minimal risks of infecting patients in the clinic. Health care professionals should also be vaccinated against influenza, 17 to reduce potential confusion between the next influenza outbreak and a possible reemergence of the SARS virus.",

            "text": "Given that the etiology of many infectious diseases cannot be established in the early stages of infection, balancing possible harm from the disease-related preventive measures against the risks of being infected with the disease is difficult. During the SARS outbreak, a number of questions were raised, such as whether patients should be advised to avoid public places,not to travel,or to use a mask to reduce risk, or whether physicians overseeing SARS patients should be kept isolated from their family members. The answers to these questions were often unclear. Although the necessity for some policies on actions might be controversial, not supporting them might be harmful if most people believe that these could reduce risks. For example, the use of masks in SARS-hit cities/countries was encouraged during the epidemic. However, whether this should be continued during the nonepidemic season should be based on individuals' personal choices. Individuals wearing masks might fall under unnecessary suspicion of being carriers of SARS or other infectious viruses. Therefore, any decisions should be properly examined for their possible risks and benefits before being widely implemented. On the other hand, before prophylaxis or treatment is initiated for any condition,the risks of not accepting such prophylaxis or treatment should be balanced against the possible side effects of the available treatments. This is particularly important for those who are pregnant and who have cardiovascular or other serious health problems.",

To carry out the essential practice of travel medicine, they should be well trained in emerging infections and prepared for any new challenges. The SARS epidemic reestablishes the tremendous scope for sharing of information and responsibility among members of the ISTM. The need for continuous training could be emphasized by the ISTM and Table 3 Points to be Considered in the Post-travel Consultation Detailed history of current condition: fever, chills, cough, headache, malaise, myalgia and other respiratory symptoms Detailed information on personal contacts: who, where and how; whether they developed any health problems or visited any health care facilities; and the nature of those facilities Detailed travel history: countries and regions visited, mode of travel, duration of stay and travel, accompanying person, activities performed in the host countries or region Others: activities after returning to the home country its affiliated organizations, and appropriate courses on emerging infectious diseases should be offered by these organizations.",
