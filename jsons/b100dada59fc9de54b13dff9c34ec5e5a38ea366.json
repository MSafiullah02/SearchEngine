The leading producers of farmed raised shrimp in this hemisphere are Ecuador, Brazil, Honduras and Mexico. In terms of significant production from aquaculture, only two penaeid shrimp species have been significant in the Americas. Of these, Litopenaeus vannamei (the Pacific white shrimp; the taxonomy used in this review will follow Perez Farfante and Kensley, 1997) currently accounts for more than 95% of the total production. The second most important species is Litopenaeus stylirostris, the Pacific blue shrimp, and it once accounted for nearly 20% of the hemisphere's production. However, the high susceptibility of this species to WSSV and to new strains of TSV resulted in the near abandonment of the species in 1999-2000 by most of the industry (Zarain-Herzberg and Ascencio-Valle, 2001; Erickson et al., 2002; OIE, 2006b) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 877, "end": 898, "text": "Ascencio-Valle, 2001;", "ref_id": "BIBREF164"}, {"start": 899, "end": 921, "text": "Erickson et al., 2002;", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}, {"start": 922, "end": 933, "text": "OIE, 2006b)", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "The most important diseases of cultured penaeid shrimp, in terms of economic impact, in the Americas (and in Asia) have infectious agents as their cause (Flegel and Alday-Sanz, 1998; Flegel 1997 Flegel , 2006 Lightner, 1999; OIE, 2006a,b) . Among the infectious diseases of cultured shrimp, certain virus-caused diseases stand out as the most significant and many of these are listed by the World Animal Health Organization (the OIE -Office International des Epizooties) (Tables 1 and 2). Some of the most important diseases (and their etiological agents) were once limited in distribution to either the Western or Eastern Hemisphere (Lightner 1996a (Lightner ,b, 2003a Flegel and Alday-Sanz, 1998; OIE, 2006b) . However, the international movement of live (for aquaculture) and dead (commodity shrimp for reprocessing, direct retail commerce, and for use as bait by sport fishermen) have been implicated or suspected as being responsible for the transfer and establishment of certain pathogens from Asia to the Americas (Lightner, 1996b; Durand et al., 2000; AQUIS, 2000; Hasson et al., 2006) . While frozen commodity shrimp have been implicated as the route by which WSSV was moved from Asia to the Americas, TSV was moved in the opposite direction with infected live broodstock from Central America (Nunan et al., 1998b; Tu et al., 1999; Yu and Song, 2000; Durand et al., 2000; .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 153, "end": 182, "text": "(Flegel and Alday-Sanz, 1998;", "ref_id": "BIBREF43"}, {"start": 183, "end": 194, "text": "Flegel 1997", "ref_id": "BIBREF41"}, {"start": 195, "end": 208, "text": "Flegel , 2006", "ref_id": "BIBREF42"}, {"start": 209, "end": 224, "text": "Lightner, 1999;", "ref_id": "BIBREF75"}, {"start": 225, "end": 238, "text": "OIE, 2006a,b)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 634, "end": 649, "text": "(Lightner 1996a", "ref_id": "BIBREF73"}, {"start": 650, "end": 669, "text": "(Lightner ,b, 2003a", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 670, "end": 698, "text": "Flegel and Alday-Sanz, 1998;", "ref_id": "BIBREF43"}, {"start": 699, "end": 710, "text": "OIE, 2006b)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1021, "end": 1038, "text": "(Lightner, 1996b;", "ref_id": "BIBREF74"}, {"start": 1039, "end": 1059, "text": "Durand et al., 2000;", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}, {"start": 1060, "end": 1072, "text": "AQUIS, 2000;", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1073, "end": 1093, "text": "Hasson et al., 2006)", "ref_id": "BIBREF54"}, {"start": 1302, "end": 1323, "text": "(Nunan et al., 1998b;", "ref_id": "BIBREF113"}, {"start": 1324, "end": 1340, "text": "Tu et al., 1999;", "ref_id": "BIBREF150"}, {"start": 1341, "end": 1359, "text": "Yu and Song, 2000;", "ref_id": "BIBREF163"}, {"start": 1360, "end": 1380, "text": "Durand et al., 2000;", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "As a consequence of the rapid growth and development of the penaeid aquaculture industry, many of the most significant shrimp pathogens were moved from the regions where they initially appeared to new regions even before the ''new\" pathogen had been recognized, named, proven to cause the ''new\" disease, and before reliable diagnostic methods were developed. The diseases due to the shrimp viruses IHHNV, TSV and WSSV were all transferred with live shrimp stocks from country to country and from one continent to another well before their etiology was understood and diagnostic methods were available. With some diseases, the introduced pathogen encountered totally naive hosts with little or no innate resistance. The pandemics due to the penaeid viruses WSSV and TSV, and to a lesser extent to IHHNV, IMNV and YHV, have collectively cost the penaeid shrimp industry billions of dollars in lost crops, jobs, and export revenue ( Table 2 ). The social and economic impacts of the pandemics caused by these pathogens have been profound in countries in which shrimp farming constitutes a significant industry. This paper reviews the current status of the virus diseases due to TSV, WSSV, IHHNV, IMNV, and YHV in the Americas in terms of their biology, history, distribution, production impacts, and the methods for their management in shrimp aquaculture in the Americas. Not included in this review will be information on the baculovirus caused diseases caused by Monodon baculovirus (MBV), Baculovirus penaei (BP) and Baculoviral midgut gland necrosis (BMN). Of these only BP is native (and enzootic) in wild American penaeids and is an occasional problem for shrimp farmers (Lightner, 1996a; OIE, 2006b) . However, there is little new information on BP-caused disease in the Americas or elsewhere that is not well covered in other reviews (Lightner, 1996a; Flegel, 2006; OIE, 2006b) . , with a density of 1.40 g/ml in CsCl.

Shortly after its discovery in L. stylirostris, the virus was found in L. vannamei being cultured at the same facility in Hawaii and these L. vannamei were shown to be generally asymptomatic carriers of the virus (Lightner et al., 1983b; Bell and Lightner, 1984) . Some members of populations of L. stylirostris and L. vannamei that survive IHHNV infections and/or epizootics, may carry the virus for life and pass the virus onto their progeny and other populations by horizontal and vertical transmission (Bell and Lightner, 1984; Lightner, 1996a; Motte et al., 2003) .

With RDS, affected shrimp present irregular, reduced growth and cuticular deformities and generally no remarkable elevation in mortality ( Fig. 3c-f ) (Kalagayan et al., 1991; Browdy et al., 1993; Bray et al., 1994; Brock and Main, 1994; Lightner, 1996a) . Hence, the economic and production impacts of IHHNV infection in L. vannamei are due to reduced and irregular growth and small count size shrimp at harvest and not to elevated mortality (OIE, 2006b) . To mitigate this effect, several strategies have been used. With one strategy, selected lines of L. stylirostris were developed that were not only resistant to IHHN disease but also refractory to infection Dhar et al., 2001) . IHHNV-free lines of L. vannamei were also developed as SPF (specific pathogen-free) lines and these stocks were the first developed in the SPF stock development program (Wyban et al., 1992; Pruder et al., 1995; Moss et al., 2002) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 118, "end": 142, "text": "(Lightner et al., 1983b;", "ref_id": "BIBREF82"}, {"start": 143, "end": 167, "text": "Bell and Lightner, 1984)", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 252, "end": 276, "text": "(Kalagayan et al., 1991)", "ref_id": "BIBREF62"}, {"start": 430, "end": 454, "text": "(Kalagayan et al., 1991;", "ref_id": "BIBREF62"}, {"start": 455, "end": 475, "text": "Browdy et al., 1993;", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 476, "end": 494, "text": "Bray et al., 1994;", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 495, "end": 516, "text": "Brock and Main, 1994;", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 517, "end": 533, "text": "Lightner, 1996a)", "ref_id": "BIBREF73"}, {"start": 722, "end": 734, "text": "(OIE, 2006b)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 943, "end": 961, "text": "Dhar et al., 2001)", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}, {"start": 1133, "end": 1153, "text": "(Wyban et al., 1992;", "ref_id": "BIBREF161"}, {"start": 1154, "end": 1174, "text": "Pruder et al., 1995;", "ref_id": "BIBREF132"}, {"start": 1175, "end": 1193, "text": "Moss et al., 2002)", "ref_id": "BIBREF106"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 418, "end": 427, "text": "Fig. 3c-f", "ref_id": "FIGREF1"}], "section": "Hosts, history and geographic distribution of IHHN disease"}, {"text": "After its initial discovery in cultured shrimp in Hawaii in 1981, IHHNV was subsequently found to be widely distributed in cultured shrimp in the Americas and in wild shrimp collected along the Pacific coast from Peru to Mexico.

Molecular studies show considerable variation among Asian isolates of the virus (Tang et al., 2003; Krabsetsve et al., 2004; Tang and Lightner, 2006) , while little variation was found in isolates from the Americas (Tang and Lightner, 2002) . All isolates of IHHNV from the zAmericas are nearly identical with IHHNV from the Philippines. This finding, along with other aspects of its history and epidemiology of IHHN in the Americas, suggests that IHHNV was introduced from the Philippines, perhaps with live P. monodon that were imported in the early 1970s as a candidate aquaculture species during the very early development of shrimp farming in the Americas (Lightner, 1996b; Tang and Lightner, 2002; Tang et al., 2003) . In addition to the Americas/Philippines genotype of IHHNV, three other genetic variants of the virus have been documented. For the purposes of this review, the IHHNV genotype from the Americas/Philippines genotype will be designated as IHHNV-I; the variant from south-east Asia will be designated IHHNV-II; and the IHHNV variant from East Africa, Madagascar and Mauritius and from Australia will be referred to as IHHNV-III. The first two genotypes (IHHNV-I and IHHNV-II) are infectious to the representative penaeids, L. vannamei and P. monodon, while the latter genetic variant has been demonstrated to be not infectious to these species (Tang et al., 2003; Krabsetsve et al., 2004; Tang and Lightner, 2006) . The apparent reason for the lack of infectivity of the IHHNV-III genotype was recently explained by the discovery that the DNA fragment represented by IHHNV-III is incorporated and (e-g). IHHNV-infected cell nuclei, some with distinct CIAs, are stained dark blue-black with the IHHNV DIG-labeled probe in the gills (e), hematopoietic nodule (f), and ventral nerve cord of a L. vannamei (g). cytoplasmic accumulations of IHHNV are apparent in the ventral nerve cord (g) and in developing oocytes in the ovary of a L. vannamei (h) where IHHNV appears to be being deposited as yolk.

The coefficient of variation (CV = the standard deviation divided by the mean of different size groups within a population) for populations with RDS is typically greater than 30% and may approach 90%, while IHHNV-free (and thus RDS-free) populations of juvenile L. vannamei and L. stylirostris usually show CVs of 10-30% (Kalagayan et al., 1991; Browdy et al., 1993; Brock and Main, 1994; Carr et al., 1996; Lightner, 1996a; Motte et al., 2003) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 238, "end": 262, "text": "(Kalagayan et al., 1991;", "ref_id": "BIBREF62"}, {"start": 263, "end": 282, "text": "Motte et al., 2003)", "ref_id": "BIBREF107"}, {"start": 365, "end": 382, "text": "(Lightner, 1996a;", "ref_id": "BIBREF73"}, {"start": 383, "end": 412, "text": "Primavera and Quinitio, 2000)", "ref_id": "BIBREF131"}, {"start": 1122, "end": 1146, "text": "(Kalagayan et al., 1991;", "ref_id": "BIBREF62"}, {"start": 1147, "end": 1167, "text": "Browdy et al., 1993;", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 1168, "end": 1189, "text": "Brock and Main, 1994;", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 1190, "end": 1208, "text": "Carr et al., 1996;", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 1209, "end": 1225, "text": "Lightner, 1996a;", "ref_id": "BIBREF73"}, {"start": 1226, "end": 1245, "text": "Motte et al., 2003)", "ref_id": "BIBREF107"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "IHHN gross signs in L. vannamei"}, {"text": "Histological demonstration of prominent intranuclear, Cowdry type A inclusion bodies provides a provisional diagnosis of IHHNV infection ( Fig. 4a-d) .

These findings implicate birds as being an na\u00efve shrimp exposed to There is some evidence that flying aquatic insects such as the water boatman (Trichocorixa reticulata [Corixidae]) that feed on shrimp carcasses can also serve as mechanical vectors of TSV (Brock, 1997; Lightner, 1995 Lightner, , 1996b .

Following experimental or natural infection, Taura syndrome has three distinct phases in the disease: acute, transition and chronic (Brock, 1997; Hasson et al., 1999b) (Fig. 6) . In disease outbreaks at farms, the onset of mortality is often sudden and massive with moribund shrimp coming to the pond surface or edges where large numbers of shrimp-eating birds may be attracted to the dead and dying shrimp. Moribund shrimp in the acute phase of the disease typically present a pink to reddish coloration due to expansion of red cuticular chromatophores (especially in the tail fan), are off feed and with empty guts, and they are lethargic (Fig. 6a) . The acute phase is rapid in individual shrimp, probably lasting less than 24 h, but the acute phase in a shrimp farm pond may last for several days in an affected population (Brock, 1997; Garza et al., 1997; Hasson et al., 1999b) . As implied by its name, the transition (or recovery in some publications) phase of Taura syndrome is that phase of the disease when affected shrimp may resolve the lesions due to TSV infection that developed in the acute phase. Shrimp in the transition phase typically present randomly distributed variably sized melanized lesions in or under the cuticle (exoskeleton) (Fig. 6b) . Those shrimp that successfully resolve the acute-phase TSV lesions and survive the next molting process, typically appear normal. Death due to TSV infection during the three phases most often occurs in the acute phase, probably due to osmotic failure. In the transition phase of the disease, death may also occur due to osmotic failure as a consequence of widespread destruction of the cuticular epithelium or by systemic infections by opportunistic bacteria (Lightner, 1996a; Brock, 1997) . Shrimp in the chronic phase of Taura syndrome may carry the virus for life as a persistent infection (Lotz, 1997b; Hasson et al., 1999b) . While persistently infected L. vannamei may appear and behave normally, they show slightly less tolerance to low salinity stress than uninfected shrimp (Lotz et al., 2005) . Some members of populations of L. vannamei or L. stylirostris that survive TSV infections and/or epizootics may carry the virus for life and, although not documented, pass the virus onto their progeny by vertical transmission (Hasson et al., 1999a,b; OIE, 2006b) .

The enteric organs (endodermderived hepatopancreas, midgut and midgut caeca mucosal epithelia) and smooth, cardiac, striated muscle, and the ventral nerve cord, its branches and its ganglia typically show no histological signs of infection by TSV and are usually negative for TSV by ISH Lightner, 1996a Lightner, ,b, 2003a Brock, 1997; OIE, 2006b) . In H&E stained preparations, acute-phase TSV lesions (Fig. 7a-d) are presented as multifocal areas of necrosis in the cuticular epithelium of the general body surface, appendages, gills, hindgut, and foregut (the esophagus, anterior and posterior chambers of the stomach). Prominent in the multifocal cuticular lesions are conspicuous foci of affected cells that display an increased eosinophilia of the cytoplasm and pyknotic or karyorrhectic nuclei. Cytoplasmic remnants of necrotic cells are often abundant in these TS acute-phase lesions and these are generally presented as spherical bodies (1-20 lm in diameter) that range in staining from eosinophilic to pale basophilic. These structures, along with pyknotic and karyorrhectic nuclei, give acute-phase TS lesions a characteristic 'peppered' or 'buckshot-riddled' appearance, which is considered to be pathognomonic for TS disease when there is no concurrent necrosis of the parenchymal cells of the lymphoid organ tubules (Fig. 7a-b) . The absence of necrosis of the lymphoid organ in acute-phase TSV infections distinguishes TS disease from acute phase yellow head disease in which similar patterns of necrosis to those induced by TSV may occur in the cuticular epithelium and gills (Lightner, 1996a; Bondad-Reantaso et al., 2001; OIE, 2006b) .

Later, outbreaks of viral disease with similar gross signs and caused by similar rod-shaped viruses were reported from elsewhere in Asia and other names were applied: hypodermal and hematopoietic necrosis baculovirus (HHNBV) in the People's Republic of China (Huang et al., 1995a,b) ; white spot baculovirus (WSBV) and PmNOBIII in Taipei China Lo et al., 1996) ; and systemic ectodermal and mesodermal baculovirus (SEMBV) or PmNOBII in Thailand (Wongteerasupaya et al., 1995) . The virus from the People's Republic of China has also been called Chinese baculovirus (CBV) (Lu et al., 1997; . Shrimp exhibiting the gross signs and histopathology of WSD have also been reported from Korea (Kim et al., 1998) , India (Karunasagar et al., 1998) , the Philippines, and the USA (Lightner, 1996b; Durand et al., 2000) . WSSV has even reached shrimp farms in southeastern Europe (1997) and the Middle East (1999) via live shrimp movements, and Australia and Spain with introductions of frozen infected shrimp, which were used as fresh food for broodstock (OIE, 2006b) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 53, "end": 70, "text": "(Lo et al., 1996;", "ref_id": "BIBREF90"}, {"start": 71, "end": 84, "text": "Flegel, 1997;", "ref_id": "BIBREF41"}, {"start": 85, "end": 113, "text": "Flegel and Alday-Sanz, 1998;", "ref_id": "BIBREF43"}, {"start": 582, "end": 604, "text": "(Inouye et al., , 1996", "ref_id": "BIBREF58"}, {"start": 605, "end": 625, "text": "Nakano et al., 1994)", "ref_id": "BIBREF110"}, {"start": 1094, "end": 1110, "text": "Lo et al., 1996)", "ref_id": "BIBREF90"}, {"start": 1195, "end": 1225, "text": "(Wongteerasupaya et al., 1995)", "ref_id": "BIBREF160"}, {"start": 1321, "end": 1338, "text": "(Lu et al., 1997;", "ref_id": "BIBREF96"}, {"start": 1436, "end": 1454, "text": "(Kim et al., 1998)", "ref_id": "BIBREF65"}, {"start": 1463, "end": 1489, "text": "(Karunasagar et al., 1998)", "ref_id": "BIBREF64"}, {"start": 1521, "end": 1538, "text": "(Lightner, 1996b;", "ref_id": "BIBREF74"}, {"start": 1539, "end": 1559, "text": "Durand et al., 2000)", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}, {"start": 1796, "end": 1808, "text": "(OIE, 2006b)", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1009, "end": 1032, "text": "(Huang et al., 1995a,b)", "ref_id": "FIGREF3"}], "section": "History and geographic distribution of white spot disease"}, {"text": "Beginning in 1999, WSD has also had a severe impact on the shrimp industries of both Central and South America (GAA, 1999a,b; Durand et al., 2000; Vidal et al., 2001; Lightner, 2003a,b; OIE, 2006b) .

By mid to late 1999, WSSV was causing major losses in Ecuador (then among the world's top producers of farmed shrimp), and by 2000-2001, export of shrimp from Ecuador was down nearly 70% from pre-WSSV levels (Rosenberry, 2001 (Rosenberry, , 2003 Lightner, 2003a) . Although the documentation is sketchy, WSSV has been found in wild shrimp stocks in the Americas (Nunan et al., 2001; Chapman et al., 2004) . In the US, the virus was successfully eradicated from shrimp farms and, except for an outbreak at an isolated shrimp farm on the Island of Kauai, Hawaii in 2004 (CEI, 2004 Ostrowski, 2004) , it has not been reported from farmed shrimp stocks in the USA since 1997. However, its sporadic detection in wild shrimp stocks (Pacific Coast of Panama, Gulf of Mexico and SE Atlantic states) (Nunan et al., 2001; Chapman et al., 2004; Hasson et al., 2006) suggests that it has become established in wild penaeid shrimp stocks in coastal waters of the eastern Pacific and southeastern US and the Gulf of Mexico, or that it continues to be introduced perhaps with wastes (peeled shells, etc.) from value-added reprocessing of imported shrimp in coastal packing plants or from infected shrimp used as bait by sport fishermen. It has been proposed that the introductions of WSSV to the Americas were the result of importation of frozen shrimp products from WSSV-affected areas of Asia and the value-added reprocessing of those frozen shrimp for the US market in coastal processing plants (Nunan et al., 1998b; Durand et al., 2000; Lightner et al., 2001; Lightner, 2003a) or possibly due to the use of imported frozen WSSV-infected shrimp as bait by sport fishermen (Hasson et al., 2006) . WSSV also reached Spain and Australia in 2000-2001. In both cases successful containment and eradication was reported, and for both events the importation and use of infected frozen shrimp as a fresh feed for broodstock was implicated as the route of introduction (OIE, 2003; Lightner, 2003b) .
