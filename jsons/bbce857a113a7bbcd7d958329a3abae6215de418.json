Predictions of the further course of the epidemic are decisive to deploy targeted disease control measures. We consider a network-based model to describe the 2019-nCoV epidemic in the Hubei province. The network is composed of the cities in Hubei and their interactions (e.g., traffic flow). However, the precise interactions between cities is unknown and must be inferred from observing the epidemic. We propose a network-based method to predict the future prevalence of the 2019-nCoV virus in every city. Our results indicate that network-based modelling is beneficial for an accurate forecast of the epidemic outbreak.",

To obtain a more detailed picture of the epidemic, the development of epidemic outbreak prediction methods is focal. A diverse body of research considers the prediction of general epidemics. For instance, prediction methods are based on Kalman filtering [17] , Bayesian model averaging [18] , basic regression [19] and kernel density estimation [20] . Recent work focussed on the dependency of population flow and the viral spread [21, 22, 23, 24] . As shown by Pei et al. [25] , the spread of influenza can be more accurately predicted by taking the population flow between cities into account. Read et al. [12] predicted the 2019-nCoV epidemic by using the Official Aviation Guide (OAG) Traffic Analyser dataset. Additionally to the OAG dataset, Wu et al.

At the initial time k = 1, it is realistic to assume that R i [1] = 0 holds for every city i. At any time k \u2265 2, the removed individuals R i [k] could be obtained from (1), if the curing probability \u03b4 i were known. However, we do not know the curing probability \u03b4 i .

We did not assume any prior knowledge on the interactions between cities. The prediction method is evaluated on past data of the 2019-nCoV outbreak in Hubei. Our results indicate that a network-based modelling approach may yield more accurate predictions than modelling the epidemic for each city independently. We believe that the prediction method can be further improved, e.g., by using traffic flow patterns as prior knowledge. [37] R.

We denote the N \u00d7 1 infection state vector by I[k] = (I 1 [k], ..., I N [k]) T at any time k. The loop starting in line 8 iterates over all candidate values of the curing probability \u03b4 i which are in the set \u2126. Algorithm 1 calls the network inference method, which is stated in pseudocode by Algorithm 2. For a fixed curing probability \u03b4 i , the network inference in line 12 returns an estimate for the infection probabilities \u03b2 i1 (\u03b4 i ), ..., \u03b2 iN (\u03b4 i ). Furthermore, the network inference returns the mean squared error MSE (\u03b4 i ), which corresponds to the first term in the objective of (5). The smaller the mean squared error MSE (\u03b4 i ), the better the fit of the SIR model(1) to the data I i[1], ..., I i [n]. In line 14, the final estimate\u03b4 i for the curing probability is obtained as the minimiser of the mean squared error MSE (\u03b4 i ). The estimate\u03b4 i determines the final estimates\u03b2 i1 , ...,\u03b2 iN for the infection probabilities in line 15.
