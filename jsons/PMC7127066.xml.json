Interactions between the host immune response, the virulence of the infecting organism, and the size of the inoculums determine whether a patient develops pneumonia.13 Defective cough, mucociliary clearance, and impaired local and humoral immunity predispose to severe pneumonia. Alcohol consumption and smoking are independent risk factors for the development of pneumonia. Medical comorbidities such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), congestive heart failure, chronic kidney disease, liver disease, and immune deficiency states have an increased predisposition for the development of CAP. Recent use of proton pump inhibitor therapy started within 30 days has been identified as a risk factor for CAP.14 Elderly patients are at increased risk for development of pneumonia and, when it occurs, they are more likely to die than younger individuals.2 Although many patients develop severe pneumonia because of immune impairment, others develop acute lung injury (acute respiratory distress syndrome [ARDS]) as a consequence of unilateral pneumonia because of an inability to localize the immune response to the initial site of infection, possibly because of the presence of a genetic variation in their immune responsiveness.15, 16\n",

Gram-negative bacteria have been associated with severe CAP, and K pneumoniae was noted to be an independent risk factor for mortality in severe CAP.18 In one study from Korea, in a multivariate analysis, the risk factors associated with gram-negative CAP were septic shock (with an odds ratio of 4.1), cardiac disease, smoking, hyponatremia, and dyspnea, emphasizing the association of these organisms with severe illness.19\nEnterobacter CAP behaves more like hospital-acquired pneumonia and is associated with prolonged mechanical ventilation, delay in initiation of antibiotics, and longer ICU stay.20 Risk factors for community-acquired P aeruginosa pneumonia include bronchiectasis, immunocompromised state, use of multiple courses of antibiotics, prolonged glucocorticoids in patients with COPD, and recent hospitalization.21 Anaerobic organisms should be considered when aspiration is suspected.",

Serum levels tend to be high in patients with CAP, who benefit from antibiotic therapy, and in those with an increased risk of death from CAP. Serial measurements of serum levels have also been used to define when antibiotics can be safely stopped in the presence of CAP.12, 44, 45 In one study of 302 patients with radiographic infiltrates and suspected CAP, initiation of antibiotics and duration of therapy were determined by randomizing patients to management by an algorithm dictated by serial PCT measurements versus management by clinical assessment.

For inpatients, antibiotics are switched from intravenous to oral once the patient is afebrile for at least 2 occasions 8 hours apart, is able to take food by mouth, and there are clinical signs of improvement (in parameters such as cough, dyspnea, sputum production, oxygenation, and vital sign abnormalities), and this usually happens by the second or third hospital day. The switch to oral antibiotics can also be done for bacteremic patients, although it may take longer for these patients to reach clinical stability compared with nonbacteremic patients.67 Use of PCT as a guide to decide on the duration of antibiotic use is supported by clinical trial data.46 The duration of therapy should be a minimum of 5 days, providing that the patient is afebrile for 48 to 72 hours, there is no sign of extrapulmonary infection, the correct therapy was used initially, and the organism identified is not S aureus or P aeruginosa.",

Diagnostic testing can include a chest CT scan, bronchoscopy, and, in some cases, open lung biopsy. Organizing pneumonia is a complication of viral lung infection and other processes, and is characterized by fibroblast proliferation and diagnosed by a combination of radiographic findings, bronchoscopic lung biopsy, and the absence of ongoing infection.

A connection between the pleural space and the lung can develop and result in a bronchopleural fistula, which can be caused by erosion of the lung infection to the pleural surface. Bronchopleural fistula is initially treated conservatively with antibiotics and a chest tube, but sometimes requires surgical repair. Localized bronchiectasis can be a long-term sequela of CAP, as a result of injury and dilation of the bronchus, and can be seen on CT scan of the chest.
