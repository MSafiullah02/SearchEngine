Although antibiotics have largely supplanted their use in bacterial infections, convalescent plasma can be an important option in the treatment of many viral infections when specific antiviral treatments are largely unavailable and the infection carries serious morbidities and mortalities [3].",

To equip with the ability to well respond to the novel infectious disease threats so as to reduce mortality and morbidity, it is now timely and of utmost importance to revisit the preparedness of convalescent plasma production and usage.",

Hong Kong Red Cross Blood Transfusion Service (BTS), as part of the investigating team, was responsible for harvesting the convalescent plasma in accordance to prevailing blood donation standard [8]. A total of 9101 people who had confirmed to have recovered from influenza A (H1N1) were contacted. Screening appointments were made for 1309 potential donors and 786 attended. About 493 potential donors were found to be eligible for plasma donation, but only 301 attended the apheresis plasma donation appointment. Another 379 donors who satisfied the criteria donated one unit of whole blood each. A total of 276 litres of convalescent plasma were eventually sent to fractionation to produce H\u2010IVIG (Fig. 1) [8]. Because of the need of larger volume and the time lead required for fractionation, the clinical team also made use of some of the convalescent plasma collected to treat some of the seriously affected patients [9]. The use of convalescent plasma or H\u2010IVIG was significantly associated with lower respiratory tract viral load and mortality in the treatment group [7, 9].",

Besides, there were organizational and technological challenges in the collection, production and use of the products [3]. Nevertheless, the BTS was able to collect the volume of plasma needed for the production of H\u2010IVIG despite various limiting factors (e.g. difficult or failure to contact) as well as the impending urgency to accomplish the recruitment and collection within the shortest possible time. It provided an excellent opportunity to the BTS in the mobilization of existing resources and expertise within a short period of time to cope with the recruitment of large number of recovered patients. Further refinement of local factors for recruitment strategy and operational logistics would be beneficial in the event that large\u2010scale plasma collection is needed [8].",

Following the reports of beneficial responses to convalescent plasma, the Ministry of Health of China updated recently their draft treatment protocol to second edition [10]. With the previous experience of convalescent plasma collection and the various clinical results for its use in different respiratory tract infectious diseases [7, 9, 11, 12], it is conceivable that in the battle of COVID\u201019 pandemic, preparation of collecting convalescent plasma should be planned now. On one hand, it is important to stand ready to provide adequate safe and effective products that could potentially save many lives in this pandemic. On the other hand, it is necessary to ensure that its collection, production and use take place in accordance to all necessary ethical considerations so as to produce an evidence base for its role in managing the severely COVID\u201019 affected patients.",
