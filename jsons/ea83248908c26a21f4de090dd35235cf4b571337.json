Empirical selection of antibiotic treatment is the cornerstone of management of patients with pneumonia. To reduce the misuse of antibiotics, antibiotic resistance, and side-eff ects, an empirical, eff ective, and individualised antibiotic treatment is needed. Follow-up after the start of antibiotic treatment is also important, and management should include early shifts to oral antibiotics, stewardship according to the microbiological results, and short-duration antibiotic treatment that accounts for the clinical stability criteria. New approaches for fast clinical (lung ultrasound) and microbiological (molecular biology) diagnoses are promising. Community-acquired pneumonia is associated with early and late mortality and increased rates of cardiovascular events. Studies are needed that focus on the long-term management of pneumonia.",

When the probability of a diff erential diagnosis is high, careful assessment is needed because delays in correct diagnoses increase the risks of poor outcomes. 12 In patients with not-severe community-acquired pneumonia, the main diff erential diagnosis is upper respiratory infection. In these cases, clinicians should rely on clinical evaluations (including manifestations of LRTI, focal chest sounds, exclusion of other possible diagnosis) and point-of-care tests (eg, C-reactive protein [CRP] ). 6 Patients with severe community-acquired pneumonia should be monitored for other life-threatening disorders. Because diff erentiation of pneumonia from noninfectious disorders such as acute heart failure is occasionally diffi cult, prompt start of antibiotic treatment is recommended. Biomarkers (eg, procalcitonin [PCT]) can help in the early diff erentiation from heart failure decompensation, avoiding antibiotic misuse. 13 When the diagnosis of pneumonia is excluded, antibiotic treatment must be stopped. Dynamic evaluation of the patient also helps the clinician in terms of management (eg, pulmonary infi ltrates that resolve completely after positive pressure ventilation are probably due to heart failure or atelectasis). In patients with recurrent pneumonia, underlying diseases should be suspected such as lung cancer, metastasis, tuberculosis, foreign bodies, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, and unknown immunosuppressed status.",

Microaspiration of contaminated secretions can cause infections in the lower airways. The glottal refl exes, the presence of complement proteins and immunoglobulins, the secretion of peptides with antimicrobial activities, and the inhibition of bacteria binding all protect the lower airways. 36 The healthy microbiota of the upper airway also exert protection eff ects by competing with pathogens for nutritional resources and interacting with cellular receptors. The use of broad-spectrum antibiotics can modify the microbiota and predispose to infection. 37 The interactions between the virulence of the pathogens, the amount of inoculum, and the innate and adaptive immune responses determine the development of pneumonia. 36",

            "text": "Antibiotic treatment is typically chosen empirically because of the absence of microbiological results upon diagnosis. The choice of the empirical antibiotic depends on the most likely pathogen, individual risk factors, comorbidities, allergies, and cost-eff ectiveness (appendix). Figure 2 and the table describe the management and antibiotic treatment proposed by community-acquired Several studies have shown reductions in mortality when these guidelines are followed. 71, 72 Guidelines suggest the coverage of S pneumoniae and atypical pathogens (eg, combination of a \u03b2-lactam plus macrolide or respiratory fl ouroquinolone). 3,6 However, dual coverage is still debated, 6,73 and three metaanalyses reported diff erent results about mortality. [74] [75] [76] Furthermore, concerns exist about side-eff ects (such as an increased risk of cardiovascular events in patients who receive macrolides) 77, 78 and selective pressure for resistance to macrolides and fl uoroquinolone. Two recent randomised controlled trials provided important results about antibiotic treatment for people admitted into hospital with non-severe communityacquired pneumonia. A cluster-crossover trial assessed the non-inferiority of \u03b2-lactam versus \u03b2-lactam plus macrolide versus fl uoroquinolone regimens with 90 day mortality as the primary outcome. Including 2283 patients with clinically suspected pneumonia treated in non-intensivecare-unit wards, monotherapy with \u03b2-lactam was not inferior to the other antibiotic regimens. 79 Another noninferiority, open-label trial randomly assigned 580 patients with moderately severe community-acquired pneumonia to receive \u03b2-lactam or \u03b2-lactam plus macrolide. 80 The study was unable to show non-inferiority for clinical stability after 7 days of treatment. Nevertheless, a non-signifi cant trend for superiority was shown in favour of dual therapy (between-group diff erence 7\u00b76%, two-sided 95% CI \u22120\u00b78% to 16\u00b70%). For severe community-acquired pneumonia, coverage of typical and atypical pathogens seems to be protective of mortality and is recommended by major guidelines. 3-5 Macrolides seem to have additional benefi ts due to their immuno modulatory eff ects in severe community-acquired pneumonia. 81, 82 A small proportion of patients with specifi c pathogens require a diff erent treatment because they do not respond to the standard empirical treatment. 34 For this reason, the 2005 American Thoracic Society and Infectious Diseases Society of America nosocomial pneumonia guidelines introduced a new category of pneumonia called health-care-associated pneumonia to help clinicians to select patients who need an extendedspectrum antibiotic due to a high probability of resistant pathogens. 83 This defi nition has been widely criticised because it has many limitations, and studies have shown it not to be accurate in the detection of at-risk patients. 84, 85 Other scores have been developed and have better accuracies; however, they also have some limitations and still need strong external validation. 34, [86] [87] [88] A summary of risk factors for resistant pathogens is contained in the appendix. Because resistant pathogens have diff erent treatments, scores based on specifi c risk factors for each pathogen might be more useful methods compared with general defi nitions. 34, 35, 89 Another concern is related to the treatment of patients who are at risk for resistant pneumococcus, such as elderly patients (age >65 years), those who have received recent therapy with \u03b2-lactams, macrolides, or fl uoroquinolones; alcohol consumption; and immunosuppression (appendix). 3, 90 New antibiotics are urgently needed for infections because of the spread of resistance in some settings. A recent phase 3 trial showed promising results for ceftaroline fosamil, a fi fth-generation cephalosporin with activity against MRSA, in the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia with PSI III-IV in Asian patients. 91 Among macrolides, solithro mycin is a potential new antibiotic with activity against macrolideresistant bacteria. 92 The effi cacy of neuraminidase inhibitors to prevent and treat infl uenza pneumonia is still controversial. 93 For patients with infl uenza A H1N1, a recent meta-analysis \u2020Respiratory fl uoroquinolone limited to situations in which other options cannot be prescribed or are ineff ective (eg, hepatotoxicity, skin reactions, cardiac arrhythmias, and tendon rupture). \u2021Preferred \u03b2-lactam drugs include cefotaxime, ceftriaxone, or ampicillin-sulbactam. \u00b6\u03b2-lactamase-stable \u03b2-lactams include co-amoxiclav, cefotaxime, ceftaroline fosamil, ceftriaxone, cefuroxime, and piperacillin-tazobactam. \u00a7Third-generation cephalosporin (eg, cefotaxime, ceftriaxone).

A multicentre randomised controlled trial 112 showed a shorter time to reach clinical stability in patients with pneumonia receiving oral prednisone (50 mg a day for 7 days) in relation to the placebo group (3\u00b70 days vs 4\u00b74 days, hazard ratio 1\u00b733 95% CI 1\u00b715-1\u00b750). Another multicentre randomised controlled trial 113 showed that methylprednisolone (0\u00b75 mg/kg per 12 h for 5 days) reduced risk for treatment failure compared with placebo (OR 0\u00b734, 95% CI 0\u00b714-0\u00b787) in patients with severe communityacquired pneumonia with high baseline concentrations of CRP. For mortality, updated meta-analyses 110, 111, [114] [115] [116] report no conclusive results for hospitalised patients, although corticosteroids were associated with better survival in the subgroup with severe community-acquired pneumonia. [114] [115] [116] [117] However, trials included in the metaanalyses were small, have high heterogeneity, and insuffi cient power to assess mortality. No defi nitive data are available for the best type and dose of corticosteroids for patients with community-acquired pneumonia, nor those for whether they should be given continuously or to intermittent and tapering schemes. 6 The clinician should be aware of possible steroid-induced side-eff ects in patients. In controlled settings (eg, randomised controlled trials), only hyperglycaemia was more frequently reported for patients with community-acquired pneumonia receiving a corticosteroid. However, large trials including patients with severe sepsis or septic shock with community-acquired pneumonia as the main source of infection, showed other steroid side-eff ects such as superinfection. 6, 118 Investigators have proposed statins as an adjunctive therapy in pneumonia due to their anti-infl ammatory activities and ability to reduce cardiovascular events, but their eff ects are controversial. 119",

The development of severe sepsis is the primary reason for failure. 131 Outpatients also need an early follow-up (after 72 h) to detect development of failure. 132 Non-responding pneumonia is a diff erent disorder that comprises the persistence of pulmonary infi ltrates 1 month after symptom onset and can be due to many causes, such as the presence of lung cancer or an underlying lung disease. 3",

Infl uenza vaccines are robustly associated with a reduced rate of pneumonia and better outcomes. 3,4 A study of 286 000 individuals older than 65 years reported a 30% reduction in the rate of pneumonia and infl uenza infection that was followed by a reduction in all-cause mortality. 141 Two vaccines are available for S pneumoniae: the pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine and the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine. The pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine contains polysaccharides for 23 pneumococcal serotypes and the most recent version of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine contains 13 serotypes. By comparison with pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine, the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine seems to induce a stronger and longer-lasting secondary immune response with booster eff ect. 142 Results from a recent meta-analysis showed strong evidence for the recommendation for pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine-23 vaccination to prevent invasive pneumococcal disease in adults. 143 Nevertheless, there is less clear evidence for its effi cacy in the prevention of non-bacteraemic pneumonia, 143 in patients with chronic illnesses, and for the reduction of all-cause pneumonia and mortality. 143 The pneumococcal conjugate vaccine-13 was approved for clinical use in adults by the US and European agencies. The CAPiTA study 144 (a double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled clinical trial involving nearly 85 000 adults older than 65 years) showed clinical effi cacy of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine-13 in the prevention of the fi rst episode of vaccine-serotype pneumococcal community-acquired pneumonia (including non-bacteraemic pneumonia and invasive pneumococcal disease); 144 however, the trial excluded immunosuppressed patients and previously vaccinated person.
