CHIKV can also be transmitted from an infected mother to her child during pregnancy or parturition [2]. Transmission via infected donor blood products and organs is a theoretical risk; however, no cases of transfusion-transmitted or organ transplant-transmitted CHIKV infection have been reported [3].",

Symptoms include high fever, bilateral symmetric joint pain, myalgia, arthritis, maculopapular rash, conjunctivitis, headache, and nausea or vomiting. Clinical laboratory findings can include lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, elevated creatinine, and elevated hepatic transaminases. Rare complications include uveitis, retinitis, myocarditis, hepatitis, nephritis, bullous skin lesions, meningoencephalitis, myelitis, Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome, and cranial nerve palsies [5\u20137]. Mortality is thought to be a rare outcome [8]. Persons at risk for severe disease include neonates exposed intrapartum, adults >65 years old, and people with chronic medical conditions [9, 10]. While the acute illness typically resolves by the end of the third week, some people have a post-acute phase with arthritis, neuropathy, and neuropsychiatric conditions that may last through the third month [10\u201317]. Chronic musculoskeletal symptoms, which are likely mediated by inflammation [13] potentially resulting from viral persistence [18\u201321], may recur or persist more than 3 months after the acute phase of the illness.",

Symptomatic treatment with analgesics and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) is recommended for those with fever and joint symptoms [1]. Aspirin is not recommended due to the increased risk of bleeding, and corticosteroids are not recommended in the acute and post-acute phase as they may cause immunosuppression that may worsen the clinical course [23]. NSAIDs, corticosteroids, and methotrexate are the recommended treatments for chronic chikungunya arthritis [17, 23\u201325].",

Early in the clinical course, chikungunya cases may be difficult to distinguish from cases of dengue, adenoviral disease, influenza, leptospirosis, Zika, and malaria. Testing blood for viral RNA by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) [26] or anti-CHIKV antibodies by IgM antibody capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (MAC-ELISA) [27] allows for a definitive diagnosis. During outbreaks and in resource poor settings, diagnosis often relies on the identification of clinical features consistent with the World Health Organization (WHO) case definition [26]. However, the sensitivity and specificity of this definition is not known and may vary by timing of presentation and age of the patient [27, 28].",

Identifying AFI patients who have chikungunya is important for patients who develop post-acute and/or chronic disease. It can also improve patient outcomes by enabling more timely assessment of patients with other AFIs that require early administration of an antibiotic or antiviral drug, or specific anticipatory guidance. Also, identification of patients with CHIKV infection early, while the patient is still febrile (and viremic), may help limit further transmission of CHIKV within households and communities. In this manuscript, we describe clinical predictors of RT-PCR positive chikungunya cases by the timing of presentation and age compared to two groups: all other AFI cases (CHIKV-negative), and RT-PCR positive dengue cases. To do so, we utilized the first three years of data collected from an ongoing clinical study in which patients presenting to the hospital emergency department with AFI were enrolled and tested for evidence of infection with CHIKV, dengue virus 1\u20134 (DENV-1\u20134), and 20 other pathogens.",

Cases that were only anti-CHIKV MAC-ELISA positive and CHIKV coinfections were not included in our analysis as laboratory-confirmed chikungunya cases. All other AFI cases included 6,916 laboratory-positive and laboratory-negative AFI cases that were not CHIKV RT-PCR positive (n = 1,499), anti-CHIKV MAC-ELISA positive (n = 136), anti-DENV MAC-ELISA positive (n = 285), dengue indeterminate (n = 51), or co-infected (n = 109) AFI cases. A dengue indeterminate case had a negative acute specimen and no serum collected \u22656 DPO available for testing. The number of laboratory-confirmed chikungunya, dengue and other AFI cases were plotted by month and year of illness onset and timing of presentation. Differences in proportions were tested by applying the Chi-square test, and medians were compared using the Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon test. Bonferroni correction was used to account for simultaneous multiple comparisons. Multiple imputation was used to predict an independent plausible value for missing values (percent missing ranged from 0.4\u20138.6%) using generalized linear regression on non-missing variables to create 40 imputed complete data sets [41]. To identify predictors of chikungunya as compared to all other AFI cases and dengue cases separately, stepwise Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) variable selection was used for imputed datasets. Variables retained at least once in the 40 models were included in a pooled Poisson regression model (using weights to account for the pooling) before going through final variable selection [42]. From the final pooled Poisson regression model, relative risk and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated for significant overall (all DPOs), early (<3 DPO), and late (3\u20135 DPO) predictors, along with any significant interactions with age group (<5-year-old, 5\u201319-year-old, 20\u201349-year-old, and \u226550-year-old). The final models included the age and the variables listed in S2 Table. The adjusted relative risks (aRR) were calculated by comparing cases with the significant predictor who were CHIKV RT-PCR positive to other AFI cases (or DENV RT-PCR positive), divided by the comparison of cases without the significant predictor who were CHIKV RT-PCR positive to other AFI cases (or DENV RT-PCR positive), and adjusted for the other statistically significant predictors in the models. Data were analyzed using the \u201cmi\u201d and \u201cMASS\u201d packages from R software (V3.3.0, R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria).",
