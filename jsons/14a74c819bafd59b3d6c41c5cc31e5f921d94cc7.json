            "text": "Viruses are important triggers of COPD exacerbation [9, 19] but rhinovirus has not hitherto been considered to be of much significance during exacerbations of COPD. In a study of 44 chronic bronchitics over 2 yrs, STOTT et al. [19] found rhinovirus in 13 (14.9%) of 87 exacerbations of chronic bronchitis using viral culture methods. In a more detailed study of 25 chronic bronchitics with 116 exacerbations over 4 yrs and using similar methods, GUMP et al. [9] found that only 3.4% of exacerbations could be attributed to rhinovirus. In a more recent study of 35 episodes of COPD exacerbation using serological methods and nasal samples for viral culture, little evidence was found for a rhinovirus aetiology of COPD exacerbation [20] . Other viruses may trigger COPD exacerbation, although coronavirus was associated with only a small proportion of asthmatic exacerbations [6, 18] and all the COPD patients in the present study had undergone influenza immunization. Although bacteria such as Haemophilus influenzae and Streptococcus Pneumoniae have been associated with COPD exacerbation, recent studies have not shown increased bacterial counts during exacerbation [21] . Conventional diagnostic methods for rhinovirus infection, discussed above, were limited by the poor sensitivity of cell cultures for rhinovirus. Serological diagnosis of rhinovirus is hampered by the large number of serotypes (>100) and limited cross-reactivity [22] . Recently, it has been found that detection of rhinovirus could be improved by up to five times using PCR [14, 23] . Thus, using PCR, rhinovirus has been shown to be the predominant virus, associated with 50% of asthmatic exacerbations in children and 33% in adults and 19% of exacerbations of cystic fibrosis, with smaller proportions of exacerbations attributed to other viruses [6, 18, 24] . Using limiting dilutions of human rhinovirus 14, the PCR used in the present study has been shown to have a detection limit of 1610 3 median tissue culture infective doses . mL -1 by gel electrophoresis [14] . In the present study, only one of the 10 samples rhinovirus-positive by PCR yielded positive results by viral culture methods, again demonstrating the superiority of PCR techniques. However, all previous studies of naturally acquired rhinovirus infection have used upper airway samples (either throat swabs or nasal aspirates) and no previous comparison has been made between upper and lower airway samples using induced sputum as in the present study. Rhinovirus was detected in four induced sputum samples in the present study but not in the corresponding nasopharyngeal samples, giving a 40% higher detection rate for rhinovirus using induced sputum and suggesting that rhinovirus may directly infect the lower airway. These results also indicate that induced sputum is suitable and preferable for rhinovirus detection and are consistent with those of HORN et al. [25] who showed that viruses were more frequently detected in sputum than nasal and throat swabs in children with wheezy bronchitis. Contamination of lower airway specimens by upper airway secretions cannot entirely be ruled out, but, as induced sputum samples the lower airway, the present study contributes to evidence that naturally acquired rhinovirus infection may infect the lower airway. COPD exacerbation is defined by clinical criteria [3\u00b15, 10] although these are not considered useful for determining the cause of the exacerbation [26] . An exacerbation was regarded as having occurred when there were at least two symptoms, at least one of which was major, thus the presence of a cold as an upper airway symptom by itself did not constitute an exacerbation [3\u00b15] . However, in the current study, it was shown that the symptom combination most strongly associated with rhinovirus detection was a cold with increased sputum, and rhinovirus infection was associated with a greater total symptom score at COPD exacerbation. Furthermore, 20% of the patients with rhinovirus infection had no nasal symptoms. No differences in spirometric changes were found between rhinovirus and nonrhinovirus COPD exacerbation, although common colds have been associated with changes in lower airway resistance in normal patients [27] . Changes in lower airway inflammatory indices have been associated with experimental rhinovirus infection [7, 28] . It has previously been shown that there are increased inflammatory changes in the lower airway during COPD exacerbation [4] . As in the previous study, it was found that induced sputum IL-6 levels increased significantly at exacerbation compared to baseline, although there were no corresponding changes in IL-8 concentration or cell counts [4] . Rhinovirus detection was associated with the presence of increased IL-6 concentration at exacerbation compared to baseline but not with IL-8 changes, which were variable. Lower airway IL-8 levels have been shown to increase with experimental rhinovirus type 16 infection in normal and asthmatic patients in some studies [29] , but not in others [28] . However, COPD patients already have upregulated airway IL-8 levels when stable, possibly due to their high sputum neutrophil load [30] , and so a further increase in IL-8 concentration at COPD exacerbation would be unlikely.",

            "text": "Using a transformed epithelial cell line, rhinovirus has been shown to attach to airway epithelium [31] and to increase IL-6 production from epithelial cells through a nuclear factor-kB-dependent transcription pathway [32] . This could explain the increased IL-6 levels in induced sputum from patients with rhinovirus infection in the present study. Experimental rhinovirus infection has been shown to cause increased IL-6 levels in nasal washings, which were related to symptom scores [33] . In the present study, it was found that total symptom score was related to rhinovirus detection but not to IL-6 levels. Experimental rhinovirus infection has also been shown to cause increased inflammatory marker levels in normal subjects and asthmatics, with increases in sputum IL-6 concentration [7, 28, 29] , although COPD patients have not been studied as it is not possible to infect patients with COPD in view of their restricted lung function. Thus IL-6 may play an important part in the pathogenesis of rhinovirus infection. IL-6 also plays a central role in the host response to stress and injury through its ability to induce the acute phase response. However, IL-6 may also have effects on B-cell differentiation, stimulate mucosal immunoglobulin A responses and function as a costimulator of T-cells. Thus increased IL-6 levels may protect against further human rhinovirus infection and this may explain the tendency of patients in the present study with lower IL-6 levels at baseline to become infected with rhinovirus. Susceptibility to rhinovirus infection may be increased by the cytokine tumour necrosis factor-a and reduced by interferon gamma [32, 34] , although the effect of IL-6 has not been previously evaluated.",
