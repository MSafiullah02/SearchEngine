These include conditions that look like diseases but are not; conditions that are diseases but that (currently) have no diagnostic criteria; and other types, including those relating to risk for disease. I present a typology of clinical conditions by examining factors important for characterizing clinical conditions. By attending to the types of clinical conditions possible on the basis of these key factors (symptomaticity, dysfunction, and the meeting of diagnostic criteria), I draw attention to how diseases and other clinical conditions as currently classified can be better categorized, highlighting the issues pertaining to certain typology categories. Through detailed analysis of a wide variety of clinical examples, including Alzheimer disease as a test case, I show how nosology, research, and decisions about diagnostic criteria should include normative as well as naturalistically describable factors. Apr 12, 2020 3 nosology, research, and decisions about diagnostic criteria should include normative as well as naturalistically describable factors, even when relying on a naturalist conception of disease.",

The BST has seen its fair share of criticism, with many authors finding the naturalist conception of disease to be untenable. The typology in part serves the purpose of justifying using \"disease\" in this particular way, and therefore implicitly underscores the BST's usefulness. By the BST, biological dysfunction is necessary for a condition to be a disease. Following from the other requirements of the BST (discussed in Boorse, 2014), one way to characterize disease is as the pathophysiological defects constituting a statistical subnormality of physiological function.",

The intersection of these factors creates the typology's eight categories. These categories clarify relationships among clinical conditions (and show how they extend beyond a narrow focus on disease), and provide a framework for understanding diagnostic criteria, how they change, and why they should change, such as depending upon what (if any) symptoms a person exhibits at a given time. Unless otherwise mentioned, by diagnostic criteria I mean current criteria. Typically these involve the presence of symptoms and signs (such as results of laboratory tests, imaging, genetic analysis). However, for many conditions, such as cluster headache, mostly or only symptoms constitute official \"A Typology of Clinical Conditions\"",

            "text": "Clinical medicine is replete with examples of diseases where there is a disparity between the diagnostic criteria used to ascertain the presence of the disease and the pathophysiological dysfunction of the disease. Clinicians also study and treat a number of non-diseases, such as pregnancy, as well as conditions straddling the line between disease and risk for disease (such as the early stages of atherosclerosis). As Christopher Boorse wrote in 1977 (564-565) , \"The distinction between normal variation and underlying disease is one of the most important features of medical theory, though in practice it is often hard to draw because so much clinical evidence is gross output.\" Given that most clinical evidence is indeed gross output (blood glucose levels, for example), whereby laboratory tests at most only offer a proxy for or rough indication of the dysfunction present (e.g., defects in pancreatic beta cells, adipose tissue, the incretin system), ascertaining the presence of disease is not always as straightforward as it may seem. This is especially true for asymptomatic conditions, but also for conditions in which the dysfunction is mild or difficult to discern. Although there are multiple nosologies of disease, there is less discussion in the philosophical or medical literature on the classification of clinical conditions (with some exceptions, such as Kline, 1986; Engelhardt, 1996, ch. 5; Caplan et al., 2004; Schwartz, 2008 Schwartz, , 2014a Doust et al., 2017; and Hofmann, 2016, 2017) . Clinical conditions include conditions that look like diseases but are not; conditions that are diseases but that (currently) have no diagnostic criteria; and other types, including those relating to risk for disease (-blinded for review-, 2020, Figure 1 ). This paper is meant to fill that gap by examining factors important for characterizing clinical conditions, to arrive at a typology of clinical conditions. Through analysis of a wide variety of detailed clinical examples, I show how diagnostic criteria (e.g., those promulgated by medical society guidelines for use in clinical practice). This highlights the fact that for many conditions the existence of pathophysiology is assumed on the basis of the presence of symptoms. Yet recent calls for revisions in Alzheimer disease (AD) and Huntington disease diagnostic criteria advocate inclusion of AD and Huntington disease biomarkers (Jack et al., 2018; Reilmann et al., 2014) . This underscores the notion that there is not always a close correspondence between AD and Huntington disease clinical symptoms and their respective pathophysiological signs. Indeed, pathological changes can be present in the brains of people with AD years before the manifestation of symptoms (Jack et al., 2011, 258) , whereas people with Huntington disease possess the mutant gene from birth and often undergo a long presymptomatic phase (Reilmann et al., 2014) . How these and other conditions are defined (through diagnostic criteria) has profound implications for clinical practice, research, and society (regarding insurance, stigma, and other effects of being labeled with a clinical condition). A chief goal of this paper is to explain how normative considerations determine which typology categories a condition can be in and therefore whether biological dysfunction or symptoms are more important for defining a disease. The usefulness of the typology may lie in both identifying main distinguishing features of clinical conditions but also in using the distinctions to think through the implications of different classifications.",

AKI has multiple etiologies and proper diagnostic tools should distinguish these. As will be discussed below, similar situations exist for other diseases, including chronic ones.

There are many diseases for which the pathology is too difficult to assess, so the diagnostic criteria for the disease consist solely of symptoms or behavioral signs. Meeting diagnostic criteria is how diseases are identified in clinical practice. In some cases this involves specific pathology, as identified through whatever tests are available that could indicate the key dysfunction is present.

As will be discussed for AD, any incredulity this might engender depends on the condition; AD, like depression, is listed in the DSM-5, but unlike depression has biomarkers available that can identify AD's neuropathological signature even in a patient not yet exhibiting dementia.

She thinks that medium or severe hypertension in itself is probably not a dysfunction. Schwartz (2008) considers these levels dysfunctional, in contrast to mild hypertension which he considers to not involve dysfunction. Giroux's (2015, 188) critique is motivated by the divergence between blood pressure as a quantitative variable representing the level of functional efficiency and as a direct measurement of dysfunction of the circulatory system. Because she is correct that blood pressure is not a direct measurement of the dysfunction (i.e., functional efficiency) of the circulatory system (in most cases at least), she cannot find a basis for saying that any degree of hypertension represents dysfunction. Indeed, hypertension, as well as blood glucose levels, could be indications of disease, although they are also potentially pathogenic themselves (such as with glucotoxicity or when blood pressure gets really high, as pointed out by Boorse [2012] ). Nonetheless, it is possible that there is dysfunction not only in medium or severe hypertension but even in mild hypertension.

This is because category C involves asymptomatic people with dysfunction who do not meet diagnostic criteria for a disease. Were AD's diagnostic criteria to include laboratory evidence of AD neuropathology, however, then an asymptomatic person with AD could fall under category C if they were to not meet all the diagnostic criteria.

A similar situation exists for familial AD, because people with such genetic mutations are virtually guaranteed to develop dementia, the symptomatic hallmark of AD (Dubois et al., 2014, 615 ). Yet AD presents an even more intriguing test case for the typology than Huntington disease. This is because most cases of AD are of the sporadic type (Dubois et al., 2016, 298) and not all AD-biomarker-positive people develop cognitive impairment (Jack et al., 2018, 538) . Nonetheless, recently proposed research diagnostic criteria allow for an AD diagnosis based entirely on biomarker findings (Dubois et al., 2016; Jack et al., 2018) . Although these new diagnostic criteria are intended for research, some clinicians around the world do use biomarkers as an aid to diagnosis (Frisoni et al., 2017) .

Taking the elderly as a reference class, the pathophysiological hallmarks of AD, whether at the symptomatic or presymptomatic stage, would only count as theoretical disease if they are not commonly found in the appropriate reference class. For the purposes of this discussion I will assume this to be true, although given the high prevalence of AD pathology in individuals aged greater than 80 years (Jack et al., 2018, 552) with only autopsy providing a definite confirmation. However, the existence of individuals with AD pathology but no AD symptoms, and AD symptoms but no AD pathology (Jack et al., 2018, 538) , called into question this presumption. Although autopsy can confirm an AD diagnosis, this is rarely done now given the availability of in vivo biomarkers previously validated against postmortem AD pathology. Moreover, biomarker-based diagnostic criteria have recently been proposed for AD, enabling diagnosis independent of clinical symptoms, such as in the predementia phases. Brain biopsy is rarely performed to diagnose AD because it has low diagnostic yield-not only because it is too difficult and risky (not least of which from general-anesthesia sequelae) but because it is not sensitive and specific enough (Venneti et al., 2011; Warren et al., 2005) .",

This has resulted in a tension within AD diagnostic criteria (or, alternately put, a lack of consensus in the AD field as to what the diagnostic criteria should be), between symptom/neuropsychological-testing-based criteria and biomarker-based criteria. This tension is borne out in different recommendations for research diagnostic criteria promulgated by AD research groups, such as the research framework of the NIA-AA (Jack et al., 2011 (Jack et al., , 2018 and that of the International Working Group (IWG)/Dubois AD diagnostic criteria (Dubois et al., 2014 (Dubois et al., , 2016 . The latest NIA-AA framework defines AD as a biological entity, solely by its pathophysiology as evidenced by biomarkers, without consideration of symptoms (Jack et al., 2018) . This allows for a biomarker-based diagnosis in asymptomatic people. By contrast, the IWG AD diagnostic criteria require both symptoms and biomarkers (Dubois et al., 2014) . This could entail the existence of asymptomatic-at-risk-for-AD patients or presymptomatic patients, the latter carrying proven AD autosomal dominant mutations, which, because they have virtually complete penetrance, merit the \"pre-\" designation on the justified assumption that all such patients will develop dementia (Dubois et al., 2014, 621) . A 2016 publication (Dubois et al., 2016) allowed for a diagnosis of preclinical AD in the absence of symptoms, aligning the criteria with the NIA-AA's view of AD as a biological, not syndromal, entity.",

Indeed, reconceptualizing AD as solely a biological entity privileges a disease approach instead of an illness approach. It could even result in a worry-type illness state characterized by anxiety over the putative certainty of developing dementia, compounded by the negative societal consequences of being labeled as having AD. In addition to challenging common notions of dementia as understood by lay people, cultural differences in how dementia is perceived around the world (Alladi and Hachinski, 2018) , as well as the unavailability of biomarkers in poorer regions, may make the reconceptualization of AD practical for only a minority of people. The ethically problematic nature and potential harm of asymptomatic or prodromal AD diagnoses include insurance, driving, and employment implications; additional costs for diagnostics and potentially ineffective treatments; needless worry and hypervigilance; and the stigma of being labeled with an AD diagnosis (Le Couteur et al., 2013; Swallow, 2017; Milne et al., 2018; Shermer and Richard, 2018) . Turning people who may or may not have a disease into patients with a chronic illness (Bedson et al., 2004) or patients-in-waiting (Timmermans and Buchbinder, 2010) similarly deserves careful deliberation, whatever the benefits the new research diagnostic criteria may hold. Reconceptualizing AD as various states of risk may help avoid some of these problems, but still can result in a \"diagnosis\" of risk, which can be harmful given that interventions to reduce risk can also cause harm (Accad and Fred, 2010) .",

However, each disease presents its own set of considerations, which militates against cookie-cutter solutions. Although whether a disease involves readily identifiable pathological signs might help, on its own this is insufficient to guide the setting of diagnostic criteria (i.e., deciding what criteria should be used by which a person can be diagnosed as having a specific disease).

Research trials aimed at preventive therapeutics can thus still benefit from this lag between the beginning of pathophysiology and the appearance of symptoms. The existence of risk-based conditions-category B-which in some cases medicalize individual variation, could lead to less diagnosis of disease (if recognized as not involving dysfunction), whereas for category C diseases it could lead to more diagnosis (if diagnostic criteria are changed to allow for laboratory evidence of pathology). Understanding the nature of the categories could provide a conceptual toolkit for nosology and the setting of diagnostic criteria. This can lead to approaches that are directly relevant to patients. For example, patients falling within certain categories could be provided direct indicators of disease rather than treating risk factors for disease. Measuring and using carotid artery total plaque area as a guide to therapy, for instance, has been shown to improve therapy in cardiovascular disease prevention clinics (Spence and Hackam, 2010) . Similarly, measurement of intima-media thickness affected both physician and patient behaviors, leading to better treatment behaviors (Korcarz et al., 2008) . Making visible direct indicators of disease can in a way turn a sign into a symptom (i.e., the feeling engendered by witnessing the sign), with possible effects on an affected patient's motivation now that they can more palpably (or visually) experience a disease they may not yet suffer from. As a classificatory system, the typology has several beneficial features: it is simple, containing only eight categories; exhausts the conditions clinicians encounter; has mutually exclusive categories; is flexible, able to accommodate new conditions and diseases; and is compatible with and can be integrated with other classification systems, such as the International Statistical",

The typology has not been empirically tested for its usefulness.",

Here the typology may be useful by showing how normative considerations determine whether biological dysfunction or symptoms are more important for a condition's diagnostic criteria. Tensions between the relative importance of the typology's factors for a given condition can result in category reassignment, which can have enormous implications for how a condition is diagnosed, reimbursed by insurance, and viewed by patients. This is especially true when clinicians, patients, or researchers hold implicit biases against certain categories with respect to how conditions falling under those categories should be managed as a class. Further work can clarify the degree to which this is true.",

Hopefully this can reduce overdiagnosis or treatment where none is merited and at the same time increase sensitivity to risk for those individuals for whom it is important. This way such individuals' conditions can be considered by medicine with just as much importance as disease in which dysfunction is readily apparent. ",

This is because not only is the presence of symptoms an important feature of clinical conditions but so is their absence. In some cases symptoms point to the presence of disease, or, when absent, indicate the absence of a medical condition or the possibility of My use of \"symptoms\" accords with medical usage, and covers any indication of a clinical condition as perceived by the patient. Symptoms thus represent the subjective features of a patient's clinical condition (in contrast to signs, which are the objective features clinicians observe or measure, such as blood pressure). Symptoms need not be communicated to a clinician to be a symptom and need not represent an underlying disease; thus, dyspnea is still a symptom if not observed by a pulmonologist, and does not necessarily indicate or reflect a lung disease, especially if experienced after strenuous exercise. Stiffness on awakening could be a symptom of arthritis, or a consequence of a bad bed. Hunger and unwanted feelings could be symptoms, even though they generally are not: patients do not typically complain of hunger, although when they do a clinician might inquire if the hunger is ravenous, in which case it could indicate a clinical condition (e.g., bulimia). But it would be the odd parent who takes a child complaining of hunger to the doctor instead of giving them food. What makes a feeling a medically important symptom is a question of judgment, and in many cases a judgment informed by medical knowledge and clinical experience.Clinicians and patients decide whether a \"symptom\" is medically relevant, and sometimes their views diverge. For example, a psychiatrist could view a person's feeling of guilt over a minor infraction as being excessive and indicative of a disorder, although the person could feel it to be normal; similarly, a patient could view their fatigue as excessive and indicative of disease even if landing in the normal range on exercise testing. Failure to be brilliant and lack of optimal happiness or flourishing are not symptoms on my usage because they are signs. A feeling of failing to be brilliant or not being optimally happy could be a symptom, however, but typically is not. One reason clinicians mostly do not recognize any unwanted feeling as a medically relevant symptom is because in most cases an unwanted feeling is not indicative of disease. It could simply represent normal variation or a reaction to a life event or circumstance and not reflect the presence of an underlying biological dysfunction or disease process.

A multitude of factors thus influences the decision to treat, which partly rests on the distinction between (potential) harm to self and (potential) harm to others. Similarly, there are other categories of clinical conditions, such as category F, where disease is not present yet normative considerations still play an important role. For example,",

Preclinical disease is another.Another clinical condition for which risk for another disease or more severe disease plays a strong part involves mild, preclinical disease states for which diagnostic criteria for the disease are not met (in contrast with risk-based conditions where diagnostic criteria are met but there is no dysfunction). These other clinical conditions are categories C and G. Dysfunction is present, but not enough to cause symptoms. Thus, \"preclinical\" is a misnomer if it is meant to mean failure to meet diagnostic criteria and not simply the absence of symptoms, because by virtue of the presence of certain signs (such as biochemical signatures of the disease) some diagnostic criteria can be met (i.e., those based on signs), just not any symptom-based criteria.Because preclinical disease creates something of a penumbral state, diagnostic criteria for some diseases explicitly incorporate symptom-based criteria, without which the person does not have the disease. However, doing so is not always advisable depending on the disease. In myasthenia gravis, for example, symptoms are helpful in reaching a diagnosis. In fact, a myasthenia gravis specialist, because of cost and other issues, may almost never encounter a patient tested for antibodies prior to entering the clinic with suspected myasthenia gravis (Prof. Dr. Joseph a suspected case of myasthenia gravis even without antibody testing, solely on the basis of",
