Some lower respiratory infections caused by influenza C, such as bronchitis or pneumonia, have also been reported [Moriuchi et al., 1991; Calvo et al., 2006] . Serological findings indicate that the influenza C virus is distributed widely throughout the world, and that most people acquire antibodies to the virus early in life [Dykes et al., 1980; Homma et al., 1982; Manuguerra et al., 1992] . There are few studies concerning influenza C virus infection in Europe, both because few laborato-ries provide specific diagnoses of influenza C infection and because its epidemiological patterns and clinical impact are understood poorly [Hirsila et al., 2001; Coiras et al., 2003; Calvo et al., 2006] .",

Genetic studies of the RNA of various influenza C virus isolates suggested that strains belonging to different lineages were co-circulating, and that a reassortant presenting an increased ability to spread in humans viruses might exist and be responsible for outbreaks [Matsuzaki et al., 1994 [Matsuzaki et al., , 2003 .",

The RT-PCR amplification was performed using the OneStep RT-PCR kit (QIAgen) using primers that target specifically the influenza C virus HE gene ( Table I ). The amplification products of the influenza C virus HE gene were 485-bp length, and were visualized under UV light after electrophoresis on an ethidium bromide-stained 2% agarose gel.",

Briefly, viral RNA was extracted from the influenza C virus-infected respiratory specimens using the QIAamp Viral RNA Minikit (QIAgen, Courta-boeut, France). The viral RNA was then amplified in two RT-PCR reactions using the OneStep RT-PCR kit (QIAgen). These reactions were performed in a 25 ml final reaction volume containing 2.5 ml RNA extract, 5 ml of OneStep RT-PCR Buffer, 1 ml of 10 mmol/L deoxynucleoside triphosphate (dNTPs), 1 ml OneStep RT-PCR Enzyme Mix, and 1.2 ml of 10 mmol/L reverse and forward primers. The reaction was carried out in a GeneAmp PCR system 2700 thermal cycler (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) with an initial reverse transcription step at 508C for 30 min, followed by 40 cycles of amplification (30 sec at 958C, 30 sec at 538C, 1 min at 728C) and a final extension step at 728C for 10 min. Each RT-PCR test included water controls that were treated identically to the specimens throughout; reactions were performed with care to avoid cross-contamination. The resulting PCR products were purified using ExoSAP-IT (USB Corporation, Cleveland, OH) and sequenced using the ET Dye Terminator Sequencing kit on a MegaBACE 1000 automatic sequencer (GE HealthCare, Buckinghamshire, UK). The region from nucleotide 64 to 1,792 was analyzed. BioEdit software (Tom Hall, Ibis Biosciences, Carlsbad, CA) was used for nucleotide sequence alignments. The sequences of the 10 influenza C virus HE genes were analyzed along with 18 sequences that were published previously [Buonagurio et al., 1985; Matsuzaki et al., 1994 Matsuzaki et al., , 2000 Matsuzaki et al., , 2002 Matsuzaki et al., , 2003 Matsuzaki et al., , 2007 Muraki et al., 1996 Muraki et al., , 2004 .

Phylogenetic tree of influenza C viruses based on a 1,729-bp region of the HE gene. Viruses isolated in the present study (Caen, France) are marked with asterisks. The other sequences have been described elsewhere [Buonagurio et al., 1985; Matsuzaki et al., 1994 Matsuzaki et al., , 2000 Matsuzaki et al., , 2002 Matsuzaki et al., , 2003 Matsuzaki et al., , 2007 Muraki et al., 1996 Muraki et al., , 2004 ]. The numbers above the branches are the bootstrap values of each branch (%). Nishimura et al., 1987] . Despite its extensive circulation, influenza C virus infection in the population is rarely documented. This is likely due both to its mild viral pathogenicity and to the difficulty in detecting it. The first seroepidemiological study carried out in France indicated that 61-70% of the tested population had been exposed to the virus [Manuguerra et al., 1992] . RT-PCR for the detection of influenza C virus has been described elsewhere [Claas et al., 1992; Hirsila et al., 2001] . Recently, the multiplex RT-PCR assay has been used to detect several respiratory viruses simultaneously [Eugene-Ruellan et al., 1998; Coiras et al., 2003; Templeton et al., 2004; Bellau-Pujol et al., 2005] . In this study, multiplex RT-PCR assay was combined with a technique that isolates influenza C virus in infected HuH7 cell supernatant . During a 30-month survey, 18 influenza C virus isolates were found in 2,281 IFA-negative respiratory samples. These isolates were detected in both hospitalized and non-hospitalized patients, principally in young infants but also in some adults. The isolation rate of influenza C virus in acute respiratory infections in this study was very low (0.79%), in agreement with other reports [Moriuchi et al., 1991; Calvo et al., 2006; Matsuzaki et al., 2006 ]. Most of the influenza C virus infections were detected during the winter, similar to outbreaks of influenza A or B viruses; however, we also confirmed the existence of summer infections, as reported previously by others [Katagiri et al., 1983; Moriuchi et al., 1991; Greenbaum et al., 1998; Matsuzaki et al., 2002] .",

Digestive problems were noted in approximately one third of the patients in this study.

Genetic analysis of the HE gene of the 10 influenza C virus strains sequenced in this study revealed that viruses belonging to two of these groups were co-circulating in Normandy from 2004 to 2007: the C/Yamagata/26/81-virus group in 2004, and the C/Sao Paulo/378/82-virus group from 2005 to 2007. The presence of a dominant genetic group in a community for several years, and its replacement by another dominant group, was reported previously in Japan [Matsuzaki et al., 2003] . It would be interesting to analyze retrospectively respiratory samples from an earlier period in Normandy in order to define their lineages, and also to study whether influenza C viruses with similar genetic composition spread in other areas of France during the same time.",
