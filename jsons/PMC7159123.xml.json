            "text": "We know that the distribution patterns of species are shaped by various factors that might differ across scales (e.g. Pearson & Dawson, 2003). In addition, with varying principal scale entities (grain, extent, and focus) the results of studies will differ (see Gurevitch et al., 2002). In studies of macroecological processes, extent and focus are the most important components (Blackburn & Gaston, 2002). Species relationships are features that can be compared in samples across different scales. When the objective of a study moves from the analysis of single\u2010species patterns to the analysis of species assemblages across scales, a further difficulty is data inconsistency. In most cases, the available data sets at the different scales will differ in species composition. This is mainly because at broader scales more species are involved than at finer scales, but also because the effort of data sampling at smaller scales often forces the researcher to focus on a restricted number of species. One way to overcome this difficulty is to use the smallest subset of species for which information is consistent across all scales. However, this type of data\u2010set truncation has the disadvantage that changing species relationships with scale are ignored. For example, if at the finest scale only woodland species have been sampled and the data set is restricted to this set, no change of species co\u2010occurrences between forest and grassland species will be detectable. We have employed both the approach of a fixed subset of species and the use of species groups of variable species composition across scales.",

In general, species of the same species group share similar ecological and spatial requirements at a given scale. Species groups that emerge at different scales (here termed spatially stable species groups) might be particularly useful for scaling data. The spatially stable species groups that display the same pattern at different scales are likely to depend on the same environmental factors at each scale, including climate, topography, land use, soil conditions, and biotic interactions. If the co\u2010occurrence of species is incidental at a particular scale (e.g. one species might depend on particular chemical soil conditions while another might depend on a favourable microclimate), this co\u2010occurrence will disappear at a different scale, as environmental factors do not co\u2010vary consistently across scales (Pearson & Dawson, 2003). Conversely, all species of a spatially stable species group can be expected to depend on the same principal environmental factor at a particular scale. In other words, the relative importance of environmental factors at a particular scale should be similar for all species in a spatially stable species group. In contrast, the different species composition of a species group at a different scale should reflect differences in the relative importance of environmental variables between these scales, resulting in different scale\u2010domains (see Wiens, 1989).",

            "text": "There are many data sets in which information on the occurrence of plant species or vegetation samples are stored digitally. Floristic data sets have the advantage that they rely on systematic sampling with a defined extent and grain. They are available mainly at coarse scales and have only rarely been produced at finer scales (e.g. Scheller, 1989), however, and they are increasingly less complete at broader scales (e.g. 20% completeness of the Atlas Florae Europaeae mapping, see Kurtto et al., 2004). There is a need for methods that can provide estimates of the completeness of floristic surveys, for example for detecting overlooked species or for reducing sampling effort. Such methods might use information on species relationships from a different source, that is, from vegetation data. At present, around one million vegetation records exist (Ewald, 2001). These data have the disadvantage that they were collected using different sampling designs and for different purposes (e.g. Mucina et al., 2001). Their main purpose is to describe vegetation at the regional scale, for example for assessing conservation status, risk assessment, or preparation of vegetation maps. Another goal is to produce a broad\u2010scale classification from vegetation plots (relev\u00e9s) of different regions, i.e. to follow a bottom\u2010up approach. It is the aim of the International Association of Vegetation Science (IAVS), Ecoinformatics Working Group, which was formed in 2003, to facilitate access to these large vegetation data sets (http://www.bio.unc.edu/faculty/peet/vegdata/). In addition, the on\u2010going project SYNBIOSYS deals with the integration of differently scaled data sets at the species, vegetation and landscape level scattered throughout Europe (Schamin\u00e9e & Hennekens, 2001).",

The \u03a6\u2010coefficient of association describes the correlation between two categorial factors in a 2 by 2 contingency table (Sokal & Rohlf, 1995). A positive value of \u03a6 means that there is a positive correlation between a species and an existing species group. Based on preliminary runs we chose an arbitrary threshold value of \u03a6 = 0.5 for including new species into a group. The value of this threshold determines the size of the species group, and the lower the threshold, the more species are included in a group. A value of \u03a6 = 0.5 was low enough to yield groups of more than two species but high enough to prevent species groups from becoming too large and, thus, from becoming too environmentally unspecific. However, a choice of \u03a6 = 0.4 or 0.6 resulted in the same overall pattern.",

Only the species groups that had at least three plots assigned to them in a data set were used for further analysis. The final number of species groups reflected the main environmental gradients both in the study area and in the set of the relev\u00e9s included in the FD. In a few cases, we obtained several species groups with slightly different species composition but with essentially the same plots assigned to them. To avoid this problem a new species group was recognized as different from another one if it had at most one or two species in common. No species group typical of water habitats was formed, as these habitats are very rare and did not provide enough diagnostic species in the data sets. The final results of the COCKTAIL species group method were clear assignment criteria of how many species of a certain species group, plot, or grid cell must be present to be allocated to this group.

In our study, this is the case with coniferous forest plantations, which cover nearly half of the study area, and with degraded meadows either transformed from desiccated wetlands or from abandoned fields. However, the inclusion of additional species\u2010poor relev\u00e9s from these habitats would not significantly influence the criterion of species groups as this method is not sensitive to dataset enlargement by relev\u00e9s that contain species that are otherwise absent or rare in the data set (Bruelheide & Chytr\u00fd, 2000).",

Thus, 46% of all relev\u00e9s in the FD are included in only 17% of all grid cells in the BD. Nevertheless, these cores are distributed relatively regularly throughout the region and they also cover all main vegetation types (see Materials and methods). The bias mentioned might have influenced the species composition of the two most frequent groups (the VaccMyrt and PlanLanc groups), as these were formed by ubiquitous species occurring either in forests or on open\u2010land. In most groups, the frequency of relev\u00e9s assigned to species group in the FD tends to agree with what is observed in the field and corresponds to frequencies that we would expect to be encountered in a stratified sampling design.",

Under the assumption of a random occurrence of species and a given relative frequency of species in the data set, the number of co\u2010occurrences will increase with the number of species. Therefore, larger species groups are expected to be formed in data sets with a higher total species number (the BD and FD in this study). In total, 65 species (45%) chosen as diagnostic in the species groups are not present in the MD. However, this is a problem mainly in the PlanLanc group (over 90% of its species are not present in the MD) and in the VaccMyrt group (all species are absent in the MD). For this reason it is not possible to form these groups in the MD. On the other hand, there are nine other groups in which all species (e.g. the ArunDioi group) or almost all species (e.g. the CallVulg group) are present in all three data sets. In addition, a different size of a species group does not necessarily result in a different selection of plots in which the species groups are present, as our assignment criteria involve a minimum number of species that depends on the total species number of the species group (Bruelheide & Jandt, 1995; Bruelheide, 2000). Without this feature (i.e. with a fixed minimum number of species), the correspondence of plot assignment would have been much lower between data sets (i.e. between scales). Even with similar numbers of species, the species groups vary in species composition. On the one hand, this is a result of the bias in data sets mentioned above; on the other hand, this difference is inevitable even in balanced data sets, as relative frequency of species varies with scale (Kunin, 1998). It is an advantage of the COCKTAIL method that different species compositions of groups can be handled by the optimization procedure.",

However, the intra\u2010dataset variation in grain in the FD (\u00b1 200 m2) is negligible compared with the 650\u2010times greater grain used in the MD and the 2500\u2010times greater grain in the BD.",

Ecologically specialized groups such as the ArunDioi group, the EpipMicr group, the GaleLute group and the CareDava group are less scale\u2010dependent (i.e. spatially stable) than groups with wide ecological amplitudes. The ecologically specialized group contains mostly species occurring in specialized (extra\u2010zonal) habitats in the study area (such as wet meadows, calcareous beech forests on rendzinas, ravine forests; see Table 1). Such species are also characterized by more extreme indicator values according to Ellenberg et al. (2001). Specialized species occur in the same habitats at the fine scale, and as these habitats are rare also at the broader scale, the species tend to co\u2010occur at all scales. This explains why the species groups of extra\u2010zonal habitats are spatially stable compared with those of common habitats, such as fringe vegetation, ruderal habitats, and mesophilous meadows. In contrast, species with wide ecological amplitudes (e.g. the PlanLanc group) can form well\u2010defined species groups at broad scales by co\u2010occurring in the same grid cells, as it is probable that at least one of a larger number of habitats occurs in this grid cell, but can co\u2010occur at fine scales (i.e. in relev\u00e9s) only to a limited degree, as a certain area in one habitat can only contain a limited species number as a result of dispersal limitation and local exclusion mechanisms (Gause, 1934). Ku\u017eelov\u00e1 & Chytr\u00fd (2004) stated that the transferability of species groups formed at a regional scale is best in those areas with high habitat heterogeneity, which is congruent with our observation of better transferability of specialized groups. They also found better transferability of species groups that had a central position along the major environmental gradients existing at the regional scale. However, this is not the case in our study. For example, the PlanLanc group has low transferability although it occupies a central ecological position in our study. In contrast, Ku\u017eelov\u00e1 & Chytr\u00fd\u2019s (2004) result seems to apply to the GaleLute group, with a central position in forests in our study area.",

In addition, often only selected species are analysed in such studies (Pedersen, 1990; Myklestad & Birks, 1993; Myklestad, 1993).

If spatially stable species groups have been identified in areas with completed floristic or vegetation surveys, these groups can be used to complement corresponding vegetation or floristic data sets. Another application might be temporal prediction, which has not yet been tested. As vegetation surveys are repeated with less expenditure of time and money (e.g. monitoring in the Natura 2000 network) than complete floristic mappings, bottom\u2010up predictions would be valuable. As Wilson et al. (2004) stated that biodiversity change (decline or increase rate) can be revealed from current species distribution data alone using spatial patterns of occupancy in combination with the size of the occupied area, spatially stable groups from vegetation data sets might be monitored for changes in time and then applied across various scales. Thus, we may detect a declining species group at the regional or national scale by using monitoring results from local scales.

Then, various scales would have to be compared, as it has been shown that rates of decline are scale\u2010dependent (Hartley & Kunin, 2003).",

            "text": "The next step will be to repeat our approach in other areas. The most suitable areas will be those in which both floristic and vegetation surveys have already been undertaken, and preferably those with high biodiversity with a high number of different species groups. An example at the regional scale is the K\u0159ivokl\u00e1tsko Biosphere Reserve (Czech Republic), where a floristic mapping in 1/100 CEBA grids and vegetation survey with more than 4000 relev\u00e9s have already been performed (see Kolbek et al., 1999). Similarly, in Mecklenburg\u2010Western Pomerania (northern Germany), vegetation and a floristic data bases have been produced at the level of a federal state (Berg et al., 2004). Unfortunately, this case is the exception rather than the rule in central Europe. At the national level there are many floristic distribution atlases using different resolutions (e.g. Universal Transverse Mercator UTM 10 \u00d7 10 km grid in Preston et al., 2002; Distribution Atlas of Vascular Plants in Poland ATPOL 10 \u00d7 10 km grid in Zaj\u0105c & Zaj\u0105c, 2001; CEBA 10\u2032 E \u00d7 6\u2032 N grid c. 133 km2 in Haeupler & Sch\u00f6nfelder, 1989). At this national scale, digital vegetation data bases are still lacking but are under preparation. If we apply the method at a continental scale, other available floristic data sets could be used (Meusel et al., 1965\u201392; Jalas & Suominen, 1972\u201394; 1996, 1999; Kurtto et al., 2004), even reaching the worldwide level (e.g. project WORLDMAP; Gaston, 2003). The final aim would be to use vegetation or floristic data sets from all available scales to make predictions of species distribution at the global scale, but this goal is still far out of reach.",
