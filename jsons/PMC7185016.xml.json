These are relatively old agents, introduced primarily for prophylaxis and treatment of malaria and also for rheumatic diseases [13]. In vitro cell cultures, HCQ seems to be a more potent inhibitor of infection with SARS-CoV-2 than chloroquine [14], [15]. Both drugs, taken orally, may cause severe side effects [16] ranging from psychiatric symptoms [17] to ocular toxicity [18] to myocardial dysfunction [19], even at only low overdosage [20]. These side effects may be severe and, therefore, limit widespread application in vivo, at least at the present time. As Drosten [21] pointed out, a major limiting factor of oral hydrochloroquine treatment lies in the fact that the drug may not reach the target, i.e. the surface of the lungs. Instead, it is metabolized internally, requiring treatment dosages which, in turn, may cause toxic and sometimes even lethal side effects.",

However, the typical clinical course of this infection suggests that the virus load in the respiratory tract increases stepwise starting with mild symptoms and ending in up to 15 % of patients with severe and potentially life-threatening pneumonia [4]. Therefore, the treatment with a drug which inactivates the cell receptor for the virus should start after exposition with high risk, e.g., when one person was infected very recently with the virus or is in the early phase of the disease. Moreover, our hypothesis differs from the standard recommendation to try HCQ/CQ in a late phase of the disease when other antiviral drugs failed. We believe that a respiratory virus infection should be treated very early because the severe acute respiratory syndrome is caused by ion channel activity of the viroporin 3a which activates the NLRP3 inflammasome [22]. Unfortunately, as of now, there is no evidence yet that HCQ/CQ has any inhibiting effect on this inflammasome activation.",

Such high dosages may have several toxic side effects, strongly limiting their utilizability as preventive treatment. An aerosol application of drugs which are primarily intended to act on the respiratory system is well established for several drugs, e.g. in the treatment of asthma with corticosteroids, e.g. budesonide [23], [24] and beta mimetica, e.g. fenoterol [25], and in the early treatment of influenza (during the first 48 hours) with neuraminidase blockers like zanamivir [26]. Moreover, there are reports of undergoing clinical studies of aerosol interferon alpha (novaferon) for treatment of COVID-19 [27] leading us to advocate a clinical trial to evaluate also HCQ/CQ in this application form.",

Other possible explanations for the antiviral effect include a reduction in MAK kinase activation or a disruption of the maturation of the viral M protein.
