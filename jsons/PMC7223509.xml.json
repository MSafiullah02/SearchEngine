            "text": "Enterobacteriaceae are among the most frequent cause of bacterial infections in patients of all ages in both community and inpatient settings [1]. The remarkable ability of these organisms to acquire a growing array of mechanisms to evade the activity of broad-spectrum antibiotics therefore presents a growing challenge. In particular, the emergence and spread of carbapenem-hydrolyzing beta-lactamases (carbapenemases) limits our ability to treat many life-threatening infections [2]. Due to the well-rehearsed challenges of conducting randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in patients with carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) infections, current management strategies are largely informed by observational data and expert opinion [3]. Observational studies can provide valuable insight into the real-world effectiveness of treatment alternatives in circumstances where execution of RCTs is not feasible. However, because treatment is not randomly assigned, confounding by indication may lead to a biased estimate of the treatment effect. Covariate adjustment is especially important in CRE studies due to the wide spectrum of disease severity and underlying health status of the patients who acquire these infections, which clearly influences both the management approach and outcomes. Risk scores are useful for covariate adjustment in these circumstances, and they can also facilitate comparisons of populations across different studies. Furthermore, some risk scores have been used clinically to define high-risk subgroups for whom more intensive management strategies may be targeted [4, 5]. A number of risk scores have recently been developed and/or validated specifically in patients with CRE infections [4, 6, 7]. The INCREMENT-CPE score (ICS) was developed to predict 14-day mortality in patients with carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (CPE) bacteremia [4]. It was subsequently modified and validated for 30-day mortality in patients with bacteremic and non-bacteremic CPE infections [6]. The Pitt bacteremia score (PBS) and an abbreviated version of the PBS, the qPitt, were also recently validated in a large cohort of patients with bacteremic and non-bacteremic CRE infections [7]. Notably, these analyses included no [4, 6] or few [7] patients treated with newer antibiotics with activity against CRE. Their performance in the era of more effective and safer antibiotics [8, 9] is unclear. Therefore, the objective of this study was to evaluate the predictive performance of the ICS, PBS, and qPitt for mortality among patients with CRE infections treated with ceftazidime\u2013avibactam.",

Data were collected for up to 30 days after discharge (i.e., from health system outpatient clinics, rehabilitation centers, emergency departments, and hospital re-admissions, where available), and patients discharged before day 30 were assumed to have survived if death was not documented during this follow-up. The ICS, PBS, and qPitt were calculated for each patient using the worst physiological values recorded within 24 h of infection onset. The variables included in the ICS were severe sepsis/septic shock [12], PBS \u2265 6, Charlson comorbidity score \u2265 2, and non-biliary or non-urinary tract source of infection [6]. Scores range from 0 to 15 and patients with an ICS < 8 and \u2265 8 have been considered to be at low and high risk for mortality, respectively [4, 6]. The PBS is based on five variables: temperature, blood pressure, mechanical ventilation, cardiac arrest, and mental status [13]. The maximum PBS score is 14, with scores \u2265 4 generally considered to indicate increased risk of death [7, 13]. qPitt includes the same five variables as the PBS, but temperature and mental status are dichotomized rather than graded [14]. The qPitt ranges from 0 to 5, with scores \u2265 2 indicating increased mortality risk in previous studies [7, 14]. No patient in our cohort experienced cardiac arrest around infection onset, and therefore this variable was not included in the scores.",

It is notable, however, that Henderson et al. found the performance of the PBS and qPitt to be similar when analyses were restricted to the subgroup of patients with non-bacteremic CRE infections [7]. Furthermore, an important property of the most useful scoring systems is that they perform similarly across different target populations. Second, patients who died within 72 h of infection onset were excluded from our study (patients had to receive \u2265 72 h of ceftazidime\u2013avibactam), and variables such as severe sepsis/septic shock may best predict very early versus later deaths. However, observational studies evaluating antibiotic alternatives typically have inclusion criteria based on receipt of \u2265 48\u201372 h of the antibiotics of interest [9, 22, 23]. Prediction scores that discriminate for later deaths may be more suited for adjustment in these studies. The ICS was developed and validated specifically in patients with CPE infections. We did not confirm carbapenemase production, and a proportion of patients were likely infected with non-carbapenemase-producing CRE which have been shown to confer a lower risk of poor outcomes compared to CPE [24]. However, as was the case in our study, these data are not always available for observational analyses.",

            "text": "As noted previously, the validation studies for the ICS, PBS, and qPitt were conducted largely in the era before the introduction of newer antibiotics with activity against CRE [6, 7]. Two recent observational studies found improved survival in patients with CRE infection treated with ceftazidime\u2013avibactam compared to historical controls treated with colistin-, aminoglycoside-, and carbapenem-based regimens [8, 9]. It is plausible that the use of ceftazidime\u2013avibactam in all patients in our cohort may have partly contributed to the observed differences in score performance. However, it is important to remember that other changes have occurred in recent years that may have influenced the relationship between baseline variables and outcomes. Rapid genomic and phenotypic methods are now available to accelerate the identification of CRE [25]. A great deal of progress has also been made with regard to our understanding of key aspects of the complex pharmacokinetics of polymyxins enabling the design of dosing regimens more likely to achieve therapeutic concentrations [26]. Ten percent of patients in this study received a polymyxin with ceftazidime\u2013avibactam. Furthermore, at most institutions, the use of new antibiotics must be approved by the antimicrobial stewardship team or infectious diseases consult service. All patients in our study were managed by the infectious diseases consult service. The value of specialist involvement in the management of multidrug-resistant infections is well established [27\u201331].",

None of the scores incorporate key treatment-related factors that could influence outcomes. We observed that mortality was significantly higher in patients who had their ceftazidime\u2013avibactam dose renally adjusted. The association was no longer significant after adjustment based on the scores, raising the possibility that need for dose adjustment may be a surrogate for other prognostic variables. Renal impairment and the need for renal replacement therapy have been identified by other investigators as risk factors for poor outcomes in patients treated with ceftazidime\u2013avibactam [32\u201334] Antibiotic blood and tissue concentrations as well as minimum inhibitory concentrations may impact patient response, and inclusion in prognostic modeling could improve predictive performance at the expense of model simplicity. Conversely, it may be worthwhile to revisit and revise protocols pertaining to ceftazidime\u2013avibactam renal dose adjustment criteria [35].",

However, in-depth EMR reviews allowed us to obtain detailed patient level data that may not be available in validation studies that obtain data from large healthcare administrative databases. Second, although our data spanned 4 years and we enrolled patients from six medical centers, the number of patients included was relatively small owing to the infrequency of CRE infections and slow incorporation of new antibiotics into clinical practice. Our event rate was also low, which may partly explain the variable performance of the models. We calculated the scores using the worst physiological measurements within 24 h of culture collection as a proxy for infection onset. However, for patients with community-onset infections as well as those with chronic relapsing infections, the time-frame used may not have reflected the true infection onset. We included only patients treated with ceftazidime\u2013avibactam. Evaluations of scoring system performance in patients treated with other novel agents would be valuable.",

With respect to clinical use, the ICS, PBS, and qPitt all have the advantages of being based on readily available variables and being simple to calculate compared to the more time-intensive APACHE II or SOFA scores. However, none performed well enough in our cohort to be used for clinical decision-making in individual patients. Updating the scores to more accurately predict outcomes in the era of novel antibiotics, rapid diagnostics, and infectious diseases specialist involvement would be worthwhile, not only to improve their utility as tools in observational research but also so that clinicians can use them as supplementary information when making appropriate decisions about the management of patients with CRE infections.",
