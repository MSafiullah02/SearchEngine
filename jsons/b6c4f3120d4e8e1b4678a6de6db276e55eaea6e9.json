Indeed, there are those who do not see a causal role for viruses at all, and regard MS as being an autoimmune disease, with antibodies and sensitized T-cells raised against a component of the myelin sheath, for example, myelin basic protein (MBP) or a component of its supporting cells, the oligodendrocytes (Waksman, 1985) .",

However, a low association between infection and clinical manifestation of neurological disease is common after virus infections, for example, subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) and measles or rubella, and encephalitis following infection with mumps or other common viruses such as, varicella, herpes, or EB virus. Furthermore, other well recognized causal agents induce disease in only a small percentage of cases, e.g. Coxackie B3 and polymyositis, Epstein-Barr virus and Burkitt's lymphoma. Of the large number of insect-borne encephalitides, only a small percentage of those infected get any symptoms of neurological involvement, although headache and abnormal CSFs without clinical neurological signs is likely to be more frequent (Varma & Webb, 1985) .",

There are two main pieces of evidence. Firstly the well known association with latitude. Not only do people living between latitudes 45\" and 65\" develop MS more frequently than people in more tropical climes but this risk appears to be acquired before the age of 15 years. People who emigrate from a low to a high risk area or vice versa after the age of 15 years take with them the risk of developing MS associated with the country where they spent their childhood (Kurtzke, 1980; Dean & Kurtzke, 1971; Alter, Kahana & Loewenson, 1978) . This data suggests that the disease develops a long time after the 'risk' is acquired. The mean age of infection has been given as 10 years and that of disease onset as 30 years (Kurtzke, 1980; Alter et al., 1978) .",

The Islands were occupied by British troops between 1940 and 1945 and it can be argued that they introduced the putative MS agent into a susceptible community, i.e. a point source epidemic.

            "text": "Several well described and studied animal models of MS associated with viruses exist. Neurological diseases pro-duced by viruses in animals include meningitis, encephalitis, spongiform encephalopathies and peripheral neuropathy. Some of these are associated with lesions of demyelination. Animal models of virally induced neurological disease such as Theiler's virus , Semliki Forest Virus (SFV) (Webb et al., 1979) , mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) (Beushawson & Dales, 1985) and lactic dehydrogenase virus (LDV) of mice (Pease & Murphy, 1980) demonstrate markedly different pathologies. Each of the above models results in CNS inflammation and demyelination and each of these models has various other different features in addition to demyelination which resemble those of MS. In all cases the strain of virus, and the status of the mice used (age, strain) are important. In addition to a role for an infectious agent in MS there seems to be a genetically determined susceptibility to the disease. For example, encephalitis and demyelination following infection of mice with MHV has been shown to be dependent upon the genetic type of the mouse (Stohlman & Frelinger, 1978) . The strain specificity for LDV has been shown to correlate with the presence of endogenous retroviruses (Pease & Murphy, 1980) . If MS is considered to have an immunopathology in which demyelination results directly from the immune response, then this is paralleled by both Theiler's (Lipton & Dal Canto, 1975) virus and SFV (Fazakerley, Amor & Webb, 1983) . Certain strains of MHV destroy oligodendrocytes directly leading to demyelination (Weiner, 1973) and a similar direct viral destruction of these myelin supporting cells cannot yet be ruled out in MS. Lymphocyte reactivity to MBP has been demonstrated in both MS patients and rats infected with mouse hepatitis virus (Sheremata, Cosgrove 8z Eylar, 1975; Watanabe, Wege & ter Meulen, 1983) . Antibodies and T-cell reactivity to glycolipids have been demonstrated in MS patients (Arnon et al., 1980; Offner, Konat & Sela, 1981) and polyclonal antiglycolipid sera and monoclonal antibodies raised to a glycolipid component of myelin have been shown to cross-react with Semliki Forest virus (Khalili-Shirazi, Gregson & Webb, 1986) as have anti-galactocerebroside, glucocerebroside and ganglioside sera (Webb et al., 1984) . By immunoelectronmicroscopy using protein A gold these same sera also labelled virus budding from CNS cell membranes (Evans & Webb, 1986) . Given the epidemiological evidence, any virus involved in MS would be likely to be able to persist for long periods in nervous tissue, and each of the above experimental virus infections have also been shown to persist in the brain for long periods (Verelizier, Verelizier & Allison, 1975; Brahic & Stroop, 1981; Atkinson et al., 1986; Rowson & Mahy, 1975) . The clinical course of MS is often one of relapse and remittance and this can also be produced in mice infected with Theiler's virus (Lipton & Dal Canto, 1979) .",

Lentiviruses are non-transforming retroviruses which produce demyelinating diseases in sheep and goats. The incubation time is very long, hence lenti (slow) -viruses, and the persistence of the virus in the host is thought to be due to its ability to infect and 'lie low' in macrophages (Peluso et al., 1985) . These viruses are of particular interest as they have been shown to be similar to HTLV-III/LAV (HIV), the causal agent of the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) in both structure and function (Soningo et al., 1985) . The recent recognition that HTLV-111 is clinically neurotropic and that many cells in the brain have been shown by in-situ hybridization to harbour the virus (Shaw et d., 1985) makes the possibility that a similar agent could be involved in MS attractive.",

Visna virus causes lung tumours (maedi) in some sheep and a demyelinating encephalomyelitis (visna) in others, or sometimes both together. Another retrovirus, the feline leukaemia virus (FeLV) causes leukaemia/sarcoma in some cats, and acquired immunodeficiency in others and neurological involvement has been reported in others, although the causal relationship to neurological disease has not in this case been indisputably proved (Hardy et al., 1985) . Infection of mice with LDV and endogenous C-type viruses is associated with the development of leukaemia (Pease & Murphy, 1980) . The viral association between leukaemic and neurological disease is not confined to the retroviruses. Epstein-Barr virus can produce encephalitis, or peripheral neuritis in some, lymphoma in others (Grose et al., 1975) . In Marek's disease of birds, another herpes virus, produces both neuritis and lymphoma (Payne, Frazier & Powel, 1976) . Progressive multifocal leucoencephalopathy (PML) is associated most commonly with lymphoma, but also with other carcinomas (Johnson, 1982) and the virus producing PML (JC virus) produces gliomas in young Syrian hamsters (Walker et al., 1973) . Hodgkin's lymphoma and MS in the same patient are not commonly recognized, however, both have a socioeconomic association with higher social class, and family clusters of MS and HD have been recognized to occur in different generations (Cartwright, Leeds Lymphoma Registry, personal communication). HTLV-I is accepted as the causal agent of adult T-cell leukaemia-lymphoma (ATLL) which is en-demic in Japan and the Caribbean and which is being increasingly recognized in the United Kingdom (Greaves et al., 1984) . Although causal, only about 1% of infected persons develop disease and this may take 10-30 years to manifest. HTLV-I has already been associated with neurological disease. Tropical spastic paresis and tropical axial neuropathy have both been reported as having a strong association with HTLV-I in the absence of HTLV-I leukaemic disease (Gessain et al., 1985) . Furthermore, HTLV-I associated myelopathy found in areas of Japan where HTLV-I leukaemias are prevalent, is a disease clinically distinguishable from MS only by its non-remitting nature (Osame et al., 1986) . There is, therefore, considerable evidence to suggest that the same agent can cause leukaemic syndromes in some people and neurological disease in others.",

Activation is usually recognized by an increased expression of the 'Tac' or interleukin-2 (IL-2) receptor and increased expression of major histocompatibility (MHC) class I1 human leukocyte antigen (HLA). It is interesting to note that HTLV-I also 'activates' Tcells, and that recently it has been shown that HTLV-I can turn on not only the IL-2 gene but also the gene for its receptor (Greene et al., 1986) . More recently Greene and his colleagues have demonstrated that HTLV-I can transactivate or 'turn on' class I1 major histocompatibility antigens (MHC or Ia), (Greene, personal communication). Furthermore, lentiviruses e.g. Visna, are very similar to HIV, also infect cells of the monocytemacrophage lineage persistently, and induce expression of class I1 antigens, although this is probably due to virus induced interferon (Kennedy etal., 1986) . The propensity of MS CSF cultures to grow immortal T-cell lines has been observed independently by both ourselves and other workers. Recently one of us (AGD) has observed an immortal T-cell line, with no similarity to any cell line carried in the laboratory a t the time, from a case of MS, which persistently produced low levels of reverse transcriptase which is the hallmark of retroviral replication and a further 'primary' culture produced continuous reverse transcriptase levels for at least 4 weeks. However, no virus was seen on electron microscopy. Moreover, many other viruses have also been associated with MS. High antibody titres against the measles virus were reported from many laboratories in the 1960s and subsequent reports have described high titres of antibody both in the serum and the CSF to a wide variety of other viruses, which include many common viruses such as rubella, mumps, influenza, parainfluenza, herpes, varicella and Epstein-Barr (ter Meulen & Stephenson, 1983).",

One possibility is that viruses induce an autoimmune reaction to myelin basic protein (MBP) by structural homology with this protein. Three independent computer searches (Jahnke et Fujinami & Oldstone, 1985; Waksman, 1985) have indicated the possible chemical basis for such a cross sensitization by demonstrating the presence of homologous peptide sequences in encephalitogenic regions of MBP and in antigens of measles, influenza Epstein-Barr virus and several papova and adenoviruses. Viruses such as measles, rubella and varicella have been shown to sensitize T-lymphocytes to MBP in cases of post infectious encephalomyelitis. In a study of such encephalomyelitis associated with rubella, multiple T-cell clones obtained from the CSF showed equal reactivity to the virus and MBP (Zamvil et al., 1985) .",

Firstly, many tests demonstrate no reactivity of MS patients to MBP, and in those tests that do demonstrate some activity not all the patients are positive, and reactivity is not specific to this disease, being found in addition in other non-demyelination neurological diseases (Leibowitz, 1983) . Secondly, immune reactivity to MBP has been investigated extensively in several species in the most studied non-viral model of MS experimental allergic encephalitis (EAE), but with few exceptions encephalitis induced by MBP produces no demyelination. Demyelination in EAE results only from immunization with whole white matter, whole myelin, oligodendrocytes or various glycolipids and appears to be a function of an immune response to the latter (Paterson, 1977; Raine et al., 1977; Konat et al., 1982) . Antibodies to glycolipids demyelinate cerebellar tissue cultures, those to MBP do not (Saida et al., 1977) . Anti-glycolipid antibodies (Arnon et al., 1980) and T-cell reactivity (Offner et al., 1981) have been demonstrated in MS patients, and the latter are more specific to this disease than is reactivity to MBP. Furthermore, ganglioside specific T-cell lines have been isolated from the CSF of MS patients (Belamy, Davison & Feldman, 1986) . It seems that immune sensitivity to glycolipids may be more important in MS than reactivity to MBP (Ilyas & Davison, 1983 ).",

Class I1 antigens have now been found on endothelial cells, astrocytes and macrophages within and surrounding MS lesions (Suzumura et al., 1986) and furthermore, brain vascular endothelial cells can be stimulated in vitro by activated T-cell supernatants or purified interferon to express Ia, and to present antigens such as MBP to T-cells (Massa, Dornes & ter Meulen, 1986) .",

The host cell components could include proteins such as MBP, and glycolipids such as galactocerebrosides. In the case of proteins, feline leukaemia virus (FELV) is an enveloped retrovirus which incorporates class I1 MHC antigens in its envelope, dependent on the density of expression of the MHC antigens on the virus producer cell lines (Azocar, Essex & Yunis, 1983 ). Similarly we have recently shown that HTLV-I, HIV and vesicular stomatitis virus all incorporate class I1 MHC antigens into their envelopes when grown in cells expressing this antigen (Clapham, Dalgleish, Weiss, in preparation) . In the case of glycolipids, all budding enveloped viruses incorporate host cell glycolipids into the viral envelope.",

The most likely autoantigens are those on the neurons, the myelin and its supporting oligodendrocytes. Infection of these cells with viruses capable of transactivating class I1 antigen expression such as HTLV-I and I1 (and possibly others), or with viruses capable of inducing class I1 antigens by the induction of interferon such as visna, could allow an enveloped virus to pick up both neuronal and class I1 antigens which might mimic an antigen presenting cell, so that host antigens are presented as 'foreign', in association with class I1 antigens. Such an event may well depend upon the spatial association of the antigens on the surface of the viral envelope. Furthermore, the type of class I1 antigen may also be important. Class I1 molecules, however, have not been found on the surface of neurons, myelin or oligodendrocytes. In the CNS only astrocytes and endothelial cells (Fontana & Fierz, 1986) have been demonstrated to be class I1 inducible cells. There thus seems to be a discontinuity between those cells that are likely to express autoantigens and those that are capable of inducing a demyelinating autoimmune reaction. Whereas it is possible that an enveloped virus could 'pick up' a class I1 antigen from one cell and then infect a neural cell and 'pick up' a neural antigen as well, this is unlikely as 'collected' antigens are probably shed and may not survive a further cycle of infection. However, a virus may translocate host proteins from one cell to another upon fusion with the cell membrane. The expression of class I1 antigens on brain cells, particularly astrocytes, oligodendrocytes and myelin, may allow an enveloped virus to mimic an antigen presenting cell.",
