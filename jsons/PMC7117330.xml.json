They were relatively recently discovered, and were first reported in 1975 (Madeley and Cosgrove, 1975). The family Astroviridae is divided into two genera, Avastrovirus, found in avian hosts, and Mamastrovirus, found in mammal hosts (Monroe et al., 2005). Recognized species in the genus Mamastrovirus include Bovine astrovirus, Feline astrovirus, Human astrovirus, Mink astrovirus, Ovine astrovirus, and Porcine astrovirus (Monroe et al., 2005). Human astrovirus is a significant cause of enteric disease in human children (Dennehy et al., 2001).",

Within the family Felidae, only domestic cats have been documented as host species for astroviruses, but infection is cosmopolitan, having been documented in Australia (Marshall et al., 1987), England (Harbour et al., 1987), Germany (Herbst and Krauss, 1988), New Zealand (Rice et al., 1993), and the United States (Hoshino et al., 1981). One study of fecal electron microscopy of cats found that astroviruses were the most common virus particles seen in cats with diarrhea (Marshall et al., 1987). Serum from a human with astrovirus-associated disease was found to react with feline astrovirus, implying similarity in antigenic regions, which are primarily found in portions of the capsid (Marshall et al., 1987, Matsui et al., 1993).",

            "text": "Currently, astrovirus diagnostics are very limited. As stated, there are few histopathologic changes associated with astrovirus infections, and electron microscopy may lack specificity and sensitivity. Despite high prevalence in humans, human astroviruses were not recognized until 1975, and relatively few astroviruses have been identified in other species. Culture of astroviruses is difficult, and the authors are not aware of previously published broad-range PCR protocols for this group of viruses that can cause clinically significant diarrhea. Therefore, improved methods of diagnostic testing for diverse astroviruses were needed. Consensus PCR represents a rapid way to obtain DNA template from clinical samples of novel viruses suitable for sequencing (Wellehan et al., 2004). Astroviruses are not uncommon in humans, the only hosts in which they have been well studied epidemiologically (Dennehy et al., 2001), and it is likely that there are numerous additional astrovirus species associated with disease in other vertebrates. The methods developed in this study will be useful for rapid identification and characterization of Mamastroviruses from diverse hosts.",

The index animal was a young adult female housed with 4 other cheetah of similar age in a large outdoor, vegetated enclosure. Her initial presenting signs included mild lethargy and partial anorexia. Two days later she developed watery diarrhea and there was evidence of regurgitation in her enclosure. At this time, fecal samples were submitted for electron microscopy and culture for enteric bacterial pathogens to the state diagnostic laboratory. Culture for enteric pathogens was performed by initially culturing fecal samples on blood agar, MacConkey's and penylethyl alcohol (PEA) media. Subcultures were then placed in tetrathionate enrichment media and incubated for 24 h at 42 \u00b0C. Broth cultures were then placed onto brilliant green and chrome agar for salmonella screening. Viral screening via PCR for canine parvovirus, feline panleukopenia (McKnight et al., 2007) and corona virus (Kennedy et al., 2001) was performed by veterinary diagnostic laboratories using standard techniques. Within 6 days of initial onset, she had fully recovered. Over the next 5 days, four additional animals within the same enclosure developed similar clinical signs. Two additional adult animals also developed similar clinical signs within this time frame. Five of the seven affected cats were housed together in a large outdoor enclosure with a natural grass substrate. The last two animals to develop signs were housed together in a separate pen that was not adjacent to the initial site and therefore did not have direct contact with the first group to develop signs. There were no reports from the animal keepers of any gastrointestinal signs amongst themselves or in any of their personal pets during this time. Additionally, no stray animals (domestic felines) had been observed in the area surrounding the cheetah enclosures to provide a route of infection.",

When looking at evolutionary relationships of more distantly related organisms, the continued accrual of mutations resulting in homoplasy can diminish the ability to correctly resolve phylogeny, making a rapidly mutating gene a poor choice. Astroviral capsid proteins are the most rapidly evolving part of the virus, and analysis of only synonymous nucleotide substitutions from astroviral capsid proteins found that insufficient phylogenetic signal remained for distance based analysis (van Hemert et al., 2007a), and significant compression of tree branches was found using maximum likelihood methods for analysis (van Hemert et al., 2007b), which are generally superior to distance based methods.

Genes that are critical for replication and are not under heavy immune selection are usually more conserved. Other studies have found that the astroviral polymerase is the most conserved part of the genome (Jonassen et al., 2003), and although the protease was not examined in this study, our data found that the polymerase was more conserved than the capsid. Polymerases are therefore more likely to accurately reflect the deeper history of the virus than capsid proteins. The disadvantage of the astroviral polymerase is the smaller database of sequence for comparison. The availability of more complete data sets for comparison results in greater phylogenetic resolution (Flynn et al., 2005). However, the total number of available astrovirus sequences from any gene is still relatively small, and techniques developed in this study could lead to rapid accumulation of sequence data from the polymerase gene of additional mamastroviruses.",

The other speciose placental mammal superorder, Euarchontoglires, has only one host from which an astrovirus is recognized, humans. Two possible explanations for this include greater distribution of astroviruses in the Laurasiatheria and lack of screening of the Euarchontoglires. Most agriculturally important or common companion mammals are in the Laurasiatheria, with only domestic rabbits falling into these categories from the Euarchontoglires. Humans have primarily valued a small number of other Euarchontoglires, such as mice, rats, and rhesus macaques, as laboratory animals. Similar reasons may have resulted in only finding avastroviruses in the order Galliformes, which are by far the most common agriculturally produced birds. Further screening of diverse species may result in a more complete picture of astrovirus evolution.",

            "text": "It has previously been noted that Feline astrovirus, Mink astrovirus, Ovine astrovirus, and Porcine astrovirus sequences are relatively GC rich compared to Human astrovirus and the characterized avastroviruses (van Hemert et al., 2007a). This trend was also seen in comparison of the regions of sequence in this study (Table 1\n). This has previously been interpreted as a drive toward host codon usage. Since birds and humans are more phylogenetically different, it was interpreted as acquisition of GC by non-human mammal astroviruses from AT-rich ancestors (van Hemert et al., 2007a). An alternate hypothesis would be the gain of AT in human and domestic poultry astroviruses from GC rich ancestors. There is evidence that adenoviruses and retroviruses become AT rich after recent host switching events (Poss et al., 2006, Wellehan et al., 2004), and this may also be the case with astroviruses. However, there does not appear to be a difference in %GC of the cheetah astrovirus relative to the reference Feline astrovirus sequence. If AT gain is seen after host switching events in astroviruses, three possible explanations for the lack of AT bias in cheetah astrovirus relative to the domestic cat astrovirus include a very recent host switch so that loss of GC has not had time to occur, recombinant acquisition of Feline astrovirus capsid by a distinct host-adapted cheetah astrovirus, and sufficient biological similarity between cheetahs and domestic cats such that selective pressures after a host switch are minimal.",

Sources in this outbreak could be dietary, fomite transmission from a source outside of the institution, or an in apparent carrier/shedder in the collection. Screening of the remaining unaffected population was not conducted during this outbreak but could be done in the future. Based on the molecular results, this represents a novel pathogen for this species, and astrovirus should be considered as a differential diagnosis in cases of diarrhea in cheetahs.",
