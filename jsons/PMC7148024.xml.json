This has motivated researchers to study answer sentence and passage retrieval, in particular in response to non-factoid questions [1, 18]. Non-factoid questions are defined as open-ended questions that require complex answers, like descriptions, opinions, or explanations, which are mostly passage-level texts. Questions like \u201cHow to cook burgers?\u201d are non-factoid. We believe this type of questions plays a pivotal role in the overall quality of question answering systems, since their technologies are not as mature as those for factoid questions, which seek precise facts, such as \u201cAt what age did Rossini stop writing opera?\u201d.",

Some existing collections, e.g., [8, 13], consist of few queries, which are not sufficient to train sophisticated machine learning models for the task. Some others, e.g.,  [1], significantly suffer from incomplete judgments. Most recently, Cohen et al. [3] developed a publicly available collection for non-factoid question answering with a few thousands questions, which is called WikiPassageQA. Although WikiPassageQA is an invaluable contribution to the community, it does not cover all aspects of the non-factoid question answering task and has the following limitations: (i) it only contains an average of 1.7 relevant passages per question and does not cover many questions with multiple correct answers; (ii) it was created from the Wikipedia website, containing only formal text; (iii) more importantly, the questions in the WikiPassageQA dataset were generated by crowdworkers, which is different from the questions that users ask in real-world systems; (iv) the relevant passages in WikiPassageQA contain the answer to the question in addition to some surrounding text. Therefore, some parts of a relevant passage may not answer any aspects of the question; (v) it only provides binary relevance labels.",

In more detail, we focus on the non-factoid questions that have been asked by users of Yahoo! Answers, a community question answering (CQA) service. Non-factoid CQA data without relevance annotation has been previously used in [1], however, as mentioned by the authors, it significantly suffers from incomplete judgments (see Sect. 2 for more information on existing collections). We collected four-level relevance labels through a careful crowdsourcing procedure involving multiple iterations and several automatic and manual quality checks. Note that we paid extra attention to collect reliable and comprehensive relevance judgments for the test set. Therefore, we annotated the answers after conducting result pooling among several term-matching and neural retrieval models. In summary, ANTIQUE provides annotations for 34,011 question-answer pairs, which is significantly larger than many comparable datasets.",

            "text": "Non-factoid QA Datasets. There have been efforts for developing non-factoid question answering datasets [7, 8, 16]. Keikha et al. [8] introduced the WebAP dataset, which is a non-factoid QA dataset with 82 queries. The questions and answers in WebAP were not generated by real users. There exist a number of datasets that partially contain non-factoid questions and were collected from CQA websites, such as Yahoo! Webscope L6, Qatar Living [9], and StackExchange. These datasets are often restricted to a specific domain, suffer from incomplete judgments, and/or do not contain sufficient non-factoid questions for training sophisticated machine learning models. The nfL6 dataset [1] is a collection of non-factoid questions extracted from the Yahoo! Webscope L6. Its main drawback is the absence of complete relevance annotation. Previous work assumes that the only answer that the question writer has marked as correct is relevant, which is far from being realistic. That is why we aim to collect a complete set of relevance annotations. WikiPassageQA is another non-factoid QA dataset that has been recently created by Cohen et al. [3]. As mentioned in Sect. 1, despite its great potentials, it has a number of limitations. ANTIQUE addresses these limitations to provide a complementary benchmark for non-factoid question answering (see Sect. 1). More recently, Microsoft has released the MS MARCO V2.1 passage re-ranking dataset [10], containing a large number of queries sampled from the Bing search engine. In addition to not being specific to non-factoid QA, it significantly suffers from incomplete judgments. In contrast, ANTIQUE provides a reliable collection with complete relevance annotations for evaluating non-factoid QA models.",
