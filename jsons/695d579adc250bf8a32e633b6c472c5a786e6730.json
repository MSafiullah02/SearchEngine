            "text": "Asthma is a chronic airway inflammatory disease associated with bronchial hyper-responsiveness and reversible airflow limitation. In addition to airway inflammation, structural changes, termed airway remodelling, are also evident within the airways 1 and are thought to result from chronic inflammation. Another feature of asthma is acute exacerbations. Respiratory viral infections are frequently associated with exacerbations of asthma, 2-4 but the association between exacerbations of asthma and airway remodelling is poorly understood. The most frequently isolated pathogens during viral infection-induced exacerbations are RNA viruses including rhinovirus, parainfluenza virus and respiratory syncytial viruses. [2] [3] [4] RNA virus synthesizes double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) during viral replication and dsRNA activates the innate immune system through several receptors including Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3), retinoic-acid inducible gene-I (RIG-I), and melanoma differentiation-associated gene-5 (MDA-5). 5, 6 As a result dsRNA induces the secretion of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines and should be considered as one of the factors potentially responsible for virus-induced asthma exacerbations.",

            "text": "Respiratory viral infections are frequently associated with exacerbations of asthma. Double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) produced during viral infections may be one of the stimuli for exacerbation. We aimed to assess the potential effect of dsRNA on certain aspects of chronic asthma through the administration of polyinosine-polycytidylic acid (poly I:C), synthetic dsRNA, to a rat model of asthma. Brown Norway rats were sensitized to ovalbumin and challenged three times to evoke airway remodelling. The effect of poly I:C on the ovalbumin-induced airway inflammation and structural changes was assessed from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and histological findings. The expression of cytokines and chemokines was evaluated by real-time quantitative reverse transcription PCR and ELISA. Ovalbumin-challenged animals showed an increased number of total cells and eosinophils in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid compared with PBS-challenged controls. Ovalbumin-challenged animals treated with poly I:C showed an increased number of total cells and neutrophils in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid compared with those without poly I:C treatment. Ovalbumin-challenged animals showed goblet cell hyperplasia, increased airway smooth muscle mass, and proliferation of both airway epithelial cells and airway smooth muscle cells. Treatment with poly I:C enhanced these structural changes. Among the cytokines and chemokines examined, the expression of interleukins 12 and 17 and of transforming growth factor-b 1 in ovalbumin-challenged animals treated with poly I:C was significantly increased compared with those of the other groups. Doublestranded RNA enhanced airway inflammation and remodelling in a rat model of bronchial asthma. These observations suggest that viral infections may promote airway remodelling.",

[5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] For example, intravenous injection of dsRNA induces the production of type I interferon (IFN), IFN-c, and interleukin-12 (IL-12) in mice. [5] [6] [7] Treatment with dsRNA induces the production of type I IFN by mast cells. 8 Bronchial epithelial cells treated with dsRNA show increased secretion of several chemokines and mucous cell metaplasia. [9] [10] [11] Furthermore it has been demonstrated that dsRNA augments the differentiation of fibroblasts to myofibroblasts. 12 In a rat model of asthma, dsRNA enhances airway inflammation and bronchial hyper-responsiveness. 13 In a mouse model of asthma, dsRNA also induces airway inflammation with a low dose inducing T helper type 2 (Th2) cytokines and a high dose inducing Th1 cytokines. 14 There are no reports concerning the effect of dsRNA on airway remodelling.",

The airways of the PBSchallenged groups showed relatively few PCNA-positive epithelial cells and ASM cells (Figs 6a,b and 7a,b) . Challenge with OVA led to an increase in the number of both PCNApositive airway epithelial cells and ASM cells (Figs 6c and  7c) . Furthermore, the poly I:C/OVA group showed a prominent increase in number of both PCNA-positive epithelial cells and ASM cells (Figs 6d and 7d) . Quantification of PCNA-positive epithelial cells and ASM cells showed that repeated allergen challenges led to a significant increase in the number of PCNA-positive epithelial cells and ASM cells and these increases were significantly enhanced by poly I:C treatment (Figs 6e and 7e) .

Most of the RNA viruses that cause respiratory infection, including rhinovirus, coronavirus, parainfluenza virus and respiratory syncytial virus, have long single-stranded RNA. These RNA viruses produce long dsRNA during their replication. Therefore, TLR3 and MDA-5 are considered as the main receptors of dsRNA during respiratory viral infec-tions. Because it has been demonstrated that a synthetic dsRNA poly I:C consists of long-length dsRNA and serves as a ligand for TLR3 and MDA-5, 7 we chose poly I:C to simulate infection with these long-RNA respiratory viruses.",

We have also shown that treatment with dsRNA enhances the expression of TGFb 1 , which plays an important role in promoting the structural changes of tissue remodelling. 32, 33 These data suggest that virus-induced exacerbations of asthma may result in airway remodelling through activation of dsRNA receptors and TGF-b 1 . Consistent with this idea, it has been reported that activation of TLR3 by dsRNA induces production of a-SMA and extracellular matrix protein including fibronectin and collagen through increase of TGF-b 1 in fibroblasts. 12 Another important characteristic of the animals treated with dsRNA is an increased expression of IL-12 and IL-17. The Th2 hypothesis of asthma pathogenesis proposes that asthma is caused by an increase in Th2 response in combination with a decrease in Th1 response. 34 However, some studies have indicated that Th1 plays a role in severe asthma. [35] [36] [37] Other studies have shown that neutrophilic inflammation in severe asthma is related to Th1 cytokine expression. 38, 39 Recently the role of IL-17 has been investigated in relation to asthma, in particular in neutrophilic asthma. [40] [41] [42] [43] Our data suggest that dsRNA produced during viral infections enhances the expression of Th1 and Th17 cytokines in the airways and may therefore lead to promoting a severe phenotype of asthma. Consistent with our results, previous studies have demonstrated that dsRNA induces neutrophilic airway inflammation 14, [44] [45] [46] and can cause Th1, Th2, or Th17 responses depending on the dose and timing of administration. 14, [45] [46] [47] In conclusion, a rat asthma model treated with dsRNA demonstrated enhanced recruitment of neutrophils in the airways, both Th1 and Th17 cytokine expression, and strong airway remodelling. Our results provide a potential explanation for virus-induced asthma worsening and suggest an association between these exacerbations and augmentation of airway remodelling. The dsRNA and its receptors may be worthwhile therapeutic targets in patients with virus-induced asthma exacerbations and airway remodelling.",
