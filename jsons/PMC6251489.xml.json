            "text": "Coronaviruses (CoV) are enveloped, single strand (+)RNA viruses that cause respiratory and enteric infections across a broad range of animal species. Several coronaviruses have recently emerged as zoonotic infections that cause life-threatening human disease, exemplified by the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV) epidemic in 2002/2003 as well as more recent clusters of infections caused by the Middle East Respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). MERS-CoV is a lineage C beta-coronavirus first isolated in the summer of 2012 from a hospitalized patient in Saudi Arabia [1], and to date there have been >1500 MERS cases worldwide. MERS-CoV infection causes symptoms of high fever and acute, progressive pneumonia in humans, and infection can be associated with a significant mortality rate (\u223c30-50%) in individuals with comorbidities [2,3]. As no vaccine exists and trials of drugs and immune response modulators have demonstrated poor efficacy in vivo, there is considerable interest in identifying and optimizing novel therapies to resolve MERS-CoV infections [3,4]. Therapeutic strategies encompass those targeting viral components as well as host-based processes that support MERS-CoV infectivity and replication [3,4]. Consequently, resolution of the cell biology of MERS-CoV infection to illuminate the cellular infrastructure that controls viral entry, organelle passage and transferal into the cytoplasm for replication is of particular interest for evaluating new host targets with promise for development, or repurposing, of MERS-CoV therapeutics.",

            "text": "Research into the cell biology of MERS has shown that MERS-CoV particle entry is facilitated by interaction between the viral spike (S) protein and a specific host surface receptor, dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4, also known as CD26, [5]). Proteolytic priming of the spike protein promotes fusion of the viral envelope with host cell membranes, thus allowing successful translocation of the infectious viral genome into the host cell. Recent reports have demonstrated that such proteolytic priming and membrane fusion may occur either at the cell surface via the serine protease TMPRSS2 [6], or intracellularly in endocytic compartments via proprotein convertases such as furin (7). Following clathrin-mediated endocytosis, the virus traffics through the endolysosomal system where it is proteolytically activated by host proteases to mediate vesicular fusion and liberation into the cytoplasm [7,8]. This subcellular translocation pathway affords opportunity for pharmacological intervention as generalized manipulations of endolysosomal function, through inhibition of endocytosis, cytoskeletal dynamics and bulk alkalization of acidic organelles, have been shown to impair MERS-CoV infectivity [[7], [8], [9], [10]]. Such observations provide justification for pharmacological profiling of targets within acidic organelles to identify novel, more selective opportunities to impair MERS-CoV translocation through the endolysosomal system.",

            "text": "Ion channels of the two-pore channel (TPC1, TPC2) and mucolipin family (e.g. TRPML1) reside within the endolysosomal system where they regulate endolysosomal microenvironment and trafficking functions [11,12]. As MERS-CoV translocation and release into the cytoplasm requires the interplay with the endolysosomal milieu [7,8], the ability of these Ca2+-permeable channels to acutely regulate luminal ionic composition and pH promotes their consideration as potential therapeutic targets. Manipulation of endolysosomal ion channel function has been shown to impact endolysosomal morphology and homeostatic trafficking in a variety of cell types [[13], [14], [15], [16], [17], [18], [19], [20]]. Pharmacological manipulation of these channels may therefore permit a defter approach for impairing MERS-CoV translocation than more generalized perturbations of endolysosomal function. Of special relevance is the recent discovery that the natural product tetrandrine acts as a potent blocker of both TPC activity and Ebola infectivity, reducing viral titers in the serum of infected mice [21]. The efficacy of tetrandrine related to interference with a late step in Ebola virus translocation, possibly by preventing viral-endosome membrane fusion from within TPC2\u2013positive structures [21], or by interfering with a TPC2-driven late endosome/lysosome maturation process [22]. Such data provide impetus for considering TPCs as druggable targets for combating a potentially broad range of infectious pathogens that must traverse, or reside within, the acidic Ca2+ store milieu. Here, we use both pharmacological and molecular approaches to address this concept in the context of MERS-CoV infectivity, as the contribution played by endolysosomal channels in facilitating MERS-CoV translocation is currently unknown.",

MERS-CoV-spike-pseudotyped retroviruses expressing a luciferase reporter gene were prepared by co-transfecting HEK293 T cells with a plasmid carrying Env-defective, luciferase-expressing HIV-1 genome (pNL4-3.luc.RE) and a plasmid encoding MERS-CoV spike (S) protein. The S protein has previously been shown to be necessary and sufficient to facilitate MERS-CoV cell entry. M.ERS-pseudovirus particles were harvested from supernatant 72 h after transfection. Huh7 cells, which express hsDPP4 endogenously [26], were used to resolve the effects of drugs on MERS-pseudovirus translocation. Huh7 cells were seeded into 96-well plates (Midwest Scientific) at a concentration of 1 \u00d7 104 cells/well. The following day, cells were pre-incubated with individual drugs (10\u03bcM final concentration) for 1 h prior to MERS-pseudovirus addition. Cells were incubated (5% CO2/37 \u00b0C) for an additional 5 h in the presence of drug and pseudovirus. After 6 h, the culture media was replaced with complete DMEM and cells were incubated for a further 60 h. Cells were then washed 3 times with DPBS (Invitrogen) and assayed for luciferase activity. Cells were lysed in 80 \u03bcl lysis buffer (Promega) per well, and 40 \u03bcl of lysate was transferred to solid-white 96-well plates (Corning) and mixed with 40 \u03bcl of luciferase substrate (Promega). Luminescence (relative luminescence units, RLUs) were measured using a GloMax-multi detection system (Promega). Luminescence values are reported relative to levels measured in cells treated with virus alone, background corrected by luminescence values in cells unexposed to virus, except where indicated. For cell viability assays, Huh7 cells were lysed 60 h post drug treatment, using cell lysis buffer (Promega). Lysates were transferred to solid white 96-well plates to be screened in an ATP-based viability assay (CellTiter-Glo 2.0, Promega) according to the vendor\u2019s protocol. Finally, for molecular manipulations, HEK293 cells (1.5 \u00d7 104 cells/well) were used owing to higher transfectability. Extra samples were harvested, for immunoblotting or RNA extraction, from the same samples used to study pseudovirus infectivity.",

For RNAi analyses, constructs were expressed in HEK293 cells to capitalize upon the high transfectability of this cell line. Experiments assaying MERS infectivity in HEK293 cells also necessitated co-expression of the MERS-CoV entry receptor dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (hsDPP4 [5],) owing to low endogenous hsDPP4 expression: luminescence levels were low in the presence of pseudovirus and endogenous DPP4 alone and expression of hsDPP4 resulted in \u223c5-fold enhancement of luminescence signal (Fig. 2\nA, [29]). Co-expression of a GFP control plasmid did not alter infectivity levels (Fig. 2A). As negative and positive controls, transfection of a dominant negative Rab construct (Rab5a[S34 N]) which impairs endocytic activity depressed MERS-CoV pseudovirus infectivity, whereas a constitutively active Rab variant (Rab7a[Q67 L]) potentiated MERS-CoV pseudovirus infectivity (Fig. 2A).",

Discrete siRNAs targeting TPC1, TPC2 and TRPML1 were transfected into cells and infectivity assays performed 1 day after the final transfection. Whereas two discrete control siRNAs, or dual siRNAs targeting TRPML1 had little effect in this assay, knockdown of endogenous TPC1 or TPC2 markedly inhibited MERS translocation (Fig. 2A). Co-transfection of TPC1 and TPC2 siRNA did not enhance this inhibitory effect (Fig. 2A). The penetrance of knockdown attained with these siRNAs was evaluated by RT.PCR in the same set of transfections used for the pseudovirus infection assay. Representative gels are shown (Fig. 2B) together with associated densitometry from all additional experiments evidencing knockdown of individual channels (Fig. 2B). Overexpression of TPC isoforms, a manipulation known to perturb endolysosomal trafficking, also impaired MERS-CoV pseudovirus translocation (Fig. 2A). Overexpression of TRPML1 was without effect (Fig. 2A). This inhibitory effect was dependent on appropriate subcellular targeting of the active channel as overexpression of a functional TPC2 channel rerouted from acidic Ca2+ stores to the cell surface (TPC2pm, [25]) by deletion of the NH2-terminal lysosomal targeting motif did not inhibit MERS-CoV pseudovirus infectivity (Fig. 2A). Moreover, the inhibitory action of these manipulations was not caused by alterations in DPP4 expression, as similar DPP4 expression levels were observed across all conditions (Supplementary Fig. 2).",

These experiments were performed using Huh7 cells owing to the fact that this cell line expresses higher endogenous levels of hsDPP4 (\u223c18-fold, compared with HEK293 cells [7]). This obviates the need for hsDPP4 transfection and allows examination MERS-CoV pseudovirus trafficking in a native cell line. While no signal was evident in Huh7 cells unexposed to pseudovirus, MERS-CoV spike protein could be resolved in vesicular structures in cells previously incubated with pseudovirus (2 h, 4 \u00b0C) and fixed 45 min after a 37 \u00b0C incubation (Fig. 3\n). Co-transfection with Rab5-GFP or Rab7-GFP evidenced MERS CoV spike protein co-localization within a subset of both Rab5-GFP and Rab7-GFP positive vesicles (Supplementary Fig. 3). Expression of TPC constructs (TPC1-GFP, TPC2-GFP) evidenced colocalization between the MERS CoV spike protein with both TPC2 (biased toward lysosomes [24,32]) and TPC1 (biased toward endosomes [24,32]) in all samples examined (Fig. 3). Colocalization between MERS-CoV spike protein and GFP-TRPML1 was also observed (Fig. 3). Collectively these data are consistent with MERS pseudovirus translocation through TPC positive endolysosomal organelles (Fig. 3), with the properties and/or dynamics of these structures that are permissive for MERS-CoV pseudovirus translocation being regulated by endogenous TPC activity (Fig. 2).",

            "text": "TPCs show affinity for a broad range of voltage-operated channel ligands, possibly reflecting their ancient evolutionary pedigree as antecedents of four domain voltage-gated ion channels [33]. Consistent with these observations, several Na+ channel blockers (procaine, benzocaine) and voltage-operated Ca2+ antagonists (verapamil, nicardipine and nimodipine) attenuated MERS-CoV pseudovirus translocation (Fig. 4A). Of particular relevance were the effects of bisbenzylisoquinoline alkaloids, compounds consisting of dual benzylisoquinoline moieties linked together by ether bridge(s) (Fig. 4B, Supplementary Fig. 4). These compounds are of interest in light of the recent discovery that tetrandrine, a bisbenzylisoquinoline alkaloid natural product, blocked TPC activity and potently inhibited Ebola virus infectivity in vitro and in vivo [21]. Therefore, we screened several bisbenzylisoquinoline alkaloids from two different groupings (Fig. 4B) \u2013 tubocurarine-like ligands where the isoquinoline pairs were non-adjacent within the bisbenzylisoquinoline ring structure (abab, \u2018head-to-tail\u2019), and tetrandrine-like ligands, where the isoquinoline groups are directly conjoined (aabb, \u2018head-to-head and tail-to-tail\u2019). These two groups are discriminated by shading intensity in Fig. 4A&B and structures of individual compounds are provided in Supplementary Data (Supplementary Fig. 4). Several structure-activity insights were clear from the screening dataset. First, the tubocurarine\u2013like bisbenzylisoquinolines (tubocurarine, cycleanine, metocurine) were considerably less effective compared to the tetrandrine-like ligands (tetrandrine, thaligine and fangchinoline) which strongly impaired MERS-CoV pseudovirus translocation (Fig. 4A&B). Second, the presence of individual methoxy moieties around the compound ring structure markedly influenced the penetrance of individual ligands, with examples of ring substitutions that preserved (fangchinoline, thaligine) or decreased (berbamine, herandezine) drug effectiveness relative to the anti-Ebola prototype tetrandrine. Finally, fangchinoline, and the stereoisomer thaligine (\u2018isofangchinoline\u2019) were the most effective compounds at inhibiting MERS translocation in these assays. Compounds from the initial screen were further evaluated in full concentration-response relationships for inhibition of MERS-CoV pseudovirus infectivity (Fig. 4C). The relative sensitivities to screened compounds \u2013 fangchinoline (IC50 = 1.7 \u00b1 0.1 \u03bcM) > tetrandrine (IC50 = 7.0 \u00b1 0.8 \u03bcM) > berbamine (IC50 = 29.2 \u00b1 7.0 \u03bcM) were consistent with the primary screen (fixed concentration, 10 \u03bcM). Cellular viability was measured in parallel and used to calculate a \u2018selectivity index\u2019 for these selected compounds. Calculation of the selectivity index (cytotoxic concentration \u2018CC50\u2019 for cellular toxicity / IC50 for MERS inhibition) underscored the improved performance of fangchinoline over tetrandrine (Fig. 4C, inset). These data support an efficacy of specific bisbenzylisoquinoline alkaloids as agents for targeting MERS-CoV in vitro. To assess the ability of the same compounds to inhibit NAADP-evoked Ca2+ release, confocal Ca2+ imaging experiments were performed in human U2OS cells microinjected with NAADP. Preincubation of cells with tetrandrine or fangchinoline (10\u03bcM) inhibited Ca2+ signals triggered by NAADP microinjection (69 \u00b1 16% and 88 \u00b1 3% inhibition for tetrandrine and fangchinoline, respectively), evidencing fangchinoline as an effective inhibitor of both NAADP-evoked Ca2+ release (Fig. 4D) and MERS-CoV pseudovirus translocation (Fig. 4A&C). No antiviral activity was observed following inhibition of IP3- or cADPR-evoked Ca2+ release (Fig. 1 in [37]). The inhibition of NAADP-evoked Ca2+ release and MERS-CoV pseudovirus translocation by these compounds was not due to lysosomotropism, as we found no significant decrease in lysosomal Ca2+ content or disruption of lysosomal pH upon addition of these drug (Supplemental Fig. 5). Finally, the effects of two other cell permeable endolysosomal ion channel modulators were examined: the NAADP antagonist ned-19 [38], and the TRPML agonist ML-SA1 [13]. Ned-19 showed poor inhibitory activity in the MERS translocation assays (Fig. 4A), which was surprising as it is widely employed as a NAADP blocker. However, in our hands, trans-ned-19 (up to \u223c50\u03bcM) also failed to potently inhibit NAADP-evoked Ca2+ release in either mammalian cells (Fig. 4D) or sea urchin homogenate (Fig. 4 in [37]), suggesting some caution in interpretation of results obtained with commercially sourced ned-19. The activity of the cell permeable TRPML agonist ML-SA1, which did not modulate MERS-CoV pseudovirus infectivity (Fig. 4A), was confirmed as application to mammalian cell lines elicited clear Ca2+ transients (data not shown).",

Addition of the PIKfyve inhibitor YM201636 to reduce PI(3,5)P2 levels, a phosphoinositide which activates TPC channels, decreased MERS-CoV pseudovirus translocation (Supplementary Fig. 6 A&B). Sphingosine is generated through the action of acid ceramidase (AC, Asah1) on ceramide, a product of acid sphingomyelinase (ASM, Smpd1) activity (Supplementary Fig. 6). Acid sphingomyelinase is required for Ebola infection [40], although the roles of ASM and AC have not been studied in MERS-CoV pseudovirus infectivity. In Huh7 cells exposed to pseudovirus, addition of the antidepressant drugs desipramine or amitriptyline, both of which act as functional inhibitors of ASM [41,42], inhibited MERS-CoV pseudovirus translocation (Supplementary Fig. 6B). Concentration-response curves demonstrated potent inhibition (IC50 = 796 nM for desipramine, IC50 = 4.8 \u03bcM for amitriptyline) with little deleterious effects on cellular viability over the concentration range studied (Supplementary Fig. 6C). Pharmacological inhibition of AC, to reduce sphingosine levels, also reduced luminescence levels (Supplementary Fig. 6B). In contrast, incubation with fumonisin B1, an inhibitor of ceramide synthase enzymes localized in the endoplasmic reticulum, which utilize sphingosine to synthesize ceramide, did not significantly decrease luminescence values. Discrete siRNAs targeting Smpd1 or Asah1 inhibited MERS translocation (Supplementary Fig. 6D), and successful knockdown of these enzymes was validated (Supplementary Fig. 6E). Therefore, inhibition of enzymes upstream, but not downstream, of the TPC1 activator sphingosine impaired MERS-CoV pseudovirus infectivity. In summary, these data demonstrate dysregulation of known lipid TPC regulators also impeded MERS pseudovirus translocation.",

Treatment of Huh7 cells with fangchinoline (10\u03bcM) increased MERS particle colocalization with both TPC1-GFP and TPC2-GFP labelled structures (Fig. 5\nA). Quantification of colocalization using Pearson\u2019s correlation coefficient [43] from single cell regions of interest in fixed samples showed that fangchinoline treatment increased levels of pixel-to-pixel covariance across MERS and TPC-positive structures (Fig. 5A, inset). Analysis of MERS-CoV spike protein colocalization with TPCs using a different algorithm (Manders\u2019 coefficient) also demonstrated a similar increase in colocalization after fangchinoline treatment (Fig. 5B). These results are suggestive of a drug-evoked blockade of endolysosomal MERS-CoV pseudovirus translocation events. In live cell imaging experiments, it was also evident that fangchinoline treatment impacted the mobility of fluorescent dextran labelled endosomal structures. Single particle tracking analysis revealed that incubation of cells in fangchinoline, or tetrandrine, decreased the mobility of dextran-labelled endosomal structures (Fig. 5C). Impaired movement of TPC1-labelled structures was also seen in cells overexpressing the pore-dead mutant TPC1[L273 P]-GFP, but not TPC1-GFP, suggesting that drug-evoked inhibition of TPC1 activity underpinned this effect on endosomal motility (Fig. 5D).",

For these experiments, the kinetics of furin-evoked cleavage of a fluorogenic substrate (Boc-RVRR-AMC) was measured in cell lysates under different experimental conditions. In Huh7 cells, pretreatment of cells with fangchinoline (10\u03bcM, 4 h) markedly reduced the rate of substrate cleavage (19.3 \u00b1 2.5% of control, Fig. 6\nA&B). In contrast, inhibition was not observed during acute drug treatment, demonstrating fangchinoline did not act as a direct furin inhibitor (Fig. 6A&B). Similar assays were repeated in HEK293 cells treated with the validated siRNAs against TPC1 or TPC2 (Fig. 6C). Knockdown of either TPC isoform impaired furin activity, decreasing the initial rate of substrate cleavage by 59.9 \u00b1 3.6% (TPC1) or 54.3 \u00b1 3.0% (TPC1, Fig. 6D). These data show that pharmacological or molecular inhibition of TPC function impaired furin activity. Consequently, we tested whether furin overexpression could rescue drug inhibition of MERS-CoV pseudovirus translocation. Overexpression of furin markedly attenuated drug-evoked inhibition of MERS-CoV pseudovirus infectivity in Huh7 cells (Fig. 6E). The inhibition observed with tetrandrine and fangchinoline in control experiments (>80% inhibition) was considerably attenuated by transfection with exogenous furin (<30% inhibition, Fig. 6E). Overexpression of the serine protease TMPRSS2 to bias MERS-CoV pseudovirus translocation to direct entry via the plasma membrane also rendered both bisbenzylisoquinoline alkaloids ineffective at blocking MERS-CoV pseudovirus infectivity (Fig. 6F). The lack of inhibitory action of tetrandrine or fangchinoline after direct cell entry at the plasma membrane rule out the possibility that these compounds act processes downstream of membrane fusion, including transcription or translation. These data confirm that tetrandrine and fangchinoline act by blocking the trafficking and processing of internalized MERS-CoV pseudovirus particles within the endolysosomal system.",

            "text": "How do TPCs support MERS passage from cell surface to cytoplasm? Fig. 5 shows that TPC activity is necessary to support trafficking events and passage of pseudovirus particles through TPC-positive compartments in the endolysosomal trafficking pathway. Effects on particle progression and processing are likely interdependent: TPCs also regulate furin activity (Fig. 6). TPC activity is known to alter both endolysosomal Ca2+ content and pH [44,45] and both factors regulate the activity of proprotein convertases (such as furin) required for proteolytic activation of the spike protein, MERS-CoV fusion activity and cytoplasmic translocation [7,46]. Dysregulation of the luminal microenvironment (pH, Ca2+) owing to changes in TPC activity may then impair MERS-CoV fusion depending on protease levels, or diversity of protease expression, within a given cell type. The inhibitory and non-additive effects of TPC1 (biased toward endosomes) and TPC2 (biased toward lysosomes) knockdown (Fig. 2A) suggest that MERS translocation occurs throughout proximal and distal compartments within the acidic Ca2+ stores. Prior investigations of MERS infectivity suggest fusion and cytoplasmic translocation occurs from early endosomes [8], while more recent studies demonstrate inhibition of cathepsin L, a lysosomal cysteine protease, blocks MERS infectivity [47], both studies consistent with the demonstrated role for both TPC1 and TPC2 (Fig. 2). A further conclusion that can be drawn from the current data is that the role of TPCs appears selective: manipulation of TRPML1 function, another \u2018acidic Ca2+ store\u2019 ion channel, failed to impair MERS-CoV pseudovirus infectivity. These data suggest sub-specialization in endolysosomal channel function and/or trafficking pathways, as TPC inhibition may selectively impair only a subset of transported substrates rather than effect a global disruption of endolysosomal function \u2013 a feature that may prove critical in advancing the viability of TPCs as selective drug targets. Selectivity in drug action against TPCs was also evident through a correlation between the extent of inhibition of NAADP-evoked Ca2+ signals and impairment of MERS translocation (Fig. 4), a relationship which is evidenced further in the companion paper [37]. Further drugs that inhibited MERS pseudovirus translocation do not inhibit other intracellular Ca2+ mobilization pathways (Fig. 1 in [37]), even though the role of TPCs in amplifying Ca2+ signals through other intracellular Ca2+ channels beyond the endolysosomal system is well appreciated. In short, the data support a selective, spatially autonomous role for TPCs within acidic organelles in supporting MERS infectivity.",

This is a topical issue given renewed interest in repurposing Ca2+ channel ligands to impair viral infectivity [21,48,49], although most attention to date has been directed toward cell surface targets such as voltage-operated Ca2+ channels (VOCCs). However many VOCC blockers also inhibit NAADP-evoked Ca2+ release activity in the high micromolar range [50], likely due to the pedigree of the TPC structural blueprint as an antecedent for cell surface voltage-gated channel architecture [33]. TPC blockade may therefore constitute a component of previously described antiviral VOCC antagonist action. The promiscuous pharmacology of TPCs may nevertheless prove a challenge for discovering selective, high affinity TPC ligands. However, the emerging capacity to (i) interrogate cell biological assays that depend on TPC function (such as explored here), (ii) miniaturize NAADP-evoked Ca2+ release screening platforms (see companion paper, [37]) and (iii) integrate structure-based approaches based upon the recent resolution of TPC crystal structures [[51], [52], [53]], will collectively spur opportunities to identify novel leads and optimizing ligand affinity and selectivity for these channels.",

Bisbenzylisoquinoline alkaloids are classified based on the number, type and orientation of ring linkages [[56], [57], [58]]. While the compounds studied here provide only limited insight into the structural diversity of this series, representing compounds with two diphenyl ether linkages differing in their orientation (\u2018head-to-tail\u2019 versus \u2018head-to-head\u2019 and \u2018tail-to-tail\u2019), nevertheless clear insight into structure-activity relationships impacting MERS translocation/intracellular Ca2+ release properties was discernable (Fig. 4) providing impetus for further structural exploration of the bisbenzylisoquinoline scaffold. This should encompass compounds with differing number of ring linkages (effect of ring flexibility), the position and nature of the ring substitutions, as well as the stereochemistry around the dual asymmetric carbons. We note the potency of tetrandrine against MERS was lower than previously reported for tetrandrine against Ebola (tens of nM in vitro, [21]). The improved performance of fangchinoline over tetrandrine in this particular assay supports future optimization of structure activity relationships in this compound series against specific pathogens (Fig. 4D). Also noteworthy in our experiments was the efficacy and good selectivity indices seen with the FDA-approved serotonin reuptake inhibitors, amitriptyline and desipramine (Supplementary Fig. 6). Further investigation of the interrelationship between the antiviral activity of SSRIs (Supplementary Fig. 6, [49]), endolysosomal bioactive lipid content (these compounds act as functional inhibitors of acid sphingomyelinase [41,42]) and effects on TPC activity is also warranted.",

A, Top, schematic representation of MERS-pseudovirus infection pathway, highlighting individual processes during MERS translocation (binding, internalization, trafficking, release) that are targets for pharmacotherapy. MERS particle association with DPP4 (the host entry receptor) is followed by DPP4-dependent internalization and trafficking through acidic Ca2+ stores and release of luciferase-encoding RNA into the cytoplasm of infected cells after fusion with internal membranes. Note, the pseudovirus translocation assay used for these experiments is replication defective and reports only virus translocation. Bottom, trafficking events through the endolysosomal system are regulated by the activity of ion channels resident within these acidic Ca2+ stores, including members of the TRPML (activated by PI(3,5)P2) and TPC family (activated by NAADP and PI(3,5)P2). B, Effect of drug incubation (spanning 1 h prior to pseudovirus addition and for a 5 h co-incubation after) on MERS infectivity measured in terms of luminescence intensity measured 3 days post-infection.

Pseudovirus infectivity was unaffected by the presence of DMSO (0.1%) as drug vehicle. C, Delayed exposure to bafilomycin (\u2020, 6 h exposure, 5 h after pseudovirus addition) attenuated the inhibitory effect of bafilomycin (100 nM) on MERS infectivity.
