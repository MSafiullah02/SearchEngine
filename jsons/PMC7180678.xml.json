Their helical symmetry nucleocapsid is approximately 26\u201332 kb in size, making it the largest investigated genome among RNA viruses [2, 3]. Coronaviruses have a fundamental resemblance in their organization and genome expression [4]. Previously, it was thought that coronaviruses only cause enzootic infections in a number of animals, including certain birds and mammals, but recent findings indicate that a variety of these viruses, including antigenic groups 1 (229E and NL63), antigenic groups 2 (OC43), and HKU1, can infect humans [5, 6]. These viruses often lead to upper respiratory tract infection, frequently resulting in common cold symptoms. Three specific strains of these viruses that are of zoonotic origin, including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), have recently caused lethal infections in humans [4, 6, 7].",

The incubation period of 2019-nCov has been estimated to be 1\u201314 days, and it has been shown that asymptomatic individuals may also be involved in the spread of this virus [26\u201328]. Since the possibility of the transmission from asymptomatic carriers has been raised currently, checking body temperature only may not be enough to screen asymptomatic carriers. According to a recent report, temperature-based screening in the airport can detect only 46% of 2019-nCoV carriers and the others were found during the self-isolation period after immigration [29]. To suppress the disease spread, a wide range of laboratory tests for immigrants and general population seems to be necessary. However, the infection rate from asymptomatic carriers has not been clarified until now. The primary non-specific reported symptoms of 2019-nCoV infection at the prodromal phase are malaise, fever, and dry cough. The most commonly reported signs and symptoms are fever (98%), cough (76%), dyspnea (55%), and myalgia or fatigue (44%) [25, 26]. Unlike patients with other human coronavirus infections (such as SARS-CoV), upper respiratory tract and intestinal manifestations such as sore throat, rhinorrhea, and diarrhea in those with 2019-nCoV infection are infrequent [15, 25, 26] (Fig. 1).\n",

            "text": "New evidence suggests that 2019-nCoV may be transmitted directly from human to human via respiratory secretion containing droplets [44, 48]. Virus transmission through contact and fomites is also likely [44, 48]. To et al. [44] reported that using the viral culture method, they detected 2019-nCoV in infected individuals\u2019 saliva samples. In addition, 2019-nCov invades the cells through the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor in the same way as the SARS coronavirus [49]. Since 2019-nCoV effectively uses ACE2 receptor for cell invasion, it can promote human-to-human transmission [50]. ACE2+ cells are abundantly present all over the respiratory tract. ACE2+ epithelial cells present in the salivary glands were considered one of the main targets of SARS coronavirus infection. Similarly, 2019-nCoV may also use the same mechanism to induce infection, although definitive judgment regarding this issue needs further study [51].",
