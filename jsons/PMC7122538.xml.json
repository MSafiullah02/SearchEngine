The greatest havoc in the twentieth century was brought about by Spanish influenza, caused by the virus subtype A/H1N1/, which took place in the years 1918/1919. According to the latest data, it caused about 50 million deaths and large economic losses (WHO 2004). For this reason, the WHO launched an international influenza surveillance system in 1947. It served to observe changes in the structure of the influenza virus and to rapidly detect newly formed virus variants (\u017byci\u0144ska and Brydak 2007). In 2011, the network of surveillance has evolved to be coordinated by the WHO Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System (GISRS) (Bednarska et al. 2016a, b).",

Thanks to the reports it was possible to react quickly and focus on preventing the spread of the virus. A quick reaction was essential because according to the latest WHO estimates, 60% of infections caused by this subtype are fatal (Brydak 2014). In 2003, the National Center of Influenza in Rotterdam identified a different dangerous subtype of the HPAI determined as A/H7N7/ (Elbers et al. 2004), which reaffirms the notion of the influenza virus constantly undergoing modifications. In view of this unpredictability and the virus spread in the world, National Influenza Centers have been created in many countries. By 2008, 122 such centers were in operation throughout the world (Brydak 2008). Currently, there are 142 National Influenza Centers that act as reference centers in different countries. In Poland, this center is placed at the National Institute of Public Health-National Institute of Hygiene (NIPH-NIH). Apart from the GISRS, surveillance of influenza activity in Europe also is conducted by the European Influenza Surveillance Network (EISN), which is overseen by the European Center for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC). The EISN conducts both epidemiological and virological surveillance. Data on the situation in European countries are gathered in the platform of the European Surveillance System (TESS) that issues weekly reports assessing the current status of influenza spread in Europe (Bednarska et al. 2016a, b).",

Sentinel works in cooperation with general practitioners and 16 Voivodeship (province) Sanitary Epidemiological Stations (VSES) present. This enables a continuous observation of virological and epidemiological situation in the country (Romanowska and Brydak 2007). Family doctors, who make up at least 1% of all doctors, are obliged to collect clinical samples from patients and to report on the epidemiological situation in a given area (Wo\u017aniak-Kosek and Brydak 2013). The samples are then sent to the VSES where diagnostic tests are performed using biomolecular methods to confirm the presence of influenza and influenza-like viruses.",
