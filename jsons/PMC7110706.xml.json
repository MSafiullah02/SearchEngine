Four months later, MERS-CoV infection was also detected in an Omani citizen who had visited Thailand (Plipat et al., 2017). MERS-CoV has never been reported in Indonesia, although thousands of pilgrims have visited the Middle East every year. Despite extensive efforts to screen for MERS-CoV in 28 197 returning pilgrims in Indonesia in 2015, the study did not identify any positive cases (Amin et al., 2018).",

The coronavirus panel did not detect any MERS-CoV in any of the respiratory specimens, confirming the Indonesian Ministry of Health results. In this study, sequences of nine viral pathogens were detected in seven patients: four with single infections and three with multiple infections (Table 2\n). In patient ID MER004 072015, a co-infection of enterovirus and flavivirus was detected from nasal swab and serum, respectively. Nucleotide comparison of 357 nucleotides of the polyprotein gene using BLAST showed 99% similarity with enterovirus D68; for the flavivirus, 274 bases of the NS5 gene showed 98% similarity with dengue virus type 3. In patient ID MER002 092016, both herpesvirus and coronavirus were detected in the patient\u2019s oropharyngeal swab. Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) was identified based on sequence matching of 400 bp through the online database (NCBI).

Single infections with rhinovirus C, influenza virus H3N2, human metapneumovirus (HMPV), and influenza virus H1N1 were identified in the respiratory swabs of patients with ID MER001 092016, MER007 102015, MER006 102015, and MER010 092016, respectively.",

Age, pneumonia, and a history of travel to the Middle East are important markers of MERS-CoV (Mackay and Arden, 2015). Other factors increasing the risk of infection are male sex, contact with a camel or sick patient, diabetes mellitus, severe illness, low white blood cell count, low alanine aminotransferase, and high aspartate aminotransferase (Ahmed, 2017b). The coronavirus family panel used in this study has been validated to detect MERS-CoV (Anthony et al., 2017). However, no MERS-CoV was detected, which could be due to the small sample size. Although the severity of pneumonia of all suspected MERS-CoV patients was categorized as low risk based on the British Thoracic Society guidelines (Mackay and Arden, 2015), they would be categorized as severe pneumonia cases under the Korean guidelines, due to lung infiltrations on chest X-ray and the requirement for oxygen therapy (Park et al., 2018).",

She was 32 years old and presented with fever, cough, wheezing, and difficulty breathing. In adults, enterovirus D68 is rarely reported as a cause of severe illness. However, the virus has attracted international attention since it was associated with community-acquired pneumonia in children in China and Italy (Esposito et al., 2015, Bosis and Esposito, 2017, Zhang et al., 2015, Esposito et al., 2016). It is possible that the pneumonia in this case was due to the enterovirus D68 infection; further phylogenetic analysis is needed to compare this strain with other enterovirus D68. In 2014, a large outbreak of enterovirus D68 was confirmed in 49 states in the USA involving at least 1153 cases and 14 deaths. Recent reports have shown a possible association between enterovirus D68 and acute flaccid paralysis (Messacar et al., 2016, Dyda et al., 2018). However, no sign of neurological disorder was observed in this patient.",

With the exception of varicella zoster and human herpesvirus 6, human herpesviruses are rarely associated with pneumonitis (Duke and Sagar, 2018, Kuwahara-Ota et al., 2018). However, one case study reported a lower respiratory tract infection caused by HSV-1 in a 72-year-old man with underlying disease (Luginbuehl et al., 2017). HSV-1 is very infectious and highly prevalent in the world, with more than 60% of the population exposed to this virus in 2012 (Looker et al., 2015). It usually causes orolabial ulcers that can lead to neurotrophic complications with lifelong potential for symptomatic or asymptomatic viral shedding episodes (Looker et al., 2015, Kaufman et al., 2005). HCoV-229E is one type of coronavirus commonly infecting humans. An epidemiological study conducted in adults with community-acquired pneumonia confirmed that four human coronaviruses (HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL-63, HCoV-HKU1, and HCoV-OC43) accounted for 0.6\u20132.5% of pneumonia cases (Yin and Wunderink, 2018).

There is controversy regarding the clinical severity of rhinovirus C infection (Choi et al., 2015, Arden et al., 2010). The virus can induce diverse clinical outcomes, with factors including species and type-specific differences as determinants of severity (Yin and Wunderink, 2018, Choi et al., 2015, Arden et al., 2010, Annamalay et al., 2016). Globally, rhinovirus C has been linked to lower respiratory tract infections such as bronchitis, bronchiolitis, and pneumonia, especially when there is co-infection with other viruses, such as bocavirus and influenza virus (Langelier et al., 2017). In Indonesia, data on rhinovirus C are limited, with only one report related to myocarditis (Wiyatno et al., 2018).",

Influenza virus H1N1 is known to cause a serious infection that can lead to the development of pneumonia and death if it progresses to acute respiratory distress syndrome. In the present study, HMPV was detected from a nasal swab of a 71-year-old patient with pneumonia. HMPV is one of the most significant causes of upper and lower respiratory tract infections in children and the elderly, especially the immunocompromised and those with underlying respiratory conditions (Oong et al., 2018, Taniguchi et al., 2019, Jallow et al., 2019). Two genotypes of HMPV have been identified, which can be classified into five lineages, A1, A2a, A2b, B1, and B2. However, their association with disease severity remains unclear (Kumar and Srivastava, 2018). There is only a single report on HMPV from Indonesia, documenting the association of HMPV lineage A1 and A2 with asthma exacerbations and pneumonia, indicating that HMPV should be screened in those with chronic and severe respiratory infections (Prasetyo et al., 2015).",
