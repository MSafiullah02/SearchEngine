These viruses can grow in a wide range of hosts, and some can reach extremely high titers. As with animal RNA viruses, they use a variety of strategies for gene expression, including the use of subgenomic promoters and polyprotein processing. The availability of infectious cDNA clones was prerequisite for the development of RNA virus\u2013based vectors. Since their advent, members of several virus families have been developed as useful vectors (\nFig. 59.1\n). Initial attempts at vector construction were based on gene replacement strategies in which a sequence encoding a non-essential viral function was replaced by a gene of interest. Though several of these early constructs could replicate in isolated plant cells, they generally could not systemically infect whole plants. A more successful approach has been the development of vectors based on gene addition. In these a foreign sequence is added to the complement of viral genes, rather than substituting for one. For reviews of the development of RNA virus-based vectors the reader is referred to Scholtof et al. (1996), and Porta and Lomonossoff (1998, 2002).",

            "text": "Two basic types of systems have been developed for the production of immunogenic peptides and proteins in plants. The first type, often termed epitope presentation, involves inserting a sequence encoding an antigenic peptide into the viral coat protein gene in such a manner that the peptide is expressed on the surface of assembled virus particles. The modified virions are often referred to as chimeras or chimeric virus particles. Such particles are attractive as potential novel vaccines, since the presentation of multiple copies of an antigenic peptide on the surface of a macromolecular assembly can significantly increase its immunogenicity (Lomonossoff and Johnson, 1996). With these systems it is generally anticipated that the modified particles will be at least partially purified prior to administration to animals. The second type, often referred to as polypeptide expression, involves introducing a whole gene into the viral genome in such a manner that it is efficiently expressed in infected cells, usually as an unfused polypeptide. Though purification of the expressed protein may be necessary or desirable, this type of system could be suitable for the production of immunogens that can be supplied orally by direct feeding of plant material to animals.",

            "text": "Cowpea mosaic virus (CPMV) was the first plant virus to be developed as an epitope presentation system (Usha et al., 1993; Porta et al., 1994, 1996). CPMV is a bipartite RNA virus (Fig. 59.1), with particles containing 60 copies each of a large (L; 37 kDa) and a small (S; 23 kDa) CP arranged with icosahedral symmetry (\nFig. 59.2\n). The virus was an attractive candidate for development as an epitope presentation system because it grows to high titers and the detailed three-dimensional structure of the coat protein was known. This enabled a rational choice to be made regarding potential insertion sites (Lomonossoff and Johnson, 1995). Since the original reports describing the construction of chimeric virus particles, a large variety of epitopes have been expressed on the surface of CPMV particles (for examples, see Lomonossoff and Hamilton, 1999, and Porta et al., 2003). In most cases, the foreign sequence has been inserted into the most exposed loop of the virus surface, the \u03b2B-\u03b2C loop of the S protein (Fig. 59.2). However, other sites, such as the \u03b2E-\u03b1B loop of the L protein and the \u03b2C\u2032-\u03b2C\u2033 loop of the S protein, have also been used successfully (Brennan et al., 1999a; Taylor et al., 2000; Chatterji et al., 2002; Porta et al., 2003). Generally, provided the inserted peptide is less than 40 amino acids and has a pI below 9.0 (Porta et al., 2003), the yields of modified particles are similar to those obtained with wild-type CPMV (up to 1 mg of particles per gram of infected leaf tissue). In each case, the chimeric virus particles present 60 copies of the inserted peptide on the virus surface, though preliminary experiments indicate that it will be possible to utilize more than one insertion site simultaneously. Where appropriate antisera are available, detection of the inserted epitope on the modified coat protein subunits has proven to be straightforward (Usha et al., 1993; Porta et al., 1994, 1996).",

The modified particles proved capable of inducing specific antibodies against the insert when supplied parenterally to rabbits (Porta et al., 1994). However, due to the nature of the expressed sequence, the antisera were nonneutralizing. Nonetheless, CPMV chimeras expressing this site have proven valuable in assessing the effect of mode of presentation of epitopes on their immunological structure. In particular, it allowed the effect of the proteolytic cleavage that occurs at or near the carboxy-terminus of the inserted sequence to be investigated (Lin et al., 1996; Taylor et al., 1999, 2000).",

Initial analysis of the immunogenicity of this chimera focused on the parenteral administration of purified particles to mice in the presence of alum adjuvant (McLain et al., 1995). Sera obtained after boosting gave a strong ELISA response against the gp41 peptide. At a 1:100 dilution, antisera from all of the mice were found to be neutralizing against three strains of HIV-1, IIIB, RF, and SF2 (McLain et al., 1995; 1996a). Further studies showed that neutralizing antibody production elicited by CPMV-HIV/1 did not have a narrow genetic restriction (McLain et al., 1996b). An investigation into the effectiveness of five adjuvants at enhancing the immune response to CPMV-HIV/1 in mice showed that Quil A was the most effective of those tested (McInerney et al., 1999). It was also the only one to stimulate an in vitro proliferative T-cell response. An additional, potentially significant finding from these experiments was that mice receiving chimeric particles in the absence of any adjuvant were also able to mount a secondary immune response. This indicates that the particles themselves can present antigens effectively to the immune system and may obviate the need to use adjuvants for at least some applications.",

The differential response of the ELISA and neutralizing antibody titers provided the first indication that mice make HIV-1-specific antibodies to two distinct epitopes present in the gp41 peptide, one neutralizing and one nonneutralizing. The presence of two such epitopes has subsequently been demonstrated (Buratti et al., 1998). The nonneutralizing epitope is antigenically dominant, and deletion of this epitope results in a stronger neutralizing antibody response (Cleveland et al., 2000a). The dissection of the \u201cKennedy epitope\u201d through the use of CPMV-based chimeras has made a significant contribution to our understanding of the topology of gp41 from HIV-1 (Cleveland et al., 2000b).",

This study involved a CPMV chimera (CPMV-PARVO1) that contained a 17\u2013amino acid epitope from the N-terminal region of the VP2 capsid protein of canine parvovirus (CPV). This peptide is also found in VP2 of related parvoviruses, mink enteritis virus (MEV), and feline panleukopenia virus (FPV). CPMV-PARVO1 was administered subcutaneously to mink as a single dose of 100 \u03bcg or 1 mg with use of an alum/Quil A adjuvant, and 4 weeks' postvaccination the animals were challenged with MEV. Protection was afforded by either dose, and shedding of MEV was almost completely eliminated with the 1-mg dose. Subsequently, an ultraviolet light-inactivated form of CPMV-PARVO1 was shown to be capable of protecting dogs against a lethal challenge with CPV (Langeveld et al., 2001). As in the case of the mink experiments, the chimera was mixed with an alum/Quil A adjuvant prior to inoculation, and a comparatively high dose (7.5 mg of purified particles per animal) was used. The levels of antibody response, protection, and virus shedding were similar to those obtained with the CPV peptide linked to keyhole limpet hemocyanin.",

The first example of the presentation of foreign peptides on the TMV coat protein was reported in 1986 (Haynes et al., 1986). However, in this case the modified coat protein bearing an eight\u2013amino acid poliovirus epitope at its C-terminus was expressed in Escherichia coli rather than in plants. The production of modified TMV particles in plants was first attempted in 1990 (Takamatsu et al., 1990). In these experiments, a sequence encoding Leu-enkephalin was fused to the C-terminus of the viral coat protein. However, the modified coat protein was not competent for virion assembly. This highlighted a problem with using TMV particles to express foreign peptides. The fact that TMV particles contain a large number of subunits, making the system potentially very attractive for peptide expression, is also a problem in that the subunits are very tightly packed, allowing little space on the virus surface for the expression of foreign sequences (Fig. 59.2).",

This was achieved by engineering a leaky termination codon at the C-terminus of the coat protein gene. This system produced particles in plants in which up to 5% of the coat protein subunits were modified at their C-termini and has been used to express epitopes from several animal pathogens (Sugiyama et al., 1995; Turpen et al., 1995). As with CPMV-based chimeras, the inserted peptides could be detected on the surface of assembled virions. Subsequently, by modifying the site of peptide insertion, TMV-based systems were developed in which all the coat protein subunits could be modified to express foreign peptides without abolishing virus viability (Turpen et al., 1995; Fitchen et al., 1995; Beachy et al., 1996). As a result, most TMV-based chimeras now contain inserts between amino acids 154 and 155, near but not at the C-terminus of the coat protein (Fig. 59.2). The size of inserts that can be tolerated even at this optimized position seems to be quite small, the largest reported to date being 23 amino acids in a chimera that grew substantially more slowly than wild-type TMV (Bendahmane et al., 1999).",

In this system, an appropriately modified version of the AlMV coat protein is expressed from an additional copy of the TMV coat protein subgenomic promoter. Using this approach, a 40\u2013amino acid sequence containing epitopes from the glycoprotein and nucleoprotein of rabies virus and a 47\u2013amino acid sequence from gp120 from HIV-1 were fused to the AlMV coat protein and the fusion protein expressed in Nicotiana benthamiana. In infected leaf tissue, the modified AlMV CP subunits assembled into ellipsoid particles that expressed multiple copies of the antigenic insert. When purified and injected into mice, these particles elicited the production of appropriate virus-neutralizing antibodies, even in the absence of adjuvant. Particles expressing the rabies virus epitopes were subsequently shown to protect mice against a normally lethal challenge with the virus when supplied either intraperitoneally or orally (Modelska et al., 1998; Table 59.1).",

Though a detailed structure of PPV coat protein was not available, immunological analyses of related viruses suggested that both the N- and C-termini are surface-exposed. Furthermore, it had been shown that it was possible to fuse foreign sequences to the N-terminus of the coat protein of Johnsongrass mosaic virus (JGMV), a member of the same genus as PPV, without abolishing the ability of the coat protein molecules to assemble into viruslike particles in heterologous systems (Jagadish et al., 1993). Making use of this information, one group fused a 15\u2013amino acid epitope, equivalent to that used by Dalsgaard et al. (1997), from VP2 of CPV to a position near the N-terminus of the PPV coat protein, either as a single copy or as a tandem duplication (Fernandez-Fernandez et al., 1998). Both constructs could be propagated in N. clevelandii and gave yields of virus particles similar to those obtained with wild-type PPV, and the inserted epitope could be detected on the virion surface. Antisera produced in either mice or rabbits with specificity for particles of either construct showed neutralizing activity in a monolayer-protection assay. The site of expression of peptides on the PPV coat protein has subsequently been refined (Fernandez-Fernandez et al., 2002), raising the prospect that PPV may have general utility as an epitopepresentation system.",

The sequence was a C-terminally extended version of the 30\u2013amino acid sequence from the epitope expressed on CPMV (see section on Immunogenicity of CPMV Chimeras). In the resulting chimeric particles it was estimated that about 10% of the subunits carried the inserted sequence. Though some of the details varied, the immunogenicity of the PVX construct was generally similar to that of the equivalent CPMV one. Using a related approach, one group expressed a highly conserved hexapeptide epitope from gp41 of HIV-1 on all the PVX subunits (Marusic et al., 2001). Mice immunized either intraperitoneally or nasally with the chimeric particles produced high levels of HIV-1-specific IgG and IgA antibodies.

One group (Wigdorovitz et al., 1999) expressed VP1 from FMDV in N. benthamiana using the vector developed by others (Donson et al., 1991). This group detected significant quantities (50\u2013150 \u03bcg per gram of leaf, fresh weight) of VP1 in leaves and used leaf extracts to inoculate mice intraperitoneally in the presence of Freund's complete adjuvant. All mice immunized in this manner developed significant antibody titers directed to a VP1 epitope. When challenged with FMDV, all immunized mice were protected in two separate experiments (Table 59.1). This was the first example in which a whole protein, rather than a peptide fusion, expressed in plants using a viral vector was shown to be capable of conferring protective immunity. Another group expressed a major birch pollen antigen (Betv1) in N. benthamiana and showed that the B-cell epitopes from natural Betv1 were preserved in the plant-expressed protein (Krebitz et al., 2000). Mice immunized with crude leaf extracts from N. benthamiana expressing Betv1 generated immunological responses comparable to those induced by the protein expressed in E. coli or extracted from birch pollen.",

The first uses duplicated subgenomic promoters (Chapman et al., 1992) and is similar to that developed with TMV (see discussion on TMV in section on Polypeptide Expression Systems; Fig. 59.1). Such vectors have proven very useful in expression studies with a number of proteins such as ScFv antibodies (Hendy et al., 1999; Franconi et al., 1999; Ziegler et al., 2000). In terms of immunogens, there are only two examples. One group expressed the major capsid protein, VP6, from a murine rotavirus and showed that although the protein retained its ability to form trimers, it tended to assemble into paracrystalline sheets and tubes rather than viruslike particles (VLPs) (O'Brien et al., 2000). Another group used PVX to express the E7 protein human papillomavirus 16 (HPV-16), a virus implicated in the induction of cervical cancer, in N. benthamiana (Franconi et al., 2002). Mice immunized with foliar extracts containing the E7 protein in the presence of Quil A as an adjuvant developed both antibody and cell-mediated immune responses. The isotypic profile of the IgG antibodies indicated that both Th1 and Th2 responses were present, and 40% of mice remained tumor-free after challenge with an E7-expressing tumor cell line. The tumors that did develop in mice vaccinated with the plant-expressed E7 were considerably smaller in volume than those that developed in untreated mice (Table 59.1). The results obtained in this study were particularly significant, as previous attempts to produce large amounts of unfused E7 in other expression systems had been unsuccessful.",

The 2A sequence promotes cotranslational cleavage between the foreign gene insert and the CP, although this is not 100% efficient, resulting in some CP subunits still bearing the inserted protein. These fusion proteins were found to retain their ability to be incorporated into virus capsids, resulting in particles that display the inserted polypeptide. By means of this approach it is possible, with the use of the same construct, to produce a protein of interest in both a free (unfused) state where cleavage by 2A has occurred and as a CP fusion where it is incorporated in PVX particles. The functionality of a foreign protein when incorporated into virions was demonstrated by the observation that an ScFv expressed as a CP fusion could still bind to its antigen, the herbicide Diuron (Smolenska et al., 1998). When this system was used to express the rotavirus VP6 sequence, the uncleaved VP6-2A-CP assembled into PVX virions while the VP6-2A cleavage product formed typical VP6 VLPs (O'Brien et al., 2000).",

This is self-processed by proteinase domains within it to produce the mature viral proteins. To develop PPV as a polypeptide expression system, sequences encoding foreign proteins, initially marker genes, were inserted such that the free polypeptide would be released through the action of the VPg-proteinase (Fig. 59.1). This was achieved by flanking the inserted sequence with the appropriate proteinase recognition sites (Guo et al., 1998). Subsequently, a PPV vector in which the foreign sequence was inserted between the polymerase (Pol) and coat protein (CP) genes (Fig. 59.1) was used to express the VP60 structural protein from the calicivirus, rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus (RHDV) in N. clevelandii (Fernandez-Fernandez et al., 2001). Inoculation with a crude preparation from infected leaf tissue in the presence of adjuvant fully protected rabbits against subsequent challenge with a lethal dose of RHDV (Table 59.1). Taking into account the dose required to confer immunity and the time taken to grow the PPV-infected plants, Fernandez-Fernandez et al. (2001) estimated that 1 m2 of greenhouse space and 21 days would be sufficient to obtain enough material to protect 50 rabbits against RHDV.",

A refined version of the vector was subsequently produced in which the coat protein gene was replaced with a polylinker (Scholtof, 1999). This, coupled with improvements to the infection process, permitted the facile expression of heterologous sequences in the inoculated leaves of plants. The approach has been used to express the nucleocapsid protein p24 from HIV-1 as a fusion with the 5\u2032 terminal portion of the CP gene (Zhang et al., 2000). The modified TBSV RNA was capable of replicating in both protoplasts and in the inoculated leaves of whole plants. Accumulation of the CP-p24 fusion protein could be detected in inoculated leaves but, as yet, there has been no report concerning the immunological properties of the plant-expressed protein.",

All the mice immunized nasally produced anti-HIV IgA in feces as well as serum IgG antibodies. Oral immunization was considerably less effective, with only serum antibody being stimulated in a minority of mice. Similar results were obtained when mice were immunized nasally or orally with a CPMV chimera expressing a 30\u2013amino acid sequence from the S. aureus FnBP (Brennan et al., 1999d). Detailed characterization of the immune responses in mice immunized nasally with CPMV chimeras expressing epitopes from CPV provided further support to the idea that it will be possible to stimulate mucosal immunity by this route (Nicholas et al., 2002).",

When purified virus particles or crude extracts of CPSMV-infected cowpea leaves were used to immunize mice orally, anti-CPSMV IgG and IgA but not IgE antibodies were produced systemically (Florindo et al., 2002). Significantly, no antibodies were produced in response to the leaf proteins from either healthy or CPSMV-infected cowpeas, and no pathogenic effects were noted in any of the mice.

The immunogen was supplied to mice in three different ways: intraperitoneally, by gastric intubation, or by feeding on virus-infected leaves. The first two routes involved supplying purified virus particles, while the third used spinach leaves containing the recombinant protein. Though less effective in affording protection than the intraperitoneal route, both forms of oral administration stimulated IgG and IgA antibody synthesis and ameliorated symptoms of a subsequent challenge with an attenuated strain of rabies virus. In similar experiments, others compared the efficacy of purified particles of TMV chimeras expressing an epitope from the spike protein of MHV (see section on Immunogenicity of TMV Chimeras) when supplied to mice either subcutaneously in the presence of adjuvant or nasally (Koo et al., 1999). Nasal administration induced the production of epitope-specific IgG and IgA antibodies, while subcutaneous administration led to the production of only IgG antibodies. In both cases, mice were protected from subsequent challenge with MHV, and there appeared to be some correlation between the degree of protection obtained and the IgA antibody titers.",

These principally concern the genetic stability of the expressed sequences and the possibility of spread of the modified viruses in the environment. RNA viruses are particularly prone to the accumulation of mutations during multiple rounds of replication, as RNA-dependent RNA polymerases lack proofreading functions. It was anticipated that this could be a particular problem when expressing heterologous sequences, since their presence, far from conferring a selective advantage on the virus, tends to reduce the rate of virus replication. Thus, the inserted sequence tends to be subjected to both genetic drift and deletion. Indeed, when RNA viruses were first mooted as potential vectors, there was some debate as to whether they would be of any practical use for the expression of foreign proteins (van Vloten-Doting et al., 1985; Siegel, 1985). However, studies on the stability of both constructs containing either whole genes or expressing peptides indicate that these problems will be manageable, provided excessive passaging is not undertaken (Kearney et al., 1993, 1999; Porta et al., 1994).",

This could lead to the expression of immunologically active material in unwanted locations, and the presence of the foreign sequence could conceivably alter the host range and/or the transmissibility of the modified virus. Complete elimination of the ability of modified viruses to infect healthy host plants is clearly undesirable, as it is this property that makes viral vectors attractive in the first place. However, limitation of the ability to spread would be an advantage. At present this is most commonly achieved by growing infected plants under physically contained conditions, but this may not always be possible if large quantities of material are to be produced. In a pilot experiment to assess the potential spread of recombinant viruses in a field situation, adjacent rows of tobacco in a field were spray-inoculated with two different recombinant TMV constructs (Pogue et al., 2002). No cross-contamination between plants was found, despite the rows being only 18 inches apart. In addition, the fact that recombinants are at a disadvantage in terms of replication rate when compared with the wild-type virus leads to the deletion of the inserted sequence after multiple rounds of multiplication (Guo et al., 1998; Kearney et al., 1999; Rabindran and Dawson, 2001). This is likely to effectively prevent the widespread unwanted expression of foreign protein in the environment during propagation.",

Though there is no evidence that host range is determined directly by the sequence of the viral coat protein, transmission is known to be affected. Thus, it is conceivable that expression of a foreign peptide on the surface of virus particles may, by chance, change the ability of a virus to spread in the environment. To investigate this possibility, one group examined the host ranges and transmission characteristics of two CPMV chimeras, expressing epitopes from HRV-14 and HIV-1 (Porta et al., 2003). The host ranges of the chimeras were identical to that of wild-type CPMV, but they had a reduced ability to be transmitted by beetles, the natural insect vectors. Furthermore, the chimeras had not gained an ability to be transmitted by aphids or through seed. Though these experiments were inevitably somewhat limited in scope, they have provided further support to the idea that incorporation of foreign peptides on a virus surface if anything reduces the ability of the virus to spread in the environment.",

Particularly encouraging is the fact that it is now clear that peptides or proteins expressed in this manner can confer protective immunity against a number of diseases (Table 59.1), in some cases in the target animals (Dalsgaard et al., 1997; Langeveld et al., 2001; Fernandez-Fernandez et al., 2001). In most of these cases, immunity was stimulated by parenteral immunization, but there are encouraging signs that mucosal immunization may be possible (Modelska et al., 1998; Koo et al., 1999; Durrani et al., 1999). This raises the prospect that it may be possible to confer protective immunity by simply feeding with plant material infected with an appropriate virus construct. To achieve this, it will be necessary not only to express peptides or proteins that can stimulate mucosal immunity but also to express the material in edible plants. In this regard, the continued development of vectors that can infect edible plants such as those based on CPMV (Gopinath et al., 2000), clover yellow vein virus (ClYVV; Masuta et al., 2000), and pea early browning virus (PEBV; MacFarlane and Popovich, 2000), all of which infect legumes; wheat streak mosaic virus (WSMV; Choi et al., 2000), which infects cereals; and zucchini yellow mosaic virus (ZYMV; Arazi et al., 2001), which infects cucurbits, is likely to play a prominent role. In addition, the development of combined transgene/virus complementation systems, such as that described by others (Sanchez-Navarro et al., 2001; Mori et al., 2001), may allow the use of defective viral replicons for the expression of foreign sequences, thereby reducing the risk of environmental spread.",

One group reported the results of experiments on the large-scale growth and purification of a TMV chimera expressing a 12\u2013amino acid malarial peptide (Pogue et al., 2002). The results indicate that although growth under field conditions gives a lower yield per gram (fresh weight) of tissue than growth in a greenhouse or growth chamber, in excess of 1 kg per acre (planted area) of purified particles could be obtained. It was shown that large quantities (up to 10 mg per gram, fresh weight) of wild-type CPMV could be extracted from fresh or frozen cowpea leaves by methods suitable for large-scale application (Nichols et al., 2002). The development of methods for the industrial-scale production and/or purification of plant-derived vaccines will make an important contribution to the practical use of such material.",
