Some providers have routinely placed triple lumen catheters (TLC) 21 in the left IJ or subclavian vein so the right side can be used for hemodialysis catheters if needed. 22 An alternative is that both the TLC and dialysis catheter can be placed on the right side, with 23 5 spacing of the access sites in the neck. We have noted that many of our lines have thrombosed 1 shortly after line insertion when instilled with saline or low dose heparin. Thus, we have begun 2 to instill each port of the central line with heparinized saline (5000U/cc). ",

As of April 24, 2020, there are 869,172 COVID-19 cases in the 21 United States of which over 600,000 are in New York City. Mount Sinai Health System has one 22 of the largest consortiums of COVID-19 patients in New York City. To meet the demand of the 23 2 increasing numbers of hospitalized patients with COVID-19, many healthcare providers have 1 been placed in roles outside of their immediate level of training and are often treating a large 2 cohort of patients. In part, this has resulted in a sharp increase in the rate of central line 3 complications resulting in urgent vascular surgery consultation and intervention. 4The etiology for complications following central line insertion is likely multifactorial.",

These errors 8 following central line insertions will also result in increased exposure of the virus to frontline 9 healthcare workers from the work-up, imaging, and intervention needed to manage these 10 complications. 11 In response to this, we have created a line service team to assist with all central and 12 arterial line placements at Mount Sinai Hospital. However, the COVID-19 pandemic brings 13 important challenges and considerations to central line placements which are patient and 14 institution specific and will alter treatment algorithms. We discuss some of these considerations of the line service team should be tailored to the specific institution 19 depending on availability of staff and volume of access consults. Our line service team consists 20 of over 14 vascular surgeons, interventional radiologists, and 11 interventional cardiologists who 21 have extensive experience in ultrasound-guided vascular access. At our hospital, each shift has at 22 least two attendings and 1-2 nurse practitioners who all are in-house. Each shift is 12 hours and 23 the line service is available seven days a week. In order to contact the line team, there is a 1 centralized cell phone number that was distributed throughout the hospital. Currently, there are 2 approximately 5 -10 requests for line insertions per day at Mount Sinai Hospital which we expect 3 to significantly increase in the upcoming weeks. To date, all cases have been performed at 4 bedside, but a negative pressure room in a fluoroscopy suite is available for difficult line 5 insertions. The attending physician performs the procedure and a nurse practitioner is in the 6 patient room to assist with line placement. Under ultrasound guidance, the central line is inserted 7 in the usual fashion and secured with silk suture. Each port is instilled with heparinized saline 8 (5000u/cc) and a biopatch and sterile dressing are applied.",
