However, it is difficult to mathematically measure how widespread the information is, especially for a general network structure. There have been studies on opinion spreading, but many studies are limited to specific spreading models such as the susceptible-infected-recovered model and the independent cascade model, and it is difficult to apply these studies to various situations. In this paper, we first suggest a general opinion spreading model (GOSM) that generalizes a large class of popular spreading models. In this model, each node has one of several states, and the state changes through interaction with neighboring nodes at discrete time intervals. Next, we show that many GOSMs have a stable property that is a GOSM version of a uniform equicontinuity. Then, we provide an approximation method to approximate the expected spread size for stable GOSMs. For the approximation method, we propose a concentration theorem that guarantees that a generalized mean-field theorem calculates the expected spreading size within small error bounds for finite time steps for a slightly dense network structure. Furthermore, we prove that a \"single simulation\" of running the Monte Carlo simulation is sufficient to approximate the expected spreading size. We conduct experiments on both synthetic and real-world networks and show that our generalized approximation method well predicts the state density of the various models, especially in graphs with a large number of nodes. Experimental results show that the generalized mean-field approximation and a single Monte Carlo simulation converge as shown in the concentration theorem.",

            "text": "How political opinion, product adoption, rumors, trends, and viruses spread through a society has been of fundamental interest for many years and has been studied in a wide variety of research disciplines. In particular, accurately analyzing the spread size of information such as a virus in a human society is one of the growing concerns in diffusion problems. For example, recent epidemics, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), influenza A, and Ebola, show that viruses can easily spread on a global scale. Similarly, rumors and trends can also spread quickly and widely to alter human behavior. Furthermore, analyzing the spread size and density of information can be used to maximize the influence of the information. With the growing usage of online social networks (OSNs) and blog sites, predicting spread size to measure the influence of the information is taking on added significance. Many companies are now performing viral marketing on OSNs, and they rely on the word-of-mouth of adopters to influence other people to increase product sales. Since companies can only perform viral marketing with a limited advertising budget, predicting and evaluating the effectiveness of viral marketing strategies (in terms of number of final adopters) is of the utmost importance. * Also at Automation and Systems Research Institute (ASRI), Seoul National University; Corresponding author: kjung@snu.ac.kr For the study of information spread size approximation problems, there have been a number of works on building spreading models through mathematical assumptions about social network structures and how information spreads in social networks. In these models, a person is represented by a node, and a relationship between people is represented by a graph structure of the nodes. Information such as whether or not a person is an iPhone user or is infected by an epidemic are assigned on each node as a state. For example, in the epidemic model, each person (i.e., node) can be assigned one of three states: infected, not infected, or recovered.",

The susceptible-infectious-susceptible (SIS) model is one of the variations of the SIR model. In this setting, each infected (or activated) node attempts to infect its neighbors independently and succeed with a fixed probability or rate. The independent cascade model [7] is also one of the models that aims to explain the opinion spreading process and can be regarded as an SIR model. In the independent cascade model, every influenced node has a single chance to influence each of its uninfluenced neighbors. Recently, the Hawkes point process model was used to analyze user activities in social networks [8, 9] . It is known that the rate of events in an extended model is identical to the rate of new infections in the SIR model [10] .",

In the pairwise approximation, the approximation is performed through the probability of the state combination of two connected nodes to consider the dynamical correlation between neighbors [23, 24] .

Then we focus on GOSMs that have the stable property, which can be seen as a GOSM version of a uniform equicontinuity. In essence, we define a GOSM as stable when slight changes in the state density of a set of nodes do not cause a dramatic change in the state transition probability in the next step.

For both sets of parametric values, there is no significant difference between the true expected state density and the density predicted by generalized mean-field approximation. The error of generalized mean-field approximation is less than 0.1% for various experimental environments. Pairwise approximation also approximates the true expected state density with an error of less than 0.1% in most cases, similar to the generalized mean-field approximation. Therefore, generalized mean-field approximation method approximates the state density under various SIS model parameters and able to perform as good as the pairwise approximation. In addition, in some cases, error of generalized mean-field approximation is smaller than the pairwise approximation. If the infection probability \u03b2 is large, as shown in Fig. 3 , the error is drastically larger than in other cases. We believe that the reason for this phenomenon is because the experiment was conducted in a discrete environment. The pairwise approximation assumes a continuous time step, but larger \u03b2 represents that the experiment move away from continuous time step environment.",

Therefore, generalized mean-field approximation is very effective in predicting the expected state density in this experimental setting. In addition, these experiments show how the accuracy of the prediction obtained through one Monte Carlo simulation run depends on the size of the graph. Recall that Corollary 5 provides a lower bound on the probability such that we can predict the state density with a small error by running one Monte Carlo simulation. For a given T , the lower bound on this probability approaches 1 as the number of nodes in the graph becomes sufficiently large.

We prove that for a slightly dense network, our generalized mean-field approximation method can successfully compute the state density. Our approximation is applicable to all stable GOSMs, unlike the conventional mean-field approximation. Extensive experiments confirm that generalized mean-field approximation method indeed computes the state densities for the given nodes very well in practice. We have shown that a single Monte Carlo simulation run can also be used as a cost-efficient means of approximating the state density both theoretically and practically. Our results can be applied to various practical problems arising in social networks, including epidemic spreading analysis, the influence maximization problem [30] , and viral marketing [31] .
