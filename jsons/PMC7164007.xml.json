Early observations indicated that microbial communities influenced the development of the intestinal tract, including the stimulation of antibody production by potential beneficial bacteria, or probiotics 1. More recent studies have explored the complex, dynamic interactions and influences by external factors such as diet and environment on the gastrointestinal microbiota and its implications on health 2, 3. Some of the earliest studies also indicated that there were general patterns of succession which influenced how communities form and are altered via invasion of new members or destabilization (e.g., by antibiotics) 4, 5. We now know that the microbiota contributes to nutrient production and acquisition, as well as resistance to colonization by pathogens. Interestingly studies in germ\u2010free mice have demonstrated that the microbiota is required for normal physiological development of the organs such as the gut, lung, and brain 6. The gut microbiota drives the development of the mucosal immune system, including the initiation of secretion of immunoglobulins 7, the development of T\u2010cell populations 8, 9, and stimulating the production of antimicrobial peptides 10. The respiratory tract microbiota is less well studied, but it is believed that it also contributes to local immune education and the development of respiratory diseases, including asthma and allergy.",

From early infancy, the URT is colonized by several pathogens, including Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, and Haemophilus influenzae. These and other bacteria can also be referred to as \u2018pathobionts\u2019, which generally colonize the host asymptomatically, but have the potential to cause disease if they spread from the site of colonization 11. In fact, some pathobionts such as the Streptococcus anginosus group are believed to be the major cause of complicated lung infections such as pleural empyema 12, 13. The composition of the URT microbiota, including the presence of pathogens, changes rapidly during infancy, the process of which is called ecological succession. Ecological succession describes changes within the microbial community over time, which is influenced by both changing habitats (e.g., the developing human tissue) and exposure to new community members (i.e., colonizing bacteria). The progression of the URT microbiota has been shown to impact airway disease later in childhood 14. Understanding how microbial succession and colonization increases or reduces susceptibility to respiratory diseases such as asthma and allergy and how it promotes or prevents invasion by pathogens may inform novel interventions. This review describes the current understanding of how the URT microbiota influences health, infection, and inflammation.",

The distinction between MRSA and methicillin\u2010sensitive St. aureus (MSSA) is important, as those colonized by MRSA are at an increased risk for invasive disease. A study by Davis et al. demonstrated that upon hospital admission, 21% of patients were MSSA carriers, and 3.4% of patients carried MRSA 40; however, a much higher percentage of the MRSA carriers (19%) developed invasive staphylococcal disease than MSSA carriers (1.5%).

Recently, a more in\u2010depth culture\u2010based study of the nasal microbiota assessed four locations along the length of the nose: the anterior and posterior vestibules, and the middle and inferior meatus 44. In this study, 141 taxa, dominated by Staphylococcus, Corynebacterium, and Propionibacterium species were found in four different sites in 34 surgical patients. The majority of species were found in all regions of the nose, except Corynebacterium simulans, which was not present in the posterior vestibule, and Acinetobacter lwoffii, which was not present in the anterior vestibule and inferior meatus. There were distinct pairs of species that were generally cultured together. For example, Dolosigranulum pigrum was cultured in samples that had Corynebacterium propinquum and Staphylococcus epidermidis was cultured in samples that had Propionibacterium acnes. This suggests that these pairs have a mutualistic relationship that may promote colonization or facilitate survival within the URT. Although this study provided the most extensive culture\u2010based dataset on the composition of the URT microbiome, next\u2010generation sequencing on a subset of samples, identified 113 bacterial phylotypes that were not recovered by culture. This highlighted that the extensive culturing methods used did not identify all the bacteria as they were able to detect more bacterial groups via next\u2010generation sequencing 44. However, culture\u2010independent methods do not distinguish viable from non\u2010viable bacteria, and some of the \u2018uncultured\u2019 organisms may not be viable in the samples. Nonetheless, sequencing of the microbiota has become an important methodology for advanced bacterial composition assessment.",

This gene has nine variable regions (V1\u2013V9), differences in which allow for taxonomic identification of bacteria, which are classified as operational taxonomic units, or OTUs 45. In general, targeting one or more of these variable regions is sufficient to identify members of the microbiota at the genus level, however, the specific 16S variable regions used may vary due to tissue type or particular bacterial families present 46. While OTUs help quantitate the overall diversity of the microbiota, identification beyond the genera level can pose a significant challenge for determining exact community composition of the URT. As an example, the URT microbiota contains many members of the genus Streptococcus\n47. The high degree of 16S sequence similarity between this genus means that it is not possible to resolve the relative abundances of members of these genera 48, 49. Nonetheless, culture\u2010independent techniques have been extremely useful in characterizing the composition and diversity of the URT microbiota. Sequencing of swabs of the middle turbinate, nasopharynx or anterior nares for nasal microbiota, and tongue or buccal mucosa for oral cavity sampling have identified that Corynebacteriaceae, Staphylococcaceae, and Propionibacteriaceae dominate in nasal cavity of healthy adults, although there is considerable compositional variability between the individuals 50. The oral cavity in these healthy adults was dominated by Streptococcaceae and Veillonellaceae. The microbial communities from the three sampling sites were distinct from each other, signifying important local niches for colonization. Interestingly, a separate study determined that swabs are representative of invasive (surgical) sampling, suggesting that less invasive measures are adequate for nasal microbial study 51. A summary of the most commonly found bacteria in healthy individuals are presented in Table 1.",

Correlations between the method of delivery (i.e., vaginal or cesarean) and breastfeeding with susceptibility to respiratory infections, asthma and allergy have been observed for decades 52, 53, 54; it is now believed that this is due in part to the establishment of the URT microbiome. Recently, a study by Bosch et al. demonstrated that infants born via cesarean section were more likely to have reduced colonization levels of protective bacteria, including Corynebacterium and Dolosigranulum species 55. Breastfeeding improves infant health in part because it facilitates the transfer of maternal antibodies which are then found in the infant's nasal secretions 56, 57. A recent study established the role of exclusive breastfeeding versus exclusive formula feeding from 6 weeks of age up to an age of 6 months of life on the URT microbiota 58. Breastfed children had increased levels of Corynebacterium and Dolosigranulum species that may play an important role in protection against upper respiratory infections 14. Furthermore, it was noted at 6 weeks, but not 6 months of age, that there was a negative correlation between wheezing and the relative abundance of Dolosigranulum. Infants colonized by H. influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and S. pneumoniae within the first month of life were more likely to demonstrate wheezing, compared to those that were not colonized, but colonization status of these pathogens at 1 year of life did not correlate with wheezing 59. A prospective cohort study involving 234 children demonstrated that nasopharyngeal colonization by Streptococcus at ~ 2 months of age was a strong predictor for asthma later in life 60. This study also demonstrated that antibiotic use within 4 weeks of sampling increased the likelihood of colonization by Streptococcus, Haemophilus, and Moraxella\n60. The importance of the composition of colonizing bacteria in the first few months of life has been confirmed in mouse models of allergic asthma 61. Mice treated with antibiotics prior to weaning had more severe allergic asthma, but antibiotic treatment after weaning had no effect 61.",

A recent landmark study by Biesbroek et al. investigated the bacterial succession patterns in infants 14. The group followed a cohort of 60 infants over the first 2 years of life, sampling from 1.5 months of age to 24 months, and validated the findings with a cross\u2010sectional study of 140 children per age group. The relative bacterial load and \u03b1\u2010diversity did not change over time, however, the composition of the microbiota did change over time 14. At 1.5 months of age, five clusters were observed that were dominated by either Streptococcus, Moraxella, Staphylococcus, Corynebacterium, or Corynebacterium/Dolosigranulum. In the Streptococcus and Staphylococcus clusters, Corynebacterium and Dolosigranulum were found at very low abundance. As the infants progressed from 1.5 months to 24 months of age, those whose microbiota were dominated by Moraxella were likely to remain dominated by Moraxella, and infants who were colonized with Corynebacterium/Dolosigranulum were likely to become dominated by Moraxella. In contrast, microbial communities dominated by Streptococcus and Staphylococcus were not stable and would often have a completely different profile in subsequent samples, with no defined pattern 14. Interestingly, the Corynebacterium/Dolosigranulum cluster was highly correlated with breastfeeding. Furthermore, the children with a Corynebacterium\u2010 and/or Dolosigranulum\u2010dominated URT microbiota were less likely to have a URT infection compared with all other microbial profiles. This study demonstrated a repeatable pattern of ecological succession, and potentially identifies groups of infants that may be at risk for respiratory infections.",

In contrast, children were dominated by Moraxella, Haemophilus, Enterobacteriaceae, and Enterococcus. Targeted cultivation of these bacteria allowed for species identification, including Staphylococcus (St. epidermidis), Haemophilus (H. influenzae and Haemophilus parainfluenzae), D. pigrum, and Corynebacterium (C. durum and C. mucifaciens) 49.

A recent study demonstrated that macrophage recruitment to the URT during pneumococcal colonization was decreased in infant mice due to the inability to create a chemokine gradient within the nasal cavity 62. In this model, the neonatal microbiota contributed to the high baseline chemokine expression, as antibiotic treatment decreased baseline chemokine expression, which allowed for a chemokine gradient to form upon pneumococcal exposure.

As an example, in children, colonization by S. pneumoniae occurs frequently and is generally asymptomatic; however, when colonization is not appropriately controlled, dissemination from the nasopharynx may result in pneumonia, meningitis, or septicemia 64. In young adults, colonization is less frequent and of shorter duration due to adequate immune control, and consequently, disease is rare unless there are complicating comorbidities or influenza infection 65. The dynamics of carriage in the elderly are not as well studied; however, as in adults, carriage rates are low 66, 67. The combination of low colonization rates and high incidence of pneumonia implies that colonization is brief and proceeds swiftly to infection 64. In support of this, peaks of invasive pneumococcal disease in the elderly occur during Christmas holidays when contact with grandchildren, the major reservoir for S. pneumoniae, is presumed to occur 68. Furthermore, mouse models indicate during S. pneumoniae colonization the URT microbiota is profoundly distinct in aged mice, failing to return to a microbiota composition similar to prepneumococcal exposure, which younger mice were able to do 69, 70. Whether age\u2010related changes in the microbiota contribute to permissiveness to infection is not clear, although preliminary studies support this hypothesis.",

This suggests the structure of the microbial community may degrade during aging, which facilitates an expansion of streptococcal species. As an example, Shannon diversity increases in elderly patients suffering from pneumonia compared to healthy elderly people 63. The Shannon diversity Index is a metric which accounts for the abundance of different bacteria, with a low Shannon diversity suggesting the microbiota is dominated by a few bacterial species, whereas a high Shannon diversity suggests many different taxa of even relative abundance 71. Pneumonia patients had a distinct decrease in anaerobic bacteria, including Prevotella, and decreased lactic acid bacteria Leptotrichia, and an increased viral load. A human experimental pneumococcal carriage model has identified that increased Shannon diversity in the URT microbiota correlates with a colonization permissive phenotype 72. Mouse models of pneumonia have also implicated a role for dysbiosis, however, distinct microbial interactions that could be occurring have yet to be fully elucidated 69, 70.

These studies demonstrate that as S. pneumoniae carriage in the nasopharynx decreases, carriage rates of St. aureus increase 43. This is due in part to the bactericidal components produced by S. pneumoniae, such as hydrogen peroxide 65. Hydrogen peroxide production induces DNA damage in St. aureus which triggers the release of resident prophages, resulting in bacteriophage\u2010driven death of St. aureus\n108. Some strains of St. aureus produce catalase or carotenoids, such as staphyloxanthin, which reduce the damaging effects of peroxides and neutrophil killing 65, 109. These compensatory defense mechanisms and the fact that not all strains of St. aureus carry lysogenic phage, may explain why not all studies find an inverse relationship between St. aureus and S. pneumoniae. The immune status of the host also contributes to the apparent inverse relationship in carriage. Mouse models have shown that antibodies against S. pneumoniae dehydrogenase have cross\u2010specificity for St. aureus which blocks subsequent St. aureus colonization 110. Similarly, the reciprocal relationship between S. pneumoniae and St. aureus do not occur in HIV\u2010positive children, which carry equal levels of both pathogens simultaneously, which implies that a fully competent immune system influences carriage 111.",

Pathogens can survive and thrive in both the infant and elderly nasal and oral cavities, likely due to synergism between loss of colonization resistance and altered innate and adaptive immunity. Early colonization events, including birth route, breastfeeding, and exposure to other children influence the acquisition and succession of the URT microbiota, with Corynebacterium and Dolosigranulum species repeatedly demonstrated as protective profiles against disease 14. Future work establishing early colonization events through culture\u2010dependent and \u2010independent methods, will help in the prevention of acute and chronic airway diseases throughout the lifespan. Limited mechanistic studies have been completed to describe beneficial microbial colonization and interaction with the immune system in the URT. Recent work has identified that specific bacterial groups in the nasal cavity are associated with efficacy of vaccination against influenza, suggesting that nasal immunity may be regulated by the nasal microbiota 127. Exploring host\u2013bacterial interactions that have been uncovered in the gut, including adaptive immune development and pathogen clearance, could greatly decrease respiratory disease morbidity. Fecal transplants, which have been used to combat recurrent Clostridium difficile infections and diarrhea, have been identified to boost colonization resistance against the pathogen by altering the microbial community 128. Colonization resistance can be caused by limiting nutrients essential for pathogen growth, disrupting the niche required by the pathogen, or enhancing the immune response by the body. Taking advantage of colonization resistance is only beginning to be explored in the URT. Bacterial and viral pathogens of the URT require unique niches, thus various microbial communities may be required to resist different pathogens. Development of human and animal models that assess the intramicrobiota competition and host\u2013microbiota interactions are an exciting avenue in the development of targeted, URT\u2010specific probiotics.
