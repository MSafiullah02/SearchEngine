A limited tidal volume ventilation of 6 ml/kg is proven to be beneficial in ARDS [4]. However, application of limited tidal volume ventilation can often not be achieved in ARDS because of hypoxemia and acidosis [5, 6]. Also, application of relatively low plateau pressures and driving pressures can already be harmful [7, 8]. Thereby, mechanical ventilation may aggravate ARDS, the extent of which is affected by the intensity of ventilation. In ARDS, higher minute volumes are needed to compensate for increased oxygen demand and carbon dioxide production, increasing the risk of additional injury by mechanical ventilation. Therefore, in ARDS, adjunctive therapies which allow for less invasive ventilation are worth exploring.",

Thereby, mechanical ventilation using a gas mixture of oxygen and helium (heliox) can reduce turbulent gas flow and establish a more laminar flow [9]. This biochemical feature enables a reduction in the work of breathing in patients with obstructed airflow due to increased airway resistance during exacerbations of asthma and COPD [10]. Another important feature of heliox is the increased diffusion of CO2 compared to air [9]. Consequently, heliox decreases inspiratory pressures required to establish a set gas flow and to enable gas exchange in distant alveoli [11, 12].",

This study design was chosen to reduce confounders, influencing our results. With this design, we believe that any measured effect of heliox on lung injury could be ascribed to heliox only and not to a difference in tidal volumes. This distinction is important, because as a result of a more laminar flow pattern compared to oxygen-in-air ventilation, the mechanism by which heliox improves CO2 removal might be by an increased tidal volume delivery. In line with this, it was shown that during high-frequency oscillatory ventilation in an animal ARDS model, heliox did not alter gas exchange if tidal volume was kept constant [23]. If the findings would also be applicable during protective mechanical ventilation, based on the characteristics of heliox, we hypothesized a decrease in inspiratory pressures needed to generate a set tidal volume, as found before [12]. However, our effects on inspiratory and driving pressures, as well as the compliance, were only modest. Since we cannot exclude that heliox may be beneficial by allowing a further reduction of tidal volumes, which was shown before to increase protection in ARDS [24\u201326], the choice for strictly keeping tidal volumes at 6 ml/kg in these experiments limits the interpretation of our results.",
