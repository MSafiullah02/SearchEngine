Urine cotinine level measurement was elected over data acquired through parental questionnaires because the latter are relatively blunt instruments compared with cotinine. Indeed, smoking is frequently misreported, especially in areas with a high prevalence of female smokers, as is often the case in Mediterranean countries.19 Cotinine has a half-life of about 18 h in children20 and is currently considered the most accurate approach to estimate short-term SHS exposure.21 Since the duration of the study was rather short, major changes in parental smoking habits were not expected. So, even though measuring cotinine twice and taking the mean as the representative value in each child cannot describe the variability of SHS exposure, we believe that it provides a quite reliable estimate for the purposes of our study.",

Wiertsema et al.,15 in their study of healthy children with recurrent episodes of acute otitis media found many positive interactions among PIV, enterovirus, coronavirus, RSV, HBoV, and RV. Van den Bergh et al.14 performed a study in a group of six to 24 month-old healthy children and found that RV was positively associated with enteroviruses, and negatively with coronaviruses. They also showed that enteroviruses were positively associated with HBoV, WU polyomavirus, PIV, and human parechovirus. However, the above two studies were cross-sectional and as such could not depict the dynamics of the described relations over time. To the best of our knowledge, the only study that investigated the probability of coexistence of microorganisms in the URT of asymptomatic children using a longitudinal approach is the one performed by Jacoby et al.11 who reported a positive correlation between ADV and RV. Our analysis resulted in the same conclusion, and we additionally found a similar association between INFL and RSV. Although our results may imply facilitation of the carrier stage between these two pairs of viruses, they cannot support or refute whether this phenomenon may assist subsequent infections, or constitutes a part of a procedure that aims to maintain equilibrium between microorganisms existing in carrier stage in the nasopharynx.",

This suggests that co-existence of viruses in the form of carrier stage is not simply related to fixed interactions between viruses. Most probably, the process is influenced by a series of factors, including those related to differences in epidemiological conditions, local microbiome dynamics, and host characteristics.9 The longitudinal approach used herein, may have accounted for the differences at the host level, such as socioeconomic and environmental factors (crowding, presence of siblings in the household, etc.), genetics, and immune maturation status.",

Such information may have facilitated the interpretation of our results and provided more clear evidence regarding the persistence of viral shedding in healthy children. Another drawback arises from the absence of strict and objective criteria for defining asymptomatic state. Although samples were collected when children were generally well, we cannot exclude the possibility of them being in the viral shedding phase of a recent infection or having an active infection presenting only with mild nasal congestion.",

The possibility of statistical type I error, and coincidental factors that may have affected the results, cannot be excluded. Viral communities of the URT are inherently complex and probably include more viruses than we were able to look for, as well as abundant bacterial species that may interfere with the viruses.27 Despite those drawbacks our data provide evidence that specific interactions between viruses of URT in asymptomatic carriers may actually exist, and support previous studies postulating similar results. The true pathophysiological role of these interactions remains elusive and certainly more rigorous research is needed in order to corroborate our findings and fill in the gaps of knowledge concerning the clinical importance of this issue.",
