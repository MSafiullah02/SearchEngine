These signs were quickly followed by a profuse, foul-smelling, bright green watery diarrhea with a high mucus content, and dehydration. During the more chronic stages of the disease, feces of affected ferrets commonly contained grainy material described as resembling birdseed. Based on the clinical presentation, the disease was commonly referred to as green slime disease. After a detailed review of the gross and microscopic lesions and the discovery of an enteric coronavirus within affected intestines, the name epizootic catarrhal enteritis was introduced.5\n",

These gastrointestinal signs may lead to loss of body condition and moderate to severe emaciation. Signs of central nervous system disease include hind limb paresis or paraparesis, ataxia, tremors, and seizures. Animals may present with primary neurologic disease, including head tilt and seizure activity. Less common clinical signs include sneezing, coughing, labored breathing, nasal discharge, dehydration, bruxism, systolic heart murmur, jaundice, focal areas of erythema of the skin, green colored urine, reddened rectal mucosa, and rectal prolapse.7, 14 Ocular signs have not yet been reported. On abdominal palpation, large abdominal masses, splenomegaly, and renomegaly are common findings.

Pentoxifylline is a methylxanthine derivative with hemorrheologic, immunomodulatory, and anti-inflammatory effects.34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42 Pentoxifylline is a nonspecific phosphodiesterase inhibitor.34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39 Phosphodiesterase inhibition will increase cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), which increases red blood cell deformability, decreases red blood cell destruction, and improves microcirculation and tissue oxygenation. In addition, increasing cAMP decreases platelet aggregation and blood viscosity.34, 42 Furthermore, pentoxifylline also inhibits TNF-\u03b1 synthesis and lowers IL-1 levels.34, 35, 36, 39, 40, 41 Plus pentoxifylline can decrease fibrosis.34, 36 Pentoxifylline has been used to treat feline FIP by some veterinarians with anecdotal improvement, but no studies have been published yet.19, 25 A suggested dose for pentoxifylline in cats is 20 to 25 mg/kg twice daily (Alice Wolf, DVM, personal communication, 2008).",

Unfortunately, FRECV is assumed to be ubiquitous in most multiple-ferret homes, shelters, and breeding farms.5 Nonetheless, reducing fecal contamination of the environment through disinfecting the litter boxes, cages, and bowls with sodium hypochlorite (bleach) weekly, keeping litter boxes away from food and water bowls, and vacuuming up litter around litter boxes and in the ferret room at least once a week may help.26 For breeders, isolation and early weaning of the kits may help prevent exposure.",
