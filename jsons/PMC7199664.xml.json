            "text": "Recent research has confirmed that porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) can be transmitted by swine feed and ingredients (Dee et al., 2014, 2015; Schumacher et al., 2015). In a review by Nitikanchana (2014), a theoretical temperature \u00b7 time relationship was proposed to reduce the infectivity of PEDV in complete feeds based on data extrapolated from PEDV environmental survival studies (Pospischil et al., 2002; Thomas et al., 2015). Typical swine feed pellet mill conditioner retention times and temperatures encompass the theoretical temperature \u00b7 time relationship proposed. Although Goyal (2013) corroborated this relationship using benchtop measures, there is no research confirming this time \u00b7 temperature relationship using a conditioner and pellet mill that are present in modern feed manufacturing facilities. Although it would be uncommon to set target pellet mill conditioning temperatures below 68\u00b0C, it is possible that feed may be produced below these limits during start up of the pellet mill or during a pellet mill plug. If feed begins to plug in the pellet mill die, the initial attempt to resolve the plug is to turn off steam to the conditioner. This can lead to significant quantities of pelleted feed not reaching the target conditioning temperature. If PEDV particles were in the feed, the resulting feed conditioned at a lower temperature may still have infectious PEDV particles that may potentially contaminate the pellet cooler, after-pellet feed handling equipment, trucks, feed lines, and feeders at the farm. Therefore, we hypothesize that PEDV dose and pelleting parameters will reduce PEDV quantity and infectivity.",

Prior to pelleting the first treatment, noninoculated feed was processed until the exit temperature of the feed was stable at the target temperature. To help reduce cross-contamination, the low-dose batches were pelleted prior to the high-dose batches. During thermal processing, within each dose, the treatment with the lowest temperature and longest retention time was pelleted first. The temperature was then held constant until the other 2 retention times were achieved, and samples were collected. This process was then repeated at the 2 higher temperatures. The temperature for each treatment was measured at the discharge from the conditioner to the pellet die feeder screw. Once the low-dose treatments were completed, the same procedure was used to pellet the high-dose treatments. For each temperature, time, and dose combinations, 3 pelleted samples were collected for qRT-PCR and bioassay analysis. In addition, between each inoculated batch, a minimum of 5 kg of virus-free feed was processed through the pellet mill. This was done to prevent virus carryover between treatments and to stabilize the conditioning temperature to ensure the contaminated feed was processed under uniform temperature conditions.",

The pellet mill was heated to 71\u00b0C for 60 min to have the entire pellet mill reach optimum temperature. The temperature was again measured by a thermometer at the discharge from the conditioner to the pellet die feeder screw. At 60 min, the steam valve was then turned off until the conditioning temperature dropped below 37\u00b0C to mimic procedures commonly used to resolve a plug in the conditioner or pellet die. Next, PEDV-inoculated feed was placed into the pellet mill hopper. Once PEDV-inoculated feed started passing through the pellet mill, steam was slowly added, and 5 pelleted samples were collected at targeted hot mash conditioner temperatures of 37, 46, 54, 62, and 71\u00b0C (\u00b11.2\u00b0C) using a 30-s conditioning time. These conditioning temperatures were selected based on a previously determined prediction equation for the specific pellet mill.",

From these time \u00b7 temperature combinations, only the 71\u00b0C for 10 min and 20\u00b0C for 7 d led to bioassay-negative pigs (Thomas et al., 2015). However, all of the other treatments led to infection in pigs (Thomas et al., 2015). When comparing the temperatures used to those in the present study, the first issue that arises is that the 54\u00b0C treatments differed in the bioassay results. In this study, all pigs were bioassay negative when feed was treated at 54\u00b0C. This could be due to the nature of the pellet mill as steam is directly added to the feed and then the feed is forced through a pellet die. As the feed is forced through the die, it could also undergo frictional heat from being pushed through the small diameter holes. However, in both trials in which 71\u00b0C was reached, it led to a PEDV-negative bioassay regardless of the treatment time.",

This process uses high temperatures throughout the manufacturing process, which makes it an option to test against PEDV. In a study by Gerber et al. (2014), inlet temperatures of 166\u00b0C and outlet temperature of 80\u00b0C were used and these conditions led to the inactivation of infectious PEDV (Goyal, 2014). In a separate study, bovine plasma was subjected to the spray drying process in which the inlet temperature was 200\u00b0C and either 70 or 80\u00b0C throughout the outlet (Pujols and Segal\u00e9s, 2014). The bovine plasma subjected to spray drying was not infectious after the process (Pujols and Segal\u00e9s, 2014). However, after the spray drying process, the plasma was reinoculated with PEDV and subjected to storage times of 7, 14, or 21 d and temperatures of 4, 12, or 22\u00b0C (Pujols and Segal\u00e9s, 2014). The virus was not infectious at any of the time points at 22\u00b0C but was infectious in 1 out of 5 samples in 12\u00b0C at 7 d and 4 out of 5 samples in 4\u00b0C at 7 d (Pujols and Segal\u00e9s, 2014). The initial high temperatures, which were greater than those used in this study, led to the inactivation of the virus; however, the low storage temperatures of 4 and 12\u00b0C did not inactivate the virus. This is extremely important to note because manufacturing equipment requires start up time and in some instances, as shown in the present study, the heat source is turned off to clear lodged material. This, in turn, could potentially lead to contamination of material later in processing and transportation. From this study, it was deemed that a temperature of 54.4\u00b0C or higher is required inactivate PEDV in complete feed when using a pellet mill and placing the feed into a swine bioassay. It is important to point out a few limitations of the 2 studies. The first is that the studies were performed on a pilot-size pellet mill. Every pellet mill will operate differently depending on the size, steam addition, time, and material flowing through the process. The second issue is the heating and cooling time of pellets. For this study, pellets were immediately placed on ice to cool them. If a pellet mill cooler would have been used, the cooling time would have been longer, in which case the pellets would have maintained their internal heat for a longer time period. The third limitation is the use of a bioassay. Currently, a bioassay is the best diagnostic method to measure infectivity. However, as explained by Davies (2015), the risk of an individual pig becoming infected is very low but carries a high collective risk. In the bioassay, pigs received only 10 mL of a sample compared with their normal feed consumptions. If larger amounts of the pelleted feed were given to the pigs, then the likelihood of infection would have increased in the study. However, research generated using the same feed and pig bioassay model has led to infection within the animals (Schumacher et al., 2015; Cochrane et al., 2016). Because of the issues associated with this study, further research needs to be performed on a larger scale looking at the use of different pellet mills and pellet cooling times.",
