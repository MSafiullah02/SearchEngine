Dysoxia is lack of oxygen supply to, or use by, the cells, limiting energy production.1 Poor perfusion and diminished oxygen delivery to the tissues with resulting signs of pallor, tachycardia, tachypnea, and altered pulse quality is another way to describe shock.2.Oxygen delivery (Do\n2) is the amount of oxygen delivered to tissues as determined by cardiac output and oxygen carrying capacity.2 It is described best by the equation CO \u00d7 Cao\n2, in which CO is cardiac output (the heart rate multiplied by stroke volume) and Ca\no\n2 is the oxygen carrying capacity of arterial blood, which is determined by the saturation of oxygen bound to hemoglobin, the amount of hemoglobin, and the small amount of dissolved oxygen in the serum (Fig. 1\n).3.Oxygen consumption (Vo\n2) is the amount of oxygen used by the tissues after being delivered and off-loaded from hemoglobin.3 It can be determined by using the equation CO \u00d7 (Ca\no\n2 \u2013 Cv\no\n2) which is cardiac output multiplied by the difference between arterial oxygen content (Ca\no\n2) and venous oxygen content (Cv\no\n2).4.Systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) is a condition characterized by changes in heart rate, body temperature, and respiration rate with either leukocytosis or leukopenia.4 SIRS can be caused by trauma; organ inflammation, such as pancreatitis; infection; and environmental stressors, like heat stroke.5 Criteria for SIRS have been described for humans and extrapolated for small animal veterinary medicine.6 SIRS has been described experimentally using similar criteria in rabbits7 and in rodents.8 SIRS in reptiles, amphibians, and other exotic species has not been characterized to the author\u2019s knowledge.5.Sepsis is defined as SIRS secondary to infection. An infection is a pathologic process caused by the invasion of microorganisms that cause disease of normally sterile tissue or fluid.9 The term has been used since Hippocrates\u2019 time to describe putrefaction and decomposition.10 Many clinicians use terminology such as sepsis syndrome, bacteremia, and SIRS interchangeably with sepsis. Note that SIRS can occur without infection.6.Multiple organ dysfunction syndrome is a condition whereby disease, injury, lack of perfusion, and so forth cause at least 1 vital organ (heart, lung, kidney, nervous system) to no longer function normally. Failure of multiple organs (>1) is multiple organ failure (MOF).11\n\n",

Reptiles, depending on the species, balance oxygen delivery during exercise differently. Iguanas maintain Do\n2 primarily by increasing heart rate because stroke volume decreases by 20% from a resting state during exercise. However, Varanus spp such as monitor lizards increase stroke volume and heart rate to normalize oxygen delivery during exercise.22 Reptiles also tend to have lower oxygen saturation of arterial blood. Most reptiles have Sao\n2 of 70% to 90%, with turtles at the higher end of the range and lizards at the lower end.23 Reptiles differ from birds and mammals in their higher reliance on anaerobic metabolism, which can make evaluation of the importance of oxygenation and perfusion more challenging. Another feature that affects reptile oxygen dynamics is blood shunting. Reptilian hearts (other than those of the Crocodylia) have an incomplete interventricular septum. In these animals, both left-to-right shunting and right-to-left shunting can occur. With intracardiac left-to-right shunting, areas of the myocardium that are normally oxygen poor receive more oxygen.24 Reduction of right-to-left shunting of deoxygenated blood leads to an increase in oxygen carrying capacity. It is thought that alteration of the shunt fraction is controlled by changes in physiologic conditions. This change, along with a right-shift to the oxygen dissociation curve, maintains oxygen delivery in reptiles that have been studied.25 Studies in turtles have shown right-to-left shunting facilitates warming while left-to-right shunting improves systemic oxygen transport. Left-to-right shunting is partly responsible for increasing myocardial oxygenation, which is needed for the tachycardic response to hemorrhage.26\n",

Fluid shifts from the interstitial and extravascular space to the intravascular space occur following the Starling law, especially during episodes of diminished hydrostatic pressure.28 Activation of the rennin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) also occurs because of reduced renal perfusion and also sympathetic system\u2013induced vasoconstriction of the splanchnic vasculature. RAAS activation results in sodium and water retention, vasoconstriction, more upregulation of the sympathetic response, and release of antidiuretic hormone (ADH).29 The purpose of RAAS activation is to increase effective circulating volume, increase cardiac output, and shunt blood to the heart and brain. A summary of compensatory mechanisms is outlined in Fig. 2.",

If the balance is tipped in either direction, organ damage occurs. Injury to organs occurs from activated leukocytes\u2019 release of damaging cytoplasmic granules, microcirculatory ischemia from leukocyte obstruction, altered apoptosis, and production of reactive oxygen species.34 Infection causing sepsis is the classic example of SIRS and results in the production of inflammatory mediators, called cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin-1, and interleukin-6. Cytokines are produced by immunocytes, especially B lymphocytes, T lymphocytes, and macrophages.35 There are more than 20 different cytokines and many more non\u2013immunocyte-produced inflammatory proteins, such as platelet activating factor, interferons, and products of the arachidonic acid cascade.36 These inflammatory mediators bind to receptors of endothelial cells, other immunocytes such as neutrophils, and mast cells.

The classic example of a PAMP is lipopolysaccharide from gram-negative bacteria. PAMPs bind to many different receptors, the largest class being Toll-like receptors, of which there are more than 10 described in the literature.39 Once bound to a pattern recognition receptor, internal signaling pathways result in a change of cellular metabolism, protein production, or other cell activation, such as chemotaxis. PAMP production is influenced by genetic factors and aging.

Activation of endothelial cells from trauma, infection, or inflammation results in expression of receptors (P and L selectins, endothelial cell immunoglobulin adhesion molecules).42 Leukocytes, namely neutrophils, bind to expressed endothelial receptors, adhering to the wall of the vessel lumen. As this process continues with more neutrophils binding and rolling, microvascular flow can be disrupted, causing changes in capillary integrity and vascular tone.43 In addition, cytokines cause changes in vascular tone, resulting in contraction of arteries but not venules. This process, mediated by tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin-6, and other cytokines, modifies the blood supply to ischemic and inflamed tissues.44 Interstitial edema, especially that of the pulmonary parenchyma, occurs as the result of cytokines and inducible nitric oxide which is a potent vasodilator. Several studies have found that acute lung inflammation, known as acute respiratory distress syndrome, is in part caused by activation of immunocytes, their production of cytokines, and the response by the pulmonary microvascular system.45, 46 This type of edema, termed capillary leak syndrome, not only affects the lungs but also other organ systems, causing interstitial edema, which makes it more difficult to deliver oxygen from the capillaries to their target cells.

Much of the shock research on pocket pets, rabbits, and rodents are controlled experiments. Rodents and rabbits have served as research animals in this field of study for many decades, and there are numerous reports inducing shock, sepsis, and SIRS in rats, mice, and rabbits.56, 57, 58 In rats, typical increases in heart rate and sympathetic response occur during sepsis and shock, characterized by tachycardia and decreased mean arterial pressure.59 Rats also develop hypothermia associated with shock, similar to dogs, cats, and humans.60 Hamsters have been used to study sepsis and, similar to rats in shock, develop hypotension and leukocyte activation with vessel margination.61 Similarly, in a ferret model of SARS \u2013coronavirus, hyperthermia associated with viremic sepsis progressing to hypothermia associated with decompensatory shock was described. That same study also showed leukopenia in moribund ferrets on day 2 after infection.62 One study of rabbits that underwent experimental hemorrhagic shock by removing 26% of blood volume noted tachycardia, hypotension, and significantly decreased cardiac output versus controls.63 That same study, by Chalmers and colleagues,63 which compared normal rabbits with adrenalectomized rabbits, noted that the sympathetic response in normal animals minimized reductions in CO and blood pressure. Contrasting this research, clinical reports note the difficulty in resuscitating hypotensive rabbits and small mammals because of vagal stimulation, which becomes active simultaneously with sympathetic activity.64 Rabbits in an uncontrolled hemorrhage shock study required 123 to 133 mL/kg of crystalloid fluid in attempts to control hypotension.65 The aforementioned dose is significantly higher than crystalloid shock dose recommendations for lagomorphs in the literature, which are 15 mL/kg or initial boluses of 3 to 5 mL/kg.66\n",

Reptiles have vascular adaptations allowing blood shunting, known as the renal-portal system. During periods of dehydration and prolonged hypovolemia, blood from their hind limbs and tail traverses to the afferent renal portal veins, preserving renal perfusion.67 One study noted that, during acute hemorrhage, snakes were able to maintain their blood volume by restoring up to 90% of deficit within 2 hours of hemorrhage by shifting extravascular fluid to the intravascular space.68 Although snakes are able to restore their circulating volume after hemorrhage, their autonomic response is minor and does not allow compensation of hypotension.69 Because of their body configuration, environmental temperature effects on metabolism, and cardiovascular anatomy (3-chambered heart), snakes have highly variable blood pressure. Depending on their habitat (arboreal vs terrestrial vs aquatic), systemic blood pressures in snakes correspond with gravitational stress. Arboreal snakes have higher arterial pressures than aquatic snakes. Blood pressure in these species also depends on body mass, with larger snakes having higher blood pressure.70\n",

Surprisingly, there were no significant differences found between those two fluids and autotransfusion with respect to heart rate, respiratory rate, and systolic blood pressure.75 In a similar study by Lichtenberger and colleagues,76 mallard ducks underwent controlled hemorrhage and fluid resuscitation with either crystalloid (Plasmalyte A), colloid (Hetastarch), or an HBOC (Oxyglobin).

In pigeons, loss of 60% of blood volume resulted in no clinical signs and their hematocrits returned to normal within 7 days. The ability of birds to tolerate such large volumes of blood loss is thought to be caused by 3 adaptations. There is rapid extravascular fluid resorption from muscles that have a large capillary surface area, which then replenishes the intravascular deficit. In addition, birds have blunted autonomic response, resulting in fewer clinical signs of tachycardia, tachypnea, and hypothermia. The ability to mobilize large numbers of immature red blood cells is a third adaptation to hemorrhagic shock that birds possess.77 This unique response to hemorrhage was also noted in a study that compared the hemodynamics of hemorrhage in chicks with that of rats. Controlled hemorrhage caused significant reduction of mean arterial pressure and cardiac output in rats, by 23% and 43% respectively. In the chicks, mean arterial pressure was only reduced by 15% and cardiac output reduced by 4% because of their ability to maintain stroke volume. The investigators concluded that chicks were able to maintain mean arterial pressure independently of changes in peripheral vascular tone.78\n",

There is a paucity of research of these syndromes in other species such as ferrets, birds, and reptiles. Although small mammals, experimentally, have a similar autonomic response to dogs during induced hemorrhage and shock states, that response is not noted in the clinical setting, in which decompensated shock is more commonly reported. Poor perfusion affects every major organ system, but particular attention should be given to the immune system, coagulation system, cardiovascular system, gastrointestinal tract, and kidneys. Knowing how these systems are affected helps to explain to clinicians why patients with shock can later become septic or coagulopathic. To ensure the best outcomes in patients who have shock or SIRS, early recognition and intervention by provision of supplemental oxygen and fluid resuscitation is essential. Treatment to combat shock in exotic species is discussed elsewhere in this issue.",
