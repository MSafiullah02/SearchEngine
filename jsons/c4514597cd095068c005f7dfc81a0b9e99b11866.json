LR and artificial neural network (ANN) models were trained and subsequently used to predict the occurrence of DED in patients who underwent vitrectomy for the first time during the period. e area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC) was used to evaluate the predictive accuracy of the ML models. e AUCs with use of the LR and ANN models were 0.741 and 0.786, respectively, suggesting satisfactory performance in predicting the occurrence of DED. When the two models were compared in terms of predictive power, the fitting effect of the ANN model was slightly superior to that of the LR model. In conclusion, both LR and ANN models may be used to accurately predict the occurrence of DED after vitrectomy.",

            "text": "Vitrectomy, an ocular surgery performed to partially or completely remove the vitreous, is widely used to treat various ocular conditions, such as cloudy vitreous, vitreous haemorrhage, retinal detachment, and proliferative diabetic retinopathy [1] [2] [3] . Most vitrectomies are performed to facilitate surgery to address one of a variety of retinal conditions [3] . Some vitrectomies are conducted for diagnostic purposes. With advances in the instrumentation available, vitrectomy has become a well-established procedure. Serious vitrectomy-associated complications are very rare [1, 3] ; however, like other types of ocular surgeries, vitrectomy may traumatize the conjunctival tissues, often resulting in the development of secondary dry eye disease (DED) [4] [5] [6] . Using the demographic and clinical features of patients to predict risk for vitrectomy-related DED will facilitate decision-making in the management of vitrectomy patients and improve the relationship between doctors and patients. To the best of our knowledge, no previous study has investigated the prediction of risk for secondary DED in patients scheduled to undergo vitrectomy.",

Notably, both models identified age as the top risk factor for vitrectomy-associated DED. In addition, both LR and ANN models identified four common independent risk factors for DED after vitrectomy: age, smoking more than 10 cigarettes per day, daily exposure to computer or mobile phone screens preoperatively, and preoperative BUT. History of diabetes mellitus and surgical duration were identified as risk factors only by the LR model, while preoperative CCT was only identified as a risk factor for vitrectomy-associated DED by the ANN model.

            "text": "Few studies have investigated the influencing factors that affect the occurrence of DED after vitrectomy. Our results are consistent with previous reports that age and surgical duration are risk factors for vitrectomy-related DED [12] . In addition, Banaee et al. (2008) reported that scleral depression significantly increased risk for DED after vitrectomy [5] . e tear film, which comprises lipid, tear, and mucin layers, nourishes the conjunctival epithelium and cornea, supplies lubrication to facilitate opening and closing of the eyelids, and provides a high-quality optical surface for the cornea [13, 14] . e pathogenesis of DED includes inflammation, apoptosis of the lacrimal gland cells and conjunctival epithelial cells, and androgen imbalance [13, 14] . e results of this study helped us to identify the mechanisms underlying DED after vitrectomy. First, the corneal epithelium and conjunctiva may be damaged by vitrectomy. After the operation, numerous factors may disturb the ocular surface, including scleral sutures, conjunctival sutures, incisions, and conjunctival edema. Corneal curvature may be affected, resulting in a decrease in tear film stability [15] . Importantly, it has been reported that basic fibroblast growth factor (alone or in combination with cytochrome c peroxidase) accelerates the healing of surgically damaged corneal epithelium [16, 17] . We therefore sought to investigate the benefit of reducing the occurrence of DED in patients who had undergone vitrectomy. Second, vitrectomy-associated congestion and edema of the corneal tissue may affect the adhesion of mucin, allowing for the infiltration of inflammatory factors. is process can cause lacrimal gland damage, which exacerbates any corneal damage [18] . Prolonged surgical time can thus destroy the stability of the tear film and lead to secondary dry eye after vitrectomy. ird, corneal goblet cells are more sensitive and vulnerable to external environmental factors, such as hyperglycemia (in diabetic patients). Metabolic disorders and nutritional disorders shorten the tear film rupture time and destroy the normal corneal morphology, thereby reducing the secretion of mucin. Finally, the eye drops often prescribed for patients after vitrectomy contain preservatives, which can affect corneal epithelial integrity, damage repair functions, and reduce the regularity of the corneal surface. All of these factors decrease tear film stability [19] . e analysis of clinical research data is challenging due to the complexity involved: on one hand, data need to meet the constraints of analytical models; on the other hand, the data characteristics need to be retained as far as possible in order to simulate the clinical situation [20] . It is therefore of great clinical significance to use the limited clinical data available for patients who have undergone vitrectomy for data analysis. Such a data-based approach will improve the data model for predicting secondary DED after vitrectomy and help physicians to identify risks early enough to communicate effectively with patients and to provide pertinent clinical interventions.",
