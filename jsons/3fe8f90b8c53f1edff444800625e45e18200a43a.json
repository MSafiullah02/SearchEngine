            "text": "By dividing the case fatality rate found in the German study (R = 0.004), into the number of COVID-19 deaths in the U.S. (Di = 18,559), we obtained an estimate of Ui = 4,639,790 unconfirmed positive cases in the U.S. Ui = Di/R = 4,639,790 = 18,559/0.004 Results: Estimated Positive, Unconfirmed Cases In order to apply this estimate to any given area, we then divide this number by the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in the U.S. provided by CDC (492,416) to find the ratio of unconfirmed to confirmed cases, which yields Ui/ Ci = 9.4, where 9.4 = 4,639,790/492,416. By multiplying 9.4, by the number of confirmed cases in a given area for which they are reported, one obtains an estimate of its positive, unconfirmed cases. Applying this to Whatcom County, Washington which as of April 25 th reported 284 confirmed cases (Johns Hopkins University, 2020), we estimate that there were 2,670 unconfirmed, positive cases on that date. Uw = (Ui/Ci)*Cw = 2,670 = 9.4*284One issue with this approach is that some of the confirmed cases are no longer active, due to death or recovery. Applying this method to the number of active cases (257) reported for Whatcom County, Washington as of April 25 th (Johns Hopkins University Coronavirus Resource Site, 2020) yields an estimated 2,416 positive, unconfirmed cases, where Uw = 2,416 = 9.4* 257.",
