            "text": "Neuropathies in the upper limb are common and most often caused by extrinsic and intrinsic compression, neuralgic amyotrophy [1] or hourglass-like constriction. The definition of hourglass-like constriction includes all palsies caused by fascicular torsion and/or fascicular edema unrelated to any compressive structure [2]. Several reports of hourglass-like constriction in the upper limb involve the anterior and posterior interosseous [3], axillary [4], musculocutaneous [5] and suprascapular [4] nerves. Spontaneous palsies of digital nerves are not as frequent as in other nerves of the upper limb; only a few cases have been described in the literature [6]. Therefore, in this report, we present the first case of hourglass-like constriction of a digital nerve.",

Paresthesia was the first symptom and preceded the development pain and hypoesthesia, without any identifiable trigger event. The Weber test revealed discreet hypoesthesia in the same territory. A typical irritative pseudo-Tinel sign was immediately induced by percussion of the examiner's fingertip on the 4th palmar common digital nerve in the palm of the hand. Physical examination did not identify any motor weakness. There was no history of trauma, wound, flu or immune disorder. The interview did not find any occupational risks, or evidence of a neurologic disease like multiple sclerosis. The neurological examination was normal.",

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the cervical spine found no evidence of a radicular cause; brain MRI was normal. Ultrasound (performed with a linear transducer) and MRI of the hand found no signs of local compression. The 4th palmar common digital nerve had a normal signal and no neuroma was visible. The radiologist found a very small vascular abnormality close to the fourth digital nerve space (Fig. 1\n).

Surgical exploration found an hourglass-like fascicular constriction of the 4th palmar common digital nerve proximal to the metacarpophalangeal joint (Fig. 2\n). The rest of the common nerve was normal over its entire course. Macroscopic and microscopic examination revealed the nerve was edematous, and the single constriction was almost complete. All the fascicles were affected but appeared to be continuous and not ruptured. No vascular abnormality was observed except for local inflammation around the constriction. Interfascicular neurolysis was performed to correct the constriction. Immediately after neurolysis, the nerve regained a nearly normal appearance without edema or intrinsic constriction (Fig. 3\n).",

The initial phenomenon seems to be inflammatory and fascicles being twisted during the motion. Local inflammation, whatever the cause, leads to edema of the nerve and weakness of the fascicles, which become vulnerable. This may lead to the development of adhesions between the fascicles and adjacent structures during abduction or rotation of the shoulder, elbow flexion/extension, forearm rotation.",

Interfascicular neurolysis was the first choice for our patient, mainly due to anatomical reasons. Macroscopic examination showed only one site of constriction and the fascicles appeared intact. The fact that it was an exclusively sensory nerve was also a factor. Simple interfascicular neurolysis was preferred from a risk-benefit point of view, versus resection with direct repair or nerve grafting. The challenge of this treatment is pain reduction.
