The World Health Organisation (WHO) declared COVID-19 to be a pandemic of proportions similar to the Spanish Influenza of 1918. As of the 1 st May 2020, there have been over 224,172 deaths related to COVID-19 infection worldwide. 1 Data collated from across the world suggest that the overall case fatality rate is around 7%, with country-level estimates ranging between 0.5-14%. 2 These figures however are not useful for universal comparison as testing rates also vary by country and there is a lag phase in reported deaths that occur in the community. Consequently, there is wide variation in the reported country-specific death rates which may be attributed to variation in testing rates, underreporting or real differences in environmental, sociodemographic and health system parameters.",

Comorbidities may account for differences in mortality rates across countries. A study among laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19 in China showed that patients with any comorbidity, including diabetes, malignancy and hypertension, had poorer clinical outcomes than those without. 5 We thus accounted for country-level data on a selection of key comorbidities in our analysis which included prevalent diabetes mellitus, neoplasms, and hypertension. Diabetes mellitus is significantly associated with all-cause and cardiovascular disease mortality globally. BMI \u226540kg/m2 has been identified as an independent risk factor for severe COVID-19 illness. 7 Finally, a recent systematic review on 5 studies from China showed that smoking is likely associated with negative outcomes and progression of COVID-19. 6 All rights reserved.

As testing rates for the virus vary across countries, the incidence or prevalence of the disease cannot be compared between countries. While death from the disease is a hard outcome, the denominator information to calculate death rates make between-country comparisons difficult. In addition, the deaths in the community, particularly in the elderly living in care homes, often go untested and thus firm diagnosis remains impossible. Therefore, in this study we have adopted an outcome that is comparable in terms of the increase in the rate of death, rather than death rates per se. Therefore, this may better represent the spread and seriousness of pandemic in individual countries when comparing countries at different stages of the pandemic. The country-level parameters assessed as potential predictors have all been implicated at some point to be associated with severity and consequently mortality.",

In 2007 the WHO published a protocol on 'rapid operations to contain the initial emergence of pandemic influenza', which included recommendations on travel restrictions. 33 However, subsequent guidance advises such restrictions are not recommended once a virus has spread significantly. 34 A recent systematic review of 23 studies that assessed the effectiveness of internal and international travel restrictions in the containment of influenza demonstrated limited impact from these restrictions. They found that internal travel restrictions delayed pandemic peak by approximately 1.5 weeks, that 90% air travel restriction delayed the spread of pandemics by approximately 3-4 weeks but only reduced attack rates by less than 0.02% and that social and economic impacts need to be evaluated. 35 However, a systematic review of combination strategies for pandemic influenza response showed that combination strategies including travel restrictions increased the effectiveness of individual policies. 36The WHO recommendations for pandemic preparedness and resilience recommends that points of entry into the country should be monitored by focussing on surveillance and risk communication to travellers but falls short of closing down international travel. 37",

Other explanatory variables associated with COVID-19 related mortality may have been missed and some of the covariate data used in our model predates the COVID outbreak and may not be relevant at this time point. Furthermore, as new countries are affected by the epidemic, the virulence of the virus and resistance of the human body may have changed over time which was not accounted for in our model.
