All the test compounds barring 25 exhibited antifungal activity. The compound 19 was the best and showed comparable MICs to the known compound karanjin. This compound showed activity of 6.25 \u03bcg/mL as compared to standard antifungal drug fluconazole, having MIC of 2 \u03bcg/mL against Trichophyton mentagrophytes. Against each test isolate including bacteria, compound 19 showed good activity whereas the compound 22 exhibited good activity against fungal isolates only. On the contrary compound 12 showed mild activity against bacteria and fungi. Most of the compounds have shown good antifungal activity against Trichophyton mentagrophytes but compound 19, 22 and 12 exhibited good activity against each fungal isolate. It can be inferred from the activity results that substitution by sulfur has produced better results as compared to the nitrogen analogues as revealed from activities of chalcones 12\u201315, propanediones (18/19) and flavonols 25\u201327, whereas nitrogen analogue for flavone 22 was more active then its sulfur counterpart 24. Methoxy substituted analogues for all these compounds in general have shown decrease in activity. Two of the compounds 12 and 19 also had some antibacterial activity (Table 1\n).",
