If the consequences of a suboptimal adherence to respiratory hygiene result in inconspicuous professional emergencies on a daily basis, the impact on the health care system can be a major unexpected outbreak of a respiratory infection. Because transmission of these pathogens occurs before the evaluation of patients, there is a great potential benefit of raising awareness of simple measures such as coughing in the fold of the elbow rather than in the palms of the hands as well as health care worker preventive measures previously outlined.",
