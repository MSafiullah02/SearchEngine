However, recent findings suggest that anti-interleukin 6 monoclonal antibodies can be useful in blocking the inflammatory cascade involved in lung inflammation during COVID-19 infection. Evidence also suggests that the earlier we treat, the better patients improve with treatment. 13 Therefore, LUS could be useful, being performed at several time points from clinical diagnosis, in determining early lung involvement during the paucisymptomatic phase of the disease and potentially playing a role in treatment decisions. Funding organizations are starting to support clinical trials; in this regard, LUS can be used to monitor lung involvement during a specific treatment. Importantly, LUS can be used in every setting, including low-to middle-income countries, allowing the reduction of disparities in trial participation, since secondary-level imaging studies (such as computed tomography) are not easily accessible everywhere.",

All team members discussed their clinical cases through online meetings. Images were reviewed by all team members, who were blinded to the clinical background, and listed in classes of the severity of lung involvement based on LUS images. At the end of this process, a biomedical engineer expert in LUS collected the data and suggested a LUS grading system for COVID-19 pneumonia. Again, the biomedical engineer resubmitted the images grouped in different classes of severity to the study members, who were blinded of clinical data, to review the images again and evaluated agreement regarding the LUS scores.

The second operator can be either in the room, being at a safe distance from the patient (about 2 m), or even remain outside the door, communicating by a phone call with the operator to optimize the quality of images. Potentially, this last approach can reduce the operator dependence of the US, since the second operator blindly selects the images, being unaware of the clinical condition of the patient.

Saturation phenomena occur, eg, when the signal strength of the echo signals is too high for the receiving electronics to be converted into electrical signals, conserving a linear relationship with the pressure amplitude.
