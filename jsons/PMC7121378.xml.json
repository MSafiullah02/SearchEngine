            "text": "CD4+ T helper cells are critical cells that mediate adaptive immune responses in the lung (Fig. 3.1). These cells are initially primed by antigen-presenting cells (APCs) that present peptide antigen in the context of class II major histocompatibility complexes engaged with the T-cell receptor (termed signal 1). Both APCs and T-cells express co-stimulatory molecules and receptors (termed signal 2) and this second signal is critical for both generating antigen-specific effector T-cells as well as memory cells. Antigen presentation without signal 2 can lead to T-cell anergy. CD4+ T-cell differentiation into specific effector lineages occurs under the influence of lineage-specific cytokines (signal 3) that can control both chromatin remodeling as well as the induction of lineage specific-transcription factors in CD4+ T-cells.\n",

            "text": "Th1 cells were first described by Mossman et al. (1986) by their ability to express interferon-gamma (IFN-\u03b3). Th1 cell development requires the transcription factors T-bet (Szabo et al. 2000) and these cells can differentiate from na\u00efve T-cell precursors in the presence of Th1-polarizing cytokines such as IL-12p70 which is a heterodimeric cytokine consisting of IL-12p35 and IL-12p40 (Wolf et al. 1991). Th1 responses can also occur independent of IL-12 and type I interferons have been shown to facilitate Th1 differentiation in certain situations (Longhi et al. 2009). IFN-\u03b3 once produced by differentiating Th1 cells can signal in an autocrine\u2013\u00adparacrine fashion to further amplify Th1 differentiation and lineage commitment. IFN-\u03b3 signals via a receptor complex consisting of two IFN-\u03b3R1 and two IFN-\u03b3R2 chains which are widely expressed on myeloid-derived cells such as macrophages and dendritic cells as well as structural cells in the lung such as epithelial cells and fibroblasts (Gough et al. 2008). These receptors can activate Janus-associated kinases 1 and 2 which phosphorylate STAT1 which allows STAT1 homodimerization and translocation to the nucleus, followed by binding to gamma-activated sequences (GAS) that regulate gene transcription (Gough et al. 2008). IFN-\u03b3 regulates cellular immunity to many intracellular infections including Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Listeria monocytogenes, and Salmonella typhimurium. Patients with IL-12p40 mutations can develop BCG or S. typhimurium infection but some patients can be managed with antibiotics and theoretically they can respond to interferon (Picard et al. 2002). For example, patients with IFN-\u03b3 receptor mutations can develop disseminated infection with bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) that is resistant to antibiotics and IFN-\u03b3 therapy (Dorman et al. 2004; Sologuren et al. 2011). Patients with IL-12p40 mutations can develop BCG or S. typhimurium infection but some patients can be managed with antibiotics and theoretically they can respond to interferon (Picard et al. 2002). Thus, there is strong evidence that this pathway is essential for human control of these intracellular pathogens.",

            "text": "Th2 cells differentiation requires the transcription factor GATA3 and STAT5 (Paul 2010), although initial differentiation and activation of these transcription factors can occur independently of IL-4. GATA3 binds to the Il4 locus and IL-4 and signaling via STAT6 is critical for further TH2 proliferation and lineage commitment (Paul 2010). Th2 cells produce interleukin (IL)-4, IL-5, and IL-13 and mediate immunity against infections with helminths (Fig. 3.2). These cells also facilitate B-cell differentiation and antibody responses to T-cell dependent protein antigens (Willart and Hammad 2011). Deletion of Gata3 in mice results in embryonic lethality but conditional deletion in T-cell confirms its essential role in Th2 differentiation and the expulsion of helminths from the gastrointestinal tract (Zhu et al. 2004). IL-5 is the principal growth factor that regulates eosinophilopoiesis and IL-5 deleted mice show marked reduction of peripheral and bone marrow eosinophils (Kopf et al. 1996; Fallon et al. 2002). Transgenic over-expression of IL-5 results in eosinophilia (Dent et al. 1990). IL-13 signaling via STAT6 in airway smooth muscle and in airway epithelium leads to airways hyperresponsiveness to methacholine (Wills-Karp et al. 1998; Grunig et al. 1998). Moreover IL-13 is a major factor in mucous production and goblet cell differentiation in the airway (Wills-Karp et al. 1998; Grunig et al. 1998). Th2 cell and their effector cytokines have been widely implicated in atopic diseases such as allergic rhinitis, atopic dermatitis, and asthma (Barnes 2008). Furthermore, IL-13 has been implicated in fibrotic processes in the lung in response to drugs such as Bleomycin (Belperio et al. 2002; Liu et al. 2004; Jakubzick et al. 2003). It has been recently recognized that Th2 cell priming can be driven by a number of cytokines produced by lung epithelium including TSLP, IL-25, and IL-33 (Willart and Hammad 2011).\n",

In the context of pulmonary infection with bacteria these cells provide a substantial amount of early IL-17 and are regulated by IL-23 and IL-1\u03b2 (Lockhart et al. 2006; Shibata et al. 2007a; Sutton et al. 2009; Martin et al. 2009; Chen et al. 2011). As these cells express the \u03b3\u03b4 T-cell receptor, it is unclear if these cells are responding directly to cytokine stimulation alone or whether they also require endogenous TCR-dependent signals as well in the lung. \u03b3\u03b4 T-cells have recently been shown to limit pathology in RSV infection (Dodd et al. 2009). These cells have also been shown to produce IL-10 and can play a regulatory role in other pulmonary infections such as Pneumocystis infection (Steele et al. 2000).",

These cells are defined by lacking lineage markers, a lack of T-cell receptors but require IL-7 signaling for their development. Thus these cells are present in RAG1 or RAG2\u2212/\u2212 mice but are lacking in RAG2, yC double-deleted mice (Halim et al. 2012; Spits and Cupedo 2012). ROR\u03b3T expressing cells are critical for the formation of secondary lymphoid tissues (via regulation of lymphotoxin \u00adexpression) and play critical roles in mucosal immunology in the gastrointestinal tract through the production of IL-17 and IL-22 (Ouyang et al. 2008). Type 2 ILCs produce IL-5 and IL-13 and participate in the clearance of helminths from the GI tract (Neill and McKenzie 2011). These cells appear to be regulated by IL-25 (IL-17E) as well as IL-33, a member of the IL-1 family. Recently it has been demonstrated that a population of ILCs prices IL-13 in response to IL-33 induced by viral infection and these cells mediate in part, viral-induced exacerbation of allergic disease in the lung (Kim et al. 2012). In addition to viruses, these cells can also be activated by protease allergens to drive eosinophilic airways inflammation as well as airways hyperresponsiveness (Halim et al. 2012). In this allergen setting the activation of these cells required IL-33 and TSLP (Halim et al. 2012). Thus these cells recapitulate many aspects of CD4+ T-cell immunity in that there are subsets that express similar effector molecules, yet these cells are activated early and their activation is independent of TCR stimulation.",

There are several mechanisms of action by which IFN-\u03b3 is thought to be critical for control of lung immunity against intracellular pathogens. The first is through macrophage priming and the induction of intracellular microbicidal activity of macrophages (Murray 1988). IFN-\u03b3 priming of macrophages results in significantly augmented TLR signaling (Schroder et al. 2006). IFN-\u03b3 also increases microbicidal activity in part, through the induction of inducible nitric oxide synthase which can increase the production of reactive nitrogen intermediates (Xie et al. 1992, 1993) as well as by increasing the production of reactive oxygen species. These activities may explain the therapeutic benefit of IFN-\u03b3 in patients with chronic granulomatous disease due to mutations in NADPH oxidase (Naderi et al. 2012; Segal et al. 2011; Fernandez-Boyanapalli et al. 2010). This increase in microbicidal activity has been termed classically activation of macrophages (Gordon 2003).",

Activation of the STAT6 pathway leads to alternative macrophage activation characterized by the expression of arginase 1, YM1, YM2, and the macrophage mannose receptor (Gordon and Martinez 2010). IL-4 treatment of macrophages reduces their phagocytic ability although it increases the clearance of apoptotic neutrophils (Gordon and Martinez 2010). It has been suggested that AAMs have regulatory roles in helminth infection and can reduce immunopathology (Gordon and Martinez 2010). AAMs also have increased expression of Dectin-1 in addition to macrophage mannose receptor and thus they may have greater fungicidal activity. Recently it has been shown that Francisella tularensis, a virulent pathogen in the lung can subvert classical activation of macrophages and thus prolong its intracellular survival (Shirey et al. 2008).",

            "text": "Human bronchial epithelium express IL-17RA and IL-17RC which allow these cells to respond to IL-17A and IL-17F as well as IL-22R and IL-10R2, the receptors for IL-22 (Fig. 3.3) (McAllister et al. 2005; Aujla et al. 2008). Both IL-17A and IL-17F can induce ligands for CXCR2 such as IL-8 and granulopoietic growth \u00adfactors such as G-CSF which can be augmented in the presence of TNF-\u03b1 (McAllister et al. 2005; Jones and Chan 2002). Since IL-17A and IL-17F can be co-expressed in the same cell, it has been reported that these two IL-17 family members can form three cytokines including IL-17A homodimers, IL-17A/F heterodimers which has intermediate activity compared to IL-17A homodimers, and IL-17F homodimers which has the least potent activity (Wright et al. 2007). IL-17 receptors are also expressed on lung fibroblasts, pulmonary vascular endothelium, and bronchial smooth muscle. Using CXCL1 as a model CXCR2 ligand, it has been shown that a major effect of IL-17 signaling is increasing mRNA stability of this transcript (Hartupee et al. 2007; Sun et al. 2011) resulting in augmented protein production. A similar activity has also been reported for IL-17-mediated increases in G-CSF production (Cai et al. 1998). IL-17RA is also abundantly expressed on myeloid cells; however, these cells express very little IL-17RC and thus IL-17A and IL-17F have limited activity on myeloid cells. It has been reported that IL-17 can enhance IL-12p70 in alveolar macrophages (Lin et al. 2009) as well CCL2, CCL3, GM-CSF, IL-1\u03b2, and IL-9 in CD4+ T-cells (Ishigame et al. 2009). It has recently been shown that Th17 cells express IL-17RA and IL-17RE, the receptor for IL-17C and IL-17C, and increase the production of IL-17 by these cells (Song et al. 2011; Ramirez-Carrozzi et al. 2011; Chang et al. 2011). IL-17C can be expressed in lung epithelium (unpublished observations) and thus can serve as a feed forward mechanism by which the epithelium could influence interstitial T-cell responses. IL-17A can also augment apical bicarbonate anion transport in polarized NHBE cells and this activity may be important in mediated IL-17A\u2019s antimicrobial effect in the lung as bicarbonate anion has been shown to greatly augment the bioactivity of human defensins (Kreindler et al. 2009). IL-17RA is required not only for host resistance to the extracellular pathogens Klebsiella pneumoniae (Ye et al. 2001) but also for the intracellular pathogen F. tularensis (Lin et al. 2009). In the former scenario, IL-17 regulates G-CSF and neutrophil recruitment (Ye et al. 2001) and dominant sources in primary infection are lung \u03b3\u03b4 T-cells (Chen et al. 2011). In the case of F. tularensis, IL-17 regulates IL-12p70 production by macrophages which are required for Th1 immunity which is ultimately the effector cell required for control of the pathogen (Lin et al. 2009).\n",

            "text": "As stated above in primary infection, early sources of IL-17 and IL-22 can be from innate lymphoid cells (Crellin et al. 2010), NK or NKT cells (Crellin et al. 2010; Cella et al. 2009), or \u03b3\u03b4 T-cells (Lockhart et al. 2006; Shibata et al. 2007b; Simonian et al. 2009). Classic Th17 cells can also be elicited in the lung in the setting of vaccination and in this setting they play roles in protection against a diverse set of organisms including both intracellular and extracellular bacteria as well as fungi. Using an ESAT-6 peptide Khader et al. showed that Th17 cells are primed in the lung prior to robust Th1 responses and that Th17 cells regulated local expression of ligands for CXCR3 (expressed on Th1 cells) and through this mechanism, Th17 cells could augment the recruitment of Th1 cells into the lung (Khader et al. 2007). Fungal-specific Th17 cells have also been shown to be critical for vaccine-induced protection against Coccidioides posadasii, Histoplasma capsulatum, and Blasto\u00admyces dermatitidis infection (Wuthrich et al. 2011). This protection was also dependent on neutrophils. IL-17 has also been shown to mediate serotype-\u00adindependent immunity using a whole cell polysaccharide vaccine from S. pneumoniae (Malley et al. 2006). Recently, Chen et al. showed that Th17 cells elicited by K. pneumoniae vaccination recognize conserved outer membrane proteins in the cell wall of the bacteria and these antigens could also provide serotype-independent immunity through Th17 cells that conferred heterologous protection against multiple serotypes of the organism (Chen et al. 2011). Again this protection was meditated by neutrophils. What is unclear from these studies to date are the specific aspects of Th17 function that are required for protection. For examples, what homing receptors are required to elicit these cells efficiently in the lung? Is only IL-17A required or is there a role for IL-17F or IL-17A/F heterodimers? Is IL-22 also important? What are the critical target cells that IL-17 is signaling in the lung to afford vaccine-induced immunity? What are the best Th17 adjuvants? Are there truly memory Th17 cells that can persist in the host or will these cells require periodic boosting to recall these responses? What is the role of plasticity in the function and fate of these cells?",

Signal 1 consists of activation through the T-cell receptor followed by signal 2 which is mediated through co-stimulatory molecules such as ICOSL, CD28, and cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated protein (CTLA-4). T-cell differentiation occurs under specific cytokine signals. IFNg can induce T-bet via STAT1 signaling which in turn can regulate IL-12bR2 expression making Th1 cells responsive to IL-12p70. IL-4 induces Gata3 which augments IL-4 producing which supports the differentiation of Th2 cells. Th2 cells produce IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13 as their effector cytokines. TGF\u03b2 and IL-6 can induce ROR\u03b3T expression as well as activation of STAT3 that induces IL-23 receptor expression and the combination of these cytokines supports the differentiation and proliferation of Th17 cells. These cells produce the cytokines IL-17/IL-17F, IL-22, and IL-21. IL-21 can signal in an autocrine fashion to reinforce the differentiation of the Th17 lineage",
