            "text": "Pneumonia caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection emerged in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China in December 2019. By Feb. 11, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) officially named the disease resulting from infection with SARS-CoV-2 as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). COVID-19 represents a spectrum of clinical manifestations that typically include fever, dry cough, and fatigue, often with pulmonary involvement. SARS-CoV-2 is highly contagious and most individuals within the population at large are susceptible to infection. Wild animal hosts and infected patients are currently the main sources of disease which is transmitted via respiratory droplets and direct contact. Since the outbreak, the Chinese government and scientific community have acted rapidly to identify the causative agent and promptly shared the viral gene sequence, and have carried out measures to contain the epidemic. Meanwhile, recent research has revealed critical aspects of SARS-CoV-2 biology and disease pathogenesis; other studies have focused on epidemiology, clinical features, diagnosis, management, as well as drug and vaccine development. This review aims to summarize the latest research findings and to provide expert consensus. We will also share ongoing efforts and experience in China, which may provide insight on how to contain the epidemic and improve our understanding of this emerging infectious disease, together with updated guidance for prevention, control, and critical management of this pandemic.",

COVID-19 is the result of infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that was first isolated and identified in patients who were exposed at a seafood market in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China on December 2019 (Zhu N et al., 2020) . Similar to findings related to SARS-CoV (Drosten et al., 2003; Ksiazek et al., 2003) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) (Zaki et al., 2012) , SARS-CoV-2 is believed to cross species to initiate primary human infections; it is now spread primarily by human-tohuman transmission. Although the case fatality rate of COVID-19 (estimated at 2%-3%) is lower than those of SARS (approximately 10%) and MERS (approximately 40%), the pandemic associated with COVID-19 has been far more severe. As of Mar. 15, 2020, SARS-CoV-2 has spread rapidly to 34 provinces and cities in China; infection has been reported in 144 countries/territories/areas across five continents (World Health Organization, 2020) . The COVID-19 epidemic represents a substantial challenge for governments, individuals, and society as a whole.",

The S protein mediates virus attachment and membrane fusion during infection (King et al., 2012) . In addition to the characteristic S protein, coronavirus genomes generally encode three additional structural proteins, including the Membrane (M) protein, the Envelope (E) protein, and the Nucleocapsid (N) protein. The coronavirus M protein, 218 to 263 amino acids (aa), has an N-terminus modified by an O-or N-glycan and a hydrophilic C-terminal tail. The E protein, 74-109 aa, may be involved in promoting virulence; there are typically about 20 copies of this protein per virion. The coronavirus N protein, 349 to 470 aa, is an RNA-bound phosphorylated protein that facilitates appropriate folding of genomic RNA into the nucleocapsid (King et al., 2012) .",

Genome sequence alignment has revealed a 79.5% sequence identity between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV and a remarkable 93.1% identity with the sequence of the RaTG12 virus isolated from a bat (Rhinolophus affinis) residing in Yunnan Province, China (Chan et al., 2020a; Zhou P et al., 2020b) ; these latter results suggest that SARS-CoV-2 may originate from a virus that is endemic in this bat species. Comparative genomic analysis primarily based on sequence inserts identified in the S protein of a coronavirus isolated from the pangolin (Order, Pholidota; Family, Manidae) suggested that these mammals were most likely the intermediate hosts for cross-species transmission (Liu et al., 2019; Zhang T et al., 2020) .",

The genome analyses of SARS-CoV and bat coronaviruses indicate that the sequences of ORF6, ORF8, and the S gene display a comparatively low degree of sequence conservation among coronaviruses in general. However, the genomes of bat-SL-CoVZC45 (GenBank ID: MG772933), bat-SL-CoVZXC21 (GenBank ID: MG772934) and RaTG13 (GenBank ID: MN996532) viruses are overall quite similar to that of SARS-CoV-2, most notably with respect to ORF8 (Chan et al., 2020b; Chen LJ et al., 2020; Cui HZ et al., 2020) . There are currently several characterized ORF8 variants encoded by the SARS-CoV-2 genome (Ceraolo and Giorgi, 2020; Chan et al., 2020b; Cui HZ et al., 2020; Dong et al., 2020; Zhou P et al., 2020b) . The full implications of these observations await further understanding of the function of ORF8 within SARS-CoV-2. Likewise, the primary host source of SARS-CoV-2 should be confirmed in the near future.",

As such, the S protein plays a central role in the initial transmission and ongoing infection of SARS-CoV-2. The coronavirus S protein includes two main domains: the S1 domain at the N-terminus of the protein mediates binding to ACE2 and the C-terminal S2 domain promotes fusion of the virus membrane with cellular membrane of the host cell (Hofmann and P\u00f6hlmann, 2004; Li, 2016) . The receptor-binding domain (RBD) is a subdomain of S1 that includes 424-494 aa. This motif comes into direct contact with the extracellular binding site on ACE2 known as the peptidase domain (PD) (Li et al., 2005; Wrapp et al., 2020) . There are two cleavage sites in the S protein, arginines R667 and R797. The R667 site is at the division between S1 and S2 and cleavage at the R797 site results in the final S2 polypeptide (Millet and Whittaker, 2015) . Numerous cellular proteases can cleave the S sequence at these two sites, including cathepsin L, trypsin, elastase, serine transmembrane proteases (TMPRSSs), and factor Xa, among others. Cleavage at both S protein sites is essential to promote entrances of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 into the host cell; the first is critical for S1 binding to ACE2 and the second is essential for membrane fusion (Li, 2016; Millet and Whittaker, 2015) .",

Within the S1 domain, the N-terminal region is overall less conserved (51%), while the C-terminal RBD subdomain has relatively high conservation (74%), thereby permitting interactions with the same cell surface receptor ACE2 (Jaimes et al., 2020) . There are four to five distinct changes in amino acid sequence within the S1 RBD domain of SARS-CoV-2 compared to SARS-CoV. These amino acids include X442, F472, C479, and N487 that are included in the S protein sequence of SARS-CoV-2 (Zhou P et al., 2020b) . These changes within a critical motif in S1 RBD domain may serve to influence receptor-mediated binding and ultimately the transmissibility of the new coronavirus. Several groups have already explored this issue. For example, Wrapp et al. (2020) found that binding of quantities as low as 15 nmol/L of the S1 domain of SARS-CoV-2 could be detected at the ACE2 using optical biosensing via surface plasmon resonance.",

The transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 is directly associated with the sequence of the S protein, which includes one of the sequence insertions detected in the genome of SARS-CoV-2 (Heurich et al., 2014; Millet and Whittaker, 2015) . A four-residue insertion has been found in the S protein directly adjacent to the cleavage site . TMPRSSs have been identified as contributing to both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infections; TMPRSS and TMPRSS11a can catalyze the cleavage of the S protein to S1 and S2 (or S2') domains at the sites of both R667 and R797 residues (Heurich et al., 2014; Millet and Whittaker, 2015) . In combination with R685, the four amino acids in the insertion, P681, R682, R683, and A684, can form an exposed loop; this will result in an increased sensitivity to proteases. The insert sequence has also generated a cleavage site for the protease, furin (Jaimes et al., 2020; Meng et al., 2020) . Hoffmann et al. (2020) and Meng et al. (2020) confirmed that TMPRSS1 and TMPRSS2 may be the proteases activating S protein and then contributing to SARS-CoV-2 binding and cell entry. Furthermore, Jaimes et al. (2020) and Walls et al. (2020) reported that the loop formed by the inserted residues increased S protein susceptibility to protease-mediated cleavage, which facilitated SARS-CoV-2 infection. The insertion sequence is unique and has not been found in any other known coronaviruses, not even RaTG12 coronavirus from the bat (Jaimes et al., 2020; Zhou P et al., 2020b) .",

The viral infection is cytopathic to human airway epithelial cells and alveolar cells as well. However, similar to what was observed in response to SARS-CoV, immune-mediated injury may play a critical role in the pathogenesis of COVID-19, notably among those who are critically ill due to severe disease. Viral infection of pneumocytes induces local inflammatory responses and promotes the release of cytokines, including transforming growth factor-\u03b21 (TGF-\u03b21), tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2), IL-6, as well as numerous chemokines that serve to recruit circulating leukocytes (Razzaque and Taguchi, 2003) . In severe forms of COVID-19, the ensuing inflammatory cascade may lead to a cytokine storm, as observed in a recent study that documented elevated serum cytokine levels, including IL-2, IL-7, IL-10, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), monocyte chemotactic protein (MCP), and TNF-\u03b1 . The cytokine storm is believed to be a key factor driving both ARDS and extra-pulmonary organ failure (Li and Xu, 2010) .",

This observation may reflect functional compartmentalization due to the apparent recruitment of these cells into virus-infected lung tissue rather than any specific virus-mediated suppression (Xu Z et al., 2020) . Despite reductions in the total number, there is clearly an increased proportion of activated HLA-DR + CD38 + T cells in peripheral blood. Similarly, there is an increase in the fraction of CCR4 + CCR6 + Th17 cells, a subgroup of CD4 + T cells with cytotoxic functions similar to those characterized for CD8 + T cells (Xu Z et al., 2020) . As such, these primary data suggest a critical role for T cells in modulating the COVID-19-related lung inflammatory response, although mechanistic studies performed with appropriate animal models and human lung specimens will most certainly be needed to evaluate this issue further.",

Bats are natural hosts of many of the known coronaviruses (de Wit et al., 2016) . As noted earlier, SARS-CoV-2 is a \u03b2 coronavirus; sequence similarities between SARS-CoV-2 and \u03b2 coronaviruses isolated from bat species can be as high as 89.0% (Zhu N et al., 2020) to 96.2% (Zhou P et al., 2020b) , which indicates that SARS-CoV-2 may be derived from a predecessor coronavirus endemic in bats. Moreover, comparative studies revealed that the similarity between the nucleic acid sequences of the genomes of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV reached 79.5%, notably 73.8%-74.9% at the two receptor domains, both of which share ACE2 as a common receptor (Zhou P et al., 2020b; Zhu N et al., 2020) . Interestingly, the genomes of SARS-CoV-2 and the bat coronaviruses also differ, with about 1100 bp nucleotide divergence (Zhou P et al., 2020b) . It is also critical to recognize that the major outbreak emerged during the winter when bats are hibernating. As such, the data suggest that there may be one or more intermediate hosts that link the bat coronaviruses to those transmitted to humans.",

(2020) suggested that the SARS-CoV-2 intermediate host might be snakes; however, this contention has been questioned by many experts, given that snakes are cold-blooded animals (Class, Reptilia) whereas the intermediate hosts of SARS and MERS, the civet and the camel, respectively, are both homeothermic. The study of Guo et al. (2020) , which featured deep learning algorithms, suggested that minks (Order, Carnivora) may serve as the potential intermediate host, but no experimental evidence was provided to support this hypothesis. The pangolin is currently considered to be the most likely among the candidate intermediate hosts. A research team from the South China Agricultural University (Guangzhou, China) has identified a coronavirus strain from pangolins, which has 99% sequence similarity with SARS-CoV-2 (Kong, 2020) . The current leading hypothesis is that the bat-derived virus evolved to infect pangolins; after a series of mutations and recombination events, it has been transmitted to humans. However, the data from this research study have not been published yet. Meanwhile, Lam et al. (2020) have identified a coronavirus strain in the Malay pangolin with a genome that was similar to that of SARS-CoV-2 at 85.5%-92.4%. Of note, the Malay pangolin GD/P1L and GD/P2S coronaviruses are closely related to SARS-CoV-2. These results suggest that the pangolin may be a long-term host of these pathogens. Furthermore, a team from the China Animal Health and Epidemiology Center (Qingdao, China) tested more than 4800 poultry and livestock samples, and ruled out the possibility that SARS-CoV-2 could have its origins in poultry or livestock (Zhao and Lv, 2020) .",

In particular, asymptomatic patients constitute an unpredictable and insidious transmission source that cannot be identified promptly.

The transmission capacity of asymptomatic patients has been supported by a recent study that revealed that the dynamics of virus shedding was indistinguishable in a comparison between asymptomatic and symptomatic individuals (Zou et al., 2020) . This study also demonstrated that higher viral loads were a characteristic of the early stage of disease and were more readily detected from specimens on nasopharyngeal swabs than on oropharyngeal swabs. It is not at all clear at this time how long the capacity to transmit virus persists, but two independent studies reported that infected individuals can transmit virus during both the incubation (Rothe et al., 2020; Xu Z et al., 2020) and recovery periods (Rothe et al., 2020) .

The local government carried out a thorough and rigorous screening to identify all potential infected and infectious individuals and their contacts. Patients diagnosed with COVID-19 were admitted to hospitals or renovated provisional medical shelters, depending on the degree of disease severity at presentation; those whose disease progressed while in medical shelters were transferred to hospitals in a timely manner. All the aforementioned measures were enacted to ensure that all the patients were isolated and treated.

The incubation period (initial infection to symptoms) ranges from 0 to 24 d, with an average of 5-7 d . Individuals of any age are susceptible to infection, including neonates and pregnant women. Most patients present with mild to moderate symptoms. The most common symptoms are fever, dry cough, fatigue; upper respiratory tract symptoms can include pharyngalgia, headaches, and myalgia. There is also one report describing patients with gastrointestinal symptoms, including abdominal pain and diarrhea in children and adolescents (Xu Z et al., 2020) . In addition, asymptomatic patients have also been reported, although the frequency of this condition has not yet been determined. Approximately 20% of COVID-19 patients develop severe respiratory illness, with an overall case-fatality rate of about 2.3%. Patients with severe disease typically present with fever, dry cough, dyspnea, and bilateral pulmonary infiltrates on chest imaging. Complications of COVID-19 include ARDS, respiratory failure, liver injury, acute myocardial injury, acute kidney injury, septic shock, and even multiple organ failure. The risk factors for disease progression have not yet been established; however, preliminary evidence sug-gests that severe disease is more likely to take hold in individuals of older age, male sex, and in those with underlying co-morbidities. A study with 1099 confirmed COVID-19 patients was notable for the fact that about 23% had one or more underlying diseases, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (1.1%), hypertension (14.9%), diabetes (7.4%), coronary atherosclerotic heart disease (2.5%), and hepatitis B and liver cirrhosis (2.3%) . A national survey involving over 70 000 COVID-19 patients reported that more than 80% of the individuals who succumbed to the disease were older than 60 years of age and more than 75% had cardio-cerebral-vascular disease and/or diabetes. The milder forms of COVID-19 seem to be more commonplace in regions outside Wuhan; in a series of 62 patients in a cohort study carried out in Zhejiang Province of China, only one COVID-19 patient developed ARDS and none died in response to the disease (Xu XW et al., 2020) .",

Despite all therapeutic efforts, the mortality rate of patients in an intensive care unit (ICU) setting remains at about 40%. In efforts to reduce mortality related to severe COVID-19, attempts have been made to design therapies that either limit virus replication or modulate the host immune response. Among these, treatment with Arbidol, a broad-spectrum antiviral drug approved for influenza, has been introduced in a cohort of patients admitted to the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China (Xu KJ et al., 2020) . Likewise, systemic glucocorticoids, although controversial, have been explored in a series of patients with mild disease; this modality was well tolerated and viral shedding was not prolonged (unpublished data). A combination of glucocorticoid together with the antiviral immunomodulatory agent, interferon-\u03b1 (IFN-\u03b1), was also evaluated. Loutfy et al. (2003) reported that glucocorticoids together with IFN-\u03b1 can quickly reverse pulmonary imaging abnormalities and improve blood oxygen saturation in patients with Fever and/or respiratory symptoms; multiple limited patchy shadows and interstitial changes in chest imaging Severe Dyspnea with a respiratory rate of >30 breaths per minute; resting oxygen saturation below 95% or arterial blood oxygen partial pressure/oxygen concentration \u2264300 mmHg (1 mmHg=0.133 kPa); multi-lobular disease or lesion progression of >50% within 48 h; sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) of \u22652 points; pneumothorax and/or other clinical conditions requiring hospitalization Critically ill Respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation; septic shock; additional organ failure SARS. Similarly, a blood purification treatment method known as Li's artificial liver has been reported to play a beneficial role in alleviating the cytokine storm and can reduce the complications including shock, hypoxemia, and acute respiratory distress in critically ill patients (Xu KJ et al., 2020) .",

These modalities could be tested rapidly on patients currently diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection. 8.2.1 Neutralizing antibodies targeting virus S protein ACE2 has been identified as a cellular entry receptor of SARS-CoV-2, similar to that identified for SARS-CoV (Zhou P et al., 2020a) . SARS-CoV-2 entry starts with the S protein binding to ACE2 on the cell surface, after which the viral nucleocapsid is delivered into the cell prior to virus replication. The S protein is involved in receptor recognition as well as virus attachment and entry, both of which are attractive targets for the development of drugs to treat COVID-19. Neutralizing antibodies that target the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 may provide temporary, passive immunity to the disease (Zhao et al., 2016) . The full genome sequence of SARS-CoV-2 (GenBank: MN908947.3) was clarified and disclosed to the public shortly after the pandemic originated in Wuhan, China. This allows scientists to perform gene synthesis in order to express the S protein as an immunogen (Chan et al., 2020b) . CR3022 and CR3014 developed by Crucell (the Netherlands) are human monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that can neutralize the original SARS-CoV. These mAbs block the interaction between S protein and its cellular receptor ACE2 and thus completely prevent inflammatory pathology in the lungs of SARS-CoV-infected animal models (ter Meulen et al., 2006) . Considering that the novel virus SARS-CoV-2 has high sequence similarity to the SARS-CoV virus, these two antibodies may be promising and might be evaluated for the treatment for COVID-19.",

Another anti-influenza medication favipiravir, an inhibitor of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), is also under consideration for randomized clinical trials for COVID-19 (ChiCTR2000029544, ChiCTR2000029600) Lu et al., 2020) . Given the available knowledge on the safety profiles and efficacy against closely related viruses, existing antiviral agents are potentially helpful short-term strategies to combat SARS-CoV-2.",
