For many years, medicine has been using molecular biology methods of a rapid viral diagnosis that is beneficial not only for the individual patient but also results in the economic benefits for the country (Van-Tam and Sellwood 2013). The most cost-effective way to combat influenza is prevention and vaccination. Viruses infecting epithelial cells of the respiratory tract cause a diverse defense response of the organism and try in different ways to avoid the immune mechanisms aimed at eliminating infectious agents (Globinska and Kowalski 2012 ). An understanding of ways by which viruses avoid body's antiviral response may serve as a tool for developing new methods for treatment of respiratory diseases. The integrated epidemiological and virological influenza surveillance system conducted in Poland , as well as international projects such as I-MOVE, significantly contribute to the evaluation of the spread of the influenza and other respiratory viruses in the population investigated.
