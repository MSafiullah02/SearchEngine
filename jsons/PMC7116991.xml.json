            "text": "Throughout history, infectious diseases caused by viruses have posed a serious threat to human populations worldwide. In recent times, Ebola virus caused more than 11,290 deaths in Africa [1], and over 160 people were infected with Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus in South Korea [2], illustrating the devastating effects of viruses on international communities. Influenza A virus, the causative agent of influenza in birds, can also lead to highly infectious respiratory disease in mammals. Viral genome mutations (antigenic drift) and periodic gene segment reassortment between humans and animals (antigenic shift) can result in the emergence of new viral pathogens, with the potential to cause serious pandemics. During the past 100 years, pandemic influenza occurred in 1918, 1957, 1968, and 2009 [3]. The most severe pandemic, in 1918, resulted in approximately 40 million deaths worldwide [4], while the most recent pandemic, the Swine flu pandemic of 2009, emerged in 214 countries and caused more than 18,000 deaths, according to a World Health Organization report [5]. Highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza was first identified in Hong Kong [3]. As the high pathogenicity of such a strain and the lack of host protective immunity against such viruses continue to threaten lives, effective infection control measures are crucial for the prevention of serious outbreaks.",

Viral transmission occurs through direct person-to-person contact or through the uptake of contaminated airborne droplets or contact with contaminated surfaces [6]. The use of antiviral materials is an effective way to inactivate viral particles in the environment preventing viral transmission and thereby lowering the risk of infection [7], [8]. For this purpose, solid-state inorganic compounds such as metal oxides are good candidates because of their chemical robustness and their feasibility for use as a coating material. Copper and silver have been recognized for their biocidal properties since ancient times [9], [10]. However, unlike their ionic forms (Cu2+ and Ag+), the biocidal properties of solid-state copper and silver compounds such as CuO, Cu2O and Ag2S, that are poorly soluble in water, remain to be fully elucidated.",

The inactivation of bacteriophages is mainly mediated by direct contact with solid-state copper(I) compounds, rather than exposure to reactive oxygen species or leached copper ions. Here, we investigated the antiviral activities of four groups of compounds, solid-state copper compounds (Cu2O and CuO), a copper ionic compound (CuCl2), a solid-state silver compound (Ag2S), and silver ionic compounds (AgNO3 and Ag2O), against pathogenic influenza A virus and bacteriophage Q\u03b2. The effects of these compounds on the surface proteins of influenza viruses, hemagglutinin (HA), and neuraminidase (NA), were also investigated to reveal mechanistic insights into viral inactivation by these compounds.",

Ethanol suspensions of the compound particles were uniformly spreading on glass slides (2.5 cm \u00d7 2.5 cm), followed by heating at 120 \u00b0C for 3 h for sterilization. The particles were spread at 2.1 \u03bcmol metal (copper or silver), corresponding to 0.24 g/m2 for Cu2O, 0.27 g/m2 for CuO, 0.36 g/m2 for Ag2O, and 0.42 g/m2 for Ag2S. Although Ag2O is moderately water-soluble, glass samples were prepared with the same procedures as other solid-state compounds. In the case of water-soluble compounds, CuCl2 and AgNO3, the dried particles (0.45 g/m2 for CuCl2 and 0.57 g/m2 for AgNO3) from the ethanol solution on the glass substrate at room temperature were used to avoid oxidation by heating treatment.",

Thus, the antiviral activity of two types of viruses with different surface structures, H1N1 influenza A virus (A/PR8/H1N1) and bacteriophage Q\u03b2, on the surfaces of solid-state copper or silver compounds was evaluated. Influenza A virus possesses a viral envelope, a cell membrane-like structure that encases its central core, while bacteriophages lack an envelope, instead their surface is composed of protein capsids. These two viral suspensions were inoculated onto glass slides loaded with Cu2O and CuO particles. After incubation for specified time periods, the viruses were harvested and the viral titers were evaluated by determining the TCID50/mL (Fig. 1\na). The titer of influenza A virus drastically decreased on contact with Cu2O particles by over 3 orders of magnitude after 30 min exposure to 2.1 \u03bcmol copper amount (log10(N/N0) = \u22123.7). By contrast, the CuO-loaded sample showed no reduction (log10(N/N0) > \u22120.01) in influenza A viral titer after 30 min exposure, indicating a significant difference in the antiviral activities of different oxidation states of copper oxide. Borkow et al. reported that copper oxide-impregnated face mask largely inactivate human influenza A and avian influenza virus (log10(N/N0) \u223c \u22123) within 30 min [9]. Since the oxidation state of copper was not discriminated in their paper, our results suggest that the active compound of the material would be only Cu2O.",

On the other hand, the study on the anti-influenza activity of Cu(II) ions revealed that the virus titer decreased by two orders of magnitude after 1 h even at high concentration (250 \u03bcM) [19]. Another study by Imai et al. reported that purified influenza viruses are inactivated by 5.5-log fold reduction after 48 h treatment at high concentration (500 \u03bcM) [20]. Among the copper compounds, solid-state Cu2O appears to be the most effective inhibitory agent against influenza virus. Similar findings were observed with the nonenveloped bacteriophage Q\u03b2 (Fig. 1b) [11]. In fact, the titer of bacteriophage Q\u03b2 decreased by six orders of magnitude after a 30 min incubation with Cu2O particles (log10(N/N0) = \u22125.8), whereas CuO particles and Cu(II) ions had little effect on viral titer (log10(N/N0) = \u22120.088 and \u22120.24 for CuO and CuCl2, respectively). These results showed that solid-state cuprous compounds, in sharp contrast to solid-state cupric compounds or cupric ions, are highly effective at inactivating viruses regardless of the viral envelope.",

In Fig. 2\na, AgNO3, which has high aqueous solubility, and Ag2O, which has moderate aqueous solubility (0.025 g/L), markedly decreased the titers of influenza virus (log10(N/N0) = \u22126.3 and \u22126.3 after 30 min exposure of AgNO3 and AgO, respectively) after 30 min exposure. By contrast, Ag2S, which is insoluble in water, showed no decrease in viral titer (log10(N/N0) = \u22120.042) after 30 min exposure. These results indicated that the decrease in influenza viral titer depends on the solubility of silver ions from the compounds. Exposure to Ag2O, AgNO3, and Ag2S inactivated bacteriophage Q\u03b2 by three (log10(N/N0) = \u22123.3), two (log10(N/N0) = \u22121.7), and one (log10(N/N0) = \u22121.3) orders of magnitude within 60 min, respectively (Fig. 2b). Several studies also showed strong anti-influenza effects of silver nanoparticles [21], [22], [23], which seems similar to our findings. Compared with influenza virus, the inactivation of bacteriophage Q\u03b2 by Ag2O and AgNO3 decreased more slowly, indicating that water-soluble silver compounds such as AgNO3 and Ag2O are not effective against the nonenveloped virus. Furthermore, insoluble silver compounds such as Ag2S, were unable to inactivate either virus. These results imply that different inactivation mechanisms exist between influenza and bacteriophage viruses in response to exposure to silver compounds.",

On the other hand, it would be useful to evaluate the antiviral activity using crude viral suspensions for applications of these materials in real environments [20]. Thus, we evaluated antiviral activities of Cu2O against influenza A virus containing 0.1 and 1 mg/mL bovine serum albumin (BSA), including the protein amount in allantoic fluids (0.2\u20130.4 mg/mL). Influenza viruses on the exposure to Cu2O were inactivated in the presence 1 mg/mL BSA, whereas the viral inactivation efficiency significantly decreased (log10(N/N0) = \u22122.8, \u22122.8 and \u22121.7 with 0, 0.1 and 1.0 mg/mL BSA, respectively, at 20 min exposure) with the increase of the amount of coexisting protein. Similar tendency has been found in anti-influenza activity of another metal oxide material (TiO2) [12]. These results suggest that the inactivation efficiency of copper and silver compounds would be affected by coexisting proteins and that the antiviral activity in the real environment would be lower than that under controlled laboratory condition.",

Influenza virus expresses hundreds of HA and NA proteins on the surface of its envelope. HA is a glycosylated lectin protein that recognizes sialic acid residues on the receptor proteins of host cells [24]. Once influenza viruses bind through the HA-sialic acid interaction, they can enter host cells through endocytosis. NA is an endoglycosidase that is necessary for the release of viruses from the surface of host cells and is also involved in the initiation of influenza infection [25].

By contrast, the HA titer after treatment with CuO did not change over 30 min (Fig. 3\na). For highly sensitive detection of NA activity, the 1,2-dioxetane derivative of sialic acid (NA-STAR) was used as a chemiluminescence substrate.

In addition, HA activity was significantly decreased over a range of Cu2O concentrations (0.001\u20130.01 \u03bcmol), whereas NA activity was not affected under the same conditions (Fig. 4a, b). This difference in the dose response between HA and NA activities suggests that influenza virus inactivation by solid-state Cu2O at low concentration mainly originates from the inhibition of HA protein. On exposure to silver ionic compounds, NA activity was lost at a lower metal concentration than observed with Cu2O (Fig. 4b), suggesting that silver ionic compounds inactivate the virus by preferentially losing the enzyme activity of NA.

Like other proteins, HA and NA proteins possess multiple disulfide bonds that stabilize their structure. A previous report detailed a method for determining the total concentration of thiols by evaluating by fluorescence of monobromobimane using trypsin inhibitor protein, which possesses two S\u2014S bonds and one cysteine residue per molecule, as a model protein [26].

Copper and silver ions such as CuCl2, AgNO3, and Ag2O inactivate influenza viruses and also inhibit NA enzyme activity at low concentrations, indicating that the biocidal activity of such ionic compounds is mainly mediated by NA inhibition. In addition, these ions were able to induce protein destabilization through the breakage of S\u2014S bonds. Disruption of the disulfide bonds in NA may result in loss of enzymatic activity because mutation of cysteine residues in NA has been reported to significantly impair enzyme activity [29]. By contrast, solid state Cu2O inactivated viruses with or without viral envelopes (influenza virus and bacteriophage Q\u03b2) and preferentially inhibited HA activity. HA is involved in host cell recognition through ligand\u2013receptor interactions on the cell surface. Our previous study revealed that the major biocidal effect of Cu2O is mediated when viruses come in direct contact with metal-coated solid surfaces [11]. Thus, direct contact of the protein with Cu2O would cause the structural denaturation of HA, resulting in impaired ligand\u2013receptor recognition. This idea is supported by the efficient inactivation mediated by solid-state Cu2O of bacteriophage Q\u03b2, a virus possessing capsid proteins on its surface instead of a viral envelope. Like HA inactivation, the denaturation of the surface proteins in bacteriophage Q\u03b2 can inhibit infection into host bacteria. Such inactivation effects are distinct from those observed for ionic copper and silver compounds in our study. The denaturation of protein structure is partially caused by the cleavage of S\u2014S bonds; however, Cu2O decreased the thiol concentration by approximately half despite the high antiviral activity, which is weaker than the effects of ionic copper and silver compounds. These results suggested that Cu2O can denature protein structures by other mechanisms, such as disorder of hydrogen binding networks or ionic interactions in protein surfaces. We found that there are significant differences of protein adsorption and denaturation between Cu2O and CuO [11], which might cause the opposite antiviral activities. Although interactions between proteins and solid surfaces have been studied [30], the effects of solid-state Cu2O on viral protein structure following direct contact require further clarification.",

            "text": "In conclusion, we evaluated viral activity in response to exposure to copper and silver compounds and demonstrated that the antiviral mechanism of these metals against influenza viruses is mediated by inactivation of HA and NA surface proteins. Comparative analysis of these compounds revealed that the antiviral effect of Cu2O significantly differs from that of other ionic copper and silver compounds. With respect to influenza virus, one of the major strategies to control virus transmission is vaccination. However, vaccines are typically not effective against newly emerged viruses owing to the lack of suitable target antigens [31]. Inhibitors of NA, such as oseltamivir (Tamiflu\u00ae) and zanamivir (Relenza\u00ae), are also currently used as anti-influenza drugs. Despite their reported efficacy, it is likely that influenza viruses will gradually develop resistance to these drugs [32]. Combined with current strategies, the utilization of inorganic chemicals containing copper and silver as anti-influenza materials would potentially reduce the risk viral transmission in the environment. In particular, solid-state Cu2O has superior activity against both types of viruses, enveloped and nonenveloped compared with silver compounds, because of its unique inactivation mechanism mediated by direct contact. Furthermore, Cu2O is low-cost and widely available as a surface coating agent in various material surfaces and air-cleaning filters. Cu2O can also be combined with other biocidal coating chemicals such as photocatalytic TiO2 nanoparticles [33]. The use of Cu2O for the treatment of both public and living spaces may help limit, or even prevent, future influenza pandemics.",
