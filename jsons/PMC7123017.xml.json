The hybridization of the two Au-nanoprobes with the target resulted in the formation of a polymeric network (cross-linking mechanism), which brought AuNPs in close vicinity to cause a red to blue color change, which can readily be detected visually, or by UV\u2013vis spectroscopy (Fig. 3b).\n",

They developed a \u201cspot-and-read\u201d colorimetric detection method for the identification of DNA sequences. In this assay, the color change of DNA-modified gold probes was detected after spotting onto a glass surface illuminated by a light beam. This light-scattering method allowed detection of DNA in zeptomole quantities without signal or target DNA amplification. In comparison to the absorbance-based methods, this approach allowed a 4 order of magnitude increase in sensitivity. This way, it was possible to detect the mecA sequence gene in methicillin-resistant directly from genomic DNA samples. The system showed high sensitivity with a limit of detection (LOD) of 66 ng/\u03bcL of DNA. Following the same approach, several groups were able to develop methods for human immunodeficiency virus type 1 [9] and [10] with direct detection capabilities, allowing to circumvent expensive enzymatic DNA amplification reactions. Recently, Weigum et al. developed an amplification-free molecular assay for the detection of Cryptosporidium parvum oocysts [11]. The assay targeted the C. parvum 18 s rRNA, with an LOD of 4 \u00d7 105 copies of RNA per \u03bcL per reaction mix. The ability to detect the C. parvum oocysts without the need for complex amplification is of utmost relevance in resource-limited settings where protozoan detection is needed the most.",

Earlier methods used enzymatic amplification techniques, such as PCR, asymmetric PCR, and NASBA [14\u201319]. Recently, Zagorovsky and Chan reported on the integration of a multicomponent DNA-responsive DNAzyme with colorimetric detection using AuNPs, allowing for nonenzymatic signal amplification [20]. This constitutes a simple and fast colorimetric approach for the detection of DNA targets of bacteria, viruses, and parasites (LOD of 50 pM). This method is also able to detect multiple sequences in parallel. The color readout discards the use of complex equipment that makes it suitable for POC assays. More recently, this same approach was used for the naked eye and direct (amplification-free) detection of Kaposi\u2019s sarcoma-associated herpes virus [17] and Salmonella sp. [16]. Kalidasan et al. reported the detection of unamplified DNA from Salmonella sp. with an LOD of 37 f. for visual detection.",

            "text": "Baptista and coworkers developed an inexpensive approach for the colorimetric detection of DNA sequences [21]. This method uses just one Au-nanoprobe, instead of the two required in the cross-linking method (see previous section). Detection is achieved after comparison of the solutions\u2019 color following salt addition. The presence of a complementary target does not allow nanoprobe aggregation, and the solution retains the original red color; non-complementary/mismatched targets allow gold nanoprobe aggregation, and the solution turns blue. The first clinical application of this strategy was in the rapid and sensitive detection of [22] (Fig. 3c). The gold nanoprobes were functionalized with thiol-modified oligonucleotides harboring a sequence derived from the pathogen\u2019s RNA polymerase \u03b2-subunit gene sequence. This methodology had been previously tested in clinical samples and, if associated to PCR, shows great sensitivity [21]. This protocol was further used for the rapid detection of M. tuberculosis complex (MTBC) members and simultaneous identification of mutations linked to antibiotic resistance [23]. LOD was determined at 75 nM. Using a set of three Au-nanoprobes based on the gyrB locus, specific identification of MTBC, M. bovis, and M. tuberculosis was easily achieved [24]. Considering application at POC, Baptista and colleagues integrated this non-cross-linking method in an optoelectronic platform (an amorphous/nanocrystalline biosensor and a light emission source) that assesses the colorimetric changes. This low-cost simple platform may be of use once integrated in a microfluidic test device for improved TB diagnostics with a tenfold reduction of reagents [25\u201327]. Recently, in an effort to increase sensitivity and ease of use, this detection strategy was integrated onto a paper-based platform [28]. Differential color scrutiny is captured and analyzed with a generic \u201csmartphone\u201d device to evaluate assay results and perform RGB analysis. The possibility to send the acquired information to a central lab is also considered via 3G technology. GPS location may be added to each test image, which would provide actual epidemiologic data on MTBC (Fig. 4).\n",

Liandris et al. optimized the non-cross-linking approach described above to the detection of TB without the need for target amplification [31]. The detection is based on the fact that double- and single-stranded oligonucleotides show distinct electrostatic behaviors. Hybridization leads to double-stranded DNA formation, which cannot uncoil sufficiently to expose its bases toward the Au-nanoprobe. Therefore, the Au-nanoprobe aggregates under the acidic conditions of the test. More recently, Padmavathy et al. reported on the visual direct detection of Escherichia coli without the need for nucleic acid amplification. This approach is able to detect ~54 ng for unamplified genomic DNA, while reducing the overall time for detection to less than 30 min [32].",

Microarrays, streptavidin\u2013biotin stripes, and lateral flow cytometer systems are usually based on this method [36, 37]. Although each method varies in the building block, all share the same principle: a DNA probe is fixed on a support in the form of stripes or spots, followed by sample DNA hybridization to the fixed probe [38\u201341]. The second probe, consisting of AuNPs functionalized with 5\u2032-thiol-modified oligonucleotides (the Au-nanoprobe), is then hybridized to a second region of the target sample DNA. Total complementarity with both probes prevents the Au-nanoprobes from being removed by washing and yields the final assay result after signal enhancement by silver deposition (Fig. 5). Sandwich-based assays are being developed in a lateral flow strip scheme with increased sensitivity and are today a suitable alternative for the detection of PCR amplicons [37, 42\u201347].\n",

Later, Cao and coworkers developed a similar method using a visual DNA microarray using Au and Ag stain together with multiplex asymmetrical PCR. This approach allowed for the simultaneous detection of Ureaplasma urealyticum and Chlamydia trachomatis. The surface immobilized 5\u2032-end-amino-modified oligonucleotides, acted as capturing probes to bind the complementary biotinylated targets. Au-streptavidin conjugates specifically bind to biotin, and agglomeration was enhanced with silver for enhanced colorimetric signal. The sensitivity of this assay has been much improved by combination with silver/gold deposition to enhance light-scattering properties and further decrease detection limits, allowing visual or optical detection (e.g., image scanner). Using a similar approach, Zhao and coworkers developed a microarray platform using AuNP-based genomic microarray assay for specific identification of avian influenza virus H5N1 RNA [41]. Viral RNA was detected within 2.5 h using capture-target-intermediate hybridization, and AuNP triggered silver staining, without target amplification or any enzymatic reactions (LOD of 100 f. for purified PCR amplicons and TCID50 units for H5N1 RNA).",

Their approach consists on the adsorption of a synthetic ssDNA probe complementary to the target [50]. Whenever the target is present, the ssDNA probes and target hybridize and stop being available to stabilize the AuNPs. Despite a clear colorimetric visual detection, the use of hyper-Rayleigh scattering measurement allowed for an increase in sensitivity of two orders of magnitude. Shawky et al. used the same method using clinical samples to detect the presence of HCV RNA [51]. The isolated RNA was added to a solution containing the complementary oligonucleotide probe, and after a denaturing and annealing cycle, unmodified AuNPs were added. This extremely simple and inexpensive assay, which does not include an RT-PCR step, presented a detection limit of 50 copies/reactions and exhibited a sensitivity of 92 % and a specificity of 89 %. A similar approach using an S1 nuclease to discriminate single mismatches in DNA with unmodified AuNPs was proposed, in which dNMPs adsorb to AuNPs stabilizing them further in relation to ssDNA [52]. In the presence of a mismatch between the synthetic oligonucleotide and the DNA sample, the S1 nuclease degrades ssDNA\u2013ssRNA hybrid into its monomers (dNMPs), which increase the stability of AuNPs in solution. Also using an enzyme-mediated process, [53] tested the activity of ribonuclease H (RNase H) activity of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase. In the presence of RNase H activity RNA\u2013DNA hybrids are formed, otherwise ssRNA remains in solution adsorbing to the AuNPs. [54] took advantage of asymmetric PCR to generate long ssDNA amplicons that stabilize AuNPs in solution after salt addition. However, if no amplification occurs, no long ssDNA amplicons are present, leading to AuNPs aggregation due to the increasing ionic strength (LOD set at 10 ng of target DNA).\n",

The extraordinary quenching of fluorophores by noble metal NPs prompted the development of several new approaches with remarkable sensitivity and specificity. Gold nanoprobes can take advantage of the interesting luminescent properties of AuNPs for molecular diagnostics. In fact, AuNPs can cause fluorescence enhancement or quenching of chromophores in their vicinity. Chromophores within ca. 5 nm of the surface of the AuNP have their fluorescence quenched by non-radiative pathways, while chromophores at larger distances (>10 nm) show a fluorescence enhancement of up to 100-fold [55\u201358]. The quenching properties of AuNPs have been applied in two approaches: molecular beacons, which rely on NPs functionalized with fluorescent-labeled hairpin structures, and AuNPs nanoprobes with ssDNA that hybridize to another fluorescent-labeled ssDNA probe [59]. Molecular beacons, i.e., AuNPs functionalized with fluorescent-labeled ssDNA where the NP act as a fluorescence quencher via the NP surface energy transfer occurring between the dye (donor molecule) and the NP\u2019s surface (acceptor). On the other hand, noble metal nanoprobes rely on NPs functionalized with ssDNA hybridized to a complementary fluorescent-labeled ssDNA probe. Since ssDNA naturally adsorbs to the AuNPs, the proximity of the fluorophore with the nanoparticle is close enough for a 98 % of quenching efficiency. In the presence of a complementary target, dsDNA is formed resulting in a spatial separation of the fluorophore from the AuNPs, thus restoring the fluorescence signal (Fig. 6).\n",

Deng Zhang et al. used a bio-barcode-type assay to obtain a fluorescence signal of PCR-amplified Salmonella enteritidis DNA [61]. In this type of assay, two types of nanoparticles are functionalized. Firstly, magnetic sulfo-SMCC-modified nanoparticles are functionalized with oligonucleotide sequence complementary to the sample DNA. Secondly, AuNPs are bi-functionalized with an oligonucleotide sequence specific for the target (in lower percentage), and another sequence that contains a nucleotide sequence 3\u2032 modified with a fluorophore (in higher percentage). Both nanoparticles are mixed with the sample DNA and, in case of total complementarity, the sample DNA serves has linker of both nanoparticles. After the hybridization step, a magnetic field is generated to isolate hybridized NPs from non-hybridized ones, and the thiol bonds are broken releasing the fluorophore-labeled oligonucleotides (LOD of 21.5 fM). Ganbold et al. describe a similar method, but the synthetic probe is functionalized with a fluorophore whose fluorescence is quenched if the ssDNA is adsorbed to the particle but not if there is complementarity to the target [62]. Standard fluorescence signal is measured but there is also the possibility of using sub-aggregation conditions for Raman spectroscopic analysis. The method was tested with influenza A (H1N1) synthetic DNA and was able to discriminate single-base mismatches.",

The oscillation frequency of the piezoelectric sensor decreased with increasing weight at the sensor\u2019s surface (i.e., sandwich hybridization involving the target oligo, the sensor\u2019s probe, and the circulating DNA-functionalized AuNP). Thus, PCR products amplified from concentrations of 1.2 \u00d7 102 CFU/mL of E. coli O157:H7 were easily detectable. Wang et al. also used AuNPs to functionalize QCM for E. coli DNA detection, employing two sizes of AuNPs to increase sensitivity [73]. First, 18-nm AuNPs were immobilized onto the QCM surface to support the ssDNA probes that will bind specifically to the biotinylated DNA of target bacteria. The gold layer binds a higher number of ssDNA molecules to the QCM, thus increasing sensitivity. The biotinylated DNA from the target organism binds to the sensor, which is recognized by avidin-functionalized 70-nm AuNPs to further amplify the signal. This scheme was capable of detecting bacteria without sample enrichment showing an LOD of 2.0 \u00d7 103 CFU/mL. Recently, Hao et al. developed this method to detect Bacillus anthracis based on the recognition of a 168-bp fragment of the Ba813 gene and the 340-bp fragment of the pag gene in plasmid pXO1 [74]. A thiol DNA probe was immobilized onto the QCM gold surface to hybridize to the target ssDNA obtained by asymmetric PCR. The DNA-functionalized QCM biosensor could specifically recognize B. anthracis (and distinguish from its closest species, Bacillus thuringiensis) \u2013 LOD of 3.5 \u00d7 102 CFU/mL for B. anthracis vegetative cells without culture enrichment.\n",

            "text": "Recently several lateral flow strip-based devices have been developed. Chua et al. developed a typical design where the detector reagent recognizes the fluorescein haptens of PCR-amplified DNA target and produces visual red lines with a recorded LOD of 5 ng of DNA [87]. Rastogi et al. optimized this approach via the integration of locked nucleic acid conjugated Au-nanoprobes together with signal amplification protocols for as little as 0.4-nM DNA [40]. More recently, Rohrman et al. presented a lateral flow assay coupling NASBA RNA amplification with Au-nanoprobes and gold enhancement solution to quantitate amplified HIV RNA [88]. These results suggest that the lateral flow assay can be integrated with amplification and sample preparation technologies, allowing viral load testing to monitor therapy response in limited resource setting.",

In fact, the minimum number of AuNPs that can be detected by the naked eye against a white background is around roughly 1010. Assuming one molecule of target molecule per AuNP, ten femtomoles may be detected, which compares negatively to the amount of target analyte in a sample that is usually one million less [82]. An alternative to diminish this difference can combine detection with amplification techniques. These can either focus on the target, such as PCR or antigen concentration, or on the assay development, such as by silver enhancement. The conjugation of silver enhancement and microfluidics allows the exploitation of multiple protein and nucleic acid targets in a bio-barcode format. Nevertheless, the cost of manufacture of these microfluidic devices remains a problem, and the technology for POC use in detection protocols is still under development; thus, translation to the clinical setting remains a challenge.",
