In 11 months between the spring of 1918 and the winter of 1919, it killed approximately 50 million people worldwide (Johnson & Mueller, 2002; Patterson & Pyle, 1991). The morbidity pattern, together with the rapid disease progression to multiorgan failure and death, characterizes the influenza pandemic (Honigsbaum, 2018). So far, its origin, its unusual epidemiologic features, and the basis of its pathogenicity remain elusive (Taubenberger & Morens, 2006).",

Knowing the origin of the virus might be a key for uncovering its epidemiologic features and pathogenicity basis (Reid & Taubenberger, 1999). However, there are two controversies regarding its origin. The first one is whether the virus originated from mammalian IVA reassortment or directly from an avian virus (Antonovics, Hood, & Baker, 2006; Gibbs & Gibbs, 2006; Taubenberger, 2006; Vana & Westover, 2008). And, the second one is whether homologous recombination shaped the formation of the virus (Gibbs et al., 2001; Worobey, Rambaut, Pybus, & Robertson, 2002).",

However, this interpretation was questioned by several other groups because some genes of the virus were obviously clustered into swine or human branches in IVA phylogenetic trees (Antonovics et al., 2006; Gibbs & Gibbs, 2006; Vana & Westover, 2008). Therefore, the virus is considered a reassortant from mammalian IVAs (Smith et al., 2009).",

Novel virulent variants of several other viruses have been shown to be generated through homologous recombination (Parrish et al., 2008; Sabir et al., 2016; Worobey, Rambaut, & Holmes, 1999). It was thus proposed that homologous recombination also occurred in the HA gene and resulted in the increased virulence associated with the pandemic (Gibbs et al., 2001). Unfortunately, the recombination event was doubted because of the complete absence of phylogenetic evidence for recombination in HA (Worobey et al., 2002).",

The open reading frames (ORFs) of the M1 and M2 genes share the first nine codons at the N\u2010terminus, and the C\u2010terminus of M1 overlaps with a region of M2. M1 consists of 252 AAs, while M2 consists of 97 AAs encoded by an alternatively spliced transcript. Lining the inner layer of the viral membrane and contacting the ribonucleoprotein (RNP) core, M1 is highly conserved and is the most abundant protein in viral particles (Reid, Fanning, Janczewski, McCall, & Taubenberger, 2002). M1 regulates the nuclear export of viral RNPs (Bui, Wills, Helenius, & Whittaker, 2000; Martin & Helenius, 1991), restricts viral replication (Liu & Ye, 2002), inhibits viral transcription in the late stages of infection and the switch from replication to viral assembly (Perez & Donis, 1998; Ye, Baylor, & Wagner, 1989) and influences virus assembly and budding (Gomez\u2010Puertas, Albo, Perez\u2010Pastrana, Vivo, & Portela, 2000; Helenius, 1992; Latham & Galarza, 2001). Anchored in the viral envelope, M2 serves as a transmembrane ion channel (Lamb, Zebedee, & Richardson, 1985; Sugrue & Hay, 1991) and plays key roles in both virion uncoating and viral budding (Grambas & Hay, 1992; Pinto, Holsinger, & Lamb, 1992).",

Referring to previous studies (Smith et al., 2009; Vana & Westover, 2008), eight segments of classical strains of different species (human, avian, swine, and horse) and A/Brevig Mission/1/1918(H1N1) were respectively concatenated to analyze the potential reassortment or recombination event between viruses of different species in A/Brevig Mission/1/1918(H1N1). Employing basic local alignment search tool (BLAST), reassortment between viruses of different species in these representative genomes was checked through comparing their sequence identity with IVAs deposited in GenBank (https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi). Based on sequence identity to the query segment, the host species distribution of the top 100 sbjct viruses is shown in Table S1. Except for PB1 of A/chicken/Rostock/45/1934 (H7N1) that may be associated with human IVA, no other reassortment events were found in these representative viruses. To dissect the phylogenetic history of the M segment of the Spanish flu virus, 23 viruses of different years (from 1902 to 2012) and different species were selected.

The 2009 virus is a triple reassortant virus of swine origin that contains gene segments from swine, human and avian influenza viruses (Garten et al., 2009), but it does not have the high virulence as the Spanish flu virus. Unlike the 2009 virus, the Spanish flu virus is considered not to have acquired genetic material from avian IVA via reassortment or recombination (Antonovics et al., 2006; Gibbs & Gibbs, 2006; Smith et al., 2009; Vana & Westover, 2008). However, the Spanish flu virus has multiple proteins carrying the unique AAs of the avian branch, suggesting its progenitors had infected avian before its outbreak; and thus, the mutations adaptive to birds might have been fixed in virus genome during circulation in avian host (Basler et al., 2001; Reid et al., 1999, 2004, 2000; Taubenberger et al., 2005). Interestingly, in this study, by introducing a bird IVA lineage isolated in the early 20th century into the dataset, we found that the NA and NS segments of the Spanish flu virus are more likely from avian IVA. Moreover, approximately 300 nt fragment of its M segment is also inherited from avian IVA. These results provided direct evidence for the avian origin of the virus.",

This could also result in the change of host tropism and virulent phenotypes, as occurred with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) (Lemey, Rambaut, & Pybus, 2006) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (Sabir et al., 2016). Even for negative RNA viruses, recombination has also been responsible for outbreaks of bovine ephemeral fever virus in cattle (He et al., 2016), bat rabies virus in skunk and raccoon (Ding, Xu, Sun, He, & He, 2017) and severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome bunyavirus in human (He & Ding, 2012). For the Spanish flu virus, Gibbs et al., (2001). proposed its HA was recombined from human and swine IVAs, and the recombination played the key role in the outbreak of the virus. However, this recombination evidence was thought to be invalid because the phylogenetic histories of HA were not different in the regions inside and outside the proposed recombination breakpoints (Worobey et al., 2002). Here, we provided robust phylogenetic evidence that the M segment was a chimera inherited from a human virus and a bird virus, showing that homologous recombination does be the important genetic mechanism driving the formation of the Spanish flu virus, although recombination might infrequently occur between IVAs.",

This determines the host difference (Matrosovich & Klenk, 2003). However, outbreaks of avian IVAs, such as H5N1 and H7N9, have been found in human being (Nga et al., 2019), suggesting that avian IVA can potential infect human. Several studies have also shown that HA of H7N9 can bind both human\u2010 and avian\u2010type receptors (Belser et al., 2013; Watanabe et al., 2013; Zhang et al., 2013). Therefore, it is not strange that the Spanish flu virus is a mosaic from avian and human IVAs.",

Its progenitor (a human flu virus) occasionally infected birds. During circulation in avian host, the virus obtained the NA and NS segments via reassortment and the 300 nt M segment through recombination from avian IVAs, and later jumped back to humans and caused the devastating pandemic. However, it is difficult to trace when the recombination event in the M segment took place because the real parents of the Spanish flu virus cannot be identified. Therefore, we are not sure to what extent this recombination affected the virus.",

Moreover, PB2 can also increase the virulence of the virus (Malaspinas, Malaspinas, Evans, & Slatkin, 2012; Qi et al., 2018). Here, we found that the recombination has shaped a new M segment that is significantly different from any avian and mammalian IVAs, which may give the virus a unique biological phenotype. It has been known that the disease course and pathological damage caused by the virus are associated with the capability of replicating to titers higher than those of other strains (Wolbach, 1919). The M protein is the regulator of IVA growth (Yasuda, Bucher, & Ishihama, 1994; Yasuda, Toyoda, Nakayama, & Ishihama, 1993). Small changes in M can have large effects on replication phenotype (Reid et al., 2002). M can also affect the virulence of the virus (Brown, Liu, Kit, Baird, & Nesrallah, 2001; Smeenk, Wright, Burns, Thaker, & Brown, 1996). Through the recombination, the Spanish flu virus acquired the seven unique AAs from the avian IVA in M1 and M2. Previous studies have shown that the mosaic proteins might have given the Spanish flu virus a high replication capacity. The recombinant M segments of its offspring strains PR34 (A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (H1N1)) and WSN33 (A/WSN/33 (H1N1)) (Figure S2) have been shown to confer high\u2010growth characteristics in single\u2010gene reassortant strains (Yasuda et al., 1994), suggesting that the recombination may give the Spanish flu virus a high replication power, and thus, influence its pathogenicity.",
