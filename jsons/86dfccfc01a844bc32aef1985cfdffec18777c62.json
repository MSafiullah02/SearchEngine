In the face of a sudden infectious disease outbreak, contact tracking systems can help medical professionals quickly locate and isolate infected persons and high-risk individuals, preventing further spread and a large-scale outbreak of infectious disease. Furthermore, the transmission networks of infectious diseases established using contact tracking technology can aid in the visualization of actual virus transmission paths, which enables simulations and predictions of the transmission process, assessment of the outbreak trend, and further development and deployment of more effective prevention and control strategies. Exploring effective contact tracking methods will be significant. Governments, academics, and industries have all given extensive attention to this goal. In this paper, we review the developments and challenges of current contact tracing technologies regarding individual and group contact from both static and dynamic perspectives, including static individual contact tracing, dynamic individual contact tracing, static group contact tracing, and dynamic group contact tracing. With the purpose of providing useful reference and inspiration for researchers and practitioners in related fields, directions in multi-view contact tracing, multi-scale contact tracing, and AI-based contact tracing are provided for next-generation technologies for epidemic prevention and control.",

However, the sudden emerging infectious diseases caused by the drug resistance and the inherent variability of viruses still remains to be a serious global problem that often leaves us in an unprepared and vulnerable situation. For example, the H1N1 flu in 2009 mutated to become the H7N9 flu in 2014 and the H3N2 flu in 2015. The H3N2 virus began to spread through contact networks in Hong Kong in January 2015, and 122 lives were taken in just one month [8] . The death toll rose to 591 after three months. Thus, in the fight against various kinds of infectious diseases, relying solely on vaccine development is far from enough. A more effective ''active prevention and control'' method is desperately needed so as to rapidly detect and block FIGURE 1. The spatial distribution of H7N9 cumulative cases in the early stage of the outbreak in mainland China in 2013 [10] . In this case, infected cases are recorded with the information of location and time, while the contact information dominating transmission remains unknown.",

In computational epidemiology, a contact is simply defined either as a direct physical interaction (e.g. sexual contact) or proximity interaction (e.g. to people being within 1m of each other, or being in the same room) [9] . Human contact interactions constitutes a ''contact network'' of virus transmission. In this network, nodes represent individuals, and links represent contact relationships. The structure of the contact network significantly affects the spatiotemporal patterns of virus spread. For example, in the case of respiratory infections that spread through droplets, interactions like face-to-face communication, shaking hands, crowd gathering, and sharing vehicles enable the spread of diseases and increase the possibilities of transmission from infected to susceptible persons. Tracking the contact interactions of individuals can effectively restore the ''invisible'' virus transmission paths, quickly locate and isolate high-risk individuals who were in contact with infected persons, and can aid in quantitative analysis of the transmission paths, processes, and trends of the infectious diseases, all leading to the development of corresponding effective epidemic control strategies.",

Because contact interactions between individuals are diverse and often subtle, they are difficult to be directly observed and recorded. In other words, it is hard to obtain first-hand high-quality data for contact tracking. When a disease is spreading, the impact of the disease could be observed, instead of the underlying direct interactions between individuals. For example, during the outbreak of H7N9 bird flu, it is difficult to identify who were infected due to contacts with certain infected people. As shown in Fig. 1 , only new H7N9 cases and the number of deaths in different time and space can be observed.",

They found that at least 20.3 percent of adult men have had sexual contact with another man in life, and never-married men are more likely to have same-gender sexual contacts [34] . Similarly, Merino et al. [35] sampled 294 homosexual men from Colombia as volunteers to answer questionnaires on sexual practices. Analysis of these questionnaires suggests two significant risk factors for HIV-1 infection: 1) having sexual contact with foreign visitors; 2) having more than ten homosexual partners. They suggest that the spread of HIV-1 infections should be monitored at the international level and more attention should be paid to these subgroups with high transmission rates.",

However, after adjustment for covariate, it reported that unsafe sex is associated with other factors, e.g., gender, age, ethnicity, status of partner, having occasional partners, living alone, etc. In recent years, researchers designed questionnaires to measure the validity and reliability of sexual abstinence and avoidance of highrisk situations.

[38] surveyed 250 HIV-positive persons on their socio-demographic characteristics and sexual behavior, and traced HIV infection status of 431 persons who had heterosexual contact with the HIV carriers. Among these 431 persons, 59 were HIV-positive, i.e., the secondary attack rate was 13.7%. Therefore, they appeal to improve the knowledge about HIV/AIDS, enhance psychological education, and promote the use of condom, so as to suppress the transmission of HIV.",

The Zika virus is primarily transmitted by Aedes species mosquitoes. However, by reviewing the travel experience and sexual intercourse of infected individuals in the US, researchers confirmed that there were 14 cases of Zika virus infection were transmitted by sexual contact [40] . For instance, a person in Texas was getting infected with the Zika virus after sexual contact with someone who had acquired the infection while travelling abroad [41] . In 2012, Molinari et al. [7] investigated the contact interactions of 1,074 students in a high school through questionnaires. A local campus contact network was established based on information such as the length of contact time and contact frequency.

Influenza-like illness (ILI) outbreaks on a large scale every year in many countries, recording and detecting ILI are important public health problems. Flutracking, a weekly web-based survey of ILI in Australia, has been used to record the past and current influenza immunization status of participants in winter influenza seasons for many years [43] . It only takes the participants less than 15 seconds to complete the survey, including documenting symptoms, influenza vaccination status, and mobility behaviors such as time off work or normal duties. In 2008, the peak week detected by Flutracking was 31 August, which was contemporaneous with that in other influenza surveillance systems [44] . For the first three years being applied, the participants increased from 394 to 982 and 4,872 in 2006, 2007, and 2008, respectively, due to its convenience in completing the survey and its accuracy in detecting the peak week of influenza activity. Flutracking also provides vaccine effectiveness analysis by investigating the status of vaccinated and unvaccinated participants. In 2012, the ILI weekly incidence peaked in mid-July in the unvaccinated group, 1 month earlier than vaccinated group confirmed by national influenza laboratory [45] . In recent years, by cooperating with the health department, organizational email systems, and social media, Flutracing gained over 1000 new participants each year by sending invitations from existing participants. As a result, the number of online participants in Flutracing has exceeded 26,000 in 2016 [43] .",

Then, they simulated an influenza outbreak on this network using a SEIR model. In view that the large power consumption of GPS and Bluetooth resulted in short standby time of mobile phones, Yoneki and Crowcroft [17] further developed a new contact tracking application, EpiMap, using wearable sensors, which had lower power consumption and longer standby time. EpiMap thoughtfully transmits and stores data by satellite, as many high-risk areas are in developing countries where there often are not enough wireless communication facilities to support contact tracking.",

For example, MIT Media Lab researchers Nathan Eagle and Alex Pentland proposed the reality mining method as early as 2006. This method suggests the use of wearable wireless sensors to record people's daily activities [13] , [14] . They developed an experimental system to record the activities of several MIT students in a teaching building over time, and then established a small social network describing their contact relationships [15] . Salath\u00e9 et al.

It was found that the campus contact network had high density connectivity and a small-world structure [19] . However, it is costly to trace contact interactions using wearable wireless sensors, especially when the number of individuals being monitored is large. Moreover, people wearing wearable wireless sensors are very conspicuous, participants are unwilling to wear such devices due to privacy concerns especially for patients.",

Similarly, Yoneki [16] collected students' contact data from a French primary school using radiofrequency identification devices. More recently, in October 2016, IBM researchers Kurien and Shingirirai from Africa Labs invented a radio tag designed to extend tracker working distance, and implemented it in tracking tuberculosis ( Fig. 2) [6] . Each tag contains a tiny sensor, FIGURE 2. An IBM researcher holds a micro-radio tuberculosis tracker [6] . In October 2016, IBM researchers from Johannesburg, South Africa, released their latest research update: using cheap radio tags to anonymously track the contact transmission paths of tuberculosis. This study is an important step for IBM in helping WHO eliminate tuberculosis. a storage device, and a battery. Radio tags can communicate with each other, allowing individuals' contact interactions to be recorded when two tags are in close proximity. The contact data collected by the radio tags is presented in a three-dimensional visualization system. Using of the intelligent data analysis method provided by the system, medical staff can view the spatiotemporal distribution of tuberculosis patients in real time, track the transmission paths of tuberculosis, and find high-risk populations. Because of the high cost of tuberculosis vaccines, contact data can also aid in the determination of high-priority vaccinations. However, the traditionally used radiofrequency tracker has a limited transmission and receiving range and only works within a small area.",

[47] investigated the mobility patterns using GPS tracing data collected from 95 older adults in Vancouver, Canada, with the goal of understanding neighborhood influences on older adults' health. They found that participants who were younger tend to drive more frequently and live far from their neighborhoods. GPS devices have also been used for tracing physical activities of adolescents in school and other social settings [48] - [50] . For instance, Rodriguez et al. [49] sampled 293 adolescent females in Minneapolis and San Diego, USA, and traced their physical activity and sedentary behaviors by GPS every 60s in different settings. Physical activities were more likely to occur in parks, schools, and places with high population density during weekend, less to occur in places with roads and food outlets. Besides, tracing animals in the sea or on the land using GPS devices can obtain detailed spatiotemporal data regarding the movement patterns. For instance, Dujon et al. [51] traced a green turtle travelling more than 300002km across the Indian Ocean and obtained more than 450,2000 locations. Moreover, by tracing the whole-body motion dynamics of a cheetah using GPS devices, Patel et al. [52] illuminated the factors that influence performance in legged animals.",

Such models not only simulate the transmission process, but also depict the contact structure of a larger population. The composite group model divides the population into several meta-populations by age or spatial location, so that individuals within a meta-population have similar biological characteristics (such as susceptibility, infectivity, latent period, and recovery period). Then, the process of epidemic transmission can be modeled using group contact interactions among meta-populations instead of individuals' contact interactions [23] . Based on this model, the infection and spread of epidemics can be described as a reaction-diffusion process. ''Reaction'' characterizes the process of individual infection within a meta-population. ''Diffusion'' characterizes the transfer process of epidemic diseases between different meta-populations through the group contact structure (Fig. 3 ). In addition, there is a practical significance in establishing contact networks for composite groups because control strategies for epidemic diseases are usually oriented towards composite populations, for example, vaccination groups are usually sectioned by age when planning vaccine allocation strategies. [23] . The diffusion process is illustrated from a macroscopic perspective, i.e., the transmission among different meta-populations, whereas the reaction process is illustrated from a microscopic perspective, i.e., the individual infection within a meta-population.",

[24] conducted the Polymod research project in Europe, in which they organized a wide-range survey on contact behaviors, involving VOLUME 7, 2019 7,290 participants from eight European countries. A total of 97,904 contact records were collected. They found that contact interactions have significant spatial heterogeneity, with most individual contacts occurring at home (23%), work (21%), school (14%), places of entertainment (16%), and while using transportation (3%). Further, contact structures under different scenarios have obvious differences. There are some age-related contact patterns: in many scenarios (such as in schools), individuals are more likely to contact people of similar age; most of the contact between children and their parents occurs at home, while most contacts for adults occur in workplaces. The researchers thus divided the population into several meta-populations, establishing a composite group model based on age. Interaction probabilities between different age groups were estimated according to questionnaire data (Fig. 4) , and a contact network based on composite groups was established. The simulation method based on multi-agent models is also applied to the establishment of contact networks. This generally involves combining the questionnaire survey with population census data to establish the contact structure of composite groups. Iozzi et al. [9] modeled a virtual society with the characteristics of Italian society based on questionnaire data from 55,773 people. Human daily migration behaviors were simulated by a virtual community, and a contact matrix of the composite group was obtained. Based on this matrix, the outbreak process of Italian B19 (human parvovirus) was successfully simulated. Similarly, Eubank et al. [26] simulated the movement of individuals within a city by large-scale agent system, and then modeled a group contact structure based on their simulation. The data they used included population census data, land usage, population migration, and other daily behavior data.",

Tuberculosis patients in African countries are branded with social prejudice, making wearing an identifier a sensitive issue [6] .

Then, small-scale contact network within the tracing regions can be constructed and the diffusion process of infectious VOLUME 7, 2019 disease such as influenza can be simulated and analyzed in detail. However, the use of mobile phone is limited to tracing short-term contact behavior because of large power consumption of GPS and Bluetooth. Wearable wireless sensors can only be applied to small-scale population due to its high cost and privacy concerns. RFID devices are convenient carrying which solves privacy concerns very well, but it only can be used for short range collection. GPS device has the advantage of long-distance positioning. However, it is costly to capture indoor mobility behaviors due to the requirement of communication stations [57] . All these automatic contact tracing methods have not been used for studies of large-scale individual contact so far.",

Using a contact matrix of meta-population, contact patterns regarding people with similar features can be depicted from the macroscopic level. However, the contact matrix is usually constructed using the data collected from a nationwide questionnaire, which is static and can only represent the contact patterns of the past. To explore dynamic contact patterns of meta-population, a data-driven AI (artificial intelligence) method was adopted, i.e., tensor deconvolution [25] . Based on this method a dynamic evolutionary model of the group contact was constructed and dynamic contact patterns were inferred inversely through insights into the time-dependent nature of the infectious disease surveillance data. Nevertheless, it should be noted that although it can characterize a wider range of dynamic contact behaviors, it cannot be used to accurately locate unique contact events because of the coarse granularity of the captured contact behaviors.",

Static group contact patterns can be depicted by a coarse granularity contact matrix constructed by large-scale questionnaire data, dynamic contact patterns, however, can only be inversely inferred using data-driven AI technologies. Both individual and group contact tracing are promising research directions and filled with challenges, especially for dynamic contact tracing.
