With the initial main symptom of diarrhoea, the patient visited relatives at an apartment complex, and more than 300 residents were infected, with leaky sewage pipes being the most likely route of virus spread. As the floor drains of the bathrooms and kitchens were connected to the sewage pipes, backflow of contaminated aerosol into other apartments via these routes could have transmitted the virus. Also, leaky sewage pipes could have allowed infectious aerosols of faecal material to escape into the narrow light well between the buildings. Although the primary mode of transmission is close contact with virus-contaminated droplets, preliminary studies have suggested that the virus may also be found in large quantities in urine and faeces from infected individuals.",

In phase 2, which represents an immunopathological imbalance, the major findings are the recurrence of fever, oxygen desaturation, and clinical and radiological progression of acute pneumonia. This phase is concomitant with falls in the viral load. The majority of patients respond to treatment in this phase, but about 20% may progress into phase 3. This phase is characterized by an acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) which commonly necessitates mechanical ventilation.
