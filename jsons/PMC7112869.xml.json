            "text": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a highly infectious atypical pneumonia with proximity 10% mortality in all infected cases [1]. Etiologic analysis has identified a novel coronavirus named the SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) [2]. SARS-CoV spike protein, the major determinant of pathogenesis and the main target of protective immunity response, is composed of two non-covalently associated S1 and S2 domains [3], [4], [5], [6]. The N-terminal S1 domain is responsible for viral attachment with the cellular receptors, and the membrane-spanning fragment S2 domain takes part in the host cell entry and the infected cell\u2013cell fusion. Recently, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) has been identified as the functional receptor for SARS-CoV, and a neutralizing human monoclonal antibody 80R against ACE2 can block the binding of S1 domain to sensitive Vero E6 cells [7]. The ACE2-binding domain locates within the N-terminal residues 318\u2013510 aa of spike protein, which has a higher affinity to ACE2 than the full S1 domain (residues 12\u2013672 aa) [8].",

Since human SARS antibodies emerge only 1 week after the onset of symptom, the development of specific monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against SARS-CoV spike protein is vital for early diagnosis and even the neutralization of SARS-CoV infection [5]. It has been shown that a single intrasplenic injection of plasmid DNA encoding foreign protein provides an effective and fast method to generate specific mAbs [9], [10], [11], [12]. The splenocytes including antigen-presenting cells are directly transfected by the injected plasmid DNA, and the expressed antigens are concentrated in the spleen, initiating the immune response promptly. In this study, we performed single intrasplenic immunization of plasmid DNA encoding one fragment of ACE2-binding domain in SARS-CoV spike protein (S1-3) to establish specific mAbs in a short time and evaluated this mAb with murine leukemia virus pseudotyped with SARS-CoV spike protein (MLV/SARS-CoV). The mAb could recognize the spike protein on the Vero E6 cells infected with MLV/SARS-CoV, but has no neutralizing effect on the infectivity of the pseudotype virus.",

            "text": "With immunoinformatics, we analyzed S1 domain in the SARS-CoV spike protein and selected fragment S1-3 (residues 430\u2013454 aa) as the immunogen. Plasmid DNA encoding S1-3 was injected directly into the spleen of BALB/c mice to trigger immunological reaction. The antisera were analyzed with an ELISA plate coated with synthetic polypeptides or SARS-CoV lysates. In our preliminary experiment, all intra-spleen immunized mice showed positive immune response from day 5, and the sera titer peaked as 1:104 at day 7, much faster than protein or intramuscular DNA immunization. Therefore, we performed the hybridoma fusion 7 days after intra-spleen injection of pcDNA-S1-3. Some investigations demonstrated that it was possible to obtain good hybridoma production within a very short immunization time and irrespective of the antibody response of the intrasplenic immunized animal [10], [12]. The antibody responses of immunized mice were crucially determined by the expression of antigen in transfected spleen cells, which was concerned with the natural trait of the encoding antigen and the expression vector used. In the 24 hybridoma clones, 3E8 was subcloned and the mAb was determined as IgM isotype. Culture supernatants and ascites of 3E8 recognized synthetic S1-3 polypeptide specifically in ELISA assay. We also established mAb against SARS-CoV nucleoprotein (N protein) by single-shot intrasplenic inoculation of plasmid encoding an epitope (residues 20\u201349 aa) of N protein. Specific anti-N antibodies could be detected in mice at day 5 with ELISA kit coated with synthetic N protein fragment or SARS-CoV lysates (data not shown). These data suggested that S1-3 in the spike protein and fragment of N protein were potent epitopes, and single intrasplenic injection of eukaryotic expression plasmid coding antigens is efficient to induce specific antibodies in a short time, much faster than the protein or intramuscular DNA immunization.",
