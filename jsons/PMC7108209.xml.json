Specimens were obtained from nasopharyngeal swabs or sputum in nonintubated patients and from tracheal aspirates or bronchoalveolar lavage in intubated patients [15].

We calculated stabilized weights for the probability that each subject received the treatment, censored on the day of therapy, ICU discharge, or 28-day mortality, whichever came first. We included in this model selected baseline characteristics as well as time-dependent variables (SOFA on the index day of RBV/rIFN initiation and the previous day, ventilation status on the index day and on the previous day [0: not ventilated, 1: noninvasive ventilation, 2: invasive mechanical ventilation, 3: oxygen rescue therapy], hemoglobin, WBC count, AST and creatinine on the index day, and corticosteroid therapy on the index day). We included corticosteroid therapy as a time-varying covariate, as we have shown previously that corticosteroid therapy in critically ill MERS patients might prolong MERS-CoV RNA clearance although it was not associated with difference in mortality [19]. Because these values were recorded on days 1, 3, 7, 14, and 28, we imputed missing values for the remaining days (Supplementary Methods). We used a weight-trimming approach to deal with extreme weights; weights <5th percentile value were fixed at the 5th percentile value and weights >95th percentile value were fixed at the 95th percentile value. This process continued until the average weight reached approximately 1. Then, we used a weighted regression model using these weights taking in consideration the repeated-measures nature of the data to estimate the association of RBV/rIFN with 90-day mortality.",

First, it has been shown that the RBV concentrations required to inhibit MERS-CoV replication are much higher than clinically achievable concentrations with oral dosing [5]. Second, the lack of rIFN effectiveness may be related to the type used. One study examined the in vitro MERS-CoV susceptibility to different rIFN preparations (rIFN-\u03b12b, rIFN-\u03b3, rIFN-universal, rIFN-\u03b12a, rIFN-\u03b2) and found that rIFN-\u03b2 had the strongest MERS-CoV inhibition, at 41 times lower than the previously reported 50% inhibitory concentration (56.08 U/mL) of rIFN-\u03b12b [5]. Another in vitro study found that serum concentrations achievable at therapeutic doses of rIFN-\u03b2-1b were 3\u20134 times higher than the in vitro inhibitory concentrations of MERS-CoV, whereas those of other rIFN preparations and RBV were lower than inhibitory levels [24]. Of note, none of the patients in the current cohort received rIFN-\u03b2-1b. An RCT (MIRACLE) is currently recruiting patients examining the effect of a combination of lopinavir/ritonavir and rIFN-\u03b2-1b on mortality of hospitalized patients with MERS [16]. Third, the positive, but modest, effect observed in previous rhesus macaque experiments occurred after very early treatment (8 hours after inoculation of with MERS-CoV) and with the administration of high doses of RBV/rIFN-\u03b12b. In contrast, it took a median of 5 days for patients in our cohort to present to the hospital and another 4 days to start therapy.",
