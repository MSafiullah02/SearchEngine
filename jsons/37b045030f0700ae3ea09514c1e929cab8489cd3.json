Generally, seed coat morphology is species specific. Nevertheless, similarities among species in seed coat organization, particularly, outer testa anatomy and wall thickening-pitting patterns allow the recognition of six groups among examined taxa; furthermore, seed coat features often suggest both intra-group and inter-group relationships. Recognized groupings do not correspond well with the more classicial treatments of Nama; rather, they suggest that a restructuring of the infrageneric and even the generic taxonomy of Nama is in order.",

            "text": "The excellent classical treatment of Nama provided by C. L. Hitchcock (1933 Hitchcock ( , 1939 continues as the major source of information regarding the genus. Hitchcock recognized 40 species, ranging from delicate annuals to robust, woody perennials. These were distributed among five sections: Arachnoidea (1 sp.), 0nerascentia (1 sp.), Zonolacus (1 sp.), Conanthus (2 spp.), and Nama (as Eunama, 35 spp.). Subsequently, additional species have been recognized, one in sect. Conanthus and the remainder in sect. Nama, so thattheir number now totals about 50. Each of Hitchcock's smaller sections is well defined and segregated from others by singularly notable characters. Indeed, sects. Arachnoidea and Cinerascentia are so well defined that their placement in Nama has been questioned (Bacon, 1974; Raven and Axelrod, 1978) . In contrast, sect. Nama houses a diverse assemblage of species, as noted by Hitchcock (1933) , and relationships among constituent taxa, as well as intersectional relationships, have yet to be fully explored. Hitchcock's (1933) observation that seeds of different species exhibit variously patterned surfaces offers a promising point of departure for studies aimed at elucidating relationships in Nama. Indeed, seed coats may retain ingenuous indications of phyletic commonality (Martin, 1946; Davis and Heywood, 1963; Esau, 1977) , and many recent studies in various, unrelated groups have confirmed the general utility of seed coat characters for assessing systematic relationships (e.g., Chuang and Heckard, 1972; Whiffin and Tomb, 1972; Hill, 1976; Clark and Jernstedt, 1978; Canne, 1979 Canne, , 1980 Elisens and Tomb, 1983) . We have examined the seed coats of 37 species of Nama utilizing scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and report implications of seed coat structure towards systematics of Nama.",

Variation appears to be primarily related to the number and position of ovules developing within the ovary (Amott, 1962; Tomb, 1974) .

The porous, honeycombed appear-ance of the upper Ih~h of the outer testa in N. rothrockii (Fig. 3) as well as the small gaps associated with papillose extensions (suggestive of cell junctions) in N. lobbii (Fig. 4) support this contention. We attribute surface patterning of the two to collapse of the upper tangential wall to the level of deposited material. Radial walls in N. rothrockii are essentially the same height; collapse of the upper wall results in a foveolate surface. Certain areas of the radial walls in N. lobbii are elongated and higher than the remaining wall; collapse of the upper tangential wall produces a papillose surface with each papillus being a wall extension. Hitchcock (1933) segregated N. lobbii and N. rothrockii into the monotypic sections Arachnoidea and Cinerascentia, respectively; the former species produces capsules which are loculicidally and septicidally dehiscent while other namas exhibit only loculicidal dehiscence. Nama rothrockii is the sole Nama with capitate inflorescences. Moreover, chromosome numbers have been determined for well over 3f4 ofthe species ofNama (Cave and Constance, 1947 , 1950 , 1959 Constance, 1963; Bacon, 1974) , and establish the genus as a strikingly diploid group with a base number of x = 7. N. lobbii is known only as tetraploid, n = 14, while N. rothrockii is even more radically divergent with n = 17. Seeds ofthe two species also diverge from the bulk of Nama. They are unique in terms ofsurface patterning and thickness of the outer testa layer among examined species. Indeed, features ofsize and coat thickness would argue that the two are more closely related one to another than either is to yet other namas. We perceive the former relationship as distant. Clearly, seed features support our opinion that inclusion of these two species in Nama is less than tenable.",

Its distinctive seed coat and habit suggests early divergence from ancestral stock out of which arose the desert species to the north. Indeed, this taxon may prove to be representative of a stock out of which Seed Groups 3, 4 and 5 all arose since, in many ways, seeds of N. prostratum are archetypical of seeds in all three groups. Significantly, branched thickenings are limited to the more vertically elongated portions of reticulum walls in N. prostratum as they are in N. johnstonii (they are found elsewhere only in the deeply reticulate coats of N. canescens and N. stenophyllum), while unbranched thickenings are found in the shorter wall portion, as they are found in the less deeply reticulate, symmetrical chambers of other Group 4 species. Moreover, unbranched thickenings commonly present on chamber floors of N. prostratum seeds often continue into the shorter wall of the chamber, much as those thickenings characterizing Group 5 species; all Group 5 species exhibit a shallower reticulum. Additionally, we suggest that concave reticulum walls in Group 3 species are merely an alternative manifestation of asymmetrical wall development. And, since thickenings may differ from pits only in degree, widening ofreticulate thickenings in N. prostratum could yield pits, as found in species of Group 3. However, we believe that N. prostratum is correctly housed, although well removed from other Group 4 species.",

Each thickening is continuous, from one wall across the chamber floor and into the adjacent wall; apices of thickenings, on collapse of the upper tangential wall, produce the characteristic knobs along the upper margin of each cell. Each of the included species is quite distinct morphologically and differs from the others in habit, leaf shape and size, pubescence and corolla shape, size and color. Hitchcock (1933) noted the similarities between the seeds of N. torynophyllum (Fig. 39) and N. parvifolium (Fig. 41) . It was his opinion, however, that N. parvifolium was most closely related to N. prostratum and, to a lesser degree, apparently, to If. rotundifolium. We have pointed out the 'potential relationshp of N. prostratum to Seed group 5, including N. parvifolium. We view it as remote. Seed features confirm a kinship between N. parvifolium and N. rotundifolium and, as Hitchcock implied, suggest it is not direct. For, were it not for its wider reticulum cells, seeds ofN. rotundifolium (Fig.40) would be essentially identical to those of N. torynophyllum (Fig. 39) . And, although producing well developed thickenings and a prominently knobbed reticulum as do the former species, seeds of N. parvifolium (Fig. 41) are much like those of N. serpylloides (Fig. 42) and N. rzedowskii (Fig. 43, 44 ). In these three species, reticulum cells are less elongated, broader and more irregularly arranged than in N. rotundifolium and N. torynophyllum. Seed features argue that N. serpylloides,N. rzedowskii and N. parvifolium are a related trio.",

Its reticulum cells exhibit clearly asymmetrical walls and in shape resemble those in Group 3. But, thickenings characteristic of Group 5 species are present in its reticulum cells (Fig. 37 ) and countenance its placement. Nevertheless, similarity of the seeds of N. hirsutum to those of Group 3 strengthen even more our previous postulations of a common stock from which Group 3, 4 and 5 arose; for its seeds recall, too, in their reticulum asymmetry, those of N. prostratum.

In many respects, seeds of N. origanifolium are reminiscent of those of Group 5. Indeed, in surface view wall undulations often suggest the \"u-shaped\" thickenings characteristic of the former group. However, in neither sections nor peels have we observed such thickenings and we attribute the resemblance to folds in the collapsed upper tangential waD where the wall encounters more prominent undulations. In fact, sections and peels reveal chamber walls to be characterized by pores in this taxon (Fig. 46 ) as well as in N. sericeum. With its irregular reticulum organization, N. sericeum (Fig. 48 ) also is reminiscent of seeds of certain species in Groups 3, 4 and 5. We are aware that the pores must be related to thickening-pitting alternatives. Further study may well prove these two species to have closer relatives elsewhere, but they are included herein due to their undulate walls and [Vol. 71 because four of the other seven species in this group exhibit similar pores in their chamber walls.",
