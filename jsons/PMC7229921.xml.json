Italy was the first European country to experience the outbreak, with a rapid spread of infection. The first fatality was on February 22, 2020 and a high mortality rate (>10%) followed.",

On February 23, 2020, the Italian Government placed almost 50,000 people residing in Lombardy and Veneto (Northern Italy) in strict lockdown. As a result, several Italian citizens headed into supermarkets and pharmacies to stock up on large quantities of supplies. Pasta, cookies, rice and other long shelf-life supplies disappeared in a few hours, as reported by several newspapers [2]. After a few weeks, the Italian government took other extraordinary measures to combat the diffusion of the disease, such as imposing a lockdown on the whole country. Beyond the immediate tragedies of death and disease, indirect effects mediated by fear and anxiety have taken hold of not only the general population, but also the stock markets and goods production and shipment, including importation of grains and food.",

CeD has been associated with certain infections in several papers [4], [5], [6]. A population-based cohort study in 2010 described an increased risk of hospital admission for influenza in patients with CeD [7]. A 2015 study found a 28% increased risk of community-acquired pneumonia in CeD unvaccinated subjects compared to controls (HR 1.28, 95% CI 1.02\u20131.60), with a higher risk of bacterial pneumonia also found in children. Hyposplenism associated with CeD might be related to this higher risk [8, 9]. Vaccination against Pneumococcus is therefore recommended. However, it is unclear whether additional vaccination against Haemophilus, Meningococcus and Influenza should be considered if not previously given [3, 10]. Moreover, beyond the risk of infection, it is known that CeD patients may suffer from anxiety and depression [11], [12], [13], [14], and the pandemic with the restrictions in place due to the risk of infection during this period might increase these conditions. Moreover, looking at the empty shelves in the supermarket, CeD patients might also fear the lack of gluten-free food.",

We also collected data on gender, date of birth, time of CeD diagnosis, the Italian region of origin (Veneto or Campania), compliance with the GFD using a four point Likert scale ranging from 1= bad, 2= good enough, 3= well, 4= perfect and if they had undergone the influenza vaccination. We investigated the presence of other comorbidities, in particular the presence of diabetes type 2, high blood pressure and dyslipidaemia, since it is known that the presence of comorbidities can lead to a worse outcome in regard to the COVID-19 infection [15]. The survey also included the questions of the CD-QoL [16] in the validated Italian version [17]. The CD-QoL is composed of 20 questions and its scores range from 20 to 100: the higher the score; the better the QoL. The patients also could write a short text entry. We calculated an average time of 10 minutes to complete the survey. The number of items of the questionnaire and the answering time were both devised to provide the best adherence and results.",

The vast majority of CeD patients of both regions reported good QoL, as assessed by a standardized questionnaire. QoL is a health status instrument that focuses on both physical and psychological symptoms, as well as impairments in daily function. We found that patients from Veneto had a lower CD-QOL score, probably because at the time of the questionnaire that region was considered a 'red zone' for the spread of infection with high mortality from COVID-19. Moreover, the most worried were the elderly patients, and patients with other comorbidities probably because they knew they were at greater risk of mortality [18]. The greater worry in females than males is in line with a Chinese study which described female gender associating with a greater psychological impact of the outbreak and higher levels of stress, anxiety, and depression [19], despite males having a worse prognosis if infected [20].",

We did not have a control group from the general population to evaluate the weight of the chronic condition of COVID-19 in the same areas.
