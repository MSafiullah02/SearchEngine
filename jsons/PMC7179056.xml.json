For medical educators, one emerging difficulty is how to ensure optimal learning for students when conventional approaches are constrained due to: (1) suspended or disrupted clinical services (thereby limiting students\u2019 and faculty members\u2019 ability to participate on a fixed schedule), (2) cancelled in-person activities (e.g., due to social distancing policies), or (3) inability for individuals to leave their homes (e.g., due to quarantine or childcare responsibilities).",

The curriculum is being run in real time, with each day focusing on a specific theme. All materials, including recordings of the live class sessions, are then freely available online. Though the intended audience is psychiatry residents and fellows, we anticipate that these materials could be useful for medical students or even for those in continuing medical education. Of note, each day\u2019s materials include assessment questions that allow for formative feedback.",

It creates virtual communities of learners (a crucial antidote to the forced social isolation). It leverages a collaborative approach in which a broad coalition of educators can each contribute a small amount to a larger product. By incorporating assessment metrics, we also hope that an online curriculum may create an enduring resource that will have value beyond the current crisis.",
