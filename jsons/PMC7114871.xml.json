            "text": "Influenza virus causes respiratory tract infections, and spreads by inhalation of virus-loaded aerosols or droplets, or via direct or indirect contact with infected individuals. Hospital outbreaks of influenza A have been described [1], [2], [3]. Patients, visitors and healthcare workers (HCWs) might be part of the transmission chain, and outbreaks may be facilitated within closed settings [4], possibly by contamination of hospital surfaces [5]. The relative importance of different modes of transmission is contentious; however, aerosol is suggested to be an important factor [6], [7], [8]. The epidemiological understanding of influenza transmission in healthcare settings is incomplete due to variations in case identification, source and route of transmission, patient-related factors, and the use of infection control measures. Outbreak reports of influenza from long-term care facilities have been of particular concern due to the high-risk population, but reports using laboratory confirmation combined with accurate clinical definitions have been rare [9]. Molecular characterization has commonly shown multiple viral strains during hospital outbreaks, reflecting simultaneous circulation of various strains in the community rather than hospital clustering [10], [11]. Prevention and control strategies are essential in controlling hospital outbreaks, as well as defining the onset and end of influenza seasons in the community [12]. Properly designed studies are needed to optimize preventive measures [13].",

Influenza B virus (InfB) is divided into two lineages, Victoria and Yamagata, and is mainly associated with smaller epidemics. Few reports have described InfB outbreaks in a hospital setting [14], [15], [16]. Whole genome sequencing has yielded insights into transmission dynamics in nosocomial outbreaks for other agents (e.g. carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae\n[17]) and community outbreaks of influenza A [18]. To the authors' knowledge, there have been no reports of hospital outbreaks including a detailed molecular characterization of InfB. This study identified one virus strain as the probable cause of multiple secondary cases, causing negative effects for both patients and hospital functions.",

The period of increased seasonal influenza activity in this area peaks from December to March, and this particular season lasted from 5th December 2015 to 23rd April 2016. Diagnostic services were provided by the virology laboratory at a larger teaching hospital, serving a population of approximately 700,000 inhabitants. The time between nasopharyngeal samples (NPS) being taken and laboratory confirmation was 12\u201348 h, depending on time of day and transportation logistics. The ward most affected by the outbreak (Ward A) has 25 beds but no isolation facilities (Figure A, see online supplementary material). In situations when the hospital is filled to capacity, inpatients might be placed in rooms not fully equipped for patient care. The mean bed occupancy rate for Ward A during 2016 was 106%, and the mean length of hospital stay was 5.4 days.",

Analysis of the severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak in Beijing identified a high number of close contacts, misdiagnosis and overcrowding as risk factors for \u2018super-spreading\u2019 in a hospital setting [31]. Intrahospital transfer of patients with suspected influenza within or between wards may be counterproductive, and may increase the number of exposed individuals.

Sequencing data are missing for Cases 10 and 4. The tree was constructed using the maximum likelihood method in Mega Version 5.1. Bootstrap values were obtained from 1000 replicates and values >70% are displayed on nodes. The EPI numbers shown in the tree correspond to haemagglutinin sequences in GISAID's EpiFlu Database (www.GISAID.org).",

Nucleotide positions that had identified variations compared with the index case are shown, with variable positions on the x-axis and case ID on the y-axis. Light grey, nucleotide variant based on sequence of index case (ID 1); black, altered nucleotide (SNV) compared with index case; blue, mixed nucleotide population; missing values, no sequence data obtained. Variants present at a frequency of at least 20% (in positions with coverage \u226520X) were included. In some cases, the coverage was <20X for some nucleotide positions, which were therefore not analysed for variants. Information regarding the identity of respective nucleotide alteration can be found in Table A (see online supplementary material). Variant detection and alignment of the sequences were performed with CLC Genomics Workbench (Qiagen). (B) Putative map for InfB transmission based on SNV analysis of the whole InfB genome and patient overlap within a ward. Nodes represent cases and arrows indicate transmission events, directly or indirectly, from one patient to another. Dashed open nodes represent cases where sequence data are lacking. Solid arrows indicate highly likely transmissions and dashed arrows represent possible transmission events. Yellow nodes, Group 1; green node, Group 2; red nodes, Group 3.",
