Italy is experiencing more deaths than China, the country where the infection originated, which continues to report 3,281 deaths. Since the infection was first identified in Codogno (Lombardy region) on February 21 st , in less than three weeks, COVID-19 overloaded the National Health Care System (Servizio Sanitario Nazionale, SSN) in the northern Italy. It turned the hard hit Lombardy region into a grim glimpse of what countries may expect if they cannot slow down the spread of the virus and ''flatten the curve'' of new cases, which in turn allow treatment of sick patients without overloading the capacity of hospitals. Italy established draconian measures by restricting movement and closing all stores except for pharmacies, groceries and other social essential services.

Overall, 839 out of 7,994 samples tested positive by qPCR (Fig 1) . Correlation between qPCR-negative/positive samples and age is showed in Table 1 and Fig 2. Out of 46 samples sent for NGS, 45/46 sequences were suitable for downstream analysis. Only one sequence was discarded as only few reads were obtained. Out of 45 sequences, 16 were complete or almost complete (horizontal coverage >95,2%) and with high vertical coverage. They were deposited with the GISAID database [15] ; as listed in Table 2 . All obtained sequences in this study showed >99% of nucleotide (nt) identity with Wuhan-Hu-1 (NC_045512) SARS-CoV-2 reference strain. However, all of them had SNPs with respect the reference Wuhan-Hu-1 sequence. All sequences either partial or complete, show a first common SNP mutation in the leader sequence (C241T) which is co-evolved with C3037T, C14408T, and A23403G resulting in amino acid mutations in nsp3 (synonymous mutation), RNA primase (P323L), and S protein (D614G), respectively. According to a recent published study, these three co-mutations are in critical proteins for RNA replication (C241T, C14408T) and the S protein (A23403G) for binding to ACE2 receptor [16] . These four co-mutations are prevalent in viral isolates from Europe. Strains from Abruzzo show 28144T in the ORF8 protein sequence, thus they have a leucin residue at position 84 in that accessory protein, and 8782C (S75 in nsp4); thus, these strains may be classified as S type [17] .

This decision arose by the combination of various relevant factors. Firstly, the IZSs belong to the SSN, coordinated by the MoH, and such condition facilitates the establishment of fruitful collaborations with the Public Health sectors, including the development of common diagnostic and data exchange protocols. Secondly, each IZS has the technical and scientific capacities to support the SSN to meet the extraordinary surge in demand for diagnostic testing of human samples for SARS-CoV-2. Lastly, IZSs have also experience in quality assurance, biosafety, biosecurity, and high throughput testing for the surveillance and control of infectious diseases in animals, some of which, humans, such as mutations in critical residues of the S protein or resulting in the loss of accessory genes as already described for SARS-CoV-1 [19] . An additional factor which may have influenced the choice of appointing IZSs to support the SSN's effort against COVID-19 was related to the biological nature of the occurring agent. CoVs act as primary actors within the so-called human/animal interface across which a plethora of infectious pathogens has been observed to emerge, spill over various species and eventually evolve, thus finding new ecological niches and causing new epidemiological phenomena. Of value, in the Italian context, is certainly the experience that veterinarians operating within the Public health system gained in the control and characterization of previous health issues of livestock and poultry including avian flu, bluetongue, foot and mouth disease, BSE which were responsible for huge economic losses. This aptitude of being \"ready to action\" during a health emergence certainly includes rapid diagnosis, epidemiological investigations, molecular/antigenic characterization, development of vaccines, and planning of surveillance programs, a process that is pursued, together with saving patients' lives in hospitals, by technicians and scientists around the globe for COVID-19. We add to this the fact that veterinarians have known of CoVs and related diseases for decades [5, 20] , thus, the One Health concept is central and should again be sublimated and adopted to control critical health emergencies, including that of antimicrobial resistance. Therefore, the multidisciplinary involvement of different professionals operating within the SSN is crucial to properly and effectively face the challenges posed by viruses like SARS-CoV-2. A holistic and One Health approach is the sole solution for better understanding the epidemiological aspect of this disease and possibly preventing the establishment of new transmission chains. Currently, the available genome sequences so far clearly reveal that the most closely related virus (96.2% of nt sequence identity) to SARS -CoV-2 is a strain from a bat, Rhinolophus affinis, identified as strain BatCoVRaTG13 from a faecal sample in Yunnan province, China; and that the next closest virus are SARS-rCoVs identified from pangolins [21] , however, the exact origin of SARS-CoV-2 has yet to be demonstrated. In this perspective, veterinary virologists may surely support this important task as well as those doomed to understan d SARS-CoV-2 virulence factors through the assessment of reverse genetics studies and animal models, and to analyze the impact of the hyperinflammation observed in COVID-19 infected patients, characterized by a cytokine storm.

The first include s virus inactivation (in BSL3 biocontainment laboratory) starting from a total volume of 200 \u00b5l of oropharyngeal (OF) swab transport medium (physiological solution) or bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and nucleic acid purification (MagMaxTM CORE) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The second consists of RNA detection by the TaqManTM 2019-nCoV Assay Kit v1 (Thermofisher, qPCR) whose results are interpreted following the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, this test targets three different portions of SARS-CoV-2 genome located in the replicase, the S and the N protein encoding genes, respectively. Laboratory activities are not limited to the molecular detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Selected positive samples showing low threshold cycle (C T ) values are regularly further processed by next generation sequencing (NGS) in order to obtain the whole genome sequence of the occurring strains.
