            "text": "Aberrant crypt foci (ACF) are used as biomarkers of colorectal cancer because they appear in the colorectum of rodents at an early period of carcinogenesis (1). Aberrant crypts (AC) are a few times larger than normal crypts, occurring as an oval shape in the thickened epithelium, and are easily detectable in whole mounts of the colonic mucosa with methylene blue staining (1). ACF look like adenoma and have high proliferative activity because the bromodeoxyuridine (2) or the proliferating cell nuclear antigen-labeling (3) index was higher in the crypt comprising ACF than in the normal crypt. In rodents exposed to chemical carcinogens, ACF and tumors develop in their colons (1,4\u20137). ACF appear at an early period of colorectal carcinogenesis and in the tumor-bearing state in rats after treatment with carcinogen (8), also in patients with sporadic and hereditary colon cancer (9). They can therefore be considered as putative early preneoplastic lesions. On the other hand, there are complicated results that ACF formation is inhibited by oral administration of cholic acid, which promotes the formation of colonic tumors (10\u201312). It is interesting to investigate the effect of dietary factors on the growth characteristics of ACF to evaluate the biological significance of ACF or to elucidate the mechanism of tumor formation thereafter.",

DMH, or azoxymethane (AOM), is frequently used as colonic carcinogen to investigate influence of dietary factors on carcinogenesis (16). DMH or AOM require conversion by intestinal bacteria into a carcinogen, methylazoxymethanol (17). Ionizing radiation is known to induce tumors in the colon (18,19) and to increase the risk of colorectal cancer (20). In this study, we investigated whether low dose and frequent irradiation could induce ACF in the rat colon by using \u03b3-rays as an ionizing radiation. We also studied the effects on the irradiation induced ACF of sugar beet fiber (SBF) as a dietary fiber source, and the involvement of apoptosis in ACF formation after exposure to radiation, using an apoptosis inhibitor, cycloheximide.",

They were \u03b3-irradiated on their abdomens once a week at doses of 2 Gy for six times or 3 Gy for four times. The total absorbed dose was identical between both groups (12 Gy). Rats were killed to collect their colons for ACF determination at 5 or 9 weeks after the first irradiation. In the experiment for the effects of ingestion of SBF on the irradiation-induced ACF, 32 Wistar/ST rats had been fed a fiber-free or an SBF diet from 5 days before irradiation. Three rats in every group were not irradiated and were kept as a control. The dose of irradiation was six times at 3 Gy, and the colonic ACF measurement was performed at 15 weeks after the first irradiation. In the experiment for suppression of apoptosis of colonic epithelial cells by CHX injection, rats were irradiated once and killed at 3, 6 or 9 h after the irradiation. For CHX-injection groups, CHX (1 mg/kg body wt; Sigma, St Louis, MO) was injected intraperitoneally into rats at 10\u201315 min before and 3 h after the irradiation. Control rats were injected with saline at the same time point. In the experiment for the influence of CHX injection and SBF ingestion on ACF induced by \u03b3-rays, 47 Wistar/ST rats were purchased. Three rats were not irradiated and were kept with fiber-free diet throughout the experimental period as a control. Forty-four rats were divided into two dietary groups (fiber-free or SBF) for 7 days after acclimatization, then irradiated three times at a dose of 3 Gy once a week (total 9 Gy). In each group, rats were injected with CHX or saline as described above. ACF determination was performed at 5 (CHX), 7 (CHX) or 9 weeks (CHX and saline) after the first irradiation. In the experiment for the effect of CHX injection and SBF ingestion on the irradiation-induced apoptosis of colonic epithelial cells, 36 Wistar/ST rats were divided into two dietary groups (fiber-free or SBF) for 3 days after acclimatization and irradiated once, twice or three times. The dose of irradiation was 3 Gy, once (after the first irradiation), twice (after the second irradiation) or three times (after the third irradiation). All rats were injected with CHX before and after irradiation as described above. CHX was not injected after the last irradiation in this experiment, because irradiation-induced apoptotic cells using the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT)-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) method were evaluated 1 h after the irradiation in these studies. These colons were removed 1 h after every irradiation and used for morphological evaluation of apoptotic epithelial cells to confirm whether CHX injection inhibits the irradiation-induced apoptosis of the colonic epithelial cells.",

Our previous result showed that dietary SBF significantly reduced DMH-induced ACF in the rat colon (15). The difference between these results is caused by a difference in the method for inducing ACF. One possible explanation is that a reduction of carcinogen-induced ACF by SBF was due to the enhancement of defecation and the excretion of carcinogen. To explain this difference, we must examine how dietary SBF influences ACF generation or development. In this connection, it is also interesting to investigate the effects of dietary cholic acid against irradiation-induced ACF. Comparing responses with dietary factors between the irradiation- and carcinogen-induced ACF will lead to useful information on the effect of dietary factors on the formation of ACF.",

We have shown that the administration of anti-asialo GM1 increased the number of DMH-induced ACF in the rat colon (15,21).
