For that, we solve the electrostatic problem of a conducting hyperboloid with an elliptical wormhole in the presence of an in-plane electric field. The localized surface plasmons (LSPs) on the NPG sheet allow for the control and tuning of the thermal emission spectrum in the wavelength regime from \u03bb = 3 \u00b5m to 12 \u00b5m by adjusting the size of and distance between the circular holes in a hexagonal or square lattice structure. Most importantly, the LSPs along with an optical cavity increase the emittance of graphene from about 2.3% for pristine graphene to 80% for NPG, thereby outperforming state-of-the-art pristine graphene light sources operating in the near-infrared (NIR) by at least a factor of 100. According to our COMSOL calculations, a maximum emission power per area of 11 \u00d7 10 3 W/m 2 at T = 2000 K for a bias voltage of V = 23 V is achieved by controlling the temperature of the hot electrons through the Joule heating. By generalizing Planck's theory and considering the nonlocal fluctuation-dissipation theorem with nonlocal response of surface plasmons in graphene in the random phase approximation (RPA), we show that the coherence length of the graphene plasmons and the thermally emitted photons can be as large as 13 \u00b5m and 150 \u00b5m, respectively, providing the opportunity to create phased arrays made of nanoantennas represented by the holes in NPG. The spatial phase variation of the coherence allows for beamsteering of the thermal emission in the range between 12 \u2022 and 80 \u2022 by tuning the Fermi energy between F = \u22121.0 eV and F = \u22120.25 eV through the gate voltage. Our analysis of the nonlocal hydrodynamic response leads to the conjecture that the diffusion length and viscosity in graphene are frequency-dependent. Using finite-difference time domain (FDTD) calculations, coupled mode theory, and RPA, we develop the model of a mid-IR light source based on NPG, which will pave the way to graphene-based optical mid-IR communication, mid-IR color displays, mid-IR spectroscopy, and virus detection.",

In recent years, several methods have been implemented for achieving a spectrally selective emittance, in particular narrowband emittance, which increases the coherence of the emitted photons. One possibility is to use a material that exhibits optical resonances due to the band structure or due to confinement of the charge carriers. 1 Another method is to use structural optical resonances to enhance and/or suppress the emittance. Recently, photonic crystal structures have been used to implement passive pass band filters that reflect the thermal emission arXiv:2005.09560v1 [cond-mat.mes-hall] 19 May 2020 at wavelengths that match the photonic bandgap. 2, 3 Alternatively, a truncated photonic crystal can be used to enhance the emittance at resonant frequencies. 4, 5 Recent experiments have shown that it is possible to generate infrared (IR) emission by means of Joule heating created by means of a bias voltage applied to graphene on a SiO 2 /Si substrate. 6, 7 In order to avoid the breakdown of the graphene sheet at around T = 700 K, the graphene sheet can be encapsulated between hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) layers, which remove efficiently the heat from graphene. The top layer protects it from oxidation. 8, 9 In this way, the graphene sheet can be heated up to T = 1600 K, 9 or even above T = 2000 K. 8 , 10 Kim et al. and Luo et al. demonstrated broadband visible emission peaked around a wavelength of \u03bb = 725 nm. 8, 9 By using a photonic crystal substrate made of Si, Shiue et al. demonstrated narrowband near-IR emission peaked at around \u03bb = 1600 nm with an emittance of around = 0.07. 10 To the best of our knowledge, there are neither theoretical nor experimental studies on spectrally selective thermal emission from graphene in the mid-IR range.",

This result suggests that the coherence length is given approximately by D, which according to Ref. 13 would be D \u2248 0.4 \u00b5m. However, the resulting broadening of the LSP resonance peaks would be very large and therefore in complete contradiction to the experimental measurements of the LSP resonance peaks in Refs. 11, 24, and 25. Thus, we conclude that the hydrodynamic diffusion length must be frequency-dependent with D(\u03bd = 0) = 0.4 \u00b5m. Using the Fermi velocity of v F = 10 6 m/s and a frequency of \u03bd = 30 THz, the average oscillation distance is about L = v F \u03bd \u22121 = 0.033 \u00b5m, which is much smaller than D(\u03bd = 0) in graphene. Thus we can approximate D(\u03bd = 30 THz) = 0. We conjecture that there is a crossover for D into the hydrdynamic regime when the frequency is reduced below around \u03bd 0 = 1 to 3 THz, below which the hydrodynamic effect leads to a strong broadening of the LSP peaks for NPG. Consequently, the viscosity of graphene should also be frequency-dependent and a crossover for the viscosity should happen at about the same frequency \u03bd 0 . We plan to elaborate this conjecture in future work. Future experiments could corroborate our conjecture by measuring the absorbance or emittance as a function of wavelength for varying scale of patterning of the graphene sheet. Next, let us consider the coherence of thermal emission by means of the nonlocal optical conductivity in the RPA approximation. Using the general formula",

It is evident that the plasmon lifetime is reduced due to electronphonon interaction and edge scattering, but the DC conductivity, which is used to calculate the dielectric function of graphene, is invariant if the edge-to-edge distance of the pattern is larger than the carrier mean free path L M F P = v F \u03c4 DC . The Drude model and the optical phonon frequency isare not valid for a patterned graphene sheet only if the edge-to-edge distance is much lowersmaller than the carrier mean free paths of electrons and phonons. For the current pattern and carrier mobilities, both the mean free paths L e and L ph are smaller than or of the same order as the edge-to-edge distance, which means that we can safely assume that the Drude model and optical phonon frequencies of our patterned graphene sheet are the same as for pristine graphene. The coupling of plasmon and substrate/graphene phonon can be characterized through the loss function Z, which is the imaginary part of inverse effective dielectric function calculated via the generalized RPA theory",

The surface plasmons in graphene are damped through radiative and nonradiative processes. Nonradiative damping transfers the plasmon energy to hot electron-hole excitation by means of intraband transition. Fig. 18 (a) shows the loss function for graphene with carrier mobility \u00b5 = 3000 cm 2 /V\u00b7s and a Fermi energy of F = 1.0 eV. The thickness of the optical cavity is chosen to be \u03bb/4n, where n is the refractive index of the cavity material. 11 The plasmon assisted electron-hole pair generation in this structure lies outside the Landau intraband damping region, indicated by the shaded area in Fig. 18 (a) . A band gap in the plasmonphonon dispersion relation is formed via Frohlich interaction between graphene plasmons and optical phonons. This coupling leads to the splitting of the energy into two distinct branches: surface plasmon phonon polaritons (SPPPs) and graphene plasmons (GPs). The horizontal branch line marked as \u03c9 LSP is the LSP mode and is independent of the plasmon wavevector due to the localization of the LSP around a hole. The resonance frequencies of the polar phonons are denoted by \u03c9 BN for h-BN and by \u03c9 SN for Si 3 N 4 .",

            "text": "In our proposed mid-IR light source the effective combination of Si 3 N 4 and h-BN behaves as an environment with polar phonons. Polar materials have ions of different valence, whose oscillating dipole moment gives rise to the interaction between electrons and optical phonons, the Frohlich interaction. By placing graphene on a polar substrate the long range Frohlich interaction mediates the interaction between optical phonons and surface plasmons in graphene. 31 The interaction between polar substrate/graphene phonons and electrons in graphene modifies substantially the graphene plasmon dispersion relation, which is shown in Fig. 18 . The dielectric function of graphene in the random phase approximation (RPA) takes the form 11,12The second term represents the effective Coulomb interaction of electrons in graphene, and v c (q) = e 2 2q\u03b5 0 is the direct Coulomb interaction. The third term is the effective dielectric function for different phonon modes (l) coming from electron-electron interaction mediated by where |M sph | 2 is the scattering and G 0 l is the free phonon Green function. The last term of Eq. (165) corresponds to the optical phonon mediated electron-electron interaction v oph (q, \u03c9) = |M oph | 2 G 0 (\u03c9).Here |M o ph| 2 defines the scattering matrix element and G o (\u03c9) is the free phonon Green function. In Eq. (165), \u03c7 0 j,j (q, \u03c9) is the current-current correlation function. This description is very general and can be applied to any metallic system. The momentum relaxation time \u03c4 can be derived by considering the impurity, electron-phonon interaction, and the scattering related to nanostructure edges \u03c4 \u22121 = \u03c4 \u22121 DC + \u03c4 \u22121 edge + \u03c4 \u22121 e\u2212p , which determines the plasmon lifetime and the absorption spectrum bandwidth. It can be evaluated via the measured DC mobility \u00b5 of the graphene sample throughwhere v F = 10 6 m/s is the Fermi velocity and \u03c4 DC = \u00b5 \u221a \u03c0\u03c1 ev F is the charge carrier density. \u03c4 edge \u2248 1 \u00d7 10 6 (m/s) w \u2212 w 0 \u22121 is due to the scattering from the nanostructure edges, where w is the edge-to-edge distance of the holes and w 0 = 7 nm is the parameter that includes edge effects, and \u03c4 e\u2212ph = 2Im( e\u2212ph ) is related to the scattering because of coupling of electrons and phonons. The imaginary part of the electron-phonon self-energy is given byFor the calculation of the spectral radiance we need to integrate the elements of the dyadic Green function over the spherical angle. We can split the total dyadic Green function into a free space term \u2190 \u2192 G 0 (r, r ; \u03c9) and a term \u2190 \u2192 G SP P (r, r ; \u03c9) that creates surface plasmon polaritons inside graphene. Since the absorbance of the pristine graphene sheet is only 2.3%, we can safely neglect \u2190 \u2192 G SP P (r, r ; \u03c9). Our goal is to calculate the gray-body emission of the EM radiation from the LSP around the holes in graphene into free space. Therefore, we need to evaluatewhere can use the approximationIn Cartesian coordinates, we can write down the dyadic Green function as 17Since we are interested only in the far field, we consider only the far-field component of the dyadic Green function, which is The corresponding integrals ar\u00ea r 2 sin \u03b8d\u03b8d\u03d5 |G xx (r; \u03c9)| 2 = 2 15\u03c0 , r 2 sin \u03b8d\u03b8d\u03d5 |G yx (r; \u03c9)| 2 = 4 15\u03c0 , r 2 sin \u03b8d\u03b8d\u03d5 |G zx (r; \u03c9)| 2 = 4 15\u03c0 , r 2 sin \u03b8d\u03b8d\u03d5 |G xy (r; \u03c9)| 2 = 4 15\u03c0 , r 2 sin \u03b8d\u03b8d\u03d5 |G yy (r; \u03c9)| 2 = 2 15\u03c0 , r 2 sin \u03b8d\u03b8d\u03d5 |G zy (r; \u03c9)| 2 = 4 15\u03c0.",
