            "text": "The porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus (PEDv) was first identified in 1971. This virus remained in Europe and Asia until 2013 and was first reported in the United States in April 2016 (Jarvis et al., 2016). Its presence was officially recognized in Mexico before the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) in May 2014 (OIE, 2014). PEDv belongs to the Alphacoronavirus genus of the Coronaviridae family. It is a single\u2010stranded RNA virus, and the spike protein is a type I membrane glycoprotein with signal peptides; it plays an important role in the induction of neutralizing antibodies, receptor binding and viral entry, and it is the protein with the most variable sequences in the genome of coronaviruses (Weiss & Leibowitz, 2011). The strains isolated during the initial outbreaks in the United States were classified as highly pathogenic. In 2014, a strain with low pathogenicity was found in Ohio, USA; it was known as Indel\u2010S because it has three nucleotide deletions and one insertion in the S gene, similar to the classic CV777 strain (Wang, Byrum, & Zhang, 2014). Thus, the circulation of two great strain groups was established: the Indel\u2010S type and the non\u2010Indel\u2010S type (Lee, 2015). Indel\u2010S\u2010type strains have been found in several countries where the disease is endemic; however, they have been described as highly pathogenic strains (Stadler et al., 2015). The circulation of Indel\u2010S and non\u2010Indel\u2010S strains was recently described in Mexico, reporting PEDv prevalence levels of 30% (OIE, 2014) and 88.8% (Lara\u2010Romero et al., 2017). Previous reports on porcine epidemic diarrhoea in other countries suggest that the high genetic diversity of the circulating strains could produce emerging strains not yet identified in Mexico. Therefore, the aim of this study was to report the genetic variability of PEDv in samples from farms that showed high\u2010mortality diarrhoeic outbreaks in piglets.",

The PEDv S gene was amplified by endpoint RT\u2010PCR, yielding 28 positive samples (52.83%) from 10 of the 17 states sampled. This study reports the presence of the PEDv S gene in the states of Hidalgo, Oaxaca and San Luis Potos\u00ed for the first time (Lara\u2010Romero et al., 2017; OIE, 2014). The coronavirus S protein is a type I membrane glycoprotein that interacts with cell receptors during virus entry (Weiss & Leibowitz, 2011). Various genotypes of the S protein gene have been described based on their genetic traits and the period when the strains emerged: GIa (classical), GIb (emergent, Indel\u2010S), GIIa (emergent, non\u2010Indel\u2010S from the Americas) and GIIb (emergent, non\u2010Indel\u2010S from Asia) (Jarvis et al., 2016; Lee, 2015). Previous studies in Mexico have identified circulating strains with a GII genotype (from the Americas) as well as strains with a GI genotype (Indel\u2010S) (Lara\u2010Romero et al., 2017). The 20 strains isolated in this study (Table 1) are in the GIIa genotype branch and were identified as emerging, non\u2010Indel\u2010S variants (Figure 2); the strains PEDv/MEX/JAL/LI\u2010DMZC11/2015 and PEDv/MEX/MICH/LI\u2010DMZC19/2015 are located in a cluster related to emerging strains from Asia, and all other strains are in clusters along with strains from the Americas (Jarvis et al., 2016; Lee, 2015), indicating that a wide range of strains are circulating in Mexico. The similarity rates for the S gene among classical and emerging virus strains ranged from 96% to 98%. Within the cluster of US strains, the similarity rate is even higher (99.3%\u201399.6%) than among emerging strains from China (98.1%\u201399.5%) (Lin, Saif, Marthaler, & Wang, 2016). Our results indicate a similarity rate of 99.3%\u201399.9% among Mexican strains with respect to emerging, non\u2010Indel\u2010S strains. The strains reported in this study showed a similarity rate of 95%\u201395.9% with emerging Indel\u2010S strains and of 92.7%\u201393.2% with classical reference strains.",

In this study, the reference strain USA/Colorado/2013 was chosen for comparison because it showed a higher similarity rate with the GIIa genotype (Figure 3). Sequencing analysis revealed the positions of the epitopes 751YSNIGVCK758, 767SQSGQVKI774 and 1371GPRLQPY1377 (SS2, SS6 and 2C10, respectively). No changes were observed in the epitopes SS2 and 2C10 in any of the 20 strains analysed, while a strain from Puebla isolated in 2014 (PEDv/MEX/PUE/LI\u2010DMZC5/2014) showed an L/S767F substitution on the SS6 epitope, a position previously described with different mutations in other strains (Hao, Xue, He, Wang, & Cao, 2014).",

Recently, 11 substitutions were found in 7 different Mexican strains (Lara\u2010Romero et al., 2017); one of these substitutions (H524R) was found in a strain from Sonora. In this work, amino acid substitutions were found in strains from Puebla, Veracruz and Quer\u00e9taro. These data suggest that antigenic variations among strain groups are given by changes in 8\u201311 amino acids on this neutralizing epitope (Lin et al., 2016). The substitution of three serine residues (A522S, A554S and G599S) on the COE epitope and two serine residues on the SS6 epitope (L767S and D769S) was found in all the strains studied herein.",
