Influenza C usually causes mild infections that lead to the acquisition of protective antibodies capable of preventing recurrences [24] . Influenza A and B are considerably more common and can cause disease of greater severity, most notably in high-risk groups, such as elderly people and patients with chronic respiratory or cardiovascular conditions, chronic renal failure, diabetes mellitus, or immune deficiencies [6] . It is estimated that about 5% of adults and 20% of children experience an influenza episode every year throughout the world [25] . Although most influenza episodes are mild, the high occurrence rate results in a huge burden of disease that has a severe socioeconomic impact [6] . Influenza viruses are believed to be the seventh cause of death in the USA [26] . Influenza A and B infections start in childhood and continue to occur throughout the life span, because antigenic variations affecting HA and, to a lesser extent NA, hamper the acquisition of protective immunity. Two mechanisms of antigenic variations have been described, antigenic drift and antigenic shift [6] . Antigenic drift probably results from the accumulation of point mutations that occur continuously in influenza viruses, with new variants appearing annually or every few years. These new variants replace pre-existing ones by immunological selection and are only incompletely recognised by immunity resulting from exposure to earlier strains. Antigenic shift is a considerably rarer event that occurs only in influenza A and results in a virus with a completely new HA or NA [6] . The result is an influenza pandemic due to the absence of protective immunity against the new virus. Progressive acquisition of immunity against this new strain attenuates the intensity of the epidemic over the following years. The exact genetic mechanisms of antigenic shift are incompletely known, and the emergence of pandemic strains is not predictable. Pandemic strains originate from the recombination of influenza strains circulating in different animal species, including birds, pigs, and humans [6] . Five pandemics occurred in the twentieth century, and the 2009 \"Mexican flu\" pandemic due to the new H1N1 influenza virus is the first pandemic in the twenty-first century [6, 27] . RSV and PIV are typically infections of early childhood [7] . RSV and, to a lesser extent, PIV also undergo antigenic changes that lead to recurrences throughout the life span. These recurrences may be severe, especially in patients with chronic respiratory conditions and in the elderly. The burden of RSV-related diseases may be comparable to that of influenza [28] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 205, "end": 209, "text": "[24]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 492, "end": 495, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 622, "end": 626, "text": "[25]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 772, "end": 775, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 853, "end": 857, "text": "[26]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1169, "end": 1172, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 1649, "end": 1652, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 2159, "end": 2162, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 2337, "end": 2340, "text": "[6,", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 2341, "end": 2344, "text": "27]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2403, "end": 2406, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 2710, "end": 2714, "text": "[28]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Epidemiology"}, {"text": "Few data are available on the specific epidemiological characteristics of common respiratory viruses in patients with HMs. Reported incidence rates vary widely, from 1.8% to 30% [29, 30] . This variability may be explained by disparities in the type of patients enrolled, reasons for screening patients for respiratory viruses and, most importantly, diagnostic methods used. Whatever the exact incidence, one can reasonably assume that attack rates of common respiratory viruses in immunocompromised patients are closely related to the prevalence of respiratory viruses in the community, which serves as the viral reservoir for immunocompromised patients [31] . This has been confirmed in recent studies showing that the occurrence of viral respiratory diseases in the enrolled immunocompromised patients paralleled the concomitant viral activity in the community [32, 33] . Accordingly, influenza viruses and RSV are the viruses most commonly identified in the largest cohorts of HM patients, each accounting for about one-third of viral respiratory events [34] [35] [36] . PIV, Picornaviridae, and adenoviruses come next.

A distinctive feature of adenoviruses is the ability to cause chronic latent infection by persisting in lymphoepithelial tissues, most notably in the nasopharynx [23] . The epidemiology of adenoviruses in patients with HM has not been the focus of specific studies. Nevertheless, exogenous contamination, by the respiratory or orofaecal route, may be less important than reactivation of the latent virus [39] .

Although rare in immunocompetent hosts, these manifestations might be more common in patients with HM. As stated above, common respiratory viruses have long been underrecognised in patients with HM. In the 1990s, the first reports of common respiratory virus infections focused on influenza and RSV [45] [46] [47] [48] [49] [50] . In these studies, progression to pneumonia occurred in about 75% of patients infected with influenza viruses and 50% of those infected with RSV, and was associated with mortality rates of 25% for influenza and about 80% for RSV.

In patients with HM, the risk of severe adenoviral Thoracic CT scan showing bronchiolitis pattern (bronchial wall thickening associated with ground-glass attenuation, interlobular septa thickening and tree-in-bud opacities) in an influenza-infected patient disease seems related to the level of immunosuppression.

Indeed, respiratory virus detection requires a large number of epithelial cells, since viruses are intracellular pathogens. Nasopharyngeal aspirates and nasopharyngeal washes are recognised to be superior to other sample types for detecting respiratory viruses [103, 104] . Because the collection process is unpleasant and time-consuming, causes patient discomfort, and requires a suction device, flocked swabs were recently introduced for respiratory sample collection. Flocked swabs were found to improve the collection and release of epithelial cells [105, 106] , and were recently recommended for the diagnosis of the new pandemic H1N1 influenza strain. The number of cells collected is lower with flocked swabs than with nasopharyngeal aspirates, but seems sufficient for respiratory virus detection by immunofluorescence [105, 106] . Flocked swab collection is sensitive, specific, easy to use, and better tolerated by patients, and may therefore constitute a good alternative to nasopharyngeal aspiration. Because most respiratory viruses have high replication rates in the upper respiratory tract, nasopharyngeal secretions are usually sufficient to diagnose respiratory viral infections. However, asymptomatic respiratory virus shedding in the upper respiratory tract may occur even in immunocompromised patients, and URTI may be followed by LRTI, particularly during influenza infections. Thus, virus detection in lungs via bronchoalveolar lavage may be useful to assess the causative role for the virus. Over the past 2 decades, virus isolation and antigen detection have been the mainstay of clinical laboratory testing for respiratory virus infections. Virus isolation required several cell lines and was mainly performed on shell vial cultures. The diagnosis was based on the presence of the cytopathic effect, which requires several days or weeks to develop. To shorten the time to diagnosis, specific monoclonal antibodies were introduced to enable the detection of specific viral antigens within 1-2 days. Direct or indirect fluorescent antibody staining of cells from respiratory specimens (mainly nasopharyngeal swabs or nasopharyngeal aspirates [NPA] and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid) is commonly used to detect viral antigens. In many laboratories, the first-line test is immunofluorescence staining, which requires very little material and provides a result within about 3 h. However commercial monoclonal antibodies are available for a limited number of targets, including influenza A and B; RSV; adenovirus; PIV 1, 2 and 3; and human MPV.

Regarding common viruses, we will briefly describe available treatments on influenza and RSV. Two classes of antiviral drugs are available for the treatment of influenza: M2 ion channel inhibitors and neuraminidase inhibitors. The M2 ion channel inhibitors, amantadine and rimantadine, act by inhibiting the M2 protein needed for viral RNA release within the host cells. They are active only against influenza A strains. Their clinical effect is limited, being not significantly different from that of a placebo [121] , and is further hampered by the worldwide emergence of resistant influenza A strains [122] . The neuraminidase inhibitors (Table 21. showed moderate decreases in symptom intensity and duration with both drugs [123] [124] [125] . Neuraminidase inhibitors may also limit bacterial super-infection of the lungs [125, 126] . Early administration of these drugs seems mandatory to obtain a clinical benefit [127] . A more recent cohort study suggested a diminution of 15-day mortality with neuraminidase inhibitors [128] . This result must be interpreted with caution, especially given the study design. There is growing concern about the emergence of oseltamivir-resistant influenza A strains [129] . This phenomenon is not surprising given the high mutation rate in the influenza genome. It should lead clinicians to reconsider the indications of neuraminidase inhibitors and their use as monotherapy to treat influenza [130] . No randomised controlled trials have evaluated the efficacy of neuraminidase inhibitors in patients with HM. The apparently lower mortality in descriptive cohort studies compared with historical studies must be interpreted with caution [33-35, 131]. Many of the patients in these cohorts had bacterial and fungal co-infections, whose specific treatment probably contributed to decreasing mortality. Furthermore, the decision to treat patients was left to clinician discretion, which may have introduced a bias toward selection of patients with greater disease severity. Given both the absence of strong evidence supporting beneficial effects of neuraminidase inhibitor therapy and the rapid emergence of resistant strains, we believe that neuraminidase inhibitor therapy cannot be recommended for HM patients with influenza.

However, nosocomial outbreaks have been described in haematologic wards, often within a few days after an outbreak in the community [31, 43, 44, 46, [158] [159] [160] . Preventing nosocomial transmission of common respiratory viruses requires a multifaceted approach (Table 21 .4) that targets not only the modes of transmission, but also the source of the viruses [43] . Nosocomial outbreaks are believed to originate from infected patients and from infected health-care workers. Infection control measures include screening symptomatic patients for common respiratory viruses, early isolation of infected patients, screening healthcare workers and visitors for respiratory symptoms, and avoiding contact of symptomatic individuals with patients. Most haematologic wards do not allow children to visit patients, as children are highly prone to common respiratory virus infections and may exhibit viral shedding long after symptom resolution [39] . Continual reinforcement of standard hygiene measures, especially hand hygiene before and after contact with patients, is also strongly recommended. Awareness of the usefulness of these measures, and therefore adherence to the measures, are low, but can be enhanced by educational programs [161] . Most of the common respiratory viruses are transmitted by droplets or direct contact of infected secretions with the nasal mucosa or conjunctiva. Indirect transmission via contaminated fomites or devices is also possible, since these viruses may survive several hours on these surfaces [6, 7, 58] . Consequently, contact isolation of infected patients combined with droplet precautions is mandatory [162] . A gown, gloves, and a mask with eye protection must be worn for all contacts with infected patients. Airborne transmission of influenza is suspected [163, 164] but not yet proven, and two recent studies suggest that surgical masks may be as effective in preventing influenza transmission as masks with greater filtration capacity [165, 166] . Infection control measures have not been evaluated in randomised control trials, but a beforeand-after study suggests they may help to prevent the transmission of common respiratory viruses [43] . It must be pointed out that asymptomatic viral shedding, when present, limits the effectiveness of infection control measures [30, 65] . The optimal duration of isolation is unknown. Whether isolation should be prolonged in asymptomatic patients with persistent low-titre viral shedding detected only by molecular methods remains unclear. Since adenovirus acquisition is known to result also from endogenous reactivation, adenoviral infections may be chiefly related to the level of immunosuppression [39, 86] and, therefore, may not be effectively prevented by standard infection control measures.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 261, "end": 265, "text": "[31,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 266, "end": 269, "text": "43,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 270, "end": 273, "text": "44,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 274, "end": 277, "text": "46,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 278, "end": 283, "text": "[158]", "ref_id": "BIBREF121"}, {"start": 284, "end": 289, "text": "[159]", "ref_id": "BIBREF122"}, {"start": 290, "end": 295, "text": "[160]", "ref_id": "BIBREF123"}, {"start": 494, "end": 498, "text": "[43]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1071, "end": 1075, "text": "[39]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1367, "end": 1372, "text": "[161]", "ref_id": "BIBREF124"}, {"start": 1661, "end": 1664, "text": "[6,", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 1665, "end": 1667, "text": "7,", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 1668, "end": 1671, "text": "58]", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 1774, "end": 1779, "text": "[162]", "ref_id": "BIBREF125"}, {"start": 1931, "end": 1936, "text": "[163,", "ref_id": "BIBREF126"}, {"start": 1937, "end": 1941, "text": "164]", "ref_id": "BIBREF127"}, {"start": 2112, "end": 2117, "text": "[165,", "ref_id": "BIBREF128"}, {"start": 2118, "end": 2122, "text": "166]", "ref_id": "BIBREF129"}, {"start": 2315, "end": 2319, "text": "[43]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2448, "end": 2452, "text": "[30,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2453, "end": 2456, "text": "65]", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 2823, "end": 2827, "text": "[39,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2828, "end": 2831, "text": "86]", "ref_id": "BIBREF49"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 396, "end": 405, "text": "(Table 21", "ref_id": "TABREF3"}], "section": "Prevention"}, {"text": "To date, influenza is the only common respiratory virus for which a vaccine is available.

A second dose of influenza vaccine has been proposed to enhance immunogenicity, but this strategy was not beneficial in an open-label randomised study [169, 170] .

Adenoviruses are non-enveloped, double-stranded DNA viruses that form the Adenoviridae family. Six subgenera (A-F) and 51 human serotypes of adenoviruses have been described [22].

One study found that lymphocytopenia (absolute lymphocyte count less than 200 cells/mL) was independently associated with mortality in patients with influenza-related pneumonia [34]. A higher incidence and greater severity of virusrelated pneumonia have been noted in HSCT recipients compared with other patients with HM. This finding may reflect deeper lymphocyte depletion. However, in a study by Martino et al., pneumonia rates were comparable in patients with and without lymphocytopenia [32]. The possible higher incidence and greater severity of virus-related pneumonia within the first few days after HSCT, compared with infections occurring later on, may reflect deeper lymphocyte depletion[53]. A similar mechanism may underlie the surprising protective effect of corticosteroid therapy in the study by Nichols et al., since this treatment is often given to treat graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) after lymphoid engraftment[33].", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF5": {"text": "Methods for detecting common respiratory viruses", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF6": {"text": "3), oral oseltamivir and inhaled zanamivir, are sialic acid analogues that competitively inhibit the influenza neuraminidase.
