            "text": "Porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED) is an emerging and important swine disease that causes acute enteritis with high mortality in piglets (Debouck and Pensaert, 1980, Pijpers et al., 1993, Saif et al., 2012). PED is characterized by severe villous atrophy in the small intestine, which is more serious in newborn pigs than in older pigs, resulting in malabsorptive watery diarrhea followed by fatal dehydration in piglets (Madson et al., 2014, Saif et al., 2012, Shibata et al., 2000). The associated mortality rates vary depending on age likely due to age-dependent disease severity and generally approach 90\u2013100% in 1- to 3-day-old neonatal piglets (Saif et al., 2012). The disease was first observed in the United Kingdom in 1971 and then spread to multiple swine-producing European countries (Chasey and Cartwright, 1978, Oldham, 1972, Pensaert et al., 1981). In Asia, PED epidemics first occurred in 1982 and since then, PED remains a major concern in Asian countries, particularly in China and South Korea (Chen et al., 2008, Kweon et al., 1993, Li et al., 2012, Puranaveja et al., 2009, Sun et al., 2012, Takahashi et al., 1983). During 2013 and 2014, a severe large-scale PED epizootic emerged in the United States and re-emerged in South Korea, Taiwan, and Japan, which led to tremendous financial losses in the pork industries in these countries (Lee and Lee, 2014, Lee et al., 2014a, Lee et al., 2014b, Lin et al., 2014, Mole, 2013, Stevenson et al., 2013).",

            "text": "The etiological agent of PED, the PED virus (PEDV), was identified in 1978 as a coronavirus, which is a member of the genus Alphacoronavirus within the family Coronaviridae of the order Nidovirales (Pensaert and de Bouck, 1978; Saif et al., 2012). PEDV is a large, enveloped virus possessing a single-stranded positive-sense RNA genome, approximately 28 kb long, with a 5\u2032 cap and a 3\u2032 polyadenylated tail (Pensaert and de Bouck, 1978, Saif et al., 2012). The PEDV genome is composed of a 5\u2032 untranslated region (UTR), at least 7 open reading frames (ORF1a, ORF1b, and ORF2 through 6), and a 3\u2032 UTR (Kocherhans et al., 2001). The two large ORF1a and 1b comprising the 5\u2032 two-thirds of the genome encode non-structural proteins (nsps). The remaining ORFs in the 3\u2032 terminal region code for four major structural proteins, the 150\u2013220 kDa glycosylated spike (S) protein, 20\u201330 kDa membrane (M) protein, 7 kDa envelop (E) protein, and 58 kDa nucleocapsid (N) protein (Duarte et al., 1994, Saif et al., 2012). PEDV infection is initiated by binding of the viral S protein to the receptor on host cells, and the viral genome is released into the cytoplasm after the viral entry process. As positive-strand RNA viruses, the PEDV genome functions as an mRNA for the synthesis of viral proteins. Translation initially occurs from ORF1a and ORF1b, yielding the la and lab replicase polyproteins, with the latter produced by a \u22121 ribosomal frame shift. These polyproteins are subsequently cleaved into functional 16 nsps including the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). The RdRp-containing replication complex in turn mediates viral genomic RNA synthesis and subgenomic (sg) mRNA transcription, eventually producing a nested set of 3\u2032 co-terminal sg mRNAs that are individually translated to structural proteins (Lai et al., 2007, Saif et al., 2012). A recent report has shown that PEDV induces caspase-independent apoptosis through the activation of mitochondrial apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) to facilitate viral replication and pathogenesis (Kim and Lee, 2014). However, whether other cellular factors or mechanisms may also regulate PEDV infection is still unknown.",

            "text": "The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade pathways are central building blocks in the intracellular signaling network. As the global cellular regulators in response to various extracellular stimuli, the MAPK pathways transmit signals to diverse intracellular targets and exquisitely control numerous cellular activities. The extracellular signaling-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling pathway is one of the three MAPK cascades that play important roles in the regulation of various cellular processes (Garrington and Johnson, 1999, Roux and Blenis, 2004). Activation of the ERK pathway includes three signal cascades, Raf, MEK1/2, and ERK1/2. Upon stimulation, the Raf/MEK/ERK cascade is initiated by receptor tyrosine kinases that signal through the small GTP-binding protein Ras. This event results in Raf activation that binds to and phosphorylates the dual specificity kinases MEK1/2, which in turn activates ERK1/2 by phosphorylation. The activated ERK1/2 finally translocates into the nucleus and phosphorylates numerous downstream substrates including transcription factors regulating transcription for a large number of genes. Therefore, the ERK pathway modulates a wide range of important cellular functions, such as cell proliferation, differentiation, survival and apoptosis (Roux and Blenis, 2004, Shaul and Seger, 2007). Since viruses are obligate intracellular parasites, they may regulate such functions to benefit their own multiplication in host cells by manipulating the ERK signaling pathway. In fact, several viruses have been shown to exploit the host ERK signaling pathway for optimal viral replication and gene expression (Cai et al., 2007, Lee and Lee, 2010, Lim et al., 2005, Marjuki et al., 2006, Moser and Schultz-Cherry, 2008, Sch\u00fcmann and Dobbelstein, 2006, Wang et al., 2006, Wei and Liu, 2009, Zampieri et al., 200. However, the role of the ERK signaling pathway in PEDV replication has not been determined.",

PEDV production was significantly impaired by MEK inhibitors and ERK1/2-specific siRNA. Further experiments revealed that independent treatment with each MEK inhibitor resulted in the distinct reduction of viral RNA synthesis and viral protein translation but did not affect viral entry.

As shown in\nFig. 1 A, only small amounts of activated ERK1/2 were detected in mock-infected Vero cells as a negative control. This was considered the background level of phosphorylated ERK1/2 (pERK1/2), possibly in response to the components of the media. In contrast, PEDV infection significantly stimulated ERK1/2 activity by 6 h postinfection (hpi) that was most markedly induced at 12 hpi and then dramatically decreased at 24 hpi, returning to the baseline level thereafter. In addition, the activation profile of ERK1/2 was comparably observed in cells infected with PEDV at an MOI of 0.1 (data not shown). These results indicated that PEDV infection triggers early strong but transient activation of ERK1/2. Interestingly, new viral protein synthesis was first evident by 12 hpi (Fig. 1A), while the maximal phosphorylation status of ERK1/2 was also seen at this time point, suggesting that ERK1/2 activation occurs independently of PEDV replication. These data further allowed us to assume that ERK1/2 regulation of the PEDV replication cycle occurs at early events in virus infection, prior to the considerable protein production obvious at late time points. To demonstrate this hypothesis, Vero cells were treated with an equal amount of UV-irradiated inactivated virus that is capable of allowing viral attachment and internalization, but incapable of pursuing viral gene expression (Fig. 1B). UV-inactivated PEDV efficiently induced ERK1/2 activation which was comparable to the phosphorylation pattern observed in PEDV-infected cells (Fig. 1B). Therefore, inactivated PEDV infection was found to be still sufficient to activate the ERK signaling pathway, suggesting that initial entry events in the virus life cycle may be responsible for early ERK activation.",

To investigate how ERK1/2 activation following PEDV infection proceeds in such a cascade, we first examined the subcellular localization of pERK1/2 in cells infected with PEDV and UV-inactivated PEDV (\nFig. 2). In mock-infected cells, no active ERK1/2 was detected in any cellular compartments during the entire period of the experiment (Fig. 2A and B, top panels). In contrast, at 6 hpi, pERK1/2 showed distinct nuclear staining with a weak punctuate cytoplasmic signal and was continuously detected in the nucleus by 24 hpi (Fig. 2A). As PEDV replication progressed, however, punctuate cytoplasmic staining of active ERK1/2 was dispersed and maintained by 24 hpi. Similarly, after exposure of cells to UV-inactivated PEDV, the majority of pERK1/2 exhibited a nuclear distribution with diffusely punctuate cytoplasmic staining. This localization pattern of active ERK molecules remained unchanged by 24 h after inactivated PEDV infection (Fig. 2B). Given that Elk-1 is one of the transcription factors phosphorylated by the ERK signaling pathway (Shaul and Seger, 2007, Wei and Liu, 2009), we measured the activation status of Elk-1 following PEDV-induced ERK activation (\nFig. 3). No activation of Elk-1 was detected in mock-infected cells. In contrast, PEDV infection resulted in the phosphorylation of Elk-1 with kinetics that identically paralleled those observed in ERK1/2 activation (Fig. 3A). Furthermore, cells exposed to UV-inactivated PEDV showed a phosphorylated Elk-1 profile comparable to that in PEDV-infected cells (Fig. 3B). This result indicated that these ERK signaling molecules that were activated following PEDV infection cooperates in reaching their appropriate downstream destinations to function as key regulators of inducible cellular processes.",

Vero cells were pretreated with the MEK1/2 inhibitor U0126 or PD98050 at various concentrations or with DMSO (0.5%) as a vehicle control for 1 h prior to infection. The inhibitor or DMSO was present during the entire period of infection. The cytotoxicity of the MEK inhibitors was determined by the MTT assay in Vero cells. All doses of the inhibitors tested in the present study caused no detectable cell death in Vero cells (data not shown). Viral production was initially measured by monitoring the cytopathic effect (CPE) after infection and was confirmed by immunofluorescence using N protein-specific MAb at 48 hpi (\nFig. 4). In vehicle-treated control cells, visible CPE appeared at 24 hpi and became predominant by 48 hpi, and N-specific staining was clearly evident in many cell clusters, indicating infection and the spread of the virus to neighboring cells. In contrast, the inhibitory effect of U0126 and PD98059 on virus propagation was readily detectable. As shown in Fig. 4A, each inhibitor significantly decreased PEDV-induced CPE (first panels) and viral gene expression (second panels) in a dose-dependent manner. As quantified by N protein staining results, the percentage of virus-infected cells was similarly reduced during independent treatment with each inhibitor, resulting in a maximal 80% inhibition at the highest concentration used (Fig. 4B). PD98059 prevents ERK1/2 activation by blocking phosphorylation of MEK1/2, whereas U0126 is not only capable of blocking the activation of MEK1/2 but also inhibiting MEK1/2 activity (Alessi et al., 1995, Davis et al., 2000). Therefore, U0126 is a more potent inhibitor of ERK1/2 activation than PD98059 (Favata et al., 1998). Our data also revealed that U0126 was significantly more effective in inhibiting PEDV production (an 80% reduction in virus propagation at a concentration of 20 \u03bcM) than PD98059 (a 20% reduction in virus propagation at the same concentration). To further show relevance, we determined the activation status of ERK1/2, the downstream activator of MEK1/2, after treatment with two MEK inhibitors in PEDV-infected cells. Both inhibitors were found to markedly decrease levels of pEKR1/2 at 12 hpi (Fig. 4C). However, the inhibitory effect of the two inhibitors was inconsistent, with a significant inhibition observed for U0126 and PD98059 at 10 \u03bcM and 50 \u03bcM, respectively. This finding indicated that the effect of both inhibitors on virus production correlates with the ability of each compound to inhibit ERK1/2 phosphorylation. Taken together, these data demonstrated that treating cells with each MEK inhibitor hampered the activation of ERK1/2 and accordingly suppressed PEDV propagation, suggesting that the Raf/MEK/ERK signaling pathway plays a role in PEDV replication.",

At 24 h post-transfection, cells were infected with PEDV for 24 h and used to determine the amounts of ERK1/2 proteins and virus propagation (\nFig. 6). The expression levels of ERK molecules were reduced by more than 60% after siRNA treatment compared to those untreated and treated with the control siRNA, indicating specific knockdown of ERK1/2 by siRNA (Fig. 6A). Furthermore, transfection of cells with ERK1/2-specific siRNA resulted in an almost 80% decrease in the number of PEDV-infected cells and an over 2-log reduction in virus titer compared to the mock- or nonspecific siRNA-transfected controls (B and C). The inhibitory effect of ERK1/2 siRNA on virus production was comparable to that of the chemical inhibition. Our data showed that knocked down expression of ERK1/2 diminishes PEDV propagation, demonstrating an essential role of the ERK signaling pathway in PEDV replication.",

The serially diluted infected cells were subsequently subjected to an infectious center assay on uninfected Vero cell monolayers, and virus titers were measured 2 days later by plaque assay (\nFig. 7B). Only minimal viral production was observed in cells maintained at 4 \u00b0C, which was likely due to an inefficient removal of the bound virus. The viral titers were nearly identical in cells treated with U0126, PD98059, or vehicle at 37 \u00b0C and were determined to be 102.1, 102.2 and 102.4\n PFU/ml, respectively, indicating no differences among treatment of these cells.

Early PEDV translation produces the replicase polyproteins that are proteolytically processed into nsps. Subsequently, the nonstructural replicase proteins mediate the de novo synthesis of viral RNA, including genomic RNA replication and sg mRNA transcription. The PEDV structural proteins are translated late in the cycle from their respective sg mRNA transcripts. Thus, to determine the functional mechanism of ERK1/2 regulation of PEDV infection on the postentry steps, we first investigated whether viral protein translation was affected by ERK inhibition. For this approach, Vero cells were treated with each inhibitor for 1 h prior to infection, and then the inhibitors were independently present during the infection and subsequent incubation periods. The expression level of the PEDV N protein in the presence of each inhibitor or DMSO was evaluated at 48 hpi by Western blot analysis. Each chemical inhibition had a detrimental effect on viral protein production at different concentrations (\nFig. 8). Densitometric analysis of the Western blots revealed that the intracellular expression of the N protein was largely prevented by both inhibitors, and that a maximal ~80% inhibition was observed at the highest concentrations of U0126 and PD98059 used (Fig. 8). These data demonstrated the inhibitory effect on viral protein expression due to the specific action of each inhibitor on viral translation during PEDV replication.",

Because PEDV infection produces two RNA entities, including genomic and subgenomic, we determined whether each ERK1/2 inhibitor specifically affected genome replication and sg mRNA transcription. To answer this question, the relative levels of both genomic RNA and sg mRNA were assessed by quantitative real-time strand-specific RT-PCR in the presence or absence of U0126 or PD98059 upon PEDV infection. As shown in\nFig. 9 A, both inhibitors greatly diminished viral RNA synthesis in a dose-dependent manner, showing a maximal 90% and 80% reduction in levels of viral genomic RNA and sg mRNA, respectively, compared to that in the DMSO-treated infected cells, respectively. The decrease in viral RNA levels after the addition of each inhibitor was not due to nonspecific inhibition of transcription, as the mRNA level of the internal GAPDH control remained unchanged in all samples (data not shown). The impairment of PEDV transcription in the presence of each inhibitor was further confirmed by northern blot analysis (Fig. 9B). In untreated (lane 2) or vehicle-treated (lane 3) virus-infected cells, PEDV RNA synthesis was distinctly observed. Consistent with real-time RT-PCR data, a significant reduction in RNA-synthesizing activity occurred dose-dependently following treatment with U0126 (lanes 4 to 6) or PD98059 (lanes 7 to 9). Taken together, these results indicated that both ERK inhibitors specifically suppress the synthesis of the PEDV genomic RNA and sg mRNA.",

Growing evidence suggests that ERK activity is associated with classical markers of apoptosis execution, promoting apoptotic cell death in certain conditions (Cagnol and Chambard, 2010). Interestingly, PEDV has been shown to induce apoptosis in vitro and in vivo to facilitate viral replication and pathogenesis (Kim and Lee, 2014). Therefore, we speculated that the ERK pathway could play a role in the induction of apoptosis during PEDV replication. To examine whether ERK activation is required for PEDV-induced apoptosis, the process of PEDV-triggered apoptosis was assessed in the presence or absence of each ERK inhibitor using Annexin V/propidium iodide (PI) flow cytometry. Vero cells were treated with DMSO or each compound at the indicated concentrations followed by PEDV infection. At the indicated time points post-infection, the treated and infected cells were stained with Annexin V and PI and then examined using FACS flow cytometry to quantitatively determine the percentage of viable, apoptotic, and dead cells (\nFig. 10A). Neither the vehicle nor the inhibitors tested caused significant apoptosis under our conditions. As expected, PEDV infection in the presence of DMSO induced a high level of apoptosis (Annexin V positive/PI negative) appearing at 6 hpi, and the percentage of early apoptotic cells increased with infection time. However, chemical inhibition of ERK1/2 activation was incapable of protecting cells from PEDV-induced apoptotic cell death. The percentage of early apoptotic cells in treatment of cells with either U0126 or PD98059 was comparable to that in vehicle-treated cells during the course of infection. Moreover, with chemical inhibition of ERK activation, nuclear translocation of AIF, a hallmark of PEDV-induced apoptosis, was still retained (Kim and Lee, 2014; Fig. 10B). These results indicated that the ERK signaling pathway is not involved in PEDV-mediated apoptosis and its mechanism.",

Among these transduction signals, the ERK pathway plays multiple pivotal roles in almost all cell functions regulating cell fate (Cagnol and Chambard, 2010, Roux and Blenis, 2004, Shaul and Seger, 2007). Thus, the ability of ERK1/2 to control cell cycle progression is a reasonable target for the modulation of viral multiplication by acting at specific steps of the virus life cycle such as entry, gene transcription, protein expression, and progeny release (Cai et al., 2007, Lee and Lee, 2010, Moser and Schultz-Cherry, 2008, Planz et al., 2001, Pleschka et al., 2001, Wei and Liu, 2009, Wong et al., 2005). Widespread ERK involvement appears to be a general characteristic for optimal viral infection, which beneficially functions as a global viral strategy to enhance its own replicative machinery. Despite decades of research, little about the intracellular signaling pathways involved in PEDV infection and pathogenesis has been deciphered. The present study demonstrated for the first time that ERK activation is required for efficient PEDV replication in cultured cells. In this study, we showed that PEDV strongly induces the activation of MAPK ERK1/2 in vitro, suggesting a crucial role of the ERK cascade during PEDV infection. Independent treatment with two ERK inhibitors and the knock down of ERK1/2 greatly impaired PEDV propagation. Moreover, chemical inhibition of ERK activation resulted in significant attenuation of viral replication during post-entry steps, as determined by an overall down-regulation in viral protein expression, viral RNA synthesis, and progeny release. Altogether, it appears that the ERK signaling pathway regulates PEDV infection for competent viral reproduction in target cells.",

Furthermore, the productive growth of PEDV commenced at 12 hpi, as determined by the detection of a considerable amount of the viral protein; this corresponded to the proportionally down-regulated phosphorylation status of ERK1/2, and after 24 hpi, a reduction in the amount of pERK1/2 below the background level. In contrast, total ERK1/2 levels were found to remain consistent in cells throughout infection with non-irradiated or UV-irradiated PEDV. Altogether, it seems that the initial round of PEDV replication cycle, which likely occurs within 12 hpi, is essential for the maximal activation of the ERK signaling pathway. Interestingly, other nidoviruses have shown similar activation profiles of ERK1/2 that are independent of virus replication but are only in response to virus entry, suggesting a unique feature of the EKR pathway in the nidovirus biology (Cai et al., 2007; Lee and Lee, 2010). In addition, coxsackievirus and astrovirus were found to mediate rapid and ephemeral ERK activation observed within 10 to 15 min postinfection (Luo et al., 2002, Moser and Schultz-Cherry, 2008). However, in the current study, due to the relatively slow growth rate of PEDV, we were unable to determine how quickly the ERK pathway is activated following infection. The one-step growth curve indicated that the eclipse period appeared by 6 hpi and immediately after this, progeny viruses began to be detectable. For productive infection, PEDV particles must progressively proceed through a multiple-step cycle consisting of entry, uncoating, genome replication and transcription, viral translation, assembly, and progeny release. During the eclipse period, virus attachment and internalization occurs followed by uncoating to disassemble the viral capsid for genome release, which is now ready to initiate the replication cycle in the cytoplasm of infected cells. Although the exact mechanism to explain ERK1/2 activation following PEDV infection is unclear from the present study, it is tempting to speculate that virus-receptor interactions are responsible for ERK activation in PEDV-infected cells. The other possibility is that ERK cascades are stimulated by virus particles entering through direct fusion with the cell membrane or by exposure to the disassembled viral proteins and the released genome after the uncoating process.",

            "text": "The data herein raises a question about the definite function of activated ERK1/2 during PEDV infection. A conceivable explanation for how ERK1/2 activation controls PEDV infection is that the ERK pathway regulates viral replication directly or indirectly. Independent treatment of PEDV-infected cells with each ERK inhibitor significantly suppressed individual postinternalizaton steps of the viral replication process, including viral RNA synthesis, protein expression, and virus production. Positive-sense RNA virus RdRps have been increasingly reported to be phosphoproteins activated by host proteins, suggesting regulation of viral RNA replication through phosphorylation of the polymerase protein (Jakubiec and Jupin, 2007). Moreover, previous studies have proposed that ERK1/2 activity might be necessary to phosphorylate or stabilize the viral RdRp, which are both required for the initiation of viral RNA replication (Luo et al., 2002; Moser and Schultz-Cherry, 2008). Therefore, a similar phosphorylation modification may activate the PEDV RdRp (nsp12) and could be indispensable for optimal viral RNA synthesis. ERK activation mediates apoptosis via either intrinsic or extrinsic pathways by the induction of mitochondrial cytochrome c release or caspase-8 activation, respectively (Cagnol and Chambard, 2010). Several viruses have been found to activate the ERK pathway to modulate apoptosis for contributing to their replication (Wong et al., 2005, Zampieri et al., 200). We have previously demonstrated that PEDV promotes apoptotic cell death in vitro and in vivo to favor viral infection (Kim and Lee, 2014). However, the current study showed a negative correlation between the activation of ERK1/2 and apoptosis during PEDV infection. This result was anticipated because neither caspase activation nor cytochrome c release participated in the PEDV-triggered apoptosis pathway (Kim and Lee, 2014). Alternatively, ERK1/2 activation may be indirectly involved in PEDV infection by activating other cascades through crosstalk or by providing a signal to the downstream cellular transcription factors necessary for maximal virus propagation. Furthermore, in our experimental conditions, we were unable to completely eliminate viral replication during chemical inhibition. Therefore, if the indirect influence of ERK1/2 activity is the case, ERK signaling could be one of the intracellular pathways important for PEDV replication.",

However, viral processes or components underlying ERK activation remain to be determined.
