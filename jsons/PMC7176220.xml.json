In a non-selected patient population, the prevalence of invasive fungal infections in an academic hospital rose from 2.2 to 5.1% over a 12-year period, largely due to an increase in Aspergillus infections [1]. However, estimates about the incidence of IA in critically ill patients are sparse and variable. For various reasons, figures about the true incidence are difficult to generate. First, in case of a positive culture for Aspergillus species, discriminating between colonisation and infection remains challenging. Second, very few institutions perform post-mortem examinations routinely, while in most cases, this is the only way for proving the definite nature of the diagnosis. Third, characteristic radiological signs of IA are usually absent in the non-neutropenic ICU patient. Finally, to date, the diagnostic utility of recently available non-culture based microbiological tools, including the detection of fungal antigens and the detection of Aspergillus-specific DNA through polymerase chain reaction (PCR) techniques, has not been properly validated in the non-haematology ICU population. In addition, typical ICU patients such as those with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or liver disorders were not considered amongst hosts at high risk for IA in the recently updated EORTC/MSG guidelines [2].",

In a medical ICU, we have observed high incidences of IA in two separate retrospective autopsy-controlled studies. In the largest one, 127 of 1850 (6.9%) hospitalised patients had microbiological or histopathological evidence of aspergillosis during their ICU stay, including 89 cases (70%) without underlying haematological malignancy. The observed mortality of 80% was much higher than the predicted mortality as per SAPS II score (48%) [4]. An earlier study looked for unsuspected causes of death in the same medical ICU and showed that, out of 100 autopsies, there were 15 cases of IA, of which 5 were missed pre-mortem [3]. During a 6-year period, Cornillet et al. found a mean number of 15 patients per year diagnosed with IA; approximately half of them were in the ICU [9]. These inter-centre differences can be explained by differences in underlying patient characteristics, case mix and different autopsy policies.\n",

Most patients had non-haematological diseases (67%), including liver cirrhosis (21%), COPD (14%) and other systemic conditions (15%). The incidence of proven IA in this population was surprisingly high at 23.6%, which might have been associated with the high frequency of autopsy (95% of fatalities), as well as the use of a sensitive diagnostic tool (more comments about galactomannan testing are presented below). As this was a single-centre study, the presence of an outbreak is also a possibility.",

Although these factors are present in most ICU patients, many of them do not develop IA. One of the intriguing hypotheses for immunosuppression in the apparently immunocompetent patient with multiple organ dysfunctions is related to the biphasic response to sepsis. The initial hyperinflammatory phase is followed by relative immunoparalysis [11]. This latter process is characterized by neutrophil deactivation and may put the patient at risk for developing opportunistic infections such as IA. Further epidemiological study is warranted to better delineate this phase of immunoparalysis. More detail on the interactions between Aspergillus and the immune system are presented in the chapter by Dr Romani.",

Recent work concluded that the mortality is reduced if septic shock patients with adrenal dysfunction receive hydrocortisone for a 7-day period [12]. In vitro, however, pharmacological concentrations of hydrocortisone accelerate the growth of Aspergillus spp. [13]. Clearly, high steroid intake diminishes both lines of cellular defence against IA (macrophages and neutrophils). Palmer reported that the threshold steroid level varies according to the type of patients and emphasized that underlying lung disease is a risk factor for IA even at low doses [14]. Further study is needed to investigate whether the 7 day course of hydrocortisone at 200-mg/day in patients with septic shock puts them at risk for IA, knowing that recognition of fungal infection may be delayed, since the anti-inflammatory properties of steroids blunt the signs of infection.",

Patients with COPD are an increasingly recognized group of patients at risk for developing IA and in some institutions outnumber cases in \u201cclassic\u201d patients. Bulpa et al. analyzed a group of 16 COPD patients with proven or probable IA requiring ICU admission. All patients were on steroid treatment. The outcome was invariably poor [15]. This is in accordance with the report of Rello et al., who describes another 8 COPD patients with IA and universally fatal outcome [16]. Guinea et al. from Madrid recently presented results from a large series of IA cases in association with COPD (n = 57) [17]. Steroids were identified as a risk factor in 98% of patients, with 74% of patients having received total doses of > 700 mg. Most cases of IA in COPD patients had only lung involvement, but 2 patients also had probable brain involvement. Data from the same group also revealed that COPD became the leading underlying disease associated with IA (52.4% of cases), far more frequent than classical conditions such as haematological malignancies (15.2%) [18].",

The use of High Efficiency Particulate Air (HEPA) filtration reduces the risk of IA but does not reduce it to zero, probably partly because patients may be colonised before admission to the ICU, partly because of breaks in airflow. Pittet described two patients who developed fatal IA in the ICU. In retrospect, high concentrations of airborne Aspergillus spores could be found, closely related to air filter change in the ICU [23]. Besides the airborne route, contaminated water has been implicated as a source of infection [24]. A study of ventilators as a source of infection has not been undertaken.

This can be present in patients with defective mucociliary clearance and structural changes in the bronchial wall. These changes are present in almost every mechanically ventilated patient, making them particularly susceptible to colonisation. IA will not develop in these patients unless a critical level of immunodeficiency has been reached. The second type of interaction is allergic in nature and is beyond the scope of this review (these are discussed in other chapter in this book). The most relevant form of interaction for ICU physicians is the invasive disease that develops in persons with impaired immunity. The aggressive angioinvasive form is frequently encountered in neutropenic patients, whereas cavitating infiltrates are observed most frequently in patients on steroids, patients with COPD, cirrhosis, and solid organ transplant recipients. Other more rare presentations include endocarditis, wound infections, mediastinitis (post-cardiac surgery), infection of vascular grafts, and osteomyelitis. These are occasionally a problem in immunocompromised patients and may occur as outbreaks. Infection of the central nervous system is frequently an ominous sign and may arise from haematogenous seeding (in which the lung is the most common primary site) or spread from the sinuses or following neurosurgery.",

Although very useful in the haematological patient [29], serum GM is not a sensitive marker for IA in the non-neutropenic individual, as demonstrated in lung and liver transplant recipients [30, 31]. Viable fungi could endure in the lung tissue (with encapsulation by an inflammatory process), while circulating markers remain undetectable because of clearance by circulating neutrophils. BAL fluid could be a better specimen for GM detection as recently was demonstrated in a prospective study performed in a medical ICU in a tertiary referral hospital [10]. This is reinforced by the data with the solid organ transplant population [32\u201334]. On the other hand, GM testing in BAL fluid samples seems very promising for the diagnosis of IA in non-neutropenic patients [10, 35]. Results from a single ICU showed that test sensitivity and specificity were 88 and 87%, respectively using a cut-off of 0.5 for BAL testing. In contrast, the sensitivity of serum GM was 42% only. A bit of caution, however, is required with this, since the best cut-off for GM testing in BAL fluid samples is still a matter of debate. It has been demonstrated experimentally that the dynamics of IA result in higher and earlier release of GM in the alveoli, in comparison to the endothelial compartment [36]. Accordingly, many studies have shown that testing GM in BAL fluid samples result in higher optical densities than testing sera [33, 37]. In a study with non-immunocompromised patients, all cases of IA were associated with GM optical densities of \u2265 1.18 in the BAL [34]. A higher cut-off value for BAL has also been suggested by other authors, in comparison to sera [32, 33]. False-positive results have been observed when BAL is tested for GM in patients colonised with Aspergillus species, particularly lung transplant recipients [32] (Dr. Pasqualotto, unpublished data).",
