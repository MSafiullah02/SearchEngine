The larger protein is a primary envelope glycoprotein (VP-3; encoded by ORF5) that is generally heterogenous in size (25\u201340 kDa) due to varying amounts of glycosylation [4]. Li et al.

Since breakage of the disulfide bond(s) in virions resulted in a loss of viral infectivity, the linkage between M/VP-2 and VP-3 seems to be required for host cell entry, perhaps by generating the virion receptor attachment site. Further analysis of the functional properties of VP-3-M/VP-2 heterodimer envelope proteins of LDV will require antibodies directed specifically against each envelope protein. Although much effort has been invested toward the generation of several specific antibodies against LDV VP-3 [7], almost no antibodies that react consistently with virion M/VP-2 have been produced in studies using various immunological methods of analysis such as immunoprecipitation, Western blotting and immunofluorescence. It has been reported that anti-LDV antibodies raised in mice to peptides of ORF6 protein weakly immunoprecipitated in vitro-synthesized ORF6 protein, but even these antibodies did not consistently react with virion M/VP-2 [8]. As a first step to examine the biological and functional properties of LDV M/VP-2, we prepared newly generated specific antibody against LDV ORF6.",

Considering the postulated N-terminal ectodomain of ORF6 protein (nine amino acids), which is too short to be an efficient immunogen, a suitable antigenic site for production of specific antibody was predicted as being located in the C-terminal region, which may be located on the cytoplasmic side of the membrane. For this reason, the C-terminal amino acid sequence of the LDV-C ORF6 protein was screened according to Hopp and Woods method [10] for predicting an antigenic region on the basis of hydrophilicity plots. A peptide H2N-CVLGGKKAVSKG-COOH, corresponding to the residue sequence 151\u2013161 in the C-terminal region of LDV-C ORF6 protein, had an extra cysteine-NH2 residue on the N-terminus; this residue was added to allow coupling to the carrier, and was chosen and synthesized by the solid phase method based on Fmoc-chemistry [11] following carrier conjugation to keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH) as described in a report by Liu et al.

As shown in Fig. 3C\n, clear fluorescence was distributed throughout the cytoplasm of the infected macrophages. The frequency of antigen-positive cells was approximately 5\u20137%, which was similar to the results obtained from immunostaining using mouse hyperimmune serum by Inada and Mims [17]. It was indicated that no fluorescence was detected in infected macrophages probed with pre-immune #36 IgG (Fig. 3A) and in normal macrophages probed with Ab#36 (Fig. 3B).",

            "text": "The results of this study suggest that antibodies raised against a peptide corresponding to the C-terminal region of LDV ORF6 protein are able to specifically recognize LDV virion structural envelope protein M/VP-2, as determined by in Western blotting and immunofluorescence analysis. However, in spite of successful production of the specific antibody against virion M/VP-2 achieved in this study, obtaining specific antibodies against M/VP-2 has been very difficult. Other researchers have reported similar difficulties; for example, Coutelier et al. [18] were unable to detect an anti-M/VP-2 response in infected mice, despite a strong response to VP-3. Moreover, in another study, antisera consistently reactive to virion M/VP-2 were not obtained by immunization of animals with bovine serum albumin (BSA)-conjugated synthetic peptides against the C-terminal region of ORF6 protein, which was the same antigenic site chosen in this study [8]. Failure in generating such antibodies may have been due to the immunization methods. It has been reported that KLH and BSA may activate cell mediators such as antigen-presenting cells by different mechanisms due to their respective sizes and their capacities to concentrate in lymphoid centers [19]. Previous study has also shown that peptides coupled with KLH could mimic epitopes present on the native protein structure more accurately than they could those coupled to BSA, with the result that peptides coupled to KLH more efficiently stimulated the immune response [20]. In the same study, it was also reported that plasma raised from peptide coupled to KLH reacted with MHV spike glycoprotein, as shown by Western blotting, whereas the plasma raised from BSA-conjugated peptide reacted only with carrier protein or with spike glycoprotein and carrier protein. A more likely explanation for the difficulty in production of anti-peptide antisera against LDV ORF6 protein may be that linear epitopes do not form a significant part of the antigenic structure, and that conformation-dependent epitopes predominate.",
