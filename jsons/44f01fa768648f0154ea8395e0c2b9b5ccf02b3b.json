In the RT-PCR technique, viral isolates are used as a primary substrate to perform an assay that identifies a specific virus and its gene sequence [18] . A CT scan is considered more sensitive than RT-PCR, and can be used to confirm a positive RT-PCR test [19] . To conduct RT-PCR, a sample taken from throat swabs, urine, saliva or stool can be used. Usually the nucleic acid test is repeated for a single patient in order to get accurate results. Two tests are performed successively at a gap of 24 h when the virus is not observed in the throat swab sample. If RT-PCR is not available, a serological test could also be use for diagnostic examination [15] .",

It may have a disastrous health impact on neonates, causing symptoms such as respiratory distress (shortness of breath), high heart rate and gastrointestinal distress. Reportedly, initial symptoms of neonates from infected mothers were shortness of breath, cough and fever, but vertical transmission of infection (the transfer of the pathogen from infected mother to infant during the period before or after birth, particularly via germ cell and placental blood) has not been confirmed [3, 7] . Based on the results of a retrospective study of ten neonates born to nine pregnant woman with confirmed COVID-19 in China, vertical transmission of 2019-nCov to neonates has not yet been confirmed [3] . To decrease the risk of vertical transmission, delayed cord clamping (DCC) is not recommended. Moreover, mother-baby contact is also not advisable [7] . However, as a precautionary measure, neonates should be kept isolated for 14 days. When breastfeeding, it is advisable to use a breast pump to minimize the risk of transmitting the infection [21] .",
