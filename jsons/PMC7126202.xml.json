For proteins, such flexibility can arise from large-scale motions of domains or portions of the polypeptide chain such as surface loops and chain termini. Such motions may be reduced or eliminated by redesign of the protein construct (for instance, to remove disordered terminal extensions) or by binding to a \u201ccrystallization chaperone\u201d which might be as large as an antibody fragment (Iwata et al., 1995) or as small as a chemical inhibitor (Ren et al., 1995). In addition, if poorly ordered crystals are obtained, diffraction can sometimes be improved by controlled dehydration (see, for instance, Esnouf et al., 1998 and Heras et al., 2003). Bioinformatics and experimental approaches can be used to detect and perhaps control large-scale disorder (Esnouf et al., 2006, Yang et al., 2005, Geerlof et al., 2006, Stroh et al., 2005) and the use of thermostable versions of proteins may also help (Adams et al., 2003, Lesley et al., 2002), as these might be expected to be more rigid at temperatures lower than experienced in vivo.",

One approach to this problem has been to selectively mutate these residues to smaller hydrophobic residues. Initially described by Lawson et al. (1991), where the diffraction quality of human ferritin crystals was greatly improved by the mutation of an exposed lysine to a glutamine, microengineering of flexible surface residues has produced some remarkable crystallization successes. The Derewenda laboratory has championed such approaches and the state of the art is described in a recent review (Derewenda and Vekilov, 2006). Particular attention has been given to the mutation of large charged residues such as lysine (Longenecker et al., 2001, McElroy et al., 1992) and glutamate (Mateja et al., 2002). While such \u201csurface-entropy-reduction mutagenesis\u201d is now an established technique, it remains a time- and labor-intensive procedure which requires the production of modified expression constructs. In addition, in the absence of structural knowledge, it is quite possible that key stabilizing salt bridges might be inadvertently targeted for destruction.",

            "text": "Surface engineering of proteins by chemical modification offers a radically different approach to reducing surface entropy and has led to some dramatic successes, none more so than the first application by the Rayment laboratory to a fragment of myosin (Rayment et al., 1993). This approach offers several advantages: first, recloning, expression, and purification steps are eliminated; second, modification of the mature protein avoids the possibility of inducing misfolding of the nascent polypeptide chain (Rypniewski et al., 1993); and third, only those residues on the exposed surface of the protein will be modified, not those protected in the protein core or buried in strong protein-protein interfaces. Conversely, such a \u201cshotgun\u201d method will indiscriminately label residues which may be critical for biological function. The most common approach to chemical modification has been the reductive methylation of free amino groups in which primary amines (i.e., lysine residues and the N terminus) are modified to tertiary amines. Originally used as a method of isotope labeling (Means and Feeney, 1968, Rice and Means, 1971), this has proven value for protein crystallization, allowing, in certain instances, the formation of diffraction-quality crystals for proteins that had previously proved refractory to crystallization (Kobayashi et al., 1999, Kurinov et al., 2000, Rayment et al., 1993, Saxena et al., 2006, Schubot and Waugh, 2004).",

The methylation reaction is performed overnight in 50 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 250 mM NaCl at protein concentrations of 1 mg/ml or less. Twenty microliters freshly prepared 1 M dimethylamine-borane complex (ABC; Fluka product 15584) and 40 \u03bcl 1 M formaldehyde (made from 37% stock; Fluka product 33220) are added per ml protein solution, and the reactions are gently mixed and incubated at 277K for 2 hr. A further 20 \u03bcl ABC and 40 \u03bcl formaldehyde are added and the incubation continued for 2 hr. Following a final addition of 10 \u03bcl ABC, the reaction is incubated overnight at 277K. In some cases, the reaction leads to a significant amount of precipitated protein (occasionally over 50%), which is removed by centrifugation before purification of the soluble methylated protein by size-exclusion chromatography columns (S75 or S200 Superdex 16/60 on \u00c4kta express FPLC systems; GE Healthcare) pre-equilibrated in 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 200 mM NaCl. Appropriate peak fractions are pooled and concentrated in centrifugal concentrators (Vivascience) to appropriate concentrations (as determined by a precrystallization test; PCT; Hampton Research).

As a consequence, the formaldehyde and reductant are in greater excess over the number of free amines on the protein, producing no adverse effects and perhaps helping to ensure the homogeneous modification observed (see below). Similarly, the reaction is not quenched with a high concentration of ammonium sulfate, as this also frequently led to precipitation; instead, quenching is performed by the Tris-HCl buffer used for the postreaction size-exclusion chromatography by reaction with the amines of the buffer (in line with the observation of Rayment, 1997 that any primary amine can be used to quench). This purification step also separates the protein from excess reagents and monitors protein quality and oligomeric state.",

An N-terminal His6-tagged form of the protein was expressed, purified and the tag removed, using established protocols (Ren et al., 2005, Siebold et al., 2005). The protein showed two distinct oligomeric states in gel filtration, assumed to be tetrameric and dimeric. Extensive crystallization trials (approximately 800 conditions) on both oligomeric forms (in the presence of the cofactor pyridoxal 5\u2032-phosphate) at both 15 and 22 mg/ml yielded no crystal hits and so reductive methylation was attempted. Mass spectrometry analysis revealed that 20 out of 21 potential sites were fully methylated, reducing the pI from 5.5 to 5.2. Methylated dimeric protein at \u223c15 mg/ml crystallized at 298K within a few hours in high salt conditions. Crystals grown from optimized conditions were used for data collection and the structure was determined by molecular replacement to 2.9 \u00c5. In the crystal, four lysine residues are located at the crystallographic interfaces between the dimers. It is presumably the modification of these residues which allows crystal formation. A paper describing the structure in greater detail is currently in preparation (K.-F.A., J.R., T.S.W., C.M., K. Harlos, D.I.S., and R.M. Esnouf, unpublished data).",

The methyltransferase domain of nonstructural protein 5 (NS5) was chosen for structural analysis. Based on bioinformatic analysis (Albeck et al., 2006, Esnouf et al., 2006, Yang et al., 2005) and alignment with a related structure from Dengue virus (Egloff et al., 2002), a number of constructs were cloned and expressed. Although several constructs gave soluble protein, no crystals suitable for X-ray diffraction analysis were grown. Methylation of the protein modified 19 out of 22 sites and produced three different crystal forms, all of which diffracted to better than 2.1 \u00c5. The majority of crystals grew from either 20% PEG3350 or high salt conditions. Upon methylation, the pI of the protein shifted from >10 to 9.2. In one crystal form, nine lysines are involved in crystal contacts (\nFigure 1). A paper describing the structure of this protein is currently in preparation (R.A., J.R., A.V., T.S.W., D.

After reductive methylation, all 11 potential methylation sites were modified and the pI of the protein was reduced from 9.5 to 8.6.

Used with proteolysis and mass spectrometry, methylation could also be used to define candidate residues for the mutagenesis approach to surface engineering (Derewenda and Vekilov, 2006). It has been reported that methylated proteins usually display reduced solubility (Schubot and Waugh, 2004). In our test cases the concentration required for crystallization, as judged by the use of the PCT, is reduced to between two thirds and one third of that for the unmodified samples. We also observed a shift to higher apparent molecular weight as determined by the size-exclusion clean-up step, and is in line with previous reports (Kurinov et al., 2000, Schubot and Waugh, 2004).

            "text": "Another effect on the biophysical properties of the proteins upon methylation is a reduction in the pI. In the three cases where methylation led to structure determination, a measurable reduction in pI was observed. Intriguingly, these observations correlate with data previously reported for proteins of Thermotoga maritima, where plotting predicted pI and average hydropathy reveals that the majority of the proteins whose structures were solved have calculated pIs below 7.0 (Canaves et al., 2004). It is possible that this in part reflects a bias in the commercial crystallization screens currently available; however, the trend has been seen with other proteomes (Au et al., 2006). An alternative explanation for the tendency for proteins with a high pI to fail to crystallize might be that they have a high concentration of surface lysines. These side chains are likely, through entropic effects, to destabilize the crystal lattice. Conversely, the hydrophobic nature of the dimethylated lysines will favor protein-protein interactions. In line with this, well-ordered lysines are found to be involved in crystal contacts in all three of the proteins solved, and it is well known that hydrophobic interactions of methylated lysines drive the formation of certain protein complexes, notably in the interaction of histone tails with chromodomains (Flanagan et al., 2005). The change in chemistry of the free amide groups affects other biophysical properties, reducing the solubility of proteins and sometimes changing the oligomeric state. Overall, the effects of methylation on the behavior of proteins in crystallization experiments are likely to be complex; nevertheless, the significant success rate we have observed in a set of test proteins has led us to adopt methylation as a simple generic rescue tool.",
