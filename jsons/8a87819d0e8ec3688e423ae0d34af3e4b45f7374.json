The simple and rapid detection techniques with high sensitivity and specificity are always urgently needed. However, the current nucleic acid detection techniques are still limited the traditional amplification and hybridization. To overcome the limitation, we here develop a CRISPR/Cas9-assisted DNA detection (CADD). In this detection, DNA sample is incubated with a pair of capture sgRNAs (sgRNAa and sgRNAb) specific to a target DNA, dCas9, a signal readout-related probe, and an oligo-coated solid support beads or microplate at room temperature for 15 min. During this incubation, the dCas9-sgRNA-DNA complex is formed and captured on solid support by the capture sequence of sgRNAa and the signal readout-related probe is captured by the capture sequence of sgRNAb.",

Especially, by designing a set of sgRNAs specific to 15 high-risk human papillomaviruses (HPVs), the HPV infection in 64 clinical cervical samples were successfully detected by the method. All detections can be finished in 30 minutes at room temperature. This detection holds promise for rapid on-the-spot detection or point-of-care testing (POCT).",

Immediately, the HOLMESv2 (HOLMES2.0) and CDetection technology were developed by using the collateral cleavage activity to single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) of Cas12b (also known as C2c1) (32, 33) . These methods are demonstrated to have attomolar sensitivity and single-base specificity. The ultrahigh sensitivity of these methods partially rely on the signal amplification resulted from collateral cleavage activity of related Cas enzymes. These methods are therefore used to detect various pathogenic viruses such as Zika virus (ZIKV) (24, 25) , dengue virus (DENV) (24) , human papillomavirus (HPV) (28) , Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) (32) , African swine fever virus s (ASFV) (34) , and Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) (35) . Recently, these techniques are striving to detect SARS-CoV-2 (36) (37) (38) (39) (40) (41) . However, these CRISPR Cas-based detection methods typically require DNA pre-amplification with polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (31) , reverse transcription-RPA (RT-RPA) (25) , recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA) (25, 27, 28, 34, 35) , Loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) (32, 39) , reverse transcription-LAMP (RT-LAMP) (32, 39) , and asymmetric PCR (32) . These pre-amplifications also partially contribute to the ultrahigh sensitivity of these methods.",

In this method, a pair of capture sgRNAs (sgRNAa and sgRNAb) are designed for a target DNA. SgRNAa and sgRNAb harbor a different 3\u2032 terminal capture sequence. When target DNA is bound by a pair of dCas9-sgRNA complexes, the dCas9-sgRNA-DNA complex will be captured on surface of beads or microplate via annealing between an oligonucleotide coupled on solid supports and capture sequence of sgRNAa. Then the captured dCas9-sgRNA-DNA complex is reported by a kind of signal reporter captured by the capture sequence of sgRNAb. This method was validated by detecting DNA of bacteria, cancer cell and virus. Especially, by designed a set of sgRNAs specific to 15 high-risk human papillomaviruses (HPVs), this study successfully detected 64 clinical cervical samples with this method. Of importance, a target DNA can be rapidly detected in less than 30 minutes using a signal readout of fluorescent hybridization chain reaction (HCR). This method has its unique advantages over the current methods such as free of enzyme, pre-amplification, modular heaters, simplicity and rapidness.",

HeLa and SiHa cells are known with HPV18 and HPV16 infection, respectively, and C-33a is known without HPV infection. The results indicate that the HeLa gDNA was detected by sgRNA18 and sgRNAct, the SiHa gDNA was detected by sgRNA16 and sgRNAct, and C-33a gDNA was not detected by any sgRNA (Fig. S2 ). These results indicate that Beads-HCR CADD is qualified for detection of more complicated DNA sample than HPV plasmid. In order to investigate whether Beads-HCR CADD can be used to detect clinical sample, we then detected 31 clinical DNA samples with sgRNAsp of 15 hrHPVs and sgRNAct. The results are shown as Fig. 4 and supplementary File 2. We compared the HPV detection results of these 31 clinical samples tested by Beads-HCR CADD and PCR-reverse dot hybridization method that was performed by Jinling Hospital (Fig. 4C ). In comparison with the hospital tests, the hrHPV infection (yes or no) and genotype are accurately detected by Beads-HCR CADD with 100% sensitivity and specificity. Importantly, the Beads-HCR CADD also found multiple infections in samples 2, 11, and 37 that were not detected by the PCR-reverse dot hybridization (Fig. 4C ). These multiple infections were confirmed by a PCR re-detection (PCR-rd) (Fig. S3 ), in which HPV45 and HPV59 infection were detected by PCR using primers specific to the two HPVs (Supplementary method and Table S3 ). These results indicate that Beads-HCR CADD can be used to detect hrHPV infections in clinical samples with high sensitivity and specificity. Finally, to investigate whether DNA other than virus DNA could be detected by Beads-HCR CADD, we also detected two types of other DNA. One is bacterium DNA and the other is human oncogenic DNA (Supplementary methods). The sgRNAs targeting T7 RNA polymerase DNA and oncogenic telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) promoter were designed (Table S1 ). The results indicate that the T7 RNA polymerase DNA fragment could be quantitatively detected by Beads-HCR ( Fig. S4A and S4B ). In addition, the subsequent detection of gDNA from two different E. coli (DH5\u03b1 and BL21) indicate that the T7 RNA polymerase DNA in BL21 gDNA could be also specifically and quantitatively detected by Beads-HCR CADD ( Fig. S4C and S4D ). The DH5\u03b1 gDNA that contains no T7 RNA polymerase DNA did not produce fluorescence signal even at the highest amount ( Fig. S4C and S4D ). The detection of TERT 8 promoter DNA indicate that the ontogenetic TERT promoter can be specifically detected by Beads-HCR CADD using a sgRNAs targeting mutated TERT promoter (Fig. S5) . The mutant TERT promoter causes expression of telomerase, which results in malignant cell proliferation in more than 90% of cancers. It should be noted that the detected TERT promoter has only one base difference between the wild-type and mutant genotype (Fig. S6) , indicating that CADD has high specificity that can discriminate single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP).",

We also verified three forms of CADD method by detecting 15 hrHPV plasmids and as many 64 clinical cervical samples. These investigations demonstrate the feasibility and reliability of CADD method. In comparison, CADD has its unique advantages over the current CRISPR-based nucleic acid detection methods. Different from the current widely known CRISPR-based nucleic acid detection methods that mainly rely on Cas enzymes with collateral cleavage activity such as Cas13a, Cas12a, Cas12b, and Cas14, we develops a new DNA detection method based on a most widely used Cas protein, CRSIPR/Cas9, that has no collateral cleavage activity. CADD relies on neither the specific enzymatic activity nor non-specific collateral cleavage activity of CRISPR/Cas proteins as all the current CRISPR-based methods. Therefore, CADD is mechanistically distinct from the current CRISPR-based methods (such as SHERLOCK, DECTECTR, and HOLMES). CADD employs dCas9 that has no enzymatic activity. CADD uses the dCas9-sgRNA as a DNA-binding complex with high sequence specificity.",

Although the current CRISPR-based methods are reported to have ultrahigh detection sensitivity (aM), they are all challenged by tedious pre-treatments to DNA/RNA samples including various amplifications using RPA, LAMP, PCR, asymmetric PCR and in vitro transcription. These pre-amplifications not only complicate the detection process and increase the detection time and cost, but also may increase false negative, because pre-amplification with various DNA polymerases may introduce mutations into DNA that is then enzymatically detected by various Cas proteins. Importantly, amplicon spread and contamination is always a serious issue in all detection spots. CADD needs no any pre-treatment to DNA sample. Beads-HCR CADD is an enzyme-free method.",

The Beads-HCR CADD uses fluorescent readout by employing the fluorescently labeled HCR hairpins. The Beads/Microplate-ELISA uses colorimetric readout, in which the TMB color development catalyzed by streptavidin-coupled HRP is used as a visual readout. The Beads/Microplate-ELISA CADD is an instrument-free test. In addition, the Microplate-ELISA assay allows automatic measurement of hundreds of samples on standard plate reader in a high-throughput format. The whole detection process of Beads-HCR and Microplate-ELISA can be finished in 30 minutes, holding promise for rapid on-the-spot detection or point-of-care testing (POCT). In fact, other forms of CADD signal readouts can be realized by a few changes of the solid support and signal reporter, such as lateral flow readout, nano-gold colorimetric assay, and molecular beacon-HCR. 10 The high specificity of CADD has close relationship with the high sequence specificity of dCas9-sgRNA as a DNA-binding complex. Additionally, the high specificity of CADD is also dependent on its unique detection mechanism, in which a pair of sgRNAs commonly determine the final detection results, providing a double-insurance sequence-specific detection. This overcomes the potential false positive results resulted from potential off-target binding of one dCas9-sgRNA. This problem still challenges all current CRISPR-based methods including SHERLOCK, DECTECTR and HOLMES, in which only one-site target cutting can activate a collateral cleavage activity. Due to the signal amplification produced by collateral cleavage activity, detections based on such one-site activation may be prone to false positives.",
