It limits UV exposure to the 113 involved areas only, making it ideal for localized disease (less than 10% body surface area) as 114 well as difficult-to-treat areas like the scalp, palms, and soles. 4 It can produce results with as 115 little as eight treatment sessions as compared to conventional NB-UVB, thereby reducing the 116 cumulative UV dose. 4, 18 117Outside the realm of psoriasis, NB-UVB is a first-line UV-based treatment option for 118 many conditions including vitiligo, early mycosis fungoides, and atopic dermatitis. UVA1 119 penetrates deeper into the dermis and has demonstrated benefit for sclerosing skin disorders such 120 as morphea and scleroderma. 19 NB-UVB and UVA1 are also useful for therapeutic hardening of 121 patients with polymorphous light eruption and solar urticaria, respectively. 20 For treatment-122 resistant dermatitis of the hands and feet, topical PUVA is frequently used. Oral PUVA is helpful 123 for plaque stage mycosis fungoides, other forms of cutaneous lymphoma, and as a second-line inadequately to NB-UVB.21  The list of photo-responsive dermatoses is long which underscores 126 the versatility of this treatment modality.127 Biologics are injected or infused monoclonal antibodies that block specific pro-128 inflammatory cytokines or receptors implicated in the pathophysiology of psoriasis and other 129 inflammatory diseases. 16, 22 These agents are grouped according to their cytokine target(s) as 130 follows: tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors (etanercept, infliximab, adalimumab, 131 certolizumab), interleukin (IL)-12/IL-23 inhibitor (ustekinumab), IL-17 inhibitors (secukinumab, 132 ixekizumab, brodalumab), and IL-23 inhibitors (guselkumab, tildrakizumab, risankizumab-133 rzaa). 22 A 2019 meta-analysis found risankizumab-rzaa to be the most efficacious biologic for 134 psoriasis, followed by ixekizumab, guselkumab, and brodalumab. 23 Kim et al noted that IL-17 135 inhibitors have the earliest onset of efficacy. The fastest, brodalumab, attained a 50% reduction 136 in Psoriasis Area and Severity Index score (PASI 50) in less than 2 weeks and PASI 75 in 4 137 weeks. The IL-17 inhibitors were also among the biologic agents that had the most sustained 138 activity together with the IL-23 inhibitors and IL-12/23 inhibitor. 24 139 A comparative study by Inzinger et al. showed that the efficacy rates of oral PUVA were 140 comparable to infliximab, and exceeded those of etanercept, efalizumab, alefacept, adalimumab, 141 and ustekinumab. 25 Additionally, a recent trial comparing patient reported outcomes of NB-UVB 142 versus adalimumab versus placebo revealed that improvements in overall health-related quality 143 of life scores were equivalent for both active interventions after 12 weeks. 26 144 145 Safety and Side Effect Profile 146 tenderness, erythema, tanning, and blister formation. 18 For PUVA, the application or ingestion of 148 a photosensitizer can incite skin phototoxicity, nausea, and/or vomiting. 18 The true risk of UV-149 induced skin cancer has long been a subject of debate and is a cause of hesitation for patients and 150 providers alike. PUVA has been found to significantly increase the risk of squamous cell 151 carcinoma in a dose-dependent manner, while the incidence of PUVA-induced melanoma and 152 basal cell carcinoma is much lower. 14, 27 NB-UVB and UVA1 have had no evidence of increased 153 risk of photocarcinogenesis and are considered safe with proper supervision by most 154 practitioners. 14, 27, 28 155 These risks can be mitigated via thoughtful patient and modality selection, proper dosing 156 and dose adjustment, protection of uninvolved areas, monitoring of cumulative UV dose, and 157 periodic full body skin examinations. 14 With the exception of PUVA, phototherapy does not 158 require any pre-treatment laboratory workup and can be safely administered to pediatric, elderly, 159 and pregnant patients. 160 The side effects and safety of biologic medications should also be considered. With 161 proper patient screening, biologics have demonstrated good safety, particularly when compared 162 to traditional systemic agents; 24 however, long-term data is scarce. Patients on biologics have an 163 increased risk of infections due to the immunomodulatory effects of the medication. TNF 164 inhibitors have specifically been associated with an elevated risk of tuberculosis, hepatitis B, 165 lymphoma, and other malignancies, while IL-17 inhibitors have been shown to induce and 166 exacerbate inflammatory bowel disease, and increase the risk for mucocutaneous candidiasis. 24, 29 167 Depression and suicidality have been reported among patients on brodalumab, although evidence To minimize these risks, patients who are candidates for biologic therapy require workup 171 prior to initiation and at regular intervals throughout treatment. Laboratory tests consisting of a 172 complete blood count, liver function test, hepatitis panel, and tuberculosis screening are regularly 173 performed. 22, 30 Additional tests may be warranted depending on patient-specific or medication-174 specific risk factors. Recent guidelines suggest that certain biologic agents may be safely 175 administered to pregnant, lactating, and pediatric patients; however, information regarding this is 176 still limited. 22, 31 177The COVID-19 pandemic raised numerous questions regarding biologics' safety, which 178 lack clear, evidence-based answers. Based from experience with HIV-positive patients, and in 179 keeping with the practice of social distancing, home phototherapy is a reasonable option during 180",

The least expensive biologic included in the study, adalimumab, was quoted at 190 $23,538 for the first year of therapy alone compared to $3,148 and $7,582 for a year of NB-UVB fold ($58,045) for the first year of therapy alone. 34 193 Home phototherapy units cost anywhere between $2,500 and $5,000. 35, 36 They can offset 194 the indirect expenses incurred from office-based treatment (transportation, lost income from 195 work absences, inconvenience), but a disadvantage is that patients must pay for the device 196 upfront as few insurance policies offer coverage. A comparative study revealed that while in-197 office phototherapy was less costly at the beginning of treatment, it became five times more 198 expensive than home phototherapy after 3 months. 36 Additionally, when compared to biologics, 199 home phototherapy costs up to 36 times less over a 3-year period. 37 200 Biologics have remarkable efficacy, a good safety record to date, and are convenient to 201administer. This may provide rationale for physicians and patients to justify the high cost, 202 especially when factoring in the intangible phototherapy expenses.

Patients with moderate to severe psoriasis who complied with thrice weekly NB-UVB 227 in addition to etanercept demonstrated biopsy-proven improvement without additional adverse 228 effects compared to etanercept alone. 38, 44 Moreover, a half-body comparison of adalimumab plus 229 NB-UVB versus adalimumab alone yielded a 33% greater PASI reduction on the irradiated body 230 half compared to the non-irradiated half. 45 Analogous results were obtained in a similar trial on 231 ustekinumab. 46 Erythema was the most common side effect. 45, 46 To date, there are no studies on 232 the combination of PUVA with any biologic. 41 233 234 Limitations of Phototherapy 235 One major challenge concerning adherence to phototherapy is limited access. In the U.S., 236 phototherapy facilities are concentrated in urban areas of the East and West Coasts and the misdistribution appears to reflect the geographic location of dermatology providers in general 239 and not the underutilization of phototherapy per se. Nonetheless, the indirect costs of travel and 240 lost income from missing work can discourage patients from complying with repeated 241 phototherapy treatments. 6 Other limiting factors are the resources needed to establish a 242 phototherapy center (equipment, space, trained staff), and the need for prior authorization. 243 Home phototherapy devices can potentially address these hurdles. Several randomized 244 trials have shown that home-based and office-based phototherapy are equally safe and effective 245with higher satisfaction and adherence in favor of home phototherapy; however, this also entails 246 higher upfront costs for the patient as well as the need for a provider who is sufficiently familiar 247 with home phototherapy. 47 In addition, phototherapy has possible long-term risks. Therefore, in 248 practice, it is usually administered intermittently, and patients may experience disease relapses 249 within weeks to months of discontinuation. Combining phototherapy with other modalities can 250 not only decrease the likelihood or severity of a relapse but also lower the risk of side effects 251 from either modality alone. With proper patient education, home-based phototherapy is another 252",
