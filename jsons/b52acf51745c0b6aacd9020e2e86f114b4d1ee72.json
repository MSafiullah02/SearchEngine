To do so, scholars have emphasized the importance of character. The COVID-19 outbreak presented leaders of public, private and not-for-profit organizations, as well as every day citizens, with enormous challenges; worldwide, individuals' character was tested. The purpose of this paper is to illustrate how character was revealed -in both positive and negative ways -in the actions that leaders and citizens alike displayed during the fight to overcome this pandemic.",

Character shapes a number of things, including but not limited to: what we notice within the context we are operating; how we interact with the world around us; who we engage in conversation and how we conduct those conversations; what we value; how we interpret feedback; what we choose to act upon; how we deal with conflict, disappointment, and setbacks; the goals we set for the organizations we lead; how we communicate; and so forth.",

As such, COVID-19 revealed things about the citizens of affected nations as well as their leaders. Citizens' singing from open windows, balconies and rooftops, for example, served as a powerful reminder that we as individuals could find creative ways to remain connected as medical experts urged us to remain at least six feet apart. Interconnectedness -to sense and value deep connections with others at all levels within organizations, communities, and society -is an important part of the character dimension of collaboration, while drawing upon optimism and appreciating the beauty of art (e.g., music, painting, or poetry) are part of transcendence. As research by Martin Seligman from the University of Pennsylvania has shown, both transcendence and interconnectedness are related to our subjective well-being and happiness.",

In such situations, people's anxiety is likely to increase while their resiliency may suffer. Doug Ford, the premier of Ontario, Canada, received praise from all political parties for the way he ran the province's daily press conferences during the present pandemic. Observers noted the deep empathy he conveyed for the public he serves, especially when he delivered the grim message that between 3,000 and 15,000 Ontarians might die as a result of the pandemic over the next 18 to 24 months. He brought transparency and candor to his briefings, believing that sometimes knowledge is safer to possess than fear.

For one, it means leaders have to be situationally aware and demonstrate a heightened appreciation for circumstances that require Page 8 of 23 J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 8 unique approaches. Furthermore, it requires the skillful analysis of a complex and complicated situation to grasp the essence of the challenges they are facing, and the employment of logical reasoning to determine the requisite action. For example, Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz provided a compelling illustration of this in March, 2020 when he discussed European efforts to head off a paralysis of public health systems. He specifically noted the associated economic damage, \"you have to consider carefully when to adopt these measures, because a national economy cannot handle this over too long a period.\" The challenge that many people observed was that the coronavirus was dominantly a medical attack on the elderly and an economic assault on the younger generations. Therefore, leaders often deal with what academics and design theorists Horst Rittel and Melvin Webber coined \"wicked problems\" -ones that often present themselves in crises -that require both deep insight into the heart of challenging issues and critical thinking about them.",

Countriesbanned the entry of non-residents, and even the Canada -U.S. land border was closed to all non-essential travel in order to stem the spread of the virus.

Two things became abundantly clear during the early days of the pandemic.

Second, as an interconnected world, this deadly viral intruder exposed the limitations and inefficacy of traditional borders, and thus demanded new and adaptive measures in response.",

Research by professor Bradley Owens at Brigham Young University reveals that it is critically important that leaders embrace humility: they must be reflective and respectful of other people's experiences and ideas, and, most importantly, must adopt a mindset committed to continuous learning.

A compelling example of a leader who resisted taking accountability was U.S. President Donald Trump, during one of the many White House press conferences. A journalist asked him about the slow rate of testing for the coronavirus. Instead of sending a \"the-buckstops-here\" message, Trump denied taking the missteps that some health experts say aggravated the crisis. He attempted to project an air of competence by insisting his administration -which disbanded the pandemic response team in 2018 -was doing a \"great job\" dealing with problems left behind by previous administrations. \"I don't take responsibility at all,\" Trump said. \"We were given a set of circumstances and we were given rules, regulations and specifications from a different time.\"",

This tragic episode reinforces an important leadership lesson, namely, to protect the voices from below when the quality of decisions matters.

As we endured the sometimes mundane monotony of voluntary isolation, it is with the optimism that we know there will be a tomorrow.",

Years ago, television personality Fred Rogers said: \"I'm very concerned that our society is much more interested in information, than wonder; in noise, rather than silence. How do we encourage reflection? Oh my, this is a noisy world.\" We therefore end our paper with expressing the hope that individuals reflect on at least two issues. First, at a general level, to consider which behaviors are best left behind in order to progress in today's deeply interconnected world. To put it bluntly, if one community cannot prevent or manage the outbreak of a highly contagious disease then everyone is at risk; we need a coordinated approach to defeat a common threat. Second, to reflect on the importance of character. And, most importantly, consider how each of us can raise the bar in our respective personal and professional lives by working to develop strength of character, striving to make a difference, and contributing to the flourishing of teams, organizations, communities, and societies.",

            "text": "Italian lawmakers provided a nice contrast with the U.S. response. They understood their grave mistake in having downplayed the seriousness of the virus when it was first detected in the northern region of Lombardy. It appeared that, initially, government agencies were very complacent about the outbreak. For example, Milan, the financial capital of Italy, was at the center of a motivational video that was shared by politicians with the slogan \"Milan does not stop.\" The video contains images of people hugging each other, eating in restaurants, and walking in parks. Politicians quickly admitted they made serious errors in judgment. Tough in rapid succession. In addition,they pleaded with other governments to learn from their mistakes by taking the coronavirus seriously.As noted in a Brookings Institution commentary by Federica Saini Fasanotti, a nonresident fellow in the Foreign Policy program, Italians soon became aware of the problem and responded by making the huge sacrifices the government requested. \"Responsible democracies,\"Fasanotti wrote, \"share information, transparently, with their citizens. They spread knowledge to enable solutions. Such transparency requires courage among political leaders, but is highly precious because it promotes confidence among citizens.\"To be effective, individuals in leadership positions must also act with integrity. They need to be truthful and straightforward with themselves and others, while remaining open and honest in relationships and communications, even in the most difficult situations. They must accurately represent to others what they truly believe, and in doing so demonstrate a high personal and professional moral standard. For example, Anthony Fauci, the Director of the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, showed a high degree of integrity when communicating with the American public while testifying at a House hearing on March 12, 2020, shortly after the first COVID-19 death was reported in Washington state. Fauci noted candidly that public health experts didn't even have a good understanding of how widely the virus had spread in the United States. As for testing, he stated: \"The system is not really geared to what we need right now. That's a failing. Let's admit it.\" This testimony required courage in addition to integrity. Candor often involves conflict because it may get rejected and/or foster resentment.",

            "text": "Chinese, in turn, argued patient zero might be an American. Saudi Arabia blamed its high outbreak numbers on Iran. Iran, in turn, blamed the epidemic on American bioweapon development. South Korea and Japan blamed each other. All this finger pointing made international collaboration difficult when it was needed most. Mary Crossan and her colleagues have argued that when you are collaborative, you recognize that what happens to someone, somewhere, can affect everyone, anywhere. Leaders who are collaborative value and actively support the development and maintenance of positive relationships among people. The Italians understood this. Instead of smearing China in public, the nation's officials offered support when China was was being hit hard by the coronavirus. When the tables turned, and the death toll in Italy dramatically increased, the Italians sought help from the international community. China responded by sending expertise and supplies. Matthew Syed, the author of Rebel Ideas: The Power of Diverse Thinking, discussed the research of Wharton professor Adam Grant on givers and takers: people with a giving approach are flourishing in a world of interdependency. The evidence also shows that the most successfulgivers are strategic, seeking diversity and cutting off selfish people who want to exploit them.",
