Untreated, the prognosis of ALF is very poor, with a high mortality.

Broadly, the medical management of ALF is supportive until recovery of the native liver or until the liver transplantation is an option. Accordingly, liver transplantation is the only proven treatment option for patients who do not recover spontaneously.",

Signs and symptoms of ALF, including jaundice, ascites, encephalopathy, disseminated intravascular coagulopathy, and hypoglycemia can rapidly progress.

Laboratory findings are elevated serum aspartate aminotransferase/alanine aminotransferase (AST/ALT), hypoglycemia, elevated levels of bilirubin and blood ammonia, low platelet count, and low fibrinogen.

A bolus of Mannitol 0.5\u20131 g/kgc administrated IV, repeated once or twice can correct episodes of ICP elevation and improves survival [24], with the condition to maintain serum osmolality less than 320 mOsm/L.Hyperventilation is a method to reduce elevated ICP, but with limited efficacy over time (after 48 h). Every mmHg reduction of PaCO2, reduces the cerebral blood flow by 2\u20133% and restore autoregulation. Moderate hyperventilation, with a PaCO2 between 25 and 30 mmHg is indicated in patients with severe elevated ICP and at risk of brain herniation.Induced coma with barbiturates (pentobarbital, thiopental) or propofol, in order to reduce cerebral metabolic rate and cerebral blood flow in refractory patients.Glucocorticoids are not indicated and should not be used, because studies have not shown to be beneficial in ALF patients.\n",

Extracorporeal systems that uses albumin as a scavenging molecule are MARS (Molecular Adsorbent Recirculation System) and SPAD (Single-Pass Albumin Dialysis) [31]. Prometheus (Fractionated Plasma Separation and Adsorption) is another form of albumin dialysis [31]. Bleeding is a significant problem for MARS [31]. Even if, MARS is the most studied albumin dialysis technology in ALF, further randomized studies are needed [31]. Overall, extracorporeal liver support systems seem to increase survival in ALF [32] but further studies are a requisite.BAL (Bioartificial liver) system is a bioreactor with liver cells which temporarily replaces the hepatic functions. BAL systems are a temporary option in therapy of ALF or the treatment of acute-on-chronic liver failure [33, 34]. They also can assure for short term the endogenous regeneration of the native liver [33].Plasma exchange has been shown to improve survival in patients with ALF, and to modulate immune dysfunction, if used on timely (first 3 days after ICU admission) [1].\n",
