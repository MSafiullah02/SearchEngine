In addition, some residents are fully responsible for patients with this infection. The strategies to increase the regional intensive care unit (ICU) allowance included the reduction of all surgical activities, starting with elective, to ultimately, also, include some urgent cases. 6 Currently, most of the neurosurgical centers postponed their elective surgeries due the burden of this infection. 4, 5, 8 Furthermore, several programs have reduced the number of residents by 50% of normal, thus keeping the remainder of the residents at home. 7 Almost all neurosurgery programs around the world have changed their academic meetings to online communication in an attempt to reduce physical contact.",

The questionnaire was mainly adapted from the current interim guidance and information for healthcare workers, published by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). 10 Several editorial studies published recently about the impact of the virus on neurosurgery residents was also utilized to create the questionnaire. 5, 7, 8 The target population consists roughly of around 300 residents, comprised of neurosurgery residents from various neurosurgical centers that we chose. A representative sample from Canada, United Stated of America (U.S.A.), Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Serbia and Italy were selected. We divided the regions into North America, which includes Canada and U.S.A. In addition, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait represent the programs in the Arabian Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries. Regarding the European programs, we reached out to residents from Serbia and Italy. Residents from different centers where selected from three different regions, with the number of participants from each region being close to one another. Moreover, we communicated with senior neurosurgeons from these regions, and they provided us with lists of residents with their contacts, which we selected randomly from. Therefore, our sampling procedure comprised of random selection of the participants. In addition, each resident was reached in person via a direct phone call or a text message in order to restrict the data to our inclusion criteria, which involved only neurosurgical residents. Moreover, this method of direct contact facilitated a very high response rate. All neurosurgeons who finished their training or were above the sixth year of the program were excluded from our data.",

They were also assured regarding confidentiality of the collected information, and that they were free to decline participation in the study. One participant who refused to complete the survey was excluded. The questionnaire consisted of three sections and 27 questions. The first section (8 items) involves the baseline information: gender, age, location of the program, year of training, and current health condition. The next section (13 items) contains inquiries about basic biological and microbiological knowledge of this virus 11, 12 , hand hygiene, as well as personal protective equipment (PPE). 10 Additionally, we evaluated whether the subjects received any formal training in hand hygiene, PPE, and N-95 mask handling. The final section (6 items) focuses on the impact of this pandemic on the resident in terms of neurosurgical training, studying, mental health, as well as whether their social life was affected or not. 5, 7, 8 Convenient sampling method was used for data collection, and the distribution of qualitative responses was presented as frequency and percentages. Sub-groups were classified on the basis of gender, age, location of the program, and year of residency training. The Statistical Package for Social Sciences (IBM SPSS Statistics 23, IBM Corporation, Armonk, NY, USA, 2016) was used for data entry and analysis. First, univariate analysis was conducted, and qualitative variables were described by frequency and percentage. The quantitative variable (total knowledge score) was calculated by adding the points for the five knowledge items (each item equals one point). This variable, with a non-normal frequency distribution, was summarized by a median and inter-quartile range. We determined that the cut-off of the satisfactory knowledge level is a total knowledge score \u2265 median. Also, a logistic regression model was used to identify the determinants of low knowledge level. At that point, p-value \u2264 0.05 was used as the cut-off level for statistical significance. Pearson's Chi-square test was utilized to assess the association between the qualitative variables. Mann-Whitney U test was used to compare two groups with a non-normal frequency distribution, while Kruskal-Wallis one-way analysis of variance test was used to compare more than two groups. We tested the association of our questions in relation to age, gender, location of the program, and year of residency training.",

Out of this number, 52 participants returned a completed self-administered questionnaire, and hence, the analysis was based on this number (response rate = 98.1%). Table 1 depicts the descriptive analysis of self-reported baseline information and the current health status of the residents with regard to COVID-19 virus. The majority of the participants were male (73.1%). Concerning the age, 69.2% were below 30 year old, and 30.8% were 30 year-old or above. Regarding the location of the neurosurgery program, the percentage of residents representing each country in our sample were as follow: Canada 36.5%, U.S.A. 9.6%, Kuwait 9.6%, Saudi Arabia 23.1%, and from the European countries (Italy and Serbia) 21.1%. The frequency of participants from each year of the residency (R) training were: (R1) 26.9%, (R2) 11.5%, (R3) 23.1%, (R4) 17.3%, (R5) 15.4% and (R6) 5.8%. Besides, table 1, also shows the current situation of residents in terms of this pandemic: 17.3% were under stay home order by their institution or the government; however, 82.7% are resuming their work at the hospital. In addition, according to our results, 21.2% of the neurosurgery residents were under quarantine or isolation. From our sample, only one resident from Europe tested positive for COVID-19. Furthermore, about 36.5% were negative, the rest, which represent the majority, 61.5%, were not tested for the infection. Almost half of the responders, 48.1%, dealt directly with COVID-19 patients, while the rest did not. Table 2a shows the frequency of correct responses to the five items of the knowledge score about the virus and the safety measures in relation to the location of the program. The number of residents who answered the questions correctly were as follows: 76.9% knew that the virus type, 90.4% knew the main mode of transmission, and 86.5% recognized the most common symptoms. The most accurate estimation of the incubation period of this virus was answered by only 40.4% of participants. Concerning the preferred hand hygiene method in the healthcare settings; unexpectedly, only 51.9% knew the correct answer. The first section of the table also displays the responses according to each location of the program in details, and some of the items showed statistically significant results. In table 2b, we recorded the responses about the training of safety measures, the safe practices, and the strategies of infection control. As expected, receiving a formal hand hygiene training was reported by 78.8%. In addition, receiving formal session of the correct sequence of PPE donning and doffing was stated by 57.7%. Only 50% of our sample knew their correct size of N-95 mask prior to this pandemic. Likewise, only 50% knew how to correctly obtain a nasopharyngeal swab sample. Most of the results in the previously mentioned items were significantly associated with the location of the program.",

This pandemic is evolving rapidly worldwide, disrupting personal and professional life, including that of neurosurgeons and neurosurgical residents. 4 Most programs have seen a significant drop in elective or nonessential surgical volume, impacting the functional neurosurgery cases foremost. 7 Regarding surgeries, around 57.7% in our study agreed that elective neurosurgical procedures should not be resumed during this pandemic ( figure 3-A) . In another editorial, authors stated the following \"we have halted all elective cases, but will continue to schedule urgent and emergent cases, involving head and spine trauma, cauda equina syndrome, embolic stroke, ruptured aneurysms, and acute hydrocephalus are relatively noncontroversial; however, urgent cases such as malignant brain tumors and progressive cervical spondylotic myelopathy may require a more nuanced discussion.\" 4 Responses from our analysis disclosed that only 23% think that brain tumor or compressive spinal cord tumor surgeries should be postponed. In terms of skillset, a trustworthy neurosurgical team should have the ability to treat patients with infectious diseases who also require emergency operations. 8 At the same time, in our survey, most of the residents (\u2248 80%) will only do emergency surgery on a confirmed COVID-19 patient if there are appropriate PPE, while a minority (\u2248 20%) will perform it regardless the presence or absence of PPE; none of the participants refused to perform this surgery in either way ( figure 3-C) . Access to and training on proper PPE use are critical to the safety of workers. 14 When asked about the residents' opinion, if neurosurgical programs should involve a session about PPE every year, around 73% agreed that this session is essential ( figure 3-B) .",
