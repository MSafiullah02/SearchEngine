Hospital preparedness is a key step in strengthening a country's ability to address any public health emergency of international concern caused by these diseases. In India, because 80% of the health-care utilization happens in the private hospitals, it is of at most importance to assess the preparedness level of these hospitals against emerging infectious diseases. Methods: The study was a cross-sectional study, and hospitals which provided consent were included. The estimated participants for the study were 54. Results: The results were expressed in a descriptive manner. For the purpose of analysis, the questionnaire was redistributed based on the monitoring and evaluation framework of International Health Regulations and its core capacities. It was found that there was a need to enhance the preparedness of the hospitals in the response against emerging infectious diseases. There were gaps in the implementation of various plans and protocols for staff training, risk communication, surge capacity, laboratory capacity, and infection control in the hospitals. Conclusion: The findings were suggestive of a need for preparedness of the hospitals against the upsurge of emerging infectious diseases.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "The world today is impacted by emerging infectious diseases on an unprecedented scale. The emerging infectious diseases have the potential to be a public health emergency of international concern and can have major impact on the health and well-being of communities, health systems, steadiness of national economies, and progress toward the sustainable development goals. \"Emerging infectious disease (EID) is the one that has appeared and affected the population for the first time or has existed previously or rapidly increasing either in terms of the number of population affected or its spread to the new geographical area\". 1e3 They are considered to be a major public health problem because of its potential to be used as biological warfare agents and can have a devastating effect on animal and environmental health. 4, 5 One of the other major challenges in combating these diseases is their unpredictable nature and their ability to assume pandemic proportions. 2 Their unpredictable nature also makes it difficult to control the diseases and can cause the spread of infection even across national boundaries. 1 The emerging infectious disease accounts for 26% of the death worldwide and 28% of the global burden of infectious disease. 1,3 In South East Asia, out of the 14 million deaths annually, 40% is due to EIDs. 1 In India, infectious diseases are responsible for half of the total disease burden. 3 For many centuries, infectious diseases such as plague and smallpox have claimed millions of lives. 6 These lead to the adoption of various measures of public health importance after many years. 6 Series of incidents in succession to these events lead to the establishment of International Health Regulations (IHRs) in 1969. 7, 8 But, the requirement for the transformation of IHR was accelerated after the 2002 severe acute respiratory syndrome infection because of its transcontinental transmission. 7 Hence in 2005, IHR was evolved into a full-scale framework with the purpose of building international coordination in the face of a public health emergency of international concern. 9 In Indian context, one of the major events of public health concern occurred in Surat, 1994, which triggered a mass alarm at the national level, which created severe economic loss and disrupted social life. 6 This was followed by many large outbreaks of cholera, diphtheria, scrub typhus, Nipah virus encephalitis, Chandipura virus, H5N1, H1N1, Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever, dengue, chikungunya, and Japanese Encephalitis across the country. 2 The risks of infectious disease outbreaks exhibit the need for more effective collaboration on health security and pandemic preparedness. Hence to enhance the infectious disease surveillance and epidemiological capacity in the country, the government established the Integrated Disease Surveillance Project (IDSP) in 2004. 10, 2 The project, in the long run, got transformed into a program which was decentralized so that there could be immediate detection and response to an outbreak. 10, 2 During an epidemic or pandemic scenario, hospitals will usually be in the frontline to provide necessary care to the community, and in case of an extended or combined outbreak, there could be overwhelming of the health systems, if the institutions are not adequately prepared. 11 Other complexities involved if the hospitals are inadequately prepared is that they might not be able to meet the health-care requirements and control the disease because of various reasons such as overwhelming demand, limited time to coordinate with other stakeholders, and integration of each individual hospital into the response strategy. 12 Hence to prevent these complex consequences, it is important to have prior preparedness plans, response protocols, and standards which is the first step needed to enhance countries preparedness toward an event of public health importance. 13, 14 ", "cite_spans": [{"start": 629, "end": 632, "text": "1e3", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 824, "end": 826, "text": "4,", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 827, "end": 828, "text": "5", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 971, "end": 972, "text": "2", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 1119, "end": 1120, "text": "1", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1414, "end": 1415, "text": "3", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 1516, "end": 1517, "text": "6", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 1611, "end": 1612, "text": "6", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 1741, "end": 1743, "text": "7,", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 1744, "end": 1745, "text": "8", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1918, "end": 1919, "text": "7", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 2102, "end": 2103, "text": "9", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 2311, "end": 2312, "text": "6", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 2549, "end": 2550, "text": "2", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 2874, "end": 2877, "text": "10,", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 2878, "end": 2879, "text": "2", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 3037, "end": 3040, "text": "10,", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 3041, "end": 3042, "text": "2", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 3320, "end": 3322, "text": "11", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 3666, "end": 3668, "text": "12", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3908, "end": 3911, "text": "13,", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 3912, "end": 3914, "text": "14", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "The design of the study was cross-sectional in nature and was conducted between January 2019 and May 2019.
