These materials are also used for the sterilization of medical products,8 power production and other industrial purposes. The most critical issue in this regard is that radio isotopes8 which have short life spans need to be transported to patients preferably by air. The problem arises when the air carrier refuses to carry such radioactive medical supplies.8 It is reported that 60% of such denials relate to air transport and 30% to maritime transport.8\n",

This is due, in part, to lack of information;Concerns about extent and costs of training. The reason for this apprehension is the belief on the part of carriers that extensive training has to be given to those involved in transportation of goods if they are to handle radioactive cargo. The IAEA confirms that this concern is unjustified as all concerned with handling cargo are expected to be given a training session which lasts only for half a day;Multiplicity of authorities regulating the carriage of radioactive cargo and the numerous regulations promulgated nationally;The absence of awareness of the compelling need to transport radioactive medicines and the adequacy of the safety standards in practice; andApprehension of the costs of insurance in the event of accidents.8\n\n",

Those carriers who accepted such cargo would either carry the cargo to their own States or require an indemnity from the State concerned. The meeting also noted that although there was a Resolution of the International Maritime Organization (IMO) requiring ships to carry class 7 cargo, air carriers could not be forced to do so. The International Civil Aviation Organization said for the record that air carriers could only be persuaded to carry class 7 cargo, and not forced to do so.8 The meeting also recognized that although pilots in command were the major protagonists in refusing carriage of radioactive medicines, they were only a small part of responsibility of the pilot and the pilot had to give written reasons as to why the carriage of such goods was refused.8 It must be noted that, at a meeting of the IAEA held in September 2005, the International Federation of Airline Pilots\u2019 Associations (IFALPA) submitted a paper which recognized that there has been an increase in recent years of the number of denials of shipments of radioactive materials by airlines, airports, pilots and States and that such denials are capable of posing problems for hospitals, patients and suppliers of radio pharmaceuticals. The IFALPA Dangerous Goods Committee supported the transport of all classes of dangerous goods, including class 7 material as long as the transport complied with the provisions of Annex 18 to the Chicago Convention on the Carriage of Dangerous Goods by Air and associated Technical Instructions for the Safe Transport of Dangerous Goods. IFALPA emphasized the fact that in consideration of whether a denial is appropriate or not, it was clear that safety is always the overriding factor and that other issues never have priority.8\n",

On another aviation platform, Giovanni Bisignani, Director General and CEO of the International Air Transport Association (IATA) stressed at its Annual General Meeting held in Vancouver from 3 to 5 June 2007 that the industry has changed tremendously in 5 years since 9/11. Six years after the tragic events of 2001, air travel is much more secure but there are unlimited ways to attack the aircraft integrity. He added that there is no perfect security system and terrorists change tactics and weapons. Bisignani rightly pointed out that terrorists are studying what measures the industry is adopting; and that all the air industry can do is make the system strong enough to constitute sufficient deterrent and make aircraft a harder target to hit.",

This calls for a delicate balance between recognizing the compelling need for scientists to exchange and collectively use different strains in order to identify naturally occurring diseases and mutations on the one hand and ensuring that the transport of these infectious substances8 are carried out according to United Nations Model Regulations8 on the other. These model regulations are the base upon which specific provisions for the carriage by air are formulated in the packing of samples of infectious pathogens for transportation by air. The shipment of infectious agents or diagnostic specimens by air must comply with local, national and international regulations. International air transport regulations are contained in various documentation of the International Civil Aviation Organization and Dangerous Goods Regulations\u2014an annual publication of the International Air Transport Association published in January, and usually revised on an yearly basis.

Until recently in the United States of America, most biological defense strategies have been geared to protecting soldiers on the battlefield rather than looking after ordinary people in cities. In 1999, the University of Pittsburgh\u2019s Center for Biomedical Informatics deployed the first automated bioterrorism detection system, called RODS (Real-Time Outbreak Disease Surveillance). RODS is designed to draw collect data from many data sources and use them to perform signal detection, that is, to detect a possible bioterrorism event at the earliest possible moment. RODS, and other similar systems, collect data from sources including clinical data, laboratory data, and data from over-the-counter drug sales. In 2000, Michael Wagner, the co director of the RODS laboratory, and Ron Aryel, a subcontractor, conceived of the idea of obtaining live data feeds from \u201cnon-traditional\u201d (non-health-care) data sources.

Researchers are also considering the utility of data generated by ranching and feedlot operations, food processors, drinking water systems, school attendance recording, and physiologic monitors, among others.

One legal option would be to include a Standard in Annex 17 on Aviation Security. pertaining to the spread of communicable diseases through acts of unlawful interference with civil aviation. Such a provision could require that States take all necessary measures both already established at international law and adopted as national measures within States to ensure that there is no room for the possibility of unlawful carriage of infectious pathogens within and out of their territories. A cross reference and Standard could also be made covering the safety aspects of the threat of bioterrorism. The terrorist attacks in the USA on 11 September 2001 and, more specifically, the subsequent \u201canthrax\u201d scare, brought to the world\u2019s attention the threat of deliberate attacks through the use of biological, chemical or nuclear agents. In the event of a bio-terrorist attack the public health response is critical in identifying the nature of the attack and the appropriate response.

Therefore it is extremely important for States to strictly enforce their dangerous goods legislation. It is also important to treat this subject holistically in terms of the world at large and not restrictively by singling out only those involved in the flight concerned. Finally, States have to adopt a security culture that admits of an overall approach to the threat as a potential harm to the health of humanity. This should inevitably include strict adherence by States to the provisions of Annexes 17 and 18 and inclusion of new Standards in the Annexes as necessary, together with an abiding understanding that the illegal carriage of infectious pathogens by air portends a threat both to safety and security of aviation.",
