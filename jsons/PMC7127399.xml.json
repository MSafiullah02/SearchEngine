Dosi [2] investigated technology trajectory on the basis of paradigm shift and found continuous innovation can be regarded as proceedings of technology paradigm, while discontinuous innovation might be the initiation of a new paradigm. The differentiation between continuous innovation and discontinuous innovation may be positive for understanding initiation of a new paradigm as well as position and diffusion of a specific technology or knowledge. A lot of methodologies have been proposed and applied into various knowledge fields for understanding or mapping their technology development paradigms. However, what usually used for this purpose is bibliometric analysis on patents or scientific papers by way of text mining and statistics, keyword-based approach or citation-based approach.",

Keyword-based analysis as a type of co-word analysis [20], [21]started to play an important role in understanding the dynamics of knowledge development [22]. Ding et al. mapped information retrieval research by using co-word analysis on papers collected from Science Citation Index (SCI) and Social Science Citation Index (SSCI) for the period 1987\u20131997 [23]. Baldwin et al. mapped ethics and dementia research by using keywords [24]. Tian et al. used Institute for Scientific Information (ISI) database to measure scientific output of the field of Geographic Information System (GIS) by using keywords [25]. Similar approaches have been made to map knowledge evolution in other fields, such as software engineering [26], chemistry [27], scientometrics [28], neural network research [29], [30], biological safety [31], optomechatronics [32], bioeletronics [33], adverse drug reactions [34], [35], biotechnology [36], [37], environmental science [38], condensed matter physics [39], etc., and even this keyword-based analysis has been applied to investigation of a phenomenon or a more specific topic such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and tsunami [40], [41], and Parkinson's disease [42].",

Former publications can be served as important references or bases for later publication, in this way human knowledge can be gradually accumulated to sustain and expand knowledge system. The important featuring characteristic of patent and scientific publication for knowledge accumulation is their citations showing which former literatures have been contributed to this paper/patent and providing the context of knowledge accumulation. A number of researches have noted that patent citations trace out technological building relationships among inventions [46], [47]. Also, citation has been widely used in bibliometric study to evaluate technology development, research performance, and even map knowledge evolution or technological trajectory. For instance, Acosta investigated the links between science and technology based on an analysis of scientific citations in patent documents to study in greater depth the relationship between science and technological development in the various regions of Spain [48], Hall et al. suggested that of all patent related indicators, patent citation is a more adequate indicator to evaluate market value [49], Stuart and Podolny used patent citations to measure firms' technological niches and niche shifts [50].",

Accordingly, this study aims to use the alternative citation-based method to avoid the problem of lacking causal knowledge accumulation if only keywords are considered in the analysis, and reap reward from the well-assigned citations in structured patent documents for drawing an overview of how electrical conducting polymer nanocomposite technology is evolved. In summary, patent citation information allows the building of patent linkages which eventually lead to a patent citation network as a whole. The constructed patent citation network, with patents as network nodes (actors) and patent citation as network ties, allows quantitative analysis on patent citation network by calculating network properties, e.g. Degree Centrality, Betweenness Centrality, and Closeness Centrality. In this sense, mechanism of knowledge flow or technology evolution mechanism, e.g. technology convergence, technology diffusion, etc., can be quantitatively analyzed.",

However, this study only demonstrates the construction of patent citation map by the use of overall patents without considering time horizon. A dynamic map is also possible if we plot the 2-dimensional patent citation map for every year so the development over time can be observed.",

Systematic methodologies involving citation analysis have been investigated in the field of technology forecast [57], [58], [59], but this study focuses more on systematic patent analysis and 2-dimensional visualization on the basis of conventional methods, and then demonstrates a systematic and quantitative way for analyzing and evaluating patented techniques by integrating basic patent statistics, technology\u2013function classification, standard industrial classification, patent citation, network properties calculation and two-dimensional mapping. All of these contribute to a systematic approach for obtaining an overview of large amount of selected patents, more importantly this paper provides a quantitative way of evaluating patent and thus a computerized calculation is possible for potential quantitative applications e.g. R&D resource allocation, research performance evaluation, patent valuation, 2-dimensinol patent map visualization etc.",
