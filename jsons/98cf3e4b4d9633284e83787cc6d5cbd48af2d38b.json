A critical epidemiological measure that modulates the early stage of a viral outbreak is the access to adequate equipment, that is crucial for HCWs' protection [2] . However, the present pandemic is distinguished by a huge shortage of personal protective equipment [3] , especially in Italy where HCWs seem to experience high rates of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. The Italian Government strengthened prevention and restraint strategies, including self-quarantine, and restricted resident movements first in Lombardy and subsequently across the entire country [4] . Besides, while in the early phase of the pandemic routine screening for SARS-CoV-2 infection has been easily provided for politicians and football players, even in absence of overt symptoms, by the end of March no specific serial testing strategy had been implemented for early recognition of potentially infected HCWs [5] . It was expected that initial reports from China during the early epidemic phase might have worldwide increased the awareness among healthcare providers of the high infectious risks in a hospital environment. Unfortunately, in the region of Lombardy, the epicentre of the Italian outbreak, at least 42 physicians died for Covid-19 as April 1, 2020 [6] and international media and Italian politicians are now raising the question: are we doing enough to protect HCWs during this pandemic?",

We evaluated the rate of infected HCWs on the overall population and on active-workers, excluding retired patients. Sixty-five patients were HCWs, representing the 16.3% of our total population. All cases were Lombardy-related HCWs exposures. According to the latest report of \"Italian Statistical Institute\", the overall proportion of HCWs is estimated to be 1.87% of the adult population, therefore the proportion of HCWs in our series is about 9 times more than expected. Our sample included 120 retired patients; if we consider only active-workers, 65 out of 280 cases were HCWs (23.2%). As HCWs behaviors and control measures were continually in flux, we estimated the proportion of HCWs infected over time until the end of March, 40 days after the first registered Italian patient. Figure 1 shows that the transmission rate in HCWs has persistently increased affecting up to 29% of admitted active-workers in the upper quartile of the HCWs volume distribution.",
