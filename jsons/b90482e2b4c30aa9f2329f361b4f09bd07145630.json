The lack of pre-existing data from this new disease, meant the feasibility of building such new AI models to determine diagnosis or prognosis remains an open challenge, yet one that is of particular interest to an AI community focused on breaking the existing barriers between data domains using machine learning. Generalising AI models to unseen data (inference), to data coming from different distributions (domain adaptation, transfer learning) and to data with limited or no labels (semi-or unsupervised learning), e.g. [3] , are all priority areas in the technical development of AI and such non-fully-supervised methods may benefit all the scenarios discussed. These early stages of a new disease have been described as overlooked periods in the general management of infectious diseases [ 4 ] . The AI community should design strategies and methodologies for rapid deployment in the event of future epidemic threats, to enable data collection, model training, testing and wide deployment to be as efficient as possible.",

However RT-PCR has limited negative predictive value with variable availability and diagnostic speed. Alternative methodologies for diagnosing COVID-19 include medical imaging techniques such as computed tomography (CT) and chest radiographs (CXR) [5] . Some groups have also explored point-of-care ultrasound albeit with limitations. Driven by data availability, the focus of AI work in COVID-19 has centered on RT-PCR-labelled diagnostic models, e.g. [6] , or the automated evaluation of clinical/imaging features, e.g. lung involvement on CT imaging [7] . Those developing AI-assisted diagnostic tools must recognise that very high diagnostic accuracies are required to demonstrate added value above and beyond existing clinical imaging and RT-PCR tests.",

            "text": "It is also important to question which prognostic outcomes require greatest prioritisation during this period. The majority of existing AI models aim to predict hospitalisation and mortality, e.g. [8] , using predictors such as age, gender, blood biomarkers, pre-existing co-morbidities and imaging [5] . In resource constrained clinical environments, there is great value in predicting resource consumption as a \"surrogate\" prognostic outcome, as a lack of personal protective equipment (PPE) for example can directly affect community prognoses [9] . Intuitive candidate outcome measures for AI models might include time spent on mechanical ventilators and/or within intensive care units. Yet as knowledge of COVID-19 has grown, early intubation of a patient has diminished in priority in the care pathway. Similarly, with limitations in resources pragmatic choices have had to be made regarding patient selection for intensive care unit admission. Evolving management strategies such as these have a real-time impact on the outcomes that AI models aim to predict. Disease progression (or regression following treatment) models can be trained using time series data, such as longitudinal CT images [10] , to quantify the likelihood of development of severe pneumonia and acute myocardial injury, two leading causes of mortality [ 11 ] , and the cytokine release syndrome. A lesson from the COVID-19 pandemic has been that AI models motivated merely by the practical convenience of utilising acquiring labelled data have had limited clinical value.",

For example, the accuracy of chest x-ray detection represented by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, was significantly reduced from 0.93 in a multi-centre internal validation, to 0.82, on external validation data [17] . The pre-deployment external validation reduces the risk of this overfitting problem based on the assumption that the external data represent new local data. However, the local data are likely to have unique characteristics due to centre-specific acquisition features, equipment and protocols, all of which may have differing clinical constraints and requirements -the local healthcare environment [ 20 ] . Moreover, temporal differences in data may increase, adversely affecting model accuracy, as the demographic and immunity landscape and clinical practice shift between different stages of the epidemic [21] . AI models therefore should have a continuous monitoring and adaptation strategy to these changing data to maintain their predictive accuracy.",
