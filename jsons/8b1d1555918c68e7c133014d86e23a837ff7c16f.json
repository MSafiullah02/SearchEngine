The improvement of this capacity is essential to provide critical services to maintain local populations healthy and safe, not only for protecting against cross-border outbreaks 7 Core capacity requirements at all times for designated airports, ports and ground crossings, and effective public health response at points of entry, both indicators related to points of entry capacity, scored 60% in Brazil (world = 55% and 48%, respectively) 3 , indicating low effectiveness on prevention and control measures at the subnational level 6 . All points of entry must be provided with the necessary capacities to deal with travelers, animals, and cargo transported since they could play a role as reservoirs or vectors for different pathogens 8 . Many viruses circulating currently in Brazil, such as SARS-CoV-2, Zika, and Chikungunya, were imported from other countries in recent years 9 .
