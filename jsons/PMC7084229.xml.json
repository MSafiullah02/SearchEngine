SARS-CoV-2 is not only phylogenetically closely related with SARS-CoV, an etiological agent of SARS, but also uses a same receptor, ACE2, as SARS-CoV does. Thus, even though \u201cWuhan pneumonia\u201d has been called with various other disease names such as \u201cnew coronavirus pneumonia (NCP)\u201d and now as \u201ccoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)\u201d, we feel that it may be more appropriate to refer to \u201cWuhan pneumonia\u201d as \u201cSARS-2\u201d and the previous SARS as \u201cSARS-1\u201d if necessary. The etiological agent for \u201cWuhan pneumonia\u201d has been changed from \u201c2019-nCoV\u201d to \u201cSARS-CoV-2\u201d. A further change of \u201cCOVID-19\u201d into \u201cSARS-2\u201d is logical and reasonable for streamlining taxonomy between disease agent and disease. In this mini-review, we evaluate natural and social factors influencing both 2002 and 2019 SARSs in order to understand some common epidemiological features that may be beneficial for controlling the ongoing epidemic and also for preventing future outbreak. This comprehensive knowledge is also helpful for searching the origin(s) of the viruses and for elucidating their initial occurrence(s).",

In China, November and December are winter months, and are the coldest months of the year in these two locations [8,9]. Cold temperature usually provides a conducive environmental condition for virus survival. In addition to this, we also noticed that severe drought occurred in both locations at the times of the outbreaks. The annual rainfall in Foshan in December 2002 nearly reached 0 mm [10]. In fact, drought occurred in the whole of Guangdong Province that year, causing more than 1300 reservoirs drying up and 286,000 hectares of farmland suffering drought [11]. Coincidentally, Wuhan also suffered its worst drought in nearly 40 years, with precipitation of only 5.5 mm in December 2019 [12,13]. These drought conditions were rare for both locations as their average annual precipitations are greater than 1100 mm [8,9], which are higher than the global average annual rainfall of 990 mm, of which 715 mm is over land [14]. Cold, dry conditions are more conducive than cold conditions alone for virus survival [15,16]. During the cold winter, air-dried virus particles are a dangerous form of virus, which survives for a long period of time in airflows [17].",

Cold temperatures cause reduced blood supply and thus the decreased provision of immune cells to the nasal mucosa. Low humidity can reduce the capacity of cilia cells in the airway to remove virus particles and secrete mucus as well as repair airway cells. In addition, human cells release signal proteins after viral infection to alert neighboring cells to consider the danger of virus invasion. However, in low-humidity environments, this innate immune defense system is impaired [18]. More seriously, low humidity can cause nasal mucus to become dry; nasal cavity lining to become fragile, or even ruptured; and make the entire upper respiratory tract vulnerable to virus invasion [19].",

SL-CoV possesses the ability to infiltrate cells using its S protein to combine with ACE2 receptors [24]. This observation indicated that SARS-CoV originated from Chinese horseshoe bats and that SL-CoV isolated from bats poses a potential threat to humans without the involvement of any intermediate hosts. Between 2015 and 2017, 334 bats were collected from Zhoushan city, Zhejiang Province, China. A total of 26.65% of those bats were detected as having a conserved coronaviral protein RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). Full genomic analyses of two SL-CoVs (bat-SL-CoV ZC45 and bat-SL-CoV ZXC21) showed 81% nucleotide identity with human/civet SARS CoVs.

A study on the genome sequence of diseased pangolins smuggled from Malaysia to China found that pangolins carry coronavirus, suggesting that pangolins may be intermediate hosts for SARS-COV-2 [35]. Pangolins seized in anti-smuggling operations in Guangxi and Guangdong of southern China were detected with multiple CoV linages with 85.5\u201392.4% genome sequence similarity to those of SARS-CoV-2 [36]. More interestingly, CoVs collected from caged pangolin obtained from an unspecified research organization showed over 99% genome sequence identity to those of SARS-COV-2 [37]. Meanwhile, Nanshan Zhong, the leader of the SARS-COV-2 virus treatment expert group, predicted the intermediate host of SARS-COV-2 to be bamboo rat [38] on the basis of the animal distribution in Zhoushan, which is not only the natural habitat of bat-sl-CoVzc45-carrying bats, but also the natural habitat of cobra, bamboo rat, and pangolin [39,40,41].",

Due to the promotion of bamboo rat breeding by Huanong Brothers in 2018, the amount of bamboo rat breeding and market demand increased significantly [51]. Since the market demand increases, the new bamboo rat breeding base may not be far from the local habitat of SARS-COV-2-carrying bats. The model of SARS-COV-2 transmission, similar to Nipah virus, is that farms are built around bat habitats, causing bats to pass the virus to animals through saliva, urine, and feces [30]. At the same time, because Zhejiang is a natural habitat for bamboo rats, it is possible that some farms directly introduced wild bamboo rats, which were already infected with SARS-COV-2 virus. For the above reasons, the bamboo rats carrying SARS-COV-2 virus were transported from the infected place to the incident site in the same way that civets spread SARS-CoV [32].",

Amazingly, most of the SARS-2 patients can be traced to a single unique etiological agent, SARS-CoV-2.

The government should issue laws and policies to tighten protection of wildlife and prohibit consumption of wild animals.
