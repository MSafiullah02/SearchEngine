Before 2002, members of the CAL serogroup, LACV in particular, constituted the leading cause of arboviral encephalitis in the United States (Romero and Newland, 2006). The most pathogenic member, and the most common cause of reported illness in this group, remains LACV. Children are particularly susceptible to La Crosse encephalitis (Balkhy and Schreiber, 2000, Romero and Newland, 2006). The majority of LACV infections are subclinical or lead to mild symptoms. More serious cases result in encephalitis with symptoms of severe bifrontal headache, fever, vomiting, and lethargy progressing to seizures and coma (Balkhy and Schreiber, 2000, McJunkin et al., 1997, McJunkin et al., 2001). Symptoms of fever, focal seizures, and lateralizing epileptiform discharges can cause a misdiagnosis of herpes simplex encephalitis (McJunkin et al., 2001). TAHV and INKV viruses, in general, result in fever and in severe cases, CNS involvement can also occur (Demikhov et al., 1991). JCV affects mainly adults and causes a febrile illness and mild CNS disease (Srihongse et al., 1984).",

Preliminary evidence suggests that CVV can cause congenital defects in humans, but this assertion needs to be further investigated (Calisher and Sever, 1995). CVV is the causal agent of congenital malformations and fetal death in sheep (Chung et al., 1990, Edwards, 1994) and has also been found to infect cattle, horses, and white-tailed deer (Blackmore and Grimstad, 1998, McLean et al., 1987). The transmission cycle of CVV includes small mammals, such as rabbits and mosquitoes. The virus has been isolated from multiple species of anopheline or culicine mosquitoes, including Anopheles quadrimaculatus and Culiseta inornata (Calisher et al., 1986a).",

The resultant 60-bp sequence of the N ORF was cloned into the PCR-Blunt II-TOPO plasmid (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). The plasmid (pNT27) was linearized and used to transcribe a control RNA transcript containing the real-time RT-PCR target sequence. Transcription was performed using the T7 RiboMax Large Scale RNA Production System (Promega, Madison, WI). The transcript RNAs were subjected to 2 rounds of DNase I digestion and were purified by phenol\u2013chloroform extraction and sepharose chromatography. The purified transcript was quantified using the RNA 6000 Pico kit (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) on the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer. Ten-fold serial dilutions of genomic LACV RNA and the transcript were made, and real-time RT-PCR was performed. A standard curve was constructed, allowing quantitation of the genomic viral RNA. Conventional RT-PCR was performed using primers CV-Mex-F and CV-Mex-R (Table 1) targeting CVV (strain 62-7364). With the method described above, a plasmid (pNT28) was constructed, which contained the 301-bp G1 glycoprotein-encoding sequence that spanned the real-time PCR target region for the CVV real-time RT-PCR assay. The CVV transcript was made and quantified, and, with the use of this transcript, genomic RNA was quantified as described above.",

Forty negative samples were either not spiked or else spiked with 1 of 3 concentrations of LACV and CVV in various combinations (Table 4\n). In addition to these samples, 1 negative extraction control was included in each extraction run. All 40 blinded samples and negative controls were also spiked with a known amount of GFP RNA transcript (2200 gc/\u03bcL), which acts as the internal control. RNA was extracted from the specimens using the NucliSens easyMAG system. GFP was then detected in the sample via real-time RT-PCR to determine extraction efficiency and the presence of inhibitors (Table 4).",

Plaque reduction neutralization tests (PRNTs), hemagglutination inhibition (HI) tests, and immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibody-capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent (MAC-ELISA) assays have been used in the diagnosis of bunyaviruses (Calisher et al., 1986b, Grimstad et al., 1986, McJunkin et al., 1998). The disadvantages of these tests are that PRNT is time consuming and cumbersome, HI is not sensitive, and MAC-ELISA may not be sufficiently specific to determine the infecting serotype (Calisher et al., 1986b, Calisher, 1994). In addition, IgM antibodies appear to persist. For example, serum IgM antibodies to LACV remain elevated >9 months after infection; therefore, detection of IgM in a single serum sample from an individual who lives in an endemic area is not indicative of recent infection (Calisher et al., 1986b, Tsai, 1991). Virus isolation from CSF and brain tissue is difficult and time consuming and is, therefore, not routinely performed on specimens from patients diagnosed with viral encephalitis (Calisher, 1994, Romero and Newland, 2006).",

We found the optimal PCR kit for this assay to be the qScript One-Step qRT-PCR kit (Quanta Biosciences). The linear assay range is 75 to 1.5 \u00d7 106 gc/reaction for CAL serogroup (specifically LACV) and 30 to 2.7 \u00d7 107 gc/reaction for CVV. The sensitivity of the assay is 75 gc/reaction for LACV and 30 gc/reaction for CVV. The assay is specific in that the primers and probes did not cross-react with any of the organisms in the specificity panel that we used. The assay detected 11 different viruses representative of the 3 complexes of CAL serogroup viruses and also the 12 different isolates of CVV that we tested (Table 2, Table 3).",
