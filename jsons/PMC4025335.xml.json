This finding corroborates with the result noticed by Abraham et al.[19] (16.7%), Rai et al.[17] (15.68%), and Al-Robaiee and Al-Farwachi[20] (15.5%). Alfieri et al.[2] stated that the rate of diarrheic fecal samples infected in beef and dairy calves were 33% and 20.2%, respectively. While Zrelli et al.[21] recorded an average rate of 22.8%, Langoni et al.[22] showed an average rate of 25.1% and AKam et al.[4] cited a percentage of 21.84%. Interestingly, others reported an important rate of GARV infection such as Reynolds et al.[13] (42%), Snodgrass et al.[14] (50%), De La Fuente et al.[16] (42.7%), Izzo et al.[12] (79.9%) and Nourmohammadzadeh et al.[23] (34%). Nevertheless, Perez et al.[15] observed a prevalence of 7%. The differences in detection of enteropathogens may be attributed to the different diagnostic methods used[24], farm management practices exercised in different regions, hygienic status[8],[24], environmental condition, and geographical locations (climate condition).",

While the frequency of infection by rotavirus is higher in age-group 8-14 d olds (30.77%), this age bracket is reported as the most susceptible to infection by rotavirus[2],[25]. The 2- and 4-week-old calves were the most susceptible to GARV and BCoV infections, which may be due to decreasing of passive immunity and the absence of the natural resistance against infection for both enteropathogens. The presence of BCoV infection in older calves (22-30 d) could be explained by the method of livestock farming of calves (using the grouping of the calves instead of individual stall). The 3-weeks-old calves are characterized by absence of GARV, this may be highlighted by an increased natural resistance against infection for this enteropathogen and small number of sample cooperated with 1 and 4 age-group, in spite of the absence of significant difference among the various age-groups.",

Furthermore, the multifactorial etiology (bacterial, viral and protozoa agents) influenced by nutritional and environmental factors, as well as difficulties in the clinical diagnosis of neonatal diarrhea and failure of the treatment in young calves affected by diarrhea require to adopt the prophylactic measures such as hygiene, management and vaccination of dam cows by an immunization through the injection of either modified-live or inactivated vaccines.
