When the use of SPF animals in research became widely accepted in the 1980s, the term \u201cconventional\u201d was used to distinguish SPF animals from those produced and housed in the conventional manner of the time, that is, breeding colonies that were not established from disease\u2010free stock and in which no disease control measures or routine health monitoring were implemented. Such animals harbored microorganisms and parasites that interfered with the research in which the animals were used.9, 10, 11, 12 Recognition of such problems was the impetus for development and use of SPF animals, which are free of selected, specific pathogenic and opportunistic microorganisms and parasites considered causes, or potential causes, of adverse effects, whether via morbidity, alteration of biological responses, or otherwise. It is quite inaccurate to equate \u201cSPF conditions\u201d with a \u201cdefined microbial environment.\u201d Only those agents for which testing is conducted are defined, by their presence or absence according to the testing protocol and results, and such information defines only a few of the large number making up the microbiota.",

Reports of mouse IBD model studies often identify parts of the mouse colon as ascending, transverse, and descending, as do some textbooks on mouse biology. This would be of mere academic interest if there were a clear anatomic correspondence between the large intestines of mice and humans, but that is not the case. In mice, the cecum is comparatively much larger, and is located on the left, with the base caudal.65 The colon extends rostrally and to the right from the base of the cecum to the region of the pylorus, where it reverses direction by passing around the root of the mesentery to the left and extends caudally to the rectum. Thus, the transverse segment, if it can be said to exist at all, is limited to the very short apex of the reversing curve, and the relative proportions of the \u201cascending\u201d (rostrad) and \u201cdescending\u201d (caudad) segments in mice are considerably different from those of the ascending and descending colon in humans.

            "text": "Published scoring methods vary greatly in criteria and complexity. We consider the most important consideration to be the accuracy with which the method reflects the disease manifestations of interest. A difficulty we have encountered with scoring protocols is that, unless carefully designed, their ability to generate reliable overall severity assessments can be dependent on whether the experimental comparison involves a fundamental change in the character of the response. In the case of genetic and T\u2010cell transfer mouse IBD models, mucosal inflammatory cell accumulation and crypt hyperplasia are generally considered to be primary features of cecocolitis, such that increasingly heavy inflammatory cell accumulation and increasingly pronounced hyperplasia are logically taken to be major indicators of increasing overall severity. However, as the severity of epithelial injury increases, epithelial degeneration and loss begin to reduce the apparent contribution of proliferation, and, if severe enough, lead to progressive crypt loss and eventually complete epithelial loss and lamina propria \u201ccollapse\u201d (Fig. 2). If an experimental manipulation alters expression of cecocolitis such that it becomes primarily necrotizing rather than proliferative, a scoring protocol that sums scores for, say, goblet cell loss, epithelial hyperplasia, crypt exudate (\u201cabscesses\u201d), crypt loss, and lamina propria inflammatory cell accumulation will yield representative total scores only insofar as all of the structures in question are present. If the epithelium is lost, goblet cell loss, crypt hyperplasia, and crypt exudate cannot be assessed and cannot contribute to the total score, an effect that will be only partially offset by increasing crypt loss scores. Thus, a total score so derived may not adequately reflect the difference between a hyperplastic mucosa and a more severely affected one with extensive epithelial loss. Such potential problems can be accommodated by weighting component scores or other means. We also consider it advisable to include specific assessment of lesion distribution, as intestinal lesions in mouse IBD models can be discontinuous, especially in early or less severe disease, and can differ between cecum and colon and among segments of colon. In addition, we have seen instances in which a genetic or experimental manipulation significantly affected disease expression in some segments but not others. A final consideration is the progression of colitis with time. We have encountered cases in which an experimental manipulation did not significantly alter the severity of colitis present at the end of an experiment, but did significantly affect colitis development, that is, severity at earlier timepoints. Such differences could point to subtle but potentially important biological effects; therefore, we suggest that a time course study of disease progression may be appropriate whenever a new combination of mouse model and experimental manipulation is investigated, particularly if an initial comparison at a typical duration of several weeks is negative.",

            "text": "In any case, the objective should be a distribution of scores that reflects a pathologist's assessment, that is, lesions judged to be mild, moderate, or severe should be represented by progressively higher scores separated by appropriate intervals. Meeting this objective requires accurate interpretation of each of the lesion characteristics to be evaluated. For example, transmural inflammation, an inflammatory process that directly invades and penetrates the tunica muscularis, damages smooth muscle, and extends to the serosa, is characteristic of severe or aggressive disease and is reasonable to include as an important component. However, mucosal inflammation in mouse colon and cecum commonly is accompanied by phlebitis, lymphangitis, and perivascular inflammatory cell accumulation affecting vessels traversing the tunica muscularis, which can be associated with serositis, especially at mesenteric attachments. Although this could be interpreted as transmural inflammation in a sense, it is a different process of quite different significance. Similarly, extensive epithelial loss resulting in lamina propria collapse is different from ulceration, in which loss of mucosal tissue extends into the submucosa, although the lesions can have a similar appearance at low magnification if the ulceration does not extend into the muscularis. Another example is mouse IBD model studies in which development of cancer is of interest. Here it is important to be aware that it is characteristic of mouse colonic mucosa that epithelial hyperplasia is accompanied by a tendency for proliferating crypt epithelium to penetrate the muscularis mucosa where inflammation is severe or prolonged, such as that often associated with Helicobacter spp.66 (Fig. 3). The proliferating and invading epithelium can appear quite dysplastic, making such lesions difficult to distinguish from early invasive carcinoma.66, 67 For studies in which cancer development is of interest, reference to published criteria for distinguishing such lesions from carcinoma67 may be helpful. In addition to the problem that the method of histopathologic assessment may not be clearly presented, it may not be possible for the reader to independently assess the reported disease manifestations because they are not adequately illustrated. In our view, by far the most common cause of this is the practice of \u201cpostage stamp pathology\u201d68\u2014publication of photomicrographs so small and of such low resolution they cannot be interpreted.",

Of particular importance, presence or absence of organisms such as Helicobacter spp. that are known or likely to affect disease expression should be documented to provide some basis for assessing reproducibility among studies with a given model, particularly in cases in which specific features, such as cancer induction, are of interest. Basic characterization of Helicobacter spp. colonization status is readily accomplished by commercial polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing for H. hepaticus, H. bilis, and generic Helicobacter spp. Specific methods for other species have been described27, 28, 70, 71, 72, 73 and are well within the capabilities of most biomedical research institutions.",

However, in our experience, design and use of such systems are not simple tasks\u2014we have made significant changes over the years to improve flexibility and accommodate different models\u2014and require formal anatomic pathology skills and experience in \u201canalytical pathology\u201d of mouse IBD models.
