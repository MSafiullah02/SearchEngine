The impact of the containment measures on the global economy is projected to dwarf the macroeconomic impact of the 2008-09 financial crisis in both magnitude and scope (OECD Economics Department, 2020). Unprecedented proportions of the employment sectors in the USA and Canada have filed for unemployment benefits. Statistics Canada reported, on April 9, 2020, that one-in-ten working-age individuals (i.e., fifteen years of age and over) in Canada lost their jobs or worked less than half their usual hours as a result of the widespread restrictions imposed in March 2020 (Government of Canada, Statistics Canada, 2020).",

During the Great Recession, an increase in the number of suicides was also reported in Canada (Reeves et al., 2014).

Second, we estimated the number of suicide deaths in 2019 using the time-trend model and the published unemployment rate of 5.7% for 2019. Third, we predicted the number of suicide deaths in 2020 and 2021 for the three following scenarios: 1) Minimal change in unemployment (i.e., average annual unemployment rate of 5.9% in 2020, 6.0% in 2021; derived from the 2019 Federal Budget); 2) Moderate increase in projected unemployment rate (i.e., average annual unemployment rate of 8.3% in 2020, 8.1% in 2021), as forecasted by the International Monetary Fund based on the assumption that the pandemic will fade in the second half of 2020 that there will not be a second outbreak in 2021; and 3) Extreme increase in projected unemployment rate (i.e., average annual unemployment rate of 16.6% in 2020, 14.9% in 2021), approximating the peak unemployment rate of 19% during the Great Depression (Government of Canada, Department of Finance, 2019; \u201cWorld Economic Outlook, April 2020 \u2013 Chapter 1: The Great Lockdown,\u201d 2020).",

We recognize that no single variable accounts for completed suicide within individuals or populations. We additionally recognize that no single macroeconomic indicator is sufficiently predictive of suicide. Notwithstanding, it was observed during the Great Recession in the USA, Canada, and various economies of Europe, as well as Asia, that the change in unemployment rate was highly associated with increase in suicide rates (Chang et al., 2009; Reeves et al., 2014, 2012; Stuckler et al., 2009).

For example, wage subsidies, forbearance on financial obligation, government support of small business, work retraining programs, and access to community-based support programs can all serve as primary prevention. We also believe that the creation of virtual, as well as conventional, services that provide timely access to high quality mental health assessment and, where appropriate, specific treatment for persons at risk of mental illness are urgently needed. Finally, we assert that specialized services with an emphasis on psychiatric first aid available in communities and co-localized with other medical services will be especially relevant as a mechanism to reduce suicide at this time.",
