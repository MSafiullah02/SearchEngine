A better understanding of the N gene evolutionary trajectory can assist the development of control measures [3, 4]. Evolutionary analysis based on the lyssavirus surface glycoprotein (ectodomain) revealed that point mutations are the most frequent mutation in lyssavirus evolution; additionally, all lyssavirus lineages have similar evolutionary rates [5]. Phylogenetic analyses of N, P, and G gene sequences among bat lyssaviruses from central Asia have demonstrated that quantitative overlap between the currently established genotypes likely occurs at the amino acid level [6, 7]. Phylogenetic analysis based on the full RABV genome, or based on N, P, M, G, and L genes, resulted in phylogenetic trees with similar topologies, indicating that individual lyssavirus genes are likely sufficient to establish phylogenetic relationships [8]. This suggests that rigorous phylogenetic techniques based on full-length genome sequences provide considerable discriminatory power for genotype classification within the lyssaviruses [9]. The current global understanding of RABV phylogeography is that there are six clades of RABV in non-flying mammals, each with a distinct geographical distribution, likely reflecting major physical barriers to gene flow.",

Investigation of the molecular epidemiology of rabies in southern China has demonstrated that long-distance migration, or trans-provincial movement of dogs (by humans) from high-incidence regions may be one of the causes of the recent human rabies epidemics in southern China [12]. Evolutionary dynamic analysis based on the G gene shows that the RABV currently circulating in China consists of three main groups [13], and that the RABV in China and Southeast Asia share a common ancestor [14]. Phylogenetic analysis based on the 3\u2032 terminus of the N gene shows that RABV isolates from Guangxi province, south China can be divided into four groups [15]. Further studies have demonstrated that isolates from groups I, II, and III are lethal once introduced in mice, whereas isolates of group IV are not fatal to either adult or suckling mice [15].",

The 1st outbreak of rabies was from 1968 to 1976, with the peak of human rabies cases at 560 in 1972. The 2nd time occurred in 1978, reaching a peak of 879 human rabies cases in 1981, and then gradually decreasing to just 24 cases in 1995.

Our research group began surveillance of the RABV-carriage rate of at least 500 clinically healthy dogs from rural areas of Guangxi from 1999, and isolated RABV from RABV-positive cases. Of these isolates, several from rabid and normal dogs taken at different times showed similar pathogenicity in mice, indicating that the RABV from Guangxi has stable virulence [22]. Nevertheless, following an increase in dog vaccination in rural areas, the RABV-carriage rate in dogs appears to be gradually decreasing (data not shown). Between 2013 and 2016, we did not obtain any positive samples even though at least 500 samples from different areas in Guangxi were tested each year. Therefore, the data shown in this study consists of RABV isolates collected up until 2012. After reviewing a molecular epidemiological study conducted in Guangxi [15], we decided to further examine the genetic properties of these RABV isolates.",
