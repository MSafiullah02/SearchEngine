It began earlier than usual (October) and continued into January 2004, with widespread disease occurring in 45 states. To deal with the volume of queries and issues that arose, the CDC activated its Emergency Operating Center and reassigned staff on a 24-hour, 7-day-per-week basis. The CDC prospectively monitored mortality rates in U.S. children for the first time during this outbreak, and 152 deaths among U.S. residents <18 years of age were attributed to influenza and its known complications (particularly secondary bacterial infections).10 Additionally, 50 children met the case definition for influenza-related encephalopathy (altered mental status lasting >1 day with onset of neurologic symptoms within 5 days of fever onset), with more than 40% having severe outcomes (death or neurologic sequelae).11\n",

An additional vaccine-related concern is that influenza A viruses of the H5 and H7 subtypes cannot be grown in eggs, the current standard method of vaccine production, because of the rapid lethality of these strains to chick embryos (Table I, problem 4A).33\n",
