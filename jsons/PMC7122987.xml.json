Canertinib alkylates a cysteine specific to ERBB receptors and is particularly effective at inducing its degradation. Thus, it irreversibly inhibits ERBB associated signal transduction functions and results in tumor cell apoptosis and suppression of tumor cell proliferation. The kinase inhibition is selective for ERBB1, ERBB2, ERBB3, and ERBB4 without inhibiting the tyrosine kinase activity of receptors such as Platelet-Derived Growth Factor Receptor, Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptor, and Insulin Receptor, even at high concentrations. Canertinib effectively inhibits the growth of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, which co-expresses ERBB1 and ERBB2, by mediating the inhibition of phosphorylation of both MAPK and AKT. It also acts as a radio-sensitizing agent and displays synergistic activity with other chemotherapeutic agents.",

The emergence of transformed cell clones with resistance to imatinib and other small molecule inhibitors, mediated by mutations in BCR-ABL, has become a major challenge in the treatment of chronic myelogenous leukemia. Mutational frequencies increase as chronic myelogenous leukemia progresses from the chronic phase to the blast phase. More than 70 point mutations can be assigned to four major groups based on their location in the kinase domain, the ATP binding loop (40 % of all mutations), the gatekeeper residue threonine 315 (25 % of all mutations), the catalytic domain (25 % of all mutations), or the activation loop (5 % of all mutations). BCR-ABL contains the ATP binding P-loop and the activation loop, which stabilize the basal conformation. Mutations in these loops destabilize the protein structure, such that the kinase domain cannot assume the inactive conformation required for imatinib binding. Mutations in the P-loop region are the most common (Fig. 4.9). The mutation T315I is completely resistant to multiple BCR-ABL directed therapies. This substitution eliminates a critical oxygen molecule needed for hydrogen bonding between imatinib and the ABL kinase. It also creates steric hindrance to the binding of most small molecule inhibitors. The development of an inhibitor for BCR-ABLT315I has been challenging, because most ATP competitive inhibitors directly interact with threonine 315 via hydrogen bonding and with the specificity imparting hydrophobic pocket, for which this residue serves as a gatekeeper. Several BCR-ABL mutations in the active site, such as Y235F/H or E255K/V, also confer imatinib mesylate resistance. Small molecule inhibitors of Aurora Kinase, including MK-0457 (VX-680), XL228, and AT9713, can effectively inhibit a mutant enzyme (Table 4.3).\n\nThe BCR-ABL protein re mains inhibited by imatinib, but alternative or downstream signaling pathways become activated, often involving excessive activity of SRC kinases.The drug disposition is altered through increased efflux via up-regulated export transporters such as ABCB1, compromised influx by down-regulation of the organic cation transporter OCT1, or enhanced protein binding of imatinib to circulating \u03b11-Acid Glycoprotein (AGP).\n",

Pancreatic exocrine insufficiency is common but usually moderate in patients with pancreatic cancer. Approximately 65 % of patients have some degree of fat malabsorption and 50 % have some degree of protein malabsorption. These may contribute to weight loss, epigastric discomfort, and malabsorption symptoms such as excessive flatus, bloating, diarrhea, and steatorrhea. Pancreatic enzyme replacement improves malabsorption, bloating, and diarrhea and helps prevent further weight loss. Pancreatic enzyme therapy may sometimes be associated with gastrointestinal adverse effects such as nausea, vomiting, cramps, constipation, or diarrhea that can be ameliorated by adjusting doses or brands. Empiric Pancreolipase replacement should be considered for most patients.The initial management usually entails (preferably oral) supportive nutrition, comprising caloric supplementation and hydration.Anorexia is well treated with appetite stimulants, such as progestational drugs and corticosteroids. These agents are potent anti-emetics, act rapidly, and increase the non-fluid body weight in advanced cancer patients with anorexia. The most used agents are megesterol acetate, medroxyprogesterone acetate, and dexamethasone. Dexamethasone can be administered at doses ranging 3\u20138 mg/day and megesterol acetate doses range 400\u2013800 mg/day. They are comparable in efficacy and produce an improvement in appetite with subsequent weight gain in approximately 15 % of patients. Dexamethasone has a short-lived duration of action (4 weeks) and a substantial adverse effect profile, including myopathy, mood changes, and hyperglycemia.A class of drugs in use is orexigenic (appetite stimulant) agents, such as the prokinetic medication metoclopramide and the cannabinoid dronabinol. Dronabinol at doses of 2.5\u20137.5 mg/day improves chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting in 65 % of cancer patients.An agent that may reverse cancer-associated cachexia is eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA, contained in fish oil pills) at doses of 1\u20136 g/day, which may result in weight stabilization after 3\u20134 weeks. Eicosapentaenoic acid works by suppressing the effect of the glycoprotein Proteolysis-Inducing Factor (PIF).Thalidomide at 100\u2013200 mg/day at bedtime, provides some weight stabilization but no weight gain. It may shorten the half-life of tnf-\u03b1 mRNA. Because of mixed results in clinical trials, thalidomide is not widely used.Ibuprofen has a role in abrogating the catabolic process and may lead to modest increases in weight. The combination of ibuprofen with megestrol acetate can reverse weight loss and improve the quality of life (el-Kamar 2003).\n",

It may be selected for by treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitors. The exon 20 mutation changes the structure of the tyrosine kinase inhibitor binding site, thus rendering the drugs ineffective. Amplification of c-met can be another mechanism to cause resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitors by activating a rescue growth and survival pathway.A tumor driver in non-smoker type lung cancer can be mutated K-RAS. Until targeted therapies are developed, only conventional chemotherapy can be offered to those patients.\n",

The HSP90 protein family consists of four members (HSP90\u03b1, HSP90\u03b2, GRP94, TRAP1). HSP90 comprises three conserved domains, the N-terminal lobe that contains an adenine nucleotide binding pocket (responsible for the ATPase activity), the highly charged middle region (modulates the ATPase activity), and the C-terminal lobe (contains an additional ATP binding pocket). HSP90 mediated protein folding requires energy that depends on the hydrolysis of ATP by the N-terminal ATP binding pocket. This nucleotide binding domain is unique compared to other ATP binding proteins because the nucleotide is bound in a bent conformation14 as opposed to the extended conformation utilized by most proteins. Activation of HSP90 results in its association with a series of co-chaperones, which form a complex that interacts with client proteins. The increased expression of chaperones enhances cell survival in tissues damaged by a variety of stressors. Such conditions are common within tumors, and there is increased expression of chaperone proteins in several types of solid tumors. Several HSP90 client proteins play important roles in the regulation of the cell cycle and cell survival.",

Geldanamycin preferentially induces the degradation of proteins that are mutated in tumor cells such as v-SRC, BCR-ABL, and P53 over their normal cellular counterparts.Tanespimycin (17-allylamino,17-demethoxygeldanamycin, 17-AAG) (NSC 330507) is a benzoquinone derived from geldanamycin. In 1999, it was the first HSP90 inhibitor to enter clinical trials. The drug has possible clinical activity in metastatic melanoma, prostate cancer, and multiple myeloma with manageable toxicity. In clinical trials, it has shown signs of effectiveness against ERBB2-positive breast cancers15. However, tanespimycin has unfavorable physiochemical properties, including poor water solubility, making its formulation for clinical delivery difficult.Alvespimycin hydrochloride (17-DMAG) (KOS-1022) is a tansepimycin derivative with improved water solubility that may be given intravenously or orally.Retaspimycin hydrochloride (IPI-504) is the hydroquinone hydrochloride salt of alvespimycin. It is administered intravenously.17-Aminogeldanamycin (17-AG) (IPI-493) is the major metabolite of tanespimycin (17-AAG) and retaspimycin (17-DMAG). It can be administered as an orally available HSP90 inhibitor.The rifamycins are a group of ansamycins, in which the aromatic moiety is a naphthalene ring. They are synthesized either naturally by the bacterium Amycolatopsis mediterranei or synthetically. Beside acting as HSP90 inhibitors, rifamycins may inhibit RNA tumor viruses via inhibition of their DNA Polymerase.Maytansinoid anti-tumor agents are members of the ansamycin group. They are 19-membered macrocyclic lactams that target the microtubules (see Sect. 10.1007/978-3-319-13278-5_3#Sec7.) and thus inhibit cell proliferation.\n",

It mainly affects the elderly, and has a highly variable course, with survival ranging from months to decades. Most patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia are identified through blood tests performed for unrelated reasons rather than because of symptoms of the disease. Approximately 1/3 of patients never require treatment. Standard management of most patients has therefore traditionally involved a period of observation to assess disease progression. For those patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia who are treated, therapy is generally palliative. Need-to-treat criteria include hematopoietic insufficiency, B-symptoms, rapidly progressive disease, or risk of complications from bulky lymphadenopathy. Regimens based on DNA alkylating agents, such as chlorambucil and cyclophosphamide, have been used for more than 30 years. In the 1980s, purine analogs (such as fludarabine) achieved more complete remissions than alkylator-based regimens. Since then, considerable efforts have focused on developing combination therapy protocols that are built on fludarabine. In a third phase of development, combination protocols have included targeted monoclonal antibodies. Throughout, the identification of agents with activity against resistant or treatment-refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia has remained a high priority (Keating 2008).",

The checkpoint kinases are transducers of the DNA damage signal and both phosphorylate a number of substrates involved in the DNA damage response. CHK1 and CHK2 share a number of overlapping substrates, although it is clear that they have distinct roles in directing the response of the cell to DNA damage. Checkpoint kinases are involved not only in cell cycle regulation but also in other aspects of the cellular response to DNA damage. The G1 checkpoint is modulated primarily by the ATM-CHK2-P53 pathway, as expression of ATR, CHK1, and CDC25A is limited until the cell passes this restriction point. At this point, levels of ATR, CHK1, and CDC25A all increase. If DNA damage is detected, CHK1/CHK2 are activated, CDC25A is phosphorylated, and thus destabilized, resulting in a P53 independent S arrest. In S phase, the same cascade can result in an intra-S arrest in response to stalled replication forks. The G2/M checkpoint prevents entry into mitosis with unrepaired DNA lesions. Initiation of this checkpoint is mediated by the ATM/ATR/CHK1/CHK2 cascades as shown, which ultimately suppresses the pro-mitotic activity of Cyclin B/CDC2. Along with their pivotal roles in the modulation of the cell cycle checkpoints, CHK1 and CHK2 are also involved in other aspects of the DNA damage response, including DNA repair, induction of apoptosis, and chromatin remodeling.

Humanized antibodies: In the simplest case, these are created by grafting the antigen-binding loops, known as complementarity-determining regions ( CDRs), from a mouse mAb into a human IgG. The generation of high-affinity humanized antibodies generally requires the transfer of one or more additional residues from the so-called framework regions ( FRs) of the mouse parent mAb. Several variants of the humanization technology have been developed. Human antibodies: These have high affinity for their respective antigens and are routinely obtained from very large, single-chain variable fragments ( scFvs) or Fab phage display libraries. Moreover, the difficulty in obtaining antibodies to self-antigens that are highly conserved between mouse and humans using hybridoma technology is readily overcome using phage display technology. High-affinity human antibodies have also been obtained from transgenic mice that contain some, or preferably many, human immunoglobulin genes and genetically disrupted endogenous immunoglobulin loci. Immunization elicits the production of human antibodies recoverable using standard hybridoma technology.

Chronic myelogenous leukemia ( CML) is associated in most cases with a translocation between chromosomes 9 and 22 that occurs at the sites of bcr and the protein tyrosine kinase gene abl, creating the chimeric BCR-ABL protein. This leads to deregulation of the kinase activity of ABL, driving the uncontrolled cell growth in the disease. Blood cells containing the BCR-ABL fusion proliferate in the absence of growth factors they would normally require. In the cytoplasm, BCR-ABL is associated with a large signaling complex. Various of its cellular substrates may be involved in transformation, including PI-3 Kinase/PKB, the kinase JAK2, and STAT transcription factors. Specifically, STAT5 may contribute to the failure of apoptosis in BCR-ABL cells. The activation of BCR-ABL also represses apoptosis through the induction of BAD. GRB-2 phosphorylation may play a regulatory role in tyrosine kinase signaling. Traditional cytotoxic anti-cancer drugs have serious adverse effects such as nausea, weight loss, hair loss and severe fatigue that result from their lack of specificity in killing cells. While such treatments kill all dividing cells, imatinib mesylate acts by a mechanism that is more specific to cancer cells.
