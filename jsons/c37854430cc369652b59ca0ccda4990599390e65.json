According to the WHO, the total number of confirmed and probable cases in the three countries reached 17,843, and 11,308 deaths were registered by March 2016. Since African great apes are vulnerable to Ebola as well (Leendertz et al. 2017) , we put all fieldwork with wild chimpanzees in Bossou and Nimba on hold for 1.5 years, from April 2014 to November 2015. We also asked the local people not to enter to the forest and asked the Guinean authorities to stop ecotourism to prevent possible transmission from humans to chimpanzees.

My colleagues and I have been running field experiments on stone tool use by wild chimpanzees at a designated site, Bossou's \"outdoor laboratory\", since 1988 (Matsuzawa 1994; Inoue-Nakamura and Matsuzawa 1997; Biro et al. 2003; Schofield et al. 2019) . In this natural clearing in the forest, located on top of a sacred hill, experimental objects (nuts and stones) are provided by experimenters, and chimpanzees crack nuts using stone hammers and anvils. We keep a distance of about 15 m from the chimpanzees, hiding ourselves behind a grass fence to record their behavior. Bossou chimpanzees often visit the outdoor laboratory spontaneously, as one of many oilpalm nut-cracking sites available in the area.",

So Ja bends a shrub, trying to encourage Jokro to play in this way, but still, Jokro does not move. After cracking nuts, the chimpanzees move on to feed on fruits high up in the trees. As they are moving from one tree to the next, I happen to observe that Jokro's big sister, Ja, is transporting a log. She carries the log on her shoulder, or holds it under her arm. When she stops on a branch, she gently pats the log. To me, this is somehow reminiscent of the toys of young girls native to the area around Bossou, whose dolls consist of a simple straight log with hair attached to the top. It seems as if Ja is pretending that the log is her ill little sister, and she is caring for it as her mother cared for Jokro. January 18. Ten days have passed since Jokro caught a cold. When her mother comes to sit nearby, Jokro slowly approaches her and starts to groom. Infants begin to groom their mother and other members of the community at the age of one-and-a-half years. However, infants are not very good groomers, and so the bouts tend to be short. But, on this day, Jokro grooms her mother for a long time, with eager attention (Fig. 2) .

Over the course of 45 years of study, from 1976 to 2020, we have recorded 58 chimpanzees at the site, and 11 confirmed cases and 6 probable cases of death among the Bossou community. I first encountered the death of a wild chimpanzee on January 17th 1988, during my second trip to Bossou. Guided by a bad smell, my colleague and I happened to come across the corpse of Npei, a 6.5-year-old male. We carefully measured his skull and bones and compared them with those from other field sites and captivity. In doing so, we learned about the physical development of wild chimpanzees from Npei's death (Matsuzawa et al. 1990 ). Many years later, I was faced with the death of a 58-year-old female named Velu. Based on my long-term observation of Velu and her offspring, I put together an account of her life story (Matsuzawa 2018) . As in the case of these two chimpanzees, the story of Jokro that I summarized above allows me to keep a record of a life that I witnessed through my fieldwork.",
