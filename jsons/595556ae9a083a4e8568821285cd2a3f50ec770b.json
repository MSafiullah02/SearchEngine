With the medical and surgical 38 training to provide all aspects of reproductive healthcare, OBGYNs are indispensable and uniquely 39 positioned to advocate for the full spectrum of care that our patients need right now. All patients have a Introduction 51 COVID-19 poses an unprecedented health and social crisis. Due to the massive strain placed on the 52 healthcare system, a critical need exists to preserve resources. Varying restrictions are appropriately in 53 place, limiting medical care based on regional disease impact and by recommendations from bodies 54 such as The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG). 1 \"Essential\" and \"elective\" are 55 the terms used to determine what procedures are preserved. By categorizing time-sensitive 56 reproductive health procedures (i.e. abortion), as \"non-essential\", several states have limited women's 57 reproductive health choices. The status of other procedures, such as sterilization and long-acting 58 reversible contraception (LARC) insertions or removals, have been debated and restricted during the 59 crisis. The maneuvering to impose barriers to women's reproductive autonomy during this time , we occupy a powerful space at the crossroads of politics, social justice, and reproductive 63 rights. This is a call to action for OBGYNs to fight for the preservation of reproductive healthcare. Our 64 call to action highlights areas under threat with concrete solutions to preserve and improve women'2020 joint statement of leading women's health organizations, abortion is affirmed to be a time-70 sensitive procedure to which access must be preserved. 2 With \"no-test\" protocols, appropriate patients 71 at less than 77 days of gestations, are able to access evidence-based, safe medication abortion without 72 in-person visits. This translates into a large percentage of patients receiving remote care entirely. These 73 \"no-test\" protocols keep appropriate abortion patients out of clinics and hospitals, minimize the use of 74 4 PPE, and maintain social distancing measures. Bans and restrictions on medication abortions are 75 politically motivated, and not based in science. We call on the OBGYN community to fight against recent 76 efforts to restrict abortion and advocate for the removal of current state laws (i.e. waiting periods, 77 mandatory two-visit medication abortion protocols) that place patients and health care workers pandemic, when hospital resource preservation is paramount, procedural abortions in the 82 outpatient setting are a low cost and safe option with minimal PPE utilization. Labeling abortion as a 83 \"non-essential\" procedure limits access, delays care, and unnecessarily increases the risks to maternal 84 health. Understanding regional healthcare limitations, we advocate that outpatient facilities obtain and 85 maintain the ability to perform procedural abortions. With outpatient abortion access maintained, 86 hospital-based procedural abortions are appropriately limited to the most medically complex patients. 87 88 Contraceptive Services during the COVID-19 Pandemic 89 Permanent Contraception: the role of Medicaid Extension 90 Postpartum care provides critical services encompassing contraception, mental health, lactation 91 support, and management of chronic diseases. Currently, Medicaid covers more than 40% of all births in 92 the United States, but for women with pregnancy-related Medicaid, coverage typically lapses after 60 93 days. 3 With this in mind, ACOG advocates for Medicaid extension to cover 12 months postpartum with 94 comprehensive care to decrease maternal morbidity and mortality in this period. 3 While ACOG 95 leadership felt this was critical prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, the national emergency that highly effective with typical use and has few medical contraindications. LARC use continues to 126 increase, and in populations where its use is widespread, unintended pregnancy and abortions have 127 decreased. Fortunately, contraception counseling is appropriate for virtual or in-person encounters.128 When a patient desires to have a LARC insertion or removal, and the region is able to accommodate 129 outpatient visits, LARC visits need to occur. We must advocate and create protocols for health care 130 practices to minimize exposure during a LARC procedure. If LARC placement is unavailable or undesired, 131 it is imperative to provide user-controlled methods of contraception (e.g. pill, patch, and ring) and 132 emergency contraception as desired. Refills and new prescriptions for short-acting methods can occur 133 safely by utilizing telemedicine. Preserving access to all contraceptive options will decrease current standards of practice and elimination of barriers to postpartum and outpatient 138 LARC and sterilization are essential, as is the preservation of abortion care in this unprecedented COVID-139 19 era. Our patients' reproductive autonomy depends on our commitment to both safely providing 140 these services and advocating for their availability at the health-system, local, state, and national level.141 Postpartum sterilization procedures and access to abortion are always time-sensitive and essential. The 142 indefinite postponement of postpartum sterilization and the absence of IPP LARC programs frequently 143 leads to hospital discharge without contraception and future unintended pregnancy.
