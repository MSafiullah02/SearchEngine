            "text": "Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) can cause severe and fatal acute respiratory disease in humans and remains endemic in the Middle East since first being identified in 2012. There are currently no approved vaccines or therapies available for MERS-CoV. In this study, we evaluated parainfluenza virus 5 (PIV5)-based vaccine expressing the MERS-CoV envelope spike protein (PIV5/ MERS-S) in a human DPP4 knockin C57BL/6 congenic mouse model (hDPP4 KI). Following a single-dose intranasal immunization, PIV5-MERS-S induced neutralizing antibody and robust T cell responses in hDPP4 KI mice. A single intranasal administration of 10 4 PFU PIV5-MERS-S provided complete protection against a lethal challenge with mouse-adapted MERS-CoV (MERS MA 6.1.2) and improved virus clearance in the lung. In comparison, single-dose intramuscular immunization with 10 6 PFU UV-inactivated MERS MA 6.1.2 mixed with Imject alum provided protection to only 25% of immunized mice. Intriguingly, an influx of eosinophils was observed only in the lungs of mice immunized with inactivated MERS-CoV, suggestive of a hypersensitivity-type response. Overall, our study indicated that PIV5-MERS-S is a promising effective vaccine candidate against MERS-CoV infection. IMPORTANCE MERS-CoV causes lethal infection in humans, and there is no vaccine. Our work demonstrates that PIV5 is a promising vector for developing a MERS vaccine. Furthermore, success of PIV5-based MERS vaccine can be employed to develop a vaccine for emerging CoVs such as SARS-CoV-2, which causes COVID-19.",

            "text": "M iddle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) emerged as a significant illness on the Saudi Arabian peninsula in mid-2012, and the causative agent was identified as a novel coronavirus (CoV), MERS-CoV (1) . MERS has a high mortality rate (\u03f335%) associated with severe lung disease that can advance to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). MERS-CoV, similarly to SARS-CoV, which caused a similar epidemic in 2003, has been a global cause for concern due to its high fatality rate. Epidemiologic studies established that MERS-CoV is zoonotic in origin, with transmission occurring from dromedary camels on the Arabian peninsula (2) (3) (4) . Spread from camels to people is documented (5) , as well as person-to-person spread among health care workers in hospital settings (6) . To date, MERS-CoV has spread to 27 countries and caused 858 deaths in 2,494 confirmed cases (4 February 2020, World Health Organization [WHO]), including a large travel-related outbreak in South Korea in 2015 (7) . MERS-CoV is an enveloped positive-stranded RNA virus whose entry into target cells is mediated by the viral envelope S protein. The S protein consists of an S1 subunit responsible for binding to the virus receptor, dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4 or CD26), via a receptor-binding domain (RBD), and an S2 subunit that mediates membrane fusion (8) (9) (10) . Thus, the S protein, particularly the RBD, is an important target for MERS-CoV vaccine development (8, 11, 12) . There is currently no vaccine or antiviral therapeutic against MERS-CoV. A number of candidate MERS-CoV vaccines, including those based on recombinant virus, viral vectors (e.g., MVA, adenovirus, and measles virus), nanoparticles, DNA, and DNA/protein, as well as subunit vaccines, are under development (12, 13) . None are approved; thus, the need remains for an effective and broadspectrum vaccine against MERS-CoV infection (14) .",

            "text": "PIV5, formerly known as simian virus 5 (SV5), is a nonsegmented, negative-strand, RNA virus (NNSV). It is a member of the Rubulavirus genus of the family Paramyxoviridae, which includes mumps virus (MuV) and human parainfluenza virus type 2 (HPIV2) and type 4 (HPIV4) (15) . PIV5 encodes eight known viral proteins (15) . Nucleocapsid protein (NP), phosphoprotein (P), and large RNA polymerase (L) protein are important for transcription and replication of the viral RNA genome. PIV5 is an excellent viral vector candidate for vaccine development; it is safe and infects a large number of mammals without being associated with any diseases, except kennel cough in dogs (16) (17) (18) (19) (20) . Because PIV5 does not have a DNA phase in its life cycle, its use avoids the possible unintended consequences of genetic modifications of host cell DNA through recombination or insertion. In comparison to positive-strand RNA viruses, the genome structure of PIV5 is stable. A recombinant PIV5 expressing F of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) has been generated, and the F gene was maintained for more than 10 generations (21) . PIV5 can be grown to 8 \u03eb 10 8 PFU/ml, indicating its potential as a costeffective and safe vaccine vector that may be used in mass production. We have discovered that PIV5-based influenza, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and rabies vaccines are efficacious (22) (23) (24) (25) (26) (27) (28) . In studies of influenza, we previously reported that that a PIV5 vector expressing influenza virus NA provided sterilizing immunity (no mortality, no morbidity, and no virus detected in the lungs of challenged mice at 4 days postchallenge) and PIV5 expressing NP protected 100% of mice against lethal influenza virus H1N1 challenge in mice (25) , demonstrating that PIV5 is an excellent vector for developing vaccines for respiratory pathogens. Here we investigate the utility of a PIV5-based vaccine expressing the MERS S protein in a robust humanized mouse model of lethal MERS-CoV infection.",

Previously, we inserted the HA gene of influenza A virus at different locations within the genome of PIV5 and found that the insertion at SH and HN generates the best immune responses (24) . Thus, we inserted the full-length gene of S of MERS at the SH and HN junction. A plasmid containing full-length PIV5 cDNA with the S gene insertion at SH and HN junction was constructed using standard molecular cloning techniques (Fig. 1A) . The plasmid was transfected into BHK cells along with plasmids expressing T7 RNA polymerase, NP, P, and L of PIV5, and infectious virus PIV5-MERS-S was rescued as described before (24) . The rescued virus was plaque-purified and then expanded to large quantity in MDBK cells for further analysis. The viral genome was sequenced and confirmed to contain the desired input DNA sequence. To verify S protein expression in PIV5-MERS-S-infected cells, the cells were infected at different MOIs and then lysed for immunoblotting using anti-S antibody. The full-length S and cleaved S2 fragments were observed in PIV5-MERS-S-infected cells, suggesting that the S protein was properly processed (Fig. 1B) . Expression of S protein in PIV5-MERS-S-infected cells was further confirmed by immunofluorescence assay (Fig. 1C) . Interestingly, PIV5-MERS-S caused massive syncytium formation in Vero cells. PIV5-MERS-S had a similar growth kinetics as wild-type PIV5 (Fig. 1D) .",

While both doses generated antibody responses, neutralizing titers were modest at 1:64 and 1:128 for the 10 4 and 10 6 doses, respectively ( Fig. 2A and B) .

A single dose of 10 6 PFU of PIV5-MERS-S resulted in a neutralization antibody titer as high as 1:2,000 in BALB/c mice (Fig. 2C) , consistent with a Th2dominant response in BALB/c mice.",

Further, to examine recall response of MERS-S-specific CD8 T cells, we challenged PIV5-MERS-S-and PIV5-GFPimmunized mice with 10 4 PFU of MERS-CoV MA 6.1.2. Our results show a significant increase in the recall CD8 T cell response at day 4 p.i. in comparison to PIV5-GFPimmunized mice ( Fig. 3E to G). We also observed 10-fold increase in MERS-S-specific CD8 T cells compared to the primary CD8 T cell response ( Fig. 3B to G).

A live attenuated SARS-CoV with rationally introduced mutations was efficacious in golden Syrian hamsters (30) . However, the development of a live attenuated vaccine for a positive-stranded RNA virus like SARS-CoV has often been hampered by safety concerns. Several MERS vaccine candidates are under investigation. A DNA-based vaccine expressing the full-length S protein is the most advanced to date (31) ; it is well tolerated in humans, as shown in a phase I clinical trial. The prime-boost regimen of MVA (Modified Vaccinia Ankara) expressing MERS S protein induced neutralizing antibodies and T cell responses in mice and limited viral replication after challenge in mice and camels. However, MVA-S did not provide sterilizing immunity, Immunization with PIV5 Expressing MERS-CoV Spike \u00ae and infectious MERS-CoV and genomic RNA were detected after challenge in mice and camels (32, 33) . The prime-boost regimen of measles virus (MV) expressing MERS S or soluble S induced both humoral and cellular immune responses. After MERS challenge, infectious MERS-CoV or genomic RNA significantly decreased, but these two vaccines did not provide sterilizing immunity, and signs of inflammation were observed in mouse lung tissue (34) . An inactivated rabies virus (RABV) expressing MERS S1 provided complete protection from MERS challenge in mice but three 10-g doses of vaccine were needed (35) . Furthermore, the Ad5/hDPP4-transduced mouse model used in these studies has limitations. Adenovirus (Ad5) expressing MERS S or S1 also induced a neutralizing antibody in mice (36) . Ad41, an enteric adenovirus, may induce enhanced mucosal immunity when administered via an oral or intragastric (i.g.) route (37, 38) . However, i.g. immunization of both Ad41-S and Ad5-S failed to generate mucosal immunity. Although Ad41-S induced humoral immunity in serum, it was significantly less than Ad5-S (39). Chimpanzee adenovirus-based vector systems have also been used (40) . In our work, we demonstrated that a single dose as low as 10 4 PFU of PIV5-MERS-S was sufficient to provide 100% protection against lethal MERS-CoV challenge. The low dose is especially advantageous in a situation where a mass immunization program is needed in a short period of time. To the best of our knowledge, this is the most efficacious MERS-CoV vaccine tested in a relevant animal model.",

            "text": "The protective mechanism of PIV5-MERS-S vaccine in C57BL/6 mice is likely due to robust cellular immune responses after PIV5-MERS-S immunization. While neutralizing antibody was generated in C57BL/6 mice after a single-dose immunization with PIV5-MERS-S, titers were modest at 1:64 and 1:128 with 10 4 PFU and 10 6 PFU of PIV5-MERS-S, respectively ( Fig. 2A and B) . Consistent with protective cellular immune responses protecting the mice, a significant influx of CD8 \u03e9 IFN-\u2425 \u03e9 cells was detected in lungs of C57BL/6 mice following PIV5-MERS-S immunization (Fig. 3) . Furthermore, the observation that PIV5-MERS-S-immunized mice had a higher rate of MERS virus clearance (Fig. 4C ) suggests a role for T cell-based immunity in protecting C57BL/6 mice against lethal challenge. Interestingly, in BALB/c mice, PIV5-MERS-S generated neutralizing antibody titers as high as 1:2,000 (Fig. 2C) . It is possible that the higher neutralizing antibody titers in BALB/c mice may be protective. Unfortunately, the only available small animal model is a humanized mouse model on the C57BL/6 background. It is known that the S protein is a major protective antigen for coronaviruses. It may be possible to improve our vaccine efficacy by expressing additional MERS-CoV proteins such as N and M using PIV5 as a vector. However, a parainfluenza virus 3 (PIV3)-based SARS-CoV vaccine candidate expressing N, M, or E without the S protein failed to protect hamsters from SARS-CoV challenge (41) . The ability of PIV5-MERS-S to generate cellular and humoral immune responses in mice may be in part attributed to the ability of PIV5 to express the MERS S protein in its native conformation. As shown in Fig. 1C , PIV5-MERS-S caused massive syncytium formation in Vero cells, indicating the S protein was functional in promoting cell-to-cell fusion. Thus, we reasoned that the S protein produced in PIV5-MERS-S-infected cells maintains a native conformation.",

Previously, a formalin-inactivated, whole-virus respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccine caused enhanced disease in vaccinated children, leading to vaccine-related deaths (44) . Similarly, inactivated MERS-CoV has been reported to generate a Th2-type immunopathology after MERS-CoV challenge in mice (29) . In the case of a PIV5-based RSV vaccine, extensive studies indicate that PIV5-based RSV vaccine does not cause enhanced diseases (45) . Thus, as a viral vector, PIV5 is not known to cause any enhanced diseases, and in our experiment, we observed no abnormal immune responses in PIV5-MERS-S-immunized mice after MERS-CoV challenge, suggesting that PIV5-MERS-S is unlikely to be associated with enhanced disease. Immunization with PIV5 Expressing MERS-CoV Spike \u00ae Lung tissues of mice immunized with inactivated MERS-CoV had an influx of eosinophils after MERS-CoV challenge, indicative of a hypersensitivity-type response. This result is consistent with a previous report that inactivated MERS-CoV immunization caused increased IL-4 and IL-5 expression and an influx of eosinophils in lungs after challenge (29) . Understanding whether immunization with inactivated MERS-CoV can cause enhanced disease is critical for developing a safe and effective vaccine.",

Then 10 6 PFU UV-inactivated viruses were 1:1 (vol/vol) mixed with Imject alum (Thermo, catalog no. 77161) and delivered to mice intramuscularly. Four weeks postimmunization, mice were infected intranasally with 10 5 PFU MERS MA 6.1.2 in 50 l DMEM. For passive immunization, sera were collected from hDPP4 KI mice that received 10 4 PFU PIV5-MERS-S or PIV5-GFP intranasally at 4 weeks postimmunization. Two hundred microliters of sera were transferred into hDPP4 KI mice intraperitoneally 1 day before challenge with 10 5 PFU MERS MA 6.1.2. Infected mice were examined daily, and weights were recorded.

Lungs were removed, fixed in zinc formalin overnight, and paraffin embedded. Lung sections (\u03f34-m thickness) were stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Tissues were evaluated by board-certified veterinary pathologists and scored using a postexamination masking method (51) . Lungs were scored for edema, hyaline membranes, cellular debris, and hemorrhage, with scores of 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 representing detection in 0%, less than 5%, 6% to 33%, 33% to 66%, and more than 66% of lung fields, respectively. Lungs were scored for mononuclear infiltrates, with scores of 0 representing values within normal parameters, 1 representing small aggregates in peribronchial and perivascular areas, 2 representing perivascular and periairway aggregates filling perivascular space, and 3 representing a score of 2 plus expanding sheets of infiltrates into septa and consolidation lesions in regions of the lung, respectively. Lungs were scored for granulocytic infiltrates, with scores as follows: 0, within normal parameters; 1, scattered PMNs sequestered in septa; 2, a score of 1 plus solitary PMNs extravasated in airspaces; 3, a score of 2 plus small aggregates in vessels and airspaces, respectively. Lung tissues were evaluated for perivascular eosinophil infiltration. Briefly, vessels with cellular infiltration (n \u03ed 20/lung) were randomly selected by a masked pathologist, and the number of eosinophils was enumerated and averaged for a final score for each lung (52) .",
