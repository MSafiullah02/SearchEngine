Nevertheless, there is a still a significant percentage of severe inflammatory conditions of the intestinal tract in which a cause is never found; this is frustrating for pathologists, clinicians, and owners. Frequently in the past and occasionally nowadays, severe, often fatal enteric inflammatory lesions of horses of unknown cause were referred to as colitis X. Because the name colitis X does not refer to a specific disease condition, but rather to a group of unknown causes that lead to a similar lesion and clinical outcome, it has been recommended that this term be no longer used. This recommendation is further supported by several enteric diseases of horses having been better characterized in recent years, and it has been shown that several different agents can produce clinical signs and lesions that are similar or identical to those of the so-called colitis X.8 This article discusses here the main inflammatory conditions of the gastrointestinal system of horses, with special emphasis on the diagnostic criteria.",

            "text": "Most cases of gastric ulceration in horses are nonspecific and are associated with stress related to diet, enteric disease, colonic impaction, ileus, surgery, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug (NSAID) therapy, or conditions that eventually produce duodenal reflux.7, 8, 9 The most common ulcers are those of the pars esophagea and, although the pathogenesis is unclear, it has been suggested to be similar to that in swine. It has been proposed that abnormal fluid content associated with feeding patterns allows acids, enzymes, and bile reflux into the cranial portion of the stomach, where, when the pH decreases to levels less than \u223c4.0, it damages the nonglandular gastric mucosa and leads to ulceration.8 Reflux of acidic content into the cranial part of the stomach is also thought to occur as a consequence of gastric compression associated with exercise-induced increased intra-abdominal pressure.10 This process would explain the high prevalence of ulceration of the pars esophagea seen in racehorses under intensive training.8, 11, 12, 13 For as-yet unexplained reasons, ulcers of the pars esophagea tend to be located close to the margo plicatus (Uzal and Diab, unpublished observation, 2015). These ulcers in racehorses are most often considered an incidental necropsy finding, with no clinical significance. However, in rare cases, very deep ulcers may lead to tearing of the stomach wall and gastric rupture.7 Unlike what often happens in pigs, the ulcers of the pars esophagea in horses do not cause massive internal bleeding. Ulcers of the pars esophagea in horses tend to be chronic, multifocal to coalescing, variably sized (ranging from less than 1 cm to several centimeters), round to irregularly shaped, with elevated borders, and a dark red or pale ulcer bed (Fig. 1\n). The depth of the mucosal damage varies from superficial erosions or shallow ulcers to very deep ulcers. On rare occasions, the damage from deep ulcers can extend into the underlying submucosa, muscularis, and serosa and lead to tearing of the wall and even stomach perforation or rupture, especially if the animal develops gastric impaction or bloat for other reasons. Microscopically, subacute and chronic ulcers have an ulcer bed of granulation tissue of variable thickness and maturity, which is surrounded by an infiltrate of mixed inflammatory cell population. A thin layer of necrotic debris is usually observed overlying the ulcers.8 Although ulcers of the glandular stomach are considered rare by many veterinarians (including the authors of this review), others suggest that they may be more common than is generally believed (Uzal and Diab, unpublished observation, 2015). These lesions have been associated with administration of NSAIDs.7, 8 The only way to establish a definitive diagnosis of gastric ulcers in the live horse is by gastric endoscopy.10 In dead horses these ulcers are readily visible during postmortem examination.8\n",

The first 2 are the most common.7 In all cases, the flies lay eggs on the hairs of the face, intermandibular region, or of the ventral part of the body and legs. When the eggs hatch, the first-stage larvae penetrate the oral mucosa, molt, emerge, and migrate through the alimentary canal. G intestinalis, the most common species, attaches to the mucosa of the pars esophagea, most commonly close to the cardia but also in other parts of this region, where it completes the subsequent molts. G nasalis attaches to the pyloric mucosa and the duodenal ampulla. G haemorrhoidalis attaches to the rectal mucosa.8, 14 All of these parasites occasionally attach themselves to the pharynx and esophagus, but consequences to the host are minimal to none. The exception is G pecorum, which may cause pharyngitis. In the summer, after the deposition of the ova, the larvae leave the stomach and pass out in the feces to pupate.8\n",

Therefore, a definitive diagnosis cannot be based on pathologic findings alone.3, 8 Confirmation of type C disease requires the detection of beta toxin in intestinal contents and/or feces, most frequently by ELISA.27 However, a negative result does not preclude a diagnosis of C perfringens type C infection because this toxin is very sensitive to trypsin and it is frequently broken down if diagnostic samples are not readily collected and properly preserved. Freezing and/or adding trypsin inhibitor to intestinal content specimens preserve the lifespan of beta toxin for several weeks.22 Isolation of C perfringens type C from intestinal contents or feces of animals with necrotizing enteritis is diagnostically significant because this microorganism is rarely found in the intestine of normal animals.8 Typing is done by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), for which several protocols are available.27 However, although at low prevalence, type C can be found in the intestine of healthy horses. Isolation of C perfringens type C from horses without intestinal disease is therefore of no diagnostic significance.3 (Uzal and Diab, unpublished observation, 2015). Combined infections by C perfringens type C and C difficile have been described in foals in which the gross and microscopic findings were almost identical to those described in the diseases caused by each of the microorganisms individually (Fig. 5\n).28 This observation stresses the need to perform a complete diagnostic work-up in foals with enteric disease, because detection of one agent does not preclude the presence of others as well.",

Exceptions to this age-related distribution of lesions may occur and therefore the disease cannot be ruled in or out based on lesion location only.4, 5, 29 The lesions tend to be similar regardless of the localization within the gastrointestinal tract, and they include hemorrhagic and/or necrotic mucosa that may or may not be covered by a multifocal or diffuse pseudomembrane, mesenteric and serosal hyperemia, and hemorrhage. When the colon is affected, the wall is typically thickened by clear or hemorrhagic, gelatinous, submucosal and mucosal edema. The small intestinal content in foals is most frequently hemorrhagic, but it may be yellow and pasty or green/brown and watery. In older foals and adults, the large intestinal contents may be hemorrhagic or composed of abundant green fluid.
