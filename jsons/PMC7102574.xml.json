If available, different software (e.g. Excel, SAS, R) and techniques from other working sectors are equally applicable for this purpose; as long as the user understands the input parameters and the uncertainty they carry on the outputs. Also, when the Np is defined, it could be assumed that after a while and especially before control measures are implemented, the virus could be more or less widespread within the target population. This assumption seems reasonable, if considering that the virus has spread worldwide within just a few months, and considering the syndromic data reported to date from large infected areas and cities where several thousands of cases occurred within just a few weeks from first detection.",

At a first glance, the application of the proposed principles and protocol (Fig. 1, Fig. 2, Fig. 3), could appear as unfeasible; because it could require overpassing some social, logistic and economical barriers; as never seen before. Nevertheless, we must also consider that this is a particular situation, which is challenging the health and economy as rarely seen in history. If the virus has been able to adapt across species, the human society should be able adapting quickly too, by working across countries, sectors and communities. The protocol is not a strict guideline with which everybody must comply. Rather, is a proposal for potential solutions and it is only a \u201cstarting\u201d point open to improvements and adaptations across different capacities and realities. In Table 1, are resumed some considerations on: strengths, limitations, and possible solutions for the protocol applications.",
