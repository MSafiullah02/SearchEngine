After exposure with UV through a mask for 15 s and 3   baked at 65 \u00baC for 1 min, 95 \u00baC for 2 min respectively, a second layer of 20 \u03bcm SU-8 10   photoresist was spin-coated onto the first layers. After the second exposure was under UV with a   herringbone structure on the mask for another 15 s, the silicon wafer was backed at 65 \u00baC for 3 min, 95 \u00baC for 5 min. After developing in the solution, the photoresist mold was exposed to the trimethylsilyl chloride vapor for 10 min in order to facilitate the mold release. The PDMS microchannel was fabricated by the standard soft lithography method. [3] The PDMS prepolymer (part A: part B = 10:1 w/w) was well mixed together and poured onto the photoresist master and then baked in an oven at 75 \u00b0C for 4 h. After that, the solid PDMS was peeled off from the master and punched with a blunt needle for the inlets and outlets. The stamp-stick room-temperature method was used to bind the PDMS slab with the glass slide with the ZnO surfaces together. [4] Briefly, the PDMS prepolymer (part A: part B = 5:1 w/w) was well mixed together and degassed in a vacuum. After that, a spin-coated method was used to produce a thin layer of the PDMS film on a clean silicon wafer with the speed of 6,800 rpm/min. The PDMS slab with the herringbone structure was put onto the wet PDMS film and picked it up immediately from the wet PDMS film. Then the PDMS slab with some wet PDMS was carefully put onto the glass slide with the ZnO nanorods and let the process allow to ~12 h. The bonded",

            "text": "should be noted that, the mAbs were continuously introduced into the ZnO-NIM from the corresponding branched channels at a very low flow rate of 3 \u03bcL/h in order to inhibit the undesired mixing of the two mAbs in the same branched channel. After the blocking and washing process, the H5N2 AIV, H7N2 AIV and the negative control samples were introduced into the ZnO-NIM from different branched channels sequentially. The concentration of the H5N2 AIV is 3.6\u00d710 6 EID 50 /mL, while the virus titer of the H7N2 AIV sample is 1:512 determined by the hemagglutination test. After washing, the mixture of the biotin labeled 9 detection H5 mAb-biotin and H7-mAb-biotin was loaded into the ZnO-NIM and reacted with the captured H5N2 AIV and H7N2 AIV in the different branched microchannels respectively. Then Cy3-SA was loaded and reacted with the H5-mAb-biotin and H7-mAb-biotin. The fluorescent images from different branched channels were recorded.",

Fluorescence signals for each sample were collected at the end of each annealing and elongation step. The cycle threshold (Ct) values for each sample and standard curve were analyzed by the SDS software program (version 1.4).",
