The ACS COT considers these to be minimum precautions and protection for all healthcare providers\u2019. With PPE in short supply, there is also a necessity to shepherd this resource and having everyone gown up is simply not possible. Doffing PPE is a high-risk activity that needs to be done carefully, correctly and best performed under supervision.",

The routine equipment carts were moved well away from the trauma bay. The trauma bay and resuscitation area were divided into hot, warm and cold zones (figure 3) in accordance with Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Hazmat practices.3 The hot zone was the area directly around the patient. The limit of the hot zone was marked using red duct tape to ensure a clear visual signal. Everything on the patient side of the red tape was considered potentially contaminated. Three feet from the hot zone was the warm zone and marked with yellow duct tape. This represents an area of lower potential contamination. In this area, we placed an operating room (OR) back table. This table was our \u2018transfer station\u2019 where we placed supplies from the cold zone to the hot zone to be used by the trauma team (figure 4). Mask, gloves and head covering was mandatory, but full and more stringent PPE was advised depending on the severity of the trauma and potential for contamination. This is the zone that the personnel who were in the hot zone doffed their PPE. The cold zone was outside the yellow tape and was where all supplies and persons not involved in the resuscitation were staged (figures 5 and 6). The team leader could easily direct the trauma resuscitation from this zone.",

Depending on how the trauma evaluation evolved, the team could be flexed up or down based on needs with overarching principle to limit exposing providers",
