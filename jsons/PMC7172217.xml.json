The list of atypical pathogens is long, and the more microbial diagnostic methods are used, the more pathogens are found. A recent example comprises the hantaviruses recently found in hantavirus pulmonary syndrome [1]. Although pneumonia and pneumonic symptoms had earlier been described in hantavirus infections, as had pulmonary edema in rickettsioses [2], no one expected a hemorrhagic fever virus to be the causative agent in severe pneumonias. The use of advanced microbial diagnostic methods established a new disease syndrome.",

Influenza virus continues to be a great scourge of all mankind, and a possible appearance of a new killer strain is in every autumn a greater menace than the feared Ebola virus. The other two agents also continue to be important respiratory tract pathogens, but being zoonoses, are limited in their occurrence mostly to cases with animal contacts. The 1940s saw the discovery of Eaton-PPLO agent [6], Mycoplasma pneumoniae, which still is one of the commonest and well-recognized causes of pneumonia worldwide. Virologic research has revealed a long list of viral agents, ranging from adenoviruses, enteroviruses, parainfluenza viruses, respiratory syncytial viruses, rhinoviruses and coronaviruses finally up to hantaviruses underlying the hantavirus pulmonary syndrome [1]. Viruses are by far the most numerous causative agents in respiratory tract infections with \u2018atypical pathogens\u2019, and the importance of pneumococcus is the only reason justifying the division between \u2018typical\u2019 and \u2018atypical\u2019 pathogens.",

The clinical description of mycoplasmal infections is classical but there are some open questions. One is the lack of reliable diagnostic methods, since conventional serologic methods, cold-agglutinin and complement-fixation tests, are neither sensitive nor specific, although the former is easy to perform. A second question is, how effective is the antibiotic treatment in mycoplasmal pneumonias? Mycoplasmal diseases in general are a neglected area, and we should not rely on serology only in the diagnosis of mycoplasmal pneumonias [8].",

Although its first member had been discovered over thirty years earlier [10], only then was it discovered to be the causative agent of several serious epidemics of respiratory infections. Relatively new also is its association with environmental constructions and air-conditioning technology. The descriptions of the importance, diagnosis and treatment of legionellosis have become established [11]. Over the years, at least 17 Legionella species have been associated with clinical diseases, especially with severe pneumonias, but the importance of these environmental bacteria varies considerably between different regions and settings. In some places they are causing a considerable proportion of all pneumonias [12] and are listed among the three major causes. In other areas, e.g. Finland, they are, despite an intensive search, rarities, usually imported by tourists.",

Therefore, cases are seen in connection with turkey and duck farming (chickens seem not to be important), pigeon breeding, and sick pet birds. Casual contacts with synanthropic birds are common, and ruling out a bird contact is much more difficult than finding one. There has been a debate over whether Chlamydia pneumoniae is a more common agent than Chlamydia psittaci. Even in the microimmunofluorescence (MIF) test it is sometimes difficult to differentiate these two chlamydial species from each other [13], and it demands expertise [14]. Fortunately, the treatment is the same in both chlamydial pneumonias. According to seroepidemiologic surveys, Chlamydia pneumoniae infections are 20-50 times more common than Chlamydia psittaci infections [15,16]. There is a possibility that the severity of Chlamydia psittaci infections could be due to the sensitization of the patient to this species by an earlier, mild Chlamydia pneumoniae pulmonary infection.",

When Chlamydia pneumoniae is given intranasally, acute infection with polymorphonuclear leukocytes in the lungs is seen only after massive challenge doses. Otherwise a silent pneumonitis with a clear histologic picture of mononuclear inflammation around bronchioles and vessels develop without overt illness. Repeated inoculations aggravate this inflammation temporarily, but the presence of the agent is difficult to demonstrate by isolation [22]. The demonstration of nucleic acids by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) gives, however, a positive finding and cortisone treatment, after alleviating inflammation, makes isolation of the agent possible [23]. Chlamydia pneumoniae is also demonstrable after intranasal challenge in the blood circulation, alveolar and peritoneal macrophages, and the liver and spleen, pointing to a disseminated infection [24].",

In a recent Finnish study on childhood pneumonias, the youngest patient with a Chlamydia pneumoniae infection was 7 years old, and the majority of patients were over 10 years of age (Korppi et al, unpublished data). Other respiratory syndromes associated with Chlamydia pneumoniae are rhinitis, sinusitis, pharyngitis, otitis, and bronchitis. A recent review of Chlamydia pneumoniae infections in children concentrated on respiratory tract infections [31]. However, during a Chlamydia pneumoniae epidemic in northern Finland, only a third of the children presenting a seroconversion were hospitalized because of respiratory tract symptoms (Uhari et al, unpublished data).

Chlamydia pneumoniae has a ciliostatic effect [37], which in these cases may help pneumococci carried in the upper respiratory tract to invade deeper layers. These double infections were more severe than usual and the response to antibiotics effective against the pneumococcus only was poor [38].

Attempts have been made to overcome this delay by the demonstration of IgM antibodies in the acute phase or by using \u2018diagnostic\u2019 high titers in the first serum sample. The pitfalls are the lack of IgM in reinfections and the uncertainty of the diagnostic value of high titers in acute diseases caused by several atypical agents.

Lack of commercially available reagents and kits is a problem in the diagnosis of uncommon atypical pathogens. However, in legionellosis, detection of antigen in urine seems to be a reliable diagnostic method [11,41]. In pneumonias, the presence of bacterial components in the circulation, alone or in immune complexes, has been used successfully in the diagnosis of pneumococcal pneumonias [42], but has remained unstudied in the case of atypical pathogens. These types of complex are commonly, seen, however, in chronic Chlamydia pneumoniae infections, which lessens their diagnostic value in acute infections, especially in elderly males with arteriosclerotic lesions [43].",

Q fever endocarditis is a feared complication, which often leads to valvular operations or drug therapy for the rest of the patients life [44]. Recently discovered Chlamydia pneumoniae seems to be associated with complications of unexpected severity and ubiquity. Signs of chronic Chlamydia pneumoniae infection have been found in both childhood [45] and adult-onset [46] asthma, chronic bronchitis [47], and sarcoidosis [48]. Most surprising is its association with arteriosclerosis, the leading cause of death in industrialized countries. Markers of chronic Chlamydia pneumoniae infections are found in acute myocardial infarction [49,50], and they have repeatedly been shown to be a risk factor for cardiac events [51,52]; and, finally, the pathogen has been demonstrated in atherosclerotic lesions [53, 54]. Animal experiments have been positive [55,56], as have preliminary intervention trials [57,58]. It may be possible that appropriate treatment of Chlamydia pneumoniae respiratory infection in the acute phase prevents infection from progressing to a chronic state, which can be much more difficult to cure.
