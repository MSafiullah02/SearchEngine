            "text": "Acute respiratory tract infections are a significant cause of morbidity and mortality especially during the winter months. The elderly, the immunocompromised and patients with respiratory problems such as emphysema and asthma are particularly vulnerable to developing severe disease. Viruses that commonly cause respiratory illness include influenza virus, parainfluenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), adenovirus, and human metapneumovirus. These viruses produce a range of symptoms including fever, rhinitis, pharyngitis and myalgia to more serious complications such as bronchitis, bronchiolitis, pneumonia and death (Boivin et al., 2004). Influenza virus and RSV are among the most common viral agents and rapid identification of the aetiology of infection allows better patient management in terms of treatment and infection control (Woo et al., 1997). Rapid detection of viral respiratory pathogens is also important for monitoring emerging influenza strains which may cause epidemics or pandemics. Conventional detection methods for influenza virus include cell culture, antigen detection, serological tests, and immunofluorescent antibody-based (IFA) methods. However, these tests are either too slow to allow timely diagnosis or they lack sensitivity and specificity. More recently immuno-chromatographic point of care tests (POCT) have been developed which have fast turn around times (Aslanzadeh et al., 2008, Selvarangan et al., 2008) however these assays often have limitations in sensitivity and specificity when compared to molecular tests (Boivin et al., 2004). The development of molecular diagnostic assays with superior sensitivity and significantly reduced turn around times when compared to conventional methodologies has led to them being considered to be the \u201cgold standard\u201d for respiratory virus detection (Leven, 2007). Numerous real-time RT-PCR assays for the detection of influenza virus and RSV have been described in either monoplex (Gueudin et al., 2003, Kuypers et al., 2004, Smith et al., 2003, Stone et al., 2004, van Elden et al., 2001) or multiplex format (Brittain-Long et al., 2008, Gunson et al., 2005, Hymas and Hillyard, 2009). The Regional Health Protection Agency Newcastle Laboratory tests all respiratory samples with a panel of \u201cin-house\u201d multiplex real-time PCR assays which target influenza A and B, parainfluenza 1\u20134, RSV A and B, rhinovirus, adenovirus, human metapnuemovirus; and coronaviruses NL63, OC43, 229E. However it is not feasible to provide urgent out of hours testing based on this multiplex format therefore alternative virus specific testing is preferable for urgent individual samples. A rapid, real-time PCR-based diagnostic test for RSV and influenza A and B which can be performed in a relatively short turn around time would be extremely useful for patient management (Goodrich and Miller, 2007). In addition, the resulting improved treatment of patients presenting with respiratory illness would help infection control, reduce nosocomial spread, and reduce the length of patient hospital stay (Woo et al., 1997).",

The aim of this study was to evaluate two multiplex real-time RT-PCR assays on the rapid SmartCycler real-time PCR system for the detection of influenza A and B and RSV. The assays used the Respiratory Syncytial Virus Analyte Specific Reagent (ASR) bead and the Influenza A/B ASR bead (Cepheid, Sunnyvale, USA) which contain PCR primers and probes in a lyophilized bead format. The RSV ASR bead contains primers and FAM-labelled probes targeting the N (nucleocapsid protein) gene of RSV types A and B. The Influenza A/B ASR bead contains primers and a FAM-labelled probe and an Alexa Fluor 532-labelled probe for the detection and differentiation of influenza A and B, respectively. When reconstituted the ASR bead provides sufficient primers and probes for two 25 \u03bcl PCR reactions. The influenza A and B ASR reagents have not been evaluated previously to determine their utility for the detection of influenza in clinical samples from patients with respiratory disease. In this study, the ASR reagents were evaluated in real-time RT-PCR assays using the SmartCycler real-time PCR instrument. The new assays were applied to the detection of influenza virus and RSV in a collection of samples previously tested using an \u201cin-house\u201d multiplex real-time RT-PCR assay.",

In addition it is not feasible for many laboratories to provide multiplex PCR testing outside of the normal laboratory opening hours therefore alternative PCR-based methods which can be performed using a random access real-time PCR instrument would shorten turn around times with obvious benefits for patient care.",

            "text": "In this study two rapid real-time PCR assays were evaluated for the detection of influenza and RSV in respiratory samples using the SmartCycler real-time PCR instrument. The RSV and influenza assays were applied to a total of 196 samples tested previously in our \u201cin-house\u201d multiplex real-time PCR test and comparison of the results demonstrated a concordance between the two tests of 98.5%. The SmartCycler RSV test failed to detect RSV in a single sample which was detected by the \u201cin-house\u201d multiplex assay. This false negative result may have been due to degradation of the sample because the extracted nucleic acids were stored at \u221280 \u00b0C for greater than 1 month following testing by the \u201cin-house\u201d multiplex assay prior to re-testing by the SmartCycler assay. The sample also produced a high Ct value (38.2) in the original \u201cin-house\u201d assay indicating it contained relatively low numbers of target virus. The SmartCycler influenza assay failed to detect influenza A in two samples which were positive for influenza A in the \u201cin-house\u201d multiplex assay. Again the extracted nucleic acid from these samples had been stored at \u221280 \u00b0C for greater than 1 month therefore sample degradation may have occurred. One of these samples also had a relatively high Ct value (40.5) in the \u201cin-house\u201d assay indicating that it contained low levels of target virus. These three samples were re-tested in the \u201cin-house\u201d assays and the original results confirmed. The SmartCycler assay also failed to detect influenza B in a sample demonstrated to contain both influenza A and B. Again this may have been due to sample degradation during storage or alternatively this may reflect differences in the sensitivity of the SmartCycler assay for the different influenza types. Finally these false negative results in both the SmartCycler RSV and influenza assays may be due to sequence variation in the target gene of the assays which may adversely affect the binding of the primers or probes.",

Alternatively these differences may be due to the way the two real-time PCR instruments calculated their Ct values relative to the automatically calculated threshold and cut offs. The positive predictive value of the SmartCycler tests were 100% for both RSV and influenza and the negative predictive value was 97.7% and 95.1% respectively for RSV and influenza.",

If this assay plus the random access real-time PCR system was used in conjunction with a rapid nucleic acid extraction instrument such as the Qiagen EZ1 instrument (Barkham, 2006, Dundas et al., 2008) sample turn around times could be significantly reduced and PCR assay set up simplified. This may facilitate the more urgent testing of respiratory samples by real-time PCR methods outside of the normal working day or outside of the batched runs during normal working day. Overall the ASR bead-based assay and the SmartCycler instrument provide sensitive, specific and rapid detection of RSV and influenza virus in clinical samples from patients with respiratory disease. Introduction of rapid real-time PCR methods for the diagnosis of illness caused by RSV and influenza, particularly outside of the normal laboratory working day would improve patient management and treatment.",
