As a result of experience with these infections, it was widely anticipated that future transfusion\u2010transmissible infections would result from viruses causing persistent infection, most probably parenterally transmitted. However, until around the year 2000, most effort relating to emerging infections was directed towards parasitic diseases. Attention was refocused on viral infections as a result of the outbreak of West Nile virus (WNV) disease in the USA along with the recognition that it was transmissible by transfusion [1]. This paper will briefly review currently emerging viruses other than WNV, which have been shown to be, or which have the potential to be transmitted by transfusion. Specifically omitted are CMV, EBV, hepatitis A virus and the B19 erythrovirus, which are demonstrably transmitted by transfusion, but which do not fit the current definition of emerging agents.",

In the case of HBV, selection pressure can additionally lead to the appearance of so\u2010called escape mutants that fail to express some of the antigens that are normally recognized by neutralizing antibodies [2].",

The latter two groups are genetically more distant and, in the case of group O, infection is not always detected by procedures that have been developed to detect antibodies to clade B which was originally most common in the USA and other developed countries [3]. The potential for continuing development of new clades and of recombinant viruses continues, and appropriate surveillance is necessary to ensure that sensitive tests are always available. In the USA, if a test is not validated for the detection of group O strains, donors must be deferred for a history of travel, sexual contact or residence in countries where these strains are found.",

However, in addition to HBV genotypes, there are also a number of mutations, some of which result in the absence of effective expression of all of the epitopes, particularly on the common \u2018a\u2019 antigen. Tests constructed with a limited repertoire of monoclonal detection antibodies may be unable to detect some of these mutant strains.

The disease, in common with most emerging infections, is a zoonosis and it is thought to have been transmitted to humans in south\u2010east China through the preparation of exotic mammals for human consumption, late in 2002 [7, 8]. As its name suggests, the disease manifested primarily with respiratory symptoms, but in the more serious cases, was also systemic. It was extremely infectious by the respiratory route, and probably also by the faecal\u2010oral route. As a result of rapid air transportation of infected individuals, it spread rapidly across the globe. Between 1 November 2002 and 10 July 2003, the WHO reported 5910 symptomatic cases, plus another 2527 for which no dates were available. Fortunately, this single outbreak was contained, and apart from a small handful of cases among laboratory workers, there does not appear to have been a recurrence of the disease.",

It is reasonable to ask why this outbreak of a new respiratory infection led to concern about blood safety. Perhaps the major issues were the seriousness of the disease, including its mortality rate and its remarkably high infectivity. In addition, as an entirely new disease, nothing was known about it, so preventative measures were taken in accordance with the precautionary principle. The WHO issued recommendations to reduce the risk of transfusion transmission, as did the FDA. These measures included deferral of donors with a history of the disease or contact with a patient and those with a history of travel from an affected area. Even relatively casual travel exposure (such as travel through the airport in Toronto) led to temporary deferral, at least in the USA. Subsequent to the development of these precautions, it became apparent that there could be viraemia during symptomatic disease, but it is still unknown whether there is a presymptomatic viraemia. Additionally, epidemiologic studies showed that there were asymptomatic infections, as judged by the prevalence of antibodies to the SARS coronavirus [11]. Again, however, it is unknown whether such asymptomatic infection is accompanied by viraemia. There were no recorded cases of transfusion\u2010transmission of SARS during the outbreak, although it is unclear whether they would actually have been recognized if they did occur.",

It is known to be the causative agent of Kaposi's sarcoma, both classical and human immunodeficiency virus\u2013associated, and is the likely causative agent of several other rare disorders, including primary effusion lymphoma and multicentric Castleman's disease [13]. It is naturally transmitted through saliva or sexual contact and has been transmitted through organ transplantation. In some cases, recipients of infected organ transplants have subsequently developed Kaposi's sarcoma [14, 15, 16]. Because of the pathogenic potential of this virus and because of the evident potential for blood\u2010borne transmission, there has been a continuing undercurrent of concern about HHV\u20108 among those involved with blood safety. It is important to note, however, that HHV\u20108 is not a new agent: rather, it is newly described. Presumably, blood from HHV\u20108\u2010infected individuals has been transfused for many years, yet there is no extant evidence of an association between transfusion and Kaposi's sarcoma or other HHV\u20108\u2010associated disease states.",

In 1997, Blackbourn and colleagues [17] reported on the detection of HHV\u20108 DNA in the blood of a seropositive blood donor; based on evidence of in vitro passage of the virus to allogeneic cells, the authors expressed concern about the potential for transmission by transfusion. In the same year, however, Operskalski and colleagues [18] used the TSS repository to examine samples from 10 recipients of blood from 14 donors who were subsequently shown to be HHV\u20108\u2010seropositive. None of the recipients showed any evidence of infection. Similarly, negative data on recipients of seropositive blood units have been reported from Jamaica [19]. In contrast, Cannon and associates [20] demonstrated an increased prevalence of HHV\u20108 antibodies among female injection drug users\u2014a result that was interpreted as evidence favouring blood\u2010borne transmission. Other studies generated similar results. Finally, there have been reports of an increased prevalence of HHV\u20108 antibodies among some, but not all, groups of blood recipients [21, 22]. It is perhaps worth pointing out that there is, as yet, no clear gold standard for HHV\u20108 antibodies and that the performance characteristics of available tests differ considerably and do not seem to correlate well with the presence of viral DNA [23, 24]. False\u2010positive reactions have also been noted.",

This translated to a risk of 0\u00b7082% per unit transfused. Although there were no infections among a control group of 75 non\u2010transfused individuals, the difference was not significant. The overall frequency of existing positive test results in the study population was quite high, at 11\u00b73%, although, in a different study, the donor prevalence was found to be 2\u00b74%. As with other studies, there is no clear donor\u2010recipient linkage or real proof that transfusion\u2010associated transmission had occurred. Linked donor samples were not available. The study adds to the weight of circumstantial evidence, however, that HHV\u20108 may be transmissible via transfusion.

The disease is somewhat similar to hepatitis A, although it is much more severe in pregnancy. Transmission is by the faecal\u2013oral route and is most often water\u2010borne. The virus is related to the calicivirus group and, as such, is a non\u2010enveloped virus that has an RNA genome. Although there is some evidence (based largely on seroprevalence studies) that HEV is present in the USA, it is found predominantly in tropical countries. Indeed, most cases identified in the USA appear to have resulted from infections that occurred in countries where HEV is endemic. HEV infection is self\u2010limited and acute and it has generally been thought that there is little risk of transmission by transfusion. Until recently, no cases of transfusion\u2010associated HEV infection of disease have been reported [29]. However, a number of recent cases of such transmission have been reported from non\u2010endemic areas, emphasizing that acute infections are also transmissible by transfusion, as long as there is an asymptomatic viraemic phase [30, 31].

In one case, scientists at Abbott Laboratories looked for genomic sequences related to those of an existing isolate known as the GB virus (GBV), which had previously been associated with hepatitis in a physician. Three viruses were identified, one of which (termed GBV\u2010C) was found among a number of human sources [32]. Working in parallel, but using a different approach, scientists at Gene\u2010Laboratories isolated viral RNA sequences and characterized a virus they termed hepatitis G virus (HGV) [33].

Perhaps not surprisingly, the virus is readily transmissible by transfusion and is found at high prevalence among individuals who have undergone multiple transfusions. However, it has not proved possible to demonstrate that infection with HGV is associated with hepatitis or even with signs of mild liver disease, such as elevated ALT levels. Indeed, HGV appears to be a virus that is currently in search of a disease. The term \u2018hepatitis\u2019 in its name may be a misnomer, attributable only to the fact that the virus was found in association with hepatitis in the first place.

Although there have been no recorded cases of transmission of mumps virus by transfusion, it is known that there is a viraemic phase and modest precautions to reduce the theoretical risk of transmission have been recommended by the AABB in the USA.",

            "text": "In the developed world, the major transfusion\u2010transmitted agents (with the exception of syphilis) have traditionally been viral. Interestingly, the general expectation at the end of the 20th century was that the next threat to blood safety would turn out to be a persistent, sexually transmitted virus. However, this was not the case. The unexpected emergence of WNV and its transmissibility by transfusion has taught us to broaden our thinking around the concept of transfusion\u2010associated infection. Nevertheless there are relatively few emerging viral infections that have shown any evidence of transmission by this route. There are certainly numerous viruses that have the potential for such transmission and continued vigilance is necessary. There are, however, no clear patterns that will define appropriate target patient groups for surveillance and we will have to continue to rely upon haemovigilance systems and astute clinicians to identify cases of emerging viral infections among blood recipients. Careful and appropriate use of the precautionary principle should also help to maintain the safety of the blood supply.",
