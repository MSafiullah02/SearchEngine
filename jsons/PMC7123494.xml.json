Pulmonary function tests usually reveal a restrictive defect with reduced diffusing capacity. Chest imaging shows patchy or diffuse ground-glass opacities or consolidations. Radiation recall pneumonitis can occur in patients with history of prior radiation to the chest. Chest imaging reveals pulmonary infiltrates in the same field as in the previous radiation therapy. Drugs commonly associated with radiation recall pneumonitis include doxorubicin, etoposide, paclitaxel, gemcitabine, and trastuzumab [6]. Diagnostic procedures are performed to exclude other likely etiologies especially infections or recurrence or progression of tumor. Definitive diagnosis usually requires transbronchial or open lung biopsy in conjunction with appropriate history.

Chest CT and other noninvasive tests can be helpful, but management entails rapid initiation of chemotherapy and broad-spectrum antibiotics against community-acquired organisms. FB-BAL is necessary only if initial treatment fails. (b) Progressive, subacute, lung infiltrates in patients with recurrence of underlying cancer. Radiographic findings can reveal peribronchial and perivascular nodules suggestive of specific lesions or interlobular septal thickening resulting in prominent secondary pulmonary lobules manifesting as tessellating polygons suggestive of carcinomatosis. Transbronchial biopsy is really helpful in this situation. (c) Acute respiratory failure in patients receiving consolidation therapy for hematological malignancies. Chest imaging reveals diffuse interstitial infiltrates characterized by a diffuse ground-glass appearance.

Noninvasive strategies such as respiratory virus PCR testing, sputum and blood cultures, urine and serum tests, echocardiography, and chest imaging are often useful.Corticosteroids are often used for patients with chemotherapy-induced lung injury and radiation pneumonitis.Management of ARF includes supplemental oxygen to correct hypoxemia, early initiation of appropriate empiric antimicrobial therapy for pneumonia, diuretics to decrease pulmonary congestion, early use of noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) in selected cases, and lung-protective ventilatory support for ARDS.\n",
