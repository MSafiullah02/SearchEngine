Flexible bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) is an important tool utilized to diagnose pulmonary disease [1,2]. BAL has been reported to identify infection, malignancy, diffuse alveolar hemorrhage, or pulmonary alveolar proteinosis, in 65% of patients with mixed hematologic malignancy [3], between 35 and 55% of bone marrow transplant recipients [4,5], between 41 and 50% of heart and lung transplant recipients [6,7] and between 52 and 56% of patients with mixed immunosuppression [[8], [9], [10]]. The duration of symptoms, type and duration of immunosuppression, timing of bronchoscopy, use of prophylactic and empiric antimicrobial therapy, and the presence of endemic infections vary significantly across populations and likely impact reported yields.",

It measures DNA concentration and counts the number of DNA replications cycles (cycle time) needed to produce a detectable concentration of DNA. Positivity was determined based on reaching a certain DNA threshold and the number of replication cycles required. If positivity is reached prior to 40 replications cycles the sample was considered positive. If positivity is reached after 40 replication cycles the sample was considered negative. Fewer replication cycles (cycle time) needed until positivity suggest higher burden of starting organism, whereas higher replication cycles (cycle time) needed until positivity suggests lower burden of starting organism. Viruses were identified using multiplex PCR (FilmArray Biofire) which identifies: 15 viruses (adenovirus, coronavirus (4 strains), metapneumovirus, rhinovirus/enterovirus, influenza A (3 strains), influenza B, respiratory syncytial virus, and parainfluenza 1\u20134) and 3 atypical bacteria (Mycoplasma pneumonia, Chlamydophila pneumonia, and Bordetella pertussis). Pneumocystis jiroveci identification by microscopy consisted of Grocott-Gomori methenamine silver stain and Calcofluor white stain, and conventional identification of viruses utilized standard culture techniques. Cytomegalovirus in HIV/AIDS [16], herpes simplex virus without concomitant dissemination [17], and Candida, Saccharomyces, and Penicillium species identified by culture were not considered positive.",

Duration of non-prophylactic antibiotics prior to bronchoscopy did not affect pneumocystis identification (p = 0.47) (Fig. 3\n). Fifty-four patients were on pneumocystis prophylaxis (15%) prior to bronchoscopy with 4 testing PCR positive (p = 0.32). No patients had recurrent pneumocystis pneumonia. Six patients had repeat bronchoscopies (6 weeks\u20133 years later) and repeat PCR testing was negative. 13/18 (72%) non-HIV/AIDS patients had positive (1,3)-Beta-D-Glucan testing with only five BAL PCR positive.

Compared to BAL PCR testing noninvasive viral testing occurred less often, 62% of patients and pneumocystis testing occurred in 10% of patients. Multiple factors contributed to that including infectious concern, bronchoscopy setting, and timing of bronchoscopy. Multiplex PCR testing has the advantage of identifying viruses not easily cultured (i.e. coronavirus and metapneumovirus) and faster analysis compared to viral culture [[12], [13], [14],18]. Unlike pneumocystis PCR testing multiplex PCR cannot measure cycle time and determining viral burden is not possible. We recently observed discordance between nasopharyngeal and BAL samples, making BAL testing a reasonable option if clinical suspicion is high for viral infection despite negative noninvasive testing [18]. A delay in starting oseltamavir occurred in two patients because non-BAL testing did not occur. While non-BAL PCR testing can be helpful in making a diagnosis, it is less helpful excluding infections as 19% of patients with positive non-BAL PCR testing had multiple organisms identified on BAL.",

We found a 12-fold increase in pneumocystis identification using PCR in our other immunosuppressed group (connective tissues disease or solid organ transplant) and no change in our HIV/AIDS identification rate (Table 3). The observed increase may be due to immunosuppressive therapies predisposing patients to infection with a lower burden of organism [27], and may explain why microscopy is typically negative. The increase may also be due to a combination of the lack of specific prophylaxis recommendations in connective tissue disease treatment [28,29] (only 9% of our patients in this group was on prophylaxis), the increased sensitivity of PCR testing, and the detection of reactivated latent [30] or self-limited pneumocystis infections. Based on our data PCR testing was equivalent to microscopy in diagnosing or excluding pneumocystis in HIV/AIDS patients. As a potential cost savings measure either test could be performed during BAL to diagnose or exclude pneumocystis in HIV/AIDS.",

We had six patients with PCR positivity only that had negative pneumocystis PCR testing on subsequent BAL testing. We would have expected persistent positivity if colonization occurred. We also had one patient with a cycle time difference of 13 when comparing non-BAL and BAL testing performed at the same time. This large difference makes using a single cycle time difficult in distinguishing when treatment is necessary. We think pneumocystis infection may occur on a spectrum, with high pneumocystis burden (low cycle time) requiring therapy while lower burden (high cycle time) being a self-limited process that may not requiring treatment. Compared to microscopy PCR testing is excellent at excluding disease as both Durand-Joly et al.(2005) [32] and our results found PCR testing to have 100% negative predictive value. (1,3)-Beta-D-Glucan testing calls into question the negative predictive value as we had four patients with positive testing and negative PCR testing. Sampling error could have contributed to these findings. Further studies are needed evaluating PCR cycle time in guiding treatment and comparing (1,3)-Beta-D-Glucan with negative PCR testing.",

Our study included two patients (5%) not treated, 11 patients (31%) treated with concomitant antibiotics along with anti-pneumocystis therapy (four with bacteria on BAL), and 17 patients (48.5%) had antibiotics stopped and treated with anti-pneumocystis therapy only after positive PCR testing. PCR testing led to the initiation of anti-pneumocystis therapy in 2/3 of patients after positive testing results returned. This approach limits potential toxicities [33] from empiric pneumocystis treatment. We do not think the treatment decisions made based on PCR testing affected morbidity or mortality. Importantly, in instances when BAL cannot be performed, pneumocystis therapy does not appear to decrease yield, as 28% of our patients were on pneumocystis anti-therapy prior to testing (1\u20134 days) and still had a positive PCR test.",

Second, provider discretion influenced whether patients underwent bronchoscopy as not every patient with pulmonary infiltrates was evaluated with bronchoscopy. Third, some patients had multiple infections (pulmonary and non-pulmonary) and these other infections may have affected antimicrobial management. We could not routinely ascertain what type of infection was of greatest concern at the time of bronchoscopy. Lastly, management decisions post-bronchoscopy were often made by multiple different providers, adding to the variability in management. Further prospective evaluations are needed to better define infection rates with standardized microbiologic evaluation and the impact on management decisions.",

Guidelines are currently lacking on microbial evaluation based on type of immunosuppression and radiographic abnormality. PCR testing on BAL samples is increasing identification of infections that previously went undiagnosed through conventional testing and allows for tailored therapy based on results. Further studies are needed to help guide when non-BAL and BAL testing should be pursued. Until further studies are completed, thoughtful microbial evaluation by clinicians remains the strongest tool to interpret the significance of testing results. Based on our findings, we propose that pneumocystis and viral PCR testing (both noninvasive and invasive) should be included in the evaluation of all immunosuppressed patients with ground glass opacities on imaging. Furthermore we propose that patients with positive pneumocystis PCR testing may actually have self-limiting infection and that pneumocystis infections may exist as a spectrum of disease. Further studies of this hypothesis are needed. Combined with clinical suspicion PCR testing can be a helpful tool in the managing infection in immunosuppressed patients.",
