The air-borne viruses are usually attached to nuclei sites which make them slightly larger. Nevertheless, these \u201cnano-aerosols\u201d or nano-particles can be inhaled readily by human into their bodies leading to chronic respiratory and cardiovascular diseases. Some of these pollutant particles are also formed from photochemical reaction of nitrogen oxide and hydrocarbon gases, including volatile organic compounds. In the presence of sunlight, they form irritating smog particles of sizes 10 to several hundreds of nanometers that cause impairment in visibility. Numerous cities in the world are faced with serious smog problems that affect literally millions of inhabitants, especially elderly with respiratory diseases and people suffering from asthma, let alone the impact on the economics for these cities.",

            "text": "With high aerosol loading, aerosols that got trapped by filter can reduce the flowable pores of the filter. Further, the region near the upstream end of the filter which faces the challenging aerosol stream tends to trap more aerosols not only just from the fibers of the filter, but also from the trapped aerosols themselves producing an avalanche/domino effect. This region is known as a \u201cskin\u201d layer [6], [7] with majority of the aerosol trapped tightly there and also it accounts for a large percentage of the pressure drop across the filter. This is also analogous to the skin effect in liquid filtration [8]. When the filter pressure drop reaches an unacceptable level, backpulse and backblow can be used to clean the filter [9], [10]. First, when a cake has already formed on the filter, the cake needs to be blown off first from the filter surface prior to blowing aerosols trapped inside the filter. Aerosols in the filter that are loosened by backpulse and being blowback to the upstream end of the filter may get recaptured in the skin region again reducing the flowable pores further. This certainly modifies the filter porous structure especially at the skin region even during cleaning. Some interesting questions remain to be addressed:1.How would deposition of aerosols during loading and re-deposition of aerosols during cleaning affect the skin layer filter properties, such as pore size, porosity and permeability? These properties certainly affect subsequent repeated cycles of loading/cleaning. This issue has not been investigated and is definitely important should filter regeneration be required for nanofiber filter.2.Another related question is how does the \u201cdepth filtration\u201d change over to the \u201csurface/cake filtration\u201d in a nanofiber filter, especially for such a thin filter with thickness only of orders of tens of micrometers, or even less?3.What is the role of the skin layer in this change over?\n",

A nanofiber filter with average 280 nm was used for testing. The pressure drop across the filter was monitored closely during loading and cleaning. When the pressure drop escalated to a maximum limit, loading was stopped and cleaning started. The pressure drop was monitored continuously until it reached a reasonable low value in which there was no further substantial decrease over time [9], then cleaning stopped and the next loading cycle began. The cycle was repeated for 5 more times with the pressure drop closely monitored.",

Nylon pellets purchased from Sigma without further processing was dissolved in formic acid to produce a 20% w/w solution. The solution was allowed sufficient time (at least 1\u20132 days) until all nylon pellets were being completely dissolved. The solution was placed in a trough of the needle-less electrospinning machine. The working principle of needle-less electrospinning is shown in Fig. 1\n. The feed rotor (positively charged) was mounted with 8 strings on its periphery. By adjusting the potential difference (40\u201380 kV), standoff distance (10\u201319 cm) between the rotating electrode and the grounded collecting plate, electrode rotating speed (6\u201350 Hz), and concentration (14\u201322% by wt.) of the N6 precursor solution, nanofibers with mean fiber diameters ranging from 90 to 280 nm were produced. The fabrication of N6 nanofiber was favored under high electric field around 70 kV, with sufficient time for solvent evaporation wherein the standoff distance being 15\u201319 cm, and feed electrode speed of 20\u201330 Hz. The specific values of the above parameters depended on the temperature and humidity of the laboratory environment, and the viscosity of the precursor solution. The solidosity (solid volume fraction) and the basis weight (mass of fiber per unit filter area) can be controlled by the electrospinning time in batch production, or by the travelling speed of the substrate material during continuous production, as well as the solution feeding rate by adjusting the electrode rotating speed during electrospinning.",

The strings were dipped into the solution by the rotation of the rotor drawing solution out of the trough onto the wire surface. When the wires rotated out of the solution, excess solution from the wires dripped back to the trough. As the solution thinned out to a film wrapping around the wire, the large electric field force can overcome the surface tension of the film at which Taylor cones formed along the surface of the wires. These cones evolved eventually into micro-jets leaving the wire making free flight towards the ground electrode under the intense electric field. In the due course, both evaporation of the solvent and repulsion of charges thinned out the fibers to a much smaller diameter by the time when they eventually got collected at the substrate attached to the ground electrode. The nanofibers formed are non-woven with mat thickness that can be controlled by electrospinning time. The longer is the spinning time, the thicker is the mat. Uniformity of the fiber thickness was assured with appropriate rotation speed of the collector during preparation of the fibers.",

Over time, a dense skin layer of aerosol deposit forms at the upstream end of the filter, while there is much less aerosol deposition in the downstream end of the filter. The pressure drop across the skin region also accounts for a large percentage of the entire pressure drop across the filter. Further with more aerosol loading, bridges of aerosols form across the open pore of the nanofiber filter at the upstream face leading to formation of a cake layer on the filter surface (surface or cake filtration).

The deposition of aerosols during the second loading can be described in Fig. 4\na by which the flowable pore of the nanofiber is depicted as a capillary with initial radius Ro (before second aerosol loading). The amount of aerosols can be idealized as deposition by the same aerosol volume uniformly redistributed in the interior wall along the capillary reducing the inner wall radius from initially Ro to R(t), wherein R(t) \u226a Ro, see Fig. 4b. When the capillary open area reduces to about 50\u201360% of its initial open area, it is assumed that the open area is so restrictive that further incoming aerosol will deposit as an \u201caerosol bridge across\u201d the open pore. The deposition of aerosols on existing bridges continues until the bridging process is completed with initial cake layer forming on top of these bridges and thus on the filter surface, see Fig. 4c. This condition can be modelled as though there is sufficient aerosol deposit filling the capillary to its center axis, see Fig. 4d. The cake continues to grow on the filter surface until the combined pressure drop across the filter and cake reaches the preset maximum pressure drop limit by which loading stops and cleaning is initiated. The subsequent loadings, 3rd, 4th, \u2026 , nth, etc. follow similar fashion as with the second loading. The major processes are1.Narrowing of the equivalent capillary pore with initial radius Ro in the skin layer.2.Bridging across the opening of the capillary pore. Aerosol bridges form on existing bridges until they interfere with each other merging to a continuous cake layer.3.Cake continues to build-up with more aerosol deposition until the preset pressure drop limit across the filter media and the cake is reached.4.Blowing the cake off the filter, partial removal of aerosol in the capillary leading to re-widening of the constricted capillary pore back to a \u201cnew\u201d Ro.\n",

In both cases, first the capillary is modelled as flowable capillaries across the entire filter thickness, which contrast with our model in which the capillaries are located only across the skin layer, that is only a small fraction upstream of the filter, which plays a dominant role in the filling and leading to the transition of cake formation on the filter. Second, in our model the deposition is assumed to be uniform across the capillaries of the skin layer; whereas in the other two earlier work [13], [14] the deposition is distributed non-uniformly across the capillaries. Third, after the capillaries are filled to a certain point, aerosol bridging across the capillary pore openings is initiated. Subsequent aerosol bridging occurs on the filter surface until the aerosol bridges from neighboring capillaries interfere with each other and merge to form a continuous cake layer above the filter surface. This \u201caerosol bridging\u201d process, the intermediate step which can take time, is absent in earlier work [13], [14]; and in fact, they assume the transition from capillary filling to cake formation is instantaneous. With our capillary model as described, which is distinctly used differently from earlier studies, we can write out the pertinent equations in the following.",

Note at the start of loading the pressure drop recorded is denoted as \u0394po (see Fig. 5b) and this value increases with increasing cycle, see Fig. 6a. For example, \u0394po is 22 Pa for a clean filter, after the first loading and cleaning, it jumps up to 104 Pa at the beginning of the 2nd loading cycle, 147 Pa for the 3rd, 147 for the 4th, 172 Pa for the 5th and finally 197 Pa for the 6th. \u0394po makes a large jump from 1st to 2nd due to formation of a skin layer and thereafter the skin layer keeps tightening over repeated loading and \u0394po keeps creeping upward but at a much slower pace. For reference, \u0394po is also compiled in Table 1.

The latter incorporates the flow resistance from the nanofiber filter media and the restricted capillary pore/opening in the nanofiber filter due to aerosol deposition, which includes aerosol deposition during loading and re-deposition during backpulse and backblow. The second is the major contributor to \u0394ps in as much as from the filter media itself. \u0394ps can be determined from Fig. 12a\u2013f in Table 2\nfor the 6 cycles.
