One such measure was a 'total lockdown' for several weeks across the country. A complex and unexpected outcome of the lockdown which has medical, ethical, economic, and social dimensions is related to alcohol consumption. The lockdown and consequent acute non-availability of alcohol resulted in people with alcohol dependence going into withdrawals, black marketing of alcohol, and in extreme cases suicide resulting from the alleged frustration of not having access to alcohol. The health dilemmas around this situation are biological (e.g. pushing people into risky situationspotentially fatal alcohol withdrawal, consumption of illicit or other non-consumable alcohol) and psychosocial (e.g. isolation increasing the risk of relapses, loss of control over the decision to abstain which can be detrimental to recovery, restriction of access to services for alcohol problems). The legal and rights-related dilemmas are centred around whether States have the right to impinge on individual autonomy on the grounds of public health, the capacity of the health systems to provide appropriate services to cope with those who will struggle with the unavailability of alcohol, the constitutionality of the Central government's impinging on jurisdiction of states under the guise of a health emergency caused by the pandemic, and the ability of the State to make unbiased decisions about this issue when it is highly dependent on the revenue from the sale of alcohol and associated industries. The way forward could be a pragmatic and utilitarian approach involving continued access to alcohol, while observing all physical distancing norms necessary during the pandemic, for those who want to continue drinking; and implementing innovative measures such as telecounselling for those who wish not to return back to drinking.",

As the number of Corona virus positive patients gradually started increasing across the country, the Central Government initiated measures to slow down the spread of the virus and to 'flatten the curve'. On 3 rd March 2020, India suspended all visas for citizens of Italy, Iran, South Korea and Japan (the most severely affected nations at that time) with immediate effect, and advisories were issued against non-essential travel to China, Iran, Italy and South Korea (The Hindu Net Desk, 2020) . Medical screening was instituted for travellers arriving from 14 countries and by 6 th March 2020 this was extended to include all international passengers (ET Bureau, 2020; The Hindu Net Desk, 2020) . From 13 th March 2020, India suspended visas for all travellers, including visa-free travel and those travellers allowed to enter were subject to quarantine orders (ET Bureau, 2020) . Finally, after a 14hour long 'test curfew' on 22 nd March, the Central Government announced a total lockdown, from 24 th March to 14 th April, which has been subsequently extended by 21 days to 3 rd May It would be premature to measure the gains or costs of the nationwide lockdown right now.",

As restaurants and pubs started downing shutters across the USA to comply with physical distancing recommendations, Americans started stocking up on alcoholic beverages along with non-perishables, cleaning products and medical supplies (CPG, FMCG & Retail, 2020) . In the week ending 14 th March 2020 the sales of beer, wine and spirits increased by 14%, 28% and 26%, respectively, compared to the same period in 2019. Furthermore, amidst the restrictions placed by the physical-distancing recommendations a lot of sales were online in nature, and over one week in the middle of March such sales increased massively by 243% (Rayome, 2020) . A similar pattern emerged in the UK as well, where alcohol sales in supermarkets and corner shops jumped by 22% in March. The total sales of wine, beer and spirits in the four weeks leading up to 22 nd March went up by \u00a3199 million compared with the same period in 2019, and this growth outstripped that of food purchases, even though customers were stockpiling have been more limited in geography or timing of availability. Greenland announced a ban on alcohol only in their capital, Nuuk. In Mexico, the sale of alcohol in some municipalities is limited to certain hours (e.g. Los Cabos and Canc\u00fan), and in the state of Nuevo Le\u00f3n, beer production and distribution has been suspended. India is one of the countries which has banned the sale of all alcohol beverages across the country with no exceptions, during the lockdown.",

Furthermore, harms from a given amount and pattern of drinking are higher for poorer drinkers and their families than for richer drinkers in any given society (Schmidt, & Room, 2013) . Since the 1990s, after India opened up its economy, there has been a steady increase in alcohol availability, alcohol consumption and alcohol-related problems in India (Prasad, 2009) , with almost half of all male drinkers having an alcohol use disorder (Rathod, Nadkarni, Bhana, & Shidhaye, 2015) . This has resulted in an epidemiological picture characterised by high rates of alcohol-attributable mortality and prevalence of alcohol use disorders (Benegal, 2005) .

While the police are involved in ensuring facilitation of essential services, checking on black-marketing, and enforcement of lockdown, they are also being burdened with ensuring stoppage of the flow of Gudumba, the illicitly distilled liquor in the state.",

One of the features of addictions is a self -perpetuating cycle of substance use leading to social isolation which in turn leads to more substance use. The lockdown and physical distancing due to COVID-19 is going to exacerbate the isolation and increase the risk of alcohol consumption and also lead to relapses in those who have recovered. Additionally, for those in recovery or wanting to start on that journey, it is important that they feel the decision to stop drinking is an autonomous one that is regulated through choice as an expression of oneself and not pressured by environmental forces (Deci & Ryan, 1987) . Long-term health benefits crucially result from autonomous behavioural decisions and behavioural changes resulting from such decisions that are not externally regulated are more sustainable (Dwyer, Hornsey, Smith, Oei, & Dingle, 2011; Williams, Gagn\u00e9, Ryan, & Deci, 2002) . In the case of the lockdown any discontinuation of drinking is not by choice and loss of control over the decision can be J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Journal Pre-proof detrimental to recovery. For others, the exacerbated anxiety and negative thinking that is inherent to the current experience of the pandemic and consequent lockdown can by itself be a significant trigger for relapse. And finally, in a setting when there is already an existing huge treatment gap for alcohol problems (86%), the highest among all mental and substance use disorders (Gururaj et al., 2016) , the lockdown is further going to restrict access to all face to face services that they were already accessing (e.g. Alcoholics Anonymous) or would want to access. Thus the combination of the lockdown with the banning of alcohol has created a situation where drinkers could go into dangerous withdrawal and not have access to appropriate help, or relapse, which in turn could put them at risk due to consumption of illicit alcohol.",

However, the Essential Commodities Act, 1955 gives 'essential commodities' an all-inclusive definition which \"means and includes any commodity in the list provided in the schedule to Section 2(a)\" of the Act. Not surprisingly, this list does not include alcohol. There is also a constitutional law issue in the way the Central government has banned alcohol. India is a quasi-federal state and the Constitution provides for a division of powers between the Central and State governments.

As and when alcohol sales are resumed we will have to deal with a cohort of individuals who had alcohol problems pre-lockdown and have now been forced into abstinence. Amongst that cohort will be those who choose to return to drinking. In those cases, the most pragmatic option for the state would be minimise the potential harm from their drinking which could arise directly through acute effects of alcohol intoxication spurred on by the long period of forced abstinence, effects on others around them such as domestic violence and diversion of scarce household finances from essential expenses to purchase of J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f alcohol, and indirect effects on epidemic control measures such as physical distancing at sites where alcohol will be sold. Measures to operationalise these could include allowing home delivery of alcohol (which is currently not allowed by law) to help with physical distancing, raising alcohol taxes significantly so alcohol becomes more expensive (and consequently results in reduction in amount of drinking in some sub groups of drinkers)-this also has the added benefit of bringing revenue to states desperate for funds, reduce access by limiting the number of hours the outlets are kept open, and encourage alcohol treatment services in the public and civil society sector using innovative strategies such as telecounselling. However, recent events have shown that implementing many of these will pose huge systemic challenges. After six weeks of lockdown when the Government allowed the re-opening of standalone liquor stores, the nation witnessed people queuing up over several kilometres to purchase alcohol and physical distancing rules being flouted, requiring shops to be shut down by the police (Dash, 2020) , and the Supreme Court recommending alcohol home-delivery while leaving it to the States to take the final call (Thomas, 2020) .
