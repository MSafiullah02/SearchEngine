            "text": "Mouse hepatitis virus 3 (MHV3) is a natural murine viral infection that, in experimental conditions, has a resistance pattern dependent on the genetic background of the animal. BALB/c mice are susceptible and adult A/J mice are resistant to MHV3. Our previous studies have shown that resistance to MHV3 infection in mouse populations can be a consequence of a T-cell dependent mechanism, in which the production of interferon-\u03b3 (IFN\u03b3) and the sensitivity of macrophages (M\u03a6) to IFN\u03b3 play an essential role (Vass\u00e3o et al., 2000). We have shown that the resistance of A/J mice to an MHV3 isolate that we have cloned, selected and amplified, is acquired after immunization with ultraviolet inactivated MHV3 (uvMHV3) and that IFN\u03b3 activation induces an antiviral state only in M\u03a6 from resistant mice, leading to a partial restriction of multiplication by significantly delaying virus replication. Recently, we have demonstrated that murine M\u03a6 are capable of secreting IFN\u03b3 upon a synergistic stimulation with interleukin (IL)-12 and IL-18, or an autocrine and T-cell independent M\u03a6 activation mechanism (Munder et al., 1998a, Munder et al., 2001).",

            "text": "In M\u03a6, nitric oxide synthase (NOS) and arginase are inducible enzymes that act on a common substrate, arginine. As a consequence, arginine is oxidized by NOS producing citrulline and nitric oxide (NO) or is hydrolyzed by arginases producing ornithine and urea. Ornithine is in turn catabolyzed by ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) for polyamine (putrescine, spermidine and spermine) biosynthesis or ornithine amino transferase (OAT) for glutamate or proline synthesis (Fig. 1\n). Difluoromethylornithine (DFMO), an analog of ornithine that inhibits ODC, has been used in the study of polyamine depletion (Wang and Wong, 2003). Polyamines, such as spermine, play several roles in cell differentiation and proliferation (Thomas and Thomas, 2001). Despite contradictory observations, it is generally accepted that polyamines contribute to virus maturation (Cohen, 1998). We have recently shown that a competition between NOS and arginase for their substrate takes place in mouse bone marrow-derived M\u03a6 (BMM\u03a6) and that they appear to define two alternate functional states of M\u03a6, induced by, respectively, Th1 (IFN\u03b3) and Th2 cytokines (IL-4 and IL-10) (Munder et al., 1998b, Munder et al., 1999). These cytokines would also differentially regulate NOS2 and arginase 1 in vivo (Hesse et al., 2001).",

Protective effects of NO have been related to infections involving ectromelia, vaccinia and herpes simplex 1 viruses (Harris et al., 1995; Melkova and Esteban, 1995), Coxsackie B3 virus (Lowenstein et al., 1996; Saura et al., 1999), Epstein-Barr virus (Kawanishi, 1995) and Japanese encephalitis virus (Saxena et al., 2000, Saxena et al., 2001). On the other hand, there are indications that NO may not be essential for virus clearance in vaccinia virus-infected mice (Rolph et al., 1996) or tick-borne encephalitis virus infection (Kreil and Eibl, 1996). Although arginase induction in M\u03a6 and its consequences has been poorly studied (Corraliza et al., 1995, Corraliza et al., 1997; Modolell et al., 1995), some reports implicate arginase in antiviral activities in M\u03a6, tumor cell cytotoxicity and immune response (Bansal and Ochoa, 2003; Mistry et al., 2001; Ochoa et al., 2001). More recent studies indicate that arginase induction is involved in host response to microbial infections although its protective or harmful role is uncertain (Morris, 2000; Ryo et al., 2000, Wu and Morris, 1998).",

            "text": "Concerning MHV3 infection, we have suggested in a previous publication that the anti-MHV3 state induced by IFN\u03b3 in M\u03a6, which may contribute to resistance, was not related to arginine metabolism (Pereira et al., 1997). Later published data indicate that resistance to MHV3 is dependent on the production of NO (Pope et al., 1998). Besides the fact that different mechanisms may contribute to resistance, a controversial finding seems to be a defect of NO production in susceptible BALB/c mice. Nevertheless, recent studies indicate that BALB/c mice are capable of producing NO in vivo (Fabre et al., 2004; Kwon et al., 2004). Unpublished data from our group show also that, in certain conditions, BALB/c mice are capable of producing NO in vivo, as evaluated by direct Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) spectroscopy in blood and liver. Genetic differences of the virus isolate or mouse strain used, as well as the basic mechanism considered for resistance may account for the divergent findings.",

Among the mechanisms proposed for resistance of some mouse strains to experimental MHV3 infection (Fingerote et al., 1996; Lamontagne et al., 1996), we have described a T-cell dependent one in which IFN\u03b3 synthesis and M\u03a6 sensitivity to IFN\u03b3 play a central role. Susceptible mice would develop a fatal hepatitis by lacking either the ability to synthesize IFN\u03b3 or cells capable of responding to IFN\u03b3. IFN\u03b3 would exert its activity by down-regulating the expression of the main viral receptor (Vass\u00e3o et al., 2000). Recently, we have also shown a novel pathway of autocrine M\u03a6 activation by demonstrating that M\u03a6, upon synergistic stimulation with IL-12 and IL-18, are a potent IFN\u03b3-producing cell (Munder et al., 1998a). BMM\u03a6 are a reliable non contaminated population which can support these findings (Munder et al., 2001). So, along with the classical or paracrine M\u03a6 activation by IFN\u03b3 produced by lymphoid cells, an autocrine M\u03a6 activation could take place, where IFN\u03b3 is produced by IL-12/IL-18-activated M\u03a6. Although their relative magnitudes are not yet known, both processes occurring in M\u03a6 could play a crucial role in controlling infections.",

The data presented show that synergistic activation by IL-12/IL-18 of M\u03a6 from resistant (A/J) and susceptible (BALB/c) mouse strains induced the expression of the IFN\u03b3 gene (Fig. 2A). BMM\u03a6 or PM\u03a6 of both spf mouse strains secreted IFN\u03b3 upon a synergistic IL-12/IL-18 activation (Fig. 2C) and the levels of secreted IFN\u03b3 increased along the time of stimulation and were higher in BALB/c M\u03a6 (Figs. 2B and C). Nevertheless, an anti-MHV3 state was observed only in A/J M\u03a6 upon a synergistic activation with IL-12/IL-18 or with exogenous IFN\u03b3 (Fig. 3). As expected, in the PM\u03a6 of non-spf animals, IFN\u03b3 synthesis could be observed also among M\u03a6 stimulated only with IL-12 or IL-18. Taken together, these results demonstrate that autocrine M\u03a6 activation takes place in both BALB/c and A/J M\u03a6 and, as shown for paracrine IFN\u03b3 M\u03a6 activation, only A/J M\u03a6 respond with the expression of an anti-MHV3 state. Both BMM\u03a6 and PM\u03a6 behave similarly regarding IFN\u03b3 synthesis and anti-MHV3 state. Among non-spf mice, which better mirror the natural state of mice concerning this endemic virus infection, their PM\u03a6 synthesize high levels of IFN\u03b3 upon treatment with only IL-12 or IL-18 possibly due to their already immunologically primed state or to the presence of other cells. The evidence that, after 72 h, the BMM\u03a6 from spf mice synthesized some IFN\u03b3 upon stimulation of only IL-18, may rely on the autocrine pathway. The contribution of each, the paracrine, T-cell dependent, and the autocrine, T-cell independent, mechanism of M\u03a6 activation during MHV3 infection remains to be determined. It is conceivable that autocrine-IFN\u03b3 synthesis participates in early stages of infection, prior to specific antigen recognition by lymphoid cells, not only by enhancing the M\u03a6 ability to restrict the agent's infectivity but also by enhancing the M\u03a6 ability to present antigens. By this way, autocrine M\u03a6 activation would represent a link between the innate and acquired immune response (Frucht et al., 2001).",

NO is a highly reactive molecule produced from a guanidine-nitrogen of arginine in a reaction catalyzed by NOS. NO is synthesized at high levels by M\u03a6 upon stimulation by Th1 cytokines (Hesse et al., 2001; Munder et al., 1999) and has been implicated in host defense (Guillemard et al., 1996; Harris et al., 1995; Kawanishi 1995; Lowenstein et al., 1996; Melkova and Esteban, 1995; Tucker et al., 1996). Arginase, an enzyme induced in M\u03a6 upon stimulation by Th2 cytokines (Hesse et al., 2001; Munder et al., 1999), drives the synthesis of ornithine, which is catalyzed by ODC to form polyamines (putrescine, spermidine and spermine). DFMO, an analog of ornithine, can irreversibly inhibit ODC causing polyamine depletion. Arginase has been implicated in virus inhibition and may potentially have an antimicrobial activity OR play an antimicrobial role (Corraliza et al., 1995; Modolell et al., 1995). Polyamines, such as spermine, play several roles in cell differentiation and proliferation and may contribute to virus maturation (Cohen, 1998; Thomas and Thomas, 2001; Wang and Wong, 2003). Although data have shown that polyamine depletion reduces cytomegalovirus or herpes simplex virus 2 infectivity, contradictory reports are found in the literature (Cohen, 1998).",

Arginase was induced only when IL-4/IL-10 was used for activation (Fig. 4B). Higher arginine consumption was observed in BMM\u03a6 from both strains upon IFN\u03b3 or IL-4 activation and, as expected, IFN\u03b3 activation led to higher citrulline synthesis and IL-4 activation to higher ornithine synthesis (Fig. 1, Fig. 5). Both arginine consumption and spermine synthesis increased during MHV3 infection. Although IL-12/IL-18 activation of both BALB/c and A/J BMM\u03a6 led to NO synthesis (Fig. 4A), a higher consumption of arginine was not observed in this situation (Fig. 5A). IL-12/IL-18 or IFN\u03b3 activation, mainly in MHV3 infected cells, led to a decreased synthesis of spermine only in A/J BMM\u03a6 (Fig. 5D). The putrescine and spermidine pattern levels followed that of spermine but at lower levels (data not shown). Intracellular polyamines were shown to be important during MHV3 replication since, in DFMO-treated BMM\u03a6, we detected a significant decrease in MHV3 titer (Table 1).",

The lack of arginase induction indicates the Th1 behavior of this type of autocrine activation. The fact that upon exposure to IL-12/IL-18, which induces endogenous IFN\u03b3 (Fig. 2) and NO (Fig. 4), we failed to observe the expected arginine consumption and citrulline synthesis, clearly observed when exogenous IFN\u03b3 was employed (Figs. 5A and B), may rely on inherent quantitative and kinetic characteristics of the process.",

In these M\u03a6, polyamines were induced during MHV3 infection and significantly inhibited upon activation by IFN\u03b3 or IL-12/IL-18. Supported by the data showing a decreased MHV3 replication in DFMO treated M\u03a6 (Table 1), the polyamine modulation by IFN\u03b3 correlates with the anti-MHV3 state observed only among A/J M\u03a6.
