Three extraction methods were tested, that is, the MagNA Pure LC TM , the COBAS Ampliprep TM , and the MagNA Pure 96 TM with 10-fold dilutions of an influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 sample. Two hundred thirty-nine respiratory specimens, 35 throat swabs, 164 nasopharyngeal specimens, and 40 broncho-alveolar fluids, were extracted with the MagNA Pure 96 TM and the COBAS Ampliprep TM instruments. Forty COBAS Ampliprep TM positive samples were also tested. Realtime PCRs were used to identify influenza A and influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, rhinovirus, enterovirus, adenovirus, varicella zoster virus, cytomegalovirus, and herpes simplex virus. Similar results were obtained on RNA extracted from dilutions of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 with the three systems: the MagNA Pure LC TM , the COBAS Ampliprep TM , and the MagNA Pure 96 TM . Data from clinical respiratory specimens extracted with the MagNA Pure 96 TM and COBAS Ampliprep TM instruments were in 98.5% in agreement (P < 0.0001) for influenza A and influenza A(H1N1)pdm09. Data for rhinovirus were in 97.3% agreement (P < 0.0001) and in 96.8% agreement for enterovirus. They were in 100% agreement for adenovirus. Data for cytomegalovirus and HSV1-2 were in 95.2% agreement (P < 0.0001). The MagNA Pure 96 TM instrument is easy-to-use, reliable, and has a high throughput for extracting total nucleic acid from respiratory specimens. These extracts are suitable for molecular diagnosis with any type of real-time PCR assay.",

The diagnosis must also be able to differentiate between influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 itself and other respiratory viruses that may appear as complications. An influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 infection might lead to hospitalization in an intensive care unit where the number of available beds is limited [Fuhrman et al., 2011] . Molecular diagnosis of viral infections has become the ''gold standard'' in hospital laboratories and has replaced increasingly cellular virus culture and direct immunoassays. While real-time PCRs have improved biological management, the nucleic acid extraction step remains time-consuming and fully automated extraction instruments are needed. High quality realtime PCR assays to identify a broad range of viruses can only be performed on a high quality total nucleic acid extract.",

Chan et al. compared two automatic extraction systems (the Nuclisens easyMAG and the Qiagen BioRobot 9604) with the manual QIAamp (Qiagen) extraction method. They found no difference in the sensitivities of all three methods. Furthermore, until recently the MagNA Pure LC TM system has provided an easy-to-use platform for extracting various clinical specimens. But we believe this is the first report of using the MagnA Pure 96 TM instrument to extract nucleic acids from a large number of routine clinical respiratory specimens, including broncho-alveolar fluids, throat samples, and nasopharyngeal samples that were collected in 1 week during the influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 pandemic. The results show that the two extraction systems performed very similarly on all the clinical respiratory specimens regardless the real-time PCR technology used. Moreover, the methods performed similarly regardless of the structure of the viruses (DNA and RNA, with or without an envelope). The viruses tested can serve as models for all other viruses, including influenza B, respiratory syncytial virus, and coronaviruses. Some of theses viruses, such as varicella zoster virus, are rarely found in respiratory infections, but as this was a prospective study, all the items requested by the clinicians were tested.",

In addition, as elution volume is 100 ml, only a single extraction is needed even if several PCR tests are to be done. This greatly reduces the technician's handson time and hence the cost of the entire PCR test.
