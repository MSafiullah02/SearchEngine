Alternatives to isoniazid prophylaxis in this population for those who have true allergies or severe intolerance to isoniazid are not clearly defined. Rifampin, another option for prophylaxis, has significant drug interactions with calcineurin inhibitors; if utilized, the course should be completed prior to transplantation. In transplant candidates with a clinical history, radiographs, and/or cultures suggesting infection with TB or nontuberculous mycobacteria, a thorough evaluation for active disease should be performed, which may include CT scans, bronchoscopy or other tests as deemed clinically necessary. Any mycobacterial infection should optimally be treated with documented microbiologic and radiographic resolution before transplantation is considered. Pretransplant colonization with fungi such as Aspergillus is common in lung transplant recipients, particularly in cystic fibrosis patients. Such colonization should prompt a rigorous evaluation to exclude active infection. Although posttransplant aspergillosis is a feared complication, transplant clinicians have generally relied more on posttransplant preemptive and prophylactic strategies rather than pretransplant antifungal therapy for colonized patients. A pretransplant candidate with invasive fungal infection (rather than colonization) should be treated at least until there is radiographic, clinical and microbiologic resolution in order to minimize the risk of this high-mortality infection posttransplant (III).Pretransplant screening for endemic mycoses is most useful in areas endemic for coccidioidomycosis, where a pretransplant history of active disease and/or seropositivity may prompt lifelong azole prophylaxis (II-2) (41). Pretransplant screening for histoplasmosis is of limited value since latent histoplasmosis may be present with a negative serology (III); instead, heightened awareness of the possibility of histoplasmosis is important when investigating a posttransplant febrile illness in a patient from an endemic area. Screening: Parasitic InfectionsPatients from endemic areas or who have traveled for extended periods of time to endemic areas for strongyloidiasis (including most tropical countries and parts of the southeastern United States) are at risk for development of disseminated strongyloidiasis after transplant. Although some centers screen with stool ova and parasite examinations, some experts favor screening with serology for Strongyloides, which is much more sensitive than stool exams (III). For seropositive patients, a short course of ivermectin or thiabendazole is indicated pretransplant, although randomized data are lacking. Regimens utilized include ivermectin 0.2 mg/kg daily for 2 days; some clinicians recommend repeating the same 2-day course one week later. As discussed above, Toxoplasma serology is important in heart recipients, and seronegative heart recipients with seropositive donors should receive prophylaxis (II-2)(42). Chagas disease and other parasitic infections are more fully discussed in the Parasitic Infections section of these Guidelines.", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF11": {"text": "Recipient Screening: Viral InfectionsActive primary infection with viruses such as CMV, EBV or HBV at the time of transplant is uncommon. Nonetheless, if active viral infection is detected in a potential recipient, transplantation should likely be delayed until the infection resolves in order to allow for development of natural immunity prior to transplant immunosuppression (III). This recommendation also extends to candidates who present for transplantation with clinical symptoms suggestive of an acute community-acquired viral infection. If there is any chance of exposure to HIV pretransplant, the potential recipient should have an HIV molecular detection test as well as HIV antibody testing (III). Viral screening of both donor and recipient is discussed in more detail above. The pretransplant evaluation presents an important opportunity to update the potential recipient's immunizations, since many vaccinations are more effective when administered prior to the onset of transplant immunosuppression (I). More detailed immunization recommendations are summarized in a later section of these Guidelines. The varicella-seronegative candidate should ideally be immunized against varicella prior to transplantation (II-3). However, if transplantation is expected imminently, it may be best to withhold it as varicella vaccine is a live attenuated vaccine (III). The zoster vaccine, also a live vaccine, is currently licensed for older adults who are not immunocompromised. Further data are awaited regarding whether pretransplant zoster vaccine prevents posttransplant zoster reactivation, but at the present time it would appear reasonable to administer the zoster vaccine if the transplant candidate meets current criteria for the vaccine and if transplant is not expected within 3 weeks.Yearly influenza vaccine should be administered to transplant candidates.. Vaccination of household contacts and health care workers is also very important, as immunocompromised patients may not mount an optimal antibody response to the vaccine (I).A hepatitis B vaccine series should ideally be administered pretransplant to seronegative individuals (II-2); especially as a potential donor may be found who is HBsAg negative but HBcAb positive. Some clinicians have advocated an accelerated course (e.g. 0, 1, 2 months) rather than the traditional schedule of 3 doses at 0, 1 and 6 months, but further data are awaited (III). The response to the vaccination is diminished in end-stage organ disease, so that early vaccination in the patient who may eventually require transplantation is indicated. Enhanced potency formulations for dialysis patients and others are available.Patients with advanced liver disease are at particularly high risk for fulminant hepatitis A and should receive hepatitis A vaccination (II-2). This vaccine is likely more effective when administered early on in liver disease (II-2). The combined hepatitis A and B vaccine is immunogenic but data are awaited in transplant candidates and recipients.Measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine contains live virus. Patients born inor before 1956 are presumed to have natural immunity. Patients born after 1956 who have not received a second dose of the MMR vaccine should receive a second dose, given pre rather than posttransplant (III). The 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine ideally should also be administered to transplant candidates over the age of 2 who have not received it within the past 5 years (III) (please see the Immunizations section for pediatric recommendations). The tetanus-diphtheria toxoid (Td) booster (or now preferably the Tdap or tetanusdiphtheria-acellular pertussis vaccine) should be administered if the potential adult recipient has not had a Td booster within 5-10 years (III). Prevention strategies for infection should not be limited to medications and vaccinations. A thorough education of the transplant recipient and his or her family is a very important preventive tool. Pretransplant classes and printed materials are helpful and should include information on handwashing/hand hygiene, environmental exposures, activities to avoid, food safety and handling, foodborne pathogens, pets and travel. It is also helpful for patients to have a general idea of the infections to which transplant patients are susceptible and the prevention strategies in use at their particular center. Pretransplant screening of the donor and recipient affords an opportunity to assess the safety of transplantation, to determine the prophylaxis and preventive strategies utilized posttransplant, to detect and fully treat active infection in the potential recipient prior to transplant, to update the vaccination status of the potential recipient, and to educate the patient and family about preventive measures. Future advances will likely include the increasing use of rapid molecular diagnostic testing, and possibly additional testing for emerging pathogens.
