We propose a solution to this problem using pre-shared keys, adapted from an equality testing protocol due to Ishai et al [2] . We discuss how this protocol can be used to maintain privacy within practical contact tracing scenarios, including both app-based approaches and approaches which leverage location history held by telecoms and internet service providers. We examine the efficiency of this approach and show that existing infrastructure is sufficient to support anonymised contact tracing at a national level.",

With the availability of users' location, there is a growing concern that private data can be used by an unauthorized entity in ways that infringe the individual right to privacy, for example by profiling user's behavior, targeting the user by stalking and spamming or drawing inferences about user's sensitive data. Unfortunately, there is an ongoing battle between personal privacy, the approaches used by governments, and the effectiveness of the approaches applied. For example, in South Korea and Israel, there has been a large public push back against the sharing of individuals' intimate information and the use of mass surveillance approaches respectively [5] .",

Further, in many areas, a minority of people have access to smartphones but may carry other GSM mobile devices that can be a source of information. For example in 2018 India had a smartphone penetration rate of 26% in comparison to 88% subscription rate to wireless phones [6] . Even in the countries which do not have this problem, there can be important groups in the society, such as older people, who have smaller smartphone ownership rates; this is critically important for COVID-19 as older people are in a high risk group [7, 8] . Such solutions can also struggle to get a large enough proportion of smartphone owners to use the app. Furthermore, if they rely on a single source of data such as Bluetooth, they might miss many other ones that are more widespread such as GPS or GSM triangulation.",

To achieve this, we have developed a simple framework which utilizes techniques from secure twoparty computation (2PC), whereby one party holds a database of private location data within a virtual private cloud or firewall and the other party holds a database of locations of confirmed COVID-19 patient locations for the same time period. The first database might be coming, for example, from a telecommunications service provider while the second is held by the government (see Figure 1 ). The goal is to identify if any of the locations in the former database lie within a threshold distance of locations in the latter database without revealing either database directly. In the literature this problem is known under the name of private proximity testing [9] The approach taken in this work is to first reduce the problem of private proximity testing into a blind contact tracing by an appropriate tessellation of the surface of the Earth [9, 10] . We then blindly compute a number of matches between each row of the two data sets over a fixed period of time (e.g. two weeks). In this way, we also hide the exact timestamp of the matching. We achieve this by modifying the perfectly secure protocol for equality testing presented in [2] .",

Chan et al. [14] present a thorough review of contact tracing smartphone apps based on Bluetooth and presents a new third-party free protocol. The authors specifically do not consider approaches based on absolute-location, such as ours, due to a cryptographic difficulty of protecting infected patients' locations. However, we believe our approach offers a simple and efficient solution that achieves that objective. The solution closely related to ours has been proposed by MIT [15] . Their smartphone-Private Kit: Safe Paths-builds location trail from GPS data of users. In its current iteration, data of infected patients is shared with the government who redacts them. This is a similar setup to ours however we stress that our solution offers perfect security against active adversaries. In its third iteration, Private Kit: Safe Paths will not rely on sharing information with the government but will instead perform a multi-party computation based on location trails of users. We do not know the proposed protocol, and therefore do not comment on its security, however both iterations require high participation rates for the solution to be effective.",

In the setting of computational security, the authors introduce a hash-based protocol with only two parties: the sender (server) and the receiver (client) without requiring the trusted dealer.

The sender receives no output and additionally, we require both the parties not to learn anything about the other party's location or database. This is a modified blind proximity testing problem. However, we can reduce it to a blind contact tracing problem by tessellating the surface of the Earth (the choice of the grid for which is described in Section 4.1). After doing this, the locations of Alice and Bob {x t }, {y t } are discrete and correspond to the unit cells in the grid. This reduction allows us to consider the joint function as equality on the input of the sender and receiver. The goal is to check for all t if x t = y t and output the total number of matches, N , to the receiver without leaking anything about the t. However, when the receiver's input matches the sender's input for all the t then receiver can trivially guess the sender's location. This functionality is inspired by the privacy-preserving equality testing where output y t is leaked to the receiver when x t = y t . Note that both the functionalities of equality testing and contact tracing achieve the same task of privacy-preserving equality with the same security against the malicious sender but different security requirements when receiver is adversarial. The ideal functionality for blind contact tracing can be defined in the following way.",

The correctness follows from the correctness of the one-time pad and permutation (2-wise and uniform). For the privacy of the receiver's input against a dishonest sender we argue in the following way. Note that the sender receives ({P t }, Q) from trusted dealer during the key generation phase and {x t + r t } from the receiver in the computation phase. The security of {x t } reduces to the one-time pad, assuming the trusted dealer doesn't collude with the sender and generates uniformly random bits. The privacy of the sender's input against a dishonest receiver is the following. In a single run of protocol, the receiver obtains ({r t }, {s Q(t) }) from the trusted dealer and {v Q(t) = P t (u t \u2212 y t )} from the sender. The sender's input privacy follows from the security guarantee of 2-wise random permutation and under the same assumption of no-collusion between the trusted dealer and the receiver. The receiver checks if v Q(t) = s Q(t) , but it doesn't get any information about t since Q is a random permutation over t. It is not difficult to verify that the blind contact tracing protocol is perfectly secure against active adversaries and is optimal in terms of communication complexity ( as shown in [2] . We also note that information theoretic security in two-party computation is not possible in the plain model unless certain assumptions such as trusted agents or shared secrets are made. Thus, our assumption of the trusted dealer can be justified in the sense that it allows us to achieve a strong security notion (information-theoretic) while preserving the efficiency of the protocol. Since the trusted dealer is never involved in the computation phase, as long as it do not collude with either of the parties, the protocol remain secure against any other attack by the trusted dealer.",

There are a few ways to do this such as constructing a square grid or hexagonal patterns, which are more efficient in terms of search queries, as seen in [9] . Both approaches satisfy the protocols correctness. The second consideration is that the Earth is not flat. To avoid error we must scale the mapping of location to tiles depending on the location on earth we are considering. In [17] , the Haversine approximation as outlined which approximates Earth as a sphere and has an approximation error rate of < 0.1%. We used an alternative approach, recommended by the FCC [18] , which uses an ellipsoid approximation to earth and has significantly less error over distance under a few hundred kilometers.
