            "text": "Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is a member of the genus Alphavirus (family Togaviridae), a group of widely distributed human and animal pathogens. The New world alphaviruses can cause encephalitic disease in humans, while the Old world alphaviruses, including CHIKV, Sindbis virus (SINV), O\u2019nyong nyong virus (ONNV) and Semliki Forest virus (SFV), are associated with rash, fever and (sometimes chronic) arthritis [1]. CHIKV is transmitted by vector mosquitoes and actively replicates in mosquitoes of the genus Aedes, in particular Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus. CHIKV is endemic in most of Central Africa and South-East Asia. In 2005-2006, major outbreaks of CHIKV occurred on the Indian Ocean islands of Mayotte, Seychelles, Mauritius and La R\u00e9union, where more than one-third of the population was infected and resultant deaths were reported [1] (Schwartz & Albert, 2010). In 2006-2007 CHIKV caused a major outbreak in India (~1.3 million cases), followed by outbreaks in the rest of South-East Asia [2]. The first autochthonous CHIKV outbreak in Europe occurred in Italy in 2007, where more than 200 people were infected [3]. Likewise, a local CHIKV transmission by Ae. albopictus occurred in France in 2010 (2 cases) and 2014 (4 cases) [4, 5]. The outbreak that started in the Caribbean in 2013 has spread to the American main land and by December 2014 over a million cases have been reported throughout the Americas [6, 7]. No licensed vaccine or antiviral treatment against CHIKV is available at present, but many prototype vaccines are in development [8\u201314].",

The four alphavirus non-structural proteins (nsP1-4) are directly translated from genomic RNA and form a replication complex (RC), which is associated with the plasma membrane and endosomal membranes [17]. A number of functions has been assigned to alphavirus nsPs: nsP1 is involved in capping of RNA [15] and is the membrane anchor of the RC [17], nsP2 has protease and helicase activity, causes host shut-off and inhibits interferon-induced JAK-STAT signaling and the unfolded protein response [18\u201321]. NsP4 serves as RNA-dependent RNA polymerase [16]. The functions of nsP3 are more enigmatic, but the protein is highly phosphorylated on serine and threonine residues [22, 23] and is essential for RNA synthesis [24] as part of the viral RC [17]. CHIKV nsP3 can be divided into three regions; the macrodomain (amino acids 1-160) is conserved among alphaviruses, Coronaviridae, rubella and hepatitis E viruses and can bind ADP-ribose, RNA and DNA in vitro [25]. The central, zinc-binding domain (amino acids 161-324) is conserved among alphaviruses, while the C-terminal region is highly variable and even shows substantial dissimilarity between CHIKV strains [26, 27].",

In both mammalian and mosquito cells the cellular protein Ras-GAP SH3 domain binding proteins (G3BPs) were found in nsP3-granules [28, 29]. G3BPs are ubiquitously expressed proteins conserved among eukaryotes. Mammals have three G3BPs: G3BP1, 2a and 2b, which are expressed from 2 distinct genes, while insects have one, named Rasputin (Rin) [30]. Mammalian G3BP is a widely used marker for stress granules (SGs) [31], which are cytoplasmic messenger ribonucleoproteins (mRNPs) that form when translation is impaired in response to several types of cellular stress [32]. NsP3-G3BP-granules are the explicit phenotype of the first reported function of alphavirus nsP3, as we have recently shown that CHIKV nsP3-G3BP granule formation prevents the establishment of bona fide SGs [33]. These nsP3-G3BP-granules did not contain other crucial SG marker eIF3 and cells expressing nsP3 were unable to respond normally to oxidative stress [33]. The inhibition of SGs via an interaction between nsP3 and G3BP has now also been confirmed for SFV [34]. Details on the interaction between nsP3 and mosquito Rin are currently lacking.",

Vector competence is a complex trait involving an interplay between vectors, pathogens and environmental factors [36] but the molecular details are not well understood. While it has been firmly established that antiviral RNAi pathways play a major role in controlling CHIKV and other arboviral infections in the mosquito [37, 38], other mechanisms of virus-host interactions that influence vector competence and the roles therein of viral (non) structural proteins need to be examined. Recently, however, nsP3 of ONNV (transmitted by Anopheles mosquitoes), has been uncovered as an important determinant for vector specificity. CHIKV does not normally infect An. gambiae, however, a chimeric virus containing ONNV nsP3 in a CHIKV infectious clone backbone became infectious for An. gambiae mosquitoes [39]. Thus, it is hypothesized that specific molecular interactions between mosquito host factors and alphavirus nsP3 determine the vector specificity.",

To determine which domains within nsP3 are responsible for the formation of nsP3-granules, truncated versions of nsP3 fused with EGFP (Fig. 1a) were expressed in insect cells (Fig. 1d). For these studies we used Sf21 cells because of their superior transfection efficiency as compared to mosquito cells. Removal of the entire C-terminal variable region (nsP3.2) resulted in the formation of filamentous, cytoplasmic structures. (Fig. 1d, left). To investigate whether the macrodomain could be eliminated from nsP3 without affecting its localization, it was deleted from EGFP-fused nsP3 and nsP3.2, yielding truncated mutants nsP3.7 and nsP3.8, respectively (Fig. 1a). When expressed in insect cells, nsP3.7 showed an identical granular phenotype as full-length nsP3, whereas nsP3.8 formed filaments that were very similar to those produced by nsP3.2 (Fig. 1d, middle). We observed similar filaments upon expression of these nsP3.2 or nsP3.8 constructs in mammalian cells, and showed that they did not colocalize with cytoskeleton markers actin or tubulin [33]. To investigate if the C-terminal, variable region alone could cause granule formation, it was N-terminally fused to EGFP (nsP3.10) (Fig. 1a) and expressed in insect cells. The localization of nsP3.10 was diffuse, nuclear-cytoplasmic (Fig. 1d, right), showing that the C-terminal region of CHIKV nsP3 is required, but not sufficient for the formation of nsP3 granules.",

When expressed in insect cells, Rin was evenly distributed throughout the cytoplasm (Fig.2b, left). However, when Rin was co-expressed with nsP3, which localized to small nsP3 granules (Fig. 2b, right), both proteins displayed strong co-localization and formed much larger granules (Fig. 2c, top). These nsP3- and Rin-positive granules or aggregates were larger and more asymmetrical than normal nsP3-granules. In this experiment, Rin was transiently (over) expressed, which may explain the large size of the granules. In contrast, when mCherry-Rin was co-expressed with the C-terminal truncated, filamentous mutants EGFP-nsP3.8 (Fig. 2c, bottom) or EGF-nsP3.2 (not shown), Rin did not co-localize with the filaments formed by these mutants and retained its diffuse, cytoplasmic localization (Fig. 2c, bottom).

Deletion of a conserved SH3-domain binding motif (PVAPPRRRR) in the variable domain of nsP3 resulted in a diffuse nuclear/cytoplasmic localization of nsP3 and abrogated the interaction between nsP3 and G3BP, restoring the potential of the cell to respond to oxidative stress [33]. A recent study, however, convincingly showed that the interaction between nsP3 and mammalian G3BP depends on two conserved repeats (with core sequence TFGD) in the variable domain of nsP3 [43]. To further investigate which domain(s) of nsP3 are crucial for the interaction between CHIKV nsP3 and Rin, both the SH3-domain binding motif and conserved TFGD repeats in the variable domain of nsP3 were mutated using site-directed mutagenesis (Fig. 3a). When EGFP-nsP3 and Rin-mCherry were transiently expressed in insect cells, both wild type proteins displayed perfect co-localization. Deletion of the SH3-domain binding motif (nsP3-d398/406) resulted in a diffuse nuclear/cytoplasmic distribution of nsP3 and a diffuse mainly cytoplasmic localization of Rin (Fig. 3b, second panel), identical to the distribution of nsP3 and G3BP in mammalian cells [33]. However, when conserved proline and/or argenine residues from the SH3-domain binding motif were substituted for alanines (nsP3-P398A and nsP3-PPR401AAA) the co-localization of nsP3 and Rin in cytoplasmic nsP3-granules remained unchanged (Fig. 3b).",

U4.4 mosquito cells were transfected with dsRNA from either Rin (dsRin) or firefly luciferase (dsLuc) as a control. Semi-quantitative RT-PCR on Ae. albopictus Rin mRNA, normalized by housekeeping gene S7 mRNA, showed a 90 % reduction in Rin mRNA when cells were transfected with dsRin RNA (Fig. 5a). Subsequent transient expression of EGFP-nsP3 displayed clear nsP3-granules in both dsRin and dsLuc transfected cells (Fig. 5b). This result indicates that the formation of CHIKV nsP3-granules in mosquito cells is independent of (high levels of) mosquito Rasputin.",

U4.4 mosquito cells were transfected with dsRin or dsLuc. Twenty four hours later, cells were infected with CHIKV at an MOI of five. Sixteen and twenty-four hpi, total RNA was isolated, viral structural proteins were detected and viral titers were determined. Semi-quantitative RT-PCR on transcripts purified from CHIKV infected cells showed that Rin silencing was efficient (>70 %) (Fig. 7a). To quantify replication levels of CHIKV in Rin silenced cells the relative levels of CHIKV genomic RNA were measured. CHIKV replication produced equal concentrations of genomic RNA in Rin-depleted versus dsLuc transfected cells at both timepoints (Fig. 7b). Structural protein expression of CHIKV was detected in an immunoblot using E2 polyclonal antiserum, with no apparent differences between dsRin and dsLuc transfected cells, at both timepoints (Fig. 7c, arrow). Correspondingly, the CHIKV titer in Rin-depleted cells was similar to the titer in cells transfected with dsLuc RNA (Fig. 7d). We conclude that Rin depletion in cultured U4.4 mosquito cells does not affect CHIKV RNA replication, structural protein expression or virion production. This result suggests that Rin is an important host factor required for CHIKV infection and dissemination in vivo without directly affecting CHIKV replication kinetics in in vitro cell culture.",

Our results show that the intracellular distribution of CHIKV nsP3 is conserved in cells from mammalian and insect origin. In mosquito cells, CHIKV nsP3 forms cytoplasmic granules, which are highly similar to the nsP3-G3BP granules that inhibit the formation of SGs in mammalian cells [33]. Removal of the variable domain results in the formation of filaments. Both the granular or filamentous nsP3 structures form independent of the N-terminal macrodomain. This indicates that multimerization of nsP3 is attributed to the central conserved domain. How nsP3 multimerizes into these two diverse cytoplasmic phenotypes is unknown, however, removal of the C-terminal variable domain may cause a conformational change or affect interactions with host factors which allows nsP3 to form long cytoplasmic filaments. Whereas Rin is clearly sequestered into nsP3-granules and transient overexpression of Rin may increase the size of the nsP3-granules, silencing of Rin and reducing its co-localization with nsP3 by mutagenesis shows that Rin is not required for the formation of nsP3-granules (Figs. 3, 4 and 5). Elucidation of the exact structural composition of these nsP3 granules and filaments, however, needs further experimentation.",

Amino acid substitutions within the SH3-domain binding motif, however, did not affect the formation of nsP3-granules or the sequestration of mosquito Rin into granules. Apparently, the amino acid substitutions were not sufficient to abrogate the interaction between nsP3 and Rin. Alternatively, deletion of the complete SH3-domain binding motif may have disrupted the folding of nsP3, rendering a dysfunctional protein that can no longer execute its normal function.

When we replaced the phenylalanine and glycine from either one of the nsP3 C-terminal TFGD repeat with alanines there was no apparent change in the co-localization of nsP3 and Rin. However, the interaction between nsP3 and Rin was completely lost when both TFGD repeats were mutated (Fig. 3c). This suggests a direct interaction between these amino acid repeats and Rin, and shows that both repeats are redundant for the interaction with Rin. Ae. albopictus Rin was isolated from U4.4 cells. Sequence analysis revealed that the N-terminal NTF2-like domain has high homology with other NTF2-like domains including human G3BP (Fig. 4a). The three-dimensional crystal structures of the NTF2-like domains from Drosophila Rin and human G3BP have recently been resolved, and contain a binding pocket for FxFG containing peptides [44, 45]. The NTF2-like domain from Ae. albopictus Rin was modelled onto that of Drosophila, showing high resemblance (Fig. 4b). As expected from this model, point mutations in the binding pocket of the Rin NTF2-like domain (position F34) greatly reduced the interaction between nsP3 and Rin (Fig. 4c). Although Rin still partly localized to nsP3-granules, this result does provide evidence of an interaction between CHIKV nsP3 and the NTF2-like FxFG binding pocket of Rin. A recent study has confirmed this interaction between homologous sites in SFV nsP3 and mammalian G3BP [46]. Additional interactions were predicted between FxFG peptides and residues in the NTF2-like binding pocket of G3BP [44], which could explain the strongly reduced, but not completely abolished, interaction of mutated Rin with nsP3.",

Interestingly, in vitro Rin silencing did not affect CHIKV infection in cultured mosquito cells (Fig. 7), which is in agreement with in vitro studies with SINV and siRNA-mediated G3BP1/2 silencing in mammalian cells [47]. However, simultaneous G3BP1/2 silencing reduced early CHIKV replication in 293/ACE2 cells [48]. These observations suggest that Rin may be involved in the initial establishment of a productive infection and/or affects CHIKV infections in specific mosquito tissues, e.g. the midgut. It also is an indication that results obtained in cell lines are not always a good proxy for results obtained in vivo. Indeed, midgut barriers have been described in arthropods that limit arbovirus replication and/or dissemination through the organism [49, 50]. The interaction between nsP3 and Rin may play a significant role in modulating the midgut antiviral responses. Interestingly, exchanging the nsP3 genes of CHIKV and ONNV made CHIKV infectious for An. gambiae [39]. Moreover, replacing only the C-terminal end of CHIKV nsP3, which is required for Rin interaction, with that of ONNV was sufficient to orally infect An. gambiae with CHIKV. This fragment encompasses the variable domain of CHIK nsP3, suggesting a strong role for the C-terminal domain of nsP3 in facilitating oral infection in specific vector species.",

In Drosophila, Rin is involved in Ras and Rho-mediated signaling, cell proliferation and oogenesis and has been suggested to form RNase inhibitor complexes [51\u201353], which could protect CHIKV RNA replication during the initial infection in the mosquito midgut. Clearly, the molecular details of the nsP3-Rin interaction in mosquitoes should be examined in follow up studies to uncover the exact mechanism.",

            "text": "In mammalian cells, G3BP is essential for assembly of SGs, which display many antiviral characteristics [54, 55]. In response, viruses often inhibit the formation of bona fide SGs (reviewed in [55]). Poliovirus 3C cleaves G3BP [56], whereas others, including alphaviruses, induce viral granules that sequester G3BP and/or other SG factors to favour viral replication [33, 34, 57\u201359]. Flavivirus and hepatitis C virus infections also bind SG components to increase their replication efficiency [58, 60] and G3BP1/2 are required for efficient CHIKV minus strand RNA transcription [48]. Together with our in vivo data on the proviral role of Rin in mosquitoes, this strongly suggests that viruses, including CHIKV, can utilize SG components (e.g. G3BP/Rin) for efficient replication in their natural hosts and/or vectors.CHIKV nsP3 co-localizes with G3BP homologue Rasputin in cytoplasmic granules.Two TFGD repeats within the C-term hypervariable domain of nsP3 interact with the NTF2-like domain of Rasputin.Rasputin silencing does not disrupt the granular localization of nsP3 and has no profound effects on viral replication in vitro.Rasputin silencing in vivo significantly reduces the CHIKV infection rate and dissemination in live Aedes albopictus mosquitoes.",
