Three studies showed a favourable effect [[7], [8], [9]]. A Chinese randomized control trial (RCT) conducted in 62 COVID-19 patients showed a significantly shortened body temperature recovery time, cough remission time and a larger proportion of improved pneumonia as assessed by CT scan in patients treated with 400 mg HCQ per day during five days (N = 31) than in controls (N = 31) [7]. Another Chinese RCT conducted in 150 COVID-19 patients showed significant favourable differences between patients treated with 1200 mg HCQ/day for three days, then 800 mg/day for two to three weeks (N = 75) and controls (N = 75) regarding alleviation of symptoms and decrease of C-reactive protein concentration [8]. An Iranian study conducted in a cohort of 100 COVID-19 patients treated with 200 mg HCQ twice daily (400 mg single dose when combined with administration of lopinavir/ritonavir) concluded that HCQ improved the clinical outcome of the patients [9].",

When potassium-depleting drugs could not be stopped or in case of documented hypokalaemia at admission, potassium supplementation was provided and HCQ was administered only when the potassium level was normalized. Close serum electrolyte analysis monitoring was performed in patients with low serum potassium levels at baseline. An electrocardiogram was routinely performed 48 h after the start of treatment. Treatment with HCQ was discontinued when the corrected QT interval (QTc, Bazett's formula) was > 500ms and the risk-benefit ratio of HCQ+AZ treatment was estimated by the infectious disease specialist and agreed with the cardiologist, at between 460 and 500ms.

In addition, cDNA was reverse transcribed directly from total viral SARS-CoV-2 RNA rhinopharyngeal samples following the manufacturer's recommendations. cDNAs were purified by using Agencourt AMPure beads (Beckman Coulter, Villepinte, France).

Their median age (69.0 years; 31\u201395 years) was significantly higher than that of patients included into the GO group (42.0 years; 14\u201386, p < .001) (Table 2). Sex ratio (M/F) was 1. When compared with patients in the GO group, PClinO group patients were significantly more likely to report previous hypertension (50%), diabetes (19.6%), coronary artery diseases (19.6%) and cancer (15.2%) (p < .001). In addition, they were more likely to receive beta-blocking agents, dihydropyridine derivatives, angiotensin II receptor blockers, and HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (p < .001), diuretics (p < .001) and metformin (p < .01). The time between onset of symptoms and the beginning of the treatment was shorter and their NEWS score was less likely to be low than in the GO group patients (Table 2). They were less likely to present with normal CT-scan at admission (p < .001). Interestingly, the mean HCQ dosage at day 2 (0.20 \u03bcg/ml (0.17)) was significantly lower than in the GO group (p < .01, Table 2) with 12/37 tested cases with a dosage lower than 0.100 \u03bcg/mL (p < .001), and 3 without detectable HCQ. However, upon multivariate analysis, only older age (OR = 1.11: 1.07\u20131.15), selective beta blocking agents (OR = 4.16: 1.19\u201314.55), angiotensin II receptor blockers (OR = 18.40: 6.28\u201353.90) and medium and high NEWS scores (OR = 9.48: 3.25\u201327.66; OR = 10.05: 3.16\u201332.02, respectively) were significantly associated with the poor clinical outcome (Table 4\n). When adjusting for hypertension in multivariate analysis, the two variables angiotensin II receptor blockers and selective beta blockers remained statistically associated with PClinO and PVirO. With a model selecting only people with hypertension, these two molecules remained significantly associated to the PClinO but not the PVirO outcome (angiotensin II receptor blockers, point estimate 34.7, 95% CI 4.98\u2013241.6 \u2013 selective beta blockers, 26.6, 95%CI 4.81\u2013146.9). Low dose CT scan score revealed pneumonia in 35 PClinO group patients (90%). Three severe patients were treated by anti-IL1 (anakinra) and none of them died. No patients were treated with steroids. High dose preventive or curative anticoagulants were administered for severe patients.",

Evidence is needed to augment the knowledge of outcomes of patients with COVID-19 who are treated with this drug combination. In our analysis, which is not a RCT but which relates the real-life experience of physicians treating patients in the context of an emerging pandemic, we report the outcomes of 1061 COVID-19 patients treated with an HCQ+AZ combination from the time of diagnosis. The spectrum of severity of COVID-19 ranges from mild symptoms to severe respiratory distress [1]. We assessed patients who received at least three days of treatment and eight days of follow-up. The majority of patients in our work had relatively mild disease at admission (95%). Under these conditions, the treatment was associated with a low proportion of patients with worsening of the disease, as only 10 patients (0.9%) were transferred to the intensive care unit and a low proportion of death, as only eight (0.75%) patients died (case fatality rate updated April 18th, 2020). It was also associated with a low frequency of persistent viral shedding. In our experience, the treatment was well tolerated with only a low proportion of adverse events (2.4%), all of which were mild with three discontinuations of treatment (0.3%) [25].",

In China, drugs that were recommended were primarily HCQ but also \u03b1-interferon, lopinavir, ritonavir and umifenovir [27], in Korea, recommended drugs were lopinavir/ritonavir and chloroquine [28]. In the context of a pandemic with a lethal respiratory virus, we believe that early detection of positive cases and carefully controlled treatment with safe and well-tolerated drugs should be generalized in outpatient medicine, i.e. in individuals with mild symptoms before signs of severity appear. Strict attention should be paid to contraindications and possible interactions with concomitant medication. Finally, there is a need to repurpose existing drugs and evaluate these in controlled trials where possible in the constraints of a pandemic.",
