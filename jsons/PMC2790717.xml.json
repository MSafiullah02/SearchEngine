Each monomer contains a surface subunit, gp120, for virus binding to CD4 receptor and coreceptors [14], [15], [16], [17] and a noncovalently associated transmembrane subunit, gp41, that mediates fusion of the virus with the target cell [18], [19]. Fig. 2\nA shows the structure of HIV-1 gp41. Like other type I transmembrane proteins, HIV-1 gp41 consists of extracellular (ectodomain), transmembrane, and cytoplasmic domains. The ectodomain contains four functional regions: the fusion peptide (FP), N-terminal heptad repeat (NHR), C-terminal heptad repeat (CHR), and a tryptophan-rich region (TR). Binding of gp120 to the cellular receptor CD4 and coreceptor triggers conformational changes in gp41 that induce fusion [20], [21], [22], [23]. This increases exposure of two heptad repeat motifs, NHR and CHR, and insertion of the fusion peptide into the target membrane [20], [21], [22], [23]. Subsequently NHR and CHR fold in an antiparallel manner to create the six-helix bundle 6HB composed of a trimeric NHR coiled-coil core surrounded by three CHR helices that pack in the grooves of the coiled-coil as seen in Fig. 2B [24], [25], [26]. Formation of the 6HB promotes fusion between viral and cellular membranes and is essential for viral entry and infection [25], [26]. Ole and HT interact with the NHR coiled-coil trimer N36 helices and interfere with the formation of 6HB with the CHR, C34, as shown in Fig. 2C and D.",

Ole and HT form stable hydrogen bonds with Q577 on the N36 peptide. Fig. 3E and F are ribbon representations of the predicted binding site of Ole and HT. 5HB, consisting of three N36-peptides (pink, residues 546\u2013581) and two C34 peptides (green, residues 628\u2013661), is used for docking calculations. Only one groove is exposed for the binding of small molecules. Both Ole and HT occupy the binding site similarly, with the diphenol ring forming stable hydrogen bonds with Q577. This blocks the close contacts between the hydrophobic groove in the gp41 NHR and the indole rings of W631 and W628, thus interfering with the formation of 6HB. In addition to hydrogen binding, hydrophobic interactions with I573, G572, and L568 also play important roles in the interaction.",

The electrodes were connected from cathode (negative terminal on top) to anode (positive terminal on bottom) and the peptides move in the electric field according to their charge and size. Peptides carrying net negative charges, such as C34, move toward the positive terminal (bottom) whereas peptides carrying net positive charges, such as N36, move toward the negative terminal or remain at the top of the well. Incubation of N36 and C34 resulted in the formation of the 6HB fusion complex which is larger than C34, moves slower than free C34, and thus migrates to the middle of the gel. Pre-incubation of N36 with Ole or HT results in inhibition of 6HB formation. A dose dependent disappearance of 6HB band was detected with concomitant appearance of the free C34 band. Total inhibition is achieved at 100 nM Ole or HT with EC50s around 66 and 58 nM. These results confirm the predictions from molecular modeling.",

Consistent with this, we found that Ole and HT are active against a panel of HIV-1 primary isolates that includes both M and T tropic strains from different clades.
