Using the daily air-traffic transportation data we perform numerical experiments to compare the infection arrival time with this alternative metric that is obtained by accounting for multiple walks instead of only the most probable path. The comparison with direct simulations reveals a higher correlation compared to the shortest-path approach used previously. In addition our method allows to connect fundamental observables in epidemic spreading with the cumulant-generating function of the hitting time for a Markov chain. Our results provides a general and computationally efficient approach using only algebraic methods.",

Prominent examples are the mapping of the World Wide Web and structure of the Internet, social and financial networks, epidemiology, and language dynamics [1] [2] [3] [4] . In the context of epidemic spreading the prediction of outbreaks has become particularly important for public health issues. The rapid growth in the velocity of transportation means and frequency of movements has further increased the risk that global emergent diseases such as H1N1 [5] , SARS [6] , or EBOV [7] , and more recently ZIKV [8] , will spread worldwide. The underlying mobility networks are usually scale-free [9] . This implies the absence of an epidemic threshold [10] that allows any transmittable disease to spread through the global population.",

            "text": "In this work we introduce a network-based measure that generalizes the concept of distance and that provides fundamental insights into the dynamics of disease transmission as well as an efficient numerical estimation of the infection * iannelli.flavio@gmail.com arrival time. We compare this effective distance [16] with the numerical estimate of the transmission times using a metapopulation model to validate the method. A series of papers have already been devoted to this problem [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] . Most of them rely on the concept of most probable path, the shortest-path effective distance D SP ij for each source i and target j in the network. The latter can be defined, for both directed and undirected networks, as the geodesic graph distance with edge weights given by the first moment of a Gumbel distributed variable which depends only on the network topology and the infection rate. This shortest-path approach, however, significantly overestimates the infection arrival times [18, 22] . A more realistic scenario takes into account all possible paths [19] yielding the multiple-path distance D MP ij , which is better suited to estimate the arrival times of the infection. This method allows, at least in principle, to take into account all possible directed transmission paths, although the computation becomes infeasible as their number grows exponentially with the the number of vertices in the network. The lack of a practical computational approach leads back to considering only the shortest path. A logarithmic ad hoc edge weight transformation was introduced in Ref. [20] by simply requiring that adding edges should translate to multiplying the associated probabilities. This follows the intuitive argument that a higher number of passengers reduces the separation distance between neighboring nodes. This logarithmic transformation can be viewed as a log-space reduction [23] and, as we will show later, it can be derived as a special case of the shortest-path effective distance defined previously in Ref. [18] . The estimated arrival time T AR ij from node i to node j , obtained from numerical simulations, correlates highly with the shortest-path effective distance. Using this metrics the complexity of disease transmission can be understood in terms of circular waves propagating at constant velocity from the infected node at time zero to all other nodes in the network [20] . The measure we introduce here aims to generalize previous definitions by including all walks that connect source and target.",

The high correlation with the infection arrival time found in Ref. [20] using a shortest-path approach (light blue) is improved when considering the random-walk effective distance (violet). The points on the dashed diagonal indicate a perfect agreement between the simulation and the effective distance. The correlation distribution considering all nodes in the network as initial infected seed shows that not only the measure proposed here possesses a higher averaged correlation but it is also more peaked around it (see Fig. 4) . A remarkable interpretation of the random-walk effective distance can be found by noticing that by definition D RW ij (\u03b4) = \u2212 ln e \u2212\u03b4h j i , where h j is the hitting time to node j [30] .

The proposed random-walk effective distance includes the previously defined shortest-path measure as a particular case. The remarkable correlation found with the infection arrival time can be explained as follows. The contribution of looped trajectories in the propagation of physical information is neglected because of the decreasing exponential in the walk length. The latter serves as damping such contributions for long walks, and in particular allows us to neglect infinite loop contributions. In scenarios where multiple parallel paths are important, for instance, in Erd\u0151s-R\u00e9nyi graphs or regular lattices, the assumption of a single dominant path breaks down, and the measure proposed here can be used as an efficient alternative. The predictive power of the random-walk effective distance can be used for containment strategies and estimation of arrival times for real global pandemics from the underlying networks topology. The random-walk metric can in fact be generally applied to any weighted and directed network besides the transportation ones, for instance, in the context of social interactions and rumor spreading. For unweighted locally treelike networks both the shortest-path and random-walk effective distances yield maximum correlation with the simulated arrival time, as the shortest path tends to dominate.",

The connection with the cumulant-generating function allows for an interpretation within statistical physics.
