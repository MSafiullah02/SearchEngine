A dataset of more than 600,000 tweets with hashtags like #COVID and #coronavirus posted between February 27, 2020 and March 25, 2020 was built. An exploratory treatment of the number of tweets posted by country, by language and other parameters revealed an overview of the apprehension of the pandemic around the world. A sentiment analysis was elaborated on the basis of the tweets posted in English because these constitute the great majority (USA, GB, India\u2026). On the other hand, the FP-Growth algorithm was adapted to the tweets in order to discover the most frequent patterns and its derived association rules, in order to highlight the tweeters insights relatively to COVID-19.",

            "text": "Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was first detected in Wuhan, China, in December 2019 and has spread worldwide in more than 198 countries. Within a couple of months, this outbreak has upset the world and uncertainties about the future were for the first time evoked. Several epidemic periods have been observed in the world. In the recent years, this epidemics phenomenon has grown because of the contagion favored by the globalization. Nowadays, epidemics provoke extreme economic crisis at the scale of countries as well at the individual level. People can reach psychosis symptoms because of the contagion and countries may suffer from economic crisis due to people traveling restriction and social isolation. In [8] , the authors give several battle hints to fight the virus as it travels the world, the metaphor of war is used. Doctors and people the most affected psychologically by the epidemics are the most likely to talk about it on social networks like Twitter, which have become essential in our daily lives. The analysis of internet users' behavior has shown that they are mostly either seekers of information from the Web or social media (Facebook, Twitter, microblogs\u2026) [3] , [4] , [15] . Understanding better this data flow can be of great benefit to people and the industry to make informed and focused decisions on how to meet goals. Many companies have monitoring activities on social media sites to collect information. For example, talking on social sites about a city or an airport in a positive way improves its image. One of the most popular social networks on the web is Twitter. Tweets are based on the format of micro-blogs and constitute an important source of archive data, allowing its export for academic research purposes. As part of this work, we performed a datamining study on COVID-19 by analyzing Twitter publications in relation to this disease, posted between 23 February 2020 and 03 March 2020. The outcomes could help dressing an inventory for the history of the outbreak and especially how it was apprehended by the world population. Technically, we first collected tweets in relation to the coronavirus using NodeXL and stored the recovered tweets in a dataset. In a second step, the data underwent a preprocessing with a statistical analysis in order to extract knowledge helping their understanding. Thereafter we conducted a sentiment analysis on the dataset to come up with the feelings of the twitters during the period of study. In addition to this effort, the most frequent patterns were extracted with the aim to grasp social features about the twitters. Among the datamining algorithms that can handle such issue, FP-Growth was selected because of its effectiveness and efficiency. The paper is organized as follows. In the next section, we present related and recent works on tweets analyses and the coronavirus. Section 3 details the approach of building the tweets dataset. Section 4 describes the the sentiment analysis algorithm we designed as well as its empirical results. Section 5 presents the adaptation of FP-Growth algorithm to tweets and the experimental results prior to conclude the main contributions.",

AFINN computes a score from the range [-5,5] to each word and deducts the positive sentiment if the score is positive and the negative sentiment otherwise. Bing assigns straightly a positive or a negative sentiment to each word. NRC considers ten categories of sentiments, which are positive, negative, anger, anticipation, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise, and trust and assigns to each word at least one of these categories. We chose the NRC lexicon as it provides specific sentiments other than positive and negative. This lexicon contains 6468 words distributed over the ten categories.

Meanwhile, the inverted file of the NRC is built and converted to a hash table. Initially each category is affected a count set to 0. Then the process considers the words one by one and calculates its hash key to access to the index that contains the address of the word in the lexicon. Once identifying the entry of the lexicon inverted file containing the word, it captures the categories and increments the count of each of them. Once the process is completed, the score for each category is computed as the ratio of its corresponding count over the total number of words. Figure 9 shows the results achieved by the execution of the algorithm, that illustrate the tone of the tweets captured by the sentiment analysis. We observe that the negative sentiment has a score slightly greater than that of the positive. Fear has an important score whereas joy and disgust have the lowest.

We notice that the negative sentiment was high in the beginning of the period then it knew a little increase in the second week and since then it is decreasing in an important degree.

Fear has almost the same evolution as the negative sentiment but with less magnitude whereas trust behaves as the positive sentiment with less importance.

Similarly, the pair of words the most frequent appear in Table 4 , which shows at the same time examples of association rules ordered with respect to the minimum support on the total number of patterns equal to 19560. These rules are impressively similar to those of the daily life during the pandemic. For instance, the rule wash hand has the highest confidence, which corresponds exactly to what we hear many times a day. Table 4 . Examples of generated association rules with 2 frequent patterns Table 5 and Table 6 show the association rules identified by the algorithm for respectively the 3 and 4 most frequent patterns with a low support but a significant confidence. These rules are also eloquent relatively to what people are living these days.

Twitter was selected to undertake the study because of the credibility of its users and also the ease of extracting the tweets. As a first contribution, a dataset of 653 996 tweets was extracted using NodeXL and preprocessed in order to highlight useful insights. As a second contribution, an exploratory study on the collection of tweets was carried out to yield descriptive statistics. A sentiment analysis study followed and interesting results were discussed. Data Mining technologies were afterwards exploited and the FP-Growth algorithm was especially adapted to the tweets dataset in order to discover the most frequent patterns in an effective and efficient way. The derived association rules highlight our understanding on the tweeters communicating on the COVID-19. The global results were impressive and can enrich the information forecasted by the traditional media.",
