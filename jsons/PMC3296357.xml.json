To make use of this machinery while avoiding detection, viruses have evolved a number of unconventional translational strategies (Gale et al, 2000), including internal ribosome entry sites (Jang et al, 1988), leaky scanning (Schwartz et al, 1990), ribosome shunting (Schmidt-Puchta et al, 1997), reinitiation (Hemmings-Mieszczak et al, 1997), and programmed ribosomal frameshifting (PRF) (Gesteland and Atkins, 1996). Many of these strategies are unique to viruses, and thus are potential antiviral targets (Harford, 1995).",

Outside of PRF, frameshifting is a rare event, occurring fewer than 5 \u00d7 10\u22125 times per codon (Kurland, 1992). PRF can increase the occurrence of frameshifting by several orders of magnitude, depending on the slippery sequence itself as well as on the presence or absence of adjacent secondary structures that favor translational pausing and increase frameshift frequency (Gesteland and Atkins, 1996). In many instances of PRF, slippage causes the translational machinery to bypass a stop codon just downstream of the slippery sequence, resulting in the expression of an elongated protein (Gesteland and Atkins, 1996). Therefore, normal expression from these transcripts results in two products, a shorter product based on the initial translation frame plus a longer product, whose ratio depends on the frequency of slippage and is thought to have evolved to a value optimized for virus production (Shehu-Xhilaga et al, 2001; Dulude et al, 2006).",

For example, in HIV, the Gag to Gag-Pol expression ratio is regulated by PRF and is necessary for the proper loading of reverse transcriptase into the new viral capsids; disturbing this ratio can inhibit viral replication (Shehu-Xhilaga et al, 2001; Dulude et al, 2006). The role of PRF in the SARS life cycle is less clear, but is necessary for expression of its RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (Plant et al, 2010). In Escherichia coli bacteriophage lambda, PRF regulates the expression of proteins gpG and gpGT (Levin et al, 1993). As lambda phage genes G and T lie between its major tail gene (V) and its tape measure gene (H), they are thought to have a role in tail formation (Xu, 2001). However, proteins gpG and gpGT do not make up any of the final tail structure (Levin et al, 1993), and thus may act as chaperones or scaffolds for gpH, assisting in the assembly of the tail shaft around the tape measure protein (Xu, 2001).",

            "text": "Reading-frame maintenance is a common function of tRNA modifications (Urbonavicius et al, 2001). tRNAs contain upwards of 80 known modified nucleosides (Limbach et al, 1994), and many of these are strongly conserved across species (Sprinzl and Vassilenko, 2005). However, their loss is generally not lethal (Alexandrov et al, 2006; Phizicky and Hopper, 2010). In E. coli, four tRNA modifications require the addition of a thiol moiety and are made via two functionally distinct mechanisms (Nilsson et al, 2002). The first mechanism requires proteins that contain iron-sulfur (Fe-S) clusters and includes 2-thiocytidine formation at position 32 and methylthio formation of ms2i6A at position 37 (Jager et al, 2004; Pierrel et al, 2004). The second mechanism is independent of Fe-S clusters and includes 4-thiouridine at position 8 and 2-thiouridine at position 34 (Ikeuchi et al, 2006). For each of these modifications, sulfur is sequestered by E. coli's primary cysteine desulfurase, IscS. Sulfur is then used for one of these four tRNA modifications or for Fe-S cluster biosynthesis. In addition to their roles in tRNA modification, Fe-S clusters are critical cofactors involved in many cellular processes including respiration, central metabolism, environmental sensing, RNA modification, DNA repair, and DNA replication (Py and Barras, 2010).",

We were particularly intrigued by the possibility that these pathways interact. Furthermore, the substantial evolutionary conservation of both host genes and viral PRF mechanism strongly suggested that our observations would have relevance beyond E. coli and lambda phage. Our current observations shed light on a complex network that extends from host metabolism and tRNA modification to viral translational regulation and finally to virion production. We find that 2-thiouridine hypomodification of tRNALys/Glu/Gln causes increased translational frameshifting, changing the ratio of the critical lambda phage proteins gpG and gpGT. We also show that IscU is linked to gpG and gpGT expression by competitive inhibition of the TUS pathway. Knocking out core members of the ISC pathway increases lambda phage replication by relieving competition for sulfur, allowing the TUS pathway to increase the rates of 2-thiouridine formation, thus reducing frameshifting. Targeting tRNA modifications to alter frameshifting rates, to which viral structural proteins are likely to be uniquely sensitive, presents a novel antiviral strategy.",

We began our investigation by examining the impact of other known ISC and TUS pathway members on lambda phage replication (Figure 3A; see Supplementary Figure 1 for line plots of individual replicates). First, we investigated the effect on lambda phage replication of several genes associated with Fe-S cluster biosynthesis. We performed infection time courses of \u0394iscU and other strains deficient in members of the iscRSUA-hscBA-fdx-iscX operon (hscA, hscB, iscA, iscR, fdx, and iscX). The slow growth of the iscS deletion strain made it impossible to assess infection dynamics and was not included in the analysis. The \u0394iscU, \u0394hscA, and \u0394hscB strains all exhibited very similar infection dynamics, clearing the culture significantly before WT (Figure 3A, top row; Figure 3B). IscU is the primary scaffolding protein used for Fe-S cluster biosynthesis (Urbina et al, 2001), and HscA and HscB are accessory proteins that help transfer Fe-S clusters to apoproteins (Bonomi et al, 2008) The \u0394iscA strain exhibited increased replication efficiency, but less than the hscA, hscB, and iscU gene deletions (Figure 3A and B). IscA assists in Fe-S cluster biosynthesis by shuttling iron to IscU (Yang et al, 2006).",

Interestingly, lambda phage replication is slightly but significantly hindered in the iscR knockout strain (Figure 3A and B).

Strains lacking either of these genes showed no effect on lambda infection dynamics (Figure 3A, bottom; Figure 3C). In contrast, deletion strains for the two Fe-S cluster-independent tRNA thiolation enzymes ThiI and MnmA displayed a significant increase in viral resistance versus the WT strain (Figure 3A, bottom; Figure 3C). Sulfur is transferred to ThiI through direct binding of IscS (Kambampati and Lauhon, 2000), and ThiI then transfers the sulfur to s4U8 of tRNAPhe.

To test this hypothesis, we generated infection curves for several deletion mutants that have been shown to affect frameshifting by loss of tRNA modification, including tgt, truA, miaA, thiI, and mnmE (Urbonavicius et al, 2001). We infected deletion strains for these genes with lambda phage and determined their susceptibility to infection (Figure 4; see Supplementary Figure 2 for line plots of individual replicates). \u0394tgt, \u0394miaA, and \u0394truA exhibited no significant affect on lambda phage replication, suggesting that the tRNA modifications from these enzymes have no role in lambda phage replication. The remaining knockout strains displayed significant changes in lambda phage's ability to infect the host, including \u0394thiI, \u0394mnmA (Figures 3 and 4), and \u0394mnmE (Figure 4). Intriguingly, MnmE performs a methylaminomethyl modification on carbon 5 of the same tRNA species and nucleoside targeted by MnmA (Elseviers et al, 1984), suggesting that the antiviral properties of the TUS pathway knockouts may be due to specific tRNA modifications instead of to general translational fidelity issues.",

Lambda phage encodes lysine 748 times (65% AAA and 35% AAG), glutamic acid 900 times (57% GAA and 43% GAG), and glutamine 576 times (20% CAA and 80% CAG), with similar biases in E. coli (Table II).

In the 0 ORF, which is maintained \u223c96% of the time, gpG is expressed (Figure 5A); and in the remaining cases, the ribosomal machinery reaches the slippery sequence and slips back one base pair. As a result, the stop codon for gpG, immediately downstream of the slippery sequence, is bypassed and the larger gpGT product is produced. Interestingly, both the lysine codons TTG (0 ORF) and TTT (\u22121 ORF) are decoded by the same tRNALys (UUU), a target of MnmA and MnmE.

Superposition of the IscU and TusA structures indicated a spatial overlap between the volume occupied by TusA and IscU when bound to IscS. Furthermore, three-way pull-down experiments demonstrated that IscS may bind either TusA or IscU individually, but not both at the same time (Shi et al, 2010). To further explore the possibility that thiolation of tRNALys (UUU) is affected by competition between TusA and IscU for sulfur transfer from IscS, we constructed a mathematical model of IscU and TusA binding to IscS (Figure 6A). Our model consisted of a set of equilibrium and mass conservation relationships. In this case, the model parameters had either been previously measured or were not difficult to estimate based on existing data (Urbina et al, 2001; Taniguchi et al, 2010).

To integrate these two models, we related U34 thiolation (the output of the protein binding model) to the burst size (input for our infection model). We were thus able to explore the effect of changing the IscU or TusA concentration on the production of functional phage and the resulting infection time course. We first tested the integrated model's ability to predict the outcome of deleting iscU or tusA, and in both cases the model was able to capture the infection time course (Figure 6B\u2013E; see Supplementary Figure 4 for line plots of individual replicates). We also considered titration of IscU experimentally as well as computationally by introducing an IPTG-inducible iscU gene construct into a \u0394iscU strain and determining the infection time courses under various IPTG concentrations. The effect of IscU titration was predicted well by our competitive inhibition model (Figure 6F and G; see Supplementary Figure 4 for line plots of individual replicates).",

We found a small fraction of hypomodified tRNALys in BW25113, and as predicted by the competitive inhibition model, loss of IscU in the \u0394iscU strain decreased this fraction even further.

TusA obtains sulfur from the cysteine desulfurase IscS, and passes it along the TUS pathway for eventual modification of tRNALys(UUU) at U34. The fraction of tRNALys(UUU) that undergoes this modification influences the frequency of PRF in lambda phage due to its role in decoding part of the slippery sequence within its GT region. Although lambda phage requires both gpG and gpGT for normal replication, the gpG:gpGT ratio must be kept high. Deletion of any member of the TUS pathway prevents modification of tRNALys(UUU), and subsequently increases frameshifting, both decreasing the gpG:gpGT ratio and lambda phage production.",

When IscU, HscA, HscB, or IscA is removed from the system, TusA obtains more sulfur than normal, leading to hypermodification of tRNALys(UUU), a decrease in frameshifting, and increases in the gpG:gpGT ratio and lambda phage production. Previous investigations in B. subtilis reported that disrupting the function of IscU affects several levels of tRNA modifications, including an increase in 2-thiolation of U34 (Leipuviene et al, 2004); our observations suggest that in the case of tRNALys(UUU), this effect is a result of an increase of sulfur flux through the TUS pathway (Figures 5C, 6K, and 7). Removal of the transcriptional repressor IscR leads to an increase in protein production from the ISC operon (Schwartz et al, 2001), reducing the amount of sulfur available to TusA. This competition effect depends on an intact TUS pathway, which is why the \u0394tusA\u0394iscU deletion mutant expresses a phenotype similar to the \u0394tusA strain.",

ThiI would seem to be another possible competitor for sulfur from IscS (Figure 2A). However, the \u0394thiI strain exhibited decreased lambda replication, albeit somewhat less strongly than the TUS pathway deletion strains. One clue to this mystery may reside with the CyaY protein, which is thought to be an iron donor for Fe-S cluster assembly, forming a ternary complex with IscU and IscS (Shi et al, 2010). The binding site for ThiI on IscS overlaps substantially with CyaY (Shi et al, 2010), and it is conceivable that in the absence of ThiI, CyaY is able to interact more efficiently with IscU, either stabilizing the IscS-IscU-CyaY complex or assisting sulfur transfer to IscU. In either case, deleting thiI may increase IscU's ability to compete with TusA for sulfur.",

Indeed, frameshifting has already been identified as a potential target in HIV, but efforts to target the gag-pol mRNA secondary structure have been challenging (Hung et al, 1998). Our results point to upstream (e.g., tRNA modifying enzymes) and even indirect targets (e.g., Fe-S cluster biosynthesis pathways), which can just as potently alter infection and in some cases are tunable (Figure 6G). We therefore anticipate that our observations and inferences may have broad relevance to understanding other infections, including viral infection of humans.",
