There was no minimum time frame between subsequent episodes, but we used chart reviews to confirm these were distinct episodes.

The MoSAIC study performs prospective community-based surveillance for acute respiratory illness (ARI) using text messaging. Households in the MoSAIC study were selected using a random sample of participants who were previously enrolled in a large, community-based survey (https://www.dbmi.columbia.edu/impact/wicer/, last accessed: April 14, 2017). Households receive twice-weekly text messages inquiring if any members have ARI symptoms, and ill individuals are swabbed in their homes by research staff if they had 2 of the following: fever/feverishness, cough, pharyngitis, rhinorrhea/nasal congestion, and body aches. Children less than 1 year of age meet criteria for swabbing if they have rhinorrhea/congestion only. Swabs were not collected if subjects refused collection or if they were no longer symptomatic at the time of collection.",

The proportion of children receiving respiratory support and/or admitted to the PICU was similar among the HCoV types (P = .9). The median hospital length of stay was 11 days (mean, 17.1 days) for those admitted to the PICU and 3 days (mean, 4.8 days) for those not admitted to the PICU. A similar proportion of those with (n = 58) and without (n = 154) viral codetections received respiratory support (10 of 58 [17.2%] vs 29 of 154 [18.8%], P = .79) and/or were admitted to the PICU (9 of 58 [15.5%] vs 15 of 154 [9.7%], P = .23), as shown in (Table 4).",

Seasonal trends as well as the distribution of 4 HCoV types were similar in the community and hospitalized group; OC43 was most common followed by NL63 in both settings. This is similar to findings from other studies conducted in children in the community or the hospital [15\u201317].

The findings from the community cohort may not be generalizable because this population was largely Latino/Hispanic and under active surveillance for respiratory illnesses. Findings from our hospital sample are likely to reflect referral center bias because CUMC is a tertiary pediatric care center, and, as such, there is an overrepresentation of children with CCCs. Collection of nasal swabs for the community surveillance component of the study versus nasopharyngeal swabs in the hospital could have impacted viral detection. We did not capture healthcare-acquired infections, and we could have missed additional HCoV detections [22]. We collected symptoms differently in the 2 groups; symptoms in the community cohort were reported by the participants, whereas symptoms in hospitalized children were extracted from the medical records. Subjective symptoms may have been underreported for younger children in the community cohort leading to bias. Due to the small sample, our analysis did not assess the impact of specific types of viral codetections or bacterial coinfections with Mycoplasma, Bordetella, or Chlamydophila pneumoniae. Although testing was done only for symptomatic individuals in this study, respiratory infections could have been incidental to the reason a child was hospitalized. We most likely did not accurately determine the percentage of children with asymptomatic shedding of HCoV compared with those for whom HCoV was the primary cause of their symptoms. There could also have been other confounding conditions, eg, presence of bacterial superinfection, which contributed to the clinical picture that were not assessed. We lacked healthy controls with which to compare our cohorts. Finally, our analysis was limited by relatively few cases with increased severity of illness.",

Children less than 2 years of age and those with CCCs were at risk of increased severity of illness. Clinical manifestations and severity of illness were similar among the 4 HCoV types studied. In this study, we demonstrated that coronaviruses were detected in a significant proportion of children in both community and hospital settings and could be a contributor to clinically significant respiratory illnesses.
