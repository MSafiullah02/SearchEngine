Olsen et al. (2003) reported the transmission of SARS on an aircraft by interviewing passengers and crew members who were on the spot and noted that passengers who were seated in the same row with the index patient had higher risk. Especially, higher number of infected passengers seated in front of the index patient than behind him possibly implied the airborne transmission through respiratory activities such as coughing and sneezing. Efficiency of respiratory transmission of H1N1 virus was tested by conducting animal experiments using ferrets (Maines et al., 2009, Munster et al., 2009, Perez et al., 2009). Prediction on the transmission airborne contaminants including SARS inside an enclosed space such as an airliner cabin (Mazumdar and Chen, 2009) and a hospital ward (Qian et al., 2009) have been made, providing a reasonable prediction for applications when the infection occurred and the virus was transmitted to a person staying at the same location in an enclosed space.",

            "text": "Airborne transmission refers to the passage of microorganisms from a source to a person through aerosols, causing possible illness of the person in consequence of infection. Aerosolized disease transmission can be classified into two groups (Gralton et al., 2011); one is the droplet transmission, which is defined as disease transmission through the expelled particles that are likely to settle down quickly due to their size. The other is aerosol transmission, which is defined as disease transmission through the expelled particles that range relatively smaller in size. Such aerosols can be transmitted over short and long distances. Short-range transmission occurs across the short distance (less than 1 m) from person to person and can be moderated by using of personal protective equipment such as gloves and facemasks with precautions to avoid the usual contact transmission from touching of the eyes, nose and mouth. Long range transmission occurs between distant locations and is primarily governed by air flows generated from ventilation systems or movement of people (Tang et al., 2006). Wang and Chow (2011) reported that human walking disturbs the local velocity field influencing the droplet dispersion and the increase of walking speed could effectively cut down the number of suspended droplets ranged 0.5\u201320 \u03bcm.",

Morawska et al. (2009) showed that evaporation to the equilibrium droplet size occurred within 0.8 s for particles between 0.5 and 20 \u03bcm. Redrow et al. (2011) also demonstrated that a 10 \u03bcm sputum droplet evaporated to become a droplet nucleus (3.5 \u03bcm) in 0.55 s at 80% RH. According to Chao et al. (2009), the geometric mean diameter of the droplets expelled from human activities such as coughing and speaking was 13.5 \u03bcm and 16.0 \u03bcm, respectively, thus they are likely to remain airborne in the indoor air flow after the complete evaporation. Duguid (1946) also demonstrated that respiratory droplets were small enough to remain airborne agreeing with above results.",

            "text": "To predict the evaporation, dispersion, and transport of respiratory droplets in indoor environment using computational fluid dynamics, boundary conditions such as air jet velocity are necessary for the CFD simulations. Gupta et al., 2009, Gupta et al., 2010 reported thermo-boundary conditions such as the flow rate, flow direction, and mouth opening area of 25 human subjects for a CFD simulation of coughing, breathing, and talking. Zhu et al. (2006) measured the velocity distribution around the mouth of the three subjects and reported that the exhaled air velocity ranged between 6 and 22 m/s with the average velocity of 11.2 m/s. According to the result, when the maximum velocity of the coughed airflow was 22 m/s, the expelled saliva droplets flew 2 m or longer. Chao et al. (2009) found from measurements that the average expiration air velocity was 11.7 m/s for coughing and 3.9 m/s for speaking. Reliable information on the boundary condition is needed since the simulation results can differ depending on the input condition. Zhao et al. (2005) considered different outlet velocities (20 and 100 m/s) from mouth to simulate the sneezing or coughing process and found that higher coughing velocity will bring on further transport and higher concentration of the exhaled particles.",

The location of atomized particles resulting from the effect of light scattering was detected using a digital camera (TSI 630057). The sequential two PIV images obtained from a synchronizer (TSI 610035) and a PC were analyzed into a velocity vector by tracking the pathway of the atomized particles. The tested people were instructed to cough or speak in a certain protocol on a side of rectangular chamber made of transparent acryl with a dimension of 500 mm width, 500 mm height and 1500 mm length.

The velocity vector was captured at each 70 ms as shown in Fig. 2. For all 26 tested persons, 9 shots of velocity vectors for 560 ms were captured from each cough. Of these, three or four continuous shots showing the highest velocity distribution were assumed to be the initial velocity of the exhaled air from coughing.

The velocity at 0.5\u20131 m/s is most frequently observed possibly due to the addition of velocity vector from surrounding air, and hence, the maximum velocity of the exhaled air from coughing possibly ranges between 6 and 13 m/s.",

Each u and v velocity averaged from three times cough data was analyzed for all ranges and the sections that showed the highest velocity were selected. The selected velocity was averaged for all tested males and females separately and is shown in Fig. 4\n. In the case of the males, the maximum u of the exhaled airflow from coughing was 14.4 m/s, while v was 5.2 m/s upward and \u22124.7 m/s downward. In the case of females, u was 10.1 m/s, while v was 2.7 m/s upward and \u22123.1 m/s downward. The coughing velocity vector combining u and v was 15.4 m/s (15.2 m/s downward) in the case of males, and the females showed around 70% of that of the males. The result is around 10% higher than the average air velocity (11.7 m/s) for both males and females observed by Chao et al. (2009). The angle of the upward vector and downward vector was 19.9\u00b0 and 17.9\u00b0 for the males and 15\u00b0 and 17.3\u00b0 for the females, respectively. From the mouth, the angle of the coughed airflow was around 38\u00b0 for the males and 32\u00b0 for the females. The result is somewhat lower than the measured average angle (55\u00b0) reported by Gupta et al. (2009).",

Applying the same procedure as with the coughs, the maximum velocity distribution of the exhaled air when dul was pronounced was acquired and as shown in Fig. 5\n. The velocity vector for the males was 4.11 m/s upward and 4.03 downward, while that for the females was 2.34 m/s upward and 2.28 m/s downward.

In this study, the relation between the horizontal velocity of the exhaled air from coughing and the subject\u2019s height that is known to be related with their lung capacity (Morris et al., 1971) was analyzed regardless of gender. As shown in Fig. 6\n, the coughing velocity was higher when the test subject was taller. However, the linear relation was weak (R\n2\n = 0.510). The lowest coughing velocity was shown for a female who was 1.58 m tall and weighed 42 kg (F7), while the highest coughing velocity was appeared for a male who was 1.8 m tall and weighed 70 kg (M9). The results with speech also showed similar patterns. The comparison of the horizontal velocity of the exhaled air indicated that the speaking velocity increased with the height of the person.",

Contagious substances as droplets or particles are likely to be expelled from coughing or speaking, and thus the physical data of the exhaled particles is important in analyzing the air-borne path of the viruses. Accurately analyzing the initial velocity distribution is particularly important in the study of the fluid dynamics property of the respiratory particles through numerical analysis. This study used a PIV system to analyze the initial velocity of the exhaled air from coughing and speaking of 17 males and 9 females. Each person repeated coughing or speaking in a certain protocol, and the exhalation velocity distribution was measured. From the measurement data, the initial coughing velocity was calculated. The results indicated that the average initial coughing velocity was 15.3 m/s for the males and 10.6 m/s for the females. The angle of the coughed air was around 38\u00b0 for the males and 32\u00b0 for the females. It may be difficult to generalize the case of speech since the test result was limited to the pronouncing of a certain word \u2018dul\u2019. Still, the result indicated that the speaking velocity was about 22\u201327% of coughing velocity and the angle of the exhaled air from speaking was larger for the females than the males. The comparison of the test subject\u2019s height with their coughing and speaking indicated a linear relation. The coughing velocity was higher when the test subject was taller.",
