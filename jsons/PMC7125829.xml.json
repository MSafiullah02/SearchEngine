In developing a response plan to minimize socio-economic losses in disease outbreak, it is important to predict the transmission dynamics of an infectious disease, to compare the effects of different control strategies, and to design the best strategy. The World Health Organization(WHO) issued warning of pandemic influenza and encouraged to prepare countermeasures in 1999, but it did not draw much attention until the emergence of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome(SARS) in 2002\u20132003. Since the first SARS case was reported from Canton, China on December 2002, more than 31 countries worldwide reported 7956 confirmed cases including 666 fatal cases to the WHO by the end of 21 May, 2003. The SARS aroused great interest in the use of mathematical models to predict the course of the epidemic and to evaluate various management strategies  [1]. This interest triggered studies for investigating the dynamics and control of infectious diseases and has been reinforced by the treatment of a pandemic including the influenza A(H1N1) 2009  [2].",

The optimization of vaccination policies before their implementation is essential to better allocate resources and to minimize disease burdens. Recent advances have been made in optimizing vaccine distribution policies in specific settings  [3], [4], [5]. Several studies have applied optimal control techniques to determine immunization strategies  [6], [7]. However, it is still complicated and controversial to address the best possible strategies because the dynamics of epidemics and the optimal use of vaccines depend on various factors including the structure of the population, vaccine availability, and transmissibility levels. In this context, we take into account of the size and heterogeneous dynamics of groups, different transmission levels, the total and daily maximum amount of vaccines available, and time delays in vaccine implementation.",

The cumulative proportion vaccinated per month in each subgroup using different vaccination strategies are depicted in Fig. 2A2\u2013C2. Under the optimal vaccination, control efforts are gradually decreasing in time. Vaccination is highly concentrated in the early stage of epidemic for early possible strategy and the vaccinated proportion stays constant over the time for uniform distribution. A larger fraction is vaccinated in the higher contact group compared to the lower contact group under the optimal strategy. In contrast, the number of individuals vaccinated in each subgroup is proportional to the size of subgroup for both early possible and uniform strategy, or the proportion vaccinated in each subgroup is kept the same. This is because neither of them reflects the heterogeneous mixing rates to determine the vaccination schedule. Fig. 2A3\u2013C3 demonstrate that the implementation of control measures yields substantial reductions in the peak size of infections while generating shifted, longer pandemic durations. The reduction of cumulative number of infectives relative to the case without intervention are approximately 68.2%, 59%, 45.5% under optimal, early possible, and uniform distribution, respectively (Fig. 2A4\u2013C4). This result proposes that control measures may be optimally targeted to minimize the number of cases for a given control effort.",

Our findings suggest that more intensive vaccination must be implemented in the early stage on the targeted group as the gap of contact rates between two subgroups grows (Fig. 3A2\u2013C2). As a result, for a11=10, infectives are significantly reduced by 80.1% compared to early possible vaccination by 51.3% and uniform distribution by 31.8% (Fig. 3C4).

Incidence curves of infected proportions are shown in Fig. 6A2\u2013C2 and higher values of R0 generate earlier epidemic peaks with higher and narrower in shape.

We also analyse the threshold value of maximum daily vaccination as a function of vaccination coverage and R0 in terms of reduction of infected individuals.

As vaccination coverage increases, the number of infected individuals decreases, resulting in an increase in the reductions of infected. However, with long time delay and large vaccination coverage, the whole coverage is not distributed due to the lack of implementation period. For instance, if vaccination starts 60 days after the beginning of the transmission, only 39% coverage is allocated when 50% vaccination coverage is allowed. Not surprisingly, 50% coverage and 25% coverage lead to the same results in cumulative number of vaccinated and the reductions of infectives with 90 days of delay. The optimal vaccination coverage as a function of time delay is presented in Fig. 13\n.",

Thus, it is great interest to develop an efficient time schedule and prioritization of limited vaccine supplies. This study uses a mathematical model of the transmission dynamics of pandemic influenza and employs techniques from control theory to derive optimal intervention strategies. Time-dependent vaccination is computed and analysed using a model incorporating heterogeneity in population structure under different settings of transmissibility levels, vaccine coverages, and time delays in the implementation of vaccination. Vaccination coverage and the maximum daily vaccination rate are critical factors in developing response plans for disease outbreaks. These are parameters with limited values and associate with weight constants and a control upper bound in optimal control formulation of previous studies. In our mathematical framework, mixed constrained optimization problem is considered to reflect realistic restrictions.",

Our analysis confirms that more intensive control measures must be implemented in the early stage on the group with higher contact, in general. However, the targeted group is switched to the one with more population, as the gap of contact rates between two groups diminishes, which suggests that prioritization strategy should be tailored. Higher values of R0 requires rapid implementation of optimal control policies with more concern on the group with big population. While the reduction of infected significantly decreases as the vaccination coverage decreases, prioritization schemes on subgroups remain similar with changes in total number of vaccine doses available. Finally, the benefit of vaccination is significantly reduced as the time of the start of vaccination from pandemic onset is delayed.",
