Traditionally, we introduce three right handed neutrinos to cancel the [U (1) B\u2212L ] 3 anomaly. However, it suffices to introduce two heavy right-handed neutrinos for these purposes and therefore we can replace one right-handed neutrino by new chiral fermions to cancel the U (1) B\u2212L gauge anomaly. Then, one of the chiral fermions can naturally play a role of a dark matter candidate. In this paper, we demonstrate how this framework produces a dark matter candidate which can address the so-called \"core-cusp problem\". As one of the small scale problems that \u039bCDM paradigm encounters, it may imply an important clue for a nature of dark matter. One of resolutions among many is hypothesizing that sub-keV fermion dark matter halos in dwarf spheroidal galaxies are in (quasi) degenerate configuration. We show how the degenerate sub-keV fermion dark matter candidate can be non-thermally originated in our model and thus can be consistent with Lyman-\u03b1 forest observation. Thereby, the small neutrino mass, baryon asymmetry, and the sub-keV dark matter become consequences of the broken B-L gauge symmetry. *",

The central questions in regard to DM concern a mass of DM, non-gravitational interaction DM does, and its stability. Answers to these questions are considered essential factors in understanding not only a history and structure of the Universe in cosmology, but also a bigger and more fundamental picture lying behind the Standard model (SM) in particle physics. Seen from the perspective of this kind, DM related-observational anomalies reported in the study of cosmology and astrophysics could serve as a critical hint for physics beyond the Standard Model (BSM) although it is not necessary.",

            "text": "Relying on predicted phenomenological consequences arising from a specific mass or non-gravitational interaction that DM enjoys, several alternative frameworks to CDM have been suggested so far in an effort to address the core-cusp problem (and other small-scale issues as well). These include warm dark matter (WDM) 1 [13, 14, 21] , ultra-light bosonic DM [22, 23, 24] 2 and self-interacting DM (SIDM) 3 [27] . 1 Warm dark matter is assuming a DM particle characterized by a small enough mass to produce a freestreaming length of O(0.1)Mpc and also by non-zero velocity dispersion. This feature enables WDM to erase density perturbations for the scale smaller than its free-streaming length, and thereby suppression of matter power spectrum on small scale and of formation of sub-halos is induced in comparison to CDM case [13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18] . As for the core size of a dwarf galaxy, WDM N-body simulations were conducted to study how the primordial velocity dispersion of WDM affects the inner structure of DM halo in [19, 20] . In particular, sub-keV WDM is shown to produce the halo core size of O(100)pc for a typical sub-halo mass of Milky way whereas WDM with 1 \u2212 2keV mass does the core of 10-50pc [20] . 2 The quantum pressure of the ultra-light bosonic dark matter supported by Heisenberg's uncertainty principle can help the self-gravitating system achieve stability against gravitational collapse. 3 The self-interaction helps efficient heat conduction from the outer more energetic DM particles to the inner colder ones, which leads to redistribution of energy and angular momentum of DM particles. Consequently, as was shown in relevant simulations [25, 26] , the central halo becomes less dense compared Another interesting possibility of DM resulting in a cored halo profile in a low mass galaxy is the fermion DM in the quantum degenerate limit. Along the similar line, the hypothesis of the fermion DM as the self-gravitating (quasi) degenerate gas was invoked in [28, 29, 30, 31, 32] to explain the kinematics of dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSphs). The fitting procedures for the kinematic data (stellar velocity dispersion and halo radius of dSphs) yielded sub-keV mass regime as the possible fermion DM mass (See also Refs. [33, 34, 35, 36] for more studies about sub-keV fermion DM). Because of this, sub-keV fermion DM can serve as a class of solution to the core-cusp problem if it resides in dSphs nowadays with sufficiently low temperature so as to sit in the (quasi) degenerate state. This sub-keV mass regime encounters a severe constraint from the Lyman-\u03b1 forest (see, e.g. [37, 38, 39] ), but the solution can still be viable provided that the sub-keV fermion DM is non-thermally originated and the free-streaming length of DM is not too large to be consistent with constraints derived from the Lyman-\u03b1 flux power spectrum. The free-streaming length range 0.3Mpc < \u03bb FS < 0.5Mpc of DM would be of interest since it can be consistent with non-vanishing matter power spectrum at large scales and avoid too many satellites of Milky way size halo [40, 41, 14, 28] .",

On top of SM particle contents, in its minimal form, the model contains two heavy right handed neutrinos (N i=1,2 ) and a complex scalar (\u03a6) for breaking U (1) B\u2212L .

Now for the purpose of making the theory anomaly-free and accommodating a non-thermal sub-keV fermion DM candidate, more chiral fermions are added to the model.

The advantage of extending the gauge symmetry group of SM by including the gauged U (1) B\u2212L lies in precisely this point. The theory can be naturally rendered gauge anomaly free when there exist three right-handed neutrinos with the opposite lepton number to that of active neutrinos. The other remarkable consequence that immediately follows here is that the presence of the heavy right-handed neutrinos can help us understand imbalance between baryon and anti-baryon abundance. Induced by the out-of-equilibrium decay of the right-handed neutrino, the primordial lepton asymmetry can be converted into baryon asymmetry by sphaleron transition [45] .",

In addition, we introduce one complex scalar to the model of which vacuum expectation value (VEV) causes the spontaneous breaking of U (1) B\u2212L . Via Majorana Yukawa coupling, the complex scalar imposes masses to the two right handed neutrinos on U (1) B\u2212L breaking. Of course, one is naturally tempted to make introduction of three right-handed neutrinos at the moment since it can satisfy the anomaly free condition of U (1) B\u2212L and simultaneously may be able to explain DM by taking the lightest right handed neutrino (sterile neutrino) as a candidate of the dark matter. 4 However, there is no natural and convincing reason for such a large mass disparity between the first two and the last right-handed neutrinos. Therefore, assuming only two right-handed neutrinos for the seesaw mechanism and the thermal leptogenesis, we need to find another way to accommodate DM candidate in the model. For this purpose, recalling the necessity for making the model U (1) B\u2212L anomaly free is of a great help. What could help to render U (1) B\u2212L anomaly free on behalf of the third right-handed neutrino? Looking at the anomaly free condition for U (1) B\u2212L given in Eq. (1) below, 5",

As was pointed out in the introduction, we go through the procedure to check cosmological history and free-streaming length of DM candidate in the model in order to see whether the minimal model is good enough to be consistent with cosmological constraints including Lyman-\u03b1 forest data. If not, we would gradually move to a next-to-minimal model by enlarging particle contents. From this place, since we are interested in sub-keV DM mass regime, we assume V B\u2212L (2 \u2212 3) \u00d7 10 15 GeV based on Eq. (6), which is also consistent with the observed neutrino masses. In the minimal model, the only particle that is communicating with \u03c8 8 at the renormalizable level is U (1) B\u2212L gauge boson (A \u00b5 ). Thus, the only way for \u03c8 8 to be produced is pair production resulting from scattering among the SM particles via the virtual U (1) B\u2212L gauge boson exchange. 8 The corresponding Feynman diagram is shown in Fig 1. This production, however, should proceed with \u0393(SM + SM \u2192 \u03c8 8 + \u03c8 8 ) < H at the reheating era. Otherwise, \u03c8 8 is thermalized by the SM thermal bath to become the thermal WDM which cannot have sub-keV mass regime. Thus we require For this production route which is most efficient at the reheating era, with the assumption that \u03c8 8 is identified as the sole DM component today, the DM number density to entropy density ratio reads [52] ",

Also still for some dSphs other than Fornax, the best fitting for the stellar velocity dispersion is done by m DM as large as 550-650eV [30] .

Note that this early free-streaming of \u03a6 16 is not problematic at all for the small scale perturbations since the early time free-streaming length is negligibly small.

For a given set of (m 16 , m DM , Br), each of (y * ,1 , y * ,2 , y * ,3 ) is to be determined. Define y * ,max \u2261 min(y * ,1 , y * ,2 , y * ,3 ). Then a choice of Yukawa coupling satisfying y * < y * ,max will satisfy Eq. (47) . Numerically we find that (1) for Br 10 \u22123 , y * ,max = y * ,1 for any sub-keV m DM and (2) for Br 10 \u22124 , y * ,max is either y * ,1 or y * ,3 . For a fixed m DM , \u03bb FS depends on m 16 and y * , and these two are inversely-correlated. Thus, in principle, for a fixed m DM , a set of (m 16 , y * ) satisfying \u03bb FS \u2208 (0.3, 0.5)Mpc can be readily found and consistent insofar as y * < y * ,max . In this section, instead of probing all the allowed parameter space for (m 16 , Br, y * , m DM ), for our purpose it suffices to choose a specific benchmark set of parameters (m 16 = 5 \u00d7 10 5 GeV, Br = 10 \u22126 , y * = 5 \u00d7 10 \u22126 ) to show that a degenerate sub-keV fermion DM can be produced in the model. Then we see that y * < y * ,max is satisfied. We emphasize that this example is not atypical and the following logic and consistency check can also apply for other values of parameters. The result of computation for \u03bb FS (m DM ) is shown in Fig. 5 . Interestingly, the range 0.2keV m DM 0.35keV corresponds to the criterion 0.3Mpc \u03bb FS 0.5Mpc gives the mass constraint , which lies in the range of degenerate fermion DM mass accounting for the cored DM profiles of dSphs in Refs.

The model is characterized by U (1) B\u2212L gauge symmetry, and two right-handed heavy neutrinos and four new chiral fermions added to the SM gauge sector and particle contents respectively. All the fermions in the model are charged under U (1) B\u2212L and assigned the corresponding Q B\u2212L s in a way that U (1) B\u2212L is rendered anomaly-free. It is extremely remarkable that one of the additional fermions obtains naturally a mass of O(1)keV because of its large B-L charge, provided that the B-L symmetry breaking scale \u223c 10 15 GeV. Thus, it was shown that the chiral fermion can serve as a sub-keV fermion DM candidate of which temperature today is low enough to form a degenerate fermion halo core for a dSphs. The DM's free-streaming length is small enough to be consistent with Lyman-\u03b1 forest data. Being WDM, the DM candidate in the model is also expected to resolve other small scale problems that \u039bCDM paradigm confronts (the missing satellite and too-big-to-fail problem). Consequently, the model can resolve the small scale issues in cosmology as well as the smallness of the active neutrino mass and the baryon asymmetry via the thermal leptogenesis.",

In Sec. 3, we showed that non-thermal DM produced from the SM particle scattering is bound to travel too large a free-streaming length. In Sec. 4, we showed that DM produced from a series of decays (inflaton decay and \u03a6 16 decay) as the final product can travel the right size of the free-streaming length \u223c O(0.1)Mpc to be consistent with Lyman-\u03b1 forest observation. Getting into more detail, we conducted the case study depending on whether a dark thermal bath forms (Sec. 4.1) or not (Sec. 4.2). For both cases, \u03bb FS for a fixed m DM are parametrized by (m 16 , y * ). We figure out that for a set of (m 16 , m DM ), the constraint applied to a choice of y * is more stringent for the case with formation of a dark thermal bath (Sec. 4.1) than the other case (Sec. 4.2). This fact makes it easier for the case without a dark thermal bath to produce a degenerate fermion DM consistent with the free-streaming length criterion. In Sec. 5, we studied a different mechanism to produce the degenerate fermion DM via the decay of a scalar field coherent oscillation. Differing from Sec. 4 where a positive Hubble induced mass is assumed during inflation, a negative Hubble induced mass during inflation is assumed in Sec. 5. We studied a potential of \u03a6 16 in Eq. (51) by which \u03a6 16 field is located away from the origin in the field space at the end of the inflation. For a fixed c 2 /c 8 , there is one to one map between m DM and m 16 , which is required by DM relic density matching. Taking, for example, c 2 /c 8 = 5, we showed that how the free-streaming length criterion 0.3Mpc \u03bb FS 0.5Mpc can constrain Yukawa coupling between the mother scalar field with \u223c m 16 \u2208 (10 \u22123 , 10 3 )GeV and DM candidate. For all distinct DM production mechanisms, we also performed further consistency checks including \u2206N BBN eff contributed by DM andT DM,0 < T DEG . Finally, we note that the framework presented in this paper shows that even if fermion warm DM mass is as low as sub-keV regime, it can still travel the free-streaming length as short as \u223c O(0.1)Mpc consistent with Lyman-\u03b1 forest observation thanks to the non-trivial dark sector structure and its cosmological history.",
