However, improved health worker and patient safety through reduced transmission is a compelling enough argument.

Familiarity with severe resource shortages may guide creative and innovative strategies to conserve and extend resources. Extended use of N95 masks (continuous wearing while seeing multiple patients) is preferred to limited reuse of N95 masks (doffing and redonning between patients).26 N95 mask life may be lengthened by wearing a plastic face shield or a surgical mask over it. Use of chlorine or alcohol solution to sanitize N95 masks damages mask integrity; however heating to 70\u00b0C (160\u00b0F) in a dry oven for 30 minutes seems a promising solution to disrupt viral particles and maintain mask integrity for reuse.27,28 Other innovative solutions are being proposed, as in this example from Boston Children's Hospital: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Es_iY5WJdmI. While N95 masks are superior to surgical masks in protecting against aerosolized viral particles, surgical masks still afford significant protection over no mask.29\u201331",
