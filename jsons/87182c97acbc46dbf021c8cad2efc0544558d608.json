Most countries that lack these capacities are not able to build them alone. And, even self-reported assessments of progress toward meeting these capacities suggest limited improvement. In 2014, states had the opportunity to submit requests for a second extension to the deadline for meeting these core health capacities. At that time, only 64 states reported that they had met the capacities, while 81 states requested an additional two year extension, and 48 did not provide the WHO with any information (World Health Organization 2015a, 4; see also, Fischer and Katz 2013) .

The more immediate international costs to worry about are the overreactions of other states once the outbreak is reported. Punishment for concealment comes later, if at all, and would most likely be in the form of rhetorical admonishment rather than immediate material costs.

Not only can admitting to a serious outbreak reduce public confidence in the government's ability to protect the population, but being the target of other states' trade and travel barriers can also have this effect-not to mention the real domestic economic harm that barriers can cause. All governments depend on some level of popular support to stay in office and govern effectively; they take the reaction of the public and other domestic actors into account when making policy. Governments that face strong domestic political opposition are particularly vulnerable to policy failures (Allee and Huth 2006, 225) , and so they may view outbreak reporting as a costly decision. \"Allowing\" an outbreak to occur and provoking barriers will undoubtedly not be well received by the population and can provide fodder to domestic political opposition that can be used to either remove leaders from office or simply make governing difficult. Thus, trying to get the outbreak under control before having to disclose fully the situation to domestic constituents can seem like an attractive strategy for those governments facing opposition at home. 4 At the same time, however, there are some states for which not reporting is the costlier strategy. Noncompliance with international legal commitments, and even behavior that undermines the spirit of international legal commitments, can be particularly costly for states with a high level of commitment to rule of law domestically. Domestic constituents in these states may fear that the disregard of international law could translate into the domestic sphere, or disregard of international law may cost a leader support at home simply because the population values keeping commitments (Fearon 1994; Slaughter 1995; Finnemore and Sikkink 1998; Kelley 2007; Tomz 2007) .

After the Zimbabwean government tried to conceal the extent of the outbreak, several NGOs reported it anyway and were then \"denied access [to the country] and experienced harassment in part as a result of their reporting\" (Davies 2012, 105) .

States should also use the algorithm for \"any event of potential international public health concern, including those of unknown causes or sources and those involving other events or diseases\" (World Health Organization 2005, Annex 2) .

More importantly, it is possible that the missing at random assumption required for multiple imputation does not hold in this case (King et al. 2001 ). One possibility is that the outbreaks with missing outbreak start information were more likely to occur in countries with weaker surveillance capacity. Bivariate regression of a binary variable coding whether observations had a missing outbreak start date and internet coverage show that the two are negatively correlated. This suggests that the observations left in the dataset may have generally stronger surveillance capacity. It is therefore possible that the outbreaks I examine here occur in states with stronger surveillance capacity on average, which should be the states most likely to report quickly according to the capacity perspective. To the extent that this bias exists, it should bias against finding support for my argument that intentional concealment also plays a role. As such, finding that political and economic vulnerability is associated with slower reporting even in this set of outbreaks would be strong evidence for the argument.

While at higher levels of internet coverage, a large tourism sector is associated with faster reporting, at lower levels the substantive relationship is much smaller and no longer statistically significant. Indeed, 25 percent of the outbreaks in the dataset occur in countries with lower internet coverage where the relationship between a large tourism sector and rapid reporting is not significant (the relationship is insignificant at about 0.7 users/1000 population or fewer). These findings are consistent with the argument that governments pay attention to the costs and benefits of reporting. Where the outbreak is more likely to be made public because of strong surveillance capacity, having a large tourism sector encourages governments to transparently report the outbreak rather than risk looking untrustworthy (in contrast and as expected, the negative effect of trade dependence on reporting is not conditional on surveillance capacity).

The extent of internet coverage could be a product of how transparent the state is generally-a government that is transparent and likely to report outbreaks may also be likely to have wide internet coverage. Or, in some cases, internet coverage may not actually reflect surveillance capacity, but instead could reflect the likelihood that nonstate actors might make an outbreak public and hold a government accountable for not reporting itself.

In short, in addition to the issue of weak capacity, governments also face a potential wide range of costs when deciding to report outbreaks in a timely manner. Thus, it is important that the WHO has recently emphasized outbreak preparedness and response as one of three strategic priority areas for 2019-2023 (World Health Organization 2018a, 20) . Further, the Sustainable Development Goals explicitly include meeting the IHR outbreak response capacities as an indicator under target 3.D, which aims to promote global health security (United Nations 2017).

The first set of strategies aim to lower the costs of reporting. First, effectively discouraging the imposition of trade and travel barriers that go against WHO guidance during an outbreak could reduce the anticipated costs of reporting. That so many countries have imposed excessive barriers during recent global health emergencies, with little consequence for ignoring WHO guidelines, suggests that convincing states not to do so is no easy task. The WHO, NGOs, and/or other states must at least threaten reputational costs for this behavior that goes against state commitments to the IHR. On paper, the WHO has the authority to name and shame states that disregard its recommendations, but it has not exercised this authority during recent outbreaks (Kamradt-Scott 2016, 411) . This caution is not surprising given the WHO's continued reliance on member countries for financial support and cooperation, but it is a missed opportunity to lower the costs of outbreak reporting. States and interested NGOs could fill the gap, but both have their own reasons for not wanting to name and shame countries for bad behavior. In its five-year strategic plan to improve public health preparedness and response presented at the World Health Assembly in May 2018, WHO emphasized that the organization should systematically collect and report on additional health measures imposed by states and coordinate with the World Trade Organization (WTO) to address trade-related issues during public health emergencies of international concern (World Health Organization 2018b, 8-9). Further, WHO (with the University of Sydney, New South Wales, Australia), recently launched a new tool to monitor state compliance with IHR requirements regarding additional health measures (Kamradt-Scott et al. 2018 ). These are important, and positive, developments. But, it remains to be seen how the tool will be used during a public health emergency. The structural constraints that have made WHO hesitant to criticize, let alone directly oppose, its member countries remain-and may actually intensify over time given the increasing role of voluntary contributions in the organization's budget (Graham 2017) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 816, "end": 841, "text": "(Kamradt-Scott 2016, 411)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1819, "end": 1845, "text": "(Kamradt-Scott et al. 2018", "ref_id": "BIBREF50"}, {"start": 2228, "end": 2241, "text": "(Graham 2017)", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Policy Implications and Conclusions"}, {"text": "Particularly troubling is evidence that the declaration of a public health emergency by the WHO (one of its new powers under the revised IHR), which is meant to warn and prepare the international community, might actually provoke states to impose trade and travel barriers. During the 2014 Ebola outbreak, for example, the number of states imposing travel barriers was highest immediately following the WHO's declaration that the outbreak constituted a public health emergency, and, interestingly, state behavior was not related to the severity of the outbreak (Worsnop 2017a) . In the absence of anticipated costs for disregarding WHO guidance during an outbreak, the declaration of a public health emergency signals that a serious outbreak is underway and that states should go ahead and impose restrictive border measures. This relationship may actually explain my finding that the new IHR have not had an overall positive influence on the timeliness of reporting.

The World Bank recently launched the Pandemic Emergency Financing Facility in order to make funds available to poorly resourced countries at the start of an outbreak to help with rapid response (Stein and Sridhar 2017) . There have been some implementation issues with the fund, but a mechanism should also be set up to compensate for economic losses during outbreaks. Providing some assurance of financial compensation might convince governments to report and risk the associated economic costs. This type of mechanism has been suggested before (Cash and Narasimhan 2000, 1365) and was even supported by some states during negotiations of the revised IHR in 2004 (World Health Organization 2004, 2) , yet it has neither been implemented nor seriously discussed as a policy option since then. Third, at the domestic level, countries should be encouraged to pass legislation for a local financial compensation and support scheme as a part of the IHR core capacity requirements. Disincentives to reporting also exist at the local level during an outbreak, which can then delay reporting at the national level. For example, underreporting of cases of avian flu among poultry has been suspected in China due to insufficient compensation for the culling of birds after an outbreak is made public (Kaufman 2008, S11; Huang, Wang, and Zuo 2017, 67) . The United Nations recommends compensation to encourage local reporting of avian influenza, and it has been implemented with some success in some cases of disease outbreaks among livestock and poultry, including the 2001 outbreak of foot and mouth disease in Britain (Donaldson et al. 2006; UNSIC Office 2017) . Incentives for concealment at the local level exist during outbreaks that affect humans as well. Local officials and family members may conceal cases because of the sometimes draconian public health measures that are adopted in response. For example, Liberia's West Point neighborhood in the capital Monrovia was sealed off by the government during the Ebola outbreak and the community was isolated from needed food and other supplies (Onishi 2014 ).

Another option is to raise the costs of not reporting. The WHO could name and shame states that delay reporting.

A more promising strategy would be to incorporate domestic legal protections for nonstate actors that independently report outbreaks into the IHR core capacity requirements.

Other possibilities exist as well, including that certain types of diseases may be harder to surveil and thus may be less likely to have a recorded start date. Furthermore, the outbreaks verified by the WHO only represent a subset of outbreaks that actually occur.
