For three decades, gorilla trekkers have stepped into a breathtakingly beautiful African landscape, steeped in human and gorilla blood. Gorilla lives and deaths have been played out against a backdrop of human war, genocide, poverty, and disease, seemingly unnoticed by the international community at large (Stanford, 2001; Weber and Vedder, 2001). During these 30 years, global international tourist arrivals per year have increased by about 500 million (World Tourism Organization, 2000), and more than 30 new diseases have emerged (World Health Organization, 2002). Ebola hemorrhagic fever decimates gorilla populations in western equatorial Africa (Walsh et al., 2003), and the rapid global spread of SARS coronavirus, shows how easily new diseases may be spread by international (air) travelers (World Health Organization, 2003a).",

The intervening years have seen these early sites devastated by regional conflicts, with two fledgling Ugandan sites emerging as the premiere gorilla tourism sites (Litchfield, 2001a). New western lowland gorilla (Gorilla gorilla gorilla; Meder and Groves, 2005) tourism sites have sprung up in Central African Republic, Gabon, Congo-Brazzaville, Cameroon, and equatorial Guinea (Aveling, 1999; Blom, 2001a; Djoh and van der Wal, 2001). Only the rare Cross River gorillas (Gorilla gorilla diehli; Meder and Groves, 2005), restricted to small populations at the Nigeria-Cameroon border, remain to be visited by tourists, although plans to habituate the remaining gorillas (< 30) for tourism at Afi Mountain Wildlife Sanctuary have been proposed by the Cross River State Forestry Commission (Dunn, 2005).",

Tourism has been recognized as an important conservation management tool to protect gorillas, yet itself may pose a threat to their survival (Homsy, 1999; Butynski, 2001). For the purposes of this report, the term responsible tourism (which cares for the earth, and means, simply, not exploitation, but sharing), rather than ecotourism will be used (Litchfield, 1997, 2001b). The term ecotourism has been attached to ventures that have resulted in \u201cdeleterious impacts,\u201d and the nature of the ecotourism industry as a whole has been \u201cill-defined\u201d (Rabinor, 2002).",

In the event of a crisis, the question arises, should funding also be made available to local communities involved in the tourism project? The establishment of trust funds (or other stable and sustainable sources of revenue) by international donors and conservation organizations may ensure that gorilla conservation does not rely solely on tourism funds or other \u201calternative economic ventures\u201d (Blom, 2001b, p.41). Ideally, all gorilla tourism sites should receive sufficient funding, irrespective of tourist numbers. A specific fund for the long-term care of gorillas habituated for tourism could provide money to care for gorillas during times when tourism is not possible. Reserve funds set up from tourist income could be used to support site(s) financially during times of tourist scarcity. U.K. tourists seem \u201cprepared to pay a premium of perhaps 5% for guarantees of responsible and sustainable travel\u201d (World Tourism Organization, 2001, p.10). Thus, responsible tourism might provide a potential source of funding for conservation, but conservation managers must determine how much money is needed to support each gorilla tourism site, and whether a 5% contribution by each tourist to a reserve fund is a realistic figure.",

These sites provide opportunities to observe gorillas in a variety of ways. At Maya north saline, gorillas and other large mammals (e.g., forest elephants, buffaloes, bongos, and sitatungas) feeding in forest clearings can be viewed from observation hides. At Lossi, tourists could once view gorillas feeding on fruit above them in the trees (prior to the gorillas' decimation by Ebola). Unlike mountain gorilla and eastern lowland gorilla tourism sites, not all western lowland gorilla tourism sites are located within traditional protected areas (e.g., national parks and reserves). The Lossi site still belongs to its traditional owners, the villagers of Lengui-Lengui, who developed gorilla tourism as part of a community conservation initiative (Aveling, 1999). The Lomi\u00e9 site is located partly within a production forest, and partly within a forest requested as a community forest by the neighboring villages of Karagoua and Koungoulou (Djoh and van der Wal, 2001).",

The self-report rule depends on the honesty of the individual tourist and staff member. The provision and use of facemasks (and safe collection and disposal of them afterwards) when viewing gorillas may bring home these issues more emphatically.",

In the absence of wind, sneeze particles can travel 6 m (20 feet), influenza can be transmitted up to 20 m, and other airborne organisms may travel even further in favorable wind and ultraviolet light conditions (Homsy, 1999). To protect primates from human diseases in zoos, Plexiglas structures are often built as a barrier. The only protection that is afforded to wild gorillas is the strict enforcement of an adequate minimum distance. Unfortunately, it is the one rule that the guides and park staff report that they have the most difficulty enforcing (Homsy, 1999).",

Disturbingly, measles microbes can travel great distances in the open (especially if it is windy), and polio microbes can survive in the soil for several months (Homsy, 1999). There are, however, many other diseases that can be contracted by gorillas if they come in contact with human faeces or fomites (inanimate objects). Hepatitis A and B viruses, shigella, trichuris, herpes simplex, scabies, polio, and intestinal worms may pose an even greater threat to the ultimate survival of wild populations of gorillas (Homsy, 1999). The habituation process may cause stress, which in turn may exacerbate diseases, such as scabies or sarcoptic mange (McNeilage, 1996; Woodford et al., 2002).",

Recently, a three-year old gorilla (Bahati) was killed in a corn field near the border of Parc National des Virunga in DRC, after stones and wood were hurled at his family who had consumed 235 corn stalks (Kiyengo and Binyeri, 2003). If a site is to be developed for gorilla tourism, opportunities for creating buffer zones (e.g., nonpalatable crops), or physical barriers (Lanjouw et al., 2001) should be explored and implemented before the habituation process begins.",

Unlike tourists who are restricted to a one-hour visit with gorillas, researchers may sometimes conduct \u201cnest-to-nest\u201d follows, which involve observing gorilla behavior from morning (when they leave their nests), until evening (when they build and retire to their nests). Strict monitoring of health and inoculations of all visitors and workers should form part of regular routines at all gorilla sites (Adams et al., 2001). The Dian Fossey Gorilla Fund International (DFGFI) has a two-week quarantine period for any researcher working with habituated gorillas (Tara Stoinski, personal communication).",

This holistic ecosystem health approach recognizes the importance of health monitoring of all humans, domestic animals, and wildlife. A Population and Habitat Viability Assessment (PHVA) serves as a first and most vital step in formulating a practical conservation management program for the survival and recovery (e.g., at Lossi) of gorillas in a particular country or region (Miller et al., 10.1007/978-0-387-70721-1_8, this volume).

As much as 17,484 tons of illegal meat enters the United Kingdom per year from outside the European Union (a conservative estimate), with West Africa and South Africa as the top five contributors to the total flow (Department of the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, 2003). In Australia, it is illegal to bring in meat, and 48 teams of detector dogs at Australian international airports sniff out such items (Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, 2006). Following a pilot scheme at Heathrow airport of two detector dogs, there are still only six teams of such dogs in the UK (Duggan and Jarvis, 2003; National Audit Office, 2005).
