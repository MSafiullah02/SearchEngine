The attribution of populations to species was checked by a cluster analysis based on the generalized distances between pairs. Groups representing species were then subjected to a multiple discriminant analysis; discriminant functions and loadings were calculated. The correct attribution of individuals to species by the discriminant functions ranged from 97% to 100%. The analysis of discriminant loadings shows which characters contribute more to the discrimination of species. Although many species could be identified with some confidence by a sequential monothetic key based on meristic and qualitative characters, the discriminant analysis improves the effectiveness of identification of all species. 8 1996",

In recent descriptions the species are poorly defined, and relationships between them have been little investigated. Some trials to construct a system of relationships within the genus were based on arbitrary and, sometimes, contradictory elements, owing to the insufficiency of comparable taxonomic data. The main difficulty is in the poor definition and standardization of characters: every author makes reference to a different set of characters, and reports character states from a subjective point of view. Furthermore, the taxonomy of Electrogena is based mostly on adult morphology and coloration, which are very variable within species or contains little useful information for species characterization. Consequently there is great confusion in the nomenclature. It affects the stability of taxa, and makes the identification of most species difficult or quite impossible. At the same time, the increasing ecological study of rivers and the growth of interest in species of naturalistic relevance demand correct identification of taxa. a stable nomenclature and easy recognition of species.",

Numerical methods can help also to point out the characters which most contribute to the diagnosis, in spite of geographic variability and overlapping of character states. Larvae are preferred for this kind of study over adults. They share a greater number of meristic and measurement characters, and can be collected more easily.",

In choosing the more promising set of diagnostic characters an inescapable tool is long experience in the practice of taxonomy. In some cases the ratio of two linear measurements proved to be a useful way to represent the taxonomic differences. The attribution of populations to species was checked with hierarchic agglomerative methods, based on the generalized distances between each pair of populations. In another step, species were considered as Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs). A multiple discriminant analysis demonstrated the separation of species and showed which characters contributed with a greater information content to the discrimination.",

            "text": "The quantitative characters were of two kinds: meristic (alphanumeric code NJ and ratios (code R-, Fig. 1 ). The use of ratios in studies of numerical taxonomy has been criticized by some authors (Atchley el af.. 1976 ). Hills (1978 and Dodson (1978) refuted this opinion, pointing out the value of ratios as measures of shape in many real biological cases. The use of logarithmic transformations of raw data was recommended by Hills (1978) . Numeric elaborations in the present study were performed on the log,& + 1) pvformation of both ratio and meristic characters. Measures of labrum, glossae and gills were taken from drawings made with a drawing tube mounted on a highmagnification microscope. Other characters were checked directly from slide mounts of maxillae and legs. In the case of paired parts (i.e. left and right maxillae), the mean was used. Canonical variate analysis was performed with SYSTAT package, version 4.0 (Wilkinson, 1987) , and generalized distances were computed with programs developed by the author. Numerical methods here used are described in several books on multivariate analysis, following mainly Krzanowski (1990) and Dillon & Goldstein (1984) . First, Mahalanobis' Distances (generalized distances) were computed between all pairs of populations, and a dendrogram with UPGMA (Unweighted Pair-Group Method Arithmetic average) method was constructed to verify the tentative attribution to species. A multiple discriminant analysis (Canonical Variate Analysis: CVA) was then performed on species, plotting centroids and discriminant scores of individuals onto the canonical axes. The attribution of individuals to species was checked by computing discriminant functions: the transformed character values for each individual are multiplied by the respective coefficients and a sum of these products, added to a constant, is obtained for each species. An individual is attributed to the species for which this value is highest (Wilkinson, 1987) . Finally, discriminant loadings (correlations of characters with canonical variates) were computed to evaluate the contribution of each character to the discrimination of species.",

Larvae of FAL3 (Sardinia) are somewhat different from FAL1 and FAL2 (Corsica), but they share relevant diagnostic characters like the row of bristles on the ventral surface of femora and the very long seventh gill. Moreover, the adults of both groups are quite similar and clearly different from other species. ZEB2 is an aberrant population. Individuals are very small, their size is about one-half of the conspecific material collected in the same period from every other part of Sardinia. The cooccurrence of peculiar diagnostic characters and the similarity between adults would indicate that this population belongs to ZEB. The cases of MAL and GRI deserve a more complex discussion.

This supports the attribution of all three MAL samples to the same cluster. In summary, it should be stressed that the nine identified species can be satis-factorily considered as natural groups, even if the status remains uncertain in some cases. These groups have undoubtedly some inner homogeneity, and are sufficiently separated from each other. CAL. CAL and GRI overlap widely. A further CVA was performed separately on these two groups.

InTable 6 are listed constants and coefficients of the multiple discriminant equations for the nine species (referred to the total discriminant analysis). Table 7 shows the percentage of correct attributions by discriminant equations. In five cases (FAL. LAT, MAL. UJH and ZEB) all individuals were correctly placed.

The discriminant loading vectors (XlO) are plotted onto the first two CVs. together with species centroids, in Fig. 6 . In fact, the number of teeth on tarsal claw (N-CLW) is sufficient by itself to identify E.lareralis from the other species considered here, and this character, together with the number of hairs on the outer edge of galea-lacinia (N-OUT), are sufficient to identify E.zcbrutu. The species of group 1 and group 2 are also strongly discriminated along the second axis, the former with few or no hairs on the outer edge of galea-lacinia (GRA, HYB and MAL); the latter with a high number of such hairs (UJH. GRI, CAL and FAL). The discriminant loadings ofthe partial analyses (first and second canonical variates) are given in Table 8 (middle and right columns); respective vectors (xIO) are plotted in Figs 7 and 8. In these cases there are many characters which contribute at about the same level to the discrimination of species. For group 1 they are mainly N-TCB. N-PLP, R-GLA, R-CLB and R-LBR along the first axis, and N-PLP, N-CBS. N-TCB along the .second one. Thus, GRA is discriminated by the number of teeth on the fifth comb-shaped bristle (low N-TCB), number of hairs on the first segment of maxillary palpus (low N-PLP), glossae spread apart (low R G L A ) and narrower (high RGLB), and labrum with shorter projections (high R-LBR). HYB and MAL are discriminated mainly along the second axis by N-PLP (higher in HYB). N-CBS and N-TCB (both higher in MAL). Within group 2, the first canonical variate is correlated mainly with R I G 1 (negative), N-PLP and R-ICI (negative); the second one with N-OUT, N-CLW, N-TCB, RIG1 (negative), R-GLA (negative). Three clusters are discriminated along the first axis (FAL, CAL and GRI-UJH) by a decrease in the value of R-7GI and R-1GI (which in fact represent the slenderness of the gills) while N-PLP increases. Along the second axis UJH is separated from GRI by inoreasing values of N-OUT, N-CLW. N-TCB, while those of R-1GI and GLA diminish.",

After an inspection of the ranges of the characters (Table 4 ; Belfiore, 1996) . and considering also a two-state character (number of bristles on the ventral surface of femora, near hind edge) discussed in Belfiore & Desio ( 1995) , the following monothetic sequential key can be constructed (the percentages of the 356 individuals identified with this key are indicated in parentheses). One hundred percent of individuals are assigned to the correct species for FAL. LAT, UJH and ZEB. Considering the group GRA-HYB-MAL (couples 4 and 5 of the key), where the dichotomy was optimized to achieve maximum discrimination, the percentages of individuals correctly assigned drop below 97%. poorer result is obtained for GRI and CAL. the latter with only 79% of correct identifications. Although performing less well than CVA (Table 7) , the sequential method produces results which could be considered satisfactory. But it is worthwhile noting that the percentages of correct identifications, both in the sequential key and CVA, refer to the same data set from which the discriminating values are drawn out, and therefore may be overestimated. There is also the problem that some other sources of error can creep into the sequential method. If a mistake is made in the first couplets of the key, there is no way to recover. Some dichotomies are based on very faint differences. A slight error in measurement can falsify identifications. On the other hand, canonical variate analysis takes into account all characters simultaneously and is more robust to slight emrs of measurement, giving the best possible representation of the unknown specimens. relevant by-product of this kind of analysis is the focus on character definition and standardization, particularly needed in taxa like Electrvgem. In the present study the use of quantitative Characters was stressed and the multiple discriminant analysis proved to be very useful for characterization of species, both for discrimination capability and diagnostic character evaluation. Some inner homogeneity and heterogeneity of taxonomic units can be revealed by this kind of analysis. There are also some limits to the use of only quantitative characters. Many diagnostic",
