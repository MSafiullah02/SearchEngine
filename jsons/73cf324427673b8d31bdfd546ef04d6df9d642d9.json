Then, we apply a text mining method bridge these terms as instances with the remaining viruses (bacteria) and thus to discover how much these terms describe the remaining viruses (bacteria). In the end, we build an algorithm to rank all remaining viruses (bacteria). We suspect that the higher the ranking of the virus (bacterium) is, the more suspicious they will be potential bio-terrorism weapon.

            "text": "Terrorist attack concerns many people in the world. Biological agent is one of five categories of terrorist weapons. For certain biological agents, the potential for devastating casualties is very high. The anthrax mail attack in October, 2001 terrorism caused 23 cases of anthrax-related illness and 5 deaths. Due to the widespread availability of agents, widespread knowledge of production methodologies, and potential dissemination devices, bioterrorism can be very cute for now and future. Because it is very difficult for laypeople diagnose and recognize most of the diseases caused by biological weapons, we need surveillance systems to keep an eye on potential uses of such biological weapons [1] . In this paper, we propose an instance based learning method to discover biological agents as potential Bioterrorism Weapons (BW). Before discovering potential BW, it's reasonable to study the characteristics of biological agents identified by human experts as BW. Some human experts have generalized some criteria for identifying virus and bacteria. The more detail is in section 3. However, it's hard for human being to map all the viruses and bacteria one by one to these criteria. Moreover, the list is compiled manually, requiring extensive specialized human resources and time. Because the biological agents such as viruses are evolving through mutations, biological or chemical change, some biological substances have the potential to turn into deadly virus through chemical/genetic/biological reaction, there should be an automatic approach to keep track of existing suspicious viruses and to discover new viruses as potential weapons. We expect that it would be very useful to identify those biological substances and take precaution actions or measurements. For better studying the characteristics of existed biological agents as BW, we use a text mining approach to extract topical MeSH terms from them. This is an exhaustive approach, so we believe that the topical MeSH terms we extract are very representative of the particular BW collection. Then, we use this discovered terms to build a term biological agent matrix from which we check how much these terms can be topical terms for the remaining biological agents. Later, we use the combination of these terms to rank each remaining biological agent. In the end, we get a top ranked term list that can be used as key words for human experts to examine the remaining biological agents. The most important is that we generate a biological agent as potential BW ranked by the extracted terms from the existed biological agents. We suspect that the higher rank the biological agent, the more it can become potential BW. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 briefly discusses the relevant works. Section 3 describes the background information of virus and bacteria as biological agent. Section 4 discusses our method in detail. The experimental results are presented in Section 5.",

            "text": "The problem of mining implicit knowledge/information from biomedical literature was exemplified by Dr. Swanson's pioneering work on Raynaud disease/fish-oil discovery in 1986 [9] . Back then, the Raynaud disease had no known cause or cure, and the goal of his literature-based discovery was to uncover novel suggestions for how Raynaud disease might be caused, and how it might be treated. He found from biomedical literature that Raynaud disease is a peripheral circulatory disorder aggravated by high platelet aggregation, high blood viscosity and vasoconstriction. In another separate set of literature on fish oils, he found out the ingestion of fish oil can reduce these phenomena. But no single article from both sets in the biomedical literature mentions Raynaud and fish oil together in 1986. Putting these two separate literatures together, Swanson hypothesized that fish oil may be beneficial to people suffering from Raynaud disease [9] [10]. This novel hypothesis was later clinically confirmed by DiGiacomo in 1989 [2] . Later on [11] Dr. Swanson extended his methods to search literature for potential virus. But the biggest limitation of his methods is that, only 3 properties/criteria of a virus are used as search key word and the semantic information is ignored in the search procedure. In this paper, we present a novel biomedical literature mining algorithms based on this philosophy with significant extensions. Our objective is to extend the existing known virus list compiled by CDC to other viruses that might have similar characteristics. We hypothesize, therefore, that viruses that have been researched with respect to the characteristics possessed by existing viruses are leading candidates for extending the virus lists. Our findings are intended as a guide to the virus literature to support further studies that might then lead to appropriate defense and public health measures. In our former work [5] , we let human experts to define the key words that help find viruses that can be potential biological weapons. In this paper, we will provide a text data mining approach to target the terms that help identify potential weapons and to rank the viruses according these terms.",

Q fever is a zoonotic disease caused by Coxiella burnetii, a species of bacteria that is distributed globally. Coxiella burnetii is a highly infectious agent that is rather resistant to heat and drying. It can become airborne and inhaled by humans.

Based on this matrix and some statistical information, overall relevance rankings were made for all the terms describing the topic of certain cluster of genes. There are 487 viruses known to us in PubMed database. We found it is quite reasonable to take the 21 viruses (biological weapons) as a cluster of viruses and apply the method discussed above to discover and thereby rank the terms that describes these viruses. We then take the remaining 466 viruses as another cluster and then build a matrix of terms (from 21 known viruses) by viruses (466 viruses) and thus rank all the 466 viruses through a ranking formula.

Accordingly, Table 18-12 to 18-15 show the top ranked topical terms and bacteria by V R criteria (rank1and rank2 respectively).

Moreover, most of disease names caused by the 13 bacteria were also matched in the table. For the potential significance of suspicious viruses/bacteria that we detected, please refer to section 6. ",

In 1999 the Department of Defense was involved in building a directory of known emerging infectious diseases and laboratory tests worldwide and identified approximately 40 high threat agents for bio-terrorism including many of the hemorrhagic viruses [8] . However since that time we have had the emergence of SARS, Avian Flu virus and many other threats to the public health.
