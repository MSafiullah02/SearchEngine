Samples were collected between 2014 43 and 2017. All control groups showed similar median age within H7N9 cases except for the 44 seasonal influenza group with a younger median age. In H7N9 infected men, testosterone levels 45 were strongly reduced compared to male H7N9 virus-negative close contacts or males with 46 seasonal influenza.

Since then, the H7N9 avian influenza A virus caused five epidemic waves from 2013 70 to 2017. Exposure at live poultry markets was considered a major risk factor for human 71 infections with H7N9 virus. A primary epidemiological study revealed that 71% of all H7N9 72 cases were males in the first wave 2 . The high degree of sex bias in men consistently accounted 73 with similar proportions (68%-71%) during the entire five H7N9 epidemic waves 3 . Currently, 74 very little knowledge exists on the complex interplay of biological sex and gender specific 75 behavior as contributors to influenza disease outcome.

However, our data is in line with data 279 reported in murine models, where infection of healthy male mice with influenza A virus was 280 shown to reduce testosterone levels by independent laboratories 10,12 . Interestingly, treatment of 281 female and male mice with testosterone protected animals from lethal outcome 12 . However, 282 testosterone treatment of elderly male mice was less effective 21 . These data strongly hint 283 towards an active reduction of testosterone levels by influenza A virus infection by a yet 284 unknown mechanism. 285 286 For chronic infections, such as HCV or HIV, it was repeatedly shown that these infections 287 cause low testosterone levels likely due to constant inflammation in infected individuals 22, 23 . 288",

It 295 would be interesting to see whether other acute infections, such as the current pandemic Severe 296 acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2(SARS-CoV-2), may also cause low testosterone 297 levels. 298 299 However, despite the well-documented impact of elevated cytokines to disease severity and 300 H7N9 disease outcome 28,29 , no studies considered sex differences in inflammatory responses 301 and the role of sex hormones until now. In our study, elevated pro-inflammatory cytokines and 302 chemokines, such as TNF-\u03b1, IL-8, IFN-\u03b12, IFN-\u03b3, IL-6, MCP-1, IP10, and anti-inflammatory 303 cytokine IL-10 were detected in both male and female H7N9 cases without major statistically 304 significant differences. However, testosterone levels were negatively associated with specific 305 cytokines and chemokines, such as IL-6, and survival rates in H7N9 infected men. This is 306 particularly interesting, since high IL-6 levels were repeatedly reported to be a poor prognostic 307 marker for severe infections, including coronavirus disease 2019 30 . Clearly, future 308 investigations are required to unravel the underlying mechanism of testosterone deficiency in 309 H7N9 infected men. Moreover, future studies are needed to understand whether this is a 310 specific mechanism or whether low testosterone levels can also be detected in other acute viral 311 infections. Increasing knowledge on the regulation of sex hormone levels will provide an 312 important basis to understand diseases with sex disparity and to develop sex specific therapies 313 against viral infections. 314 All rights reserved.

Thus, H7N9 induced cytokine storm is detected 225 in men as well as women. 226 227 Storm cytokine levels in H7N9 infected men are associated with lethal outcome 228 We then analyzed whether certain cytokines might be associated with differential disease 229 outcome. In H7N9 infected men, elevated levels of G-CSF, GM-CSF, IL-8, IL-10, IL-15, 230 MCP-1 and TNF-\u03b1 were associated with death (Figure 3). In H7N9 infected women, elevated 231 levels Eotaxin correlated with survival (Figure 3P), whereas elevated MIP-1\u00df (Figure 3R) and 232 EGF (Figure 3T) levels were associated with death. However, direct comparison of cytokine 233 and chemokine responses in H7N9 infected men and women revealed important differences 234 (Figure S3). Lethal outcome in H7N9 infected men correlated with elevated Eotaxin and MIP-235 1\u00df levels in the 18-49 year olds and with elevated IL-7 in the \u226550 year olds unlike in age-236 matched women with H7N9 influenza (Figure S3A-C).

Other mouse models 86 showed that aged male mice with reduced testosterone levels undergo elevated pulmonary 87 inflammation and severe disease upon H1N1 influenza virus infection compared to young male 88 mice 11 . Recently, it was shown that H1N1 infection itself reduces testosterone levels in male 89 but not female mice. Conversely, treatment of female mice with testosterone protected the 90 majority of H1N1 infected females from lethal outcome 12 . Thus, there is increasing evidence 91 from small animal models that sex hormones play an important role in influenza disease 92 However, very little knowledge exists on the role of sex hormones in infectious diseases in 95 humans and their association with disease outcome.
