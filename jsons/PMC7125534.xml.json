            "text": "Influenza virus infection is an important cause of mortality worldwide, leading to 250.000\u2013500.000 deaths each year in the developed world [1]. While most influenza patients have a self-limited respiratory illness, 5\u201310% of hospitalized patients may develop severe dyspnea or respiratory distress requiring ICU admission [2]. Mortality is caused by the primary viral infection which can have a fulminant disease course [3], but also by influenza-associated pulmonary co-infections [4,5]. It is increasingly recognized that similar to sepsis, influenza can initiate immunosuppressive mechanisms [5,6], creating an ideal environment for opportunistic pathogens to grow out and induce co-infections. Pulmonary bacterial co-infections are predominantly caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus and Haemophilus influenzae [5]. Also, invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA) caused by the fungal Aspergillus fumigatus is recently recognized as a co-infection occurring in 20\u201325% of influenza patients who are admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) [7,8]. Both bacterial as well as fungal pulmonary co-infections are associated with increased mortality rates [7,[9], [10], [11]]. In addition, viral co-infections [12] and reactivation of viruses that reside latent in the host, such as Cytomegalovirus (CMV), Epstein barr virus (EBV) and Herpes simplex virus (HSV) are frequently encountered in influenza patients as well [4,13]. Whether these infections are associated with increased mortality or merely reflect a manifestation of immunosuppression is not elucidated yet.",

More importantly, early recognition of certain factors that influence the disease course of influenza-infected patients may improve current therapy strategies. In the present study, we investigated a cohort of influenza patients (2015\u20132016 season) admitted to two university hospitals in the Netherlands, to identify factors that are related to ICU admission and mortality. In addition, we investigated the incidence of influenza-associated pulmonary co-infections, their causative pathogens and their relationship with ICU admission and mortality.",

The influenza epidemic of 2015\u20132016 started on November 1st 2015 and ended on May 1st 2016 according to the National Institute for Health and the Environment (RIVM Rapport 2016\u20130071). Patients who were admitted to the participating hospitals between October 1st 015 and April 1st 2016 were checked for eligibility for the study. Cases were identified using a database of the microbiology departments at both medical centers. Patients who were admitted to the hospital with clinical symptoms due to an acute infection with Influenza A or B were included. Virus samples were obtained from nose/throat swabs, sputum or bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL). The laboratory of microbiology of both hospitals confirmed a novel influenza infection by positive polymerase chain reaction (PCR; Diagenode, Belgium) for either influenza A (H1N1 / H2N3) or influenza B [14]. No distinction was made between self-referral, scheduled admission or emergency hospital admission. Patients who were initially admitted to regional hospitals before admittance to one of the university medical centers were included if they met the case definition and had not received antibiotic or antiviral treatments before admission. Patients with a positive influenza PCR who were already admitted to the hospital were excluded from the study if the sample was collected as part of a routine screening and no prior symptoms of infection were observed. The initial day of hospital admission was defined as day 0.",

Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS Statistics for Windows, Version 22.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA). An univariate descriptive analysis was performed to identify risk factors for ICU admission in patients admitted to the hospital for influenza virus infection. Chi-square tests and one-sided Fisher exact tests were used for dichotomous variables, unpaired t-tests for normally distributed continuous variables, and Mann-Whitney U tests for non-normally distributed continuous data. All results were verified with a logistic regression model. Next, a multivariate logistic regression was used to identify independent risk factors. Variables with a significance level of p < .05 were selected and those with the greatest odds ratio were included for the number of cases in the ICU-group. All individual variables in the multivariate model were tested on interaction. Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated for each individual risk factor.",

Oseltamivir was administered during admission in 92/199 (46%) patients. 53/199 patients (27%) already received antibiotic treatment before hospital admission, 89/199 patients (45%) were administered antibiotic treatment upon hospital admission and 17/199 (9%) patients received antibiotics at later time points during hospitalization. Empirical treatment at the ICU for community-acquired pneumonia consisted of ceftriaxone 2000 mg mg 2 times a day and of piperacillin-tazobactam 4500 mg 3 times a day for hospital-acquired pneumonia, according to the Dutch national guideline for community-acquired pneumonia in adults (SWAB) [17,18]. Antibiotic regimes were de-escalated when bacterial sputum cultures became positive for a specific bacterial pathogen. 45/199 (23%) of the influenza patients were admitted to the ICU, at a median of 4 [[2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7]] days after development of the first symptoms.",

This was evident for bacterial, fungal and viral pathogens (p = .0008, p = .0003 and p = .02 respectively). The most common bacterial pathogens included Staphylococcus aureus (11%) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (7%). Aspergillus fumigatus was most common among the fungal pathogens (18%), followed by Pneumocystis jirovecii (7%). Patients with a pulmonary co-infection received oseltamivir more often (OR 0.65, CI 95% 0.47\u20130.90, p = .002). No association was observed between the use of immunosuppressive drugs before hospitalization and the development of pulmonary co-infections. Also, no relationship was found between the development of a pulmonary co-infection and ICU mortality (OR 1.24, CI 95% 0.37\u20134.19; p = .76).",

Also, OSAS/CSAS could be a new independent factor related to ICU admission, although the total numbers of patients in this group was only 9. Possibly, a decreased breathing quality weakens pulmonary function in OSAS/CSAS patients and thereby increases the risk for ICU admission. Other mechanisms may influence pulmonary function as well, such as activation of the sympathetic nervous system, vascular endothelial dysfunction, inflammation and oxidative stress as described as OSAS/CSAS-related (cardiovascular) complications [21].",

This could be due to selection of the patients, composed from a database of two tertiary centers in the Netherlands which overall represent the most severely ill and therefore logically associated with an increased number of ICU admissions. The ICU population was treated more often with oseltamivir in comparison with patients at the normal ward. Oseltamivir is a neuraminidase inhibitor that blocks the viral neuraminidase, an enzyme that is essential for the release of newly formed virions from the host cells. A Cochrane analysis concluded that oseltamivir reduced the time to first alleviation of symptoms by 16.8 h, but had no effect on hospitalization risk [23]. Oseltamivir had no effects on mortality among patients with type A/H1N1 influenza during the 2009 pandemic [24]. In our study, oseltamivir was administered to every influenza patient upon admission, except when clinical symptoms were prevalent >5 days, most likely reflecting a less severe influenza disease course in these patients. The increased use of oseltamivir in patients admitted to the ICU is therefore more likely due to selection bias, and not a true risk factor for ICU admission. Also, an increasing trend for ICU mortality was observed for the systemic use of steroids and non-steroid immunosuppressive drugs before hospitalization. The latter suggests that an immunosuppressive state, caused by (pre-existent) immunomodulatory therapy or as a direct result of influenza infection leading to increased susceptibility towards secondary infections, might influence the disease course and prognosis of influenza infection. Further research is needed to identify risk factors for a complicated disease course.",

            "text": "Co-infections were more often observed in patients admitted to the ICU, which could probably be the result of an influenza-induced immunosuppressed state, which hampers the initiation of an adequate immune response to eradicate invading pathogens. As expected, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumonia were the most common bacterial pathogens determined, prevalent in respectively 11% and 7% of influenza patients at the ICU, causing a transition from normal colonization of the upper respiratory tract to infectious disease [5,25]. Influenza predisposes to secondary infections by direct effects, including the disruption of epithelial cell barriers and suppression of the production of antibacterial peptides and upregulation of bacterial adhesion molecules [1,26,27], but also by indirect immunomodulatory effects, such as impairing antigen presenting capacity in the draining lymph nodes [27,28] and altered expression of costimulatory molecules and cell surface receptors [5,27,28]. The high incidence of fungal co-infections in the subgroup of ICU patients, in particular caused by Aspergillus fumigatus (18%) is in line with previous reports, showing that the pathogen Aspergillus fumigatus is observed in 20\u201325% of influenza patients [7,[29], [30], [31], [32], [33], [34]]. The high incidence of co-infections caused by Streptococcus pneumonia, Staphylococcus aureus and Aspergillus fumigatus indicates that a specific immune defect could be present in influenza patients, increasing the susceptibility towards these pathogens, which is currently under investigation [35]. Our data indicates that although pulmonary co-infections are more often observed in ICU patients, compared with patients at the normal ward, this is not necessarily associated with increased mortality. The majority of previous studies illustrate increased mortality resulting from infections with Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Aspergillus spp. following influenza infection [4,36,37]. Possibly, the increased mortality could not be demonstrated due to the low number of patients in the current study. Of note, we cannot exclude that the high incidence of pulmonary fungal and bacterial co-infections in the current study is related to selection bias, because both selected hospitals for this study are tertiary hospitals, generally receiving the most severely ill influenza patients.",

All factors above have influenced the scientific impact of the data. However, even with the limited number of study subjects, independent risk factors and several statistical significant relationships were identified using a multivariate logistic regression analysis. However, complications logically occur in the most severely ill and one could suggest that these factors would therefore merely reflect disease severity than being true risk factors.
