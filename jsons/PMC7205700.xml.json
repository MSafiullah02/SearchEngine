            "text": "An emulsion is a system consisting of two immiscible liquids where one of the liquids is dispersed in the other. Due to the high surface energy of the interface between the two immiscible phases, emulsions are thermodynamically unstable. Conventional emulsions are stabilized by surfactants or amphiphilic polymers that reduce the oil-water interfacial tension and form a molecular film around the liquid droplets. In addition to molecular emulsifiers, solid particles can also serve as emulsion stabilizers. Particle-stabilized emulsions known as \u201cPickering emulsions\u201d were first observed and described by Ramsden and Pickering in the early 20th century[1, 2]. In recent decades, benefiting from the rapid development of particle synthesis techniques and discovery of new colloids with tunable surface properties, the applications of Pickering emulsions and derivative materials have attracted increasing attention. Although conventional surfactant-stabilized emulsions have been successfully and extensively used in various fields such as crude oil recovery, food, paints and coatings, and water treatment, the large-scale use of surfactants in industrial applications or personal care products is not cost-effective and in some cases may cause adverse effects such as irritation and hemolytic behavior. Therefore, the use of colloidal particles may be a promising alternative to the use of surfactants, motivating the recent trend in the studies of Pickering emulsions of seeking to enable the commercial manufacturing and practical use of these materials.",

            "text": "Pickering emulsions are often considered to be highly stable due to the nearly irreversible interfacial adsorption of particulate stabilizers[3], and the stabilization mechanism of Pickering emulsions has been explored by many researchers[3, 4]. Due to the high energy of particle desorption from the interface, the resultant superior stability of Pickering emulsions can effectively protect the encapsulated actives within the emulsion droplets for a long time, and even proteins and enzymes can be well-preserved in Pickering emulsions. Based on their fundamental properties, previous academic research on Pickering emulsions has mainly focused on microencapsulation, controlled release, drug delivery, and biphasic catalysis. In addition to their use in emulsions, advanced materials templated or fabricated from Pickering emulsions have also been reported extensively in recent studies, with most of the materials obtained in the form of foams and capsules. Pickering emulsions are excellent templates for the facile preparation of foam materials because the emulsion droplets naturally provide void structures with adjustable pore sizes after evaporation or washing. Meanwhile, the good stability of the Pickering emulsions is beneficial for foam formation during the freezing-drying or polymerization process. Some examples of new foam materials obtained from Pickering emulsions are also included in this review. Unlike the method of using the sacrificial seed template particles, the preparation of capsules or colloidosomes from Pickering emulsions does not require the subsequent removal of the template particles, and furthermore, cargos can be encapsulated inside the particles in advance.[5] Recently, Binks et al.[6] has reviewed the methods and applications of Pickering emulsion templated capsules and discussed the typical examples of the research studies conducted in recent years.",

They first synthesized monodispersed silica nanoparticles with different diameters (50, 130, and 230 nm), and then chemically modified the silica nanoparticles to make them hydrophobic in order to stabilize the water-in-oil (w/o) Pickering emulsions. It was found that the size of the obtained emulsion droplets could be reduced through the decrease in the diameter of the silica stabilizers, and the diameter of the emulsion droplets can even be smaller than 500 nm when 50 nm silica nanoparticles were used as the emulsifiers. By using the submicron Pickering emulsion as the template, tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) was introduced into the oil phase and a silica shell was formed at the oil-water interface, simultaneously fixing the adsorbed silica nanoparticles. The obtained all-silica submicron capsule can be applied for the encapsulation of hydrophilic cargos, and the release of the actives can be responsively triggered by ethanol or surfactant.",

In the synthesis of such mesoporous silica nanoparticles, hydrophilic zwitterionic groups and hydrophobic groups were simultaneously incorporated on the shell so that the obtained Pickering emulsions can switch from o/w to w/o, and were proven to be highly stable against coalescence even at high-salinity conditions. Interestingly, polyoxometalate was carried in the pores of the mesoporous silica, promoting the efficiency of the epoxidation reactions and eliminating the need to stir the emulsions during catalysis. Jiang et al.[11] synthesized dendritic mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs) for stabilizing the o/w Pickering emulsions. While the synthesized mesoporous silica nanoparticles were relatively small with a diameter of only 130 nm, the maximal pore size of these nanoparticles reached \u223c7 nm, which is larger than that for most MSNs. This enabled the absorption of candida antarctica lipase B (CALB) into the pores of the MSNs with the enzyme loading of 166.3 mg/gsupport, and a MSNs-stabilized Pickering emulsion platform for interfacial enzymatic catalysis was obtained. In addition to the Pickering emulsions stabilized by solid and mesoporous silica, Bao et al.[12] recently used hollow silica nanoparticles for the stabilization of Pickering emulsions, and found that hollow silica nanoparticles exhibited strong adsorption. The cavity structure endowed the hollow silica nanoparticles with a low density, which may be the reason for the stability of the prepared Pickering emulsions.",

            "text": "Furthermore, many other inorganic colloidal particle including nonmetallic oxide particles, magnetic particles and elemental particles exhibit good performance for the stabilization of Pickering emulsions. For example, laponite clay consists of disc-like particles, and a toluene-in-water Pickering emulsion was successfully prepared using these particles by Ashby and Binks approximately 20 years ago[13]. In another work, Kikuchi and co-workers fabricated a calcium carbonate (CaCO3) capsule templated from the Pickering emulsion stabilized by calcium carbonate[14], and showed that the CaCO3 capsule is soluble under acidic conditions (Figure 1C). Additionally, carbon-based particles such as carbon quantum dots[15] (Figure 1D), carbon nanotubes[16, 17], and graphene oxide particles[18] have been shown to be excellent materials for use as Pickering stabilizers for applications in water purification, biosensors and electrochemistry related fields. On the other hand, metal salts have been rarely used in Pickering emulsions. In the two example of such studies, Chen and coworkers synthesized highly uniform zirconium phosphate (\u03b1-ZrP) nanoparticles to produce \u03b1-ZrP nanodisk-stabilized o/w emulsions[19] (Figure 1E), and Liu et al. used \u03b1-ZrP nanosheets for forming a Pickering emulsion during the flooding process in order to enhance oil recovery[20]. Metal oxide particles such as iron (III) oxide (Fe3O4) nanoparticles[21] (Figure 1F) and titanium oxide (TiO2) particles[22] have been a popular choice for application to Pickering emulsions. The Fe3O4 nanoparticles endow the emulsion with magnetic-responsive functionality, while the TiO2 nanoparticles can help to screen UV radiation and enhance the photocatalytic performance. In addition to these two examples, many other inorganic particles such as gold nanospheres have been used as the stabilizers for Pickering emulsions [23].",

These particles have been synthesized to obtain various shapes and engineered structures, or modified with different functional groups via surface chemistry to meet the needs of various applications. The breakthroughs in particle synthesis have also strongly influenced the fabrication of Pickering emulsions, leading to the realization of novel and interesting Pickering emulsion systems.

By contrast, polymer colloidal particles are composed of three-dimensional polymer networks that are entangled and chemically crosslinked. Polystyrene (PS) particles are a classical example of such polymer particles, and were used by Dinsmore et al. to fabricate a \u201ccolloidosome\u201d capsule that was templated from an o/w Pickering emulsion stabilized by monodispersed PS spheres.[24] The colloidosome structure was fabricated from the emulsion with the full coverage of the PS spheres at the oil droplet. Although the PS spheres were polymer-based, they still behaved as rigid particles due to the high glass transition temperatures (T\ng) of the polystyrene polymer. Recently, Douliez et al.[25] reported a hydrogelled colloidosome that was derived from a water-in-water (w/w) Pickering emulsion stabilized by amine-modified polystyrene latex beads. The internal phase of the w/w emulsion was an aqueous liquid filled with dextran, while the continuous phase consisted of a polyethylene oxide (PEG)-enriched solution. After the gelation of the core of the prepared w/w Pickering emulsions, the obtained colloidosome with molecularly crowded interiors displayed reversible swelling, as shown in Figure 2\nA. Unlike the w/o emulsions, this w/w colloidosome allowed the uptake and exclusion of macromolecular payloads, making it a novel Pickering system for microencapsulation.",

However, the microgels are more flexible than the rigid PS particles, and are very hydrophilic and thus can easily absorb water within the polymer networks. Moreover, microgels can switch between the states of swelling and collapse, with the switching triggered by the changes in the environmental conditions such as temperature[30, 31] and pH[32, 33]. In the swollen state, the microgel is soft and highly deformable, and the polymer chains are stretched. On the other hand, the collapsed microgel resembles a rigid particle due to the shrinkage of polymer chains.[34] In the synthesis of microgels, functional and responsive groups are introduced in order to endow the microgels with environmentally-dependent behavior.",

However, the stabilization mechanism underlying the preparation of the microgel-stabilized emulsions is far from being completely understood.[35, 36] Compared to the rigid colloids, the microgels are soft, fuzzy, and deformable [26] so that the concept of the contact angle may be not applicable to the microgels at the oil-water interface. In the emulsification process, the microgel is more similar to a polymer emulsifier because it itself is composed of polymers. Thus, the stabilization mechanism may also be explained by the ability of the microgel to reduce the oil-water interfacial tension. A previous study has indicated that soft particles reduced the oil-water interfacial tension more effectively than rigid particles.[37] Moreover, the soft particles also exhibited significantly higher interfacial activity at the oil-water interface than the rigid particles, and a clear correlation between the deformability of the microgels and the emulsions stability arising from the core-shell structure of the microgels was demonstrated [38].",

Although they are superior emulsifiers for stabilizing the o/w Pickering emulsion, and even a small amount of microgels is enough to prepare an o/w internal phase Pickering emulsions with a high oil volume fraction close to 0.9[40], the preparation of w/o Pickering emulsions by these water-swollen microgel particles is difficult. To strongly stabilize w/o Pickering emulsions by microgels, the microgels that are dispersed in water should also somehow show hydrophobicity to improve their affinity to the oil component so as to strongly adsorb at the water/oil interface in the preparation of the w/o emulsions. To overcome this issue, nanocomposite microgels with adjustable hydrophobicity and surface roughness were synthesized by Suzuki et al.[41] First, poly(N-isopropylacrylamide-co-fumaric acid) microgels were synthesized and prepared as the seed particles. Then, nanocomposite microgels were synthesized by seeded emulsion polymerization using the seed microgels, and different monomers including methyl methacrylate (MMA) and styrene (St) were used for linking the seed microgels. Interestingly, it was found that both the hydrophobicity and the surface roughness of the microgels can influence the interfacial behavior of the nanocomposite microgels, and suitable tuning of these properties can control the emulsion type (o/w or w/o) and stabilize the water-in-polar oil or water-in-nonpolar oil Pickering emulsions, as illustrated in Figure 2C. While further studies are still necessary to provide an in-depth understanding of the stabilization mechanism, the existing work on the microgel stabilization of Pickering emulsions has opened a new avenue for the research on Pickering emulsions stabilized by soft particles.",

In other words, the colloidal stabilizers acted as both the emulsifiers for the stabilization of the emulsion and as the catalytic sites. In this work, an enzyme-polymer conjugate was innovatively synthesized by the grafting of the enzyme onto the polymer, and the enzyme-polymer conjugates were proven to stabilize the o/w Pickering emulsions. The synthesis of this special kind of particle requires certain skills in both polymer chemistry and biochemistry, because the enzyme protein must be linked to the polymer while maintaining its activity, and atom-transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) was used in the synthesis. Nevertheless, this novel particulate stabilizer paved the way for the use of the protein-stabilized Pickering emulsions for interfacial biphasic biocatalysis, and it was shown that two different enzymes, namely benzaldehyde lyase (BAL) and glucose oxidase (GOx), can be effectively conjugated with the polymer and retain their activity at the liquid-liquid interface. By cooperating with additional enzymes, a Pickering emulsion system for interfacial cascade biocatalysis was built up, significantly broadening the range of application of Pickering emulsion catalysis.",

Unlike in the work of Wu et al., an inverse w/o Pickering emulsion was prepared, and a very different method was used for enzyme immobilization. To fix the enzyme in the alginate particle, the lipase was first trapped in the gel network of the alginate, and then the alginate gel was emulsified by silane-grafted titania nanoparticles and surfactant Span 80 to obtain a w/o emulsion with the paraffin oil as the oil phase. After gelation by calcium chloride, a TiO2-coated alginate microparticle was formed with the lipase confined inside the microparticle. Then, the wettability of microparticles was changed to stabilize the w/o Pickering emulsion, enabling the catalysis of an esterification reaction at the interface. More recently, the strategy of the use of binary particles for the stabilization of w/o Pickering emulsions for interfacial biocatalysis was developed in our group.[68] In the binary particles, the first component was a pH-responsive microgel that simultaneously encapsulated the enzymes and served as a catalyst carrier, while hydrophobic silica nanoparticles served as the second component that improved the stability of the resultant w/o emulsion, the optical microscopy images of prepared w/o emulsions are illustrated in Figure 3C. It was found that the obtained inverse Pickering emulsion showed ideal catalytic behavior for the reactions at the water-oil interface. The enzyme immobilization method was facile and did not involve chemical bonding, and the Pickering emulsion was also prepared in the normal manner by homogenization. This approach may inspire new insights and methods for the fabrication and applications of Pickering stabilized systems.",

With the progress of modern medicine, enhanced vaccination has become extremely important, and Pickering emulsions are likely to be used in this field in the future. As an initial demonstration, Xia et al.[76] developed a PLGA nanoparticle stabilized squalene-in-water Pickering emulsion adjuvant system for exploiting the force-dependent deformability and lateral mobility. Compared to the conventional emulsions stabilized by surfactants and solid particles, Pickering emulsions displayed an enhanced antigen uptake, and promoted humoral and cellular immune responses. More practically, the PLGA nanoparticle-stabilized Pickering emulsion adjuvant system (PPAS) was further employed in clinical-relevant vaccinations, and immune protection by H1N1 vaccine with PPAS as the adjuvant was investigated experimentally, with the results obtained on mice indicating that PPAS may be a good candidate adjuvant. Unfortunately, the appearance of a number of epidemic diseases and novel viruses such as the influenza, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), and the novel COVID-19 coronavirus that appeared in 2019 has made development of vaccines increasingly urgent. Although the vaccine itself is the most direct and powerful tool for preventing the virus-borne epidemics, the adjuvant plays an important role in the vaccine formulations. It is clear that good adjuvants can promote the efficiency of the vaccine, and Pickering emulsions should be investigated as adjuvants.",

Since the internal volume fraction of the HIPE is very high, the templated foam material displays a low density after liquid removal. When the primary emulsion is of the w/o type, polymerization of the oil liquid can always obtain a hydrophobic scaffold foam. One of the advantages of such foam is that it can freely float on water, and the large voids inside the foam can absorb a large amount of oil, endowing these foams with great potential for the treatment of marine oil spills. In recent years, many works have reported on the innovative use of HIPEs-templated foams in water treatment[85], oil capture[86, 87], oil/water separation[88], and CO2 or pH-switchable oil/water absorption[88, 89]. However, the majority of the above mentioned emulsion-templated foams are derived from surfactant-stabilized emulsions. While Pickering-type polyHIPEs have been reported for more than a decade [90, 91], the use of Pickering HIPEs templated foams for applications relevant to oil/water separation has been rare. The bridging of the gaps between the properties of the current state-of-the-art Pickering-type polyHIPEs and the properties required for the use of these polyHIPEs for practical oil/water separation may be due to the closed-cell structure of the Pickering templated foams, and the simultaneous incorporation of surfactants into Pickering polyHIPEs is a possible direction for future research in this field.",

            "text": "As the oldest and most intensely investigated 2D material, graphene oxide (GO) has attracted considerable attention since the first discovery of graphene in 2004.[94] Due to its amphiphilic nature and extraordinary interface chemistry properties, GO acts as a sheet-structure colloidal particle for the fabrication of Pickering emulsions, while the GO sheets can assemble in a 3D structure at the liquid-liquid interface.[95] Huang et al.[96] have studied the stabilization of Pickering emulsions by GO sheets since 2010, and many researchers have found that the GO particles can act as the surfactants for stabilizing the interface[97], and GO-stabilized capsules[98], HIPEs[99, 100] and foams[[101], [102], [103], [104], [105]] have been continuously reported in the literature, and some of examples are illustrated in Figure 4A & 4B. For further information regarding the current understanding of the interfacial behavior of graphene oxide at the liquid-liquid or air-liquid interfaces, the readers can refer to a recent review.[95] Beyond graphene and graphene oxide, boron nitride (BN), transition-metal dichalcogenides (MoS2, WS2, etc.), phosphorene, and 2D transition metal carbides or nitrides (MXenes) have also been added to the family of 2D materials in recent years. Recently, an o/w Pickering HIPE was successfully prepared using modified Ti3C2Tx-MXene flakes, and a templated macroporous foam material was fabricated.[106] (Figure 4C) Similarly, Russell et al.[107] demonstrated that cooperative assembly of amine-functionalized polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane (POSS-NH2) and Ti3C2Tx-Mxene sheets improved the interfacial activity at the water-oil interface. The obtained w/o emulsion was concentrated by centrifugation to fabricate the MXene aerogel, and it was shown that the aerogel has a macroporous structure and low density, and can be potentially used for oil absorption and electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding (Figure 4D). In addition, the interfacial behavior and jamming of the Ti3C2Tx nanosheets at the oil-water interface was examined and described by Zettl et al.[108] It is believed that the development of 2D-material-stabilized Pickering emulsions and derived functional materials will be a new trend in colloidal and material science.",

This review briefly describes the various applications derived from Pickering emulsions focusing on several different categories based on the particle stabilizers comprised by inorganic particles, polymer particles, food-grade particles, and several composite particles and newly-discovered 2D material particles. Due to the recent breakthroughs in particle synthesis, the functionalities of the particle stabilizers endow the as-prepared Pickering emulsions with unique features that are unavailable in conventional surfactant-stabilized emulsions, and many studies have demonstrated the importance of these Pickering emulsions in interfacial catalysis, biomedicine, drug delivery, functional materials and other fields. We believe that the design of engineered colloidal particles will be a popular topic of future research.",

The different emulsifiers can endow the as-prepared Pickering emulsions with multiple functionalities and responses, and the fundamental study of multi-particles\u2019 behavior at the emulsion interface and their specific applications should also be considered a promising direction for future research. Additionally, while to date the vast majority of the reported Pickering emulsions have been the single oil-in-water (o/w) or water-in-oil (w/o) emulsions, future work may concentrate on the design of particles with suitable amphiphilicity for stabilizing emulsions with multiple compartments, such as water-in-oil-in-water (w/o/w) or oil-in-water-in-oil (o/w/o) double emulsions. In one example of such work, Zhu et al.[109] synthesized poly(2-(diethylamino)ethyl methacrylate) (PDEA) microgel particles for fabricating a high internal phase emulsion with the double emulsion morphology via a simple one-step emulsification method.",

By contrast, investigations of the use of formulations based on Pickering emulsion in cosmetics have been rarely reported. Although emulsification technology is widely used in cream, lotion, foundation, and other cosmetic dispersions, the majority of the emulsion-based products are stabilized by surfactants. The use of Pickering emulsion formulations for cosmetic applications in order to avoid the skin irritation and sensitization issues caused by surfactants should be a promising concept for future research, particularly due to the large size of the cosmetics market. For these studies, it may be useful to draw on the experience of the studies of the Pickering emulsions stabilized by food-grade particles in order to address the safety and biocompatibility issues. Finally, we believe that Pickering emulsification is an efficient approach for the assembly of 2D materials at the interface for the construction of 3D functional foams that is envisioned for enabling the applications of the Pickering emulsion derived materials in the fields of electronics, energy, and even wearable devices.",
