Enteral nutrition (EN) has to be preferred to maintain muscle tone, microbiota, and intestinal immunity as well as for the lower risk of infectious complications compared to PN [10]. The choice of the appropriate nutritional mixture must be individualized. In all cases, potential complications of EN should be monitored. Gastrostomy is the standard approach for EN administration, starting with 20 ml\\h to gradual increase until the nutritional goal is reached [14]. Adverse reaction of EN has to be considered in the light of the gastrointestinal manifestations of SARS-CoV-2. Those patients who underwent EN, have reported higher rates of respiratory complications and longer durations of NIV application, compared with those with no EN [8]. In these patients, PN is preferred to EN since nasogastric can cause air leaks and compromise the effectiveness of NIV or CPAP [15].",
