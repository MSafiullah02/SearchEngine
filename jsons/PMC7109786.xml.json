Rates were calculated using Stata (version 8.2; StataCorp) and SAS software (version 9.1; SAS Institute) procedures by weighting the observed number of enrolled hospitalizations to account for sampling 4 days/week and eligible patients who were not enrolled; age and study site were the sampling strata. Rates were calculated overall and by viral etiology and demographic subsets, with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) calculated using the Confidence Interval Analysis program (version 2.0.0; British Medical Journal). This program assumes events to have a Poisson distribution, and population is constant with no sampling variation. Rates were compared between the age groups using conditional and normal theory test [33].

G. Szilagyi, University of Rochester Medical Center, Rochester, NY, personal communication). Asthma prevalence was obtained from the National Center for Health Statistics, which reports results from multiple data sets including the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS). NHIS asks parents if a doctor or other health professional has ever told them that their child had asthma or has had an asthma attack during the last 12 months. Using the projected asthma prevalence from this survey of 7.5% in children <5 years of age in the United States, rates of rhinovirus-associated hospitalization among children with asthma were also calculated [34]. A x2 test was used for categorical variables. Multivariable analysis was performed using logistic regression to determine odds ratios.",

Blomqvist et al. found that 22% of all children had at least 1 rhinovirus infection by 6 months of age [44]. Although we do not have incidence data on infection, our hospitalization data suggest that the children hospitalized with rhinovirus may not be at greater risk of infection but instead may be more likely to have a worse outcome. In the few studies investigating rhinovirus infection in asymptomatic children who have underlying asthma, the proportion with rhinovirus tends to be lower (10%\u201312%) [12, 16] than in other studies of asymptomatic children without asthma (18%\u201320%) [27, 45]. A recently published study evaluating the role of viruses in outpatient respiratory illnesses in a birth cohort of children 0\u20131 year of age found that 69% of ARIs were viral, and, of those, 48.5% were attributable to rhinoviruses. These investigators also found that 11.5% of asymptomatic children in the birth cohort were infected with rhinoviruses and were reported to be clinically well within the 4-week period surrounding viral detection [46]. We found a similar distribution among hospitalized children, with a 44% detection of rhinoviruses in the viral-positive specimens.",

First, we did not test concurrent healthy controls to determine the prevalence of asymptomatic rhinovirus shedding. However, we did perform viral surveillance in all enrolled children and did not detect additional viruses in the majority of the children with rhinovirus. Although it is possible that rhinovirus infection was an incidental finding in children with other viral or bacterial pathogens, few of the children had viral coinfections detected. In addition, the rate of asymptomatic rhinovirus infection from previous studies is less than the rate of infection seen in the present study [12, 27, 42, 45\u201348]. Another limitation is that we only evaluated rhinovirus during a single year, and the seasonality may not reflect the rates in other years or other geographic areas. Although surveillance hospitals included at least 95% of county children admitted with fever or respiratory illness and we adjusted for nonenrolled children and nonsurveillance days, enrolled children may not have been representative of the entire county populations. Finally, although the present study utilized sensitive PCR methods coupled with culture, we may have failed to detect some viruses due to RNA instability, low titers, or as-yet unidentified viruses. Although some studies have suggested higher detection rates with nasal aspirates/washes rather than nasal/throat swabs, other studies have not confirmed these findings [8, 49]. Swabs are more acceptable to families.",

Further studies of hospitalized children and healthy controls are needed to better understand the proportion of disease caused by infection and the clinical and epidemiologic features of these infections.
