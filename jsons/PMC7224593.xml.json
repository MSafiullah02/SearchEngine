Informed consent was obtained from all individual participants who were included in the study. Nineteen patients with an average age of 85 years (range, 74 to 90 years) were admitted to the emergency orthopaedic room for the treatment of a proximal femoral fracture; the fractures were classified as OTA/AO4 type 31-A1 (8 fractures; 42.1%), 31-A2 (5 fractures; 26.3%), 31-B2 (5 fractures; 26.3%), or 31-B33 (1 fracture; 5.3%)5. Three patients had no history of fever or respiratory symptoms and were excluded from the study. Sixteen patients had reported fever and shortness of breath 3 to 7 days before hospitalization, and all had accidentally fallen at home with no signs of head injury. All 16 patients presented with symptoms of fever and oxygen desaturation on ambient air; 14 of them needed respiratory support. Clinical features, comorbidities, and the type of assisted ventilation administered at the time of hospitalization for symptomatic patients are shown in Table I. All patients were tested with thoracic computed tomography (CT) screening and oropharyngeal swabs (Fig. 1). The 3 asymptomatic patients with no signs of interstitial pneumonia on the CT scan and no requirement for ventilatory support were promptly transferred to a clinic close to our hospital (Humanitas Gavazzeni, Bergamo, Italy), to which patients are usually assigned for same-day procedures or relief hospitalization, to await the result of the swab test before treatment.",

Three patients died on the wards, before surgery, as a result of severe respiratory insufficiency and multiple-organ-failure syndrome (MOFS). For the other 13 patients, as per the recommendations of the anesthesiologists and trauma team, the criteria for surgery were a peripheral oxygen saturation (pO2) of >90% and a body temperature of <38\u00b0C. Ten patients were operatively treated on the first day, 12 to 24 hours after admission. Three patients had suspended their use of direct thrombin inhibitors and needed surgery to be delayed until the third day after recovery. According to our usual clinical practice, all patients received regional anesthesia, a combination of neuraxial anesthesia and a peripheral femoral block to avoid any type of sedation. We performed reduction and osteosynthesis with an intramedullary nail (Gamma3; Stryker) for lateral femoral neck fractures (Fig. 2) and with an endoprosthesis (Corail; DePuy Synthes) for medial femoral neck fractures, with an average operative time of 30 and 50 minutes, respectively. All patients were encouraged to assume the sitting position on a wheelchair or armchair on the first day postoperatively, and they were assisted by physiotherapists to improve physiological ventilation. Postoperative pain management was based on a non-opioid multimodal strategy, and blood loss was minimized by avoiding fluid overload and managing patients who had hemoglobin values of \u22649 g/dL with concentrated red blood-cell transfusion.",

Nine patients demonstrated hemodynamic and respiratory stability at an average of 7 days (range, 5 to 10 days) postoperatively. Two patients (Cases 1 and 2) were dismissed to a rehabilitation center to continue treatment for COVID-19. Four patients who underwent operative treatment died on the ward for respiratory failure on the first day after surgery (Case 9), the third day after surgery (Cases 8 and 13), or the seventh day after surgery (Case 10).",

We believe that in elderly patients with COVID-19 who have proximal femoral fractures, surgery may contribute to the overall stability of the patient, seated mobilization, improvement in physiological ventilation, and general patient comfort in bed. Nevertheless, elderly patients with COVID-19 with comorbidities and a proximal femoral fracture, especially those with a critical clinical presentation in the ER such as severe dyspnea (pO2 <90%), hyperpyrexia (>38\u00b0C), and signs of systemic organ dysfunction, are in a life-threatening condition and are not eligible for orthopaedic surgery.",
