Given the high concern for pulmonary embolism with the above findings, computed tomography (CT) was performed and analysis of 183 confirmed COVID-19 patients demonstrating an 11.5% death rate. Of the patients who died, 86% had elevated d-dimers of \u2265 3 \u00b5g/ml, and 71% of them developed disseminated intravascular coagulation [3] . In a separate study by Zhou et al, they also found that a d-dimer > 1 \u00b5g/ml was a predictor of mortality, with an 81% rate of mortality in those having an elevated d-dimer [2] . In a retrospective study of 449 patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia, 99 patients received heparin. The study showed a decrease in 28-day mortality among the subgroup of patients with a sepsis-induced coagulopathy (SIC) score \u22654 or a d-dimer result that was 6 times the upper limit of normal [4] . Recent guidelines have also suggested that an elevated d-dimer levels are J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f associated with higher risk of requiring mechanical ventilation, ICU admission, or death [5] .",

In highly suspicious cases, two tests may be necessary to ensure adequate sensitivity.

Despite intravenous fluids, broad-spectrum antibiotics (vancomycin and cefepime), and vitamin B12, the patient became hemodynamically unstable. He received tPA, with improvement in blood pressure and tachycardia. His course was complicated by a leftsided neck hematoma, which formed at the site of the recently placed central venous J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f catheter, after the administration of tPA. Although the patient had positive LAC, hematology recommended against initiation of chronic anticoagulation, given the diagnosis of antiphospholipid antibody syndrome (APLAS) requires two positive tests separated by at least 12 weeks. They considered his thromboembolic event provoked in the setting of N2O inhalant abuse and COVID-19 positivity. Emerging reports show a higher prevalence of coagulopathy and thrombosis in cases with COVID-19 [1,2,3]. The predominant clinical picture appears to be disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) with high rates of venous thromboembolism (VTE), elevated d-dimer levels and high fibrinogen levels, in concert with low anti-thrombin levels and pulmonary congestion, with microvascular thrombosis. Recent studies by Zhou et al. and Tang et al. reported a positive correlation between elevated d-dimer levels on hospital admission and in-hospital mortality [2,3].
