MHC class II proteins are constitutively expressed on the surface of a number of professional APC such as dendritic cells (DC), B cells and macrophages as well as both cortical and medullary thymic epithelial cells. Treatment with an inflammatory signal such as interferon\u2010gamma (IFN\u2010\u03b3) can induce MHC class II expression on the surface of non\u2010professional APC such as endothelial cells, fibroblasts, epithelial cells and many tumors. MHC class II complexes consist of \u03b1 and \u03b2 subunits, which are first assembled in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) with the chaperone molecule invariant chain (Ii) (6) (Figure 1). The precise role of Ii early in the transport pathway has been controversial with evidence, suggesting that Ii protects the MHC class II molecule from associating with unfolded proteins in the ER (7) as well as from improper peptide loading as the complex traffics from the ER through the trans Golgi network (TGN) (8). The cytoplasmic tail of Ii contains a leucine\u2010based motif that facilitates the sorting of MHC class II\u2013Ii complexes through clathrin adaptor proteins found on clathrin\u2010coated vesicles in the TGN (9). From the TGN, MHC class II\u2013Ii complexes enter the endocytic pathway in order to interact with Ag (10). A portion of these complexes traffics directly from the TGN to endosomes and then to late endosomes and prelysosomes. Alternatively, a pool of newly synthesized MHC class II\u2013Ii complexes egresses to the cell surface through the constitutive secretory pathway and then is rapidly internalized at the plasma membrane, thus gaining access to the endocytic pathway. Ii release from MHC class II is required for class II function and binding of antigenic peptides of 12\u201325 amino acids in length (6). Exogenous Ag delivered into the endocytic network through receptor\u2010mediated or fluid\u2010phase endocytosis are exposed to acidic proteases and denaturing reactions, yielding peptide ligands for class II molecules within the endosomal network (11). The binding of these peptides to class II molecules is facilitated by an editor protein, HLA\u2010DM 12, 13, 14, which resides in a highly specialized organelle resembling a late endosome known as the MHC class II compartment (MIIC) (15). Recent studies have begun to reveal how peptides from cytoplasmic proteins might also access class II molecules within the endocytic pathway 16, 17. Resultant peptide\u2013MHC class II complexes are ultimately trafficked to the cell surface for immune surveillance by CD4+ T cells.",

            "text": "Of critical importance in Ag presentation by MHC class II molecules is the degradation of proteins to antigenic peptides. To achieve this, APC exploit the intracellular proteolytic machinery common to most cells. Short\u2010lived cytoplasmic Ag may be degraded by cytosolic proteases such as the proteasome and calpain. Proteolysis of cytoplasmic Ag, like exogenous Ag, may also occur in lysosomes, which are morphologically heterogenous with a low pH environment conducive to protein unfolding and the activation of acid\u2010dependent hydrolases (18). Protein transit from the cytosol to lysosomes, also known as autophagy, typically leads to substrate degradation (2). Autophagy occurs through three distinct mechanisms: microautophagy, macroautophagy and CMA (Figure 1). In microautophagy, small portions of the cytosol are internalized through lysosomal invaginations, and proteins are continuously degraded in the lumen of this organelle even under resting conditions (19). Microautophagy is upregulated under conditions of cellular stress such as starvation, but studies of this pathway have been limited to yeast and cell\u2010free systems so little is known about its role in mammalian cells 20, 21. Macroautophagy is also a constitutively active process in cells for the degradation of long\u2010lived proteins and organelles (2), and during short periods of nutrient deprivation, this pathway is induced as a mechanism to salvage amino acids. In macroautophagy, the cytoplasm is sequestered into double\u2010membraned structures known as autophagosomes, which fuse with lysosomes forming an autolysosome. Following fusion, the vacuolar material is degraded and the products are recycled back into the cytosol. Because these pathways show no specificity or selectivity in terms of the material sequestered, they have been termed bulk autophagy.",

In CMA, specific cytosolic proteins displaying homologous pentapeptide motifs bind to a molecular chaperone complex composed of multiple heat\u2010shock proteins including the heat\u2010shock 70\u2010kDa protein (hsc70) (reviewed in 22). This molecular chaperone complex transports the substrate protein to the lysosomal membrane, where it associates with an isoform of the lysosome\u2010associated membrane protein\u20102, LAMP\u20102A, which functions as part of the lysosomal receptor for CMA. The cytoplasmic domain of LAMP\u20102A serves as a potential docking site for the molecular chaperone\u2013substrate complex, and these chaperones likely unfold substrate proteins, enabling them to bind and translocate across the lysosomal membrane. Lysosomal hsc70 assists with the transport of the proteins into the organelle lumen, where these molecules are degraded by mature acidic proteases.",

Following serum starvation of human B\u2010lymphoblastoid cell lines (B\u2010LCL) to induce autophagy for different time periods, the authors observed an increase in those MHC class II\u2010associated peptides derived from intracellular proteins.

Excess nutrients or growth factors activate phosphatidylinositol 3\u2010kinase (PI3K), resulting in the downstream activation of Tor and a decrease in macroautophagy. Macroautophagy is sensitive to the PI3K inhibitors 3\u2010methyladenine (3\u2010MA) (25) and wortmannin (26), and several investigators have used these compounds to examine how inhibiting autophagy affects MHC class II Ag presentation. Nimmerjahn et al. demonstrated that the treatment of human B cells with 3\u2010MA or wortmannin completely abrogated the MHC class II\u2010restricted presentation of the transfected cytosolic bacterial protein neomycin phosphotransferase II (NeoR) (27). Interestingly, the authors also showed that the generation of the NeoR epitope is dependent on lysosomal acidic proteases rather than cytosolic enzymes, suggesting that this Ag expressed in the cytoplasm must gain access to lysosomal compartments for proper epitope formation. A more recent report showed that the MHC class II\u2010mediated presentation of mucin\u20101 (MUC\u20101) peptides in DC transfected with MUC\u20101 RNA was also sensitive to both 3\u2010MA and wortmannin (28). However, the investigators found that the generation of the MUC\u20101 epitope was dependent on processing in both the cytosol and the lysosomal compartments, suggesting that the MUC\u20101 Ag is first partially degraded in the cytosol and then transported through macroautophagy to the lysosome for further processing.",

Paludan et al. recently showed that the inhibition of lysosomal acidification by chloroquine in Epstein\u2013Barr virus (EBV)\u2010transformed human B\u2010LCL resulted in the accumulation of the EBV nuclear antigen 1 (EBNA 1) in intracellular vesicles positive for the lysosome\u2010associated membrane protein\u20101 (LAMP\u20101) and monodansylcadaverine (29), a fluorescent marker specific for autophagosomes (30). Treatment of the B\u2010LCL with 3\u2010MA reduced the MHC class II\u2010restricted presentation of EBNA 1, suggesting that macroautophagy may be the mechanism by which this nuclear Ag gains access to lysosomes for epitope processing. During macroautophagy, autophagosome initiation and formation require several autophagy\u2010related gene (Atg) products, first identified and characterized in yeast 19, 31. Paludan et al. further demonstrated that silencing the essential autophagy gene Atg12 with small interfering RNA also diminished the activation of EBNA 1\u2010specific CD4+ T cells (29). Similar to the generation of the NeoR epitope, the processing of the EBNA 1 epitope for MHC class II presentation may depend on the activation of acid\u2010dependent hydrolases resident in lysosomes rather than cytosolic proteases such as the proteasome. In the case of the long\u2010lived protein EBNA 1, autophagy may serve as the main degradative pathway whereas the proteasome is more likely responsible for the degradation of short\u2010lived proteins.",

Previous electron microscopy studies had shown that the endocytic pathway intersects the autophagy pathway (32), and it is possible that MHC class II\u2010positive endosomes might converge with autophagosomes in APC. Recently, Schmid et al. reported that in APC such as B cells and DC, autophagosomes are constitutively formed and that these vacuolar\u2010like structures continuously fuse with MIIC (17). In these studies, the authors showed that the autophagosome marker LC3 colocalizes with resident proteins of the MIIC such as MHC class II molecules, the chaperone HLA\u2010DM and the lysosome membrane protein LAMP\u20102. Furthermore, when the cytosolic Ag influenza matrix protein\u20101 (MP\u20101) was directly targeted to autophagosomes by fusion with LC3, an increase in the MHC class II\u2010mediated presentation of MP\u20101 to CD4+ T cells was observed.

For example, treatment of human B cells expressing the cytoplasmic autoantigen glutamate decarboxylase (GAD) with proteasome inhibitors or calpain selectively blocked the MHC class II\u2010restricted presentation of this Ag (33). Conversely, cytoplasmic GAD presentation is only slightly reduced in B cells treated with chloroquine or lysosomal protease inhibitors, suggesting that processing of GAD in the cytosol before transport to the MIIC is key for the class II\u2010mediated presentation of this Ag. Furthermore, the treatment of human B cells with 3\u2010MA has no significant effect on the MHC class II\u2010restricted presentation of cytoplasmic GAD or another cytosolic autoantigen, SMA, a mutant form of the human immunoglobulin kappa light chain (D. Zhou and J. S. B., unpublished data). For these cytoplasmic Ag, macroautophagy may not be the primary route of transport from the cytosol. Similarly, the MHC class II\u2010restricted presentation of the I\u2010E\u03b1 protein expressed in the cytosol was dependent on a functional proteasome (34) but insensitive to 3\u2010MA treatment (35). In contrast, tumor cells transfected with hen egg lysozyme (HEL) in the cytoplasm do not require the proteasome or macroautophagy for the MHC class II\u2010mediated presentation of the HEL epitope (36). Lastly, Taylor et al. recently showed no inhibition of the MHC class II\u2010restricted presentation of two EBV nuclear Ag, EBNA 2 and EBNA 3C following 3\u2010MA treatment of B\u2010LCL (37). Instead, the authors demonstrated that these Ag gain access to the MHC class II pathway through intercellular Ag transfer. Whether intact Ag or antigenic fragments complexed with other proteins or within exosomes are transferred is unknown, but Ag processing by lysosomal proteases in the recipient cell is required for the MHC class II\u2010restricted presentation of these EBV Ag. Overall, these findings indicate that macroautophagy may be an important mechanism for the processing of some cytoplasmic Ag and their delivery to MHC class II molecules. Conversely, for those cytoplasmic Ag dependent on the activity of cytosolic proteases for their processing, macroautophagy may play a less significant role in MHC class II\u2010mediated presentation.",

Previous studies have shown that components of the MHC class I Ag presentation pathway such as the proteasome are important in the processing of cytoplasmic Ag 33, 34. Thus, the TAP heterodimer, which delivers the majority of MHC class I peptides from the cytosol to the ER, might play an important role in the transport of cytoplasmic Ag fragments into endosomal or lysosomal compartments. Recently, the proteasome\u2010 and TAP\u2010dependent generation of two MHC class II\u2010restricted epitopes encoded within two transmembrane glycoproteins of infectious influenza virus was reported in both murine B cells and DC (38). These results differ from several reports from a number of laboratories, suggesting that TAP plays no role in the presentation of cytoplasmic Ag to MHC class II molecules 16, 27, 33, 35, 36, 39. To explain the discrepancy in these results, the authors suggest that in cells with more permeable endosomal membranes such as DC, cytosolic Ag might have more access to this TAP\u2010dependent pathway than in B cells and fibroblasts containing more rigid endosomal membranes. Further studies regarding this transport in specialized immune cells such as DC are clearly needed.",

            "text": "Another possible mechanism for the transfer of cytosolic Ag to endosomal or lysosomal compartments for processing and binding to MHC class II molecules is CMA. Recently, our laboratory demonstrated a role for CMA in regulating cytoplasmic Ag presentation by MHC class II molecules by modulating the cellular levels of two components of the CMA pathway, LAMP\u20102A and hsc70, in human B cells expressing cytoplasmic Ag GAD and SMA (16). Expression of antisense complementary DNA (cDNA) for LAMP\u20102 reduced the MHC class II\u2010restricted presentation of GAD, while overexpression of the LAMP\u20102A isoform resulted in an increased presentation of epitopes from both GAD and SMA. Alternative splicing of the LAMP\u20102 gene gives rise to three isoforms in humans, termed LAMP\u20102A, 2B and 2C (40) (D. Zhou and J. S. B., unpublished data). While LAMP\u20102A and 2B are ubiquitously expressed, LAMP\u20102C displays a tissue\u2010specific distribution and is not found in human B cells (D. Zhou and J. S. B., unpublished data). Interestingly, overexpression of the LAMP\u20102B isoform had no effect on the presentation of cytoplasmic GAD or SMA yet reductions in total LAMP\u20102 isoforms perturbed both cytoplasmic and exogenous Ag presentation by MHC class II. LAMP\u20102A overexpression did not change the overall cellular morphology of APC (D. Zhou and J. S. B., unpublished data), alter the content of autophagosomes in APC or affect the maturation or distribution of the lysosomal protease, cathepsin D (16). These results suggested that while the overexpression of LAMP\u20102A in APC enhanced cytoplasmic Ag presentation, it did not alter the normal cellular processes attributed to lysosomes. In addition to LAMP\u20102, the chaperone hsc70 is essential for the transport of substrates from the cytosol to lysosomes during CMA. We demonstrated that the expression of antisense cDNA hsc70 reduced the MHC class II\u2010restricted presentation of cytoplasmic GAD while hsc70 overexpression enhanced the presentation of this Ag (16). To more definitely show that LAMP\u20102A plays a role in the transport of cytosolic Ag to the lysosome, we electroporated a biotinylated version of the GAD peptide directly into the cytosol of human B cells overexpressing LAMP\u20102A and observed both an increase in the relative abundance of MHC class II:biotin\u2013GAD peptide complexes within the cells and an enhancement in the GAD\u2010specific T cell response (16). Thus, our results suggested that LAMP\u20102A, possibly in association with hsc70, facilitates the delivery of epitopes in human B cells from cytoplasmic Ag to endosomal or lysosomal compartments accessible to MHC class II molecules, ultimately resulting in the activation of specific CD4+ T lymphocytes.",

Bacteria can enter a cell through phagocytosis, and once inside, they either escape from the phagosome into the cytosol prior to fusion with lysosomes or remain within this compartment and block its fusion with lysosomes (42). The host cell may initiate autophagy as a defense mechanism in order to clear bacteria located in the cytosol or in isolated vacuoles (43). For example, upon entering the cytosol from endosomes, Streptococcus pyogenes becomes enveloped by autophagosomes and the bacteria are destroyed upon fusion of the autophagosomes with lysosomes (44). During infection of macrophages with Mycobacterium tuberculosis, treatment with IFN\u2010\u03b3 induces the small GTPase LRG\u201047 important in autophagosome formation, thus facilitating the fusion of pathogen\u2010containing vacuoles with lysosomes (45). Not surprisingly, bacteria have evolved strategies to subvert the pathways of autophagy. For example, the cytosolic pathogen Shigella flexneri produces the virulence factor IcsB that inhibits autophagy (46). Some bacteria such as Legionella pneumophila and Coxiella burnetii induce the formation of double\u2010membrane compartments, resembling autophagosomes, for sites of bacterial replication and then block the maturation of these compartments to autolysosomes to prevent degradation 47, 48.",

One candidate mechanism is the activation of the protein kinase PKR by double\u2010stranded RNA viruses (41); activation of PKR and the subsequent downstream signaling events have been shown to induce autophagy during herpesvirus infection. Recently, Lee et al. showed that autophagy is required for single\u2010stranded RNA viruses to be detected by a component of the innate immune system, the Toll\u2010like receptor 7 (TLR7) (49). In plasmacytoid DC (pDC), autophagy facilitates the transport of viral replication intermediates from the cytosol to lysosomes where TLR7 is activated. Additionally, autophagy is required for the production of important mediators of antiviral immunity, the type 1 interferons, in pDC following infection with either single\u2010stranded RNA or double\u2010stranded DNA viruses. Like bacteria, viruses have evolved mechanisms to utilize autophagy to their advantage. For example, positive\u2010strand RNA viruses such as polioviruses and coronaviruses as well as large cytoplasmic DNA viruses such as vaccinia virus use components of the autophagy pathway to facilitate viral replication 41, 50. These viruses initiate the formation of double\u2010membrane structures, similar to autophagosomes, upon which to build their viral replication complexes.

Additionally, following chemotherapy, tumor cells may initiate autophagy as a protective measure to recycle nutrients or remove damaged cellular components (51). In contrast, overexpression of autophagy\u2010specific genes such as beclin\u20101 inhibits tumor formation in mice while inactivation of these genes results in significant tumorigenesis (52).
