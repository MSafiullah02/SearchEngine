This new type of coronavirus could cause severe acute respiratory syndrome and injuries in other systems as well. The disease progresses rapidly, leading to multiple organ failure and death.1\n,\n2 Quite a few patients have no specific symptoms/signs or radiological abnormalities at the early stage, with only mild symptoms, making the early diagnosis of disease difficult. Therefore, early identification of the infection and creating effective treatment plan are particularly imperative.3\n,\n4 A series of inflammation factors, such as serum amyloid A (SAA), C-reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin (PCT), white blood cells (WBC), lymphocyte (L) and platelet (PLT) have been used in clinic as inflammation indicators. In this research, the authors want to explore if these factors can also assist in the diagnosis of COVID-19 infection and estimate of the disease severity. Thus, in this research, the authors systematically studied the dynamic changes of above inflammation indicators in patients infected with COVID-19, in order to evaluate their clinical values in predicting the severity and prognosis of COVID-19.",

Tianyou Hospital, Wuhan University of Science and Technology, located in Wuhan, Hubei Province, the endemic areas of COVID-19, is one of the major tertiary teaching hospitals and is responsible for the treatments for COVID-19 assigned by the government. All patients were tested positive with SARS-CoV-2 and hospitalized. Patients completed at least twice laboratory data collection and clinical condition assessment at three time points indicated for this study. The length of hospital stay was longer than 14 days prior to February 26, 2020. The dynamic changes of blood SAA, CRP, PCT, WBC, Lymphocyte (L), PLT, CT imaging, and disease progression were studied. At the same time, clinical conditions were evaluated and CT scans were obtained. Data were collected at three time points: admission, 3-5 days of hospitalization, and at the composite endpoint. Composite endpoint is February 26, 2020.As of February 26, 2020, the number of hospital discharge, inpatients, and the number of dead were counted.",

Lesions are more common in the middle and lower lobes, and mostly distributed in the outer zones of the lung and subpleural areas.(2)Progressive: large lesions can be seen and multiple lung lobes in both lungs can be involved. Consolidation and fibrosis of varying sizes are often seen within the lesions. Some cases may be accompanied by bronchial retraction, bronchiectasis, and interlobular pleural thickening. However, pleural effusion and enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes are rare in this type.(3)Severe: Lesions are diffuse in both lungs and uneven in density.
