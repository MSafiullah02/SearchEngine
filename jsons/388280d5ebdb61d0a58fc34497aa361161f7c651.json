Some investigators have reported that RV-C caused more serious illness, especially wheezing and exacerbation of asthma, in some populations 5, [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] compared with illnesses caused by RV-A and B.

The detection and characterization of RV in settings with limited electricity, running water, or laboratory facilities have been difficult in the past but newer methods of specimen storage, transport, and molecular detection have permitted enhanced detection of RV and enabled the study of RV types.

LRT symptoms were more frequently reported in younger infants (<90 days old) compared with older infants (90-180 days old). We examined the association of RV species and types with age at infection, PCR C t value, and reported respiratory symptoms. RV species was not associated with age or PCR C t value, a surrogate for viral load. However, we tested infants only from birth to 6 months of age and were only able to sequence RV-positive samples with C t values less than 30.

The number of viral copies in these samples was too low to provide adequate sequencing data. If some RV types are more likely to be present in low viral loads, their prevalence would be underestimated by our sequencing method. Also, we relied on symptoms reported by parents at weekly interviews and some episodes could have been missed due to limited recall. A total of 25 infants had multiple RV illnesses, in which different RV types were detected. However, we may have missed sequential infections caused by different RV types during single illness episodes because we defined an episode as having more than 21 days between RV-positive nasal swabs and we sequenced only one sample per illness episode. Consequently, for illnesses with symptoms and RV-positive swabs over a long period of time, we were not able to distinguish between prolonged shedding of a single RV type and possible infection with a new type. because we did not test asymptomatic infants, RV types circulating during the study period in asymptomatic infants would also have been underestimated.In conclusion, in very young infants in rural, southern Nepal, with generally mild respiratory illnesses, we detected multiple RV types circulating simultaneously and throughout the study period. However, we did not find differences between RV species in infant demographics or symptoms.We thank the Nepal Nutrition Intervention Project-Sarlahi staff and the mothers and infants enrolled in the study.
