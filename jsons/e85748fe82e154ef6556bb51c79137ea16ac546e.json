However, over the past two decades, it has become clear that these viruses can cause serious infections that require medical attention, particularly in infant, elderly, and immunocompromised patients. Historically, the most common causes of respiratory infections in cancer patients were thought to be opportunistic bacteria and fungi, but newer diagnostic methods have revealed that respiratory viruses can cause serious morbidity and mortality in such patients, including leukemia patients and hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) recipients.",

In this chapter, we discuss the common clinical presentations, diagnostic methods, treatments, and prevention measures for respiratory virus infections in general and in cancer patients in particular (Table 32.

This envelope bears two glycoproteins: the G protein, which attaches to the cell surface, and the F (fusion) protein, which enables the internal components to enter the cell after fusion of host and viral membranes and to initiate replication. Both glycoproteins are integral to pathogenesis [2, 3, 5] . There are two groups of RSV viruses, groups A and B [2] [3] [4] [5] .",

In infants and young children, the primary infection starts in the upper respiratory tract, with rhinorrhea, low-grade fever, and cough; it may progress to lower respiratory infection (LRI) (bronchiolitis or pneumonia), at which stage most patients seek medical attention [3, 6] . It is also likely to involve the sinuses and the middle ear. RSV is known to cause apnea in infants, although the mechanism of this action remains unknown. Older children and adults typically present with upper respiratory tract symptoms, but may also have constitutional symptoms such as fever and malaise [3, 7] . RSV upper respiratory infections (URIs) can also progress to the lower respiratory tract, particularly in institutionalized adults and those with severe combined immunodeficiency, leukemia, HSCT, and in lung transplant recipients [2, 8, 9] . These patients may present with wheezing and shortness of breath, with or without underlying comorbidities or known hyperactive airways. Almost 35% of elderly patients with RSV infections report wheezing [8] [9] [10] [11] .",

RSV infections in adults cannot be clinically differentiated from other viral infections that cause upper respiratory symptoms. For a specific diagnosis, RSV must be detected in respiratory secretions. Nasal aspirates or washes are most likely to give a positive RSV test in young children. If a nasal aspirate or wash cannot be obtained, a nasopharyngeal swab or throat swab may be used. Because immunocompromised or intubated patients are more likely to develop an LRI due to RSV, tracheal aspiration or bronchoalveolar lavage should be performed [8, 25] . The gold standard for diagnosing RSV remains the identification of virus causing typical syncytia in cultures of HEp-2 cells [25] . Viral cultures may take 2 days (shell vial cultures) and up to 2 weeks (routine cultures) to become positive, making isolation less relevant in most clinical settings. Other available methods include antigen detection by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), immunoflourescence assay, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests. Fan et al. [26] reported a sensitivity of 65-95% for RSV detection using rapid antigen testing with ELISA. PCR tests have been shown to be more sensitive than direct antigen detection [27, 28] .",

However, its effectiveness in solid organ transplantation patients remains unknown [31] . An RSV-specific monoclonal antibody (Palivizumab) did not demonstrate a therapeutic benefit in a major study conducted in children [32] . Although the combination of ribavirin and intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) or palivizumab has not been evaluated in a randomized trial, it is sometimes used in severely ill patients with RSV pneumonia, especially HSCT recipients, given that they have high mortality rates from this infection [3, 11, 14] . In patients at risk for progression to LRI, aerosolized ribavirin should be considered at an early stage. A recent trial demonstrated that both the intermittent and continuous schedules of aerosolized ribavirin were effective at preventing progression to LRIs in 91% and 80% of patients with RSV URIs and hematologic malignancies (including HSCT recipients), respectively [33].",

No licensed vaccine is available for RSV; however, two agents, RSV-IVIG and palivizumab, have been used to prevent RSV infection. RSV-IVIG has been studied in children younger than 24 months with severe lung disease and those who were born prematurely [35], but it was removed from the market in 2003. A randomized double-blind placebo-controlled study in children found that palivizumab recipients had a 45% relative reduction in RSV hospitalizations ( p = 0.003). Twenty-one children (3.3%) died in the palivizumab group vs. 27 (4.2%) in the placebo group with no deaths attributable to palivizumab [36] . Palivizumab is easier to administer than regular IVIG, which must be given over 4-6 h, and does not interfere with other vaccinations. However, RSV-IVIG and IVIG may provide additional protection against other respiratory viruses as well [35, 37, 38].",

Influenza viruses belong to the Orthomyxoviridae family, with influenza types A, B, and C constituting one genus. These RNA viruses are enveloped and measure about 80-120 nm in diameter. The designation of the viruses into types is based on the stable antigenic characteristics of the nucleoprotein and the matrix protein antigens. Influenza A and B viruses have surface glycoproteins known as hemagglutinins (HA) and neuraminidase (NA). Three hemagglutinin subtypes (H1, H2, and H3) and two neuraminidase subtypes (N1 and N2) have been described for the influenza A viruses that infect humans. Major antigenic changes in the glycoprotein (basis for new subtypes) are called antigenic shift and can cause pandemics; minor antigenic changes occur frequently, are called antigenic drift, and cause the annual epidemics. Influenza B has only exhibited minor antigenic drift [3, 39] . The 2009 pandemic influenza A (H1N1) contains segments present in North American swine for years, but is a new reassortant virus that acquired M and NA gene segments from a Eurasian adamantane-resistant swine influenza virus [40] .",

Rapid antigen testing using immunoflourescence assays, enzyme immunoassays, and PCR-based testing are used frequently in clinical settings [51] .

PCR-based assays are more sensitive than rapid antigen testing for diagnosing influenza A and B, but are not often used because of availability and cost [51] . Samples should be obtained within 24-48 h of the appearance of symptoms for the most accurate results.",

Individuals with a significant allergy to eggs or those with acute febrile illness should not be given vaccine [63] . The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommends that immunocompromised individuals be vaccinated prior to influenza season and receive daily chemoprophylaxis with an antiviral medication during community outbreaks [41] . Influenza chemoprophylaxis may be used in patients at high risk for complications if the vaccine is contraindicated or not likely to be completely protective. Antiviral drugs should be administered to patients within the first 6 months of HSCT, those with documented graft-versus-host disease, unvaccinated healthcare workers who care for immunocompromised individuals, and residents of long-term care institutions during outbreak periods [64] . The American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (ASBMT) 2009 guidelines [65] for prevention of infection in HSCT recipients recommend annual inactivated influenza vaccine before the beginning of the season and before stem cell transplant. The vaccine may be given 4-6 months after HSCT. They also recommended prophylaxis and preemptive treatment during community and nosocomial outbreaks of influenza A for HSCT recipients regardless of the vaccination status in those who are within 24 months of the transplant or in those with more than 24 months posttransplant, but have GVHD and/or are on immunosuppression. The drug to be used for chemoprophylaxis depends on the susceptibility pattern of the outbreak virus.",

In most cases, infection caused by the virus cannot be differentiated from those caused by other respiratory viruses from the clinical presentation alone [3] . A definitive diagnosis can be established by viral culture or the detection of specific viral antigens. Viral culture remains the gold standard for identification of adenovirus. Nasopharyngeal aspirate or swab, throat swab, sputum samples, or bronchoalveolar lavage can be used, depending on the site of the infection. A cytopathic effect is seen in human cell lines such as HeLa (cervix), A549 (lung), HEK (human embryonic kidney), and HEp-2 (larynx) by strains of adenovirus except for types 40 and 41. Adenovirus 40 and 41 grow well in HEK 293 cells. Adenovirus-specific Enzyme Immunoassay (ELISA) or immunofluorescence assay can be used to detect the presence of virus in clinical samples. These rapid tests suffer from a sensitivity of only about 50%; PCR-based assays can detect adenovirus DNA from a variety of clinical specimens and has better sensitivity [100, 101] . Viral load quantification is a useful tool to measure prognosis and monitor clinical response [102, 103] . Viral loads higher than 1 \u00d7 10 6 copies/mL have been associated with an increased likelihood of death [104, 105] .",

Infections due to rhinovirus have an incubation period of 1-4 days. Adults characteristically experience sneezing, nasal obstruction and discharge along with cough, and a sore or scratchy throat. Sinuses are commonly involved so that the illness is rhinosinusitis. Symptoms may last for 4-9 days and usually resolve with no complications. Fever is not usually associated with adult illness [3, 121] . Children, on the other hand, may experience fever, cough, and nasal discharge and obstruction. In addition, the duration of symptoms may be longer. Although bronchitis, bronchiolitis, and bronchopneumonia have been reported in children, rhinovirus is not usually a major cause of lower respiratory illness [3, 122] . However, they are an important cause of exacerbations of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in children and adults and of LRI in the elderly [3, 119] .",

The immunocompromised state of many cancer patients constitutes the basis for the frequent failure of the host to promote a normal and rapid recovery from an acute respiratory viral infection and results in a more severe and prolonged infection that causes significant morbidity and mortality in these patients. Those respiratory viruses that are most prevalent and most prone to produce lower respiratory illnesses and pneumonia in healthy hosts, RSV, influenza viruses and PIV, are those most likely to cause severe illness and pneumonia leading to hospitalization in immunocompromised persons. However, viruses less prone to produce a lower respiratory illness but that are highly prevalent, such as rhinoviruses, may frequently be associated with severe illness. Although not generally considered respiratory viruses, the Herpes viruses are known to produce respiratory infection and disease, sometimes severe, in immunocompromised patients (Table 32 .1).
