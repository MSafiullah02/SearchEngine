            "text": "Foamy viruses (FV), also designated spuma\u2010 or spumaretroviruses are the least studied group within the family of the Retroviridae (Rethwilm, 2003). During the last few years, interest in FVs increased for certain reasons. First, FVs are considered promising vectors for the targeted delivery and expression of therapeutic genes or antigens, e.g. for the transduction of human haematopoietic stem cells or as vaccine vectors (Vassilopoulos et al., 2001, 2003a; Schwantes et al., 2003). Secondly, the FVs of wild\u2010ranging and captive non\u2010human primates, the simian FVs (SFV), have repeatedly been shown to cross host\u2010range barriers resulting in zoonotic transmission to humans (Schweizer et al., 1997; Heneine et al., 1998). Finally, various features of the FV replication pathway, morphogenesis and particle structure are different from those of the other retroviruses (Linial, 1999; Lecellier and Saib, 2000; Linial and Eastman, 2003; Rethwilm, 2003). These FV\u2010specific differences even resulted in a novel systematic placement within the family of the Retroviridae that is now subdivided into two major subfamilies: the Spumavirinae and the Orthoretrovirinae which comprise all other known retroviruses including among others the highly pathogenic human immunodeficiency viruses (HIV), the human T\u2010cell leukaemia viruses (HTLV) and animal pathogens like equine infectious anemia virus, feline and bovine leukaemia viruses, immunodeficiency viruses of cattle and cats, and the ovine enzootic nasal tumour virus (Rethwilm, 2003).",

After intense studies and a long\u2010lasting debate, it is generally accepted that the prototypic HFV isolate is of chimpanzee origin and that all documented FV infections of men are most likely zoonotically derived from non\u2010human primates (NHP), (Herchenr\u00f6der et al., 1994; Heneine et al., 1998). Whereas the zoonotic potential of SFVs from NHPs is under current investigation, little is presently known about the zoonotic potential of FVs from farm and live\u2010stock animals and pets. As especially in the northern hemisphere contact to the bovine, feline and equine FVs (BFV, FFV, EFV) is far more likely, the potential of corresponding zoonoses will be discussed after a brief summary of the biology of FVs.",

            "text": "Like HIV and HTLV, FV are complex retroviruses in terms of their genetic make\u2010up, their strategies of gene expression and their interactions with the infected hosts and the host cells (Fig. 1, L\u00f6chelt, 2003). However, besides these apparent similarities, FVs have several unique features that set them clearly apart from the classical oncoretroviruses and the lentiviruses and they even show striking similarities to the replication strategy of reverse\u2010transcriptase (RT)\u2010encoding hepadnaviruses, such as the hepatitis B virus (Rethwilm, 2003). The genome of FVs is a linear plus\u2010strand RNA ranging from 11 to 13 kb and thus one of the largest among retroviruses. In addition to the gag, pol and env genes and the regulatory elements located in both LTRs which are common to all retroviruses, the FV genome contains up to three additional open reading frames (bel1 to bel3) that are expressed predominantly by the internal promoter (IP) localized in the env gene (Fig. 1, summarized in L\u00f6chelt, 2003). The presence of a functionally active and essential IP is a distinguishing feature of FVs (L\u00f6chelt et al., 1993). Both FV promoters, the LTR\u2010promoter and the IP require the expression of the Bel1 post\u2010transcriptional transactivator for high\u2010level gene expression and infectivity. The IP has, in comparison with the LTR promoter, a higher basal activity and a higher affinity for Bel1. Thus, after integration of the FV provirus into the host cell genome, the basal activity of the IP leads to the expression of Bel1 that in turn trans\u2010activates the IP. When the level of Bel1 reaches a critical threshold, transactivation of the LTR\u2010promoter occurs, leading to the expression of the viral structural and enzymatic proteins and the synthesis of the viral genomic RNA (Meiering and Linial, 2002). This switch in promoter utilization allows a temporal shift in viral gene expression of early regulatory and late structural proteins. In HIV and HTLV, this temporal shift in protein expression is because of the regulatory proteins Rev and Rex, respectively (Cullen, 1992).",

In addition, FV Gag\u2010processing differs from all other retroviruses as the different Gag domains in released particles are not separated by the viral protease, only a C\u2010terminal cut removing a 4 kDa\u2010peptide is clearly established (Enssle et al., 1997; Zemba et al., 1998). Thus, only two large Gag proteins are detectable in infected cells and released virions paralleling the situation in hepadnaviruses but not in the other retroviruses. The functions of internal, low efficiency cuts in Gag are presently unclear (Fig. 1; Pfrepper et al., 1999).",

As no Gag\u2010Pol fusion protein is formed, Pol must be specifically incorporated into newly formed virions (L\u00f6chelt and Fl\u00fcgel, 1996). Furthermore, the FV Pol precursor is incompletely cleaved leading to the unique situation in FVs of a protease (PR)\u2013 RT fusion protein detectable in infected cells and virions (Pfrepper et al., 1998).",

Within an FV species, the genomes are highly conserved (even after zoonotic transmission) showing only minute genetic variation (Schweizer et al., 1999; Phung et al., 2001).

The large range of cells permissive for FV infections probably reflects the ubiquity of the viral receptor. In cell cultures FVs are often highly cytopathic/lytic (Fig. 2d.), however, in defined cells also persistent, continuous replication without destruction of the host cells has been described (Meiering et al., 2001). In naturally infected hosts, FVs cause a life\u2010long persistent infection without obvious disease symptoms (Saib, 2003). Due to this apparently benign persistence in the naturally infected host, FVs are considered a\u2010pathogenic. An association of FFV infection with renal failure in cats has been discussed, however, the relevance of this finding is presently unclear. Although apparently a\u2010pathogenic under natural conditions, FVs possess a significant disease potential as determined in transgenic mice (Aguzzi, 1993). Strong cellular pathology in the form of syncytia development in the brain and neurological symptoms were consistently detectable in these mice (Tschopp et al., 1996). However, transgenic animals can be only considered as an experimental system that may not reflect the authentic situation.",

Reactivities against Gag, Pol, Env and Bet start within weeks after infection, increase with time and remain relatively stable at high levels over long periods indicating that the immune system is constantly or periodically challenged by all viral antigens (Alke et al., 2000). This pattern of reactivity is indicative of a constant viral gene expression probably associated with the continuous production of viral infectivity. In contrast, humoral immunity against lentiviruses is initially directed against Env, and antibodies specific for other viral antigens appear much later. In line with the idea of a productive FV persistence and not a classical viral latency associated with a more or less restricted viral gene expression, free\u2010ranging, naturally FFV\u2010infected cats were always positive for FFV\u2010specific DNA, antibodies and viral infectivity detected by co\u2010cultivation (Winkler et al., 1998).",

At present, no consistent and generally accepted association of the detection of HFV or HFV\u2010specific markers of infection and a defined disease is known although different disorders like Grave's disease, thyreoiditis and others had initially been suggested (Lagaye et al., 1992; Saib et al., 1994; Schweizer et al., 1994). In addition, it has been established by now that the prevalence of the prototypic HFV isolate in the general human population is extremely low in contrast to initial findings implicating geographic differences in its distribution with areas of relatively high incidence.

It was thus assumed that this single HFV isolate is simply the result of a chimpanzee\u2010derived FV contamination of the cell cultures used to propagate the HFV isolate. This interpretation was premature as extensive serological studies using sera from animal caretakers being occupationally exposed to NHPs showed that about 2\u20134% had clear reactivity against HFV whereas markers for zoonotic infection with other simian retroviruses were absent or extremely rare (Heneine et al., 1998; Sandstrom et al., 2000; Brooks et al., 2002). In these and other studies it was shown that zoonotic transmission was possible not only with SFVcpz but also with SFVs from African green monkeys, baboons, gorillas, mandrills and macaques (Heneine et al., 1998; Sandstrom et al., 2000; Brooks et al., 2002; Wolfe et al., 2003). Especially the finding that repeated transmission events of different, genetically and antigenetically distinct SFVs had occurred, clearly settled the point that SFVs possess a considerable zoonotic potential, significantly higher than that of the other NHP retroviruses tested (Heneine et al., 1998). From the known cases it appears that deep bites and possibly infectious saliva from the animals, bush\u2010meat preparation and transplantation of baboon organs resulted in SFV transmissions (Allan et al., 1998; Heneine et al., 1998; Wolfe et al., 2003). The acquired SFVs induce a persistent infection in men with persisting SFV\u2010specific antibodies and the propagation of intact and defective proviral genomes (Callahan et al., 1999).

Thus, zoonotic infection with distantly related SFVs might have escaped detection; only a recently established immuno\u2010blot addresses this question by using a combination of HFV\u2010 and SFV\u2010derived antigens (Hussain et al., 2003). In this context it is worth mentioning that in African hunters, markers of SFV infections have recently been detected indicating that bush meat hunting and butchering may also result in zoonotic transmission of SFVs (Wolfe et al., 2003). Considering the wide\u2010spread use and consumption of bush meat in Central Africa, this part of the world harbours an increased risk of emerging human FVs.

In contrast, in these countries, exposure to the pathogens of companion (horses and cats) or life\u2010stock animals (cattle) is much more likely and potentially affects almost the whole population. The zoonotic risk arises either by contacting FFV\u2010, BFV\u2010 and EFV\u2010infected animals or, alternatively, by food or medical products directly or indirectly derived from the FV\u2010infected hosts. BFV and FFV are highly prevalent in their natural host (between 30 and 70% of the outgrown animals are sero\u2010positive) making contacts between FV\u2010infected animals and human very likely (summarized in Saib, 2003). Presently, no corresponding data for EFV are available.",

Whereas the virus\u2010encoded proteins are the primary targets of the adaptive, humoural and cellular immune systems, the structures determined by the host, for instance the glycosylation pattern and host\u2010derived, virion\u2010associated proteins, are directly identified by mechanisms of innate immunity or by passively adapted cross\u2010reacting immune mechanisms (Burton, 2002). Thus, the risk of zoonotic transmission directly increases with the genetic relatedness of the authentic and novel host. This makes, for instance because of conserved glycosylation patterns, simian to human transmissions far more likely than those from distant species like cat, cattle and horse (Saib, 2003).",

As infectious FFV can be reproducibly recovered from oral swabs of infected cats (Alke et al., 2000), cat bites intrinsically carry the risk of FFV transmission by breaking the intact skin barrier and allowing access to susceptible cells, for instance leukocytes. However, also non\u2010aggressive, social behaviour like licking has been considered to be a route of cat\u2010to\u2010cat spread (Winkler et al., 1999). Two studies enrolling veterinarians and others occupationally exposed to cats did not reveal any hint for a zoonotic transmission of FFV (Winkler et al., 1997; Butera et al., 2000). However, this apparent resistance against transmission may be not as effective in children with a developing immune system or in immuno\u2010compromised individuals. The juvenile exposure to cats and their pathogens has been considered as a risk factor of developing multi\u2010factorial, complex diseases or disease complexes in humans, for instance schizophrenia (Torrey and Yolken, 1995).",

First, spread of BFV is considered to take place predominantly via spread of BFV\u2010containing saliva (summarized in Saib, 2003). For the transmission of BFV, non\u2010aggressive social contacts and inhalation of aerosols (licking or sneezing) have been demonstrated (Johnson et al., 1988) indicating that BFV spread does not depend on aggressive behaviour and biting, thus increasing the probability of zoonotic transmissions. Secondly, milk has been shown to contain FV\u2010like particles and beef and other cattle\u2010derived foodstuff may also contain infectious BFV (summarized in Saib, 2003). In addition, butchering with the associated risk of skin injuries or aerosol production and inhalation may increase the exposure to BFV. Finally, medical products derived from cell cultures supplemented with bovine serum (e.g. viral vectors) or directly cattle\u2010derived therapeutics pose a risk of BFV contamination and thus careful testing and inactivation appears highly mandatory. Similar routes of transmission have been suggested for the transmission of the agent of bovine spongiform encephalopathy to humans (Ludwig et al., 2003).",
