The primary outcome was survival to hospital discharge. Statistical significance was predetermined in reference to a p value of < 0.05.",

Majority of patients were on HAART and most patients had a CD 4 count less than 100. Most patients were on septrin prophylaxis; mechanical ventilation and 36.6% were on vasopressors for septic shock.
