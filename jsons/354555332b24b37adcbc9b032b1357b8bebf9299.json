The diagnosis of HBoV infections has generally relied on amplification of viral genomic DNA from routine respiratory tract specimens [5, 6] . HBoV genomic DNA can be shed (continuously or intermittently) for up to 12 months following acute infections, often at low loads, which complicates epidemiologic studies [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] . Published studies have provided conflicting information on a potential association of HBoV with acute pediatric RTI. While several studies reported an association of HBoV detection with acute otitis media and RTI, including community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), especially in young children, others have found similar detection rates in controls [2, 6, 9, [15] [16] [17] [18] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 168, "end": 171, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 440, "end": 443, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 444, "end": 447, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 448, "end": 451, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 587, "end": 590, "text": "[5,", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 591, "end": 593, "text": "6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 766, "end": 769, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 770, "end": 773, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 774, "end": 777, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 778, "end": 781, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 782, "end": 786, "text": "[10]", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 787, "end": 791, "text": "[11]", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 792, "end": 796, "text": "[12]", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 797, "end": 801, "text": "[13]", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 802, "end": 806, "text": "[14]", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 1153, "end": 1156, "text": "[2,", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 1157, "end": 1159, "text": "6,", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 1160, "end": 1162, "text": "9,", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 1163, "end": 1167, "text": "[15]", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 1168, "end": 1172, "text": "[16]", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 1173, "end": 1177, "text": "[17]", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 1178, "end": 1182, "text": "[18]", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "Importantly, most studies have not differentiated acute infections from prolonged shedding. More recently, it has been suggested that an increased HBoV load in respiratory specimens, viremia, and seroconversion can be used to differentiate acute infections from prolonged shedding [6, 7, 9, [19] [20] [21] [22] . In addition, a recent study in a limited number of children with RTI (n = 133) and asymptomatic controls (n = 28) demonstrated that spliced HBoV capsid messenger RNA (mRNA), as a measure for active viral replication, was more strongly associated with RTI, particularly lower RTI, than detection of HBoV genomic DNA [23] . Similarly, detection of mRNA has been used as a marker for acute infections with other parvoviruses [24] [25] [26] . On the basis of these findings, we hypothesized that spliced viral capsid mRNA produced during active replication may be a better marker than HBoV genomic DNA of acute RTI associated with HBoV infection. In this study, we tested our hypothesis by performing polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis for both spliced capsid mRNA and genomic DNA on nasopharyngeal (NP) and oropharyngeal (OP) swab specimens from 1295 children hospitalized with CAP and 721 children undergoing elective outpatient surgery who were asymptomatic at enrollment (controls).

Even though HBoV prevalence at the Tennessee site was approximately 3-fold lower than at the Utah site, the strength of the association between HBoV and CAP was similar at both sites and consistent across a number of sensitivity analyses. In contrast, detection of HBoV genomic DNA was not significantly associated with CAP after adjustment for age, season, and codetection of other pathogens. While high HBoV DNA load was associated with CAP, there was extensive overlap in viral loads of patients and controls. In contrast, HBoV DNA loads were consistently higher in capsid mRNA-positive children than in capsid mRNA-negative children. The presence of HBoV capsid mRNA, as a sign of active viral replication, may be a better diagnostic target than HBoV DNA for the diagnosis of active infection. Since its identification a decade ago, the etiologic role of HBoV in acute RTI in children has been controversial. Numerous patients with severe or fatal pneumonia have been described in whom HBoV was the sole pathogen detected [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] . However, frequent detection in asymptomatic children and common codetection with other respiratory viruses have led to questions regarding its pathogenic role [6, 9, [36] [37] [38] . Studies linking HBoV with respiratory disease have been criticized for relying on cross-sectional designs, convenience samples, and inadequate control groups and for failing to confidently exclude alternate pathogens as the cause of symptoms [9, 36] . Potential confounders include incomplete matching on age, sampling method and time of year/season, different protocols for testing of other respiratory pathogens, and selection of controls with increased risk for HBoV infection [6, 9, 10, 39, 40] . Much of the controversy is related to difficulties in identifying acute HBoV infections and excluding other potential etiologies. Because HBoV can be shed for up to 12 months and can be reactivated upon infection with other pathogens, detection of genomic HBoV DNA alone is not likely to be suitable to identify acute and clinically relevant infections [6-8, 10, 14, 16, 29, 41] . In this context, in this study the weak association of HBoV DNA in the unadjusted analysis with CAP (OR, 1.4 [95% CI, 1.0-2.0]), which was further attenuated in the adjusted analysis (aOR, 1.2 [95% CI, .6-2.4]), is consistent with the prior literature and demonstrates the limitations of viral DNA as target.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1054, "end": 1058, "text": "[29]", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 1059, "end": 1063, "text": "[30]", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 1064, "end": 1068, "text": "[31]", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 1069, "end": 1073, "text": "[32]", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}, {"start": 1074, "end": 1078, "text": "[33]", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}, {"start": 1079, "end": 1083, "text": "[34]", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 1084, "end": 1088, "text": "[35]", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}, {"start": 1250, "end": 1253, "text": "[6,", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 1254, "end": 1256, "text": "9,", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 1257, "end": 1261, "text": "[36]", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}, {"start": 1262, "end": 1266, "text": "[37]", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}, {"start": 1267, "end": 1271, "text": "[38]", "ref_id": "BIBREF38"}, {"start": 1516, "end": 1519, "text": "[9,", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 1520, "end": 1523, "text": "36]", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}, {"start": 1754, "end": 1757, "text": "[6,", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 1758, "end": 1760, "text": "9,", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 1761, "end": 1764, "text": "10,", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 1765, "end": 1768, "text": "39,", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}, {"start": 1769, "end": 1772, "text": "40]", "ref_id": "BIBREF40"}, {"start": 2128, "end": 2153, "text": "[6-8, 10, 14, 16, 29, 41]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "Detection of viremia, seroconversion, and high viral loads have been proposed as alternate approaches to assessing the impact of HBoV detection; each method has limitations.

In a small study, Christensen et al detected HBoV capsid mRNA in the respiratory tract of 33 of 133 HBoV DNA-positive children with RTI but 0 of 28 HBoV DNA-positive asymptomatic children, suggesting capsid mRNA may be a marker of acute symptomatic infection [23] . Serial testing of a single patient demonstrated that viral capsid mRNA was detectable only during acute infection (ie, within 10 days of onset of symptoms), while HBoV genomic DNA persisted for an additional period of approximately 6 weeks. Studies with other parvoviruses (ie, human parvovirus B19 and canine parvovirus type 2) also indicated that capsid mRNA detection might be a marker for incident infections [24] [25] [26] . Our results support this notion, demonstrating a strong association of HBoV capsid mRNA with CAP, especially in children who tested negative for a large battery of other respiratory pathogens. In contrast to the earlier study of HBoV capsid mRNA, the present study is much larger, includes parallel testing for HBoV DNA and capsid mRNA, and used combined nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swab specimens. In the present study, all patients had radiographically confirmed CAP, and controls were surveyed for the development of respiratory symptoms in the weeks following specimen collection. Consistent with acute infection, detection of HBoV capsid mRNA was also correlated with higher viral DNA loads in both the present and previous studies ( Figure 3C ) [48] .

As a result, cross-detection of HBoV DNA is almost eliminated (Figure 1 ). Performance of HBoV capsid mRNA detection tests could be further improved to eliminate cross-detection of viral DNA and optimize analytical and clinical sensitivity. Although we used a multisite design, controls were only available from 2 of the EPIC study sites and were not enrolled during the entire study period. We performed sensitivity analyses that demonstrated that these limitations did not bias results. Controls were older than children with CAP, but we adjusted for this in the analysis. In future studies, age-matched controls will help further reduce the potential confounding effect of age. Children were enrolled in the EPIC study during a 30-month period so that this study only covered 3 respiratory seasons. Despite the size of the EPIC study, we only detected 27 patients with HBoV mRNA (2.1% prevalence), potentially leading to small-samplesize bias (for comparison, the prevalences of other respiratory viruses in EPIC were 28% for respiratory syncytial virus, 27% for rhinovirus, 13% for metapneumovirus, 11% for adenovirus, 7% for parainfluenza virus, 7% for influenza virus, and 5% for coronavirus).
