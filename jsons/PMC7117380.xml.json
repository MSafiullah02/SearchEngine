            "text": "\nNidoviruses are important pathogens of both humans and livestock; they are enveloped, plus-strand RNA viruses comprising the families Arteriviridae and Coronaviridae (Gorbalenya et al., 2006). Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), a member of the family Arteriviridae (Snijder et al., 2013), has been a major threat to the worldwide swine industry since its discovery in the early 1990s (Wensvoort et al., 1991, Collins et al., 1992). In 2006, a highly pathogenic porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (HP-PRRSV) emerged and prevailed in mainland China, resulting in devastating damage to swine production (Tian et al., 2007). Currently, HP-PRRSV causes high morbidity and high mortality in infected pigs of all ages and has remained a major threat to the swine producers in China and surrounding countries (Han et al., 2017). Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), a member of the genus Alpha-coronavirus (Song and Park, 2012), was first identified in the 1980s in China (Xuan et al., 1984). PEDV causes a contagious intestinal disease called porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED), which is characterized by vomiting, diarrhea, and dehydration (Wang et al., 2016). In October 2010, a large-scale outbreak of PED caused by a PEDV variant occurred in China, resulting in tremendous economic losses (Li et al., 2012, Wang et al., 2013, Wang et al., 2016, Tian et al., 2014). PRRSV and PEDV are highly virulent and contagious porcine pathogens that cause respiratory and enteric disease in pigs and result in significant economic losses for the intensive pig production worldwide (Li et al., 2012, Snijder et al., 2013, Wang et al., 2016).",

The viral proteases involved in polyprotein cleavage are papain-like proteases (PL1pro and PL2pro) and a 3CL serine protease (PRRSV nsp4; 3CLSP)/3C-like (PEDV nsp5; 3CL) protease (Tian et al., 2009, Ye et al., 2016). During replication, the PL1pro and PL2pro proteases cleave the N-proximal region of pp1a/pp1ab, and the 3CLSP/3CL protease cleaves the viral polyprotein at other conserved inter-domain junctions (Tian et al., 2009, Ye et al., 2016). The viral 3CLSP/3CL proteases play an essential role in artertivirus and coronavirus replication; therefore, they have received much attention as potential key antiviral targets (including TGEV, FIPV, IBV and SARS-CoV) (Anand et al., 2002, Kim et al., 2013, Lee et al., 2007, Xue et al., 2008).",

Moreover, current commercial vaccination approaches against PRRSV and PEDV are only partially effective (Wang et al., 2016, Du et al., 2017a, Du et al., 2017b). To date, effective broad-spectrum antiviral drugs for PRRSV and PEDV infections are not available, although antiviral compounds have been reported previously (Karuppannan et al., 2012, St John et al., 2016, Evans et al., 2017). This remains an impediment to identifying new inhibitors that target the PRRSV and PEDV 3CLSP/3CL proteases for use as antiviral therapies during disease epidemics. In this study, our findings provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying 3CLSP or 3CL protease-mediated inhibition of viral replication and may also guide the development of new broad-spectrum antiviral drugs.",

Therefore, the potential binding sites were analyzed in detail using molecular simulations to dock compounds 2 and 3 into the PRRSV 3CLSP and PEDV 3CL protease structures (Fig. 5\nA and B). The complex models were initially positioned based on the X-ray structures (Streptomyces griseus proteinase E, SGPE, PDB code: 1HPG; PEDV nsp5: 4ZUH) (Nienaber et al., 1993, Ye et al., 2016). Grid maps of 40 \u00d7 40 \u00d7 40 grid points, centered on the substrates of the complex structures, covered the binding pockets. A population size of 150, mutation rate of 0.02, and crossover rate of 0.8 were set as the parameters. Simulations were performed using up to 2.5 million energy evaluations with a maximum of 27,000 generations. Each simulation was performed 100 times, yielding 256 docked conformations. The lowest energy conformations were regarded as the binding conformations between the ligands and the proteins (Wei et al., 2008).

Meanwhile, to elucidate the binding mechanism of compounds and 3CLSP or 3CL proteases, we simulated the most likely binding conformations using Autodock 4 software. In the 3CLSP and 3CL protease, the S1 specificity pocket is essential for recognition of the side chain of the substrate P1 residue and determination of the enzyme\u2019s preference (Tian et al., 2009, Ye et al., 2016). Hence, the residues of S1 specificity pockets were selected as targets for molecule docking. A total of 256 binding conformations between the ligands and the proteins were obtained, and the lowest energy conformations were used for further analysis. As shown in Fig. 5A and B, compounds 2 and 3 are illustrated as sticks, and the amino acid residues contacting the compounds are shown as lines. Because there is a significant difference in the residues of S1 specificity pockets between PRRSV nsp4 and PEDV nsp5, compounds 2 and 3 were docked into 3CLSP and 3CL protease with different conformations and interactions (Fig. 5A and B). Besides, due to the semi-flexible docking was performed, the binding conformations of compounds 2 and 3 with 3CLSP or 3CL protease also exists subtle differences. Nonetheless, their interactions are highly similar (Fig. 5A and B). Otherwise, previous studies have shown that the substrate-binding sites and active sites of the 3CLSP and 3CL protease are located between domains I and II in their structures (Tian et al., 2009, Ye et al., 2016). The amino acid residue His39 in 3CLSP (corresponding to His41 of 3CL protease) plays a vital role in substrate combination and catalysis. Indeed, our docking analysis results suggested that compounds 2 and 3 bind in the substrate channel between domains I and II, which form strongly hydrophobic interactions and hydrogen bonds with His39 (or His41) (Fig. 5A). Hence, compounds 2 and 3 would be broad competitive inhibitors and bind in the substrate-binding channel of the 3CLSP and 3CL protease, replacing the substrate.",

            "text": "Additionally, our results showed that compounds 2 and 3 could effectively inhibit the replication of PRRSV and PEDV at a micromolar range. Unfortunately, their EC50 values were high (>50 \u03bcM), and the selectivity index (SI) values were less than 10 (Fig. 3, Fig. 4; Table 1). As lead compounds, compounds 2 and 3 have a low molecular weight (<250 Da) (Table S1). Thus, further medicinal chemistry optimization is available to increase the selectivity index and pharmacokinetic properties (DMPK). Moreover, the substrate-binding channel of the 3CLSP or 3CL protease is a large cavity, supplementary studies may need to more accurately characterize the compound-binding sites to design and optimize inhibitors. For Norwalk virus and feline coronavirus, the transition state 3C-like protease inhibitors were designed and synthesized, and exhibited notable inhibitory effects against viral replication (Tiew et al., 2011, Kim et al., 2013). Therefore, transition state compounds that will optimally generate hydrophobic interactions and hydrogen bonds with the side chain amino acid residues are needed, and animal studies should also be conducted to develop antiviral drugs against PRRSV and PEDV in the future. Finally, our results emphasize the feasibility of developing anti-PRRSV and anti-PEDV inhibitors as a new class of broad-spectrum antiviral drugs as a treatment for exposure to viral agents.",

Moreover, compounds 2 and 3 exhibited broad-spectrum antiviral activities, which target the PEDV 3CL protease and inhibit PEDV replication.
