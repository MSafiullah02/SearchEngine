Donor RNAs were transcribed using T7 polymerase and transfected into feline cells (AK-D) previously infected with fMHV-JHM (a recombinant MHV strain encoding the feline surface (S) glycoprotein). fMHV-JHM does not infect murine cells, but recombinant virus expressing the MHV S protein does, allowing for efficient selection of recombinant virus on 17Cl-1 murine cells.

Using a previously described motif for peptides binding to the I-Ab molecule,32 we identified a tyrosine at position 135 of the M protein as a likely anchor residue for binding to the MHC class II molecule. In preliminary experiments, we showed that a peptide containing the Y135Q change was no longer recognized by CD4 T cells harvested from the CNS of mice acutely infected with JHMV. This mutation was introduced into JHMV to create a recombinant virus, rJ.MY135Q, as described in Materials and Methods and Figure 1. Two independent isolates were identified, and the presence of the mutation was confirmed by sequence analysis after amplification in tissue culture cells. To confirm the loss of recognition of the epitope in the context of infectious virus, lymphocytes were harvested from the CNS of mice inoculated with wild-type recombinant virus (rJ) or rJ.MY135Q and analyzed for interferon-\u03b3 (IFN-\u03b3) production after stimulation with peptide M133 (Figures 2, A and B; Table 1). As expected, rJ but not rJ.MY135Q elicited an epitope M133-specific CD4 T-cell response. Furthermore, mice infected with rJ.MY135Q did not mount a de novo CD4 T-cell response to the variant M133 epitope (Figure 2B, right panel).",

In agreement with previous results,21 all mice infected with rJ developed encephalitis and died at days 6 to 8 p.i. By contrast, mice infected with rJ.MY135Q developed signs of mild disease, with transient hunching. No mice inoculated with rJ.MY135Q died, and mice were completely asymptomatic when sacrificed at day 16 p.i. (Figure 4A). Mice infected with rJ showed significant weight loss, whereas, consistent with the clinical signs, rJ.MY135Q-infected mice did not lose weight (Figure 4B). These differences in clinical disease could not be attributed to varying virus loads because titers in the CNS of mice infected with rJ and rJ.MY135Q were indistinguishable when analyzed at days 3 to 7 p.i. (Figure 4C). By day 12 p.i., virus was cleared from some rJ.MY135Q-infected mice and present at low levels in the remainder. Virus was cleared from all mice by day 16 p.i. Furthermore, the brains of mice infected with rJ or rJ.MY135Q all showed evidence of severe encephalitis, with widespread parenchymal and perivascular inflammatory cell infiltration detected at day 7 p.i. (Figure 5, A and B). To begin to quantify the inflammatory response, we measured the numbers of CD4 and CD8 T cells, macrophages/microglia, and neutrophils in the brains of mice infected with rJ or rJ.MY135Q at 5 or 7 days p.i. (Figure 5, E and F). CD4 T cells facilitate optimal macrophage infiltration into the CNS, and both macrophages and neutrophils contribute to enhanced disease in the CNS.13,35,36 However, similar numbers of T cells, macrophages, and neutrophils were present in the CNS of mice infected with either virus, demonstrating that the absence of an immune response to epitope M133 did not impair infiltration of these cells into the CNS. Another possible explanation for our results was that rJ and rJ.MY135Q spread to different anatomical sites in the brain after intranasal inoculation, resulting in differences in clinical disease. However, we observed that rJ and rJ.MY135Q spread to the same regions of the CNS (eg, olfactory bulb and tract, primary olfactory cortex, basal forebrain, lateral hypothalamus, and brainstem reticular formation3) and similar numbers of cells were infected within each of these regions, as assessed by immunohistochemical detection of virus antigen (Figure 5, C and D).",

If the absence of the CD4 T-cell response to this immunodominant epitope was critical, restoration of epitope M133 or an equivalent one should result in a virus with increased pathogenicity. For this purpose, another set of recombinant viruses was engineered, in which the I-Ab-restricted CD4 T-cell epitope from L. monocytogenes was introduced into gene 4 (rJ.MY135Q.LLO190), as described in Materials and Methods and Figure 1. Exogenous genetic information is commonly engineered into gene 4 because abrogation of gene 4 expression does not diminish neurovirulence in mice.21 As expected, mice infected with this virus mounted a CD4 T-cell response to epitope LLO190 but not to epitope M133 (Figure 2C; Table 1). Next, we infected a group of B6 mice with this virus, in parallel with rJ and rJ.MY135Q. As shown in Figure 4A, approximately 50% of the rJ.MY135Q.LLO190-infected mice died within 12 days p.i., and mice infected with this virus exhibited weight loss (Figure 4B). Virus titers were similar to those observed in mice infected with rJ or rJ.MY135Q, although they were significantly lower at day 7 p.i. (P < 0.005) (Figure 4C). Thus, the CD4 T-cell response to epitope LLO190 substituted for the response to epitope M133 in mediating severe clinical disease.",

The CD4 T-cell response in BALB/c mice (H-2d haplotype) is primarily directed at epitopes located within the nucleocapsid (N) and S proteins,37,38 and epitopes LLO190 and M133 are not recognized in this strain of mice. The absence of epitope M133 should not result in an attenuated infection when BALB/c mice are infected with rJ.MY135Q, and consequently, rJ-, rJ.MY135Q-, and rJ.MY135Q.LLO190-infected BALB/c mice should develop encephalitis of equivalent severity. Infection with rJ.MY135Q or rJ.MY135Q.LLO190 caused similar mortality and weight loss in BALB/c mice, although mortality was less than in rJ-infected animals. Thus, these results showed that the presence of epitope LLO190 did not change the outcome in mice in which this epitope was not recognized. The lower mortality observed in rJ.MY135Q- or rJ.MY135Q.LLO190-infected mice, when compared with mice infected with rJ, suggested that rJ.MY135Q and rJ.MY135Q.LLO190 were slightly attenuated. As another approach to measuring virus attenuation, we infected RAG1\u2212/\u2212 mice with rJ, rJ.MY135Q or rJ.MY135Q.LLO190 (Figure 6E). In the absence of an adaptive immune response, all three viruses caused lethal acute encephalitis with similar kinetics, suggesting that any attenuation caused by the MY135Q mutation was modest. Regardless, this attenuation, which may be related to the modest changes in thermostability conferred by the MY135Q mutation (Figure 3B), did not mask the pathogenic effect of epitope LLO190-specific CD4 T cells in rJ.MY135Q.LLO190-infected B6 mice (Figure 4, A and B).",

If valid, there should not be a compensatory increase in numbers of CD4 T cells responding to subdominant epitopes in rJ.MY135Q-infected compared with rJ- or rJ.MY135Q.LLO190-infected mice. At least two subdominant CD4 T-cell epitopes, located in the S protein (encompassing residues 333 to 347 and 358 to 372; epitope S333 and S358), are recognized in JHMV-infected B6 mice.14 To determine whether the absence of the epitope M133-specific CD4 T-cell response changed the magnitude of the CD4 T-cell responses to these two epitopes, lymphocytes harvested from the CNS of mice infected with rJ, rJ.MY135Q, and rJ.MY135Q.LLO190 were analyzed in intracellular cytokine assays. As shown in Figure 7A and Table 2, we detected equivalent or diminished responses to epitopes S333 and S358 in rJ.MY135Q or rJ.MY135Q.LLO190 mice compared with rJ-infected mice, showing that a compensatory increase in the CD4 T-cell response to these subdominant epitopes did not occur. We also compared the total number of CD4 T cells responding to known JHMV-specific CD4 T-cell epitopes. Not surprisingly, given the lack of compensatory increase in numbers of epitope S333- and epitope S358-specific CD4 T cells in rJ.MY135Q-infected mice, the number of virus-specific CD4 T cells was significantly lower in rJ.MY135Q-infected mice when compared with mice infected with rJ or rJ.MY135Q.LLO190 (Figure 7B) (P < 0.0001 and P = 0.011, respectively).",

The number of CNS-derived CD8 T cells responding to epitope S510 (the immunodominant epitope recognized in B6 mice, encompassing residues 510 to 518 of the S glycoprotein27,40) was determined by staining with MHC class I/S510 tetramers. Equivalent numbers of epitope S510-specific CD8 T cells were detected in the CNS of mice infected with rJ or rJ.MY135Q (Figure 8A). To assess the effector function of these cells, we measured cytokine production and cytolytic activity directly ex vivo. After peptide S510 stimulation and intracellular IFN-\u03b3 staining, we detected similar numbers of epitope-specific CD8 T cells in the CNS of mice infected with rJ, rJ.MY135Q, or rJ.MY135Q.LLO190 (Figure 8B; Table 2). Furthermore, equivalent fractions of epitope S510-specific CD8 T cells in the CNS of rJ- or rJ.MY135Q-infected mice, as identified by IFN-\u03b3 staining, also expressed TNF-\u03b1 (Figure 8C). Additionally, CD8 T cells isolated from rJ- or rJ.MY135Q-infected mice all exhibited similar levels of cytolytic activity against peptide S510-coated targets in direct ex vivo assays (Figure 8, D and E). In these assays, cytolytic activity was normalized to a per cell basis using Db/S510 tetramer staining.",

This strain of LM is cleared by 7 days after inoculation 42. The number of CD4 T cells responding to LLO190 is greatly increased in LM-immune mice compared with na\u00efve mice, because 3 to 4% of splenic CD4 T cells respond to the epitope at the peak of primary LM infection.43 Consequently, LM-immune mice are expected to mount a robust CD4 T-cell response to epitope LLO190, expressed by rJ.MY135Q.LLO190 but not by rJ. Four weeks after immunization with LM, mice were infected with rJ or rJ.MY135Q.LLO190. As shown in Figure 6, C and D, the presence of LLO190-specific memory CD4 T cells protected mice from infection with rJ.MY135Q.LLO190 but not rJ. Mice infected with rJ.MY135Q.LLO190 exhibited some weight loss (Figure 6D) but developed only minor clinical signs of disease. The slight prolongation in survival time observed in rJ-infected LM-immune mice compared with rJ-infected na\u00efve B6 mice likely occurred because mice were inoculated with virus at 9 weeks of age (28 days after infection with LM) in this experiment. By contrast, in the experiments described above, mice were infected when they were 5 to 6 weeks old. In summary, these results show that virus-specific memory CD4 T cells, unlike na\u00efve T cells, are protective in mice with acute encephalitis and do not mediate enhanced disease.",

An alternative explanation is that anti-JHMV CD4 T cells in the CNS of rJ.MY135Q-infected mice show a preferential Th2-type anti-inflammatory response. To examine this possibility, CNS-derived lymphocytes were prepared from B6 mice infected with rJ or rJ.MY135Q at 7 days p.i. and analyzed for expression of two representative Th1/Th2 cytokines (IFN-\u03b3 and IL-5). ELISPOT and intracellular cytokine assays were performed after stimulation with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 mAb or with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) (50 ng/ml) and ionomycin (500 ng/ml), respectively. Anti-CD3/anti-CD28 or PMA/ionomycin stimulation was used in these experiments to detect cytokine expression by all CD4 T cells in the infected CNS not just secretion by cells responding to known JHMV-specific CD4 T-cell epitopes. Most CNS-derived CD4 T cells expressed IFN-\u03b3 after PMA/ionomycin stimulation when measured by intracellular cytokine assay (data not shown). No IL-5-secreting CD4 T cells could be detected by intracellular cytokine assay after stimulation with PMA/ionomycin, when four rJ-infected and five rJ.MY135Q-infected mice were analyzed. However, using the more sensitive ELISPOT assay, we detected low but equivalent numbers of IL-5-secreting CD4 T cells in the CNS of mice infected with either rJ or rJ.MY135Q (rJ: 19.2 of 10,000; range, 13.7 to 24.8; two mice) (rJ.MY135Q: 20.9 of 10,000 \u00b1 6.9, n = 5). Furthermore, each responding cell secreted approximately the same amount of IL-5 because spot size was equivalent in all samples. Thus, it is unlikely that change to a Th2-type response is responsible for the mild clinical disease observed in rJ.MY135Q-infected mice.",

We detected similar levels of TNF-\u03b1 mRNA in the CNS of mice infected with rJ or rJ.MY135Q (Figure 9A).

Abrogation of the response to the immunodominant M133 epitope resulted in amelioration of clinical disease, in the absence of any effect on the kinetics of virus clearance (Figure 4). The mutation in the M protein resulted in a small change in virus thermostability (Figure 3B), which may have contributed to the lower mortality that we detected in rJ.MY135Q- or rJ.MY135Q.LLO190-infected compared with rJ-infected BALB/c mice (Figure 6A). However, this change did not account for the lack of lethality observed in rJ.MY135Q-infected B6 mice because the introduction of RNA encoding an exogenous CD4 T-cell epitope (LLO190) into the genome of rJ.MY135Q resulted in restoration of severe disease. Furthermore, RAG1\u2212/\u2212 mice died with similar kinetics when infected with rJ, rJ.MY135Q, or rJ.MY135Q.LLO190.",

Mice chronically infected with another neurotropic virus, Theiler\u2019s murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV), develop a Th1-type CD4 T cell-mediated demyelinating disease, but disease is ameliorated when mice are infected with a variant TMEV that encodes a mutated CD4 T-cell epitope; infection with this variant results in a predominant Th2-type response and low pathogenicity.47 In another example, mice immunized with vaccinia virus expressing the G protein (VV-G) of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and subsequently infected with wild-type RSV develop immune-mediated respiratory disease.48 A single immunodominant RSV-specific CD4 T-cell epitope and no CD8 T-cell epitopes are present within the G protein, and immunization with VV-G induces an exaggerated Th2-type response to this epitope. In this case, unlike TMEV-infected mice, a Th2-type CD4 T-cell response is immunopathological. However, differential induction of Th1/Th2 responses is unlikely to explain our results because most cells in the CNS of mice infected with rJ or rJ.MY135Q express IFN-\u03b3, and few express IL-5, a Th2-type cytokine. Our results are also not likely to be explained by intrinsic differences between the different JHMV-specific CD4 T-cell epitopes because epitope M133, present in rJ, and epitopes S333 and S358, present in both rJ and rJ.MY135Q, exhibited similar functional avidity as measured in proliferation assays.14",

The number of virus-specific CD4 T cells was significantly lower in the CNS of rJ.MY135Q-infected B6 mice than in mice infected with rJ or rJ.MY135Q.LLO190 (Figure 7B). Support for the notion that disease occurs when numbers of virus-specific CD4 T cells are elevated comes from a study of a variant of lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) that lacked one of two immunodominant CD4 T-cell epitopes.49 Mice infected with variant but not wild-type LCMV mounted a robust anti-virus neutralizing antibody response and cleared virus more efficiently. More anti-LCMV neutralizing antibody was also produced in mice infected with wild-type LCMV if CD4 T cells were partially and transiently depleted with anti-CD4 antibody before infection. Our results, like those of Recher et al, show that a less robust CD4 T-cell response may result in less immunopathological disease without diminishing the kinetics of virus clearance. They support the notion that this is primarily a quantitative effect (Figure 7B).",

            "text": "How could a difference in numbers of JHMV-specific CD4 T cells affect morbidity and mortality? CD4 T cells are required for optimal CD8 T-cell effector function in the JHMV-infected CNS,39 and it is possible that fewer numbers of fully active anti-JHMV CD8 T cells could result in diminished immunopathogenic disease. However, we detected similar numbers of epitope S510-specific CD8 T cells in the CNS of mice infected with rJ or rJ.MY135Q when measured by tetramer staining, cytokine secretion, or cytolytic activity (Figure 8). An attractive possibility is that virus-specific CD4 T cells express one or more products that have pathogenic effects; these effects become apparent when the numbers of cells exceed a certain level. We investigated TNF-\u03b1 as a candidate molecule because TNF-\u03b1 production by CD4 T cells, unlike CD8 T cells, does not cease after prolonged exposure to antigen43 and T-cell expression of this cytokine correlates with pathogenicity in other virus infections. For example, TNF-\u03b1 produced by virus-specific CD8 T cells is the principal mediator of clinical illness in mice infected with RSV; administration of anti-TNF-\u03b1 antibody resulted in significantly attenuated illness with only slight effects on the kinetics of virus clearance.50 However, we detected no differences in TNF-\u03b1 mRNA levels in the brains of mice infected with rJ, rJ.MY135Q, or rJ.MY135Q.LLO190 (Figure 9A) and no differences in the proportion of JHMV-specific CD4 T cells harvested from mice infected with rJ, rJ.MY135Q, or rJ.MY135Q.LLO190 that secreted TNF-\u03b1 after stimulation with JHMV-specific peptide (Figure 9B). Of note, TNF-\u03b1 may still have localized effects at sites of CD4 T-cell accumulation. Because TNF-\u03b1 is involved in the regulation of multiple functions in the CNS, including thermoregulation, appetite, and the development of seizures,51\u201354 differential localized expression by CD4 T cells may directly effect the development of clinical signs or may trigger the expression of secondary pro-inflammatory mediators.",

An immunopathological component has been identified in several chronic human and animal CNS infections, including humans infected with HIV-1 and mice infected with JHMV or Theiler\u2019s encephalomyelitis virus.1,55 However, the rapidly fatal outcomes observed in some patients with acute viral encephalitis are generally attributed to direct virus destruction of infected cells. Our results show that the T-cell response, in the setting of a large number of infected target cells, may also contribute to disease, even at relatively early times after infection. Consequently, our results suggest that modulation of the numbers of anti-virus CD4 T cells responding to a single epitope may attenuate disease without adversely affecting virus clearance.",
