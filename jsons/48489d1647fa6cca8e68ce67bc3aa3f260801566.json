The virus that causes PRRS is understood to survive transmission through the atmosphere in greater numbers when atmospheric conditions are cool, damp, or cloudy [2] . Long-term changes in climate and their influences on infectious disease outbreaks vary by route of transmission and are highly uncertain [3] . While increasing vector populations with increasing annual average temperature and precipitation could increase vector-borne transmission, the influences of changing meteorological conditions on airborne transmission of pathogens are unclear.",

            "text": "In contexts where humans or animals move freely, the potential for disease transmission through direct contact is greater, reducing the importance of airborne transmission and greatly limiting the utility of airborne pathogen inactivation. However, where airborne transmission is or is suspected of being an important transmission route, few mitigation technologies exist. Disinfection by UV irradiation requires UV doses involving a combination of radiative fluxes and exposure times that have been established [4] , which are difficult to implement in air. Upper-room UV irradiation relies on natural air circulation patterns within a room to transport airborne pathogens into the illumination zone of a wall-mounted, upward facing UV fixture near the ceiling. Upper room UV was proven effective in reducing TB transmission in hospital wards [5] and rubella transmission within army barracks [6] . UV germicidal irradiation (UVGI) directs UV radiation onto conventional particulate filters within ventilation systems to inactivate bacteria and viruses captured on the filter surfaces [7] ; however, viruses and bacteria that migrate into the filter media or that are shielded from the UV source as subsequent particles are collected, are inactivated with lower efficiencies [7] . The US EPA concludes that there is insufficient evidence, and no standard test procedures, for assessing UVGI performance and that UVGI provides virtually no additional protection over the use of conventional HEPA filtration alone [8] . Conventional filtration presents several drawbacks, including the low fluid permeability needed for high particle collection efficiency, which inherently increases the differential pressure across the filter and promotes infiltration of untreated air into indoor spaces at partial vacuum. In buildings not constructed to an air-tight standard, this can lead to high costs of building reconstruction and retrofit.",

            "text": "Two factors govern the potential for disease transmission of airborne pathogens such as viruses and bacteria: aerosol transport and aerosol infectivity [9] . UV radiation alone only addresses aerosol infectivity and particle filtration only addresses aerosol transport. Unlike filtration and UV irradiation, non-thermal plasmas (NTPs) can address both transport (by charge-driven filtration) and infectivity (by reaction with reactive plasma species) of airborne pathogens. NTP is a result of electrical discharges within a neutral gas under atmospheric conditions and mainly consists of electrons, ions, and radicals. Unlike thermal plasma, where all constituents are in thermal equilibrium, a NTP in comparison is always in a state of non-equilibrium because the electrons with very light masses can reach higher temperatures (10 4 -2.5 \u00d7 10 5 K) and attain higher kinetic energy (1-20 eV) than the rest of the NTP constituents, which are heavier and at lower temperatures [10] . On these bases, an NTP is also known as nonequilibrium plasma or cold plasma. A commonly applied NTP reactor type is the dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) reactor. DBD or silent discharge refers to the electrical discharge through a dielectric barrier, such as glass, quartz, or alumina. A high voltage AC source is commonly used in a DBD reactor, because the changing polarity of AC is essential to sustain the electrical discharge in a DBD reactor. The dominant electrical discharge mode in a DBD reactor is microdischarge, which is in a form of filaments with nanosecond lifespan. When the microdischarge reaches a dielectric barrier, the dielectric surface allows for the spreading and accumulation of the charges and thus reduces the electric field until the field is completely quenched. The use of an AC source repeats the cycle by generating microdischarge with a different electrical polarity. In studying the effectiveness of removing air pollutants such as methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE) by NTP, Holzer et al [11] utilized a gaseous plasma generated by a DBD reactor using different dielectric barriers including glass, Al 2 O 3 , and TiO 2 . Kuwahara et al [12] developed a DBD reactor using polyesterlaminated electrodes to evaluate the removal characteristics of odorous compounds, including NH 3 and NH 3 mixed with CH 3 CHO, by NTP. In studying oil mist-to-gas conversion, Park et al [13] developed a DBD reactor using thin copper electrodes (0.05 mm thickness) where each electrode was sandwiched in between by two dielectric plates made of alumina (1 mm thickness).",

            "text": "A packed-bed reactor provides a more efficient way of treating trace air pollutants by adding pellets between the electrodes in a corona reactor or a DBD reactor. A typical air pollutant has a concentration in the range of parts per million by volume (ppmv), so direct interactions between the electrons and air pollutants are usually negligible under ambient conditions [10] . In a packed-bed reactor, the electron-impact reactions serve as the main plasma chemistry for air pollutant decomposition [14] . By packing the pellets, electron generation takes place through partial discharges at the pellet contact points within a packed-bed reactor. More specifically, an external electric field applied between the pellets and the electrodes enables polarization, which in turn induces partial discharges and subsequently the electron-impact reactions. While a packed-bed arrangement can provide evenly distributed flows, it can also lead to a higher pressure drop across the packed-bed. Perovskite pellets, such as BaTiO 3 and Al 2 O 3 are commonly used dielectric materials for packed-bed reactors. The addition of catalytically active materials can further improve the selectivity of a packed-bed reactor. Mizuno et al [15, 16] discovered that a ferroelectric pellet packedbed reactor was not only capable of collecting particles, but also destroying yeast cells. In studying organic solvents (e.g. MTBE, toluene, and acetone), Holzer et al [11] evaluated three packed-bed materials (i.e. glass beads, BaTiO 3 , and PbZrO 3 -PbTiO 3 ) and one catalyst (i.e. LaCoO 3 ) using various cylindrical DBD reactors designs, which showed that the ferroelectric packed-bed reactor using BaTiO 3 pellets significantly increased the conversion of MTBE and toluene to CO x . Kuwahara et al [12] used a ferroelectric packed-bed reactor to study the decomposition of odorous compounds (i.e. NH 3 ) by adding BaTiO 3 pellets to the previously developed DBD reactor, which used polyester-laminated electrodes. The results showed that the DBD reactor with ferroelectric packed-bed pellets could decompose NH 3 at a much faster rate than the DBD reactor alone.",

The aerosol generator is a modified consumergrade cool-mist humidifier (Vicks V5100-N) that piezoelectrically atomizes virus buffer solution containing MS2, a single-stranded RNA bacteriophage. A 10.2 cm (4-inch) ID fan at the end of the apparatus draws ambient air (25%-36% RH) into a flexible duct (8.9 cm (3.5-inch) ID and 4 m (13-ft) length), where mixing occurs between the air and the droplets, allowing for droplet evaporation and thus bioaerosol generation. The droplet evaporation process is further enhanced by the addition of a facility-supplied stream of dry compressed air (<10% RH; figure 1 ). The DBD reactor is powered by one of the two AC voltage amplifiers, namely a variable 0 to 20 kV (peak-to-peak) high voltage amplifier (Trek Model-610E) and a 30 kV neon transformer (France 15030 P5G-2UE ServiceMaster). The variable 0 to 20 kV high voltage amplifier is coupled with a digital function generator (BK Precision Model-4052), which outputs 60 Hz sinusoidal AC voltage. The amplifier can output applied voltage (U) signals at 1 V/1000 V and two current (I) signals, total current and return current, at 1 V/200 \u00b5A, which can be monitored directly by a digital oscilloscope (BK Precision Model-2190D).

The smaller tubes slide freely relative to the larger tube due to a clearance of 0.3 cm (0.125-inch). Two rubber O-rings, which sit in the grooves on the OD of the smaller tube permit an air-tight sliding mechanism. As indicated in figure 2 , a circular perforated brass plate is installed at the end of each sliding tube to serve as the ground electrode and to evenly distribute the inlet and outlet flow of the reactor. The design of the sliding electrode allows for packed bed depth adjustment ranging between 0.6 and 12.7 cm (0.25 and 6 inches). A brass ring (0.9 mm (0.035-inch) thickness, 2.5 cm (1-inch) width) adhered to the OD of the larger Plexiglas tube serves as the high voltage electrode for the AC high voltage supply. Two flow plugs made of styrofoam (6.35 cm (2.5-inch) OD) are positioned at the center of the reactor to direct the airflow with viral aerosols through an annular region in which the plasma is concentrated ( figure 2 ). The DBD reactor utilizes the microdischarge generated through a dielectric barrier made of Plexiglas. The packed-bed, consisting of 500 inert borosilicate glass beads (0.6 cm (0.25-inch) diameter), further enhances the microdischarge by partial discharges at the contact points between the glass beads for effective electron-viral aerosol collisions and inactivation process.",

Each inactivation test involved adding 300 ml (for a 60 min test) or 200 ml (for a 30 min test) of MS2 solution consisting of ~1 \u00d7 10 8 pfu ml \u22121 in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; 0.78 g NaH 2 PO 4 /L, 0.58 g NaCl/L, pH of 7.5) into the ultrasonic humidifier reservoir. The humidifier was set to built-in power level 2 (labeled as H2) and the atomization rate was approximately 117 ml h \u22121 over a 30 min experimental period [21] . The air flow rate through the sampling train was maintained by the ID fan with a viable transformer (Staco Energy 3PN221B). In each test, the ID fan and humidifier were turned on for five minutes until reaching steady state. Then the packed-bed NTP reactor was activated by the selected high voltage supply. An electric vacuum pump (McMaster-Carr model #4176K11) was turned on to draw samples from the air stream near the inner wall of the pipe through the impingers (ACE Glass 7533-13) upstream and downstream of the reactor at 1 LPM, leading to collection of MS2 aerosols in the 20 ml impinger collection fluid (PBS). For inactivation tests with the reactor powered by the 0-20 kV variable amplifier, the sampling time was 30 min. For tests with the 30 kV transformer, the sampling time was 60 min in order to collect a higher number of viable viruses within the impinger installed downstream of the reactor (figure 1). Virus samples were also collected directly from the ultrasonic humidifier reservoir before each trial. Plaque assays and reverse transcriptase quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) assays, both described in detail below, were performed on each sample to determine the concentration of infectious MS2 plaque forming units (pfu/ml) and the concentration of MS2 genome copies (gc/ml) in the PBS collecting solution.",

MS2 was propagated and assayed in its E. coli host using previously published methods [22, 23] . The virus stocks were purified using an Econo Fast Protein Liquid Chromatography system (Bio-Rad, USA) with a HiPrep Sephacryl S-400 HR column (GE, USA). The purified virus fractions were concentrated with 100 kDa Amicon ultracentrifugal filters (Millipore, USA), and finally filter-sterilized with 0.22 \u00b5m PES membrane filters. The final MS2 stocks (~10 11 pfu ml \u22121 were stored in phosphate buffer (5 mM NaH 2 PO 4 and 10 mM NaCl, pH 7.5) at 4 \u00b0C. In the experiments, the detection limit was 10 pfu ml \u22121 since only 100 \u00b5l of a sample was used for each plate. Measurements of system performance. During the experiment, a portable humidity/temperature pen (Traceable 4093) measured the temperature and relative humidity (RH) inside the sampling train upstream of the reactor. An insertable anemometer (Extech 407123) measured the air stream radial velocity profile ~30.5 cm (12-inch) downstream of the reactor. The pressure drops across the packed-bed NTP reactor and the ozone filter were measured by a low-pressure differential gauge (Magnehelic 2300-0). When the reactor was powered by the 0-20 kV variable amplifier, an oscilloscope (BK Precision Model-2190D) monitored the applied voltage and current to the packed-bed NTP reactor, from which the input and discharge power can be calculated. When the reactor was powered by the fixed 30kV transformer, the total input power consumption of the transformer was measured by an electricity power meter (P3 International P4460), and the discharge power was measured by a high voltage probe and a Pearson coil, as discussed in the experimental setup section. To ensure that collected MS2 would not be inactivated in the impinger liquid during sampling, 20 ml of 1 \u00d7 10 6 pfu ml \u22121 MS2-PBS solution was added into the downstream impinger, which was then connected to the downstream sampling port. The packedbed NTP reactor was either inactivated or activated by the 20 kV voltage supply, and the effluent gas from the reactor was bubbled through the impinger liquid for 15, 30 and 45 min, after which the infectious MS2 concentrations in the impinger were assayed. Ozone generated by the packed-bed NTP reactor when energized had the potential to dissolve into sampling liquid in the downstream impinger and inactivate MS2 during and after sample collection. To quench the ozone in solution, 50 mM of anhydrous sodium sulfite (Na 2 SO 3 , Fisher Scientific BP355-500) was added into the downstream 20 ml impinger collection liquid. An ozone sensor (EcoSensors A-21ZX) measured the ozone concentration either upstream of the ozone filter (downstream of the reactor) or downstream of the filter to determine the amount of ozone generated by the packbed NTP reactor at various power and flow rate levels and to examine the removal efficiency of ozone by the ozone filter.",

The pressure difference upstream and downstream of the NTP DBD packed bed measured at the 170 LPM flow rate was 45 Pa, a reasonably low difference due to the high porosity of the packed bed. The ozone filter was also quite porous, with a honeycomb structure that produced a pressure drop of 20 Pa at the flow rate of 170 LPM. The total pressure drop across the system was about 65 Pa at the flow rate of 170 LPM, or 0.38 Pa/LPM. It was estimated that at 170 LPM, the virus exposure time to NTP species was about 0.25 s. Typical applied voltage and current waveforms measured by the oscilloscope are presented in figure 3 , and all voltage and current waveforms at all voltage setups (12 kV, 16 kV, 20 kV and 30 kV) can be found in the supporting information. Two current waveforms were measured: the total current represented the current supplied into the system and was used to calculate input power; the return current represented the current returned to the supply from the ground electrode, and was used to calculate NTP discharge power. When applied voltage increased from 12 kV to 20 kV, the input power increased from 0.5 W to 1.5 W and the discharge power increased from 0.2 W to 0.6 W, 31%-36% of the input power ( figure  4(a) ). Kuwahara et al [12] reported similar differences (76%) between input and discharge power, and two other research reported that 20%-27% of the input power was converted to plasma discharge power in their NTP reactor [24, 25] . With the 0-20 kV variable amplifier, the maximum discharge power in the reactor was 0.56 W (198 J m \u22123 at 170 LPM) at 20 kV. With the fixed 30 kV neon transformer, the actual peak-topeak voltage applied to the reactor was 28 kV and the total input power consumption was ~21 W measured by the commercial power meter. The estimated discharge power was 2.08 W (734 J m \u22123 at 170 LPM), 10% of the input power, according to the high voltage probe and Pearson coil measurements. The estimated discharge power showed a strong exponential correlation with the applied peak-to-peak voltage, no matter which power supply is used ( figure 4(b) ). In future, the V-Q Lissajous method can be applied to more accurately estimate the discharge power with both the 0-20 kV variable amplifier and the 30 kV neon transformer.",

The concentration of infective viruses when the NTP reactor was off proved that bubbling ozone-free air through the impinger for 45 min did not inactivate the MS2 (figure 5). When the reactor was on, a 3 log reduction in the infective MS2 concentration was observed in the impinger solution over the first 15 min. This indicated that when the reactor was activated by 20 kV, the generated ozone dissolved in the impinger liquid and inactivated the sampled MS2. As the goal of these experiments was to inactivate viruses within the reactor and not in the sampling liquid downstream of the reactor, the ozone that dissolved in the downstream impinger liquid was quenched with 50 mM of anhydrous sodium sulfite. According to the measured ozone concentration and the calculated equilibrium dissolved ozone concentration in the impinger liquid (based on Henry's Law), the added sodium sulfite should be sufficient to quench all of the dissolved ozone during the packed-bed NTP inactivation tests.

The qPCR results, which reflect the total number of viruses, suggested a decrease of ~1 log between the humidifier outlet and the upstream impinger and a decrease of ~0.35 log between the upstream and downstream impingers ( figure  6 ). The ~1 log decrease in gene copy concentrations from the humidifier outlet (position 8) to the upstream impinger (position 10), which indicates the loss of total (infectious and inactivated) viruses during atomization, may have several causes, including wall losses along the four-meter-long duct. These impacts are discussed in greater detail in Xia et al [21] . The additional 1.6 log reduction in infectious MS2 concentrations was most likely caused by inactivation during the evaporation process of the atomized MS2-PBS droplets. Based on the qPCR results, the 0.35 log decrease of infectious viruses through the packed bed when the reactor was off was not due to inactivation of viruses in the aerosols and was likely due to physical filtration of the virus by the packed bed.",

Increasing the voltage resulted in an exponential increase in MS2 inactivation by the reactor (figure 7) , when the packed-bed filtration effect (an average of 0.14 log) was subtracted. At an air flow rate of 170 LPM and 12 kV, an infective virus inactivation reduction across the reactor of 0.23 log was observed. This increased to a 0.78 log reduction at 20 kV. Inactivation of infectious agents by chemical oxidants generally follows a Chick-Watson model, as illustrated by the equation below [26, 27] :",

            "text": "where C D and C U are downstream and upstream infectious virus concentrations respectively, C inact is the concentration of the inactivating agent generated by NTP, n is the coefficient of dilution (usually assumed to be 1), t is duration of treatment, and k is a kinetic constant. When the NTP reactor is operating at steady state under steady applied AC voltage, C inact and treatment time t should remain constant. Increasing applied voltage to the NTP reactor increases the concentration of reactive ions and electrons (C inact ) in the plasma, and according to figure 7 and equation (4), C inact should increase exponentially with increasing applied voltage. This assertion, however, needs to be justified in future plasma species measurements and analysis. Increasing the flow rate to 330 LPM, and consequently reducing the treatment time by approximately 50%, had a small impact on inactivation (figure 7), which indicates that the amount of treated air by the reactor can be increased without having a major impact on inactivation efficiency. This may be because that the predominant species inactivating aerosolized MS2 in this study were short-lived radicals rather than long-lived ozone, whose lifetime is at the scale of nanoseconds [28] and would not be affected by the change of second-scale exposure time. Wu et al [18] reported similar limited impact of treatment time on NTP inactivation efficiency. Specifically, the study showed that doubling the treatment time would only cause a 2%-4% further inactivation of waterborne MS2 by plasma gas. Extrapolating the results obtained at 12-20 kV and 170 LPM to 30 kV according to the trendline would yield an estimated 3.5 log reduction, in agreement with the greater than 2 log reduction obtained with the fixed 30 kV neon transformer. In this study, at the flow rate of 170 LPM, the virus exposure time to NTP species was about 0.25 s, and the steady state ozone concentration downstream of the reactor was measured as 0.21 ppm at 20 kV and 2.08 ppm at 30 kV. The ozone dose received by aerosolized MS2 was thereby estimated as 0.0017 min mg m \u22123 at 20 kV and 0.017 min mg m \u22123 at 30 kV (assuming room temperature and pressure). According to Tseng and Li [29] , 90% (1 log) inactivation of airborne MS2 required an ozone dose of 1.28 min mg m \u22123 , which is 75-750 times of the ozone dose provided in this study. It was therefore concluded that ozone acted as a secondary inactivating reagent in this study and that aerosolized MS2 was predominantly inactivated by radicals and other reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated by the packed-bed NTP reactor over the short exposure time.",

When the plasma generation area was reduced by 25%, the reactor's E. coli inactivation efficiency reduced significantly to 29% (0.16 log reduction) [19] . Wu et al applied a 14 kV 10 kHz AC power supply, and at 20 W power level, the reactor achieved ~80% MS2 inactivation (0.9 log reduction) in room air during a 0.12 s treatment time [18] . Both of these studies, however, only reported the reductions of viable bioaerosol concentration after the NTP treatment, and did not separate the inactivation effect of the active plasma species from the physical electrostatic precipitation or filtering effect of the reactor.",

The baseline ozone concentration in the room air was 0.03 ppm. Results suggest that plasma was not established in the reactor and no ozone was produced until the applied V pp exceeded 10 kV (figure 8). Above 10 kV, the ozone concentration downstream of the packed bed and upstream of the ozone filter increased with increasing V pp and decreased due to reduction of NTP discharge energy density (discharge energy per unit volume of the air flow) with increasing air flow rate, as set by the ID fan. When 20 kV AC voltage was applied to the packed-bed NTP reactor and at the 170 LPM flow rate, the highest ozone concentration downstream of the reactor was 0.21 ppm.",

Increasing air flow rates corresponded with decreasing upstream ozone concentrations due to reduction of NTP discharge energy density, and increasing downstream ozone concentrations, likely due to increasing space velocity (defined as volumetric flow rate normalized by filter volume) and thus decreasing filter performance. The much higher supplied power of the 30 kV power supply, as compared to the 20 kV power supply, also produced more ozone, approximately ten times higher at all three flow rate conditions ( figure 9) . This was likely a result of greater oxygen atom radical (O) production at the higher power, which reacted with the available O 2 to form more O 3 [32, 33] . At 170 LPM and 30 kV, the single layer of the activated carbon filter reduced upstream ozone concentrations by 96%; however, the downstream O 3 concentration (0.09 ppm) still exceeded the 0.05 ppm California standard. The addition of a second filter would very likely reduce concentrations below the California standard, with little increase in the pressure drop across the filter (20 Pa at the flow rate of 170 LPM).",

Viral RNA was extracted from 200 \u00b5l MS2 virus samples using Maxwell 16 Viral Total Nucleic Acid Purification Kits (Promega, Madison, WI) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Extracted RNA was eluted using 50 \u00b5l of nuclease-free water. The forward primer (5\u2032-CCGCTACCTT-GCCCTAAAC-3\u2032) and reverse primer (5\u2032-GACGACAAC-CATGCCAAAC-3\u2032) were designed with the Primer3free software (http://primer3.sourceforge.net/) and purchased from ThermoFisher Scientific (Grand Island, NY). Extracted MS2 RNA samples and RNA standards were reverse transcribed and amplified in parallel in an Eppendorf Mastercycler ep realplex Real-time PCR System (Eppendorf, Hauppauge, NY). Each reverse transcription-qPCR reaction was run in 20 \u00b5l of total volume comprising 10 \u00b5l of GoTaq 1-Step Master Mix, 0.4 \u00b5l of RT mix, 0.6 \u00b5l each of 10 \u00b5M forward and reverse primers, 6.4 \u00b5l of nuclease-free water and 2 \u00b5l of RNA sample (Promega, Madison, WI). The following thermocycling conditions were used: 15 min at 40 \u00b0C; 10 min at 95 \u00b0C; and 45 cycles of 95 \u00b0C for 15 s, 60 \u00b0C for 30 s and 72 \u00b0C for 40s, followed by a melting ramp from 68 to 95 \u00b0C, with the temperature held for 45 s at 60 \u00b0C and for 5 s at all subsequent temperatures.",
