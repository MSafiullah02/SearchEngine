Ward beds are no longer available to accommodate routine surgical cases. Those patients requiring postoperative intensive care can no longer have their operations. Operative theaters are rationed, with each case reviewed and approved only by committee. As a result, we are adapting by doing less extensive surgery, even if it may mean worse functional outcomes, and by accepting delays that we would not normally countenance. Other patients are recommended radiation therapy instead of surgery. In some regions, systemic therapy is being considered as a means to delay surgical procedures.",

Many services in regions considered hot spots for COVID-19 have therefore had to reconsider the standard risk\u2013benefit ratio with which we are normally comfortable. They have had to consider hypofractionation radiation therapy regimens to shorten treatment durations, reduce visits and exposure to hospitals, and increase patient throughput. In addition, many have weighed the benefit of concomitant chemotherapy against the significant increase in acute toxicity, potential complications and associated hospital admissions, and the need for more intensive monitoring. As a result, some have opted for the omission of concomitant chemotherapy in the curative setting.",

Does COVID-19 infection increase the risk of complications of surgery? What is the best tracheostomy technique to reduce aerosol generation? Are remote follow-up consultations or no consultations at all safe for patients with head and neck cancer? Who should be prioritized for treatment in the setting of severe shortages of capacity? Should a highly curable patient be prioritized over a palliative patient with symptoms?",

The resulting guidance, endorsed by the American Society for Radiation Oncology, the European Society for Radiotherapy and Oncology, and the Head and Neck Cancer International Group, makes available the considered consensus advice of this international group of experts. The approach used by this guideline has several strengths: the qualitative scientific methodology, the involvement of experts from across the globe, and the consideration of 2 different pandemic scenarios\u2014early risk mitigation and severely reduced resources. Remarkably, the whole process was undertaken in under 2 weeks, a testament to the efforts and commitment of the authors and an example to us all of what can be achieved.",
