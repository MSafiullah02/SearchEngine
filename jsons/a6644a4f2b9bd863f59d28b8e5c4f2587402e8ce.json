For each day k before the change date t, this partial effect was assumed to be the probability that the cases at day k would be reported at or after the change date t. We assumed this onset-to-reporting distribution followed a Gamma distribution and inferred this distribution from the time series of onset and reporting in China by using the convolution of the symptom onset time series and the onset-to-reporting distribution to compute the expected number of reported cases for each day in the epidemic.",
