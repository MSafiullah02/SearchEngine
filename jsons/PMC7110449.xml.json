For instance, in Hajj, one of the largest annual MG events in the world, more than 2 million people attend each year in Makkah, and over 90% suffer from at least one respiratory symptom, the risk of viral respiratory infections increases several folds and more severe respiratory infections such as pneumonia are the leading causes of hospital admission.1, 2, 3 Likewise, a number of influenza outbreaks were reported during the World Youth Day 2008, a large catholic gathering in Sydney.4 MGs are also linked to globalisation of various infections. For instance, the Iztapalapa Play Passion, a religious festival in Mexico, was believed to spark the outbreak of swine flu leading to its accelerated dissemination across the world.5 Therefore, international public health agencies, including World Health Organization (WHO), have issued guidelines on mass gathering preparedness to minimise the possible risks.6\n",

            "text": "From a public health perspective, one of the key concerns is to prevent global spread of respiratory infections during MGs. Interventions like vaccinations against viral and bacterial respiratory infections, anti-influenza prophylaxis and hand hygiene are considered as preventive measures but the measures have limitations. For instance, vaccinations against respiratory infections, such as influenza, are recommended for travellers to MGs such as Hajj,7 and even though a recent systematic review generally supports its effectiveness against laboratory-confirmed influenza at Hajj,8 frequent mismatch between vaccine strains and circulating strains is an important concern.9 Soaring antiviral resistance against both adamantanes and neuraminidase inhibitors is an issue that limits their widespread use in MGs.4, 10 Similarly, while hand hygiene has been recommended as a protective measure for attendees of MGs, its effectiveness is not fully evaluated in a mass gathering setting and the efficacy is debatable.11 Therefore, the role of another protective measure, facemask, should be explored in the prevention of respiratory infections.12 Facemask is believed to have a protective role in preventing nosocomial infections since the time of Spanish influenza.13 Several studies have assessed the usefulness of facemask in household, community and healthcare settings, the findings of which have been summarised in a few reviews.14, 15, 16 Noticeable disparities of facemask effectiveness between these studies were observed. Studies conducted in community or health care settings found facemasks to be generally effective against influenza-like illness (ILI) or even against severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) but its effectiveness against respiratory infections at MGs remains unknown.15, 17 A review of non-pharmaceutical interventions against respiratory tract infections among Hajj pilgrims presented data on the uptake of facemask and acknowledged that compliance was generally poor, but did not evaluate its effectiveness during Hajj.11 Subsequently, further data on the uptake and effectiveness have become available, especially from a pilot randomised controlled trial (RCT).18 The aim of this systematic review is to explore the uptake and effectiveness of facemask against respiratory infections in MGs.",

This finding is similar to what have been found in other studies that examined the uptake of facemask in other settings such as health care and community settings. For instance, the uptake of facemask among HCWs in several studies ranged from 56.6% to 84.3% (average 70.7%).42, 43, 44, 45 On the other hand, the uptake of facemask among ordinary population in diverse household and community settings ranged from 38% to 80.7% (average 55%).46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52 This could be explained by several individual or organisational factors. For example, HCWs have firsthand knowledge about the risk of respiratory infections and the role of preventive measurements in Hajj.25 Similarly, studies in non-MGs settings showed a positive relationship between HCWs\u2019 knowledge about the risk of infectious diseases and their compliance to preventive measures including the use of facemask.53, 54, 55 Organisational factors such as ready availability of facemask in health care settings, proper training programs and supportive policy of health care system could have played an important role in improving the compliance of HCWs to facemask use.54, 55, 56, 57 On the other hand, limited studies explored these individual and organisational factors among Hajj pilgrims. A few studies showed that providing educational session on protective measures against respiratory infections (including facemask) before Hajj was associated with significantly higher uptake of facemasks among pilgrims.18, 20, 27, 36, 38 Moreover, adequate accessibility and availability of facemask during Hajj may enhance the compliance of pilgrims. Abdin et al and Barasheed et al revealed a higher uptake of facemask among groups who were provided with sufficient quantity of free facemask (81.3% versus 33.6%, p\n < 0.01, and 76% versus 12%, p\n < 0.01, respectively).18, 20 However, reasons for not using facemask during Hajj have not been explored adequately. While use of facemask at Hajj has been officially recommended by Saudi Ministry of Health since 2014, it is too early to have a significant impact on pilgrims\u2019 practice of facemask use.58\n",

Findings also showed that there was no significant change in facemask uptake among Hajj pilgrims during the course of influenza A (H1N1) pandemic outburst in 2009, and the Middle East respiratory syndrome corona virus (MERS-CoV) outbreak since 2012. This does not concur with what has been reported in published studies involving the members of general public over the several outbreaks of respiratory infections in non-MG settings.59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64 Those studies showed an increase in facemask use during the outbreaks due to participants\u2019 perceived threat of infection. Poor awareness among many pilgrims of contemporary outbreaks might explain why their uptake of facemask did not increase even during an ongoing outbreak.65, 66, 67 Interestingly, pilgrims of Asian origin (e.g. Malaysians) had higher facemask uptake compared to pilgrims from other regions.37, 40 A polling study that evaluated the uptake of non-pharmaceutical measures during the pandemic influenza A (H1N1) of 2009 found that participants of Asian origin (e.g. Japan) had the higher facemask uptake (71%) compared to the uptake of participants of Western or Latin American origin.68 Presence of several peaks of influenza seasons in some Asian countries, overcrowding, dense smog and air pollution in many cities may explain the higher uptake of facemask among people from Asian countries;69, 70 additionally, cultural acceptance practice of the population around facemask while in public may make a difference.68 Focused studies are required to investigate factors influencing facemask compliance among attendees of Hajj and other MGs.",

For instance, two trials, a pilot RCT and a non-randomised trial, reported facemask to be significantly effective against respiratory infections at Hajj, whereas only two out of six cohort studies reported significant results. In contrast, none of the cross-sectional studies yielded significant results. This may indicate that a higher quality study is more likely to produce convincing results.",

            "text": "Finally, facemask effectiveness also differed depending on the study endpoints. For example, studies that examined effectiveness of facemask against a single respiratory symptom (such as cough, sore throat or fever) either ruled out or did not fully support its effectiveness.32, 37, 39 This is most likely because singular endpoints are often prone to subjective biases due to their non-specificity. In addition, solitary respiratory symptoms may result from causes other than infections; for instance, cough may result from exposure to dust or smoke during Hajj or may be a manifestation of a chronic respiratory condition of non-infectious aetiology, e.g., bronchial asthma.29 On the other hand, most of the studies that used syndromic criteria (constellation of symptoms) as an endpoint reported facemasks to be effective against respiratory infections during Hajj.18, 20, 22, 26, 28 This is most likely due to the fact that syndromic endpoints are more specific for an illness than a singular symptom. Only one study used laboratory-confirmed infection as an endpoint, but its sample size was relatively small (n = 104) and it failed to demonstrate statistically significant protectiveness of facemasks against respiratory viral infections among Hajj HCWs.25 Similarly, in non-MG settings, effectiveness of facemask varied depending on the study endpoint.42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 72, 73, 74 Meta-analysis of RCTs involving facemask in non-MGs showed efficacy against ILI but not against laboratory-confirmed influenza.14, 15, 75\n",

There was only one RCT but that was a pilot trial of small sample size, and there was another \u2018trial\u2019 published in a non-indexed journal that did not report methodological details including whether and how randomisation was done. As all included studies were conducted only in the context of Hajj, it is not possible to generalise the results to other MGs. A large scale clustered RCT is currently in its final phase that will measure the efficacy of facemasks against both \u2018syndromic\u2019 and laboratory-confirmed viral infections.75 The full results of the trial, once available, are likely to provide firmer evidence on the usefulness of facemask against respiratory infections among attendees of MGs.",
