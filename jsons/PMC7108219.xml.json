Humans of all ages living in endemic areas, especially those who are working as shepherds and toddlers, have high risk of acquiring CCHF.2, 3 The virus belongs to the genus Nairovirus in the Bunyaviridae family and causes severe diseases in humans, with the reported mortality rate of 5\u201330%.4, 5 In Turkey, the first cases of CCHF were diagnosed in 2002,6, 7 and by the year 2008 about 3000 patients with the 5% case fatality rate (CFR) had been reported by the Ministry of Health of Turkey.",

The case fatality rate reported from Ministry of Health of Turkey was 5%.11, 12 We reported no fatal case among 31 patients, who are under the age of 16. Our data suggest that the disease course is milder among children age group. According to the data held by Ministry of Health of Turkey, there were CCHF confirmed totally 242 cases under eighteen years old in Turkey and 4 deaths were reported in 2008 and 2009 in this age group (CFR: 1.65). Our observations among children age group is contradictory with the findings of a study reported by Mardani et al. from Iran.13 In that study the case fatality rate among 34 children was reported as high as 26.5% (9 of 34). In another study from Turkey including 21 children with CCHF, only one fatal case was reported with the fatality rate 4.7%.14 This fatal case was reported to have severe disease on initial admission, symptoms for the last 2 weeks and multi-system organ failure. He required ventilatory support for pulmonary haemorrhage but did not improve and died during his 3rd week in hospital. The CFR in CCHF infection could be different among different patient populations, because of several reasons. The virulences of different strains, access to the health system, the sensitivity threshold for the symptoms, co-existence of infections, and the last but not the least the host factors could contribute to the different outcomes among the different patient groups.9\n",
