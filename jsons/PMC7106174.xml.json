            "text": "Leptospirosis is an important reemerging zoonotic disease caused by pathogenic spirochetes of the genus Leptospira. The disease is found worldwide, especially in tropical regions. Human leptospirosis presents with a variety of signs and symptoms, including general febrile disease an influenza-like illness, and results in liver or kidney failure. As a result, this disease is often confused with other diseases, such as dengue fever, hemorrhagic fever and malaria, all of which are common in tropical and subtropical regions of the world (World Health Organization, 2003). Pathogenic Leptospira spp. can infect the renal tubules of most animals and are excreted in their urine, resulting in contaminated environments (e.g., soil and water) (Adler and de la Pe\u00f1a Moctezuma, 2010). Humans become infected mainly through Leptospira-contaminated water or soil, or from contact with urine from animals infected with this bacterium (Adler and de la Pe\u00f1a Moctezuma, 2010). Rodents are the most important reservoir of Leptospira among a variety of wildlife reservoirs.",

Bats (order Chiroptera) are the second largest order in mammals after rodents (order Rodentia) and are geographically widespread. Loss of habitat for bats, caused by recent anthropogenic activities, may increase contact between bats and humans, resulting in transmission of various pathogens from peridomestic bats to humans (de Jong et al., 2011). Transmission of viral pathogens from bats to humans has been the main focus of studies in this area; however, there have not been many studies on pathogenic bacteria in bats (M\u00fchldorfer, 2013).",

Among the 79 flaB-nested PCR-positive samples, 70 were used for direct sequencing and nine samples were not able to be sequenced because of insufficient DNA. Phylogenetic analysis (Fig. 1\n) revealed that the flaB sequences fell into seven clusters (FC1\u2013FC7). Six flaB fragments (ZFB08-62, ZFB09-25, ZFB09-32, ZFB12-05, ZFB12-107 and ZFB12-110) in the FC5 cluster were related to the corresponding gene sequences, all of which were identical to Leptospira borgpetersenii strains including Jules, De 10, Arborea, Poi, and Veldrat Batavia 46. The six fragments shared sequence identities ranging from 96.2% to 96.4% with the L. borgpetersenii strains described above. The nucleotide identity of the flaB fragment for ZFB12-96 in the FC6 cluster with the Leptospira kirschneri strains Moskva V and 3522C was 95.5% and 95.4%, respectively. The nucleotide sequence identities of five flaB fragments (ZFB08-92, ZFB11-56, ZFB12-98, ZFB12-105 and ZFB13-104) in the FC7 cluster with Moskva V and 3522C L. kirschneri strains were 95.3% and 95.1%, respectively. The nucleotide sequence identities of the remaining 58 flaB fragments belonging to FC1 to FC4 with that of the closest species, L. borgpetersenii, were from 91.2% to 94.5%. In a previous report, L. borgpetersenii, L. kirschneri, and Leptospira interrogans were isolated predominantly from rodents in Africa (Ahmed et al., 2006, Nalam et al., 2010). A novel species, Leptospira mayottensis, for which strains were isolated in Mayotte located in the Comoros archipelago, was reported to be genetically similar to L. borgpetersenii (Bourhy et al., 2012, Bourhy et al., 2014). This new species was included in phylogenetic analysis; however, the 58 flaB fragments belonging to the FC1\u2013FC4 clusters were also distantly related to L. mayottensis. The 12 flaB fragments belonging to the three clusters FC5\u2013FC7 appear to group with those of L. borgpetersenii and L. kirschneri; however, the remaining 58 flaB fragments belonging to the FC1\u2013FC4 clusters appear not to be associated with those of any reported species. Accordingly, the Leptospira flaB sequence data from kidney samples of captured E. helvum bats indicates that leptospires from E. helvum in Zambia have genotypes distinct from those previously reported. The results of phylogenetic analysis of the secY gene, which has been used as a valuable tool for discriminating between Leptospira spp. (Gravekamp et al., 1993, Rahelinirina et al., 2010, Victoria et al., 2008), were in accordance with the flaB-based phylogenetic tree (Supplementary Fig. 1), also supporting the hypothesis that leptospires from E. helvum in Zambia have unique genotypes.",

Fragments of the rrs gene (each \u223c593 bp) were amplified and sequenced from 27 samples randomly selected from the seven clusters (FC1\u2013FC7) (Fig. 2\n). Phylogenetic analysis showed that all 27 rrs fragments from E. helvum kidney samples grouped into a pathogenic group. ZFB08-92, ZFB12-105 and ZFB13-104, belonging to the FC7 cluster, were associated with the L. kirschneri strain, Kambale (FJ154562), and uncultured Leptospira sp. (JQ288731) from Triaenops menamena bats captured in Madagascar (Lagadec et al., 2012) (Fig. 2). ZFB09-25 (FC5) and ZFB12-96 (FC6) were closely related to L. borgpetersenii and uncultured Leptospira sp. (AY995720) from bats captured in Peru, respectively (Matthias et al., 2005) (Fig. 2). The rrs fragments of ZFB08-21 (FC4), ZFB08-91 (FC2), ZFB12-103 (FC3) and ZFB13-102 (FC4), all of which were identical, as well as those of ZFB08-50 (FC2), ZFB08-95 (FC2), ZFB08-48 (FC3) and ZFB08-96 (FC3), were located on unique branches (Fig. 2). The other 14 rrs fragments were closely related to an uncultured Leptospira sp. (JQ288732) from Rousettus obliviosus bats captured in Comoros; the latter sequence was closely related to L. borgpetersenii (Lagadec et al., 2012) (Fig. 2). Non-significant coevolutionary congruence was reported between the rrs sequence from Leptospira spp. and that of bats at the bat species level (Lei and Olival, 2014). However, the rrs sequences from bats are genetically related to each other and show no regional variations in phylogenetic analysis of the rrs sequences from various kinds of hosts (Fig. 2), suggesting that Leptospira have evolved uniquely in this bat population. Dietrich et al. reported that the host is an important factor in Leptospira diversification (Dietrich et al., 2014), also supporting our findings.",

Although E. helvum examined in this study were migrating to Zambia from the Democratic Republic of Congo (Richter and Cumming, 2008), data in this country are also lacking and there are no previous reports on L. borgpetersenii that may be related to the Leptospira spp. detected in this study. E. helvum captured in Kasanka National Park were more frequently infected than those captured in Nodla (x2 = 23.0, df = 1, p < 0.01). The roosting environment and colony size may influence this difference. No significant difference in the prevalence of the Leptospira flaB gene was found between males and females.",

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of PCR detection of Leptospira spp. in fruit bats from the African continent. In addition, the nested PCR-positive rate for Leptospira (14.9%) in E. helvum in Zambia was relatively higher than that of previous reports (M\u00fchldorfer, 2013). Although isolation of Leptospira directly from bat kidney samples using Korthof and EMJH media was not successful, the relatively high infection rate in the kidneys of E. helvum is likely to result in excretion of Leptospira via the urine. Contaminated urine has therefore been proposed as the potential transmission pathway of Leptospira spp. from fruit bats to rodents (Tulsiani et al., 2011). It is suggested, therefore, that E. helvum might be a candidate natural reservoir for Leptospira in Zambia. Continued surveillance in E. helvum, as well as in humans and rodents, is required to gain a better understanding of how Leptospira is maintained in, and transmitted by, E. helvum bats in Zambia.",
