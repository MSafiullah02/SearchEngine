After the first series of human cases in Shanghai [2], the outbreak spread to multiple provinces of Eastern China although the majority of cases were detected in the eastern provinces of Jiangsu, Shanghai and Zhejiang (Figure 1A-B). This new virus originated as a result of gene reassortments from other circulating avian influenza viruses from the H7N7 and H7N9 subtypes [3]. Circulation of the new H7N9 virus in chickens and other avian species was reported in affected regions, and most human cases had a history of poultry contact [4-7]. This evidence suggests a zoonotic origin for the human H7N9 disease. Interestingly, viral surveillance revealed circulation of H7N9 in poultry markets in the southern province of Guangdong but without causing human disease [8], indicating that the presence of the H7N9 virus in a region did not systematically lead to human disease, or was possibly under-diagnosed.",

This new variant was also the result of gene reassortment, with genes originating from avian influenza strains that were circulating in the South of China [8,9]. Later, a second wave of human cases of H7N9 (related to A/Shanghai/1/2013 (H7N9)) began after September 2013 and affected the Eastern and Southern provinces of China. Environmental surveillance data and epidemiological reports revealed that influenza H7N9 had achieved the status of a circulating strain among avian species and causing human disease as a consequence of sustained cross-species spillover [10].",

The patients presented influenza-like symptoms that included cough, fever, fatigue and severe pneumonia that developed into acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Two of the patients (#1 and #4) died due to irreversible deterioration of their clinical status, and the other two (#2 and #3) fully recovered. Upon admission, lung aspirates were collected through a suction catheter inserted into the endotracheal tube. A first analysis of the samples performed by China CDC confirmed the presence of influenza H7N9. A complete description of the clinical findings is to be published as part of a separate manuscript.

Total RNA was extracted from 100 \u03bcl of allantoic fluid using Trizol LS (Life Technologies) according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. Complete viral genomes were amplified by multisegment reverse-transcription PCR (M-RTPCR), a method that allows simultaneous amplification of all viral segments by using a pair of universal primers targeted against highly conserved flanking regions, as previously described [11]. Briefly, RNA was subjected to reverse transcription and PCR amplification with the SuperScript III One-Step RT-PCR System (Life Technologies), using the primers MBTuni12-ACGCGTGATCAGCAAAAGCAGG and MBTuni13-ACGCGTGATCAGTAGAAACAAGG and the following thermal cycler program: 42\u00b0C for 60 min and 94\u00b0C for 2 min; 5 cycles of 94\u00b0C for 30 sec, 45\u00b0C for 30 sec and 68\u00b0C for 3 min; 31 cycles of 94\u00b0C for 30 sec, 57\u00b0C for 30 sec and 68\u00b0C for 3 min. Sequencing libraries were prepared by using the Nextera XT DNA Sample Preparation kit (Illumina) according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol, and 150 bp paired-end sequencing was performed in a MiSeq instrument (Illumina). The resulting short reads were aligned with respect to the sequences of A/Shanghai/1/2013 (H7N9) by Bowtie2 (2.2.3) [12] and the consensus sequences were generated with SAMtools (1.0) [13], as previously described [14].

Only those isolates for which all their eight genomic segments were available with at least 75% of coverage were included in the analyses. In total, the genomic sequences from 95 human isolates were used in the analysis, including the Shantou strains. Additionally, 6 avian isolates and 4 environmental isolates that are representative of the core genetic groups and of the different reassortant sub-groups were included in the analysis (Additional file 1: Table S1).

The clinical specimens collected from these patients were inoculated into embryonated eggs for viral expansion and the resulting isolates were named A/Shantou/1001/2014 (H7N9), A/Shantou/1002/2014 (H7N9), A/Shantou/1003/2014 (H7N9) and A/Shantou/1004/2014 (H7N9). After amplification of the viral genomes by M-RTPCR, the sequencing of the PCR products resulted in approximately 184,000, 248,000, 214,000 and 192,000 viral short-reads, respectively. The resulting consensus sequences presented complete coverage of the viral genomes and they were deposited on GISAID\u2019s EpiFlu database (isolate identifiers EPI_ISL_162618, EPI_ISL_162619, EPI_ISL_162620 and EPI_ISL_162621, respectively).",

The phylogenetic analyses of the viral genes indicate that, despite the presence of reassortant groups, all the strains of the first wave of the disease share a common evolutionary history and they do not form apparent clusters by host species (Figure 2). A separate set of phylogenetic analyses that included the human isolates (n = 95), and the available avian (n = 44) and environmental (n = 21) isolates, also indicate that the strains are evenly distributed across reassortant groups regardless of their origin (data not shown). The strains of the second wave are divided between a first group whose gene sequences clustered together with the strains of the first wave, and a second group in which a majority of their genes (PB2, PB1, PA, NP and NS) formed separate clusters with an evolutionary history independent from the rest of the H7N9 strains. Therefore, we defined one first phylogenetic group of H7N9 strains named the Eastern cluster, formed by A/Shanghai/1/2013 and related strains in which the Shantou strains are included; we also defined a second group of H7N9 strains named the Southern cluster that includes A/Guangdong/1/2013 and related strains. Although both A/Shanghai/1/2013 and A/Guangdong/1/2013 carry reassortments that set them apart from their respective core groups (as shown in Figures 2 and 3), they are mentioned as representative of the Eastern and Southern clusters, respectively, for historical reasons and because of their higher relevance in the related literature.",

The fact that no species-specific clusters are detected in the phylogenetic analyses supports the idea that the isolates from human cases have arisen directly from the pool of H7N9 avian viruses that are circulating in each location. Genetic tuning of the virus through the incorporation of specific nucleotide substitutions and gene reassortments are responsible for modulating the viral fitness, level of pathogenicity, and transmissibility on different host species [9,21,22]. It is likely that the spectrum of circulating avian H7N9 strains is broader than the one observed in the human isolates due to the presence of sub-groups with lower capacity for causing human infections.",

The isolated viruses belong to the Eastern cluster, which is the predominant phylogenetic group among H7N9 viruses with wide distribution across multiple provinces of China (Figure 1B-C). Phylogenetic analyses show that the Shantou isolates derive from a common ancestor without having undergone gene reassortments or major evolutionary changes due to antigenic drifting.

Although gene reassortments between these two groups of viruses are possible, as shown by the incorporation of the PA-Eastern gene in several strains of the Southern cluster (Figures 2 and 3), both clusters have remained largely independent despite being co-circulating in those some areas.
