However, efforts to identify effectively supportive therapeutic drugs and treatments has been hampered by our limited understanding of host immune response for this fatal disease. To characterize the transcriptional signatures of host inflammatory response to SARS-CoV-2 (HCoV-19) infection, we carried out transcriptome sequencing of the RNAs isolated from the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) specimens of COVID-19 patients. Our results reveal distinct host inflammatory cytokine profiles to SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients, and highlight the association between COVID-19 pathogenesis and excessive cytokine release such as CCL2/MCP-1, CXCL10/IP-10, CCL3/MIP-1A, and CCL4/MIP1B. Furthermore, SARS-CoV-2 induced activation of apoptosis and P53 signalling pathway in lymphocytes may be the cause of patients' lymphopenia. The transcriptome dataset of COVID-19 patients would be a valuable resource for clinical guidance on anti-inflammatory medication and understanding the molecular mechansims of host response.",

First reported in December 2019 in Wuhan, COVID-19 spread rapidly across other areas and caused a major epidemic with 80,894 confirmed cases including 3237 deaths in China by 17 March 17 2020. A novel highly infectious coronavirus, officially called the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), was subsequently identified as the causative pathogen of this outbreak by deep sequencing and etiological investigations [1] [2] [3] . As global new cases spike in 75 more countries apart from China, WHO has declared that COVID-19 is currently a global public health emergency. According to previous studies of clinical characteristics, the most common symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infection are fever, cough, fatigue, shortness of breath, and abnormalities on chest CT [4] [5] [6] . However, some COVID-19 patients rapidly develop severe pneumonia symptoms and complications including acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), pulmonary oedema, acute kidney injury, or multiple organ failure [4] [5] [6] . The case fatality rate of COVID-19 is around 3.7% according to the national official statistics in China.",

            "text": "Despite increasing global threats of COVID-19, the host immune response against SARS-CoV-2 infection remains poorly understood. Viral RNAs are recognized by the innate immune system through three major classes of cytoplasmic pattern recognition receptors: Toll-like receptors (TLRs), RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs) and NOD-like receptors (NLRs), which trigger the expression of interferon (IFN) and activation of anti-viral effectors such as Natural Killer cells, T CD8 + cells and macrophages [7] [8] [9] [10] . Coronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), have evolved strategies to dampen or delay IFN production, which usually trigger exuberant inflammatory host responses leading to severe lung pathology [8, [11] [12] [13] . It is believed that dysregulated host immune response and production of inflammatory cytokines, known as the \"cytokine storm\", correlates with disease severity and poor prognosis during SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infection [8, 9, 14] . Several proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines such as CCL-2, CCL-3, RANTES, IL-2, and IL-8 were aberrantly elevated during MERS-CoV infection of human peripheral blood monocyte-derived macrophages [8, 15] . Interestingly, recent studies have reported that severe cases of COVID-19 exhibit increased plasma levels of IL2, IL6, IL7, IL10, GSCF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNF\u03b1 compared with mild cases, indicating inflammatory cytokine release is critical in COVID-19 progression [4, 5] . Lymphopenia was common in SARS-CoV-2 infected patients, probably due to lymphocytes induced apoptosis [4, 5, 16] . Furthermore, clinical pathological analysis of COVID-19 biopsy samples confirmed interstitial mononuclear inflammatory infiltrates in lung tissues [17] . However, the underlying molecular mechanisms of the aberrant inflammatory responses in serology and histopathology under SARS-CoV-2 infection are still not clear.",

In this study, we use RNA sequencing techniques to investigate the transcriptional changes in BALF and PBMC specimens of COVID-19 patients. Through transcriptomic analyses of these datasets, we identified several immune pathways and pro-inflammatory cytokines induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection, notably CCL2, CXCL2, CCL8, CXCL1, IL33, CCL3L1 in BALF and CXCL10, TNFSF10, TIMP1, C5, IL18, AREG, NRG1, IL10 in PBMC, evidencing a sustained inflammation and cytokine storm in the patients. KEGG pathway analysis of PBMC transcriptome revealed that patient's lymphopenia may be caused by activation of apoptosis and P53 signaling pathway in lymphocytes. Altogether, our data suggest that SARS-CoV-2 infection-induced excessive cytokine release correlates with lung tissue injury and COVID-19 pathogenesis.",

This distinction is due to differences in viral infections to the two types of cells. Of note, the virus seems not to infect PBMC as that we failed to detect viral RNAs as well as ACE2 expression in PBMC (Supplementary Tables 1 and 2) , which was also supported by the expression data base of bone marrow-derived blood cells (http://www.altanalyze. org). In order to illustrate the differences between the two cell types, we classified genes with different trends between the BALF samples and PBMC ( Figure 6(A,B) ). There are 17 genes that change in the same direction, while 36 genes have opposite trends. We first analysed genes that increased in PBMC but decreased in BLAF. Among the 15 genes, 5 genes are participated in small molecule catabolic process: ADA2, HK1, MGAT1, PGD and PLA2G15. And 4 genes are involved in neutrophil activation and immunity: ADA2, CTSD, GAA, LAIR1 (Supplementary File 4) . Next, we analysed genes that increased in BLAF but decreased in PBMC, which were listed in Figure 6 (B). Although, there are 17 genes changing in the same trend between the two samples, the biological meaning still needs further investigation.",

Currently, there is no optimal treatment or effective drug for this fatal lung disease. Our understanding of the host immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection is limited, making it difficult to design novel therapeutics. Viral infection usually causes massive alterations in the host transcriptome, leading to aberrant host cell metabolism and modulated immune response which is ideal for viral replication [12, 33] . Using several patients' and healthy individuals' BALF and PBMC samples, we performed genome-wide RNA-sequencing to characterize the host immune response in COVID-19 patients. We found that 1004 and 1023 genes were differential expressed (p < 0.05) when BALF and PBMC samples of COVID-19 patients were compared to control, respectively. As expected, these genes fall into categories including humoral immune response, lymphocyte mediated immunity and complement activation, which all play important roles in restricting viral infection.",

            "text": "Inflammatory response in viral pneumonia can be a double-edged sword. Although beneficial inflammation is necessary for the local tissues to fight infection, exacerbated inflammatory responses in pneumonia patients result in excessive release of proinflammatory cytokines known as \"cytokine storm\", leading to detrimental outcomes such as diffuse alveolar damage and fibrosis, progressive respiratory failure and multiple organ dysfunction [4, 34, 35] . The newly emerged SARS-CoV-2 virus shares the same human receptor ACE2 with SARS-CoV virus [1] . One of the hallmarks of SARS disease are systemic inflammation and cytokine storm with increased level of IL-6, IL-8, CXCL10/IP-10, CCL2/MCP-1 and CCL3/MIP-1A [12, 36] . Little is known about the immunopathology of COVID-19 diseases. Recent clinical investigation reveals that COVID-19 mild patients had high level of IL1B, IFN\u03b3, CXCL10/IP-10 and CCL2/MCP-1, while patients requiring ICU admission had higher level of GCSF, CXCL10/IP-10, CCL2/MCP-1 and CCL3/MIP-1A [4] . Consistently, in this study we found the expression of a large number of cytokines are significantly elevated in COVID-19 patients BALF samples compared to control, including pro-inflammatory cytokines CXCL1, CXCL2, CXCL6, CXCL8, CXCL10/IP-10, CCL2/MCP-1, CCL3/MIP-1A and CCL4/MIP1B. These data suggest SARS-CoV-2 virus infection led to cytokine storm which correlated with disease severity. Increased transcription of respective chemokines receptors such as CCR2 (CCL2/MCP-1 receptor) and CCR5 (CCL3/MIP-1A receptor) was also observed, indicating the activation of these inflammatory signaling. Cytokines/chemokines and their receptors play an important role in the cytokine migration and activation of immune cells at the sites of infection [37] . It has been shown that CCR2 and CCR5 deficient mice infected with mouse-adapted SARS-CoV virus exhibited defects in directing inflammatory cell to the airway, causing severe disease and increased mortality [38] . In addition, our results reveal that high levels of macrophages chemoattractant CXCL10/IP-10 and CCL2/MCP-1 and neutrophil chemoattractant CXCL2 and CXCL8 facilitate the migration of these immune cells to the site of infection, which was consistent with mononuclear cell infiltrates in lung tissues of COVID-19 patients [17] .",

It has been shown that proinflammatory cytokines IL-6, which is required for the regulation of inflammatory response, B-cell differentiation and antibody production, was increased in SARS patients [39, 40] . Laboratory findings indicated serum IL-6 protein level increased in 2 out of 3 patients (Supplementary Table 3 ). However, IL-6 transcription levels did not significantly change in PBMC (Figure 1 (D) and Supplementary File 1), indicating that the secreted IL-6 protein in serum might be from lung epithelial cells. Very recently, administration of the anti-IL-6-R\u03b1 antibody tocilizumab has been proposed as a treatment in clinical practice by ameliorating inflammation of COVID-19 patients. Of note, we noticed that relatively lower expression levels of IL6R was observed in BALF of COVID-19 patients compared with healthy individual (Supplementary File 1) , and there are no significant differences in PBMC (Figure 1(E) and Supplementary File 1), suggests that IL-6/IL6R axis of cells in BALF and PBMC might not be involved in the pathophysiology of COVID-19 disease. A more comprehensive clinical study and larger scale of transcriptome profiling with more cases is needed to evaluate the justification of anti-IL-6 mAb treatment.",

TGFb is a multifunctional cytokine which regulated a variety of biological processes including cell proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, and immune responses [42] . Additionally, TGF-b signaling can be modulated by virus infection to block cell apoptosis and to promote fibroblast proliferation and myofibroblast differentiation, thus plays a critical role in the development of pulmonary fibrosis [43] .
