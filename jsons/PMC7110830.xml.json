            "text": "In addition to a good knowledge base and up-to-date reference materials, good quality diagnostic instruments are essential for complete assessment of the eye. A good light source such as a Finoff ocular transilluminator (a diffuse light source) and a small hand held slit lamp (a focal light source) are excellent instruments for the evaluation of anterior segment clinical signs. The hand held slit lamps are affordable and available from medical supply distributors that sell ophthalmic instruments. Applanation tonometry is important for determining the intraocular pressure (IOP) and the most commonly used instrument is the Tono-Pen\u00ae VET. A fundus examination is performed by direct or indirect ophthalmoscopy. Direct ophthalmoscopy requires either a direct ophthalmoscope or a newer instrument, the PanOptic (Welch Allyn), which allows a larger field-of-view (5\u00d7) than the traditional direct ophthalmoscope. The method most widely used by veterinary ophthalmologists is indirect ophthalmoscopy and requires a bright light source such as a transilluminator and an indirect lens. The most commonly used indirect lenses are the 20 or 30 diopter (D) lenses. In general, a lens with a larger dioptric strength (eg, 30D) is easier to use with a miotic pupil while most indirect lenses can be used in a dilated pupil (eg, 20 or 30D). A lens with lower dioptric strength will allow a smaller field-of-view but better magnification and a lens with higher dioptric strength will allow a larger field-of-view but magnification is diminished.",

In addition to uveitis, other ocular signs can include keratitis, orbital masses, eyelid masses, subconjunctival and nictitating membrane masses, and anterior chamber and anterior uveal tumors, eg, iridal nodules, and white-pink masses in the anterior chamber or adhered to the anterior iris. Diagnosis of FeLV is by peripheral blood ELISA, then confirmed with either an immunofluorescent antibody test or an ELISA antigen test 3 to 4 months after initial diagnosis. If the FeLV infection regresses and the viremia is terminated, then the repeated ELISA will be negative.3 Treatment for the uveitis is discussed below. Systemic therapy is supportive care.",

The eye is a target organ and the domestic cat is the definitive host.14, 15 In addition to anterior uveitis, other ocular clinical signs can include granulomatous chorioretinitis and retinal vasculitis. The typical posterior segment lesions are multifocal, dark gray, hyporeflective lesions in the tapetal fundus and fluffy white lesions in the nontapetal fundus.15 The definitive method of diagnosing toxoplasmosis is by histopathologic identification of the organism in a biopsied or postmortem sample. Other methods available for diagnosis are ELISA and immunofluorescent antibody tests. Serologic results consistent with active toxoplasmosis include an IgM titer (acute disease-phase antibodies), a high IgG titer (antibodies that can remain high for 2 years or longer), or, a rising IgG titer when paired serum samples are evaluated. Other available assays include PCR, which when combined with traditional serology, may enhance the sensitivity and specificity of the diagnosis. Additional diagnostic testing performed by veterinary ophthalmologists may include aqueocentesis to compare toxoplasmosis-specific antibodies in the aqueous humor and serum concurrently.15 The most commonly used systemic treatment of toxoplasmosis is clindamycin hydrochloride at a dose of 12.5 mg/kg orally twice daily for 14 to 21 days. New antitoxoplasmic drugs are under investigation for use in humans and may be useful in cats. Treatment for the uveitis is discussed below.",

If cryptococcal organisms are inhaled into the caudal nasal cavity, clinical signs of rhinitis may be absent allowing the infection to spread through the cribriform plate and into the olfactory bulbs and tracts, causing meningitis and, in some cases, optic neuritis.23 Hematogenous spread from the nasal cavity can result in chorioretinitis.23 Clinical signs of anterior uveitis, including keratic precipitates and fibrin in the anterior chamber, are seen more commonly in cases with chorioretinitis and clinical signs can be mild to severe.

Topical therapy will not compromise the immune system of the patient.

Therefore, if posterior uveitis is present, appropriate systemic therapy is imperative. Topical steroidal medications should be used initially every 4 to 6 hours in cases of significant uveitis then tapered slowly as clinical signs resolve. Alternatively, topical nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications, eg, flurbiprofen, suprofen, or diclofenac, may be used if the dosing of steroids is detrimental to the patient (presence of Herpesvirus keratitis or conjunctivitis) at a dose of one drop every 8 to 12 hours. Cycloplegic parasympatholytic drugs such as atropine or tropicamide are used to dilate the pupil, manage pain by paralyzing the ciliary body muscles, and prevent posterior synechia. Atropine ointment is preferred in cats because of its bitter taste and is used once to twice daily. An alternative cycloplegic medication, if a risk of secondary glaucoma exists, is tropicamide. Tropicamide is a short acting parasympatholytic that typically lasts 4 to 6 hours and can be discontinued if the intraocular pressure becomes elevated.",
