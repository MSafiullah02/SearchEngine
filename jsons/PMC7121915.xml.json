            "text": "The immunoglobulin molecule is a complex structure of four polypeptide chains organized as a homodimer of a heterodimer comprising heavy and light chains. The proteolytic enzyme papain cleaves the molecules into two identical Fab (fragment, antigen binding) fragments and one Fc (fragment, crystallization) fragment, since the enzyme cuts above hinge disulfide bond(s) in the heavy chains. Thus, the Fab fragment is composed of a light chain consisting of a variable region (VL) and a constant region (CL) and the Fd region of the heavy chain containing a variable region (VH) and a constant region (CH1). The domains formed by the two variable regions bind the epitope as a specific antigen.",

Application of a phage display system (Smith, 1985) is an effective method for expression of a huge repertoire of immunoglobulin genes (Barbas et al., 1991; Thie et al., 2008). Using this system, valuable Fab fragments can be selected from the gene library (Barbas et al., 1992; Burton et al., 1991). The methods and protocols for phage display have been described in detail in reviews and books (Barbas et al., 2001). An antibody Fv fragment composed of only the variable regions (VH-VL), and especially a single chain Fv (scFv), can also be prepared using phage display technology (Bird et al., 1988) and is frequently used because of its better tolerance and expression in bacteria in comparison with a Fab fragment (Mondon et al., 2008). However, Fab fragments are more stable than scFv due to the association between the CH1 and CL regions.",

Phagemids contain origins for replication of E. coli and filamentous phage (M13, fl or fd), a group of viruses that infect E. coli (Mead and Kemper, 1988). A phage particle consists of a single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) genome. The phage surface has 3\u20135 copies of phage coat protein-3 (pIII), which is involved in host cell recognition and infection. The major coat protein is phage coat protein-8 (pVIII), which covers the length of the particle with approximately 2,700 copies that contribute to the structural stability of the phage particle (Russel, 1991). Thus, phagemid combines the characteristics of a plasmid (antibiotic resistance and facilitation of replication of double-stranded DNA (dsDNA)) with those of a phage (production and packaging of ssDNA into a phage particle). Light chain and Fd region genes are cloned into appropriate sites. Secretion signal sequences (e.g. pelB, ompA or PhoA) are coupled to both genes, which allow secretion of Fd and light chain fragments into the periplasm fraction of E. coli. The Fab fragment is fused to pIII or its C-terminal domain to allow display on the phage surface.",

Transformation efficiency is critical because it has a direct influence on library size; therefore, electrocompetent cells are better than normal competent cells. After transformation, E. coli is superinfected with helper phage (e.g. VCS M13) to give a whole phage particle. Helper phages have a slightly defective origin of replication and phagemid DNA is dominantly packaged into the phage particle. Synthesized Fd and light chain fragments are transported to the periplasm and a S-S bond forms between the fragments in the reducing environment. Fab fragments with fused pIII are displayed on the phage surface concomitant with wild-type pIII provided by helper phages. As a result, recombinant phage can infect E. coli. Some phagemids utilize pVIII as a Fab fusion protein. However, high valency display libraries generally lead to low affinity Fab fragments due to avidity effects.\n",

Stringent control of fusion protein expression during the propagation steps is critical. In general, lac promoter is used to drive gene expression in phagemid vectors; thus, accommodation of leaky expression is needed. Then glucose is added, or lac repressor is overexpressed to elevate metabolic activator-regulated repression. A robust terminator upstream of the lac promoter also reduces the background expression (Krebber et al., 1996). The tet promoter (tetracycline inducible promoter) can be used as an alternative approach (Zahn et al., 1999). With this promoter, gene expression is tightly repressed in the absence of an inducer such as doxycycline or tetracycline.",

The sources of immunoglobulin genes may be bone marrow, spleen, tonsils or peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs). Bone marrow is the ideal source, but is difficult to obtain. PBLs are most commonly used and one-step RT-PCR enables construction of libraries with sufficient amounts of heavy (\u03b3 and \u03bc) and light-chain (\u03ba and \u03bb) genes using pairs of Fab specific primers. A na\u00efve library is constructed from IgM mRNA of B cells taken from a nonimmunized donor. Antibodies from na\u00efve libraries generally show weaker affinity, but the library size is larger and the chance of obtaining specific antibodies with affinity against the target is increased (de Haard et al., 1999). A large library is constructed through combination of heavy and light chain genes cloned individually in each library.",

Phage particles presenting Fab fragments are incubated over an immobilized antigen of choice in ELISA plates or immunotubes (Kang et al., 1991; Marks et al., 1991). Non-binding phage are removed by washing. Phages that bind to the antigen are eluted by changing the binding conditions (e.g. pH change or competitive elution) and amplified by re-infection of E. coli cells. The amplified phages are then subjected to further rounds of panning with gradual increases in the frequency and intensity of the washing conditions. The panning process has a combination of positive selection (affinity and specificity) and negative selection (toxicity to bacterial cells and a tendency to delete unnecessary DNA), and 2\u20133 selection rounds may be preferable. To recover Fabs that are tightly bind to antigen, proteolytic enzyme digestion is used to cut a protease site between the Fab and pIII (Ward et al., 1996).\n\n",

Plasmid vector is used for preparation of combinatorial immunoglobulin gene libraries, instead of use of a phagemid vector. The size of the library is smaller than that of a phage display library, but is sufficient for isolation of Fab fragments to major antigens of pathogens. The number of bacterial colonies screened using filter membranes is also limited to less than 5,000 per 82-mm filter (Fig. 8.4). However, as shown in Table 8.1, positive rates in the first screening by colony blotting were 0.006 to 0.05% to antigens from various pathogens. Plasma recovered during the isolation process of lymphocytes from peripheral blood of the donor can be used for detection of positive clones,\n\n\n",

By using a secondary antibody specific for the Fc region of human IgG, direct binding of the second antibody to a human Fab fragment produced in E. coli is also avoided in the case of indirect detection (Liu et al., 2006). Although most of the positives in the first screening may become negative in the second and third screenings using ELISA or an indirect immunofluorescein antibody test, colony blotting is a simple and effective procedure for screening for human Fabs with neutralizing activity to pathogens. Screening by colony blotting is especially suitable for relatively small libraries such as chain-shuffled libraries.",

Half of the medium is changed every 4 days and the culture is continued for 4 weeks without any treatment, including single isolation. During the process, EBV-transformed B lymphoblastoid cell lines (B-LCL) consisting of several clones are established (Takekoshi et al., 2001). Antibody titers in the culture medium are then checked and the antibody-producing cells are expanded in a 6-cm dish. Cells and medium are harvested and total RNA is extracted from the cells. The immunoglobulin genes encoding the Fab fragments are amplified by RT-PCR and cloned into the bacterial expression vector. The vector is transformed into E. coli and each colony is picked up and incubated for expression of Fab fragments. Screening of 100 clones is generally sufficient to obtain positives in a subsequent assay of the Fab fragments by ELISA.\n",

Severe limitations in yield, folding and functionality are sometimes encountered in bacterial production of Fab fragments. The expression efficacy is affected by vector design and culture conditions; that is, the temperature and concentration of isopropyl-\u03b2-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) (Corisdeo and Wang, 2004; Shibui and Nagahari, 1992). Many cases of successful expression have been shown at relatively low temperature and with gentle induction at a low IPTG concentration. The amount of antibody expressed also depends on its composition. Poor Fab expression is linked to poor intrinsic stability, whereas increases in Fab stability are correlated with higher Fab yields and higher levels of properly folded and functional protein (Demarest et al., 2006). This is also affected by the growth rate of E. coli and secretion of Fab fragments into the medium. Limitations on protein expression may be overcome by single amino acid substitutions (Knappik and Pluckthun, 1995). Storage of fragments in periplasmic spaces requires breaking of the outer membrane of the bacteria to release the fragments (Selisko et al., 2004; Takekoshi et al., 1998).",

With this system, only functional heterodimers are purified.

Site-specific mutagenesis uses modifications based on structural information, whereas random mutagenesis includes use of error-prone PCR (Gram et al., 1992). Shuffling of light or heavy chain genes is effective for finding a better combination of heavy and light chains from the combinatorial library (Hur et al., 2010; Lou et al., 2010; Zhu et al., 2008). When light chain genes are shuffled, the positive rates in colony blot screening are 10- to 20-fold higher than those in shuffling analysis of heavy chain genes (Tachibana et al., 2003).

            "text": "Residues in the CDR, and especially in the CDR3 s of the heavy and light chains of the antibody, are thought to be responsible for high-affinity interactions with antigen. Therefore, an increased affinity may occur by mutation if the native residue exhibits a negative effect on the interaction. However, the effect of a mutation is not restricted to contact residues (Winkler et al., 2000). For instance, the CDR3 of the light chain comprises amino acids 89\u201397 in the Kabat numbering system (Johnson and Wu, 2004; Wu and Kabat, 1970). Although the residue at position 91 may not interact directly with antigenic molecules, it can affect the binding of residue 93 (Hall et al., 1992). Thus, amino acid substitution at position 91 may result in a conformational change that allows redistribution of the neighboring amino acids involved in the antigen-antibody interaction. For site-directed mutagenesis, recombination PCR with high fidelity DNA polymerase is feasible to introduce amino acid substitution and improve the affinity of the original human Fab (Jones and Winistorfer, 1997; Tachibana et al., 2004). The framework in the variable region is also important for establishing the correct conformation of the CDR loops, and mutations in the framework may affect the flexibility of the CDR loops.",

Here, we have shown that bypassing the phage display and panning processes is practical when immunoglobulin genes are derived from seropositive donors. Identification of bacterial colonies using membrane filters and donor plasma is useful for the initial screening of human Fab fragments to major antigenic molecules of pathogens. Preparation of immunoglobulin gene libraries from EB virus-transformed oligoclonal B-LCL can also be used for preparation of human Fab fragments to pathogens and self-antigens. Recently, a new technique bypassing the phage display platform has also been developed. B cells are cultured at near clonal density, culture supernatants are screened, and positives are used to clone authentic antibody genes (Walker et al., 2009). Thus, improvement of technologies for antibody engineering is still in progress to generate high-affinity human antibodies.",
