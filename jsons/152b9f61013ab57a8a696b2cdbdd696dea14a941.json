The large outbreaks in Hong Kong, Toronto, Singapore and Vietnam were initiated by cases that were imported before this new disease had been identified and before appropriate measures had been put in place to prevent transmission. [2] [3] [4] There remains a concern that, even with such measures, prevention of transmission from imported SARS cases may be difficult for countries that receive many international travelers from areas badly affected by SARS. 5 Singapore has one of the busiest airports in Southeast Asia, and has numerous arrivals each day from countries in the region affected by SARS. The country is therefore potentially vulnerable to importation of SARS cases that may initiate new outbreaks.",

Passengers who appeared to be unwell or had a temperature of >37.5\u00b0C were sent by a special ambulance to a single hospital that had been nominated to perform SARS screening. From 7 April onwards, passengers arriving from SARS-affected countries were asked to complete health declaration cards. The information required included not only recent travel and contact history and symptoms suggestive of SARS, but also addresses in Singapore and flight seats, to facilitate contact tracing. On 23 April, thermal scanners were installed at Changi Airport and the road entry points to check the temperatures of all departing and arriving passengers. Temperature checks were introduced to all of Singapore's ferry terminals on 28 April. SARS screening was progressively extended to all arriving flights from 29 April onwards.",

The SARS epidemic in Singapore can be traced to this single person, who imported SARS before the WHO alert on 12 March at a time when the disease was not widely recognized. 4, 7 The experience with SARS in Singapore is therefore analogous to that in Hong Kong, Vietnam and Canada, where the first imported cases were associated with a large number of health-care-associated infections. 3, 7 By 31 May,the national epidemic had resulted in a total of 206 cases with probable SARS, with the large majority being directly or indirectly (secondary, tertiary, etc.) linked to this first imported case. The absence of community transmission associated with the SARS cases imported after appropriate public health measures were taken in Singapore is probably a result of relatively prompt identification and isolation together with a low potential for transmission (i.e. they were not superspreaders 8, 9 ) , whereas the absence of nosocomial transmission is probably due to the immediate isolation and enhanced infection control measures.",

Three of the six imported SARS cases developed symptoms only after arrival in Singapore, and would thus have been missed on airport screening. Therefore, screening measures at entry points are not sufficient in themselves.
