The evaluation of urban resilience is a hybrid multiple attribute group decision-making problem involving both crisp and fuzzy indicators. In order to evaluate the urban resilience reasonably and quantitatively, an urban resilience evaluation index system is established, including four primary indicators of ecological environment, municipal facilities, economic development and social development, and 28 secondary indicators. An evaluation model based on the theory of intuitionistic fuzzy set and TOPSIS method is proposed. The intuitionistic trapezoidal fuzzy number is used to quantify the fuzzy index and determine the weights of experts. The weight of each index is determined based on the maximizing deviation method. The relevant data of Dalian City from 2013 to 2017 are collected to evaluate the city resilience, and a sensitivity analysis is carried out based on the proposed model. The results may provide insights for the further urban resilience promotion.",

Cities need not only to establish a defense system against natural disasters, but also to protect the lives and properties of residents from hazards such as economic fluctuations and epidemics (Godschalk 2003) . Therefore, cities need an ability to defend, recover and adapt disturbances when facing with them (Fang et al. 2017; Chen et al. 2018) . Evaluating urban resilience and analyzing the factors that influence city's response to hazards can find weak points in urban management, so that relevant departments can take targeted improvement measures and build a stronger city.",

The research methods involved mathematical analysis methods and spatial analysis methods (Cimellaro et al. 2010; Chen et al. 2018; Wang et al. 2018) . Moreover, most scholars focused on the performance of cities in response to a single disaster such as earthquake or flood disasters (Martins et al. 2012; Lyu et al. 2018) , while the engagement with the evaluation of comprehensive urban resilience is still limited. Additionally, when evaluating the urban resilience comprehensively, it is necessary to consider the impact of various factors such as social, economic and environmental factors (Wang et al. 2018) . The evaluation indicators have characteristics of both accuracy and fuzziness, and some indicators need to be quantified by the subjective opinions of experts. Therefore, the comprehensive urban resilience evaluation is a hybrid multiple attribute group decision-making problem, but the research of scholars on solving this problem is still limited. In order to bridge the gap, the specific objective of this study was to propose a method in solving the hybrid multi-attribute urban resilience evaluation problem and evaluate the comprehensive urban resilience of a certain city, hoping it may help to improve the city resilience.",

Cities are not only a carrier of production and residents' life, but also an important protector against hazards (Godschalk 2003; Lhomme et al. 2013) . A city can be regarded as an integrated system, consisting of many sub-systems such as building systems, medical systems, transportation systems and government management systems (Javidroozi et al. 2015) . The effective operation and cooperative work of these systems ensure the normal function of a city. The term \"resilience\" originated in ecology, it is considered that the resilience of an ecosystem can maintain normal operation when exposed to external threats, or it can return to equilibrium after being disturbed (Hoiling 1973; Folke 2006) . These years, scholars extended the definition of resilience and combined it with urbanism and proposed the concept of \"urban resilience\" (Cavallaro et al. 2014; Meerow et al. 2016; Chen et al. 2018) .",

Researchers from Kyoto University and Kitakyushu City Center in Japan have also established a comprehensive evaluation framework of resilient cities system (GFDRR 2016) . Usually, the evaluation system of urban resilience involved aspects of social, economic, institutional and physical; some of the researchers divided it more detailed into biodiversity, modularity, tight feedbacks, social capital, acknowledging slow variables and thresholds, and innovation (Walker and Salt 2006; Cutter et al. 2008; Orencio and Fujii 2013; Singh-Peterson et al. 2014; Qasim et al. 2016 ).",

By comparing the original data of 2013 and 2014, we can see that the per capita urban road area in 2013 is larger than that in 2014, which leads to a slightly better urban resilience result in 2013 than in 2014. The decrease in per capita urban road area is related to the urban construction of Dalian municipal government and the annual growth of population. After 2014, the per capita urban road area has increased slightly, and the number of health institutions has also increased. This indicates that in recent years, Dalian municipal government has increased investment in public facilities and infrastructure construction.",

Meanwhile, we hoped that the study may then promote further insights of the factors which affect urban resilience most. Oracle Crystal Ball is an open-source plug-in software of Microsoft Excel, which can analyze the uncertainties through Monte Carlo simulation. Because it requires less user intervention and has a powerful probability distribution library, it is widely used for sensitivity analysis in many fields such as project management, financial analysis and risk management (Bieda 2013; Mantzaras and Voudrias 2017) . We used this software carried out 10,000 time's Monte Carlo simulations and set a confidence rate of 95%.

But this article only made a comprehensive assessment of urban resilience from a macroscopic perspective, without taking actual disaster situations into account. Because the geographical location of each city is different, the occurrence probability of actual disasters also varies. For example, coastal cities are prone to natural disasters such as typhoons and tsunamis, and cities in plate turbulent regions are more likely to suffer from disasters such as earthquakes. Therefore, the aspects of emphasis on prevention and construction vary between cities. Meanwhile, under the context of the world's great development, hazards such as epidemics and financial crises are also unpredictable. Many hazards occur suddenly and have no obvious omen. A novel coronavirus named 2019-nCoV broke out in Wuhan, China, in December 2019 (Corman et al. 2020 ). In the event of such hazards, are there enough health facilities to receive patients? Can the government carry out a medical emergency plan rapidly to avoid the disease spreading into a larger scale? These abilities are closely related to the comprehensive resilience of a city, and the improvement in it is a long-term and slow process. The comprehensive urban resilience evaluation system and model proposed in this article may give suggestions to cities that have not suffered hazards beforehand. ",
