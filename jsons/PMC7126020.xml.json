In addition to ligands detected by natural RNA controllers, RNA can bind to various types of molecules including antibiotics, dyes, fluorescent probes, and proteins with specificity and sensitivity similar to protein-based controllers [3]. Binding events can be readily associated with regulatory activities because of the flexibility of RNA, which allows transformation between alternative structures. Moreover, the regulatory activity of RNA can be modulated or even designed by adjusting base pairings that largely determine intra- and intermolecular interactions. Finally, because of the small size of RNA controllers (generally <200 nt), they impose lower burdens on cells compared to protein-based controllers which require longer mRNA transcripts and translation into proteins [4]. This small size also permits construction and examination of numerous variants in a high-throughput manner to create and optimize new controllers.",

Binding of a cognate metabolite to the sensor, an RNA aptamer, induces structural changes of the expression platform to control gene expression. Each riboswitch component can be engineered independently because of the modularity of this system. Riboswitch aptamers are primary choices for modification to broaden the range of ligands. For example, specific nucleotides in the addA riboswitch aptamer from Vibrio vulnificus were fully mutagenized based on its crystal structure [5\u2022] (Figure 1a). Mutant riboswitches were screened for orthogonal gene activation using a library of non-natural analogues of the original ligand, adenine. Mutant riboswitches activated gene expression upon addition of ammeline or azacytosine, but showed no response to adenine. Furthermore, additional aptamer-ligand pairs were discovered in a subsequent analogue screening study [6]. This approach was applied to identify novel aptamer-ligand pairs by altering the specificity of the PreQ1 class I riboswitch from Bacillus subtilis [7]. Aptamers of natural riboswitches were utilized as scaffolds to select aptamers for new ligands. Nucleotides in the binding pockets of natural aptamers were randomized to produce potential aptamer libraries for in vitro selection (SELEX) [8\u2022\u2022] (Figure 1b). Selected aptamers for 5-hydroxytryptophan and 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine were successfully coupled to the readout domain, producing fluorescence upon binding of their cognate ligand in vitro and in vivo. The ability of natural aptamer scaffolds to properly fold in the cellular context ensures that aptamers evolved in vitro can be successfully employed in riboswitch construction for in vivo applications.",

Furthermore, modular expression platforms that activate gene expression were developed by modifying natural expression platforms [10\u2022].

Either high-throughput screening and selection [11, 12, 13\u2022, 14\u2022\u2022, 15] or rational design approaches [16, 17] were applied to design optimal communication modules. As a result, aptazymes for small molecules, antibiotics, and proteins were developed based on hammerhead ribozymes. Additionally, newly discovered ribozymes were employed to construct new aptazymes. A twister ribozyme was utilized to build two-input logic gates by attaching two distinct aptamers at different positions on a single ribozyme scaffold [18] (Figure 2a). Moreover, hepatitis delta virus ribozyme [19] and pistol ribozyme [15] were utilized to build ligand-responsive aptazymes.",

In contrast to prokaryotic translation which requires a ribosome binding site inside mRNA, eukaryotic translation generally utilizes a 5\u2032-cap to recruit ribosomes. Therefore, a general approach for developing translation-regulating riboswitches in prokaryotes involving inserting aptamers upstream of the ribosome binding site is not applicable to eukaryotes. Thus, alternative mechanisms were exploited. For example, internal ribosome entry site (IRES) was utilized to rationally design riboswitches that activate or repress gene expression [20, 21]. Aptamers were placed upstream of IRES and several base-pairing sequences were designed to control the formation of critical structures (PK-III) depending on ligand binding (Figure 2b). Another example utilized an unusual mechanism known as ribosome shunting. On a special mRNA, a ribosome that translated an upstream short open reading frame can bypass a strong stem structure and land on a specific site downstream to reinitiate translation of a downstream ORF. This stem was replaced with aptamers to control the formation of the stem in response to ligand binding [22] (Figure 2b). Ribosomal frame-shifting was also employed for dynamic control of the reading frame [23]. A theophylline aptamer was inserted along with a switch hairpin in the extra stem-loop of SARS coronavirus \u22121 programmed ribosomal frameshifting pseudoknot stimulator (Figure 2b). Binding of theophylline induced formation of a pseudoknot structure essential for \u22121 frameshifting, and the reporter gene in the \u22121 frame was translated.",

RNA molecules that regulate translation (IS10) or transcription (pT181) were combined with aptamers to control the formation of intramolecular structures depending on ligand binding [24] (Figure 2c). Additionally, aptazymes can be connected to trans-acting riboregulators that expose an activating seed region after ligand-dependent cleavage [25]. These chimeric non-coding RNAs dynamically controlled gene expression in trans. A revolutionary technology in life science and bioengineering is clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats interference (CRISPRi) and activation (CRISPRa). These methods are widely utilized for genome-wide regulation because of the ease of designing spacer sequences to target nearly any chosen genes. Recently, several groups reported extended uses of CRISPRi and CRISPRa for ligand-dependent control of gene expression [26\u2022\u2022, 27\u2022, 28]. Aptamers or aptazymes were fused to single guide RNAs (sgRNAs) to form secondary structures that shield spacer sequences in the absence of ligands (Figure 2c). When bound to cognate ligands, these fusion sgRNAs adopted alternative structures or cleaved themselves, releasing the spacer sequences to interact with target loci. Using CRISPR technologies, these allosteric sgRNAs may substantially improve our ability to dynamically control gene expression.",

These theoretical foundations were united with various algorithms to predict RNA structure [31, 32, 33], enabling the forward design of dynamic RNA controllers (Figure 3a). In general, specific regions in RNA controllers critical for ligand-induced regulation are randomized to generate sequence libraries. Next, computational methods predict the secondary structures of the sequence variants in the presence or absence of a ligand and screen them according to predefined criteria. The criteria include successful folding of the ligand binding pocket and rejection of any unwanted structures. Prior knowledge of the secondary structures of aptamers in their ligand-bound status and experimentally determined kinetic parameters can be reflected in the algorithm to enhance accuracy.",

Another study showed that the model predictions improved by incorporating rate constants for a binding reaction measured in vitro [38]. Rather than constructing complicated mechanistic models, prediction of RNA secondary structures could be solely utilized [39]. Here, a random search algorithm based on an equilibrium partition function was applied to calculate the probabilities to form two distinct regulatory states, ON and OFF, for each aptazyme candidate sequence. Finally, aptazyme-based trans-acting riboregulators were designed using a computational technique [25]. A simple energy model was developed to calculate and minimize the energy for each regulatory step.

            "text": "One of the long-standing difficulties in developing ligand-responsive RNA controllers is how to select RNA aptamers with switching activities in vivo. It is widely accepted that tight binding of an RNA aptamer to its target ligand does not necessarily guarantee switching activity in vivo. To address this problem, ligand-dependent strand displacement activity was selected in vitro [41]. In this work, RNA variants that exposed a binding site for a short DNA fragment tagged with biotin in a ligand-dependent manner were selected. Alternatively, libraries of RNA aptamers can be tested directly in vivo for their functionality as riboswitches. A pool of RNA aptamers enriched in vitro for binding to neomycin B was cloned upstream of a reporter gene [42]. Aptamers with riboswitch activities were successfully identified by in vivo screening based on reporter expression. The capability of in vivo selection was further extended in a recently published work utilizing a coupled in vitro\u2013in vivo selection strategy [43\u2022]. In this study, an aptamer library that binds to a flavonoid, naringenin, was cloned upstream of a dual selectable marker gene. The riboswitch library was subjected to two evolutionary routes that differed by the sequences of positive and negative selection and concentration of the target ligand during positive selection. Operational ranges of the evolved riboswitches highly depended on the selection conditions, indicating that in vivo selection can be utilized to adjust quantitative properties of dynamic RNA controllers. Using in vivo screening and selection platforms for genetic switch development in prokaryotes [44, 45] and eukaryotes [12, 14\u2022\u2022], the coupled in vitro\u2013in vivo selection strategy may facilitate the development of novel RNA-based dynamic controllers with user-defined quantitative properties (Figure 3b). Moreover, simultaneous utilization of high-throughput measurement of activity and next-generation sequencing analysis can not only screen and optimize dynamic RNA controllers, but also provide new design principles from sequence-structure-function relationships [14\u2022\u2022, 15].",

Diverse RNA-based regulatory mechanisms were exploited in combination with naturally occurring aptamers or artificial aptamers to create dynamic RNA controllers. Mechanistic models for RNA-based regulations and algorithms for predicting RNA structure allowed establishment of computational methods for de novo design of dynamic controllers. Advances in in vitro and in vivo selection made the development of dynamic RNA controllers that functions in vivo much more achievable. Consequently, RNA-based dynamic controllers were implemented in various applications ranging from high-throughput screening of metabolites to inducible control of cellular processes.",

First, efficient methods of discovering novel RNA-based regulatory elements are necessary because natural RNA controllers can be used as foundations for artificial controllers and provide additional design principles. High-throughput screening of novel regulatory elements based on next-generation sequencing [57], transcriptome-wide probing of RNA structures in vivo [58, 59], or bioinformatics-based comparative genomics [60, 61] were recently demonstrated. Next, prediction algorithms for RNA structure should be refined and improved considering that the regulatory activity of RNA is largely determined by its structure. For instance, accurate calculation of the contributions of pseudoknots, non-Watson-Crick base pairings, and ligand binding would considerably improve the accuracy of structure prediction and computational design of dynamic RNA controllers. Finally, in vitro and in vivo selections should be designed deliberately to complete the development process. The computational design approaches can narrow down the number of candidates for dynamic RNA controllers after extensive in silico screening of vast sequence spaces. In vitro and in vivo selections can then be performed to empirically validate each design in a high-throughput manner in an environment where the dynamic RNA controllers should work. The potential of empirical selection should be further explored because the quantitative properties of RNA controllers can be modulated using well-designed in vivo selection schemes [43\u2022]. Emerging approaches in the development of dynamic RNA controllers will expand the repertoire of genetic parts for applications in metabolic engineering and synthetic biology. Future innovations in the methods for discovering natural parts, predicting RNA structure, and empirically selecting candidates will dramatically improve the design process.",

Twister ribozyme has two stems that can be combined with two distinct aptamers simultaneously to construct two-input logic gates. (b) Eukaryote-specific translation regulation mechanisms are exploited to create new dynamic RNA controllers. Left: Modulator sequence, anti-anti-IRES sequence (aaIRES), and anti-IRES sequence (aIRES) are designed to sequester the pseudoknot III (PK-III) which is an essential element of IRES system in the absence of ligand. When the ligand is bound to an aptamer, aaIRES and aIRES hybridize, forming PK-III. Middle: Ribosome cannot translate a downstream ORF (dORF) after translating a short ORF (sORF) in the absence of ligand. When the ligand is bound to an aptamer, an essential stem structure is formed, allowing the ribosome to shunt and reinitiate translation of the downstream ORF. Right: \u22121 programmed ribosomal frameshifting stimulator is formed when the ligand binds the aptamer. The ribosome shifts the reading frame at a slippery sequence. (c)Trans-acting dynamic RNA controllers. Left: A trans-non-coding RNA (ncRNA) is fused with an aptamer. Trans-ncRNA is inactive when ligand is absent because of intramolecular interactions. When the ligand is bound to the aptamer, an active stem-loop structure is formed that can terminate transcription or repress translation. Middle: A single guide RNA (sgRNA) is inactive in the absence of ligand because its spacer sequence hybridizes with an antisense stem. When the ligand is bound to an aptamer, the spacer is released and sgRNA represses gene expression in combination with a catalytically inactive Cas9 (dCas9). Right: An aptazyme is attached to the 5\u2032-end of a sgRNA to sequester a spacer sequence in the absence of ligand. When the ligand is bound to the aptamer, the aptazyme cleaves itself, leaving a free spacer sequence that can repress gene expression.",
