During the same study period, 27 recipients developed graft failure after primary LDLT for various reasons. Graft failure was diagnosed based on the detection of uncontrollable hyperbilirubinemia, massive ascites due to hypoalbuminemia or PV obstruction, and repeated hepatic coma or GI bleeding. Among these patients with graft failure, 14 underwent Re-LDLT; retransplantation was contraindicated in 13 patients. Among them, 3 patients were registered on the DDLT waiting list, but a medically-appropriate donor could not be found (Fig. 1). The main cause for the contraindication of retransplantation among these patients was a poor general condition, such as uncontrollable infection, severe heart or respiratory failure, and irreversible brain damage (cerebral hemorrhage) (Table 2). Severe pulmonary failure included acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (PaO2/FiO2 \u2264200), or pulmonary hypertension [PH; mean pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) \u226525 mmHg]. Uncontrollable infection was defined as a state of systemic inflammatory syndrome (SIRS) with an infection that did not improve with any antibacterial medication. The recurrence of malignant disease such as hepatoblastoma was an absolute contraindication for Re-LDLT. When the probability of recurrence could be predicted based on the primary disease\u2014such as in cases of primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC), progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis type-1 (PFIC-1), and acute liver failure (ALF)\u2014we repeatedly explained the possibility of recurrence to the patient and their family and obtained reliable informed consent. The characteristics between primary LDLT (n = 143) and Re-LDLT (n = 14) were analyzed to detect the factors that affected patient survival and evaluate the validity of Re-LDLT. The investigations were performed in accordance with the guidelines of the Declaration of Helsinki. Written informed consent was obtained from all of the patients and each operative procedure was approved by the institutional review board (IRB) of Kumamoto University.\n",

In most cases choledochojejunostomy was selected because of the shortness or strong adhesion of the recipient\u2019s original bile duct. In 2 cases involving patients with a severe general condition, tube external choledochostomy was carried out to shorten the operative time. In 6 cases, a venous graft (such as a recipient external iliac vein, donor ovarian vein, or portal vein) from the resected graft liver was used for PV plasty because the length or thickness of the original PV was not sufficient for simple anastomosis. The venous graft was patched to enlarge the PV or anastomosed to the original PV or SMV to obtain an adequate length for anastomosis and front flow.",

Prednisolone was gradually tapered and discontinued at 3 months after primary LDLT and 6 months after Re-LDLT, as long as the graft function was maintained. In cases in which adverse effects such as renal failure occurred, mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) or azathioprine were added as the third drug. In ABO-incompatible cases involving patients who were >2 years of age, rituximab (375 mg/m2) was administered 14 days before transplantation and MMF was added to the baseline immunosuppressive agents.

Since the first successful LDLT in 1989, the operation has been accepted throughout the world as a fundamental treatment option for patients with end-stage liver disease [11\u201313]. There has been a great deal of discussion about the advantages and disadvantages of LDLT [14\u201318]. Needless to say, the performance of such an invasive procedure in the living donor remains controversial [19]. In Japan, less than 50 DDLTs are performed each year [20]; thus, we are forced to rely on living donors, even at the time of retransplantation. It is therefore necessary to understand the relevance and adaptations of this procedure.",

A Kyoto group reported that ICU care, a shorter interval between primary LDLT and Re-LDLT, hyperbilirubinemia, elevated creatinine, and apheresis were independently associated with poor outcomes after pediatric Re-LDLT [9]. In our institution, retransplantation was contraindicated in 13 patients due to a poor general condition. Most of these patients suffered from some fatal complications that affected the heart or respiratory functions (which affected their ability to withstand reoperation), or severe infection after primary LDLT. Recurrence of the primary malignant disease (such as hepatoblastoma) was also considered to be a contraindication due to the risk of recurrence in the second liver graft after Re-LDLT.",

Even though the rate of mortality was higher among young recipients in previous reports [9], the survival rate of the younger patients in our study was good. The discrepancy in the results suggests the need for further consideration to determine more appropriate indications for Re-LDLT. There had been some discussions about the proper timing of retransplantation. Some reports have mentioned that later transplantation was better than earlier transplantation for improving patient survival after retransplantation [4, 7, 9]. Even though the period between primary LDLT and Re-LDLT was not found to influence survival in the present study, it might be important to try avoiding surgery in the acute phase after primary surgery as the patient would be less likely to withstand reoperation. The lower rate of early retransplantation in comparison to other studies might be attributed to our treatment protocol after primary LDLT.",

Although Sieders et al. [6] mentioned the fact that BA as a primary disease negatively influenced survival after retransplantation, it was not a significant factor in our cases. In one case involving a patient with PFIC-1, a primary liver graft with steatohepatitis was lost. PFIC refers to a group of familial cholestatic conditions caused by defects in the biliary epithelial transporters that usually leads to cirrhosis. The clinical course and outcomes of PFIC-1 recipients after LDLT are reported to be insufficient due to steatosis and fibrosis [21, 22]. In our case, the patient with PFIC-1 had developed steatohepatitis 8 years after primary LDLT. As PFIC-1 patients will require liver transplantation during the long-term progression of the disease, further strategy improvements and the elucidation of the mechanism of PFIC recurrence are crucial in LDLT for PFIC-1 patients.",

The operative time and bleeding volume in Re-LDLT were much higher in comparison to primary LDLT, reflecting the difficulty of the Re-LDLT procedure. Under such unfavorable conditions, the outcome of our Re-LDLT cases is good in comparison to previous studies. The main reason for this is the small number of vascular complications after Re-LDLT. Previous studies reported that the incidence of hepatic artery thrombosis (HAT) after pediatric retransplantation is up to 10% [23\u201325]. HAT might lead to fatal graft failure and should be avoided to allow the patient to survive the acute phase after Re-LDLT [26]. None of the Re-LDLT cases in our study involved the development of postoperative HAT; the introduction of microsurgical reconstruction might have contributed to this good result. In the Re-LDLT cases, re-laparotomy after primary LDLT and gastrointestinal complications after Re-LDLT had a negative impact on patient survival. Strong bowel adhesion caused by re-laparotomy after primary LDLT might have made the operative time longer and led to complications that affected feasibility, such as ileus or bowel perforation after Re-LDLT [27].",

In case 4, the patient had pulmonary hypertension before Re-LDLT and had been treated by epoprostenol sodium (prostacyclin sodium, Flolan\u00ae). Based on the preoperative investigations for pulmonary hypertension, it was decided that the patient would be able to withstand the Re-LDLT operation. Death occurred due to pulmonary hypertension, which suggests the need for further study and appropriate assessment before operation. In case 6, the patient showed a poor nutritional condition due to intractable diarrhea, which developed due to the patient\u2019s primary disease (PFIC-1). The patient\u2019s condition may have led to vulnerability to infection after Re-LDLT. At present, the gastrointestinal symptoms of PFIC-1 are not cured even by liver transplantation; thus, we have to carefully judge whether Re-LDLT is an appropriate treatment for steatohepatitis after primary LDLT in PFIC-1 patients. After 3 expired cases, the indications for Re-LDLT in our institution had become strict and these circumstances reflected in the difference in the number of the patients for whom Re-LDLT was not indicated between the early and later (1998\u20132009, 2010\u20132015) periods of this study.
