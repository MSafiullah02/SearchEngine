Using phylogenetic path analysis, we examine how biological factors 10 interact with price to influence online protected parrot trade volumes in China, using 11 transactions recorded for 46 species (n = 5,862 individuals). Trade was greatest in 12 smaller, faster breeding species that commanded a lower price. This price effect 13 followed the economic law of demand, with Relatively Inelastic Demand (-0.758), 14 outweighing indicators of 'quality' such as body coloration, and conservation status. 15 We identify two areas of concern: those larger, slower-breeding, rarer species, even 16 though sold at lower numbers, may be at conservation risk if harvested from the wild.",

            "text": "Wildlife trade threatens global biodiversity. Parrots are at particular threat 30 because they are desirable as pets (Gonzalez, 2003; Drews, 2001; Pires, 2012) . Wild 31 parrot populations have declined over recent decades, with nearly 30% of 355 species 32 currently threatened with extinction (Donald et. al, 2010) . Although among the most 33 threatened bird orders in the world (Juniper and Parr, 1998) , detailed studies on the 34 (un-)sustainability of parrot harvesting and trading are lacking (Beissinger and Bucher, 35 1992; Gilardi and James, 2006) , as are studies evaluating parrot welfare when held or 36 bred in captivity, given that they are comparably intelligent and long-lived birds 37 (Meehan and Mench, 2006; Engebretson, 2006) , prone to traumatic stress (Yenkosky 38 et al., 2010) . 39 In Mexico, Europe and the USA, certain parrot species command a premium 40 price, linked to striking coloration or rarity. This leads to a disproportionate number of 41 these most expensive species being poached from the wild (Tella and Hiraldo, 2014) . 42 However, price creates a balance between supply and demand; when desirable goods 43 are expensive, trade volumes are typically lower, causing sales volumes to 44 self-regulate (Harris et al., 2015) . For example, the price of pangolin products is 45 increasing, seemingly due to desirability driving ever-greater consumer demand in 46 China and Vietnam, with supply restricted by regulation and risk of prosecution 47 (Challender et al., 2015) . Consumer sensitivity to price (price elasticity of demand, 48 PED) is quantified as the relative percentage change in quantities purchased in 49 response to a one percent change in price (Walelign et al., 2019) . PED further divides 50 into Perfectly Elastic Demand (\u221e), Perfectly Inelastic Demand (0), Relatively Elastic 51 Demand (> 1), Relatively Inelastic Demand (< 1), and Unitary Elasticity Demand (= 52 1). Phylogenetic path analyses enable a more expansive analysis of quality-quantity 53 wildlife trade dynamics (Hardenberg and Gonzalez-Voyer, 2013; Gonzalez-Voyer and 54 von Hardenberg, 2014) . This method can account for species non-independence due 55 to shared ancestry, and describe dependencies within sets of variables.",

It seems probable that those more expensive parrot species, 277 representing a considerable financial investment for breeders or consumers, may 278 receive better welfare as a result of their value, where companion animals with a 279 higher monetary value are often better cared for (Vermeulen and Odendaal, 1993) ; 280 however, the cumulative compromised welfare of smaller, less valuable species may 281 be considerable (Pires 2012) . companion birds and fostering an interest that may transcend into concern for the 289 conservation of these fascinating species in the wild.

We76 amassed 44,597 screenshots of illegal advertisements of parrots listed in China's List of 77 Fauna under Special State Protection (1989) and/or CITES Appendices I, II. 78 Transaction information included 'species' (verified from the sellers' description and 79 photographs), 'unit price' (i.e. price per single item) and 'successful transactions', 80 which provided the number of individual animals traded and received during the 30 81 days preceding our survey (1 transaction = 1 animal traded; Ye et al., 2020; Liu et al., 82 2020) (Figure 1). According to the annotations provided by some vendors, despite 83 variations in size (and value) all parrot species could be shipped to consumers across 84 China via express delivery for a standard fee scaled by parcel size and shipping 85 distance, except to buyers in remote areas in Tibet and Xinjiang, where more expensive 86 4charges applied. We selected price data randomly from no more than ten 87 advertisements per species. Mean price per species was converted into US dollars 88 (US$1:RMB\u00a56.759) and compared with trade volumes across surveys.

The 94 vender's names and the user names of the operators are hidden by mosaic. status of species: The conservation status of each parrot species 99 sold was obtained from the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species (IUCN 2019). Our 100 dataset included species classified as 'Least Concern' (Status = 1), 'near threatened' 101 (Status = 2), vulnerable (Status = 3), and endangered (Status = 4), but did not include 102 any species classified as 'Data Deficient', 'Critically Endangered', 'Extinct in the 103 Wild' or 'Extinct'. Red List status is an ordinal categorization of an underlying 104 continuous variable; however, our phylogenetic generalized least squares (PGLSs) 105 analysis required continuous response variables (Martins and Hansen, 1997). We thus 106 assumed that this status (coded as indicated above) reflected continuous variation in 107 vulnerability to extinction (following Purvis et al., 2000; Fritz et al., 2009; 108 Gonzalez-Voyer et al., 2016). 109 ii) Extent of occurrence (km 2 ): a measure was defined as the area contained within 110 the shortest continuous boundary encompassing all the known, inferred, or projected 111 sites of present occurrence of a taxon, excluding vagrancy, acquired from BirdLife 112 International (2019). 113 iii) Morphological traits: Plumage color from scanned images of adult male parrots 114 from Parrots (Juniper and Parr, 1998) was converted from RGB L*a*b* color mode to 115 Lab color mode using Adobe Photoshop CS6 software, based on the human perception 116 of color (International Commission on Illumination, 1976). Body mass (grams) for 117 each species was obtained from Iwaniuk (2005) and the Handbook of the Birds of the 118 World Alive (del Hoyo et al., 2019, HBW). Lengths of wing, tail, bill and tarsus were 119 obtained from Parrots(Juniper and Parr,1998)  applying residuals from observed minus 120 predicted lengths based on log-log regression controlling for body mass effect.

Interestingly,206    however, consumer sales patterns had Relatively Inelastic Demand(Walelign et al.,   207    2019), and, contrary to expectations, sales volumes did not decrease linearly in 208 proportion to price increase -rather the market sustained higher prices in relation to209 trade volume [1:-0.758]. This is revealing of the leverage effect of price, which does 210 not simply cause fewer more expensive parrots to be traded. A better understanding of 211 these patterns requires further inclusion of socioeconomic covariates (i.e., household 212 income and household size), offline trading and consumer preferences on biological 213 traits, also substituting sales trends of other pets into models. 214 The majority of C2C trading we documented involved cheaper, smaller species 215 with shorter generation lengths, and so we infer that these sales prices would only be 216 profitable if these parrots were being bred in captivity. In support of the extensive role 217 of captive breeding, Ye et al. (2020) reported that 43 of these 46 nationally and 218 internationally protected parrot species (5,798 of the 5,862 individuals) traded on 219 Taobao.com are not native to China, or even to Asia. Of these 46 species, 18 are 220 indigenous to South America, and 14 to Australia and eastern Indonesia. Furthermore, 221 Ye et al. (2020) reported that only 292 parrots (eight species) were seized by China's 222 border authorities during the period 1976-2015; far too small a number to suggest 223 trafficking was supplying consumer demand.
