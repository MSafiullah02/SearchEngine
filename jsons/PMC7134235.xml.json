Adults are advised to engage in a minimum of 150 min of moderate-to-vigorous-intensity physical activity (PA) per week to reduce the risk of chronic diseases like hypertension, diabetes, and obesity [2, 3]. Physical inactivity can be reduced by walking, which is an inexpensive form of exercise for many adults and requires no special equipment [2, 4]. The adoption and use of consumer wearable health device (CWHD) for PA tracking is increasing. This increase is evident in wearable health technologies retaining the top-three global fitness trends since 2016, taking the first spot in 2016, 2017, and 2019 [5].",

To do this, CWHDs have features that support continuous monitoring and recording of physiological (e.g. heart rate, sleep pattern, blood sugar levels, and so on) and PA data (e.g. duration of PA, distance covered, energy expended, and so forth) [6, 7]. To promote healthy habits, CWHDs incorporate behavioural change techniques like goal setting, self-monitoring, feedback, social influence, and reward [8]. In South Africa, the uptake of CWHDs are on the rise, especially among health-conscious individuals in the urban areas. This increase can partly be attributed to new practice by health insurers who use incentives to motivate their members to use wearable health device to track their PA [9].",

            "text": "In addition to the increase in the adoption of CWHDs by health-conscious individuals to track PA, wearable health devices are also used for remote monitoring of people with chronic disease conditions [6, 10, 11]. In both of these usage conditions, it is important that the data collected by the device is accurate. Inaccurate data from wearable health devices could lead to dire consequences, especially when the device is integrated with healthcare applications [12]. Manufacturers of CWDHs often make strong claims about the accuracy and reliability of their devices [13]. However, there are genuine concerns over the accuracy of the data collected by CWHDs [14]. For example accelerometer and pedometer-based CWHDs are known to be inaccurate in their estimation of energy expended (EE), and are unable to accurately track the number of steps in PA like cycling [6, 7]. Users of CWHDs expect, and are increasingly demanding that manufacturers deliver on their promises. The two class action lawsuits filed by users against one of the major manufacturers of CWHD in 2016 underscore the importance of accurate and reliable data collected by CWHDs [15]. Hence, it is no surprise that many researchers from developed countries [16\u201318] are focusing on the accuracy of the data collected by CWHDs. As discussed later in Sect. 3, all the papers analyzed in this systematic literature review (SLR) were published by authors from developed countries. This points to an apparent dearth of studies that focus on the accuracy of the data collected by CWHDs by researchers from developed countries, including Africa. To address this gap, this research investigates the factors that influence the accuracy of the data collected by CWHDs. More specifically the research focuses on the accuracy of the data generated from heart rate measurement, PA, and sleep monitoring. The research question that we address in the paper is: \u201cWhat are the factors that influence the accuracy of the data collected by consumer health wearable devices?\u201d.",

Using optical sensors, changes in the blood volume of body tissues can be detected by shining light on the surface of the skin to detect discoloration when oxygen-rich blood is \u2018flushed\u2019 underneath the skin [12, 20].Pedometer and accelerometer: Pedometer is a lightweight device with sensor that measures the number of steps taken or the distance covered. Accelerometer measures PA by detecting movements across three planes (side-to-side, up-and-down, or forward-and-backward) [21].Actigraphy: This is a non-invasive, wrist-worn device that comes with accelerometer to measure sleep pattern by distinguishing between the states of wakefulness and sleep unobtrusively. This is based on the premise that limited movement is associated with sleep while increased movement is linked with wakefulness [22, 23].\n",

This makes finger-based PPG sensors more accurate.

The majority of CWHDs that utilize PPG sensors for monitoring heart rate come with green light PPG (gPPG) [12, 24, 25]. However, red light PPG (rPPG) sensors (i.e. pulse oximeters) are commonly used in clinical environments [12, 25\u201327]. rPPG sensors have a number of advantages over gPPG sensors. The green light in gPPG sensors emits shorter wavelengths and does not penetrate deeper into the innermost layer of the skin. In contrast, rPPG sensors can penetrate deeper into the skin because the human body does not absorb the red light [25, 26]. This property enables rPPG sensors to detect other biological signals like the arterial oxygen saturation, respiration, and blood pressure [24, 26, 27]. In addition, rPPG light is not absorbed by melanin (the pigmentation that is responsible for the colour of the human skin) but gPPG light absorbs melanin. Therefore, the skin colour does not influence the accuracy of heart rate measurements when using rPPG sensors. In contrast, darker skin colours influence the accuracy of gPPG sensors [19, 26, 28].",

The unnatural setting and the need for a sleep technologist to set up PSG equipment make its use impractical in a home setting. Consumer wearable sleep monitoring sensors, called actigraphy, is a non-invasive wrist-worn device that comes with accelerometer, heart rate, and respiratory monitor to detect and record the movements of the wearer at regular intervals in order to estimate sleep and wakefulness [13, 22, 23, 30, 31].",

The placement of a PA sensor and the speed of walking are some of the factors that could influence its accuracy. Pedometers are less accurate when the sensor is attached to the wrist or hip, compared to ankle-based pedometers. Similarly, slower walking speed, unsteady and uneven gaits influence accuracy [33\u201336]. In the case of accelerometers, Nelson et al. [6] found that wrist-worn accelerometers are more accurate than hip-worn sensors. However, Simpson et al.

PDR algorithms are more accurate in their estimation of distance covered when the tracking device is attached to the foot [40].

Smaller devices are easier to carry, but do not always have longer battery life. Conversely, longer battery life is commonly associated with bigger size devices [47, 48].
