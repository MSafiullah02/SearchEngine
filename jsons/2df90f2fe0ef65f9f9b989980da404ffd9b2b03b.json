For individuals and institutions around the world, this constellation of mobile phones, personal computers, the internet, software, games, and other computing objects have supported a complex set of religious and spiritual needs. In this paper, I offer a survey of emerging and emergent techno-spiritual practices, and the anxieties surrounding their uptake. I am interested in particular in the ways in which religious uses of technology represent not only a critique of dominant visions of technology's futures, but also suggest a very different path(s) for ubiquitous computing's technology envisioning and development.",

Bell am casting ICTs broadly to include personal computers, public computing sites (i.e.: cyber cafes, web-kiosks and gaming arcades), the Internet, software, games, accessories and gadgets (i.e.: USB flash keys, etc), mobile phones, other wireless devices and the various infrastructures that support them. And indeed recent surveys of internet habits, corporate marketing strategies, and new product developments, all point to the fact that there is a growing (perhaps already grown) segment of the population that uses technology to support religious practices, what I am calling \"techno-spiritual practices\". Some of these techno-spiritual re-purposings have been documented [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] , some have been theorized [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] , and some have been playfully and thoughtfully explored and elaborated [16] [17] [18] , and there is certainly a growing literature about the impact of new technologies on Islamic practice [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] , and wellrehearsed arguments on technological avoidances and resistances in certain religious communities [24] [25] . For the most part, however, religious or spiritual relationships to, and usages of, ICTs seem to be marginalized to the realm of technological oddities, fodder for cheeky web logs and the occasional appearance in the pages of the New York Times or Wired, written off as just another trend.",

Furthermore, as I have argued elsewhere [26] that ubicomp's frame of reference should extend to include any ICT that has a ubiquitous presence, this re-purposing could also be a subject of regular discussion or activities, developments and deployments in the ubiquitous computing (ubicomp) community. These techno-spiritual re-purposings are important for the ways in which they highlight alternate paradigms for technology creation, deployment, consumption and resistance, as well as pointing to different communities, practices and habits that could be supported. Furthermore, these repurposings seems to be of critical importance as the realm of technological infrastructure extends progressively beyond the office, into the home, and many other points of social and cultural significance, including one presumes, places of worship, ritual and meditation. After all, life also happens in the sacred domain.",

Informed by contemporary anthropological theory, the research followed a range of ICTs through seven different sites of production, consumption and resistance, encompassing urban life in India, China, Malaysia, Singapore, Korea, Indonesia and Australia. I relied on a range of ethnographic methods and methodologies, including participant observation, semistructured interviews, 'deep hanging-out', and genealogies of ICTs to explore life in one hundred very different Asian households. Throughout the fieldwork process, and on many occasions since then, I have been stuck by the ways in which people's narratives of technology (and life) carried strong references to religious practices, spiritual life and ritual. However, whilst this paper is informed by that research, it does not represent a report on a bounded project that set out to investigate technology and religion at a set of specific sites; rather it is theoretical intervention into the ways in which we constitute ubiquitous computing and what we imagine to be its primary foci. As such, this paper is classic ethnographic intervention -it is descriptive and",

The company, which was not named in the proceedings, promised to answer people's prayer with a text message from Jesus [1] . This service, ruled spam through a complex set of maneuvers that included a determination that Jesus did not own a mobile phone, is but one manifestation of the increasing visible intersections of spiritual practice and technological development world wide. The Church of Jesus Christ of the Latter-day Saints runs the world's largest online genealogical service; religiously inspired web logs, portals, bulletin boards, dating sites and chat rooms are flourishing the world over; the Vatican has its own text message service and pod casts, and Pope Benedict XVI his own iPod. Christian gaming software is attracting a strong following, Hindi gods have their own websites, and there is an ongoing debate about the use of Cairo's nascent wireless cloud to broadcast a single call to prayer from the city's many minaret towers.

A survey of these new technologies of enlightenment -that is ICTs being repurposed support a range of non-secular activities -reveals unexpected richness and complexity.

Most Telegu houses have such symbols painted at their doorways, as do many other Indian homes. To an untrained eye, these symbols appear to be little more than decoration. However, at a metaphoric level, this design and the practices it indexes suggest a very different conception of relationships between public and private spaces than found in many western homes. Furthermore, it alludes to a complex framing of danger and security that could imply new home networking, virus alerts and infrastructure securities solutions. What if protection is not about repelling attack, but courting good fortune? Might this inspire different design choices, different rhetorics, and even different technologies?",

For others, it is about praying every day, or visiting the temple, or the mosque, or church, or consulting the ngongli [lunar almanac], or counting the rosary. It might be individual activities, or those which connect an individual to a broader community of practice or perhaps a larger community undertaking. All of these practices are part of the fabric of daily life. In fact, in many cultures it is impossible to delineate between religious practices and beliefs and the larger structuring of society. In countless and not always subtle, ways religion shapes ideas about time, space and social relationships. Think, for instance, about the ways in which religion impacts the calendars; our distinctions between work days and rest days, holidays (i.e.: Christmas, Passover, Diwali), the reckoning of new years, even when the calendar commences are all products of various forms of religious thought. And this is as true for the major prophetic religions (i.e. Christianity, Buddhism, Hinduism, Islam and Judaism), as it is for more 'pre-axial' religions, including most First Nation religions. And while some nations might define themselves as secular, or endorse no state religion (the United States for instance), given than more than threequarters of the world identifies itself as religious, religious identification seems a significant part of what it means to be human. There is some debate about the exact figures here, but there are approximately 2 billion Christians, 1.3 billion Muslims, 900 million Hindus, 360 million Buddhists and 225 million people practicing Chinese traditional religions. In addition there are an estimated 95 million practitioners of African religions; more than 150 million people glossed as 'indigenous' religions, 23 million Sikhs, 14 million Jews, and at least 1 million neo-pagans (including 70,000 individuals in New Zealand who declare themselves followers of the Jedi Faith). And of course there are many people who identify with two religious faithspredominantly indigenous peoples. There are also estimate to approximately 15% of the world's population that is 'non-religious', secular, agnostic and atheist this includes many whose governments declare their populations 'agnostic.' There are few other practices or shaping narratives that impact so much of humanity.",

In 2000, in one of the first and only attempts I can find to include the spiritual in conversations about technology development, more than 50 people attended a special interest group session at the annual Computer Human Interaction Conference. The session framed around the question \"Can We Have Spiritual Experiences online?\" was apparently a lively one. In the paper that followed that session, participants wrote: \"the dominant design rhetorics of design work in humancomputer interactions (command-and-control; constant updates and interruptions of new information; fast-action games; denotative, explicit clarity rather than connotative, exploratory ambiguity) worked against what we called the \"inner stillness\" of spiritual life\" [11: 82] . This opposition of HCI and a spiritual life reinforces the idea that technology and religion must exist in constant tension; each precluding a complete fulfillment of the other. In 2005, Joseph Jofish Kaye and I organized a workshop at the first Ethnographic Praxis in Industry conference, in which we sought to foreground and explore this tension [30] .",

This positioning is of course, deeply ironic, and oddly a-historical. After all, in the West, there is a long and complex relationship between technology and religion; religious institutions have been quick to adopt the advances that allowed them to operate with greater efficiencies and/or efficacies [34] .

It is this dialectic that is particularly important when thinking about the interplay of new technologies and religious practice.

This attention to the cultural life of technology might help, in part, to explain why the tension between religion and technology is not felt so acutely in other parts of the world. In the western tradition, especially in this late capitalist, post-Enlightenment era, ICTs are linked to the cultural narratives of progress, change and even revolution. Without engaging in a kind of techno-orientalism, I think it is possible to argue that ICTs (and technology more broadly) map to alternate cultural discourses within Islam, Hinduism and Confucianism, just to name a few. This alternate mapping could produce different kinds of anxieties, adoption patterns and even framings of computational offerings. As such, throughout this paper, I will be cataloging techno-spiritual practices from a range of different religious and cultural traditions.",

In this paper, I propose to revisit the notion of defamiliarization as a way of unpacking and exposing our own assumptions about the kinds of work that technology could or should do. Here I am mindful of Marx's charge that religion sometimes functions as an opiate for the masses, and I am acutely aware of current geo-political sensitivities to issues of religion. One of the hallmarks of ethnographic epistemology is rigorous attention to and practice of critical reflexivity. By this I mean, that within ethnographic modes of inquiry and production, the subjectivity of the researcher is an important component -knowing who I am helps the reader situate my analysis and critique. As Ruth Frankenberg [60] has recently argued, in turning the ethnographic lens on contemporary religious practice, a nod towards reflexivity becomes more than just perfunctory. I am a cultural anthropologist with a primary concern in information technology as a site of cultural production and the consequences for technology innovation and diffusion. I am also the child of a symbolic anthropologist, and I grew up straddling multiple domains of religious signification in Australia -Catholicism and Catholic schooling; indigenous religious practices; a strongly agnostic home life; and close familial relationships with cultural and practicing Judaism. I am, as an Indian woman with whom I once worked described me, \"a free thinker\". As such, I find myself more interested in the study of religious practice than I am in endorsing a particular vein of religious dogma.",

Irrespective of government structure, scratch the surface of almost any nation, you will find an unexpectedly rich landscape of techno-spiritual practices.

The contours of American usage of the internet appear well documented: web-surfing, communication, data gathering, personal finances, e-commerce, gaming, pornography, gambling. Yet, according to a recent report by the Pew Internet and American Life Project, 64% of online Americans have also used the internet for religious or spiritual purposes [6] -this includes sending and receiving email and digital greeting cards with spiritual content, reading news accounts of religious events and affairs, and seeking information about religious holidays, services and events. These 128 million Americans utilizing the web for religious practices outnumber Americans gambling, using web auction sites, trading stock or doing online banking [6] . And whilst the slim majority of these users were female and little older, research at the University of North Carolina suggests that three times more teenagers access the web for religious purposes than for pornography [61] . This might suggest that younger Americans, often heralded as the internet generation take the religious aspects of the web as a given. American churches too have embraced ICTs deploying wireless networks, utilizing PowerPoint, websites and DVDs, as well as videoconferencing and email to connect with their parishioners -several interesting studies are underway to explore the impact of such deployments on church and spiritual life [62] [63] [64] , and others are testing the relationship between religiosity and internet use in America [65] . And one can well imagine a series of projects exploring aspects of spiritual and religious practice as they related to ideas of community -and there is certainly much to suggest that ICTs can play a role in community building, as well as emotional and motivational support [11, 54, [66] [67] [68] . So if this is what is happening in the United States, an apparently well documented population when it comes to technology consumption, what might be happening elsewhere, slightly out of line of site? In the rest of this section, I provide a survey of techno-spiritual practices in both the mobile and internet spaces -in so doing, I hope to defamiliarize these seemingly familiar technologies and suggest alternate paradigms and patterns of use.",

Indeed, the intimate nature of mobile phones has lent themselves to all manner of inclusion within religious systems of practice [7] . Some practices extend an individual's spiritual capacity, allowing participation in events that would otherwise be geographic impossible. For instance, it is now possible to place a prayer at the Wailing Wall in Jerusalem via text-messages through a Russian mobile service provider. The text of the prayer is printed out and deposited at the Wall; the text also appears on a public display screen near the Wall [69] . This kind of remote participation extends into other domains of religious and spiritual activity too. Until March of 2003, in the Philippines, it was possible to send your confession and receive absolution via text message on a mobile phone; you could also confess via email or fax. This practice, which was obviously growing, came to light when a local Monsignor ruled that electronically mediated confessions were no longer acceptable, nor was granting absolution via the same mechanisms. Monsignor Cornel said \"We have to protect that confidentiality and we insist on personal confession of the penitent to the priests\" [70] . The security of the channel and the fidelity of the message seemed in question; according to one report, the Bishops were concerned about the confidentiality of confession and the sacrament. Whilst confession via SMS might represent a kind of rational efficiency, it thwarts much of the religious intent of confession as a semi-public act of contrition and subsequent state of grace which many would argue can only transpire inside a church. One suspects that providing greater levels of security provisions for electronically mediated communication is not the answer here.",

For US$0.15 per day, subscribers to the 'papa on' service were treated to thoughts and prayers from the Pope, including \"as long as there is the spring of the spirit, good blooms\" and \"one should never stop praying for peace.\" There were more than 2 million subscribers to the service by the end of March 2003.

For devout Muslims, there is an expectation that one must pray at five particular times of the day, in a mosque if possible, but always facing Ka'bah in the city of Mecca. This direction is called qiblah or qiblat. In Malaysia, a self-styled 'modern' Muslim country, the latest generation of mobile phones allows users (through a simple software application) to find Mecca, via a 'm-qiblat' service. You can also download the Koran to your palm-pilot, and synchronize it to local prayer times for 1100 cities around the world. In 2003, Ilkone Mobile Telecommunications launched a new 3G cellular handset for the Middle East with the tagline: your phone, your life. This new handset explicitly caters to Islamic users. It has GPS-like functions which enable the handset to point its user to Mecca from any point on the globe and determine the appropriate local times to pray, polyphonic sound, Bluetooth capacities and the use of wireless networks can bring any user the call to prayer in the live voice; it calculates fasting times for Ramadan and has the entire of the Koran in Arabic and English stored on the handset. It also offers a mosque-function which disables the phone for a short period of time at salat so as not to inadvertently ring during prayer. This function can be read as a direct challenge to the notion of constant connectivity that periodically pervades ubicomp discourse. Here a technology is designed to be disconnected, rather than always-on. In thinking about designing for techno-spiritual practices, we might have to consider a different range of practices and priorities, and conceptualization of space and location that is driven by a broader set of use patterns. The Ilkone phone is a powerful reminder of the importance meditation, prayer or quiet time in sacred spaces is accorded in most religious systems.",

The fire transforms the paper into real artifacts in the world that the ancestors now inhabit. In addition to the funeral pyres, paper objects are also burnt at QingMing. Every year, Chinese people around the world visit the tombs of their ancestors to sweep the graves clean -this ritual time known as QingMing (or ChingMing) has been part of the Chinese calendar since the 700s. Traditionally, people burnt paper currency and also paper representations of common household good -clothes, furniture, food, and other luxury goods. Throughout the Chinese disaspora, a range of technologies have been added to the paper array burnt at funerals and QingMing, including televisions, fans, air-conditioners, mobile phones and computers including both laptops and PCs. In at least two Malaysian cities in which I conducted fieldwork, QingMing had been not only an occasion for tending ancestral tombs, but also for upgrading the mobile phones of the ancestors, as well as providing them with additional pre-paid phone cards. This tending of the ancestors' telecommunication needs was all done through the burning of paper representations. This techno-spiritual practice reflects not only the centrality of mobile phones in Malaysian culture, but also the ways in which they have been seamlessly embedded in the daily life of the living and clearly that of the dead.",

When we bless something, we are seeking to change its disposition -to eliminate negative things that come from that particular object -and we generate the motivation that the use of that object will be very positive and beneficial \u2026The person using the Internet has the choice.

In February of 2004, the Church of England launched a 'virtual parish' or i-church, \"for people who travel a great deal or are unable to attend regularly, i-church can support them spiritually wherever they are in the world.\" The Church also announced it an opened a search for a pastor to oversee this new parish.",

Throughout 2002, Falun Gong hacked various Chinese television infrastructures, including local cable television and even SinoSat (one of Chinese national communication satellites), to send out messages about the group to the general public. Similarly, the group has found ways to take advantage of Chinese language chat rooms to spread their message; they have leafleted entire communities with video-discs, and they have used automated phone calling systems to call multiple numbers and play a recorded message.

All kinds of different peoples and communities have already asserted the importance of their own cultural practices and co-opted ICTs accordingly. But what might it look like if we explicitly imagined religion and spirituality as part of Weiser's \"natural human environment\"? In his wonderfully textured story of Sal and her daily life, however, these are missing. Sal's life moves between two dominant sites of cultural production -the home and the office; it moves between two modes -leisure and work. Nowhere is there a sense of Sal's inner spiritual life -indeed, one might think she did not have one.

This consideration of social frameworks and physical environments led Weiser's team to propose calm computing as a way of managing the consequences of a ubiquitous computing environment. Weiser and Brown wrote, \"if computers are everywhere they better stay out of the way, and that means designing them so that the people being shared by the computers remain serene and in control. Calmness is a new challenge that UC brings to computing \u2026 Calmness is a fundamental challenge for all technology design of the next fifty years\" [88] . Gaver and others have called for an interleaving of computational and everyday worlds through the trope of ambiguity -creating possibilities for other sorts of experiences and meaning making around technologies.

The re-purposing of ICTs for religious practices challenges some basic assumptions about what makes good technology; if not about efficiency and speed, then what?

Religious systems' cultural logic necessarily impact the very ways in which new technologies are created, consumed, and indeed rejected. Our desire to bring new technologies into our homes; the persistence of values such as simplicity, grace, humility, modesty, and purity; and ideas about modernity, subjectivity, and the self are all implicated in shaping the contexts for new technologies.

Li's grandfather died in the fall after a long and prosperous life. After his cremation, the family added a new wing to their ancestor hall online. Different family members add photos, video, even long forgotten conversations. Li sends her own contributions -the smell of her grandfather's study with its cedar boxes of ancient calligraphy that her grandfather collected and preserved. Once the addition is complete, the family's various ancestral tablets are updated. Li's tablet resets itself and her grandfather's name joins the list of other names that can be seen in Li's hallway. The tablet emits the smell of burning incense to alert Li to the presence of her grandfather's name. At QingMing, families gather to 'sweep' clean their family tombs and feed, clothe and care for their ancestors. For Li's family, ancestral tablets around the world sound chimes to gather family members across different time zones. Li brings oranges and paper money to her hallway, the ancestral tablets glow more brightly as more and more family members stand before them in care of their ancestors. Daniel lives with his parents in a satellite suburb of Chicago, he is eleven years old. Daniel has always lived in America, but he has cousins in Europe and the Middle East. In fact, his parents are the only ones who live in America. Still the whole family tries to gather once a year, usually for Passover. The adults like to spend time together talking about the happenings of the previous year, the ups and downs of business, family life, politics \u2026 but for the kids, it is a chance to get together and play. This year, Daniel's parents won't be able to travel; there are just too many uncertainties and dangers, but they will still make it to the family Seder. In Europe, the extended family is taking advantage of their newly remodeled 'smart' home to create a 'digital'/real Seder. The kitchen is recorded and broadcasting the smell of brisket being prepared -in Daniel's kitchen he can smell faint hints of this traditional meal. It is also wafting to his cousin's house in Jordan. Later in the evening, the whole family will participate in the Haggadah -with the family taking it in turns to read. And because Daniel is the youngest, he will ask the Four Questions. Voices carry across thousands of miles -the traditional arguments and jokes. And the smell of food lingers. Aunty Rebecca has projected an orange onto everyone's Seder plate, again. And Daniel's grandparents have found a way to hide the afikomen (it's in Daniel's kitchen, projected onto the fridge). Seders in Daniel's family go on for hours. And this year, he is really missing his cousins at the kid's table, but his parents have created a virtual kid's table for him, and all the cousins are gathered there too. They joke around, reciting when they are called upon, and stealing food from their parent's plates.",
