According to the latest nationally representative cross-sectional survey among 170287 participants in 2013 in mainland China, the overall prevalence of diabetes was 10.9% in adults and 20.2% in the elderly [4] . Patients with diabetes are more susceptible to be infected by bacteria, viruses, and fungus than individuals without diabetes owing to relatively lower immune function [5, 6] . As a result, these patients might be at an increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and consequently poor prognosis. Although many studies have described the clinical characteristics of COVID-19, so far [1, 7, 8, 9] , information with respect to diabetes among these patients, has not been well characterized yet. In the current study, we retrospectively reviewed the clinical data of 258 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19, and compared the differences in clinical characteristics, laboratory markers, treatment strategies, and short-term prognosis including death between patients with and without diabetes. We hope that these findings will provide new insights into the risk stratification, disease management, and therapeutic strategies for COVID-19 patients with diabetes.",

Here, we reported a higher prevalence rate of diabetes in these patients, which might be due to the larger proportion of geriatric patients infected by SARS-CoV-2 in our study. The median age of all the participants was 64 years old, which was older than the data previously reported [1, 7, 8 ]. In the current study, 53.5% of the patients were male, and the percentage is similar to that reported by Wang et al [8] and Zhang et al [16] . Besides diabetes mellitus, hypertension (38.0%) and cardiovascular diseases (15.1%) were also common underlying chronic illness, and COVID-19 patients with diabetes seemed to have more comorbidities of cardiovascular diseases and chronic kidney diseases in the current study.",

During hospitalization, patients with diabetes were more likely to receive antibiotic therapy as well. Decreased lymphocytes count and eosinophil count were also common in these patients; this was consistent with the results of previous studies [16] . However, no significant differences were found in the cell counts and percentage lymphocytes and eosinophil count between COVID-19 patients with or without diabetes. The data revealed that COVID-19 patients with diabetes had a higher NLR, which was recently reported as a predictor of severity of COVID-19 in the early stage [17] .",

Secondly, due to the massive number of patients and the lack of medical resources, the interval from the onset of the illness to hospital admission was more than 10 days for most patients, which could further complicate and deteriorate their condition. Nevertheless, patients with diabetes had a similar interval from onset of illness to hospital admission compared with those without diabetes. Thirdly, at the time of the study submission, most of the patients were not discharged yet, and the final survival outcome could not have been determined, and the long-term prognosis was not observed.
