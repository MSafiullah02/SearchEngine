            "text": "Quantitative infection risk assessment can serve as a useful tool in epidemic modeling, parametric studies on disease transmission and evaluating the effectiveness of infection control measures. It describes the infection risk of an individual or a population to an infectious disease quantitatively. Infection risk is expressed by a probability of infection between 0 and 1. By comparing infection risks, the influence of different environmental factors on disease transmission and the effectiveness of different infection control measures can be evaluated. Quantitative infection risk assessment can also be used in epidemiological studies such as outbreak investigations. Currently, there are two approaches to quantitative infection risk assessment of respiratory diseases, which can be transmitted via the airborne route: the Wells\u2013Riley model and the dose\u2010response model. The Wells\u2013Riley equation was developed by Riley and colleagues in an epidemiological study on a measles outbreak (Riley et al., 1978). The equation is based on the concept of \u2018quantum of infection\u2019 as proposed by Wells (1955) and is therefore termed the Wells\u2013Riley equation. The Wells\u2013Riley model has been extensively used in analyzing ventilation strategy and its association to airborne infections in clinical environments (e.g., Escombe et al., 2007; Fennelly and Nardell, 1998; Nardell et al., 1991). The dose\u2010response relationship is used to describe the effect on organisms from the exposure to different doses of chemicals, drugs, radiation, bio\u2010agents, or other stressors. Risk assessment models based on the dose\u2010response relationship are called dose\u2010response models. Originally, dose\u2010response models were mainly used for risk assessment of hazardous chemicals. They were then developed for assessing the infection risk of foodborne and waterborne pathogens (Haas, 1983). Some newer studies have proposed to use dose\u2010response models for assessing the infection risk of airborne\u2010transmissible pathogens (e.g., Armstrong and Haas, 2007a; Nicas, 1996; Sze To et al., 2008). This article reviews the fundamental theories, formulations, model developments, and modifications of these two approaches. The strengths and limitations of the two approaches to infection risk assessment as well as to outbreak investigations are compared. Suggestions on further development of risk assessment models regarding their limitations are proposed.",

The infectivity term describes the probability of each infectious particle to initiate the infection. It should be noticed that in the first interpretation, a unity infectivity term implies that the host is completely vulnerable to the pathogen. This will make the Wells\u2013Riley equation only suitable for diseases such as tuberculosis, in which the definition of tuberculosis infection fulfills this condition (Huebner et al., 1993). A unity infectivity term also indicates that one quantum is equal to one infectious particle/pathogen and makes the model deterministic, because the individual is determined to be infected if his/her intake dose is equal to or greater than one pathogen. The first interpretation has also assumed that all inhaled infectious particles will successfully deposit on the target infection site in the respiratory tracts, which is not correct in general. Adopting the second interpretation, the equation is applicable to many diseases and it is a stochastic model. Respiratory deposition of infectious particles is implicitly considered in the calculated quanta generation rate. The calculated quanta generation rate will be a combination of infectivity of the pathogen and the infectious source strength in the outbreak. When the Wells\u2013Riley equation is used in risk assessment of pathogens with a threshold dose greater than one pathogen, it will provide more conservative assessment results at low intake doses. A more accurate approach is to use a multiple\u2010hit exponential form (Haas, 1983; Nicas et al., 2005).",

Following the tolerance dose concept, infectious dose data are interpreted as the dose of pathogens that exceeds the tolerance dose of a portion of the population. For example, 50% infectious dose (ID50) exceeds the tolerance dose of half of the susceptible population. When each person in a susceptible population intakes a dose of the pathogen equal to ID50, half of the people will be infected. When the frequency distribution of this tolerance dose is known, the infection risk of a certain intake dose can be assessed. Figure 1 illustrates this idea. The cumulative curve describes the dose\u2010response relationship. When each member of a susceptible population receives the same dose of pathogens, the infection risk is equal to the (cumulative) relative frequency of infection at this dose. The tolerance dose concept is biologically plausible in the sense that the immune status and the host\u2019s sensitivity to the pathogen vary between individuals as do their tolerance doses. In addition, some infection symptoms may only be observed after the host acquires a certain amount of pathogen in the body. However, it is not biologically plausible in the sense that the pathogens would inherently be assumed to be acting cooperatively, by which infection is the consequence of their joint action (Armitage et al., 1965; Haas, 1983).

However, some arguments suggest that threshold models do provide more accurate assessment results for some diseases, especially under low intake doses.

Therefore, the calculated q has already implicitly considered the deposition loss of infectious particles and the viability loss of pathogens in the airborne state of that outbreak case.

To consider these two influencing factors using the Wells\u2013Riley model, knowledge of the deposition and viability losses during the outbreak case is required. By substituting these two parameters into Equation 12, a quanta generation rate of the disease without implicit consideration of ventilation removal, deposition and viability losses as airborne pathogen sink mechanisms during the outbreak can be obtained. Risk assessors can then perform risk assessment with consideration of these influencing factors with Equation 12 using this quanta generation rate. Likewise, if the place of an outbreak case is equipped with ultraviolet irradiation or air filtration devices or the occupants have used respiratory protection, using Equation 1 to calculate the quanta generation rate during the outbreak will obtain a q implicitly considering these influencing factors.

Rudnick and Milton (2003) developed Equation 15 to incorporate non\u2010steady\u2010state condition, but the model still adopts the well\u2010mixed assumption. However, with their proposed concept, the equation can also incorporate spatially distributed infection risk. When the amount of exhaled breath generated by the infectors and inhaled by a susceptible person in a particular spatial location is known, the susceptible person\u2019s exposure in terms of number of quanta and the infection risk can be estimated. This can be done by conducting tracer gas measurements. In such measurements, tracer gas is released from the locations of the infectors and the concentrations of the tracer gas at the locations of each susceptible person are then measured. The amount of exhaled breath inhaled by a susceptible person can be calculated by the measured concentrations and the released concentration. This parameter can also be obtained numerically by computational fluid dynamics (CFD). A numerical model of the premises is constructed. Gas surrogate is injected into the model at the locations of the infectors and its dispersion is simulated numerically. Spatial distribution of gas concentration is then obtained and the amount of exhaled breath inhaled by the susceptible person at different locations can be calculated. Some risk assessment studies have used these approaches to incorporate spatial variation into infection risk (e.g., Gao et al., 2008; Tung and Hu, 2008).

The concept has also been found to be feasible in assessing the risk of pathogenic microorganisms. The dose\u2010response models have been widely adopted in quantitative risk assessment of infectious diseases transmitted via foodborne and waterborne routes and is recommended by the World Health Organization (2003). In waterborne and foodborne infections, as the contaminated water or food is consumed by ingestion, the pathogenic microorganism can directly reach the gastrointestinal region and hence the target site of infection. However, when assessing the risk of airborne infection, not all inhaled airborne pathogens will reach or be retained in the target infection site. Thus, the respiratory deposition of aerosols has to be considered. Exposure to airborne pathogens has to be assessed when estimating the intake dose. Exposure assessment is recognized by the National Academy of Sciences as one of the four components of the risk assessment paradigm for human health effects (National Academy of Sciences, 1983). Once the exposure level to the airborne pathogen is known, the intake dose can be estimated from the pulmonary ventilation rate and deposition fraction of the aerosols. The probability of infection can then be predicted using the dose\u2010response equation. Therefore, it is critical to obtain a realistic exposure level in the susceptibles of airborne pathogens when adopting dose\u2010response risk assessment models.",

The equation implicitly assumes that infection will occur if there is one bacillus successfully deposited on the alveolar region. Infectious particles are also assumed to have a Poisson distribution in the air. As a result, the probability of infection equals 0.63 when the exponential term equals 1. The first assumption delineates the host as completely vulnerable to the pathogen. Equation 16 is describing the probability of the susceptible person being exposed to the tuberculosis bacilli, i.e., getting a positive skin test. As having a positive skin test equates to tuberculosis infection (Huebner et al., 1993), Equation 16 is adequate for use to describe the probability of tuberculosis infection. For other diseases, the assumption that the host is completely vulnerable to the pathogen may not be appropriate. Nicas\u2019s work has shown the possibility of using the dose\u2010response model in assessing the infection risk of disease transmitted via airborne route. Nicas and his colleagues modified the equation by expressing the infectious source strength term, G, as a multiple of cough frequency, pathogen concentration in respiratory fluid and the volume of expiratory droplets introduced into the air in a cough (Nicas et al., 2005). Other sinking mechanisms for the airborne pathogen were also considered in the modified equation with a formulation similar to Equation 11.

It is also believed that the airborne mode may not be the major or only route of transmission for some respiratory diseases, such as SARS and influenza. Indirect contact transmission may be an important route of transmission for many respiratory pathogens (Beggs, 2003; Boone and Gerba, 2007). The result of risk assessment will be incomplete without considering these transmission routes. Dose\u2010response models can assess the infection risk of these exposure pathways provided that the intake dose of the pathogen via these transmission routes can be estimated. Droplet transmission occurs when pathogens are carried in relatively large expiratory droplets. Unlike small expiratory aerosols, which can remain airborne for a long time and disperse over long distances, these expiratory aerosols can only travel short distances before settling. Under the definitions of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (2003), disease transmission via expiratory aerosols with sizes greater than 5 \u03bcm are in the droplet mode and with sizes smaller than or equal to 5 \u03bcm are in the airborne mode. However, studies found that expiratory droplet nuclei with sizes up to about 20 \u03bcm may also travel long distances similar to these aerosols with sizes smaller than or equal to 5 \u03bcm, depending on the airflow pattern and ventilation strategy (Chao and Wan, 2006; Wan and Chao, 2007). Therefore, a more rigorous approach to perform the dose\u2010response infection risk assessment is not to distinguish into the airborne mode or the droplet mode, but directly split the exposure level into different aerodynamic size ranges for the infectious particles, such as Equation 18. Other dose\u2010response models described in this article can also assess the infection risk via droplet transmission when the aerodynamic size\u2010dependent factors are incorporated and an exposure assessment method that includes spatial variation of aerosol exposure levels is adopted.",

When infectious particles are deposited on solid surfaces, these surfaces will become fomites. People contacting these contaminated surfaces may then deliver the pathogen to their eyes or nasal mucous membranes and may become infected. The first study assessing the infection risk via indirect contact transmission was performed by Nicas and Sun (2006). A Markov chain model was used to estimate the intake dose of pathogens via indirect contact and also via other exposure pathways. When the intake dose is known, the infection risk can be assessed by the dose\u2010response model. Their model assumes a steady\u2010state pathogen load on contaminated surfaces, in which the rate of introducing the pathogens onto the surface equals the loss rate of the pathogen on the surface because of decay. This assumption is adequate for some pathogens with a fast or medium decay rate on the surface. Some pathogens will survive on solid surfaces for days or even weeks (Walther and Ewald, 2004) and at such a slow decay rate, the steady\u2010state pathogen load will take a long time to reach. In this case, the error associated with this assumption will be large, especially for a short and medium exposure time interval.

It assumes that the decay of the pathogen on the contaminated surface is insignificant during the exposure time interval. Therefore, the equation is suitable for the case when the pathogen has a slow decay rate on the contaminated surface. In contrast, Nicas and Sun\u2019s model should be used when the pathogens have a fast or medium decay rate on the contaminated surface. With pathogens that can survive on inanimate surfaces for days or even weeks, the contaminated surfaces can serve as reservoirs for the pathogens up to weeks without effective disinfection. These fomites can impose potential infection risk to susceptible people for a long period of time, even after the source of the infectious particles has been removed.

However, as discussed in Table 1, pathogens have heterogeneous infectivity in different regions of the respiratory tract. Using a summed intake dose from different exposure pathways in dose\u2010response assessment will only allow a single or a single set of fitting parameters that consider all the pathogens to have homogeneous infectivity. Essentially, pathogens encased in small aerosols will generally infect the lower respiratory tract, whereas pathogens encased in large aerosols will mainly infect the upper respiratory tract, and pathogens acquired via indirect contact will primarily infect the mucous membranes. Risk assessors should separate the intake dose for different exposure pathways and use different fitting parameters to obtain more realistic risk assessment results, unless the available infectious dose data are insufficient.

However, as the Wells\u2013Riley models rely on backward calculated infectivity and infectious source strength (the quanta generation rate), there is currently no method to estimate the infectious source strength from an outbreak other than the well\u2010mixed approach. When the infectious source strength term is backward calculated from an outbreak using the well\u2010mixed assumption, the influences of the geometry of the premises, the airflow pattern, and the location of the infectious source on the spatial distribution of the infectious particles are implicitly considered in that infectious source strength. Using this infectious source strength in the risk assessments, even if the risk assessor has used a model that can incorporate spatial variation in exposure levels, these influencing factors cannot be explicitly adjusted and will become errors. Therefore, the errors associated with the well\u2010mixed assumption still persist even though the risk assessor uses a modified Wells\u2013Riley model that can consider spatial effects in the assessment. Dose\u2010response models do not rely on backward calculation of infectivity and infectious source strength from outbreaks. Therefore, using the dose\u2010response models that can consider spatial effects in the assessment can avoid those errors.",

The randomness induced by air turbulence consists of two components: the randomness in the pathogen distribution in air and the randomness of respiratory deposition of the inhaled pathogen. The former component can be described by Poisson probability as shown in some of the current risk models. For the latter component, if the respiratory deposition fraction is multiplied to the inhaled dose, the deposited dose will be the expected value and this randomness is not fully adjusted. When a person inhales an amount of N* pathogens and the respiratory deposition fraction of the aerosols is \u03b2*, an amount of \u03b2*N* pathogens is most likely to be successfully deposited on his/her respiratory tract. However, it is also possible to have zero pathogen successfully deposited on his/her respiratory tract if the person has lottery\u2010winning good luck or having all N* pathogens successfully deposited on his/her respiratory tract if the person has very bad luck.

This may cause errors in risk assessment results. Quanta generation rates and the fitting parameters of dose\u2010response equation describe the infectivity of the pathogen. Pathogen\u2013host interaction is implicitly considered by these parameters. Although the pathogen\u2013host interaction has not been well\u2010understood and quantified, it is reasonable to assume that the interaction between a particular species of pathogen and a particular species of host is rather consistent in different scenarios, while the variation in the individual host\u2019s immune status is either reflected statistically in the formulation of the model or is implicitly considered in the infectivity terms. However, other influencing factors that are being implicitly considered by the quanta generation rate or by the fitting parameters may have greater variation across different cases. The backward calculated quanta generation rate also does not distinguish whether the infection cases are caused by airborne, droplet, or indirect contact transmission or by a combination of all three, but it assumes that all infection cases are caused by airborne infection. This may also induce implicit error in the backward calculated quanta generation rate. Spatial heterogeneity, pathogen survivability, deposition loss of infectious particles, and other influencing factors are also implicitly considered in the backward calculated quanta generation rate. These factors always vary from case to case. The calculated quanta generation rate value will inherit all these influencing factors in that particular outbreak case. With so many influencing factors implicitly considered by a single parameter, the case\u2010to\u2010case variations and hence the implicit errors would be huge. As reviewed in one study, the quanta generation rate of tuberculosis calculated from different outbreaks ranged from 1.25 to 30,840 quanta/h (Beggs et al., 2003). Other than the variation of infectious source strengths, this huge variation is also likely to be attributed by these implicit errors. In dose\u2010response models, as many of these influencing factors can be considered explicitly, there are fewer implicit errors in general.",

This hypothetical infectious dose unit offers convenience for risk assessment but provides less information regarding the outbreak, as it cannot distinguish the pathogen emission rate from the pathogen\u2019s infectivity. When the quanta generation rates of two diseases are compared, epidemiologists cannot ascertain whether the one with a greater quanta generation rate is more infective than the other or that the infector has shed more pathogens during the outbreak than the other one. Infectivity of different pathogens can be easily compared by the infectious dose unit, in which the quantity of the pathogens can be directly compared. Dose\u2010response model can also be used to calculate the infectious source strength of an outbreak. The infectious source strength can be expressed in terms of the quantity of the pathogen rather than a hypothetical unit. To demonstrate this idea, we selected an influenza outbreak during an air flight in Australia in 1999 (Marsden, 2003) as an example. As shown in Table 4, the calculated infectious source strength is 515 quanta/h or 2229.4 TCID50/h. The total amount of influenza virus shed into the air during the outbreak is estimated as 7431.5 TCID50.

Dose\u2010response models such as Equations 18, 21\u201323 also require a number of infectious dose values, for example, the infectious dose values of the pathogen suspended in aerosols of different sizes. Therefore, a rich infectious dose database is necessary. Infectious dose data are often obtained by experimental infections but, for many pathogens, only animal data are available. Although interspecies extrapolation can be used in adopting these data to humans, using extrapolated animal data may still not fully adjust the difference of pathogen\u2013host interactions between the two species. Risk assessors should be aware that the respiratory deposition of animals differs with that of humans (Asgharian et al., 1995) and this difference should also be considered when performing interspecies extrapolations.
