And influenzalike illness placed a substantial health and economic burden, the individual cost per episode of influenzalike illness represented approximately 20% of monthly per-capita income of residents [Guo et al., 2011] . Nevertheless, much less is known about the etiology of influenza-like illness in China. In the present study, a continuous surveillance of 16 respiratory viruses of patients with influenza-like illness was conducted in Nanjing, China from November 2010 to October 2011. Falchi et al. [2011] carried out a study over 5 weeks between January 25, 2010 and February 27, 2010 in France and found 58% samples of influenza-like illness patients positive for one or more respiratory viruses. Hasman et al. [2009] conducted a study during two successive winters, 1998-1999 and 1999-2000 in the USA, founding 68% of the samples positive for at least one virus. These two studies only collected respiratory specimens during winter. In contrast, the present study was conducted continuously from November 2010 through October 2011, including not only epidemic but also non-epidemic seasons of influenza-like illness. In this study, 50.6% (95% CI, 46.1-55.2%) of influenza-like illness patients were found positive for at least one respiratory virus. And the proportion was much higher in January (67.4%) than in June-August (32.6%), which was consistent with the findings of Brittain-Long et al. [2012] , indicating that respiratory viruses were more likely associated with influenza-like illness peak in winter rather than peak in summer. Influenza-like illness peak in summer may be due to other respiratory pathogens including bacteria, chlamydia, or mycoplasma. During non-epidemic seasons of influenza-like illness, the detected rates of respiratory viruses were not significantly lower than in influenza-like illness winter peak. However, the identification rates of influenza A and hCoV HKU1 were significantly lower than in the winter peak. It is reasonable to infer that influenza A and hCoV HKU1 may account for the influenza-like illness winter peak. In addition to the sampling periods, detection method, and case definition could also lead to the differences of identification rates among studies. Laguna-Torres et al. [2011] employed virus isolation instead of PCR to identify pathogens and Fig. 1 . Viral etiology of ILI patients and overall positive rates of respiratory viruses by ILI seasons. Rezza et al. [2006] included milder febrile cases into analyses. The positive rates of their findings, 24.7% and 43.9%, were both much lower than other studies.",

In France, the respiratory viruses detected most frequently were hMPV and RSV [Falchi et al., 2011] .

In Central American countries, the viruses found most commonly were influenza A, RSV, AdV, and PIV [Laguna-Torres et al., 2011] . In Italia and Belgium, the sequences were influenza, AdV, PIV ] and influenza, RV, RSV [Hombrouck et al., 2012] , respectively.

Influenza A was found most commonly during the influenza-like illness winter peak and rhinovirus was found most commonly during influenza-like illness summer peak. Sampling seasons, ages of patients and virus types for test may contribute to the differences [Alonso et al., 2012] . Such as, hCoV HKU1 was only tested in the present study. It was not recognized as the principal respiratory virus of influenza-like illness in other studies. Interestingly, RSV was seldom detected in this study. RSV is the most common cause of lower respiratory tract disease and the leading cause of hospital admission among young children worldwide [Ou et al., 2009; Ranmuthugala et al., 2011; Stockman et al., 2012] . When more children under the age of 5 and more patients required hospitalization were included into analyses, the identification rates of RSV increased significantly [Hasman et al., 2009; Falchi et al., 2011; Laguna-Torres et al., 2011] . In the present study on outpatients with influenzalike illness, RSV was common in age groups of 0-5 and 6-15 but was not detected in other age groups, which may be attributed to the developing immune state and vulnerability to infections [Raboni et al., 2011] .",

Although the present study covered not only the influenza-like illness epidemic season but also the nonepidemic season, the circulating pathogen profile can vary significantly from year to year for both influenza and other viruses. Surveillance over many years would give a better picture of this variation. Kruskal-Wallis test.",
