Healthcare workers are at especially high risk of contracting influenza. One study of healthcare workers with a low rate of influenza vaccination demonstrated that 23 % of healthcare workers had evidence of influenza infection during a single influenza season (Elder et al. 1996). Two features of influenza make its spread difficult to control in hospitals. First, people with influenza are infectious 1\u20134 days before the onset of symptoms. Thus, they can spread the virus when they are still feeling well and are unaware of their own infectious state. Second, only about 50 % of infected persons develop classic influenza symptoms (CDC 2002, 2003) Consequently, restricting healthcare workers with influenza-like symptoms from the workplace will not completely prevent transmission of influenza because healthcare workers with atypical symptoms could continue working and spreading the virus. Furthermore, studies show that healthcare workers are more likely than other workers to return to work early or to keep working when they have influenza-related symptoms (Weingarten et al. 1989).",

First, healthcare-associated infections affect about 2 million patients in US hospitals each year (Jarvis 1996). Second, there is a growing fear that hospitals could become a breeding ground for new strains of influenza such as the recent H1N1 influenza outbreak, the potential emergence of person-to-person transmission of avian flu, or other \u201cnew viruses.\u201d Much as SARS spread widely in hospitals to begin the SARS epidemic in Toronto (Chowell et al. 2004), person-to-person transmission of avian flu may start in hospitals as well, and, if a more lethal version of H1N1 were to develop, hospitals again could be a breeding ground for new infections. This last point is of particular salience. With the recent H1N1 outbreak and the subsequent work to develop a vaccine, controversies arose concerning which individuals to vaccinate first. Healthcare workers were high on the list. But, as we show below, not all healthcare workers are equal in terms of their importance in spreading infectious diseases. Thus, one primary focus of this paper is identifying the individual hospital workers who are most important to vaccinate should a similar outbreak occur again.",

            "text": "There is a growing literature in economics on the vaccination choices of individuals and of the externalities associated with vaccinations. But scant attention is paid to the network effects determined by heterogeneous contacts that we focus on in this paper. For example, Francis (2004) solves for the optimal tax/subsidy policy for influenza in an SIR model with a constant contact rate and random mixing among the population. Geoffard and Philipson (1997) examine how the individual incentives for vaccination decrease as disease incidence decreases and thereby argue that relying exclusively on private markets is unlikely to lead to disease eradication. Boulier et al. (2007), the most similar paper to ours, investigate the magnitude of the externality associated with a vaccination as a function of the number of vaccinations in the population, the transmission rate of the disease, and the efficacy of the vaccination. They find non-montonic relationships between each of these items and the magnitude of the vaccine externality. More specifically, the externality and the number of infections prevented per vaccination initially increases before eventually decreasing. However, like Francis, they do not consider the case of heterogenous contact number or heterogenous sorting among the population. Finally, much of the recent literature on the economics of infectious disease is summarized in Philipson et al. (2000).",

            "text": "The social planner\u2019s vaccination problem is more difficult than the individual vaccination problem. Essentially, the social planner\u2019s problem is to vaccinate agent j if the cost of the vaccination is less than the expected dis-utility of the increase in infections created by agent j if agent j is infected weighted by the probability that agent j is infected. We define the term \u201cmarginal infections\u201d of agent j to be the additional infections that occur if j is infected that would not occur if j was not infected. Note that this is not simply the number of infections that agent j creates. As an example, agent k maybe infected by agent j. But, if k would have been infected by another agent had she not been infected by j then this would not be a \u201cmarginal infection\u201d of agent j. k will be infected regardless of the vaccination choice of agent j. Along these lines of thinking, measuring marginal infections is a difficult problem for epidemiologists for at least three reasons:As mentioned earlier, many infectious disease transmissions are not observable. Thus it is not easily known how many infections a given agent causes.Even if transmissions are observable, the marginal infections created by agent j are not simply the number of other agents that j infects. This is because some agents that j infects may get infected by agents other than j even if j does not infect them herself. Further one needs to know how many additional agents are infected by those that j infects and any additional infections created by these agents and so forth. Thus one needs to know information on the dynamics of the entire epidemic to measure the true marginal infections of a given agent.The marginal value of vaccinating an agent depends on the behavior and vaccination choices of other agents. It eventually must be decreasing in the number of other vaccinations that are performed. In the extreme, if there are enough vaccinations in the population to produce herd immunity the marginal value of vaccinating an additional agent only involves the probability that the agent is infected from outside the agent population. In effect, the only value is preventing a single agent from infection because she will not, on average, infect anyone else.Because of these difficulties we use a simulation approach to help us measure the average and marginal effects of individuals belonging to different worker groups in our hospital contact data. With simulations one can monitor the various infections that occur and also perform controlled experiments to sort out the effects of various groups on potential hospital epidemics.",

            "text": "Before moving to the computational model, we mention two limitations of our data set. Human contact networks frequently have a small number of individuals with a much larger than average number of contacts, perhaps differing by orders of magnitude. These individuals are often called hubs. These hubs have the potential to significantly influence disease transmission because they are highly likely to be infected, and if so, to pass on infections to a large number of individuals. Because our sample includes approximately 2.5 % of the hospital worker population, we may be missing hubs in our sample if they exist in this setting. However, we note two things in relation to this: First, the relatively homogeneous workday responsibilities of workers within categories, likely limit the variation of contacts within a category. For instance two physicians or two floor nurses are likely constrained to see a relatively similar number of patients each day. This is unlike many other social network data sets, (such as general friendship or online networks) where there are not these work responsibility constraints on individual contacts. Thus the possibility of hubs with orders of magnitude differences in numbers of contacts is more limited in our data context. Second, our data set is more comprehensive than any other within hospital contact data set in existence in terms of the worker categories included. Recall from earlier in the paper that the Ueno and Masuda data set only includes physicians, nurses, and patients in a hospital much smaller than is studied here. Our results below suggest that many of the most important groups in the hospital are not included in their study. Thus, at a minimum, our study highlights the importance of funding for studies that aim to collect even more comprehensive data sets that include individuals with non-patient care responsibilities and more comprehensively cover a larger share of hospital workers.",

As the transmission rate increases, a larger fraction of individuals are infected throughout the population. Thus there are more opportunities for each individual to be infected if she has not already been infected. Vaccinating a given person in the population will only prevent one of these multiple channels for infection. So, as the infection rate increases, the effectiveness of a vaccination becomes more uniform across the groups. This has direct policy applications. An infectious disease that is highly contagious could best be met with a uniform vaccination strategy since each individual in the population will create a similar level of infections on average. But an infectious disease with a low level of contagiousness could most effectively be met with a targeted vaccination campaign (Bansal and Pourbohloul 2007).",

We present results in Figs. 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7 for five interesting worker group categories for the same two transmission rates discussed above. Unit Clerks, Social Workers and Phlebotomists are chosen because of their large number of secondary infections generated. We also choose Floor Nurses and Staff Physicians because of interest in the effect of worker groups with primary patient care responsibilities. In Fig. 2 we plot the marginal infections prevented per vaccination as a function of the number of vaccinations performed for the five groups. Recall that the number of marginal infections is the additional number of infections that an agent generates if the agent becomes infected. In Fig. 3 we plot the probability of infection for the five groups. And, in Fig. 4 we plot the product of marginal infections and probability of infection which yields the total number of infections prevented per vaccination. These figures all consider a transmission rate of 0.0030. Figures 5, 6, and 7 plot the same relationships for a transmission rate of 0.0035.\n\n\n\n\n\n",

(Here the number of vaccinations performed is small relative to the entire population as we are only vaccinating some members of one of the 15 groups. So, even if we vaccinate an entire group, this is a small number relative to the entire population.) Here, we see two interesting outcomes. First, we see that marginal infections for both Unit Clerks and Floor Nurses increase as more vaccinations are performed. For these two groups, each additional vaccination prevents a larger and larger number of infections. This is particularly extreme for a transmission rate of 0.0030 and the case of Unit Clerks where a small number of vaccinations results in about 6 marginal infections prevented and the last vaccination of a Unit Clerk results in about 14 marginal infections prevented. We see the same increasing relationship for a transmission rate of 0.0035 but to a smaller extent. (Recall that the effect of a vaccination becomes more homogeneous as the transmission rate increases.) We see a similar increasing relationship for Floor Nurses as well. However the increase is less pronounced. The other three groups have relatively flat plots of marginal infections.

The first is that the effect of vaccinating Unit Clerks in our data is most important both from a marginal and an average perspective regardless of how many vaccinations have been performed. Particularly, the marginal effect of vaccinating a Unit Clerk increases at a greater rate than the probability of infection for a non-vaccinated unit clerk falls. Thus, it is always more beneficial to vaccinate one more unit clerk as opposed to a worker from another group (assuming transmission rates are equal). The second is that there is little difference between the average and the marginal effect of a vaccination for the other groups considered here. This second point can be interpreted as good news from a policy making perspective in the sense that the optimal allocation of vaccinations does not switch as more of a group is vaccinated. In other words it is not the case that Group A is the optimal group to target up to some vaccination percentage, after which Group B should be targeted. Switching such as that would indicate a much more complicated solution to the optimal vaccine allocation problem. Here, because there is little difference between the marginal and the average effect of a vaccination for most groups, one can pragmatically target the groups with the largest average effect of a vaccination.",

Total contacts and contacts with patients could be directly correlated with the likelihood of being infected and with passing on infections. The percentage of contacts within one\u2019s own group can indicate how varied one\u2019s network is and how widespread one\u2019s connections are.

This network variable is likely to be an indicator of importance for disease transmission in the network. If a hospital worker group has a high average betweenness value, then the nodes in this group are potentially important in passing infections on to other nodes as it plays a crucial role in location along many of the shortest paths between nodes in a network.

The only measure that consistently aligns well is the betweenness measure. For a moment concentrate on the values in the first three columns. Each of these three plausibly important characteristics fail to display a meaningful relationship with the average or marginal infections generated. If we concentrate on the top three most important groups, some have relatively large numbers of contacts (unit clerks), although not the largest, while others have contacts significantly below the average (phlebotomists). Some have large numbers of patient contacts (phlebotomists) while others have some of the smallest number of patient contacts (unit clerks and social workers). One interesting thing that appears in the table is that phlebotomists have almost all of their contacts with patients and other phlebotomists. Thus the network position of phlebotomists, is in some sense, very similar to that of patients. Overall, what these observations imply is that there is not likely to be a simple relationship (or a small set of simple relationships) indicating which individuals are most important to vaccinate by looking at easily observed worker interaction patterns. Instead the relationship depends on the intricate and complex web of relationships that make up the entire contact network of the hospital.

If we remove agents with high betweenness measures (by vaccinations) from the disease propagation network, we disrupt the flow of an epidemic.

Here, we consider two robustness checks to the results presented above. First, we discuss a comparison of the magnitude of the above described network effects and the effect of transmission rates on marginal infections for an interesting example group, staff physicians. Second, we do an additional set of experiments using an additional data set that includes observed repeated contacts. We perform these robustness checks for two main reasons: First, because of the job responsibilities of different worker groups, the different worker groups may have different transmission rates, durations of contacts, or frequency of contacts creating another source of heterogeneity in infections. As a few examples, a staff physician may be more likely to transmit an infection over the course of a patient exam that includes a series of physical contacts, compared to a nurse who has a brief arm\u2019s-length conversation with a hospital transporter. A floor nurse may have multiple interactions with the same patient during the course of the day.9\n",

Because of the heterogeneous contacts throughout the hospital, some workers are more important to the spread of an infectious disease than others. Thus if hospitals and other public health organizations want to efficiently distribute vaccines they need to target specific worker groups, perhaps by allocating subsidies, on the basis of discrepancies in probability of infection and marginal infections generated.
