ACE2 can also cleave angiotensin I to angiotensin 1-9, which can then be further converted to angiotensin 1-7 by ACE. ACE2, angiotensin 1-7 and its MAS receptor constitute the vasoprotective arm of the RAAS. Excessive activation of the classical RAAS leads to arterial hypertension, accompanied by immuno-metabolic disorders and obligatory culminates in end-organ damage in the absence of adequate therapy (for recent reviews see [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] ). The RAAS and in particular ACE2 appear to be attractive targets to fight COVID-19. Therein, the role of ACE inhibitors and AT1R blockers is currently highly controversial. On the one hand, these drugs could increase ACE2 expression and potentiate SARS-CoV-2 cell entry [24] . On the other hand, increased ACE2 production would result in a higher circulating level of soluble ACE2, which neutralizes SARS-CoV-2 [25] . Yet, the precise role of the available RAAStargeting drugs in COVID-19 disease waits to be unraveled.",

A number of cytokines have been measured in serum of COVID-19 patients [46] . Initial plasma IL-1B, IL-1RA, IL-7, IL-8, IL-9, IL-10, bFGF, GCSF, GMCSF, IFN-\u03b3, IP-10, MCP1, MIP-1A, MIP-1B, PDGF, TNF-\u03b1, and VEGF concentrations were higher in patients than in healthy adults, whereas plasma levels of IL-5, IL-12p70, IL-15, Eotaxin, and RANTES were similar in patients and controls. IFN-\u03b1 and \u03b2 were not measured. These results suggest that an overproduction of cytokines might be responsible for the damage of the lungs in COVID-19 patients.

This explains how these viruses employ mechanisms to escape, dampen, or block the antiviral interferon response in human cells. Furthermore, the ability of certain pathogens to escape from host immune response has been reported to be accomplished by host protein mimicry [49] . Thereby, no or a limited amount of antibodies are created, which also explains why certain vaccines may be ineffective. On the other hand, the similarity between pathogenic antigens and host proteins may lead to immune cross reactivity, whereby the reaction of the immune system toward the pathogenic antigens may harm similar human proteins, eventually causing autoimmune disease [50] .",

This suggests that corticosteroids may be used to treat COVID-19 patients thereby helping the immune system to fight the infection. Indeed, corticosteroid supplements have improved the clinical conditions of many SARS patients [52] . On the other hand, a number of studies reported corticosteroid-treatment of SARS patients to be rather harmful (reviewed in [53] ). For example, early steroid treatment has been associated with delayed viral clearance [54] , and it has been found that patients with psychosis received higher cumulative doses of steroids than patients without psychosis [55] . In a study with 138 COVID-19 patients, where 45% received methylprednisolone, no effective outcome was observed after the treatment [56] .

Chronic restraint stress in rats also alters the RAAS by reduction of plasma aldosterone levels despite significant increases in plasma renin activity. Public anxiety of being infected is high; health care workers, who have higher vulnerability of acquiring and spreading the virus, are in particular those most likely to be distressed.

Loneliness, defined as the discrepancy between a person's desired and actual social relationships, is an emotional response to social isolation, while social isolation is an objective measure of the lack of social connections or interactions [61, 62] . Social isolation and loneliness are common sources of chronic stress in adults. They are correlated to a higher risk of mortality and cardiovascular disease, which have been associated with activation of the HPA axis and the sympathetic nervous system. Repeated and chronic social stress leads to glucocorticoid release, enhanced myelopoiesis, upregulated proinflammatory gene expression, and oxidative stress [63] . Furthermore, psychological stress due to social isolation is known to cause abnormal feeding behaviors. In addition to psychological reactions, such as depression and anxiety, stress triggers various physiological reactions including an increase in respiration and blood pressure. An activated stress axis also influences the body's metabolism [64, 65] . In particular, changes in feeding behavior are a well-known phenotype related to stress [66] .",

One year after recovery, HPA dysfunction had largely recovered [68] . However, even though physical conditions continuously improved, mental health did not. Psychiatric morbidities and chronic fatigue persisted and continued to be clinically significant up to at least 4 years after the SARS outbreak [69] . This has also been shown by Lee et al., where health care workers during the outbreak showed an elevated stress level when compared to non-health care workers. One year later, stress levels of survivors remained persistently elevated and higher than in control subjects. Specifically, health care workers showed significantly higher stress levels and had even higher depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic symptom scores than other survivors [70, 71] .",

Our work on the adrenal suggests that stem cell populations in both the adrenal cortex and medulla are highly susceptible to stress [77, 78] . Under normal conditions, they seem to be quiescent or only slowly contribute to organ homeostasis. However, in stressful situations they enter the cell cycle leading to differentiation into mature lineages. Furthermore, we have shown that differentiation of adrenocortical stem cells is faster in females than in males [79] .",

Furthermore, sex differences in response to stress should be considered.
