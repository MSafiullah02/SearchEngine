During its evolution, humanity has often believed that one can create \u2018artificial\u2019 models that are not influenced by the surrounding Nature. As time passed by, researchers realized that miming Nature might lead to better models. Thus their interest in this area increased, and problem solving reached another level. The new perspective in seeking inspiration from Nature, both from living systems and from natural sciences, such as physics or chemistry for instance, gave birth to the term \u201ccomputational intelligence\u201d. Having as starting point biology, researchers designed and developed artificial neural networks, evolutionary algorithms, swarm intelligence, fuzzy logic, etc. From physics or chemistry researchers modeled gravitational optimization, harmony search, chemical reaction optimization, gases Brownian motion optimization, etc.",

Some say that an IS is a machine that has the capacity to gather and analyze data and communicate with other systems, that can learn from experience, and adapt according to current data, etc. These features can be summarized into: ISs are technologically advanced machines that perceive and respond to the environment.",

            "text": "To have a more comprehensive understanding of this concept, let us to go back to the year 1950, and see what A.M. Turing said about the \u2018thinking machines\u2019. In Turing [1], Turing had to answer the following question \u201cCan machines think?\u201d Analyzing different aspects related to this \u2018simple\u2019 question, he concluded that the problem should be reformulated as follows: \u201cThe new form of the problem can be described in terms of a game which we call the \u2018imitation game\u2019. It is played with three people, a man (A), a woman (B), and an interrogator (C) who may be of either sex. The interrogator stays in a room apart from the other two. The object of the game for the interrogator is to determine which of the other two is the man and which is the woman. He knows them by labels X and Y, and at the end of the game he says either \u201cX is A and Y is B\u201d or \u201cX is B and Y is A\u201d. The interrogator is allowed to put questions to A and B\u201d, with the answers, ideally, typewritten; the question is related to sex \u201cC: Will X please tell me the length of his or her hair?\u201d In this context, Turing brought up the issue: \u201cWe now ask the question, \u2018What will happen when a machine takes the part of A in this game?\u2019 Will the interrogator decide wrongly as often when the game is played like this as he does when the game is played between a man and a woman? These questions replace our original, \u2018Can machines think?\u2019. Summarizing the above, if we assume that we have a person, a machine, and an interrogator, then the object of the \u2018imitation game\u2019 for the interrogator is to determine which of the other two is the person, and which is the machine. However, the story does not end here, because \u201cThe question we put \u2026 will not be quite definite until we have specified what we mean by the word \u2018machine.\u2019\u201d Turing concludes that \u201cWe are the more ready to do so in view of the fact that the present interest in \u2018thinking machines\u2019 has been aroused by a particular kind of machine, usually called an \u2018electronic computer\u2019 or \u2018digital computer\u2019. Following this suggestion we only permit digital computers to take part in our game.\u201d Starting from this presentation, we come to the phrase \u201cThe Turing test\u201d, as a way of answering the question whether machines can think or not. An interesting fact, according to the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy [2], is the idea that the Turing\u2019s test has deeper roots in history. Thus, it is suggested that the Turing test is foreshadowed in R. Descartes\u2019 \u201cDiscourse on the Method of Rightly Conducting one\u2019s Reason and Seeking Truth in the Sciences\u201d, or, shortly \u201cDiscourse on the Method (1637)\u201d. Finally, let us mention that there are currently opinions that say the classical Turing test is out of date and that we need to find other ways to measure the machines\u2019 \u201cintelligence\u201d [3\u20136]. In this context, different approaches have emerged to assess the Turing test capacity to detect the presence of consciousness. We can mention the Chinese room argument [Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy], which is an experiment of John Searle [7] designed to show that the Turing test is insufficient to detect the presence of consciousness, even if the \u2018room\u2019 can behave or function as a conscious mind would (Fig. 1.1).\n\n",

If we consider that a computer is deemed to have Artificial Intelligence (AI) capabilities, if it can mimic human responses under specific conditions, everything is clear, but (AI) is more than a question of imitation, it is a matter of understanding. There are many ways to describe the concept of AI. According to Encyclopedia Britannica [Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica], AI means \u201cthe ability of a digital computer or computer-controlled robot to perform tasks commonly associated with intelligent beings\u201d, having thus the capabilities of \u201cdeveloping systems endowed with the intellectual processes characteristic of humans, such as the ability to reason, discover meaning, generalize, or learn from past experience.\u201d It is noteworthy that Turing has provided the earliest significant work regarding AI, the first manifesto, all modern computers being considered as \u201cTuring machines\u201d. In an unpublished 1948 report, entitled \u201cIntelligent Machinery\u201d, he introduced many of the central concepts of AI. More details about A. Turing and his substantial contribution to AI, including the report mentioned above, are to be found in Copeland [8].",

Moreover, these devices are, generally, connected to other devices via wireless networks. Most of them are now parts of the so-called \u201csmart home\u201d. In this context, the IoT describes how the Internet will link intelligent devices, to allow these endpoints to generate and share data. Examples of intelligent devices are smartphones, phablets, tablets, smart watches, wearable computers, smart home devices (e.g., smart thermostat, smart lighting bulbs, smart security cameras, smart switch, smart speakers, smart AC control, etc.), intelligent vehicle technologies, etc. (Figs. 1.3, 1.4, 1.5).\n\n\n",

            "text": "It is interesting to go through a brief history of AI/IS to see the impressive rhythm of development of this important field of Computer Science in just 60 years from its beginning [101]:One considers that AI started at \u201cDartmouth Artificial Intelligence\u201d conference, held at Dartmouth College, Hanover, New Hampshire, USA, in 1956 (https://www.livinginternet.com/i/ii_ai.htm\u2014accessed November 24, 2017). In this regard, let us mention the \u201cDartmouth AI Project Proposal\u201d, by J. McCarthy (Dartmouth College), M. L. Minsky (Harvard University), N. Rochester (IBM Corporation), and C.E. Shannon (Bell Telephone Laboratories)\u2014August 31, 1955, states that \u201cWe propose that a 2 month, 10 man study of artificial intelligence be carried out during the summer of 1956 at Dartmouth College in Hanover, New Hampshire\u201d. It is noteworthy that the term \u201cArtificial Intelligence\u201d was first coined by John McCarthy.(http://www-formal.stanford.edu/jmc/history/dartmouth/dartmouth.html accessed November 24, 2017).A milestone for the use of AI in real-world applications was the idea of creating a \u2018perfect machine translator\u2019, funded by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA). Unfortunately, two reports (Automatic Language Processing Advisory Committee (ALPAC) report\u20141966, and Lighthill report\u20141973) \u201cconcluded negatively about the possibility of creating a machine that could learn or be considered intelligent\u201d.Another landmark in AI history was the occurrence of the \u201cexpert systems\u201d in the eighties, giving a \u2018breather\u2019 to the field by UK and Japan funding. It is noteworthy that expert systems first emerged in the early 1950s when the Rand-Carnegie team of Newell, Shaw, and Simon developed a General Problem Solver that dealt with theorems proof, geometric problems and chess playing.Another revival of the AI field began in 1993 with the MIT \u201cCog\u201d project, aiming to build a humanoid robot, and with the Dynamic Analysis and Replanning Tool (DART), aiming to optimize and schedule transportation of supplies or personnel and solve other logistical problems, used by U.S. military.We now reach February 10, 1996, when \u201cDeep Blue\u201d, the chess-playing super computer developed by IBM, won its first game against a world champion, Garry Kasparov. Overall, Kasparov defeated Deep Blue by a score of 4\u20132. However, in 1997, after a heavily upgrade, Deep Blue defeated Kasparov in a rematch, the first defeat of a reigning world chess champion by a computer under tournament conditions (score 3.5/2.5). It is noteworthy that C.E. Shannon was the first to think about developing a chess-playing program.Then, until 2012, the AI development has materialized mainly through academic research, with no significant practical impact. The milestone was December 4, 2012, when a convolutional neural network was presented at the Neural Information Processing Systems\u2014NIPS 2012 Conference (Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems 25). Since then, the AI development trend has been steadily increasing.\n",

In Bellman [124], has first introduced the term of \u201ccurse of dimensionality\u201d, referring as a phenomenon which often occurs when applying ML algorithms to high-dimensional data. In this situation, \u201cthe number of samples needed to estimate an arbitrary function with a given level of accuracy grows exponentially with respect to the number of input variables (i.e., dimensionality) of the function\u201d [125]. In the ML practice, there is a maximum number of features in the database, above which the algorithm\u2019s performance will decrease rather than increase. To avoid such a situation, one can use the dimensionality reduction technique, obtaining a reduced amount of time and memory required by data processing, better visualization, elimination of irrelevant features and possible noise reduction. As techniques for dimensionality reduction, we can mention typical multivariate exploratory techniques such as factor analysis, principal components analysis, multidimensional scaling, cluster analysis, canonical correlation, etc. There are usually two different approaches for dimensionality reduction: (a) feature selection (FS), and (b) feature extraction (FE). FS uses different methods for selecting a subset of the existing features, the most significant ones for the proposed purpose (e.g., classification, regression). In this way, the selected subset of variables from the input can efficiently describe the input data. As a result, the effects from noise or irrelevant variables are reduced, and this approach provides prediction at least as good, but with a much lower computing effort. Instead, FE performs a projection of the existing features to a lower dimensional space, altering thus the original representation of the data. FE creates new variables as combinations of others to reduce the dimensionality of the selected features. The literature on FS and FE techniques is very vast, covering ML and pattern recognition algorithms. Since each underlying algorithm behaves differently for different data, a comparison between FS/FE algorithms can only be done using a single dataset. Of the well-known FS techniques, we recall (a) filter methods, (b) wrapper methods, (c) embedded methods, (d) ensemble FS, etc. Regarding FE, we can mention (a) principal component analysis, (b) linear discriminant analysis, (c) factor analysis, (d) multidimensional scaling, (e) correspondence analysis, etc.\n",
