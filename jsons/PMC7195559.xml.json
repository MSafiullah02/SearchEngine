For example, triaging a patient who requires urgent in-person evaluation but is at high-risk of COVID-19 transmission or illness illustrates the current moral dilemma facing dermatologists. Values also conflict when the very measures that protect staff and others from infection threaten employee salary and practice solvency.",

Similarly, some dermatologists in the United States have temporarily closed their practices to reduce transmission risk. From a public health standpoint, the decision to temporarily close a practice is reasonable. It reduces infection risk not only for patients, staff, and providers but also for others in contact with them. However, closing practices prevents providers from delivering needed care and has financial consequences for the practice and staff.",

Keeping patients with dermatologic conditions out of overwhelmed emergency rooms and urgent cares, where the risk of contracting or spreading COVID-19 may be high, is critical.6 Ultimately, dermatologists will need to determine what warrants an urgent office visit during the pandemic. Dermatologists should weigh the potential harm of delaying an in-person visit against the potential harm of COVID-19 infection to the patient, practice, and community. We argue that only those cases in which the delay of in-person care exceeds the risk of COVID-19 infection should be considered for evaluation in the office during the pandemic.",
