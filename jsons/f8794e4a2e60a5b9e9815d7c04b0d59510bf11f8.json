While we endure months of disruption to daily life prompted by the ongoing pandemic, serologic testing for antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 has now come to the limelight. SARS-CoV-2 is a highly contagious and acute severe respiratory pathogen that has produced an enormous strain on healthcare resources. In the United States and many other countries, specific social behavior restrictions have been enacted to moderate the impact of rapid propagation of this contagion (ie, \"flatten the curve\"). Scientific experts, governmental officials, and other professionals have publicly advocated for SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing to identify individuals who have developed immunity and therefore could potentially re-enter the workplace safely despite ongoing high prevalence of the virus. A test for detecting \"immune\" individuals who will not be re-infected and who will not infect others is an appealing concept, but is it realistic?",

            "text": "Numerous antibody tests have recently become available. Serologic tests for antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 are typically based on lateral flow immunochromatography or enzymelinked immunosorbent assays (ELISA). Currently available tests predominantly target antibodies to 1 of 2 main surface proteins of the novel coronavirus -the nucleocapsid protein (N) and the spike protein (S). Several assays focus on the S1 subunit of the spike protein, which is somewhat specific to each coronavirus strain. 1, 2 The S1 subunits host the binding domain for the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor, which is thought to be the mechanism by which SARS-CoV gains entry into cells. 1 Because the S1 subunit is highly immunogenic and its affinity for the ACE2 receptor appears to correlate with infectivity, 1 it has been the target for SARS-CoV-2 serologic assays with reportedly high sensitivity and specificity. 2, 3 Clinical implementation urgently requires validation of these new assays. Since real-life performance data are scarce, the COVID-19 pandemic has been marked by an inspiring level of inter-laboratory collaboration. At Yale-New Haven Hospital, we are particularly grateful for invaluable discussions and sharing of data with Johns Hopkins, Massachusetts General Hospital, Mount Sinai, NYU-Langone, Cornell/Columbia, ARUP, Mayo Clinic, and many others. Scientific journals have contributed via the rapid dissemination of curated studies, and preprint sites offer additional information that can be scrutinized in a shorter time frame, prior to dedicated reviewer analysis. The accumulation and exchange of valuable laboratory evidence has increased our understanding of the serologic testing landscape in a short period of time. As a result, we now know that individuals with symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection will generally not have detectable antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 within the first 7 days of the onset of symptoms. 3, 4 The majority of hospitalized SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals with confirmed viral RNA will have detectable IgG antibodies 14 days, and more certainly 28 days, after the onset of symptoms with assay sensitivity and specificity in the high 90 percents. 5 Total antibody concentration appears to rise to detectable levels first; IgM and IgA both rise 1-2 days earlier than IgG 3 (unpublished observations). Preliminary data suggests older individuals produce more robust antibody responses. Assays differ in overall performance, but several methods being validated by large laboratories appear comparable. One might therefore ask: \"What, exactly, is the problem?\"",

Fortunately, reputable commercial entities with experienced scientists, sophisticated equipment, and good manufacturing practices have begun to release serologic assays under FDA guidance.

We have heard the argument that any testing is better than none, providing a path to restoring normalcy, and the lack of which has high ongoing societal costs. As laboratory professionals, we can only respond that for anti-SARS-CoV-2 serology: (A) bad assays will always be counterproductive; (B) good assays have not been proven in the proposed test population; and (C) more experience is needed to help us properly interpret the serologic test results.",

One such clinical scenario where SARS-CoV-2 serologic assays may be particularly useful is when a positive serology is accompanied by repeatedly negative nucleic acid testing in the setting of a highly suggestive clinical presentation; serology may provide the basis for specific therapies for COVID-19 infection.
