The family Caliciviridae is divided into at least four genera: Vesivirus, Lagovirus, Norovirus (NoV), and Sapovirus (SaV) with a new proposed genus, NB-like (Smiley et al., 2002), based on genomic organization and genetic analysis (Green et al., 2000). Caliciviruses are associated with a wide range of economically important diseases in animals, including humans (Geissler et al., 1997, Green et al., 2001, Ohlinger et al., 1990).",

Several of porcine SaVs and NoVs are closely related to human SaVs and NoVs genetically, which has raised public health concerns of potential cross-species transmission and animal reservoirs for SaVs and NoVs related to human SaVs and NoVs (Guo et al., 1999, Wang et al., 2005a, Wang et al., 2005b). However, the occurrence of porcine enteric caliciviruses has been reported in only a few countries including the US (both SaVs and NoVs), Japan (only NoVs), Venezuela (both SaVs and NoVs), Netherlands (both SaVs and NoVs), and the United Kingdom (Bridger, 1990, Mart\u00ednez et al., 2006, Sugieda et al., 1998; van Der Poel et al., 2000, Wang et al., 2005a, Wang et al., 2005b).",

            "text": "Human enteric caliciviruses cannot be cultured in vitro. Therefore, molecular studies have relied on the availability of stool samples collected during outbreaks or from human volunteer studies. Molecular analysis of human SaVs has demonstrated significant genetic diversity among the viruses within this genus: these have been genetically divided into four genogroups (GI, \u2212II, \u2212IV, and \u2212V) and at least eight genetic clusters or genotypes (GI/1 to 3, GII/1 to \u22123, GIV/1, and GV/1) (Farkas et al., 2004, Schuffenecker et al., 2001). Porcine SaVs circulating in the US have been genetically analyzed using the major strains classified as SaV/GIII (Guo et al., 1999, Wang et al., 2005a), though one strain represents a potential new genogroup of porcine SaVs (Wang et al., 2005a). Since the discovery of porcine SaVs in the 1980s (Saif et al., 1980), only a few additional studies of their genetic diversity have been reported (Farkas et al., 2004, Guo et al., 1999, Schuffenecker et al., 2001, Wang et al., 2005a). In South Korea, we demonstrated that porcine SaVs cause diarrhea outbreaks (Kim et al., 2006). However, little is known about the genetic diversity of the porcine SaVs circulating in South Korea. Therefore, the aim of this study was to obtain information on the genetic heterogeneity of porcine SaVs circulating in South Korea.",

The ages of the pigs tested from all provinces ranged from 3 to 70 days. The fecal samples were examined for common bacterial enteric pathogens including Salmonella spp. using specific agar media. Brachyspira hyodysenteriae detection was performed by PCR using the specific primers (La et al., 2003). For the extraction of viral RNA, fecal suspensions of each sample were prepared immediately by diluting the feces 1:10 in 0.01 M phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.2. The suspensions were then vortexed for 30 sec, centrifuged (1200 \u00d7 \ng for 20 min), and the supernatants were collected and stored at \u221280 \u00b0C for further testing.",

            "text": "Like other RNA viruses, human SaVs show broad genomic sequence diversity between circulating strains, which is partly due to the poor template fidelity of their RNA polymerases (Green et al., 2001). The genetic divergence of porcine SaVs in different countries is unavailable because the sequence data of only a few porcine SaVs (mainly from the US) is available. In this study, genetically variable porcine SaVs from swine were detected in South Korea and their genetic relationship with human and other porcine SaVs as well as to the other three genera (Lagovirus, Vesivirus, and Norovirus) in the Caliciviridae were examined. Analyses of the partial capsid genes of the 12 porcine SaVs showed that they shared a lower aa and nt sequence identity with the human SaVs, human and animal NoVs, FCV and RHDV, which is consistent with a previous report (Wang et al., 2005a). The aa identity within the GIII porcine SaVs ranged from 67.7 to 99.1%, in which the genetic divergence was observed not only among Korean porcine SaVs but also between the Korean and American porcine SaVs. This suggests there is genetic variability in the porcine SaVs belonging to genogroup III. In addition, all the Korean and most US porcine SaVs sequenced belonged to the SaV/GIII genotype. Therefore, these results, along with others (Farkas et al., 2004, Guo et al., 1999, Schuffenecker et al., 2001, Wang et al., 2005a), indicated that SaV/GIII is the dominant genogroup of porcine SaVs.",

Although pairwise and phylogenetic analyses allowed the human SaVs within all genogroups to be divided into at least nine genotypes, the porcine SaVs could not be classified into genotypes because the sequences of only a few porcine SaVs have been reported. Interestingly, this study identified one strain (Po/SaV/JN-MA113/05/Korea) forming a second new porcine SaV/GIII genotype, which is tentatively called GIII/2. This strain had a 0.236\u20130.405 inter-cluster distance with the other strains in the same genogroup, which is comparable to the distances between the established GI and GII SaVs. Whether or not the two genotypes among the GIII porcine SaVs identified in this study represent sero- or antigen-types cannot be predicted based on their sequence alone. Therefore, more detailed antigenic analysis of porcine SaVs will be needed to understand their diversity and evolution as well as to develop classification schemes that can reduce the level of confusion and assist international molecular epidemiological studies.",

This conservation is likely to facilitate a recombination event when the nucleic acid sequences of the parental strains come into physical contact with infected cells, e.g., during copy choice recombination (Worobey and Holmes, 1999). Therefore, genetic recombination may be a common mechanism for generating diversity among the genotypes or genogroups. Recombinant viruses within SaVs and NoVs have been reported in humans, cattle and pigs (Han et al., 2004, Jiang et al., 1999a, Katayama et al., 2004, Wang et al., 2005a). In this study, it was found that the Po/SaV/JN-YG69/04/Korea was a potential recombinant strain between the Po/SaV/JB-JE91/05/Korea-like strain (RdRp region) and the Po/SaV/JB-IS123/05/Korea-like strain (capsid, after RdRp) of the same genotype. In contrast, the Po/SaV/JB-IS123/05/Korea was a potential recombinant strain between the Po/SaV/Cowden/80/US-like strain (RdRp region) and the Po/SaV/JN-YG69/04/Korea-like strain (capsid, after RdRp) of the same genotype. In South Korea, post-weaning piglets introduced into each farm are frequently sourced from different farms in different provinces, which suggest that the Po/SaV/JN-YG69/04/Korea strain has different geographic origins. Because South Korea imports live pigs from the US, American porcine SaV strains may be the parent strains of the recombinant viruses such as the Po/SaV/JB-IS123/05/Korea strain. Therefore, the capsid gene diversity of the porcine SaVs detected in these farms is most likely to be a reflection of this diverse geographic sourcing.",

However, the precise epidemiology of porcine SaV infections in the other countries is not known. We previously reported the prevalence of porcine SaV infections in South Korea during the 2001\u20132002, in which 8.8% of diarrheic fecal samples tested positive by nested PCR (Kim et al., 2006). However, the more recent status of porcine SaV infections is unknown. This paper presents a large-scale epidemiological study of the prevalence of porcine SaV infections in diarrheic piglets in South Korea during 2004\u20132005. Although five sets of primer pairs were used to detect those porcine SaV strains, it is likely that some strains escaped detection. At this time, no primer pair or combination of primers appears suitable for the universal detection of porcine SaVs. However, among those primer pairs, the PECnF/nR primer pair used for nested PCR showed high sensitivity in detecting porcine SaVs. When fecal samples were determined to be positive based on at least one positive fecal sample detected by each primer pair, porcine SaVs were detected in 29.1% fecal samples obtained from six provinces. Overall, the high prevalence and widespread geographical distribution of porcine SaVs suggest that these viruses are widespread in piglets with diarrhea in South Korea. In addition, it is not known why there was a higher prevalence of porcine SaV infections during 2004\u20132005 compared with during 2001\u20132002. One possible explanation is that the SaVs infections might have been spread out to many more farms after 2001\u20132002.",

However, it is possible that other porcine enteric pathogens play a role in the clinical and pathological presentation of this disease. This is because many other enteric viruses have been found to be associated with diarrhea in piglets and cause lesions of villous atrophy [transmissible gastroenteritis virus, porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), groups A, B, C porcine rotaviruses (PRV A\u2013C), etc.]. In this study, 12.2% diarrheic fecal samples tested positive for porcine SaVs alone, while 16.9% of diarrheic fecal samples testing positive for porcine SaVs and other pathogens including the PRV A\u2013C, PEDV, etc. This suggests that a number of enteric pathogens, either singly or in combination, can influence the clinical course of porcine SaV infections.",
