The program was performed once per day, 5 days per week, with each daily session lasting 10 minutes. Participants were taught the techniques by watching MBT experts on an online video and then following the MBT protocol for each 10-minute program. Participants in the MBT program were provided with a checklist on which to record their daily practice, which they submitted after the 8-week training. The program was based on mind-body training, a kind of movement-based meditation designed to facilitate the relaxation of the mind and the release of negative emotions through natural rhythmic movements and a focus on bodily sensations [22] . The program consists of 10 phases: brain relaxation exercise 1, brain relaxation exercise 2, brain rejuvenation exercise, relaxation breathing, chest breathing, meditation with self-watching, energy-focused meditation, brain-refreshing meditation, meditation for balanced brainwaves, and meditation for emotional release. The first phase, brain relaxation exercise 1, was designed to enhance flexibility and blood circulation through stretching the muscles of the body. It consists of postures and motions that help relax the neck, shoulders, and lower back which can easily become tight when workers are exposed to conditions associated with burnout. The second phase, brain relaxation exercise 2, was also designed to enhance flexibility and blood circulation through stretching the muscles of the body. Additionally, this exercise includes movements that pull the tips of the toes toward the body and then push them outward, and bringing the hands to the armpits and dropping them down while relaxing the tension in the shoulders. The third phase, the brain rejuvenation exercise, rejuvenates the relaxed muscles and increases the energy level of the body. It consists of exercises such as body tapping, toe-tip tapping, and clapping hands. In the fourth phase, relaxation breathing is used to deepen and slow the cycle of breathing which becomes short and shallow due to stress. It consists of taking one breath in six segments and breathing out quickly. Both this breathing exercise and its reverse are repeated 3-4 times. In the fifth phase, chest breathing is performed to reduce emotional stress by integrating breathing and consciousness. When breathing in, focus should be on the chest; when breathing out, focus should be on the abdomen. As this exercise is repeated 4-5 times, breathing can become more comfortable. It is easier to focus on and follow this exercise if the right hand is placed on the chest and the left hand is placed on the lower abdomen. The sixth phase, meditation with self-watching, is performed to relax muscular tension by focusing on the body. Participants focus on each part of the body to increase relaxation as the instructor names it, moving from the top of the head to the tips of the toes. This exercise is repeated 2-3 times. The seventh phase, energy-focused meditation, involves feeling the energy of the body and establishing peace of mind. It consists of the motions needed to move the hands 5 cm above the chest, move them apart, and move them closer while feeling the sensation of one's palms. The eighth phase, brain-refreshing meditation, is employed to clear the stress-related fogginess of the brain. As participants assume a meditation posture, moving the hands apart and closer, they imagine and say the following: \"Pure breath is coming into my head, my brain is expanding.\" They then breathe out with a \"Whoo\" sound and imagine, \"Foggy gas is coming out from my brain through my mouth.\" It is important that a positive brain state is imagined. The ninth phase, meditation for balanced brainwaves, is aimed at converting the beta waves associated with stress to the alpha waves associated with relaxation and concentration. The first step involves breathing in, holding the breath, and relaxing the neck as the breath is released. The second step involves moving or shaking the head from side to side in a comfortable and relaxing manner. The third step consists of quietly stopping all motion and relaxing the mind. The tenth phase, meditation for emotional release, was designed to erase and reduce the influence of the images of stressful events or people stored in the brain. First, participants recall the image of a negative experience and notice its position and size. They use their imagination to make it as small as a pea and blow it away while saying, \"Whoo.\" This is repeated several times.

The reduction in stress associated with MBT can be understood in terms of the decrease in tension, frustration, anger, depression, and somatization during the 8 weeks. As the program consists of training for both mind and body, the stress-related physical and emotional symptoms, such as tension, frustration, anger, depression, and somatization, of participants seemed to improve compared with those of the control subjects. These effects of MBT seem to be related to improvements in psychological capabilities. Given that subjects in both groups were chosen based on exclusion criteria stipulating an absence of a mental disorder (SCL-90-R), their psychological levels of functioning were within the normal range. Nevertheless, we possess the capacity to improve our psychological wellbeing, and the MBT program examined in this study seemed to enhance the psychological capabilities and well-being of the participants. Moreover, we found individual differences in the effects of MBT. For example, the stress scores of 24 subjects (57.1%) in the MBT group decreased, and the emotional intelligence scores of 26 subjects (61.9%) in this group increased. Additionally, although the stress scores of the MBT group decreased by an average of four points after 8 weeks, the stress scores of 24 subjects (57.1%) in this group decreased by an the average of 17 points. Likewise, the emotional intelligence scores of 26 subjects (61.9%) in the MBT group increased by an average of 12 points, compared with an average increase of four points in all MBT subjects. Thus, despite individual differences, the effects of the MBT program examined in this study were positive. The causes of such individual differences regarding the effects of MBT should be explored in future research.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "We should examine why the control group showed significantly increased stress after 4 and 8 weeks. Although there were no occupation-related differences between the control and experimental groups, we can speculate that workplace stress increased during this time as a result of the outbreak of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS). Indeed, most subjects in both groups were nurses involved in emotional labor and caring staff, who worked in the hospital. As a result of the MERS emergency, the number of patients visiting doctors decreased during the period of baseline testing. About 1 month later, at the time of the second testing, the MERS emergency had dissipated, and more patients visited the hospital. Indeed, we can speculate that most members of both groups were very busy at work more than 1 month before, but our data reflected no significant differences in occupational stress (e.g., job demands) between the control and experimental groups. Thus, we can infer that a small increase in job-demand stress may have contributed to an increase in the perceived stress of some subjects in the control group ( Fig 4D) . On the other hand, given that, unlike the control group, the MBT group showed no association between job-demand stress and perceived stress (Fig 4C) , it is possible that some subjects in the MBT group improved their stress resistance, which is ability to withstand stress without causing maladjustments or disorders, compared with their baseline results ( Fig 4A) . These findings are meaningful in that the effects of MBT on stress reduction, along with the other various psychological improvements, were observed despite the fact that participants remained in stressful work situations that showed no significant reduction in total occupational stress over the 8-week period. In other words, subjects who participated in the MBT program appeared to become more resistant to the psychological stress induced by occupational pressures such as job demands than they were before taking part in the program, as demonstrated by the results of the correlation analysis (Fig 4) . We can infer from these results that, prior to the 8-week program, the MBT group was vulnerable to stress based on job demands; however, after the 8-week program, the stress level experienced by these participants was not affected by increases in the stress related to job demands. In contrast, at 8 weeks, the control group, who did not receive the intervention, experienced an increase in stress in accordance with increased job demands.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1121, "end": 1128, "text": "Fig 4D)", "ref_id": "FIGREF3"}, {"start": 1271, "end": 1279, "text": "(Fig 4C)", "ref_id": "FIGREF3"}, {"start": 1488, "end": 1495, "text": "Fig 4A)", "ref_id": "FIGREF3"}, {"start": 2096, "end": 2103, "text": "(Fig 4)", "ref_id": "FIGREF3"}], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "As emotions are related to respiration [43] , deep breathing during MBT may affect not only physical but also emotional relaxation. Additionally, meditation for the purpose of emotional release may be beneficial for those engaged in emotional labor. Emotional intelligence, including emotional perception and expression, empathy, and emotion regulation, may be important for those engaged in emotional labor as they are required to display certain emotions in the presence of customers or others [9] . As integrative mind and body training improves attention and self-regulation through the interaction between the central (brain) and the autonomic (body) nervous systems [26] , the reduction in stress and the increase in emotional intelligence associated with MBT may contribute to the ability of those involved in professions that require high levels of emotional labor to self-regulate. A crucial factor for the stress reduction observed among the MBT subjects may be the increase in emotional intelligence that resulted from participating in the 8-week program; this is suggested by the inverse correlation between emotional intelligence scores and self-reported stress (Fig 5) . We can infer that the increase in emotional intelligence and the reduction in stress may closely and synergistically interact and that such dynamics may be induced or increased by MBT. Thus, this result offers important clues about the hidden mechanisms underpinning the ability of MBT to improve psychological well-being. Previous studies reporting an inverse relationship between stress and emotional intelligence [14, 17] further support our results. Given that emotional intelligence acts as a moderator between stress levels and psychological health [18] and increased emotional competence contributes to the use of adaptive coping strategies when dealing with stress [19] , the enhanced emotional intelligence observed among subjects taking part in the MBT program may have led to improved problem-solving and social-support coping as well as a reduction in stress. Although this 8-week online program did not include educational lecture programs specifically targeting coping strategies, subjects who participated in the program showed an increase in the frequency with which they used adaptive coping strategies. The healthy brain has a considerable capacity for resilience based on its ability to respond to interventions designed to open \"windows of plasticity\" and redirect its function toward better health [44] . Thus, given that meditation may potentially strengthen neuronal circuits and enhance cognitive reserve capacity [45] , the MBT program may contribute to the brain capacity and plasticity of healthy subjects, leading to more frequent use of adaptive coping strategies and reductions in stress.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 39, "end": 43, "text": "[43]", "ref_id": "BIBREF43"}, {"start": 496, "end": 499, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 672, "end": 676, "text": "[26]", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 1601, "end": 1605, "text": "[14,", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 1606, "end": 1609, "text": "17]", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 1740, "end": 1744, "text": "[18]", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 1858, "end": 1862, "text": "[19]", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 2504, "end": 2508, "text": "[44]", "ref_id": "BIBREF44"}, {"start": 2623, "end": 2627, "text": "[45]", "ref_id": "BIBREF45"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1175, "end": 1182, "text": "(Fig 5)", "ref_id": "FIGREF4"}], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Moreover, adaptive coping strategies such as problem-solving and social-support strategies along with increased emotional intelligence appeared to increase stress resistance in our subjects.
