The overarching rationale is that glucocorticoids could mitigate exaggerated and potentially deleterious aspects of the host\u2019s inflammatory response. Corticosteroids have typically been prescribed to target the acute phase of these conditions. However, the results of these studies have been mixed. For example, a meta-analysis of more than 30 trials in septic shock suggested that glucocorticoids reduce the duration of septic shock and may reduce mortality [19]. However, a meta-analysis of trials in pneumonia [20], the most common cause of sepsis, reported significant heterogeneity in terms of both patient characteristics and type of glucocorticoids used and found an uncertain effect on mortality but consistent reduction in duration of mechanical ventilation, length of hospitalization, and time to clinical stability. Consequently, the efficacy of glucocorticoids remains unclear, treatment guidelines can be controversial [21\u201325], and clinicians continue to struggle with decisions regarding optimal approaches. Recently, a precision medicine approach showed that the acute use of methylprednisolone decreased treatment failure among patients with CAP and an exaggerated immune response as evidenced by high circulating C-reactive protein levels [26].",

The underlying mechanism seems to be dependent upon corticosteroid\u2019s ability to impair arachidonic release from platelet membrane via PLA2 down-regulation and ensuing reduced TxB2 biosynthesis [15].
