            "text": "CCoV is generally recognised as an aetiological agent of self-limiting infections of the intestinal epithelium, which can lead to the onset of clinical signs typical of the gastroenteric involvement, such as inappetance, diarrhoea and vomiting [6], [7]. Recently, a highly virulent variant of CCoV type II (strain CB/05) was reported that caused a systemic disease, followed by fatalities in pups [8]. The virus was isolated from the internal organs (lungs, spleen, liver and kidney), that had severe gross lesions. CCoV type II RNA was also detected in the brain, thus accounting for the neurological signs observed in the affected pups. Sequence analysis of the 3\u2032 genome end of the pantropic CCoV strain, including ORFs 2 (S gene), 3a, 3b, 3c, 4 (E gene), 5 (M gene), 6 (N gene), 7a and 7b, showed that strain CB/05 has a high degree of aa identity to the cognate ORFs of CCoV type II, although the S protein displayed the highest identity to FCoV type II strain 79\u20131683. A genetic marker was identified in the CB/05 genome, consisting of a 38-nt deletion in ORF3b which is responsible for a predicted truncated nonstructural protein 3b [9]. Experimental infection of seronegative pups with strain CB/05 reproduced the disease with occurrence of severe clinical signs, including pyrexia, anorexia, depression, vomiting, diarrhoea and leukopenia [10]. A different clinical course was observed according to the age of the infected pups. The older dogs (6 months of age) slowly recovered from the disease, whereas two of three 2.5-month-old dogs were sacrificed due to the severity of the CB/05-induced disease [10].",

RNA extracts were subjected to a real-time RT-PCR assay for detection and quantitation of CCoV RNA [11]. Reverse transcription was carried out using GeneAmp\u00ae RNA PCR (Applied Biosystems, Applera Italia, Monza, Italy), following the manufacturer's recommendations. Real-time PCR was performed in a 50 \u03bcl-reaction mixture containing 25 \u03bcl of IQ\u2122 Supermix (Bio-Rad Laboratories Srl, Milan, Italy), 600 nM of primers CCoV-For (TTGATCGTTTTTATAACGGTTCTACAA) and CCoV-Rev (AATGGGCCATAATAGCCACATAAT), 200 nM of probe CCoV-Pb (FAM-ACCTCAATTTAGCTGGTTCGTGTATGGCATT-TAMRA) and 20 \u03bcl of c-DNA. The thermal cycle protocol used was the following: activation of iTaq DNA polymerase at 95 \u00b0C for 10 min and 45 cycles consisting of denaturation at 95 \u00b0C for 15 s and primer annealing-extension at 60 \u00b0C for 1 min.",

Although the dogs used in this study had a strong humoral immunity to enteric CCoV at the time of challenge, the experimental infection with strain CB/05 was successful in all pups irrespective of the viral dose administered. It is noteworthy that exposure to even low amounts of virus would have similar infectivity on seropositive animals, since dogs inoculated with different viral loads (4 \u00d7 105 or 4 \u00d7 103\n TCID50/ml of viral suspension) displayed the same duration of viral shedding and there was little difference in the viral titres in the faeces.",

This was attributed mainly to the cross-protection induced by antibodies against enteric CCoV. However, the lymphotropism of the strain CB/05 was clearly demonstrated by the occurrence of lymphopenia (albeit moderate) in several infected pups of groups A and B. We hypothesise that the high antibody titres to enteric CCoV could have induced only partial protection against strain CB/05, which infected the dogs, causing enteritis and lymphopenia, but which failed to spread systemically, with the exception of lymphoid tissues where traces of the viral RNA were detected after necropsy. However, despite the occurrence of moderate lymphopenia and the presence of the virus in lymphoid tissues, the viral RNA was not detected in the blood at any time. This finding may be due to very low levels of viremia that were not detected by the molecular assays used. A similar pattern has been described for feline infectious peritonitis virus, that may be undetected in the blood especially during periods of apparent recovery after acute infection [16].",

Only an experimental modified-live virus vaccine administered oronasally has been able to induce complete protection from disease as well as from infection. Considering that the immunity induced by natural infection with enteric CCoV is not able to protect pups from challenge with strain CB/05, the efficacy of currently used vaccines prepared with enteric CCoV strains may be poorer against pantropic CB/05-like viruses. According to this scenario, dogs vaccinated with enteric CCoV may acquire subclinical infections with CB/05-like strains resulting in lymphopenia which may represent a predisposing factor for opportunistic pathogens and for a more severe disease induced by \u201ctrue\u201d pathogens (canine parvovirus, canine distemper virus, etc.).",
