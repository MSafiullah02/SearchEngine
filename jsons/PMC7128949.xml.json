The time spent between specimen collection and performance of microbiologic studies or previous antibiotics use may be a part of explanation. There are also other reasons such as challenges with bacterial growth on media, antibiotics decreases yield and etc. S. pneumoniae urinary antigen test (Binax NOW\u00ae\nS. pneumoniae assay) is known as a useful technique because of rapidity (\u223c15min), simplicity, reasonable specificity in adults, and the ability to detect pneumococcal pneumonia even after antibiotic administration and enhancing the diagnosis of pneumococcal pneumonia [4]. Even though urinary antigen test (UAT) is not possible in children due to a high rate of nasopharyngeal carriage of bacteria, studies in adults have shown better results, with a reported sensitivity of 74%\u201375% and specificity of 94%\u201397% [5], [6], [7], [8]. Although previous studies have supported the usefulness of UAT, there has been little published research about the effect of patient- and disease-specific factors (such as patient age, comorbidity, and pneumonia severity etc.) on the diagnostic utility of UAT.",

We evaluated the baseline characteristics of included cases and examined the temporal change in UAT results, which might reflect the alteration of S. pneumoniae serotype distribution in CAP patients due to vaccine pressure following the introduction of the PCV13 into pediatric use. For this analysis, we defined three time periods relative to the introduction of PCV13: the period 2007\u20132009 was defined as the pre-PCV13 period, 2010\u20132011 as the period immediately after pediatric PCV13 use began (transition period), and 2012\u20132013 as the period 2 years after pediatric PCV13 use began (post-PCV13 period).

Additionally, we analyzed the temporal change of causative serotype by collecting only available isolates as listed in Table 3, the proportion of PCV13 serotypes tended to decrease in the post-PCV 13 period, 2 years after the introduction of PCV13, compared with pre-PCV13 period (P = 0.067), although the difference was not significant. After introduction of PCV13, serotype 6A, 19F and 23F decreased, while serotype 6C rather increased. Serotype 3 and 19A was frequently isolated across the periods (Table 3). The positive rate of UAT varied diversely among cases with different pneumococcal serotypes (Fig. 3\n). The UAT positive rates by serotype were as follows: serotype 3, 50%; serotype 9V/9A, 83.3%; serotype 11A/11E, 59.1%; serotype 14, 36.3%; serotype 19A, 50%; serotype 19F, 46%; serotype 20, 75%; serotype 23F, 37.5%; serotype 4, 40%; and non-typeable, 55.3%. The positive rate of UAT was 49.2% (65 of 132 cases) in PCV13 serotypes and 53.5% (53 of 99 cases) in non-PCV13 serotypes, and these two groups were not significantly different in their UAT positive rates (P = 0.518).",

The similar temporal trend in pediatric Invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) following the introduction of PCV13 was found in many industrialized countries [18], [19], although no efficacy data is available yet in Korea. Based on such findings, we presumed that the decrease of the proportion of pneumococcal pneumonia might be due to the herd effect from pediatric vaccination. During the studied periods, the pneumococcal vaccine rate in adults was estimated to be 9.7%, and PCV13 coverage rate was less than 1% [20]; however, the pediatric vaccination rate of PCV13 was 70.4%, and the rate was even higher when incomplete vaccinations were included (Korean Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, unpublished data). Several studies have shown a significant change in the serotypes of S. pneumoniae with nasopharyngeal carriage within 2 years after introduction of PCV13 [21], [22], even in areas with less vaccination coverage (69.3% vaccinated with at least 1 dose of PCV13) [21]. The herd effect of pediatric pneumococcal vaccination on reducing adult disease has been demonstrated in multiple clinical settings [23], [24].",

Considering that the positive rate of UAT increased significantly after 2012, and PCV13 serotypes showed a decreasing tendency, we presumed that the positive rate of UAT might have been altered in relation to the increase in non-typeable serotypes after the introduction of PCV13 (Table 3). The herd effect of the PCV7 even exceeded the direct protective benefit for immunized children [25], and this effect was especially significant after 2 years from vaccine introduction [26], [27]. According to a previous study, which showed an altered frequency of patient serotypes after PCV7 introduction [27], the change became remarkable only 2 years after PCV7 introduction; an increase of non-typeable serotypes occurred first, and then an increase of non-vaccine types arose later. The temporal change in the UAT positive rate, which increased significantly in the post-PCV13 era, 2 years after the introduction of PCV13, may be related to increased non-typeable pneumococci, decreased capsule production and a capsular serotype shift. Indeed, PCV13 serotypes rather decreased, while the proportion of non-typeable serotypes was significantly increased since 2012: 18.6% (29 of 156 cases) in 2007\u20132009 versus 8.8% (12 of 137 cases) in 2010\u20132011 versus 32.3% (10 of 31 cases) in 2012\u20132013 (P = 0.002).

Since different pneumococcal serotypes have varying tendencies toward nasopharyngeal colonization or invasiveness [10], [11], the hypothesis was formed that urinary antigen detection would vary by serotype. Previous studies have suggested that capsular polysaccharide serotypes with less metabolic cost (i.e. having fewer carbon atoms per saccharide unit) will be more heavily encapsulated. Such lower metabolic cost capsular polysaccharide serotypes include 3, 6A, 6B, 14, 19A, 19F, and 23F [28]. Theoretically, heavily encapsulated serotypes with a low metabolic cost might be able to decrease C-polysaccharide exposure, thereby raising suspicion about serotype-specific differences in urinary antigen detection. Contrary to our initial hypothesis, serotype 3 showed a urinary antigen detection rate of 50%, similar to the overall positive rate. The other pneumococcal serotypes also did not show any clear trend toward a urinary antigen detection rate differing from the overall positive rate, as shown in Fig. 3. The positive rates of UAT were variable by pneumococcal serotypes. The results suggest that other factors besides capsule thickness, such as the amount of C-polysaccharide amount, nasopharyngeal carriage rate, or vaccine pressure may influence the urinary antigen detection rate.",

            "text": "In this study, the positive rate of UAT was rather low (56.4%) compared to previous reports [5], [6], [7], [8]. Because the sensitivity of UAT has been reported slightly lower (52\u201378%) for non-bacteremic pneumococcal pneumonia than for bacteremic cases [9], [29], the lower detection rate of urinary antigen in this study than in previous studies may be partly explained by the effect of the fewer bacteremic episodes (4.4%) in this study, compared with previous studies [8]. Although a number of studies have demonstrated the utility of UAT, there has been little information about the effects of either host or microbiologic factors on the utility of UAT, particularly in terms of serotypes. This study, which analyzed the positive rate of UAT according to several demographic or clinical factors, demonstrated that a higher CRP level was significantly related with a higher positive rate of UAT. Cases showing lobar pneumonia were also associated with a higher UAT positive rate. The C-polysaccharide of S. pneumoniae is a major ligand for CRP, and binding of CRP to its ligands activates the classical complement pathway and stimulates phagocytosis [30]. In addition, pneumococcal C-polysaccharide is known to trigger inflammatory cytokine release, including interleukin (IL)-1, IL-6, IL-8, and tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1, which in turn induce the production of CRP [31]. Considering these data together, we thought it likely that a localized bacterial burden and host reactions, such as the acute phase response, may influence the urinary antigen detection. Indeed, several previous studies showed that bacteremia was associated with a higher detection of urinary antigen [8], [32], [33]. Here, the positive rate of UAT showed only a non-significant tendency to increase with bacteremia, perhaps reflecting the relatively small number of bacteremic cases included. In the present study, the UAT results were not influenced by previous antibiotics use, which is similar to the findings of previous studies [32], [34].",
