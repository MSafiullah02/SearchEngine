            "text": "The pathogen that causes COVID-19 is a nCoV that was first identified in the late January 2020, named SARS-CoV-2 (also known as 2019-nCoV). [2] [3] [4] SARS-CoV-2 is a novel member of CoVs, which are a large group of highly diverse, enveloped, positive-sense, and single-stranded RNA viruses. 5 Recent research reported that SARS-CoV-2 likely originated in bats, based on the similarity of its genetic sequence to that of other CoVs. 14 The intermediate animal host of SARS-CoV-2 between a probable bat reservoir and humans is still unknown. 15 Although this nCoV has genetic features that are compatible with the family of CoV, nevertheless it has distinct gene sequences that are significantly different from previously sequenced CoVs (Table 1 ). The analysis of samples from seven SARS-CoV-2 infected patients suggested that SARS-CoV-2 shares 79.5% sequence identity to SARS-CoV. 3 Simplot analysis showed that SARS-CoV-2 share 96.2% overall genome sequence identity to RaTG13, which is a short RdRp region from a bat CoV. 3 Phylogenetic analysis revealed that SARS-CoV-2 falls into the subgenus Sarbecovirus of the genus Betacoronavirus and is distinct from SARS-CoV. 2, 4 The envelope spike (S) protein is important for CoV. 19 The S protein mediates receptor binding and membrane fusion and is crucial for determining host tropism and transmission capacity. 17, 20, 21 Generally, the S protein is functionally divided into the S1 domain, responsible for receptor binding, and S2 domain, responsible for cell membrane fusion. 22 Structure analysis suggested that receptorbinding domain was composed of a core and an external subdomain. 19 Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) was known as cell receptor for SARS-CoV. 16, 23, 24 Similar to SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 also use ACE2 as an entry receptor in the ACE2-expressing cells, 3 indicating SARS-CoV-2 may share the same life cycle with SARS-CoV ( Figure 1 ).",

The radiologic manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients are diverse and progressing rapidly. 35-38 Two-third of patients had at least two affected lobes, nearly half of patients had five affected lobes. 37,38 The most common manifestations are patchy ground-glass opacities (GGO) and patchy consolidation which were mainly distributed in the middle and outer zone of the lung 37,38 (Figure 2).

In a case reported by Xu et al, 39 a 50-year-old man died 14 days after admission due to respiratory failure and cardiac arrest. 39 The primary finding of biopsy at autopsy was bilateral diffuse alveolar damage with cellular fibromyxoid exudates and interstitial mononuclear inflammatory infiltrates dominated by lymphocytes. Multinucleated syncytial cells with atypical enlarged pneumocytes characterized by large nuclei, amphophilic granular cytoplasm, and prominent nucleoli were identified in the intraalveolar spaces, showing viral cytopathic-like changes. No obvious intranuclear or intracytoplasmic viral inclusions were identified. These pathological features show great similarities to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infection.[40][41][42] In addition, liver and heart were studied. There is moderate microvascular steatosis and mild lobular and portal activity in the liver tissue and a few interstitial mononuclear inflammatory infiltrates in the heart tissue.6 | DIAGNOSISAlthough a good contact history, systemic symptoms, and radiographic changes of pneumonia make the diagnosis likely, the laboratory diagnosis is more reliable. Real time-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)is routinely used to detect causative viruses from respiratory secretions.43,44 During COVID-19 transmission events, RT-PCR has served as the primary clinical laboratory diagnostic test.25,26,30,33 Success of these tests are very important to understand the viral kinetics and tissue tropism found in COVID-19 cases.

These findings indicated that chest CT is a sensitive modality to detect SARS-CoV-2 infection. During the COVID-19 epidemic in China, 10 567 patients were diagnosed as clinical diagnosed cases. This designation is being used in Hubei province, where is the worst affected area in China. In these cases, no RT-PCR test was performed but diagnosis was made based on typical symptoms, exposure history, and chest CT manifestations consistent with COVID-19 pneumonia. Under this criteria, 10 567 cases were diagnosed and isolated. This strategy quarantined a large number of suspected people and protected the healthy people to the most extent. On the basis of experiences above, we strongly recommend that the criteria of clinical diagnosed cases based on the symptoms, exposure history, and typical manifestations on chest CT imaging should be used in COVID-19 affected areas that are in shortage of RT-PCR testing kits to control the COVID-19 epidemic.7 | TREATMENTUntil the diagnosis is confirmed, SARS-CoV-2 infected patients are treated in single rooms.25,30 As SARS-CoV-2 is an emerging virus, an effective antiviral treatment has not been identified. The main treatment of COVID-19 is symptomatic treatment. The antiviral drugs, including oseltamivir, ribavirin, ganciclovir, lopinavir, and ritonavir have been used in attempts to reduce viral load and to prevent the likelihood of respiratory complications in several studies.25,26,30,33,34 Remdesivir was reported in the treatment of a patient with COVID-19 in the United States and got an effective result.47 However, the efficacy of these antiviral drugs for COVID-19 need to be verified by randomized-controlled clinical trials.",

The best strategy to deal with SARS-CoV-2 epidemic includes controlling the sources of infection, protecting the susceptible people, and cutting off the transmission. The infected patients should be identified early by rapid and robust detection technologies, provided with optimized treatment in isolation timely. The close contact people should be quarantined with follow-up.

The number of laboratory-confirmed cases and deaths continues to rise. The current reported mortality for COVID-19 is approximately 3.41% compared to 10% for SARS and 35% for MERS.[10][11][12]53 The mortality rate was higher than 3.41% in Iran and France, lower in Italy, Japan, Republic of Korea, and United States(Figure 3). Considering the quick spread of COVID-19, it is still too early to assess the mortality. All countries in the world should respond to the epidemic effectively. Approximately, 20% to 25% SARS-CoV-2-infected patients developed acute respiratory distress syndrome and required ICU care.30,33,34 Current evidence indicated that older age and comorbidity may be risk factors for poor outcome.30 9 | SUMMARY AND OUTLOOKThis review summarizes the current findings of SARS-CoV-2 along with the treatment for this severe CoV infection. The most common symptoms were addressed. Due to the only biopsy report, the pathological findings associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection have been limited. Autopsy is warranted and valuable for future research.",
