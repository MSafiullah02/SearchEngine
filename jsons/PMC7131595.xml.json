Early studies demonstrated much greater sensitivity than viral culture with a clinically actionable time to results. PCR has, therefore, essentially replaced viral culture for acute clinical diagnosis. PCR has an unclear relationship to acute and convalescent serology, a prior diagnostic standard that was not clinically useful except for retrospective diagnosis. PCR detects presence of viral genomic material at the time of specimen acquisition. This usually represents acute infection, although prolonged shedding of viral genomic material after an acute infection can occur, especially in immunocompromised patients.",

The initial driving force for multiplex panels was the 2007 to 2008 seasonal influenza outbreak. During that year, 2 strains of influenza A were circulating: an H1 strain that was resistant to oseltamivir and an H3 strain that remained sensitive.1 At that time, differentiation between influenza A and B, and between the 2 strains of influenza A, became critical in order to discontinue dual antiviral therapy. In the subsequent year, the pandemic strain of influenza A(H1N1) virus added an additional target for multiplex RVP assays.",

Panels became progressively more extensive, including addition of newly discovered human respiratory viral pathogens such as the coronaviruses responsible for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and human metapneumovirus (HMPV). Initially perceived as simply a positive alternative when more significant pathogens were not detected, the frequent association of rhinovirus with respiratory tract disease2 led to its routine inclusion in RVP panels. Increasingly, subspecies of viruses other than influenza A were added. This was made dramatically clear with the recent epidemic of enterovirus (EV)-D683 which was detected as human rhinovirus in some multiplex assays and not in others. The EV species seem to have distinct trophism with C and D, mainly causing respiratory tract disease. Finally, PCR for bacterial species difficult to grow, such as Mycoplasma spp and Chlamydophila spp, and in the differential of respiratory tract infections, such as Bordetella pertussis, were added for convenience and increased diagnostic yield.

In contrast, detection of any common respiratory virus in asymptomatic adults was only 2.1%.4 In adults, even rhinovirus is highly associated with pneumonia with an odds ratio of greater than 13.

A long duration or interval since onset of URT symptoms followed by new or changed symptoms consistent with LRT or systemic infection suggests a pulmonary infiltrate in a patient with a positive NP or OP swab is more likely bacterial superinfection than primary viral pneumonia. In this case, the positive NP or OP RVP likely represents persistent shedding after an antecedent viral URI. Conversely, a negative RVP in this situation may result in seroconversion, leading to the discordant results between serology and RVPs seen in epidemiologic studies. Persistent or worsening URI symptoms suggest that a positive NP or OP RVP may be the cause of tracheobronchitis or pneumonia.",

For COPD exacerbations, anticholinergics are now standard therapies, although significantly less so for asthma. Therefore, a positive RVP may suggest the need to add anticholinergics that the patient was not previously taking. More importantly, a positive RVP may generate less concern about prolonged exacerbation because certain viruses are associated with prolonged bronchospasm, including rhinovirus, influenza, parainfluenza, and RSV. In this situation, avoidance of escalation in corticosteroid dose or duration may result from knowledge of the viral trigger. No prospective randomized trial has addressed this issue.",
