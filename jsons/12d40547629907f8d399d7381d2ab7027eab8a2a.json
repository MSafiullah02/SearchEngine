            "text": "The outbreak of the current 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV, now named SARS-CoV-2) infection has become a worldwide health threat. Currently, more information is needed so as to further understand the transmission and clinical characteristics of 2019-nCoV infection and the infection control procedures required. Recently, the role of the eye in transmitting 2019-nCoV has been intensively discussed. Previous investigations of other highly infectious human CoVs, that is, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), may provide useful information. In this review, we describe the genomics and morphology of human CoVs, the epidemiology, systemic and ophthalmic manifestations, and mechanisms of human CoV infection, and recommendations for infection control procedures. The role of the eye in the transmission of 2019-nCoV is discussed in detail. Although the conjunctiva is directly exposed to extraocular pathogens, and the mucosa of the ocular surface and upper respiratory tract are connected by the nasolacrimal duct and share the same entry receptors for some respiratory viruses, the eye is rarely involved in human CoV infection, conjunctivitis is quite rare in patients with 2019-nCoV infection, and the CoV RNA positive rate by RT-PCR test in tears and conjunctival secretions from patients with 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV infection is also extremely low. This suggests that the eye is neither a preferred organ of human CoV infection nor a preferred gateway of entry for human CoVs for infecting the respiratory tract. However, pathogens that the ocular surface is exposed to might be transported to nasal and nasopharyngeal mucosa by constant tear rinsing through the lacrimal duct system and then cause respiratory tract infection. Considering that close doctor-patient contact is quite common in ophthalmic practice and is apt to transmit human CoVs by droplets and fomites, strict hand hygiene and proper personal protection are highly recommended for health care workers to avoid hospital-related viral transmission during ophthalmic practice.",

Since first being identified in the 1960s, Human CoVs were considered relatively benign and usually caused mild upper respiratory tract infections (the common cold) until the emergence of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in 2002 and, later, the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in 2012 (4) . The latter two CoVs can result in severe lower respiratory tract infection, rapidly proceeding to pneumonia, and have caused thousands of cases of infection and hundreds of deaths in about 30 countries, respectively (2, 4) . In December 2019, another outbreak of highly infectious pneumonia caused by a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV, now named as SARS-CoV-2) emerged in Wuhan, China, and soon became a major global health threat (2, 3) .",

Human CoVs mostly spread through respiratory droplets expelled by infected individuals and direct contact with viruscontaminated fomites (4) . Anatomically, the conjunctiva of the eye is easily exposed to infectious droplets and fomites during close contact with infected individuals and contaminated hands. Some respiratory viruses such as human adenovirus (species D) and avian influenza virus (H7) frequently cause highly infectious conjunctivitis or keratoconjunctivitis. Hence, conjunctiva is postulated to be an important portal of entry for respiratory viruses, while tear and conjunctival secretions may contain virus and spread viral infection (4, 5) .",

Three recently identified human CoVs, that is, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and 2019-nCoV, have been recognized as zoonotic viruses, which transmit between animals and human. Recent studies revealed that SARS-CoV was transmitted from civet cats to humans, MERS-CoV from dromedary camel, and 2019-nCoV (probably) from pangolin (1, 2, (6) (7) (8) (9) . Recent investigations indicated that bats were most probably the natural reservoir of SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and 2019-nCoV (1, 6, (9) (10) (11) . Genome sequence analysis revealed that 2019-nCoV was distinct from SARS-CoV (about 79% identity) and MERS-CoV (about 50% identity) yet more closely related to SARS-like-CoVs (about 88% identity) in bats (10, 11) .",

            "text": "On January 22, 2020, a Chinese respiratory specialist who visited Wuhan as a member of the national expert panel on pneumonia claimed that he was infected by 2019-nCoV despite being fully gowned with a protective suit and N95 respirator (34) . His first clinical manifestation was unilateral conjunctivitis, followed by fever and catarrhal symptoms 2 or 3 h later. He postulated that 2019-nCoV probably first infected the conjunctiva, then spread and cause viral pneumonia (34) . Soon after his report, health care personnel in China were urged to use eye protection when they were in close contact with CoVID-19 patients or suspected patients. However, Zhou and colleagues, in a preprint posted at medRxiv, reported that conjunctivitis was identified only in one patient out of 63 CoVID-19 cases and 4 suspected CoVID-19 cases (27) . Conjunctivitis was also the first symptom of 2019-nCoV infection in this patient. However, 2019-nCoV RNA tested by RT-PCR was positive and probably positive in conjunctival swab samples from only one and two CoVID-19 cases without conjunctivitis, respectively. None of the above three patients had ocular symptoms. 2019-nCoV RNA was not detected in conjunctival swab samples from the CoVID-9 patient complicated by conjunctivitis, who was an anesthesiologist. Her ocular symptoms occurred soon after performing tracheal intubation for a patient who was confirmed as having CoVID-19 later, and this was followed by fever and cough. Unfortunately, the personal protections used by this anesthesiologist during the tracheal intubation procedures were only a surgical mask, cap, and gloves, without a gown, face shield or goggles. Her five colleagues were also infected by the same patient, yet none of them exhibited any ocular complications (27) .",

This patient presented with excessive tearing and redness in both eyes, which were typical ocular manifestations of viral conjunctivitis, accompanied by a moderate fever of 38.2 \u2022 C that occurred 1 day earlier. 2019-nCoV RT-PCR tests for the conjunctival and oropharyngeal swabs sampled 2 days after the onset of fever was positive, but for those sampled 9, 18, and 20 days after the onset of fever were all negative (28) . Xia and colleagues reported unilateral conjunctivitis in one patient out of 30 confirmed CoVID-19 cases; conjunctival swabs sampled from this patient 3 and 5 days after the onset of CoVID-19 were both positive for 2019-nCoV by RT-PCR, whereas 58 conjunctival swab samples from the other 29 CoVID-19 patients were all negative for 2019-nCoV (31) . However, 2019-nCoV was not isolated and cultured in the conjunctival swab samples from the CoVID-19 patient with conjunctivitis.

            "text": "The extremely low positive rate of human CoV RNA test by RT-PCR in tears and conjunctival secretions from patients with SARS and CoVID-19 may have several interpretations. Firstly, the sensitivity of RT-PCR testing still needs to be improved. Previous reports on the sensitivity of RT-PCR in excretions reported a range from 50% to 60% (33, 37) . In current clinical practice, some suspected 2019-nCoV cases often had 2\u223c3 repeated tests of nasopharyngeal swabs before the positive results were obtained (28) . The need remains for a highly sensitive and specific PCR test to diagnose human CoV infections. Secondly, the samples were not collected at the right time. Recent evidence indicated that human CoV RNA-positive cases were all sampled in the early part of the disease course, whereas human CoV RNA-negative cases sampled in the later or convalescent phase of their illness (33) . de Wit and colleagues demonstrated that, based on their rhesus macaque model study, MERS-CoV RNA could be detected in the conjunctiva only within 6 days post infection (38) . Hence, it is reasonable to postulate that human CoV may present in tears only for a short period during the early phase of the disease. Thirdly, the contribution of antimicrobial agents, including lactoferrin and secretory IgA, in tears and constant tear rinsing, which continuously eliminates the virus on the ocular surface into the nasal cavity through the nasolacrimal duct (37, 39, 40) , should be considered. Lactoferrin can inhibit the binding of SARS-CoV to its entry receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), by preventing the adhesion of SARS-CoV to its attachment receptor, heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) (41) . Secretory IgA is another important antimicrobial agent in tears that helps to kill both bacteria and viruses. The host immune system can be activated and result in a significant increase in lactoferrin and secretory IgA levels in tears and circulating IgM level in plasm on the 3rd to 5th day and circulating IgG level in plasm on the 10th to 15th day after CoV infection or inoculation (39, 41) , which may contribute to why CoV RNA presents only in the early phase of the disease. Fourthly, the collection technique may not appropriate. The World Health Organization highly recommends the use of only synthetic fiber swabs with plastic shafts rather than calcium alginate swabs or swabs with wooden shafts for specimen sampling, as the latter two types of swabs may contain substances that inactivate some viruses and inhibit PCR testing (40) . Topical anesthesia is also not recommended for tear and conjunctival scraping sampling, for a topical anesthetic agent maybe also have a negative influence on the viability of viruses (40) . Moreover, the volume of tears collected when sampling may also have some influence on the positivity of the RT-PCR test.",

Further investigations have revealed that the invasion of SARS-CoV and HCoV-NL63 into host cells not only relies on the presence of ACE2 on host cell membrane as an entry receptor but also is modulated by other factors on host cell membranes such as HSPGs, which serve as attachment receptors (40, 45, 47) .",

Lang and Milewska described the possible mechanism of ACE2-mediated host cell entry for SARS-CoV and HCoV-NL63 virus (41, 45, 47) . First, the virus docked and bound to host cells by the interaction between the spike protein on viral surface and heparan sulfate chains of HSPGs on host cell membrane. This action facilitated further binding of spike protein on viral surface to its entry receptor, ACE2, on host cell surface. Then, the binding of spike protein of the virus to ACE2 protein of host cell membrane triggered the recruitment of clathrin, followed by clathrin-mediated dynamindependent endocytosis of viral particles, which required actin cortex remodeling (39, 45, 47) . Considering the 2019-nCoV has similar spike protein to SARS-CoV, and also uses ACE2 as its entry receptor to infect host cells, it is reasonable to presume that 2019-nCoV has the same invasive strategy for host cell entry as SARS-CoV and that HSPGs may also act as attachment receptors during the entry of 2019-nCoV into its host cells.",

Hence, it is a challenging task for health care professionals in the northern hemisphere to distinguish early 2019-nCoV infection from influenza and other respiratory viral infections in the seasons of winter and spring when respiratory diseases frequently break out (48) . Hospitalrelated viral transmission, especially transmissions between patients and health-care workers, is frequently reported just before the outbreak of a highly infectious novel respiratory virus such as SARS-CoV and 2019-nCoV (8) . Previous investigations have revealed that patients infected by a novel virus never identified before can easily transmit the pathogen to health personnel without enough personal protection; the latter getting infected will further become a source of spread and soon cause hospital-related viral transmission (8, (49) (50) (51) (52) (53) .

Based on previous experience in SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infection control, it is postulated that 2019-nCoV is sensitive to ultraviolet irradiation and heating. Sterilization can be achieved by heating at 56 \u2022 C for 30 min and by lipid solvents including 75% ethanol, chlorine-containing disinfectant, peroxyacetic acid, and chloroform but not by chlorhexidine (50) (51) (52) . Many ophthalmic instruments, i.e., probes for Atype and B-type ultrasound, ocular contact lenses such as the Goldmann three-mirrored lens and gonioscope, trial frames, slitlamp microscope, direct ophthalmoscope, automatic perimeter, and fundus camera, are frequently used by direct or close contact with patients and may act as media for virus spread. A non-contact tonometer may create an aerosol when measuring intraocular pressure by punching air onto the cornea of patients; hence, it may also facilitate virus spread by aerosol transmission. Therefore, complete sterilization by 75% ethanol or hydrogen peroxide cleaning or immersion should be performed soon after each use of above the ophthalmic instruments (50) (51) (52) . Complete sterilization using chlorine-containing disinfectant, peroxyacetic acid, and hydrogen peroxide is mandatory for clinics and operating rooms. Hand washing, preferably with the use of chlorhexidine alcoholic hand rub, after each ophthalmic examination or therapeutic procedure is highly recommended for the prevention of cross-infection.",

When ophthalmic emergency surgeries are performed on patients with confirmed or suspected SARS, MERS, or CoVID-19, the recommended personal protection equipment are similar to those for ophthalmic consultation of these patients. To avoid aerosol transmission during tracheal intubation, local ophthalmic anesthesia is highly recommended rather than general anesthesia, and patients should wear N95 respirators during ophthalmic surgeries under local anesthesia (51, 53) .",

Although respiratory droplets and direct contact have been identified as the main routes of transmission for human CoVs, the role of the eye in transmitting human CoVs is still under discussion. Considering that the conjunctiva of the eye is directly exposed to infectious droplets and fomites during close contact with infected individuals and contaminated hands and that the mucosa of the ocular surface and the upper respiratory tract are connected by the nasolacrimal duct and share the same entry receptors for some respiratory viruses, it is reasonable to postulate three roles that the eye may play in human CoV infection. Firstly, it may be a target organ for human CoVs. Secondly, the conjunctiva may be a portal of entry for or a transporter of human CoVs to infect the respiratory tract. Thirdly, tears and conjunctival secretions may act as media that spread human CoVs. However, the eye is rarely involved in SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and 2019-nCoV infection; conjunctivitis has been reported in only five cases with CoVID-19 but never in SARS and MERS patients. This suggests that the eye is neither a preferred organ for human CoV infection nor a preferred gateway of entry that enables human CoVs to infect the respiratory tract.",

Moreover, the extremely low positive rate of human CoV RNA tests by RT-PCR in tears and conjunctival secretions from patients with SARS and CoVID-19 may be related to the relatively low sensitivity of the current RT-PCR technique, later timing sample collection, and the activation of the host immune system and significant increases in lactoferrin and secretory IgA levels in tears and in circulating IgM and IgG levels in plasm. Hence, current negative RT-PCR results cannot exclude the possibility of the presence of SARS-CoV and 2019-nCoV in tears and conjunctival secretions. Considering that close doctor-patient contact is quite common in ophthalmic practice and is apt to transmit human CoVs via droplets and fomites, strict hand hygiene and proper personal protection are highly recommended for health care workers to avoid hospital-related viral transmission during ophthalmic practice.",
