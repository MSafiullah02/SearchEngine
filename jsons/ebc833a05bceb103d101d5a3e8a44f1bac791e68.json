However, these actions and the overall response to this crisis have raised serious ethical concerns, particularly with respect to triage and prioritisation of access to intensive care units (ICUs) if the demand ultimately exceeds the supply of care [2] .",

All agree that the principle of distributive justice takes on an important role in this context, just as it is taken into account in everyday life apart from the stresses introduced by the pandemic.",

If one is taking into account the number of years of life to be saved, as suggested by the American recommendations, patient age will of necessity become a major criterion with respect to decision-making. Indeed, the Italian Society for Intensive Care Medicine has put forward age thresholds for prioritising access to critical care [8] .",

The criteria emphasise the need to protect the most vulnerable patients from the risk of discrimination and arbitrary decisions. Criteria commonly used for decisions related to ICU admission include frailty, presence of co-morbidities, prior level of personal autonomy, nutritional status and cognition; patient age is included amongst these factors as well as the severity of the disease assessed by the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score. It is critical to recognise that no specific criteria were defined. This was a deliberate decision; ICU admissions ultimately depend on the ability to adapt to circumstances within given situations and contexts; amongst the latter issues, much depends on the availability of critical care beds, resuscitation equipment and the requisite scientific and medical knowledge required for appropriate care and treatment of this disease. Likewise, no age threshold been defined beyond which access to ICU care would be denied, save for statements included in the joint recommendation of the French Society of Anaesthesia and Intensive Care (Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 franc\u0327aise d'anesth\u00e9sie et de r\u00e9animation) and the French Military Health Service (Service de sant\u00e9 des arm\u00e9es; SSA) [4] . However, consideration of patient age as a sole criterion does not seem to be acceptable; the consideration of any single criterion considered in isolation would not be appropriate in these circumstances. It would appear that a discussion of all relevant criteria should be carried out without reference to any specific hierarchy; several helpful decision-making tools have been proposed by SFAR [4, 5] .",

As shown, there are four levels of priority; amongst the criteria to consider are the definitive need for resuscitation and the probability that an individual will derive significant benefit from this level of care [4] . This categorisation strategy is similar to that J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f recommended for surgical triage in war and in response to a disaster; for example, the P4 category here is analogous to surgical \"expectants\" who are those individuals who are too badly injured, whose chances of survival are very limited, and whose appropriate management would require the implementation of too great or even too uncertain levels of resources to the detriment of others who are less seriously affected [9] . This text also proposes a cognitive aid in the form of decision-support algorithms that consider the proposed criteria and suggest a course of action based on the level of priority established.",
