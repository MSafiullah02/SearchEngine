It can define the behaviour of disease in populations and on this basis the magnitude of the public-health problem can be assessed and an effective strategy can be developed. The importance of epidemiological surveillance was shown vividly during smallpox eradication. The intensified surveillance in west Africa, for example, as well as the Indian subcontinent in the late 1960s and early 1970s, found that fewer than 10% of cases were at that time reported or known to the health services concerned.1 This discovery resulted in the decision that a mass vaccination campaign without surveillance was ineffective since containment vaccination for the interruption of smallpox transmission had to be guided by effective surveillance activity. Currently in polio eradication, acute flaccid paralysis (APP) surveillance has shown the extent of wild poliovirus transmission in areas where intensive immunisation programmes have been instituted.2 In fact, this strategy has resulted in the stoppage of transmission in the western hemisphere, Europe, and the western Pacific within 10 years from the start of the global programme.",

During smallpox and polio eradication, it was recognised that surveillance often has weaknesses, such as poor population awareness, inadequate health facilities, superstition and beliefs that discourage reporting, conscious or unconscious suppression of reporting, and inadequate diagnostic techniques. Even today these weaknesses occur in surveillance activities for many diseases. The recent epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a vivid example. Unreported outbreaks of SARS in the southern coastal areas of China in the autumn of 2002, resulted in worldwide spread in 2003. Monkeypox outbreaks in May, 2003, in the USA are perhaps more appropriately classified in the category of inadequate diagnosis, but showed the international community what could happen in the case of the deliberate release of smallpox virus, whose clinical features closely resemble those of smallpox.3\n",

Although this approach may limit the scope of reporting, we felt that a priority in this trial should be sustainability of sentinel activity, given that such sentinels usually handle a heavy workload with limited available resources. All sentinels function within their own limited resources and are approved by their national supervisors. The distribution of the sentinels shown in figure 1, however, shows some large areas without sentinels, an indication of the reluctance of some national authorities to permit free reporting or the absence of collaborating sentinels in those nations.",

HIV-positivity rates can be compared with reference to the AIDS Epidemic Update, December, 2002 (table 4\n).9 Towards the end of 20th century, high positive rates up to 12% were noted in Cameroon, Uganda, Cambodia, and Laos (table 5\n). However, as far as limited data from AGSnet is concerned, AIDS prevalence would seem to be in decline in these areas, although it should be borne in mind that blood donors may not be representative of the general population.

Although the system's geographical coverage is limited, during the operation over the past few years it has proved to be unique in terms of persistent electronic, realtime exchange of information, and willingness to provide directly the information from resource-poor areas.",

Prioritisation of target diseases will be a critical issue. Surveillance would be more sensitive if AGSnet targeted fewer and more important diseases. It would be desirable to organise an international conference of individual sentinels of AGSnet to optimise strategy and logistics in view of the increasing disparity of surveillance sensitivity between different states and regions. There are training courses in field epidemiology organised by a few institutions, such as the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, WHO, Medicins sans Frontieres, and JICA. It would be useful for the sentinels to participate in course as the opportunity arises. The quality of AGSnet collected information should be further examined\u2014eg, for its sensitivity, timeliness, stability, and sustainability.10 During the initial phase of the AGSnet system, there was no record of how surveillance information was translated into actual public-health action. Future development of this area would be a critical element for ACIH to pursue.",

During the final phase of smallpox eradication a few national programmes, fearful of blame for being the last smallpox state, suppressed case reports either at national level or district level. This policy resulted in epidemics. The recent SARS epidemic falls into the same category. But these programmes succeeded in the rapid elimination of hidden foci, once they started to report all cases and initiated containment.",

Its aim is to add more disease information, as necessary for global epidemiological surveillance headed by WHO. The results of AGSnet obtained so far indicate that the system was able to discover some valuable information on infectious diseases of international importance, happening in special areas. Although the information is irregular, it may be added to the WHO pooled surveillance data worldwide. Further development of this system seem to be desirable, including assessment as regards its sensitivity and resulting public-health action. It should be noted, however, that such network in no way replaces or negates the need for strong national surveillance, alert, and response mechanisms.",
