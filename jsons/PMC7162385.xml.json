            "text": "Alterations in cellular ion homeostasis are a common hallmark during infection of mammalian cells by animal viruses (Carrasco, 1995). The vast majority of RNA animal viruses encode cytotoxic pore\u2010forming proteins known as viroporins, which modify membrane function at late stages of infection and facilitate budding of virions from infected cells. Viroporins are small, non\u2010glycosylated, highly hydrophobic viral polypeptides which interact with cell membranes and increase their permeability to ions and other low\u2010molecular\u2010weight compounds (Carrasco, 1995; Gonzalez and Carrasco, 2003). They are usually integral proteins that possess at least one amphipathic \u03b1\u2010helix and, in some instances, a second hydrophobic domain. Upon membrane insertion, viroporins tend to oligomerize to assemble hydrophilic pores (Pinto et al., 1992; Grice et al., 1997; Agirre et al., 2002; Melton et al., 2002; Pavlovic et al., 2003; Wilson et al., 2004). Some viroporins are not required for production of viral progeny, although their expression significantly increases the formation of new virus particles (Klimkait et al., 1990; Watanabe et al., 2001; Kuo and Masters, 2003; DeDiego et al., 2007). However, these proteins are present in low amounts both in virions and at the plasma membrane (Klimkait et al., 1990; Yu et al., 1994; Loewy et al., 1995).",

            "text": "The 6K protein from Sindbis virus (SV; family Togaviridae), M2 from influenza A virus (IAV; family Orthomixoviridae), and 2B and 3A from poliovirus (PV; family Picornaviridae) represent examples of well\u2010known viroporins (Gonzalez and Carrasco, 2003). SV 6K, a palmitoylated protein of 55 amino acids, contains a conserved sequence motif, rich in aromatic residues, consisting of two interfacial domains at the N\u2010terminal region, which has been described to be important both for virus budding and to enhance membrane permeability (Sanz et al., 2003). IAV M2 (96 amino acids), one of the best characterized viroporins, forms a proton channel acting both during viral entry and virion budding (Ruigrok et al., 1991; Mould et al., 2000). PV 2B protein is associated with the viral replication complex and virus\u2010induced membranes (Bienz et al., 1992; Schlegel et al., 1996), and localizes to the ER and Golgi complex when expressed individually (Sandoval and Carrasco, 1997). Furthermore, the coxsackievirus (CV) 2B protein has been directly implicated in the disruption of Ca2+ homeostasis during infection (van Kuppeveld et al., 1997). PV 3A exhibits significant effects on membrane rearrangement, inhibits glycoprotein trafficking, and participates in initiation of viral RNA synthesis (Suhy et al., 2000; Choe et al., 2005). Recently, we described the viroporin activity of E protein from mouse hepatitis virus (MHV\u2010A59; family Coronaviridae) both in bacteria and in mammalian cells (Madan et al., 2005a). Moreover, MHV variants with mutations in the E gene present aberrant morphology of virus particles as also occurs when SV 6K gene is mutated (Fischer et al., 1998). These results provide evidence for a role of some viroporins in virion morphogenesis. The viroporin group also contains viral proteins, such as HIV\u20101 Vpu, human respiratory syncitial virus SH, avian reovirus p10, Japanese encephalitis virus NS2B or SARS\u2010CoV E protein among others (Chang et al., 1999; Lombardo et al., 2000; Gonzalez and Carrasco, 2003; Liao et al., 2006). Additionally, a number of viral glycoproteins (e.g. NS3 of bluetongue virus or gp41 of HIV\u20101) have also been described to possess viroporin\u2010like activity (Arroyo et al., 1995; Han and Harty, 2004).",

            "text": "Much research effort continues to be directed towards discovery of new viroporins and analysis of their function during infection. We found that both p7 and NS4A proteins from hepatitis C virus (HCV; family Flaviviridae) share typical features with the viroporin group. p7 is a small hydrophobic protein of 63 amino acids that is not required for RNA replication (Carrere\u2010Kremer et al., 2002) and forms oligomeric cation channels both in planar lipid bilayers and in cells (Griffin et al., 2003; Pavlovic et al., 2003; Clarke et al., 2006). On the other hand, HCV NS4A is a small non\u2010structural protein known to act as an essential cofactor for serine protease activity of HCV NS3 and is therefore required for the proteolytic processing of the viral polyprotein (Failla et al., 1994). NS4A localizes to ER membranes and is responsible for directing the NS3 protease to these membranes (Wolk et al., 2000).",

            "text": "An increasing number of animal viruses are known to induce a defensive apoptotic response in host cells at late stages of infection (O'Brien, 1998). Several picornaviruses, including PV and CV, are able to kill cells by apoptosis in a variety of situations (Tolskaya et al., 1995; Agol et al., 1998; Carthy et al., 1998). Many other enveloped RNA viruses, such as alphaviruses, coronaviruses, influenza viruses or HCV, also induce caspase\u20103\u2010mediated apoptosis (Grandgirard et al., 1998; An et al., 1999; Kalkeri et al., 2001; Wurzer et al., 2003). Programmed cell death or apoptosis is involved in the organized elimination of cells during tissue development and somatic cell turnover, as well as during cell senescence and organism ageing (Kerr et al., 1972; Thompson, 1995). Several pathways can lead to execution of apoptosis by activating a family of proteases known as caspases (Cohen, 1997). The extrinsic or death\u2010receptor pathway requires binding of ligands such as CD95 to transmembrane death receptors, followed by activation of caspase\u20108 (Ashkenazi and Dixit, 1998). The intrinsic or mitochondrial pathway, triggered by mitochondrial membrane depolarization, involves disruption of the mitochondrial membrane and subsequent release from the intermembrane space of cytochrome c, which participates in formation of the apoptosome together with apoptosis protease\u2010activating factor\u20101 and pro\u2010caspase 9 (Zamzami and Kroemer, 2001). In addition, an ER\u2010specific apoptotic pathway is activated by perturbation of ER Ca(2+) homeostasis or under ER stress conditions, involving activation of caspase\u201012 and caspase\u20109 (Morishima et al., 2002). Although the upstream steps of these pathways are different, they converge with the activation of the effector caspase\u20103, followed by extensive degradation of nuclear DNA and fragmentation of the nucleus of apoptotic cells.",

Our findings reveal that both p7 and NS4A proteins from HCV have the capacity to permeabilize baby hamster kidney (BHK) cells. We also provide evidence that viroporins can induce an apoptotic response in these cells. Finally, we show that in addition to its localization to the ER and Golgi compartments, PV 2B is also associated with mitochondria and alters the normal morphology of these organelles, as occurs with HCV p7 and NS4A. Together, these data suggest a previously unrecognized role of viroporins in cytotoxicity and indicate that these proteins are able to induce apoptosis upon viral infection.",

            "text": "A comparative analysis was performed of the capacity of different viroporins to permeabilize the plasma membrane of BHK cells. To this end, the following known viroporins were selected: 6K from SV, E protein from MHV\u2010A59, M2 from IAV, and 2B and 3A from PV. In addition, two small proteins from HCV, p7 and NS4A, were included in the study. These two proteins were selected as potential members of the viroporin group after examining their sequences, structural features, and their Kyte\u2010Doolittle hydrophobicity profiles (data not shown). To analyse membrane permeabilization to the translation inhibitor hygromycin B (HB), an expression system was developed based on a SV replicon. Seven replicons were obtained by cloning the viroporin sequence after the SV capsid (C) gene (Fig. 1). Upon translation of the subgenomic mRNA, the C protein is detached by its autoproteolytic activity and the remaining protein is synthesized at levels comparable to those obtained with late proteins in SV\u2010infected cells (Madan et al., 2005b). This system is suitable to examine the permeabilizing capacity of each protein at different times after transfection. In vitro\u2010transcribed RNAs from the different pT7SVrep C + Viroporin plasmids were electroporated in BHK cells and, at 5, 8 and 16 h post electroporation (hpe), protein synthesis was estimated in the absence or presence of HB (Fig. 2). C protein and viroporin synthesis were already detected by radiolabelling with [35S]Met/Cys at 5 hpe (data not shown). Figure 2A shows a representative PAGE analysis at 8 hpe, in which viroporin bands are clearly present and migrate according to their expected molecular weight. To detect NS4A expression at 8 hpe, Western blot analysis was carried out using a monoclonal anti\u2010NS4A antibody. The presence of non\u2010proteolysed C\u2010NS4A product was confirmed using a rabbit serum against the C protein (Fig. 2A, lower panels). Notably, the powerful permeabilization to HB induced by PV 2B protein from 5 hpe led to almost total inhibition of protein synthesis (Fig. 2B). MHV\u2010A59 E protein also promoted significant entry of HB at 5 hpe that was increased at 8 hpe, when translation was inhibited by HB to about 15% of control. The presence of small amounts of mature E protein alongside significant quantities of the non\u2010proteolysed product C\u2010E was sufficient to permeabilize BHK cells (Fig. 2A). The precursor C\u2010E itself is probably also capable of permeabilizing BHK cells. The other viral proteins analysed exhibited a delayed permeabilization activity compared with 2B or E proteins. For example, the well\u2010known viroporin 6K caused increasing levels of permeabilization beginning soon after electroporation, but membrane permeability to HB was not profoundly altered until 16 hpe. Finally, IAV M2, HCV p7 and NS4A proteins all caused entry of HB to a similar extent at 16 hpe, leading to 70\u201375% inhibition of protein synthesis. HCV p7 also has viroporin activity in bacterial cells. Specifically, expression of p7 in Escherichia coli resulted in membrane permeabilization to HB and [3H] choline, ultimately promoting cell lysis (data not shown). Despite the low expression of NS4A, inhibition of translation by HB was about 62% at 8 hpe (Fig. 2B). Previous works have reported that NS4A inhibits translation in mouse and Huh\u20107 cells (Kato et al., 2002; Kou et al., 2006). Therefore, it is possible that NS4A interferes with translation of subgenomic mRNA in BHK cells. HB did not enter control BHK cells transfected with either transcription buffer alone or with RNA encoding only the C protein (Fig. 2A and B). These results indicate that p7 and NS4A from HCV are able to permeabilize mammalian cells. In contrast, PV 3A did not lead to significant cell permeabilization, as indicated by the 34% inhibition of protein synthesis due to HB at 16 hpe.",

            "text": "An increasing number of viral proteins have been described to be endowed with apoptotic or anti\u2010apoptotic functions. HBx protein from hepatitis B virus (HBV), E1^E4 from human papillomavirus, and SV glycoproteins are examples of pro\u2010apoptotic proteins, whereas M11L from myxoma virus, F1L from vaccinia virus, and BHRF1 from Epstein\u2010Barr virus represent anti\u2010apoptotic proteins (Boya et al., 2004). Thus far, the viroporins MHV\u2010A59 E and Vpu from HIV\u20101 have been reported to induce apoptosis (An et al., 1999; Akari et al., 2001). The aim of the present work was to assay the pro\u2010apoptotic activity of other proteins with pore\u2010forming properties. Chromatin condensation and nuclear DNA fragmentation with the appearance of apoptotic bodies were first analysed as typical cytological markers of programmed cell death. The nuclei of cells expressing the different viroporins selected in this study were stained with DAPI at 16 hpe and their morphology was examined. Control BHK cells and cells expressing C protein exhibited normal rounded nuclei. In contrast, all viroporins led to clear signs of apoptosis, as also occurred in positive\u2010control cells expressing PV 3Cpro (Barco et al., 2000) or MHV\u2010A59 E protein, as well as in cells treated with staurosporine (Fig. 3A). To further test whether viroporin\u2010mediated cell death was due to apoptosis, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase\u2010mediated dUTP nick end\u2010labelling (TUNEL) assay was carried out using fluorescence microscopy. An amount of TUNEL\u2010positive cells that was comparable to, but slightly lower than, the number with fragmented nuclei was detected at 16 hpe (Fig. 3A and B). The proportion of apoptotic cells was variable, depending on the viroporin analysed. Thus, the strongest apoptotic response was observed with PV 2B, 3A and HCV NS4A, whereas E, M2, 6K and p7 induced apoptosis in a lower proportion of cells (Fig. 3B). It should be noted that about 10% and 35% of the cells that expressed 2B and NS4A respectively were TUNEL\u2010positive at 8 hpe (data not shown). The proportion of apoptotic cells induced by the other viroporins was not significant at that time. Moreover, measurement of annexin V binding also revealed that the highest numbers of both annexin V\u2010positive cells and cells with fragmented and condensed nuclei were around 32% and 43% after 2B and NS4A expression respectively (data not shown). These results indicate that all viroporins tested can induce apoptosis of BHK cells, but 2B and NS4A are particularly powerful and rapid inducers of programmed cell death.",

            "text": "Activation of caspases, a family of cysteine proteases, plays a central role in the execution of apoptosis (Cohen, 1997). To assess the involvement of caspases in viroporin\u2010induced apoptosis, we examined activation of the effector caspase\u20103. Hydrolysis of translation initiation factor 4GI (eIF4GI) is a typical phenomenon observed in apoptotic cells. Activated caspase\u20103 cleaves eIF4GI at two different sites to generate characteristic fragments (Marissen and Lloyd, 1998). Thus, cleavage of eIF4GI was tested by Western blotting in cells expressing different viroporins (Fig. 4A). Previous analyses of eIF4GI using specific antibodies have revealed the existence of two proteins of \u223c220 and \u223c150 kDa in BHK cells. As described earlier, eIF4GI exhibits different mobility patterns in SDS\u2010PAGE of mammalian cells, possibly due to post\u2010translational modifications (Castello et al., 2006a). At 16 hpe, eIF4GI was cleaved in viroporin\u2010expressing cells to generate two cleavage products that migrate below the 50 kDa marker, as occurred in cells treated with inducers of apoptosis such as actinomicyn D (ActD) and cycloheximide (CHX) (Fig. 4A). Cleavage of eIF4GI also occurs in cells infected with picornaviruses or retroviruses through the action of different viral proteases (Etchison et al., 1982; Ventoso et al., 2001; Alvarez et al., 2003). Consequently, eIF4GI cleavage products observed in cells transfected with SV replicons that express either PV 2Apro or HIV\u20101 PR differ from those detected in viroporin\u2010expressing cells (Fig. 4A, left lower panel) (Castello et al., 2006b). Notably, NS4A again acted as a potent inductor of apoptosis, such that apoptotic eIF4GI fragments could already be detected from 5 hpe and their presence was even clearer at 8 hpe. This result is consistent with the observation of a significant number of TUNEL\u2010positive cells at 8 hpe following transfection with rep C + NS4A (data not shown). However, at these early times, there was no evidence of eIF4GI proteolysis in cells transfected with other viroporins.",

The \u223c89 kDa cleavage product detected in these cells corresponds to that described for PARP proteolysis by caspase\u20103 (Boulares et al., 1999). Taken together, these results indicate that eIF4GI is possibly a better substrate for caspase\u20103 than PARP. Furthermore, caspase\u20103 activation was indicated by the observation that DEVD\u2010fmk, an irreversible cell\u2010permeable inhibitor of caspase\u20103, efficiently blocked eIF4GI cleavage induced by NS4A and the other viroporins at 8 and/or 16 hpe (Fig. 4C). Because transfection of rep C did not cause proteolysis of either eIF4GI or PARP, our findings indicate that viroporins activate caspase\u22123.",

However, in the last few years, HCV p7 protein and several viral pro\u2010apoptotic proteins have been also found to be partially associated with mitochondria (Griffin et al., 2004; D'Agostino et al., 2005). Therefore, we decided to explore the involvement of the mitochondrial pathway in apoptosis induced by viroporins. First, we tested the possible colocalization of 2B and NS4A with Mitotracker and other organelle markers (Fig. 5A\u2013F). Both proteins partially colocalized with Mitotracker in BHK (Fig. 5C and F) and Huh\u20107 cells (data not shown). Interestingly, in both 2B\u2010 and NS4A\u2010expressing cells, mitochondria did not exhibit their typical long shape, appearing instead as punctate entities (Fig. 5, compare distribution of Mitotracker in C, F and G with control BHK cells in G, upper left panel). In addition, it should be noted that 2B and p7 expression also led to accumulation of mitochondria around the nucleus or at nuclear poles respectively (Fig. 5C and G). 2B was also present in the ER and predominantly in the Golgi, while NS4A colocalized with ER but appeared to be excluded from the Golgi (Fig. 5A, B, D and E). Mitochondrial localization of the other viroporins was also analysed. Unlike 2B and NS4A, none of the other viroporins analysed colocalized with mitochondria (data not shown). However, the expression of 6K, E and 3A altered the normal morphology of mitochondrial network (Fig. 5G, compare viroporin\u2010expressing cells with normal BHK or C\u2010expressing cells).",

Therefore, the distribution of cytochrome c in cells expressing viroporins was studied by immunostaining. In cells transfected with transcription buffer alone or which express C protein alone, cytochrome c is usually present in long structures corresponding to mitochondria dispersed throughout the cytoplasm (Fig. 6A). Interestingly, the distribution of cytochrome c changed drastically in viroporin\u2010transfected cells and was found to be spread throughout the entire cytoplasm, as observed in ActD\u2013CHX\u2010positive control cells (Fig. 6A, white arrows). Notably, 16 h after expression of PV 2B, 3A and NS4A, nearly 60% of the cells had released cytochrome c, while in the case of NS4A, a similar proportion was observed as early as 7 hpe (Fig. 6B and data not shown). About 10% of cells that synthesized SV 6K and HCV p7 exhibited a diffuse staining pattern at 16 hpe, while pro\u2010apoptotic E protein and IAV M2 induced cytochrome c release in a slightly higher proportion (\u223c20%). These results are in accordance with our findings regarding the activation of caspase\u20103. Therefore, mitochondrial alterations and cytochrome c efflux strongly suggest involvement of the mitochondrial pathway in apoptosis induced by viroporins.",

            "text": "Recent studies have elucidated a novel role for changes in intracellular ion homeostasis as important modulators of the cell death programme (Franco et al., 2006). Our present results provide new evidence that viroporins induce apoptotic cell responses. Five viroporins (SV 6K, MHV\u2010A59 E, IAV M2, and PV 2B and 3A) encoded by different RNA viruses, as well as two potential viroporins, p7 and NS4A from HCV, were expressed in mammalian cells by means of a SV\u2010derived replicon. Our findings provide evidence that p7 and NS4A from HCV enhance membrane permeability in BHK cells. These results agree well with reports that p7 assembles cation\u2010selective ion channels in membranes, leading to increased membrane permeability of bacterial cells (Clarke et al., 2006; Madan, 2006). Although HCV NS4A fulfils many features of viroporins, its ability to assemble membrane pores still remains unexplored. The extent and time\u2010course of membrane permeabilization depend on the viroporin tested. Thus, the viroporins analysed can be classified in two groups: those that induce rapid permeabilization, and those in which permeabilization is induced more slowly. The first group includes PV 2B and MHV\u2010A59 E, because both polypeptides efficiently permeabilized the plasma membrane soon after their synthesis. In contrast, SV 6K, IAV M2, and HCV p7 and NS4A required a longer period of expression to exert extensive membrane permeabilization. PV 3A has the capacity to perturb bacterial membranes (Lama and Carrasco, 1992), but it does not lead to significant permeabilization of either BHK\u201021 cells (this study) or HeLa cells (Aldabe et al., 1996). The lack of activity of PV 3A in mammalian cells, even after a long period of expression, may be due to its efficient inhibition of ER\u2010to\u2010Golgi transport, thereby interfering with the localization of 3A itself at the plasma membrane (Doedens et al., 1997). Alternatively, the delivery of 3A to the plasma membrane may require the presence of other PV proteins. Notably, PV 2B displayed the highest permeabilizing capacity. Picornavirus 2B also exhibits anti\u2010secretory activity, but in this case the inhibition is only partial (Cornell et al., 2006). 2B is endowed with a potent capacity to cause profound and rapid alterations in cellular ion homeostasis. Thus, CV 2B induces Ca2+ release from intracellular stores (ER and Golgi) and subsequent extracellular Ca2+ influx to the cytoplasm (van Kuppeveld et al., 1997). Therefore, a generalized permeabilization of both intracellular compartments and plasma membrane mediated by 2B can provoke an ionic imbalance, leading to disruption of the permeability barrier.",

            "text": "Several cellular ion channels participate in apoptotic cell death (Lang et al., 2003). Perturbation of ion homeostasis is a common hallmark of apoptosis, giving rise to depolarization of the plasma membrane associated with intracellular cation overload and cell volume decreases due to anion and H2O efflux (Waring, 2005; Burg et al., 2006; Franco et al., 2006). Therefore, deregulation of ion channels provokes various pathological conditions or channelopathies (Jentsch et al., 2004). Our data indicate that several viroporins trigger programmed cell death in BHK cells. Consistent with these findings, coronavirus E protein was described as an inducer of apoptosis before its viroporin activity was uncovered (An et al., 1999). The viroporins tested in this study produced both DNA fragmentation and generation of apoptotic bodies, as revealed by TUNEL assay and DAPI staining, after several hours of expression in BHK cells. Furthermore, cleavage of eIF4GI and PARP indicated that viroporin\u2010induced apoptosis was dependent on caspase activation. The fact that the inhibitor DEVD\u2010fmk abrogated eIF4GI cleavage provides further evidence supporting the involvement of caspase\u20103 in this process. Notably, the most rapid induction of caspase\u20103 activation was seen with HCV NS4A, followed by PV 2B and 3A. These results agree well with the recent finding that NS4A renders Huh\u20107 cells prone to undergo apoptosis (Nomura\u2010Takigawa et al., 2006). It is possible that the ability of NS4A to inhibit host and viral translation (Kou et al., 2006), together with its permeabilizing capacity, accounts for the rapid development of apoptosis. Consistent with our findings, a number of viral pro\u2010apoptotic proteins contain amphipathic \u03b1\u2010helices that have potential pore\u2010forming properties, as occurs with both Vpr from HIV\u20101 and HBx from HBV (Boya et al., 2004).",

The permeabilizing capacity of 2B, 6K, M2 and p7 was proportional to the degree of cell death observed in each case. However, a large number of cells expressing 3A underwent apoptosis, despite the fact that no significant plasma membrane permeabilization was detected. Most probably, inhibition of the vesicular transport system by PV 3A also activates alternative apoptotic pathways. Consistent with this possibility, a recent report indicated that mutations in GABA(A) receptors lead to retention of channel molecules in the ER, thereby causing ER stress followed by apoptosis (Hirose, 2006). On the other hand, coronavirus E induced efficient membrane permeabilization but did not provoke apoptosis in a high proportion of cells. These findings may suggest that besides induction of permeability changes, some viroporins could exert other effects on cellular functions to regulate the degree of apoptosis progression. Nevertheless, the pro\u2010apoptotic activity of each viroporin alone might be weakened or enhanced in the context of viral infection, where other pro\u2010apoptotic or anti\u2010apoptotic viral proteins can coexist.",

Our study revealed that a low proportion of NS4A not only colocalized with mitochondria in BHK cells but also produced mitochondria fragmentation. NS4A was abundant in the ER but was excluded from the Golgi compartment. Notably, we found that 2B protein was also associated with mitochondria and induced a perinuclear redistribution of these organelles. A similar anomalous organization of the mitochondrial network was observed in cells expressing HCV p7, PV 3A or SV 6K, suggesting that viroporins may cause mitochondrial alterations. In accordance with these results, several pro\u2010apoptotic viral proteins, such as HBV HBx or E1^E4 protein from human papillomavirus, also induce dramatic alterations in mitochondrial morphology during the early stages of apoptosis (Takada et al., 1999; Karbowski and Youle, 2003; Raj et al., 2004). Furthermore, we found that 2B, 3A and NS4A triggered the release of cytochrome c in a high proportion of cells.

            "text": "In contrast to our findings that PV viroporins induce apoptosis in BHK cells, an anti\u2010apoptotic effect mediated by picornavirus 2B and 3A has been reported in HeLa cells (Neznanov et al., 2001; Campanella et al., 2004). Several possibilities can be put forward to account for these apparent discrepancies. It is possible that a critical intracellular level of PV viroporins is required to trigger anti\u2010apoptotic or apoptotic pathways. Thus, transfection of plasmids or mRNAs renders a relatively low expression of 3A and 2B, which may result in their lack of effect or even inhibition of apoptosis (Neznanov et al., 2001; Campanella et al., 2004; Salako et al., 2006). However, in the present study the use of a SV\u2010derived replicon (rep C + 2B) guaranteed high expression of PV 2B protein, similar to that found during PV infection, leading to clear signs of apoptosis in transfected cells. Campanella and coworkers demonstrated that CV 2B expression decreases the Ca2+ content of both ER and the Golgi stores, and that this results in downregulation of Ca2+ signalling to mitochondria and prevents apoptosis (Campanella et al., 2004). Our findings provide evidence for a novel effect of 2B in mitochondria. The localization of a pool of 2B in mitochondria could directly affect their membrane permeability and disrupt Ca2+ regulation. Ca2+ plays an important role in the regulation of mitochondrial connectivity during apoptosis (Pinton et al., 2001; Rapizzi et al., 2002). Consistent with this possibility, 2B altered the normal mitochondrial network pattern. Pro\u2010apoptotic HBx protein from HBV also associates with mitochondria and mediates alteration of cytosolic calcium, which is a fundamental requirement for viral replication (Bouchard et al., 2001). A given viral protein may exhibit anti\u2010 or pro\u2010apoptotic activities depending on several factors, as is the case in NS1 from IAV and HIV\u20101 Vpr (Lowy, 2003; Moon and Yang, 2006). This dual behaviour may have a physiological significance for viral replication. During the early phase of infection when the expression level of PV proteins is low, 2B and 3A may protect infected cells from apoptosis, thereby permitting RNA replication. However, at later stages, when high levels of viroporins are synthesized and permeabilization of cells is evident (Lopez\u2010Rivas et al., 1987; Carrasco, 1995), both 2B and 3A, together with 3Cpro and 2Apro, lead to induction of apoptosis in the infected cells (Barco et al., 2000; Calandria et al., 2004). Thus, apoptosis induced by 3Cpro, 2Apro, 2B and 3A could represent an efficient mechanism for the spread of PV virions, avoiding host immune inflammatory responses. The cell line used could also influence the development of apoptosis. Moreover, the reaction of the host apoptotic machinery to picornavirus infection has been reported to be generally cell\u2010dependent and affected by the cell's environment, the status of its differentiation, and the genotype (Romanova et al., 2005). In agreement with our results, the apoptotic programme induced by PV in murine cells involves damaged mitochondria, efflux of cytochrome c, and activation of caspase\u20109, followed by activation of downstream effector caspases. The existence of possible interactions between viroporins and mitochondrial factors or some other endogenous proteins will open an interesting field of investigation that may lead us to a better understanding of virus biology and the role of ionic alterations during infection. Further studies of viroporins and their apoptotic effects could help to clarify the pathogenesis of different viral diseases and will lay the foundations for the development of novel antiviral compounds to block viroporin activity.",
