There are no specific therapies available and investigations regarding the treatment of the COVID-19 are still lacking. This prompted us to perform a preliminary in silico study on the COVID-19 protease with anti-malarial compounds in the search of potential inhibitor. We have calculated log P and log S values in addition to molecular docking and PASS predictions. Among the seven studied compounds, mepacrine appears as the potential inhibitor of the COVID-19 followed by chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine and phomarin. Therefore, these anti-malarial drugs may be potential drug candidate for the treatment of this novel coronavirus.",

This motivated us to perform a systematic study on some anti-malarial drugs using molecular docking and reinvestigate their biological activities and pharmacological effects. Such studies become important as they offer some insights into structure-based drug design. Recently, Lin et al. [13] have reported the structure-based stabilization of non-native protein-protein interactions of the coronavirus in antiviral drug design. However, there exists no systematic study on the inhibition of the coronavirus by anti-malarial drugs to the best of our knowledge.

In general, about 85% of drugs have log S values in the range of -1 to -5, a few have values below -5 but virtually none have values below -6 [20] . All log S lies between -1 and -5, except mepacrine (1) having log S slightly below -5. These log P and log S values suggest that the drug molecules may easily diffuse across the cell membranes, as their organic (lipid) solubility is quite large. This study has been focused on the main protease in the novel corona virus as a potential target protein for COVID-19 treatment. The 6LU7 [21] is the main protease found in the COVID-19, which has been deposited as a PDB file in early February 2020. Therefore, we have chosen 6LU7 as a potential target for molecular docking studies. The molecular docking calculations have been performed as blind, i.e., covered the entire protein surface, not any specific region of the protein as the binding pocket in order to avoid sampling bias. The output clusters have been obtained after each docking step and ranked according to the full fitness (FF) score by the SwissDock algorithm. A greater negative FF score suggests a more favorable binding mode between ligand and receptor with a better fit. The results of molecular docking are displayed in Fig. 2 . The docking parameters such as binding energy, FF score along with the amino acids (residues) found in the active site pockets of 6LU7 have been also listed in Table 1 For the purpose of drug design, it is desirable to analyze the detailed biological activities or possible pharmacological effects along with toxicity or possible adverse effects of the drug compounds. Therefore, we have predicted activity spectra of anti malarial compounds using the PASS software. This prediction is based on the study of structure activity relationships (SAR) for the training set including about 50,000 drugs, drug-candidates and lead compounds whose biological activity has been reported experimentally. An average accuracy of prediction in leave-one-out cross-validation is about 85% [19] . In supplementary Table S1 , we have listed the pharmacological effects as well as adverse affects of these compounds with Pa > 70%. This is to ensure that the molecules will most likely exhibit these activities in the experiment. Furthermore, the probability that the molecules have several closely analogous drugs is quite high. These results of PASS prediction might be useful during clinical trials and drug development stage of the COVID-19.",

Therefore, a detailed analysis on these drugs is required. Meanwhile, we suggest some clinic trials of these compounds or their suitable combinations. Our PASS predictions may be useful for clinical trials of these inhibitors of COVID-19. Further studies in these directions are in progress in our lab and shall be reported shortly.",

The results of docking analyses show the mepacrine (1) forms H-bond (bond length = 2.663 \u00c5) with the glutamate (GLU-166), a polar amino acid. On the contrary, chloroquine (2) forms H-bond (bond length = 2.321 \u00c5) with the glycine (GLY-143), a non-polar amino acid. Unlike 2, quinine (3) and hydroxychloroquine (4) form H-bonds with the histidine (HSD-163), a polar amino acid (bond length = 2.377 \u00c5) and phenylalanine (PHE-140), an aromatic amino acid (bond length = 2.501 \u00c5). Artemisnin ((5) forms two H-bonds of bond lengths 2.447 \u00c5 and 2.369 \u00c5 with the same amino acid (GLY-143). Phomarin (6) also forms two H-bonds, one with the GLY-143 (bond length = 2.462 \u00c5) and another with the GLU-166 (bond length = 2.607 \u00c5). Proguanil (7) forms H-bond of 2.262 \u00c5 with the leucine (LEU-141), a non-polar amino acid. The binding modes of different anti-malarial compounds with the 6LU7 receptor have been shown inFig. 2as well. Thus, our docking analyses suggest that the COVID-19 protease (6LU7) can be inhibited by anti-malarial drug compounds. Based on the binding affinity, the inhibition potential of these compounds can be ranked as; 1 > 2 > 3 > 4 > 5 > 6 > 7. Combining the results of log P and log S with the docking, we can expect that the compounds 1, 2, 4 and 6 should behave as potential inhibitors of the COVID-19.",
