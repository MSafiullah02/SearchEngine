In 2011, the World Health Organization (WHO) created a case definition for Severe Acute Respiratory Infection (SARI) in an attempt to standardize global surveillance of hospitalization related to influenza (flu)-allowing national health authorities to interpret their data in an international context [2] . Flu is particularly difficult to surveil because its clinical presentation is often indistinguishable from other respiratory viruses [3] . With that in mind, the WHO designed the SARI criteria to strike a balance between sensitivity and specificity, while also noting that the case definition is not necessarily intended to capture all cases but to describe trends over time [4] .",

Covariates included age, sex, birthweight, prematurity, medical history, smoke exposure [nargila (smoking pipe) or cigarettes], vitamin D level, breastfeeding, length of illness, admission diagnoses of pneumonia, bronchopneumonia, bronchiolitis, sepsis, or febrile seizure, viral detection, and markers of illness severity including antibiotics before or after hospitalization, length of stay, ICU admission, oxygen use, mechanical ventilation, and death. All analyses were completed using STATA version 15.1. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) of the SARI criteria and modifications excluding either fever or cough were calculated for each respiratory virus tested. Parainfluenza viruses 1, 2, and 3 were combined into one category, as was flu A, B, and C. This was done for simplicity and relatively low numbers of detections of each subtype. For NPV and PPV, we assumed the prevalence found in our study to be accurate for hospitalized children with fever or respiratory symptoms. For each virus, the prevalence of cough and fever was also calculated. These data were then stratified by age into three groups: less than 3 months, 3-5 months, and 6-23 months. These groups were chosen to compare results to a previous study; and were based off a visual analysis of the age of virus-positive patients meeting SARI criteria [17] .",

If understanding the true burden of disease is desired, a higher sensitivity is important. While the SARI case definition was initially intended for flu surveillance, several studies have since used it for surveillance of other respiratory viruses [16] [17] [18] [22] [23] [24] .

One potential explanation for differences between our studies is the use of singleplex RT-PCR in our study versus the multiplex RT-PCR that was used in Rha, with singleplex historically being more sensitive. Given that RSV vaccines are in the pipeline, it is important to also capture all cases of RSV to determine the true burden of illness to document if the vaccine is effective at impacting disease. Thus, if the SARI definition is used for ARI surveillance studies, it will once again underestimate the burden of RSV illness, and therefore altering the inclusion criteria to include either fever and/or cough may be more accurate. The differences in diagnostic accuracy of the SARI criteria by age is the most significant finding of this study. The SARI criteria performed poorly with regards to sensitivity for the detection of any respiratory virus in children under three months. Only 22.4% of children in this age group with a respiratory virus were captured by the case definition. This increased to 64.3% in children aged 6-23 months. Conversely, the criteria are very specific in the youngest age group for detecting any respiratory virus compared to the oldest age group (90.6% vs. 64.3%).",

Specifically, the lower rates of fever-and to a lesser extent, cough-in patients <3 months who are respiratory virus-positive account for the poor sensitivity of the SARI criteria in this age group. Only 44.4% of the virus-positive patients <3 months had a reported or measured fever, compared to 75.5% of their 6-23 months counterparts. Consistent with what has been found in previous studies [25] , removing fever from the SARI criteria greatly increased the sensitivity of detecting any respiratory virus in children <3 months, particularly for RSV, which then increased by 65.3% [18] . Notably, both the PPV and NPV for detecting RSV also increased with this change. In general, for this youngest age group, removing fever as a criterion increases sensitivity more than it decreases specificity for each virus tested, and it results in minimal changes to PPV and NPV. This result would seem to advise caution when mandating that fever must be included as a criterion for this age group.",

Our study also has a number of limitations. It only includes hospitalized children <2 years who had ARI symptoms from one large hospital in Amman, Jordan. This limits its generalizability to other locations, or to study populations that include all hospitalized patients. Additionally, the 2011 SARI criteria were developed during our study period.

However, our study found that more than half of the RVI cases would have been missed using the SARI criteria. Therefore, it is critical to know how well these criteria perform in different patient populations and geographic settings. Our study shows that use of the criteria in children <3 months significantly underestimates the burden of disease for RSV, flu, and other viruses. Therefore, removing fever as a mandatory criterion in this age group, particularly for RSV, would greatly increase sensitivity with an acceptable decrease in specificity. Overall, more studies need to be conducted in the Middle East to gather more information on this finding; however, it is advisable that policymakers are cautious when using the SARI criteria. ",
