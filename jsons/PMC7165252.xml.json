It has extremely high infectivity, a short doubling time, a basic reproduction number of 2.2, and a high risk of nosocomial infection. There have been 81,134 confirmed cases in China, with 67,799 confirmed cases in Hubei province, including 50,004 cases in Wuhan, with 2480 deaths.",

In the specific implementation process, a journal was set up, and the disinfection status was strictly registered and reported by taking photographs every day. The test was scored out of 100 points. The staff had to get a full score, including 40 points for personal protection. Personal protection included seven steps: hand washing (alcohol disinfection), standard wearing of masks and caps, putting on and removing protective clothing (isolation gear), wearing of gloves and goggles, familiarity with the three areas (sterile area, contaminated area, and semi-contaminated area) and two pathways (medical personnel pathway and patient pathway), and CT diagnosis procedures.

So far, our hospital has received 176 pregnant women and 21 children, all of whom underwent CT examination and nucleic acid amplification test by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) to detect SARS-CoV-2 in the hospital. These special patients, in addition to needing our attention for infection prevention and examination bed disinfection, need careful attention to protect them from radiation. For the children who do not cooperate with the examination, family members are required to be present at the examination. These family members also need to receive infection protection and radiation protection. The emergency response budget should also provide for patients with no ability to pay or patients seeking medical treatment from other places. We also provide a pathway to pay fee conveniently as well as free examination services.",
