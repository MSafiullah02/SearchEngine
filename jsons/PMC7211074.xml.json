An assessment of the entire activity and potential outcomes (taking into account avoiding the compromising of the safety of enrolled patients already undergoing treatment and data validity) must be performed before taking the decision to close a centre or the entire trial study. The possibility of temporary suspension of the protocol can be considered in the event of closure due to blocking of activities or new allocation of a trial centre for patients with COVID-19. The investigator responsible for the centre concerned must carefully evaluate whether the trial staff is able to guarantee the continuity of the experimentation. The transfer of patients undergoing active treatment to the nearest trial centre can be envisaged, without prejudice to: (A) the exchange of information between the investigators of the centres involved and (B) the sharing of clinical information and study material. The sponsor must notify the ethical committees of reference of a substantial amendment for immediate implementation.",

In the event that the patient cannot go to the centre (eg, for a patient outside the region; excessive danger of contagion at the centre), it is possible to organise an oral drug shipment from the hospital pharmacy to the patient\u2019s home; the entire route (courier, modality) must be managed by the sponsor, except for the availability of personnel at the centre who organise the shipment.

It is advisable to check the quantities of experimental drugs present at the pharmacia of the trial centres, possibly agreeing with the pharmacy on a resupply able to guarantee the presence of a sufficient stock to cover the expected use possibly over the next 2 months.",
