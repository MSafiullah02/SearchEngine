This pandemic is already causing widespread suffering among patients and their families due to symptom burden (most commonly from dyspnea and fatigue) (3) , and fear and anxiety (present in any serious illness, but exacerbated by the lack of information and understanding about a novel disease). If the health system's capacity is surpassed, this suffering may also be compounded by the existential distress caused by lack of availability of medical services and life-saving equipment. While palliative care specialists are trained to address these sources of physical and psychological suffering -and are thus well-equipped as individual clinicians to meet the demands of the COVID-19 crisis -the national palliative care workforce was insufficiently sized to meet the needs of patients with serious illness even before this crisis emerged (4).",

While crisis conditions are unlikely to be conducive to comprehensive continuing education, palliative care teams working in hard-hit regions of the country can fill a critical role by disseminating practical symptom management protocols to clinicians. In regions that are preparing for but not yet in crisis mode, palliative care teams have an important role to play by facilitating systematic approaches to symptom management and patient/family communication with training specific to COVID-19 within their organizations. The authors of this paper -along with other educators across the country -have developed publicly available rapid-response education and tools specific to clinical scenarios facing health care professionals responding to COVID-19.",

The protocols account for care provided in all settings including oral, sublingual (SL), intravenous (IV), and subcutaneous (SQ) medication administration. Importantly, these tools are specific to COVID-19. They will be continuously updated as the global medical community learns more about the pathophysiology of the virus (for example, recent evidence suggesting that NSAIDs are contraindicated for patients with COVID-19) (8) , as well as to account for potential drug shortages and common formulary restrictions.

Symptom and communication tools may be added to COVID-specific internal toolkits (e.g. on an intranet site or via email dissemination), and quickreference materials may be printed and made available as pocket cards. These workforce training and technical assistance materials should be accompanied by guidance or criteria for allocation of the scarce resource that is the specialty-level palliative care team. Palliative care allocation should include clinical scenarios when it is appropriate to request a face-to-face ot telemedicine consult from the specialty palliative care team (including phone numbers and other relevant contact information).",
