            "text": "Opinion formation and disease spreading are among the most studied dynamical processes on complex networks. In real societies, it is expected that these two processes depend on and affect each other. However, little is known about the effects of opinion dynamics over disease dynamics and vice versa, since most studies treat them separately. In this work we study the dynamics of the voter model for opinion formation intertwined with that of the contact process for disease spreading, in a population of agents that interact via two types of connections, social and contact. These two interacting dynamics take place on two layers of networks, coupled through a fraction q of links present in both networks. The probability that an agent updates its state depends on both the opinion and disease states of the interacting partner. We find that the opinion dynamics has striking consequences on the statistical properties of disease spreading. The most important is that the smooth (continuous) transition from a healthy to an endemic phase observed in the contact process, as the infection probability increases beyond a threshold, becomes abrupt (discontinuous) in the two-layer system. Therefore, disregarding the effects of social dynamics on epidemics propagation may lead to a misestimation of the real magnitude of the spreading. Also, an endemic-healthy discontinuous transition is found when the coupling q overcomes a threshold value. Furthermore, we show that the disease dynamics delays the opinion consensus, leading to a consensus time that varies nonmonotonically with q in a large range of the model's parameters. A mean-field approach reveals that the coupled dynamics of opinions and disease can be approximately described by the dynamics of the voter model decoupled from that of the contact process, with effective probabilities of opinion and disease transmission.",

The behavior of each of these two processes has been explored independently of one another for the last decades, and many of their propagation properties on diverse complex topologies are well established already (see [2] and [3] for recent reviews on opinion formation and epidemic spreading, respectively). However, less attention has been paid to a possible case scenario where the dynamics of opinions interact with that of the disease spreading. In fact, it is hardly expected that these two dynamics are isolated in real societies but rather depend on and affect each other, since they both run at the same time on the same population: an individual can transmit a disease to a colleague while having a conversation and exchanging ideas or opinions on a given topic. Then, the following questions arise: Does the dynamics of opinion formation have an impact on the extent and prevalence of the epidemic? Does the disease spread facilitate the ultimate dominance of one opinion, or does it rather hinder the consensus of opinions?",

            "text": "In an attempt to explore these questions, we study in this article how opinion formation and disease spreading processes affect each other, using two simple models as a proxy of each process: the voter model (VM) and the contact process (CP). The VM was originally introduced as the simplest system of interacting particles that can be exactly solvable in any dimension [4] [5] [6] , and is one of the most studied models for opinion consensus. In this model, individuals can take one of * Corresponding author: fede.vazmin@gmail.com two possible positions or opinions on a given issue, and are allowed to update them by adopting the opinion of a randomly chosen neighbor. The CP, on its part, has been extensively studied to explore the spread of an infection in a system of interacting agents [7] , where infected agents can transmit the infection to susceptible neighbors in a lattice [8] or a complex network [9] , and they can also recover at a given rate. The CP exhibits a continuous transition from a healthy to an endemic phase when the infection rate exceeds a threshold value. To model the interaction between the two dynamics we implement the framework of multilayer complex networks [10] [11] [12] that consists of a set of complex networks interrelated with one another, which allows us to study systems composed by many interdependent processes. In the present study we consider that the opinion dynamics takes place on a network of social relations-formed by individuals that influence each other on a social issue, while the disease spreads on a network of physical contacts-formed by people having daily face-to-face contacts. All individuals are in both layers of networks, but the pattern of connections between them may be different in each layer. The overlap of connections is taken as a measure of the coupling between the two networks. The bilayer network system described above may represent a simple case scenario where the social network supports a process that involves peer pressure, like the adoption of new behaviors or opinions, while the contact network supports the spreading of a contagious viral infection like flu, which is transmitted by proximity or direct contact between individuals. The different combinations of connections may correspond to different types of relationships between two individuals. For instance, two close friends can have both a contact and social tie, as they can see each other at work every day and also interchange ideas on a political issue. But it can also happen that individuals are connected by only one type of tie, e.g., two colleagues having a contact or proximity relation because they work in the same place but never talk about politics, or two friends that never meet but discuss political ideas by electronic means (phone, Facebook, Twitter, email, etc).",

The interplay between opinion formation and decision making processes was studied in [15] using two interconnected networks. Another work considered two political parties (two interacting networks) that compete for votes in a political election [16] . In a recent article [17] , the authors studied the dynamics of the voter model on bilayer networks with coevolving connections, while in [18] the same authors explored whether it is appropriate to reduce the dynamics of the voter model from a two-layer multiplex network to a single layer. A recent work [20] considers a complex threshold dynamics that competes with a simple susceptible-infected-susceptible dynamics on two interconnected networks.

The nature of the healthy-endemic transition observed in the CP, as the infection probability increases, is largely modified by the dynamics of the VM. The transition changes from continuous to discontinuous when the disease and opinions are coupled, showing a jump in the disease prevalence at the transition point, where the magnitude of the jump increases with the coupling. Also, a discontinuous transition from an endemic to a healthy phase is found when the coupling overtakes a threshold value. In addition, we find that the dynamics of the CP has important consequences on the dynamical properties of the VM. The diffusion of opinions is slowed down by the disease in a nontrivial manner as the coupling increases. This leads to consensus times that vary either monotonically or nonmonotonically with the coupling, for a large range of the model's parameters. We develop a mean-field approach to study the time evolution of macroscopic quantities, which takes into account state correlations between neighbors in the same network (pair approximation). This approach reveals that the interdependent system of opinions and disease can be thought of as two independent systems, with external parameters that depend on the coupling. Specifically, the opinion dynamics can be approximated as the dynamics of the VM on an isolated network, with an effective probability of opinion transmission that decreases with the coupling and the prevalence. Analogously, the disease spreading is approximately described by the CP dynamics on an isolated network, with an effective infection probability that decreases with the coupling and the fraction of neighbors with different opinions.",

On the one hand, we assume that each individual is less influenced by its partner when she/he is sick, because the sick partner normally stays at home or at hospitals, reducing physical contacts between them. This makes social relations (and the interchange of opinions) less likely when at least one of the two individuals is sick. Thus, we consider that a social relation takes place with probability 1.0 if both social neighbors are healthy, and with a reduced probability p o 1.0 when one or both are sick. In case they have a social contact but not a physical contact (they do not see each other but discuss ideas by electronic means), the disease state is not supposed to affect the probability of social interactions between them. Therefore, the social interaction probability is not reduced by the disease and, for simplicity, is set to 1.0 as in the case of healthy neighbors.",

This is a consequence of a sociological mechanism called homophily [21] [22] [23] , i.e., the tendency for individuals to interact with similar others. The effects of homophily in the propagation of cultural attributes in a society were studied by Alxerod using an agent-based model [21] , in which the probability that two neighboring agents interact is proportional to their cultural similarity (the number of shared attributes). Following this idea, we assume that the contact probability between the neighbors when they have the same opinion is higher than that when they have different opinions. Therefore, we set to 1.0 the contact probability of same-opinion neighbors and denote by p d 1.0 the contact probability between opposite-opinion neighbors. Once they have a physical contact the infection is transmitted with probability \u03b2, leading to effective infection probabilities \u03b2 and \u03b2 p d \u03b2 in each respective case. In a situation where there is a contact but not a social connection between two neighbors (they see each other but they do not talk about politics), opinions are not expected to affect (neither increase or decrease) the contact probability. Therefore, this can be considered as an intermediate situation respect to the two cases mentioned above, where the contact probability should be smaller than 1.0 but larger than p d , leading to an infection probability between \u03b2 and \u03b2 p d . However, for simplicity we assume that the contact probability in the absence of a social relation is the same as that in homophilic relations (1.0), and thus the infection probability takes the value \u03b2. This approximation and the one mentioned above for the social Disease update. An infected node i recovers with probability 1 \u2212 \u03b2 or transmits the disease to a susceptible neighbor j with probability \u03b2 when both nodes are only connected by a contact link, or when they are connected by both types of links and they share the same opinion. In the case in which they hold opposite opinions the transmission happens with probability \u03b2 p d \u03b2.",

The endemic phase is active, where each node undergoes an infected-susceptible-infected cycle and the total number of infected nodes fluctuates around a stationary value. The healthy-endemic transition is continuous, and the critical value \u03b2 c depends on the topological properties of the network [9] . For its part, the VM has been extensively used to explore opinion consensus on different network topologies [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] . It was found that the diffusion properties of opinions depend on the heterogeneity of the network. This is reflected in the mean consensus time, which is proportional to the ratio \u03bc 2 /\u03bc 2 [28, 29] , where \u03bc and \u03bc 2 are the first and second moments of the network's degree distribution.",

For this first set of simulations we used p o = p d = 0, which corresponds to the extreme case scenario where opinions cannot be transmitted across contact neighbors (nodes connected by a contact link) that are infected, and infections are not allowed between social neighbors (nodes connected by a social link) with different opinions. Different curves correspond to different values of the coupling parameter q and network size N, as indicated in the legend. We observe that, for q = 0.4 (diamonds) and q = 0.7 (triangles), \u03c1 stat 1 decreases smoothly with \u03b2 until a point \u03b2 c q that depends on q, where it suddenly decays to a value close to zero.

We note that this peculiar nonmonotonic temporal behavior is known to induce discontinuous transitions in social models with multiple states and constraints, like the Axelrod model (see for instance [23, 30] ).",

When \u03c1 +\u2212 becomes zero [panel (b)] only ++ or \u2212\u2212 links remain and, therefore, the disease dynamics behaves as the one of the standard CP with infection probability \u03b2 = 0.6 across all links, reaching the stationary value \u03c1 stat 1 (q = 0,\u03b2 = 0.6) 0.255. We can say that after time T the disease dynamics uncouples from the opinion dynamics. Indeed, panel (b) also shows \u03c1 1 in a single realization on an isolated network (q = 0) with \u03b2 = 0.6, where we observe a very quick decay to a stationary value that overlaps with the one for the coupled case q = 0.4. Therefore, as we can see in In Sec. IV we develop a MF approach that allows us to estimate the stationary fraction of infected nodes \u03c1 1 [see Eq. (11) ]. The theoretical approximation from Eq. (11), shown as a dashed curve in each panel of Fig. 5 , describes a continuous transition with \u03b2, in contrast with the discontinuity found in numerical simulations (solid symbols). This is because the MF approach assumes an infinitely large system (N = \u221e)",

Fluctuations in finite networks ultimately drive the system to an absorbing state in which all nodes are susceptible (\u03c1 1 = 0) and have either opinion + or \u2212 (\u03c1 +\u2212 = 0), i.e., an opinion consensus on a completely healthy population. Therefore, fluctuations play a fundamental role in the discontinuous nature of the transition because, as previously discussed, the stationary value of \u03c1 1 in a single realization depends on whether \u03c1 +\u2212 becomes zero before \u03c1 1 does. To gain a better understanding of the results obtained from the MF theory we run simulations on very large networks. Open circles in Fig. 4 correspond to single realizations on a network of N = 10 6 nodes, for the same values of \u03b2 as for networks with N = 10 4 nodes (solid lines). We observe that curves for N = 10 6 decay monotonically with time to a stationary value denoted by \u03c1 stat 1,\u221e (only shown for \u03b2 = 0.6), which agrees with the minimum of the nonmonotonic curves for N = 10 4 . We need to note that these states are not truly stationary, in the sense that \u03c1 1 exhibits a very long plateau (outside the shown scale) but eventually increases and reaches the same stationary value \u03c1 stat 1 of the curves for N = 10 4 . We have checked that the length of the plateau diverges with N , and thus is infinitely large when N = \u221e. Therefore, we take \u03c1 stat 1,\u221e as the stationary value when N = \u221e. In Fig. 5 we observe that the numerical values \u03c1 stat 1,\u221e (open symbols) agree reasonably well with the theoretical approximation from Eq. (11) (dashed curves) for the three values of q, even though the agreement worsens as q gets larger. We also see that \u03c1 stat 1,\u221e decays continuously as \u03b2 decreases and becomes zero at the same value \u03b2 c q of the transition in the thermodynamic limit corresponding to \u03c1 stat 1 (filled symbols).

The only difference with this previous studied case is that, as \u03b2 is fixed, the stationary value of \u03c1 1 in single realizations does not change with q, but is either \u03c1 stat 1 = 0 or \u03c1 stat 1 0.26, in agreement with the binomial distribution. The former situation happens in realizations where \u03c1 1 hits zero before \u03c1 +\u2212 does, while the later corresponds to realizations where \u03c1 +\u2212 becomes zero and thus the two dynamics get uncoupled, after which \u03c1 1 reaches a stationary value similar to 0.26 corresponding to q = 0. Figure 6 (a) shows that the transition with q is continuous in an infinitely large system (squares). One can also check that the stationary value \u03c1 stat 1 for a given q in an infinite system agrees with the minimum of the corresponding \u03c1 1 vs. time curve of Fig. 6 (b).

As the transmission of opinions between neighboring nodes is more difficult when at least one of them is sick, we are particularly interested in studying to what extent the disease slows down opinion diffusion over the social network, and how that depends on q, \u03b2, p o , and p d . A way to quantify this is by looking at the time to reach opinion consensus. In Fig. 8 we show how the mean consensus time \u03c4 varies with the coupling q, for infection probability \u03b2 = 0.6 and various values of p o and p d . For a better comparison with the voter model on an isolated network, \u03c4 is normalized by the mean consensus time \u03c4 0 when the networks are uncoupled (q = 0). Symbols correspond to MC simulations, while solid lines are the analytical approximations from Eq. (17) obtained in Sec. IV. Here we present results for \u03b2 above the critical point of an isolated network \u03b2 c 0 0.53 because for \u03b2 < \u03b2 c 0 the effects of disease on consensus times are negligible. This happens because for \u03b2 < \u03b2 c 0 and any value of q the disease quickly disappears on the contact network and, as all nodes are susceptible, the dynamics of opinions is decoupled from the disease dynamics, reaching consensus in a time very similar to the one in the uncoupled case (\u03c4 \u03c4 0 ).",

This is a consequence of the competition between two different mechanisms that directly affect opinion transmission. One is the link overlap between the two networks that is proportional to q, and the other is the disease prevalence that decreases with q, as we explain below. The opinion transmission through a social link that overlaps with a contact link is slowed down when at least one of the two nodes is infected and p o < 1. Therefore, the overall delay in opinion transmission caused by the total overlap tends to increase with q, and so does \u03c4 . This effect explains the initial monotonic increase of \u03c4 as q increases from 0, in all curves. However, as q becomes larger a second effect becomes important: the fraction of infected nodes decreases with q [see inset of Fig. 8(a) ], due to the coupling with the opinion dynamics that reduces the effective infection probability as discussed in Sec. III A. Then, lower disease prevalence translates into fewer social links affected by the disease and, therefore, into a smaller opinion delay. This effect tends to reduce \u03c4 with q.",

For instance, in Fig. 8 (a) we observe that the three curves for p o = 0.0 have a quite different behavior. For p d = 1.0 the effect of prevalence does not vary with q, given that \u03c1 stat 1 is independent of q [inset of Fig. 8(a) ]. Then, \u03c4 increases monotonically with q as the overlap increases. For p d = 0.5 the prevalence effect increases with q (\u03c1 stat 1 decreases), becoming dominant for q above 0.8 when \u03c4 decays, and leading to a nonmonotonic behavior of \u03c4 (q). Finally, for p 0 = 0.0 we observe a nonmonotonicity similar than that of the p d = 0.5 curve, but with the addition that \u03c4 becomes very similar to \u03c4 0 for all values of q > 0.6. This is because \u03c1 stat 1 becomes zero above q 0.583 and thus the disease has no effect on opinions, leading to consensus times similar to the ones measured in isolated networks. These behaviors for the p o = 0.0 case are also observed for other values of p o , as we show in Fig. 8(b) for p o = 0.5. We see that the shape of the curves for p d = 0.0, 0.5, and 1.0 are analogous to the ones of Fig. 8(a) for the corresponding values of p d .

Panels (a) and (b) correspond to couplings q = 0.5 and q = 1.0, respectively. To analyze these plots we recall that, as explained above, consensus times increase with the level of disease prevalence in the contact network, given that a larger disease prevalence translates into a larger delay in opinion propagation and in the subsequent consensus. A first simple observation is that \u03c4 increases with \u03b2 and also with p d , as we expect from the fact that a larger value of \u03b2 and p d implies a larger disease prevalence. A second observation is that \u03c4 decreases with the likelihood of opinion transmission p o , as explained before when we compared \u03c4 in Fig. 8 (a) with Fig. 8(b) . A third observation is that \u03c4 approaches a value independent of p d when \u03b2 goes to 1.0. This is because for \u03b2 = 1.0 (recovery probability equals zero) and a fixed value of q and p o , all nodes are infected at the stationary state, independently of the value of p d , and thus consensus times are the same for all p d . As we see in Fig. 9(b) , the case q = 1 and p o = 0 is special because \u03c4 diverges as \u03b2 approaches 1.0. This happens because in this situation the transmission of opinions is only possible between connected nodes that are both susceptible, which vanish in the \u03b2 \u2192 1.0 limit, leading to divergent consensus times. A rough estimation of how \u03c4 scales with \u03b2 can be obtained by assuming that \u03c4 is proportional to the time scale associated with the opinion transmission across two given neighboring nodes in the social network, i and j , with opinions + and \u2212, respectively. As q = 1, i and j are also neighbors in the contact network. Starting from a situation where i and j are infected for high \u03b2, the opinion transmission happens after both nodes recover. Therefore, \u03c4 is determined by the time it takes the 1-1 contact link to become a 0-0 link, which scales as (1 \u2212 \u03b2) \u22122 . In Sec. IV we derived a more accurate expression for \u03c4 that exhibits this quadratic divergence in the \u03b2 \u2192 1 limit, shown in the inset of Fig. 9 (b) by solid lines.",

We note that Eqs. (3) and Eqs. (5) are coupled through the prefactors \u03c9 and \u03b3 , which depend on the coupling q and describe the opinion and disease dynamics, respectively. The interested reader can find in the appendices the details of the derivation of these equations. For the sake of simplicity, we assumed in the derivation that all nodes have the same number of neighbors k = \u03bc chosen at random, which is equivalent to assuming that networks are degree-regular random graphs. However, we expect this approximation to work well in networks with homogeneous degree distributions like the ER networks we used in the MC simulations. We also implemented a homogeneous pair approximation [29] that takes into account correlations between the state of neighboring nodes within the same layer (intralayer pair approximation), but neglects correlations between opinion and disease states of both layers (interlayer annealing approximation). That is, we considered that the opinion state of each node is uncorrelated with its own disease state and with its neighbors' disease states and, conversely, that its disease state is uncorrelated with its own and its neighbors' opinion states. It is instructive to analyze the structure of Eqs. (3) and (5) . Equations (3) describe the evolution of opinions on the social layer. From Eq. (3a) we see that the fraction of + nodes is conserved over time: \u03c1 + (t) = \u03c1 + (t = 0) for all t 0. This behavior is reminiscent of that of the VM on isolated topologies, where opinion densities are conserved at each time step. It seems that the disease dynamics is not able to break the intrinsic symmetry of opinion states induced by the voter dynamics. Equation (3b) for the evolution of \u03c1 +\u2212 has an extra prefactor \u03c9 compared to the corresponding equation for the VM on isolated networks [29] , which reveals that the disease affects the dynamics of opinions through its prevalence level, expressed by \u03c1 1 and \u03c1 10 [see Eq. (4)]. As discussed in Appendix A, \u03c9 can be interpreted as the \"effective probability\" that a node i adopts the opinion of a chosen social neighbor j with opposite opinion, which depends on the disease state of both i and j . Within a MF approach, we can assume that the probability that i copies j 's opinion depends on the disease state of an \"average pair\" of contact neighbors, and that this probability is the same for all social neighbors. In these terms, \u03c9 becomes the average copying probability over the entire social network. Indeed, we can check that the average value of \u03c9 over the three possible connection and disease state configurations of a contact pair,",

A typical evolution of \u03c1 +\u2212 towards the absorbing state can be seen in Fig. 4(b) for q = 0.4 on networks with N = 10 4 nodes. That is, consensus is eventually achieved in finite systems due to the stochastic nature of the opinion dynamics, which leads the social network to a state where all nodes share the same opinion. In a single opinion update \u03c1 + may increase or decrease by 1/N with the same probability \u03c9\u03c1 +\u2212 /2, calculated as the probability \u03c1 +\u2212 /2 that a node and an opposite-opinion neighbor are selected at random, times the probability \u03c9 of opinion adoption. Therefore, the stochastic dynamics of the VM can be studied by mapping \u03c1 + into the position of a symmetric one-dimensional random walker on the interval [0,1], with a jumping probability proportional to \u03c9\u03c1 +\u2212 stat /2 and a step length of 1/N. Starting from a symmetric configuration with N/2 nodes with + opinion [\u03c1 + (0) = 1/2], the walker reaches either absorbing point \u03c1 + = 1 or \u03c1 + = 0 in an average number of steps that scales as N 2 . Then, given that the walker makes a single step in an average number of attempts that scales as 1/\u03c9\u03c1 +\u2212 stat , and that the time increases by 1/N in each attempt, we find that the mean consensus time scales as",

We observe that the theoretical values of \u03c4/\u03c4 0 are smaller than those obtained from numerical simulations (symbols) for all combinations of p o and p d shown. A possible explanation of these discrepancies can be given by analyzing how correlations affect the estimated number of different types of connected nodes, as we have done in Sec. IV A for disease prevalence. If we take the p 0 = 0 case, we see that an opinion change due to an interaction between two social and contact neighbors happens only if both nodes are susceptible, that is, when they have states [ + 0 ] and [ \u2212 0 ]. Then, as the theory assumes that +\u2212 social links and 00 contact links are uncorrelated (Appendix A), the estimated probability of finding a [ +\u2212 0 0 ] pair is larger than that in simulations, given that +\u2212 social links are expected to be negatively correlated with 00 contact links. This negative correlation is due to the fact that susceptible neighbors tend to align their opinions and, therefore, they are more likely to be in the same opinion state at a given time. This leads to an overestimation of the number of [ +\u2212 0 0 ] pairs and, therefore, to a larger rate of opinion transmission. This has the overall effect of speeding up consensus, decreasing the theoretically estimated mean time to reach consensus with respect to the mean consensus time measured in simulations, as we see in Fig. 8 .",

For low values of p d , there is a transition to the healthy phase when q overcomes a value q c < 1 given by Eq. (12) and, therefore, \u03c4 = \u03c4 0 for all q > q c [see p d = 0 curves in the main plot and the inset of Fig. 8(a) ]. As a consequence, \u03c4/\u03c4 0 exhibits a nonmonotonic behavior with q, as we described in Sec. III B. For higher values of p d , the transition to the healthy phase does not happen for the physical values q 1 used in the model's simulations, given that q c > 1 from Eq. (12) . In this case, \u03c4 may either increase monotonically with q for large p d values (see p d = 1.0 curves), or have a maximum at some intermediate value for medium p d values (see p d = 0.5 curves). As explained in Sec. III B, the nonmonotonicity is a consequence of the competition between the level of link overlap among the two layers-which increases with q-and the disease prevalence-which decreases with q. This competition can be seen quantitatively in Eq. (16) for \u03c9, which has three factors that depend on q and affect \u03c4 . Besides the factor proportional to q, the factor 1/\u03b3 also increases with q, as seen from Eq. (9) . But these two factors are balanced by \u03c1 stat 1 , which decreases with q. An interesting case is the one for full coupling q = 1.0 and p o = 0, because \u03c4 from Eq. (17) diverges as \u03b2 approaches 1.0. This happens in the model because when \u03b2 = 1.0, once a node becomes infected it remains infected forever. Then, once all nodes become infected the opinion dynamics stops, as infected neighboring nodes cannot interchange opinions, and thus the social layer freezes in a mixed state of + and \u2212 opinions and consensus is never achieved.

The magnitude of the change in the disease prevalence at the transition point \u03b2 c increases with q.

For example, one can simulate a population with initial polarized opinions based on the disease, by correlating the opinion of each node with its disease state (for instance by infecting all nodes with \u2212 opinion and leaving all + opinion nodes in the healthy state). Finally, it would be interesting to study the behavior of the present model under different update rules. For instance, we have checked a simple rule in which the connection condition-connected or disconnected-between two nodes in one layer is not taken into account for the update in the other layer. This is an ongoing work with some preliminary results that suggest that the critical behavior of this new model is quite different from that of the original model.",

(A2) and (A3), respectively, due to the symmetry between + and \u2212 opinion states. We notice that disease states remain the same after the interactions, as only a change in the social layer can lead to a change in \u03c1 + . The first term in Eq. (A2) represents the average change in \u03c1 + due to interactions in which a node i in state [ \u2212 0 ] copies the opinion of one its social neighbors j in state [ + 0 ], changing the state of i to [ + 0 ]. This interaction is schematically represented by the symbol [ \u2212+ 0 0 ], where the horizontal line over the opinion symbols describes a social link between i and j . In the same way, the symbol [ \u2212+ 0 0 ] represents an interaction between a [ \u2212 0 ] node and a neighboring [ + 0 ] node connected by both a social and a contact link that are indicated by horizontal lines on top of the respective symbols. The second, third and fourth terms in Eq. (A2) describe, respectively, the transitions due to an interaction of node i with a [ + 0 ] social/contact neighbor, a [ + 1 ] social neighbor, and a [ + 1 ] social/contact neighbor. We now illustrate how to build an approximate expression for each term of Eq. (A2) for \u03c1 + | \u2212 0 \u2192 + 0 . For the sake of simplicity, we assume that all nodes have the same number of neighbors k = \u03bc chosen at random, which is equivalent to assuming that networks are degree-regular random graphs. However, we expect this approximation to work well in networks with homogeneous degree distributions like ER networks. The first term in Eq. (A2) can be written as ",
