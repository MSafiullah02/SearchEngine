The main source or vehicle of H1N1 transmission as recognized by them were contact with people infected with H1N1 (86%), contaminated fomites (72%) and air (65%). Appreciable level of knowledge about measures to avoid H1N1 infection were noted as described by maintenance of hand hygiene (91%), wearing a mask (76%), cough/sneeze etiquette (76%), staying away from sick people (65%), using hand sanitizer (63%), avoiding crowds/public gatherings (62%) and taking H1N1 vaccine (58%).",

Rhinoviruses were more prevalent after the Hajj (11.7%) than before (7.5%). None of the healthcare workers tested positive for any influenza virus, including the H1N1 2009 pandemic strain. This is explained by the fact that among more than two million pilgrims in 2009, the Ministry of Health reported only 100 cases of H1N1 and 5 deaths.17 The high case-fatality ratio may be because pilgrims were committed to completing Hajj and delayed seeking medical care until their condition had worsened.17, 18 Since the overall number of cases among pilgrims was low, therefore, the chances of transmitting it to healthcare workers were very small.",
