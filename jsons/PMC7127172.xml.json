            "text": "Odontoclastic resorptive lesions (RL) are a common finding in cats. Depending on inclusion criteria and methods of diagnosis, 20\u201375% of cats have a least one RL (Reiter and Mendoza, 2002). The lesions often develop at the gingival margin but may be masked by overlaying gingival tissue. RL may also occur on the tooth root without affecting the crown (Gorrel and Larsson, 2002). Symptoms include swelling and bleeding of gingival tissue, pain, ptyalism, reluctance to drink/eat, and anorexia. Two types of RL have been suggested in cats; type I, characterized by inflammatory changes, and type II, characterized by replacement resorption without inflammatory changes (DuPont and DeBowes, 2002). Both can occur simultaneously and can even affect the same tooth concomitantly. There is currently no consensus on whether type I and type II are two different diseases or just different stages of the same disease. Therefore, the official classification as followed by the American Veterinary Dental College, classifies RL only to the severity of the lesion, without distinguishing between type I and type II (www.avdc.org).",

While most mammals depend on exposure to sunlight for their vitamin D requirements (Holick et al., 2007), cats are dependent on their diet to meet their vitamin D requirements because they are unable to synthesize sufficient 7-dehydrocholesterol, probably due to high activity of 7-dehydrocholesterol-\u03947-reductase (How et al., 1994, Morris, 1999).",

            "text": "Clinically, most cats with RL show signs of inflammation. Cytokines produced during inflammation can stimulate or inhibit osteoclast activity, directly, or through the receptor activator of nuclear factor-kappaB (RANK)/receptor activator of nuclear factor-kappaB ligand (RANKL) pathway (Lindskog et al., 2007). Some pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, and TNF-\u03b1, stimulate osteoclastogenesis (Takeichi et al., 1996, Baker, 2000), whereas others, such as IFN-\u03b3, inhibit osteoclastogenesis (Gowen et al., 1986). IL-10, an anti-inflammatory cytokine, also inhibits osteoclastogenesis (Baker, 2000, Lindskog et al., 2007). 1,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25(OH)2D) stimulates osteoclastogenesis by up-regulating the expression of RANKL, mediated via the nuclear vitamin D receptor (nVDR) (Baker, 2000, Kitazawa et al., 2003, Zhang et al., 2004). RANKL is expressed in bone and dental cells (Rani and MacDougall, 2000, Fukushima et al., 2003). Dentin resorbing odontoclasts originate from the same stem cells as osteoclasts (Okuda and Harvey, 1992, Arana-Chavez and Bradaschia-Correa, 2009) and it is assumed that osteoclast properties and characteristics can be extrapolated to odontoclasts.",

From each total RNA sample 250 ng RNA was used to synthesize cDNA using the i-script cDNA synthesis kit (Bio-Rad, Veenendaal, The Netherlands) according to standard operation protocols. After synthesis a standard sample was prepared by pooling 10 \u03bcl of each sample, which was used to make a 4-fold dilution series to calculate PCR efficiency.",

Pathological alveolar bone destruction is seen in periodontitis due to elevated osteoclastic activity (Takayanagi, 2005). Bone loss was observed in cats that are affected by periodontitis, which was also seen in cats with RL in this study. The anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 inhibits osteoclastogenesis by down-regulating the expression of the pro-inflammatory and osteoclast-stimulating cytokines, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, and TNF-\u03b1 (Baker, 2000), and RANKL (Liu et al., 2006). The inflammatory cytokine IFN-\u03b3 also inhibits osteoclastogenesis by down-regulation of RANKL and the inflammatory cytokines IL-1\u03b2 and TNF-\u03b1 (Gowen et al., 1986, Takayanagi et al., 2000). Therefore both IL-10 and IFN-\u03b3 might be involved in the inhibition of alveolar bone resorption (Takayanagi et al., 2000, Liu et al., 2006). Our findings are consistent with those of other studies reporting elevated mRNA levels for the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1\u03b2 and IL-6 in teeth affected by RL (DeLaurier et al., 2002) and elevated levels of RNA for the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and IFN-\u03b3 and anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 in cats with chronic stomatitis (Harley et al., 1999). In humans with periodontitis, the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1\u03b2, IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1 are up-regulated and promote the resorptive process (Baker, 2000). It is beyond the scope of this study to discuss osteoimmunology further, but it may be obvious that the cytokines we studied do have complex actions on the differentiation and activity of osteoclasts and therefore most likely also on the odontoclasts that resorb dental tissues.",

Studies on the possible role of vitamin D in the aetiology of RL have concentrated on the plasma levels of vitamin D metabolites, and not on the nuclear receptor levels (Reiter and Mendoza, 2002, Reiter et al., 2005). The finding that nVDR is increased in teeth affected by RL suggests that 1,25(OH)2D might play a role in the pathological tooth resorption in cats. The active metabolite 1,25(OH)2D is produced in the kidney through hydroxylation of 25(OH)D by 1\u03b1-hydroxylase (CYP27B1) or locally by cells that express CYP27B1 (Peterlik and Cross, 2005). On a para-/auto-crine level 1,25(OH)2D production by macrophages and endothelial cells is increased by inflammatory cytokines (Zehnder et al., 2002, Overbergh et al., 2000). We propose that, in periodontitis, inflammatory cytokines induce either homologous and/or heterologous up-regulation of the expression of nVDR. Nuclear VDR mRNA levels were measured as a first step to determine the possible role of 1,25(OH)2D in RL. The possible causative relationship between vitamin D and RL needs further investigation with the aid of in vivo and in vitro mechanistical studies.",

It is possible that by the time the cats were referred, active resorption had already occurred (Okuda and Harvey, 1992). This is consistent with earlier findings, where differences in levels for RANKL and OPG were not significant in feline teeth with or without RL (DeLaurier et al., 2002). We would expect RANKL to be up-regulated in a very early resorptive lesion, but it is virtually impossible to obtain representative samples from clinical patients to test this because symptoms from these early lesions (if present) may not be noticed by owners, are not clinically visible, and are difficult to detect on dental radiographs. It is possible that RANKL and OPG activity was in an equilibrium because IFN-\u03b3 down-regulates RANKL (Takayanagi et al., 2000), whereas 1,25(OH)2D up-regulates RANKL (Baker, 2000, Kitazawa et al., 2003, Zhang et al., 2004) and down-regulates OPG (Kondo et al., 2004).",

Cats with inflammatory changes of gingival tissues produce more stimulatory regulators of osteoclastogenesis and up-regulate at least on a para/auto-crine level the nVDR levels. The activated vitamin D pathway, as reflected by the increased expression of nVDR mRNA levels, stimulates odontoclast activity. Inflammatory changes and the nuclear VDR overexpression might therefore both play an important role in the pathophysiology of RL in cats. Long-term clinical studies are needed to investigate their causative role pathogenesis of dental RL in cats.",
