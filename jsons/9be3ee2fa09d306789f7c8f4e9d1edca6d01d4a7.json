However, this association has not been unequivocally established. Thus, the purpose of this investigation was to examine the association between male sex and COVID-19 severity. We systematically reviewed the literature, identified non-randomized studies that matched predetermined selection criteria, and performed a meta-analysis to evaluate the proportion of males among four disease severity categories. Appropriate assessment strategies were implemented to assess and minimize potential biases. The results of this meta-analysis indicated that males constituted a significantly higher proportion of those who had adverse clinical outcomes and died from COVID-19. As the coronavirus spread from the East to the West, male sex remained a consistent risk factor. Our results support the establishment of the male sex as an important risk factor for this disease. Early identification and appropriate medical care for males with lab-confirmed COVID-19 may substantially change the course of clinical prognosis, resulting in greater numbers of lives saved.

We used linear regression on the other 10 (mean, SD) pairs to estimate the SD to be 14.5 years. To combine the ages, we chose to convert means to medians because there would be fewer unknown statistics to estimate, and typical disease distributions are skewed. To convert, we fit a negative binomial distribution to the mean and SD using the method of moments.

The median age for all COVID-19 cases was 50, severe cases was 61, critically ill cases was 63, and mortality was 70 (Figure 7) . A Kruskall-Wallis ranked-sum test conducted on the medians showed that age was significantly different between the COVID-19 disease severity groups (chi-squared = 24.07, df = 3, p-value = < 0.0001).

For example, SARS-CoV-2 binds to the Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors and use it as a mechanism for host cell entry (Hoffmann et al., 2020) . Males have been shown to express more ACE2 receptors within the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) (Komukai et al., 2010) . This is likely to play an essential role in the severity of this disease observed in males (Komukai et al., 2010) .

Error bars represent 95% confidence intervals of the median. The median age for all COVID-19 cases was 50, severe cases was 61, critically ill cases was 63, and mortality was 70. A Kruskall-Wallis ranked-sum test conducted on the medians showed that age was significantly different amount the COVID-19 disease severity groups (chi-squared = 24.07, df = 3, p-value = <0.0001).",

There was strong heterogeneity between the critical population proportions ( 2 = 86%, = 0.0103). A funnel plot was drawn to assess the publication bias in studies from the West (Figure 6b). The publication bias test results: Egger's test (p-value = 0.04) indicated that there could be some publication bias introduced by the Grasselli et al. (2020) study, as indicated previously. This comparative subgroup analysis of Asia and the West indicated that there was no geographyspecific difference in the proportion of critically ill COVID-19 male patients. However, indicated by the moderate to strong heterogeneity observed, there are likely variations in male proportion between different studies and regions.",
