The term \"cardiometabolic\u00bb had previously used by Pescatello in 1999 for obesity (13) , by Sowers in 2001 for \"CM Syndrome\" (14) , and by Vasudevan & Ballantyne in 2005 (15) for \"CM Risk\u00bb in two phases. Firstly, the term was used by Khan, Buse, Ferrannini and Stern in a symposium whose proceedings were never published. Fortunately, their conclusions were collected and valued as of great interest by other authors (Vasudevan & Ballantyne) ; they published them that same year (15) laying the groundwork for a new enlightened medicine. This medicine, the CMM, is much more eagerly, dynamic, open that the classical cardiovascular medicine, and at the same time much more predictive, preventive and anticipatory. To topping it all off, the CMM is the prototype of the modern \"Precision Medicine\", on which the American government spent so many millions in research during the last decade (16) .",

            "text": "At a local level, RAS, with all its components such as ACE, renin, angiotensinogen and AII, was firstly reported in dog's brain and later in other organs (28, 33) . ACE in vascular cells is expressed in the endothelial cells (EC) and smooth muscle cells (SMC) independently; so, ACE in SMC, unlike the EC, is insulin-dependent (34) including the lymphatic system. On their behalf, its homologue ACE2 is expressed mainly locally (by the local RAS) with a low production by the systemic RAAS axis which include, unlike the local system, the aldosterone in the equation. ACE2 is one of the type-I integral proteins, expressed fundamentally at the cell surface as an ectoenzyme and is found at heart, kidney, small intestine, lung (type II pneumocytes), pancreas and liver among others. The expression of ACE2 in the endothelium and vascular SMC opens an unexplored pathway in subjects with COVID-19 who develop acute coronary syndromes. It had been demonstrated that in patients treated with RAS-blockers, the risk of atherothrombosis decreases. This could be explained because by dampening local A-II and vice versa, an over activated ACE2 could produce the opposite effect (35) ; this does not happen in older people, because they have ACE2 expression reduced in all organs in which it has been described, but especially at the vascular level (36) . At both the systemic and vascular level, ACE2 acts as a buffer, so that Angiotensin-II does not rise excessively when its receptor is exogenously blocked. Therefore, ACE2 is a key counter regulatory enzyme that degrades angiotensin II to angiotensin-(1-7), thereby attenuating its effects on vasoconstriction, sodium retention, and fibrosis. Although angiotensin II is the primary substrate of ACE2, that enzyme also cleaves angiotensin I to angiotensin-(1-9) and participates in the hydrolysis of other peptides (28) . Both ACEs uses Zn\u00b2 + and Clas cofactors for being metalloproteases (37) . It could have therapeutic implications especially in people who use zinc as a nutraceutical (38) .",

Secondly, high doses of corticosteroids not only produce hyperglycaemia in patients, even in not diabetics (50) , but also raise blood pressure and in many cases lead to hypokalaemia, increasing the risk of arrhythmias. Other causes of non-diabetic hyperglycaemia, in many cases associated to corticosteroid administration would be high doses of loop diuretic, sepsis and very especially the enteral and parenteral nutrition (50, 51) .",

Both were visionaries, but especially the latter when he published his book (in 1954) without even knowing the nitric oxide, the main endothelial product, discovered in the 1980s, leading Furchgott, Ignarro and Murad, to be recognized as the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1998.",

There are many important molecular aspects involving them, but the principal one is the combined activation of what we consider as the \u00ablethal triad\u00bb. The three elements of this triad are: 1) the mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin), 2) the NF-kB (Nuclear Factor Kappa-B) signalling pathways (83) on one side, and 3) the NOX enzymes (84) of the submembranous cytoplasm on the other side, which release more free radicals than the mitochondria itself.",

(89) Surprisingly, there are extensive data showing, moreover, that latent persistent human cytomegalovirus infection is also associated with age-related immune dysfunction in the T cells, which might enhance immunosenescence. In this way, in the case of COVID-19, in older groups, a virus could be predisposing to another virus. (90) If we can still get even more surprised, both the endoplasmic reticulum stress and autophagy are involved in the process of immunosenescence (91) . In accordance with the above, could the immunosenescence be related to the special aggressiveness of COVID-19 in the elderly?.",
