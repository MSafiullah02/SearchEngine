Shortages of drugs place undue pressure on healthcare providers to devise alternative approaches to administer patient care. With climate change expected to result in increasingly severe weather patterns in the future, it is critical that logistics engineers understand the impact that a catastrophic weather event could have on supply chain disruption to facilitate the design of supply systems that are robust and resilient. This study investigates the main causal and intermediate events that led to risk propagation in, and disruption of, the U.S. pharmaceutical supply chain following Hurricane Maria. A causality Bayesian model is developed to depict linkages between risk events and quantify the associated cumulative risk. The quantification is further examined through different advanced techniques such as predictive inference reasoning and sensitivity analysis. The general interpretation of these analyses suggests that port resilience is imperative to pharmaceutical supply chain performance in the case of Puerto Rico.",

United States citizens expect to receive the care that they need when administered to a hospital or health care facility to address an emergency situation or chronic disease. Part of these expectations includes access to prescribed drugs that support care and recovery in an expedient manner. Shortages of critical drugs in the pharmaceutical supply chain pose a national security threat (ASHP, 2018) . In June 2018, the American Medical Association (AMA) published a statement indicating that continuous shortages of pharmaceutical products present a health care crisis (AMA, 2018) .

To ensure an effective health care system that is capable of responding to the medical requirements of its citizens, a robust and resilient pharmaceutical supply chain is essential.",

Several factors can lead to disruptions in global pharmaceutical supply chains, resulting in shortages in the U.S. These risks can be classified into two broad categories: (i) operational risks and (ii) disruptive risks (Tang, 2006) . Operational risks refer to uncertainties inherent in everyday supply chain activities that impede the delivery of customer requirements. Examples include price volatility, demand fluctuation, equipment breakdown, and quality failures. Disruptive risks are those events that lead to major interruptions in the supply chain, negatively impacting delivery of requirements to the customer. Catastrophic events such as earthquakes and hurricanes, as well as man-made disasters such as cyber-crime and political protests fall into this category.",

In a survey on supply chain risks, natural disasters that impact supplier facilities were counted among the top risk concerns of supply chain managers (O'Marah, 2017) . With climate change events predicted to increase ten-fold in the future, (Chandler, 2017) , understanding the risks posed to supply chains is imperative. Extreme weather events lead to serious consequences in supply chains, particularly those with a global span. If an extreme weather event precedes or coincides with another risk event, the situation becomes extremely dire. For instance, in September 2017, Hurricane Maria hit Puerto Rico as a Category IV storm and exposed the vulnerability of the island's pharmaceutical supply chains to the consequences of extreme weather risk. Simultaneously, one of the most severe influenza seasons on record was beginning and within weeks escalated to levels that exceeded twice the national baseline, increasing the demand for intravenous normal saline to treat patients.",

The impact of the storm on the U.S. pharmaceutical supply chain became obvious as disruptions in pharmaceutical manufacturing and delivery led to severe shortages of saline solution in hospitals on the U.S. mainland (AANA, 2019; Department of Homeland Security, 2018) . In the U.S., 40 million bags of saline solution packaged in two sizes (250 ml and 500 ml) are used in hospitals per month (Mazer-Amirshahi and Fox, 2018; Sifferlin, 2014) . In the event of a shortage of either size, some substitution with accommodation can be made. However, in the absence of bagged saline solution, other methods have to be devised to treat patients. This comes at a price to health care quality as issues, such as contamination or dilution errors, can arise, propagating even further risk in the system (Mazer-Amirshahi and Fox, 2018) .",

To answer the aforementioned questions, a detailed model for the specific case of the pharmaceutical supply chain following a natural disaster was developed using the Bayesian network (BN) approach. This model contributes to the supply chain risk management literature by developing a more detailed approach to quantify the risk associated with extreme weather events, based on an actual situation. The outcome of this research will provide high level insights into reducing the exposure of natural disasters and corrective susceptibilities on the pharmaceutical supply chain and evaluating the applicability of countermeasures based on the types of weather risk.",

Operational activities include routine sourcing, conversion, production, and logistics, while strategic functions focus on coordination, collaboration, and integration of key functions and processes within and across companies (CSCMP, 2020) . Logistics management is defined as \"that part of supply chain management that plans, implements, and controls the efficient, effective forward and reverse flow and storage of goods, services, and related information between the point of origin and the point of consumption to meet customers' requirements\" (CSCMP, 2020) . Both operational and strategic factors are critical considerations in designing high performing supply chains.

Cost is critical in the pharmaceutical sector because of the large investments made in research and development, limited patent protection, and regulatory requirements (Basu et al., 2008) . To mitigate losses once patents expire, companies locate manufacturing plants in low cost regions and consolidate companies into fewer larger firms. Puerto Rico has become a pharmaceutical manufacturing hub because of the tax incentives offered (Langhauser, 2018; Foley & Lardner, 2014; PEE, 2016) , strategic geographic location between North and South America and Europe, globally approved manufacturing sites (PEE, 2016), highly trained workforce (Garguilo, 2014) , relatively low wages (Foley & Lardner, 2014) , stable political climate, and legal infrastructure that supports U.S. FDA regulatory requirements and intellectual property.

In general, risk is measured quantitatively by combining the probability of occurrence and the severity of impact (Pinto et al., 2015) . Because of the links that exist between supply chain nodes in one supply chain and those in other supply chains (Brindley, 2004) , understanding the source and nature of supply chain risks is important to effectively mitigate risk and manage supply chain performance. Supply chain risks stem from myriad sources, including offshore manufacturing, terrorism, political unrest, natural disasters, economic cycles, fluctuations in demand, infectious diseases, infrastructure, man-made disasters, currency volatility, price risks, information systems risk, quality risks, pilferage, lean supply chain strategies, outsourcing and sole sourcing, forecasting, intellectual property theft, customer payment default, inventory policies, capacity limitations, and delays due to disruptions, (Lawrence et al., 2020; Jacobs and Chase, 2014; Wisner et al., 2019; Tang, 2006; Chopra and Sodhi, 2004) . Supply chain risk (SCR) and supply chain risk management (SCRM) definitions vary and include both customer and firm perspectives. For example, Chase and Jacobs (2014) define supply chain risk as the probability that a disruption will reduce a supply chain's capability to deliver customer orders without delays. Zsidisin and Ritchie (2008) define supply risk as \"the probability of an incident associated with inbound supply from individual supply failures or the supply market occurring, in which its outcomes result in the inability of the purchasing firm to meet customer demand or cause threats to customer life and safety\" Benton (2014) supports these definitions by defining supply chain risk in terms of the likelihood of an event occurring that results in negative consequences. Tang (2006) takes a more corporate perspective by defining supply chain risk management as the \"coordination and collaboration among supply chain partners to meet profitability requirements and ensure continuity.\" From these definitions it becomes obvious that management of risks in pharmaceutical supply chains is necessary to support the delivery of efficient, effective, and timely health care to patients.",

            "text": "Supply chain vulnerability is defined as \"an exposure to serious disturbance, arising from risks within the supply chain as well as risks external to the supply chain\" (Cranfield University, 2002) . Petit (2009) extends this definition from merely an \"exposure\" to \"susceptibility\" of a supply chain to internal and external risks (Petit, 2009 ). Rousseau (2003 provides a more general definition of vulnerability, which nonetheless is applicable in understanding the linkages between risk and vulnerability in a supply chain context. The author describes vulnerability in terms of the risk faced compared to the capacity to mitigate the risk, or in mathematical terms, Vulnerability = Risk / Capabilities (Rousseau, 2003 in Gondard-Delcroix, 2015 . Laville (2006) notes that supply chain vulnerability has increased with globalization and modularization. Supply chain resilience is somewhat under-explored in the academic literature (Elleuch et al., 2016; Christopher & Peck, 2004) and among scholars, a common definition is still lacking (Hohenstein et al., 2015) . The term \"resilience\" is used to refer to the ability to return to a former state after being subjected to a period of stress. Ponomarov and Holcomb (2009) describe supply chain resilience as the ability to adapt to unforeseen conditions, respond to disruptions, and recover to the desired level of performance to ensure business continuity (Ponomarov and Holcomb, 2009) . Three dimensions of resilience are robustness, resources, and recovery (Elleuch et al., 2016) . Supply chain resilience includes preparedness, reaction, recovery, and growth (Hohenstein et al., 2015) . The emphasis in the literature appears to be on recovery rather than preparedness, but proactiveness is critical for recovery and growth (Hohenstein, 2015) . Some proactive measures discussed in the literature to ensure supply chain resilience include building buffer inventories; hedging currencies; developing rapid means of communication with supply chain partners; strategic staging of resources; resource pooling across supply chain echelons; identifying, evaluating, and approving alternative suppliers; redesigning products to facilitate the interchange of component parts; ensuring redundancy is built into digital networks; and designing supply chain networks such that the concentration of supply sources within a specific geographical area is reduced (Wisner et al., 2012; Jacobs and Chase, 2014; Tang, 2006) .",

However, according to a report published in the journal of Homeland Security Affairs, at least three factors that interplay in the consequences of disaster risk need to be considered: (i) dependencies within the system, (ii) distance between demand and supply points, and (iii) capacity of substitute networks to meet requirements (Palin, 2018) . These factors have been highlighted in regard to civilian risks following a disaster but are equally applicable to supply chain node risk. With regard to the first point, the dependencies within the supply chain system must be understood, including those factors that impact supply and demand balances within the supply chain. In reference to the second, transportation networks and logistics and supply chain relationships must be known and foreseen to understand where system failures are likely to occur in the movement of goods from supply to demand points. For the third point, critical infrastructures must be identified to enable redundancies, e.g., in the electric power, water, transportation, and telecommunications systems. The 2017 Atlantic hurricane season revealed several factors of importance in designing resilient supply chains to minimize failures and recovery delays in the event of a large-scale natural disaster.",

Using this method, supply chain risk is computed by calculating a risk priority number (RPN) that incorporates the probability of a risk event occurring, the likelihood of detection, and the severity of the consequences. FMEA has also been used in combination with other methods. Arabsheybani et al. (2018) propose an approach that combines FMEA in combination with Fuzzy MOORA to minimize supplier sustainability risk, while maximizing profits through order allocation. Other methods have been used to select suppliers, while also considering supplier risk factors. De Felice et al. (2015) used Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) to evaluate the factors that are critical to supplier performance that could become a risk if performance falls below expectations. The authors evaluated seven factors: quality system, performance, technical capability, reputation, price and cost, financial stability, and geographical location. Kirytopoulos et al. (2008) applied an Analytic Network Process (ANP) approach to evaluate pharmaceutical suppliers. Pourhejazy et al. (2017) used Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) to rank alternative supply chain networks for a Liquified Petroleum Gas company. More robust quantitative approaches include mathematical programming models and stochastic methods. Fuzzy TOPSIS has been applied to quantify risk factors in pharmaceutical supply chains (Mehralian et al., 2012) . Govindan and Jepsen (2016) applied ELECTRE TRI-C approach to classify suppliers based on risk exposure. Simulation has been employed to evaluate supply chain cost and lead times under different network design configurations (Tang, 2006) .",

Nepal and Yadav (2015) combined FMEA and Bayesian networks to evaluate sourcing risks in the pharmaceutical sector across four countries. The study focused on evaluating operational risks related to sourcing effectiveness, e.g., seaport efficiency, port equipment availability, documentation accuracy, length of supply chain, worker strikes that disrupt the supply chain, wage fluctuations, quality issues, and price and cost changes. Sharma and Sharma (2015) developed a conceptual Bayesian network model that integrated a variety of risks based on data collected across a number of industries. They incorporated eight categories of risk -process, supply, demand, environmental, relationship, catastrophe, logistical, and control risk -which were ranked using a pairwise comparison. In their model, the relative importance of catastrophe risk was ranked among the least important. Table 1 provides a synopsis of existing themes to evaluate suppliers. These general themes serve as a baseline snapshot in developing the proposed model. After surveying the literature, one important gap is identified and needs to be addressed. There is a lack of risk assessment models that design and quantify the impact of severe weather risk on pharmaceutical supply chain disruption. To address this gap, this research proposes the following:",

All nodes have an associated node probability table (NPT). The probability of each event happening is indicated in the node probability table for each risk event. Parent nodes state the prior probabilities for the node state, whereas child nodes indicate the posterior probabilities of the node state as a condition based on the parent node states. Node states can take on a variety of probability distributions such as Boolean, continuous, and discrete.",

First, by observing the structure of a Bayesian model, one can determine the causal relationships without further computations (Heckerman et al., 1995; Sharma and Sharma, 2015) . Another advantage is that it allows a better assessment of risk because it is flexible in accommodating more detailed information on the causes and propagation events of the risk as new information is received. Bayesian networks incorporate conditionalities, so that risk is computed based on a series of prior events that impact the outcomes. Bayesian networks have been applied to multifarious problems, e.g., to evaluate risk and reliability; diagnose the source of faults; prevent the likelihood of failures; assess how managerial interventions impact sustainability; predict uncertainty and metrics in manufacturing; and categorize data and manage projects. Bayesian networks are also useful where the risk associated with a particular event cannot be treated solely on the basis of historical incidents of the event and expert opinion is required.",

On site-and production line-specific approvals granted by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) are required for pharmaceutical manufacturers to supply U.S. healthcare facilities. Within the same pharmaceutical company, production cannot be shifted from one site to another without FDA approval certifying compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practice (cGMP). Without alternative FDA approved sites prior to a disaster, total production capacity remains fixed at best or reduced in the aftermath. The situation is exacerbated when manufacturers require high volume production to achieve economies of scale, leading to a single supplier situation. Risk factors for the number of FDA approved sources are (a) the percentage of product supplied by a single supplier (Baxter) and (b) the percentage of product supplied by other suppliers.",

The major risk factor for an increased demand for saline is an outbreak of disease (e.g. influenza) in the United States, which leads to an increase in hospitalization rates, resulting in the demand for saline above average season requirements to treat patients. Potential risk factors for a reduction in supply stem from reduced production capacity due to lost production days and a lack of redundancy in the number of FDAapproved suppliers. Another risk factor for supply shortage is delays in outbound logistics due to reduced port operations efficiency.

The Reduced Port Operations Efficiency (Node 26) is conditioned upon five factors, namely: Reduced Trucking Capacity, Port Equipment and Facilities Damaged, Electric Grid down, Increased Inbound Cargo Supply, and Employees Failing to Report to Work. Thus, if we design this variable using Boolean logic, it requires 2 5 =32 entries, which is quite tedious and error prone as well. Moreover, many of those 32 entries may be unnecessary and have minimal impact on the Reduced Port Operations Efficiency node. As an alternative, the \"NoisyOR\" concept was used to design the posterior probability of this node. In addition, it is possible that there are other hidden factors that could influence the likelihood of a disruption. To account for these hidden or \"leak\" factors, a NoisyOR function is a convenient choice, where the leak factor is the extent to which factors absent from the model could contribute to the outcome being true. For example, this situation would apply if there are n variables designated as A 1 , A 2 \u2026.A n that are conditioned on B, with the probability of B being true when only one of the variables, A 1, is true and all causal variables other than A 1 are false, whereas leak factors are denoted by l. Following is the NoisyOR function:",

(2017) , impassable roads and bridges, coupled with depleted fuel supplies, greatly impacted the availability of transportation. With a limited number of public bus lines running (Levin et al., 2017) to accommodate workers out of gas, the posterior probability of inaccessibility of transportation (Node 22) was calculated at 2.78% functional, 97.22% failed. Finally, it is obvious that if the Internet and telecommunications system goes down preventing communication with truckers, roads and bridges are impassable, and depleted fuel supplies are widespread, there will be a scarcity of drivers, resulting in reduced trucking capacity (Domonoske, 2017; Gillespie, 2017) . Based on reports indicating that only 20% of drivers reported for work (Gillespie et al., 2017; GPSTechnologies, 2017) , and in order to calculate the posterior probability of the reduced trucking capacity, the same NoisyOR logic has been applied as discussed above.",

With the Internet and telecommunications systems down and a lack of satellite phones, communication with manufacturing plant employees and truckers was severed (Jarvis, 2018) . In the aftermath of the disaster, personal trauma related to damaged housing, unavailability of cash, inability to use EBT cards to access groceries, a failed transportation system, as well as migration of approximately 400,000 Puerto Ricans to the U.S. mainland are contributory factors expected to result in employees failing to report to work (Buchanan, 2018; Bomey, 2017) . In order to compute the posterior probability of the node titled \"employees fail to report to work\" of the proposed model, a labelled node named \"weighting (weighted average)\" is introduced to demonstrate the weight of each variable responsible for \"employees fail to report to work\". The weights were estimated based on subjective judgment and personal anecdotes of professionals with expert knowledge in the areas of supply chain management, port operations, and risk management. Two of the experts were able to provide real life experiences in dealing with severe post-hurricane disaster situations. Labelled variables can have a number of discrete states. Simply, the weighted average is the weighted mean probabilities of all the parent nodes of the aforementioned node as represented in the following equation (3). \u202b\u0730\u0723\u0727\u072f\u0739\u202c = \u2211\u0739 \u202b\u0723\u202c = 1,2 \u2026 \u2026 \u074a, \u2200\u0745 = 1; 0 < \u0739 < 1; \u2211 \u0739 = 1",

The previously discussed \"weighted average\" concept was adopted to compute the posterior probability of the lost production days node. Reduced production capacity is predicated on two factors: lost production days (Paavola, 2018; Puerto Rico Report, 2018) and available capacity among FDA approved suppliers following Hurricane Maria. Prior to Hurricane Maria, FDA approved plants were already operating at near full capacity with no supply redundancy (Mazer-Amirshahi and Fox, 2018) . This is supported by reports that indicate Baxter, which supplied approximately half of U.S. hospital saline, reduced order fulfillment quantities by 50% in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria (Bean, 2017) . Based on these contributing factors and reports, the posterior probabilities for reduced production capacity are calculated close to 24% True, 76% False.",

Based on this information, the Boolean values that represent Baxter's supply to U.S. hospitals were set at 50% True, 50% False as in Table 3 (Node 5) and the probability values for the combined supply of other FDA suppliers was set at 50% True, 50% False (Node 6). This implies that 50% of U.S. hospital requirements for saline were supplied by other suppliers and 50% by Baxter. Entries were similar to that shown in Table 3 .

An example of prognostic reasoning is the entering of data on an extreme weather event, e.g. a hurricane, and predicting the resulting risk exposure to an object or system. In our study, we consider prognostic inference reasoning also known as forward propagation analysis to predict the likelihood of disruption in hospital supplies under a combination of influential factors modeled using historical data and expert opinion based on the events following Hurricane Maria. The forward propagation of the model seeks to evaluate the outcome of the target node, disruption in hospital supplies, given the nodal probabilities of the causal factors.",

The three variables were selected because these factors exacerbated an already strained production situation following Hurricane Maria. The unique requirements of the pharmaceutical industry for cGMP compliant facilities and economies of scale in manufacturing encourage large scale production by a few suppliers. This could lead to a precarious single source situation. Epidemics are also likely risks faced by the healthcare sector. In the event of a major epidemic, product demand could rise sharply above existing requirements. Port failure could highly impact the pharmaceutical transportation network to carry the product (saline) from the supplier to the customer (hospitals) within the stipulated time frame. All of these observations together have a negative impact on the hospital supply chain and the results of the propagation analysis indicate that disruption in the hospital supply chain could rise from 65.73% to as high as 89.18%.

In the event of a disaster, the flow of hospital supplies to the mainland could be quickly severed if the port's primary infrastructure is destroyed forcing a shutdown or if operations are slowed to a pace that fails to synchronize supply with demand. Moreover, the port is a critical juncture in the flow of both inbound raw materials for pharmaceutical manufacturing and outbound finished goods, signifying that any bottleneck in operations will seriously hamper supplies to U.S. hospitals. Based on the criticality of the health care sector, the highest emphasis should be placed on developing robust and resilient port infrastructure and operations. ",

Although the Bayesian network is a static model, by understanding the probability of recovery at different points in time following a major hurricane disaster (see Figure 5) , a risk manager can use the model for decision-making in three ways: (i) proactively, to guide the design of a resilient pharmaceutical supply chain network, including the selection of supplier locations to minimize severe weather risk, (2) proactively, to perform scenario analysis to support the development of a risk response contingency plan to minimize the impact of adverse events on supply chain performance, and (iii) reactively, to update the Bayesian model in crisis management situations as data on recovery progress becomes available, to determine the impact on supply chain performance to the end customer. The model can be adapted to include other concurrent non-weather risk events as indicated in the case of the influenza outbreak in the United States. This would allow supply chain managers to more effectively plan for risk management in the pharmaceutical supply chain. The Bayesian network model can also be adapted for the dynamic case by dividing the recovery timeline into time slices and using the associated probabilities in each case to make a prediction. This Bayesian network model was customized for the situation following Hurricane Maria's landfall in Puerto Rico and the subsequent impact on U.S. mainland hospitals, but the model can be modified for other supply chains in supplier locations that are prone to catastrophic weather risk. The model provides high level insights into a series of hidden risks that unfolded following the disaster, leading to a shortage of saline in U.S. hospitals. It also demonstrates the fragility of the U.S. pharmaceutical supply chain to the onset of known recurrent risks that coincided with the event, e.g., the influenza outbreak, which increased the severity of the outcome and delayed supply chain recovery.",

At least up to November 2017, a rationing system was required since orders could only be partially filled due to Baxter not being fully reconnected to the electric grid and the persistence of operations and logistics problems (Anderson and Sullivan, 2017; Ferris, 2017; Fox, 2018) .
