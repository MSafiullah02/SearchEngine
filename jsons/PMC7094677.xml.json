In 1987, Kotler et al3 noted alterations in intestinal plasma cells of AIDS patients without identifiable (at that point in time) intestinal pathogens (Figure 1). In HIV-infected patients with AIDS-related complex or fully expressed AIDS, the mean villus/height and mean villus/crypt ratios were significantly lower than those of normal controls (Figure 2). By using immunofluorescence staining, the researchers observed a decrease in immunoglobulin (Ig)A plasma cells and a relative increase in IgM plasma cells in the small bowel and in the colon. There also was decreased quantitative plasma cell fluorescence in samples that were stained for IgA and IgM, implying less cytoplasmic immunoglobulin per cell. However, the depletion of IgA from plasma cells did not always correlate with altered serum IgA concentrations. Kotler et al3 also noted that the lymphoid depletion in patients with AIDS might be patchy and might involve many cells in addition to the plasma cells.",

In 1998, Cunningham et al4 first identified rotaviruses and adenoviruses by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, electron microscopy, and/or cell culture analyses. These 2 viruses were found in more than 50% of HIV-positive symptomatic patients with diarrhea, but in less than 15% of HIV-negative patients, and in less than 20% of HIV-positive asymptomatic patients without diarrhea. It appeared, therefore, that these viruses occasionally were associated with a high excretion rate in HIV-infected patients with diarrhea and might be associated with acute episodes or relapses of diarrhea. Cunningham et al4 also postulated that there may be additional, yet to be identified, pathogens in patients with chronic or relapsing acute diarrhea.",

Sixty-five HIV-positive patients were grouped into those with diarrhea and those without diarrhea. Adenovirus, astrovirus, and picobiranvirus, but not chronovirus, Caliciviridae, or featureless small round viruses were noted in the stools of HIV-positive patients with diarrhea compared with HIV-infected patients without diarrhea. Overall, 35% of the fecal specimens in patients with AIDS and refractory diarrhea harbored 1 or more of these viruses, compared with only 12% of the stools of patients without diarrhea (Table 2). Thus, studies and reports of so-called AIDS enteropathy always should be tempered by the reality that these viruses, as well as other infectious agents, ultimately may be found in patients with so-called idiopathic AIDS-related diarrhea. One need only recall belatedly identified pathogens such as mycobacterium-avium complex, cryptosporidium, or microsporidium in patients with previously termed idiopathic AIDS diarrhea.",

Nelson et al6 in 1988, using in situ hybridization of biopsied specimens obtained from the rectum and duodenum, showed HIV-infected cells in both the base of the crypts and within the lamina propria. They postulated that the association of in situ labeling of HIV RNA in argentaffin cells strongly suggested that enterochromaffin cells derive from the neural crest tissue and may in fact be among the primary target cells of HIV. Along the same lines, Batman et al7 described jejunal enteropathy associated with HIV; the degree of villus atrophy in the jejunal mucosa was estimated using a Widal eye piece graticule. Jejunal villus enterocytes showed mild, nonspecific abnormalities with crypt hyperplasia recurring in all stages of HIV disease, even in the absence of pathogens. They suggested that the pathogenesis of villus atrophy was actually an immune reaction within the lamina propria against cells infected with HIV. Delezay et al8 reported the findings from an in vitro study on the differentiation of an epithelial cell clone HT-29-D4. They noted that HIV impaired cellular differentiation of both barrier function and sodium-glucose co-transport. In this epithelial cell line, HIV massively disrupted microtubules, revealed by \u03b1-tubulin indirect immunofluorescence staining. The investigators suggested that HIV perturbs intestinal function with or without infecting the epithelial cells themselves.",

Batman et al9 have studied crypt, stem, and transit cell proliferation. In a study on the kinetics of stem and transit cell lines, they noted definite villus atrophy induced by both microsporidia and HIV itself. Both these infections provoke crypt cell hypertrophy, including encroachment of the crypt cells onto the villi by stimulating cell mitoses in both stem and transit cells. Dandekar10 clarified the pathogenesis of HIV disease in the GI tract, noting that the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) was clearly an early site of HIV replication and CD4+ T-cell depletion. Additional studies have supported that HIV destroys GALT in the early stages of HIV infection.11 Initiation of HAART did not lead to complete suppression of viral replication and there was only partial restoration of CD4+ T-cells in the GALT, compared with the peripheral blood. It appeared that persistent HIV replication in GALT leads to crypt alterations and maintenance of the HIV reservoirs.",

            "text": "Knox et al12 described the functional disruption of the GI tract caused by HIV in 2000. Among 671 patients with HIV infection, 39% had diarrhea; stool pathogens were identified in only 12% of these patients. Despite this, 48% of all patients had an abnormal D-xylose test, 22.5% had borderline or low serum B-12 levels, and 7.2% had a depressed albumin level. The investigators suggested that abnormalities of the GI tract are common even in the era of modern HAART, so the clinician therefore carefully must exclude identifiable pathogens, even in patients who are on HAART. Monkemuller et al13 noted that since the widespread use of HAART, there has been a dramatic decrease in the prevalence of identifiable opportunistic infections of the GI tract, but that opportunistic infections still occurred. They examined a population of 294 patients treated with HAART; 88% of the patients were men, with a mean age of 36.5 years. In this study patients had a mean CD4+ T-cell count of 64 and a mean RNA viral load of 40,357 copies per mL. Despite all being treated with HAART, 9% of patients had identifiable opportunistic disorders of the GI tract. In careful questioning, however, they identified approximately 40% of these patients with new or persistent opportunistic disorders of the GI tract as being likely or definitely noncompliant with administered HAART. Thus, GI opportunistic disorders still can occur in HIV-positive patients, including those allegedly taking HAART and especially in those with low CD4+ T-cell counts and high HIV viral loads. Unfortunately, these opportunistic disorders still can occur in patients with near-normal CD4+ T-cell counts and low HIV viral loads.",

In 2008, Sankaran et al11 highlighted once again the importance of GALT as an early target for HIV infection and the site of severe CD4+ T-cell depletion. They noted that viral replication occurred very early in primary HIV infection in the GALT CD4+ T cells and macrophages. There was also a decrease in the expression levels of genes that regulate epithelial barrier maintenance and digestive metabolic function. These changes coincided with a decrease in transcription of immune activation, inflammation, and apoptosis-associated genes. Consequently, HIV infection in GALT occurs at both a molecular and a cellular level even before seroconversion.",

GI OIs include a complex milieu of bacteria, fungus, viruses, and protozoa that typically exert their devastating effects when a patient's CD4+ T-cell count decreases to less than 200 cells/\u03bcL (Figure 3). The study of GI OIs has undergone an astonishing transformation over the past 25 years, and has been marked by periods of remarkable discovery and innovation in terms of identifying new pathogens and suitable treatments. Similar to the evolving treatment of these infections, the role of the gastroenterologist under these circumstances has changed over time as well. In many cases, a multidisciplinary approach among gastroenterology, infectious disease, HIV specialists, oncology, and surgery not only is encouraged, but in many cases is required for treating HIV patients with GI OIs.",

In examining 166 AIDS patients undergoing dual endoscopy for GI complaints at 3 time periods in the 1990s (2-year intervals), they discovered the incidence of GI OIs decreased from a peak of 69% to a nadir of 13%, whereas at the same time HAART use in their patients increased from 37% to 87%. Several multifactor theories have been proposed to explain this decline of GI OIs. One is that the re-establishment of the patient's own natural immunity, with the repopulation of T cells in the enteric mucosa, combats various opportunistic pathogens that it previously could not fight. A second explanation may be the direct effect of the HAART regimen itself on specific pathogens. Within combinational HAART, protease inhibitors have been observed both in vivo and in vitro to have inhibitory properties on specific organisms via the degradation of aspartyl proteases.16, 17 Regardless of the mechanism, HAART has had extraordinary success in treating HIV-associated GI OIs since its introduction.",

For example, multiple studies uniformly have shown a decrease in the incidence of cryptosporidium and microsporidium in response to HAART.18, 19 Likewise, an influential 1998 study by Carr et al20 discovered that HIV patients infected with Cryptosporidium parvum or Enterocytozoon bieneusi (most of which had failed previous antimicrobial therapy) had a full clinical, histologic, and microbiological response to HAART. In addition, a majority of patients remained symptom free for more than 1 year and those with recurrent symptoms had declining CD4+ T-cell counts. However, this interplay between HAART and the treatment of GI OIs is not limited to parasitic and fungal organisms. This story was unraveled eloquently in several studies on the treatment of patients with cytomegalovirus (CMV) infections. HIV patients on combination HAART consistently have greater rates of survival, compared with HAART-naive patients, even when adjusting for CMV therapy.21 Accordingly, the profound effect of HAART on treating GI OIs is unquestionable and should be front-line therapy for many GI OIs. Although the effects of HAART are compelling, some researchers have noted the occurrence of GI OIs despite the use of HAART.13 In this subset of patients, factors such as medication noncompliance, resistant strains of HIV, late initiation of HAART, or poor bioavailability of HAART all could have a role in its inability to always treat OIs. These situations underscore the need for continued targeted therapy of OIs in some circumstances despite the use of HAART (Table 3).\n",

            "text": "Over the years, 2 main therapies have emerged as potential treatments for cryptosporidiosis: nitazoxanide and paromomycin. However, clinical studies on both these agents have been limited by their small sample sizes, the lack of enrollment of patients with HIV, the small number of randomized controlled trials, and conflicting results. A 2007 Cochrane meta-analysis attempted to address and resolve these issues.25 The meta-analysis of studies of nitazoxanide therapy compared with placebo indicated that nitazoxanide effectively cured the parasitic infection in patients overall, but the data for patients with HIV was not statistically significant; HIV patients tended to have less resolution of their diarrheal illness. Interestingly, the only 2 randomized studies that were included in this meta-analysis and that examined nitazoxanide therapy in HIV patients had several striking differences. An initial study by Rossignol et al26 in 1998 showed that HIV patients with cryptosporidial diarrhea and CD4+ T-cell counts of 50 cells/\u03bcL or more had a greater than 60% cure rate compared with placebo after 2 weeks of nitazoxanide therapy. Conversely, 3 years later, Amadi et al27 examined children with AIDS and found that a short, 3-day course of nitazoxanide therapy resulted in reduced stool volume, increased fecal oocyte clearance, and improved mortality in HIV-negative children, but did not show similar results for HIV-positive children. One could argue that the treatment duration of 2 weeks compared with 3 days as well as the patient population (adult vs pediatric) makes comparing and drawing cohesive conclusions from these 2 studies challenging. Fueling this debate was a 2006 multicenter prospective evaluation of 365 AIDS patients with cryptosporidiosis treated with nitazoxanide. This has been the largest study to date on nitazoxanide therapy for HIV-related cryptosporidiosis and more than 94% of the study subjects were adults. This study showed that 59% of patients achieved a clinical response with culture-negative stool cultures while on nitazoxanide therapy and that patients with higher CD4+ T-cell counts were more likely to achieve a continued clinical response.28 Further, larger randomized placebo-controlled trials with nitazoxanide therapy in HIV patients are warranted before definitive recommendations for treatment can be made; although current evidence appears to support the use of nitazoxanide in HIV adult patients for a prolonged course with a better response rate observed in patients with more robust cellular immunity.",

The 2007 Cochrane meta-analysis showed a slight trend toward effective treatment using paromomycin, but the overall relative risks for decreased stool frequency and oocyte clearance were modest and not statistically significant.25 Compared with randomized trials for nitazoxanide, paromomycin therapy had appreciably more disappointing and contradictory results. Hewitt et al29 showed that paromomycin therapy did not result in more partial or complete clinical responses than placebo and concluded that paromomycin was ineffective in treating symptomatic cryptosporidial diarrheal disease. An earlier study by White et al30 reported that paromomycin might result in some clinical improvements in patients with AIDS cryptosporidial diarrhea, but these improvements were short lived and associated with a high relapse rate, approaching 33% once therapy was discontinued. Unfortunately, there are no trials comparing paromomycin and nitazoxanide therapies directly. Thus, paromomycin might have some efficacy in treating symptomatic cryptosporidial diarrhea, but it appears to be less consistent than nitazoxanide and does not always lead to a sustained response.",

Clarithromycin, octreotide, and atovaquone all have been tried, with limited success.31, 32 On the horizon, a combination of paromomycin plus azithromycin,33 as well as using rifaximin23, 34, 35 alone, have shown encouraging results in improving symptoms and decreasing cryptosporidial oocyte excretion, especially in HIV patients refractory to other therapies. Thus, current evidence strongly supports the use of HAART (with a protease inhibitor as part of the regimen) as initial therapy for patients with cryptosporidiosis; HAART clearly has shown persistent clinical effects and the ability to cure parasite infections in many HIV-infected patients. For patients who continue to have severe diarrheal disease despite HAART and improved CD4+ T-cell function the addition of nitazoxanide therapy should be considered; however, nitazoxanide therapy alone is inappropriate without HAART.36\n",

Some success has been achieved with albendazole, although pathogen suppression is incomplete and inconsistent.46 Fumagillin, an antibiotic with anti-angiogenic properties, showed encouraging results in early studies in improving HIV symptoms and fecal clearance of the organism.47 Unfortunately, high rates of bone marrow toxicity have limited the use of this drug within the United States and it has never received Food and Drug Administration approval. Consequently, an analogue, TNP-470, was developed, but showed success only in in vivo and in vitro studies and has not made its way to human clinical trials for the treatment of Enterocytozoon bieneusi.48 A host of other agents either have had limited success or disappointing results. Studies of these potential agents are limited by the fact that their efficacy was shown only in case reports or a small series of patients, or only in in vitro or in vivo studies. These therapies include nitazoxanide, atovaquone, itraconazole, metronidazole, octreotide, thalidomide, and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole.43 Overall, once the diagnosis of microsporidium is confirmed, treatment should begin promptly with combination HAART as well as electrolyte replacement and symptom management. Encephalitozoan intestinalis can be treated successfully with albendazole, although at the moment there is no available effective therapy in the United States for Enterocytozoon bieneusi.",

These organisms usually are rare, geographically distinct, and mostly occur when disease is disseminated. Fungal OIs that may be encountered in the United States include histoplasmosis and cryptococcosis. In many cases, GI signs and symptoms are obscured by widespread infection (usually of the pulmonary or central nervous systems); it is unusual for these infections to be localized specifically to the GI tract, although this has been reported.49, 50 Given the strong interaction between systemic disease and GI involvement, the mainstay of therapy for these infections focuses on treatment for disseminated disease. GI and systemic infections are similar in that they are treated originally with an induction phase to control clinical signs followed by a prolonged maintenance phase for relapse prevention. Commonly, amphotericin B (either the deoxycholate or liposomal formulation) is used in the induction phase followed by maintenance therapy either with fluconazole or itraconazole. Long-term maintenance therapy could be required for patients not on HAART or with persistently low CD4+ T-cell counts. Lastly, it is important to treat GI OIs by restoring the patient's immune system with HAART.",

This time frame for therapy can vary and patients should be monitored for signs of clinical improvement to determine the length of treatment time required. Clinical trials support the use of either ganciclovir or foscarnet as initial treatment54, 55; an open, randomized study of patients with CMV GI disease treated with either foscarnet or ganciclovir showed that either drug led to similar improvements in clinical symptoms, resolution of endoscopic findings, and disappearance of inclusion bodies on biopsy.56 Although a subsequent maintenance regimen is required therapy for CMV retinitis, there is debate about continued maintenance therapy for patients with GI CMV. Relapse rates of 9 weeks to 1 year for CMV GI tract disease have been reported fueling this controversy, but limited studies have shown no benefit for maintenance therapy.56 Maintenance therapy is considered if patients continue to have symptoms despite a complete course of therapy or if a patient has recurring disease. The need for maintenance therapy may be negated with the introduction of HAART to the patient's medication regimen. AIDS patients with CMV retinitis on HAART have been shown to have fewer relapses, continued CMV viral suppression, and in most cases have been able to discontinue maintenance therapy completely.57 All of these factors, coupled with improved survival, point to HAARTs integral position in the treatment of CMV infection of the GI tract. The appropriate time for initiating HAART in patients with GI CMV disease is a source of controversy. Unfortunately, there are limited data available on this subject. Given the theoretical risk of developing immune reconstitution syndrome many clinicians advocate delaying HAART until the acute symptoms of disease resolve with CMV therapy. Conversely, some clinicians argue that starting HAART alone in patients with mild to moderate CMV GI disease is a safe and reasonable first step rather than initially starting with directed CMV therapy. Once again, data on this therapeutic strategy are lacking.37 The timing of HAART and/or CMV therapy should be made after careful consideration of the patient's clinical status as well as communicating with the patient's primary HIV physician about potential HAART initiation.",

Encouraging evidence for the treatment of CMV retinitis58 and CMV disease in solid organ transplantation59 has prompted some physicians to consider using it as initial therapy. Given this indirect evidence some societies have recommended the use of oral valganciclovir for therapy unless symptoms prevent a patient from taking oral medications and/or if symptoms are severe enough to result in intestinal malabsorption and thus decrease drug bioavailability.37 Lastly, there are limited data on approaches to patients with treatment failures for GI CMV; again, the majority of studies on this topic deal with CMV retinitis.

With the introduction of HAART as well as prophylaxis, the incidence and prevalence of disseminated MAC has decreased.62 Over the years, MAC treatment has evolved into a multidrug course of antibiotics with a prolonged, and at times indefinite, period of therapy. Initial, first-line treatment for MAC consists of 2 antibiotics: clarithromycin and ethambutol. Each agent alone has high rates of drug resistance, whereas a combination of the 2 results in complete microbiologic response, lower relapse rates, improved clinical symptoms, and overall better survival.63, 64 The addition of a third agent, rifabutin, has shown increased survival times, with the added benefit of less resistance and also can be added to the earlier-described treatment armamentarium.65 Lastly, the 2008 National Institutes of Health/Centers for Disease Control/HIV Medicine Association of the Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines recommend the addition of either injectable amikacin or streptomycin to therapy for patients at high risk of death from MAC, which include patients with CD4+ T-cell counts of 50 cells/\u03bcL or less, high mycobacterial loads, or in the absence of HAART.37 Unfortunately, MAC treatment is lifelong or until immune function has improved with HAART. Many clinicians and societies advocate delaying the initiation of HAART (in a patient who is HAART-naive) until a few weeks after MAC therapy has begun. The goal in delaying HAART therapy is several-fold and includes reducing drug interactions, increasing medication compliance, and avoiding complications of the immune reconstitution syndrome (for a more thorough review of the immune reconstitution syndrome and its role in MAC therapy as well as other opportunistic infections please see the 2008 National Institutes of Health/Centers for Disease Control/HIV Medicine Association/Infectious Diseases Society of America TB treatment guidelines for OI infections).37, 66, 67 Lastly, newer adjuvant regimens consisting of interferon-\u03b3 injections in pulmonary MAC patients have had promising results. The addition of interferon-\u03b3 results in higher response rates, earlier improvement in symptoms, and significantly less disease-related deaths compared with the current standard of care.68 Unfortunately, there have not been any clinical trials to test the effects of interferon-\u03b3 in patients with disseminated MAC.",

The decision to perform a complete GI evaluation, consisting of upper endoscopy, small-bowel biopsies, and colonoscopy with biopsies, must be made in conjunction with the patient and their primary care providers. Given the innumerable endoscopic modalities available in gastroenterology and the sophistication of most pathology laboratories, there is little reason to avoid or refuse invasive diagnostic testing in patients who could benefit from targeted therapy.",

The overall clinical response rates to subcutaneous octreotide range from 25% to 40% in most studies. In our study of 129 patients who had extensive investigations of their refractory diarrhea, one third of patients ultimately were found to have Cryptosporidium infections, again highlighting how important this organism is in the development of refractory diarrhea. Nearly one third of the patients in this study had true idiopathic diarrhea in which no pathogen was identified by stool studies or by endoscopic examination. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, patients were assigned randomly to groups that were given octreotide 100 mcg, 200 mcg, or 300 mcg, or placebo 3 times a day. At the end of the trial, there were arithmetic, but not statistically significant, differences between the groups. Patients with idiopathic diarrhea appeared to fare better than those with an identifiable pathogen, although the difference was not statistically significant. In patients who were given octreotide, 45% had achieved control of their diarrheal symptoms, compared with 33% of the placebo group. Nor was there a significant difference between groups with respect to stool frequency during the double-blind phase. When the trial was extended to 8 weeks during an open-label phase (Figure 5), there was a significant reduction in stool weight between weeks 1 and 8. With respect to stool frequency, there was no difference observed between the groups given octreotide and those given placebo during the controlled trial, but when the trial was extended during the open-label phase, and the patient data were compared with their own baseline statistics, there was a significant decrease in stool frequency.78\n",

Investigations should occur early in the disease course and include a careful medical history and physical examination, as well as stool studies, basic laboratory analyses of infection, nutritional status, and electrolyte derangements, and potentially more-invasive endoscopic and radiographic evaluations. The etiology of AIDS refractory diarrhea is vast and can encompass the same spectrum of chronic diarrheal diseases that inflict non\u2013HIV-infected patients as well as other etiologies such as infections and medications that are specific to HIV or immunocompromised patients. An interesting entity known as AIDS enteropathy has emerged and evolved over the years and reflects an idiopathic, pathogen-negative diarrhea whose underlying cause might involve undiscovered infectious pathogen(s), inflammatory changes within the GI tract caused by HIV or other environmental/infectious agents, HIV itself, or a complex interplay among any one of these etiologies. AIDS refractory diarrhea can pose diagnostic and treatment challenges. HAART, nutritional supplementation, electrolyte replacements, targeted therapy for specific infections, and alleviation of symptoms are all key elements in the treatment regimen for these patients. The overall care of these challenging patients, from diagnosis to treatment, also involves effective communication and teamwork among a variety of medical and surgical specialties.",
