As communities strive to control infectious outbreaks, the virus continues to cause substantial economic, social, and political disruption. As emergency departments are preparing for increased volume because of infected patients, the closure of non-emergency health-care facilities may further increase inappropriate demand on emergency medical staff. Approximately 77% of all injuryrelated health-care visits in the U.S. are for musculoskeletal injuries 1 , totaling >65 million visits in 2010 and 2011. Thus, to lessen the burden on emergency department personnel, it is vital for continued limited operation of orthopaedic outpatient centers. Additionally, recent government mandates are now excluding medical care and treatment for elective procedures, thus causing ambulatory surgery centers (ASCs) to cease operations for non-urgent orthopaedic-related procedures; however, for certain pathologies, inability to operate or failure to recognize injuries that are \"surgically necessary\" may result in serious long-term health consequences, including neurological, vascular, and joint morbidity.",

Elective or non-urgent cases have been reported to be those for which there would be no anticipated short or long-term negative impact in delaying the procedure 3 . Surgical necessity in the context of the current pandemic can be defined as urgent pathologies that could lead to long-term disability and/or chronic pain if acute surgical treatment is delayed.

As reported, there is a current critical shortage of PPE, and thus the priority remains to secure adequate PPE for front-line medical professionals 5 . As the supply chain is mobilized and front-line demand is met, ASCs could be resupplied. This would allow ASCs to then unload the burden of outpatient cases from larger facilities. Critical aspects of the virus, such as the reproductive number, morbidity, and mortality, must be established to determine allocation of resources, including the use of outpatient surgery centers. The initial response to a pandemic will evolve and thus the evaluation around the allocation and utilization of health-care resources must be a dynamic process. The manner in which resources are utilized in the initial phases could potentially be different from that in latter phases.",

In particular for this COVID-19 crisis, outpatient surgical procedures that are scheduled for inpatient facilities should be considered for rescheduling to outpatient facilities whenever possible in order to minimize asymptomatic individuals being exposed to facilities that have relatively higher levels of exposure to COVID-19 (e.g., hospitals). In addition, limiting visitors to all but minor patients, the mentally/physically disabled, and elderly patients who require assistance should be performed. Furthermore, to help reduce the likelihood of disease transmission, ASCs should institute additional measures to maximize patient safety, such as the administration of appropriate screening tests (e.g., travel history and/or history of recent illness), body temperature, respiratory symptoms, and screening of staff for signs of illness or other risk factors until an accurate and highly sensitive rapid test for the diagnosis of COVID-19 illness or antibodies is available. We recommend that each outpatient facility should follow protective guidelines for staff during procedures and ensure that all who are present during intubation and extubation have access to appropriate PPE, including N95 masks, and ensure that terminal cleaning of all operating rooms and equipment be performed between cases.",

It is also important to be forward-thinking and clearly define those patients who could suffer long-term consequences if a surgical procedure is postponed. Currently, although there are recommendations on which surgical procedures to avoid and which are emergencies (such as fractures, vascular compromise, compartment syndrome, and infection), there are no clear recommendations on which procedures should be considered important enough to be performed in outpatient centers because of the long-term negative impact that a delayed procedure could pose to these patients. A rationale and data-driven process to assess and communicate which procedures should be allowed to be performed is essential. In order to both limit orthopaedic surgical procedures and best manage healthcare resources during this public health emergency, detailed criteria are needed to indicate which patients are deemed necessary candidates for acute surgical treatment for elective procedures.

The decision must then be determined by the assessment of the real risk of proceeding or delaying, the availability of the facility and resources, the safety of the community in the particular region, and the regulations dictated by the local authorities. On the other hand, if the lockdown periods are extended, it might be prudent to consider fewer restrictions on elective procedures for low-risk individuals, which might allow those who are currently restricted from work or unemployed the opportunity to have and recover from these procedures and be better ready to reenter the work force when the governing bodies release restrictions. Not allowing these low-risk patients the opportunity to have a surgical procedure sooner would result in further delays in return to work.",
