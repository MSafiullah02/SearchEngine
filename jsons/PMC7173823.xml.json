Leaders from around the world have escalated from states of reluctant acceptance to states of emergency. Unlike historical pandemics, such as the 1918 H1N1 pandemic, COVID-19 is spreading across a highly connected world, in which virtually all individuals are linked to each other through the mobile phone in their pockets. Because of strict physical distancing measures, people are heavily reliant on maintaining connectivity using global digital social networks, such as Facebook or Twitter, to facilitate human interaction and information sharing about the virus. In what follows, we discuss some ways in which social media has undermined effective responses to COVID-19. We consider how various groups could respond to these challenges\u2014especially government leaders, social media companies, and health-care providers. Ultimately, these actors each have roles to play in preventing social media from being weaponised to sow distrust and further endanger public health, while also ensuring that social media can fulfill its essential civic function of facilitating good faith political expression and discourse.",

Users increasingly see trusted individuals within their peer networks who support production and exchange of valued information as authoritative sources of information. As that information is further disseminated, it often increases in its perceived legitimacy. This method of sharing and validating information contrasts with methods more directly controlled by intermediaries (eg, traditional media), who have specialised knowledge and specific responsibilities related to information verification and sharing.1 This model of information sharing has become a driving feature of how public information related to health and medicine is produced and disseminated. In the COVID-19 pandemic, individuals are, not surprisingly, turning to this new digital reality for guidance.",

As such, what qualifies as misinformation will be sensitive to new scientific discoveries and insights, making it in turn, harder to eliminate misinformation. That is, distinguishing misinformation from legitimate information is, at present, a moving target. The stakes are exceptionally high. With the scale and reach of the pandemic increasing exponentially, there is an urgent need to establish practices to effectively disseminate current, accurate information and quickly identify and root out outdated guidance or misinformation.",

Social media companies have committed to regulate content in light of the pandemic.7 Eliminating misinformation can help social media users gather and disseminate accurate information, helping them stay safe and reduce risk to others. Emerging tools, including crowd intelligence-based misinformation detection, can support social media platforms to root out misinformation.8 A more ambitious role for social media platforms would be to boost efforts by public health authorities by, for example, upranking links to recommendations from recognised health authorities, and downranking ads for essential limited medical supplies, such as face masks, to prevent hoarding.",

Members of the lay public might try to identify the most seemingly qualified member of their close network as a trusted resource to vet information. These individuals might feel unequipped to respond effectively to misinformation that individuals are exposed to on social media. To dispel myths, one strategy for the lay public and trusted sources of information (ie, epidemiologists) is inoculation. Inoculation, in this sense, focuses on strengthening a person's attitudes and opinions to protect them from misinformation.10 For example, a common myth circulating on social media is that COVID-19 was engineered in a lab. By affirming the proliferation of misinformation about COVID-19, one can also point to the use of conspiracy theory rhetoric. Such rhetoric characteristically suggests unsubstantiated links and invokes themes of unseen nefarious networks that act behind the scenes of the pandemic. Because of the ubiquitous nature of misinformation related to COVID-19, all members of these broad digital social networks (including government agencies, social media companies, health-care providers, and the consumers or propagators of information themselves) share in the responsibility to help address the broader implications of this pandemic and the underlying infodemic to strengthen community resiliency.",
