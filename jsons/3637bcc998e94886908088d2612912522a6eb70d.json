As of this writing, over 1.8 million cases have been diagnosed in the world and the incidence continues to rise. 1 As a result, healthcare facilities in many areas are becoming or have already become resource-constrained. Locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer (LA-NSCLC) continues to be diagnosed, many patients are symptomatic at the time of diagnosis, and patients may suffer from progression of their disease if initiation of treatment is delayed. Patients must be made aware that LA-NSCLC is a life-threatening disease that requires treatment, while both the workup and treatment may increase their risk of exposure to COVID-19. Cancer therapies can lead to prolonged immunocompromised states that may affect the probability of severe infection-related morbidities and mortality. Patients require multiple visits to healthcare facilities that put them at high risk for COVID-19. As such, an urgent need has emerged to consider alternative management options that may save lives.",

Surgical care may entail multiple cycles of induction chemotherapy followed by perioperative care that requires hospitalization and carries high risks for patients and healthcare staff. Standard of care non-operative management is concurrent chemoradiotherapy, generally administered over 6 weeks with daily radiation and weekly or every 3 weeks chemotherapy followed by 12 months of durvalumab delivered every 2 weeks. According to preliminary data from China and Italy, cancer, along with other comorbidities, may increase the mortality from COVID-19. However, a lot of uncertainty remains as the observations may be the result of malignancy, treatment effects, or both. [8] [9] [10] [11] These reports were retrospective, evaluated small cohorts, and had methodological limitations which are to be expected during a pandemic. Yet, they provide a reason for pause in the way we manage patients with LA-NSCLC during this pandemic given the potential consequences of viral related pneumonia, acute respiratory distress, and sepsis that can occur in patients undergoing treatment for LA-NSCLC. Particularly as emerging data demonstrates a mortality rate of around 10% for hospitalized COVID-19 patients and 50% mortality for those requiring ICU admission. 12, 13 Meanwhile, alternative treatment strategies for patients with LA-NSCLC, as discussed below, offer opportunities to mitigate risks of harm by reducing patient exposures to healthcare facilities and the immunocompromising effects of treatment. Though there are some early theories that immunomodulation may be beneficial for those with COVID-19 infections, [14] [15] [16] immunosuppression may increase the risks of secondary infections in addition to COVID-19. The risks of making these changes likely have minimal impacts on overall survival and should be weighed against the risk of death and disability from developing COVID-19, though they are not supported by clinical trial evidence.",

At this time, a pathological diagnosis of malignancy should be sufficient to initiate treatment for LA-NSCLC. There is no evidence at this time from any study that a repeat biopsy for further subtyping, or determination of a specific oncogenic mutation affects management. The priority to stage the mediastinum with bronchoscopy and/or mediastinoscopy should be balanced against the risk to patients and staff as these procedures may increase the risk of contracting COVID-19 due to aerosolization. 17, 18 The availability of invasive staging procedures may ultimately be limited since pulmonologists and surgeons are increasingly needed for critical care services, operating room time may be unavailable, and therefore initiation of treatment should not be delayed if these procedures cannot be performed in a timely manner. Nodal staging by imaging has relatively high accuracy and can be an appropriate substitute at this time. [19] [20] [21] Positron emission tomography with 2-deoxy-2-[fluorine-18]fluoro-D-glucose integrated with computed tomography (18F-FDG-PET/CT) scans have high sensitivity for occult regional and distant disease and can also help define treatment targets for radiation therapy planning. 22 Acquisition of PET/CT images requires considerably more time (hours) in radiology departments than contrast-enhanced CT (minutes) and the limitations of each should be considered. In the event that PET/CT staging is not available, staging can be performed by CT alone by categorizing any mediastinal lymph node > 1 cm on short-axis diameter as positive and therefore should be targeted with radiation therapy. 23, 24 However, patients who are staged without an 18F-FDG-PET/CT should be informed that CT alone is not as sensitive or specific. Ultimately, all LA-NSCLC cases should be carefully reviewed with a radiologist for input on the malignant appearance of lymph nodes and opinions on defining radiotherapy treatment targets if non-surgical managements are pursued. In the absence of pathological mediastinal staging, radiation oncologists should consider targeting all hypermetabolic (or enlarged on CT scan) lymph nodes with definitive doses.",

Surgical decisions are typically guided by careful patient-centered risk-benefit assessments, but currently healthcare resource allocation and risk to the treatment team must be included in that challenging decision. The Centers for Disease Control, American College of Surgeons, and numerous government agencies have recommended cancellation of elective surgery during the global pandemic and creation of a tiered system for prioritization of other surgical procedures. 25, 26 Lung cancer resections fall into the scope of Medically Necessary Time Sensitive (MeNTS) procedures. 27 For patients with LA-NSCLC who have completed induction therapy, the time sensitivity is particularly crucial, as the window for meaningful and safe surgical intervention typically spans over a 4 to 12 week period. Unfortunately, exposure risks and resource utilization for lung resections are high; they require general anesthesia, manipulation of the aero-digestive tract, and a hospital stay. The decision of whether to proceed with surgery is highly dependent on the current phase of the pandemic at the treating institution. Those in the early phase, where there are adequate healthcare resources, (operating rooms, ventilators, hospital beds, surgeons, and anesthesiologists) may choose to proceed while those in the later stages will have little choice but to defer planned resections. While there is an argument that a brief operative intervention for stage I disease might only require a 1-2 night hospital stay and produce less exposure risk and resource utilization than radiation therapy, the same does not apply for LA-NSCLC where the potential post-induction hilar and mediastinal fibrosis increases the risk for an open procedure (if delayed beyond the \"window of opportunity\"), prolonged hospital stay, and perioperative complications. Early reports of severe COVID-related complications and high post-operative mortality in asymptomatic infected patients undergoing elective operations are sobering, and resources in most communities do not allow for pre-operative screening of asymptomatic patients. 28 If surgery is still to be done, some centers recommend rapid COVID-19 testing and a CT scan immediately prior to surgery to look for early bilateral pulmonary infiltrates, but uniform recommendations do not currently exist. Unfortunately, the accessibility of surgery for lung cancer patients will become more limited over the coming weeks and we need to consider alternative treatment strategies. Most of these patients who would normally have surgical management of their locally advanced lung cancer may instead receive non-surgical management due to constrained resources and risks associated with perioperative management. 29, 30 Therefore, non-operative management of surgically resectable LA-NSCLC patients should be considered at this time during a pandemic.",

The second dilemma relates to the immunocompromising effects of chemotherapy and radiation therapy which may be increased whenever given concurrently 5 days a week for 6 consecutive weeks.

While the overall survival benefits with concurrent chemoradiation versus sequential therapy were established with randomized phase III data, the absolute benefit is modest and may be outweighed by the acute toxicities that could emerge and be more difficult to manage during the pandemic.. 32, 34 Whenever considering sequential therapy, the order of which therapy to initiate first should be based on clinical and situational factors such as patient symptoms, rate of progression of disease, overall disease burden, and available resources, amongst other factors. Upfront radiation therapy should be considered whenever tumors are either causing or likely to cause symptoms due to the presence of hilar disease, bronchial/vascular compression, atelectasis, pulmonary symptoms, and pneumonia. 35 Patients without these features may be best treated with upfront systemic therapy followed by radiotherapy alone or chemoradiotherapy.

            "text": "Durvalamab 10 mg/kg q2 weeks is now routinely employed following chemoradiotherapy based on the phase III PACIFIC trial which demonstrated substantial improvement in overall survival (HR = 0.68). In that study, 25.3% of patients received induction chemotherapy followed by chemoradiation therapy before receiving durvalumab. 36 Patients on the PACIFIC trial received concurrent chemoradiation, and the use of sequential chemotherapy and radiation followed by durvalumab is currently being investigated on the PACIFIC 6 trial. 37 Following radiotherapy and chemotherapy, consideration can be made to deliver durvalumab at a dose of 1500 mg every 4 weeks since this is a schedule that has been used in other trials. [38] [39] [40] Per the PACIFIC trial, administration of durvalumab can be given up to 6 weeks after chemoradiation. The course of the COVID-19 pandemic is projected to peak at a certain point with the highest number of new cases per day and then decelerate. The goal is to minimize exposure during this peak while treating patients with daily radiation when there is less risk of exposure. Sequential therapy with systemic therapy followed by hypofractionated radiation may accomplish this. Patients treated with sequential therapy could be treated with a hypofractionated schedule with treatment courses as short as 3 weeks. Multiple studies have demonstrated such an approach to be safe and effective. [41] [42] [43] Shorter courses have been associated with decreased immunosuppression in other cancers such as leukemia and pancreatic cancer. [44] [45] [46] This may offer advantages for LA-NSCLC, although the primary benefit during a pandemic is to minimize the number of encounters. Approaches employing 15 and 20 fraction schedules preceded the current pandemic and have already been demonstrated to be safe and effective. For those who have access to a proton facility, protons can be used for hypofractionated lung radiation. 47 Hypofractionated courses can be delivered with either induction or adjuvant chemotherapy or chemoimmunotherapy. Some centers are comfortable with treating with concurrent chemotherapy and hypofractionated therapy, though other centers have concerns for increased late toxicity. Standard chemotherapy schedules can be referenced in evidence-based guidelines such as those found in the National Cancer Network Guidelines with consideration of schedules that minimize the frequency of visits to a healthcare institution. 48 Table 2 summarizes commonly used hypofractionated schedules for locally advanced lung cancer. The use of intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) techniques is encouraged for hypofractionation as it can minimize the volume of normal tissues exposed to the prescription dose. Whenever normal organ dose constraints cannot be met during hypofractionated radiotherapy treatment planning, radiation oncologists should consider delivering the full prescription dose to the gross tumor volume (GTV) and a planning treatment volume (PTV) margin while reducing the dose prescribed to the clinical treatment volume (CTV) and a PTV margin. This can be often achieved with IMRT using a simultaneous integrated boost technique. 49 Regarding the definition of radiation treatment volumes, we urge our colleagues to avoid elective lymph node irradiation which is an outdated approach to the radiotherapeutic management of LA-NSCLC. [50] [51] [52] The extension of target volumes to include even one nodal stage superiorly and/or inferiorly increases the risk of treatment-related immunosuppression and pneumonitis that may mask early symptoms of COVID-19. If contouring nodal stations with CT alone, radiation oncologists should consider including any lymph nodes > 1 cm in the short-axis (not greatest dimension). Also, daily image guidance using conebeam CT may help to assess development of infiltrates in asymptomatic patients. 53 If there is a preference to deliver concurrent chemoradiation, then induction chemotherapy may be considered to delay the time to when patients need to come in for daily chemoradiotherapy treatments. Results from randomized phase II and III trials support such an approach after having compared chemoradiotherapy with or without induction chemotherapy and shown similar survival rates. [54] [55] [56] While the use of induction chemotherapy prolongs the total length of treatment, it offers an opportunity at this time to delay initiation of chemoradiotherapy which requires daily visits at facilities that may soon be resource-constrained.",

            "text": "Once a patient with LA-NSCLC develops COVID-19, specific patient and treatment factors should be considered before the difficult decision is made to hold or continue therapy. These factors include patient symptoms, status and growth rate of NSCLC, and available resources within the healthcare facility, among other factors. There is currently no data supporting proceeding with or withholding treatment based on COVID-19 status, presence of symptoms, or severity of symptoms. If a patient has a significant obstruction, hemoptysis, or other symptoms that may be alleviated by oncologic treatment, it may be necessary to treat regardless of the status of COVID-19 symptoms. This may be radiotherapy alone. The use of concurrent chemotherapy is unlikely to be of benefit given the potential to result in myelosuppression, esophagitis and pneumonitis and should only be considered if reduction of a large mass is necessary to alleviate acute pulmonary compromise. However, patients with severe symptoms should not receive any cancer therapies until they recover. For patients with mild to no symptoms from COVID-19 infections, treatment strategies such as strict personal protective equipment use for patients and staff, physical separation of infected and uninfected patients, and frequent and robust sanitation of equipment should be implemented. For all patients receiving radiotherapy, it may be ideal to use separate waiting rooms, changing facilities, and different machines if possible. Treating patients with COVID-19 at the end of the day and thoroughly cleaning all facilities may also limit the spread of the virus. These strategies have been described in depth in reports from China, Italy and the United States of America. [57] [58] [59] [60] Management of the patient who tests positive for COVID-19 and is asymptomatic is more difficult. They may be considered physiologically unfit to tolerate any further lung cancer therapies as many patients develop worsening symptoms in the second week of infection. 61 The influence of active treatment for lung cancer on COVID-19 infection is unknown at this time. As such, a 1-2 week waiting period can help confirm whether the patient develops any viral-related symptoms. Early studies have shown that COVID-19 can lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome with pathological changes such as destruction of the alveoli and cellular fibromyxoid exudates. 62, 63 These pathologic changes may lead to prolonged injury of lung tissue, even after clearing the viral infection. COVID-19 can also lead to an increase in inflammatory biomarkers which have been correlated with severity of morbidity. 64 Similarly, serum inflammatory cytokines have been shown to be predictive of both thoracic toxicity and survival following thoracic radiotherapy. [65] [66] [67] [68] [69] While these data raise concerns, we are not entirely sure how they can manifest in patients with COVID-19 as the data on this pandemic are still emerging and the degree of morbidity seen has been variable. For some patients, the effects of the virus and lung cancer therapies may simultaneously damage pulmonary tissue and increase the chance of pneumonitis. At the same time, these risks should be carefully weighed to avoid treatment delays or interruptions whenever possible given that improperly treated lung cancer can lead to worse oncologic outcomes. 31 In the absence of actual clinical data, a reasonable approach would be to re-test asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic COVID-19 patients in 14 days and initiate therapy if they are both asymptomatic and test negative. If a patient becomes symptomatic and tests positive during concurrent or sequential chemoradiotherapy, it is probably appropriate to temporarily halt treatment and wait until resolution of symptoms due to COVID-19. In the event of hospitalization, it is important that the treating oncologic team be in communication with the inpatient team regarding the possibility of confusing the radiologic findings of radiation pneumonitis, immunotherapy pneumonitis and COVID-19. Resumption of treatment after symptomatic COVID-19 infection is likely to be very difficult given the severe impairment experienced by many patients.",

Multidisciplinary tumor board reviews should continue to be held for all patients, even remotely if needed at this time. This ensures thoughtful reviews for each and every case with input from radiologists as mentioned above. It also affords an opportunity for medical oncologists to discuss the risks and benefits of different systematic treatment approaches in the context of COVID-19 risk and allows radiation oncologists to describe the rationale for alternative treatment schedules. Clinicians also need to have careful and informative conversations with each patient regarding any deviations from the standard of care. Topics such as risks, benefits, and reasoning for these deviations must be explained so that they can have a proper understanding of the trajectory of their care. The wishes of the patient must also be factored into how each patient is managed. Patients should also be counseled to self-isolate during treatment to reduce the risk of infection to themselves and other cancer patients.",

Educating our colleagues and citing evidence may be helpful, such as pointing to recent results from the PACIFIC trial demonstrating 3 year overall survival of 66% in patients with LA-NSCLC in patients treated with chemoradiotherapy and consolidation durvalumab. 71 Healthcare administrators and colleagues taking care of these acutely ill patients on the front line may be largely unaware of recent advances in lung cancer care and the opportunity for long-term survival in all lung cancer patients regardless of stage.

Standard of care strategies with surgery, radiation therapy, and systemic therapies can take a long time to deliver and expose patients to multiple visits to healthcare facilities. Patients who are confirmed to have COVID-19 should be considered to have their cancer therapies withheld until they are fully recovered. However, the initiation of treatment for patients without an infection should not be delayed. The alternative treatment strategies that are presented in this report can reduce risk and should be considered for each patient while the global pandemic persists. There are little data and the consequences of modifications to the standard of care are not fully known. Some surgical, radiation, and medical oncology practices may be currently operating in geographic locations that have not yet been hit by this pandemic. However, with this pandemic having reached across the globe, the authors urge all oncologists to consider these measures to optimize patient outcomes until this current crisis is over. In the absence of pathological hilar or mediastinal staging treat all hypermetabolic lymph nodes as if they are positive for disease. If CT with contrast was used alone, consider treatment of all lymph nodes > 1 cm in short axis",

Preoperative CT of the chest may help detect asymptomatic carriers of SARS-CoV-2 prior to surgeryNon-operative management of LA-NSCLC may be utilized Chemoradiation Consider sequential chemoradiation If using sequential therapy, the decision of whether to pursue systemic therapy or radiation first will depend on clinical factors and available resources Consider induction systemic therapy Consider durvalumab after concurrent or sequential chemoradiation If utilizing durvalumab after chemoradiation, consider q4 week dosing or delaying initiation of durvalumab (within 42 days) Radiation techniques Utilize IMRT with a hypofractionated schedule Elective nodal coverage is not needed and may increase toxicity",
