Mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSCs) demonstrate beneficial effects in diverse pre-clinical lung injury models including pulmonary [4\u20136] and abdominal sepsis [7\u20139], bleomycin-induced acute lung injury [10] and fibrosis [11, 12]. Human-derived MSCs (hMSCs) enhance injury resolution following established VILI [13, 14], enhance recovery of human lungs ex vivo [15] and reduce the severity of Escherichia coli pneumonia [16]. Finally, recent phase 1\u20132 studies suggest that allogeneic bone marrow-derived hMSCs (BM-hMSCs) can be safely administered to patients with moderate to severe ARDS [17, 18].",

Xenogeneic culture-free (XF) supplements such as the recently patented XF supplement (WO2015121471 A1) have been developed that preserve the differentiation, proliferation and low immunogenicity properties of MSCs [26].

We wished to test the hypothesis that pre-activation of cryopreserved, XF-hMSCs would enhance their efficacy after delayed administration in a relevant preclinical model of VILI injury and repair and to investigate the mechanisms underlying these effects. In vitro studies examined the potential for naive and cytokine pre-activated XF-hMSC-conditioned medium (CM) to attenuate pulmonary epithelial stretch-induced injury. In vivo experiments examined the potential for cytokine pre-activation to enhance the efficacy of (fresh and cryopreserved) XF-hMSCs to enhance resolution when administered at therapeutically relevant time points following the development of VILI. Subsequent mechanistic experiments examined the potential for the pulmonary epithelial reparative effects of XF-hMSCs to be mediated in part via KGF present in the MSC secretome.",

IL-8 secretion from naive or pre-activated hMSCs, before and after freezing (24 and 48 h post-cryopreservation), was determined using an IL-8 sandwich ELISA DuoSet kit (R&D Systems Inc., Minneapolis, MN, USA) to confirm the responsive state persisted post-thaw (Additional file 1: Figure S1).

The alternative, namely provision of freshly cultured hMSC, would require that hMSCs are continuously available for harvest, in facilities adjacent to the clinical settings, which presents substantial logistical and economic challenges. Other challenges include the risk of increased cell batch variability and the potential for contamination of batches. However, several studies demonstrate that the cryopreservation and thawing processes may significantly reduce the efficacy of hMSCs [19, 40]. Our finding that cryopreserved XF-hMSCs can enhance the resolution of VILI when administered at therapeutically relevant time points in our rodent model supports recent findings in other models, including pneumonia-induced ARDS [41], and are important demonstrations of the feasibility of cryopreservation of hMSCs. This insight is further supported by the observation that the secretory profile of hMSCs in regard to IL-8 release, whether the hMSCs were pre-activated or not, remained the same pre- and post-cryopreservation.",

            "text": "Conventional culture and passage of MSCs requires the use of xenogeneic supplements to aid cell growth and replication, which includes the use of FBS that contains large amounts of growth factors [42]. However, the risks posed by the use of animal products in the culture medium of hMSCs intended ultimately for use in humans have been highlighted by the European Medicines Agency and US Food and Drug Administration [21]. Concerns include the risk of contamination or immunogenicity [22\u201325]. XF culture supplements would resolve these concerns. It has proven challenging to identify alternatives to FBS that maintain comparable growth conditions for MSCs and that do not adversely alter cell efficacy [42]. The recently patented XF supplement (WO2015121471 A1) has been demonstrated to preserve the differentiation, proliferation and low immunogenicity properties of MSCs [26]. Our finding that hMSCs cultured in this XF supplement retain the capacity to enhance the resolution of injury in our preclinical model of rodent VILI and maintain the secretome efficacy in attenuating pulmonary epithelial injury induced by cyclic stretch, and promoting wound healing in vitro, are important demonstrations of the therapeutic potential of XF-cultured hMSCs.",

This study demonstrated that the secretome of XF-hMSCs protected the pulmonary alveolar epithelium from injurious cyclic stretch and also demonstrates that pre-activation with inflammatory cytokines enhanced secretome efficacy (Additional file 1: Figure S1 and Additional file 2: Figure S2). These findings were also true for the enhancement of wound healing. We further went on to show that KGF neutralization can negate the enhancement observed as a result of cytokine pre-activation. These outcomes extend findings from previous in vitro and in vivo studies showing that the MSC secretome resolved the inflammatory response and promoted repair and recovery post-VILI [13, 33] and thus strengthens the justification for the use of the secretome as a viable alternative therapy against VILI. However, it should be noted that the secretome may be less effective compared to hMSCs, especially in the early phases of the injury resolution process [46].",

First, while we provide data to demonstrate that pre-activation of cryopreserved XF hMSCs enhances their ability to promote injury resolution following VILI and the ability of their secretome to reduce stretch injury and promote pulmonary epithelial wound repair, these studies were carried out in a rodent model and in vitro, and caution must be exercised in extrapolating to the clinical situation. However, we have used a clinically relevant injury resolution VILI model and utilized human MSCs. Thus, these findings strongly suggest that the therapeutic potential of cryopreserved XF-hMSCs for human ARDS may be enhanced by pre-activation measures. Second, we did not use a control non-stem cell group, such as a fibroblast group. In our previous experiments, rodent fibroblasts had no beneficial effect [35], while in experiments using human fibroblasts in rodents, some parameters indicative of injury were worsened [51]. Therefore, we believe that a fibroblast control is not justifiable for these studies. Our in vitro studies used A549 cells, an adenocarcinoma human alveolar basal cell line. These cells did have the advantage of being a widely used cell line, and they had an integrated NF-\u03baB reporter. Finally, we do not provide data on a single overall mechanism of action of MSCs. Our studies to date [33, 35, 51, 52], and those of other groups [15, 53, 54], indicate that the effects of MSCs on, for example, innate and adaptive immunity, including antimicrobial effects, are varied, context dependent and not encapsulated by a single secreted mediator or group of mediators. Nonetheless, we show that the mechanisms of MSC therapy via their secretome as a whole is enhanced with pre-activation and is partly mediated through KGF.",

FBS-hMSC CM and XF-hMSC CM comparably enhanced wound repair in comparison with the MEM-\u03b1 control (a). Pre-activation of these MSCs further enhanced the ability of the CM to improve wound repair but this was attenuated by KGF neutralization (b). Representative images are provided (c). Note: * and *** = P < 0.05 and 0.001 versus MEM-\u03b1; and $ and $$ = P < 0.05 and 0.01, versus respective naive FBS or XF-hMSC CM; # = P < 0.05 versus respective pre-activated FBS or XF-hMSC CM. 0 h, n = 16; MEM-\u03b1 control, n = 7\u201312; all other groups, n = 4\u20136",
