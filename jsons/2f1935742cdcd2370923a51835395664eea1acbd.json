After partial cystectomy (>50%) and grafting with the bladder acellular matrix graft (BAMG), storage and voiding functions were monitored in 20 rats by means of a specially designed``micturition cage,'' leak-point cystography, and cystometry. After 4 months, sections (n 6) were examined histologically to evaluate regeneration of bladder wall components within the BAMG. Bladder capacity and compliance increased progressively and were signi\u00aecantly higher in the grafted animals than in controls (partial cystectomy only), and volumes per void were signi\u00aecantly higher than in either control or normal animals. At 4 months, the regenerated urothelium, smooth muscle, blood vessels and nerves within the BAMG were qualitatively identical to normal bladder wall. Augmentation cystoplasty with the homologous BAMG leads to morphologic and functional rat bladder regeneration, thus enhancing low-pressure reservoir function and preserving normal micturition.",

To restore or improve the low-pressure reservoir function of the urinary bladder, a great many synthetic and naturally derived biomaterials have been tried over the past century. Synthetic materials have been limited by foreign body-type reactions [5] ; naturally derived materials have often retracted with time [4, 16] ; and the alloplastic prosthetic bladder is still at an investigational stage in animals [11] . In contrast, autoaugmentation cystoplasty with gastrointestinal segments is now widespread because of its urodynamic bene\u00aets, availability and feasibility. The use of gastric, ileal and colonic segments, however, still bears well-known complications such as metabolic abnormalities, rupture, increased mucous production, infection, urolithiasis, osteoporosis, and malignancy [17, 23] . Most of these complications can be attributed to the presence of intestinal mucosa with its original secretory and absorptive function.",

Belonging to this group of biomaterials, the homologous bladder acellular matrix graft (BAMG) has recently been shown to promote complete regeneration of all bladder wall components in the rat [27, 28, 29] . The BAMG-augmented bladders showed complete luminal epithelialization, rapid angiogenesis, perfect spatial reconstruction of detrusor smooth muscle as well as muscularis mucosae, and regeneration of nerve \u00aebers with no signs of scar formation at the site of anastomosis. These results were con\u00aermed by Sutherland et al. [31] with a similarily prepared homologous bladder and gastric acellular tissue matrix in rats. It therefore appears that the BAMG could be a viable alternative to the use of bowel in urinary reconstruction. We designed the present study to investigate further the in vivo storage and voiding functions of the BAMG-regenerated rat bladder.",

In brief, bladders were placed in a 35-mm Petri dish containing 50 ml of 10 mM phosphate-buered saline (PBS, pH 7.0) and 0.1% sodium azide. The mucosa was scraped o with a pair of glass slides. The remaining lamina propria and detrusor muscle were treated with 50 ml of 10 mM PBS-0.1% sodium azide and stirred for 5\u00b16 hours for partial cell lysis. Bladders were then washed with 40 ml of PBS before treatment with 50 ml of 1 M sodium chloride containing 2000 Kunitz units DNase (Sigma, St Louis, Mo.) and stirred for 6\u00b1 8 hours. With this, cell lysis was complete and all the intracellular components were released. The samples were then treated with 50 ml 4% sodium desoxycholate containing 0.1% sodium azide and stirred for 5\u00b16 hours to solubilize the lipid bilayer cell membranes and intracellular membrane lipids; this was repeated once. The resultant BAMG was washed three times with 50 ml PBS and stored in 10% neomycin sulfate at 4\u00b0C until grafted.",

Because rats are nocturnal and about two-thirds of all voids occur at night [9] , micturition patterns were studied for 12 hours overnight. The``micturition cage,'' custom-made for this purpose, was designed as follows: The housing cage, with a metal grid bottom, was placed on a rack over a siliconized cloth (to prevent stool particles from falling into the collecting tray while not hindering free passage of urine). The collecting tray, which covered the entire area under the cage, was suspended by four nylon strings to isometric force displacement transducers (range of detection 0.1 to 65 g of urine). A signal processor supplied the excitation voltage to the transducers and fed the analog force data to an analogto-digital converter, connected to a personal computer.

A signal processor supplied the excitation voltage to the transducer and fed the analog pressure data to an analog-to-digital converter. A personal computer and the LabView software program (National Instruments, Austin, Tex.) were used for data acquisition and saving in spreadsheet format. In male rats open cystometry was performed.

Before the experiments got underway, the pressure transducers with tubing and angiocatheter attached were zeroed to the atmosphere during infusion. Because aspiration of residual urine was hampered by uri-nary calculi in most of the animals, the bladders were gently squeezed manually before each measurement.

Histologic staining of BAMG-regenerated bladders (see Fig. 4 ) showed a bladder wall structure that was qualitatively identical to the host, in conformity with our previous histologic \u00aendings [27, 29] . All three layers of normal rat bladder were present: the inner surface of the grafts was covered by a uniform urothelial lining with a dierentiated muscularis mucosae. Most animals had hyperplastic urothelium in the native bladder and BAMG regenerate, resulting from stone formation. Distinct bundles of well developed, spatially oriented, detrusor smooth muscle were evident throughout the grafted area. The thickness and number of the muscle bundles appeared to decrease towards the central area of the BAMG, however. The number of well-formed smalland large-diameter blood vessels was greater in the BAMG regenerates than in the host bladder. The opposite was true for PGP-positive nerve \u00aebers.

            "text": "The incidence of bladder stone formation was signi-\u00aecant in both the grafted (80%) and control animals (33%), possibly favoring an underestimation of the total and functional bladder capacity values in both groups. The calculi were always free-\u00afoating and never adherent to or incorporated into the graft. Because struvite was the main component, an infectious cause for their formation is likely [25] . As a result of the scraping of the mucosa at the beginning of the matrix preparation process, some of the BAMG \u00aebers could have served as a stone matrix when released during contact with urine. Furthermore, the rugged inner surface of the graft before it was covered by urothelium might have facilitated stone formation, even without urinary infection [31] . These mechanisms may have been relevant factors in the present study, especially since our full-bladder-size BA-MGs had a much larger surface than the patches grafted in other comparable studies [18, 31, 32] . It has been shown, however, that any sort of bladder augmentation surgery in the rat predisposes it to stone formation [13, 18, 21, 31] . In contrast, in our ongoing preliminary studies in the dog, no free-\u00afoating calculi have been seen up to 7 months after BAMG homotransplantation (manuscript in preparation).",
