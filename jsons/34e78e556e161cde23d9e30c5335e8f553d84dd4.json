            "text": "This hybrid of review and personal essay argues that models of visual construction are essential to extend spatial navigation models to models that link episodic memory and imagination. The starting point is the TAM-WG model, combining the Taxon Affordance Model and the World Graph model of spatial navigation. The key here is to reject approaches in which memory is restricted to unanalyzed views from familiar places, and their later recall. Instead, we will seek mechanisms for imagining truly novel scenes and episodes. We thus introduce a specific variant of schema theory and VISIONS, a cooperative computation model of visual scene understanding in which a scene is represented by an assemblage of schema instances with links to lower-level \"patches\" of relevant visual data. We sketch a new conceptual framework for future modeling, Visual Integration of Diverse Multi-Modal Aspects, by extending VISIONS from static scenes to episodes combining agents, actions and objects and assess its relevance to both navigation and episodic memory. We can then analyze imagination as a constructive process that combines aspects of memories of prior episodes along with other schemas and adjusts them into a coherent whole which, through expectations associated with diverse episodes and schemas, may yield the linkage of episodes that constitutes a dream or a narrative. The result is IBSEN, a conceptual model of Imagination in Brain Systems for Episodes and Navigation. The essay closes by analyzing other papers in this Special Issue to assess to what extent their results relate to the research proposed here.",

To see why this is inadequate, imagine [sic] that you often walk down a street and pass a high wall with a door in it.

The phrase \"There was an old woman who lived in a\u2026\" somehow popped into mind. Since I was trying to imagine something new, I consciously inhibited \"shoe\" as the next word. Perhaps because I had just seen an episode of \"The Crown\" in which the Queen rode in a coach lined with red velvet, this image, coupled again with the quest for novelty, yielded the final sentence \"There was an old woman who lived in a coach lined with green velvet.\" Here, I have used words to make explicit this simple feat of imagination. Below, I will focus on visual, rather than linguistic, construction. The point remains that imagination goes far beyond what a VCE theory can explain.

Here I focus on the difference between subway maps and locometric maps. 3 A subway map helps us navigate a city-its nodes represent stations; its colored edges tell us what lines connect one station to the next-yet it has little metric structure. When we descend from the train at a station we re-enter the world of locomotion, so the subway map must be complemented by a space that is \"more metric\" in nature-measuring the world in terms of the actions (walking, swimming, driving, etc., whereby we traverse it. I use the term locometric for this way of measuring space: the animal measures the world in terms of actions (e.g., how many steps taken) or perceived measures of such actions (e.g., the visual effect of an action such as the achievement of a goal). The notion of locometric space is particularly relevant to the notion of path integration, the ability of a wandering animal to keep track of the location of its home base relative to its current position, a capability related to dynamic remapping of the hippocampal map (Guazzelli et al. 2001) .",

            "text": "To pose the problem dramatically for the human brain, consider the Maguire et al. (2006) study comparing London taxi drivers with London bus drivers, who were matched for driving experience and levels of stress, but differed in that taxi drivers had mastered \"the Knowledge\" of all details of London streets, whereas bus drivers follow a constrained set of routes. Taxi drivers had greater gray matter volume in mid-posterior hippocampus and less volume in anterior hippocampus than bus drivers. Furthermore, years of navigation experience correlated with hippocampal gray matter volume only in taxi drivers, with right posterior gray matter volume increasing and anterior volume decreasing with more navigation experience. Maguire et al. conclude that spatial knowledge, and not stress or driving, is associated with the pattern of hippocampal gray matter volume in taxi drivers. They then tested for the ability to acquire new visuo-spatial information by using the Rey-Osterrieth complex figure test-a neuropsychological assessment in which examinees are asked to reproduce a complicated line drawing, first by copying it freehand (recognition), and then drawing from memory (recall)-and found bus drivers performed better than taxi drivers. Maguire et al. speculate that the com-plex spatial representation which facilitates expert navigation might have come at a cost to new spatial memories and gray matter volume in the anterior hippocampus (a very different longitudinal shift from the change of scales offered by Kjelstrup et al.) . However, this may be misleading-perhaps the issue is not reduced ability to form new spatial memories but rather a reduced ability to form complex spatial representations incompatible with the representational system developed in the taxi driver's brain to encode their expert knowledge. For example, Tichomirov and Poznyanskaya (1966) found that master chess players looked at boards for less time than novices and remembered positions more accurately, with the expert turning her gaze from one significant feature of the board to another, while the novice searched randomly. If the pieces are randomly arranged on the board, so that the expert has no meaningful search strategy, her performance on memorizing the board is much like that of the novice. Here, the actions which scan the environment are themselves constrained by the subject's plan of action, the plan to play a winning game of chess. Perhaps analogous considerations apply to the taxi driver's analysis of spatial layouts. We see here the action-perception cycle in full swing-we perceive the environment to the extent that we are prepared to interact with it in some reasonably structured fashion (Arbib 1989) .",

(ii) We observe not only objects but also their affordances. If Google tells us to turn left, we do not immediately execute a 90\u00b0leftward turn but make that turn in relation to the angle at which the left-hand road leads off the current roadway at the next intersection. Figure 1 offers a high-level view of the TAM model (see Guazzelli et al. 1998 , for the computational details). Posterior parietal cortex extracts affordances on the basis of sensory input. (The TAM implementation considers only a limited number of affordances and thus does not limit them to a motivation-relevant subset). The affordances gate the premotor selection of an action. Crucially, TAM includes a learning model that gates this selection in relation to the regnant affordance-e.g., if the rat sees a T-junction, it will learn to turn left or right dependent on its experience of getting food more at one than the other. (Note that this does not involve a cognitive map-the hungry rat's proclivity to turn to the left at T-junctions is no more place-specific than your ability to recognize the affordance of a sign for a Chinese restaurant.) The success or lack of success of the consequences of the action is adjudged by the nucleus accumbens which serves to strengthen or weaken the last acted-upon link depending on whether or not the rat received positive reinforcement. Arbib and Lieblich (1977) , Lieblich and Arbib (1982) not only introduced the notion of the World Graph (WG) but also embedded it in a model for analyzing how rats running mazes can exhibit detour behavior, with their paths depending on their current motivation. But we posit that it is a crucial feature of human cognition, too. In our formalization, a WG (there can be many encoded in a single brain) is a collection of nodes, some of which are connected by (possibly uni-directional) edges:",

Autonomous mechanisms serve, e.g., to increase thirst and hunger over time, while various incentive signals (such as the smell of food) can increase the strength of a drive; drinking decreases the strength of the thirst drive, and so on. The edges provide the actions that let one get from one state to another. However, since the animal's navigation depends on its drive state-it wants to get to places where it can perform consummatory actions, as described by the drive-reduction vector for a node. Thus, if it is hungry, it wants to get to a place where it can eat or, for example, procure food that it might eat elsewhere.",

The full WG model explains the dynamics of each of these; the TAM-WG model expands upon this by linking TAM and WG: At any time, the current node x(t) signals the neighborhood in which the animal finds itself. This signals to the hippocampus to encode (or continue using) a \"locometric chart\" of that neighborhood. As the animal moves, the hippocampus signals current location to the World Graph (WG), posited to be in prefrontal cortex; WG combines this with desired location to plan possible paths. Arbib and Bonaiuto (2012) made explicit how to adapt temporal difference learning (TD, Sutton 1988 ) to \"spatial difference learning\" in WG which makes explicit how the expected reinforcement depends on the current drive state. While WG supplies the data for moving between \"significant places,\" hippocampus supplies the data for moving between \"locometric places.\" Our 1999 model of WG was algorithmic-temporal difference learning operated on nodes and edges of the graph, rather than on neural representations of them. Certainly, as this special issue attests, there are neural models of complex spatial navigation, but is there a biologically plausible neural net model out there that captures all the properties of motivated learning and control of spatial behavior charted in WG? 4 Figure 2 shows the integration of the TAM with the WG model. Now, the posterior parietal affordances can be modulated by knowledge of the animal's whereabouts. Locometric data from HC can update estimates of the current and next node in WG. (The model does not include the switching of WGs and the attendant switching in and out of locometric maps for the current WG or portion thereof.) Spatial difference learning applies at the WG level, but while WG supplies the data for moving between \"significant places,\" hippocampus supplies the data for moving between \"locometric places.\" This may require modeling at two scales, as seen in studies by Strain (1953) and the intriguing twist introduced by Miller (1959) . Strain constructed a linear maze as a chain of boxes connected by passages, and WG represents the maze shown in Fig. 3 (top) . If the animal is repeatedly shocked at F, then, when placed in E it will move to D rather than F, as in the WG model's account of aversive drives like fear.",

Modeling this purely at the WG level would predict that if the food is more attractive (perhaps because the animal is very hungry) than the shock is painful, the rat will always move toward F; in the reverse situation it will move away from F. But what Miller found was that the rat oscillated back and forth between E and F! We could only succeed in modeling this by adding a locometric map of the passageways/edges, with a gradient of attraction (food) or repulsion (shock) that varies with distance from E and F. The key was to posit that each gradient rose continuously from E to F, but that at E the attraction was greater than the repulsion, while at F the reverse was the case. In other words, the appetitive attraction of food as a function of locomotory space in 4 Rather than temporal difference learning, Schmajuk and Thieme (1992) use a vicarious trial and error strategy to find the shortest path using a cognitive map (so that decreasing distance is the only correlate for increased reinforcement). Of course, random exploration is also necessary to provide the data on which TD learning operates. Their paper also makes the point that finding a path in graphs provides a model of many different tasks (as is familiar from GOFAI)-they demonstrate that their method can be applied to problem-solving paradigms such as the Tower of Hanoi puzzle. Strain (1953) ; and (bottom) how the addition of a locometric model can address the data of Miller (1959) E-F remains high at E, whereas the aversive repulsion of fear in E-F is low at E. There is thus a cross-over point X not at the WG-level of the cognitive map but rather at the level of the local \"locometric chart\" current in hippocampus. As a result, the rat runs from E toward F, but on passing X turns tail and runs back toward E, passing X again and reaching a point where hunger overcomes fear and thus ends up oscil-lating between the E and F nodes. In general, the idea is that WG can navigate from one \"significant place\" to another via various intermediates; the locometric space can capture the motion details once a start and end place are selected within the map at that level.",

Before turning to IBSEN's second pillar, the VISIONS model of visual scene understanding, we present a specific video-clips-withextrapolation (VCE) model of memory and recall to serve as a comparison point. Byrne et al. (2007) -henceforth B3-present in their account of \"Remembering the past and imagining the future,\" a strong example of a VCE (video-clips-with-extrapolation) model. In this model, memory is restricted to unanalyzed views along a path, and later recall reactivates a prior view or a small extrapolation of such a view from a prior trajectory-i.e., there is no mechanism for imagining anything particularly new, as suggested by the earlier \"garden door\" scenario. 5 5 Both Susan Becker and Neil Burgess have made many contributions to the study of the hippocampus and its environs. As of December 20, 2019, Google Scholar listed 729 citations of the B3 paper, with B3 assume the location and shape of the firing fields of hippocampal place cells is driven by the activity of a population of boundary vector cells (BVCs), hypothesized to exist within parahippocampal cortex, that show maximal firing when an animal is at a given distance and allocentric direction from an environmental boundary. O' Keefe and Burgess (1996) based this hypothesis on recording from the same cell in four rectangular boxes that differed solely in the length of one or both sides, a far cry from the environments relevant to our autobiographical memory unless we have spent years in solitary confinement. Figure 4 shows an overview of their model, here called the B3 model. The model is restricted to the spatial function of the hippocampus. Hippocampal neurons in the model are associated with a Cartesian grid covering allocentric space such that a given neuron fires maximally when the model is localized at its corresponding grid point. (Caution: B3 are not talking here about grid cells.) This single layer of place cells corresponds to CA3, an area that is heavily recurrently connected. In the model, this recurrent connectivity allows for recall/pattern completion.",

This leaves open the nature of the allocentric map, and I suggest that may be akin to a mini-WG associated with the local environment.

            "text": "The specific variant of schema theory offered here was motivated by a concern for modeling action-oriented perception (Arbib 1972) , inspired in great part by work on visuomotor coordination in frogs and its implication for mammals (Ingle 1968; Ingle et al. 1967; Lettvin et al. 1959) . It was further stimulated by study of the visual control of hand movements (Arbib 1981; Jeannerod et al. 1995; Jeannerod and Biguer 1982) . However, in the following subsection, we abandon action and introduce a schema-theoretic (cooperative computation) model of visual scene understanding (the VISIONS model). As we start to sketch IBSEN, we will outline how VISIONS might be extended to recognize episodes to provide our stepping stone to imagination. In linking function and structure in the brain, we seek to bridge between neurons and the cognition and behavior of the person or animal. My claim is that although, in some cases, we can bridge directly from high-level function to neural networks, in many cases we need intermediate units of functional analysis. To this end I introduce schemas as \"composable programs in the mind,\" but they differ from a serial computer program or neural network in that a schema may have multiple instances that are concurrently active. A schema constitutes the \"long-term memory\" of a perceptual and/or motor skill or more abstract functions, including coordinating such skills; while the process of perception or action is controlled by active copies of schemas, called schema instances. A schema may be instantiated to form multiple schema instances as active copies of the process to apply that knowledge. For example, given a schema that represents generic knowledge about some object, we may need several active instances of the schema, each suitably tuned to subserve our perception of a different instance of that object. For certain behaviors, there may be no distinction between schema and instance-a single neural network may embody the skill memory and provide the processor that implements it. However, in more complex behaviors (as in the VISIONS model), the different mobilizations of a given \"skill-unit\" must be carefully distinguished. A schema assemblage is a network of schema instances, and its characteristics are sim-ilar to that of a single schema if committed to long term memory.",

They embody the processes whereby the system determines whether a given object or domain of interaction is present in the environment.

Each schema instance has an activity level which indicates its current salience for the ongoing computation. If a schema is implemented as a neural network then all the schema parameters would be implemented via patterns of neural activity. It is thus important to distinguish \"activity level\" as a particular parameter of a schema from the \"neural activity\" which will vary with different neural implementations of the schema. The activity level of a perceptual schema signals the credibility of the hypothesis that what the schema represents is indeed present, whereas other schema parameters represent other salient properties such as size, location, and motion of the perceived object.

It is as a result of competition that instances which do not meet the evolving (data-guided) consensus lose activity, and thus are not part of this solution (though their continuing subthreshold activity may well affect later behavior). A schema network does not, in general, need a top-level controller. Schema instances can combine their effects by distributed processes of competition and cooperation (i.e., interactions which, respectively, decrease and increase the activity levels of these instances), rather than the operation of an inference engine on a passive store of knowledge.

Rather, new schemas may be formed as assemblages of old schemas; but once formed a schema may be tuned by some adaptive mechanism. This tunability of schema assemblages allows them to start as composite but emerge as primitive, much as a skill is honed into a unified whole from constituent pieces. For this reason, a model expressed in a schema-level formalism may only approximate the behavior of a model expressed in a neural net formalism. When used in conjunction with neural networks, schema theory provides a means of providing a functional/structural decomposition, and is to be contrasted with models which employ some learning rule to train an otherwise undifferentiated network to respond as specified by some training set.",

Cells could also respond to other local features, but processing in regions of the visual system further from the retina could aggregate ambiguous information to determine key contours that would separate the image into different regions. Around 1961, Horace Barlow, in telling me of this \"Hubel-Wiesel hierarchy\" commented that this contour extraction was what enables us to recognize a face from a caricature. I responded, \"But then how do I see you are not a caricature?\" Flippant perhaps, but actually making an important point. The important point implicit here is that visual processing cannot be purely hierarchical. To the extent that higher levels of processing may extract key properties of an object, person or scene, our awareness is still enriched by the scene's lower-level aspects (e.g., shape, motion, color and texture). I will call this crucial point-that brains exploit computation \"up\" and \"down\" to bring diverse representations into a harmonious whole-the Barlovian principle. We have seen it exemplified in the bidirectional relation between PW and HC in the B3 model (Fig. 4) where input at either end can initiate a cycle of bottom-up and top-down processing that converges on coherent representations across the network. Another instance was provided by Arbib and House (1987) who showed how two depth maps, one based on monocular and the other on stereoscopic cues, could be brought into congruence to provide a more coherent representation than either might achieve alone. A crucial step toward IBSEN will be to insist that a scene is represented by an assemblage of schema instances with links to lower-level \"patches\" of relevant visual data according to the Barlovian principle. The VISIONS model of visual scene understanding (Hanson and Riseman 1978) exhibits this crucial property: Successive (or otherwise distributed) levels of processing (which include top-down activity) do not discard the lower levels but instead integrate (and modify) and interpret activity at other levels to yield an integrated view enriched by subtle undertones that can be brought to the fore by attention. Although the VISIONS model does not touch on this, the \"experiential aspect\" includes the emotional shading present in an episode, whether this precedes or follows from the interpretive process. Again, where VISIONS concentrates on processing static visual scenes, recognizing an episode requires integration over some time interval in which dynamic changes in relationships can be observed, including \"who did what and to whom (or which)\" for persons and/or objects that attract the observer's attention (bottom-up), or to which the observer may direct attention (top-down) in pursuit of providing the perceptual base for a current task. Assessing how this might be achieved provides challenges for the development of IBSEN.",

It is not simply a matter of matching one image to another based solely on the spatial layout of low-level features. Rather, it involves the dissection of the scene into meaningful regions, each of which is then associated with a schema instance which specifies that that region is an instance of a particular object; downward paths associate each instance with attributes like location, depth, color and texture. Moreover, the objects are in various spatial relationships. Work on VISIONS (Weymouth 1986 ) extended the processes described above to inferring 3D relationships from the disposition of perceived objects as seen in 2D. Our goal is now to extend VISIONS in combination with TAM-WG to provide the initial description of our conceptual model, IBSEN, of how brain systems for episodes and navigation could be extended to support imagination. The key notion, as by now should be clear, is that where VISIONS can construct a scenerepresentation by processing visual input, and where models like B3 posit that visual images can be reinstated from a trace in some form of a previously observed scene (or one slightly extrapolated from such scenes), we are concerned with imagination as a process whereby novel scenes quite different from any observed before can be constructed through a process that links a schema assemblage to a variety of lower-level representations.",

Schacter et al. distinguish between temporal and non-temporal factors in analyses of memory and imagination, i.e., imagining the future is a special case of imagination more generally. They observed a \"common brain network\" that underlies both memory and imagination. However, as they and others demonstrate, there are distinct brain networks for memory and imagination, but the finding is that brain imaging reveals a notable overlap. The underlying networks can couple flexibly with other networks to support complex goal-directed simulations. Further data and discussion are contained in many papers, and the next subsection will briefly review some key findings that complement their work. This is a limited sample, but I hope that it will stimulate others to link further empirical data to new modeling efforts that build on the conceptual foundations offered below.",

This underlies the quest for linkages between recall and imagination-though note that prospection may engage fact memory and procedural memory as much as episodic memory, with the relative importance varying from task to task. Addis et al. (2007) used an fMRI study to assess the common and distinct neural substrates during construction and elaboration of past and future events. (As already noted, imagination is in no way restricted to imagining what events may occur along a future timeline.) \"Participants were cued with a noun for 20 s and instructed to construct a past or future event within a specified time period (week, year, 5-20 years). Once participants had the event in mind, they made a button press and for the remainder of the 20 s elaborated on the event.\" Their data indicated that left hippocampus was commonly engaged by past and future event construction, along with posterior visuospatial regions. However, future events recruited regions putatively involved in prospective thinking and generation processes, specifically right frontopolar cortex and left ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, respectively. Furthermore, future event construction uniquely engaged the right hippocampus, possibly as a response to the novelty of these events. In contrast to the construction phase, elaboration was characterized by remarkable overlap in regions comprising the putative autobiographical memory retrieval network. Addis et al. (2007) attribute this to the common processes engaged during elaboration, including self-referential processing, contextual and episodic imagery. The diversity and lateralization of processes they observed, and their putative localization, set challenges for future modeling in which we may expect to see how each process involves competition and cooperation between diverse subregions.",

Consequently, a partial cue that activated the index could activate the neocortical patterns and thus retrieve the memory of the episode. Building on the indexing theory, Moscovitch et al. (2016) developed a dynamic perspective on episodic memory and the hippocampus that runs from perception to language and from empathy to problem solving. Their component process model holds that, when encoding episodes, hippocampus obligatorily binds together into a memory trace or engram those neural elements in the medial temporal lobe and neocortex that give rise to the perceptual, emotional, and conceptual experience together with a sense of autonoetic consciousness that engages the self in some form of reliving of the experience. However, our episodic memory may engage scenes for which we have been an observer rather than an engaged participant so the autonoetic component may be optional. Similarly, when we turn from episodic memory to imagination-and especially to imagination related to architectural design-the sense of self-engagement need not be involved in all cases. For our purposes, the component process model leaves open two complementary questions: (i) What binds together the different aspects of a memory, and (ii) what would then permit \"unbinding\" so that fragments from different episodes could get activated, then interact, and possibly cohere into a new imagined episode?",

Here they seem more aligned with the data of Kjelstrup et al. (2008) than that of Maguire et al. (2006) , and offer no insight into our \"hippocampal chart table\" hypothesis. However, I think the latter is implicit in work on episodic memory (as distinct from navigation) since episodes are viewed as encoded by linked patterns of hippocampal-neocortical activation-there seems no appetite in the literature (at least as far as I have read) for talk of episode-cells with episodefields! Perhaps more relevant for future modeling are the data Moscovitch et al. summarize on the relevant neuroanatomy: posterior hippocampus is preferentially connected to perceptual regions in the posterior neocortex, whereas the anterior hippocampus is preferentially connected to anterior regions, such as the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) and the lateral temporal cortex extending into the temporal pole and the amygdala, which are associated with the processing of schemas (in a different sense from mine; see Sect. 5.3), semantic information, and social and emotional cues, respectively. On this basis, they propose that the anterior hippocampus may code information in terms of the general or global relations among entities, and the posterior hippocampus might code information in terms of precise positions within some continuous dimension (Poppenk et al. 2013) .",

In other words, the fact that these areas may be engaged in diverse tasks related to scene construction does not rule out the engagement of areas outside their \"construction network\" also being engaged in scene construction. As suggested earlier, the resolution may be that the normal brain may employ hippocampus for preparing scenes for possible memorization in concert with other areas, and hippocampus (but in association with other brain regions) then plays a key role in indexing retrieval of what has been memorized. Indeed, a shortcoming of VISIONS is that it models visual scene understanding based solely on semantic memory and enriched by linkage with prior episodes. It does not evaluate scenes as memorable and decide whether or not to commit (aspects of) the associated interpretation to memory. (2) In summary, saying that \"a network including hippocampus is engaged in these diverse processes\" seems not to advance us beyond saying \"hippocampus is engaged in these diverse processes\" unless one can offer more explicit statements about the differential engagement of these regions in the very different tasks listed by Hassabis and Maguire. Other papers from Maguire's group offer relevant data and discussion, including \"Deconstructing episodic memory with construction\" , \"Constructing, Perceiving, and Maintaining Scenes: Hippocampal Activity and Connectivity\" (Zeidman et al. 2014) , \"Differentiable Processing of Objects, Associations, and Scenes within the Hippocampus\" (Dalton et al. 2018) , and \"Remote Memory and the Hippocampus: A Constructive Critique\" (Barry and Maguire 2019) , to name just a few. And, of course, there is an overwhelming flood of possibly relevant data from other researchers such as the few sampled earlier in this section. These papers offer a rich trove of data on scene construction and reconstruction as engaged in episodic memory and imagination, but none offer the process-by-process computational/conceptual analysis that we offer here in seeking to learn from both TAM-WG and VISIONS as we begin to build bridges from spatial navigation via visual construction to episodic memory and imagination. The next section will show how an extension of VISIONS-style modeling may begin to fill the gap in a way that addresses the challenges offered by the quote from the architect Peter Zumthor.",

As a step toward defining IBSEN, we here sketch an approach to how to approach integration of diverse multi-modal aspects, including action, as a conceptual extension of the VISIONS System from static scenes to episodes combining agents, actions and objects and assess its relevance to both navigation and episodic memory. My aim here is not to document a recent advance in \"Complex Spatial Navigation in Animals, Computational Models and Neuro-inspired Robots,\" the theme of the special issue, but rather to suggest future research that may link work on navigation to the cognitive neuroscience of human memory and imagination. Consider, for example, a still image of a woman and a man, with the woman's hand near the man's cheek. One needs to extend the observation for a short period of time, before and after, to establish a salient fact about the scene: Is the woman caressing the man or slapping him? In general, we may recognize the agent and patient of an action, with the spatial extent of the action encompassing the smaller spatial extents of the agent and patient.",

Through learning, the model becomes able early on during the trajectory of the hand to assign differing confidence values as to which manual action is being employed, with-in general-the values coming to strongly favor one candidate as motion proceeds.

HEARSAY used a WM which extended in time, and a blackboard architecture which could hold elements of the speech stream at levels from the phonological to the lexical all the way up to syntactic and semantic interpretation. Where VISIONS might have various perceptual schema instances competing to interpret a given region of the visual scene as competition and cooperation lowers and raises their confidence values, so linguistic units at various levels compete to interpret different segments of the speech stream-time rather than visual space provides the key underlying dimension. For example, it might be hard to distinguish a particular /p/ versus /b/ sound. However, context that could yield the interpretation \"birthday\" would shift the balance in favor of /b/. Nonetheless, prior context could set top-down biases to change even this favored interpretation. My audiences find it near-impossible to hear the /p/ if I say \"Happy pirthday,\" yet will hear it clearly if I say \"Today is the anniversary of the settlement of Perth. Happy Perth day!\" Such considerations (though not this example) influenced the design of HEARSAY. Interaction between the levels changed confidence values of the various units until ambiguities in the phonological stream were removed as they came to be linked to words that had become parts of coherent syntactic and semantic interpretations. In extending VISIONS, then, we must have a spatiotemporal WM of many levels but-despite the Barlovian two way flow of information-many details will be lost in the encoding into memory. For comparison, contrast how we may remember every word of an oft-repeated song or poem, yet may, when reading a story or a news item or a journal article, recall only the gists of whole paragraphs and a few key words therein. These may prove robust enough to support appreciation of later paragraphs in most cases; but every now and again we must search back through the earlier pages in search of details that we had not retained but that now prove crucial. Robin and Moscovitch (2017) propose that perceptually detailed, highly specific representations are mediated by the posterior hippocampus and neocortex, gist-like representations by the anterior hippocampus, and schematic representations by ventromedial prefrontal cortex:",

Crucially, schema, gist and detailed representations are not mutually exclusive. These differing representations may co-exist and support one another or may be preferentially retrieved at the expense of the other(s) based on the particular demands of a task. Thus, it is the quality or nature of the memory representation, rather than its age, that determines whether it is dependent on the hippocampus. (Robin and Moscovitch 2017, p. 114) However, this raises a flag in that the term \"schema\" is being used differently from that used in our schema theory (e.g., VISIONS). There, the distinction between schema instances in working memory (WM) and the schemas in long-term memory is crucial: we might say that the highly specific representation is the network of parameterized schema instances linked to the temporo-spatial regions within the episode; the gist might then comprise the more general schema instances that provide the context for topdown influences on this highly specific representation, while the schema-in-their-sense is more like the generic trace in long-term memory of what can be construed as a very highlevel schema-in-our sense, but is more often referred to as a frame or script (Minsky 1975; Schank and Abelson 1977) . The invocation of scripts emphasizes the crucial extension of VISIONS in going from spatial to spatiotemporal schemas, as exemplified in our modeling of neural networks for action recognition-networks that exploit object recognition as the basis for recognizing static and dynamic relationships between them, and which do not engage the hippocampus.",

We have all had the experience of driving repeatedly down certain streets where we have command of enough cues to navigate successfully, perhaps even anticipating certain sharp bends rather than responding to external affordances. But here's the rub. One day, when driving down a street after a prolonged absence, we recognize that there is a new house on our route-and yet, try hard as we may, we cannot remember what the previous house there looked like. On the other hand, there may be a house that provides a distinctive cue (it has been promoted to a WG node, one might say, as a \"landmark\") such as \"when you get to that house, start looking for a right hand turn that is hard to spot behind the trees.\" If that house is replaced, we will be able to recall it. The point? The mechanisms that give a place enough salience to be promoted from the locometric map may be comparable to those that construct an episodic memory from the salient details of a salient episode. An important distinction, though, is that \"promotion\" to a WG node may be a cumulative process, whereas episodic memory will be a variety of one-shot learning if it constitutes an episode of brief duration-though many episodes that constitute an episodic memory are indeed prolonged, but can frame a host of subepisodes.",

In addition, it is associated with WG edges that relate to navigation in its vicinity. The overall system can then retrieve familiar paths and create new ones to get to a destination that meets certain criteria. Finding such a path may involve linkage of multiple maps-(1) getting from the kitchen to the car, (2) getting to the airport and parking the car, (3) flying from A to B to C, (4) and so on. In cases (1) and (2) there is linkage to two distinct locometric maps; in (3) one might observe a flight map on a video screen, but this is irrelevant to your own self-controlled movements. In (4) one might, having arrived at a novel airport, build a new cognitive map as one finds one's way from airplane to a waiting car, and this might be forgotten or, in piecemeal form, speed the construction of a cognitive map on the next visit to that airport. In short, reliance on TAM (following signs) may suffice, but may also contribute to a small and possibly fragmentary WG. The multiple WGs have interfaces-one (usually) knows when to switch from one WG to another, or to rely on affordances specific to one's current navigation. But the crucial point is that, even though we have certain rote routes in our lives, there is no fixed path through our supergraph of WGs. Thus, as in planning a vacation, one need not retrace a known route, but may (by resources outside the WG) choose several desirable destinations, and then-combining one's personal experience with a range of tools for travel planning-hone in on more details (that hotel here, those friends there, that touristic destination, and so on) and come up with a detailed itinerary for a route that links places known and unknown-truly an important feat of the imagination.",

But as you read guide books and travel brochures and watch videos and talk to friends you-as a human, and unlike a nonhuman animal-can use vicarious experience to build a set of vicarious or imagined episodes-possible excursions for your stay in London.

But, of course, episodes may be memorable whether or not you can recall the place in which they occurred. More to the point, the linkages in a WG are spatial, even if the construction of a path depends on one's current motivational state. By contrast, only a few linkages between episodes will be explicitly stored, and few will have an explicit timeline.

The temporal sequencing of events abstracted to the verbal level may predominate in story-telling-though these unfolding episodes trigger the imagination of the reader or listener, as they begin to imagine the faces and demeanors and even the mental states of people and their surroundings, with earlier episodes creating expectations that shape those later imaginings, and whose contradiction may contribute greatly to the drama of the narrative. Note the distinction from spatial navigation. Here, whether modeled by TAM or WG, we find a path through actual places-one may say that navigation is \"clamped\" by the changing sensory input one receives within that actual context. Imagination is creating a new scenario in which the people, places and interactions may be novel. By contrast, and counter-intuitively, my \"home\" in a dream is almost never my actual home or one I have ever visited.

The TAM-WG model remains surprisingly pertinent to the models of spatial navigation they present, and so I indicate some of the challenges which the new models, often in concert with ideas from TAM-WG, present for further studies of spatial navigation. Disappointingly, though, none of the papers relate their work to an observation that has been commonplace since the early exploration of place-cell properties-that most place cells are remapped randomly across different environments (Wilson and McNaughton 1993) . As a result, none address the resultant key question: As we move from one environment to another, what mechanism activates the appropriate cognitive map, and how is it distributed between PFC, HC and other regions? Since they do not address even an impoverished version of imagination based on cognitive maps other than the one that is currently installed, they a fortiori do not consider our experience of imaginary worlds, let alone the novel constructions supported by IBSEN. The concluding subsection, then, offers a brief sketch of research challenges that may exercise the imagination of the spatial navigation community-to imagine imagination. Monaco et al. (2020) stress, as we do, the need to extend models from simple environments to animals' natural habitats. However, where we stress the role of diverse WGs, their concern is with autonomous systems technology, and so they introduce the \"NeuroSwarms\" control framework to investigate whether adaptive, autonomous swarm control of minimal artificial agents can be achieved by direct analogy to neural circuits of rodent spatial cognition by analogizing agents to neurons and swarming groups to recurrent networks. They present emergent behaviors including phase-organized rings and trajectory sequences that interact with environmental cues and geometry in large, fragmented mazes. Their hope is that NeuroSwarms, by integrating autonomous control and theoretical neuroscience, has the potential to uncover common principles to advance both domains.",

They propose that path integration (PI) is performed by information coming from the RSC. Grid cells in the EC can be built on the basis of projection of the RSC activity. In their model, PI is modulated by the activation of Head Direction (HD) cells and the velocity of the animal when using a classical conditioning mechanism. The place-cell-like activity on a treadmill in the RSC can be explained as the result of the RSC selforganizing in blobs, simulated by several one-dimensional Kohonen maps. They show that the integration of a 1D HD cell field is able to build the PI. These new results further indicate that the grid cells in the EC can be explained by a simple projection of the RSC activity. My group has earlier modeled path integration (Guazzelli et al. 2001) , addressing data on rats navigating through environments that unexpectedly change shape (Gothard et al. 1996) , data that was also addressed by Byrne et al. in an application of the B3 model.

Across different virtual environments, most cells remapped randomly, but reward encoding consistently arose from a single pool of cells, suggesting that they formed a dedicated channel for reward. Seeking to explicate the relation between these cells' spiking activity and goal-representation, Xiao et al. (2020, this issue) analyzed data from experiments in which rats underwent five consecutive tasks in which reward locations and spatial context were manipulated. They found CA1 populations with coding properties continuously ranging from place cells to reward cells. In addition, they found a small group of neurons that transitioned between place cells and reward cells coding within each session. Xiao et al. suggest that this conjunctive coding property prompts a re-thinking of current computational models of spatial navigation in which hippocampal spatial and subcortical value representations are integrated outside these modules. Perhaps puzzlingly, they found that reward cells mostly responded to the reward delivery rather than to their expectation-one might expect expectation to be crucial during navigation. These reward cells seem, then, to be more related to supply of reinforcement for learning than for encoding expected reinforcement cues, as is needed in our Strain-Miller example-but perhaps the encoding of expected reinforcement is the task of place-and-reward cells.",

(2020) consider how previous exploratory experience is re-organized to create novel efficient navigation trajectories, e.g., when rats discover the shortest path linking baited food wells after a few exploratory traversals. In their model of navigation sequence learning, sharp wave ripple (SWR) replay of hippocampal place cells transmit \"snippets\" of the recent trajectories that the animal has explored to the prefrontal cortex (PFC) which is modeled as a recurrent reservoir network that is able to assemble these snippets into the efficient sequence. To explore integration of this dynamic system into a real-time sensory-motor system, they test the hypothesis that the PFC reservoir model can operate in a real-time sensory-motor loop for simulated and physical rat robots. Place cell activation encoding the current position of the rat feeds the PFC reservoir which generates the successor place cell activation that represents the next step in the reproduced sequence. This is played into the rat, which advances to the coded location and then generates de-novo the current place cell activation. They show how this integrated sensory-motor system can learn simple navigation sequences, and then can synthesize novel efficient sequences based on prior experience (Cazin et al. 2019) . The model of hippocampal replay generates a distribution of snippets as a function of their proximity to a reward. The integrative PFC reservoir reconstructs the efficient sequence based on exposure to this distribution of snippets that favors paths that are most proximal to rewards. This contributes to the understanding of hippocampal replay in novel navigation sequence formation. There is a major disagreement here between TAM-WG and Cazin et al. They have PFC control successive \"minipaths\" by linking step-by-step snippets whereas in WG, PFC would encode nodes for the baited food wells and for any via points that mark obstacles to direct runs between places already represented by nodes.

Additionally, the model can generate imaginary trajectories that are not allowed to the agent during task performance. Hippocampal online reactivations during reward-based learning, usually categorized as replay and preplay events, have been found to be important for performance improvement over time and for memory consolidation. A key is the need to transform reward information into state-action values for decision-making and to propagate it over time and space. They present a model-based bidirectional planning model which accounts for a variety of hippocampal reactivations. The model combines forward trajectory sampling from current position and backward sampling through prioritized sweeping from reward location until the two trajectories connect. This is repeated until stabilization of state-action values (convergence), which could explain why hippocampal reactivations drastically diminish when the animal's performance stabilizes.",

In experiments using a hippocampal-dependent paired-associate task for rats, the memory of flavor-place associations became persistent over time as a putative neocortical schema gradually developed.

(2020) address the finding that place cells are organized along the dorso-ventral axis of the hippocampus according to their field size, with dorsal hippocampal place cells having smaller field sizes than ventral place cells. They address the view that the entire longitudinal axis of the hippocampus may be involved in navigation. Based on this, they present a spatial cognition reinforcement learning model inspired by the multi-scale organization of the dorsal-ventral axis of the hippocampus and evaluate it in a goal-oriented task where simulated rats need to learn a path to the goal from multiple starting locations in various open-field maze configurations. Their results show that smaller scales of representation are useful for improving path optimality, whereas larger scales are useful for reducing learning time and number of cells required. Moreover, combining scales can enhance the performance of the multi-scale model, with a trade-off between path optimality and learning time. Their work thus seems to directly complement the study summarized next. Hausler et al. (2020) claim that heterogeneous mapping approaches (typically locally metric and globally topological-such as that of the WG model) starkly contrast with the neural encoding of space in mammalian brains: a multiscale map underpinned by spatially responsive cells like the grid cells found in the rodent entorhinal cortex. But what is the evidence for ruling out WG-like maps? Recall that the key datum on multi-scale coding of Kjelstrup et al. (2008) was gathered as rats ran back and forth on an 18-meter-long linear track, and the fact that place cells are remapped in different environments. When visiting a shop, one is rarely able to accurately estimate distance from home, or orientation relative to some fixed axis in the house. It is mistaken to conflate what works for robots with access to a Global Positioning System and highly accurate odometers with what works for animals and humans that have at best a range of moderately accurate \"Relatively Local Positioning Systems\" and noisy odometers. Thus, while I welcome their analysis of multiscale representations, using current robotic place recognition techniques at each scale-how many scales should there be, what should the size ratio between consecutive scales be and how does the absolute scale size affect performance? -I argue that a hybrid approach such as that of TAM-WG shows more promise in addressing human and animal spatial cognition.",

His experiments confirm that place recognition using single images or short image sequences is poor, but improves to match or exceed current benchmarks as the matching sequence length increases-a good argument for memory based on sequences of views (the simplest form of episode?) as unit, rather than static images. More generally, Lowry et al. (2016) discuss how greatly the appearance of real-world places can vary. To ground specification of the major components of a place recognition system, they survey-the role of place recognition in animals and how a \"place\" is defined in a robotics context.

Understanding these will help clarify the emerging design of IBSEN at a conceptual level even as we ransack the treasure trove of the literature to determine how best to fill in the details.

I am arguing for a hybrid architecture in which some parts of the model are left at the level of interacting schemas (hypotheses on whose localization may be linked to imaging and lesion data) while others (informed by neurophysiological studies of behaving animals, such as the grasping monkey and the navigating rat) can already be interpreted in more detailed neurobiological terms.",

(2011) charted three dorsal pathways that complement the ventral pathway: The parieto-premotor pathway that supports visually guided actions (the one my group has modeled), the parieto-medial temporal pathway that supports navigation (the one whose elaboration could extend the TAM-WG model, especially the linkage of affordances to locometric space in TAM); and the parieto-prefrontal pathway that supports spatial working memory (perhaps relevant to the \"neutralization\" of WG). In a complementary paper, Kravitz et al.

There may be useful parallels between describing an imagined scene/episode and describing a detailed photo of a scene as one observes it. Elsewhere, we have modeled the latter process by coupling VISIONS to a language processing system based on Template Construction Grammar (TCG), in which constructions are active schemas yielding schema instances akin to those in VISIONS (Arbib 2017; Barr\u00e8s and Lee 2014) . In particular, Lee (2012) observed and modeled the difference between the well-articulated description of a fully analyzed scene and the piecemeal description that emerges under time pressure. Perhaps the latter may provide a bridge to the handling of new vistas while navigating-experiencing the route while uttering/behaving on the basis of current affordances. Such analysis of verbal expression linked to navigation in familiar versus unfamiliar environments might be a useful tool for further assessing the role of the locale versus taxon systems in relation to memory, with perhaps the former implicating episodic memory whereas the latter does not.",

Rather, it exists in something like the Working Memory in the extension of VISIONS hypothesized as part of IBSEN, but now extracting material from diverse images to create a new assemblage of schema instances that satisfies some criteria. In autobiographical memory, we extract certain related episodes that cohere into some sort of narrative. In imagination, we form new \"virtual episodes\" that form a new narrative that may involve an equilibrium-as in drawing or writing-between external and internal constructions, or which may be achieved internally as a coherent pattern emerges in long-term memory. To go beyond my sketch of IBSEN, future modelers must develop computational models (whether at the schema and/or neural network level). As McCulloch said, \"look where I am pointing.\" As for the implications of all this in responding to Zumthor's thoughts on architectural design, I refer the reader to the final chapter of When Brains Meet Buildings (Arbib 2021) .",
