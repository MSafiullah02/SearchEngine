The change point of the probability of movements was one week after the WHO worldwide alert on the SARS outbreak. The alert was effective in controlling travels. The probability of infection did not change for three weeks. Public health intervention after the alert took few effects. The probability of movements did not change at all for the flu pandemic. The pandemic did not affect travels despite the WHO alert. The change point of the probability of infection was one week after the WHO alert. School closures, cancelling large mass gatherings, and social distancing were effective in controlling exposure for children and young adults.",

The analysis of the observations on an outbreak includes many tasks, which range from reproducing the growing number of cases at an infected city to detecting the omen and predicting the onset of an outbreak at neighboring uninfected cities. Among them, detecting an epidemic trend change is a task of particular interest to public health authorities in confirming the efficacy of public health intervention.",

Then it becomes less probable that infectious travelers enter across national or regional borders. Border health screening at airports may work similarly to these voluntary risk-averse behaviors. The isolation of infectious persons is often compelled by the public health authorities once community transmission commences. The speed of the community transmission may decelerate if such social distancing works effectively in controlling exposure. Those are examples of an epidemic trend change. Detecting whether an epidemic trend changes or not helps the public health authorities confirm the efficacy of the current practices of public health intervention and design a more effective public health program.",

The trend change in the parameters for infection and recovery is analyzed in the early, middle, and late phases of a SARS epidemic in 2003 with an approximate Bayesian computation technique [Walker 2010] . A degree distribution is selected from representative degree distributions of a heterogeneous contact network between hosts for measles, gonorrhea, and norovirus outbreaks [Stack 2013 ]. A compartment model with stratification by age and cross immunity for multiple strains fits the number of seasonal influenza cases the best [Truscott 2012] . A sequential importance sampling technique is applied in selecting a compartment model from candidate compartment models with a sub-divided compartments, an additional transition between compartments, or a time delay of transitions for a common cold outbreak [Toni 2009 ]. In those model selection techniques[Toussaint 2011], a Bayes factor or a Schwarz's Bayesian information criterion[Sch\u00fctz 2011], [Ensign 2010] , [Brown 2003 ] indicate the relative goodness of fit between models.",

An autoregressive integrated moving average model is developed for the early detection of such a bioterrorist attack as an anthrax release and contamination. A physi-cian visit rate is predicted from the fraction of the queries to an online search engine [Ginsberg 2009 ]. The increase in this rate signals an impending outbreak. The current level of disease activity is modeled as a hidden state variable in a Markov switching model [Lu 2010 ]. This model is applied to the prospective detection of cryptosporidiosis and anthrax outbreaks. A multivariate regression method is developed to detect an outbreak more robustly from the difference between the observations in multiple geographical regions [Schi\u00f6lera 2012 ].",
