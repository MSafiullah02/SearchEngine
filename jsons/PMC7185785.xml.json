To date, the studies of these outbreaks have been small, but overall they have shown that children younger than school age (ie, younger than 10 years) have the greatest risk of infection, and that seasonal patterns and group A streptococcus emm gene types are varied.",

Unlike other countries that have also had an upsurge, China had a sudden increase in the number of susceptible children as a result of the partial two-child policy in 2011 and the universal two-child policy in 2015.11, 12 These changes resulted in a substantial increase of 1 million births from 2015 to 2016.12 As such, scarlet fever is an increasing threat to the growing child population in China.",

Scarlet fever epidemics have been increasingly reported in east Asia (ie, Vietnam, Hong Kong, South Korea, and China) and Europe (England, UK) since 2008. One study indicated that England was having a sudden and widespread increase of scarlet fever, with the highest incidence of the disease in nearly 50 years. However, these reports have assessed epidemiological parameters in a small population, and so have insufficient power to compare changes in the incidence of the disease after its re-emergence.\nAdded value of this study\nTo the best of our knowledge, there have been no complete, systematic, multiregional, and comprehensive investigations of the increasing pattern of scarlet fever across China or epidemiological changes after the 2011 upsurge completed to date. This childhood disease started to surge in 2011 and to occur at increased incidence for 6 consecutive years, with an annual percentage change of 9% (95% CI 4\u00b71\u201314\u00b71) in the whole of China. The incidence of scarlet fever was twice as high after the upsurge. Increased incidence was identified throughout China, and the fastest increases were seen in Hainan, Guangdong, and Hunan Provinces in the south of China.\nImplications of all the available evidence\nThe re-emergence of scarlet fever has become a great challenge for the Chinese Government. Since partial relaxation of the one-child policy in 2011 and then the universal two-child policy in 2015, the child population, which is the most susceptible to this disease, increased by 1 million in 2016. Considering the findings of this study, effective prevention and control strategies should be expanded for childhood diseases that cannot be prevented with a vaccine\u2014eg, scarlet fever, infectious diarrhoea, and acute haemorrhagic conjunctivitis. The Chinese Government now has the ability to enforce school-based absenteeism and symptom surveillance and early-warning systems for these infectious diseases, and to prepare additional medical resources to respond to this potential threat in the future.\n",

We used a parametric method as joinpoint regression (parametric and empirical quantile types) to calculate the 95% CIs. In describing patterns, an increase or decrease is proven when the slope of annual percentage change is significant (p<0\u00b705). A stable trend refers to a non-significant annual percentage change (p\u22650\u00b705). We used the \u03c72 test to compare the different proportions of infected people by sex, year, and occupation. We used a Mann\u2013Whitney U test to compare the time intervals between the two epidemic periods (2004\u201310 and 2011\u201316).",

In the mid-19th century, scarlet fever epidemics were found to follow 4-year pattern, but this pattern disappeared during the 20th century with the widespread application of antibiotics. In China, over the past 66 years, scarlet fever epidemics have had four stages, including high incidence (1950\u201379), decrease (1980\u201394), low incidence (1995\u20132010), and resurgence (2011\u201316).16 Through these four stages, the disease cycle has been approximately every 6 years.16 The 2011 upsurge in the incidence of scarlet fever could signal a return to a high-incidence stage of the disease.16 A third reason might be an increased number of susceptible children in China after the loosening of the one-child policy, which started in 2011.11, 12 Consistent with this idea, the incidence of childhood infectious diseases that are not preventable by vaccine (eg, diarrhoea) has increased in the past 5 years. Finally, improvements in early surveillance and warning could have been contributed to by increased reporting, as has been seen with the increased diagnosis of infectious diseases in China since the NNIDSS was created.9, 22 However, the reasons for resurgence of scarlet fever in Hong Kong, South Korea, and England cannot be fully explained by these same factors, and further studies are needed.",

This difference is due to several factors. First, differences in meteorological effects could partly explain the variation.23 In northern China, people stay indoors more with closed windows and doors during the cold season (October\u2013April), which leads to bad ventilation and increases the chance of infection. Second, site-to-site differences in risk factors might have been present, such as long-term exposure to severe air pollutants in northern regions, which could have been a risk factor for infection.24 Finally, group A streptococcus epidemiological surveillance has shown that the proportion of group A streptococcus emm12 gene type strains was gradually replaced by emm1 gene types in some areas in the north of China from 2011 to 2014, leading to minimal cross-immunity.16, 25\n",

The highest incidence of scarlet fever was found among children aged 6 years and the pattern of increasing incidence was apparent in children aged 3\u20134 years. This pattern could be partly attributable to the paucity of herd immunity among children aged 3\u20136 years to group A streptococcus infection;16 another cause could be restricted protection conferred by antibodies toward the M protein, with little cross-immunity toward other types of M protein.2, 26, 27, 28 Our findings indicate that boys and men have a higher risk of infection than girls and women, in all age groups, which could be attributable to more physical interactions or poorer personal hygiene among boys than among girls.29 Thus, in the future, specific strategies and measures should target preschool aged children and boys.28\n",

Geographical differences in seasonal patterns could have been associated with climatic and demographic factors. Our study indicated that the incidence of scarlet fever decreased substantially during school holidays in China. The seasonal patterns in China were similar to those in Hong Kong and South Korea, but different from those in Poland (which peaked in January and March) and England (which peaked in February\u2013March).1, 3, 6, 30 The length and timing of the school holidays might have contributed to the different seasonal patterns in east Asia and Europe.",

For those patients who died, older age (mean 8\u00b75 years) and delayed diagnosis (median 4 days since disease onset) could have contributed to the mortality risk. However, co-occurring diseases could also be a contributing factor to mortality risk, as discussed by Lau and colleagues' in their report of the scarlet fever outbreak in Hong Kong in 2011,33 in which two children with scarlet fever died who had underlying medical illnesses (co-infected with chickenpox). Generally, in the current phase of the disease in China, although the number of scarlet fever cases has increased, the disease severity was mild and did not change from before to after the upsurge.",

First, the national surveillance system is not complete, and most patients with subclinical and asymptomatic cases of scarlet fever were not included because they did not seek medical consultation or were underdiagnosed. Second, data that were collected during the first year of roll-out of the national surveillance system are probably less reliable than those from the later years. Third, we could not calculate the directed age-standardised incidence of scarlet fever in China because the number of age-specific cases from the 31 provinces and areas were unavailable. Finally, we did not have data for emm gene typing of group A streptococcus and so were unable to monitor the antigen shift throughout China.",
