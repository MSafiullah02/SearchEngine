The conventional diagnostic methods are too much demanding in terms of time and labour. Latest advances in the molecular biology and biotechnology have opened new avenues in disease diagnosis and therapeutics, but these technologies are in budding stage so need to be further explored to their full potential to safeguard the health of human in addition to their companion animals. Along with this there is a need to build up qualified, trained and competent manpower for bringing the existing disease diagnostic methods in laboratories to field of action. Because of the lack of skilled manpower in different institutions of public undertakings, it is highly desirable that the gained expertise and knowledge be disseminated to users of these techniques directly so benefits can be harnessed more efficiently and effectively.",

Incredible progress in the molecular diagnosis and characterization of avian influenza virus infections in the past two decades is the true example of this.

It has allowed scientists to detect and amplify a unique region of DNA multiple folds under strict thermal conditions (Mullis 1990). The specificity of the assay is determined by complementarity of short stretches of synthetic DNA oligonucleotides or primers to the target sequence followed by amplification of the sequences between these primers by the thermostable DNA-dependent DNA polymerase enzyme. It is a faster technique than other methods of detection of pathogens (bacteria, fungi or viruses), which require initial isolation in culture. PCR has been used in veterinary diagnostics for specific genomic detection, e.g. infectious bovine rhinotracheitis virus, foot-and-mouth disease virus, bovine viral diarrhoea virus, buffalopox virus, ephemeral fever virus and many others. Mass level detection of avian influenza and Newcastle disease poultry pathogens in recent outbreaks in the USA has been made with PCR.

The latter are specific to the amplified product sequence of the first PCR thereby verifying the specificity of the first round of PCR with the specific product availability of second PCR. Nested PCR (nPCR) has been used to detect a number of etiological agents of veterinary importance such as canine corona virus, West Nile virus and orf virus (Pratelli et al. 2004; Bora et al. 2015). The drawback of nested PCR is the possibility of contamination of the first amplified product. This problem can be overcome by using the primer pairs annealing at different temperatures. Secondly, ultrapure oil or wax can be used to make physical separation between two amplification mixtures as a contamination control measure (Erlich et al. 1991).",

            "text": "There are multiple reasons for considering conventional asymmetric PCR inefficient, as there are difficulties in optimization and it tends to promote nonspecific amplification and restricted concentration of one primer lowers the Tm (melting temperature) below the reaction annealing temperature. To overcome these limitations and to increase efficiency comparable to symmetric PCRs, linear after the exponential (LATE)-PCR was developed based on primer pairs purposely designed for use at unequal concentrations to yield specific single-stranded DNA products in a robust way (Pierce et al. 2005). In the LATE-PCR, detection step is distinct from the annealing and extension step, and it improves allele discrimination and increases signal strength significantly as compared to symmetric PCR (Sanchez et al. 2004). LATE-PCR does not reach the characteristic plateau like conventional PCR but ends in a nearly linear phase (Johann et al. 2015). LATE-PCR is highly appropriate for high-throughput field applications, e.g. clinical analysis, biodefense, forensics and DNA sequencing.",

It can also be used to identify exonic and intronic sequences in specific genes. In multiplex PCR the design of various primer pairs is crucial so that they complementarily anneal to specific DNA sequences at more or less similar temperatures, i.e. annealing temperature should be the same for different primer pairs used in combination. A multiplex PCR assay to detect H5N1 and other human respiratory pathogens (Lam et al. 2007; Rheem et al. 2012) and mastitis in animals has been developed (Shome et al. 2011). Other variant and combination of this technique is multiplex one-step real-time PCR kits that are available with all plus points inherited (Gautam et al. 2016).",

Both primers and enzymes work together for LAMP cycling initiation and continuation of DNA synthesis with auto-strand displacement leading to the accumulation of 109 copies of target in less than an hour. DNA synthesis is primed by FIP and BIP, in combination with initial strand displacement mediated by the extension of forward and backward outer primers, resulting in the successive formation of a DNA molecule.

When target DNA is present, the two adjacent probes are ligated by DNA ligase. If ligated product is absent, that means there is at least a single base-pair change in the target sequence. In the following steps, the ligated products can serve as templates and can be amplified by thermal cycling in an exponential manner (Wiedmann et al. 1994). In LCR contamination risk and variation in copy number of the plasmid containing the target is a problem (Umesha and Manukumar 2016).",

Briefly, the procedure involved initial random shearing of genome (may be enzymatic or physical by ultrasonication), followed by ligation of both the ends of each fragmented DNA genome with specific adaptors. These adaptors allowed the DNA molecule capturing on the surface of beads. Now these ligated fragments were amplified (emulsion PCR) and captured in emulsion droplet. Individual bead with amplified fragment arrayed in a well of a fibre-optic slide. The 454 GS followed the same sequencing principle as of most primitive Sanger sequencing method.

The labelled or modified nucleotides and optical instruments are not employed as done in other sequencing methods. This system also has various limitations like difficult enumeration of long homopolymer repeats. Signals obtained from high repeats of different nucleotides create obstacles as differentiation could not be made from that of similar but different number homopolymer repeats. It gives an average read length of 400 nucleotides per read, which is a shorter read length compared to pyrosequencing and Sanger sequencing methods.

            "text": "Proteomics is a better approach than genomics for studying changes in metabolism under stress conditions. Various methods in proteomics, viz. 2-D gel electrophoresis (2DGE), MALDI-TOF/MS, etc., play a significant role in the analysis of novel proteins and in disease diagnosis. The expression of proteins depends on the status of the body and different environmental factors. This field of study has an important role in novel drug discovery and in the early-stage disease diagnosis (OIE 2016). Proteome maps are being derived from a range of veterinary pathogens (Mujer et al. 2002; Rout and Field 2001; Yatsuda et al. 2003). Proteomics-based diagnosis may be used to identify known or unknown disease markers in the future. Proteomics may have applications in the diagnosis of disease pattern development in combination with biochip technology, bead technology, mass spectrometry and other separation chromatographic methods. This type of combination of technologies can be useful for identification of pathogens that do not induce predictable serological reactions, i.e. bovine tuberculosis.",
