Many previously fatal diseases, from HIV and hepatitis C to various cancers, now can be managed as chronic conditions, leading to improvements in mortality and morbidity [1, 2]. Other diseases have been prevented, as reflected in the declining rate of hospitalization for heart disease over time [3]. Moreover, we have entered an age of promising, next-generation scientific approaches to diseases that previously had limited or no effective treatment: three gene therapies are Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved; nearly 300 gene therapies, gene-modified cell therapies, genome editing therapies, or oncolytic viruses are in clinical development; and 425 active gene therapy studies are listed with ClinicalTrials.gov [4, 5]. In 2018, the FDA reported more than 500 active investigational new drug applications involving gene therapy products, and it predicts that by 2025, it will be approving 10\u201320 cell and gene therapy products a year [6\u20138].",

An ideal financing system for pharmaceuticals balances multiple objectives: it provides incentives to develop valuable new therapies; it encourages competition to drive down prices; and it limits what people have to pay when sick so that everyone can afford necessary care. The first two goals represent a tradeoff between providing effective incentives for the development of innovative new treatments and promoting competition and maximizing patient access through lower prices. The third is associated with the completeness of insurance, what services are covered, and how much is paid by the insurer relative to the insured.",

While it is hard to predict the number of new therapies that will be approved and the number of patients treated, one estimate speculates that in 2030, perhaps 50,000 US patients might be treated with cell and gene therapies, with the majority in cancer [11]. At a hypothetical cost of US$1 million per patient, annual outlays then would reach US$50 billion (as a comparison, total net spending on prescription drugs in the US was estimated to be US$344 billion in 2018 [12]). Some would be launched in indications where they would displace a less-effective but also quite expensive, often chronic, current standard of care, and therefore the incremental cost to the system would be substantially less than this figure. Nevertheless, even highly cost-effective, curative therapies might pose a substantial upfront budget impact and affordability challenges for some payers.",

To attract investment capital, these start-up firms rely on the likelihood their candidate drugs will address valuable unmet medical needs when and if they are eventually approved, the strength of intellectual property (IP) protection, and expectations regarding reimbursement and payment if they are approved. Without IP protections and favorable expectations regarding eventual reimbursement and payment for clinically valuable drugs, firms would be unlikely to make the substantial, risky investments needed to develop them, or to acquire early-stage discovery firms or their assets. With some two-thirds of 2018 new active substance (NAS) launches originated by emerging biopharmaceutical companies (those with sales less than US$500 million or R&D spending less than US$200 million), incentives and expectations in early-stage development are critical elements in the innovation system [23].",

Under the BPCIA, new biologics receive 12 years of legislative exclusivity (patent protection runs concurrently, providing varying lengths of protection, higher or lower). The BPCIA also created a regulatory pathway for biosimilars that can demonstrate no clinically meaningful differences in safety and efficacy relative to a reference biologic [the so-called 351(k) pathway] [26]. For a biosimilar to be approved as interchangeable with its reference product, a higher standard, the manufacturer must demonstrate that it would be expected to produce the same clinical result as the reference product in any given patient [27]. The BPCIA also defined a framework for patent challenges [28].",

Under a prize system, the government would specify a particular product or outcome (e.g., a highly effective hepatitis C drug) and a reward to the first manufacturer to meet the defined clinical or other parameters; prizes are generally \u201cwinner takes all.\u201d Under a system of government contracting, the government would issue a request for bids for the specified product or outcome, and would award one or more contracts; \u201cadvanced market commitments\u201d (AMCs) or purchase volumes promised in advance could be specified in the contract. Under direct government R&D activity, the government itself would conduct drug development activities, for example, in areas of public health priority but potential private market failure (e.g., antibiotics) [32]. Under each type of system, additional government spending would be required, which would be funded through additional federal taxes, potentially offset over time by lower prices for the drugs covered by these programs than would otherwise have been the case (when the specific contract terms are fulfilled or the prize is awarded). One advantage of some prizes and contracts is that they can be structured to result in lower pharmaceutical prices at the time when people receive care, thereby reducing patient access barriers to necessary care. For example, a drug whose patent owner had agreed to an upfront payment or prize in exchange for such lower prices (or an outright sale of patent rights to the government) could be sold at the lower marginal cost of production. One argument made for prizes relative to contracts is that by rewarding only successful outcomes, they focus on outputs rather than inputs [16].",

In assessing various proposals related to financing innovation, policy-makers should consider their effect on the balance among the goals of encouraging continued investment in tomorrow\u2019s novel drug therapies, safeguarding competition, and ensuring patient financial access. Due to the important role the US plays in the biopharmaceutical market, substantial changes to the current framework have the potential for far-reaching implications for patients both in the US and around the world.",

The current model for financing drug innovation, which relies on the promise of future returns to incent private investment, has been associated with advances in many disease areas, therapeutic modalities, and new scientific approaches, while gaps remain in some important areas such as antibiotics. In order to sustain incentives for future development of such treatments and other novel clinical modalities, manufacturers and payers are investigating a range of innovative financing models that will allow sufficient returns for innovators while ensuring access for future patients. Continued experimentation and the input of a range of stakeholders are needed to ensure next-generation therapeutic advances continue to be developed and made available to patients.",
