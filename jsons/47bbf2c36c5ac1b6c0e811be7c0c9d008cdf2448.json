The isolation of closely related strains from the horseshoe bat has been reported, [2] which suggests a potential for reemergence of the SARS-CoV by retransmission to humans from its animal reservoir. There have also been three additional human coronaviruses-HCoV-HKU1, [3] HCoV-NL63, [4] and HCoV-EMC [5] -reported since 2003. HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63 were shown to be less lethal than SARS-CoV.

PLpro and 3CLpro are responsible for cleavage of the polyprotein into 16 nonstructural proteins. The first three positions between nonstructural proteins 1-4 are cleaved by PLpro, whereas the other eleven positions are cleaved by 3CLpro. Both 3CLpro and PLpro have been shown to be essential for viral replication, [9] making them attractive drug targets against SARS-CoV. 3CLpro has been intensively pursued as a drug target, and several inhibitors have been reported. They can be categorized as covalent peptidomimetic, noncovalent peptidomimetic, and nonpeptidic. [10] Unlike 3CLpro, the development of PLpro inhibitors has been very limited until recently, despite its essential role in SARS viral replication. In addition to our own work, [11] two very different types of PLpro inhibitors have been reported in recent years. First, 6-mercaptopurine (6MP) and 6-thioguanine (6TG) were identified from compound screening, with IC 50 values of 5-20 mm. [12] Second, several natural products, diarylheptanoids isolated from Alnus japonica, showed inhibitory activity (IC 50 4.1 mm) against PLpro. [13] In addition to its primary function of viral peptide cleavage, PLpro has been recognized to be involved in deubiquitination, de-ISGylation, and viral evasion of the innate immune response. [2a, 14] SARS-PLpro is a cysteine protease that contains a zinc binding motif, a catalytic triad, and a ubiquitin-like N-terminal domain (Figure 1 ). The sequence identity and similarity between SARS-PLpro and HCoV-EMC PLpro are 32 and 51 %, respectively (Supporting Information (SI) figure S1 a). Interestingly, the predicted structure of HCoV-We previously developed two potent chemical classes that inhibit the essential papain-like protease (PLpro) of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus. In this study, we applied a novel approach to identify small fragments that act synergistically with these inhibitors. A fragment library was screened in combination with four previously developed lead inhibitors by fluorescence-based enzymatic assays. Several fragment compounds synergistically enhanced the inhibitory activity of the lead inhibitors by approximately an order of magnitude. Surface plasmon resonance measurements showed that three fragments bind specifically to the PLpro enzyme. Mode of inhibition, computational solvent mapping, and molecular docking studies suggest that these fragments bind adjacent to the binding site of the lead inhibitors and further stabilize the inhibitor-bound state. We propose potential next-generation compounds based on a computational fragment-merging approach.

Analysis of the two available PLpro structures with inhibitors 2 and 3 and subsequent molecular modeling studies revealed that these leading inhibitors bind to a pocket formed mostly by the G267-G272 loop and the Leu163 side chain, distinct from the catalytic site shown in green in Figure 1 .

This would require the synthesis of larger compounds, a process that consumes significant amounts of time and resources, and may or may not result in better binding affinity and potency. An alternative strategy is the application of fragment-based drug design (FBDD) methodology, which has become a well-established method for lead optimization. [16] In many cases, FBDD has been used to discover small scaffolds for further optimization or to find two small fragments that can be linked together to produce a more potent inhibitor. [16e] To be able to link two small fragments, it is typically necessary to solve crystal structures with each fragment. In many cases, obtaining this structural information can be very challenging and time-consuming due to the typical weak binding affinity of fragments for their target enzymes. In this study, we used FBDD in combination with detailed enzymatic analysis as a means to further optimize our leading inhibitors without the use of crystallography. By testing a small library of fragment compounds in the presence of each of the lead inhibitors, we were able to identify fragments that synergistically improve the potency of the leading inhibitors. Additional enzymatic analyses (including mechanism of inhibition and mutual exclusivity studies, described in detail below) and computational studies were used to predict the fragment binding locations.

Although the catalytic pocket is small, there is a reasonable probability that fragment compounds could successfully bind to this location and enhance inhibitory activity of the lead inhibitors. The Zenobia library, consisting of 352 chemically and structurally diverse fragment-like compounds, was experimentally screened in the presence of each of the four previously discovered lead inhibitors. All fragment compounds were tested by continuous kinetic enzymatic assays as described in the Experimental Section below. A replicate plot of inhibitor 2 with the 352 fragments showed highly reproducible results (SI figure S2 a). The replicate plots of the other lead inhibitors were similar to that of inhibitor 2.

BEI and SEI for these eight fragments and four lead inhibitors were calculated by simple equations: pIC 50 divided by M r for BEI and pIC 50 divided by PSA for SEI. [17] The PSA value is an important indicator related to oral bioavailability and intestinal permeability. [19] The BEI values of fragments F3, F4, and F7 were > 25, suggesting that they are outliers due to the possibility of nonspecific interaction (SI figure S2 c).

Although these lead inhibitors do not bind directly to the catalytic site, they nonetheless display competitive inhibition patterns.

The data were fitted to four equations [Eqs.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 174, "end": 178, "text": "[14]", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 179, "end": 183, "text": "[15]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Mechanism of inhibition studies"}, {"text": "(2)-(5) in Experimental Section] and three plots (Michaelis-Menten, Lineweaver-Burk, and Dixon), each using SigmaPlot Enzyme kinetics Module 1.3.

To determine which equation fits best, the AICc value difference must be at least two units from the next lowest. [20] All four previously developed lead inhibitors showed noncompetitive inhibition with unequal binding affinity to free enzyme (E) and substrate-bound enzyme (ES), where the alpha (a) value is not equal to 1 ( Table 2 ). All four lead inhibitors showed a values greater than 1, which indicates the binding affinity to free enzyme is tighter than that of ES. Dixon plots for noncompetitive inhibition of inhibitor 1 (a = 2.6) with respect to the substrate are shown in Figure 3 a, and the resulting K i value was 0.42 mm. All three fragments showed noncompetitive inhibition with different a values as well. Fragments F6 and F8 had a values greater than 1 (a > 1), indicating that these fragments also behave similarly to the lead inhibitors, although a values of these fragments were smaller than those of the lead inhibitors. This may explain why F8 displayed the strongest effect with the three lead inhibitors (1, 2, and 3), whereas fragment F6 exhibited the strongest synergistic effect with scaffold B inhibitors (3 and 4). Dixon plots for noncompetitive inhibition of fragment F8 (a = 1.6) are shown in Figure 3 b, and the K i value was determined to be 242 mm.

Additionally, an analysis of the MM/ PBSA results ( Figure 5 , SI tables S1 and S2) revealed that the catalytic site, site 1, was also not a favorable position for fragment binding. The binding free energy values for the inhibitor with fragment F8 at this position were higher than those calculated for the inhibitor alone as well as the experimentally derived results. These results, taken together with the experimental results discussed above, indicate that the catalytic site is most likely not the binding site of the identified synergistic fragments. Favorable results that closely aligned with experimental values were obtained, however, when the fragments were placed at binding site 2 (shown in Figure 6 ), consistent with synergistic activity. We noted a preference for a positive charge, as observed in the F8 piperazine amine group, to be placed into an anionic pocket of site 2, defined by D303, T302, Y274, and D165, which, in combination with the established binding features of the lead inhibitors, resulted in a clear gain in their calculated binding affinity.
