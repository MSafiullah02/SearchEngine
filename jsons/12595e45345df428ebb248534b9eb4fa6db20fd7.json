By physical examination, the body temperature was 39.2-40 \u00b0C, heart rate 127/min, breathing rate 32/min and blood pressure 116/80 mmHg. He showed a typical development, moderate nutrition, active position and slight unconsciousness. In addition, he showed eye conjunctival congestion and edema, identically sized and round pupils and obvious cyanosis in oral lips. By percussion, the left lung fl atness; by auscultation, coarse breathing sound of both lungs that attenuated at the right lung.

( d , e ) On d 7 after onset, CT scan showed light small fl akes of opacity at the posterior segment of right upper lung lobe and medial segment of the right middle lung lobe. Irregular small fl akes of consolidation was revealed at the apico-posterior segment and anterior segment of left upper lung lobe. Large fl ake of dense opacity of consolidation was also revealed at the lingual segment of the upper lung lobes and most of the lower lung lobes, with air brochogram inside. Left pleural effusion was also demonstrated in a moderate quantity. ( f , g ) On d 34 after onset, CT scan showed ground glass opacity at the apical and posterior segments of right upper lung lobe, patches of consolidation at the anterior segment of right upper lung lobe with air bronchogram inside, comparatively shrinkage of the right middle lung lobe in dense opacity of consolidation with air bronchogram inside. The right lower lobe was revealed with scattering irregular patches of opacity, fi ne arch like linear opacity dorsally near the pleura, and slight thickening of the adjacent pleura. The left upper lung lobe was demonstrated with generally increased density opacity with air bronchogram inside and surrounding lobular septal thickening that reaches subpleura. The lower lung lobe showed slightly small volume, with aggregating lung markings, extensive consolidation and thick air bronchogram inside. ( h , i ) On d 286 after onset, CT scan revealed the lesions in lungs to be pulmonary interstitial changes including fi brous cords like, grid like and ground glass opacity",

( b ) On d 7 after onset, the lesions were shown with rapid progression in a larger range in both lungs. Both lungs were shown with extensive cloudy and cotton like opacity and fusion of some into large fl ake. ( c ) On d 11 after onset, the lesions were shown to be within an even larger range in both lungs, namely the white-lung sign in both lungs, which indicated relapse and progression of the lesions. ( d ) On d 72 after onset, the both lungs were demonstrated with interstitial lesions, characterized by grid like opacity and obviously slower absorption. ( eg ) On d 7 after onset, CT scan demonstrated extensive distribution of lesions in both lungs, which were more serious at the dorsal parts of both lungs, with air bronchogram in consolidation opacity. ( hj ) On d 72 after onset, CT scan demonstrated obvious absorption of the lesions, cords like opacity in ground glass like change, and interlobular septal thickening in the peripheral areas of both lungs",
