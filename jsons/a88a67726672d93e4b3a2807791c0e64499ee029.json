            "text": "Pulmonary parasitic lung diseases are commonly diagnosed in countries where the prevalence of parasitic infection is high. However, there is an increase in the number of patients diagnosed as parasitic lung diseases recently, even in countries of low prevalence of parasitic infection which demands an awareness of such diseases in these countries. This increase in diagnosis in countries with low prevalence with parasitic infections has been attributed to an increase in the numbers of immunosuppressed individuals due to various reasons, organ transplantations and global travel [ 1 ] . The parasites can cause a wide spectrum of lung diseases varying from mild self-limiting bronchitis to life-threatening acute respiratory distress syndrome [ 2 ] . In addition, parasitic lung diseases may mimic diseases such as bacterial pneumonias, pulmonary tuberculosis, bronchial asthma, lung cancer, interstitial lung disease, and pulmonary hypertension. Both protozoal and helminthic parasites can cause lung diseases and helminthic lung infections are important causes of eosinophilic lung diseases [ 3 ] . Though the treatment of parasitic lung diseases is with specifi c antiparasitic drugs, the physicians treating such diseases should be competent in tackling the specifi c issues related to lung injury and sequel that may follow such infections. The lung diseases that may result from infections with parasites are listed in Table 1 .1 [ 4 ] .",

Infection with Entamoeba histolytica can lead to intestinal colonization, colitis or extraintestinal manifestations resulting from the hematogenous spread of infection from the intestine. About 90 % of intestinal colonization is with nonpathogenic species, Entamoeba dispar and Entamoeba moshkovskii . Invasive amebiasis occurs in 10 % of persons colonized with E . histolytica . Patients with amebic colitis present with several-week history of cramping abdominal pain, weight loss, and watery or bloody diarrhea. Extraintestinal amebic infection can manifest as amebic liver abscess, splenic abscess, brain abscess, empyema, and pericarditis. Nearly 80 % of cases of amebic liver abscesses occur in the right lobe. The most common complication of amebic liver abscess is rupture into the pleural space resulting in pleuropulmonary amebiasis [ 5 ] . The main symptoms in pleuropulmonary amebiasis are fever, cough, hemoptysis, right upper quadrant abdominal pain, and chest pain. Some patients may present with respiratory distress and shock. Lung abscess, hepatobronchial fi stula, and bronchopleural fi stula with pyopneumothorax have also been reported. Expectoration of anchovy saucelike pus indicates amebiasis [ 6 ] . The fi ndings of elevated hemidiaphragm, tender hepatomegaly, pleural effusion, and basal pulmonary involvement are suggestive of pleuropulmonary amebiasis. Amebiasis can be suspected in patients with a history of immigration from or travel to developing countries and many patients give history of dysentery and alcoholism.",

            "text": "Amebiasis is commonly diagnosed by microscopy and cysts or motile trophozoites can be identifi ed on a saline wet mount of a stool specimen [ 7 ] . Microscopic examination of fresh stools, sputum or pleural pus, rectal smears or rectosigmoidoscopy materials, pus from liver abscesses, and colonic biopsy samples may reveal motile trophozoites, even though it is a relatively specifi c test but is not sensitive for the identifi cation of E . histolytica . The presence of ameba in the stool does not indicate that the disease is due to pathogenic E . histolytica as two other nonpathogenic species found in humans ( E . dispar and E . moshkovskii ) are indistinguishable morphologically [ 8 , 9 ] . This method can, therefore, give false-positive results if Entamoeba dispar or Entamoeba moshkovskii infection is present. However, it has been reported recently that several different genotypes of E . dispar can be potentially responsible for tissue damage similar to that observed with E . histolytica [ 10 ] . A nonpathogenic Entamoeba gingivalis which is present in the oral cavity has to be differentiated from Entamoeba histolytica in sputum samples. A combination of serological tests with identification of the parasite by antigen detection by PCR is the best approach to diagnosis. In vitro culture by inoculation of portions of stool, liver abscess, or empyema fl uid into sterile culture media and incubating it at 37 \u00b0C is also useful in the diagnosis of amebiasis. The culture media is examined for the growth of amebic trophozoites, which, if present, can be seen on the walls of test tubes or in debris [ 11 ] . Antibody detection and antigen detection are other important immunodiagnostic methods. Indirect hemagglutination (IHA) test is used for routine serodiagnosis of amebiasis. Antigen consists of a crude soluble extract of axenically cultured organisms. The enzyme immunoassay (EIA) test detects antibody specifi c for E . histolytica in approximately 95 % of patients with extraintestinal amebiasis, 70 % of patients with active intestinal infection, and 10 % of asymptomatic persons who are passing cysts of E . histolytica . Detectable E . histolytica -specifi c antibodies may persist for years after successful treatment, so the presence of antibodies does not necessarily indicate acute or current infection. Specifi city is 95 % or higher and false-positive reactions rarely occur. E . histolytica -specifi c antigen detection may be useful as an adjunct to microscopic diagnosis in detecting parasites and to distinguish between pathogenic and nonpathogenic infections. Detection of circulating antigens in the serum has been found to be an important advancement in the diagnosis [ 12 ] . Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays are useful for the differentiation of E . histolytica , E . dispar , and E . moshkovskii and for genetic typing of isolates [ 13 , 14 ] . However, these tests are time-consuming and expensive and, hence, are not practical in areas endemic for amebiasis.",

The smears can be stained with Romnowsky's, hematoxylin-eosin, or immunoperoxidase stains. The amastigote stage seen in clinical samples is known as Leishman-Donovan (LD) bodies. The amastigotes observed in the smears have to be differentiated from \"dot\"-like structures (e.g., Histoplasma spp., platelets) by looking for the characteristic size (2-4 mm in diameter), shape (round to oval), and the internal organelles (the nucleus and kinetoplast). Culture of these specimens on solid NNN medium will demonstrate promastigotes. Immunological methods of diagnosis include indirect fl uorescent test (IFA), direct agglutination test (DAT), and enzymelinked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to detect antibodies against Leishmania [ 20 ] . Antigen detection tests are better means of diagnosis of active leishmaniasis [ 21 ] . The antigen detection is the ideal test in immunocompromised patients, where antibody response is very poor. PCR is found to be the most sensitive and specifi c molecular test and is useful in molecular epidemiological studies besides diagnosis [ 22 ] .",

The main symptoms of malaria are periodic fever, chills, malaise, headache, abdominal pain, and vomiting, usually manifesting 10-15 days after mosquito bite. Anemia and splenomegaly are other important fi ndings in malaria. Falciparum malaria is the most deadly type. The pulmonary manifestations range from cough to severe and rapidly fatal non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) ( Fig. 1.1 ) [ 24 ] . Acute lung injury and ARDS have also been reported to occur in infection with P . vivax and P . ovale [ 25 , 26 ] .

Microscopic diagnosis is based on staining thick and thin blood fi lms on a glass slide to visualize the malaria parasite [ 28 ] . It is inexpensive, able to differentiate malaria species and quantify parasites. The detection threshold in Giemsa-stained thick blood fi lm has been estimated to be 4-20 parasites/\u03bcL. Plasmodium species can be correctly recognized in thin blood fi lm. Sometimes malarial parasites cannot be detected in peripheral blood smear, but malaria pigments may be seen in circulating phagocytic leukocytes. This is a pathognomonic sign of recent infection. The parasite count, number of circulating pigment-containing phagocytes, and the presence of late asexual stages of the parasite observed in the blood smear are all positively correlated with a fatal outcome. Bone marrow aspirate can also demonstrate malarial parasites, if thin smears of the peripheral blood do not show the parasites. Quantitative buffy coat (QBC) method involves staining parasite deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) in micro-hematocrit tubes with fl uorescent dyes (e.g., acridine orange) and its subsequent detection by epifl uorescent microscopy. The parasite nuclei fl uoresces bright green and the cytoplasm appears yellow-orange [ 29 ] .",

The result, usually a colored test line, is obtained in 5-20 min. Histidine-rich protein 2 (HRP-2) which is specifi c for P . falciparum is the most common malaria antigen targeted [ 32 ] . Plasmodium lactate dehydrogenase (PLDH) enzyme is the other group of targeted antigens. Monoclonal antibodies against pLDH and aldolase enzymes are available for the detection of Plasmodium spp. (pan malaria). HRP-2 often persists in the patient's blood for weeks after successful treatment. Molecular methods such as PCR allow the specifi c amplifi cation of a selected region of the malarial genome. This is a specifi c and sensitive method and permits genotyping. Drug-resistant parasites and mixed infections can be detected by PCR using single nucleotide polymorphism. A PCR-based detection of Plasmodium falciparum in human urine and saliva samples has been described. The antibodies against asexual blood stages of malaria parasite can be detected by the immunofl uorescence assay (IFA). Serological tests are useful in epidemiology surveys and are not suitable for the acute diagnosis of malaria [ 32 ] .",

The intermediate hosts including man are infected by ingestion of eggs excreted in the feces of the dogs. Primary pulmonary cystic hydatid disease is usually single. Multiple cysts may be seen in 20 % of cases and may be unilateral or bilateral [ 2 ] . Secondary metastatic pulmonary cystic hydatid disease may occur by the rupture of a liver cyst in vena caval circulation or a heart cyst in the right ventricular cavity. Patients are asymptomatic in the initial stages of infection. Pulmonary symptoms include cough, fever, dyspnea, and chest pain [ 40 ] . Signs and symptoms can occur due to compression of adjacent tissue by the cysts. Rupture of the cysts into a bronchus may result in hemoptysis and expectoration of cystic fl uid containing parasite membrane and can cause anaphylactic shock, respiratory distress, asthma-like symptoms, persistent pneumonia, and sepsis [ 41 , 42 ] . Rupture of the cyst into the pleural space can result in hydropneumothorax, pleural effusion, and empyema. Diagnosis of pulmonary hydatid cyst is based on thoracic imaging studies (chest radiography, thoracic computerized tomography (CT), and thoracic ultrasonography) [ 43 ] and an uncomplicated cyst presents as a well-defi ned homogenous round (cannonball) opacity that may be lobulated by contiguous bronchovascular axes ( Fig. 1.2 ) [ 2 ] . Chest radiographs show solitary or multiple round opacities that may mimic lung tumors. CT is helpful in doubtful cases, because the internal structure of the cyst can be analyzed and its density measured. CT is also useful to assess the state of the neighboring parenchyma and to evaluate the whole thorax and abdomen for associated cystic lesions or anomalies. Ultrasonography using a portable ultrasound scanner has been found as reliable, inexpensive, and rapid technique in community-based screening surveys for cystic hydatid disease. The crescent sign, Cumbo's sign (onion peel sign), water lily sign, and air-fl uid level are seen on chest radiography and computed tomography (CT) [ 41 ] . Inverse crescent sign, signet ring sign, and serpent sign are recognized as features of pulmonary hydatid cysts in computerized tomogram.",

It has been observed that 15-30 % of chronically infected people may be asymptomatic. Although symptoms in individuals with chronic Strongyloides stercoralis infection are usually mild, it can persist for many years due to autoinfection. This may occasionally progress to the hyperinfection syndrome with high mortality especially in immunosuppressed individuals [ 68 , 69 ] . The relative risk of S . stercoralis infection is increased in elderly men and patients who had recently used corticosteroids, had a hematologic malignancy, and had prior gastric surgery. Other risk factors include chronic lung disease, use of histamine blockers, or chronic debilitating illness. Strongyloidiasis is a chronic relapsing illness of mild to moderate severity characterized by gastrointestinal complaints (diarrhea, pain, tenderness, nausea, vomiting), peripheral blood eosinophilia, and hypoalbuminemia. Pulmonary signs and symptoms include cough, shortness of breath, wheezing, and hemoptysis. In patients at high risk for strongyloidiasis, adult respiratory distress syndrome and septicemia due to intestinal transmural migration of bacteria can occur as a result of hyperinfection or disseminated strongyloidiasis [ 70 , 71 ] . In addition, acute anemia, acute renal failure, and systemic infl ammatory response syndrome are also reported in hyperinfection. Strongyloidiasis can manifest as eosinophilic pleural effusion in both immunocompetent and immunocompromised individuals. Rare pulmonary manifestations include acute respiratory failure due to respiratory muscle paralysis, granulomatous reaction in the lung with interlobular septal fi brosis, and pulmonary microcalcifi cations. A paradoxic therapeutic response of asthma to glucocorticosteroids, in which bronchial asthma symptoms worsened after treatment with parenteral corticosteroids, has been described in patients with strongyloides superinfections [ 72 ] .

The chest radiological features of TPE include reticulonodular shadows predominantly seen in mid and lower zones and miliary mottling of 1-3 mm in diameter often indistinguishable from miliary tuberculosis (Fig. 1.3 ) . Twenty percent of patients have a normal chest radiograph. In patients with a long-standing history, a few patients have honeycomb lungs.
