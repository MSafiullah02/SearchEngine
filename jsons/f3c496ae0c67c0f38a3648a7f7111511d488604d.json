            "text": "Two decades ago network scientists proposed that infectious diseases may be effectively halted by targeting interventions at a minority of highly connected individuals. Can this strategy be effective in combating a disease transmitted through physical proximity such as the contemporary coronavirus? The strategy's effectiveness critically depends on high between-person variability in close-range contact. We analyze population survey data showing that indeed the frequency of close-range contact across individuals is characterized by a small fraction of people reporting very high frequencies of close-range contact. We simulate a population with empirical contact distributions coming out of lockdown. Simulations show that targeting a small fraction of high-degree individuals dramatically improves containment. Our results further suggest two concrete procedures for identifying high-contact individuals: acquaintance sampling and employment-based targeting.",

Many countries are in the process of gradually lifting a lockdown initially imposed to contain spread, reintroducing measures to contain a second wave. Most containment measures that are being lifted combine general interventions aimed at broad groups of citizens (children, elderly, contact professions) or categories of meeting places (schools, restaurants, airports) (Zhang et al. 2020) . The economic costs of such measures are tremendous, expressed in percentages of GDP. At the same time, easing restrictions on interaction achieved through such measures could spur new waves of infections. effective method to reach high-contact individuals and can considerably help \"flattening\" the curve (section 5). We conclude that, possibly coupled with job-specific targeting, this is a feasible practical method by which governments could identify high-degree nodes in contact networks, thus efficiently coping with the epidemic on the long-run.",

The leading epidemiological compartmental models of SARS-CoV-2 spread in France currently rely on these data (see, for instance, Di Domenico et al. 2020; Roux et al. 2020; Salje et al. 2020a ; in a comparative perspective, see Patrick et al. 2020) . In these models, COMES-F data are routinely employed to build social contacts matrices, i.e. average contacts between age groups by places (like school, public transportation, home, etc.) (for an example of this methodology more generally, see, for instance, Prem et al 2017) . In contrast to prior use of the data, we rely on the entire cross-individual heterogeneity of the observed distribution of close-range contacts. We implement this distribution in a social network model of disease propagation (section 3), so that we can evaluate the effectiveness of interventions targeted at highconnectivity individuals (section 4).",

An initial sample of 24,250 was drawn from the French population excluding overseas territories through random-digit dialing of landline and mobile numbers. Using quotas for age, gender, days of the week and school holidays, 3,977 people who accepted to participate were sent a diary to complete. 2,033 (51%) contact diaries were returned (participants' age and household size were used as sampling weights to maintain representativeness). In these diaries, participants were asked to keep track of all short-range contacts over the course of 2 full days, and report on sex and age of these contacts, meeting context, and contact duration. A short-range contact was defined as talking to someone at less than 2 meters (possibly including physical contact). COMES-F made a special effort to collect high-quality data also on social contacts of children, defined as respondents aged less than 15 (753 respondents). For them, an adult member of the household completed the diary.",

            "text": "To relieve the reporting burden, respondents were asked to record up to 40 close-range contacts. In addition, respondents currently in employment were asked whether they regarded their occupation as especially exposed to short-range contacts. This turned out to concern 257 respondents. These respondents had to indicate the average number of persons they estimated to meet every day because of their job. Should this number be higher than 20, those specific respondents were asked to enumerate, over the course of the number of reported close-range contacts varies as a function of respondents' socio-demographic features, meeting places and time can be found in B\u00e9raud et al. (2015) . Here we descriptively focus on one specific, under-investigated aspect of the observed distribution of close-range contacts: their within-and betweengroup heterogeneity. The distribution of contacts is shown in figure 1. The 2,033 individuals reported a total of 19,728 per-day close-range contacts (left panel). The median number of contacts is 8 whereas the average is approximately 9.5, with strong right-skewness. Respondents reporting a number of close-range contacts greater than twice (n=175) or even three times (n=36) the mean are not rare. This is even more visible when considering respondents who declared having an occupation especially exposed to social contacts (n=257) (figure 1's right panel). Overall they reported 14,971 additional job-related contacts. For those contacts the median is 30 whereas the average is approximately 58. One still finds 20 and 10 cases respectively at twice and three times the mean. The central tendencies of both distributions are consistent with those found in other contact surveys (Hoang et al. 2019: 727-728) . In both cases, averages are clearly driven by a small fraction of individuals reporting (extremely) high numbers of short-range contact.",

            "text": "Other studies tend to discard outliers as they may heavily impact statistical estimation of central tendencies (see B\u00e9raud et al. 2015: 5, 9) . We explicitly leave in outliers, as they are characteristic of the distribution of contact and are a crucial characteristic of empirical networks. It is not unusual for a small fraction of people to have jobs with very high frequencies of contact. The feature of high distributional skew is also visible in recent smaller-scale contact surveys conducted in China (Zhang et al. 2019; Zhang et al. 2020) and in a recent six-country survey permitting high self-reported values that range into the 4 and 5 digits. There are three suspicious cases where 999 was recorded. We judged it best to leave these values unaltered. The survey documentation does not identify these cases as missing values nor as maximum values due to a limit of 3 on the number of digits. While these values greatly impact the average level of contact, they do not make or break the skewed nature of the distribution. Accordingly, analyses (available upon request) that exclude 999 cases and upwardly adjust per-contact transmission probabilities accordingly to achieve the same R0 show intervention effects that are qualitatively unchanged. Vice versa, analyses that substitute the 999 cases with higher numbers imputed following the shape of the distributional tail and downwardly adjust per-contact transmission probabilities produce similar intervention effects as well. To obtain a single measure of daily close contact for each respondent we simply combined the number of per-day contacts tracked in the two-day contact diary with the number of supplementary professional contacts estimated by respondents. This is the measure we use in section 3.1 to construct a synthetic network. Figure 1 . Left: Fraction of cases (y-axis) reporting a given number of close-range contacts (averaged over the two days) (x-axis) (n=2,033); Right: Fraction of cases (y-axis) reporting a given number of daily job-related contacts (xaxis) among respondents regarding their occupation as especially exposed to social contacts (n=257) This high variability in the number of social contacts persists within major demographic categories that current interventions instead tend to treat as a whole. Figure 2 's upper panel shows the distribution of per day self-reported close-range contacts by respondent's gender. Past multivariate analyses of these data found that women (mainly adult women) tend to have a higher average number of contacts than men (see B\u00e9raud et al. 2015 : 6 and table 1). Figure 2 shows that, behind this main mean effect, there is a large degree of variation within genders. For both men and women numbers of contacts (far) higher than the median occur frequently. Figure 2's bottom panel shows the distribution of close-range contacts per day by respondent's age. Age is the most recurrent variable used in epidemiological models to represent socially structured social interactions. Age assortativity (and dissortativity at home) is found to be one of the most robust empirical regularities in epidemiological social contact surveys, as also found in multivariate analyses of the COMES-F data (see B\u00e9raud et al. 2015: 7-8) . This motivates the use of average contacts per (more or less disaggregate) age-groups in age-structured compartment models (see, for some recent examples, Di Domenico et al. 2020; Roux et al. 2020; Salje et al. 2020: 3-4 ; in a comparative perspective, see Patrick et al. 2020) . Now, apart from positive (more or less linear) effects of age on the likelihood of having more social contacts (which is indeed found in these data, see B\u00e9raud et al. 2015 : table 1), figure 2's bottom panel again shows high variability within age-groups. Rather than averaging this variability, we propose to exploit it using the existence of high-contact individuals as leverage for effective intervention in viral diffusion dynamics.",

Among both \"normal\" respondents (top panel) and those regarding their occupation as especially exposed to social contacts (bottom panel), there is a great deal of within-group variation across individuals in the number of self-reported close-range contacts. High-contact individuals seem especially concentrated among high (e.g. elementary school teacher, teaching assistant) and low routine non-manual workers (e.g. bank teller, teller in public administration) and service class (e.g. university professor, politician, journalist or doctor). Data (available upon request) on an eleven-category variable describing respondents' occupational sector also suggest that high-contact individuals tend to concentrate in the service sector and non-manual routine labor, specifically shops, services to persons, education, health, and administration. However, while these data suggest that social contacts within occupations are much more dispersed than one could expect under a distribution symmetrically centered around the mean, COMES-F does not provide a detailed list of jobs.

Lacking this information, it attempts to find high-degree nodes by drawing a random sample of agents with unknown degree and selecting a random neighbor of each sampled agent for immunization. This procedure is much more effective than the NO-TARGET intervention, as the figure shows. A budget of b = 3 CONTACT-TARGET immunizations produces an impact comparable to a NO-TARGET immunization regime with b = 10 daily immunizations. At b = 10, the CONTACT-TARGET intervention achieves a reduction down to only 5% of the peak in the no-intervention scenario ( The CONTACT-TARGET method would be more effective if randomly chosen agents would be able to select a random neighbor for immunization among relatively high degrees at a higher chance than network structure per se allows. Survey data suggest that targeting of certain professions may also effectively identify high-degree agents (see appendix A1). To evaluate the maximally achievable impact of any degree-based intervention, panels C of figure 5 show the impact of the HUB-TARGET policy, whereby each day the b non-immune agents with highest degree are immunized. Even a single agent per day (b = 1) reduces the peak down to only 25% (Table 2 : 118 / 470) and delays it by 17 days. This peak reduction exceeds what NO-TARGET immunization achieves with ten agents per day (b = 10). Three agents per day accelerates the peak again, but this happens as peak height is reduced to only 4%. With five agents (5% of the population after 20 days) virus spread is effectively halted. In other words, if one fully protects a small vulnerable fraction of the population, one can prevent nearly all infections that would have otherwise occurred. ",

Should the person be positive, the patient is asked to describe all her/his close contacts during the last seven days; each is also asked to be reached by phone, interviewed, and, if established that contact with the focal individual took place, this contact-case too is tested and quarantined if positive (Info Coronavirus COVID-19, 2020) . The government early May 2020 claimed to be able to perform up to 10,000 tests per day (which amounts to 0.015% of the French population). This advertised capacity is widely questioned (France Info 2020). Even if this capacity were available, it still remains below the agreed effective fraction of the population to be daily tested, i.e. at least 2% (Humanity tested, Nature Biomedical Engineering, 2020). Moreover, as acknowledged by experts advising the French government (Conseil Scientifique Covid-19, 2020: 29) , this strategy requires unrealistic levels of human resources, in particular in case of citizen resistance to and suspicion of contact tracing, as is the case in France (Casilli et al. 2020 ). Last but not least, the proposed strategy focuses on self-reported symptoms, which exclude asymptomatic cases. Asymptomatic cases are thought to be a non-negligible fraction of COVID-19 infected persons, especially among children (Heneghan et al. 2020) .",

The rationale behind the third and fourth pillar is that high-contact individuals, if susceptible, are simultaneously at higher risk of being contaminated because of their high social exposure, and, when they are infected, also transmit the virus to a larger fraction of the population.",

When a virus spreads through a network that includes individuals with dramatically more close-range contacts than the average (as observed in France), the CONTACT-TARGET method (which attempts to find high-degree nodes by drawing a random sample of agents with unknown degree and selecting one random neighbor of each sampled agent for immunization) can reduce the concurrent number of infected agents by a factor of 1.3, 2.4, 4.4 or 18.8 depending on whether one samples 1, 3, 5 or 10 agents per iteration (our budget \"b\"). If simulated peak heights are transformed into ICU admissions proportionally to French population (see appendix, table A4, and computational details therein), this would amount to reducing ICU admissions from 102826 without intervention to 79197, 42661, 23191 or 5469 respectively (5000 ICU beds being normal French national capacity). If b-values are also expressed proportionally to the French population, our CONTACT-TARGET method leads to the largest ICU-admission reduction by targeting approximately 320000 individuals per day. In contrast, for the same budget, the NO-TARGET method (which searches agents for immunization at random within the population) can generate at best a peak reduction of a factor of 1.4. Thus, keeping budget constant, systematic targeting of high-contact individuals is much more effective than random search of average-contact persons.",

In both cases, the selected highcontact person should receive a targeted informational message explaining why, given her/his social exposure, it is more crucial for her/him than for the \"average\" person to adopt basic protective gestures during all his social and professional interactions. The feasibility of this strategy thus comes from the fact that it relies more on actions, i.e. targeted messages, that can be performed at distance and does not require mobilizing huge human resources across a country. This is in line with recent calls for approaching COVID-19 in terms of massive, but targeted, preventive interventions based on pedagogic actions rather than on actions constraining individuals' freedom, which have proven not to be effective in the long-run for other aggressive infectious diseases (Marcus 2020).",

These results suggest that targeting select professions may be an effective strategy for finding hubs in contact networks. Table 1 in the main text shows a number of topological features of the empirical network that we generated to match the empirical distribution of close contacts. Here we discuss the topological features of the empirical network in greater detail and compare them with those observed for social networks measured elsewhere. The first is degree assortativity. Social networks tend to be characterized by positive degree assortativity, i.e. nodes with similar degree are more likely to be connected (see Newman 2003a) . However, in presence of broad degree distributions, the network can turn to be disassortative. This results from the fact that, while high-degree nodes still tend to be connected to one another, thus pushing assortativity up, low-degree nodes are preferentially attached to high-degree nodes, thus pushing assortativity down.",

The corresponding random network has assortativity close to zero. Degree disassortativity renders targeting of high-degree nodes more effective: \"(...) those vertices are strewn far apart across the network, so that attacking them attacks all parts of the network at once\" (Newman 2003a: 10) .",

The epidemic peaks 13 days earlier in the empirical network than in the random network, day 30 vs. day 43, demonstrating the impact of hubs: Highly connected individuals are more likely connected to the seeds and their neighbors. Once infected, they expose others early on, thus catalyzing viral diffusion. In the ER network, by contrast, there are no hubs to accelerate spread.If we translate the simulated peaks in real-world ICU admissions proportionally to the size of French population (see appendix A4 for the details), the model generates, under both network regimes, a massive number of cases requiring hospitalization. The order of magnitude of this sub-population, between 100,000 and 200,000 individuals, is consistent with other studies that have counterfactually estimated COVID-19 spread in France without any intervention between early March and Mid-April (see, in particular,Roux et al. 2020). Having established that the model produces an epidemic of appropriate magnitude, timing and shape, we move on to our post-lockdown scenario to assess the effect of interventions under a lower average reproduction rate (1.785) which allows to simulate a second wave of about half of the fist wave's size by mid-June (figure's 4 H=824 versus table 3's H=470).",
