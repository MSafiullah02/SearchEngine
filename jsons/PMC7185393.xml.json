Over the past decades the application of dynamic modelling and control has aided understanding of the complexities of their dynamics and control. For example, modelling carbohydrate metabolism in the human body has yielded quantitative insights regarding the control mechanisms of insulin and other hormones. In turn this has informed the design of a number of closed-loop control mechanisms that are now being developed to support the diabetic patient in controlling their blood glucose levels. At the same time using such complex systems as test-beds for new control methods has highlighted their limitations (e.g. in relation to system identification) and has thus acted as a catalyst for methodological advance. This paper continues the theme of exploring opportunities and achievements in applying modelling and control in the bio- and ecological domains, building on the earlier work reported in Hashimoto, Farkas, Murase, Carson, and Sano (2004).",

In order to control a possible SARS outbreak, there is the need to be prepared. The development of a rapid and decisive surveillance system is paramount, and the keys to the successful implementation of such a system are up-to-date information on local, national, and global SARS activity and effective communication among local and international healthcare workers using web technologies (WHO, 2003a).",

The solution to this question is related to natural variation between plants, and to spatial distributions. The latter problem is attacked now by advanced computational fluid dynamics (CFD) techniques (Reichrath & Davies, 2002). In relation to water, individual ions can be measured with ion-selective electrodes, thus allowing accurate feedback control to satisfy the demand of the plant (Sigrimis, Arvanitis, Pasgianos, & Ferentinos, 2001; van Straten & Gieling, 2004). As to the control itself, optimal control methodology now allows for economically optimal control, The bottle-neck here is the lack of sufficiently accurate crop quality models, although some progress has been made in a number of areas. A model for nitrate in lettuce has been used, for instance, to control the nitrate content of the head at harvest time (de Graaf et al., 2004).",
