Severely ill individuals are often wheelchair dependent, bedridden, and unable to perform basic tasks of work or daily living.",

These include early associations with Epstein Barr Virus (EBV)/Human Herpes Virus 6 (HHV6), the relapsing-remitting nature of ME/CFS symptoms and antibodies/\"autoantibodies\" detected in patients with the disease (3, 4) . A number of ME/CFS outbreaks have also been reported, in which numerous people in the same geographical location developed the illness simultaneously (2) . Indeed, many ME/CFS patients present with symptoms after suffering from a severe bacterial or viral infection. These infections often correlate with travel to a foreign country or exposure to pollutants or molds, suggesting that such pathogens take advantage of factors that compromise the host immune system.",

The metabolic dysfunction driven by these different microbes and viruses can result in similar clusters of human inflammatory symptoms. The ability of various pathogens to dysregulate activity of the Vitamin D Nuclear Receptor (VDR) is an excellent example of how different microbes can drive similar disease processes. The VDR regulates expression of hundreds of human genes, many of which regulate inflammatory and malignant processes (125, 126) . The receptor also controls signaling of TLR2 and several families of antimicrobial peptides including cathelicidin (LL-37) (127) . Pathogens capable of slowing VDR activity can subsequently facilitate their survival by slowing the innate immune response. Pathogens frequently linked to ME/CFS or inflammatory disease have evolved to survive in this fashion. VDR activity is downregulated as much as 20 times in Epstein Barr Virus-infected lymphoblastoid cell lines (128) (Figure 4) . HIV, M. tuberculosis Cytomegalovirus, Borrelia burgdorferi and Mycobacterium leprae additionally dysregulate VDR activity to various degrees (114, (129) (130) (131) (132) . The fungus Aspergillus fumigatus secretes a gliotoxin that significantly downregulates VDR expression (133) . Because disabling the innate immune system via the VDR pathway is such a logical survival mechanism, other uncharacterized bacteria, viruses or fungi may have also evolved to dysregulate receptor activity.",

However, these alterations were not observed in subjects with a longer duration of illness. There are a number of explanations for Hornig's observations. ME/CFS-associated pathogens may gradually alter their gene activity to persist in more latent, intracellular forms less recognized by the host immune system. Or, in early-stage ME/CFS, the immune system may actively attempt to target a growing infectious burden. Over time however, pathogens in the microbiome may disable the immune response to a point where \"immune exhaustion\" occurs (136, 137) . Immunopathology and cytokine production would subsequently drop. The resulting disease state could be compared to a garden, in which healthy plants become progressively stifled by others, such as kudzu vine.",
