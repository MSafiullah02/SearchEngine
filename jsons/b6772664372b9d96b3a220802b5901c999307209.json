While the responsible virus -SARS-nCoV-2 -has a primary affinity for the upper and lower respiratory tracts, the digestive system has emerged not only as a site of disease expression but also as a possible driver of disease severity and viral transmission. Herein we discuss the known digestive manifestations of COVID-19 and their potential implications, important questions that remain unanswered, and what gastroenterologists should know to care for affected patients and contribute to extinguishing the pandemic.",

A post-mortem liver biopsy from a COVID-19 patient showed moderate microvesicular steatosis and mild lobular and portal activity, consistent with either direct viral infection or drug-induced liver injury; however, hepatocyte viral inclusions were not identified. 7 Serum pancreatic enzyme elevations have also been noted in 9/52 (17%) COVID-19 patients in Wuhan, China. 8 Although no cases of severe pancreatitis occurred, the authors did observe acute elevations in serum glucose, potentially implicating the high level of ACE2 receptor expression in pancreatic islet cells.",

Additionally, the virus appears to persist in stool on average 11 days (and for up to a full month) after throat swabs become negative, and well after clinical recovery. 5 Sound conceptual arguments but limited evidence implicate endoscopy as a possible hotspot for viral transmission. 9 Droplet contamination, based on bacterial culture swabs, has been demonstrated up to 6 feet away during colonoscopy. Additionally, viral aerosolization via peri-or intra-procedural coughing, retching, flatus, or even endoscope insertion and removal and accessory channel use is postulated. Based on these concepts and data from the SARS and MERS outbreaks, the American Gastroenterological Association has published guidelines recommending N95 (or equivalent) respirators for all upper and lower endoscopic procedures. 10 Additional recommendations include double gloving and the use of negative pressure rooms for endoscopy in patients with known or suspected COVID-19. While earlier guidance favored a risk-stratified approach to using surgical masks versus N95 respirators, evolving knowledge of how the virus is transmitted and broad evidence of community spread now mandate maximal protection, including the universal use of hairnets, face shields, and shoe covers.",

Therefore, a more rigorous and systematic assessment of the prevalence, If injury to the GI tract in fact occurs, then the presence of digestive manifestations may be associated with, and perhaps even contribute to a more severe course of illness.",

Tracking food-borne infections in the midst of a pandemic illness primarily spread via aerosols from asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic carriers is challenging, although putative mechanisms for fecal-oral transmission have been described and at least one cluster of illness has been linked to buffet dining aboard a cruise ship.",

However, we do need more data on virus aerosolization during endoscopic procedures. This may have important implications in the re-expansion of endoscopy services and the reintroduction of trainees to the endoscopy suite. Some hospitals, for example, have instituted a mandatory 30 to 60-minute waiting period between cases (to allow dissipation of aerosols) and programmatic endotracheal intubation for all upper endoscopies, both reasonable practices during this crisis but not tenable in the long run. In addition, we need clarification on the performance characteristics, particularly the negative predictive value, of emerging point-of-care testing to risk stratify patients prior to elective endoscopy and to screen asymptomatic endoscopy staff. This, along with serological testing, and a clearer understanding of the immunity of recovered patients, may help elucidate a pathway toward re-launching fully operational endoscopy units, even in the face of future spikes or seasonality of COVID-",

            "text": "spectrum, and severity of digestive manifestations is necessary. To this end, the North American Alliance for the Study of Digestive Manifestations of COVID-19 (NAADMC, GI-COVID19.org) has launched a clinical registry aiming to better characterize the gastrointestinal and hepatic manifestations of COVID-19 across a network of approximately 30 centers in Canada and the United States. Another important question is whether digestive symptoms in SARS-nCoV-2 infection are the result of direct injury to the GI tract (as was believed to be the case in 2003 SARS and MERS), or simply a manifestation of viremia or systemic inflammation. Since the focus of care in affected patients is typically respiratory, and endoscopy is employed judiciously, direct evidence of gastrointestinal damage is largely lacking. While there has been a report of hemorrhagic colitis, the true association between SARs-nCoV-2 and epithelial damage remains unclear. As experience with endoscopic evaluation of COVID-19 patients grows, we should gain a more complete understanding of the endoscopic and histologic findings that might indicate viral injury. Similarly, an evolving understanding of hepatic manifestations in COVID-19 will elucidate whether abnormal LFTs reflect a direct viral effect (vs. another competing etiology), whether their presence renders the patient more susceptible to drug-induced liver injury, and whether infection can precipitate decompensation of chronic liver disease, akin to hepatitis A.",
