In more severe disease, viral load appeared to peak in the second week of illness in both upper and lower respiratory tract. A more heterogeneous pattern was seen in milder disease. Time to dyspnoea and intensive care was around 8-10 days after illness onset. 5 Therefore, continued viral replication in the respiratory tract, correlated with this timing of clinical deterioration, as observed in other studies. 6, 7 This observation implied that antiviral therapy, rather than immunomodulatory agents, might be more effective as treatment for severe disease. 7 Viral load was significantly higher and peaked later in lower than upper respiratory tract samples. In severe/critical disease, monitoring should be performed using lower respiratory tract samples. Firstly, viral shedding was more prolonged in lower than upper respiratory tract samples, thus serves as better guidance for the duration of infection prevention measures. 8 Secondly, viral loads in lower respiratory tract better reflected the temporal course of clinical progression in severe disease than upper respiratory tract samples. 6, 9 All patients demonstrated stool RT-PCR positivity at some stage of their disease, regardless of gastrointestinal symptoms.
