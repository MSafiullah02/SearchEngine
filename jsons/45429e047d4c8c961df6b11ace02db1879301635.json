This variant of the S protein contains all 22 glycans on the SARS-CoV-2 S protein (Fig. 1A) . Stabilization of the trimeric prefusion structure was achieved using the \"2P\" stabilizing mutations (20) at residues 986 and 987, a \"GSAS\" substitution at the furin cleavage site (residues 682-685), and a C-terminal trimerization motif. This helps to maintain quaternary architecture during glycan processing. Prior to analysis, supernatant containing the recombinant SARS-CoV-2 S was purified by sizeexclusion chromatography ensure only native-like trimeric protein was analyzed ( Fig. 1B and fig. S1 ). The trimeric conformation of the purified material was validated using negative-stain electron microscopy (Fig. 1C) .",

            "text": "To determine the site-specific glycosylation of SARS-CoV-2 S, we employed trypsin, chymotrypsin, and alpha-lytic protease to generate three glycopeptide samples. These proteases were selected to generate glycopeptides that contain a single Nlinked glycan sequon. The glycopeptides were analyzed by liquid-chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS), and the glycan compositions were determined for all 22 N-linked glycan sites (Fig. 2) . To convey the main processing features at Site-specific glycan analysis of the SARS-CoV-2 spike Yasunori Watanabe 1,2,3 *, Joel D. Allen 1 *, Daniel Wrapp 4 , Jason S. The emergence of the betacoronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19, represents a significant threat to global human health. Vaccine development is focused on the principal target of the humoral immune response, the spike (S) glycoprotein, which mediates cell entry and membrane fusion. SARS-CoV-2 S gene encodes 22 N-linked glycan sequons per protomer, which likely play a role in protein folding and immune evasion. Here, using a site-specific mass spectrometric approach, we reveal the glycan structures on a recombinant SARS-CoV-2 S immunogen. This analysis enables mapping of the glycanprocessing states across the trimeric viral spike. We show how SARS-CoV-2 S glycans differ from typical host glycan processing, which may have implications in viral pathobiology and vaccine design. There are two sites on SARS-CoV-2 S that are principally oligomannose-type: N234 and N709. The predominant oligomannose-type glycan structure observed across the protein, with the exception of N234, is Man5GlcNAc2, which demonstrates that these sites are largely accessible to \u03b11,2-mannosidases but are poor substrates for GlcNAcT-I, which is the gateway enzyme in the formation of hybrid-and complextype glycans in the Golgi apparatus. The stage at which processing is impeded is a signature related to the density and presentation of glycans on the viral spike. For example, the more densely glycosylated spikes of HIV-1 Env and Lassa virus GPC exhibit numerous sites dominated by Man9GlcNAc2 (21) (22) (23) (24) .",

While small mannosetype clusters have been characterized on the S1 subunit of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) CoV S (10), no such phenomenon has been observed for SARS-CoV-1 or SARS-CoV-2 S proteins. The site-specific glycosylation analysis reported here suggests that the glycan shield of SARS-CoV-2 S is consistent with other coronaviruses and similarly exhibits numerous vulnerabilities throughout the glycan shield (10) . Finally, we detected trace levels of O-linked glycosylation at T323/S325 with over 99% of these sites unmodified ( fig. S4 ) suggesting that O-linked glycosylation of this region is minimal when the structure is native-like. Our glycosylation analysis of SARS-CoV-2 offers a detailed benchmark of site-specific glycan signatures characteristic of a natively folded trimeric spike. As an increasing number of glycoprotein-based vaccine candidates are being developed, their detailed glycan analysis offers a route for comparing immunogen integrity and will also be important to monitor as manufacturing processes are scaled for clinical use. Glycan profiling will therefore also be an important measure of antigen quality in the manufacture of serological testing kits. Finally, with the advent of nucleotide-based vaccines, it will be important to understand how those delivery mechanisms impact immunogen processing and presentation. material transfer agreement with The University of Texas at Austin.

The graphs summarize quantitative mass spectrometric analysis of the glycan population present at individual N-linked glycosylation sites simplified into categories of glycans. The oligomannose-type glycan series (M9 to M5; Man 9 GlcNAc 2 to Man 5 GlcNAc 2 ) is colored green, afucosylated and fucosylated hybrid-type glycans (Hybrid & F Hybrid) dashed pink, and complex glycans grouped according to the number of antennae and presence of core fucosylation (A1 to FA4) and are colored pink. Unoccupancy of an N-linked glycan site is represented in grey. The pie charts summarize the quantification of these glycans. Glycan sites are colored according to oligomannose-type glycan content with the glycan sites labeled in green (80\u2212100%), orange (30\u221279%) and pink (0\u221229%). An extended version of the site-specific analysis showing the heterogeneity within each category can be found in table S1 andfig. S2.
