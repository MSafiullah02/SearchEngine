Young children are especially vulnerable to the effects of lead due to hand-to-mouth activity, nutritional status, and their developmental stage (ATSDR 2013a). In 2012, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) lowered the action level of concern from 10 micrograms of lead per deciliter of blood to 5 micrograms of lead per deciliter of blood (CDC 2013). A level of exposure for which no adverse health effects have been noted has not been identified (ATSDR 2013b).",

A specific population that experiences a disproportionate risk of the CLP problem consists of African refugee children who are resettled in older housing stock that still contains lead-based paint in these urban communities (Caron et al. 2013). Geltman et al. (2001) found that the prevalence of an elevated blood lead level (EBLL) was more than twice that in recently arrived refugee children compared to American children of the same age. Specifically, Geltman et al. (2001) reported that refugee children from Somalia, a developing country in Africa, were found to have the highest EBLL among refugee children who resettled in Massachusetts. Based on their work, Geltman et al. (2001) proposed that a child\u2019s \u201c\u2026refugee status should be considered a risk factor for lead poisoning\u201d (p. 158).",

The fatality occurred in a 2-year-old Sudanese refugee child who had resettled in 2000 to this community with her mother and siblings from a refugee camp in Egypt. The family resided in an apartment in a tenement building that was constructed in the 1920s. Approximately 8 weeks following resettlement, this child acquired an EBLL of 391 micrograms of lead per deciliter of blood. The CDC\u2019s action level in 2000 was 10 micrograms per deciliter of blood. Hence, this child\u2019s EBLL was 39 times above CDC\u2019s action level at that time. An environmental and epidemiological investigation determined that due to the child\u2019s exposure to lead paint dust and chips in the apartment she lived in with her family and her underlying conditions of pica (a craving for nonfood substances) and malnutrition resulted in her acquiring an EBLL in a short period of time. The child died as a result of complications triggered by the EBLL (Caron et al. 2001).",

Due to the older housing stock in the community that contains lead paint, the CDC named the community and its surrounding towns as a universal screening site. This means that every child at 1 and 2 years of age must be screened for exposure to lead (Caron and Serrell 2009). This is a form of secondary prevention. The Gold Standard is primary prevention where exposure to lead would not occur in the first place, thus the risk is removed from the environment. To achieve primary prevention of CLP, lead paint would need to be abated from every apartment unit in the city. However, this is a costly process that the municipality or property owners/managers are unable to afford. Yet, there are many families with lead-poisoned children who would argue that the benefits of primary prevention outweigh the costs.",
