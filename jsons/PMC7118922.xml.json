            "text": "Coronaviruses (CoVs) are pathogens that infect a large variety of vertebrate animals, resulting in mainly respiratory and enteric diseases (Weiss and Navas-Martin, 2005). Most human CoVs are causative agents of mild illness and common cold (Bradburne et al., 1967, van der Hoek et al., 2006, van der Hoek et al., 2004, Woo et al., 2005). However, an epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) occurred in China in 2002, and the causative agent was designated as SARS-CoV (Drosten et al., 2003, Ksiazek et al., 2003). Ten years after the SARS outbreak, another highly pathogenic human CoV, designated as Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV, emerged in Saudi Arabia (Zaki et al., 2012). Many patients infected with MERS-CoV have been identified, most of them in the Arabian Peninsula, although MERS-CoV has also spread to several other countries in North Africa, Europe, and Asia (Bermingham et al., 2012, Buchholz et al., 2013, Cowling et al., 2015, M\u00fcller et al., 2014, Mailles et al., 2013, Perera et al., 2013, Reusken et al., 2014). In humans, MERS-CoV infection causes high fever, cough, and pneumonia, and is transmitted through close contact with infected dromedary camels (Memish et al., 2014, Reusken et al., 2013).",

            "text": "CoVs are enveloped viruses possessing a large single-stranded and positive-sense RNA genome (~ 32 kb). The 5\u2032 two-thirds of the CoV genome consists of two overlapping open reading frames (ORFs 1a and 1b) that encode non-structural proteins (nsps). The other one-third of the genome consists of ORFs encoding structural proteins, including spike (S), membrane (M), envelope (E) and nucleocapsid (N) proteins, and accessory proteins (Woo et al., 2010). Upon infection of CoV into host cells, the translation of two precursor polyproteins, pp1a and pp1ab, occurs and these polyproteins are cleaved into 15 or 16 nsps by viral proteases, papain-like protease (PLpro: nsp3) and 3C-like protease (3CLpro: nsp5) (Prentice et al., 2004, Thiel et al., 2003). Alpha and beta CoVs possess 16 nsps, while gamma and delta CoVs, lacking nsp1, possess 15 nsps (nsp2 to nsp16) (Neuman et al., 2014). Although the amino acid sequences of nsp3 to nsp16 are predicted to be conserved among CoVs, those of nsp1 are highly divergent (Connor and Roper, 2007). However, the nsp1s of several CoVs, such as porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), human CoV (HCoV)-229E, mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), and SARS-CoV, exhibit a similar function to induce translational suppression (Huang et al., 2011a, Kamitani et al., 2006, Wang et al., 2010, Z\u00fcst et al., 2007). The nsp1 of SARS-CoV is the most studied among CoVs and is known to inhibit host gene expression via a two-pronged strategy (Kamitani et al., 2009)\u2014i.e., translational shutoff through interaction with the 40 S ribosomal subunit, and host mRNA degradation through the recruitment of unidentified host nuclease(s) (Huang et al., 2011a, Kamitani et al., 2009, Lokugamage et al., 2012). This two-pronged strategy of nsp1 inhibits expression of the IFN gene (Kamitani et al., 2006, Narayanan et al., 2008, Wathelet et al., 2007). Murine models of SARS-CoV have revealed that the dysregulated type I IFN response is a key factor for inducing lethal pneumonia (Channappanavar et al., 2016, Kindler and Thiel, 2016). In addition, Z\u00fcst and colleagues showed that a mutant MHV with partial deletion in nsp1 is highly attenuated (Z\u00fcst et al., 2007). These accumulated data indicate that the nsp1 of CoV is a major virulence factor.",

Like many CoV nsp1s, expression of MERS-CoV nsp1 suppresses host protein synthesis (Lokugamage et al., 2015). The nsp1 of MERS-CoV targets nuclear transcribed host mRNAs for suppression, but mRNAs of cytoplasmic origin are resistant to the nsp1-meditated gene suppression (Lokugamage et al., 2015). However, the mechanisms of the interaction between nsp1 and viral RNA of MERS-CoV and the roles of this interaction on the viral replication are largely unknown.",

As we expected, MERS-CoV nsp1 also induced translational suppression and RNA degradation. Like SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV circumvents the nsp1-mediated translational suppression by inducing a specific interaction between SL1 in the 5\u2032 UTR of viral RNA and nsp1. Interestingly, the amino acid residue of MERS-CoV nsp1 required for viral RNA recognition appeared to differ from those of SARS-CoV nsp1. In addition, reverse genetics analysis of MERS-CoV revealed that the specific interaction of nsp1 with SL1 is crucial for the efficient replication of MERS-CoV. These results indicate CoVs share a common mechanism of viral gene expression that is regulated by a specific interaction between SL1 in the 5\u2032 UTR of viral RNA and nsp1.",

To determine the role of this interaction in another human pathogenic CoV, MERS-CoV, we constructed two reporter plasmids carrying a firefly luciferase with or without the 5\u2032 UTR of MERS-CoV (pcD-5\u2032-fluc or pcD-fluc) and two expression plasmids, pCAG-nsp1 and pCAG-CAT, carrying a FLAG tag in the C-termini of MERS-CoV nsp1 and chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT), respectively (\nFig. 1A). 293T cells transfected with either pcD-fluc or pcD-5\u2032-fluc together with pCAG-CAT or pCAG-nsp1 were harvested at 24 h posttransfection, and subjected to Western blot analysis. The expression level of MERS-CoV nsp1 was significantly lower than that of CAT protein (Fig. 1B). Cells transfected with the plasmids were harvested at 24 h posttransfection and subjected to immunoprecipitation analysis using anti-FLAG antibody. Total RNAs extracted from the immunoprecipitates were subjected to Northern blot analysis by using a specific probe for the luciferase gene (Fig. 1C, top panel). The luciferase RNAs were co-precipitated with nsp1, but not with CAT, in cells co-transfected with pcD-5\u2032-fluc but not in those co-transfected with pcD-fluc (Fig. 1C, top panel), suggesting that MERS-CoV nsp1 specifically interacts with viral 5\u2032 UTR. Although the expression of luciferase mRNA was impaired in cells co-transfected with pcD-fluc, it was significantly increased in those transfected with pcD-5\u2032-fluc (Fig. 1C, second panel), as reported in SARS-CoV (Tanaka et al., 2012), suggesting that MERS-CoV nsp1 also induces mRNA degradation as reported in SARS-CoV (Tanaka et al., 2012). Although the precise mechanism of the increase of mRNA carrying the 5\u2032 UTR in the presence of nsp1 of either MERS-CoV or SARS-CoV is unclear, the interaction between nsp1 and viral 5\u2032 UTR might contribute to the stabilization of RNA.",

Consistent with previous reports (Lokugamage et al., 2015), the expression of nsp1 of MERS-CoV, but not of CAT, suppressed luciferase expression in the cells transfected with pcD-fluc (Fig. 1D). However, the expression of nsp1 of MERS-CoV failed to suppress the luciferase expression in cells transfected with pcD-5\u2032-fluc (Fig. 1D), suggesting that MERS-CoV nsp1 also participates in circumvention of the nsp1-mediated translational shutoff through the interaction with viral 5\u2032 UTR, as seen in SARS-CoV. In addition, pCAG-nsp1 possesses no nucleotide sequence of viral 5\u2032 UTR upstream of nsp1 gene (Fig. 1A). Therefore, it was thought that low level of nsp1 expression was due to its own translational shutoff (Fig. 1B).",

To determine the region(s) in the 5\u2032 UTR responsible for the interaction with nsp1, we constructed a series of SL deletion mutants based on pcD-5\u2032-fluc as shown in\nFig. 2A. Cells transfected with pCAG-nsp1 together with each of the SL deletion mutants were harvested at 24 h posttransfection and subjected to immunoprecipitation assay using anti-FLAG antibody. Total RNAs extracted from the precipitates were subjected to Northern blot analysis. The \u0394SL2-fluc, \u0394SL4-1-fluc, and \u0394SL4-2-fluc RNAs, but not \u0394SL1-fluc RNA, were co-immunoprecipitated with nsp1 (Fig. 2B, top panel), suggesting that the SL1 in the 5\u2032 UTR is responsible for the interaction with nsp1.

As we expected, the SL1-fluc RNA was co-immunoprecipitated with nsp1 in cells co-transfected with pcD-SL1-fluc and pCAG-nsp1 (Fig. 2D, top panel). In addition, no RNA degradation of the SL1-fluc was observed in cells transfected with pcD-SL1-fluc and pCAG-nsp1 (Fig. 2D, second panel), indicating that the specific interaction of nsp1 with SL1 in the 5\u2032 UTR of MERS-CoV is critical for evading the nsp1-induced RNA degradation.",

            "text": "To further confirm the role of R13 in MERS-CoV nsp1 on the translational shutoff, the luciferase activities in cells transfected with either pCAG-CAT, pCAG-nsp1-wt, pCAG-nsp1-G11A, pCAG-nsp1-R13A, pCAG-nsp1-G14A, or pCAG-nsp1-T15A together with pcD-fluc or pcD-5\u2032-fluc were determined at 24 h posttransfection. Luciferase activities in cells transfected with pcD-fluc exhibited a moderate reduction by the expression of nsp1-R13A compared to those expressing other mutants or the wt of nsp1, and those with pcD-5\u2032-fluc showed no reduction by the expression of the mutants or the wt of nsp1except for nsp1-R13A (Fig. 4E). These data looked inconsistent with the translational suppression in cells expressing nsp1-\u03943 or nsp1-\u03944, as shown in Fig. 3E. However, we found the mutant which deleted 5 amino acids at C-terminus completely lost its translational shutoff activity (Supplemental Fig. 1). In compared with this mutant, nsp1-R13A mutant still retained its shutoff activity (Fig. 4E). Although the activity of translational shutoff of nsp1-R13A mutant was a little weaker than that of nsp1-wt (Fig. 4E), these data indicated that R13A mutation made nsp1 critically lost its activity to bind with 5\u2032 UTR but retained translational shutoff activity. This contradiction might be attributable to the structure of nsp1 surrounding R13 facilitating the binding activity and/or translational suppression. In fact, the predicted secondary structure of MERS-CoV nsp1 showed that the amino acid region from 13 to 20 constitutes an alpha helix structure, as shown in Fig. 7A, suggesting that the specific interaction of MERS-CoV nsp1 with the 5\u2032 UTR through R13 is critical for circumvention of the nsp1-mediated shutoff.",

            "text": "To determine the biological significance of the viral RNA recognition by MERS-CoV nsp1 in viral propagation, we employed a reverse genetics system for MERS-CoV by using a BAC system as described previously (Almaz\u00e1n et al., 2013). We introduced an R13A mutation into the nsp1 gene of the parental infectious cDNA (pBAC-MERS) to generate pBAC-MERS-R13A (\nFig. 5A). Culture supernatants of Huh7 cells transfected with either pBAC-MERS or pBAC-MERS-R13A were harvested at 2 and 3 days posttransfection, and infectious titers in the supernatants were determined by a TCID50 assay with Vero cells. The virus infectivity in cells transfected with pBAC-MERS reached 1.0E+03 TCID50/ml at 3 days posttransfection, while no virus production was observed in cells transfected with pBAC-MERS-R13A (Fig. 5B). Next, to determine the effect of R13A on viral RNA replication, cell lysates of Huh7 cells transfected with either pBAC-MERS or pBAC-MERS-R13A were harvested at 2 and 3 days posttransfection, and total RNAs were extracted. The level of MERS-CoV subgenomic N mRNA was determined by real-time RT-PCR. As we expected, the amounts of the subgenomic N mRNA were increased in cells transfected with pBAC-MERS, while no subgenomic N mRNA was observed in cells transfected with pBAC-MERS-R13A (Fig. 5C). These results suggest two possibilities: one is that the nsp1 protein carrying the R13A mutation is unable to bind to the 5\u2032 UTR, and the other is that the R13A mutation disrupts cis-replication elements in the 5\u2032 region of viral RNA. In fact, in other CoVs, the 5\u2032 portion of the nsp1-coding region acts as a cis-acting element, and the RNA structure of this region is critical for viral replication, as described previously (Brown et al., 2007, Chen and Olsthoorn, 2010, Guan et al., 2011). Therefore, as shown in Fig. 5D, we used Mfold software to predict the MERS-CoV RNA structure from 1 to 460 nt containing the nsp1-coding region (Zuker, 2003). The predicted structure revealed that the R13A mutation in nsp1 affected the secondary structure at SL5B, C and D of MERS-CoV (Fig. 5E and F). These results suggest that the nsp1 mutation (R13A) impairs the viral replication through the disruption of SL structures in the 5\u2032 region of MERS-CoV RNA.",

The deduced secondary structures showed that SL5B, 5C, and 5D were retained in the 5\u2032 region of the viral RNA possessing the substitutions of A9G and R13A, as shown in Fig. 6B. First, we investigated the biological properties of nsp1-A9G/R13A mutant by immunoprecipitation (Fig. 6C) and luciferase assay (Fig. 6D). The results showed that nsp1-A9G/R13A mutant possessed low activity of binding with 5\u2032 UTR and induced translational shutoff against both reporter plasmids with or without 5\u2032 UTR (Fig. 6C and D). These results indicated that nsp1-A9G/R13A mutant possessed similar properties with nsp1-R13A mutant (Fig. 4C and E). To determine the effect of A9G and R13A mutations in nsp1 on the viral propagation, supernatants of Huh7 cells transfected with either pBAC-MERS or pBAC-MERS-A9G/R13A were harvested at 72 h posttransfection and passaged once on Vero cells. Preservation of the mutations in the recovered viruses was confirmed by direct sequencing (data not shown). The recovered wt and A9G/R13A mutant MERS-CoV were inoculated into Vero cells at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.001, and infectious titers in the culture supernatants and intracellular viral RNA were determined. Although the propagation efficiency was lower compared to that of the wt MERS-CoV, the mutant virus carrying two substitutions of A9G/R13A recovered the production of infectious particles in the supernatants and replication in cells (Fig. 6E and F). We also observed similar results using Huh7 cells (Fig. 6G and H). In addition, the A9G/R13A mutant MERS-CoV showed smaller plaque size than wt virus (Fig. 6I). These results suggest that 1) the secondary structure in the 5\u2032 region of MERS-CoV is crucial for an efficient viral propagation and 2) viral RNA recognition by nsp1 is also important for efficient viral propagation.",

            "text": "Many viruses suppress host protein synthesis and modify host cell environments to promote virus-specific translation (Lloyd, 2006, Schneider and Mohr, 2003). The CoV nsp1 is a multifunctional protein involved in viral replication, pathogenesis, evasion from antiviral signaling, and suppression of host protein synthesis (Brockway and Denison, 2005, Kamitani et al., 2009, Kamitani et al., 2006, Lokugamage et al., 2012, Narayanan et al., 2008, Wang et al., 2010, Wathelet et al., 2007, Z\u00fcst et al., 2007). In alphacoronaviruses, the nsp1s of HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63 and TGEV induce suppression of protein synthesis in mammalian cells (Huang et al., 2011a, Wang et al., 2010, Z\u00fcst et al., 2007). In betacoronaviruses, the nsp1s of MHV, SARS-CoV and several bat CoVs also have the ability to induce translational suppression (Kamitani et al., 2006, Tohya et al., 2009, Z\u00fcst et al., 2007). The nsp1 of SARS-CoV is the most studied among CoVs. The nsp1 of SARS-CoV predominantly localizes in the cytoplasm of cells upon infection or expression (Kamitani et al., 2006), while the nsp1 of MERS-CoV diffuses into both the nucleus and cytoplasm (Lokugamage et al., 2015). Although the nsp1s of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have been suggested to suppress host protein synthesis through inhibition of the translational machinery and digestion of mRNA by endonuclease activity (Huang et al., 2011b, Lokugamage et al., 2015), the molecular mechanisms of translational shutoff and RNA degradation induced by MERS-CoV nsp1 are largely unknown. Bovine coronavirus nsp1 has been shown to bind viral RNA and to regulate viral replication (Gustin et al., 2009). A previous study revealed that SARS-CoV nsp1 specifically binds to the 5\u2032 UTR of viral RNA to evade nsp1-mediated shutoff (Tanaka et al., 2012). In this study, we identified crucial amino acid residues in MERS-CoV nsp1 responsible for the interaction with the 5\u2032 UTR of MERS-CoV RNA and demonstrated that the interaction of nsp1 with viral RNA facilitates an efficient replication. We also showed that the RNA sequence of the 5\u2032-terminus of the nsp1-coding region plays a critical role in viral replication by acting as a cis-acting element.",

            "text": "MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV belong to lineages C and B in the genus Betacoronavirus, respectively (Ksiazek et al., 2003, Snijder et al., 2003, van Boheemen et al., 2012). Although the nsp1s of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV consist of 180 and 193 amino acids, respectively, and share only 26.1% amino acid sequence identity, Almeida et al. showed that a consensus amino acid sequence, LRKxGxKG, is observed in the nsp1s of SARS-CoV and MHV (Almeida et al., 2007), and a similar sequence of LRKxGxGG was also conserved in MERS-CoV nsp1, as shown in\nFig. 7A. In addition, both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV possess RNA cleavage activity in nsp1 and the amino acid sequences of RK responsible for RNA cleavage are conserved in R124/K125 and R146/K147, respectively, within the conserved sequence, as shown in blue in Fig. 7A (Lokugamage et al., 2012, Lokugamage et al., 2015). Our previous report showed the positively charged R124 in the consensus sequence for RNA cleavage in SARS-CoV nsp1 is also crucial for binding to the viral 5\u2032 UTR (Tanaka et al., 2012). However, R146A substitution in MERS-CoV nsp1 exhibited no effect on the interaction with the 5\u2032 UTR of viral RNA (data not shown). Interestingly, the mutation of R13A in MERS-CoV nsp1, which is distant from the conserved sequence, abrogated the interaction with the 5\u2032 UTR of viral RNA (Fig. 4C), suggesting that the binding domain in nsp1 with the 5\u2032 UTR of viral RNA is different between MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV. In fact, SARS-CoV nsp1 has a deletion in the region corresponding to R13 in MERS-CoV nsp1, as shown in Fig. 7A. Although the partial structure information of SARS-CoV nsp1 (aa 13\u2013128) revealed a novel complex beta-barrel fold by using NMR (Almeida et al., 2007), no structural information on either the N or C terminal regions was available due to their flexibilities (Almeida et al., 2007). The secondary structure of MERS-CoV nsp1 predicted by PSIPRED v3.3 (Buchan et al., 2013) suggested that R13 is located in an alpha-helix structure, as shown in Fig. 7A. Collectively, these data suggest that SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are evolved to utilize R124 and R13 in nsp1, respectively, for interaction with the 5\u2032 UTR of viral RNA to circumvent the nsp1-mediated shutoff. Further structural analysis studies will be needed to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying the interaction of MERS-CoV nsp1 with the 5\u2032 UTR of viral RNA.",

Many cis-acting sequences have been identified, and their functional roles in viral RNA transcription and replication were investigated by using defective interfering RNAs (Kim and Makino, 1995, Raman et al., 2003, Raman and Brian, 2005). The 5\u2032 UTR of MERS-CoV possesses 4 stem-loops, SL1, SL2, SL4-1, and SL4-2, which are conserved among beta coronaviruses (Yang and Leibowitz, 2015). As previously shown for SARS-CoV SL1 (Tanaka et al., 2012), we found here that MERS-CoV SL1, which is located in both genomic and subgenomic viral RNAs, plays a critical role in viral replication through the interaction with nsp1. Although the structural significance of SL1 in both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV remains to be investigated, SL1 is critical for the recognition of viral RNA by the nsp1s of both CoVs, suggesting that the interaction between SL1 and nsp1 is an ideal therapeutic target for infection with CoV.",

In fact, a mutant MHV possessing a deletion in the N-terminal region of nsp1 was replication defective in DBT-9 cells (Brockway and Denison, 2005). In addition, SL5 of CoV was shown to be crucial as a cis-acting element and packaging signal (Brown et al., 2007, Chen and Olsthoorn, 2010, Guan et al., 2011). Although the R13A mutant was defective in RNA replication, the A9G/R13A mutant, which retained the SL5 structure, successfully replicated in Huh7 and Vero cells (Fig. 6), suggesting that RNA structures in SL5B, C and/or D of MERS-CoV act as cis-acting elements and are critical for viral replication.",

Although the functional relevance of the nuclear localization of nsp1 remains unclear, nsp1 in the nucleus has been suggested to participate in host gene transcription or mRNA export. In MHV, nsp1 localizes to the site of RNA replication through an interaction with nsp7 and nsp10 upon infection, while nsp1 translocates to the assembly site of infectious particles at a late stage of infection (Brockway et al., 2004). These data suggest that the nsp1 of CoVs participates not only in RNA replication but also in particle assembly processes. Further studies are needed to clarify the roles of nsp1 in the life cycle of CoVs.",
