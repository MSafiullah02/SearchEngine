However, insufficient genomic annotation hampers detailed studies of ferret T cell responses. In this study, we analyzed the published T cell receptor beta (TRB) locus and performed high-throughput sequencing (HTS) of peripheral blood of four healthy adult ferrets to identify expressed V, D, J, and C genes. The HTS data is used as a guide to manually curate the expressed V, D, J, and C genes. The ferret locus appears to be most similar to that of the dog. Like other mammalian TRB loci, the ferret TRB locus contains a library of variable genes located upstream of two D-J-C gene clusters, followed by a (in the ferret non-functional) V gene with an inverted transcriptional orientation. All TRB genes (expressed or not) reported here have been approved by the IMGT/WHO-IUIS nomenclature committee.",

Ferret infection models are well suited to study the pathogenicity and transmissibility of Coronaviruses (SARS), Pneumoviridae (RSV) and Orthomyxoviruses that include human and avian influenza viruses (Enkirch and von Messling 2015; Oh and Hurt 2016) . Ferrets are an attractive mammalian model species for these infections since ferrets and humans share similar lung physiology, and most notably a very similar (viral) receptor distribution throughout the respiratory tract (Belser et al. 2011; van Riel et al. 2006) . A significant drawback of the ferret model is a lack of ferret specific reagents for detailed studies of the host immune response to these pathogens. Nevertheless, the use of the ferret model has increased over the years, and its usage, with the recent publication of the ferret (draft) genome (Peng et al. 2014) , is likely to increase even further. Currently, little is known about the T cell receptor (TCR) repertoire of the ferret, limiting the options to monitor the immune response of ferrets to experimental infections with influenza virus and other pathogens.",

The \u03b2 chain (at least in humans) tends to interact more closely with the peptide antigen than the \u03b1 chain (Glanville et al. 2017) , making the TRB locus the most interesting first candidate to annotate in detail.",

We find that the TRB locus of the ferret has a similar structure to that of other mammalian TRB loci, such as mouse and human (Glusman et al. 2001) , bovine (Connelley et al. 2009 ), dog (Mineccia et al. 2012) , and rabbit (Antonacci et al. 2014 ): a library of V genes, followed by two (or three in bovine) D-J-C clusters. Each cluster consists of one D gene, six or seven (six in ferret) J genes, and a single C gene. The D-J-C clusters are followed by a V gene with an inverted transcriptional orientiation. We also performed a phylogenetic analysis, showing that the ferret V and J genes are indeed most closely related to those of the dog. The ferret locus is small like that of the dog, about 300 Kb, and has a (largely) conserved synteny with the dog TRB locus. Our annotation of the ferret TRB locus will enable detailed studies of T cell responses to support research on novel or improved antiviral strategies for influenza and other viral infections employing the ferret as a model organism. All TRB genes identified in our analysis (expressed or not) have been approved by the IMGT/WHO-IUIS nomenclature committee.",

This splice variant occurs on average in more than 25% of the sequence reads that align to TRBV19 in each of the four ferrets. To be able to detect this non-functional variant, sequence reads should extend nearly 200 bp into the V-EXON region. If reads do not extend this far into the V gene, this may lead to an overestimation of the expression level of V genes having such non-functional splice variants. To this end repertoire sequencing experiments should use reads that are long enough to detect the splice variants, or perform a bias correction based on dedicated experiments quantifying the proportion of non-functional splice variants in the ferret population.

Both D-J-C clusters span about 7 Kb and consist of one D gene, six J genes, followed by a C gene. About 11 Kb downstream of the second D-J-C cluster, there is a TRBV gene (TRBV30) with an inverted transcriptional orientation.

            "text": "As previously described (Mineccia et al. 2012) , the CDR3 length distribution is highly conserved, which in this study is also confirmed as the ferret and the human have nearly identical CDR3 length distributions (Supplemental Figure S2 ). Despite the relatively low number of V genes in the TRB locus of the ferret, the ferret repertoire is highly diverse as there is hardly any overlap in TCR\u03b2 chains between the ferrets (Supplemental Figure S3 and S4). Within ferrets the TCR\u03b2 chain overlap between samples is about 50%, probably reflecting the presence of memory clonotypes in the blood that have expanded due to antigen stimulation.",
