The outbreak, first localized to Wuhan, quickly spread to neighbouring provinces and within three months was declared a pandemic, with cases reported in nearly 200 countries in all regions of the world. As of 8 April 2020, the pandemic has been resulted in over one million four hundred thousand confirmed cases and over 76, 000 deaths, including over 655,000 cases and 51, 000 deaths in Europe. While China has not registered new cases for several days, parts of western Europe have become the foci of the COVID-19 pandemic. The close association between humans and their pets has led to an examination of the potential risks of transmission. Viral RNA has been detected in two dogs and two cats, belonging to SARS-CoV-2 infected owners, in Hong Kong and Li\u00e8ge, Belgium. While pale in comparison with the scale of infection in the human population, these observations have nonetheless provoked many violent reactions towards dogs and cats.",

She returned home on March 8, after recovering from the infection. Saliva and runny nose samples were collected from the dog on three occasions, February 26, 28, and March 2, 2020, and analyzed by specific quantitative PCR. Small amounts of viral RNA were detected in all three samples, indicating that the samples collected had a low viral load [4]. Subsequently, a serological screening, carried out on a blood sample collected on March, 3, 2020, revealed the presence of specific anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies [5]. Thus, it appears that the dog was infected with the virus and had developed a specific immune response. The dog died on March 16, 2020, without ever having developed symptoms consistent with COVID-19. The death of this very old animal was attributed to kidney and heart failures. The low viral titres observed in this dog suggest it had developed a low-productive infection, and the likelihood of infectious transmission was minute or nonexistent.",

Tests of the cat with conventional, qualitative PCR detected SARS-CoV-2 RNA in successive samples of feces and gastric fluids, which was further confirmed by next-generation sequencing.

This subfamily is subdivided into four genera, Alphacoronavirus (alpha-CoV), Betacoronavirus (beta-CoV), Gammacoronavirus (gamma-CoV) and Deltacoronavirus (delta-CoV) [12,13]. To date, only seven coronaviruses have been reported in humans, four of which are ubiquitous with seasonal circulation and mostly causing relatively mild colds (HKU1, NL63, OC43 and 229E). The other three, of more recent zoonotic origin, are associated with severe acute respiratory syndromes, namely SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and now SARS-CoV-2 [14]. Of these seven human coronaviruses, NL63 and 229E belong to the alpha-CoV genus, while the other five are included within the beta-CoV genus. Coronaviruses detected in dogs and cats also belong to these two viral genera [15,16]. Like SARS-CoV-2 and the other respiratory syndrome viruses, the canine respiratory coronavirus (CRCoV), responsible for a respiratory pathology in dogs, belongs to the beta-CoV genus. The S protein of CRCoV, responsible for attachment to the host cell membrane, has nearly 97% sequence similarity with that of HCoV-OC43, probably due recombination [17]. Canine coronavirus (CCoV) and Feline coronavirus (FCoV), both responsible for digestive diseases, belong to Alphacoronavirus.",

While the Spike protein of SARS-CoV2 does bind well to the ACE2 of humans, ferrets, cats, and other species that have high receptor homology [20]. In addition to the wide variety of SARS-CoV-related coronaviruses reported in Rhinolophus bats (including bats sampled in Europe), closely related viruses have also been found in masked-palm civets (Paguma larvata) and raccoon dogs (Nyctereutes procyonoides), two species in the order of Carnivora which includes cats and dogs [[21], [22], [23], [24]]. The diversity of species susceptible to SARS-CoV and SARS-Cov-2 related viruses strongly suggests a propensity of these viruses to cross the species barrier, particularly in the context of the frequent encounters between carnivores and others small mammals that may facilitate interspecies transmission.",

            "text": "The coronavirus genome encodes 16 major non-structural proteins (nsp1 to nsp16), and four major structural proteins. The structural proteins include the nucleocapsid (N) protein which associates with genomic RNA, and the envelope-constituting spike (S) protein, membrane (M) protein and envelop (E) protein (some coronaviruses also have a hemagglutinin esterase (HE) structural protein). Protein S is a membrane glycoprotein, consisting of two subunits, which is involved in the attachment of the virus to the host cell, membrane fusion, and entry into the cell [25]. The globular S1 subunit allows the virion to attach to the target cell via an interaction between an approximate 100 amino acids receptor binding domain (RBD), and a receptor located on the surface of the host cell (for example angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) in the case of SARS-CoV-2). The S2 subunit promotes virion fusion with the host cell membrane. The S1 subunit, and the RBD, in particular, is the most variable part of the coronavirus genome. Because of its high genetic variability and its primary role in host cell attachment and infection, the RBD is strongly associated with the cellular tropism and host spectrum of the virus. A very recent study has shown that the SARS-CoV-2 RBD, including sites directly attaching to the ACE2 receptor of human cells, is almost identical to SARS-CoV RBD [19,20,26]. Only six amino acids appear responsible SRARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 attachment to the ACE2 receptor and may, therefore, be important in determining the host spectrum of these two viruses. Based on structural and biochemical properties, the SARS-CoV-2 RBD would not only have an affinity for the human ACE2 receptor but also for that of several animal species, including pets (dogs, cats, and ferrets) and farm animals (cattle, sheep and horses) [27]. The apparent plasticity of the S protein, and in particular the RBD, may allow coronaviruses to initially bind and then adapt to ACE2 protein receptors of different species, giving them a higher likelihood of SARS-CoV2 crossing the species barrier [19]. Thus, many animals could be infected with SARS-CoV-2 and serve as intermediate hosts in the spread of the virus. In the context of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the possibility of dogs and cats becoming infected and participating in the spread of the virus should be addressed.",

The RNA genome of coronaviruses is one of the largest known, ranging in size from 27,000 to 31,000 nucleotides. The genome's large size promotes the appearance of point mutations, deletions, or insertions, which can sometimes lead to the emergence of new variants with different phenotypic characteristics. These mutations are significant, even though SARS-CoV2 has some proofreading capability. Specifically, the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) of SARS-CoV2, which is remarkably similar to that of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV [28] has a limited proofreading capability. Coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV2 encode a proofreading 3\u2032-to\u20195\u2032 exoribonuclease distinct from the viral RdRp, which imparts some fidelity during reproduction, enhance virulence, and by resisting some mutations, frustrates efforts at using some antiviral drugs that rely on mis-incorporations during RNA synthesis [29].",

Genetic recombination is an exchange of genetic material that can be autologous, when the exchange occurs between viruses affecting the same host species, or heterologous when the exchange is between viruses affecting different host species. For example, recombination of the S protein appears to be a common feature of some coronaviruses that are pathogenic to cats and dogs [30,31]. Similarly, genetic recombination events within human CoVs are well documented [14]. The high prevalence of dog infections with canine coronaviruses in Europe [32] might foster recombination with SARS-CoV-2 if an animal were infected with both viruses. Such an event, if it were to happen, could lead to the emergence of a new coronavirus with unpredictable phenotypic characteristics (transmissibility and virulence). However, the likelihood of such a scenario is difficult to assess.",

This concern is highlighted by a recent experimental study which, while performed using non-natural conditions, in particular, that newborn animals were infected with a very high viral load, showed that SARS-CoV-2 has the ability to infect several different pet species [33]. While viral shedding from pets does not appear sufficient to in turn infect other family members or other animals encountered during walks, the usual precautionary measures should be urgently considered as part of a global control and \u2018one health\u2019 approach. Finally, it is imperative that further studies be quickly carried out in order to better establish the risk of contamination of pets from humans as well as the risk that infected pets have as source of infection for humans.",
