These conditions are resulted from a primary defect in B-cells. Though to a lesser extent, they are caused by a defect in T-cells or other immune cell populations known to contribute to B-cell or plasma cell development and function. Overall, PADs are characterized by a malfunctioned antibody response which is reflected in low or undetectable levels of immunoglobulin(s). As a result, recurrent infection is the most common presentation leading to diagnosis of PADs. It would also remain the cause of most complications during the course of disease. Overall, physicians who are the most likely to encounter patients with PADs are those of infectious disease specialists [1].",

Therefore, patients with respiratory infections need particular attention. They should be prescribed an appropriate therapy as soon as possible and have to be adhering to more and longer medical therapies. Immunoglobulin substitution therapy along with prophylactic antibiotics remained the cornerstone of treatment for PADs and related complications [2]. Generally, immunoglobulin replacement therapy can effectively reduce both incidence and severity of infections [2]. However, immunoglobulin products contain only purified IgG antibodies and lack other antibody isotypes. It is thus expected that pulmonary infections may persist and even flourish under regular immunoglobulin replacement therapy. Thereby, the patient will be more predisposed to chronic lung diseases and related severe sequels such as respiratory failure [3]. Recent studies have identified a gap for screening protocols to monitor respiratory manifestations in patients with PADs [4].",

In particular, a prospective study of 101 individuals with XLA reported the presence of at least one of these three infectious complications: pneumonia, sinusitis, and chronic lung disease with bronchiectasis in 76% of patients with XLA [14]. Moreover, the majority of infections affect the upper and lower respiratory tracts [16, 10, 18, 32] and are of bacterial origin, among which bronchitis, pneumonia, chronic sinusitis, otitis, and conjunctivitis are the most common complications of XLA [33]. Infections occur not only before diagnosis but remain a major cause of complications during the course of disease, immunoglobulin substitution, and death in patients with XLA [32, 10]. The most common infections prior to and after diagnosis include otitis media, pneumonia, and sinusitis [9, 29].",

            "text": "Pneumonia is the most common acute infection associated with XLA [14]. Recurrent pneumonia should be, therefore, regarded as an alarm sign for PIDs including XLA [34, 35]. Before the diagnosis is made, between 60% and 83% of patients with XLA have a history of at least one episode of pneumonia [36], and approximately 30% of patients have a history of hospitalization due to pneumonia [16]. With an adequate immunoglobulin therapy, the rate of pneumonias is reduced by more than 10% [14] and lies within the range of 0.00\u20130.10 pneumonias per treatment year [13, 37]. However, approximately 50% of patients might experience deterioration in their respiratory status while receiving immunoglobulin therapy [38]. The rate of infectious episodes during immunoglobulin therapy seems to be age-related, since there is a threefold increased risk for infections in adult patients compared with pediatric patients (2.12 vs. 0.74 infections/patient/year) [38]. More important is that pneumonias after initiation of immunoglobulin therapy might be severe as many as half of episodes might require hospitalization for intravenous antibiotic treatment [13]. In multivariate analysis, patients with bronchiectasis had a > 3-fold increased risk of pneumonia during the 5-year immunoglobulin therapy [14]. Its source remained unknown in almost 80% of cases. However, sputum cultures could reveal the following as bacterial pathogens underlying pneumonia in patients with XLA: Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, and Mycoplasma pneumonia [13, 33]. Analysis of bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) in patients with XLA without acute pulmonary function identified bacterial pathogens such as Haemophilus influenzae and Veillonella [39]. Also, bacteria that were observed through protected specimen brush samples included Haemophilus influenzae, \u03b2-hemolytic streptococci, and Porphyromonas [39]. Other bacterial pathogens found in association with pneumonia among patients with XLA are Pseudomonas species and M. tuberculosis [16]. Looking at chest X-ray, pneumonia in patients with XLA can cause peribronchial thickening and then segmental atelectasis [13]. Antigen-specific immunological responses might predict the risk of respiratory tract infections in patients with XLA. More precisely, individuals who developed IgG and IgM responses specific to bacteriophage phi-X 174 were less likely to be affected by respiratory tract infections (RTI) compared with those who developed only IgM responses [22]. Although very rare, there are reports of pulmonary infections with fungal (aspergillosis and Pneumocystis jiroveci) [40] and viral pathogens (respiratory syncytial virus) [41\u201343] in patients with XLA even despite regular immunoglobulin substitution therapy. Chronic sinusitis seems to predispose individuals with XLA to pulmonary aspergillosis [40].",

However, an abnormal chest X-ray clearly warrants that pulmonary function is impaired [13]. Patients with XLA show changes in pulmonary function test (PFT) that favor obstructive lung disease. These include a reduction in forced expiratory volume in the first second (FEV1) as well as a reduction in forced expiratory flow (FEF) [13]. Pulmonary function abnormalities appear not to be age-related [13]. The delay in diagnosis has shown an inverse association with the risk of chronic lung disease. Supporting this, lung function decreases with aging in patients with XLA and is worsened by smoking and bronchiectasis. A longitudinal study of patients with XLA (n = 8) over an average period of 7.6 years calculated an average annual decline of 65 \u00b1 11 mL/year and 58 \u00b1 20 mL/year for FEV1 and FVC, respectively [15]. Immunoglobulin therapy dose demonstrated a negative association with lung function decline. This reflects the protective effect of immunoglobulin therapy [15].",

This may indicate that delayed diagnosis might leave patients facing higher risk of CLD [18]. CLD is observed in 40% of patients with XLA who had a history of LRTI. Approximately, 30% of patients develop CLD later in the course of disease [16]. CLD risk after diagnosis of XLA is predicted by pneumonia and inappropriate immunoglobulin substitution therapy [16]. Study of 201 US patients with XLA identified CLD as the cause of death in 25% of cases [9]. CLD also has been shown to have a negative impact on the life quality of patients with XLA [44].",

A study of Australian adults estimated a twofold incidence of infection with bronchiectasis compared to infection without bronchiectasis among patients with XLA (67% vs. 33%) [45]. In a multicenter study of 199 patients with XLA, the use of high-resolution chest CT imaging indicated a prevalence of bronchiectasis as high as 56% [33]. The prevalence of bronchiectasis increases with age [14] and that turning 18 years old was the most important factor predictive of bronchiectasis [33]. However, other factors associated with an increased risk of bronchiectasis included a history of pneumonia and treatment with IVIG compared with subcutaneous IG [33]. In addition, patients with chronic sinusitis were four times more likely to have bronchiectasis [14]. It is important that almost half of patients with XLA suffer from chronic sinusitis [14], whereas no effect of IgG levels on the risk of bronchiectasis was found [14]. The age range for development of bronchiectasis was 7\u201345 years [33]. Regardless of age, bronchiectasis lowers lung function as reflected in reduced FEV1 [33]. Bronchiectasis is, therefore, the real cause of diminished life quality among patients with XLA [38]. CXR findings are often evident in the middle and lower lobes of the lung(s) [11]. HRCT appears to be more sensitive than CXR for evaluation of pulmonary abnormalities in patients with primary hypogammaglobulinemia including XLA [46].",

Upon stimulation, Fc\u03b3RIIa is recruited from intracellular compartments to the cell surface. Fc\u03b3RIIa recruitment is accompanied with activation of Btk, which in turn induces the expression of adaptor molecule MyD88. In this manner, Btk act to direct cross talk between Fc\u03b3RIIa and toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) [49]. It is followed by engagement of MyD88 adapter-like (Mal)/TIRAP interaction which plays a crucial role in TLR-dependent NF-kappaB (NF-\u03baB) pro-inflammatory responses [50]. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) mainly MMP9 induced by NF-\u03baB contribute to tissue remodeling in acute lung injury. As expected, Btk inhibitors could abrogate the expression of both Btk and MyD88 in human neutrophils activated with anti-IL-8/IL-8 immune complexes [48]. Additionally, treatments blocking either Btk or MMP9 diminished the expression of MMP9 in neutrophils from mice exposed to secondhand smoke [51]. Altogether, it is plausible to think of Btk-targeted neutrophil-specific therapy in conditions associated with acute lung injury (ALI)/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) [48] and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) [51].",

RNA interference (RNAi) of Btk has been demonstrated to decrease protein levels of Btk and phosphorylated Btk (p-Btk) and diminish the expression and activation of Btk in alveolar macrophages [54]. In a mouse model of cecal ligation and puncture (CLP)-induced sepsis, pretreatment with Btk RNAi was able to prevent epithelial cell apoptosis, pulmonary edema, vascular permeability, the expression of inflammatory cytokines (TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, and IL-6) and signaling (NF-\u03baB), and neutrophil lung infiltration.",

The authors demonstrated that defect in the Ig\u03b1 gene results in complete blocking of B-cell development as defect in the IGHM. This study proved that the functional role of Ig\u03b1 as a component of signal transduction molecule is not less than the role that the mu heavy chain plays as a structural component of pre-BCR. The second one was reported by Wang et al. 2002 [79].

Mutations in TCF3 have been reported in both autosomal recessive [93] and autosomal dominant [94] agammaglobulinemia. The authors in [93] described a patient with B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) presented with profound hypogammaglobulinemia, recurrent pneumonia, meningitis, pancytopenia, and splenomegaly. His immunological findings included less than 1 percent normal number of CD19+ B-cells in the periphery in the presence of normal counts of CD3+, CD4+, and CD8+ T-cells. Boisson et al. 2013 [94] identified the same de novo mutation in the TCF3 gene (within the exon that encodes E47) in four patients with an unusual phenotype characterized by almost complete absence of BCR in the presence of increased expression of CD19 on B-cells [95]. All patients presented severe hypogammaglobulinemia and less than 3 percent CD19+ cells in the periphery. Age at diagnosis ranged from 9 months to 4 years. Clinical presentations included pneumococcal meningitis, recurrent otitis, vaccine-associated polio, and arthritis. Other clinical findings were dermatitis and hepatomegaly.",

Infections have a propensity to affect the respiratory and gastrointestinal tract [98, 99]. The following are infectious complications documented in GS: recurrent sinopulmonary infection, CMV disease, bacteremia, oral or esophageal candidiasis, persistent mucocutaneous candidiasis, chronic diarrhea, urinary tract infections, P. carinii pneumonia, tuberculosis, Kaposi sarcoma, disseminated varicella, candidemia, wound infection with Clostridium perfringens, Mycoplasma arthritis, etc. However, the main clinical findings at presentation appear to be sinopulmonary infections with encapsulated bacteria. When compared to patients with CVID, patients with GS experience a more difficult course of immunodeficiency complicated with opportunistic infections such as P. carinii pneumonia, mycobacterium tuberculosis, and mucocutaneous candidiasis, resembling that which occurs in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection [100]. Therefore, if a patient with thymoma or CVID develops refractory infections, then we should consider GS as a differential diagnosis. Particularly, persistent infection (pneumonia) following thymectomy might warrant that your patient is very likely to have GS [101\u2013105]. Overall, respiratory manifestations in association with GS include recurrent sinopulmonary infections (sinusitis, rhinosinusitis, otitis media, and pneumonia) [106\u2013114] with bacterial (especially with encapsulated bacteria including Haemophilus influenzae), fungal (aspergillus and P. carinii), and viral (CMV and HSV) pathogens [115\u2013121], tracheobronchitis [118], diffuse panbronchiolitis [122\u2013124], granulomatous lung disease [125], and pulmonary nodules [123]. As for patients with other forms of agammaglobulinemia, patients with GS remain dependent on immunoglobulin replacement therapy. A recent study has estimated the median survival of 14 years for 47 patients with GS [111].",

            "text": "PI3K-\u03b4 is a class I PI3K isoform proven to particularly contribute to both innate and adaptive immune responses [129]. Such contribution is resulted from its interaction with Akt, together triggering the PI3K-\u03b4/Akt signaling pathway. Increased activation of this signaling pathway is thought to mediate airway inflammation as seen in obstructive lung diseases [131, 132] and induced by cigarette smoking [133]. Moreover, PI3K-\u03b4 is able to reduce glucocorticoid sensitivity of airways ([131, 132]. This explains why some patients are resistant to glucocorticoids. Supporting this, PI3K-\u03b4 inhibitor can mitigate allergic inflammation in asthma models [134]. The effect remained true upon exposure to Aspergillus fumigatus. At least part of this anti-inflammatory effect of PI3K-\u03b4 inhibitor appears to be mediated through reducing endoplasmic reticulum stress [135], hypoxia-inducible factor-1\u03b1 (HIF-1\u03b1), and nucleotide-binding domain, leucine-rich-containing family, and pyrin domain-containing-3 (NLRP3) expression in lung tissue [136, 134]. All these factors are involved in generating inflammatory responses upon stimulation [136]. Additionally, PI3K-\u03b4 contributes to virus escape possibly by increasing the expression of B7-H1 (PD-L1) [137]. Therefore, it is well-expected that APDS, a condition associated with PI3K-\u03b4 upregulation, should be accompanied with bacterial and viral infections as well as different respiratory manifestations.",

For example, anti-inflammatory effect of erythromycin and dexamethasone seems to be mediated via suppression of PI3K-\u03b4 signaling [140]. Animal models of asthma demonstrate that PI3K-\u03b4 blockade hampers infiltration of inflammatory cells by decreasing vascular permeability [141]. Moreover, PI3K-\u03b4 inhibition can help to regain glucocorticoid sensitivity and, therefore, enhance anti-inflammatory effects of glucocorticoids [131, 132, 142]. However, attention should be paid that over-suppression of this pathway might cause toxicities. As for APDS, PI3K-\u03b4 function is abnormally high in malignant states particularly B-cell malignancies [143]. As a result, PI3K-\u03b4 inhibitor (idelalisib) can be used to treat these malignancies [144]. However, it might reduce cellular respiration and so be toxic to lung tissues [145].",

He was refractory to regular IVIG and all antimicrobial agents, and his respiratory condition deteriorated during these treatments. Diffuse lung disease with peripheral nodules was found at CT scans.

Its cytoplasmic tail is comprised of nine tyrosine kinase residues that contribute to intracellular signaling. To our knowledge, there have been reported ten cases of CD19 deficiency [154\u2013160]. The genetic defects responsible for CD19 deficiency include mutations resulting in premature termination codons and also missense mutations leading to an amino acid change. Overall, CD19 deficiency is featured by respiratory manifestations such as recurrent respiratory tract infections (pneumonia, bronchiolitis, and otitis media), wheezing, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, atopy, and asthma [154]. Hypogammaglobulinemia (IgG and IgM) is also commonly found in patients with CD19 deficiency. Infectious pathogens found in these patients are respiratory syncytial virus, Haemophilus influenzae, and Streptococcus pneumoniae. CXR and CT scans reveal lobar atelectasis, peribronchial thickening, and bronchiectasis. Despite absence of CD19+ B-cells, flow cytometry can be used to confirm presence of CD20+ B-cells. Patients are also likely to have reduced numbers of transitional B-cells, memory B-cells, CD3+ T cells, and CD16+/CD56+ NK cells. Interestingly, studies indicate a delay between Ca2+ influx and stimulation with anti-IgM in B-cells from patients with CD19 deficiency. It should be noted that Ca2+ influx plays a crucial role in BCR signaling.",

About 13% of patients reveal a severe defect in switched memory B-cells (IgD-CD27+ cell percentage \u22642% of B-cells), which is related to an increased need for antibiotic therapy.

These patients are prone to progress to chronic sinusitis and CLD including bronchiectasis. As expected, longitudinal studies show that the prevalence of chronic sinusitis and CLD will increase by time [186]. Studies estimate the prevalence of CLD to be between 22% and 67.5% in patients with CVID [182\u2013184, 186]. In particular, bronchiectasis is found in 37\u201358% of patients with CVID [181, 182]. Patients who have a positive sputum culture are more likely to demonstrate evidence of bronchiectasis in HRCT [187]. In addition to the pathogens mostly involved in respiratory tract infections including Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae, bronchiectasis has been associated with Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, and Corynebacterium spp. [182]. A severe defect in total B-cells (CD19+ cell percentage \u22641%) was present in about 40% of patients and was associated with a higher risk of bronchiectasis. In addition, patients with CD4+ cell count below 700 cells/\u03bcL, patients with a history of pneumonia, and patients with older age were more prone to bronchiectasis [188].",

Patients with defects in T-cell function, low CD3+ cell count, and low CD8+ cell count are more likely to develop GLILD. The presence of GLILD has been linked to dyspnea, splenomegaly, restrictive pattern of pulmonary function (a low DLCO), consolidation, ground-glass opacity, interstitial infiltrates, and reticular pulmonary opacification. GLILD in CVID has been associated with a higher prevalence of HHV8 infection, leading to an increased risk of lymphoproliferative disorders [193]. It is promising that monoclonal antibodies and immunosuppressive agents can effectively assist with resolution of granulomas and restoration of lung structure [194].

A higher dose of replacement immunoglobulin is, however, required to benefit cases with CLD including bronchiectasis [196]. Regular immunoglobulin therapy has shown to be effective in reducing the incidence of acute infections. A study of 50 patients with CVID with pneumonia demonstrated that the prevalence of pneumonia was reduced from 84% to 22% following immunoglobulin therapy [197]. Additionally, immunoglobulin therapy can effectively improve pulmonary function test results and HRCT scores in patients with CVID with CLD [196]. Such improvement does not appear to reach significance in cases with CVID without CLD [196]. Given that the mortality of CVID increases with age, it is not clear whether it can be effective in long term as well as short term. Lung transplant is the option available to patients with respiratory failure. Altogether, acute or chronic respiratory tract infections and associated respiratory failure are a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with CVID [187, 186], especially in cases below 40 years of age [183].",

The effects that CD20 deficiency might have on lung tissues can be tackled in those who received anti-CD20 treatments. As reviewed by [201], anti-CD20 treatments predispose patients to severe and refractory respiratory infections with bacteria, fungi, and viruses, while, anti-CD20 antibodies are being increasingly used to treat autoimmune diseases and non-Hodgkin lymphoma [202]. This has been parallel by increasing the number of cases of pneumocystis pneumonia [203]. This increased susceptibility might be due to suppressive effect of anti-CD20 antibodies on type 2 helper T (Th2) responses, e.g., production of cytokines interleukin (IL)-4, IL-5, and IL-13 [202]. Moreover, there is a report of antisynthetase syndrome after treatment with rituximab, a CD20 monoclonal antibody [204]. The patient was presented with recurrent respiratory infections, arthropathy, and interstitial pneumonitis. Immunoglobulin replacement therapy was shown to improve immunodeficiency and pneumonitis. It is also interesting that treatment with 25-OH vitamin D3 has been shown to enhance CD20 levels [205].",

In this manner, myeloid cells (CD11+ cells) expressing this co-stimulator can contribute to the generation of inflammatory processes in lung tissues [207]. What more supports this is increased expression of ICOS in autoimmune conditions (acute graft-versus-host disease) and allergic airway diseases [208]. Also, its ligand ICOS-L display by dendritic cells is capable to improve Treg or Th17 responses [209], whose pathogenic roles in autoimmunity and organ rejection have been well-described [210]. ICOS deficiency in mice could diminish lung tissue fibrosis [211] and delay rejection of the transplanted bronchus by reduction of relative numbers of Th17, Th2, and Treg cells [54]. By contrast, lung fibrosis was exacerbated in isolated ICOS-L deficiency and in double ICOS/ICOS-L deficiency [211].",

This TLR4-dependent protection was accompanied by engagement of CD4+ T-cells expressing ICOS [213]. Additionally, adoptive transfer of CD4+ T-cells expressing ICOS could reverse allergen-induced airway hyper-responsiveness [213]. Whereas, inhibition of TLR4 signaling (TLR4-TRIF pathway) exacerbating allergen-induced airway hyper-responsiveness resulted in a reduction of CD4+ T-cells expressing ICOS [214]. Therefore, ICOS deficiency is expected to increase the risk of allergic airway diseases. As for B-cells expressing CD40, all CVID patients show diminished number of CD4+ T-cells expressing ICOS [215].",

Upon exposure to viral dsRNA, Ig class switching is induced by TLR3-expressing B-cells of the upper respiratory tract. NFKB activation and TLR3 signaling are central to Ig class switching, which are in turn required for production of IgA and IgG antibodies in response to viral antigens [234]. Patients in intensive care unit (ICU) show increased susceptibility to hospital-acquired pneumonia. This is suggested to be caused by pulmonary IgA deficiency secondary to antibiotic therapy. Patients in this condition often reveal low expression of BAFF [235]. BAFF neutralization in mice has been associated with reduction in the number of antibody-secreting cells (ASC) that contribute to antiviral immunity [218]. Interestingly, immunoglobulin D has been shown to improve immunity in basophils of the upper respiratory tract. Its role is mediated by increasing the expression of pro-inflammatory in addition to B-cell stimulating factors, for example, BAFF [236].",

On the other hand, INO80 is also generated as a nuclear protein to assist with genome replication of herpes simplex virus [262] and with oncogenic transcription and tumorigenesis of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) [263]. However, study of NSCLC cells has recently revealed that the increased activity of chemotherapeutic agents (cisplatin) is underpinned by increased expression of more than 100 genes among which is INO80 [264].",

For children aged 1\u201318 years with recurrent infections and warning signs of immunodeficiency, it is the most commonly diagnosed disease [279]. Compared to other PIDs, patients with SIgAD appear to less prone to lower respiratory tract infection, sepsis, skin infections, mucocutaneous candidiasis, dental alterations, cardiovascular malformations, angioedema, hospitalizations, and death [280]. The world\u2019s epidemiology data indicate that the incidence of SIgAD varies by a family history of SIgAD and ethnicity ranging from 1:18,500 in Japan to 1:143 in the Arabian Peninsula [278, 281]. Intrinsic factors causing IgA deficiency include both monogenic mutations (TNFRSF13B/TACI) [282, 283, 220] and chromosomal abnormalities mainly involving chromosome 18 [278, 1]. SIgAD is indicated by low levels of serum IgA (below 7 mg/dl) in presence of normal levels of IgG and IgM after the age of 4 years in whom other causes of hypogammaglobulinemia have not been identified. Clinical presentations may range from asymptomatic to clinically overt complications including recurrent sinopulmonary infections [284], autoimmune diseases [285], allergies, atopic disorders [286], gastrointestinal disorders, and malignancies [278]. Fortunately, about 65\u201390% of patients with SIgAD are asymptomatic [1, 287]. Only the minority of patients suffer from severe disease. They are those who may progress to CVID at later time points [278]. Follow-up study reveals that unlike patients with partial IgA deficiency and patients with partial IgA + IgG subclass deficiency, patients with selective IgA deficiency never can achieve normal levels of IgA during study [288]. This indicates the importance of periodic monitoring in these patients.",

Circulating IgA which is mainly comprised of IgA1 (80\u201390%) may help to regulate immune response via activation of the phagocyte system and inhibition of neutrophil chemotaxis. Mucosal secretions mainly include IgA2, which is more resistant to bacterial proteases present in the respiratory and gastrointestinal tract than IgA1. Secretory IgA contributes to the coating of mucosa-associated bacteria and therefore plays an important role to prevent penetration of bacteria into the mucosa. In addition, patients with SIgAD demonstrated altered cytokine/chemokine system in terms of increased levels of CXCL10/IP-10, IL-10, and G-CSF and decreased levels of IL-9 and IL-12 (p70) [289].

            "text": "About 40\u201390% of patients with symptomatic SIgAD report recurrent sinopulmonary infections as the most important manifestations leading to diagnosis of SIgAD. In particular, adults with SIgAD are more prone to upper respiratory tract infections (e.g., infectious conjunctivitis, common viral cold, pharyngitis, and laryngitis) and lower respiratory tract infections (e.g., bronchitis and pneumonia) [287]. Overall, the main pathogens involved are encapsulated bacteria including Haemophilus influenzae and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Bronchiectasis and obliterative bronchiolitis represent the most severe respiratory conditions experienced by patients with SIgAD. Studies demonstrate that deficiency of any of IgG subclasses is also present in about 20% of patients with SIgAD [291], rendering them more susceptible to sinopulmonary infections and respiratory insufficiency [292]. Moreover, patients with a low percentage of switched memory B-cells have a higher incidence of pneumonia and bronchiectasis compared to patients with a high percentage of switched memory B-cells [293]. On the contrary, an increased number of IgM-producing B-cells as a compensatory mechanism are commonly found in SIgAD. Because of the functional overlap between IgA and IgM, high levels of secretory IgM may protect patients against infections and help to maintain them asymptomatic [281]. When compared to controls without SIgAD, adults with SIgAD are more likely to be diagnosed with allergic rhinoconjunctivitis, but not asthma [287].",

Immunoglobulin products low in IgA that can be administered to those patients include lyophilized Gammagard, Gammaplex, Vigam, Iveegam, Polygam, and Nanogam with IgA <10 mg/ml. Also lobectomy can be considered in cases of bronchiectasis [305].
