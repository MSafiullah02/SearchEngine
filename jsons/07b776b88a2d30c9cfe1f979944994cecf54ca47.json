In addition to being one of the world's most important consumer driven economies, the US has also, for a long time, embraced the concept of the \"free market\" in developing economic policy. Free market policies involve the removal of regulatory constraints with the goal of improving commercial competitiveness and delivering overall better economic outcomes. Free trade agreements, and removal of tariffs on imports, are also aspects of regulatory liberalisation that can impact international air freight.",

The first international open skies agreement signed was between the United States and the Netherlands in 1992. Since 1991, there has been a steady increase to the number of open skies agreements with the US, and the number of international routes have grown from 4, 859 in 1991 to peak at 8,588 in 2007, just prior to the Global Financial Crisis (GFC). Currently there are 7,977 international routes in operational service to the US in 2018, representing a compound growth of 1.85% per annum since 1991 (Transtats, 2019) . Moreover, air freight (including mail) carried on international routes with the US had grown from 2,214 in 1991 to 2,785 in 2007 and has since fallen to 2,096 US international routes in 2018 (Transtats, 2019) .

The four largest trading partners with the US, namely China, Japan, Germany and the United Kingdom (UK) accounted for US$168 billion or 40.48% of the value of total US imports by air. From mid-2007 to late 2008, deterioration of financial market confidence in the US triggered the Global Financial Crisis (GFC). The demise of the US financial giant Lehman Brothers in 2008 led to direct and indirect consequences for the air freight industry; firstly constrained inter-bank finance made trade difficult for all commercial operations and secondly Lehman Brothers had provided financial backing to Gemini Air Cargo, which subsequently went bankrupt (Morell, 2011 (Morell, , 2013 . In light of the crisis, airlines (amongst others) had to reassess the strength of financial partnerships with their banks.

In 2008 US air imports dropped by 10% in volume. Company inventory levels were reduced during this period, and new purchases deferred, impacting international trade and further contributing to declines in air freight. Air freight value (and volume) would both be impacted by these business decisions made due to lower consumer confidence, both during and immediately after the events of the GFC. In 2009, at the peak of the GFC, US air imports had dropped in total value by over 10% to US$367 billion and volume declined by over 25% to 3.2 million tonnes (United States Census Bureau, 2019). Moreover, Japan (US$35.3 billion in air freight trade to the US in 2018) and South Korea (US$20.4 billion), have faced regional competition from China (US $157.6 billion) and subdued growth over the last decade in air freight trade value with the US (United States Census Bureau, 2019). Merkert et al. (2017) further highlight an important link between air freight and global share of manufacturing and silicon material shipments in particular are considered by IATA (2017) as an important stimulant to demand for air freight. Despite the impact of the GFC and high oil prices afterwards, China has continued to grow their manufacturing capabilities, especially producing consumer electronics such as the iPhone, laptop computers and other high-tech audio-visual equipment. As the most important trading partner to the US in more recent years, China has increased overall market share of air cargo imports to the US from 17.8% in 2007 to 23.7% in 2018 and shipped over 1 million tonnes of commodities by air, worth over US$120 billion, every year since 2012 (United States Census Bureau, 2019), greater than the combined value of the next four major trading partners to the US-Japan, Germany, the United Kingdom and France. China's increasing trade profile has also had a significant regional impact, with air freight trade value between Asia and the US doubling since 2003 as shown in Fig. 2 .",

US international air freight import value increased again in 2011, by over 11%, despite a reduction in volume of almost 5%. Stagnant growth in volumes post-GFC could be attributed to several macroeconomic factors-higher oil prices, attention on US budget deficits and continued trade imbalance (the \"fiscal cliff\"), low consumer confidence, as well as continued regional economic crises amongst trading nations (such as the European sovereign crisis). Brent crude rose above US$100 per barrel in 2012/13 and remained so until late 2014 (NASDAQ, 2019), and potentially as a result there was minimal growth in US air imports for this period. Kupfer et al. (2017) express a strong relationship between air freight and trade, noting that the price of oil and air cargo yields have a significant impact to air cargo, despite the fact that airlines can utilise financial instruments such as hedging to mitigate costs, operationally introduce fuel surcharges or cross-subsidise belly-hold freight capacity with passenger volumes above break-even margins (passenger load factors for flights have hit a July peak load factor record of 85.2%, IATA, 2018b). In the latter half of 2014, the benchmark Brent crude oil price D.W. Alexander and R. Merkert began to drop to below US$60 per barrel, providing cost relief for airlines and the air freight industry (amongst others). US air freight imports continue to grow with Brent crude reported at just over US$63.42/barrel recently (November 15th, 2019 pricing, NASDAQ, 2019).",

This initial model includes elasticities and considers bilateral trade flows. Gravity models have been used in air cargo research, either inclusive of air passenger transport services (Matsumoto, 2004 (Matsumoto, , 2007 Domae, 2018, 2019) or independently (such as by Yamaguchi, 2008; Achard, 2008; Gong et al., 2014; Vega, 2014 , Gong et al., 2018 ; as a means of comparison with other modes to air transport (Quandt and Baumol, 1966; Feyrer, 2009; Gadala-Maria, 2014; Avetisyan and Hertel, 2015) and air traffic forecasting (Long, 1970; Turner, 2001; Bhadra and Kee, 2008; Srindhi and Manrai, 2014; Xia and Yu, 2015) . Matsumoto (2004) uses gravity models to assess air transport flows of international air passengers and cargo across Asia, Europe and America between 1982 and 1998, finding that concentration of air traffic had strengthened around core hubs during this time period. Matsumoto (2007) followed his earlier research by separating air passenger and air cargo traffic at the international level, finding a small, but counterintuitive, coefficient for the impact that distance has on cargo volumes, which may be a result of unobserved factors within his study. Yamaguchi (2008) utilised gravity model applications to assess US exports and air transport policies such as \"open skies\" to 21 trading partners. Yamaguchi found that \"open sky\" markets increased air cargo unit costs, possibly as a result of congestion in core hubs previously documented by Matsumoto (2004) . These findings appear counterintuitive to a primary goal of air transport liberalisation in fostering competition, which should decrease cost, for the benefit of consumers (Iches, 2010) . Achard (2008) develops a gravity model to assess air transport liberalisation on international air cargo flows, finding GDP to be a counterintuitively negative factor, whilst noting that substitution to surface transport modes may impair his results. Vega (2014) developed gravity models for trade between developing countries and established mega-economies such as the US and European Union with GDP per capita, distance, population, air freight rates, and with dummy variables for liberalisation (open skies), landlocked or island nations. An interesting finding of his research is that for a one percent increase in GDP per capita, perishable exports appear to increase by just 0.78% and high value exports by 2.93%. Gong et al. (2014) used gravity models to assess the position of Chinese airlines in the air cargo industry, as China is a manufacturing conglomerate. Their findings indicate that the coefficient estimations are \"intuitively correct\", with GDP representing a significant attractive factor and conversely cross-border activity and distance as impediments. Gong et al. (2018) follow with a study on China air cargo networks with an augmented gravity model utilising GDP, population and culture as D.W. Alexander and R. Merkert socioeconomic variables. The authors conclude with the statement \"Chinese airlines and logistics operators still play relatively minor roles in the global air cargo market\" which is interesting considering China-US air freight was worth over US$120 billion since 2012 (United States Census Bureau, 2019). Matsumoto and Domae (2018) utilise the gravity model formulation to assess how international air traffic flows have impacted the hub status of cities in East and SouthEast Asia between 1982 and 2012. They find that distance for selected cities, somewhat counterintuitively, had a positive impact to air cargo volumes. This may be due to the selection of air routes (short haul, medium haul and long haul); competition by other transport modes (sea, road or rail); and/or a result of incorrect evaluation of observed (or unobserved) factors that may occur within fixed effects modelling. Matsumoto and Domae (2019) use a similar gravity model formulation finding that generative factors of GDP and population had reduced after the year 2000, which may simply be a result of the changing components of GDP and why a more direct measure, such as consumer spending on goods (imports) and transportation services, should be considered for future air passenger and air cargo gravity models.",

Bhadra and Kee (2008) Forecasting can also lead to high volatility and significant errors, as Srindhi and Manrai (2014) developed an aggregated demand model for the international air passenger market in India, supplying a range of forecasts from 24 million to 93 million, from a base of 40 million. Xia and Yu (2015) utilise gravity models to assess the importance of Macau as a strategic gateway between China and Portuguese speaking countries based on 2012 air passenger flows. Using the 2013-14 growth rate of 37% as a static figure, from a low passenger base, the forecast projections of Xia and Yu (2015) became unrealistic to achieve. Kupfer et al. (2017) developed an error correcting model for forecasting air cargo demand, linking merchandise exports to air freight tonne-kilometres. This model was designed for medium term forecasting projections only, considering several scenarios, such as growth in merchandise trade and oil price, two scenarios of stagnation, moreover a combined scenario of stagnant oil price and merchandise trade was not considered (especially notable given the protectionist rhetoric of the Trump administration). All of the projections are straight line, and thus do not consider the impact of an economic event, such as the GFC.",

Shepherd (2013) confirms that the general approach for gravity modelling estimations is a log-linear formulation and use of the Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression technique, sometimes with fixed effects. Fixed effects typically segregate aspects of a region or location and have been applied in air transport research at the regional bloc level (Vega, 2014) , national level (Gadala-Maria, 2014), regional level (Gong et al., 2018) or city level Domae, 2018, 2019) . Cohen (2016) finds that the PPML estimation does not improve the quality of his forecast model over OLS and states that \"OLS is the preferred model\" when comparing results with Mean Average Percentage Error (MAPE). Moreover, in an industry that is measured globally in millions of tonnes (IATA, 2018a), billions of freight tonne-kilometres (World Bank, 2018b) and trillions of US dollars carried (ATAG, 2018), zero trade flows suggests that there simply is no market.

This includes a few years prior to the GFC (2005 GFC ( -2007 , the turbulent impacts of the events during the GFC (2008 GFC ( -2009 and the aftermath of the GFC from 2010. Based on research into causality between air transport and economic growth by Hakim and Merkert (2016) which indicates a 3-4 year time lag, the year 2005 was taken as a baseline year for this analysis into the impacts of the GFC on US international air freight imports. Imported commodities range from food products (meat, dairy, fruits and vegetables etc.) to general household items and high value luxuries. Air freight typically involves products that may be time-definitive (such as perishable commodities, objects with high obsolescence and/or sensitive items), security conscious (high value items) and/or of a light encumbrance (including weight and/or cubic dimensions) . Especially during economic crisis, products are more likely to be sourced from the cheapest producer, including foreign exchange rates and transport costs, rather than based on other consumer attributes (i.e. quality of produce). Competition between suppliers leads to market substitution either within a region (such as switching from Japanese and Korean electronics to Chinese), or between regions that provide homogenous goods. Product substitution involves switching between comparable products (i.e. consumption of meat products or acquisition of clothing attire). Some peripheral air freight markets are also susceptible to transport mode substitution.",

Notably, consumer spending in the US has continued to grow, despite the GFC impact of 2009, as has imported goods. Perhaps more importantly this research has shown that the developed gravity models are robust enough to handle and accurately account for substantial shocks such as the GFC. At the aggregate level, the value of air freight imports with the US appears to be reasonably forecastable utilising the gravity model approach. At a somewhat disaggregated level, the gravity model was also noticeably effective, although some improvements can be made to the forecasting methodological approach and refinement of data. Notably, whilst the model was developed to identify the economic impact of the GFC, the forecast models appear to have identified several more boom/bust periods for low and high value commodities in the air freight market.",

Beyond the scope of this paper was air cargo imports to European and North East Asian markets, notably the other two major economic regions of the world, and cross-elasticities of imported products (for example between meat and vegetables) to the US. It is further worth noting that at the time of receiving the proofs for our manuscript in April 2020, COVID-19 had a major impact on the air cargo industry both in the US and globally. We strongly believe that our hypothesis will hold for pandemics such as COVID-19 too, which would highlight the value of gravity models in forecasting during disruption and exogenous shocks to airline markets. Further research in this regard is needed once the data becomes available. Note: * significant at p < 0.1, ** significant at p < 0.05, *** significant at p < 0.01.
