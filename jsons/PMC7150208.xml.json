One result of this demographic shift was overcrowding in poor housing, served by inadequate or nonexistent public water supplies and waste-disposal systems. In London, the introduction of sewers and flushing toilets directly draining into the Thames led it to becoming an open stinking sewer, due to high tides and strong winds pushing seawater upstream. These conditions resulted in repeated outbreaks of water-borne diseases such as cholera, dysentery, tuberculosis, typhoid fever, influenza, yellow fever, and malaria, and other infectious diseases, as well as the loss of the fishing industry.",

The Indian subcontinent has been a long-term focus of cholera and the source of six worldwide epidemics between 1817 and 1923. The seventh cholera pandemic, which began in 1961, affects on an average 3\u20135 million people annually, with 120,000 deaths with large scale epidemics in Haiti, Yemen and in central Africa in the second decade of the 21st century.\n",

John saw unsanitary conditions in his hometown with a river contaminated by town sewage. As a medical apprentice from age 14, he experienced a cholera epidemic in a coal-mining village. Snow vowed to resist drink, gambling and marriage, and became a vegetarian. At age 23 he began medical studies and graduated from the University of London in 1844. John Snow, a physician now considered a founding father of modern epidemiology was the personal anesthetist to Queen Victoria and founding member of the London Epidemiological Society. In 1848, Snow was developing his anesthesia practice in the cholera afflicted district when he undertook an independent investigation of the epidemic.",

Finally, in 1864 with the plan of Sir Joseph Bazalgette, two enormous sewers were laid along the Thames, diverting the sewage downstream with development of sewage farms to manage the effluent. The system is still in use, but becoming too small to cope with the demands being placed on it as a result of increasing population and land development.",

He was struck by the observation that the cases either lived close to or were using the Broad Street pump for drinking water. He also determined that brewery workers and poorhouse residents in the area, both of whom relied on local wells, escaped the epidemic. Snow concluded that access to uncontaminated water prevented them from cholera infection, while users of the Broad Street pump became infected. He persuaded the doubtful civic authorities to remove the handle from the Broad Street pump, and the already subsiding epidemic disappeared within a few days.",

I found so little impurity in it of an organic nature \u2026 I requested \u2026 to take a list, at the General Registrar\u2019s Office, of the deaths of cholera, registered during the week ending 2nd September \u2026 Eighty-nine deaths from cholera were registered during the week, in the three sub-districts.\u201d\u201cI found that nearly all the deaths had taken place within a short distance of the pump \u2026 With regard to the deaths \u2026 there were sixty-one instances in which I was informed that the deceased persons used to drink the water from Broad Street, either constantly or occasionally\u2026\u201d\u201cThe Workhouse in Poland Street is more than three-quarters surrounded by houses in which deaths from cholera occurred, yet out of five hundred and thirty five inmates, only five died of cholera \u2026 The Workhouse has a pump-well on the premises, in addition to the supply from the Grand Junction Waterworks, and the inmates never sent to the Broad Street for water.
