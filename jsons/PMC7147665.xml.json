Development of clinical BRD frequently occurs via a primary infection with one or more respiratory viruses. The initial viral infection combined with a compromised immune system then allows for the rapid colonization of bacteria within the lungs (Hodgins et al., 2002). The BRD complex accounts for the majority of morbidity, mortality, decreased production, and economic losses in feedlots.",

Calves were purchased over the course of 1 wk in September at livestock auctions throughout Oklahoma and transported (average distance = 135 km) to the Willard Sparks Beef Research Center (WSBRC) at Oklahoma State University. Upon arrival at the feed yard, calves were individually weighed and a uniquely numbered ear tag was placed in the left ear of each calf. Calves were given ad libitum access to prairie hay and water, and allowed to rest 24 to 48 h before initial processing. Initial processing consisted of vaccination for infectious bovine rhinotracheitis virus, bovine viral diarrhea virus types 1 and 2, parainfluenza 3 virus, and bovine respiratory syncytial virus; vaccination for Clostridium chauvoei, Clostridium septicum, Clostridium novyi, Clostridium sordellii, and Clostridium perfringens types C and D; and treatment for the control of internal and external parasites (Ivomec Plus; Merial, Duluth, GA). Bulls (n = 355) were surgically castrated by incising the scrotum with a Newberry castrating knife followed by emasculation by a single individual, and calves with horns (n = 57) had their horns tipped with a Keystone dehorner.",

The remaining 48 steers never met antimicrobial treatment criteria for BRD, never received an antimicrobial, and thus were not allocated to the ANC receiving experiment. These untreated calves were fed, housed, and managed identically to those calves on the ANC receiving experiment. For this experiment, calves were grouped by previous experimental ANC and the number of times treated for BRD (BRDX) and then randomly allocated to finishing pens so that only a single ANC and BRDX were represented within a pen. This was done to allow for the analysis of interactions between BRDX and previous ANC experimental treatments. Calves selected for this experiment were representative of the initial experimental population and were subsampled from the experimental population based on BW.

The subjective criteria used for pulling calves consisted of depression, abnormal appetite, and respiratory signs and are described in greater detail by Wilson et al. (2015).

A clinically normal appearing calf was assigned a severity score of 0, whereas a 1 was assigned to a calf with mild clinical signs, a 2 would have been assigned to a calf with moderate clinical signs, a 3 was assigned to a calf with severe clinical signs, and 4 was assigned to a moribund calf. For a calf to be assigned a score of 4, the calf had to be unable to rise; require assistance to rise; or have extreme difficulty standing, walking, or breathing.

Any interactions that existed between BRDX and previous ANC are notated in Tables 3\n, 4\n, and 5\n. Only 3 significant interactions were observed for all of the variables analyzed. Orthogonal contrasts were then performed for the linear and quadratic effects of BRDX.

Data were analyzed with mortalities (4; 3 digestive and 1 BRD) included in the analysis (deads in). One calf from the 2X group and 3 calves from the 3/4X group died during the experiment. Because of circumstances beyond our control, the calves slaughtered at 197 DOF experienced a longer chill time at the packing facility before grading.

This carcass value represents the actual price paid for each individual calf at the time of slaughter. After carcass values were calculated for each BRDX group, the actual cost of antimicrobials used in the experiment was subtracted from each respective BRDX group. For 3/4X, the average costs of 3 and 4 antimicrobial treatments was used. Next additional labor and other expenses were accounted for at an assumed cost of $7.25 per antimicrobial administered. Yardage was then adjusted based on actual DOF for a pen and a yardage cost of $0.40/steer per d. Finally, feed cost was also adjusted based on actual DMI for a pen and a diet cost of $33.27 per 100 kg ($301.85 per ton) on a DM basis. These adjustments resulted in a total calf value (Table 7\n). Total calf value was determined as the carcass value adjusted for actual costs resulting from BRD treatment including the purchase price of antimicrobials, increased labor costs associated with treatment and care, adjustments in yardage costs based on variations in DOF, and adjustments in feed costs based on variations in DOF and DMI.",

Our target was to slaughter all pens when calves within that pen reached a 12th-rib fat thickness of 1.27 cm regardless of DOF. Because of the desired collection of carcass data and lung scores at slaughter combined with the distance to the slaughter facility from WSBRC, logistical concerns compelled us to slaughter calves in as few slaughter groups as possible while maintaining our goal to slaughter all calves at a common compositional endpoint. By using a combination of ultrasound estimates, BW projections, and visual appraisal, we were able to project an ideal individual slaughter date for each pen. After this was accomplished, pens were fairly easily separated into early and late slaughter groups by their individual predicted slaughter dates and all pens were able to be slaughtered in 2 groups (DOF = 166 or 197). By allowing DOF to fluctuate, all BRDX groups were slaughtered between 1.28 and 1.40 cm of 12th-rib fat.",

As a result, there was a linear decrease (P < 0.001) in d-0 BW (64-kg difference between 0X and 3/4X) at the start of the finishing phase. Similarly, Holland et al. (2010) observed a linear decrease in BW as BRDX increased at the start of the finishing phase, resulting from a linear decrease in ADG during the receiving period. This linear decrease in BW during the receiving period associated with increasing BRDX is also supported by data from other experiments (Gardner et al., 1999; Thompson et al., 2006; Schneider et al., 2009; Thomson et al., 2012).",

However, when contrasting 3X heifers with chronically ill heifers, there was a significant decrease in final BW for chronically ill heifers (Holland et al., 2010). The differing results observed in the final BW of these 2 experiments could simply be the result of how the BRDX groups were structured for those calves receiving 3 or more antimicrobial treatments that suffered from an extreme BRD challenge.

This retrospective approach has also been conducted using the presence of lung lesions or lung scores at slaughter (Gardner et al., 1999; Thompson et al., 2006; Schneider et al., 2009). Finally, other experiments have simply evaluated the performance of a single pen or lot of cattle with high incidence of BRD (Thomson et al., 2012). These experiments can provide good evidence of performance of treated cattle on a large commercial scale. However, none of these methods are ideal, because they either cannot account for DMI and efficiency measures, or they simply lump nontreated and cattle receiving differing numbers of BRD treatments within a pen or lot together to determine intake and efficiency of the pen or lot.",

It is likely that much of the decrease in prefinishing ADG observed in the current experiment by calves that required antimicrobial treatment for BRD could be the result of altered feeding behavior and decreased DMI by these calves.

This result was in contrast to the efficiency data reported by Holland et al. (2010), who noted a linear increase in overall G:F with increasing BRDX.",

There was a numerical increase in 12th-rib fat thickness for 2X and 3/4X calves compared with 0X. Based on the measure of 12th-rib fat thickness as well as overall carcass fat evidenced through KPH percentage and USDA YG, we were successful at slaughtering all steers at the same compositional endpoint. Only a 0.12-cm difference in the average 12th-rib fat thickness was observed between steers across BRDX treatment groups. Cattle in the 3/4X group were finished to the greatest numerical fat thickness, and there was a numerical increase in 12th-rib fat thickness observed for both 2X and 3/4X calves compared with 0X. We wanted to ensure that 2X and 3/4X calves had every opportunity to reach the same quality and yield grades as the 0X calves. By ensuring that calves treated multiple times for BRD had slightly greater fat thickness, we were confident that these calves were given ample time to reach their quality and yield potential.

Currently, there is no perfect diagnostic tool to determine the incidence of BRD in feedlot cattle, and thus, determining the true production and economic losses due to BRD is extremely difficult. However, we would agree with the assessment of Holland et al.

However, decreases in BW and DP as BRDX increased resulted in larger differences in total carcass value as BRDX increased. Calves never treated for BRD had an average carcass value of $1,643.80, whereas 1X, 2X, and 3/4X groups returned $1,612.67, $1,589.01, and $1,540.46, respectively, resulting in a linear decrease (P = 0.001) in total carcass value. When total calf value was calculated by adjusting for the cost of antimicrobials, increased labor, and variation in yardage and feed consumption due to differences in DOF, the differences in value among BRDX groups became more magnified. The total calf value for 0X remained the same, whereas 1X, 2X, and 3/4X groups had total calf values of $1,605.93, $1,476.91, and $1,413.35, respectively (linear P < 0.0001).

However, these calves will likely never achieve equivalent carcass yields, USDA QG, and, consequently, carcass value as calves never treated for BRD. Therefore, the economic losses of calves requiring multiple BRD treatments can be ameliorated with additional DOF, but not eliminated.
