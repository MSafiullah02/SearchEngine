This line listing contained 1,291 cases of MERS-CoV infection pulled from a number of sources, including the World Health Organization and the government of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. This data set has often been more up-to-date than official World Health Organization case reports, especially early in the epidemic. The outcomes available are as reported and do not necessarily reflect the final status of the patient after prolonged follow-up, so some misclassification of outcomes is possible. The majority of MERS-CoV cases occurred in Saudi Arabia, South Korea, and the United Arab Emirates (Appendix Table 1). The outbreak in South Korea was excluded from the analysis because of its unique nature, resulting in 1,105 cases after exclusion.",

One hundred imputations were used, based on the assumption that all data for the variables included in the analysis, missing or observed, came from a multivariate normal distribution. A ridge prior of 1% of the empirical data was used to assist with the numerical stability of the algorithm. The ridge prior in essence adds an additional number of observations equal to 1% of the data set with the same mean and variance as the observed data, but with no covariance. This shrinks the covariance between the variables in the imputation model and assists the algorithm in converging on a stable solution, which is sometimes necessary with high degrees of missingness, as in this case. Priors using 0.5% of the data or 2% of the data did not result in meaningful differences in the results (not shown).",

Employment as a health-care worker and an increased amount of time between disease onset and hospitalization had minor protective associations with reported mortality. Older age and underlying comorbidity were associated with increased risks of mortality, while female patients and cases with a later time of infection onset (in days since January 1, 2012) had lower risks of mortality.

A dearth of openly shared data impedes research efforts, such as the construction of mathematical models or broader-scale risk assessments. We have attempted to address this for MERS-CoV, using a regularly updated, publicly available data set. The use of multivariate models with allowance for extensively missing data has allowed the identification of some previously suggested risk factors that do not appear to be so upon adjustment for other covariates. For example, female patients were not necessarily at lower risk for disease after adjustment, nor were primary cases at higher risk for fatal infections. Issues of data quality and \u201cmissingness\u201d during outbreaks necessitate the use of robust techniques for handling missing data.",

While not a surprising finding, this does suggest that older and sicker patients merit heightened vigilance. Additionally, cases arising progressively later during the epidemic have been associated with lower risks of both death and severe disease at the time of initial reporting, suggesting that treatment methods for MERS-CoV may be increasing in efficacy. Alternately, the proportion of mild and asymptomatic cases has been rising over time, suggesting that less severe cases are becoming more likely to be ascertained as a result of epidemiologic investigation. This is supported by temporal trends in the missingness of the data, which grows less severe later in the epidemic.",
