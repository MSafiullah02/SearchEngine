In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19, the disease-associated to the novel coronavirus named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) outbreak, a pandemic. A significant amount of COVID-19 patients is currently experiencing severe interstitial pneumonia possibly ending up with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). This severe form of COVID-19 shares several clinical and laboratory features with the four entities mentioned above and currently included in the definition of \"hyperferritinemic syndromes\" [2] . This concept may guide and support therapeutic choices as all these entities respond to a similar approach consisting of antiinflammatory and immunomodulatory agents such as glucocorticoids, IVIg, cyclosporin, IL-1 and IL-6 inhibition [1, 2] . Plasmapheresis or IL-18 blockade may be considered as well [1, 3] . Some preliminary results confirm the beneficial effects of Tocilizumab in COVID-19 [4] and current recommendations [5] advocate its use in those patients evolving toward the most severe stage of illness characterized by an extra-pulmonary systemic hyper-inflammation [6] .",

            "text": "Hyperferritinemia is the hallmark of the \"hyperferritinemic syndromes\" and along the last decade, increasing evidence supports the idea that high circulating ferritin may not only reflect an acute phase response but also play a critical role in inflammation [12] . Ferritin is a major intracellular iron storage protein and the ratio between its two subunits, H and L, may differ depending on tissue type and physiologic status of the cell [13] . H-ferritin seems to display not only an immunomodulatory function [14, 15] but also a pro-inflammatory activity culminating with the induction of the expression of different inflammatory mediators, including IL-1\u03b2 [16] . Hyperferritinaemia characterizes several autoimmune diseases [17] where it may play a pathogenetic role on the ground of its immunomodulatory properties [12] . The origin of circulating serum ferritin during inflammatory conditions is still debated. In vitro experiments demonstrated that ferritin might be actively secreted by hepatocytes [18] as well as by macrophages through a non-classical pathway [19] . Thus, it is likely that in \"hyperferritinemic syndromes\" macrophage activation could actively contribute to ferritin production. In line with this hypothesis, in a previous study, we demonstrated that in AOSD ferritin serum levels are not only correlated with disease activity, but also with macrophage activation [20] . Interestingly, in a very recent study describing a cohort of 39 hospitalized patients with COVID-19, ferritin serum levels were found significantly correlated with is related to changes in the morphology of red blood cells and fibrin induced by \"free iron\" able itself to favor the production of hydroxyl radical [22] . Oxidative stress on red blood cells and fibrin can induce the production of dense clots responsible for stroke development [23] . Due to the capacity of iron chelation to taper the inflammatory response through a reduction of ROS production and to promote an anti -viral activity, the utility of this therapeutic approach in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection has been recently addressed [24] . A clinical trial on the use of Desferal (Deferoxamine, a medication able to bind iron in case of \"iron overdose\") is currently ongoing in IRAN in patients with mild to severe COVID-19 infection",

Macroscopic features in autopsies include pleurisy, pericarditis, lung consolidation, pulmonary edema [34] ; microscopic findings include diffuse alveolar damage with inflammatory infiltrates composed mainly by monocytes and macrophages, but minimal lymphocytes infiltration, and multinucleated giant cells alongside large atypical pneumocytes [11, 35] . Cardiac involvement in the form of myocarditis has been also described [36] . Similarly, pleurisy, pericarditis and myocarditis have been largely described in patients with AOSD and MAS [37, 38] . Some recommendations and guidelines to safely perform an autopsy have been published [39] but the literature on this aspect is still poor even if pathological aspects are of utmost importance to better understand the extent and type of damage associated with COVID-19 and its possible pathogenesis.",

            "text": "Besides genetic factors, the modulation of the expression of different cytokines both by lung epithelial cells and by innate and adaptive immune cells needs to be taken into account. Regarding IL-1\u03b2, it is important to remind that previous studies on SARS-CoV demonstrated the ability of the virus to up-regulate inflammasome activity with consequent capacity to actively increase the production of IL-1\u03b2 [51] . Due to the similarities between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 (82% nucleotide sequence homology), it is likely that J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Journal Pre-proof SARS-CoV-2 displays the same capacity to induce an exaggerated IL-1\u03b2 mediated response. Thus, the link between COVID-19 induced inflammatory reaction and hyperferritinemic syndromes, such as AOSD or MAS, is immediately evident being both related to a massive IL-1\u03b2 systemic release. During MAS, it is also important to remind the role of type II interferon (IFN), which is a crucial mediator of the inflammatory response and whose neutralization looks promising in this condition [52] . In this regard, although it is known that type I IFN represents the main anti-viral pathway, studies on SARS-CoV revealed that both type I and type II IFN (alpha-beta and gamma) synergize to inhibit virus replication with a concomitant active virus attempt to reduce such IFN production [53] . Preliminary data from COVID-19 patients suggest how a suppressed IFN\u03b3 production by CD4+ T cells is associated with more severe disease [54] . Nonetheless, in the advanced stages of the disease, an over-expression of this molecule may occur, due to a second \"wave\" of systemic inflammatory reaction similar to MAS. For this reason, a clinical trial evaluating the efficacy of concomitant inhibition of IL-1 (Anakinra) and IFN\u03b3 (emapalumab) in severe COVID-19 patients has just started (NCT04324021). However, in patients with COVID-19, a clear distinction between ARDS and MAS is challenging, especially in the first phases of the disease where ARDS represents the main source of IL-6 and L-1 [33] . Results from Anakinra/Emapalumab trial will surely provide interesting insights on this COVID-19 associated \"MAS like-syndrome\".",

At the moment, the Italian Society of Rheumatology has organized a national registry to gather information regarding patients with immune-rheumatologic disease infected by SARS-CoV-2 and the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) has proposed a similar registry too. Very preliminary results on a large cohort of Italian patients with chronic arthritis treated with immunosuppressive agents (biologic and targeted synthetic DMARDs), showed no increased risk of respiratory or life -threatening complication from SARS-CoV-2 infection. Despite the limited follow-up and the small number of cases that do not allow to draw any conclusion, the results could suggest a possible benefit of immune suppression in these patients, possibly preventing the onset of uncontrolled systemic inflammation [61] .
