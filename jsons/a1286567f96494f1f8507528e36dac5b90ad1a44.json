He is admitted to the intensive care unit with sepsis due to pyelonephritis. In addition to broad-spectrum antibiotics, the patient has received one liter of fl uid resuscitation with 0.9 % saline. Two hours after presentation, the blood pressure is currently 73/42 mmHg. Temperature is 36.8 \u00b0C (98.2 \u00b0F), pulse rate is 120 beats/minute, and respiratory rate is 24 breaths/minute. Hematocrit is 29 %, blood sugar is 257 mg/dL, and serum lactate is 3.0 mg/dL. Which of the following is the most likely to improve mortality in this particular patient? A) Continued fl uid resuscitation with colloid added B) Intensive insulin therapy to maintain euglycemia C) Vasopressor therapy D) Bicarbonate infusion E) Transfusion with PRBC Answer: C This patient has not responded to aggressive fl uid resuscitation per sepsis guidelines. At this point within 6 h of attempted fl uid resuscitation, vasopressor therapy is indicated and has been shown to improve mortality. Intensive insulin therapy and fl uid resuscitation with colloid have been recommended for critical illnesses in the past. However, recent trials have failed to show a defi nitive benefi t of these therapies in severe sepsis. Intensive insulin therapy increases risk of hypoglycemia and has not been shown to improve mortality in an acute setting of sepsis.",

There is no evidence that home TPN prolongs life or improves quality of life in these patients. Home TPN is expensive and is indicated in select circumstances. Patients with short bowel resulting from the treatment of Crohn's disease or pseudo-obstruction have a good response to home TPN. In these patients, TPN increases quality-adjusted years of life patients and is cost-effective. There is little evidence to support the use of home TPN, in most chronic diseases resulting in malnutrition. 370.

A) Initiation of a milrinone infusion B) Angiography for possi(ble percutaneous intervention C) Insertion of an intra-aortic balloon pump D) Deactivation of the AICD E) AICD recalibration Answer: D This patient has multiple indicators for the defi nition of advanced chronic heart failure, including symptom-based high New York Heart Association (NYHA) classifi cation, severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and left ventricular ejection fraction below 30 %. Palliative care is appropriate and should be offered. The most reasonable intervention at this time is deactivation of the automatic implantable cardioverter defi brillator (AICD). Failure to deactivate the AICD leaves many patients vulnerable to inappropriate device discharge, unnecessary discomfort, and intense anxiety. Other measures, such as infusion of positive inotropes, are used on a temporary basis with a plan for more defi nitive therapies. The use of intermittent infusions to control symptoms is not recommended by the AHA/ACC guidelines unless the patient is awaiting defi nitive therapy, such as transplantation. 371. A 64-year-old man has been admitted for a large subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) from a ruptured cerebral aneurysm. He has no spontaneous movement for the past week. He remains intubated. There is concern that the patient has brain death. What test is most commonly used to diagnose brain death in this situation? A) Cerebral angiography B) Apnea testing C) Demonstration of absent cranial nerve refl exes D) Demonstration of fi xed and dilated pupils E) Performance of transcranial Doppler ultrasonography Answer: B Brain death is defi ned as lack of cerebral function with continued cardiac activity. This state requires support by artificial means. If an individual is determined to have brain death, life-sustaining therapies may be withdrawn. This can occur without the consent of the family. It is important to have ongoing communication with the family to allow the withdrawal of care without confl ict. Most hospitals have developed specifi c protocols in line with state law to diagnose a patient with brain death.",

It is important to know the advantages and disadvantages of each. This patient is on hemodialysis, which limits his medication options for DVT treatment. Rivaroxaban should be avoided once the CrCl <30 mL/min. Dabigatran was not studied in HD patients or in patients with a CrCl <30 mL/min. These populations were excluded from the DVT/PE trials.

Answer: A The most common adverse event in the hospitalized patient is an adverse drug event (ADE). This occurs in approximately 19 % of hospitalizations. An adverse event is defi ned as an injury caused by medical management rather than the underlying disease of the patient. In recent years, there has been increasing focus on the safety of health care provided throughout the world. An Institute of Medicine report identifi ed safety as an essential component of quality in health care. One of the largest studies that has attempted to quantify adverse events in hospitalized patients was the Harvard Medical Practice Study.

Several prominent cases of reporting or publication bias have been described in the literature. These have included trials reporting the effectiveness of antidepressants, class I anti-arrhythmic drugs, and selective COX-2 inhibitors. Studies in which drugs are shown to be ineffective are often not published, delayed, or modifi ed to emphasize the positive results suggested.",

In general, published evidence tends to overestimate effi cacy and underestimate safety risks. The extent of this is often unknown. PICCs are a reliable alternative to short-term central venous catheters, with a lower risk of complications. PICCs have higher patient satisfaction and lower infection rates and are more cost-effective than other CVCs. However, PICCs are associated with a higher risk of deep vein thrombosis than are central venous catheters (CVCs). This risk is increased in patients who are critically ill or those with a malignancy. Also, to meet the defi nition of a PICC, the distal tip of the catheter must terminate in the superior vena cava, the inferior vena cava, or the proximal right atrium. Thrombosis may be a result of PICCs being inserted into peripheral veins that are narrower and more likely to occlude in the presence of a catheter than the large veins used for CVCs. Reducing readmission rates is a major priority for hospitals given that the Affordable Care Act (ACA) established a Hospital Readmissions Reduction Program that requires the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) to reduce payments to hospitals with excessive readmissions.",

Volume resuscitation should be initiated with rapid IV infusion of isotonic saline or Ringer's lactate. After assessing for an adequate airway and spontaneous breathing, initial resuscitation aims at reexpanding the intravascular volume and controlling ongoing losses. Transfusion with packed red blood cells (PRBC) should be considered with hemorrhagic shock, continued blood losses, and a hemoglobin of less than 10 g/dL Symptoms of hemorrhagic and nonhemorrhagic shock are indistinguishable. Up to 20 % of the blood volume can be lost with few clinical symptoms except mild tachycardia. Orthostasis is seen with a loss of 20-40 % of the blood volume. Shock occurs with loss of more than 40 % of the blood volume. This results in marked tachycardia, hypotension, oliguria, and fi nally obtundation.

Diuretics may increase urine output and sodium excretion but are ineffective and even detrimental in the prevention and treatment of AKI. They neither shorten the duration of AKI nor reduce the need for renal replacement therapy. Answer: A A variety of drugs can cause drug-induced hemolysis. Of the drugs listed, piperacillin/tazobactam has the highest risk, followed by metformin. In the 30-year experience of a reference laboratory, cefotetan, ceftriaxone, and piperacillin were responsible for 76 % of all cases of DIHA, with cefotetan accounting for the majority of cases. 433.

It is recommended that it be administered early in the course and continued for 5-7 days. A target hematocrit of 30 % risks increasing portal pressure. Excessive fresh frozen plasma administration increases portal pressure and the risk for transfusion-associated lung injury.

It was signifi cantly higher in the subgroup of patients with cirrhosis and Child-Pugh class A, B, or C disease., possibly due to an increase in portal pressures seen in that group.

Answer: A Lower gastrointestinal bleeding (LGIB) is a frequent cause of hospital admission and is a factor in hospital morbidity and mortality. The most common etiologies for LGIB are diverticulosis (33.5 %), hemorrhoids (22.5 %), and carcinoma (12.7 %) Diverticulosis is the dominant etiology for massive LGIB in most publications. Most diverticular bleeding occurs without concomitant diverticulitis. Risk factors for diverticular bleeding include lack of dietary fi ber, constipation, advanced age, and use of nonsteroidal anti-infl ammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and aspirin. In about 10 % of patients presenting with LGIB, the source of bleeding is from the upper gastrointestinal (GI) tract. 459. Which of the following scenarios is it appropriate to allow outpatient treatment for community-acquired pneumonia (CAP)? A) 65-year-old male with CAP and confusion B) 66-year-old male with CAP and respiratory rate of 18/min C) 72-year-old female with CAP and creatinine of 2.2 mg/dL D) 45-year-old female with CAP, low blood pressure, and some confusion E) 28-year-old female with CAP, altered mental status, respiratory rate 35/min, and blood pressure of 90/50 mmHg Answer: B Some cases of CAP can be safely treated as an outpatient. CURB-65 guidelines have been developed to assist in appropriate level of care in treating CAP. The CURB-65 acronym stands for C, confusion; U, uremia; R, respiratory rate greater than 30/min; B, blood pressure that is low, less than 90 mmHg systolic or less than 60 mmHg diastolic; and 65, age 65 years or greater. Each category is assigned 1 point; 0-1 point total means the patient can be treated as an outpatient, 2 points total requires treatment in the medical ward, and 3 or more points total requires ICU admission The 66-year-old male with CAP and respiratory rate of 18/ min can be treated as an outpatient. This patient only has one point, age greater than 65 years of age. The CURB score simply serves a guideline.

Although Cochrane reviews are done with much diligence, some reviews have come under scrutiny for their overreaching conclusions. Answer: A Several studies have shown that fragmented care causes an increase in length of stay (LOS). One study published in the 2010 Journal of Hospital Medicine revealed that a 10 % increase in fragmentation was associated with an increase of 0.39 days for pneumonia and an increase of 0.30 days in LOS for heart failure. Fragmentation was defi ned as the percentage the patient was seen by physicians other than the physician providing the majority of care. Protocol-driven admission processes can make it easy to overlook the fundamental right of patient autonomy. Goals of care in this situation should be determined before any signifi cant effort is undertaken. Answer: C Obesity increases the risk of a falsely low B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) level. BNP is especially helpful in differentiating dyspnea as a result of heart failure versus dyspnea as a result of pulmonary disease. BNP has a good negative predictive value. Among patients presenting to the emergency department with dyspnea of undetermined cause, a BNP level of less than 100 pg/mL accurately excludes decompensated heart failure as a cause.",

The Clots in Legs Or Stockings after Stroke (CLOTS 3) trial studied the effi cacy and adverse effects of IPC devices in a stroke population At 30 days, patients receiving IPCs had a signifi cant reduction in any DVT compared to those who had none. This protective effect was persistent through 6 months. The effect was similar whether anticoagulants were used or not. There was also benefi t to IPCs whether the stroke was hemorrhagic or not. Falls which may be increased with devices that limit movement were not different between the groups.

A) Increased use of sedation B) Increased patient safety C) Decreased days of intensive care D) Decreased incidence of adverse events Answer: A It is important to recognize potential negative physical and psychological consequences of restraints. The use of physical restraints is often necessary for the protection of staff and of patients and should be continued to be used judiciously. Attacks on nurses can be sudden, serious, and life threatening. The trend in health-care literature is that violence against nurses appears to be a growing problem globally. Physical restraints placed have been shown to require higher doses of benzodiazepines, opioids, and antipsychotic medications. Patients have prolonged length of stay in the intensive care unit (ICU). Patients have higher rates of selfextubation and accidental removal of intravenous catheters, urinary catheters, and feeding tubes. After discharge, elderly patients who have undergone physical restraint have higher levels of post-traumatic stress disorder. All of these factors make physical restraints one of the least preferred options. Which of the following additional information is true concerning an IO cannula?

Five controlled trials have evaluated the effi cacy of metoclopramide in the treatment of diabetic gastroparesis. Benefi ts have been limited. Metoclopramide has been demonstrated to be effective for the short-term treatment of gastroparesis for up to several weeks, but long-term effi cacy has not been proven. In one study, no consistent benefi t was observed from the use of metoclopramide for more than 1 month. Survival in diabetics with gastroparesis is not impacted by metoclopramide use. While symptoms of bradygastria are improved, diabetics may also have tachygastric symptoms which would be worsened, not improved with metoclopramide. National guidelines estimate the risk of developing tardive dyskinesia (TD) from metoclopramide to be 1-15 %. Chronic use of metoclopramide appears to increase the risk of developing TD. Prior to initiating treatment with metoclopramide, it may be reasonable to obtain informed consent with the physician, patient, and family members. This should also be documented in the medical chart for medicolegal reasons.",

A) Polyethylene glycol B) Loperamide C) Both A and B D) Cholestyramine Answer: C Polyethylene glycol is an osmotic agent that would increase bowel movements. Loperamide acts on opioid intestinal muscle receptors to inhibit peristalsis and prolong transit time in the GI tract. Neither would be appropriate in an acute Clostridium diffi cile infection. Loperamide would potentially inhibit the excretion of toxins, leading to toxic megacolon. On the other hand, polyethylene glycol would cause more cramping and discomfort for the patient who is already experiencing frequency in bowel movements.",

Approximately what percent of empirical antimicrobial regimens remain unchanged after 5 days of hospitalization? A) 25 % B) 45 % C) 65 % D) 85 % E) 3 % Answer: C Broad-spectrum empirical therapy is common, and in many cases it is protocol driven. This is benefi cial in many instances, and certainly many antibiotic guidelines have improved mortality. However, there is often a reluctance to deescalate a regimen that has been working even when clinical signs of infection are no longer present. Deescalation of antibiotics when indicated is associated with a lower mortality. At 48-72 h, it is suggested to review microbiologic data, and if the patient is improving, deescalate from broad-spectrum antibiotics to a more narrow spectrum. Procalcitonin levels are also being utilized to guide therapy. Many health-care systems are developing antibiotic stewardship programs to address these issues.",

Regular statin use may be signifi cantly associated with favorable outcomes during admission for community-acquiredpneumonia. In addition, statins may have benefi cial effects on the clinical course of several infectious diseases, including bacterial sepsis in animals and humans.
