Methods: From January 2014 to December 2018, 712 consecutive patients were enrolled in the study. These patients were divided into two groups according to whether or not needed postoperative CRRT: the CRRT group vs the control group. Univariate analysis and binary logistic regression analysis were used to analyze the risk factors of CRRT. To avoid the selection bias and confounders, baseline characteristics were matched for propensity scores.

All were higher in the CRRT group (P < 0.05). These risk factors were included in binary logistic regression. It showed that preoperative sCr and CPB time were independent risk factors for CRRT patients undergoing surgery for TA-AAD. And there were significant differences regarding 30-day mortality (P < 0.001) and long-term overall cumulative survival (P < 0.001) with up to a 6-year follow-up. After propensity scoring, 29 pairs (58 patients) were successfully matched. Among these patients, the analysis showed that CPB time was still significantly longer in the CRRT group (P = 0.004), and the 30-day mortality rate was also higher in this group (44.8% vs 10.3%; P = 0.003).",

The internal jugular vein or femoral vein or subclavian vein was selected to place a single doublechamber blood filter catheter. The hemodynamic force is provided by the blood pump. 1000 ml heparin brine was pre-flushed before using the filter to empty the air bubbles in the filter and pipeline. We then placed the sterile collecting bag 30-50 cm below the filter, and recorded the flow of liquid in and out every hour. In the early postoperative patients after aortic dissection, local anticoagulation of prefilter citrate was used to reduce bleeding. The replacement solution was 0.9% normal saline and 5% glucose solution, with a ratio of 3:1. Additionally, 250 ml 5% sodium bicarbonate was added for q4h or q6h to timely supplement the physiological needs and nutrients lost by blood filtration. The input method is pre or post-dilution method, which can balance the fluid and adjust the infusion speed according to the amount of filtrate and input. The filter is usually replaced after a blockage or when the filtrate drops, and the continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH) blood flow should be 100-150 ml/min.

Patients were censored at the cut-off of the study AAD under the DHCA procedure, preoperative sCr and CPB time are independent risk factors for postoperative CRRT. To balance the selection bias and other confounders, baseline characteristics were matched for propensity scores. After matched, CPB time and 30-day mortality still showed significant differences between the two groups. Our Kaplan-Meier plots also revealed that the mortality of postoperative dialysis patients was significantly higher than that of the control group. Consistent to our findings, Rice, R.D et al. [7] confirmed that the proportion of CRRT for such patients was 18.2%. In another study conducted by Estrera et al., 347 patients with typical type A aortic dissection were analyzed, 64 cases of which suffered from CRRT (18.4%) [6] . The incidence of postoperative CRRT in our cohort was comparable with these previous studies. CRRT procedure involved in the context of renal failure may lead to circulation instability, infection, thrombosis, and electrolyte imbalance, which will impair the postoperative recovery of patients, and even cause death [11] , implying a low survival rate of the CRRT group as shown in our study. Elahi et al. suggested that early initiation of CRRT may reduce mortality and mortality in patients with severe AKI after cardiac surgery [12] .",

Preoperative creatinine serum levels showed a significant influence on postoperative renal function. Elevated sCr levels represented damaged renal function. It is believed that increased (> 50%) sCr resulted from hypotension, nephrotoxins and inflammation may lead to renal function injury [15] . Hypotension may result from cardiac tamponade or dehydration in TA-AAD patients. Reduction of renal blood flow, whether generalized or localized, plays a critical role in the occurrence of AKI [16] . Nephrotoxins include drugs and contrasts, which directly make damage to the kidney. Inflammatory response plays a major role in the development of acute aortic dissection and may also contribute to the vascular and renal parenchyma stress response, leading to the occurrence of AKI. Therapeutic strategies aimed at reducing kidney damage and accelerating function recovery contain nonpharmacologic, pharmacologic, and dialytic approaches [17] . Therefore, any therapy that can treat hypotension, nephrotoxins and inflammation regarding the increase of sCr may be helpful to improve the outcome, such as fluid, colloid administration for hemodynamic optimization. We'd better pay more attention when dealing with such cases because we confirmed the relationship between elevated preoperative sCr level and postoperative CRRT in our study.",

Renal hypotension and hypoperfusion during CPB may be the main causes [18] . With longer duration of CPB, more severe hypotensive periods may occur frequently. This entails prolonged period in which the mean arterial pressure is below the optimal renal autoregulation threshold [19] , which may aggravate the inflammatory response and induce ischemic kidney damage [20] . Besides, circulation is stopped during aortic dissection surgery, and ischemia-reperfusion injury may occur during the operation, ischemia-reperfusion injury may lead to massive apoptosis of renal endothelial cells [21] . In addition, CPB procedure causes damage to red blood cells, and the resulting cell debris forms tiny emboli that block the renal tubular vascular network, resulting in a decrease in the filtration area of renal tubules [22, 23] . The released hemoglobin also acts as an endogenous toxin through the release of iron, especially in the presence of low ferritin level [24] . Whether patients recover without sequela or develop AKI by progressing into the \"extension phase\" of kidney injury largely depends on the severity of the ensuing inflammatory response, renal hypoxia, and oxidative stress [25] . All these factors become more important if CPB is prolonged. In patients at high risk of postoperative CRRT, reduced CPB duration should be considered in perioperative care.",

            "text": "In conclusion, patients receiving CRRT treatment who underwent emergency surgery for TA-AAD had higher rates of perioperative mortality and postoperative morbidity. The preoperative serum creatinine and CPB time were independent risk factors for postoperative CRRT. Further prospective multicenter studies are needed to assess the prognostic significance of CRRT and establish the most effective strategies to prevent and treat postoperative CRRT and thereby improve patient outcomes.
