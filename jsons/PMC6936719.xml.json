As typically observed in temperate regions, the proportion of patients with respiratory illness testing positive to at least one respiratory virus peaked during winter, with the exception of the influenza A H1N1 pandemic in the summer of 2009 (Fig. 1A). Nevertheless, even during the influenza pandemic, the overall viral infection prevalence among patients remained broadly stable due to a simultaneous decline in the contribution of noninfluenza viruses to the total infection burden (Fig. 1B). Throughout the 9-y study period, because of seasonal fluctuations in the magnitude and timing of peaks in prevalences of individual viruses (Fig. 2), the dominating virus varied on a month-by-month basis (Fig. 1B).",

The estimated cross-correlations fall outside the 2.5% and 97.5% quantile intervals of correlation distributions generated under the null hypothesis of no interaction (see SI Appendix, Tables S1 and S2 and Methods for details). However, examining whether these are genuine virus\u2013virus interactions (mediated at either the host or population level) required us to address several methodological limitations in this relatively simple approach: It fails to account for autocorrelation in the time series of individual viruses, or for potentially confounding factors which might independently explain correlations, and it can produce spurious negative correlations with proportional data or, alternatively, spurious positive correlations with absolute infection counts.",

This framework estimates pairwise correlations by modeling observed monthly virus counts relative to what would be expected in each month. Patient covariates age, gender, and general practice versus hospital origin (as a proxy for illness severity) were used to estimate expected counts within each month for each virus independently, capturing age and typical seasonal variability in infection risk. For example, viral exposure events may be seasonally (anti-) correlated due to similarities (differences) in the climatic preferences of viruses (25, 26), and, in some cases, due to age-dependent contact patterns driven by extensive mixing of children in daycare centers and schools (27, 28). The remaining unexplained variation includes temporal autocorrelations and dependencies between viruses. Modeling temporal autocorrelation through a hierarchical autoregressive model (32), we were able to directly estimate the between-virus correlation matrix adjusted for other key alternative drivers of infection.",

This negative interaction may be driven by virus competition for susceptible cells, for example as a consequence of influenza-induced destruction of cell-surface receptors (35) and/or cell death (36), or as a consequence of virus-induced innate immune responses, such as the secretion of interferon (IFN), which can cause noninfected neighboring cells to adopt a protective antiviral state (23, 24). Such biological mechanisms would render the host resistant, or only partially susceptible, to subsequent viral infection. This prompted us to ask whether a short-lived, host-scale phenomenon could explain the prominent declines in the prevalence of RV among the patient population during peak influenza activity (Fig. 2A).",

Our simulations show that a temporary reduction in host susceptibility to a secondary common cold-like virus infection, a \u201crefractory period,\u201d caused by a primary influenza-like virus infection is sufficient to produce an observable epidemiological impact. For example, a refractory period of just 2 d caused a 23% decrease in common cold-like virus incidence during peak influenza-like virus activity, while a refractory period of 7 d generated as much as a 61% decrease in common cold-like virus incidence (Fig. 5A). Notably, these simulations produced asynchronous temporal patterns of infection qualitatively similar to our empirical observations, such that the periodic decline in common cold-like virus infections coincides with peak influenza-like virus activity (Fig. 5B).",

This finding supports the potential role of innate immunity, such as through the antiviral action of IFN, as early discussions on virus\u2013virus interactions had postulated (25, 41). Capturing this potentially immune-mediated interference in mathematical simulations representing the cocirculation of a seasonal influenza-like virus and a ubiquitous common cold-like virus, we demonstrated that a short-lived protective effect, such as that induced by IFN (25), is sufficient to induce the observed asynchronous seasonal patterns we observe for IAV and RV (Fig. 2A). Many factors could contribute to interferences observed at the population scale through the removal of susceptible hosts (1, 38). Such effects will likely act on a timescale (on the order of days to weeks) that is similar to our proposed biological mechanism and might therefore act alternatively or in tandem to generate epidemiological interactions.",

In the absence of a seasonal driver or a host-scale mechanism, it is possible that the lack of cooccurrence of IBV and AdV is explained by other ecological drivers. For example, convalescence or hospitalization induced by one virus may reduce the susceptible pool at risk of exposure to other viruses, as previously discussed by others in the context of childhood diseases (1, 38).",

These viruses are genetically and antigenically different; although studies have identified cross-reactive B cell and T cell epitopes in conserved regions of the viral genome (48), sufficient natural cross-protection has not been demonstrated (48, 49). It is, however, possible that their ecological relationship depends on the particular strains cocirculating. Further work is needed to better understand how the existence and nature of virus\u2013virus interactions varies at the level of virus strains. On the other hand, some evidence exists in support of immune-driven interference between H1N1 and H3N2 subtypes of influenza A (46, 47).

Although an interference between RSV and IAV has been proposed (9, 11, 48), a hypothesis recently supported in an experimental ferret model (21), this was not supported by our data. It is possible that such an effect was masked because our analysis did not enable stratification of effects by age, a step that is anticipated to severely limit the statistical power of our highly comprehensive analysis of virus\u2013virus interactions.

Plausible mechanisms of positive virus\u2013virus interactions include enhanced viral growth through syncytia formation of a coinfecting virus (22), the virus-mediated down-regulation of IFN, which may promote invasion by opportunistic viruses (41), and the virus-induced release of cytokines such as interleukin 10, which prevents the detrimental effects of dysregulated immune responses and might lead to immunosuppression and enhanced susceptibility to secondary viral infections (53, 54). That most interactions detected at the host scale were not supported at the population level is not surprising given that interaction effects are reliant on coinfection, or sequential infections, occurring within a short time frame.

The method employs Poisson regression to model observed monthly infection counts adjusting for confounding covariates and underlying test frequencies. This framework uses a multivariate normal distribution to model the random temporal variation in the adjusted virus counts, naturally incorporating a between-virus covariance matrix that enabled estimation of virus\u2013virus correlations. Through estimating, and scaling, the off-diagonal entries of this matrix, we were able to estimate posterior interval estimates for correlations between each virus pair. Under a Bayesian framework, posterior probabilities were estimated to assess the probability of zero being included in each interval (one for each virus pair). Adjusting for multiple comparisons, correlations corresponding to intervals with an adjusted probability less than 0.05 were deemed significantly different from zero. Crucially, the method makes use of multiple years of data, allowing expected annual patterns for any virus to be estimated, thereby accounting for typical seasonal variability in infection risk while also accounting for covariates such as patient age (as well as gender and hospital vs. general practice [GP] patient origin). We identified significant interactions between IAV/RV, IBV/AdV, RSV/MPV, and PIV1/PIV2.

A permutation test of the global null hypothesis was then applied to the 5 remaining virus groups (IBV, CoV, MPV, RSV, and PIVA) to test the hypothesis that the 20 remaining null hypotheses tested were true. Using Fisher\u2019s method of combining P values (62), we found strong evidence of association among these 5 virus groups (P = 0.0021; SI Appendix, Fig. S2), although we expect nonindependence between these tests. We therefore accounted for nonindependence among the pairwise tests by using permutations to simulate the null distribution of combined P values. Each generalized linear model was fitted to 10,000 datasets where the null hypothesis was simulated by permuting the response variable (virus Y). The significant tendency of the distribution of P values toward zero (and away from the uniform distribution expected under the null hypothesis) was illustrated using a quantile\u2013quantile (QQ) plot to compare the 20 observed P values with the 10,000 distributions simulated under the global null hypothesis (Fig. 3C).

We used this framework to compare the frequency of common cold-like virus infections with and without an interference with the influenza-like virus. A schematic representation of the model is provided in SI Appendix, Fig. S4. The temporal dynamics of the viruses were distinguished in 2 key ways. First, seasonal forcing was applied to the influenza-like virus (virus 1) via a sinusoidally varying transmission rate. Second, the rate of waning immunity of the common cold-like virus (virus 2) was assumed to be 10 times faster than for the influenza-like virus. This more rapid replenishment of susceptible individuals was designed to reflect the high year-round prevalence and diversity of circulating subtypes that are characteristic of RV infections (63).",

Infected individuals were assumed not to be susceptible to further infections with the primary infecting virus. Our assumption is that multiple exposures to similar virus strains are unlikely to alter the within-host dynamics during this short period. At the end of the infectious period, individuals entered a noninfectious refractory phase (J) at rate 1/\u03b3 (days\u22121). This second refractory phase was designed to reflect immune effects that may persist for a period beyond viral clearance (64, 65). During both refractory phases, viral interactions are captured via reduced susceptibility of influenza-like virus infected individuals to either coinfection with the common cold-like virus (during phase I) or, alternatively, a secondary infection with the common cold-like virus (during phase J). The strength of the interaction was determined by an interaction parameter \u03c6 applied to the transmission rate, whereby \u03c6 = 0 induced complete susceptibility (equivalent to transmission dynamics in the absence of an interaction), 0 < \u03c6 < 1 induced a partial reduction in susceptibility, and \u03c6 = 1 induced a complete loss of susceptibility.",
