This has plagued the field of sepsis research as the majority of intensive care specialists in a recent survey' felt that the current definitions are inadequate and frequently miss the correct diagnosis. The loosely applied term sepsis is used to connote a syndrome when a patient develops a deleterious systemic host response to an infectious process. In its early stages, sepsis can be difficult to distinguish from an appropriate and localized inflammatory reaction to an uncomplicated infection . The innate im mune response and coagulation networks evolved to defend the host from blood loss and generalized infection following minor injury. These same inflammatory and clotting systems can be detrimental when they become excessive or dysfunctional , as they often become following ma jor injury or systemic infection.",

It is currently estimated that as many as 700,000 patients develop severe sepsis each year in the United States.v\" with similar incidence rates in several European countries.Y The incidence of severe sepsis/septic shock has continuously increased over the past three decades, and the occurrence of sepsis likely will further increase over the next several decades as the population of elderly and vulnerable patients continues to expand. The mortality rate for fully developed septic shock rema ins between 35 % and 45% despite recent improvements in treatment options and outcome.V\" The outcome in sepsis is highly variable and dependent on a large number of preexisting and physiological elements, nonetheless, it is clear that this process alone accounts for hundreds of thousands of deaths per year. 4 ,5 The incidence of sepsis is increasing for several reasons, but primary among them is the fact that sepsis largely has become a disease of medical progress. While sepsis certainly Bacteremia or fungemia is not necessary or sufficient for the diagnosis of sepsis. Microorganisms may transit the bloodstream briefly and without clinical consequences; fatal septic shock may occur in the absence of documented bacteremia or fungemia. Infection (local or systemic) accompanied by a systemic inflammatory response (e.g., fever, leukocytosis, tachycardia, tachypnea). It may be difficult to distinguish a physiologic host response to infection from a deleterious (septic) response. Sepsis-induced organ dysfunction (central nervous system dysfunction, acute lung injury, renal failure, hepatic dysfunction, coagulopathy, metabolic acidosis, cardiovascular dysfunction) remote from the site of active infection; this should be distinguished from preexisting organ dysfunction. This is clinically defined as failure to maintain a systolic blood pressure above 90mmHg (or mean arterial pressure >65mmHg) following an adequate fluid challenge (>40ml/kg over 6h). occurs in previously healthy persons (e.g., meningococcal sepsis, toxic shock syndrome, and severe community-acquired pneumonia), the majority of septic patients have significant underlying diseases that place them at risk for sepsis.'? Successful management of a variety of severe trauma situations and medical illnesses and advances in surgical interventions are salvaging patients who only a few generations ago would have rapidly succumbed. This has produced a large susceptible population of patients with prolonged critical illness and impaired host defenses.\" These patients have a greatly increased risk of developing sepsis. Innovations in organ transplantation, implanted prosthetic devices, and long-term vascular access devices continue to expand in this patient population. The gradual aging of the population in many developed countries and the increasing prevalence of antibiotic-resistant microbial pathogens also conspire to increase the incidence of severe sepsis/septic shock.",

Regulation of T-cell activity in sepsis is clinically relevant. A generalized TH 2-type response characteristically occurs after an initial septic insult. The stress hormone response in septic shock, with expression of adrenocorticotropic hormone, corticosteroids, prostaglandins, and catecholamines, promotes a TH 2 response after systemic injury. Hotchkiss et a1. 59,72 have provided another potential explanation for the relative immune suppression (or immune paralysis) that often accompanies sepsis. Selective apoptosis of CD4+ T cells and B cells along with follicular dendritic cells is highly characteristic of severe sepsis. This selective loss of immune effector cells may contribute to the increased risk for secondary bacterial or fungal infection in the later phases of sepsis. Neutrophils are naturally apoptotic cells, and inflammatory cytokines and growth factors actually cause delayed apoptosis of neutrophils in sepsis.\" Accelerated caspase function and excess apoptosis also occur in intestinal epithelial cells, compromising mucosal permeability barrier function of the gut. 59 This pathophysiologic state is further aggravated by sepsis-induced endotoxin tolerance (or reprogramming]\" and deactivation of monocytes, macrophages, and neutrophils by cytokine inhibitors such as IL-l receptor antagonist and antiinflammatory cytokines such as IL-I0. 75 Depressed expression of MHC class II antigens (HLA-DR), TNF receptors, TLRs, and perhaps other cell surface activation signals may contribute to this functionally immunosuppressed state.\"",

Nitric oxide is generated by one of three isoforms of NOS (endothelial, neuronal, and inducible NOS).77 Regulation of the human NOSs is complex. Full expression of the inducible form of NOS requires TNF-a, IL-l, LPS, and probably other regulatory elements. Nitric oxide is the major endothelial-derived relaxing factor that initiates the systemic hypotension observed in septic shock. Nitric oxide activates guanylate cyclase, which increases cyclic guanosine monophosphate levels inside vascular smooth muscle cells. The resultant smooth muscle relaxation in precapillary arterioles lowers peripheral vascular resistance. 76 The other major physiologic effects of NO in septic shock are increased intracellular killing and regulation of platelet and neutrophil adherence. In the presence of reactive oxygen intermediates such as superoxide anion, NO leads to the formation of peroxynitrite. Peroxynitrite decays intracellularly into highly cytotoxic molecules, including hydroxyl radicals and nitrosyl chloride. These reactive nitrogen intermediates (RNI) activate an intracellular enzyme known as PARP (poly ADP-ribose polymerase). This enzyme rapidly depletes the cellular contents of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), resulting in cellular energy starvation.\" These RNIs also induce lipid peroxidation and cause loss of cell viability.\" Nitric oxide also inhibits a variety of metalloenzymes and essential enzymes in the tricarboxylic acid cycle, the glycolytic pathway, DNA repair systems, and electron transport pathways.",

It has a long half-life (approximately 24h) and will increase from undetectable levels to greater than 100ng/ml in severe sepsis/septic shock. Higher levels are associated with more severe systemic infection. II?

The development of one or more organ dysfunctions at the onset of severe sepsis, or over the course of sepsis, is a poor prognostic factor and major determinant of outcome (Table 15.6 ).3,15 The diffuse endothelial injury, proapoptotic signals, immune dysregulation, and coagulopathy induced from septic shock conspire in concert to produce organ dysfunction distant from the original site of infection. It is generally assumed that the activation signals in the pathogenesis of multiorgan injury derive from plasma factors (e.g., proinflammatory cytokines, complement, phospholipid mediators),67 but cellular signals from circulating blood components/\" or neuroendocrine signals may also contribute to remote organ iniury.!\" Inadequate blood supply to vital tissues likely contributes to organ dysfunction. The failure of the microcirculation to maintain tissue viability is related to hypoperfusion, redistribution of blood flow within vascular beds, functional arteriovenous shunting, obstruction ofblood flow from microthrombi, platelet or white blood cell aggregates, or abnormal deformability of red blood cells. Direct endothelial injury from NO, reactive oxygen and nitrogen intermediates, proinflammatory cytokines, activated cytotoxic T cells and NK cells, and inducers of apoptosis may directly damage endothelial surfaces. 59, 72, 105 Acute lung injury occurs as a result of damage to the pulmonary vascular circulation and the alveolar-capillary membranes. The acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality in septic shock.\" Avoidance of barotrauma and volutrauma, avoidance of oxidant injury, maintenance of functional alveolar capillary units through position change (prone position), judicious Adherence and extravasation and delayed apoptosis of neutrophils, selective loss of B cells, CD4+T cells, and follicular dendritic cells Increased muscle catabolism, progressive loss of somatic muscle tissue Cerebral edema, micro thrombi Altered calcium influx, interstitial edema, myocardial hibernation Exudation of fluid into the alveolar spaces, neutrophil plugging, hyaline membrane formation Hypoperfusion, focal ischemia, micro thrombi Focal or diffuse hemorrhage, ischemic necrosis of adrenals, increased vascular sensi tivity to vasopressin Zonal necrosis, acalculous cholecystitis Diffuse interstitial edema, breaks in the epithelial membrane integrity, mucosal necrosis fluid management, and semirecumbent body positioning all reduce progressive lung damage in ventilated patients.!\" The ARDS clinical trials network study confirmed the value of low stretch tidal volume settings (6mljkg) over more conventional high tidal volume settings (12mljkg).120 Low tidal volume ventilation should be utilized whenever feasible to minimize further acute lung injury in a ventilated patient.

Dopamine has been the vasopressor agent of choice for several decades based on its presumed salutary effects on renal vasodilatation and its modest inotropic effects.P' The actual clinical value of dopamine compared with other vasopressor agents has been brought into question. Dopamine has complex effects as this catecholamine has its own receptors (Dl and D2 dopaminergic receptors) and variable affinities for a-and~-adrenergic receptors. The net effect of dopamine depends on many variables, including the receptor density in specific vascular beds, blood volume, and the rate of administration of drug dose used. Higher doses of dopamine increase the systemic vascular resistance by its effects on a-adrenergic receptors in the peripheral circulation. Dopamine may have adverse effects on splanchnic blood flow,3,124 and there is no evidence in controlled trials that dopamine has any meaningful renal perfusion benefits.' The use of dopamine as a \"renal-sparing\" agent is no longer justified (grade B). 3, 125 Norepinephrine is a potent vasoconstrictor that is used more frequently to treat the hemodynamic effects of septic shock. Earlier concerns regarding adverse consequences of norepinephrine on renal blood flow may have been overstated; studies suggested that norepinephrine may actually increase urine output and creatinine clearance in septic patients.!\" Norepinephrine may rapidly restore perfusion pressure within the glomerulus and result in improved glomerular filtration in patients with adequate fluid resuscitation. Current consensus opinion recommends either dopamine or norepinephrine as the initial vasopressor to correct hypotension in septic shock (grade D). 3 Vasopressin is a potent vasopressor in refractory sepsis. Endogenous vasopressin levels rapidly fall in sepsis, and vasopressin has its own vascular receptors that are distinct from adrenergic receptors and often upregulated in sepsis.!\" There is concern about diminished splanchnic blood flow with higher doses of vasopressin, and myocardial ischemia may occur at infusion rates above 0.04 unit/min. Vasopressin may be considered in refractory shock, but it has not replaced dopamine or norepinephrine for first-line vasopressors in septic shock (grade E). 3 Dobutamine, a~-agonist, may improve cardiac output and oxygen delivery in some patients in septic shock with persistently low cardiac output. Dobutamine may cause peripheral vasodilatation in septic patients, and it increases myocardial oxygen consumption by its inotropic effects. ' Another approach to improved tissue oxygen delivery is by use of vasodilators to open up poorly perfused capillary beds in patients with septic shock. Spronk et al. 128 reported the use of nitroglycerin therapy in patients following intravascular volume resuscitation. Using an optical device to measure microcirculatory flow (orthogonal polarization spec-tral imaging), they were able to show improved microvascular flow rates in septic patients who received adequate fluid repletion. This is an appealing strategy but must be considered experimental at present until further clinical trials are completed using this approach.",
