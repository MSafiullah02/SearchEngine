Our previous study has shown that 18 human virus receptor proteins have some unique features including high 19 N-glycosylation level, high number of interaction partners and high expression level. 20 Here, a random-forest model was built to identify human virus receptorome from 21 human cell membrane proteins with an accepted accuracy based on the combination 22 of the unique features of human virus receptors and protein sequences. A total of 1380 23 human cell membrane proteins were predicted to constitute the receptorome of the 24 human-infecting virome. In addition, the combination of the random-forest model 25 with protein-protein interactions between human and viruses predicted in previous 26 48 experimental methods have been developed for identifying virus receptors. The first 49 approach is to select candidate membrane proteins that can bind to the virus 50 receptor-binding proteins (RBPs) by affinity purification and mass spectroscopy (Free 51 et al., 2009; Ryu, 2016). The second approach is firstly to identify monoclonal 52 antibodies which can block the virus entry, and then take the membrane proteins to 53 which the monoclonal antibodies bind as candidate receptor proteins (Minor et al., 54 1984; Ryu, 2016). The third approach is to identify virus receptors by functional 55 cloning selection based on the cDNA expression library (Ryu, 2016). The proteins 56 76 77 Materials and Methods 78 Human virus receptors, human cell membrane proteins and human membrane 79 proteins 80 A total of 91 human virus protein receptors were obtained from the viralReceptor 81 database (available at http://www.computationalbiology.cn:5000/viralReceptor) that 82 was developed in our previous study (Zhang et al., 2019).

As far as we know, this study 28 is the first attempt to predict the receptorome for the human-infecting virome and 29 would greatly facilitate the identification of the receptors for viruses. ligands are the preferred receptors for viruses (Dimitrov, 2004; Wang, 2002) . 40 Moreover, based on a collection of 119 mammalian virus receptors, our recent study 41 has further revealed that human virus receptor proteins have higher level of were considered to be human cell membrane proteins. The human proteins with the 87 words of \"membrane\" and \"cell surface\" in the field of \"Subcellular location\" were 88 considered to be human membrane proteins. A total of 3,642 human cell membrane 89 proteins and 7,663 human membrane proteins were obtained. Figure S1 showed that the AUC of the RF 205 models increased rapidly as the increase of N from 1 to 10. Then, it increased slowly or even decreased when more than ten features were used. Therefore, only top ten 207 features were used in the modeling to balance the performance and complexity of the 208 model. The RF model based on top ten features achieved an AUC of 0.71. 209 To further improve the model for predicting the receptorome of the human-infecting of viral RBP and its receptor, the rank of the real receptor among the predicted 245 RBP-interacting proteins was obtained, and then the related rank percentage was 246 calculated (Materials and Methods). Ten real receptors were ranked in top one by the 247 RF model (Table 3) while that was 0.10 by the RF model (Table 3) . ",

Currently, several that can enable viral infection of the non-susceptible cells after transfection are 57 considered as the receptor candidates. However, the identification of virus receptors is 58 still time-consuming and difficult at present. Besides, the limitations on scalability 59 have hampered the large-scale identification of viral receptors. Therefore, it is urgent 60 to develop the computational methods for the identification of the human have developed several computational models for predicting the PPIs 64 between viruses and hosts which can help identify virus receptors (Lasso et al., 2019; 65 Yan et al., 2019). For example, Lasso et al. developed an in silico computational 66 framework (P-HIPSTer) that employed the structural information to predict more than 67 280,000 PPIs between 1,001 human-infecting viruses and humans, and made a series 68 of new findings about human-virus interactions (Lasso et al., 2019). The predicted 69 PPIs between viral RBPs and human cell membrane proteins can be used to identify 70 virus receptors. Here, a computational model was developed to predict the 71 receptorome of the human-infecting virome based on the features of human virus 72 receptors and protein sequences. Furthermore, the combination of this computational 73 model with the PPIs predicted in Lasso's work was further used to predict the 74 receptors for 693 human-infecting viruses.

Machine learning modeling 119 To distinguish human virus receptors from other human cell membrane proteins using 120 machine learning models, the human virus receptors were chosen as positive samples. 121 Since the human cell membrane proteins may contain virus receptors unidentified yet, 122 the human membrane proteins were taken as negative samples after excluding all human proteins were observed in the used human PPI network or 126 showed the observed expressions in the available data, only the human proteins that 127 possess all the three protein features, i.e., the N-glycosylation level, node degree and 128 expression in common human tissues, were used in the modeling. Besides, the 129 sequence redundancy in both human virus receptor proteins and human membrane 130 proteins was removed using CD-HIT (version 4.8.1) (Fu et al., 2012) at 70% identity 131 level. Finally, a total of 88 human virus receptors and 1,743 human membrane 132 proteins were used in the machine learning modeling. 133 134 The random-forest (RF) model is an ensemble machine learning technique using 135 multiple decision trees and can handle data with high variance and high bias, while 136 the risk of over-fitting can be significantly reduced by averaging multiple trees. 137 Therefore, the RF model was chosen to distinguish human virus receptors from other 138 human cell membrane proteins.

The RBPs of human-infecting viruses were compiled from three sources: the 157 ViralZone database (Masson et al., 2012), the UniprotKB database in which viral 158 proteins were annotated with GO terms \"viral entry into host cell\" or \"virion 159 attachment the host cell\", and the literatures related to viral RBPs. The viruses 160 belonging to the same viral family were supposed to use the same RBPs. For example, 161 all coronaviruses were supposed to take the spike protein as RBPs. 162 163 To evaluate the ability of the RF model in identification of virus receptors, 25 pairs of 164 experimentally validated interactions between viral RBPs and receptors, and the 165 predicted PPIs between these viral RBPs and human cell membrane proteins were 166 extracted from the P-HIPSTer database. For each viral RBP, the predicted 167 RBP-interacting human cell membrane proteins were ranked by either the LR 168 provided in Lasso's work, or the predicted score provided by the RF model.

Our previous studies have 277 shown that human virus receptor proteins have some unique features compared to 278 other cell membrane proteins, including high N-glycosylation level, high number of 279 interaction partners and high expression level. This study further built a RF model for 280 identifying human virus receptors from human cell membrane proteins with an 281 accepted accuracy. Based on the RF model, the receptorome for the human-infecting 282 virome was predicted, which included a total of 1380 human cell membrane proteins. The results could facilitate the identification of human virus receptors. In the previous study, Lasso et al. developed a computational model for predicting PPIs between human-infecting viruses and human (Lasso et al., 2019). A variable 287 number of human cell membrane proteins were predicted to interact with viral RBPs. To further select the potential receptors for viruses, both the LR and the RF model 289 were used to rank the viral RBP-interacting human cell membrane proteins. The RF 290 model was found to rank the real receptors better than the LR in a small validation 291 dataset, suggesting that the performance of the RF model may be superior to that of 292 the LR in selecting the real receptors from the predicted RBP-interacting human cell 293 membrane proteins. The combination of the RF model and the RBP-interacting 294 human cell membrane proteins predicted in Lasso's work enabled the prediction of 295 receptors for 693 human-infecting viruses(Table S2). Nevertheless, more efforts are 296 needed to validate these candidate receptors in future studies.There are some limitations to this study. Firstly, the number of human virus receptor299    proteins was much smaller than that of human membrane proteins in the modeling, which may hinder accurate modeling. Thus, the under-sampling method was used to 301 deal with the imbalance problem. Secondly, the performance of the RF model was302 modest in discriminating human virus receptor proteins from human membrane 303 proteins. More efforts are still needed to improve the model. Thirdly, although the RF 304 model can be used to predict the receptorome of human-infecting virome, it is not 305 feasible to use the model to identify the receptors for a specific human-infecting virus. The combination of the RF model with the model of PPI predictions such as Lasso's 307 work can help identify virus-receptor interactions. In conclusion, this study for the first time built a computational model for predicting 310 the receptorome of the human-infecting virome. The results can facilitate the 311 identification of human virus receptors in either computational or experimental",
