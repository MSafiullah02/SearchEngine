It was first discovered in 1956, and subsequent animal studies showed promising general anesthetic properties [1]. In 1964, ketamine was introduced as an anesthetic for humans and has thus been available for more than 50 years. Ketamine exists as two optical isomers: (S)-(+) and (R)-(\u2212)-2-(2-chlorophenyl)-2-(methylamino)cyclohexanone. At present, ketamine is available as S-ketamine, the more potent of the two optical isomers, and as a racemic mixture containing both (S+) and (R\u2212) ketamine.",

These are waves of abrupt, near-complete breakdown of neuronal transmembrane ion gradients and are phenomena that have been associated with poor neurological outcome in patients with TBI [8]. Spreading depolarizations occur in relation to local ischemia but are also seen in the hours or days after ischemia as the remaining tissue suffers from lack of energy supply.",

            "text": "Of the 11 included studies, seven evaluated the effect on intracranial pressure (ICP) [15\u201317, 19\u201322]. All seven studies were conducted in adult [15, 16, 19\u201322] or pediatric [17] patients with TBI, subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), or other intracranial illnesses (e.g., drowned patients with cerebral edema) in an ICU setting and under controlled ventilation. Three studies found no overall difference in ICP between patients receiving ketamine and the matching control group [15, 21, 22]. One study reported slightly elevated ICP of 5 and 8 mmHg in day 8 and 10 with an overall median of 14.6 mmHg [19]. One study found an elevated ICP during tracheal suctioning of head injured patients [20]. The ICP was elevated 4.1 mmHg and 7.5 mmHg in the intervention and control, respectively. Furthermore, it was found that ketamine in this study prevented cough reflexes [20]. One study reported both decreased ICP values (range 1\u20135 mmHg) 2 min after ketamine administration and elevated (range 3\u20134 mmHg) ICP values 30 min after ketamine bolus. However, no evidence of harm was reported despite the ICP elevation [16]. One study found decreased ICP values from 25.8 \u00b1 8.4 to 18.0 \u00b1 8.5 mmHg [17] for 2 min following ketamine administration in a pediatric population. In this study, 20 of the 30 included patients received hyperosmolar therapy (either mannitol or 3% NaCl) shortly before ketamine administration [17]. Overall, none of the seven studies reported persistent adverse effects in relation to increased ICP or increased mortality after ketamine administration in brain-injured patients [15, 16, 19\u201322].",

Alpha, beta, delta, and theta frequencies are direct recordings of electrical potentials associated with brain activity. It was found that in 43 patients, the occurrence of alpha, beta, delta, and theta frequencies, and their mutual proportion was a potential predictor of the occurrence of SD. Firstly, the investigators found that when the occurrence of beta frequencies diminished, an increased number of SDs took place, indicating an association between beta frequencies and SD [18]. Secondly, an increased occurrence of beta frequencies and thus a reduced occurrence of SD were observed, accordingly indicating that ketamine increases the occurrence of beta frequencies and therefore limits SD [18]. With regard to the three remaining electrocorticographic frequencies alpha, delta, and theta, no association was found in relation to the occurrence of SD [18]. This is supported by a third study [16] which found a dose-related burst suppression (a low amplitude fast activity with electrogenic depression) on EEG of patients treated with ketamine. However, these EEG recordings were performed externally as usual, with electrodes on the scalp in contrast to the invasive SD recordings. A fourth small randomized study [23] also demonstrated an inhibitory dose-dependent effect of ketamine on the occurrence of SD with an odds ratio of 13.84 (95% CI 1.99\u20131000), for the occurrence of SD when not treated with ketamine or when treated with a dose less than 1.15 mg/kg/h.",

Its use in treatment of patients suffering from TBI or other conditions with the risk of elevated ICP have been debated since the 1960s after several studies found that ketamine contributed to an elevation in ICP [25]. In this systematic review, only two prospective studies [19, 20] showed elevated ICP during ketamine use. In one study, this elevation was observed during suctioning that is known to induce a raise in ICP, even among healthy volunteers [20]. The other study found elevated ICP in the ketamine group on two different days (5 mmHg and 8 mmHg on day 8 and 10, respectively) with an overall median ICP of 14.6 mmHg [19]. However, this minor elevation of ICP, still within the normal range, does not seem clinically relevant. None of the three randomized controlled trials in adults [15, 21, 22] found increased ICP levels during intravenous infusion of ketamine, nor was any effect on CPP or MAP reported. None of the prospective clinical controlled studies in adults found any change in MAP or CPP during ketamine administration. One randomized controlled trial involving children found a small increase in CPP [17]. Two studies in adults and children [16, 17] found decreased ICP values during ketamine administration. Both used a single bolus of ketamine and observed a decreased ICP shortly after administration.",

Three studies [9, 16, 23] showed a significant reduction in the occurrence of SD with a ketamine dose-related correlation. Increased SD was associated with poorer neurological outcome [9]. This indicates that ketamine might act as a neuroprotective agent through modulation of SD in the traumatic brain. One study [18] investigated whether spreading depolarizations could be predicted through electrocorticographic frequencies in patients suffering TBI. This study revealed frequent SDs in relation to suppressions of ECoG beta frequencies indicating that this could predict the occurrence of SD. Further, ketamine was found partially to increase the amount of beta frequencies and thereby inhibit the occurrence of SD [18]. However, this was a retrospective study with only a partial effect of ketamine on beta frequencies and SD, indicating that further prospective studies are warranted. Even externally EEG recordings showed burst suppression following ketamine administration supporting the theory of an inhibitory effect on neuronal activity of ketamine [16].",

However, one randomized controlled trial and two prospective trials on the effects of ketamine on neurological outcome did not report the targeted partial pressure of CO2 in arterial gasses of the patients included in the studies [17, 19, 22]. Furthermore, none of the eleven studies reported how often the partial pressure of CO2 was controlled. Two [17, 19] of the three studies [17, 19, 22] that did not control PaCO2 found either lowered or elevated ICP levels. All studies used ventilators. No patients were on spontaneous breathing which, in an animal model, has shown to increase intracranial pressure during ketamine sedation [27]. We thus recommend hesitation in relation to conclusions regarding potential correlations between ketamine administration and changes in ICP levels. Non-standardized mechanical ventilation without control of arterial blood gases most probably may contribute to bias and confounding.",

Many attempts have been made in order to elucidate whether anesthetic agents in general affect the developing human brain. Recently, a systemic review [30] investigating the effect of general anesthesia on children has been published. Children exposed to general anesthesia were investigated with respect to various parameters including cognition, sensory-motor development, academic achievement, and neuropsychological diagnoses in later life. Also, magnetic resonance imaging, serum biomarkers, mortality, neurological examination, measurement of head circumference, and impairment of vision were investigated. The studies concerned anesthesia in general, but no specific consideration was made regarding the kind of anesthetic agents utilized. To our knowledge, no studies, neither prospective nor retrospective, have been made on long-term outcome for children treated with ketamine as an anesthetic agent.",
