Infections related to technical complications are common. These infections may be due to vascular or nonvascular anastomotic problems and a thorough understanding of the transplanted organ anatomy is important. For example, in liver transplant recipients the biliary anastomosis may leak or stricture. Biliary leaks or bilomas represent common sites for the initiation of infection. Thrombosis of the hepatic artery is uncommon but may lead to devastating complications, including hepatic abscesses, necrosis, and sepsis. Early imaging and diagnosis are essential in this setting.",

Infectious complications precipitate the majority of admissions to critical care post-transplantation, and patients are susceptible to an increasingly diverse array of common and opportunistic infecting pathogens. Clinicians must maintain a high index of suspicion for infection, and conduct early, thorough diagnostic work-up coupled with prompt institution of antimicrobial therapy. Detailed individualized infection risk assessments are central to guiding therapeutic care pathways and optimizing clinical outcomes.",
