Similarly, science also provided the objective evidence of the natural inferiority of women, the homosexuals, the colonized, and the enslaved.

Such practice leads to a \"myth of experimenticism\" namely following the path from experiment to theory (emphasis on empirical methods) not only does not provide greater objectivity but also deprives students of an environment that facilitates thinking and understanding arguments.

Furthermore, if femininity is viewed as mutually exclusive with masculinity, this also leads to femininity being considered as lacking the scientific traits. The politically engaged standpoint of feminism is less partial and distorted than the standpoint of conventional scientific inquiry. Overcoming such simplistic relationships and dualisms can facilitate a critical examination of science and a better understanding of gender in science education. This conflict between masculine and feminist traits can at times lead women to abandon careers in science.

The dilemma faced by the teacher is based on the fact that although students may seem to understand evolution (based on evidence) they generally do not believe in it. In such cases, the cultural milieu of the students in which the subject is taught is important. It is even suggested that today's teacher of evolution faces a situation very similar to Darwin when he presented the Origin of Species. Consequently, the interaction between the understanding based on belief in the absence of objective evidence and acceptance based on evidence can provide a better understanding of the nature of science. In general, teachers' perceptions and beliefs about learning also affect how they approach the material and what they teach. At this stage a word of caution is necessary: if our goal as teachers is to get students to believe the content we teach-then that may be considered as indoctrination and not education (I owe this observation to Aikenhead, 2016) . More recently, based on contemporary epistemology/philosophy of mind scholarship, Smith and Siegel (2016) have clarified that belief is involuntary and need not be used as a basis for inference or action, whereas acceptance is voluntary and involves a commitment to use what is accepted in one's practical reasoning. However, it is important to note a caveat based on history of science, which shows that in some cases even scientists do not agree with respect to the interpretation of evidence as they have different prior epistemological beliefs. In other words, changes in science can occur by means other than rational consideration of empirical evidence. Furthermore, although objectivity is a value that all scientists strive for in their work, what is a fact in science is continually reevaluated in the light of ongoing research. 7.7 Mertonian \"Ethos of Science\" and Objectivity Merton's (1942) \"ethos of science\" is based on norms of universalism, communism, disinterestedness, and organized skepticism. Merton believed that these institutional values are transmitted by precept and example, perhaps during the course of a scientist's educational career and can even be considered as the idealized \"view from nowhere\" (Reiss, 2014) . Is there a contradiction between Merton's \"ethos of science\" and Daston and Galison's understanding of objectivity in science? It seems that increasing commodification may jeopardize Mertonian norms of openness in scientific practice, truthfulness, objectivity, trust, accuracy, and respect for expertise (Vermeir, 2013) . Similarly, social constructivism may jeopardize Merton's \"ethos of science\" (Slezak, 1994) . Longino (1990) underscores the need for criticism from alternative perspectives and thus postulates a social structure for achieving Merton's \"organized criticism.\" Merton's universalism does seem to imply the objectivity of scientific knowledge (McCarthy, 2014) . However, if we do not conflate objectivity with universal and unconditional correctness of scientific knowledge, but rather consider scientific inquiry to provide a greater degree of objectivity (Daston & Galison, 2007) , then Merton's ethos of science can still provide guidance. Despite these difficulties, it seems that Mertonian norms of the scientific enterprise can be reinforced by following the process of trained judgment rather than mechanical objectivity.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1069, "end": 1085, "text": "Aikenhead, 2016)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1170, "end": 1193, "text": "Smith and Siegel (2016)", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 1975, "end": 1990, "text": "Merton's (1942)", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 2315, "end": 2328, "text": "(Reiss, 2014)", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 2636, "end": 2651, "text": "(Vermeir, 2013)", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}, {"start": 2730, "end": 2744, "text": "(Slezak, 1994)", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}, {"start": 2747, "end": 2761, "text": "Longino (1990)", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 2993, "end": 3009, "text": "(McCarthy, 2014)", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 3207, "end": 3231, "text": "(Daston & Galison, 2007)", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Interaction Between Evidence and Belief (Faith) and the Quest for Objectivity"}, {"text": "Understanding of constructivism in Piaget's theory of cognitive development and genetic epistemology has been the subject of considerable controversy in science education research. In this theoretical framework, construction of knowledge by the child is the result of a subjective knower within a social context that facilitates transformation, organization, and interpretation of structures leading to a dialectical interaction. An important implication for science education is that \"objectivity is a process and not a state\" (Piaget, 1971 ) that means a continuous series of successive approximations toward objectivity that may never be achieved. In other words, objectivity is not an \"all or nothing thing,\" but rather it comes in degrees (Machamer & Wolters, 2004) . Similarly, in Piaget's genetic epistemology, studying the psychological subject can lead to an approximation toward the epistemic subject. This means that a classroom teacher needs to be more concerned about the process (and not the product) that can facilitate an approximation toward what may be considered as objective or even perhaps iconic knowledge in a particular domain of science content. Research reported in science education provides evidence for constructivist teaching strategies that facilitate change by taking into consideration students' alternative conceptions as part of the process of conceptual understanding. Such experiences lead to innovative teaching strategies based on the following: audit the process rather than the product. Similarly, Gergen's (1994) understanding of objectivity as involving the dynamics of process-product complements Daston and Galison's (1992) truth-to-nature. It is plausible to suggest that the underlying ideas of Daston and Galison, Gergen and Piaget (formulated in different domains of knowledge) go beyond the positivist understanding of objectivity and even complement each other. Similarly, it seems that there is a possible relationship between Cushing's (1995) idea of contingency and the historical evolution of the regime of objectivity as presented by Daston and Galison (2007) . Cushing refers to the hegemony of the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics over its rivals on non-epistemic reasons, that is on grounds that were not necessarily objective or rational. In Daston and Galison's (2007) framework this could be understood as an episode in which trained judgment of the community prevailed. It is plausible to suggest that it is perhaps the contingent nature of science (Cushing, 1995) that manifests itself in the evolving nature of objectivity. Quantum mechanics and valence theory provide good examples of such changing or competing theories (cf. Niaz, 2016).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 528, "end": 541, "text": "(Piaget, 1971", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 744, "end": 770, "text": "(Machamer & Wolters, 2004)", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 1539, "end": 1554, "text": "Gergen's (1994)", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 1641, "end": 1668, "text": "Daston and Galison's (1992)", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 1979, "end": 1995, "text": "Cushing's (1995)", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 2090, "end": 2115, "text": "Daston and Galison (2007)", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 2316, "end": 2343, "text": "Daston and Galison's (2007)", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 2526, "end": 2541, "text": "(Cushing, 1995)", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Objectivity as a Process and not a State"}, {"text": "As scientists are part of a society, the notion that a scientific expert can be entirely neutral, value-free, and objective is difficult to understand. Despite efforts to present science as objective and autonomous, its relationship with capital and market forces is well known, and at times a picture of value-free science is presented as more of a romantic principle. The argument for a value-free science is difficult to sustain as most human activities are value-laden and historians of science have recognized this facet of the progress in science. Consequently, although historians, philosophers of science, and science educators may aspire for a science that is value-free, neutral and objective, the real picture of the scientific enterprise is much more complex. Furthermore, insisting on the objectivity and neutrality of science and ignoring the social forces that determine its progress does not facilitate a critical appreciation by students. Following are some examples of topics that involve ethics and values: depletion of ozone layer, genetics, gene therapy, stem cell research, xenotransplantation, napalm, agent orange, pollution, nuclear weapons, garbage collection, among others. Furthermore, history of science shows that facts have rarely been loyal to values which initially led to their identification. A good example is Darwin's use of facts that had been gathered by his teleologically oriented predecessors associated with a different set of values. In the case of gender and phrenology, objectivity and neutrality of the scientific enterprise was compromised. Consideration of the problematic nature of value neutrality leads to a thought-provoking question: if the ideal of value-free inquiry is flawed, what is to replace it? Based on Longino (2002) , a possible alternative is \"social value management\" which involves non-epistemic values (social, economic, and other) (Irzik, 2015) . As science is a human construction, scientists first prefer their own interpretation of the data, which may or may not change (or change partially) under the scrutinizing lenses of the scientific community. In this context, it would be interesting if courage, humility, and willingness to suspend judgment can also be considered as necessary values in the scientific enterprise. Holton (1978a, b) has, for example, recognized the role of \"willingness to suspend judgement\" in the historical reconstruction of the oil drop experiment. It is plausible to suggest that there is an underlying tension between scientific progress and the assumptions with respect to its neutrality and objectivity.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1766, "end": 1780, "text": "Longino (2002)", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 1901, "end": 1914, "text": "(Irzik, 2015)", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 2296, "end": 2313, "text": "Holton (1978a, b)", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Objectivity and Value Neutrality in Science"}, {"text": "In most educational systems, the virtues of the traditional scientific tradition (rationality, objectivity, and skepticism) are challenged by strands of irrationality, subjectivity, and credulity and this can pose considerable problems for the science teacher.

Precisely, the evolving nature of objectivity based on the history of science can be a source of guidance for the educational community.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Objectivity-Subjectivity as the Two Poles of a Continuum"}, {"text": "Quantitative research methodology in education can be associated with positivistic styles of thinking. On the other hand, integration of qualitative and quantitative research methodologies can provide a better understanding of objectivity by facilitating competition between divergent approaches to research. In the interpretive research paradigm (social constructivist), traditional standards of internal and external validity, reliability and objectivity are replaced or complemented with notions of credibility, transferability, dependability, and confirmability. Triangulation based on different data sources is particularly helpful in enhancing credibility of the research. Such research experiences inevitably recognize the relationship between objectivity and the underlying subjectivity that leads to the creation of multiple realities. The dualism between objectivity and subjectivity leads to a conflict in the evolving nature of progress in science. Ignoring this duality may lead to the hegemony of objective knowledge and the consequent emphasis on rote learning. During scientific research, subjective and objective aspects interact by means of communication and peer reviews within the scientific community. In the case of students' thinking of nature of science, it is plausible to suggest that it progresses from one pole of empiricist epistemology to another, which considers subjective limitations in both components of scientific knowledge, namely empirical evidence and coordinating theory. It has also been argued that in qualitative research a detached observer claiming objectivity would not be able to access suitable data. Daston and Galison (1992, p. 82 ) have referred to a similar tension between subjectivity and objectivity, in the history of science itself. In other words, the personal construction of the students (subjective) can always be contrasted with the objective canonical knowledge, leading to integration. Those who work in the lab (both students and scientists) can face a dilemma when they have to deal with the subjectivist doubts with respect to observations.

The tension between subjectivity and objectivity in assessment provides an opportunity to reflect upon the very essence of the scientific enterprise, namely doing and understanding science involves interpretation and not just memorizing algorithms, hence the importance of conceptual problems. Furthermore, school science is generally considered to be scientific that is characterized by rationality, precision, formality, detachment, and objectivity. In contrast, everyday science is considered to denote an opposing set of characteristics such as improvisation, ambiguity, informality, engagement, and subjectivity.

Objectivity consists not in denying preconceptions/presuppositions, but in the ability to modify beliefs in the light of emerging evidence and also encouraging openmindedness. Scientists make errors and it is the community of scientists that helps to facilitate change by espousing open-mindedness. History of science shows that although scientists at a certain stage may have good reasons to believe that they need to go beyond objectivity, this does not represent relativity but rather openmindedness. This serves to enhance the objectivity of collectively scrutinized scientific knowledge through decreasing the impact of individual scientists' idiosyncrasies and subjectivities. For example, although some creationists reject objectivity and relativize the truth of scientific knowledge, they are not necessarily open-minded. Another example of this aspect is the initial acceptance of the paramyxovirus as the causative agent of SARS and its replacement by the coronavirus, which illustrates not only the tentativeness of science but also skepticism and open-mindedness (Wong, Kwan, Hodson, & Jung, 2009 ).

In a similar vein, Daston and Galison (2007, p. 377 ) have endorsed Polanyi, by suggesting that logical positivism approximates to mechanical objectivity, whereas what scientists actually do (based on tacit knowledge) represents trained judgment. According to Guba and Lincoln (1989) , tacit knowledge is all that we know minus all we can say, consequently, \"\u2026 if the investigator is to be prohibited from using tacit knowledge (Polanyi, 1966) as he or she attempts to pry open this oyster of unknowns, the possibility of constructivist inquiry would be severely constrained, if not eliminated altogether\" (p. 176). It is precisely the \"tacit assumptions\" that underlie the frameworks scientists use to design and develop their research programs that lead them to emphasize reason, empirical evidence, and objectivity. Furthermore, it seems that scientists are probably less reflective of \"tacit assumptions\" that guide their reasoning than most other intellectuals of the modern age (Blake, 1994) .

In contrast, postpositivist perspectives in the philosophy of science (Phillips & Burbules, 2000) provide a better understanding by facilitating an integration of domain-specific information (plausibility of hypotheses) and domain-general aspects of the nature of science (heuristics that guide explorations).

History of science shows that no set of objective rules or method can explain theory choice sufficiently. A scientist needs considerable experience to know under what circumstances and in what way any posited rules (formulated a priori) should be applied. Some science teachers believe that use of creativity and imagination (i.e., lack of a scientific method) during the interpretation phase of the data may compromise the objectivity of the scientists. On the contrary, history of science shows that it is precisely during the interpretation of the data that scientists need to be more creative.

Within this perspective, recognition of the social character of inquiry espouses pluralism, and acknowledges explanatory pluralism (Longino, 2002) . Similarly, Giere (2006b) has recommended a pluralism of perspectives and that knowledge claims are perspectival rather than absolutely objective and hence cannot provide a \"true\" or \"correct\" answer to a problem. Pretensions of science to objectivity need to be countered with the social dimensions of knowledge. Errors in science are corrected by communication, first within the research group and later within the wider scientific community. In other words, objectivity in its purest sense is perhaps never an option, and is best understood within a social perspective based on sharing and communicating ideas. It is not the dualistic separation of objective and subjective knowledge (e.g., rational and creative, researcher, and researched) but rather the specific, social, cultural, and sociopolitical contexts that facilitate progress in science. Recent work on the life of Charles Darwin has shown that his theory of evolution was inextricably linked with its social dimensions. Knowledge is achieved primarily through a process of inquiry that is characterized by its social, experimental, and fallible nature. Nevertheless, it is not necessarily the experimental data (Baconian orgy of quantification) but rather the diversity/plurality of ideas in a scientific discipline that contributes toward a better understanding of the evolving nature of objectivity. In essence, the pluralist approach dissolves the distinction between the epistemic and the social (Longino, 1990) and thus helps to correct flaws and enhance the reliability of scientific results. Although within Marxism the influence of social factors is important, instead in Mainland China Mao's concept of \"practice\" is highly valued. The role of social factors and the scientific community is important and at times objectivity may become synonymous with consensus. History of science, however, shows that there is no guarantee that the scientific community is infallible (cf. Rowlands, Graham, & Berry, 2011) .

The knowledge that has already been acquired allows the researchers to raise new questions because there is uncertainty in existing knowledge. The dynamics of uncertainty and raising new questions helps to facilitate greater understanding. Based on Piaget's genetic epistemology, constructivism emphasizes the inherent uncertainty of the constructed knowledge of the world by both children and scientists.

This is a controversial thesis and perhaps many science educators may consider it to be too radical and extreme. Nevertheless, let us reconsider the results reported in this book in order to have a better perspective. Chap. 6 showed that almost 90% of general chemistry textbook authors (published in USA) did not recognize the problematic nature of objectivity and again about half endorsed the traditional step-wise scientific method. About one-third of the authors of articles written by science education researchers (Chaps. 3-5) did not recognize the problematic nature of objectivity. Given this state of affairs and perhaps with some reluctance, I would like to endorse Aikenhead's (2008) thesis, namely \"objectivity as an opiate of the academic.\" Lest it be misconstrued, my objective (as part of the science education community) in raising this issue is that of a constructive criticism and a call for a critical appraisal of how we do and understand science, while trying to grasp the evolving nature of objectivity. At this stage it is important to note that after reading a preliminary version of this chapter, Aikenhead (personal communication, July 27, 2016) suggested the following: \"It would be interesting to read a parallel chapter to your Chap. 7 from the standpoint of subjectivity. On pages 9-10 you explore the two poles of a continuum. In 1991, I published a grade 10 STS science textbook Logical Reasoning in Science and Technology, in which objectivity was replaced by the notion of degrees of subjectivity. Thus, the value that guides scientists is to reach the lowest level of subjectivity as humanly and financially possible. This stance makes intuitive sense to high school students, and it eliminates many of the issues that arise in Chap. 7 about the problems with objectivity\" (underline added). The notion of \"degrees of subjectivity\" can be compared to what Machamer and Wolters (2004, pp. 9-10) have referred to as \"objectivity comes in degrees.\" In a similar vein Daston and Galison (2007, p. 374 ) have pointed out that, \"subjectivity is not a weakness of the self, [but rather] it is the self.\" For a science educator it is important to understand that the notions of subjectivity and objectivity are intricately intertwined and it is the constant struggle between these two poles of a continuum that facilitates progress in science.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 116, "end": 132, "text": "Aikenhead (2008)", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 1069, "end": 1087, "text": "Aikenhead's (2008)", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 2284, "end": 2321, "text": "Machamer and Wolters (2004, pp. 9-10)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2392, "end": 2424, "text": "Daston and Galison (2007, p. 374", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Is Objectivity an Opiate of the Academic?"}, {"text": "Finally, it is concluded that the evolving nature of objectivity is important for science education as school and college science generally simplify complex historical episodes under the rubric of objectivity without really understanding that the underlying issues perhaps are dependent on trained judgment (Daston & Galison, 2007) .

Similarly, Aikenhead and Michell (2011) have endorsed a similar approach: \"Consensus making reduces the subjectivity of individual scientists or teams of scientists. Consequently, a realistic goal for scientists is low subjectivity. The public storyline that scientists attain objectivity is a myth \u2026. The ideal of objectivity fails in the reality of practice \u2026. Nevertheless, objectivity remains a powerful and useful ideal\" (p. 41, underline added). Despite a critical stance toward the role played by objectivity, it is important to note that scholars of different disciplines and persuasion still consider it to be a useful epistemic virtue (e.g., Aikenhead, Daston, Galison, Harding, Hodson, Hoffmann, & Machamer) .
