Both H7N9 A/Guangdong/GH074/2013 (GH074) isolated from a patient, and A/chicken/Guangdong/G1/2013 (G1) isolated from healthy chickens at an LPM were studied. The human-origin H10N8 JX346 and H7N9 GH074 isolates replicated more efficiently in both MDCK and HEK293T cells, as compared with their respective avian-origin viruses, showing a significantly higher titer at each investigated time point (Fig. 1a). The control H9N2 V strain had an intermediate degree of replication, growing to a higher titer than the avian-origin viruses and a lower titer than the human-origin viruses. In avian DF1 cells, both human H10N8 JX346 and H7N9 GH074 viruses also grew to a higher titer than their respective avian-origin viruses and the control H9N2 virus at some time points (Fig. 1a). We intranasally infected 4 to 6-week-old female BALB/c mice with 106 EID50 of each virus. Mice infected with JX346, GH074, or the lethal V virus showed symptoms of illness and weight loss starting from 2 days post-infection (d.p.i). Mice infected with avian-origin G1 or JX102 viruses did not display obvious clinical symptoms and weight loss, although mice infected with JX102 showed a slight weight loss (<5%) around 7 d.p.i. and then recovered (Fig. 1b, left). Two human-origin JX346 and GH074 viruses and the avian-origin V virus caused 100% case fatality rate in mice. However, all mice infected with JX346 died on 5 d.p.i., whereas animals infected the other 2 viruses showed a delayed fatality (after 7 or 8 d.p.i) (Fig. 1b, right). All 5 tested viruses replicated efficiently in the lungs of infected mice by 3 and 5 d.p.i. The human-origin H10N8, JX346, and H7N9 GH074 viruses grew to a significantly higher titer in mouse lungs when compared to their respective avian-origin JX102 and G1 viruses at both indicated time points (Fig. 1c, left). The control H9N2 V strain grew to a similar titer in mouse lungs as compared with the human-origin viruses. Our previous study showed that the H9N2 V virus is able to replicate in mouse brains36. We detected JX346 in the brains of infected mice at both early and late time points (2/3 mice in 3 d.p.i and 1/3 mice in 5 d.p.i.), by contrast to the H9N2 V virus. No virus was found in mouse brains infected with the avian-origin JX102 or both human- and avian-origin H7N9 viruses (Fig. 1c, right). Additionally, virus isolation was performed for tissue samples including kidney, liver and spleen collected from mice infected with the H7N9, H10N8 or H9N2 viruses. No virus was detected in these tissues (data not shown), indicating that the fatal H7N9, H10N8 and H9N2 viruses did not induce a systematic infection which is often observed with H5N1 influenza viruses37. Thus, both human-origin H10N8 JX346 and H7N9 GH074 viruses replicate more efficiently than their respective avian-origin viruses, and are lethal to mice without prior adaptation.",

To identify the genes that contribute to efficient replication and virulence of the human-origin JX346 H10N8 virus in mammalian hosts, a reverse genetic system for both JX346 and JX102 was developed and six recombinant viruses in the genetic background of the JX346 (or the JX102) with a single gene (PB2, PB1, NP, HA, NA or NS) from the JX102 (or the JX346) were generated and tested in mice. Eight mice of each group were intranasally infected with 106 EID50 of the indicated viruses. The recombinant virus JX102-JX346PB2 containing the JX346-derived PB2 gene was virulent in mice, inducing severe weight loss (Fig. 2a) and 100% mortality, as compared with the rescued parental rJX102 and other 5 recombinant viruses (Fig. 2b). The JX102-JX346PB2 virus titer in mouse lungs was significantly higher than that of the parental rJX102 virus at 5 d.p.i (P < 0.05) (Table S1). The virus was only detected in mouse brains infected with this virus, not with the parental rJX102 or other 5 recombinant viruses (Table S1). Conversely, the recombinant virus JX346-JX102 PB2 containing the JX102-derived PB2 gene was attenuated in mice, inducing only a slight weight loss and no case fatality rate (Fig. 2c) when compared to the rescued parental rJX346 and other 5 recombinant viruses with a single gene from the JX102 virus (Fig. 2d). The JX346-JX102 PB2 virus titer in mouse lungs was significantly lower than that of the parental virus rJX346 and other 5 recombinant viruses with a single gene from the JX102 virus at both 3 and 5 d.p.i. (P < 0.01) (Table S1). No virus was detected in mouse brains infected with the recombinant virus JX346-JX102 PB2, whereas virus was found in the brains of mice infected with the parental virus rJX346 and other 5 recombinant viruses with a single gene from the JX102 virus at both 3 and 5 d.p.i. (Table S1). These results indicated that the PB2 gene is responsible for virulence and neural tropism of the human-origin H10N8 virus in mice.",

The amino acids at the eleven positions in both human-origin and avian-origin H7N9 and control H9N2 viruses were also compared (Table 1). PB2 627K, a well-characterized mammalian adaptation marker2225, was present in all lethal strains tested in this study. To determine whether PB2 627K or other residues were responsible for the virulence of the human-origin H10N8 virus, two mutated virus with a single substitution in PB2 JX346-PB2 627E and JX102-PB2 627K were generated and tested in mice. As expected, the JX102-PB2 627K exhibited enhanced virulence, resulting in 100% case fatality rate and higher virus lung titers, as compared with the parental virus JX102 (Table 2). Furthermore, the virus was also detected in the brain of the infected mice (Table 2). However, unexpectedly, the mutated virus JX346-PB2 627E was still highly virulent, causing 100% case fatality rate and replicating efficiently in mouse lungs, similar to the parental virus JX346 although no virus could be detected in the brains (Table 2). To test whether 627E mutated to 627K in PB2, we sequenced the JX346-PB2 627E virus after replication in mice and found amino acid in position 627 of PB2 was still glutamate (Data not shown). Thus, lysine at position 627 (627K) is important but is not the only key determinant for virulence of the human-origin H10N8 virus.",

Moreover, the results of mini-genome assays in HEK293T cells and DF1 cells showed that the polymerase activity was significantly enhanced due to introduction of PB2 A588V substitution into the JX102 PB2 when compared to the parental JX102-PB2 (Fig. 4a,b). Therefore, we investigated the effects of 588A/V in PB2 on H10N8 virus replication and virulence. We generated the single mutants JX346-PB2 588A, JX346-PB2 627E, JX102-PB2 588V, and JX102-PB2 627K and the double mutants JX346-PB2 588A/627E and JX102-PB2 588V/627K viruses in the genetic background of the human-origin JX436 and avian-origin JX102 viruses, respectively. In both MDCK and HEK293T cells, the substitution A588V markedly enhanced virus replication of JX102 and A588V/E627K slightly increased virus replication when compared to the E627K substitution (Fig. 4c,d). In DF1 cells, the mutant JX102-PB2 588V virus also replicated more efficiently than both wild type JX102 and mutant JX102-PB2 627K at later time points (Fig. 4e). By contrast, the PB2 substitution V588A markedly decreased virus replication of JX436 although it was not significant when compared to the substitution K627E and V588A/K627E in both MDCK and HEK293T cells (Fig. 4c,d). In DF-1 cells, three mutant viruses including JX346-PB2 588A, JX346-PB2 627E, and JX346-PB2 588A/627E showed decreased virus replication as compared with the parental JX346 virus, but the JX346-PB2 588A/627E grew to the lowest titer at later time points (Fig. 4e).",

By contrast, the single substitution V588A, similar to K627E in PB2 for the human-origin JX346, had a slight effect on the MLD50 value, virulence, and virus replication in lungs of infected mice (Table 3), but the substitution V588A coupled with K627E in PB2 attenuated the parental JX346 virus, evidenced by a significantly enhanced MLD50 value and no case fatality rate in infected mice (Table 3 and Fig. 5). Moreover, histopathological analysis of the lung tissues showed that mice infected with JX102-PB2 588V, JX102-PB2 627K or JX102-PB2 588V/627K had serious pathological inflammatory injury when compared to those from mice infected with the JX102 virus (Fig. S1).

The substitution A588V in PB2 significantly increased the polymerase activity in both HEK293T and DF1 cells (Fig. 6c) and the mutant V-PB2 588V/627E replicated more efficiently than V-PB2 627E in both MDCK and HEK293T cells, although they exhibited no significant difference in DF1 cells (Fig. 6e). The mutant V-PB2 588V/627E virus was able to cause disease (obvious weight loss) and replicate more efficiently in the lungs of mice than the control V-PB2 627E virus (Fig. 5a), although it did not cause case fatality rate (MLD50 > 106EID50) (Table 3). Taken together, the substitution A588V in PB2 also enhanced the polymerase activity in both human and avian cells and the virulence of avian-origin H7N9 and H9N2 viruses.",

There were four variable amino acids (A, V, T, I) at this position in PB2 and the Alanine (A) was the most common amino acids (Table 4), considered as a conserved residue among avian influenza viruses38. The avian H9N2 isolates possessing a residue 588V occupied just a small fraction (4.3%) prior to 2012, but increased to 21.9% since 2013 in which the first human case infected with the H7N9 virus occurred. Human-origin H7N9 viruses encoding PB2 588V were increased from 0% in 2013 to 24.2% (8/33) in 2014 (Table 4) despite few (1.9%) avian-origin H7N9 virus encoding PB2 588V. The PB2 of one human H9N2 isolate A/Lengshuitan/11197/2013 also encodes 588V (while encoding 627E in PB2)39. In addition, there were 38.1% avian-origin H10N8 viruses that encode 588V in PB2 and 100% of human-origin H10N8 viruses encoding 588V in PB2. Among the human isolates bearing 588V in PB2, we found that 75% (6/8) of H7N9 and 66.6% (2/3) of H10N8 viruses contain both PB2 588V and 627K. These data indicate that H7N9, H10N8, and H9N2 subtype viruses encoding 588V in PB2 have increased in abundance since the first identification of human infections in 2013.",

A recent study has shown that the internal genes PB2, M, and NP from the endemic H9N2 virus111243 contribute to the high infectivity of the H7N9 virus in humans32. Our studies here also indicate that PB2 is the key virulence determinant for the human H10N8 JX346 and H7N9 G1 viruses. It should be noted that the PB2 of JX346 originates from local endemic H9N2 viruses circulating in chickens, whereas the PB2 of the chicken-origin H10N8 JX102 virus is derived from the H7 virus in ducks12. Replacement with the JX102 PB2 resulted in avirulence of JX346, highlighting that PB2 of the currently circulating H9N2 viruses is important for the emergence of novel zoonotic influenza viruses such as H7N9 and H10N8. Furthermore, recent studies revealed that circulating H7N9 viruses still continue to reassort with endemic H9N2 and other subtype influenza viruses, leading to different genetic linages4445. Therefore, the mammalian adapted PB2 from the H10N8 or H9N2 viruses could be transmitted to other subtype viruses such as H5N1 and H6N6 through reassortment, resulting in zoonotic viruses that might cause epidemics and potential pandemics in humans.",

These substitutions were also confirmed to be important for novel H7N9 influenza virus to adapt mammalian hosts3435. In our study, besides 627K, six residues 87E, 292V, 340K, 588V, 648V, and 676M in PB2 contributed to the high virulence of the human H10N8 JX346 virus in mice. Interestingly, among these residues only V292I and V588A substitutions resulted in a significantly lower polymerase activity in human cells (Fig. 3); however, whether or not their virulence correlates with the polymerase activity remains unclear and needs to be investigated in future research. Importantly, the residues 292V, 648V, and 676M in PB2 exist in currently circulating H9N2 and H7N9 viruses47. Noticeably, the amino acid 292V/I has been shown to be conserved in human and avian isolates48, therefore, 292V might be another important residue for mammalian adaptation of avian influenza viruses. Moreover, some amino acid changes in PA have been demonstrated to affect the replication and virulence of H7N9 virus in mammals49. Our studies also demonstrate that some amino acid changes in PB2 are important for the virulence of avian influenza viruses including H10N8 virus in mammalian host. These data suggest that the evolutionary changes in PB2 of H9N2 or H7N9 viruses may facilitate virus mammalian host adaptation and enhance virus replication and transmission in mammals.",

Furthermore, no virus was detected from brains of mice infected with H10N8 JX346 mutant viruses which have 627E/588V in the PB2.

Residues 590 and 591 located in this domain are a key adaptive strategy of the 2009 pandemic H1N1 influenza virus in humans55. Here we showed that residue 588V, located in the PB2 627-domain near the polymorphic 590 and 591 residues, is important for H7N9 and H10N8 virus replication and virulence. Additionally, previous studies had reported that the mutation T588I or A588T in PB2 could enhance the virulence of 2009 pandemic H1N1 influenza virus56 or H5N1 avian influenza virus31. In our study, the mutation A588V in PB2 enhanced the virulence of avian H7N9, H10N8, and H9N2 influenza viruses. Together, these data indicate the importance of the 588 position in PB2 for polymerase activity, replication, and virulence of different subtypes of avian influenza viruses in mammals, suggesting that it is another mammalian adaption marker for avian influenza viruses. However, when introduced the PB2 588A into JX346 virus (encoding PB2 627K) has a minor effect in the virulence (Table 3), it may indicate that the virulence factors of influenza virus are complex and the high virulence may be the outcome of the action of multiple amino acids in the viral proteins. It is interesting that the PB2-588V also enhanced the viral replication and polymerase activity in DF1 cells (Figs 4 and 6); however, in vitro results may not represent virus biological features such as virulence in vivo.",

This phenomenon was also observed in other human H7N9 isolates such as A/Anhui/1/2013 and A/Shanghai/2/2013 that have PB2 588A/627K reported in a previous study61. It should also be noticed that the H7N9 A/Shanghai/1/2013 virus bearing PB2 588A/627K in the previous study showed high virulence, similar to the H7N9 GH074 virus used in our study (Fig. 1). These data indicate that i) the effect of the PB2 627K on influenza viruses may be strain-dependent, similar to data previously reported with H5N162; ii) the PB2 627K mutation is not the only key factor for mammalian adaption of the novel H7N9 influenza virus and other adaptive strategies to mammalian hosts may be employed for this virus (many adaption mutations already exist in this virus47), such as the A588V identified in our study. The G1-PB2 588V showed more enhanced virulence than the G1-PB2 627K in mice although both viruses displayed similar growth dynamics in tested cell lines, indicating that enhanced virulence might not always correlate with better virus replication and increased polymerase activity in cell cultures. Host immune responses or other pathological factors are also important for the virulence besides virus replication capacity as reported in the previous study24.",
