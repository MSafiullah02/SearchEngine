            "text": "The aim of this study was to identify the receptor(s) for PRRSV on porcine alveolar macrophages (PAMs) by producing monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) against these cells. Hybridoma supernatants were selected for their ability to block PRRSV infection. Four MAbs, 1-8D2, 9.4C7, 9.9F2, and 3-3H2 inhibited infection and recognised cell surface, PAM-specific antigens as shown by immunofluorescence and immunoperoxidase monolayer assay. These MAbs were then used to identify cellular proteins involved in PRRSV infection by radioimmunoprecipitation assays (RIPAs). MAbs 1-8D2 and 9.9F2 each recognised a 150 kDa-polypeptide doublet, while MAbs 9.4C7 and 3-3H2 both recognised a 220 kDa-polypeptide. Glycosidase treatment demonstrated all these polypeptides to be N-glycosylated. Thus, multiple glycoproteins appear to be involved in infection of PAMs by PRRSV. * Porcine respiratory and reproductive syndrome virus (PRRSV) is an enveloped, positive stranded RNA virus and a member of the Arteriviridae family. Other members of this family are Equine arteritis virus (EAV), Lactate dehydrogenaseelevating virus (LDV) and Simian haemorrhagic fever virus (SHFV) [1, 14] . PRRSV has a highly restricted tropism for macrophages, particularly for porcine alveolar macrophages (PAMs), both in vivo and in vitro [17] . Recently, PRRSV was also shown to replicate in testicular germ cells [19] . The only non-porcine cells known to support PRRSV replication are the African green monkey kidney",

Likewise, we set out to generate infection-inhibiting MAbs that would allow us to characterise these proteins. To that end, two fusions were carried out with spleen cells from BALB/c mice that had been immunised with PAMs [9] . In addition, four fusions were performed with spleen cells from BALB/c mice that had been tolerised to porcine bone marrow cells prior to immunisation with PAMs [13] . Thus, we aimed at increasing the chances of obtaining MAbs inhibiting PRRSV infection since bone marrow cells are not susceptible to PRRSV [8] . A similar approach was used by Duan et al. [5] , except that these authors used peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) to tolerise their mice. Because a small percentage of the PBMCs consists of monocytes that are permissive for PRRSV [22] , we initially selected peritoneal macrophages, a related cell type reported earlier to be non-permissive [7] . In our hands, however, these macrophages appeared to be permissive for PRRSV, unlike bone marrow cells (data not shown).",

For this purpose, the MAbs were purified using protein G sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The large-scale purification of MAb 9.4C7 was omitted for no inhibition was seen (Fig. 3) . The difference in inhibition efficiency between MAbs 3-3H2 and 1-8D2 may be a result of a difference in affinity. The low level of inhibition obtained with MAb 9.9F2 might also be explained by a low affinity for the antigen. CSFV was not inhibited by any of the MAbs at the concentrations used (data not shown). Surprisingly, TGEV infection of PAMs was partially inhibited by MAb 3-3H2, although the inhibition was not as prominent as with PRRSV (data not shown). To investigate the possibility that MAb 3-3H2 recognises the porcine aminopeptidase N (pAPN) protein, the established TGEV receptor [4] , experiments were performed using a cDNA clone encoding the porcine APN (jAP1) and the anti-pAPN antibody G43 (both generously provided by Dr. B. Delmas). It was found that BHK-21 cells transfected with jAP1 could not be immunostained with MAb 3-3H2, indicating that this MAb does not recognise pAPN, unlike MAb G43 that did stain these cells (data not shown). From these data we conclude that MAb 3-3H2 does not recognise pAPN. The inhibition of TGEV infection by MAb 3-3H2 might just be the result of sterical hindrance. Alternatively, TGEV might use a coreceptor for entry into PAMs that is identical to the protein recognised by MAb 3-3H2.",

Therefore, RIPAs were performed with 35 Smethionine labelled lysates of PAMs to define the polypeptide specificities of the MAbs. Similarly labelled lysates of MARC-145 and BHK-21 cells were used as negative controls. Metabolic labelling and immunoprecipitation of proteins were performed essentially as described previously [15] . Immunoprecipitates were analysed by SDS-PAGE using a 5% polyacrylamide gel. As illustrated in Fig. 4 , MAbs 3-3H2 and 9.4C7 both recognised a protein with a relative molecular mass of approximately 220 kDa (Fig. 4A) . In addition, a 210 kDa protein was observed using these MAbs. However, this protein is most likely aspecific, since it was also observed in RIPAs with MAbs 1-8D2 and 9.9F2, and in RIPAs with cell lysates of MARC-145 or BHK-21 cells. Interestingly, MAbs 1-8D2 and 9.9F2 both specifically recognised a protein doublet with a relative molecular mass of approximately 150 kDa (Fig. 4B) . SDS-PAGE analysis under non-reducing conditions also resulted in a doublet of approximately 150 kDa, indicating that the two polypeptides of the 150 kDa doublet are not covalently linked by disulphide bridges (data not shown). Both the 220 kDa protein and the 150 kDa protein doublet are specific for macrophages, as these proteins were not precipitated from cell lysates of MARC-145 or BHK-21 cells. To analyse whether the antigens detected by the MAbs were glycoproteins, and whether the 150 kDa doublet was composed of two identical polypeptide chains that are differently glycosylated, the immunoprecipitates were treated with N-glycosidaseF, which removes N-linked oligosaccharides [15] . As can be seen from Fig. 4 , this treatment indeed caused a shift in mobility of the proteins. After deglycosylation, the apparent molecular mass of the 220-kDa protein was reduced to approximately 200 kDa (Fig. 4A) , whereas that of the 150-kDa protein doublets was reduced to approximately 130 kDa. The 150-kDa protein doublets appeared to be composed of different polypeptide chains, as they remained doublets after deglycosylation (Fig. 4B) . Two major species of 56 kDa, and of 80 kDa were co-immunoprecipitated by MAbs 1-8D2, 3-3H2, 9.4C7, and 9.9F2. To investigate their specificity, RIPAs were carried out with an unrelated antibody directed against the PRRSV nucleocapsid (Fig. 4C) , and with various other PAM-specific antibodies (data not shown).",

These results suggest that the 56 kDa and 80 kDa macrophage proteins nonspecifically coprecipitate with various MAbs. In conclusion, two sets of MAbs were obtained that specifically inhibit PRRSV infection. These two sets have clearly distinguishable antigen recognition patterns as shown by immunohistochemistry. One set, comprising MAbs 3-3H2 and 9.4C7, recognises an approximately 220 kDa N-glycosylated polypeptide, whereas another set, consisting of MAbs 1-8D2 and 9.9F2, recognises a doublet of N-glycosylated polypeptides of approximately 150 kDa. Endoglycosidase treatment showed that the protein moieties of these polypeptides are approximately 200 kDa and 130 kDa, respectively. Since MAbs 1-8D2 and 9.9F2 recognise an epitope that is present in two distinct polypeptides with almost identical relative molecular masses, the two proteins within this doublet are probably related and possibly represent protein isoforms.",

Though its glycosylation was not investigated, this protein most likely corresponds with the 220-kDa N-glycosylated proteins identified in our study. These authors did not detect receptor candidates in the 150-kDasize class. Our results leave us with several intriguing questions to be answered in the future. One obvious issue is the identity of the two sets of glycoproteins that we detected, and their possible relationship. Another issue is their role in PRRSV infection: are they alternative receptors or co-receptors, or do they serve different functions during viral entry. To address these issues, we will clone and sequence the gene(s) for the N-glycosylated proteins in the near future.",

Two other porcine RNA viruses known to infect PAMs were used as control viruses, i.e. transmissible gastro-enteritis virus (TGEV) and classical swine fever virus (CSFV). PAMs were incubated with MAbs 1-8D2, 3-3H2, or 9.9F2 at concentrations ranging from 0.01 to 10 \u00b5g/ml, washed, and subsequently infected with 100 or 300 TCID 50 of TGEV, CSFV, and PRRSV, respectively. MAb 3-3H2 appeared to block PRRSV infection completely at 10 \u00b5g/ml and almost completely at 0.1 \u00b5g/ml, whereas only partial inhibition was observed with MAb 1-8D2 at 10 and 1 \u00b5g/ml. MAb 9.9F2 partly inhibited virus infection at the highest concentration of 10 \u00b5g/ml, whereas at the lower concentrations 182 E. H. J.
