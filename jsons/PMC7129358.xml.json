While associated with immune mediated toxicity, recombinant IL-2 has been being among the most clinically successful agents for the immune treatment inducing long lasting complete response, albeit only in a subset of patients with melanoma and renal cell cancer [1]. With the more recent success of immune checkpoint inhibitors, antibody therapies against cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA-4) and programmed death-1 (PD-1) on T cells, immunotherapy as therapeutic avenue in cancer treatment has finally emerged into mainstream oncology. While anti\u2013CTLA-4 antibodies were the first to be approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of melanoma, antibodies inhibiting the PD-1 receptor or its ligand transformed the treatment paradigms of many solid malignancies.",

The inhibition of CTLA-4 and PD-1 alone or in combination, enhance CD8+ T cell recognition of tumor antigens and achieve durable clinical responses in patients with melanoma [[3], [4], [5]]. T cells specific to tumor-associated antigens (TAA) are rare in the blood and tumors of patients with cancer. Anti\u2013CTLA-4 but not anti\u2013PD-1 treatment amplifies TAA-specific CD8+ T-cells in responding patients with melanoma [6,7].The combination of T-cell checkpoint inhibitors, anti\u2013PD-1 and anti\u2013CTLA-4, revealed a stunning improvement over each therapy alone, with 53% of patients with melanoma receiving the combined regimen experiencing an objective responses [8]. Anti-PD-1 therapies are most efficacious in indications and tumors with a high number of somatic mutations or tumor mutational burden (TMB). High TMB increases the antigenic difference between the tumour and the immunological self (immunogenic tumors). This antigenic difference enables T cell recognition and may lead to a higher number of tumor infiltrating T cells (TIL) [[9], [10], [11]]. In the opposite scenario, immune therapies and immune checkpoint inhibition, tend to have poor response rates in indications or patients with lower mutational burden. Hence additional therapeutic approaches to increase the rare tumor antigen specific T cells in tumors with low TMB are needed.",

            "text": "IL-10 is the founding member of the IL-10 family of cytokines. It is a noncovalent homodimeric alpha helical cytokine with structural similarities to IFN-\u03b3. The IL-10 receptor (IL10R) consists of two molecules of an IL-10\u2013specific alpha chain IL10Ra and two molecules of IL10Rb that is shared with other cytokines. IL10R is expressed on the surface of most hematopoietic cells, including T cells, B cells, and macrophages. IL-10 was identified as a factor produced by Th2-polarized CD4+ T cells, which suppresses the proliferation of CD4+ T cells. In this setting IL-10 inhibits the secretion of cytokines in Th1 helper cells, in particular IL-12 and IFN-\u03b3 [12]. In vitro, IL-10 also reduces the antigen specific stimulation of CD4+ T cell proliferation by monocytes through downregulation of class II major histocompatibility complex (MHC-II) [13]. In contrast, IL-10 induced thymocyte proliferation by elevating the expression of CD3 and CD8 and IL-10 was shown to induce the cytotoxicity of CD8+ T cells [14]. In mouse tumor models, IL-10 increased the expression of IFN\u03b3 in CD8+ T cells, paradoxically leading to increased expression of MHC I and MHC II [15]. Deficiency in IL-10 or IL10R have - in human genetics and mouse models - clarified the nonredundant immunologic properties of the IL-10 pathway for both functions. In support of the anti-inflammatory and tumor-inhibitory function, IL-10\u2013deficient mice and humans develop inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and cancer [[16], [17], [18]].",

            "text": "Understanding of the anti-inflammatory mechanism of IL-10 was early on revealed in a mouse model of endotoxemia. Single or repeated injections of bacterial lipopolysaccharides (LPS) induce an acute cytokine release syndrome (CRS), leading to a vascular shock and death. LPS activates Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), a pattern recognition receptor (PRR) expressed on many myeloid cells. PRRs alert the innate immune system of foreign molecules such as bacterial cell wall constituents or DNA, and of damaged host cells. The stimulation of PRRs is not antigen specific and leads to an inflammatory reaction, largely driven by the innate immune system. However, LPS also induces inflammatory cytokines IL-12/IL-23, which stimulate inflammatory T cells. IL-10 is induced by LPS as a negative feedback and inhibits the expression of the shared p40 subunit of IL-12/IL-23. This is achieved through a transcriptional cascade involving STAT3 and the transcriptional repressor nuclear factor, interleukin 3 regulated (NFIL3), which inhibits the transcription of p40 [[19], [20], [21]]. NFIL3 deficiency causes a microbiota dependent colitis [22]. Due to the absence of this feedback, IL-10\u2212/\u2212 mice are sensitive to the LPS-induced shock, while IL-10 protects the mice from CRS [23,24]. IL-10\u2013activated STAT3 also induces the suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3), which binds and inhibits the proinflammatory IL-6 and IL-12/IL-23 receptors [25]. IL-10 thereby intercepts the inflammatory responses at various levels.",

The local inflammatory reaction to imiquimod indeed serves as a prognostic indicator of treatment success [27]. In the absence of IL-10, the local inflammation is greatly exacerbated. Intratumoral injection of TLR ligands into experimental tumors have enhanced activity when applied in a IL-10-/- mouse or in combination with an IL-10 neutralizing antibody [28]. Systemic applications of TLR agonists, however lead to a life-threatening CRS. Consequently, and due to limiting toxicities, this approach has seen so far little or no success in systemic tumor therapy. Intratumoral injection of the PRR agonist in combination with IL-10 inhibition are pursued.

This anti-inflammatory role of IL-10 was earliest demonstrated in IL-10 knockout mice who spontaneously develop inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)[31]. Removal of commensal intestinal bacteria by antibiotic treatment protected IL-10 -/- mice from colitis [32], and the prevalence and severity of IBD in IL-10-/- mice is attenuated in SPF facilities. The relevance of this finding has been confirmed in patients carrying a somatic mutation in the IL-10 or the IL10R gene, who spontaneously develop severe, very early onset IBD [16]. Importantly, in the presence of this increased systemic inflammation, IL-10 knockout mice (IL-10-/-) spontaneously develop colon cancer [18], while patients deficient in IL-10 signaling develop lymphomas within the first decade of life [17]. It is not clear why mice do not develop lymphomas, or if IL-10R deficient patients would develop colon cancer with increased age. This difference in tumor type could arise from the difference in the duration of inflammation until tumor incidence, the anti-inflammatory medication in IL-10 deficient patients which may prevent the development of colon carcinomas in human, or a difference in the microbiota that modifies the organ specific cancer risk. In general, inflammation arising due to IL-10 deficiency may provide a fertile ground for tumor development and support the concept of tumor-promoting inflammation.",

While the rational for inflammation control or immune effector modification is supported by both preclinical mechanistic data and clinical correlations, it has not been explored clinically as aggressively as immune stimulatory therapies. The use of tocilizumab (anti-IL-6) to control immune mediated adverse events of immune checkpoint inhibitors, appears to be clinically safe and not inhibit anti-tumor immune function [48].

IL-10 enhanced the proliferation of CD8+ T cells after direct stimulation of the T-cell receptor (TCR) signaling using anti-CD3 monoclonal antibodies (mAb). In addition, IL-10 induced the proliferation of CD8+ T cells stimulated with anti-CD3 mAbs in the absence of exogenous IL-2 [50].

Moreover, autocrine IL-10, produced by dendritic cells did not inhibit DC maturation and priming to high affinity antigens, but lowered priming to low affinity antigens, potentially through reducing MHC I and CD86 expression. Reducing antigen stimulation by 50% may restrict the T cell response to a more mature immune response [53,54]. In addition, IL-10 enhanced the IL-15 induced TCR-independent proliferation of memory cytotoxic T cells. By selectively increasing the sensitivity of high-affinity CD8+ T cells to IL-15, IL-10 may increase the prevalence of antigen activated CTL. Conversely, IL-10 inhibition may broaden the immune response by reducing antigen restriction. This could lead to a widened CD8+ T cell repertoire, at the expense of TCR high affinity selection.",

Sustained treatment with PEG-IL-10 led to the CD8+ T-cell\u2013dependent tumor rejection in a variety of rather immune resistant mouse tumor models and eliminated lung metastasis in aggressive transplanted tumor models. Most strikingly PEG-IL-10 induces rejection of large endogenous breast cancers in Her2 transgenic mice. This is of particular interest, as tumors induced by a transgenic oncogenic driver mutations typically harbor a reduced frequency of somatic mutations and have therefore an increased resistance to immune therapies. Tumor rejection induced by PEG-IL-10 treatment led to a durable immune memory against the rejected tumors, with mice remaining resistant to tumor challenge, tested up to 8 months after the initial tumor rejection. IL-10 receptor ablation studies indicated that tumor immunity is mediated directly through activation of intratumoral CD8+ T cells by IL-10, while IL-10R expression on other cells was dispensable for tumor control [51].",

Also in the presence of intratumoral IFN-\u03b3 produced by CD8+ T cells, both MHC class I and II molecules were induced, potentially allowing increased antigen presentation and recognition within the tumor [70] (Fig. 1b). Supporting this concept, analysis of antigen recognition and the expansion of tumor specific CD8+ T cells in syngeneic mouse tumor models revealed that PEG-IL-10 increased the number of T cells which recognized the tumor cells from the tumors they were isolated from, but not MHC matched control cells. Interestingly, this increase of tumor specific CD8+ T cells was observed equally in T cells, isolated from the tumor and in the blood of PEG-IL-10 treated animals, suggesting that the IL-10 induced tumor reactive T cells circulate through the lymphatic and the blood [15]. Proliferation of tumor-directed T cells generally is thought to occur in the tumor-draining lymph node, with the post proliferative T cells returning to the tumor through the blood stream. However inhibition of lymphatic migration with an S1P inhibitor during the treatment with IL-10 did not reduce tumor efficacy or the increase of intratumoral CD8+ T cells, suggesting that intratumoral T cell activation and expansion was sufficient to induce tumor rejection in response to IL-10 treatment [51]. IL-10 dependence of intratumoral T cell expansion was further tested by adoptive transfer of IL10R+ and IL10R\u2212 T cells into tumor bearing T cell deficient (Rag-/-) mice. During IL-10 treatment, IL10R-expressing tumor-resident CD8+ T cells rapidly expanded within the tumor tissue, at the expense of T cells not carrying the IL-10 receptor [51].",

Accordingly, clinical trials with recombinant IL-10 were initiated in the nineties with the intend to suppress inflammation in chronic inflammatory diseases. More than five thousand individuals, normal healthy volunteers and patients with inflammatory disease were treated predominantly by subcutaneous injections of recombinant IL-10 [73]. These clinical trials were conducted before a detailed understanding of the molecular and cellular mechanism of IL-10\u2032s anti-inflammatory function was established, biomarker analysis was in its infancy and it was therefore difficult to optimize the treatment. Moreover, the pharmacologic characteristics of the recombinant IL-10 limited the exposure to several hours after each subcutaneous injection. Disease-associated proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, IL-12, and IL-17 were reduced significantly, indicating a pharmacodynamic activity of the treatment [74]. The suppression of IL-1 and TNF-\u03b1 was detectable only during the short periods of elevated serum concentration of IL-10, returning to high values within 24 h after the IL-10 injection [75]. Nevertheless, encouraging efficacy of IL-10 was observed in psoriasis and Crohn disease [73]. In patients with interferon refractory chronic hepatitis C, IL-10 reduced liver inflammation and fibrosis [76]. However, in pivotal trials, frequently using reduced, three-times-weekly dosing regimen to avoid side effects, statistically significant disease modification has not been observed. Taken together, the variable concentration of IL-10 due to the short half-life of recombinant IL-10 in patients may have severely limited the therapeutic benefit.",

            "text": "The Phase 1 study enrolled patients with advanced solid tumors, which had failed all available prior therapies, including prior immune therapies with IL-2, anti-CTLA4 (ipilimumab) or anti-PD-1. Objective tumor responses were measured using immune related response criteria (irRC) [82]. Patients were allowed to interrupt dosing for brief intermissions for unrelated or related adverse events but could resume treatment until tumor progression or dose limiting toxicity (DLT). Pegilodecakin (AM0010) was well tolerated at escalating doses from 1\u03bcg/kg to 40\u03bcg/kg. This resulted in a sustained, meaningfully elevated serum concentration of IL-10 between 1 and 40 ng/ml [81], since the half maximal effective concentration (EC50) of pegilodecakin in cell-based in vitro assays was approximately 8 ng/mL and the serum concentration of IL-10 in cancer patients prior to dosing averaged at 3 pg/mL [52]. The DLT was not determined and adverse events (AE) included anemia, thrombocytopenia, fever and fatigue, while hypotension or durable auto-immune related adverse events were not recorded. Importantly, adverse events were transient, residing after short dose interruptions [81]. This allowed for patients with cytopenias and sustained tumor responses to continue treatment after short treatment interruption for several months and up to 2 years. The adverse event profile distinguishes pegilodecakin therapy from IL-2, were severe hypotension is dose and duration of treatment limiting despite the well-established clinical benefit of high-dose IL-2 treatment [1]. Confirming the anti-inflammatory function of IL-10, immune related, inflammatory adverse events (irAEs), such as colitis, pneumonitis or hepatitis were not observed. This differentiates IL-10 treatment also from immune checkpoint inhibitor therapies, which frequently induce irAEs but rarely cause transient cytopenias [83]. Pegilodecakin treated patients had systemic upregulation of immune stimulatory cytokines, such as IFN\u03b3, IL-4 and IL-18, but reduced concentrations of the immune suppressive TGF\u03b2, supporting the hypothesis that pharmacologically stabilized IL-10 may increase T cell activation in patients (see also chapter 5.5 for immune regulation in patients).",

In recent years, anti-PD-1 antibodies were approved by the FDA as first line treatment alone or in various combinations for the treatment of melanoma, RCC, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and other indications [5,[86], [87], [88]]. Treatment of melanoma patients with pembrolizumab induced objective clinical responses in 38% in phase 1 [4]. Clinical responses were predominantly observed in patients whose tumors had prior to therapy a strong infiltration of CD8+ T cells [9], suggesting that the pre-existing immunity is required for the clinical success of anti-PD-1. Intriguingly, the response to anti-PD-1 is correlated with a high burden of somatic mutations in NSCLC patients tumor [10] and the responsiveness of different tumor histologies correlates generally with the frequency of somatic mutations in the tumor type [11]. Preclinical data indicated that pegilodecakin increased the frequency and activity of tumor infiltrating CD8+ T cells in poorly infiltrated tumors. CD8+ T cell mediated tumor responses were also observed in endogenous tumors in a Her2 transgenic tumor model, which generally have a strongly reduced number of somatic mutations and accordingly a low infiltration by T cells [15,51]. Moreover, patients on Pegilodecakin monotherapy had an increase in the number of activated, tumor infiltrating CD8+ T cells in tumors with low T cell infiltration prior to therapy [52].",

Exhausted CD4+ T cells in HIV patients have increased expression of both, PD-1 and IL-10Ra, suggesting that T cells exhausted during continuous antigen stimulation may be the primary target for both therapies. This raised the possibility that stimulation of the IL-10 pathway and inhibition of PD-1 may lead to improved clinical responses. In this scenario, pegilodecakin may increase the number of tumor infiltrating, antigen specific T cells and anti-PD-1 would restore TCR activity. To test this concept cohorts of patients with treatment refractory, advanced RCC or non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) were enrolled to receive a combination of pegilodecakin plus one of two PD-1 inhibitory antibodies (pembrolizumab or nivolumab). In NSCLC patients the combination of pegilodecakin plus anti-PD-1 had an objective response rate of 43% and a progression free survival (PFS) of 9.4 months. The median overall survival (OS) of NSCLC patients on pegilodecakin plus anti-PD-1 was 24.1 months. In a similar population pembrolizumab monotherapy, had an ORR of 19.4%, PFS of 3.7 months and overall survival (OS) of 12 months [90]. The response of NSCLC to anti-PD-1 correlates with the expression of PD-L1 in tumor cells, with tumors expressing PD-L1 in more than half of the tumor cells (PD-L1hi) responding to anti-PD-1 in 45% (ORR), while tumors with no PD-L1 expression show responses in less than 10% of cases [90]. PD-L1hi NSCLCs had an ORR 83% and PD-L1 negative NSCLCs treated with pegilodecakin plus anti-PD-1 had objective responses in 33% and a PFS of 11 months. [91].",

IL-17, TGF\u03b2 and TNF\u03b1 were consistently, but only partially suppressed. In contrast, IFN\u03b3 and T cell derived cytotoxic effector molecule, including FasL, LymphotoxinB were strongly induced [81]. IFN\u03b3 started to increase in the serum with a delay, increasing after 7 days of continuous pegilodecakin treatment. Thereafter, IFN\u03b3 is elevated throughout the pegilodecakin dosing period at least for several months, as data from cancer patients indicate [52]. However, the levels of IFN\u03b3 remained relatively low (below 10 pg/mL) and a cytokine release syndrome was not observed. In comparison, patients treated with i.v. bolus of recombinant IL-12 have a transient rise in serum IFN\u03b3 up to 1600 pg/mL [93] and patients on antibody-coupled NHS-IL-12 had spikes of IFN\u03b3 up to 20 ng/mL [94]. Pegilodecakin also induced sustained elevation of IL-18. IL-18 induction correlated directly with the tumor reduction in patients (irRC) [52]. IL-18 is both induced by IFN\u03b3, and maintains IFN\u03b3 expression in T cells, potentially through the inhibition of activated induced cell death [95]. In support of an important function of IL-18 in T cell mediated tumor responses, CAR T cells expressing IL-18 in tandem with the chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) have strongly enhanced efficacy in mice [96]. Recombinant IL-18 had been studied in cancer patient at doses up to 1 mg/kg, with 2 partial responses observed 3\u20135 months after a 5 days treatment interval with IL-18 [97]. In a second study in 19 melanoma and RCC patients no responses have been observed [98]. It may be more plausible that IL-18 is not the only key factor mediating tumor responses but represent an important contributing element in the IL-10 mediated tumor response.",

This is in contrast to therapies using IL-2 [100] or pegylated IL-2 [85], which induce transient lymphopenia followed proliferation and expansion of CD4+ T cells and Tregs, CD8+ T cells and NK cells. Rather, on pegilodecakin, the percentage of proliferating PD-1+Lag-3+ CD8+ T cells increased in the peripheral blood. PD-1+ and Lag-3+ CD8+ T cells were also increased in tumor biopsies of treated patients. Antigen recognition upregulates the expression of immune checkpoints, thereby indicating an activated state of the T cell. However, the increase of multiple immune inhibitory receptors, in particular the upregulation of Tim-3 on non-proliferating T cells indicates functional exhaustion [101]. Therapy induced proliferation of such immune checkpoint positive T cells is reminiscent of the reinvigoration of exhausted - immune checkpoint expressing CD8+ T cells on anti-PD-1 and immune checkpoint inhibitors [102]. Transient proliferation and expansion of PD-1+ CD8+ T cells has been observed in melanoma patients on anti-PD-1 and the ratio of proliferation to tumor burden correlated with anti-tumor response [103]. However, the anti-PD-1 induced invigoration was transient in patients, with anti-PD-1 induced proliferation occurring only within the first month of treatment [104]. On pegilodakin treatment, PD-1+Lag-3+ CD8+ T cells continued to expand in the blood of patients with continued treatment and the expansion correlated directly with the improved tumor response [52]. Also, the more exhausted PD-1+ Lag-3+ Tim-3+ CD8+ T cell population was not increased on pegilodecakin [52]. TCR stimulation simultaneously upregulates immune checkpoints and the expression of IL-10 receptors, providing a plausible explanation for the selective rescue of this population in pegilodecakin treated patients.-Pegilodecakin Induced Clonal T cell Expansion\n",

IL-10 induced stimulation of T cell derived IFN\u03b3 appeared to overcome a suppressive effect of IL-10 on MHC expression, both in mice and in humans. In contrast to other therapeutic modalities, IL-10 appears to induce the key immunostimulatory cytokine IFN-\u03b3 only in CD8+ T cells, strictly dependent upon antigen-stimulated TCR signaling. IL-10 may also skew the T cells toward clones recognizing high affinity antigens, excluding bystander clones.

This localized IFN\u03b3 release, leads to MHC I and MHC II upregulation in the tumor and enables tumor centric priming of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. C). Pegilodecakin induces directly IFN\u03b3, Granzyme and FasL expression in antigen activated CD8+ T cells, facilitating the upregulation of MHC I on the tumor cell and induction of tumor cell killing.",

Pegilodecakin selects preferentially CD8+ T cells, which had a recent antigen encounter - by virtue of their IL-10Rahi status. IL-10 signaling leads to increased activation, survival and expansion of these TAA reactive CD8+ T cells. In contrast, IL-2 or IL-15, induce proliferation and activation of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells independent of a TCR signal and NK cells. This leads to the activation and proliferation of a large proportion of all peripheral T cells, irrespective of antigen specificity.",
