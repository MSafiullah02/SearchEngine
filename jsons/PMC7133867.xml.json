A probable case is an individual meeting criteria for a suspected case along with radiographic features of pneumonia or respiratory distress syndrome, showing positive for SARS coronavirus in one or more assays, or having an unexplained respiratory illness resulting in death, with autopsy results demonstrating the pathology of respiratory distress syndrome without an identifiable cause [2]. As of August 7, 2003, probable SARS cases had been reported in 30 countries (32 areas), involving 8422 individuals, and causing 916 deaths [4].

Unilateral and bilateral pulmonary infiltrates on chest radiography at admission were observed in 46% and 29% of SARS patients, respectively [5]. The differential diagnosis of pulmonary infiltrates is extensive in lung cancer patients with fever, including bacterial infection, opportunistic infection, pulmonary hemorrhage, lymphangitic carcinomatosis, pulmonary embolism, pulmonary edema, chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy-induced lung injury, and leukoagglutinin transfusion reactions [7]. It is difficult to use the chest roentgenogram alone for the differential diagnosis of lung cancer with or without SARS infection. Among the diagnoses that require differentiation, chemotherapy-induced febrile neutropenia, chemotherapy-induced interstitial pneumonitis, radiation penumonitis, and obstructive pneumonitis, were most commonly encountered (Table 3\n). The patient\u2019s clinical history (treatment-related or SARS contact history), the temporal relationship between the different signs and symptoms, laboratory data, and image findings are all needed for the differential diagnosis (Table 3) [8], [9], [10], [11], [12].",

Consideration should be given to outpatient clinical treatment instead of hospitalization, changing the weekly treatment to treatment every 3 or 4 weeks, and changing from intravenous chemotherapy to an oral form of treatment, to avoid frequent hospital visits. Routine use of influenza vaccine is also recommended for these immunocompromised cancer patients as a way to help the patients and avoid the need to differentiate between a diagnosis of SARS and influenza infection. Patients should always bring a brief medical summary with the diagnosis, the treatment given, and the date of treatment; to avoid being mistaken as a SARS patient. Furthermore, in the future, other new, as yet undiscovered, respiratory pathogens that may cause problems similar to or worse than SARS, and the lessons learned from differentiation between SARS and lung cancer patients receiving chemotherapy could be applied to that situation.",
