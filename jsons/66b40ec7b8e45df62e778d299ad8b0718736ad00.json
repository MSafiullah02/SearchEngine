At the two time points, group A rotavirus was detected in 8.6% and 16.2% of the adolescents and 5.2% and 17.2% of the adults, respectively. Reverse transcription-PCR with consensus primers followed by multiplex genotyping PCR detected common strains G1P[8], G2P[4], G3P[8], and G4P[8] in a total of 53.1% of the samples from 1993 to 1996, while the only prevalent strain identified in 2004-2007 was G2P[4] (23.5% of total). Uncommon rotavirus strains (G1P[4], G2P[8] G9P[6]/P[4]) increased from 7.8% ( 1993-1996) to 41.2% (2004-2007), while the prevalence of mixed rotavirus infections was high (39%/35%) at both time points. Mixed infections detected by multiplex PCR were confirmed by sequencing two or more individual genotype-specific PCR products of the VP7 and VP4 genes from the same sample. Phylogenetic analysis of the sequences showed circulation of a heterogeneous rotavirus strain population comprising genotypes G1 (lineages I and IIb), G2 (lineages I and IIb), G4 (lineage Ia), P[4] (lineages P[4]-5 and P[4]-1), P[8] (lineages P[8]-II and P[8]-III), and P[6] (M37-like lineage). The VP6 gene sequences of the nontypeable strains were most homologous to animal strains. This study documents the molecular epidemiology of rotavirus strains in adolescents and adults in India, and suggests that it may be important to monitor these strains over time for the potential impact on rotavirus vaccines under development for use in the Indian population.",

Group A rotaviruses infect all children in their first few years of life and account for the vast majority of rotavirus infections worldwide, while B and C rotaviruses are often found to be associated with outbreaks and sporadic cases. Morphologically, rotavirus is an icosahedral particle consisting of 11 segments of double stranded (ds) RNA encased within a triple layered capsid composed of VP4, VP6, and VP7 proteins. The VP6 protein carries antigens that determine group and subgroup specificities, while VP4 (P-protease sensitive) and VP7 (G-glycoprotein), the outer layer proteins carry epitopes for specific neutralizing antibodies and define different serotypes [Estes and Kapikian, 2007] . The two serotype antigens are encoded by separate genome segments that segregate independently of one another during mixed infections in vivo. As a result, a dual classification system to track both serotypes VP7 (G) and VP4 (P) serotypes has been established for rotaviruses.",

Reassortment in vivo among rotaviruses of the known genotypes has led to the isolation of strains with more than 50 different G-P combinations. However, only the five most common types (G1-G4, P[8]) have been targeted in rotavirus vaccines. Countries considering use of these vaccines conduct surveillance to identify the most common strains in circulation so that subsequent impact of vaccines on circulating strains can be assessed.

The rotavirus strains that remained nontypeable (in this protocol) were subjected to one step RT-PCR (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) using following sets of primers: 9Con1-L/VP7-Rdeg [Freeman et al., 2008] and Con 3 5 0 -TGG CTT CGC TCA TTT ATA GAC A-3 0 /Con 2 provided by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, USA [Gentsch et al., 1992] . Briefly, 4 ml of extracted rotavirus ds RNA was used for RT by denaturing at 958C for 5 min and then chilling in ice for 2 min. A reaction mix of 46 ml containing 5\u00c2 buffer, dNTPs, Rnase-free water, primers 9Con1-L/ Con3 and VP7-Rdeg/Con2 and 2 ml of enzyme mix was added to make a final volume of 50 ml.

Age distribution analysis showed that most rotavirus infections occurred in the 10-14 years age group for adolescents and in the 19-40 years group of adults (Fig. 1) . Significantly higher prevalence of rotavirus was observed during 2007 for adults (P < 0.01) but not for adolescents (P > 0.05; Fig. 2 Genotyping VP7 and VP4 typing was conducted for all 118 rotavirus positive samples from adolescent (n \u00bc 21) and adult (n \u00bc 97) cases of acute gastroenteritis. Both genes were successfully genotyped in 86.7% and 85% of the specimens, respectively, during 1993-1996 but only 50% and 37.8% of the specimens could be typed in [2004] [2005] [2006] [2007] . Though the number of nontypeable rotavirus strains was higher in 2004-2007 for both groups of patients, it was not statistically different from that of the 1993-1996 (P > 0.05; Table II) .",

            "text": "The occurrence of rotavirus infections was noted throughout the year with increased rotavirus activity in the winter (November-February) and rainy (June-August) months (Fig. 3) . This is distinct from seasonal rotavirus infections in temperate climates [Cook et al., 1990] , but similar to previous studies reporting a lack of seasonality with a deviation of infections towards warmer months in children and adults from tropical countries [Maldonado and Yolken, 1990; Carraro et al., 2008] . In the study presented here, the contribution of common G-P types and mixed infections (59/64) to diarrhea was significantly higher than the uncommon types (5/64) in adolescents and adults in 1993-1996 (P < 0.01 by Binomial test, Table III ). Interestingly, this pattern was not retained in 2004-2007 when significantly higher numbers of infections were due to uncommon and mixed types (13/17) (P < 0.05 by Binomial test). While most G-P combinations were of the uncommon variety during 2007, all of the individual G and P genotypes except P[6] were those recognized as globally common. These results are in contrast to those reported for children with rotavirus gastroenteritis from western India where common genotypes were more prevalent than uncommon types [Zade et al., 2009] , but similar to those from southern and eastern India where uncommon G-P combinations were detected frequently among children [Ramchandran et al., 1996; Das et al., 2002] . In this study, uncommon G-P serotype combinations were detected in Indian adults for the first time. Thus, as is the case in children, a wide variety of reassortant rotavirus strains cause diarrhea in adults. In addition, circulation of such strains, for example, G9P[4] which do not share serotype antigens with the vaccine could influence success of vaccination programs, if protective immunity to such strains is lower.",

            "text": "In the present study, the proportion of mixed infections (39.0%/35.3%) detected among adolescents and adults at both time points (Table III) , was relatively high compared to that reported for children from India [Ramchandran et al., 1996; Sharma et al., 2008] , Brazil [Timenetsky et al., 1996] , Bangladesh [Unicomb et al., 1999] , UK [Iturriza-Gomara et al., 2000a] , Tunisia [Chouikha et al., 2007] , and Denmark [Fisher et al., 2005] . In order to confirm that these represented true mixed infections and identify VP7/VP4 lineages present in infected adolescents and adults, the DNA products obtained in multiplex PCR were sequenced. It is of note that the distribution of rotavirus strains (G1, G2, G4, P[4], P[8], and P[6]) in the lineages/sublineages (Figs. 4 and 5) was similar to that reported for children from different countries [Xin et al., 1993; Iturriza-Gomara et al., 2000b; Kudo et al., 2001; Cunliffe et al., 2001; Bok et al., 2002; Banyai et al., 2004; Page and Steele, 2004; Arista et al., 2006; Mascarenhas et al., 2006; Ansaldi et al., 2007; Araujo et al., 2007; Espinola et al., 2008] . Interestingly, cocirculation of two P[4] lineages was observed for the first time. Unlike the VP7 and VP4 genes of adult strains that were homologous to common human strains, some VP6 genes of these strains were most homologous to bovine and simian rotaviruses (Table IV) . This also contrasted with the VP6 genes of strains from children that are typically closely related to other common human rotavirus strains [ Iturriza-Gomara et al., 2002; Kerin et al., 2007] . These findings suggest that strains causing infections in adolescents and adults need to be studied further to examine the extent of reassortment in other genes to determine their origin.",

Comparative analysis of rotavirus strains/genotypes in different age groups is needed for better understanding of the spread of rotavirus in the community. It is to be noted that the studies conducted in cattle to determine the prevalence of enteric virus shedding have suggested the possibility of adult animal as a source of rota or coronavirus infection in calves [Crouch and Acres, 1984] . Since natural infections with rotavirus do not confer life-long immunity, adolescents and adults may repeatedly undergo infections, which can vary from asymptomatic status to severe sustained infections depending on the immune status of the host. Under such circumstances, asymptomatic adults infected with rotavirus could potentially serve as a reservoir to maintain rotavirus circulation in the population [Pietruchinski et al., 2006] . Further, adult infections may serve as another source of rotavirus genomic diversity, which may limit the beneficial use of rotavirus vaccines being introduced in children from India. ",
