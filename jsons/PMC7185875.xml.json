For intravascular thrombosis, imbalance between coagulation and fibrinolysis, which predisposes to both hypercoagulation and hypofibrinolysis, has consistently presented itself in the intravascular events [10], [11], [14]. For extravascular lipid deposition, abnormal lipid transportation to the peripheral tissue [12] and excessive PPAR\u03b32-mediated adipogenesis [13] has been involved in extravascular events. Although it has been experimentally confirmed that a combined administration of an anticoagulant with a lipid-lowering agent may help prevent steroid-associated ON in rabbits [15], an ideal strategy is highly desirable to simultaneously target both intravascular thrombosis and extravascular lipid deposition for preventing steroid-associated ON [3].",

Interestingly, the frequency of herb preparation used for SARS patients during rehabilitation after pulsed steroid-treatment was much higher in South China (conventional herbal intervention with WHO recommended procedure) than in North China (WHO recommended procedure without conventional herbal intervention) [16], [17], [18]. The lower ON prevalence in South China was suggested to be associated with their potential effects on prevention of steroid-associated ON.

This phytoestrogen-rich PE, has been proven to be safe and become an alternative preparation for long-term administration without reported notable side effects to prevent postmenopausal osteoporosis [19], [22], [23]. In terms of potential extravascular efficacy, phytoestrogen (either Genistein or Daidzein) has been shown to be able to decrease low-density lipoprotein, increase high-density lipoprotein [24], [25], [26] and downregulate PPAR\u03b32 gene expression [27], [28], [29], [30]. This implies a potential capability of inhibiting extravascular lipid deposition in peripheral tissues. In terms of potential intravascular efficacy, phytoestrogen (either Icariin or Daidzein) has been reported with potential anti-thrombotic activities intravascularly through a mechanism of maintaining balance between coagulation and fibrinolysis [31], [32], [40]. However, the prevention effect of PE on steroid-associated ON has not been studied scientifically. Accordingly, we hypothesized that PE might exert beneficial effect on preventing steroid-associated ON development with inhibition of both thrombosis and lipid deposition. A recently established steroid-associated ON rabbit model with high incidence of ON and no mortality of animals was used to test the hypothesis [9].",

The experimental protocol was approved by the Animal Experiment Ethics Committee of The Chinese University of Hong Kong (Ref No. 04/038/MIS). Based on our established protocol for inducing steroid-associated ON [9], all the rabbits were intravenously injected with 10 \u03bcg/kg body weight of Lippolysaccharide (LPS; Escherichia coli 0111:B4, Sigma-Aldrich, Inc. USA) on day 0 (week 0). 24 h later, three injections of 20 mg/kg body weight of Methylprednisolone (MPS; Pharmacia and Upjohn, USA) were given intramuscularly at a time interval of 24 h. They were then divided into control group (CON; n\n = 14) with oral vehicle and PE group (PE; n\n = 16, 5 mg/kg body weight/day) with oral PE for 6 weeks, beginning on day 0 before LPS injection. A specifically custom-made tube was used for oral administration [23]. Six weeks after LPS injection, all the rabbits were then euthanized for evaluations. Both control vehicle and PE (10 mg flavonoids preparation containing 5000 \u03bcg Icariin, 250 \u03bcg Genistein, 1250 \u03bcg Daidzein and 3500 \u03bcg vehicle) (Fig. 1) was commercially available (Tong Ji Tang Pharmacal Company, Gui Zhou, China). The time-point of 6 weeks for euthanasia was experimentally confirmed to present ON lesions accompanied by repair process in our most recent study which is equivalent to Stage II ON (Ficart and Arlet classification system) [9]. The body weight of the animals was recorded weekly for adjusting administration of PE. The final body weight before sacrifice was documented. Accident mortality in both groups was recorded throughout the experiment period.",

Rabbits were anesthetized and placed in supine with the lower limb flexed and fixed by adhesive tape. An extremity coil (transmit\u2013receive surface coil) was used on the target site. Preliminary sagittal and oblique axial images were obtained to define the local longitudinal axis. T1-weighed sequence (T1W, repetition time [TR]/echo time [TE] = 425/13 ms) was employed in turn for the conventional MRI images of the target site [9]. Imaging parameters were as follows: section thickness of 3 mm, intersection gap of 1 mm, field of view of 120 mm and imaging matrix of 256 \u00d7 128. A receive-only surface coil was used to cover the target site. The contrast-enhanced dynamic MR pulse sequence used previously established ultrafast T1-weighted gradient-echo sequences (turbo-field echo; Philips) with TR = 2.2 ms, TE = 0.92 ms, pre-pulse inversion time = 400 ms, flip angle = 15\u00b0, scan percentage = 40%, and acquisition matrix = 128 \u00d7 128 [9]. A total of 200 dynamic images were obtained in 90 s. A bolus of dimeglumin gadopentetate (Magnevist; Schering, Berlin, Germany) (0.8 mmol/kg/body weight) was rapidly administered manually via a previously placed 21-gauge intravenous catheter in the right ear vein, immediately followed by a 6 ml saline flush at the same injection rate. The dynamic scan started as soon as the injection of the contrast medium commenced. Signal intensity (SI) was then measured in operator-defined ellipse-like regions of interest (ROIs) over the target site beneath the joint space in the mid-coronal T1-weighted images using a cursor and graphic display device. The signal intensity values derived from the ROIs were plotted against time as time-intensity curve (TIC) using the Gyroview software system (Philips). The baseline value (SIbase) of the SI in a TIC was calculated as the mean SI value in the first three images. The maximum SI (SImax) was defined as the peak enhancement value at a given time interval of 90 s after contrast injection during early phase of the first pass of contrast. Perfusion parameter was calculated namely: \u2018Maximum enhancement\u2019. \u2018Maximum enhancement\u2019 was defined as the maximum percentage increase (SImax \u2212 SIbase) in SI from baseline (SIbase) [34]. The perfusion parameter was calculated according to the following equation:Maximum enhancement=(SImax\u2212SIbase)SIbase\u00d7100%\n",

However, the combination therapeutics in Motomura et al.'s work started 1\u20132 weeks before inductive injection, and PE in our study started immediately after inductive injection. It is difficult to compare the prevention efficacy between those two experimental studies directly. Whether an introduction of a pretreatment with PE would help to reduce ON incidence, only further studies will tell. On the other hand, our histopathological results also showed PE did not decrease ON extension (numbers of ON lesion per affected rabbit) although it did decrease ON incidence significantly, which was consistent with Motomura G's experimental findings [15]. Based on Motomura G's outstanding discussion, it could be explained that there may be \u2018a threshold\u2019 beyond which ON development initiated, and PE may have modulated the threshold. Once the threshold was reached, PE had little effect on multi-focal nature of ON [15]. However, the future augmentation of prevention still depends on improved understandings of the \u2018threshold\u2019.",
