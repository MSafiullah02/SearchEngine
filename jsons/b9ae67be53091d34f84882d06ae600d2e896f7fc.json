For children aged 6 months to 17 years, the overall vaccine effectiveness was 61% (1) . In addition, a growing body of evidence indicates that the protective immune responses triggered by flu vaccines wane in a matter of weeks (2) . Antiviral drugs thus form an important part of an effective approach to influenza and are critical to planning for a pandemic (3) .",

The mTOR pathway is dysregulated in human diseases, particularly in cancers. Rapamycin (sirolimus) is a bacterial product that can inhibit mTOR via AMPK activation and the inhibition of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway (6) . mTOR signaling is necessary for the development of influenza and modulates the antibody response to provide cross-protective immunity to lethal infection with influenza virus. In animal studies, rapamycin was shown to promote cross-strain protection against lethal infection with influenza virus of various subtypes when administered during immunization with influenza virus subtype H3N2 (7) . Mitogenic stimulation accelerates influenza-induced mortality in animals by increasing susceptibility of alveolar type II cells to infection, and pre-treatment with rapamycin reverses this effect (8) .",

This dose of buformin, 15 to 30 mg per day, would be highly unlikely to produce lactic acidosis, the main biguanide complication. In a previous study, the toxic oral buformin dose was 329\u00b130 mg/day in 24 patients who developed lactic acidosis while using buformin. Another group of 24 patients administered 258\u00b125 mg/day buformin did not develop lactic acidosis (25) . In other words, the inhaled buformin dose can be increased 10-fold above what would be needed to treat influenza and would still be well below the systemic toxic dose (Fig. 3) .
