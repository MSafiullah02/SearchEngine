            "text": "The urban health world is rife with projects-to alleviate poverty, empower communities, provide better roads, increase access to education, secure primary care, etc. Many of these initiatives, rightly, have a fixed life. A new school needs to be built; upon completion it requires staff and maintenance: these are entirely different things that can be managed well on a project basis. But a proper policy would take a longer term perspective that includes not just the building and maintenance of the infrastructure. Such a policy would set parameters to how infrastructure relates to continued access, how both of these relate to the delivery of a curriculum, and how to undertake regular reviews of accomplishments. Goumans and Springett (1997) have identified that many Healthy Cities suffer from projectism. Interestingly, although this term (alternated with 'projectitis') has become an integral part of the vernacular of the-critical-government bureaucrat, we have been unable to ascertain an authoritative definition for it. In development studies, Pareschi (2002) and Little (2005) refer to projectism when they describe the tendency of the international development community (the 'do-gooders' (Christensen 2004) in development aid) to impose a project format with defined beginning and end, contained resources (money, people) in time and space, on daily activities undertaken by indigenous communities that by their very nature are organic and ongoing, e.g. the defence of territory, production of food, and political organization. Such project 'containment', they assert, can provoke major changes in cultural values, leadership patterns, time conceptions, organizational structure, and political relations in affected indigenous communities. True as this may be, the popularity of projectism/itis suggests that the phenomenon may have detrimental effects in high-income, industrialized nations as well. A definition that reaches beyond indigenous culture into (Western) bureaucratic and political values might read 'The reflex, intention and action to contain organisational and community efforts in terms of resource allocation, time, space and conceptualisation purely for the sake of accountability and management purposes, not because the effort at hand necessarily lends itself to such limitation'. Goumans and Springett (1997) have investigated the potential of Healthy Cities to move beyond projects and projectism, and found that ample opportunities exist to move into longer term programmes or policies that embed the value base and strategic outlook of the approach. In this chapter we take a look at the conditions that may facilitate such a longer term endeavour.",

Policy diffusion researchers (e.g. Shipan and Volden 2008) argue that local governments drive policy innovation and diffusion of novel policies horizontally to other local governments, and vertically to regional and national governments. For example, policy diffusion facilitated the Netherlands' efforts to develop a broad Healthy Public Policy in the 1980s (de Leeuw and Polman 1995) . Global commitments, such as the Kyoto Protocol for climate change adaptation and mitigation or the Framework Convention for Tobacco Control, can be seen as crucial benchmarks for the need to develop new policy types. Policy innovation does not happen exclusively bottom-up or top-down, but must be characterized as happening through a process called 'mixed scanning' (Etzioni 1967 (Etzioni , 1986 in which systems of incremental and reciprocal checks and balances between governance levels create opportunities for change.",

'Glocal health' (de Leeuw 2001; de Leeuw et al. 2006; Kickbusch 1999 ) is a term used to recognize and appreciate the intricate and inseparable interface between global developments (e.g. climate change or trade) and local responses (e.g. councils adopting building codes that account for the increased risks of flooding and heat islands, or offering favourable opportunities for local entrepreneurship to engage in international forums). This glocalization dynamic is reciprocal. Less likely or desirable global developments may be mitigated-or exacerbated-by local action. For instance, the increasing number of local governments around the world adopting 'zero-carbon emission' policies (e.g. Koehn 2008) not only contribute to possible reductions in climate change risks, but also send signals to their colleagues, at local as well as higher government levels, that such actions are feasible and effective. Through policy diffusion these local policies impact on global change. In fact, analyses of local government efficacies in the late 1980s and early 1990s led to the introduction of the terms 'glocal' and 'glocalization' into our vocabularies (Swyngedouw 1992) . Virtually every development and phenomenon in Healthy Cities has glocal dimensions.",

The growing body of evidence, over recent decades, on the social, political, and commercial determinants of health may well enable local government better than other levels of government and governance to take decisive action. Evidence from the other chapters in this book shows that local governments (and especially Healthy City ones) are in closer contact with their constituents and would purportedly be able to respond more effectively and quickly to needs expressed. Clearly this is an idealtype description: not all local governments are transparent and accountable, and not all people may be, or may feel, represented. This is particularly true for slum dwellers. Sometimes urban inequities are literally hidden-in many Third World cities the slums and their informal populations are located in gullies and ravines. But in others, the favelas rise up high on the slopes surrounding affluence. It appears that technology can come to a degree of rescue, whether it is enabling social connectedness in Nairobi slums (Corburn and Karanja 2014) or physical connectedness through novel public transportation solutions in Medellin, Colombia (D\u00edez et al. 2015) .",

There is a strong argument to be made that these perspectives play out best at the local level because it is there that cooperation between state, market, and civil society actors is considered most likely to produce coordinated planning and action (Christensen and Laegreid 2007) . The search for whole, joined-up, integral, or horizontal local government approaches achieved momentum, some scholars and politicians claim, since the (perhaps overly zealous) adoption of 'new public management' (NPM) principles from the 1980s. In NPM citizens are viewed as customers, and public servers/administrators are considered managers of product and service delivery.",

One came from Finland during its presidency of the European Union in 2006: Finland, building on its experience in the long-running North Karelia project (labelled a 'horizontal health policy'), urged other members of the Union to engage in a horizontal, complementary policy-related strategy contributing to improved population health.

One was a horizontal (comprehensive, systems-driven) approach aligned with a set of strong values around equity, participation, and community-driven bottom-up action for health and well-being, and the other a vertical (disease and health care-driven) approach aligned with the need to address specific (burdens of) disease in many countries, and grounded in existing institutions and patterns in the delivery of clinical interventions. Ideology-inspired debates have raged, contrasting the superiority of each approach. Reviews show that vertical programmes, particularly those targeting infectious disease morbidity, may yield short-term and specific health gains (e.g. from vaccination campaigns), but that long-term population health development (e.g. aiming at the reduction of the incidence of non-communicable disease [NCD]) does not unequivocally benefit from such selective approaches (e.g. Magnussen et al. 2004) . Vertical programmes work for particular threats, and horizontal programmes contribute to general well-being. In particular, addressing health equity and NCDs does not align well with a selective, vertical approach. Evidence has emerged that, depending on the existing health profile and management of (social) determinants of health in different communities and countries, an appropriate balance between the two should be struck. Building on a mix between vertical and horizontal primary health care, the aspiration should be to engage in the development of comprehensive health strategies accessible to all (Rasanathan et al. 2011 ).",

What 'full participation' entailed was (and perhaps continues to be) a matter of debate, and Arnstein's 'ladder of participation' as well as Davidson's 'wheel of participation' have contributed significantly to insights into the circumstances and degrees of public participation in the planning endeavour.

The views espoused by Freire and others in this tradition hinge on a philosophy that all in society should be able to engage with personal and social development equitably, through open forms of democracy and decision-making.

He sees community assets as all the potential resources in a community-not only financial, but also the talents and skills of individuals, organizational capacity, political connections, buildings and facilities, and so on (Kretzmann and McKnight 1993) . Some authors (e.g. Page-Adams and Sherraden 1997) criticize such a broad conceptualization as assets might be taken to mean 'all good things', and in order to make assets more tangible they prefer to frame them in a more economic manner.

            "text": "The asset model presented by Morgan et al. (2010) aims to redress the balance between evidence derived from the identification of problems to that which accentuates the positive capability to identify problems jointly and activate solutions, and so promotes the self-esteem of individuals and communities and leads to less dependency on professional services. This can lead to an increase in the number and distribution of protective/promoting factors that are assets for individual-and community-level health. The asset approach should be seen as the 'shiny' side of the coin. The deficit approach remains valuable in responding to acute crises (at individual, community or societal levels), but in evidence terms at least, the asset model may help to further explain the persistence of health and well-being inequities despite increased efforts to do something about it. Harrison et al. (2004) have defined health assets as resources that individuals and communities have at their disposal and that protect against negative health outcomes, or promote health status. These assets can be social, financial, physical, environmental, or human resources (e.g. education, employment skills, supportive social networks, natural resources) (Harrison et al. 2004 ). As such, a health asset can be defined as any factor or resource which enhances the ability of individuals, groups, communities, populations, social systems, or institutions to maintain and sustain health and well-being and to help to reduce health inequities. These assets can operate at the level of the individual, group, community, or population as protective (or promoting) factors to buffer against life's stresses. Obviously a balance needs to be struck between the intangible assets (skills, knowledge, intents, and aspirations) and the hardware assets of a community (schools, work, infrastructure, etc.). Even when both are available there may still be a disconnect between the two: individuals, families, and communities may want to improve their health, but insidious factors such as (health) literacy, culture, sexism, and racism may stand in the way of full and equitable access and use. An asset-based health approach should carefully take into account all elements of a complex individual, social and ecological environment.",

A strong case was made of the importance to national economies and local communities of addressing health and disease factors that impeded full economic development (Jamison 1993) . The report was criticized for espousing New Public Management and neoliberal principles of outsourcing and privatizing health as a public good (including, e.g., the supply of safe drinking water) and quantifying the impact of disability on economic development through a measure called the 'disability-adjusted life year' (DALY) (e.g. Navarro 2007 ). However, it succeeded in placing health promotion and public health management on global and local agendas as legitimate strategies for development. The argument for HiAP, also at the global level between international bodies, has evolved in the past 20 years with the family of UN agencies, including World Bank, UNDP, and WHO, now mobilized for NCD action.",

Impressively, the global Marmot Report has had a number of regional (Europe), national (e.g. Brazil, England), and local (Malm\u00f8) reincarnations, highlighting the opportunities and benefits of political action on the social determinants of health. In recent years there has also been a move to take the discourse further, with some starting to address commercial and political determinants of health. Recently WHO and UNDP issued Guidance Note on the Integration of Noncommunicable Diseases into the United Nations Development Assistance Framework (2015), an expression of the joint-agency work that was an outcome of the high-level meeting at the UN in which NCDs were given utmost priority.

(In)equality, some say, is purely a description of that social health gradient, whereas (in)equity conveys a view of the moral and social injustice of such differences in society. Wilkinson and Pickett (2010) describe how equitable societies provide and create better opportunities for health for all, including enhanced economic development, sustainability, and educational attainment.

(Commission on Global Governance 1995) In the European Region of WHO, from the early stages of the programme, a commitment to intersectoral governance has been a criterion for designation as a Healthy City. From phase II onwards, cities needed to submit evidence that they had established an intersectoral steering committee (ISC) that would oversee policy and intervention development (Heritage and Green 2013; Lipp et al. 2013 ). There are no specific requirements to the design or architecture of such ISCs, as they are often driven by unique local contexts and requirements. Whether cities lived up to the expectation beyond their formal application commitments was ascertained via annual reporting templates. Virtually all members of the network reported that they did establish an ISC, although the frequency with which this body met was variable. In some cities it met only once a year, and in others more regularly, up to monthly. In cities where the ISC met annually, the role of the body was more at a systems and regulatory level, such as driving and approving policy development and monitoring of intersectoral deliverables; ISCs that met more regularly tended to engage more directly in the operational aspects of partnership development, such as allocation of resources and direct supervision of working relationships.",

Ideally this requires a policy and managerial context that embraces the values of HiAP described below, and it is important that different sectoral stakeholders collaborate effectively. Lipp et al. (2013) show that from phase II through phase IV of the European Healthy Cities programme, intersectoral action has expanded and strengthened. For example, the 31 cities participating in both phase III and phase IV increased the extent of partnership working in all sector studies: health services, social services, education, urban planning, voluntary, environmental protection, transport, and economic development. For phase V, Farrington et al. (2015) show that Healthy Cities, in trying to address the prevention of non-communicable disease, also make explicit efforts to work intersectorally in distal determinants of health. European Healthy Cities, they find, recognize that to make healthier choices easier requires appropriate structuring of the upstream determinants of health. For example, interventions in the built environment to make active living an easier choice include investment in city sports and exercise facilities, investment in cycling infrastructure, and redesignating streets for pedestrians only.",

Building on a strong foundation in the various political statements on Healthy Cities over the years and most recently in the Athens Declaration (Tsouros 2015) , local governments work with diverse stakeholders from the public and civil society sectors to develop such policies. The nearly three decades of Healthy City development are clearly leaving a legacy, in that Healthy Cities manage the politics and logistics of interorganizational work effectively. This is clearly dependent on strong yet flexible governance arrangements and demonstrated commitments to the action component of intersectorality (McQueen et al. 2012a, b) In the evidence on intersectoral policy development and implementation compiled for European Healthy Cities (de Leeuw et al. 2015) , there was an interesting mix between more traditional health approaches, such as a programme on active living in Izhevsk, Russian Federation, and initiatives where the health sector has more peripheral ownership, such as a programme on sustainability in Amaroussion, Greece. This is precisely the message for effective HiAP development-that the health sector has the capacity to share, redistribute, and even disavow ownership of policy initiatives beyond its traditional remit. Healthy Cities show that such actions do not compromise but strengthen the integrity of health sector policy-making capacity.",

Substantial impact on this broader aspiration was made by the evidence-based medicine mantra that has its foundation in the work of Archibald Cochrane. He found that many medical practices were not firmly rooted in evidence of effectiveness (whether something produces the intended result) or efficiency (how well it produces that result).

Scholars started to focus on particular bodies of knowledge and developed strong theories for each. When in the nineteenth century medicine, as one of these disciplines, became highly professionalized (influenced by the industrial revolution and a growing upwardly mobile middle class) these disciplines started to specialize even further. The process is sometimes called 'hyperspecialization' and today can be witnessed in the proliferation of academic journals focusing on quite particular areas of interest.",
