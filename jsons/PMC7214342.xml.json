In the UK, the annual cost of the adverse effects of air pollution on human health is estimated to be about \u00a315 billion (Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA), 2010). Children and young people are particularly vulnerable to the effects of air pollution (Currie et al., 2013) because of its impact on physical and mental development which can cause health implications across the lifespan (Guerreiro et al., 2016). Detrimental impacts from exposure to air pollution have been reported for early life health outcomes such as pregnancy outcomes (Rogers and Dunlop, 2006), lung development and function (Portnov et al., 2009), the central nervous system (Block and Calder\u00f3n-Garcidue\u00f1as, 2009), life expectancy at birth, and infant mortality (Fotourehchi, 2016). Furthermore, air pollution has also been reported to have adverse effects on mental development (Guxens and Sunyer, 2012), language development (Calder\u00f3n-Garcidue\u00f1as et al., 2008), attention and sensory perception (Wang et al., 2009). Higher concentrations of NO2 and PM2.5 at the home location are thought to have both acute and irreversible effects on childhood cognition (Currie et al., 2014). These early life health outcomes are also related to long-term outcomes including; labour force participation, productivity (Hanna and Oliva, 2015), earnings (Currie et al., 2013) and poorer wellbeing and mental health.",

A plausible mechanism includes, interruption to learning/cognition due to asthma/hayfever related illness, resulting in a detrimental effect on educational outcomes. Air pollution has a negative impact on cognitive ability, including forgetfulness, inattentiveness and careless errors (Sunyer et al., 2017) which are important skills used in academic learning and examinations. Furthermore, exposure to air pollution has been negatively associated with school absences (Currie et al., 2009). In Israel, a longitudinal study of 71,383 students reported that high levels of PM2.5 were negatively associated with exam results (Lavy and Roth, 2014). Children with asthma (Ruijsbroek et al., 2015) and/or hay fever (Bensnes, 2016) have been found to have poorer educational outcomes. To our knowledge, the combined effect of the modification of air pollution on school performance by asthma or SAR, has not been investigated previously, possibly due to a lack of data linkage across these different domains.",

We have linked air pollution estimates with temporally adjacent routinely collected health and education outcomes for each student. Routinely collected data are those that are collected for purposes other than research or without a specific research question (Benchimol et al., 2015). We used these data in a temporal investigation to explore whether acute exposure to air pollution had an impact on educational outcomes, and if children treated for Asthma/SAR were impacted to a greater or lesser extent. Previous studies have investigated the effect of air pollution on cognition by collecting data from participants enrolled in small studies (Freire et al., 2010); however, these studies have been restricted to small numbers of participants. Another study used repeated outcome measures from a birth cohort and linked these to a census tract averaged air pollution risk measure at a single time point (Grineski et al., 2020). Our study used a city-wide cohort of all students who sat General Certificate of Secondary Education (GCSE) examinations as a proxy for cognition. These examinations are taken by most students at the end of compulsory schooling in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland.",

For each year these typically showed a fractional bias over all sites of about 0.05 corresponding to an underestimation of less than 2 \u03bcg/m3. Comparisons with measurements from one automatic reference monitor on Cardiff for NO2 and PM showed a similar level of performance.

Another study that reported a negative association of SAR with school performance (Kim et al., 2017) used self-reported data and may have captured more cases of SAR than our study. In our study, it may be that only the more severe cases of SAR are recorded in the primary care data because over-the-counter treatments are available.

However, poorer examination results have implications for future education and economic work life benefits (Bensnes, 2016).

Current UK policies to reduce air pollution are focused on economic and overall health improvement (DEFRA, 2020). Our results suggest that future analyses should be based on deprivation levels to improve our insights into the effects of air pollution. This would provide evidence to inform policies that improve air quality for the most deprived populations to reduce health inequalities (Chief Medical Officer, 2017). The postponement of the introduction of the Clean Air Zones in the UK due to the COVID-19 pandemic (The Guardian, 2020) could be an opportunity to include a health inequality assessment in future policy (Whitehead, 2014).",

High spatial and temporal modelled pollution data are not available routinely for all urban areas, however, we anticipate that these results will prove to be valuable, thereby encouraging additional urban area modelling. We recommend future work include data on emergency hospital admissions and attendances for respiratory conditions, which occurred too infrequently in the current single city study sample. These outcomes are not subject to treatment seeking behaviour. Utilising secondary healthcare data can be used as a measure of condition severity but also highlight temporal flares of conditions and associated temporal changes in air pollutant concentrations. Ultimately, current traffic reductions from the COVID-19 social isolation measures are likely to have improved air quality in many cities, although simultaneous disruptions to education means using attainment as an outcome is unfeasible.",
