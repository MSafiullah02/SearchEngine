Methods: Fifty-five asymptomatic children attending elective surgical procedures (14 with stable asthma, 41 normal controls) underwent non-bronchoscopic bronchoalveolar lavage. Differential cell count and PCR for 13 common viruses were performed. Results: Nineteen (35%) children were positive for at least one virus, with adenovirus being most common. No differences in the proportion of viruses detected were seen between asthmatic and normal 'control' children.

This was observed for all viruses (rhinovirus, metapneumovirus, HSV and EBV) other than adenovirus suggesting that the viral detection is not because of contamination from upper airways. In a previous study of asthmatic and normal adult volunteers, viral shedding was still detectable in 54% of adult subjects 14 days after experimental inoculation with human rhinovirus-16 (27) . However, the quantity of virus was low at this point, and cold symptoms were generally either gone or resolving. Another study showed that adenovirus was detected for 2 weeks in six (75%) of eight cases suggesting that this DNA virus can be latent (10, 12) . In addition, the normal reference values for neutrophil counts (%) from controls in this study, without a detectable virus in BAL (median neutrophil 1.32%, 95th centile 8.4%, n = 27), are lower than previously reported (median neutrophil 3.2%, 95th centile 29.8%) (28) . Concurrent asymptomatic viral infection may have artificially inflated our previously published range and this suggests that the presence of a virus in BAL should be taken into account when interpreting BAL neutrophil counts. We identified six samples with herpes viruses (HSV and EBV), which are known to be shed on the respiratory tract in adults, during physiological stress or disease (17, 18) . While shedding into respiratory tract may be the explanation in these children, rather than acute infection, it is notable that in four of the five cases (where symptom data were available), parents recorded recent respiratory tract symptoms and in three of these samples, there was a significant BAL neutrophilia. We cannot exclude the possibility that these represented acute de novo infection but we believe it is more probable that a prior stress, such as an acute respiratory tract infection (in one sample there was EBV and adenovirus present), caused acute airways inflammation and subsequent HSV \u2044 EBV shedding.
