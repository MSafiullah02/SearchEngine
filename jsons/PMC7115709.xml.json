The clinical presentation of BOS is heterogeneous.5 The type of presentation, the time from transplantation to onset, and the rate of progression are all variable between patients (Fig. 2\n). BOS may present as an acute illness and imitate a respiratory infection,5 but in most patients it starts as an asymptomatic process that produces an insidious decline in lung function. In approximately 20% of patients, BOS develops within 2 years of transplantation (early-onset BOS), but the vast majority of patients develop the complication at a later point in time.2, 6 Some patients present with a substantial loss of lung function and are already in BOS stage 2 or 3 (high-grade onset) at presentation whereas others show a slow decline over time.6 In a study by Jackson and colleagues5 56% of 204 patients who developed BOS showed a sudden drop in FEV1, whereas 18% presented with a smooth linear decline; time to BOS onset was longer in the latter group. Acute rejection during the first 6 months was significantly associated with acute onset of BOS. Auscultation of the lungs is often normal, but squeaks and coarse crackles may be heard. High-resolution CT may reveal air trapping (Fig. 3\n) and bronchiectasis,7, 8 without significant parenchymal infiltrate. As the disease progresses, permanent airway colonization with pathogens, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Aspergillus fumigatus, frequently develops. Survival at 5 years after diagnosis ranges from 26% to 43%,6, 9, 10, 11 and survival at 5 years after transplantation is 20% to 40% lower in patients with, compared to patients without, BOS.11 There is also evidence that the number of respiratory infections and the aggressiveness with which they are treated have an impact on BOS progression.9 In addition to representing a major obstacle to long-term survival, BOS causes significant morbidity and loss of health-related quality of life.12\n",

Therefore, as expected for any functional marker, a drop in FEV1 is likely to have a low specificity for the diagnosis of BO (this is why exclusionary criteria were added to the definition of BOS). This lack of specificity is difficult to assess because a gold standard is rarely available. Yet in a study of lungs explanted at the time of retransplantation for BOS,13 pathology examination always showed at least some degree of BO, but a wide range of other pathologic processes of potential clinical significance was also evident in half of the specimens.",

            "text": "Because it is well known that macrolide antibiotics are effective in treating airway diseases which, like BOS, are associated with neutrophilic inflammation (eg, panbronchiolitis and cystic fibrosis), Gerhardt and colleagues14 performed an open trial with AZM in lung transplant recipients. In this study, AZM (250 mg 3 times a week) was added to the current immunosuppressive treatment in 6 patients with BOS; 5 patients responded with a mean improvement in the FEV1 of 21.6% after 14 weeks. One patient even had a complete restoration of FEV1 to peak post-transplant values. This landmark study was followed by at least 6 studies,15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20 of which 4 confirmed the results published by Gerhardt and colleagues.14 One study by Benden and colleagues21 also reported a positive effect of clarithromycin on FEV1. Taking these publications together, approximately 35% of all patients in different BOS stages responded to macrolide treatment by a mean increase in FEV1 of approximately 14%. Furthermore, a higher bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid neutrophilia was associated with a greater likelihood of functional response.18 Based on these observations, Verleden and colleagues22 suggested that BOS might be dichotomized into an AZM-responsive phenotype characterized by airway neutrophilia and functional improvement with AZM (the so-called neutrophilic reversible allograft/airways dysfunction [NRAD]), and an AZM-unresponsive phenotype, which corresponds to the classical, fibroproliferative form of BO. These two phenotypes might have different pathophysiology, clinical presentation, and prognosis; for example, NRAD might start earlier after transplantation and progress slower than fibroproliferative BOS; and crackles, increased sputum production, bronchiectasis, and mucus plugging might be more prominent in the former than in the latter.",

The lung is uniquely exposed to the environment, however, and thus to recurrent nonalloimmune insults, such as infections, inhalation of toxic fumes, or gastroesophageal reflux. Furthermore, recent studies suggest a possible role of autoantibodies developed against specific epithelial proteins and of airway hypoxia in the pathogenesis of BOS/BO. The current view is that these insults, acting alone or in combination, up-regulate dendritric cells in the airway epithelium, leading to epithelial damage and inflammation with production of chemokines and cytokines by airway epithelium and smooth muscle cells, macrophages, and neutrophils. Activated neutrophils further increase epithelial damage via the production of reactive oxygen species and metalloproteinases. After the initial inflammatory phase, a fibroproliferative phase occurs, driven by growth factors and leading to proliferation of smooth muscle cells and myofibroblasts. This process eventually results in aberrant collagen deposition, excessive fibroproliferation, and small airway obliteration. BO would thus represent a final common pathway lesion secondary to multiple, repetitive insults to the airway epithelium.29, 30\n",

Graft survival rates showed a stepwise decrease as the combined number of HLA-A+B+DR mismatches increased from 1 to 6, with a high number of HLA mismatches having an unfavorable impact on survival.31 Because of the average high number of mismatches, studies to examine the effect of HLA mismatching on the incidence of acute rejection have proved difficult and their results have been inconsistent. Most of them have, however, identified some negative impact of HLA mismatching.32, 33 Multivariate logistic regression analyses of data on 3549 adult lung transplant recipients retrieved from the United Network for Organ Sharing/ISHLT registry demonstrated an association between mismatching at the HLA-A locus (but not at the HLA-B or HLA-DR loci) and acute rejection episodes requiring hospital admission.34 Several studies have confirmed that the development of anti-HLA class I and class II antibodies after surgery is associated with a risk for acute rejection and BOS.35, 36, 37, 38, 39 Binding of these antibodies to airway epithelial cells may induce epithelial injury and proliferation.40\n",

Several studies have shown that the risk of BOS increases when acute vascular rejection is histologically severe or persistent or recurs after treatment (studies reviewed by Knoop and Estenne42). The impact of minimal acute rejection (grade A1) on the development of BOS, however, has been long neglected. Recently, in a study by Hopkins and colleagues43 less than10% of grade A1 rejections were associated with clinical symptoms but 34% of the asymptomatic patients progressed to higher-grade acute rejection or lymphocytic bronchiolitis (LB) within 3 months. In this report also, patients with multiple A1 episodes during the first 12 months post-transplant had a significantly higher risk of developing BOS, and this occurred earlier than in patients with 1 or less grade A1 episode.43 Khalifa and colleagues44 retrospectively examined data from 228 lung transplant patients followed over a 7-year period and confirmed that grade A1 rejection is a distinct risk factor for BOS. Hachem and colleagues45 from the same group determined that even a single episode of A1 rejection, without recurrence or subsequent progression to a higher rejection grade, was a significant risk factor for the development of BOS. Treatment of grade A1 rejection with diverse approaches in order to augment the net immunosuppression decreased the risk for subsequent progression to BOS stage 1.44\n",

In a study by Botha and colleagues,59 including 155 lung transplant recipients, the development of allograft colonization with Pseudomonas was strongly associated with the development of BOS within 2 years of transplant (23.4% and 7.7% in those colonized and not colonized, respectively). The isolation of Pseudomonas predated the diagnosis of BOS in more than 75% of affected patients by a median exceeding 200 days. Similar findings have been reported for Aspergillus colonization.60 Valentine and colleagues61 analyzed the role of bacterial and fungal respiratory tract infections in the development of BOS in a single-center study comprising 161 lung recipients who had survived at least 180 days. Multivariate analysis indicated that gram-negative, gram-positive, and fungal pneumonias were associated with the development of BOS. Gram-positive pneumonia and fungal pneumonia in the first 100 days conferred hazard ratios of 3.8 and 2.1, respectively. They concluded that early recognition and treatment of these pathogens might improve long-term outcomes.",

GERD is observed in approximately half of all lung transplant patients.69 The prevalence of delayed gastric emptying is also high.69 In addition, these patients have an impaired cough reflex because of lung denervation and have altered mucociliary clearance. Taken together, these factors increase the likelihood of aspiration and subsequent airway injury. Pepsin70 and bile acids71 can be readily found in the BAL fluid of many lung transplant recipients, which confirms the frequent occurrence of gastric aspiration. The finding of increased bile acids in BAL fluid (a marker of nonacidic reflux) correlates with the presence of BOS/BO.70, 71 Exposure of the airway epithelium to bile acids may predispose to colonization with Pseudomonas aeruginosa and airway neutrophilia. Because of concern that GERD increases the risk of BOS, the general trend has been to propose a surgical solution, namely gastric fundoplication, to all recipients presenting with significant GERD. Supportive evidence for this strategy is derived from retrospective studies in which gastric fundoplication within 3 months after transplant was associated with greater freedom from BOS and increased survival.72 Another study from the same center showed that fundoplication improved lung function in many patients with established BOS.73 Before adopting this radical approach for every single lung transplant recipient, however, it is important to be aware that (1) the best way to diagnose GERD in lung transplant recipients\u2014pH monitoring versus impedance monitoring\u2014is at present controversial; (2) GERD\u2014as well as the cough reflex\u2014may improve over time; (3) fundoplication may have serious side effects (eg, significant weight loss, which can be of importance in recipients with significant malnutrition); (4) the protective function of the surgical sleeve may wane over time; (5) the precise indications, timing, and choice of fundoplication technique are yet to be defined; and (6) the overall impact on lung function and survival are unknown because there are no controlled studies to date.74\n",

Recent studies (summarized by Verleden and colleagues22) have shown that interleukin (IL)-17 may have an important role in the development of BOS/BO. IL-17 is a potent indirect neutrophil-attracting chemokine through its ability to induce IL-8 secretion from different cell types in the airways. IL-17 is increased in the airways of patients with BOS/BO and induces production of IL-8 by airway smooth muscle and epithelial cells, which, in turn, promotes airway neutrophilia. The IL-17/IL-8 axis may be triggered by both alloimmune and autoimmune mechanisms, airway bacterial colonization, and GERD,22 but the reasons why BOS is accompanied by airway neutrophilia in some patients and not in others remain unclear. The effect of AZM on this inflammatory process is likely primarily accounted for by its ability to inhibit the IL-17/IL-8 pathway; other potential mechanisms include a positive effect of AZM on GERD (AZM is a known agonist of motilin) as well as its inhibitory effect on bacterial growth.",

In this context, optimization of the immunosuppressive regimen to prevent the occurrence of acute rejection is a critical issue (discussed previously). Several studies have looked at the effects of increasing the net level of immunosuppression (eg, by using high-dose methylprednisolone, cytolytic therapy, or methotrexate) and/or changing the maintenance regimen (eg, by shifting from cyclosporine A to tacrolimus or from azathioprine to mycophenolate mofetil, or by adding inhaled cyclosporine A) in patients with established BOS (reviewed by Knoop and Estenne42). In some patients, these modalities have been shown to stabilize lung function or decrease the rate of decline of FEV1 for short periods of time. The small number of patients studied, the mostly retrospective design of these studies, the lack of adequate control group, and the relatively short follow-up time, however, make it difficult to assess the effectiveness of these treatments. No single strategy has proved more successful than another. In addition, augmented immunosuppression increases the risk of toxicity and predisposes to intercurrent bronchopulmonary infections, which must be factored into the risk-benefit analysis as they may promote the progression of BOS (discussed previously).",

The study by Gottlieb and colleagues included 81 patients with a median follow-up of 1.3 years20 and the study by Vos and colleagues98 included 108 patients treated for a median time of 612 days. An initial response (defined as a 10% or more increase in FEV1) was observed in 30% to 40% of the patients, but 30% to 40% of these subsequently relapsed. By multivariate analysis, initial response to AZM and earlier post-transplant time of initiation of treatment were protective factors for disease progression or relapse; in contrast, the level of BAL neutrophilia had no predictive value. These longitudinal data thus show that AZM provides a sustained functional improvement in the long-term in only a small minority of patients with BOS (approximately 10%\u201315%).

Unfortunately, there have been no subsequent reports to confirm these observations nor have there been controlled studies.

The report indicated that early survival after retransplantation was reduced compared with first transplants, but results of retransplants performed for BOS were not different than those done for other indications. In addition, recurrent BOS was observed in a frequency similar to that seen after first transplants. Subsequently, three single-center reports have confirmed this observation. Brugi\u00e8re and colleagues107 reported on long-term outcome in 15 single-lung retransplantations for BOS. The median time between primary lung transplantation and retransplantation was 31 months (range, 12 to 39 months). Actuarial survival rates at 1 year, 2 years, and 5 years after retransplantation were 60%, 53%, and 45%, respectively. Ten patients died during long-term follow-up, 6 of them from infection (60%). The retained graft was the initial site of the fatal infection in 4 of these patients. Two other patients experienced disabling chronic purulent expectoration arising from the old graft. Lung retransplantation thus offered a viable therapeutic option for selected SLT recipients with BOS, but given the morbidity and mortality related to the retained graft, the team now favors replacement of the primary graft when retransplantation is considered.107 Strueber and colleagues108 reported on 54 redo-transplants among 614 lung transplantation procedures performed at their institution. Retransplantation for BOS achieved 1-year and 5-year survival rates of 78% and 62%, respectively, which were not different from those observed after first-time lung transplantations. Recipients had a similar incidence of BOS after retransplantation for BOS versus after a first procedure. The same group published similar results for 7 retransplantations performed in children.109 At present, 1% to 2% of lung transplantations performed yearly worldwide are retransplantations.2 In assessing these procedures, medical issues and the issue of equitable use of scarce resources need be addressed.",
