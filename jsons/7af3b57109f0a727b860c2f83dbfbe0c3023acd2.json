The European Water Framework Directive provides a framework for improving the ecological quality of stream ecosystems, with deviation from reference used as a measure of ecological status. 2. Here we examine the possibility of using less impacted stream sites from Latvia, Lithuania and Poland to establish a Danish reference network for macrophyte assemblages, and as a guiding image for identification of possible references sites within Denmark. Both approaches were evaluated using historical Danish records. 3. Four different macrophyte assemblages were identified for mid-sized streams in the Central and Eastern Lowland ecoregions. Macrophyte assemblages could not be delineated using physical stream site characteristics; however a gradual change in assemblage composition was attributed to differences in alkalinity and human impact. 4. Assemblages of contemporary vegetation in Denmark were quite similar to those found in Polish, Latvian and Lithuanian streams (26-35%). However, more importantly, from species-based predictions we noted higher similarity, particularly with Latvian and Lithuanian streams, before intensive land use commenced in Denmark (c. 1900). These results show that stream sites from these three countries can be considered in a Danish reference network. 5. Two of the four macrophyte assemblages comprised species such as Fontinalis antipyretica, Myriophyllum spicatum, Nuphar lutea, Potamogeton alpinus and P. perfoliatus that have a very scattered occurrence in the contemporary vegetation in Denmark. These groups were closely associated with the predictions from historic records, thereby lending support the conjecture that these assemblages could be part of the guiding image for the identification of potential reference sites within Denmark.",

A central aspect in the directive is the reference concept which is used to assess the ecological impairment of sites (e.g. stream segments of a particular size) and to assess recovery of sites previously identified as impaired. According to the directive, reference conditions are described as 'a state in the present or in the past corresponding to very low pressure without the effects of major industrialization, urbanization and intensification of agriculture, and with only very minor modification of physicochemistry, hydromorphology and biology' (Wallin, Wiederholm & Johnson, 2003) .",

            "text": "However, reference conditions as envisioned by the European Water Framework Directive are rare, and for many regions finding extant reference sites is particularly challenging due to the long-term effects that land use has had on the integrity of streams. Several approaches have been used to establish reference values, such as the condition of systems in the absence of significant human disturbance, the best available sites within an area and the condition that sites might achieve if they were better managed (Stoddard et al., 2006) . One of most common approaches to describe reference conditions is to quantify the biological condition at a set of sites that represent either minimally (MDC) or least (LDC) disturbed conditions (sensu Stoddard et al., 2006; Bailey, Norris & Reynoldson, 2004; Chaves et al., 2006) . The selection of MDC or LDC sites is often based on either the use of pre-established inclusion \u2044 exclusion criteria or expert judgement. Although both theoretical and empirical work has focused on the characterization of pressure gradients to assess impacts on biological communities (e.g. Fore, Karr & Wisseman, 1996; Hering et al., 2006; Johnson et al., 2007) , few studies have focused on understanding the variability of relatively unimpaired sites. This is unfortunate since according to the EU directive it is the biological communities at these sites which will be used to evaluate the degree of impairment. Furthermore, pressure-impact relationships may not cover all types of single or combined pressures affecting biological communities. For example, stream macrophytes are well known for their response to nutrient pollution (see Birk, Korte & Hering, 2006) , but the effect of other types of impairment are less well studied (Baattrup- Pedersen & Riis, 1999; Wright et al., 2003; Daniel, Bernez & Haury, 2006; O'Hare et al., 2006; Pedersen, Baattrup-Pedersen & Madsen, 2006) . Consequently, the establishment of screening criteria and reliable thresholds for the selection of MDC or LDC sites for macrophyte assemblages is difficult.",

            "text": "The use of expert judgement for selecting MDC or LDC sites also has many weaknesses. First, bias may be introduced by focusing on species and assemblages that presently occur in best available sites. In lowland areas with intensive land use this bias may be significant, and species assemblages may differ substantially between the best sites and true reference sites. For example, several Potamogeton species such as P. alpinus Balbis, P. lucens L., P. polygonifolius Pourret and P. praelongus Wulf. were formerly widely distributed, but now many of these species are near or are extinct in lowland streams in several regions of Europe (Bagg\u00f8e & Ravn, 1896; Raunkiaer, 1895-99; Mountford, 1994; work cited in Preston, 1995; Riis & Sand-Jensen, 2001) . Second, it is difficult to avoid subjectivity when using expert judgement. Thus limited knowledge on reference assemblages implies that the perception of what the reference condition represents differs among experts (Birk et al., 2006) .",

A ECOSTAT, 2004) in the Central and Eastern Lowland ecoregions of Europe (e.g. Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Germany, Sweden and Denmark). We used two approaches to establish a reference network for macrophyte assemblages in Danish streams. First, we examined the possibility of using stream sites from regions in Latvia, Lithuania and Poland with less intensive land use. These three countries are similar to Denmark in topography and climate, and all four countries belong to the Central Baltic River Geographical Intercalibration Group (GIG). Second, we examined the possibility of using macrophyte assemblages in these regions in the development of a guiding image for the identification of potential reference sites in Denmark (Stoddard et al., 2006) . We see this guiding image as an extension to the expert judgement, building also on empirical data. Both approaches were validated using historical records for Danish macrophyte assemblages (see Riis & Sand-Jensen, 2001 for the full reference list). These historic data provide a unique opportunity to gain insight into community structure and species Reference vegetation in northern Europe 1891 occurrence before extensive human perturbation and therefore may be particularly valuable in the development of a guiding image for reference assemblages.",

First, we used a subset of the macrophyte data collected from mid-sized lowland streams as part of the EU-funded project STAR (Furse et al., 2006) . This data set included stream sites classified as reference sites using a list of a priori exclusion criteria (Hering et al., 2003; Nijboer et al., 2004) . Four sites were situated in Germany, seven in Poland, three in Sweden, four in Denmark and seven in Latvia. We chose to combine data from sites in Germany and Sweden as well as from the Baltic region and Poland to obtain a better measure of reference assemblages for the mid-sized lowland stream type. Second, we used data from 15 stream sites in Latvia that had been classified as reference (Springe et al., 2006) and from 13 stream sites in Denmark that are considered as LDC sites (Baattrup- Pedersen, Larsen & Riis, 2002; Pedersen et al., 2006) . Third, new data were collected from 10 streams in Lithuania. These sites were selected to study the possibility of using data from an area which has experienced less intensive land use compared to Denmark. Lithuania and Denmark are topographically and climatically similar (average precipitation in Lithuania 661 mm compared to 712 mm in Denmark; average temperature 6\u00b0C in Klaipeda compared to 7.7\u00b0C in Denmark). The selected sites can be regarded as LDC sites, with intensive land use varying between 9-57% of total catchment area. The geographic location of the sampling sites is shown in Fig. 1 .",

A 100-m long stream reach was surveyed and macrophyte recordings were made in approximately 250 plots (25 \u00b7 25 cm) adjacently placed along 10 crosssectional transects in each reach. A cover score was allocated to each species present in the plots using an abundance scale: 1 = 1-5%, 2 = 6-25%, 3 = 26-50%, 4 = 51-75%, 5 = 76-100%. Species abundance was then calculated as the sum of cover scores to the maximum score sum (i.e. the number of plots multiplied by the maximal score of five). Water depth was measured to the nearest centimetre at a fixed point in each of the plots and the mean depth was calculated from these recordings. The dominant substratum type was categorized as stone (>60 mm diameter), gravel (3-60 mm), coarse sand (1-3 mm), fine sand (0.25-1 mm), silt (<0.25 mm), hard clay or peat in each plot. The frequency of the various substratum types was calculated from these recordings. Stream width was measured at each transect and averaged to give the mean width of the stream reach. Stream water alkalinity was determined by potentiometric end-point titration with HCL on 100 ml samples of stream water (Hutchinson, 1957) . The macrophyte, depth and substratum data were further processed into broader categories to enable comparison with the STAR dataset that were sampled using the AQEM \u2044 STAR site protocol and the MTR protocol (available at http://www.eu-star.at under 'Protocols'). This approach was also used previously with reliable results (Baattrup- Pedersen et al., 2004) .",

(Table 4 ). These three groups were excluded from further analysis. Group 1 was species rich (25 species), consisting primarily of amphibious (n = 5) and terrestrial (n = 18) species which are able to grow emergent within streams ( Table 4 ). The terrestrial species included both tall monocots and smaller dicots. The most common species in group 1 were associated with the landwater ecotone, namely, Phalaris arundinacea L. (found in 57% of the streams sites), Myosotis spp. (51%), Berula erecta (Hudson) (40%) and Glyceria maxima (Hartman) (29%). Group 3 was predominated by primarily submerged species such as Sparganium emersum Rehman (83%), Elodea canadensis L. C. Rich (54%), Callitriche sp. (44%) and Ranunculus sp. (43%). Two amphibious species (S. erectum L., 59% and Veronica anagallis-aquatica L., 49%) were also important species within this group, whereas terrestrial species had a more scattered occurrence. Group 4 was predominated by amphibious and terrestrial species, but submerged species, such as P. perfoliatus L. and Myriophyllum spicatum L., were also present. Similar to group 1, the most common species in group 4 (i.e. Mentha aquatica L., 35%, Equisetum fluviatile L., 25% and Iris pseudocaris L., 19%) were associated with the land-water ecotone. Group 5 consisted of Potamogeton praelongus Wulf., Carex hirta L., Juncus bulbosus L., Poa pratensis L. 7",

However, more importantly we found from species-based predictions even higher similarity before intense human land use commenced in Denmark around 1900. The historic stream sites resembled the contemporary sites from principally Latvia and Lithuania. Therefore stream sites within these countries can be considered in a Danish reference network. The species-based prediction approach used here likely provides the best estimation of the similarity of the contemporary stream vegetation in the Baltic region and Poland with the historic vegetation in Denmark. First, predictions were based on the co-occurrence of several species as opposed to comparisons based on presence \u2044 absence of individual species. Interpretation of the historic data is thus less affected by low and variable sampling effort and different sampling methodologies compared to those used today. Both differences in sample effort and methodology are often considered to limit the use of historic data. Second, species used in predictions comprised both disturbance-insensitive species that are currently widely distributed (e.g. E. canadensis, S. emersum and B. erecta) and disturbance-sensitive species that have undergone marked declines (e.g. P. alpinus, Butomus umbellatus L. and A. plantagoaquatica: Riis & Sand-Jensen, 2001; Baattrup-Pedersen et al., 2004) .

This zone is particularly well developed in highly mobile streams located in regions with glacio-fluvial outwash plains and sandy soils which are typical of western Denmark. We found that the group 1 assemblage was similar to the Myriophyllum-community described by Riis et al. (2000) , with the concurrent presence of Glyceria fluitans (L.) R. Br., P. natans L. and Myriophyllum alterniflorum DC. The Myriophyllum-community has been found to be closely associated with low alkalinity in Danish streams (Riis et al., 2000) . Earlier studies have shown how differences in physiology and use of bicarbonate and \u2044 or carbon dioxide in photosynthesis affect the distribution of macrophytes in streams (Riis et al., 2000; Dodkins, Rippey & Hale, 2005; Feijoo & Lombardo, 2007) . We suggest that the decline in the abundance of group 1 species from the western part of Denmark to the eastern parts in Latvia and Lithuania is associated with changes in stream water alkalinity.

These distribution patterns have been attributed to habitat degradation (eutrophication and hydromorphological impairment) leading to spatial restrictions, and future projections indicate further declines if habitats continue to be become impaired (Riis & Sand-Jensen, 2002) . The decline in the abundance of group 5 species from Poland and the Baltic region to Denmark is therefore likely associated with differences in Reference vegetation in northern Europe 1899 the intensity of human impacts on the stream integrity, a finding that is also supported by the close association of this group with the historic data (discussed below).",

In particular, we were able to identify groups 4 and 5 that were closely associated with the species-predicted site scores of the historic records. These groups could therefore contribute to the guiding image for the identification of potential reference sites within Denmark. Furthermore, we propose that this assemblage-based approach can be a valuable supplement to other approaches, such as the use screening criteria for pressures or impacts (CIS 2.3 REFCOND) or the use of the best available sites as surrogates for the true reference condition. Thus by integrating macrophyte assemblages in the screening for potential reference sites, the weaknesses associated with the use of thresholds for pressures or impacts that are poorly documented is reduced. In addition, a combined approach probably also gives the most reliable description of the reference assemblages. Many species that were formerly widespread are now found in marginal habitats (Riis & Sand-Jensen, 2002; Baattrup-Pedersen et al., 2004) and their dispersal within and among stream systems is most likely restricted. Therefore, these species may not be present locally in reaches that have suitable environmental conditions and fulfil screening thresholds simply because of regional declines. Neglecting these species would result in a distorted description of reference assemblages, thereby affecting stream assessments.",
