            "text": "Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is associated with exposure to traumatic events\nresulting in a state of psychological unbalance (Blake et al., 1995). Medical staff,\nincluding nurses, are more likely to be in environments that increase their\nsensitivity to PTSD (Tang et\nal., 2017; Wu et al.,\n2009). Another consistent issue of the nursing industry is the workforce\nshortage and high turnover rates. Particularly in Korea, less than 50% of registered\nnurses are actively working, and the average turnover rate is 12.4%, with a rate of\n34% for newly graduated nurses (Ministry of Health and Welfare, 2018). Prior studies on the relationship\nbetween post-traumatic stress and turnover intention reported strong associations\namong nurses working in emergency rooms (Han & Lee, 2013; Maeng & Sung, 2015). Many other\nfactors, including socio-demographic factors, organizational commitment, perceived\nadvancement opportunities, job and career satisfaction, salary level, and workplace\nrelationships and support, have also been found to influence turnover intention\n(Ayalew et al., 2015;\nBrunetto et al., 2013;\nY. Kim & Kang,\n2015; Laschinger,\n2012; Oyeleye et al.,\n2013; Takase et al.,\n2016). However, workplace relationships and support, especially\nsupervisor support, have been proven to be strong buffers on work-related traumatic\nstress, work-related stress, and turnover (LaRocco et al., 1980; Stephens & Long, 2000); supervisor\nsupport has shown to be positively associated with job and career satisfaction\n(Nissly et al.,\n2005).",
