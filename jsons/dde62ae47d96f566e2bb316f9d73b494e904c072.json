We aimed to describe the causes of organ failure and mortality related to gastrectomy for gastric cancer and to identify patients with POF who are at a risk of failure to rescue (FTR). Methods The study examined patients with POF or in-hospital mortality in Seoul National University Hospital between 2005 and 2014. We identified patients at a high risk of FTR by analyzing laboratory findings, complication data, intensive care unit records, and risk scoring including Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) IV, Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score, and Simplified Acute Physiology Score (SAPS) 3 at ICU admission. Results Among the 7304 patients who underwent gastrectomy, 80 (1.1%) were identified with Clavien-Dindo classification (CDC) grade C IVa. The numbers of patients with CDC grade IVa, IVb, and V were 48 (0.66%), 11 (0.15%), and 21 (0.29%), respectively. Pulmonary failure (43.8%), surgical site complication (27.5%), and cardiac failure (13.8%) were the most common causes of POF and mortality. Cancer progression (100%) and cardiac events (45.5%) showed high FTR rates. In univariate analysis, acidosis, hypoalbuminemia, SOFA, APACHE IV, and SAPS 3 were identified as risk factors for FTR (P \\ 0.05). Finally, SAPS 3 was identified as an independent predictive factor for FTR. Conclusions Cancer progression and acute cardiac failure were the most lethal causes of FTR. SAPS 3 is an independent predictor of FTR among POF patients after gastrectomy.",

In addition, grade IVa is defined as single organ dysfunction requiring dialysis, or mechanical ventilation, and grade IVb refers to multiple organ failure. Grade V is defined as the complication-related death of patients. In previous reports, the rates of grade IV and V complications were 0.6-1.1% and 0.1-0.5%, respectively [6, 11] . In most other studies addressing postoperative complications after gastrectomy for gastric cancer, grade IV complication rates have not been specifically mentioned [3] [4] [5] .

Based on this classification and clinical relevance and frequency of occurrence, we allocated the cases based on the causes of organ failure and mortality into six categories with slight modifications: pulmonary failure (pneumonia, prolonged ventilator assistance, pulmonary edema, pulmonary thromboembolism, pneumothorax); surgical site complications (hemorrhage and surgical site infection); cardiac complication (myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, arrhythmia, and unexplained cardiac arrest); cerebrovascular complications (stroke); cancer progression; and other complications (urinary tract infection and suicide). Three attending surgeons (HJ Lee, JH Park, and SY Oh) independently reviewed all medical records including ICU data and determined the cause of organ failure and death. In case of disagreement, the medical record was reviewed by the entire committee. After discussion, a final consensus on the cause of organ failure and death was reached.",

In this context, we conducted a cohort-based study using large-volume data to be able to describe the causes of organ failure and mortality related to gastrectomy. In addition to comparing outcomes between the rescued and FTR patients, we assessed the risks for in-hospital death. Severe complications (CDC grade C IV) developed in only 1.1% of the patients. The characteristics of these patients were heterogenous in terms of demographics, underlying diseases, and complications. The main causes of organ failure and death were pulmonary failure and surgical site complications that accounted for more than 70%. On the other hand, in relation to the grouped number of patients with organ failure, pulmonary failure had the lowest mortality rate among the five groups. SAPS 3 risk scoring was the most powerful predictor for FTR in ICU patients. The mortality rate after gastrectomy in this study was 0.29%. The literature reports operative mortality rates that range from 0 to 13%, with higher mortality rates in Western studies (the least reported at 4%) [3-5, 8, 9, 14, 22-25] . The most recently published East Asian, multicenter, randomized controlled trials have reported a very low mortality rate of less than 0.5% [3, 24, 25] , which was similar to that seen in our study.

If it involved two or more organ systems, it is defined as multiple organ failure, which is the most common cause of death in the surgical ICU [26] . Most studies on postsurgical morbidity focused on major complications (more than CDC grade III) and mortality. However, there was no analysis of specific details published with a focus on organ failure (grade IV) with or without consecutive mortality (grade V) after gastrectomy for gastric cancer. In this study, we investigated the characteristics of patients with organ failure after gastrectomy. Compared to our previous two studies that dealt with the association of underlying diseases and complications after gastrectomy [27, 28] , we found a higher prevalence of comorbidities (83.8%, 67/80) that was associated with the development of organ failure. In particular, the proportion of hepatic, pulmonary, cardiac, renal, and neurological underlying diseases were highly related to the patients' vitality. Among the complications, all patients had systemic complications, and the rate of surgical complications such as bleeding or leakage was also high.",

Surgical site complications and pulmonary failure were common causes of mortality in that study. In our study, organ failure was caused by pulmonary failure, surgical site complication, cardiac complication, and cerebrovascular complications, sequentially. Whereas pulmonary failure had a mortality of 8.6%, mortality rate according to the cause of organ failure was the highest in cancer progression (100%), followed by cardiac complications and surgical site infections. These results can be mainly explained by sudden cardiac death, myocardial infarction, and sepsis caused by surgical site infection. In particular, surgical site infections influenced organ failure included bowel leakage, intraperitoneal abscess, bile leakage, and gallbladder abscess.",

Many prognostic models exist, suggesting that the optimum model has not been established. In particular, few studies have applied risk scoring systems to ICU patients with gastric cancer. The most commonly used adult ICU prognostic scoring systems are APACHE and SAPS. Major revisions of these models were published between 2005 and 2006, namely APACHE IV in 2006 and SAPS 3 in 2005 [18, 20] . Moreover, the SOFA score is used to track a patient's status during the stay in an ICU to determine the organ function or rate of failure. In this study, we analyzed these three systems and SAPS 3 was most useful in predicting FTR among gastric cancer patients with organ failure. Unlike other systems, SAPS 3 includes data regarding the anatomical site of surgery, presence of acute infection at ICU admission, and vasoactive drug therapy before ICU admission (Table 1) . These factors might contribute to the accuracy of the analysis of gastric cancer patients. Future studies are needed to evaluate the role of risk scoring or benchmarking, performance improvement, resource use, and clinical decision support. According to the SAPS 3 system, the patient prognosis factor can be divided into three categories: (a) previous medical/surgical history, (b) the circumstances of ICU admission, and (c) the degree and presence of physiologic dysfunction, and the prognostic value to resuscitate in each category is 50%, 22.5%, and 27.5%, respectively [20] . More than half of the risk for mortality is already determined when a patient is admitted to the ICU. In order to reduce mortality, it is advisable to correct physiologic indices when a high risk of mortality is suspected as soon as possible and perform prompt assessments to identify patient status. In this system, mortality differs in the etiology for ICU admission; transient organ failure shows a better chance of recovery compared to definite conditions such as intracranial mass or severe pancreatitis.",

Univariate analysis was conducted to evaluate the association of each factor with FTR. The identified risk factors for FTR were adjusted by multivariate logistic regression. For this purpose, significant variables (P \\ 0.05) in the univariate analysis were entered into the multivariate analysis. In multivariate analysis, the adjusted odds ratios (exponential beta) were calculated with a 95% confidence interval (CI). All tests were two-sided and performed at a significance level of 5% using IBM \u00d2 SPSS \u00d2 Statistics version 20 (IBM Corporation, Armonk, NY, USA). 85% of the patients received an American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) score of 2 or higher (ASA I:II:III = 11:55:13). In terms of tumor invasion, advanced gastric cancer occurred more frequently than did early gastric cancer, and more than half of the patients (53.7%, 43/80) had lymph node metastasis.
