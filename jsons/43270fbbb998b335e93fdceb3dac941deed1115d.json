Ferrets have been used for hunting and fur production, as pets, and as models in biomedical research. Despite the relatively small numbers used in the laboratory, ferrets have some unique applications including study of human influenza and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-associated corona virus. They have served as models for peptic ulcer disease, carotenoid metabolism, cystic fibrosis, and drug emesis screening, among others. Most research ferrets are males, due to estrus-related health problems in females. They may be housed conventionally and are easy to care for when their biology and behavior are understood. Due to the small number of ferret suppliers, animals are often shipped long distances, requiring air transport and intermediate handlers. It is important to minimize shipment stress, especially with weanling and pregnant animals. Additional expertise is required for success with pregnant and whelping ferrets and for rearing of neonates. The animals have specific dietary requirements, and proper nutrition is key. Successful housing requires knowledge of ferret behaviors including social behavior, eating habits, a general inquisitive nature, and a species-typical need to burrow and hide. Regular handling is necessary to maintain well-being. A ferret health care program consists of physical examination, immunization, clinical pathology, and a working knowledge of common ferret diseases. Various research methodologies have been described, from basic procedures such as blood collection to major invasive survival surgery. Ferrets have a distinct niche in biomedical research and are hardy animals that thrive well in the laboratory.",

For example, if ferrets are approached while sleeping, it often takes approximately 15 to 30 sec for them to become fully roused. To an inexperienced observer, it may initially appear that the ferret is severely depressed or even comatose. However, this behavior should be considered normal unless it persists. In addition, ferrets often express a shivering behavior that does not necessarily indicate ill health. Although the reason for this behavior is unknown, it may be observed when the ferret awakens from sleep or becomes excited. Finally, if a ferret is restrained by the scruff of the neck, it will often yawn as its body relaxes. Again, the significance of this particular behavioral response is unknown, but handlers should be aware that it is normal (Boyce et al. 2001) .",

When weak or lethargic, regardless of cause, ferrets will lose this arch causing the back to become parallel with the horizontal plane. This posture results in some degree of ataxia of the rear quarters and may be a nonspecific sign.

For example, when ferrets are used in an acute surgical procedure, it may be necessary to handle them only for a preanesthetic physi-cal examination and for injection of a sedative or anesthetic induction agent. For survival surgery, especially for major invasive procedures, extensive handling is required, which includes preoperative blood work and daily postoperative observations and treatments. Regardless, the key to successful nonstressful handling is acclimation of the ferret to whatever method of restraint will be required.

Ferrets may be retrieved from their cage in this manner or carried to a treatment table and then scruffed because the flat solid surface of the examination table facilitates grasping the ferret. As stated above (see Physical Examination), this method of restraint often produces a relaxation response that is accompanied by a yawn. It is useful for examination, oral dosing, or administration of injections. Another effective and nonstressful method of restraint involves tucking the ferret \"head first\" against one's waist using the crook of one's arm. Hugging the ferret in this manner appears to offer them security, which minimizes resistance.

Isoflurane anesthesia is often preferred, but numerous sedative and anesthetic protocols, both injectable and inhalation, have been reported (Fox 1998, Ch. 19; Mullen and Beeber 2000; Quesenberry and Carpenter 2004, Ch. 33) .",

Because of ferret gastrointestinal physiology (see Dietary Requirements) , the preoperative fast interval should be short (\u223c 3 hr), especially for compromised subjects. Due to their small body size, pediatric endotracheal tubes are needed as well as a nonrebreathing system for inhalational anesthesia. Intraoperative monitoring (e.g., pulse oximetry and capnography) has been described (Olin et al. 1997) . Postperative analgesics should be used preemptively and routinely, and a description of analgesic options is available (Fox 1998, Ch. 19 ). Techniques such as epidural narcotic administration have been assessed (Sladky et al. 2000) . Ferrets are prone to hypothermia, especially during prolonged procedures. Use of warmed fluids and circulating warm water heating pads help prevent loss of body temperature (Fox 1998, Ch. 19) .",

Knowledge of ferret behavior will guide the use of social housing and environmental enrichment devices that encourage species-typical behaviors. High-quality ferret diets are commercially available and satisfy the unique nutritional needs of ferrets, including young or pregnant animals. As with other conventionally reared species, a good health care program is composed of an immunization protocol, routine health assessments, and knowledge of common ferret diseases. If breeding the animals is required for the research, all aspects of ferret breeding may be successfully accomplished in the laboratory with sufficient training in the particulars of ferret reproductive biology.",
