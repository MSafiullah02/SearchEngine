            "text": "Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) pneumonia causes high mortality rates (67%). 1, 2 While it reduces the production of IFN-a and IFN-b, 3 -5 IFN-a inhibits the MERS-CoVinduced cytopathic response and viral replication, 6 particularly with ribavirin. 7 IFN-a2b and ribavirin were effective in macaques when administered 8 h after inoculation with MERS-CoV. 8 In humans, five patients who received IFN-a2b and ribavirin had 100% mortality, 9 but because administration was delayed in the study it is difficult to interpret the findings. A recent study showed a significant reduction in 14 day, but not 28 day, mortality rates between patients who received IFN-a2a with ribavirin and those who received standard supportive care. 10 Recent in vitro data demonstrated superiority of IFN-b over IFN-a2b and IFN-a2a, with IC 50 values of 1.37, 21.4 and 160.8 U/mL, respectively. 11 This could have major implications for MERS-CoV treatment. In the absence of effective treatment, more data on the use of different types of IFNs to treat MERS-CoV infections are crucial. Moreover, data are needed to identify patients at highest risk of mortality. We aimed to explore the association of plasma MERS-CoV RT-PCR with mortality and to assess and compare the efficacy of IFN-a2a or IFN-b1a with ribavirin to treat MERS-CoV pneumonia.",

Confirming such an association could serve to identify high-risk patients who could be targeted with therapy such as convalescent sera. 15 The lack of effective MERS-CoV treatment has become an impediment. IFN-a2a was chosen due to unavailability of IFN-a2b. This may have played a role in the ineffectiveness of IFN treatment in this cohort, particularly with the lower IC 50 of IFN-a2b for MERS-CoV. 11 A possible reason for the high mortality rate is the old age (\u226550 years) of the majority of patients (20/ 32), which was associated with mortality in this and a previous cohort. 2 IFN treatment in MERS-CoV ribavirin significantly reduced MERS-CoV-associated mortality at 14 days, but not 28 days, when compared with standard supportive care. 10 However, there were no patients with end-stage renal disease in that study. There was no difference in survival between the IFN-a2a and the IFN-b1a groups in our cohort ( Figure S2) . Additionally, the absence of fever in 5/32 patients with MERS-CoV pneumonia questions the validity of the WHO and CDC definitions of probable MERS-CoV infections, which include fever. 12, 13 These patients' inability to mount a fever could signal an impaired immune response, and they represent a high-risk group, evidenced by their poor outcome. Therefore, absence of fever should not preclude testing for MERS-CoV once suspected. Six healthcare workers were infected with MERS-CoV; the absence of mortality among them is probably related to the lack of risk factors in these patients. They were all ,50 years of age and none had impaired renal function. The observed high number of initial negative NP swabs may be related to poor collection technique. However, lower viral loads in NP swabs compared with sputum and tracheal aspirate samples on quantitative RT -PCR testing remains the most likely explanation. 16 Therefore, negative NP swabs should not rule out MERS-CoV infections without testing lower respiratory tract samples. Finally, determining the duration of viral shedding in survivors of MERS-CoV infections has valuable implications for infection control.",
