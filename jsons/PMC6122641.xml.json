Since the first description of MRVs in the 1950s [2], they have been thoroughly studied not only from the genetics and structure perspectives, but also in terms of their epidemiology and pathogenicity [1]. They were initially isolated from the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts in humans, but were rarely associated with severe medical conditions [2]. In the past few years, there have been several reports of novel MRV variants that can cause severe illness, such as haemorrhagic enteritis, upper respiratory tract infections and encephalitis, in humans and other animals [3, 4].",

Neutralisation and haemagglutinin activities are restricted to the S1 gene segment [6], which encodes the \u03c31 protein that is located on the outer capsid of the virion. The \u03c31 protein is responsible for viral attachment to cellular receptors, and it defines the MRV serotype [7]. The other genome segments show no correlations to viral serotype, which suggests that MRVs evolved independently of their serotypes [8]. The segmented nature of the MRV genome poses risks for the formation of novel reassortant viruses with unpredictable biological properties. Indeed, isolation of reassortant MRVs has been described previously [9\u201313].",

The genome nucleotide sequence of isolate SI-MRV01 shared more than 97% identity with MRVs that were isolated at the same time from bats of the genera Pipistrellus spp. and Myotis spp. in Italy and Germany [14, 15]. These were the first reports of non-pteropine MRVs in bats. Both of these bat genera are also present in Slovenia. Isolate SI-MRV01 was also the first reported bat MRV variant found in humans. More recently, a MRV with high similarity to SI-MRV01 was detected in an immunocompromised child in Switzerland [16]. Based on the literature data, we consider that isolate SI-MRV01 and other similar isolates represent novel zoonotic MRV variants that are present in European bats. To date, the biological characteristics of this virus have not been investigated in detail.",

This might at least partially explain the enzootic properties of the novel MRV, as well as its zoonotic potential. Most of the MRV-positive guano samples were recorded in 2010. Moreover, all of the positives from 2010 shared 99% nucleotide identity for the partial L3 genome segment with the isolate SI-MRV01, and no scores other than isolate SI-MRV01 were obtained. This was relatively surprising for us, in terms of one year that stands out so evidently for MRV positives. This one year of high prevalence can be explained as a probable outbreak of the SI-MRV01-like isolate among the bat populations. According to our data, the outbreak was not limited to one sampling location nor to one bat species, as in 2010, positive samples were detected for eight out of 17 sampling sites across Slovenia. However, this prediction of a single-strain outbreak was based on the partial L3 genome segment analysis, which does not guarantee identical strains in all of these positive bat species. As shown in previous studies [9\u201313], and as also confirmed in the present study, MRVs are genetically diverse, with frequent reassortments that can result in different strain variants. Thus, this one-segment comparison between these strains might not reflect the same situation for the genome similarity in other genome segments.",

On the contrary, the other female groups (i.e., adults, juveniles) had lower prevalence of MRV RNA, with no positives in the gestating females. The group of lactating female bats was also the largest group, as it represented approximately 50% of all of the tested female bats, and was more than the adult and juvenile male bats combined. The relative high prevalence in these lactating female bats might be due to the grouping of the lactating females in nurseries, where contact transmission of the virus might be more frequent.

However, the serotypes of the isolates in the present study were predicted through phylogenetic clustering, and so they do not reflect antigen reactivities of serotype-specific antibodies. Moreover, to the best of our knowledge, there has not been any precise characterisation study of the antigen epitopes of the S1 protein, which might make reliable serotype characterisation based on nucleotide and/or amino-acid sequence identities possible.

We would expect that the circulation of isolates similar to SI-MRV01 would also have been very common in 2012, when this SI-MRV01 infection of the child occurred. However, no positives similar to isolate SI-MRV01 were detected in the present testing of the guano samples from 2012. This might be due to the sampling of the wrong bat target population, or alternatively, the circulation of this virus in 2012 was relatively low and the infection of the child happened by chance. Another factor that might have contributed to detection of a lack of isolates similar to SI-MRV01 in 2012 was the limited number of guano samples that year, which was almost half the number of samples in each of the other 3 years considered here (i.e., 2008, 2009, 2010). However, strain SI-MRV01 might have been circulating already in some other mammals, and it might also have been transmitted to the child through close contact with other domestic animals.

Moreover, according to genetic characterisation of S1 genome segment, all three MRV serotypes were present in the bat population. In this study, five independent MRV isolates were obtained and detailed whole-genome analysis revealed high diversity between them. This study generates new information about the epidemiology and molecular characteristics of emerging bat MRV variants, and provides important molecular data for further studies of their pathogenesis and evolution.",

            "text": "Bat guano was obtained from the Veterinary Faculty, University of Ljubljana. Analysis of bat guano was performed as described by Rihtaric et al. [20]. Briefly, the samples were collected individually from clinically healthy bats in bat roosting sites, from May to October. The bats were sampled mostly in the last gravidity phase of female bats and in the time, when juveniles were old enough to feed by themselves. This periods differ among bat species, for example at the end of June the juveniles of M. myotis were quite grown-up, but the females of R. hipposideros were only in a phase of delivery. The bats were classified by bat biologists from Centre for Cartography Fauna and Flora, Slovenia according to species, gender, age, gravidity and lactation status, and typed morphological criteria. The bat biologist determined bat species exclusively based on morphologic criteria (without biopsy and genetic classification) [18]. Bats age was estimated based on bats weight, ulnar length and colour of the fur [21]. Altogether, there were 68 sampling sites that were distributed throughout all 8 Slovenian regions (Osrednjeslovenska, Gorenjska, Gori\u0161ka, Primorska, Dolenjska, Savinjska, Podravska, Pomurska), with 18 bat species identified. The sampling sites for individual sampling could be very close together but within the same region. There might be minor differences in the individual sampling year (for instance, region Gorenjska was included only in 2009) but throughout the study all 8 regions were represented. (see Additional file 2). For 47 samples, the sampling locations and bat characteristics were not known. Altogether, 443 individual and eight pooled guano samples were analysed (Table 1, Additional file 3). The eight pooled samples consisted of two to seven individual bat samples. Hence, guano from 466 bats was included in the analysis. To carry out this sampling and the disturbance of protected bat species, a permit was obtained from the Slovenian Environment Agency (contracts no. 35701\u201380/2004, 35,601\u201335/2010\u20136). The samples were analysed retrospectively from the sampling years of 2008, 2009, 2010 and 2012.",

The guano samples for virus isolation were selected based on the following criteria: (i) sequences of partial L3 genome segment in BLASTn scored as an MRV strain, or bat MRV-specific real-time RT-PCR resulted in cycle threshold (Ct) value < 34; (ii) if more samples scored as the same MRV strain (i.e., nearly 100% nucleotide sequence similarity), only a few guano samples were selected for the virus isolation. Guano suspensions were vortexed and centrifuged at 9000 x g for 10 min to obtain clear supernatants. From these supernatants, 150 \u03bcL was transferred to 1.5 mL Eagle\u2019s minimum essential medium. The inoculum was passed through 0.2 \u03bcm filters and transferred to an 80% confluent cell monolayer. The cells were incubated for 1 h at 37 \u00b0C and 5% CO2, to allow the binding of the viruses to the cells. After this incubation, the inoculum was discarded from the cell layer, and 7 mL Eagle\u2019s minimum essential medium with 10% foetal bovine serum was added. The cells were further incubated under conditions specified above, and observed daily for the development of the cytopathic effect, for 14 days. After the onset of the cytopathic effect, the viruses were harvested as follows: after two freeze/ thaw cycles of the infected cell cultures and centrifugation of the cell debris, the total virus was harvested and stored at \u2212 80 \u00b0C. In the absence of the cytopathic effect, the cryolysates were sub-cultured twice onto fresh monolayers. Virus isolates from cell cultures were examined under electron microscopy after negative staining with 2% phosphotungstic acid (pH 4.5). Electron micrograph grids were screened at 120 kV in a transmission electron microscope (JEM 1400 Plus; Jeol, Tokyo, Japan). Viral particles were identified based on their morphological characteristics. For safety reasons, handling with bat guanos and propagation of viruses isolated from bat guanos was performed at Biosafety Level 3 at the Institute of Microbiology and Immunology (Faculty of Medicine, University of Ljubljana).",
