Upon cell entry, the genomic RNA is translated to produce nonstructural proteins (nsps) from two open reading frames (ORFs), ORF1a and ORF1b. The ORF1a produces polypeptide 1a (pp1a, 440-500 kDa) that is cleaved into 11 nsps. The \u00c01 ribosome frameshift occurs immediately upstream of the ORF1a stop codon, which allows continued translation of ORF1b, yielding a large polypeptide (pp1ab, 740-810 kDa) which is cleaved into 15 nsps. The proteolytic cleavage is mediated by viral proteases nsp3 and nsp5 that harbor a papain-like protease domain and a 3C-like protease domain, respectively.",

Shorter sgRNAs encode conserved structural proteins (spike protein [S] , envelope protein [E], membrane protein [M] , and nucleocapsid protein [N] ), and several accessory proteins. SARS-CoV-2 is known to have at least six accessory proteins (3a, 6, 7a, 7b, 8, and 10) according to the current annotation (GenBank: NC_045512.2).

According to the prevailing model, leader-to-body fusion occurs during negative-strand synthesis at short motifs called transcription-regulatory sequences (TRSs) that are located immediately adjacent to ORFs (Figure 1 ). TRSs contain a conserved 6-7 nt core sequence (CS) surrounded by variable sequences. During negative-strand synthesis, RdRP pauses when it crosses a TRS in the body (TRS-B) and switches the template to the TRS in the leader (TRS-L), which results in discontinuous transcription leading to the leader-body fusion. From the fused negative-strand intermediates, positive-strand mRNAs are transcribed. The replication and transcription mechanism has been studied in other coronaviruses. However, it is unclear whether the general mechanism also applies to SARS-CoV-2 and if there are any unknown components in the SARS-CoV-2 transcriptome. For the development of diagnostic and therapeutic tools and the understanding of this new virus, it is critical to define the organization of the SARS-CoV-2 genome.",

The ''sequencing-by-synthesis (SBS)'' methods such as the Illumina and MGI platforms confer high accuracy and coverage. However, they are limited by short read length (200-400 nt) , so the fragmented sequences should be re-assembled computationally, during which the haplotype information is lost. More recently introduced is the nanoporebased direct RNA sequencing (DRS) approach. Although nanopore DRS is limited in sequencing accuracy, it enables longread sequencing, which would be particularly useful for the analysis of long nested CoV transcripts. Moreover, because DRS detects RNA instead of cDNA, the RNA modification information can be obtained directly during sequencing (Garalde et al., 2018) . Numerous RNA modifications have been found to control eukaryotic RNAs and viral RNAs (Williams et al., 2019) . Terminal RNA modifications such as RNA tailing also play a critical role in cellular and viral RNA regulation (Warkocki et al., 2018) .",

            "text": "To delineate the SARS-CoV-2 transcriptome, we first performed DRS runs on a MinION nanopore sequencer with total RNA extracted from Vero cells infected with SARS-CoV-2 (Be-taCoV/Korea/KCDC03/2020). The virus was isolated from a patient who was diagnosed with COVID-19 on January 26, 2020, after traveling from Wuhan, China (Kim et al., 2020) . We obtained 879,679 reads from infected cells (corresponding to a throughput of 1.9 Gb) ( Figure 2A ). The majority (65.4%) of the reads mapped to SARS-CoV-2, indicating that viral transcripts dominate the transcriptome while the host gene expression is strongly suppressed. Although nanopore DRS has the 3 0 bias due to directional sequencing from the 3 0 ends of RNAs, approximately half of the viral reads still contained the 5 0 leader. The SARS-CoV-2 genome was almost fully covered, missing only 12 nt from the 5 0 end due to the known inability of DRS to sequence the terminal $12 nt ( Figure 2B ). The longest tags (111 reads) correspond to the full-length gRNA ( Figure 2B ). The coverage of the 3 0 side of the viral genome is substantially higher than that of the 5 0 side, which reflects the nested sgRNAs. (A) Frequency of discontinuous mappings in the long reads from the DNB-seq data. The color indicates the number of reads with large gaps spanning between two genomic positions (starting from a coordinate in the x axis and ending in a coordinate in the y axis). The counts were aggregated into 100-nt bins for both axes. The red asterisk on the x axis indicates the column containing the leader TRS. Please note that the leftmost column was expanded horizontally on this heatmap to improve visualization. The red dots on the sub-plot alongside the y axis denote local peaks which coincide with the 5 0 end of the body of each sgRNA. (B) Transcript abundance was estimated by counting the DNBseq reads that span the junction of the corresponding RNA. (C) Top 50 sgRNAs. The asterisk indicates an ORF beginning at 27,825 that may encode the 7b protein with an N-terminal truncation of 23 amino acids. The gray bars denote minor transcripts that encode proteins with an N-terminal truncation compared with the corresponding overlapping transcript. The black bars indicate minor transcripts that encode proteins in a different reading frame from the overlapping major mRNA. This is also partly due to the 3 0 bias of the directional DRS technique. The common presence of the leader sequence (72 nt) in viral RNAs results in a prominent coverage peak at the 5 0 end, as expected. We could also clearly detect vertical drops in the coverage, whose positions correspond to the leaderbody junction in sgRNAs. All known sgRNAs are supported by DRS reads, with an exception of ORF10 (see below).",

The results are overall consistent with the DRS data. The leader-body junctions are frequently sequenced, giving rise to a sharp peak at the 5 0 end in the coverage plot ( Figure 2D ). The 3 0 end exhibits a high coverage as expected for the nested transcripts. The depth of DNB-seq allowed us to confirm and examine the junctions on an unprecedented scale for a CoV genome. We mapped the 5 0 and 3 0 breakpoints at the junctions and estimated the fusion frequency by counting the reads spanning the junctions ( Figure 3A ). The leader represents the most prominent 5 0 site, as expected ( Figure 3A , red asterisk on the x axis). The known TRS-Bs are detected as the top 3 0 sites (Figure 3A, red dots on the y axis). These results confirm that SARS-CoV-2 uses the canonical TRS-mediated template-switching mechanism for discontinuous transcription to produce major sgRNAs ( Figure 3B ). Quantitative comparison of the junctionspanning reads shows that the N RNA is the most abundantly expressed transcript, followed by S, 7a, 3a, 8, M, E, 6, and 7b ( Figure 3C ).",

Although individual RNA species are not abundant, the combined read numbers are often comparable to the levels of accessory transcripts. Most of the RNAs have coding potential to yield proteins. Transcripts that belong to the ''TRS-L-independent distant'' group encode the upstream part of ORF1a, including nsp1, truncated nsp2, and/or truncated nsp3, whose summed abundance is $20% of gRNA. Depending on translation efficiency, the protein products may change the stoichiometry between nsps ( Figure 3F ; Table S4 ). Another notable example is the 7b protein with an N-terminal truncation that may be produced at a level similar to the annotated full-length 7b ( Figure 3C , asterisk). Frameshifted or deleted ORFs may also generate shorter proteins that are distinct from known viral proteins ( Figure 3C ). It will be interesting in the future to examine if these unknown ORFs are actually translated and yield functional products.",

            "text": "As nanopore DRS is based on single-molecule detection of RNA, it offers a unique opportunity to examine multiple epitranscriptomic features of individual RNA molecules. We recently developed software to measure the length of poly(A) tail from DRS data (Y. Choi and H.C., unpublished data). Using this software, we confirm that, like other CoVs, SARS-CoV-2 RNAs carry poly(A) tails ( Figures 4A-4B) . The tail of viral RNAs is 47 nt in median length. The full-length gRNA has a relatively longer tail than sgRNAs. Notably, sgRNAs have two tail populations: a minor peak at $30 nt and a major peak at $45 nt ( Figure 4B, arrowheads) . Wu et al. (2013) previously observed that the poly(A) tail length of bovine CoV mRNAs changes during infection: from $45 nt immediately after virus entry to $65 nt at 6-9 hours post-infection and $30 nt at 120-144 hours post-infection. Thus, the short tails of $30 nt observed in this study may represent aged RNAs that are prone to decay. Viral RNAs exhibit a homogeneous length distribution, unlike host nuclear genome-encoded mRNAs ( Figure 4C ). The distribution is similar to that of mitochondrial chromosome-encoded RNAs whose tail is generated by MTPAP (Tomecki et al., 2004) . It was recently shown that HCoV-229E nsp8 has an adenylyltransferase activity, which may extend poly(A) tail of viral RNA (Tvarogov\u00e1 et al., 2019) . Because poly(A) tail should be constantly attacked by host deadenylases, the regulation of viral RNA tailing is likely to be important for the maintenance of genome integrity. Poly(A) tail of mRNA is also generally critical for stability control and translation through its interaction with poly(A) binding proteins (PABPs). Cytoplasmic PABPs facilitate deadenylation by the CCR4-NOT complex while blocking untimely decay by exosome and uridylation machinery. PABPs also interact with translation initiation factors to allow translation. Thus, the viral tail is likely to play multiple roles for translation, decay, and replication.",

Viral RNA modification was first described more than 40 years ago (Gokhale and Horner, 2017) . N6-methyladenosine (m6A) is the most widely observed modification (Courtney et al., 2017; Gokhale et al., 2016; Krug et al., 1976; Lichinchi et al., 2016; Narayan et al., 1987) , but other modifications have also been reported on viral RNAs, including 5-methylcytosine methylation (5mC), 2 0 -O-methylation (Nm), deamination, and terminal uridylation. In a recent analysis of HCoV-229E using DRS, modification calling suggested frequent 5mC signal across viral RNAs (Viehweger et al., 2019) . However, because no direct control group was included in the analysis, the proposed modification needed validation. To unambiguously investigate the modifications, we generated negative control RNAs by in vitro transcription of the viral sequences and performed a DRS run on these unmodified controls ( Figure S4A ). The partially overlapping control RNAs are $2.3 kb or $4.4 kb each and cover the entire length of the genome ( Figure S4B ). Detection using pre-trained models reported numerous signal level changes corresponding to 5mC modification, even with the unmodified controls ( Figure S4C ). We obtained highly comparable results from the viral RNAs from infected cells ( Figure S4D) . Thus, the 5mC sites detected without a control are likely to be false positives.",

These results suggest a link between the internal modification and 3 0 end tail. Because poly(A) tail plays an important role in RNA turnover, it is tempting to speculate that the observed internal modification is involved in viral RNA stability control. It is also plausible that RNA modification is a mechanism to evade host immune response. The type of modification(s) is yet to be identified, although we can exclude METTL3-mediated m6A (for lack of consensus motif RRACH), ADAR-mediated deamination (for lack of A-to-G sequence change in the DNBseq data), and m1A (for lack of the evidence for RT stop).

Unambiguous mapping of the expressed sgRNAs and ORFs is a prerequisite for the functional investigation of viral proteins, replication mechanism, and host-viral interactions involved in pathogenicity. An in-depth analysis of the joint reads revealed a highly complex landscape of viral RNA synthesis. Like other RNA viruses, CoVs undergo frequent recombination, which may allow rapid evolution to change their host/tissue specificity and drug sensitivity. The frequent fusion detected in this study may provide a basis for variant generation and need to be investigated in detail. The new ORFs may serve as accessory proteins that modulate viral replication and host immune response. The RNA modifications may also contribute to viral survival and immune evasion in infected tissues as the innate immune system is known to be less sensitive to RNAs with nucleoside modification (Karik\u00f3 et al., 2005) . These new molecular features will need to be studied further in animal tissues and cell types that have an intact interferon system. It is also yet to be examined if the ORFs and RNA modifications are unique to SARS-CoV-2 or conserved in other coronaviruses. Comparative studies on their distribution and functional significance will help us to gain a deeper understanding of SARS-CoV-2 and coronaviruses in general.

The survived alignments filtered again intersecting with the region 29850-29950 to enrich the 3 0 -intact reads. The resulting alignments further filtered so that we only keep alignments with (1) minimum alignment length of 1000 nt excluding insertions or deletions, (2) minimum contiguously mapped length of 50 nt in the 5 0 -most block to suppress noisy short alignments. 250 Randomly chosen alignments passing the criteria were sorted by the 5 0 site position of the largest deletion within each alignment. Alignments without a large gap (R100nt) were ordered by the first mapped coordinate.",
