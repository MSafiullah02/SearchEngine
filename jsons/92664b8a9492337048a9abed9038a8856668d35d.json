In infected human hepatocytes, the HDV RNA genome can replicate and associate with multiple copies of the delta protein to assemble a ribonucleoprotein (RNP). However the RNP cannot exit the cell because of the lack of an export system. This is provided by the HBV envelope proteins, which are capable of budding at an internal cellular membrane to assemble mature HDV virions when RNPs are present. This review covers advances in the molecular aspects of the HDV-HBV interactions, with an emphasis on the HBV properties that are instrumental in HDV maturation, in particular the central role of the small HBV envelope protein.",

Rizzetto , the viral agent that was later referred to as the \"Hepatitis Delta Virus\" (HDV), has been clearly related to the Hepatitis B virus (HBV). HDAg was first observed as a new nuclear antigen present only in liver cells of HBV chronic carriers. It was shown to be associated with a viral agent that was transmissible to chimpanzee in the presence of HBV, and at that time, it was considered a defective virus because of its absolute requirement for HBV coinfection. Soon thereafter the HBV helper functions appeared to be limited to providing the protein content of the delta particle envelope, whereas the inner core was found to contain a small RNA molectile bound to HDAg-proteins. The cloning of the HDV-associated RNA was achieved in 1986, and the sequencing analysis revealed a genome structure that was unique among animal viruses: it was a circular, single-stranded RNA of negative polarity, with an open reading frame coding for the HDAg protein (the only protein that HDV RNA is known to encode), but it lacked the coding capacity for envelope proteins. Moreover, its sequence presented no homology to that of the HBV genome.^'^ ",

They display a chimeric structure: the protein content of the envelope consists of the HBV surface proteins, whereas the inner ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex is made of HDV-specific elements. The HDV RNP is composed of a 1,700 nucleotides single-stranded genomic RNA associated to multiple copies of the HDV encoded delta protein, with a molar ratio of protein to RNA of approximately 200. The delta protein bears the hepatitis delta antigen (HDAg), and it appears under two isoforms: the small form (S-HDAg) is a 195-amino acid polypeptide; and the large form (L-HDAg) is 19 amino acids longer, and it arises as a consequence of a RNA editing event on a replication intermediate of the genome.^'^ HDV RNPs can be examined by electron microscopy after subjecting virions to a nonionic detergent and a reducing agent. They appear as spherical, corelike structures, with no apparent icosahedral symmetry and a diameter of approximately 19 nm. The HDV envelope appears undistinguishable from that of HBV It consists of a lipid membrane in which the three HBV coat proteins carrying the hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), and designated small (S-HBsAg), middle (M-HBsAg) and large (L-HBsAg), are embedded. These proteins are present at a ratio estimated at 95/5/1, respectively, as opposed to 4/1/1 in the envelope of HBV virions (Dane particles).^' Therefore HDV appears to be directly dependant on HBV for acquiring its envelope and, for that reason, it should be considered as a defective virus and a satellite of the latter. It does not fulfill the criteria for the definition of a virus; nonetheless, it is referred to as Hepatitis delta virus (HDV) for practical reason, and it constitutes the only species of the Deltavirus genus. In an infectious serum, HDV particles are present at high titer (up to 10 particles per milliliter) along with different types of HBV particles: the infectious Dane particles and the empty subviral particles. They have a similar outer envelope consisting of the HBV coat proteins.^'",

This has been demonstrated experimentally: the transfection of mammalian cells with a cloned HDV cDNA, in the absence of HBV, leads to replication of the HDV RNA and formation of RNPs, demonstrating that HBV is not essential at this level of the HDV cycle. However, the absence of viral RNA or HDAg proteins in the culture medium of transfected cells indicates that progeny RNPs can not be released. Thus, unlike nonenveloped viruses, which are capable of inducing cell membrane lysis for particle release, and contrary to retroviral nucleocapsids that are capable of budding at the plasma membrane in the absence of envelope proteins, HDV cannot release its RNPs by lack of an export system. When cells are cotransfected with HDV cDNA and a plasmid driving the expression of the HBV envelope proteins (in the absence of HBV replication), the RNPs are released as enveloped virions. HBV assists HDV assembly and secretion by just providing the envelope proteins necessary to assemble export vesicles. Moreover, the L-HBsAg and M-HBsAg are not required for this process.",

            "text": "Overall, the formation of progeny HDV virions involves tw^o processes: (i) assembly of the RNP and (ii) formation of the viral envelope. They are directed by tw^o distinct viral species; they are independent of each other and spatially separated, occurring in the nucleus and at the IC membrane, respectively. Therefore, a critical function that HDV must assume is the targeting of the RNP to the HBV budding system. HDV RNP is composed of the tw^o forms of delta proteins: S-HDAg and L-HDAg (Fig. 5) . Both proteins can interact w^ith each other and the genomic RNA to assemble the HDV RNP complex. It is localized primarily in the nucleus, and it must travel to the cytoplasm for packaging with the envelope proteins. This is determined, in part, by the C-terminal 19 amino-acid polypeptide of L-HDAg, which contains a CXXX signal (where C = cysteine and X = any amino acid) for farnesylation. The farnesyl group probably serves to anchor the RNP in the ER membrane where the envelope proteins assemble, and, as expected, treatment of HDV producing cells with a farnesyl transferase inhibitor prevents assembly of RNPs into enveloped particles. When expressed with the HBV envelope proteins in the absence of HDV RNA and S-HDAg, L-HDAg protein can be packaged and secreted in the subviral particles (Fig. 6 ). The C-terminal 19 amino acids, including the CXXX box are likely to constitute the packaging signal on L-HDAg, since their appending to the C-terminus of a foreign protein, namely c-H-ras, leads to the cosecretion of the latter with HBV subviral particles. Yet, for HDV maturation, it is unclear whether L-HDAg binds to S-HBsAg during budding or beforehand, and whether the free form of L-HDAg associates with the envelope in addition to the RNP-associated form.^ Regarding the role of the S-HBV protein, it is worth noting that the member of the Hepadnaviridae family closest to HBV, the Woodchuck hepatitis virus (WHV), can assist HDV propagation because its S envelope protein (S-WHsAg) is competent for HDV RNP envelopment; whereas the envelope protein of a more distantly related Hepadnaviridae, namely the Duck hepatitis B virus (DHBV), is unable to fulfill this function. Thus determinants that are specific for HDV maturation on the S-HBsAg protein should be present on S-WHsAg and absent on the small DHBV envelope protein (S-DHBsAg). When compared to S-HBsAg or S-WHsAg, the S-DHBsAg polypeptide appears to lack the region corresponding to the antigenic-loop (Fig. 3) . Indeed, when part of this domain (from residues 107 to 147) is experimentally deleted on S-HBsAg, it leads to a reduction in the capacity of the mutant for HDV maturation. Interestingly, the same mutant was fully competent for packaging HDAg-L proteins, suggesting that the hindrance observed in RNP envelopment may reflect a reduced flexibility of the envelope, which could no longer accommodate an RNP, rather than a lack of binding to the RNP. The deficiency in HDV maturation observed with the antigenic-loopdeleted S-HBsAg, or with S-DHBsAg, could also be explained, at least in part, by the absence of a glycosylation site, since the removal of Asn-146 on S-HBsAg was shown to prevent glycosylation and to inhibit HDV particle formation.^",

Second, the fact that motifs identified as essential to HDV assembly, such as residues 24-28 or Trp-196, are dispensable for subviral particle secretion and yet strictly conserved among HBV and WHV isolates, suggests that the selection pressure that has led to their conservation concerns functions other than those involved in subviral particle assembly.

It is not clear if these functions are fully operative or partially altered when the HDV RNPs are present ( Fig. 4) / Overall, the HDV life cycle depends on only two HBV elements: the S-HBsAg protein for the export of the RNP, and the L-HBsAg protein for entry in a noninfected hepatocyte. As for the M-HBsAg protein, its role needs L-HBsAg to envlope, is not essential for assembly or in vitro infectivity of HDV But contrary to HBV that its nucleocapsid only in the presence of L-HBsAg, HDV can be coated quite efficiently with an envelope devoid of L-HBsAg. And it is likely that most HDV particles present in an infectious serum are coated with S-HBsAg proteins only (or S-HBsAg and M-HBsAg), and that only a minority contain L-HBsAg. The inclusion of L-HBsAg in the HDV envelope is thought to occur through lateral protein-protein interactions that are established between L-HBsAg and S-HBsAg at the ER membrane before budding, but the proportion of L-HBsAg proteins that are needed in the envelope for infectivity is unknown. With regard to virus entry into the host cell, it seems reasonable to assume that HBV and HDV use the same cellular receptors on the human hepatocyte, but the identities of the receptors remain unknown. At the post-binding steps, internalization of an HDV RNP or that of an HBV nucleocapsid, most likely follows a specific pathway to which S-HBsAg and L-HBsAg may participate.''^'^^",

Coinfections are often acute and self-limited, and they are characterized by a concomitant replication of both HBV and HDV; whereas superinfections often cause severe acute hepatitis and chronic type D hepatitis in 70% of the cases. They also lead to the inhibition of HBV replication during the acute phase of HDV infection. This phenomenon has been described in both humans and the experimentally infected chimpanzee, but it remains poorly understood. It could result from a direct suppression of HBV replication exerted by the coexpressed HDV proteins, RNA or RNPs, or it could be the consequence of an indirect interfering mechanism which may involve inflammatory cytokines.^ There are at least three HDV genotypes with different geographic distributions and a sequence divergence as high as 38% at the nucleotide level. Genotype I is ubiquitous, genotype II has been found primarily in east Asia, and genotype III only in South America. Eight HBV genotypes (designated A to H) have been described, presenting also different geographic distributions. The heterogeneity of the disease pattern caused by HDV-HBV infections, which has been observed worldwide, may depend on specific HDV on HBV genotypes. The most severe form has been recorded in South America where a genotype III HDV was associated to a genotype F HBV^",

            "text": "Among enveloped viruses that achieve maturation through a nucleocapsid-independent assembly mechanism, HBV has developed the most active budding process. It is carried out by the S-HBsAg envelope protein itself, and it leads to the formation of a large excess of empty subviral particles over mature virions. For that reason, HBV appears the best-suited virus for assisting a coatless virus such as HDV to export its genome from an infected cell by supplying the transport vesicles. Though not proven, a specific interaction between the HDV RNP and S-HBsAg is probably needed to ensure an efficient virion assembly. Recent experiments based on genetic analysis have contributed to the understanding of the intracellular HDV-HBV interactions involved in HDV maturation, but it is expected that further progress in this direction will be achieved when ultrastructural data for both the HBV envelope and the HDV RNP become available.",

When aggregates include L-HBsAg in the absence of HBV nucleocapsid, it leads to the secretion of filamentous subviral particles. When aggregates include L-HBsAg in the presence of HBV nucleocapsid, budding leads to the secretion of HBV virions (Dane particles). WHien HDV RNP is present, it can be included in the aggregates, irrespective of the presence of L-HBsAg. Incorporation of the L-HDAg protein in the HDV envelope confers infectivity. The small form of the delta protein (S-HDAg) is 195-amino acids in length, and the large form (L-HDAg) has a C-terminal extension of 19 amino acids (black rectangle).
