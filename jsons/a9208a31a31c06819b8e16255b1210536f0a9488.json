Formal proposals were discussed for the classification of all taxa containing viruses that replicate by using a reverse transcription step (pararetroviruses; families Retroviridae, Hepadnaviridae, Caulimoviridae, Pseudoviridae and Metaviridae) and also the classification of retrotransposons and retrons. The EC felt that the idea of grouping the reverse-transcribing elements has already been accepted by the ICTV as this has received broad support from those who work with such elements. However, the detail of the proposal involved the use of the taxon sub-order, which is not a recognized virus taxon. Workers in the field had not been supportive of creating an order to contain retrotransposons and retrons, largely because of there being no lateral transfer of these latter elements. Also it was noted that there was a question of whether or not ICTV should be concerned with these elements. The proposals were therefore referred back to the proposers for amendment (proposal numbers 2005.091-117F.01). ",

New proposals approved for public examination via the ICTV website(http://www.danforthcenter.org/iltab/ictvnet/asp/ MainPage.asp) Alloherpesviridae, which contains fish and amphibian viruses, as one genus and 13 unassigned species, and 3. Malacoherpesviridae, which contains the single invertebrate herpesvirus species known.Proposals were also made to add new species and genera to the existing subfamilies.(b) Viruses resembling picornaviruses It is proposed to group the families Picornaviridae, Dicistroviridae, Marnaviridae, Sequiviridae and Comoviridae, along with the unassigned genera Iflavirus, Sadwavirus and Cheravirus, into a new order (Picornavirales) (proposal numbers 2005.200-202V.01). Some rearrangements are proposed for the genera Enterovirus and Rhinovirus of the family Picornaviridae (proposal numbers 2005.261-267V.01). (c) ds RNA viruses The families Reoviridae, Totiviridae, Cystoviridae and Birnaviridae are proposed to be classified in a new order (provisionally named Reovirales) (proposal numbers 2005.236-238V.01). A new family is proposed to contain birnaviruses with an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase typical of picornaviruses (proposal numbers 2005.216-222V.01). Two new genera will be added to the family Reoviridae: Cardoreovirus with the new species Eriocheir sinensis reovirus as the type species, and Dinovernavirus with the new species Aedes pseudoscutellaris reovirus as the type species (proposal numbers 2005.229V-232V.01 and 2005.242-245V.01). \u2022 in the genera Atadenovirus and Mastadenovirus of the family Adenoviridae (proposal numbers 2005.223-224V.01); \u2022 in the genus Coronavirus of the family Coronaviridae (proposal number 2005.260V.01); \u2022 in the genus Hantavirus of the family Bunyaviridae (proposal number 2005.119V.01). (ii) From the Invertebrate Virus SC (a) New species in the genera Iflavirus and Cripavirus (proposal numbers 2005.118-120I.01). (iii) From the Prokaryote Virus SC (a) New taxonomy for the Caudovirales Proposals were made to classify viruses in the families Myoviridae, Podoviridae and Siphoviridae but the EC felt unable to accept these without further details from the SC. The proposals included the use of the taxon sub-genus which is not recognized as a virus taxon (proposal numbers 2005.123-181B.01). (b) New genus named Deltalipothrixvirus with the new species Acidianus filamentous virus 2 as type species in the family Lipothrixviridae (proposal numbers 2005.084-2005.087B.01).
