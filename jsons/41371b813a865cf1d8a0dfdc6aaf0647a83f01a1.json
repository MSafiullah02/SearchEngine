They all have a fusion peptide at the amino-terminus that is thought to insert directly into the target membrane during the viral fusion process. Carboxylterminal to the fusion peptide are two regions containing 4,3 hydrophobic (heptad) repeats, sequence motifs that form a coiled-coil structure. This structure forms a stable protease K-resistant core in the ectodomain of the enveloped glycoprotein (or fusion protein). The fusion-core complex consists of two peptides, termed HR1 and HR2 peptides, that correspond to the two regions with hydrophobic heptad repeats. Heptad-repeat (HR) regions are found in the fusion proteins of many different viruses and form an important characteristic of class I viral fusion proteins (Bosch et al., 2003; Eckert & Kim, 2001) . Previous biophysical and structural studies show that the HR1 and HR2 peptides of MHV spike protein form a stable helical trimer of heterodimers (Bosch et al., 2003) . It is believed that the two HR domains refold into a six-helix bundle during the fusion process, in which the HR1 domain forms a trimeric coiled coil surrounded by three antiparallel helices of the HR2 domain (Eckert & Kim, 2001) . Consequently, the transmembrane domain and the fusion peptide, which is known to insert into the cell membrane, are both transposed into close association.
