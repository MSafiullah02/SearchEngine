            "text": "Coronavirus is a family of RNA viruses with the largest RNA genome known so far. In cells infected with coronavirus, a nested set of genomic and subgenomic RNA species is produced and used for translation of viral structural and nonstructural proteins. Among these proteins, the 1a and 1ab polyproteins are post-translationally processed to smaller, mature proteins (Ziebuhr et al., 2000, Ziebuhr, 2005). It is generally believed that replication of the large RNA genome and transcription of a nested set of 5 to 8 subgenomic RNA species are carried out by these replicase proteins. However, the exact functions of individual replicase proteins are largely unknown. In recent years, determination of the crystal structures of some of these proteins, including the proteinase domain of nsp3, nsp5, nsp7 and 8, nsp9, nsp10 and nsp15, led to the revelation of many important functions for these proteins (Saikatendu et al., 2005, Ratia et al., 2006, Peti et al., 2005, Zhai et al., 2005, Anand et al., 2002, Anand et al., 2003, Yang et al., 2003, Egloff et al., 2004, Sutton et al., 2004, Su et al., 2006, Joseph et al., 2006; Ricagno et al., 2006), but most of these functions are not rigorously tested in a biologically relevant system. In this study, residues critical for dimerization and the RNA-binding activity of nsp9 protein from coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) were systematically studied by mutagenesis, based on the structural studies of SARS-CoV nsp9 protein.",

Searching for structural homology between SARS-CoV nsp9 and other RNA binding proteins suggests that the SARS-CoV nsp9 protein is a nucleic acid-binding protein and has nonspecific RNA-binding activity (Egloff et al., 2004). Biophysical evidence has also shown an interaction between SARS-CoV nsp9 and nsp8 proteins (Sutton et al., 2004). Based on sequence comparison, a number of evolutionarily conserved amino acid residues in different domains of the IBV nsp9 protein were systematically mutated to assess their roles in viral replication and infectivity by introducing into an infectious cDNA clone system derived from the genomic RNA of IBV. Subsequently, dimerization and the RNA-binding activity of the purified wild type and mutant IBV nsp9 protein were studied by immunoprecipitation, gel filtration, chemical cross linking and Northwestern blotting. These studies led to the identification of amino acid residues essential for dimerization and the RNA-binding activity of IBV nsp9 protein. This study thus presents biochemical and genetic evidence that directly links dimerization and the RNA binding activity of the coronavirus nsp9 protein to virus replication and infectivity in cultured cells. This information would be of help in design of preventive and treatment approaches against coronavirus infection.",

The primer pair was chosen so that the IBV sequence from nucleotides 14,931 to 15,600 would be amplified by the RT-PCR reaction. If replication of viral RNA occurred, a 670 bp PCR fragment would be expected. As shown in Fig. 2b, RT-PCR fragments amplified from both positive (lanes 2 and 5) and negative (lanes 3 and 6) strand RNA templates were obtained from cells transfected with wild type and the mutant transcripts. The amount of negative strand RNA was approximately one third of the positive strand RNA (Fig. 2b). RT-PCR amplification of subgenomic mRNAs was then carried out to check whether a low level of subgenomic mRNA transcription occurred in cells transfected with the mutant transcripts. The forward primer used in this reaction corresponds to the leader sequence from nucleotides 26\u201346 in the genomic RNA and the downstream primers covers IBV sequences from nucleotides 24,784 to 24,803. If transcription of subgenomic mRNAs did occur, a 415 bp PCR product corresponding to the 5\u2032-terminal region of the subgenomic mRNA4 and a 1010 bp fragment corresponding to the 5\u2032-terminal region of the subgenomic mRNA3 would be expected. As shown in Fig. 2b, a dominant 415 bp band and a weak 1010 bp band were observed in cells electroporated with wild type full-length transcripts at two days post-electroporation (lane 4).

For this purpose, wild type and mutant fragments with a 6-His tag at their N-terminus were cloned into a bacterial expression vector, expressed in E. coli and purified to near homogeneity. After removing the 6-His tag, the purified proteins were treated with 0\u20132% of glutaraldehyde, a short self-polymerizing reagent that reacts with lysine, tyrosine, histidine and tryptophan residues, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Gradually increased detection of the homodimer was observed following cross-linking of wild type and mutant proteins with increasing concentrations of the cross-linking agent (Fig. 3a). Interestingly, it was noted that G98D mutant protein showed much less, if any, dimer formation without cross-linking with glutaraldehyde (Fig. 3a). The I95N mutant protein also showed significantly reduced dimer formation under the same conditions (Fig. 3a).

The results showed the detection of two peaks for wild type and the I95N mutant (Fig. 3b). Analysis of the two peaks by mass spectrometry confirmed that they indeed represent the nsp9 monomers and dimers, respectively. However, only one peak was observed for the G98D mutant protein (Fig. 3b). Once again, analysis by mass spectrometry confirmed that it represents the nsp9 monomers containing the right point mutation. Second, wild type, I95N and G98D mutant nsp9 were cloned into a mammalian expression vector with either a Flag or a Myc tag at the N-terminus. The Flag-tagged wild type nsp9 were co-expressed with the Myc-tagged wild type nsp9, I95N and G98D mutants, respectively. The association of wild type nsp9 protein with either wild type or mutant nsp9 proteins was analyzed by coimmunoprecipitation experiment with anti-Flag antibody. The immunoprecipitated proteins were separated on SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blotting with either anti-Flag or anti-Myc antibody. As shown in Fig. 3c, Western blot analysis of total cell lysates showed the detection of similar amounts of wild type and mutant nsp9 proteins either expressed on their own or co-expressed with the Flag-tagged wild type nsp9 (Fig. 3c, top panel). Analysis of the precipitates with anti-Flag antibody showed the presence of approximately equal amounts of the Flag-tagged wild type nsp9 either expressed on its own or co-expressed with the Myc-tagged wild type and mutant nsp9 (Fig. 3c, middle panel). Analysis of the same precipitates with anti-Myc antibody showed that efficient detection of the Myc-tagged wild type nsp9 was made only when it was co-expressed with the Flag-tagged nsp9 protein (Fig. 3c, bottom panel, lane 5). Interestingly, much reduced detection of the Myc-tagged I95N was observed when it was co-expressed with the Flag-tagged wild type nsp9 (Fig. 3c, bottom panel, lane 6), demonstrating that this point mutation destabilizes the nsp9 homodimer. When the Myc-tagged G98D construct was co-expressed with the Flag-tagged wild type nsp9, the mutant protein was not detected in the co-immunoprecipitation experiment (Fig. 3c, bottom panel, lane 7).

Once again, formation of reasonable amounts of dimer was detected in the purified wild type protein (Fig. 4a, top panel, lane 3).

The results showed that both wild type and G98D mutant proteins with the 6-His tag could efficiently bind to either probe (Fig. 4a, middle and bottom panels, lanes 1 and 2). It was noted that efficient detection of the dimeric form of the two proteins was achieved when either probe was used (Fig. 4a, middle and bottom panels, lanes 1 and 2), suggesting preferential binding of the probes to the homodimer of the protein. After removal of the 6-His tag, both the monomeric and dimeric forms of the purified wild type protein could still efficiently bind to either probe (Fig. 4a, middle and bottom panels, lane 3). However, very weak, if any, binding of the G98D mutant protein to either probe was observed after removal of the 6-His tag (Fig. 4a, middle and bottom panels, lane 4), suggesting that this point mutation abolishes the RNA-binding activity of IBV nsp9 protein. The other three mutant proteins showed similar RNA-binding activity as wild type protein, except that G98A mutant showed greatly reduced binding activity to the negative RNA probe (Fig. 4a, lane 7). The binding efficiency of wild type and the four mutant proteins was then quantified by densitometry measurement of bands from three independent experiments. The relative RNA-binding efficiencies of the mutant proteins to wild type protein are shown in Fig. 4b. The results demonstrated that the G98D mutant protein maintained 0 and 4% binding efficiencies, and the G98A mutant showed 75 and 10% binding efficiencies to the positive and negative probes, respectively (Fig. 4b). The I95A and I95N mutant proteins showed 80 to 100% binding efficiencies to both probes (Fig. 4b).",

It is generally believed that the functionally active form of the coronavirus replicase proteins would consist of 15\u201316 smaller, mature proteins (nsp1\u2013nsp16) derived by proteolytic cleavage of these two polyproteins. In this study, systematic mutagenesis of one of these proteins, nsp9, was carried out to study the functional roles of this protein in coronavirus RNA replication and infectivity. Our results are consistent with structural data that indicate that nsp9 forms homodimers, and we have identified residues that are essential for nsp9 function during virus replication. Substitution of a negatively charged amino acid (Asp) for a conserved G98 residue in the C-terminal \u03b1-helix greatly destabilized the IBV nsp9 homodimer and abolished the RNA-binding activity of the protein. Consequently, introduction of the same mutation into the infectious IBV clone system showed that the mutation abolished the transcription of subgenomic RNA and no infectious virus could be rescued. Interestingly, mutation of a semi-conserved Ile (I95) residue in the same region showed minimal effect on the RNA-binding activity of the protein and moderately destabilizing effect on the homodimer. Introduction of this mutation into the IBV infectious clone system showed the recovery of a mutant virus with severe growth defects, supporting that dimerization is critical for the function of this replicase protein.",

            "text": "In previous structural studies, the crystal structure of SARS-CoV nsp9 crystal contains a dimer in the asymmetric unit (Fig. 6). In each monomer, seven-\u03b2 strands and one \u03b1-helix form a cone-shaped \u03b2-barrel flanked by the C-terminal \u03b1-helix (Fig. 6). The C-terminal \u03b1-helix has a high content of hydrophobic residues, yielding two hydrophobic sides. One side faces the \u03b2-barrel and the other interacts with the C-terminal \u03b1-helix of the second crystallographic monomer to form the homodimer (Fig. 6). This homodimer is therefore assembled by hydrophobic interactions (Egloff et al., 2004, Sutton et al., 2004). Analysis of the purified SARS-CoV nsp9 protein by surface plasmon resonance demonstrated that it is a single strand RNA-binding protein (Egloff et al., 2004). This single strand RNA-binding activity was further confirmed by fluorescence experiments (Egloff et al., 2004). By structural modeling, the IBV nsp9 protein was found to adopt a very similar folding as the SARS-CoV nsp9 protein (Fig. 6). Based on these structural studies, the topology of nsp9 protein was shown to most closely resemble the domains of the 3C-like proteinase (3CLpro) which belongs to the serine proteinase superfamily (Berman et al., 2000). Structure alignments revealed that it best matches to the domain II of the coronavirus 3CLpro and subdomian I of the picornaviral 3Cpro, suggesting that the two groups of proteins may share certain evolutionary relationship and may play some regulatory functions (Sutton et al., 2004). The direct correlation of the RNA replication efficiency and infectivity of IBV with the stability of the nsp9 homodimer confirms that dimer is the functional form of the protein. Interestingly, the functionally active unit of the coronavirus 3CLpro is also a dimeric form of the protein (Anand et al., 2003).",

(2008) reported that HCoV-229E nsp9 forms a different homodimer from SARS-CoV nsp9, in spite of a sequence identity of 45% between the two proteins. In HCoV-229E nsp9, dimerization is mediated by a disulfide bridge, a few hydrogen bonds, and hydrophobic interaction between the C-terminal helix of each monomer. The structural difference between HCoV-229E and SARS-CoV nsp9 may be due to the presence of extra residues from the cloning procedure at the N-terminus of the SARS-CoV nsp9 preparation used for structure determination, which could result in different homodimer forms and different biological functions of proteins. In this study, we observed that the six His-tags in the N-terminus of IBV Nsp9 rendered drastic effects on dimerization and RNA-binding activity of the protein. The six-His tag was removed by factor Xa from all wild type and mutant constructs in our biochemical studies of the protein.",

This form of nsp9 dimer can bind to single-stranded RNA more tightly and therefore promote replication of the viral genome (Ponnusamy et al. 2008). The SARS-CoV nsp9 has three Cys residues and one of them (Cys 73) is corresponding to Cys 69 in HCoV-229E nsp9. However, these residues are not involved in the formation of intermolecular disulfide bond (Ponnusamy et al. 2008). As the number and position of Cys residues in IBV nsp9 are completely conserved with SARS-CoV nsp9, the IBV nsp9 may form dimer mainly through hydrophobic interaction similar to SARS-CoV nsp9 rather than through formation of a disulfide bridge.",

As explained, no infectious virus was recovered from cells transfected with G98D mutant transcripts. Evidence present suggests that G98D mutation may lead to the disruption of subgenomic RNA transcription and the protein is therefore directly involved in the viral replication. As the RNA-binding assay used in this study involves binding of RNA probes to the denatured, momomeric form of the nsp9 protein, it is quite unlikely that the loss of RNA-binding activity for this mutant is the direct consequence of destabilization of the nsp9 homodimer by this point mutation. One possibility is that the C-terminal domain is directly involved in the binding of RNA. Alternatively, this point mutation may alter the overall folding of the protein.",

The structural characteristics of nsp9 suggested that its nucleic acid-binding activity is not strictly sequence-specific (Egloff et al., 2004, Sutton et al., 2004). The nsp9 protein may bind RNA through wrapping of the ssRNA around the nsp9 dimer (Egloff et al., 2004, Sutton et al., 2004). In this study, we show that mutations of some positively charged residues in the \u03b2-barrel regions could significantly reduce the RNA-binding activity of the protein. However, introduction of the same mutations into the viral genome showed only mild or moderate effects on the growth and infectivity of the rescued mutant viruses, though positive correlation between the lowered binding activity and the reduced infectivity of the mutant viruses was observed. It seems that mutations that destabilized the nsp9 homodimer render more profound effect on IBV infectivity than mutations that reduced the RNA-binding activity of the protein per se. We are currently uncertain if this may reflect the limitation of the assay used to analyze the RNA-binding activity of the protein in the study. On the other hand, it would suggest that formation of the nsp9 homodimer may play functions not directly related to the RNA-binding activity of the protein. One possibility is that dimerization of the protein may facilitate its interaction with other viral replicase proteins or host cell proteins involved in the viral replication cycle.",

In cells infected with MHV, nsp9 is localized in the perinuclear region together with other proteins of the replication complex (Bost et al., 2000). RdRp was shown to coimmunoprecipitate with 3CLpro, nsp8 and nsp9 (Brockway et al., 2003). Biophysical evidence has also been presented for an interaction between nsp9 and nsp8 of MHV (Sutton et al., 2004). Interaction between other replicase proteins was also documented. For example, a co-crystal structure of SARS-CoV nsp7 with nsp8 revealed a complex of eight monomers of each protein forming a hollow cylindrical structure. This hexadecameric assembly was proposed to be able to encircle an RNA template, possibly acting as a processivity factor for the RNA polymerase (Zhai et al., 2005). Structural analysis indicated that nsp9 may play multiple roles in coronavirus replication cycle, and its interaction with other proteins may be essential for the formation of the viral replication complex together with its ability to interact with RNA (Egloff et al., 2004, Sutton et al., 2004). However, we were unable to demonstrate direct interaction between IBV nsp9 and the two putative essential components of the replication complex, RdRp and RNA helicase in the overexpression system (data not shown). It suggests that formation of the replication complex may involve other viral and host cell components, including the viral RNA template. Further study would be required to address this interesting issue.",
