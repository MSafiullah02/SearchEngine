In addition to an essential list of laboratory tests that will be available to provide care for the HCP patient, the laboratory also needs to define what equipment/supplies are necessary to provide these required tests. The validation of new test protocols and the ability to sustain readiness while adhering to the regulatory requirements to offer testing are costly. These costs include having available and competent staff to support the specialized laboratory testing for an in-unit laboratory, but also the costs for maintenance of accreditation for specialized equipment, equipment depreciation and service contracts, and inventory to keep an adequate supply of reagents available for patient testing (Table 6 .6). These are added costs that are necessary to preserve a quality management program that will meet the regulatory requirements of a certified laboratory. Although some governmental support may be available for medical facilities to sustain the capability to provide treatment for patients with HCPs, financial commitment from the facility will also be required.

Laboratorians also acknowledge that technology is constantly changing and that adaptation to these changes is necessary. The balance of safety and providing quality results for patient care continues to be a delicate balance for the laboratory. Two future areas that may impact the laboratory overall, but are clearly needed for the high containment labs, include access to specimen collection devices that have the capacity to inactivate pathogens but still allow for the specimen to be acceptable for testing and the development of automated instruments by manufacturers that provide work flow efficiencies that includes close system testing along with specimen tracking. The development of specimen collection devices containing chemicals that can render a pathogen inactive while still stabilizing the specimen for testing has only recently been commercially developed for HIV testing [31, 32] . Additional work needs to be done in this area to expand the commercial availability of these types of collection devices for other applications. Making specimens noninfectious will also enhance the ability to transport and provide the means for in-house, long-term storage of these specimens to evaluate experimental drug applications and for potential future research activities without the regulations of the select agent program. With the development of safer equipment by manufacturers, the ability to test specimens with minimal handling will also reduce exposure opportunities in the laboratory.
