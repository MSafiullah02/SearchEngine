Briefly, two multiplex nested RT-PCRs were used for the simultaneous detection of PIVs 1\u20134, EVs, and HRVs, as well as IFVs A, B, and C, and RSVs A, and B. In addition, two one-step RT-PCRs were used to detect HCoVs and HMPV. ADVs were detected by one-step PCR. The sensitivity of the PCR systems was determined by using cloned, amplified products of each type of virus. Blank VTM was used as a negative control, and 100 copies of invariant \u03b2-actin gene were added to lysis buffer as internal controls to exclude inhibitors for nucleic acid extraction and PCR. Each RT-PCR amplification was performed using the Superscript II One-Step RT-PCR Platinum Taq kit (Invitrogen), and ExTaq DNA polymerase (Takara) was used for PCR assays. PCR products were analysed by electrophoresis in 2% agarose gel containing ethidium bromide. Of the PCR-positive samples, half were randomly selected for verification by PCR product sequencing.",

The overall detection rate of respiratory viruses in this study was 34.6%, similar to those obtained by others [2, 3]. However, these results may underestimate the role of virus infection, because viral loads in nose and throat swabs, as used in this study, are usually lower than those in aspirate or lavage [23]. Furthermore, infections from as yet unknown viruses may be responsible for some ARTIs. The prevalence of bacterial ARTI was not investigated in this study.",

However, during the study period, an epidemic peak of IFV A infection was observed in the summer of 2006. More patients with influenza-like illness were observed during this period, reflected by a two-fold increase in visits to the FOCD. The reason for this epidemic is unclear. We speculate that it may be due to antigen drift of IFVA, but this hypothesis needs to be confirmed by haemagglutinin sequencing in future studies. Currently influenza surveillance in north China is mainly conducted between late autumn and early spring (from 1 October to 31 March of the following year), and our findings indicate the necessity to extend the surveillance period of IFV to the entire year.",

The findings provide baseline data for evaluating the burden of respiratory virus infection in adults. As the number of patients with LRTIs was limited in this analysis, further studies should be undertaken and longer surveillance periods should provide more information concerning the epidemiology of respiratory virus infections, and their relationships with clinical outcomes.",
