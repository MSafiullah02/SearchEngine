As we do believe that the evolutionary analysis and finding on the possible virus reservoirs are helpful in understanding the diffusion of the novel 2019 coronavirus (SARS\u2010CoV\u20102) causing the coronavirus disease (COVID\u201019), with this letter I want to discuss the implications that descend from the coincidence of the virus binding site with the membrane angiotensin\u2010converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor.\n2\n\n",

We do have much more information on ACE1 effects, whereas details about ACE2 is only assumed; cardiovascular therapies are focused on ACE1, although ACE2 is supposed to be a promising target. We know also that ACE2 is abundantly present in the epithelia of the human lungs, which might explain the possible routes of the COVID\u201019 providing evidence to the recently observed severe case of pneumonia in China with a high mortality rate, and in the intestine, suggesting other possible routes of transmission.\n9\n\n",

            "text": "Thus, the questions that I want to point out and discuss with virologists are as follows:\n1.How is common to share biomolecular targets between viruses and active mediators of the cardiovascular system? Is it a \u201ccoincidence\u201d due to the spread over species and ancient phylogeny of renin\u2013angiotensin system? I mean, do viruses use as a binding site a functional receptor that is, usually, involved in the control of vascular tone, arterial blood pressure, and fibrotic response to damage? Is this functional? Or, instead, if this is not common, it is a possible evolution of viruses, eventually, driven by experiments and/or worldwide use of treatment targeting RAAS receptors?2.This fact raises questions on safety when using ACEi and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) in patients affected by COVID\u201019, as these therapies, which are widely used for the treatment of high blood pressure and heart failure, having as main target ACE1, can cause the upregulation of ACE2, with the consequence of open access routes to the COVID\u201019. On the contrary, it is not possible to exclude that less\u2010selective ACEi/ARBs might be also helpful by blocking, even partially, ACE2. In this regard, it might be useful to obtain epidemiological data on patients affected by COVID\u201019 that are assuming ACEi/ARB.\n",
