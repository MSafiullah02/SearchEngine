Some viruses, such as respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), mainly cause severe pneumonia in children less than 5 years of age. Theoretically, when children were infected with 2019-nCoV, the prognosis of infected children might be poorer than adults. However, research concerning children with 2019-nCoV infection reported that the clinical manifestations of 2019-nCoV infection in pediatric patients were mild.4 In our clinical practice, we noticed that the severity of respiratory symptoms in children with 2019-nCoV pneumonia was also different from adults with 2019-nCoV pneumonia. Children with 2019-nCoV pneumonia seldom developed dyspnea. Based on the unique clinical features in children who were infected with 2019-nCoV, we hypothesized that there might be some characteristic immune responses that help children avoid suffering from severe 2019-nCoV pneumonia.",

It seemed that CD8+ T cell response was also relevant to the severity of COVID-19 infections. In an adult with severe COVID-19 infection, the counts of CD4 and CD8 T cells in peripheral blood were found to decrease substantially.10 In this study, the child with severe 2019-nCoV pneumonia had low CD3+CD8+ lymphocyte count and low CD3+CD8+ lymphocyte percentage on admission, while the counts of CD3+CD8+ lymphocytes, percentages of CD3+, CD3+CD8+ lymphocytes were higher in 2019-nCoV pneumonia group compared with those in RSV pneumonia group. RSV is a common pathogen of infantile pneumonia, and can cause severe lower respiratory tract infection. CD8+ T cell counts in children with RSV infection were found significantly lower compared with healthy children.11 Effective CD8+ T cell activation might be one of the reasons why the symptoms of pneumonia in most children with 2019-nCoV pneumonia were mild to moderate. We speculated that the effective CD8+ T cell response had an important role in the development of 2019-nCoV pneumonia and CD8+ T cell could be used as a biomarker to predict the prognosis of COVID-19 infection.",

The anti-inflammatory effects of IL-10 can help the host tolerate infection and avoid pulmonary injury caused by an extensive immune response. However, on the other hand, the inhibition of protective immunity by IL-10 can dampen the clearance of pulmonary pathogens.13 IL-10 could be secreted by regulatory B lymphocytes (Breg). A study about neonatal-specific regulatory B (nBreg) cells in human neonates with RSV infection showed that the RSV-infected nBreg increased the severity of the infection by producing IL-10 and weakening Th1 cell responses.14 In this study, Breg was not detected. However, the higher percentage of CD19+ lymphocyte might be one of the reasons for the higher IL-10 levels in children with RSV pneumonia and influenced the severity of the RSV pneumonia. In adults with 2019-nCoV infection, IL10 was found to be higher in ICU patients than non-ICU patients.1 In this study, of 30 children with 2019-nCoV pneumonia who underwent the detection of cytokines, IL-10 level obviously increased in 2 children, one of who developed severe 2019-nCoV pneumonia. It seemed that IL10 was also relevant to the severity of the 2019-nCoV infection and the adaptable change in IL-10 level contributed to the relatively slight pneumonia symptoms in children. However, as the number of severe children with 2019-nCoV pneumonia was small in the study, the result needed to be verified in a study with a larger number of patients.",

Its value in the diagnosis of bacterial sepsis has been widely studied in adults.15 The difference in IL-6 level was not found between children with 2019-nCoV pneumonia and children with RSV pneumonia. In the child with severe 2019-nCoV pneumonia, the trend of IL-6 level was similar to those of CRP and PCT levels, and IL-6 level returned to normal range concomitantly with CRP and PCT levels after powerful antibiotic therapy. The increased IL-6 level might be attributed to bacterial co-infection and bacterial co-infection might be a risk factor of severe 2019-nCoV pneumonia.",

As no blood samples could be obtained from healthy children, we could not get direct evidence about the role of the studied lymphocyte subsets and cytokines in the development of 2019-nCoV pneumonia by comparing with healthy children. However, we tried to find some profile of the immune response by comparing the lymphocyte subsets and cytokines in 2019-nCoV pneumonia group with those in the RSV pneumonia group and made some deduction from what has already known about RSV pneumonia. The results found in the study could be used as clues of the immune response in 2019-nCoV pneumonia in further study. Secondly, the number of patients in the study was very limited. As there was only one child who suffered from severe 2019-nCoV pneumonia during the study period, the exact reason for severe 2019-nCoV pneumonia in children could not be confirmed by only one case.",
