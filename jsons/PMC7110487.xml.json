Reducing disease incidence and invoking milder clinical signs would not only afford animal welfare benefits, but also ultimately reduce the use of antibiotics and minimize the risk of developing resistant microbes (Guillemot, 1999). One major disease complex that impairs animal welfare and requires extensive use of antibiotics, for treatment, metaphylaxis and prophylaxis, is bovine respiratory disease (BRD). Viruses such as bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV), bovine herpes virus 1 (BHV-1), bovine parainfluenza virus 3 (PIV-3) and bovine coronavirus (BCoV) are involved in this complex (Kapil and Basaraba, 1997), and often occur in combination with bacteria and mycoplasma (Babiuk et al., 1988). The outcome of each individual case is affected by the animal\u2019s previous exposure to the pathogens, by management factors influencing immune responses and infection dose (e.g. colostrum intake, stress, nutritional status, hygiene, ventilation and stock density) and by the treatment. Transient and persistent co-infections with bovine viral diarrhoea virus (BVDV) frequently exacerbate the clinical signs (Potgieter, 1995).",

Most of the national dairy and beef herds (98.5% and 97.2%, respectively) were declared free of BVDV infection in Sweden in August 2005 (data obtained from the Swedish Dairy Association); however, fattening units in which calves are assembled from many sources are still sometimes affected by BVDV. Although never highly prevalent, BHV-1 was cleared from Scandinavia during the 1990s and only Denmark has had recurrent outbreaks since 1995 (data obtained from Office International des Epizooties, handistatus II). This provides additional advantages for calf rearing compared to countries where BHV-1 is endemic. Nevertheless, BRSV, BCoV and PIV-3 are prevalent and widespread in Sweden (H\u00e4gglund et al., 2005), and both BRSV and BCoV cause annual epidemics both in calves and adult cattle (Alenius et al., 1991, Tr\u00e5v\u00e9n et al., 1993, Elvander, 1996).",

They passed a clinical examination by a local veterinarian and the original animal group was kept isolated from other cattle during the three weeks prior to admission.

When more than 20% of the herd was affected with such signs, the rectal temperature of all individuals was taken, and calves with temperatures > 39.5 \u00b0C were treated. Treatment was repeated for poorly responding cases and the antibiotic changed to danofloxacin 1.25 mg/kg IM for three days (Advocin Vet., Orion), where there was a poor response to the second penicillin treatment.

This probably increased the treatment rates. However, the overall treatment rate for the whole period (August to February) did not differ from that reported earlier in feedlots (Smith, 1998). The total mortality of 0.7% during six months, in contrast, was lower (Kelly and Janzen, 1986, Smith, 1998). Estimations on feedlot rearing have suggested an average mortality of 2.7 per 1000 animals per month (1.3 of which due to respiratory disease) (Smith, 1998) and mortality rates of 0\u201315% (mostly 1\u20135%) during the first weeks after entry (Kelly and Janzen, 1986). Besides environmental and nutritional factors, the lower mortality herein might partly have been due to reduced synergism between pathogens, such as BVDV or BHV-1 (Potgieter, 1995).",

One option to reduce the impact of such outbreaks would be to use an effective vaccine with durable protection (Howard et al., 1987). The vaccination regime could either be initiated on arrival, or the initial dose given on the farm of origin with the second dose given on arrival. However both the cost of such a strategy and the possible interference of maternally derived antibodies on the protection induced by BRSV vaccines need to be considered (H\u00e4gglund et al., 2004).

It may also indicate that PIV-3 exhibits a higher transmission rate than the other viruses or is circulating widely during the summer.

Moreover, birth dates of some calves that were infected before arrival (i.e. those that remained seropositive in years when no animals seroconverted) imply that these infections occur also during the summer months (April\u2013August, n\n = 4, data not shown). These data are in agreement with earlier findings (Verhoeff and van Nieuwstadt, 1984, H\u00e4gglund et al., 2005), which suggest that BRSV, PIV-3 and BCoV circulate all year around, although maybe at a lower level during the summer. It is likely that environmental factors influence the severity of disease during infections (e.g. by lower infection dose during the summer due to low virus survival rate in the environment); infections in summer would thus not be diagnosed as often as in winter. Accordingly, the only clinically observed outbreak of BRSV, with a sharp treatment peak and one death, occurred in December 1999. A neighbouring farm had a BRSV outbreak within the same time period, as confirmed by serology, suggesting that the virus was introduced from outside the herd, possibly by wind, humans or by vectors. During one year when BRSV was absent (1998/1999), seronegativity to PIV-3 and BCoV on arrival was significantly correlated to BRD treatment, supporting earlier data that these viruses also are of clinical importance (Stott et al., 1980, Storz et al., 2000).",
