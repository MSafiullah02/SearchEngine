Microbiota are complex in both structure and function due to their dynamic nature, compositional variability, and their ability to self-reproduce and self-organize. This complexity can be well represented and modelled as networks (see Box 1 for a summary of network types). A key feature of network theory is that the architectural features of networks appear to be universal to most complex systems, including microbiomes, molecular interaction networks, computer networks, microcircuits, and social networks. This universality paves the way for using expertise developed in well-studied non-biological systems to characterize the intricate interwoven relationships that shape microbial interactions. The unparalleled value of network theory becomes apparent in cases where the goal is revealing patterns behind small-and largescale ecological and evolutionary processes within high dimensional datasets with complex distributions [17] . The application of network theory to microbiome studies can be used to model the co-occurrence of microorganisms, find microbial relationships essential for community assembly or stability, and deduce the influence of various interactions on the host health. We feel that a more widespread application of network theory in microbiome analysis will provide valuable insights into the organization, function, and evolution of these important communities.",

Correlation-based network inference has been successfully used to study human gut [21] , soil [22] , and phyllosphere [23] microbiomes. For example, Arumugam and colleagues [21] identified three robust human gut enterotypes that were not nation-or continent-specific by analyzing a combined dataset of newly sequenced and published fecal metagenomes of individuals from four countries. However, the use of correlation coefficients to detect dependencies between members of a microbiome suffers from limitations such as detecting spurious correlations among low-abundance OTUs in zero-inflated data or being sensitive to compositionality [24] . Weiss et al. [25] evaluated the performance of eight correlation methods on both synthetic and real data in response to challenges specific to microbiome studies and assessed their ability to distinguish signals from noise and detect a range of ecological and time-series relationships.

One obvious alternative is to use multiple regression analysis to infer the abundance of one species from the combined abundances of other taxa. Although the method is simple and frequently used, the meaning and interpretation of regression results can be more difficult. For instance, the successfully predicted links might not always mean that there is an underlying biological basis for the association. Moreover, regression-based methods suffer from overfitting that increases with the number of predictor variables, and is associated with an commensurate increase in the number of false positives. Overfitting can be remedied by using sparse regression and cross-validation. One example of using logistic regression models in microbiome network analysis is the study of independent associations between bacteria, viruses, and risk factors in the upper respiratory tract of young children [26] . Using this approach, van den Bergh and colleagues found that Streptococcus pneumoniae colonization was positively correlated with the presence of Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, human rhinoviruses, and enteroviruses, and negatively correlated with the presence of Staphylococcus aureus. They also observed a strong positive association between S. aureus and influenza viruses and a negative association between human rhinoviruses and coronaviruses [26].",

In other words, PGMs deal with uncertainty and complexity through the use of probability theory and graph theory, respectively. Bayesian networks (also called belief networks) and Markov networks (MN; also called Markov random fields, MRFs) are the most popular graphical models used. PGMs use graphs as the foundation for both measuring joint probability distributions (from which we can obtain marginal and conditional probabilities) and representing sets of conditional dependence and independence relations within data in a compact fashion. PGMs can be categorized as directed versus undirected, static versus dynamic, and probabilistic versus decisional. In microbiome networks, links between OTUs represent symmetric undirected associations unless networks are built from time series data, where the change of one factor may temporally lead or follow another factor. Static PGMs model a set of variables represented at a certain point in time, whereas dynamic PGMs model a set of variables across various time points. Finally, while probabilistic models only include random variables, decisional PGMs also consider decision and utility variables. Markov networks are examples of undirected graphical models satisfying the Markov property such that a variable is independent of all other variables given its neighbors. In general, however, undirected graphs are consisted of three main groups: (i) correlation graphs, (ii) partial correlation graphs, and (iii) conditional independence graphs. These models are described in detail in Box 2.",

This interdependence can lead to spurious results when using traditional statistical methods such as Pearson's correlation.

Clusters are biologically important when considered as isolated, taxonomic, evolutionary or functional modules. High modularity indicates that the network has dense connections within certain groups of nodes and sparse connections between these groups. Several approaches have been developed to detect clusters within networks with varying degrees of success, which is partly due to inherent clustering ambiguity of the real-world networks. Identifying clusters within a biological network (e.g., groups of coexisting or coevolving microbes contributing towards a disease, or groups of functionally related molecules) is a key issue in network biology and one that is likely to grow in importance in the near future. We can identify these clusters either by using network topology to reveal the modular structure of the data, or by taking advantage of supplementary data (such as 'omics data and biomedical metadata), along with network topology to find closely tied clusters of nodes within networks. Topological clustering methods including hierarchical top-down and bottom-up methods, multilevel and Markov clustering algorithm are described in detail in Box 4.",

Most networks show a power-law degree distribution, where a few nodes have a very large number of connections, while other nodes have no or few connections [53] .

Cellular networks, genetic regulatory networks, and protein-protein interaction networks are biological examples of scale-free networks [54, 55] . S-metric developed by Li and colleagues [56] is a useful method for explaining the differences between networks that have identical degree sequence, especially if they are scaling (i.e[ 4 _ T D $ D I F F ] ., there are bivariate relationships of power-law types, by which one attribute relates to another attribute raised to a power, called power-law or scaling exponent).",

However, topological approaches reveal no information on the underlying mechanisms shaping the modularity. A more insightful analysis will use other types of available data in combination with network topology to infer biologically significant modules. Such integrative algorithms can expand on topological approaches by evaluating both network connectivity and the correlations within biological and medical profiles across multiple samples or conditions. We refer the reader to a recent review of integrative approaches for finding modules in biological networks through merging topological data with 'omics data [27] . Many of these methods are potentially applicable to the integration of topological structure with biomedical profiles for the inference of modules in microbiome co-occurrence network. Integrative methods, for example, are being used to unify gene expression profiles with the topology of protein-protein interaction networks for the computation of joint membership probability of coregulated modules. A similar approach can be adopted for polymicrobial infections to infer shifts in microbiome composition in response to various antibiotics, by merging antibiotic treatment profiles with microbiome network topology.",

Methods used to identify network hubs fall into one of three general categories: Examples of node centrality indices are degree centrality [28] , node-and edge-betweenness [28, 29] , closeness [28] and Eigen-centrality [30] . Centrality indices suffer from two general drawbacks: (i) they only rank nodes, but do not measure the difference between them [31] , and (ii) they underestimate the power of non-hub nodes due to heterogeneous topology of complex networks [32] .

This approach is based on the assumption that for sparse graphical models, the zero-and first-order conditional independencies are reasonably accurate estimation of the full conditional independencies within data.

The main finding of this study was that count matrix properties, such as sequencing depth and evenness, are potential confounding factors that might influence network construction and should be taken into account while interpreting or comparing microbiome networks.",

Integrating significant microbial associations detected from OTU tables with metadata measurements of interest not only will provide us with valuable insights into the dynamics of the interactions between external factors and the microbial community, but also can help us understand how the detected relationships might change when additional variables are taken into account. Nevertheless, determining the conditional independence relationships of all variables within a microbial community is a daunting challenge. For example, a well known probabilistic approach to represent dependencies within data is using an MRF in the form of an undirected graphical model. However, estimating the MRF underlying the multivariate distribution over all variables is extremely difficult when variables are coming from different domains (e.g., continuous, ordinal, categorical and count-valued).",

More advanced methods, such as data fusion approaches, are capable of mining heterogeneous datasets and directly exploit associated data without the need to transform data types into a common data space. Data fusion approaches have been successfully applied to predict gene function [48] , mine disease-disease associations [49] , to predict drug toxicity [50] , and infer gene networks [51] . Mixed graph models have a huge yet untapped potential for finding relationships between microbial associations (e.g., in the form of network hubs or clusters) and external factors or conditions that are assumed to influence or be under influence of microbial community. For example, these models can help tie a change in disease severity to alterations in microbial interactions, or associate a modification in antibiotic regimen to shifts in microbiome composition.",

While we can see formidable potential for network-based analytic approaches, significant work must still be done before we approach a full systems-level understanding of microbe-microbe and host-microbe interactions using network theory. Understanding, diagnosing, and therapeutically treating dysbioses can undergo tremendous progress through the application of advanced network theory approaches, ranging from characterization of network topologies and cluster detection, to the integrative dynamic analyses that are able to characterize the interplay between microbiomes and external stimuli. Additionally, most current work concentrates on snapshots of activity in a few selected environments and in an abstract space. Moreover, the vast majority of network-based studies so far have focused on microbial co-occurrence or co-exclusion networks, which usually lead to partial or inadequate interpretation of the state and properties of the microbial community. However, a more insightful understanding of these complex interactions will require the analysis of data collection as a whole using advanced network theory. Integrative analyses will enable us to look at all types of interaction (e.g., metabolic, regulatory, spatial, etc.) within the microbiome, and can offer further insights into how the microbiome affects the host and vice versa. The result of such an integrative analysis will be a network of networks, which will lead to a more comprehensive understanding of the complex interplay of internal and external interactions involved in microbiome behavior, or the role of the microbiome in host health and",
