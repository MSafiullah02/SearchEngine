Retronasal olfaction, a combination of orthonasal smell and taste, is a sensory process that allows humans to perceive flavour, which is defined as the perception of anything beyond the five taste dimensions of food: sweet, salty, bitter, sour and umami. 1 This process is temporarily impaired during URIs due to mucosal inflammation and congestion of the nasal passages, thus physically blocking the entry of odour and flavour molecules to the olfactory cleft. 2 In contrast, post-URI olfactory loss is a neural process that occurs due to viral insult 2 and most commonly results in hyposmia late in the course of viral infection. 3 This type of viral insult can result in either temporary loss of olfaction or, in some cases, permanent loss of smell.",

However, she did not make the connection to this early symptom and the subsequent respiratory distress until specifically questioned. She noted in particular that when preparing her normal meals, she could no longer appreciate any of the typical culinary aromas. Further, she could not smell any of her scented candles but did not think anything of it at that time. The patient denied any history of hyposmia or anosmia prior to this. It was not until a few days later when she developed a non-productive cough, malaise, shortness of breath and chest tightness that ultimately prompted her to call 911.

Officially declared a pandemic on 11 March by the WHO, 8 COVID-19, caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, has affected over 2.4 million patients globally and resulted in over 169 000 deaths as of 20 April 2020. 4 Throughout recent weeks, reports of anosmia as a symptom of COVID-19 have flooded the media. Otolaryngologists around the globe have reported a significant number of patients with COVID-19 presenting with olfactory dysfunction, 9 but scientific data have proven that a significant association has been limited. A recent study in Italy using a patient questionnaire found that approximately one-third (20 of 59) of patients hospitalised with COVID-19 reported some degree of olfactory or gustatory dysfunction. 10 Another recently accepted publication also involving olfactory and gustatory questionnaires was conducted at 12 European hospitals. 11 Among the 417 mildto-moderate European patients with COVID-19 involved in the Lechien et al study, 85.6% and 88.0% reported olfactory and gustatory dysfunction, respectively. The majority (65.7%) of patients reported olfactory dysfunction occurring after the appearance of general ears, nose and throat symptoms; however, 11.8% of patients in this study reported olfactory dysfunction appearing before any other symptoms, suggesting anosmia may be important for early COVID-19 detection. They did not assess the prevalence of gustatory dysfunctions appearing as the first symptom, similar to how our patient presented. Additionally, olfactory dysfunction was not significantly associated with rhinorrhea or nasal obstruction, 11 hinting that the mechanism by which SARS-CoV-2 causes anosmia may be distinguishable from that of other common URI-causing viruses. However, Lechien et al did find significant associations between olfactory outcomes and several variables, including a significant association between fever and anosmia (p = 0.014). Furthermore, women were proportionally more affected by hyposmia or anosmia compared with men (p < 0.001). 11 While more data are needed to determine if gender is a predisposing factor to the development of anosmia, the predilection for women in this study may be explained by sex dimorphisms in the olfactory bulb itself. A past study involving postmortem brains conducted in Brazil found that women have more neurons in the olfactory bulb. 12 The higher susceptibility of women to develop olfactory and subsequent gustatory dysfunction may also be related to sex differences in inflammatory cytokine production. 13 Future studies exploring gender and additional demographic differences in patients with COVID-19 who experience anosmia are warranted.",

Using a questionnaire sent out to over 10 000 residents in all provinces of Iran, a study that is now in preprint found that there is a significant correlation between anosmia and COVID-19 in the different provinces. 14 However, reports of anosmia in Asia have not been robust. To our knowledge, Mao et al's study, which details the neurological manifestations of 214 patients hospitalised with COVID-19 in Wuhan, China, is one of the only studies that mention olfactory and gustatory dysfunction as symptoms associated with SARS-CoV-2. 15 In contrast to the European studies, only 5.1% and 5.6% of patients in Mao et al's study reported hyposmia and hypogeusia, respectively. 15 Earlier studies originating from the virus' original epicentre of Wuhan have failed to mention effects on olfactory and gustatory sensation at all. 16 17 This evokes many questions regarding the significance of anosmia and why it seems to be so prevalent in European populations yet hardly addressed in Asian papers. One explanation may be explained by variation in the SARS-CoV-2 genome. Analyses have revealed two major types of SARS-CoV-2, S and L, which are defined by their singlenucleotide polymorphisms. 18 The L type was more prevalent in early stages of the outbreak in Wuhan, but its frequency has decreased. 18 Emerging studies have also demonstrated continued evolution of SARS-CoV-2 in regard to its surface proteins, particularly the spike glycoprotein. 19 20 This glycoprotein is necessary for binding cell receptors and thus determines host tropism, 19 20 which may explain the potential clinical differences between patients of distinct demographic areas. Another possibility is that patients with COVID-19 in the Asian population in fact did have anosmia with associated hypoguesia and dysguesia, yet these symptoms went un-noticed or under-reported. Unlike the loss of sight, which is readily apparent to others, anosmia can be particularly insidious and go unnoticed. As in the case of our patient, she did not realise she had anosmia until her perception of flavour and ability to enjoy foods were affected. For patients who eat primarily bland foods, such as white rice, which is a staple of the Chinese diet, anosmia and its subsequent impairment on retronasal olfaction may not be evident. The need for further scientific study involving validated smell tests to determine the significance is apparent. The implications of hyposmia and the overall use of olfactory performance measures to either support or diagnose the prognosis in COVID-19 go beyond the acute disease state itself. It is well known in the literature that individuals with persistent olfactory dysfunction are at particular risk for nutritional deficiencies, development of depression and other psychiatric disorders, and the inability to detect certain 'warning/danger' odours like natural gas, smoke, spoiled foods and other noxious gases. 21 On 22 March 2020, a statement released from the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery (AAO-HNS), 'Anosmia, hyposmia, and dysgeusia in the absence of other respiratory disease such as",

On 26 March, the AAO-HNS released an anosmia reporting tool to assess for the significance of these symptoms in the diagnosis and progression of COVID-19. 22 In a study analysing the first 237 of the tool's entries, Kaye et al found that anosmia was present in 73% of subjects prior to COVID-19 diagnosis and was the initial symptom in 26.6%. The most common symptoms to present before anosmia included cough (41%), malaise (39%), fever (38%) and headache (37%). Gastrointestinal (GI) distress was the least likely symptom to present before anosmia, occurring in 10% of patients. 23 Similar to olfactory dysfunction, patients with COVID-19 presenting with GI symptoms have garnered particular media attention and have been subject to a recent study. In a study conducted among three hospitals in China, 18.6% of patients with COVID-19 presented with a GI-specific symptom, including diarrhoea, vomiting or abdominal pain. They also found that patients with COVID-19 may present with digestive symptoms, even in the absence of respiratory symptoms, although this occurred only in <1% of patients. 24 Similarly, in a study conducted in the USA involving 116 patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, 31.9% of patients reported GI symptoms. This included loss of appetite (22.3%), nausea/vomiting (12.0%) and diarrhoea (12.0%) as the most common GI symptoms. None of the patients in this study developed isolated GI symptoms or GI symptoms as an initial manifestation of SARS-CoV-2 infection. 25 Although more data are needed, it seems that anosmia and hypogeusia may be more likely as initial symptoms in COVID-19.",

Nonetheless, preliminary research suggests that gustatory or olfactory complaints during a viral pandemic should not be ignored. In a study based in the USA using a survey sent out to both patients positive for COVID-19 and patients negative for COVID-19 with influenza-like symptoms, smell and taste loss were reported in 68% (40/59) and 71% (42/59) of subjects positive for COVID-19, respectively, compared with 16% (33/203) and 17% (35/203) of patients negative for COVID-19 (p<0.001). Their results showed these chemosensory impairments were at least 10-fold more common in COVID-19-positive cases than COVID-19-negative cases, both presenting with similar influenza-like symptoms. 26 While the authors of this study did not reveal how many of these patients tested positive for influenza virus, 26 past studies have demonstrated that influenza is not significantly associated with change in smell. 27 Furthermore, postviral olfactory disorders due to other common viruses has an estimated prevalence of around 11%-40%, 28 which appears much less common than that seen with SARS-CoV-2 infection according to existing studies. Future research should also investigate the frequency of olfactory and gustatory dysfunctions in patients infected with influenza and other common viruses, in order to confirm the significance of its correlation with COVID-19.",
