Recently, Yan et al. shown that anosmia seems to be associated with a milder clinical course in patients with COVID-19. 6 Moein et al. suggested that 98% of 60 Iranian COVID-19 patients exhibited some olfactory dysfunction on objective testing; only 35% of these patients were aware of hyposmia/anosmia before testing. 7 The nuances around olfaction in COVID-19 appear to be associated with different clinical parameters than other symptoms, and, consequently, warrant further investigation.",
