It provides essential services for agricultural production, plant growth, animal habitation, biodiversity, carbon sequestration and environmental quality, which are crucial for achieving the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). However, soil degradation has occurred in many places throughout the world due to factors such as soil pollution, erosion, salinization, and acidification. In order to achieve the SDGs by the target date of 2030, soils may need to be used and managed in a manner that is more sustainable than is currently practiced. Here we show that research in the field of sustainable soil use and management should prioritize the multifunctional value of soil health and address interdisciplinary linkages with major issues such as biodiversity and climate change. As soil is the largest terrestrial carbon pool, as well as a significant contributor of greenhouse gases, much progress can be made toward curtailing the climate crisis by sustainable soil management practices. One identified option is to increase soil organic carbon levels, especially with recalcitrant forms of carbon (e.g., biochar application). In general, soil health is primarily determined by the actions of the farming community. Therefore, information management and knowledge sharing are necessary to improve the sustainable behavior of practitioners and end-users. Scientists and policy makers are important actors in this social learning process, not only to disseminate evidence-based scientific knowledge, but also in generating new knowledge in close collaboration with farmers. While governmental funding for soil data collection has been generally decreasing, newly available 5G telecommunications, big data and machine learning based data collection and analytical tools are maturing.",

This holistic approach accounts for non-linear mechanistic relationships between various physical, chemical, and biological properties. Moreover, the soil health holistic concept is advantageous over traditional soil quality assessments because it considers ecosystem services as well as agricultural production, i.e., both nature and human driven objectives (Kibblewhite et al., 2008) . (www.webofknowledge.com) when soil AND sustainability and \"soil health\" were searched as topics (searched on 3 rd March 2020). Doran and Zeiss (2000) defined soil health as \"the capacity of soil to function as a vital living system, within ecosystem and land-use boundaries, to sustain plant and animal productivity, maintain or enhance water and air quality, and promote plant and animal health\" Their definition has been well received by the scientific community, as evidenced by the article being cited ~1500 times according to Google Scholar. The authors argued that soil health is a holistic concept which portrays soil as a living system (i.e., the capacity of soil to function as a living system), while soil quality describes a soil's capacity for a specific use (i.e., fitness for different uses). The outcomes of soil use and management decisions are reflected in soil health (Doran and Safley, 1997) . Assessing soil health involves the selection of indicators, quantification or qualitative scoring, and providing a final index with appropriate weighting and integration (Rinot et al., 2019) .",

We propose that five broad issues have a root in soil science and are linked to at least one other discipline. The issues themselves are also interconnected. Take management and behavior as an example, which is directly linked to soil science and social science. At the same time, soil fertility and soil pollution are also involved, which are directly linked to agronomy and environmental science, respectively. Another example is soil carbon (or soil organic matter) which is directly linked to both soil science and climate science while also affecting soil J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Page 7 biodiversity linked to ecology, and soil fertility linked to agronomy.

Recently, increasing attention has been placed on SOC beyond the traditional sphere of soil science. This is because it is a key component of Earth's carbon cycle, thus having huge implications for the current climate crisis (Kell, 2012) and SDG13: Climate action. Soil is the largest terrestrial carbon pool, holding an estimated 1500-2400 GtC and permafrost (i.e. frozen soil) storing 1700 GtC (Le Quere et al., 2018) . A global initiative known as '4 per 1000', which aims to increase soil organic carbon by 0.4% per year, would result in an additional carbon storage of 1.2 GtC per year if successful (Paustian et al., 2016; Rumpel et al., 2018) . In Australia, surface soils provide a significant reservoir of carbon, holding ~19 billion metric tons. However, most of these soils (~75%) contain less than 1% SOC, suggesting huge additional capacity for carbon sequestration. An annual 0.8% increase in carbon storage across all Australian surface soils would fully offset the nation's GHG emissions (Baldock et al., 2010) Soil properties and vegetation are affected by the climatic condition (Bond-Lamberty et al., 2018) .",

Studies have shown that manure can potentially increase crop yields and soil organic contents in comparison with mineral fertilizers (Jing et al., 2019) . A 37-year field study showed that organic fertilization increased soil carbon input by 25% to 80%, although levels of carbon retention ranged from only 1.6% for green manure to 13.7% for fresh cattle manure (Maltas et al., 2018) . Similarly, Bolan et al., (2013) demonstrated that biosolid applications likely result in higher levels of carbon sequestration compared to other management strategies including fertilizer application and conservation tillage. This was attributed to an increased microbial biomass, and Fe and Al oxideinduced immobilization of carbon (Bolan et al., 2013) . In comparison with open-air systems, the use of organic fertilizers for indoor greenhouse soils may have a greater positive influence on soil functionality due to its effect on porosity and pore connectivity (Xu et al., 2019) . It should be noted that organic fertilizers may not increase crops yields to the levels achievable with inorganic fertilizers. This issue can be overcome by supplementing organic fertilizers with inorganic ones (Maltas et al., 2018) .",

These characteristics enable biochar to enhance soil moisture content, sorb polluting substances and increase soil pH (Andr\u00e9s et al., 2019) . Moreover, biochar is considered carbon negative because the carbon within its structure, which is captured from the atmosphere during biomass formation, is more recalcitrant in the natural environment than carbon in biomass that has not been pyrolized. Because of its carbon negativity and beneficial properties for soil management, biochar has been proposed as a possible technology to help mitigate climate change (Woolf et al., 2010) . Numerous studies have explored the usage of biochar in croplands (Laird et al., 2010b) , while recent studies have also examined its application in other systems, such as alpine grassland (Rafiq et al., 2019) .",

Therefore, researchers have conducted extensive research on the benefits biochar for agricultural and environmental purposes. One of the most researched areas is the use of biochar to increase crop yields. A recent meta-analysis found that in comparison with inorganic fertilizer alone, biochar can increase crop yields by 11% to 19% (95% confidence intervals) (Ye et al., 2020) . Biochar has also been put forward as a sustainable technique for remediating soils degraded by contaminants, especially heavy metals (Hou, 2020; O'Connor et al., 2018c; Song et al., 2019) . The sustainability of biochar is increased if the biomass feedstock is a biological waste that would otherwise be burned or discarded at landfill, thus avoiding air pollution or the consumption of landfill space. However, while a myriad of studies have shown biochar applications have positive effects on soil, it should be noted that such effects may diminish after 3~5 years (Dong et al., 2019) . Biochar effectiveness and longevity may be enhanced by the invention of engineered biochars (O'Connor et al., 2018b).",

In China, emissions derived from synthetic nitrogen fertilizers account for ~7% of the nation's annual GHG budget. By implementing new technology and best management practices that minimize nitrogen use in soil management, it is feasible to reduce GHG emissions by 102-357 Tg CO 2 -equivalent in China alone (Zhang et al., 2013) .

An early study found that the application of rice straw to paddy fields increased CH 4 emissions by a factor of 1.8 to 3.5 (Yagi and Minami, 1990) . Recently, methane emissions from permafrost (permanently frozen soil) has drawn attention from the climate science community, owing to its critical role in carbon cycling (Schuur et al., 2015) . As climate change occurs, rising temperature in the polar regions causes permafrost to thaw and microbial activity to increase (Hollesen et al., 2015) . This leads to increased methane and CO 2 emissions from organic-rich Arctic soils (Schuur et al., 2013) . As these gases are associated with increased global warming potential, their emission increases the levels of permafrost thaw, thus forming a positive feedback loop. It is imperative to understand these processes in a quantitative way. As the climate change crisis worsens, it may be necessary to take mitigating measures involving soil management in areas associated with high methane fluxes.",

Among other factors, soil microbial communities are affected by the availability of nutrients corresponding to the type of soil management practice (Bolan et al., 1996; Lauber et al., 2009; Leff et al., 2015) . For example, the use of soluble fertilizers (e.g., monocalcium phosphate), less soluble organic fertilizer (e.g., sugarcane filter cake) or nearly insoluble rock phosphate (Arruda et al., 2019) have different impacts on soil microbial communities. Soil management practices also affect soil hydraulics, which affects plant and microbial biodiversity and ecosystem resilience (Alley et al., 2002; Anderegg et al., 2018) . A study in India reported that integrating crop residue return with green manure application and no-tillage in a rice-wheat double cropping system increased SOC levels by 13%, the microbial biomass by 38%, the basal soil respiration rate by 33%, and the microbial quotient by 30% (Saikia et al., 2020) . Certain soil amendments are associated with increased soil biodiversity. For example, biochar amendment of a Mediterranean vineyard soil decreased the mineralization of both SOC and microbial biomass, while the functional microbial diversity and biodiversity of soil micro-arthropods were maintained (Andr\u00e9s et al., 2019) . Soil properties and biodiversity are also affected by plant root systems within the rhizosphere (Dey et al., 2012) .",

Earthworms (Oligochaeta) are a particularly important soil species due to their creation of soil macro-pores (> 0.3 mm) and channels (burrows) that increase water and gas infiltration rates (Bartz et al., 2013; Bhadauria and Saxena, 2010) . Thus earthworm activity can render soil environments that are more amenable to microbial activity and diversity (Eriksen-Hamel et al., 2009) . Conservation tillage practices that involve crop residue return to surface soils can increase earthworm numbers by hundreds of thousands per hectare (Barthod et al., 2018; Giannitsopoulos et al., 2020) ",

This value takes into account major ecosystem services, such as agricultural production, carbon sequestration, recreational usage, and wildlife diversity (Bateman et al., 2013) . However, some scholars have argued that systematic monetarization is unnecessary. For example, Bayesian Belief Networks (BBNs) and Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) methods can provide decision makers with semi-quantitative information that takes into account the multifunctionality of soil ecosystem services (Baveye et al., 2016) .",

The data shows that spatial heterogeneity within soil systems translates into the uneven distribution of ecosystem services (Aitkenhead and Coull, 2019) . Governments may intervene to restore or improve ecological services in limited soil systems. In China, for example, the government has made subsidies available to farmers to protect natural woodlands and convert steep agricultural cropland into other land uses, such as grassland or woodland (Liu et al., 2008) . If farmland is degraded to an extent that it is abandoned, soil treatments may help bring about natural revegetation and the recovery of ecosystem services . Contaminants are an issue for many agricultural sites (Bolan et al., 2014; Khan, 2016; O'Connor et al., 2019b; Wilcke, 2000) , which hinders efforts toward the achievement of the United Nations' SDGs (e.g., SDG3: Good health and well-being). Soil contaminants include heavy metals, such as cadmium (Cd), copper (Cu), lead (Pb), mercury (Hg) and zinc (Zn), and organic pollutants, such as pesticides and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). As an emerging contaminant, microplastics in the soil environment have also drawn attention in recent years (Bradney et al., 2019; Jia et al., 2020; O'Connor et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020a) .

Anthropogenic soil pollution in under-developed regions where industrial activities are less intensive can also occur due to traffic and mining related emissions, etc. For instance, a recent study in a suburban area of Central Asia showed that Pb, Zn, and Cu can accumulate to high levels in soils because of road traffic up to 200 m away .",

The potential for soil leaching is also affected by soil management practices that alter the chemical composition of soil. For instance, liming is a common farming method to increase soil pH and reduce flocculation. However, recent J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Page 19 studies have suggested that soil particle surfaces become more negatively charged as soil pH increases. Therefore, liming activity may lead to soil-bound harmful substances, such as perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), leaching from soil and entering groundwater systems (Oliver et al., 2019) . In New Zealand, intensified agricultural production on steep landscapes, which is encouraged by the government's policy to significantly increase agricultural exports, has involved the replacement of perennial pastures with winter forage crops. This has increased the use agrochemicals, including glyphosate and diazinon, which not only pose an environmental risk in themselves, but also facilitate the leaching of organic carbon and nitrogen (Chibuike et al., 2019) . The reporting of such unintended consequences reinforces the importance of comprehensive assessments for sustainable soil use and management. It should be noted that certain soil amendments, such as biochar, have been shown to reduce soil nutrient leaching potential (Laird et al., 2010a) .",
