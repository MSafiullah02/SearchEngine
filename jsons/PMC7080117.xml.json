Thoracic lymphadenopathy was defined as lymph node size of \u2265 10 mm in short-axis; ground glass opacification was defined as hazy opacity that did not obscure underlying bronchial and vascular margins (Figs. 1 and 2); consolidation was defined as opacification with obscuration of bronchial structures and pulmonary vessels [7]; crazy paving pattern was defined as ground glass opacification with associated interlobular septal thickening [8] (Fig. 3).

A previous study identified that ground glass opacities on CT images correspond to pathological diffuse alveolar damage [11]. Histologically, the opacity of ground glass may be caused by alveoli filled with blood, pus, water, or cells. The CT imaging features of viral pneumonia are associated with the pathogenesis of viral infection. Most viral pneumonia shares similar imaging features in the same Viridae family because of similarities in the pathogenesis [12]. SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the family Coronaviridae, so, as expected, the imaging features of SARS-CoV-2 are similar to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infection. Nonetheless, unilateral involvement is more common than multifocal involvement in the early phase of SARS and MERS [13, 14]. In our study, the majority of patients showed multifocal involvement in the initial chest CT scan, and this finding is consistent with a recent report [8]. However, whether this finding is a characteristic feature of the SARS-CoV-2 distinguished from the other two coronaviruses remains to be confirmed by further studies.",
