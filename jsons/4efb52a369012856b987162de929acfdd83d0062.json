            "text": "The prolonged lockdown of health services providing high-complexity fertility treatments -as currently recommended by many reproductive medicine entities-is detrimental for society as a whole, and infertility patients in particular. Globally, approximately 0.3% of all infants born every year are conceived using assisted reproductive technology (ART) treatments. By contrast, the total number of COVID-19 deaths reported so far represents approximately 1.0% of the total deaths expected to occur worldwide over the first three months of the current year. It seems, therefore, that the number of infants expected to be conceived and born -but who will not be so due to the lockdown of infertility services-might be as significant as the total number of deaths attributed to the COVID-19 pandemic. We herein propose remedies that include a prognostic-stratification of more vulnerable infertility cases in order to plan a progressive restart of worldwide fertility treatments. At a time when preventing complications and limiting burdens for national health systems represent relevant issues, our viewpoint might help competent authorities and health care providers to identify patients who should be prioritized for the continuation of fertility care in a safe environment.",

The remarkable increase in COVID-19 cases raises the prospect of massive hospitalizations that no healthcare system in the world can manage. The urgent need to avoid this scenario is the justification for the implemented restrictions, and reproductive medicine societies decisively followed by issuing expert guidance based best judgment. With a solid consensus, the key recommendations for practitioners include suspension of new fertility treatments -ovulation induction, intrauterine insemination (IUI), and in vitro fertilization (IVF)-as well as non-urgent gamete cryopreservation, cancellation of all embryo transfers, whether fresh or frozen and suspension of elective surgery and non-urgent diagnostic procedures [1, 2] . Exceptions are those patients who are currently 'in-cycle' or who require urgent fertility preservation due to cancer treatment.",

However, taking the above mentioned into account, we would like to raise a novel and constructive viewpoint. Our concern is that a prolonged lockdown of fertility treatment will be detrimental to both patients and society. Moreover, the fertility community is uncertain about how to optimally provide care to infertile patients -without compromising safety-once the restart of fertility services is established. Thus, we aim at proposing remedies to mitigate the long-term consequences of a prolonged cessation of infertility treatment and to help regulatory authorities and health care providers identify which patients might be prioritized for the continuation of fertility care in a safe environment.",

In total, more than two million COVID-19 cases have been reported, 97% of which have been defined as mild. Among the severe or critical cases, the overwhelming majority affects people aged 50 and above. By contrast, the death rate among people at reproductive age is 0.2%, with an estimated 1.5:1 male to female ratio, mainly affecting those with pre-existing conditions, including cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, obesity, hypertension, and cancer [3] .",

Presently, we do not know how long the suspension of fertility treatments will last; however, estimates ranging from 3 to 12 months or even longer have been suggested, depending on how effective governments implement quarantine measures and how long it takes to acquire herd immunity.

Based on female age, ovarian reserve, and previous history of ovarian stimulation -if available-, 'low prognosis' patients were stratified into four specific subgroups, each of which with a distinct prognosis concerning the likelihood of conceiving and delivering a baby with the use of ART (Supplementary Figure 3) . The primary aim of the Poseidon criteria was to provide patient counselling and clinical guidance regarding interventions that could help these patients conceive in the shortest possible time. The most vulnerable Poseidon patients are those within groups 2 and 4, i.e., ageing patients 35 years or above, with (i) an unexpected suboptimal number of oocytes retrieved in a previous ART cycle despite a normal ovarian reserve (group 2), or (ii) low ovarian reserve in whom the number of oocytes resulting from ovarian stimulation is invariably low (group 4) [12, 15, 16] . The reason relates to the impact of maternal age and number of oocytes on the availability of euploid embryos, and thus, live birth. In particular, Poseidon group 4 patients are running out of time, and any further delay in treatment might imply the loss of a future opportunity to obtain a biological child. Indeed, the percentage of initiated ART cycles resulting in a live birth is estimated to be 41.5% in women younger than 35 years; however, these numbers dramatically decrease with ageing, being less than 5% in women above 40 years [17] .",

Immediate oocyte or embryo cryopreservation could represent the only opportunity to obtain a pregnancy after the end of gonadotoxic treatment. At present, the prevailing consensus is to allow fertility preservation programs to continue for oncological patients. On the other hand, more prudence concerning embryo transfer is proposed. Notably, as new scenarios emerge, even embryo transfer could be challenging to postpone in some specific subgroups of patients. For instance, in women with endocrine responsive breast cancers, an international panel of oncologists have proposed a temporary interruption in endocrine therapy to allow patients to obtain natural or assisted conception [20, 21] . In these women, the full course of endocrine therapy, which for some cases might be at least 5-10 years, could dramatically decrease natural fecundity after finalisation of therapy. According to the POSITIVE trial approach, the therapeutic suspension 'window' should not be longer than 24 months to allow patients to conceive and deliver [20] . If no conception occurs, patients must restart adjuvant therapy. If such an approach is validated, and importantly, the trial is still ongoing, every strategy to obtain a pregnancy within this short timeframe, including IVF and embryo transfer, should be considered without further delay.",

A classic example includes systemic autoimmune diseases (SADs), which are not uncommon in women of reproductive age. In these patients, the chronic inflammation might affect the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis and the ovaries directly, causing impairment of the ovarian reserve [22] [23] [24] . Moreover, gonadotoxic drugs (e.g., alkylating agents) and teratogenic agents (e.g., Mycophenolate mofetil) are commonly used to control the inflammatory processes in patients with SADs. In these patients, fertility preservation is conditioned to the \"remission window\" [25] . In other words, the inflammatory process has to be restrained before ovarian stimulation and pregnancy can be considered. Thus, it has been recommended that women with SADs (e.g., systemic lupus erythematosus, antiphospholipid antibody syndrome, rheumatoid arthritis, systemic sclerosis, Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome, mixed connective tissue disease, idiopathic inflammatory myopathies and vasculitis, among others) only embark on ART after at least 6 months of clinical remission has elapsed [25] . Several patients with SADs seeking fertility might have been planning this 'window' for a considerable time, which unfortunately occurred during the COVID-19 crisis -postponing IVF in these patients compromises their reproductive chances considerably.",

Due to the fact that Poseidon group 3 patients are younger than 35 years and, therefore, the oocyte/embryo euploidy rate is over 50%, the number of oocytes required to have at least one euploid embryo in these patients is lower than in older patients (e.g., 35 years and older) in whom the oocyte/ embryo euploidy rate is below 50% overall (e.g., Poseidon groups 2 and 4). Nevertheless, it is not unlikely that when the ovarian reserve is dramatically reduced, the remaining window to respond to ovarian stimulation is narrow. In reality, this scenario is not very different from the pre-chemotherapy situation. On this basis, we believe that Poseidon group 3 patients should be allowed the same permissive approach for fertility preservation as suggested for women who need to undergo chemotherapy.",

The ART calculator could be used to estimate the number of oocytes required to achieve at least one euploid embryo for transfer [10, 11] . v. Personalizing the gonadotropin dose for ovarian stimulation and use of a GnRH antagonist protocol, followed by GnRH agonist triggering, and elective freezing of oocytes or embryos should be the first choice during this emergency period. vi.

Face to face visits should be limited for infertile patients who demand immediate treatment. Proper personal protective equipment (PPE) should be used by patients and healthcare providers during care provision. 7.

In closed-controlled air systems, the airflow might produce an increase in the viral spread from potential asymptomatic patients. Thus, special attention should be given to air quality control, including the use of air filtration systems and air pressurization, particularly in surgical and laboratory areas [27] . 9. Adherence to regulatory infection prevention recommendations should be of utmost importance for patients and health practitioners [28] . This advice includes the use of appropriate PPE by staff, adherence to social distancing measures for staff and patients, and staggering appointments so that no patients are waiting together in the clinic waiting area. 10. The importance of training of ART staff (clinicians, embryologists, nurses) on PPE needs and usage is stressed. 11. Good standard laboratory practices should be strictly applied when handling gametes and embryos within the embryology and andrology laboratories. 12. A thorough discussion between patients and health care professionals should be made for responsible shared decisions, and psychological support should be an option for those in need. 13. Advanced planning should guide the restart of ART services. Working groups and quality managers should design scenarios on which patients to prioritize, how working lists should be filled and staff scheduling.",

We realize that much is unknown about the implications of COVID-19 for early-and late pregnancy, including maternal-fetal transmission and teratogenicity [29, 30] . However, pregnancy can act as a comorbidity, and we, therefore, currently recommend against conception by ART in most cases. However, it should also be acknowledged that new serology testing is being developed to help identify individuals who have had the infection and have recovered, suggesting that those people are now immune to the virus and could be allowed IVF treatment [31] . Likewise, as IVF health care professionals recover from COVID-19 infections and acquire immunity, there will be less risk of recommencing care, particularly in COVID-19 recovered patients. Along these lines, immune patients will have a low risk of pregnancy complications in the event of an embryo transfer, or of propagating the disease when attending a medical facility. Yet, the accuracy of these tests has been debated and it is still unclear how long any immunity lasts and if reinfection is possible [32] . Given the likelihood that this pandemic will continue for many months ahead, we must keep an open mind, and look for what is -and not for fear of what might be.",

The novel system relies on female age, ovarian reserve markers, ovarian sensitivity to exogenous gonadotropin, and the number of oocytes retrieved, which will both identify the patients with low prognosis and stratify such patients into one of four groups of women with \"expected\" or \"unexpected\" impaired ovarian response to exogenous gonadotropin stimulation. According to these criteria, four distinct groups of low prognosis patients can be established (left). Group 1: Patients < 35 years with sufficient prestimulation ovarian reserve parameters (AFC \u22655, AMH \u22651.2 ng/mL) and with an unexpected poor or suboptimal ovarian response. This group is further divided into subgroup 1a, constituted by patients with fewer than four oocytes, and subgroup 1b, constituted by patients with four to nine oocytes retrieved after standard ovarian stimulation. Group 2: Patients \u226535 years with sufficient prestimulation. Ovarian reserve parameters (AFC \u22655, AMH \u22651.2 ng/mL) and with an unexpected poor or suboptimal ovarian response. This group is further divided into subgroup 2a, constituted by patients with fewer than four oocytes, and subgroup 2b, constituted by patients with four to nine oocytes retrieved after standard ovarian stimulation. Group 3: Patients < 35 years with poor ovarian reserve prestimulation parameters (AFC < 5, AMH < 1.2 ng/mL). Group 4: Patients \u226535 years with poor ovarian reserve prestimulation parameters (AFC < 5, AMH. < 1.2 ng/mL). Owing to low oocyte numbers and less embryos produced, POSEIDON patients have lower cumulative live birth rates per started cycle than non-POSEIDON counterparts. However, the prognosis is differentially affected by oocyte quantity and female age, as the latter relates to the risk of embryo aneuploidy (right). Art drawing by Chlo\u00e9 Xilinas.
