Although more than 85% of feedlots in the United States use a vaccination protocol for viruses that contribute to the development of BRD, the number of cases has not decreased (Gifford et al., 2012; APHIS, 2013). Therefore, effective prevention and/or early detection strategies for BRD must be developed to reduce its incidence in cattle. Prevention and diagnosis of BRD is further complicated by the complexity of this disease. Stress, inadequate nutrition, poor management, and/or genetics predispose cattle to polymicrobial respiratory infections (Ellis, 2001; Duff and Galyean, 2007), increasing an animal's susceptibility to contracting BRD.",

However, to improve accuracy of selection, the genetic component of BRD must be delineated. Immune system traits such as cortisol, IgG and its subclasses (IgG1 and IgG2), and IL-8 all influence an individual's response to stress and immune system function (Stanley et al., 1984; Hull et al., 2001; Salak-Johnson and McGlone, 2007). Deciphering the genetic relationships among immune system traits will aid in predicting an individual's likelihood to develop BRD. We hypothesized that immune system traits measured at receiving were genetically correlated with BRD. The long-term aim of this research is to elucidate both genotypic and phenotypic relationships of BRD with physiological, behavioral, and performance traits. Specifically, the objectives of this study were to 1) estimate the genetic variation of BRD and immune system traits (i.e., cortisol, IgG, and IL-8), 2) evaluate the genetic relationships with BRD and immune traits measured prior to the onset of illness, and 3) assess the genetic relationships within immune system traits.",

Prior to shipping, cattle were vaccinated in Nebraska against bovine viral diarrhea, Pasteurella multocida, and Mannheimia haemolytica (Pyramid 2 + Type II BVD and Presponse SQ; Boehringer Ingelheim Vetmedica Inc., St. Joseph, MO) before weaning and again at weaning. Year 1 cattle were not vaccinated on arrival at the feedlot. However, at the request of the commercial feedlot owners in yr 2, cattle were vaccinated on feedlot entry for common viral and bacterial agents associated with BRD: bovine viral diarrhea, Pasteurella multocida, and Mannheimia haemolytica (Pyramid 2 + Type II BVD and Presponse SQ). This difference in vaccination protocols resulted in 45% of steers developing BRD in yr 1 and 7% in yr 2 (Table 1), which more accurately reflects the range of vaccination procedures in the beef industry (i.e., no vaccinations versus multiple vaccinations). All steers received oral and pour-on parasiticides, oxfendazole (Synanthic Suspension 9.06%; Boehringer Ingelheim Vetmedica Inc.) and ivermectin (ProMectin B Pour-on; Vedco, Inc., St. Joseph, MO) on arrival to the feedlot. In yr 1, growth promotants containing 80 mg trenbolone acetate and 16 mg estradiol (Revalor-IS; Intervet/Schering-Plough, Millsboro, DE) were administered per feedlot recommendation with a reimplant after 72 d on feed. In yr 2, cattle were implanted with a 200 d delayed releasing growth promotant of 200 mg trenbolone acetate and 40 mg estradiol (Revalor XS; Intervet/Schering-Plough). Collection of repeated phenotypic performance data (i.e., chute score, flight time, processing time, weight, and growth measurements via ultrasound) occurred on arrival and on d 73 and 130 in yr 1 and d 85 and 148 in yr 2. Approximately 10 mL of blood was collected via jugular venipuncture using vacutainers containing EDTA for whole-genome genotyping. Whole blood was shipped to Zoetis (Kalamazoo, MI) for DNA extraction and genotyping using the Bovine SNP50 BeadChip (Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA).

Clinical signs included eye discharge, nasal discharge, cough, lethargy, rapid breathing, and atypical interstitial pneumonia or acute upper respiratory syndrome. Rectal temperature was regarded to be an overall determining factor because it is less subjective than visual appraisal alone.

Steers with rectal temperatures above 39.7\u00b0C or exhibiting multiple clinical signs of BRD within 7 d of the initial treatment received a second BRD treatment of fluoroquinolone (Baytril; Bayer Animal Health, Leverkusen, Germany). Steers were monitored for 5 d, reevaluated, and treated a third time using oxytetracycline (Bio-Mycin 200; Boehringer Ingelheim Vetmedica Inc.) if exhibiting BRD signs. Animals that were previously treated and recovered from BRD but again developed clinical signs of BRD continued on a treatment protocol based on the last treatment record. Steers requiring >3 treatments were removed from the study with further treatment protocols made at the discretion of the commercial feedlot. All other illnesses lacking sufficient evidence of BRD were treated as diagnosed (e.g., bloat, lameness, and pinkeye). Similar to the feedlot, while at the SECRC, steers with clinical signs of BRD were fed a commercial diet (66 Mcal/hundredweight DM).

Number of observations, calf age, breed, and environmental conditions of the stressor (i.e., shipping versus a squeeze chute) all differed with each study making it difficult to compare immune trait levels across studies. Limited information is available on immune system traits in receiving beef steers; therefore, it was difficult to assess if plasma levels were typical of this age or if differing levels were attributed to environmental conditions. Immune system trait plasma levels were within the expected range of the kits used, but it should be noted that levels varied greatly among steers.",

These results provide evidence to suggest that improvement on BRD is possible through genetic selection.

Limited research was previously published describing the heritability of cortisol; however, stress research in pigs demonstrated cortisol is moderately heritable (h2 = 0.40; Kadarmideen and Janss, 2007). Although steers in the current study were not intentionally stressed, the act of shipping creates a stressed phenotype in some animals. A low to moderate heritability for cortisol suggested that steers varied in their innate response to environmental stressors, potentially leaving them more or less susceptible to illness. Based on the negative genetic correlation with BRD and the moderate heritability, cortisol levels measured after shipping may serve as a potential candidate for selection for BRD susceptibility.",

Initially, the negative genetic relationship between cortisol and BRD was surprising, as prior reports indicated that cortisol levels increase after transportation, thereby increasing an animal's susceptibility to disease (Jericho, 1979; Slocombe et al., 1984). However, when exposed to acute stressors, the immune system will react in an immunoprotective manner (Salak-Johnson and McGlone, 2007; Carroll and Forsberg, 2007; Dhabhar, 2009). In our study, cortisol was measured after shipping, which would constitute an acute stressor. Therefore, this may, in part, explain why there was a negative genetic correlation between cortisol and BRD. Additionally, McGlone et al. (1993) determined that there was a moderate phenotypic correlation (rp = 0.35, P = 0.036) between natural killer cell cytotoxicity and plasma cortisol concentrations. It is possible that cortisol secretion after an acute stressor versus a chronic stressor is a different trait from a genetic standpoint; therefore, phenotypic relationships observed in previous research may not translate to a genetic observation. Therefore, more research must be conducted to elucidate these effects.",

            "text": "Total IgG, IgG1, and IgG2 are major components of the humoral immune system that are part of the adaptive immune response that protects cattle against bacterial and viral challenges (Stanley et al., 1984). These data suggested that selection for total IgG and/or IgG1 could impact whether a steer developed BRD. Interestingly, there was no apparent genetic relationship between IgG2 and BRD. In cattle, IgG levels have been reported to decrease after shipping (Kegley et al., 1997). Immunoglobulin G1 has been shown to increase in allergy-type reactions and indicate a T helper 2 response (Kemeny et al., 1986), whereas IgG2 increases suggest a stronger T helper 1 response and T cell memory (Estes and Brown, 2002). Also, in the presence of encapsulated bacteria such as Mannheimia haemolytica, a key bacterium involved in BRD, IgG2 was increased. Immunoglobulin G2 antibodies have also been shown to be associated with reduced incidence of cattle becoming infected with respiratory bovine coronaviruses (Lin et. al., 2000, 2001). As IgG1 makes up the majority of total IgG and has a differing mode of regulation compared with IgG2, it is plausible that the genetic relationship between IgG1 and IgG2 with BRD would differ. To date, genetic relationships between BRD status and total IgG or isotypes of IgG have not been reported in the literature. These results suggested that negative selection pressure for IgG and IgG1 and positive selection pressure for plasma cortisol may result in progeny less susceptible to developing BRD.",

Interleukin 8 is a cytokine that serves as a chemoattractant signal, recruiting neutrophils to the sight of infection (Hull et al., 2001). Phenotypically, Caswell et al. (1998) demonstrated that IL-8 expression was upregulated in lesions of pneumonic pasteurellosis in beef calves. It was concluded that IL-8 is integral to the recruitment of neutrophils to establish lesions in cattle with pneumonia. In vitro, low levels of Pasteurella haemolytica, a Gram-negative bacterium associated with BRD, induced high concentrations of IL-8 (Morsey et al., 1996). Similar to previous phenotypic reports, there appears to be a moderate positive genetic correlation between IL-8 and BRD. Therefore, genetic selection against IL-8 may decrease a steer's susceptibility to developing BRD. Although a moderate genetic correlation existed between BRD and IL-8, further investigation is warranted to determine if IL-8 is useful as a predictor of BRD.",

Human maternal total IgG is composed of 52% IgG1, 40% IgG2, 2% IgG3, and 2% IgG4 (Hashira et al., 2000). Similar ratios would be expected for cattle, but immunoglobulins 3 and 4 were not measured; therefore, specific ratios could not be determined. However, as expected, concentrations of total IgG > IgG1 > IgG2. Because of this relationship, strong genetic correlations were expected between total IgG and isoforms, which was confirmed given the \u22650.83 \u00b1 0.09 genetic correlation. Also, there was a strong genetic correlation between IgG1 and IgG2 (0.55 \u00b1 0.16). Although total IgG and isoforms differ in phenotypic function, the strong genetic correlation between total IgG and isoforms suggests that they are under similar genetic control. However, the genetic correlation between IgG1 and IgG2 suggested they differ genetically. Selection for total IgG will subsequently impact both IgG1 and IgG2. Selection for IgG1 or IgG2 will influence the other isoform, but not as strongly.",

(1992) determined that IL-8 had little influence on in vitro secretion of IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, or IgG4. Previous phenotypic relationships between IL-8 and IgG and isoforms confirm weak genetic correlation estimates determined in the current study. Results suggested that selection for IL-8 will have little impact on total IgG or isoforms and vice versa. Interleukin 8 is a chemoattractant that impacts neutrophil production, influences innate immune response through angiogenesis (Murphy, 2008), and is inhibited by cortisol (Dovio et al., 2004; Sorenson et al., 2012). Therefore, a decrease in cortisol levels should increase IL-8 production, potentially leading to increased pain and inflammation. However, because only a low genetic correlation was observed, the genetic relationship between cortisol with IL-8 appeared to be minimal at best in these animals. Overall, IgG, IgG1, IgG2, and cortisol appeared to be largely independent of IL-8. Therefore, it is possible to develop a selection index for BRD susceptibility that includes cortisol, total IgG, and IL-8 without confounding genetic relationships among component traits.",

Specifically, heritability estimates and genetic relationships of cortisol and IgG with BRD suggest herd health may be improved through 1) genetic selection with breeding values and selection indices and/or 2) improvement of the BRD phenotype through incorporation of immune traits in receiving management strategies. Admittedly, measurement of these parameters for use in management may be difficult given sample collection and time needed to deliver results from these diagnostic assays. This study described genetic relationships between treatment for BRD, stress hormones, and immune system traits. Several parameters had a favorable genetic relationship with BRD and may be useful to direct future research to reduce the incidence of BRD through genetic improvement. This is especially useful establishing a genetic selection model, because establishing a pedigree and relevant environmental factors to BRD is difficult; therefore, genetic improvement must be primarily driven through advancements in application and development of genomic prediction technologies.",
