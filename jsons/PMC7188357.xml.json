The two PCR products were then amplified in a second round of PCR, by using p1 and p2 as primers, to generate a 300\u2010bp fragment of LLPM1 and LLPM2 containing the desired mutations in LLP1 and LLP2 domains. Then LLP1 was used as the template to generate the mutant of LLPM3, which contains both mutations in LLP1 and LLP2 domains.

When the purified LLP12 protein (wild type) was eluted at 12 min, it was shown that LLP12 was prone to self\u2010assemble into a complex over 150 kDa (Figure 3B). In comparison to LLP12, the fractionation peak of LLPM1 was observed about 1 min later. Therefore, the mutations in LLP1 domain demonstrably decreased the multimerization potential of LLP12 protein. However, the LLPM2 mutant was eluted almost at the same time as the wild type, suggesting that the mutants in LLP2 domain did not affect the multimerization formation of the whole protein (LLP12). Then LLPM3 mutant was eluted almost at the same time as LLPM1, which could be explained based on the previous results.

The binding affinities of the mouse antisera and all four involved proteins, together with GST as the proper control, were proved in ELISA (Figure 4E). To further test the changes in intermembrane\u2010binding ability in vivo, LLP12 fused with EGFP was inserted into pCDNA3 plasmid, which was then transfected into 293T cells. These cells were examined under fluorescence microscope 24 h later (Figure 4F). There were intense fluorescence signals in the perinuclear area of EGFP\u2010LLP12 in contrast to EGFP control, and this confirmed previous research studies on LLP12 intermembrane\u2010binding ability (12). A similar phenomenon was observed in cells transfected with EGFP\u2010LLPM1, EGFP\u2010LLPM2, and EGFP\u2010LLPM3, indicating that none of these mutants notably affected their intermembrane targeting signal on LLP12.

Based on the interest to find the possible explanation for the decreased infectivity in these mutated viruses, we examined the multimeric potential and membrane\u2010binding ability of LLP12 and its mutants in this study.

Besides, cytoplasmic domains of 13 different viruses selected randomly from NCBI were compared with LLP12 to show relative highly arginine residues proportion in LLP12 (Figure 1B), indicating that high conservation and high proportion of arginine residues in LLP12 is a typical structural property of HIV\u20101 gp41. Based on these analyses, three mutants were constructed with substitutions of arginine to alanine in either the LLP1 (LLPM1) or the LLP2 (LLPM2) or in both domains LLP12 (LLPM3) to study the effects of certain conserved arginine residues for the structure and function of LLP12 domain. Both of main properties of LLP12, multimerization potential and cellular membrane\u2010binding ability, were identified by comparison with these mutants. It proved that the mutations in LLP1 domain significantly decreased the multimerization potential of LLP12 protein (Figure 3), which may be due to the secondary structural alteration by two arginine substitutions in LLP1. Furthermore, all three mutants showed an impaired ability in binding to the outer membrane of 293T cells (Figure 4). However, none of these mutants notably affected their intermembrane targeting signal on LLP12. One possibility might be that certain membrane proteins were involved in this membrane\u2010binding process, such as in the case of calmodulin (7, 16, 17, 18). But this hypothesis was not further proved because of the limitation of our detection methods. Comparing our results with previous virus experiments by others, it seems that both important biochemical properties of LLP12 domain on HIV\u20101 gp41 could be involved in viral infectivity and the HIV\u20101 Env\u2010mediated cell fusion. The different biochemical properties changes caused by respective mutations in LLP1 and LLP2 suggested their different roles in fusion reaction.",

The three\u2010dimensional structural differences between wide\u2010type HIV\u20101 virions and cytoplasmic tail\u2010truncated SIV virions also suggest a direct inter\u2010Env interaction mediated by the cytoplasmic (22). In the present study, we purified the LLP12 segments with no tag add\u2010on using bacterial expression system (Figure 2) and analyzed the multimeric potential of HIV gp41 LLP12 domain, which provided a more direct method to study the biochemical properties of this domain, comparing with the synthetic peptides or recombinant proteins (14, 23, 24). LLP12 and LLPM2 (each with a MW of approximately 10 kDa) were eluted as complexes that were apparently larger than 150 kDa (Figure 3B). This finding indicated that they assembled into a higher\u2010ordered form, such as possibly a tetramer of tetrameric forms. Similarly, we incubated the HeLa cells with LLP12 protein and examined the membrane\u2010binding ability through anti\u2010LLP12 sera, providing a more direct binding ability of LLP12 domain to cellular outermembrane.",

It has been reported that the Env mutant with a point mutation in the fusion domain dominantly interferes with fusion and infectivity (25). Like the N\u2010terminal peptide, the biological properties of the usually long C\u2010terminal cytoplasmic domain of gp41 influence the virus entry into host cells in various ways. Our present study showed the more direct evidence of some intrinsic features of LLP12 domain and provided the possible link between mutation caused defective in virus infectivity and changes in biological functions. It is likely that the LLP12 segment organize into highly ordered forms and such bind viral membranes to take part in the membrane fusion progress. Our study may provide insight into the structural and functional role of the conserved gp41 cytoplasmic LLP12 domain in membrane fusion and may help to unravel the complex process of Env\u2010mediated virus\u2013cell fusion.",
