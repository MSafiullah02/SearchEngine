The\ninternational scientific community is struggling to find new substances capable of\ncontrasting the SARS-CoV-2 virus. A straightforward strategy to disclose compounds\nreadily available to clinicians is drug repurposing, i.e. the use of drugs that\nwere previously approved by the FDA for a different therapeutic indication. A few\npromising compounds against SARS-CoV-2 were identified through drug repurposing,\ne.g. remdesivir, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, tocilizumab, etc., but their\ntherapeutic efficacy in COVID-19 patients is still debated. On the other hand,\nextensive screenings are conducted on thousands of novel molecules using\ncombinatorial libraries or in silico docking experiments to\ndiscover new effective antiviral agents. Despite the intense research efforts, we\nwere surprised to learn that no metal compound is currently being\ntested against the SARS-CoV-2 virus.1 Metal based agents form a\nvariegate and attractive class of drugs with a number of therapeutic applications:\nwe strongly encourage the international scientific community to fill this gap\nquickly and explore the potential of metallodrugs against COVID-19 disease.",

It is worth reminding that AF, in the case of HIV\ninfection, was found to be more effective than hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine\nin interfering with several processes involved in viral production, latency, and\nviral reactivation as well as in the reduction of the viral reservoir.5 Similarly to tocilizumab, AF was reported to interfere with the\ninterleukin 6 signaling by inhibiting phosphorylation of JAK1 and STAT3, to\ninhibit few selected proteases and to bind preferentially to free cysteine\nresidues in proteins, e.g. in cysteine proteases.6Based on these arguments, we support the off label quick evaluation of AF\nin COVID-19 patients.",

In addition, AF was found to dramatically reduce the expression of\nSARS-COV-2-induced cytokines in human cells, in line with the previous\nobservations.
