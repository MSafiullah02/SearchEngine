Subtools used for this consisted of BWA 0.7.1726 for indexing and mapping, SAMtools 1.627 for generating bam files, SAMtools view version 1.7 for filtering out unmapped reads using the setting -G 12, and Picard SamToFastq version 2.18.4 and seqtk for generating FASTQ files with 250,000 reads. The contigs from the reAssembly pipeline were then processed for a second using SPADES, with setting the cov-cutoff to five. The resulting contigs were then processed with the reAssembly pipeline for the third and last time, setting the cov-cutoff in SPADES to 20.",

Such application would require the careful definition and validation of several parameters to enable the accurate assessment of a clinical sample with regard to the presence or absence of a pathogen, to fulfill current accreditation guidelines. Therefore, this study has initiated the optimization of several steps throughout the presequencing and post-sequencing workflow, which are considered essential for sensitive and specific mNGS-based virus detection. Many virus discovery or virus diagnostic protocols have focused on the enrichment of viral particles32 with the intention to increase the relative amount of virus reads. However, these methods are laborious and intrinsically exclude viral nucleic acid located in host cells. Herein, a sample pretreatment protocol was designed with potential for: i) automation, ii) pan-pathogen detection, and iii) detection of intracellular viral nucleic acids. Consequently, any type of viral enrichment was excluded (filtration, centrifugation, nucleases, and rRNA removal). The current protocol enabled high-throughput sample pretreatment by means of automated nucleic acid extraction and without depletion of bacterial or human genome, with potential for pan-pathogen detection. Several adaptations in the bioinformatic script resulted in more accurate reporting of the classification output.",

The amount of internal control reads and target virus reads has been reported to be dependent on the amount of background reads (negative correlation).34 In our protocol, the internal controls were used as qualitative controls but may be used as indicator of the amount of background. PhHV1 showed less linearity in the dilution series, compared with EAV, which may be indicative for a potential relative difference in efficiency of amplification of PhHV1 viral sequences. Because NCBI's databases were lacking a complete PhHV1 genome, the Centrifuge index building and classification was limited to classification on a higher taxonomic rank. To achieve classification of PhHV1 at the species level, the whole genome of PhHV1 was sequenced; and based on the gained sequence reads, the genome was built.25 The proposed nearly complete genome of PhHV1 was submitted to NCBI's GenBank database.",

Five viruses, which were not recovered by mNGS, had high Cq values, >30 (ie, a relatively low viral load). This may be a drawback of the retrospective nature of this clinical evaluation as RNA viruses may be degraded because of storage and freeze-thaw steps, resulting in lower sensitivity of mNGS. A correlation was found between read counts and PCR Cq value, demonstrating the quantitative nature of viral detection by mNGS. Discrepancies between the Cq values and the number of mNGS reads may be explained by unrepresentative Cq values (eg, by primer mismatch for highly divergent viruses, like rhinoviruses/enteroviruses and differences in sensitivity of mNGS for several groups of viruses, as has been reported by others).35 In addition, viral pathogens were detected that were not targeted by the routine PCR assays, including influenza C virus, which is typical of the unbiased nature of the method. In addition, although not within the scope of this study, bacterial pathogens, including Bordetella pertussis (qPCR confirmed), were also detected. In the current study, only viruses were targeted because these could be well compared with qPCR results; bacterial targets remain to be studied in clinical sample types as sputum or bronchoalveolar lavages that are more suitable for bacterial detection. The analytical specificity of mNGS appeared to be high, especially with a cutoff of 15 reads. However, the clinical specificity, the relevance of the lower read numbers, still needs further investigation in clinical studies.",

This problem could be attributed to index hopping (index misassignment), as described earlier.36 Because of the chemistry, essential for the increased speed, the HiSeq 4000 is more prone to index hopping between neighboring samples. Although the percentage of reads that contributed to the index hopping was low, this is critical for clinical viral diagnostics, as this is aimed specifically at low abundance targets.36\n,\n37\n",

Default settings of this pipeline resulted in higher rates of both false-positive and false-negative results. NCBI's nucleotide database includes a wide variety of unannotated viral sequences, such as partial sequences and (chimeric) constructs, in contrast to the curated and well-annotated sequences in NCBI's RefSeq database, which resulted in a higher specificity. In addition to the database, settings for the assignment algorithm were adapted as well. The assignment settings were adjusted to unique assignment in the case of homology to the lowest common ancestor. This modification resulted in higher sensitivity and specificity than the default settings; however, the ability to further subtyping diminished. This is likely to be attributed to the limited representation/availability of strain types within NCBI's RefSeq database. In consequence, this leads to a more accurate estimation of the common ancestor for particular viruses, but limited typing results in case of highly variable ones. To obtain optimal typing results, additional annotated sequences may be added or a new database should be built, with a high variety of well-defined and frequently updated virus strain types.",
