Another possible, and more direct, bacterial effect would be influencing the expression of parasite's genes involved in oxidative stress management and by doing so stimulating its intrinsic ability to cope with an intoxicating environment.

            "text": "So far, only very few relevant studies are available, but molecular data point towards an intricate relationship between H. meleagridis and bacteria. On the basis of proteomic analyses of H. meleagridis, it seems that the presence of the parasite itself substantially influences the expression pattern of genes of cocultivated bacteria [9, 10, 14] . Due to the monoxenic nature of the H. meleagridis in vitro culture, the detection of a few E. coli proteins was anticipated. However, a substantial variation of their abundance, which could be associated with the parasite's phenotype, is remarkable and thought-provoking. Especially the exoproteome study demonstrated substantial changes in the expression of E. coli proteins. Considering that about one-third of bacterial proteins undertake their function outside the cytoplasm, it seems unsurprising that major differences in the exoproteome were of E. coli origin, whereas variations in protozoal exoproteins were almost nonexistent [9, 15] . Analysis of detected divergence in E. coli exoproteins suggests that, during cultivation, E. coli relies on the consumption of bioproducts from the parasite's metabolism, indicating a mutual role as nutrient supply [9] . However, the data also reveal a potential resilience of prokaryotes to predation by the parasite. Whether bacteria themselves acquire some advantage from this tight interaction remains hypothetical and needs to be investigated in more detail. The obvious hypotheses are (i) the protection from external agents or conditions, (ii) the nutrient supply and/or (iii) the use of H. meleagridis as a Trojan horse for prokaryotes. Some evidence for the last hypothesis comes from animal experiments and case reports of histomonosis from the field, which often find a secondary E. coli infection [3] .",

This 'eu-prokaryotic' interaction can have fatal consequences for the host, altogether a unique alliance in medicine. However, the underlying functional mechanisms are still to be resolved, considering that the host itself may trigger and contribute certain features inducing substantial consequences on the outcome. On the basis of available data, we hypothesise that the parasitebacteria interplay is mutualistic and not of a predator-prey nature. Future research should focus on resolving the unknowns of this interaction in order to elaborate whether a targeted manipulation of the gut microbiome can be achieved in order to minimise clinical consequences. Similarly, such knowledge could also be used to optimise the infection of attenuated H. meleagridis strains used for vaccination. 1 Spatial lifecourse epidemiology aims to utilize advanced spatial, location-aware, and artificial intelligence technologies to investigate long-term effects of measurable biological, environmental, behavioral, and psychosocial factors on individual risk for chronic diseases. It could also further the research on infectious disease dynamics, risks, and consequences across the life course.",

However, each of those components is dynamic: the environment is changing, such as daily weather variation and climate change that may affect the agent and the opportunity for exposure; the agent is evolving during its life and interacting with other agents in changing environments; and the host is also dynamic, influencing the individual's exposure, susceptibility, and response to the pathogen and environment. Also, the vector is moving around and interacting with different agents in varying environments. Thus, most if not all biological, social, and psychological pathways, as well as their combined processes (e.g., bio-social, socio-biological, and psycho-social), are to different extents influenced by spatiotemporally varying environmental factors. Investigating how those components may meet in respective dynamic processes could increase our capacity of monitoring and forecasting the outbreaks and health impacts of infections.",

In particular, the hysteresis effect of the weather factors should be considered [4] . Socioeconomic factors, such as population density, human movement, urbanization, economic development, and communication technology development, are also connected to the transmission of infectious diseases. For instance, modern transportations have accelerated the spread of dengue and mosquito vectors across the world over the last six decades; human movement and urbanization have increased the frequency of communication among individuals and thus the risk for HIV transmission [5] . In addition, environmental amenities could facilitate the formation of behaviors, such as outdoor physical activities, which could increase the contact between people, motivating the outbreak of human-to-human transmission of diseases.",

Some infectious diseases are more likely to happen in specific age and/or gender groups. For example, the hand-foot-mouth disease more likely attacks children under 10 years [6] . Furthermore, a compromised immune status resulting from poor nutritional status in infancy may directly lead to an increased risk for infections in childhood, adolescence, and adulthood, as well as potentially elevated morbidity and mortality rates at each stage of life, especially in late adulthood. Additionally, long-term health impacts after infection may exist across the life course and across regions, such as the birth defects of children who are exposed to maternal Zika virus infection in America [7] . Infectious diseases caught in early childhood can also lead to malnutrition (e.g., stunting and overweight), which The totality of all internal (e.g., having certain chronic diseases) and external (e.g., built and food environments in residential neighborhoods) exposures at all places and over the life course, termed as exposome, is a useful target to measure in not only chronic disease studies (i.e., cumulative exposure for doseresponse estimation) [8, 9] , but also in infectious disease research. For instance, intensity of exposures to pulmonary TB, measured as individual contact time with the TB index case, has been positively associated with the increased risk for TB infection and diseases among household contacts [10] .",

            "text": "Modeling the spatio-temporal trend of infectious diseases is an important issue because an accurate prediction of outbreaks can serve for early preparedness and responses. Lifecourse analyses for infectious diseases from macro to micro levels are helpful to improve the accuracy of the dynamic transmission model, as they provide additional information for simulation of the progression of infectious diseases. Some dynamic models from a lifecourse perspective have been developed, such as climate-driven dynamic models, agedependent dynamic models, and human mobility-based models [5, 14] . Propagation dynamics models could be used to predict the changes of infectious populations during an epidemic, which divide a population into different groups, such as susceptible population, infected population, and recovery population [15] . Different groups of the population are interchanged by a proportion within a Trends in Parasitology period. Two directions of improvements may be considered from a spatial lifecourse perspective. One is that a susceptible population could be estimated more accurately, according to the distribution of the population and corresponding infectious factors. The other is related to the adjustment of model parameters, such as transmission rate and recovery rate.",

Several approaches were summarized to quantify human mobility at different spatial and temporal scales, including long-term international and within-country migration census, flight and commuting networks, cell-phone data, and logging devices (e.g., GPS). Although long-term time series of these data are still challenging, they are becoming increasingly available from different novel and open data sources. Those approaches and data sources could also be used for designing new or supplementing existing spatial lifecourse epidemiologic studies [2, 8] .",
