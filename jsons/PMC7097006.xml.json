            "text": "Coronaviruses cause respiratory and intestinal infections in animals and humans1. They were not considered to be highly pathogenic to humans until the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2002 and 2003 in Guangdong province, China2\u20135, as the coronaviruses that circulated before that time in humans mostly caused mild infections in immunocompetent people. Ten years after SARS, another highly pathogenic coronavirus, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) emerged in Middle Eastern countries6. SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) uses angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as a receptor and primarily infects ciliated bronchial epithelial cells and type II pneumocytes7,8, whereas MERS-CoV uses dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4; also known as CD26) as a receptor and infects unciliated bronchial epithelial cells and type II pneumocytes9\u201311. SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV were transmitted directly to humans from market civets and dromedary camels, respectively12\u201314, and both viruses are thought to have originated in bats15\u201321. Extensive studies of these two important coronaviruses have not only led to a better understanding of coronavirus biology but have also been driving coronavirus discovery in bats globally21\u201331. In this Review, we focus on the origin and evolution of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. Specifically, we emphasize the ecological distribution, genetic diversity, interspecies transmission and potential for pathogenesis of SARS-related coronaviruses (SARSr-CoVs) and MERS-related coronaviruses (MERSr-CoVs) found in bats, as this information can help prepare countermeasures against future spillover and pathogenic infections in humans with novel coronaviruses.",

            "text": "Coronaviruses are members of the subfamily Coronavirinae in the family Coronaviridae and the order Nidovirales (International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses). This subfamily consists of four genera \u2014 Alphacoronavirus, Betacoronavirus, Gammacoronavirus and Deltacoronavirus \u2014 on the basis of their phylogenetic relationships and genomic structures (Fig. 1). The alphacoronaviruses and betacoronaviruses infect only mammals. The gammacoronaviruses and deltacoronaviruses infect birds, but some of them can also infect mammals24. Alphacoronaviruses and betacoronaviruses usually cause respiratory illness in humans and gastroenteritis in animals. The two highly pathogenic viruses, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, cause severe respiratory syndrome in humans, and the other four human coronaviruses (HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43 and HKU1) induce only mild upper respiratory diseases in immunocompetent hosts, although some of them can cause severe infections in infants, young children and elderly individuals1,28,29. Alphacoronaviruses and betacoronaviruses can pose a heavy disease burden on livestock; these viruses include porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus32, porcine enteric diarrhoea virus (PEDV)33 and the recently emerged swine acute diarrhoea syndrome coronavirus (SADS-CoV)34. On the basis of current sequence databases, all human coronaviruses have animal origins: SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E are considered to have originated in bats; HCoV-OC43 and HKU1 likely originated from rodents28,29. Domestic animals may have important roles as intermediate hosts that enable virus transmission from natural hosts to humans. In addition, domestic animals themselves can suffer disease caused by bat-borne or closely related coronaviruses: genomic sequences highly similar to PEDV were detected in bats35\u201338, and SADS-CoV is a recent spillover from bats to pigs34 (Fig. 2). Currently, 7 of 11 ICTV-assigned Alphacoronavirus species and 4 of 9 Betacoronavirus species were identified only in bats (Fig. 3). Thus, bats are likely the major natural reservoirs of alphacoronaviruses and betacoronaviruses24.",

            "text": "At the beginning of the SARS epidemic, almost all early index patients had animal exposure before developing disease. After the causative agent of SARS was identified, SARS-CoV and/or anti-SARS-CoV antibodies were found in masked palm civets (Paguma larvata) and animal handlers in a market place12,16,39\u201342. However, later, wide-reaching investigations of farmed and wild-caught civets revealed that the SARS-CoV strains found in market civets were transmitted to them by other animals16,39. In 2005, two teams independently reported the discovery of novel coronaviruses related to human SARS-CoV, which were named SARS-CoV-related viruses or SARS-like coronaviruses, in horseshoe bats (genus Rhinolophus)15,43. These discoveries suggested that bats may be the natural hosts for SARS-CoV and that civets were only intermediate hosts. Subsequently, many coronaviruses phylogenetically related to SARS-CoV (SARSr-CoVs) were discovered in bats from different provinces in China and also from European, African and Southeast Asian countries15,20,38,43\u201354 (Fig. 4; Supplementary Fig. S1a). According to the ICTV criteria, only the strains found in Rhinolophus bats in European countries, Southeast Asian countries and China are SARSr-CoV variants. Those from Hipposideros bats in Africa are less closely related to SARS-CoV and should be classified as a new coronavirus species54. These data indicate that SARSr-CoVs have wide geographical spread and might have been prevalent in bats for a very long time. A 5-year longitudinal study revealed the coexistence of highly diverse SARSr-CoVs in bat populations in one cave of Yunnan province, China18,20,55. This location is a diversity hot spot, and the SARSr-CoVs in this location contain all the genetic diversity found in other locations of China. Furthermore, the viral strains that exist in this one location contain all genetic elements that are needed to form SARS-CoV (Fig. 5). As no direct progenitor of SARS-CoV was found in bat populations despite 15 years of searching and as RNA recombination is frequent within coronaviruses56, it is highly likely that SARS-CoV newly emerged through recombination of bat SARSr-CoVs in this or other yet-to-be-identified bat caves. This hypothesis is consistent with previous data showing that a direct progenitor of SARS-CoV emerged before 2002 (refs42,57,58). Recombination analysis also strongly supported the hypothesis that the civet SARS-CoV strain SZ3 arose through recombination of two existing bat strains, WIV16 and Rf4092 (ref.20). Furthermore, WIV16, the closest relative to SARS-CoV found in bats, likely arose through recombination of two other prevalent bat SARSr-CoV strains20. The most frequent recombination breakpoints are within the S gene, which encodes the spike (S) protein that contains the receptor-binding domain (RBD), and upstream of orf8, which encodes an accessory protein20,58,59. Given the prevalence and great genetic diversity of bat SARSr-CoVs, their close coexistence and the frequent recombination of the coronaviruses, it is expected that novel variants will emerge in the future60,61. Because there were no SARS cases in Yunnan province during the SARS outbreak, we hypothesize that the direct progenitor of SARS-CoV was produced by recombination within bats and then transmitted to farmed civets or another mammal, which then transmitted the virus to civets by faecal\u2013oral transmission. When the virus-infected civets were transported to Guangdong market, the virus spread in market civets and acquired further mutations before spillover to humans.",

On the basis of SARS spread, the SARS 2002\u20132003 outbreak could be divided into three phases, with the early phase characterized by a limited number of localized cases, followed by a middle phase during which a superspreader event occurred in a hospital and finally the late phase of international spread62. The viral genomes from early-phase patients contain two genotypes of orf8, one with a complete orf8 (369 nucleotides) and the other containing an 82-nucleotide deletion. By contrast, viral genomes from late-phase patients and most of the genomes from middle-phase patients contain a split orf8 (orf8a and orf8b) owing to a 29-nucleotide deletion; two exceptions were found in middle-phase genomes, one containing an 82-nucleotide deletion in orf8 and the other with the whole orf8 deleted. The human isolates from 2004 and all civet SARS-CoV genomes have a complete orf8 except one civet strain with an 82-nucleotide deletion62. These data indicate that orf8 genes underwent adaptations during transmission from animals to humans during the SARS epidemic. A limited functional analysis suggested that the ORF8a protein is dispensable for SARS-CoV replication in Vero E6 cells but may have a role in modulating endoplasmic reticulum stress, inducing apoptosis and inhibiting interferon responses in host cells20,65\u201369. Whether and how these adaptations were involved in SARS-CoV virulence are not fully clarified.",

Residue 479 is an asparagine in strains hTor02, hcGd03 and hHae08 but is a lysine in strain cSz02 and an arginine in strain cHb05 (Table 1). Asn479 is located near hot spot 31, without interfering with the structure of hot spot 31 (ref.85) (Fig. 6b, c). However, a change to Lys479 leads to steric and electrostatic interference with hot spot 31, reducing the binding affinity between the SARS-CoV RBD and human ACE2. By contrast, Arg479 reaches the vicinity of hot spot 353 and forms a salt bridge with ACE2 residue Asp38 (ref.83) (Fig. 6d). Hence, strains hTor02, hcGd03 and hHae08 (all of which contain Asn479) and strain cHb05 (which contains Arg479) recognize human ACE2 and infect human cells efficiently, whereas strain cSz02 (which contains Lys479) recognizes human ACE2 inefficiently and infects human cells inefficiently. The above structural analyses are supported by biochemical, functional and epidemiological data42,76,78,83\u201385. Because of residue differences between human ACE2 and civet ACE2, both Asn479 and Lys479 fit well into the interface between the RBD and civet ACE2, although Arg479 fits even better83,85; consequently, strains hTor02, cSz02, hcGd03 and cHb05 (which contain either Asn479, Lys479 or Arg479) recognize civet ACE2 and infect civet cells efficiently79. In sum, Asn479 and Arg479 are viral adaptations to human ACE2, whereas Lys479 is incompatible with human ACE2; Arg479 is a viral adaptation to civet ACE2, whereas Asn479 and Lys479 are also compatible with civet ACE2.",

Detailed structural, biochemical and functional analyses showed that Phe442, Phe472 and Asp480 are viral adaptations to human ACE2, whereas Tyr442, Leu472 or Pro472, and Gly480 are viral adaptations to civet ACE2 (refs72,83). To corroborate the importance of these residues for SARS-CoV binding to either human or civet ACE2, two SARS-CoV S proteins, hOptimize and cOptimize, were rationally designed: the former contains all of the human ACE2-adapted residues (Phe442, Phe472, Asn479, Asp480 and Thr487), whereas the latter contains the civet ACE2-adapted residues (Tyr442, Pro472, Arg479, Gly480 and Thr487). These two S proteins demonstrate exceptionally high affinity for human ACE2 and civet ACE2, confirming that the human ACE2-adapted and civet ACE2-adapted RBM residues help determine SARS-CoV host range72,83. In addition to receptor binding, proteolytic cleavage of S and potentially other mutations that affect virion and trimer stability may also be important for virus transmissibility in different hosts, and these factors need to be studied further.",

            "text": "To date, numerous SARSr-CoV strains have been identified from bats15,16,18\u201320. These bat SARSr-CoVs are the likely progenitors of SARS-CoV that infected humans and civets, and hence understanding their interactions with human or civet ACE2 is critical for tracing the origins of SARS-CoV and for preventing and controlling future SARS-CoV outbreaks in humans. The RBD sequences of these bat SARSr-CoVs fall into three major groups; the representative strains from each group are bHKU3 (isolated in 2005), bWIV1 (isolated in 2013) and bRsSHC014 (isolated in 2013) (Table 1). Strains bWIV1 and bRsSHC014, but not strain bHKU3, use both human and civet ACE2 and hence can infect both human and civet cells16,18\u201320,86,87. Strain bHKU3 has a truncated RBM (Table 1), which distorts the structure of the RBM and abolishes its binding to human and civet ACE2. Neither strain bWIV1 nor strain bRsSHC014 contains truncations in its RBM, and hence, their RBMs likely retain the same structure as SARS-CoV RBMs. Here, we analysed the potential interactions between these two strains (bWIV1 and bRsSHC014) and human ACE2 by building homology structural models of their RBDs complexed with human ACE2, focusing on residues 479 and 487 (Fig. 6c, d). Strain bWIV1 contains Asn479 and Asn487 in its RBM. Whereas Asn479 is a viral adaptation to human ACE2, the polar side chain of Asn487 may have unfavourable interactions with the aliphatic portion of residue Lys353 in human ACE2, which is part of hot spot 353 (Fig. 6c). Strain bRsSHC014 contains Arg479 and Ala487 in its RBM. Whereas Arg479 is a viral adaptation to human ACE2, the small side chain of Ala487 does not provide support to the structure of hot spot 353 (Fig. 6d). Therefore, although both bWIV1 and bRsSHC014 can infect human airway cells, they bind human ACE2 less well than hTor02 and produce less severe symptoms than the epidemic strain of SARS-CoV in vivo88,89. Similarly, both bWIV1 and bRsSHC014 can infect civet cells, but they bind civet ACE2 less well than cSz02. Thus, it is predicted that both strains will be attenuated compared with early-phase or late-phase human SARS epidemic viruses. Future evolution of bat SARSr-CoV strains bWIV1 and bRsSHC014 in crucial RBM residues may allow them to cross the species barriers between bats, civets and humans, posing potential health threats.",

The viruses in this lineage have identical genomic structures and are highly conserved in their polyproteins and most structural proteins, but their S proteins and accessory proteins are highly variable. MERSr-CoVs were found in at least 14 bat species from two bat families, Vespertilionidae and Nycteridae.

Overall, the genetic diversity within the L1 and L2 viral lineages is low, indicating that humans and camels have been infected by viruses from the same source within a short time period. The L1 viruses include human and camel MERS-CoVs mainly from the Middle East (the United Arab Emirates, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, Oman and Jordan) and two Asian countries (South Korea and Thailand) that had caused outbreaks in human populations. It is worth noting that the cases reported in South Korea and Thailand were related to those in the Middle East. The L2 viruses include camel MERS-CoVs from Africa (Nigeria, Burkina Faso and Ethiopia) and one Middle East country (Morocco); these viruses have not caused any human infection. Clearly, these two viral lineages share a common ancestor but have diverged in their potential to cause human infections. The MERSr-CoV strain Neoromicia/5038 (GenBank No. MF593268) isolated in South Africa was the closest relative to MERS-CoVs in the phylogenetic tree. Overall, all the MERSr-CoVs isolated from bats support the hypothesis that MERS-CoV originated from bats. However, given the phylogenetic gap between the bat MERSr-CoVs and human and camel MERS-CoVs, there should be other yet-to-be-identified viruses that are circulating in nature and directly contributed to the emergence of MERS-CoV in humans and camels. Hopefully, such viruses will be found in bats in the future.",

The major variations are located in S, ORF4b and ORF3, particularly in African camel MERS-CoVs94. Substitutions of a few amino acid residues were found in the S protein of some camel MERS-CoVs, but none of them was located in the RBD94,112. Neutralization assays indicated that camel sera that are positive for MERS-CoV can completely neutralize the human MERS-CoV strains, suggesting that MERS-CoVs isolated from humans and camels are antigenically similar to each other94. MERS-CoVs from both humans and camels contain variable ORF3 and ORF4 proteins with different lengths owing to either terminal truncations or internal deletions94. ORF4b is known to be an interferon antagonist113,114. MERS-CoV isolates from West African camels with a truncated ORF4b gene replicate less efficiently in human cell culture and are less pathogenic in human DPP4 transgenic mice94. Curiously, deletion of the orf4 gene in the human MERS-CoV strain EMC did not substantially reduce virus replication, although it induced a stronger interferon response94. Another study demonstrated that the deletion of orf3\u2013orf5 dramatically attenuated MERS-CoV virulence, primarily through increased host responses, including disrupted cellular processes, increased activation of the interferon pathway and robust inflammation115.",

DPP4 from humans, camels, horses and bats can function as a receptor for MERS-CoV, whereas DPP4 from mice, hamsters and ferrets cannot112,122\u2013125. Key residue differences between human DPP4 and the DPP4 from other species affect the species specificities of MERS-CoV. For example, two residues (288 and 330) in mouse DPP4 and five residues (291, 295, 336, 341 and 346) in hamster DPP4 are largely responsible for the incompatibility of mouse and hamster DPP4s with MERS-CoV112,123. Mutating these residues to the corresponding residues in human DPP4 makes mouse and hamster DPP4 functional receptors for MERS-CoV. On the other hand, MERS-CoV and MERSr-CoVs have been isolated from camels and bats, respectively. MERS-CoV strains isolated from humans and camels are highly similar to each other, and they both use human DPP4 efficiently112. MERSr-CoVs from bats in general share only ~60\u201370% sequence identity with MERS-CoV in the RBD, and only some of these bat viruses, including HKU4, recognize DPP4 as the receptor110,111,126. However, they bind DPP4 less efficiently than MERS-CoV. Mutating three residues in the HKU4 RBD (540, 547 and 558) substantially increased its affinity for human DPP4 (ref.127). Overall, as in the case of SARS-CoV, receptor recognition is a crucial determinant of the host range of MERS-CoV.",

A novel HKU2-related bat coronavirus, named SADS-CoV, was identified as the causative agent34,128,129. The SADS-CoV isolates from piglets of the four farms were almost identical and shared 95% identity with Rhinolophus bat coronavirus HKU2 (ref.130), indicating the bat origin of this pig virus. Immediately after the SADS outbreak, SADS-related CoVs (SADSr-CoVs) with 96\u201398% sequence identity to SADS-CoV were detected in 9.8% of anal swabs collected from different Rhinolophus species in Guangdong province during 2013\u20132016. Although genetically highly similar, bat SADSr-CoVs show high genetic diversity in the S gene, with 72\u201392% nucleotide and 80\u201398% amino acid identity to SADS-CoV. Receptor analysis indicated that none of the known coronavirus receptors, ACE2, DPP4 and aminopeptidase N, are essential for SADS-CoV entry34. The mechanism of transmission of SADS-CoV from bats to pigs and the pathogenesis of bat-originated SADSr-CoVs in pigs need further exploration. This is the first documented spillover of a bat coronavirus that caused severe diseases in domestic animals, although molecular evolution data suggested PEDV probably originated in bats37,38.",

After several independent spillovers to humans, some of the strains underwent further mutations in S and became epidemic during the SARS outbreak in 2002\u20132003.

The 5'-terminal two-thirds of the genome encodes a polyprotein, pp1ab, which is further cleaved into 16 non-structural proteins that are involved in genome transcription and replication. The 3' terminus encodes structural proteins, including envelope glycoproteins spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M) and nucleocapsid (N). In addition to the genes encoding structural proteins, there are accessory genes that are species-specific and dispensable for virus replication. Here, we compare prototypical and representative strains of four coronavirus genera: feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV), Rhinolophus bat coronavirus HKU2, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) strains GD02 and SZ3 from humans infected during the early phase of the SARS epidemic and from civets, respectively, SARS-CoV strain hTor02 from humans infected during the middle and late phases of the SARS epidemic, bat SARS-related coronavirus (SARSr-CoV) strain WIV1, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) and bulbul coronavirus HKU11.",

SARS-CoV GD02 and hTor02 represent strains that were isolated from patients during the early, and middle or late phase of the SARS epidemic in 2002\u20132003, respectively; SARS-CoV CZ3 is a representative of strains isolated from civets in 2003 and 2004 (refs42,62). All bat SARSr-CoVs, except HKU3 and Rp3, were discovered in Yunnan province during 2011\u20132015. On the basis of deletions in the RBD, bat SARSr-CoVs can be divided into two clades. Those without a deletion and thus an identical size in S1 to SARS-CoV can be further divided into four genotypes: genotype 1, represented by WIV16, is highly similar to SARS-CoV in both the NTD and the RBD; genotype 2, represented by WIV1, differs in NTD from SARS-CoV; genotype 3, represented by Rs4231, differs in RBD from SARS-CoV; and genotype 4, represented by SHC014 and Rs4084, differs in both NTD and RBD from SARS-CoV20. The differences in S influence species-specific receptor binding, whereas differences in the accessory proteins, including potentially the newly discovered ORFX (X), mainly affect immune responses and viral immune evasion.
