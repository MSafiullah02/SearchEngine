Methods: A total of 34 patients were divided into two groups, including those who required noninvasive ventilation (NIV) and invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) with additional extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) in 11 patients. Clinical features of COVID-19 patients were described and the parameters of clinical characteristics between the two groups were compared. Results: The rates of the acute cardiac and kidney complications were higher in IMV cases than those in NIV cases. Most patients had lymphocytopenia on admission, with lymphocyte levels dropping progressively on the following days, and the more severe lymphopenia developed in the IMV group. In both groups, T lymphocyte counts were below typical lower limit norms compared to B lymphocytes. On admission, both groups had higher than expected amounts of plasma interleukin-6 (IL-6), which over time declined more in NIV patients. The prothrombin time was increased and the levels of platelet, hemoglobin, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), D-dimer, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and IL-6 were higher in IMV cases compared with NIV cases during hospitalization. Conclusions: Data showed that the rates of complications, dynamics of lymphocytopenia, and changes in levels of platelet, hemoglobin, BUN, D-dimer, LDH and IL-6, and prothrombin time in these ICU patients were significantly different between IMV and NIV cases.",

COVID-19 was the third lethal illness caused by a coronavirus, surpassed only by severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) (WHO, 2020) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) (WHO, 2019) . About one third of COVID-19 inpatients were admitted to intensive care units (ICUs) in Wuhan, China (Huang et al., 2020) and doctors are recognizing that a critical ingredient in managing the impacts of the disease is effective treatment of severe and critical patients. Recent data (NHC, 2020b) showed that COVID-19 fatality rates in Hubei Province and outside of the province were significantly different, prompting researchers to seek more information about the characteristics and treatments of COVID-19 patients in ICUs. Deeper analyses of related data may help in developing more effective treatment protocols for future severe patients.",

At admission to the hospital, 60% of the patients in our study already had lymphocytopenia and other patients in the study developed the condition as the disease progressed. In the IMV group, those with more severe illness, lymphocyte levels dropped progressively, and more severe lymphopenia occurred compared to the NIV group, suggesting that the severity of lymphocytopenia reflects the severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Research of SARS-CoV suggests that patients with more severe clinical illness and those who died had significantly more profound lymphopenia (He et al., 2005) . In our cohort, the lymphocyte counts in patients gradually rose as they recovered and were normal at time of discharge in the NIV group. These results differ from those of patients with SARS-CoV, in which lymphopenia was prolonged and lymphocyte levels did not return toward normal until patients were ill for five weeks (He et al., 2005) . Our findings also differ from those of patients with H1N1 influenza A infection whose lymphocyte levels did not return to normal until 2-3 weeks after the disease onset (Cheng et al., 2019) . Further analysis in our cohort showed that T lymphocytopenia was more pronounced than B lymphocytopenia, which was similar to previous study in SARS patients (Cui et al., 2003) . The mechanism behind these dynamics is not clear and calls for further study and confirmation in cell and animal experiments.",

Increased levels of anti-inflammatory cytokine, IL-10, in plasma were found in SARS-CoV-2-infected patients with IMV, which differed from SARS-CoV infection (Wong et al., 2003) but was supported by Huang et al. (2020) in patients with the same disease. BUN is a key element reflecting the intricate interrelation between nutritional status, protein metabolism, and renal situation of the patient (Arihan et al., 2018) . BUN was significantly elevated in IMV patients compared with NIV cases, which may be caused by high catabolism. The characteristics of inflammation and metabolism suggested that we have to be on the alert of the existence of persistent inflammation-immunosuppression and catabolism syndrome (PICS) in COVID-19 patients with prolonged mechanical ventilation. PICS, often leading to secondary infections and viral reactivation in the critically ill, has been associated with increased morbidity and mortality (Limaye et al., 2008; Kalil and Florescu, 2009; Libert et al., 2015) .",

First, we had limited samples from our cohort to analyze and in places outside Hubei Province, and the total number of cases and the number of critical patients were relatively small, also limiting available samples to study. A previous report enrolled 52 critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection from Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital (Yang et al., 2020) . Second, at the time of this writing, 13 IMV patients had not been discharged, so we cannot use survival or death as a clinical end point. The case mortality rate and other outcome indicators need to be reported later.",
