They belong to the family Coronaviridae, thename of which is derived from the Latin corona meaning crown or halo-like appearance, a characteristic feature of these viruses. Coronaviruses are enveloped, non-segmented, RNA virus.[1] Six species are known to cause human disease-229E, OC43, NL63, and HKU1 which cause common cold; severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV); and the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Coronaviruses are zoonotic viruses causing respiratory, enteric and neurological diseases including humans. In humans, the disease spectrum varies from the common cold to more severe diseases such as MERS and SARS.[23]",

It is also advised to cough into the bend of the elbow.A distance of at least 1 m (3 feet) should be maintained between individuals and those having coughing, sneezing, and fever. Crowded places and mass gatherings should be avoided.Regular screening for fever should be instituted and employees who have mild respiratory symptoms are advised to stay at home. Any experience of fever, cough, and breathing difficulty especially if the employee has traveled to any of the countries reporting COVID-19 cases or had close contact with a confirmed/suspected case of COVID-19 within 28 days should be reported immediately to the health facility.WHO does not recommend the use of facemask by healthy people. Facemasks are recommended for people who show symptoms of COVID-19 to help prevent the spread of the virus to others. Using facemask is crucial for health workers and people who are taking care of a suspected or a confirmed case in close settings (at home or in a health care facility). If a mask is worn, a medical mask is to be used, ensuring that it fits well and that there are no gaps between the mask and the face. Masks should be discarded in a closed bin when it is damp, followed by hand hygiene. Individuals should avoid touching the nose, mouth, and eyes when the mask is on.Environmental hygiene should be maintained especially in common areas used by employees like restrooms and canteens. Regular cleaning and disinfection of frequently touched objects and surfaces using regular disinfectants is necessary. Windows and doors should be kept open for cross-ventilation.In case employees are traveling out on work they should be advised to be cautious and avoid visiting live animal markets, wet markets, or animal product markets. Consumption of raw or undercooked animal products should be avoided. Personal hygiene should be maintained at all times.",
