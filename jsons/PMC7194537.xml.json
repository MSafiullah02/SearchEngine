            "text": "The potential for transmission of the 2019 novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) through ocular fluid is a concern for ophthalmologists. In this issue, Jun et al,1 (https://www.aaojournal.org/article/S0161-6420(20)30311-0/fulltext) from the National Health Care Group Eye Institute in Singapore, report that they were unable to detect SARS-CoV-2 in the tears of 17 patients diagnosed with COVID-19. They conclude the risk of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 through tears likely is low. Although the results are reassuring, risks to ophthalmologists remain because a few caveats must be considered. None of the study participants had conjunctivitis on presentation. One patient sampled developed conjunctival injection and chemosis on day 17 of hospitalization. In addition, most of the samples were obtained during the second and third weeks of symptoms, when viral load is known to have decreased precipitously.2\n,\n3 In a separate study that evaluated conjunctival swabs of 30 patients with COVID-19 pneumonia in China, only 1 patient demonstrated conjunctivitis, and those swabs showed positive results for SARS-CoV-2 by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction analysis.4 Of note, those conjunctival samples were collected early in the disease course. Finally, the diagnostic sensitivity for ocular samples such as tears and conjunctival swabs generally is lower than for other tissue types, given the limited sample volume. Therefore, negative results may reflect insufficient tissue sampling. Regardless, the viral load in noninflamed ocular tissues likely is low, and it is unclear if the viral RNA fragments detected by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction analysis represent viable viral particles capable of infection.",

Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 within the healthcare environment occurs.6\n,\n7 Viral loads of SARS-CoV-2 are high in the nose and throat of asymptomatic and symptomatic patients.2 Notable is the higher viral load in the nasal cavity than that of the throat, suggesting the high potential for transmission in the setting of close face-to-face contacts, such as slit-lamp examinations and other diagnostic ophthalmic imaging methods. Furthermore, SARS-CoV-2 remains viable in aerosols for at least 3 hours.8 Therefore, avoidance of talking during slit-lamp examination and minimizing time spent in close proximity to patients is important.",
