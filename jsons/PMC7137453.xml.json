Acute lung injury in experimental models may be induced by several methods (Table 1). These include intravenous, intratracheal or intraperitoneal administration of bacteria or endotoxin, induction of injury by the ventilator (ventilator-induced lung injury), chemical agents (oleic acid, hydrochloric acid), trauma, shock (for example hemorrhagic or induced by sepsis), or remote organ injury (for example pancreatitis, ischemia-reperfusion).

            "text": "Our review is timely since there is an increasing amount of research dedicated to the identification of ARDS subphenotypes, their underlying mechanisms, and their potential responsive treats [4, 7, 9\u201312, 48\u201352]. The results from this study should therefore be useful in order to generate hypotheses on whether some therapies (see Table 2) might differentially benefit to some preclinical subphenotypes, as compared to others. In case of positive results, this might open new perspectives on preclinical precision therapies, with the ultimate goal of future clinical translation. However, the predefined, limited number of therapies investigated through our review (see Table 2) is a limitation that should be acknowledged; this limited number reflects both our specific research topics of interest and a balance between scientific validity and feasibility. Our results will inform on whether the nature of the lung injurious hit used in published experimental models of ARDS could identify subphenotypes with distinct degrees of severity and treatment effects. Yet, we might not be able to distinguish such subphenotypes using individual subject data analysis in a given experimental model, such as recently reported in a secondary analysis of a murine cecal ligation and puncture sepsis model, with one subphenotype characterized by faster deterioration and more severe inflammation than the other and distinct responses to some interventions (immediate versus delayed antibiotics and fluids) [53].",
