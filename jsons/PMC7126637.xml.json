From a macroeconomic point of view, the property sector is an aspect of paramount importance of the holistic performance of economy. In fact, over the past few decades the real estate industry has been a target of government fiscal and monetary policies aimed at achieving balanced economic growth, low inflation, and low unemployment. However, policy makers seem to have no way in restraining bubbles in real estate markets; indeed, their adherence to orthodox policies (e.g. easy monetary policy or low interest rates to avoid recession) may be making the problems worse [1].",

The rise is usually followed by a reversal of expectations and a sharp decline in price often resulting in financial crisis\u201d. In other words, bubble is a huge rise in prices followed by a crash. Speculative bubbles have the special characteristics that they are persistent, systematic and exhibit increasing deviations of prices from their fundamental values [3].",

After the peak in 1991, land prices fell by more than 90% while stock prices slumped badly by 80%, which led to much lower economic growth ratio and a sharp rise in unemployment in the following decades. In August 1997 the Asian Tigers suffered a similar crisis, after asset price bubbles collapsed. While the trigger was the collapse of the currency, it was the massive rise and subsequent fall of property and stock prices that made the aftermath so painful [1]. Most recently, the Subprime Mortgage Crisis that began in August 2007 lies at the center of recent turmoil in housing and credit markets. A number of studies have examined the Subprime Mortgage Crisis and its tremendous effect to the real economy (see Refs. [4], [5] for a survey).",

Debate on house price bubbles mostly focuses on charts of house prices to income or rent ratios, or mortgage payment to income ratios (see Refs. [15], [16], [17] for examples), because it seems reasonable to cite the currently low level of the rent\u2013price ratio as a sign that we are in a housing price bubble. However, Meen [18] argues that there is no stable relationship between house prices and rents or between house prices and income. The main reason is that the discount factor of future rents or income is not stable over time. Therefore, evaluations of house prices have to consider a discount factor as well.",

Basically the specification of these methods is developed to compare the volatility between the assumed fundamental housing price and the actual housing price. If the volatility of the actual housing price is significantly larger than that of the assumed fundamental housing price, the test will claim that housing price bubbles are being detected indirectly. However, Marsh and Merton [25] provide a striking example which provides evidence that variance bounds test fails when dividends and stock prices are non-stationary (see also Ref. [26]).

Kim and Lee [27] employ the cointegration test to examine the existence of real estate price bubbles in Korea. More recently, Hui and Shen [14] incorporate econometrical methodologies into a Reduced Form Equations structure to study housing price bubbles in Shanghai and Beijing. Taipalus [17] develops a rolling sub-sample Augmented Dickey Fuller (ADF) indicator to test log rent\u2013price ratio for the existence of real estate bubbles for Finland, USA, UK, Spain and Germany, and the results suggest bubbles exist in nearly all of these countries. However, these direct tests can only provide necessary, but not sufficient, evidence of bubbles existing because rejecting the no-bubble hypothesis is not the same as detecting a bubble. As Gurkaynak [24] argues, econometric detection of asset price bubbles cannot be achieved with a satisfactory degree of certainty despite recent advances, especially when dealing with small sample econometrics problems.",

However this definition is generally thought to be not very practical, because it is very difficult to definitively identify a bubble until after the fact\u2014that is, when it is bursting we confirm its existence (see Ref. [29]). Zhou and Sornette [30] give a mathematical description of the end of the bubbles as the spontaneous singularity assuming that a crash follows after rapid growth of economic indicators faster than an exponential function. Although their method is practically useful for prediction of the end of a bubble, it says nothing about the start of a bubble. There is little mathematical definition or criterion formula to identify the start of the bubble period. Recently, Watanabe et al. [31], [32] introduce a mathematical definition of bubbles and crashes by exponential behaviors detected in the systematic data analysis. Their mathematical model could identify the whole period of a bubble or a crash determined purely from past data, and the start of a bubble can be identified even before its burst. However, there are still some limitations in practice. Firstly, they fix the optimal time scale Ti for observing the exponential behaviors to be constant, e.g. 100 days. Secondly, the coarse-graining scale of data \u0394t needs to be very small, like 30 s around in order to derive reasonable results. Unfortunately, we can just get monthly or daily data in some certain markets (e.g. real estate markets) due to the limitation of data frequency. Therefore, we will improve this model in this paper so that it can be used in the real estate market reasonably.",

We could see most of property securities markets in different countries experience bubbles during 2003 to 2007 (see Fig. 3\nfor comparison). Among these countries, the USA property securities market which is the world\u2019s largest, most mature and transparent securitized real estate market suffers the longest period of bubbles, from around Jan 2003 to Mar 2007 approximately. European largest property market, the United Kingdom market and one of the Asian Tigers Singapore market experience the similar bubble epidemic as the USA. In contrast, the results of Hong Kong seems different to some extent, as the trend and fluctuation of index is much more moderate between Mar 2004 and Sep 2005 (the test result is convergence), when the real estate market of Hong Kong was hit by the SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) Crisis. Furthermore, Japan, another major world economy country, still has not recovered from the episode of Land Crisis in the 1990s.",
