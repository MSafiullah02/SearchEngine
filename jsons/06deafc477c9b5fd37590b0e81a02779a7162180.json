            "text": "Dear Editor, Over the last 10 weeks the COVID-19 epidemic has exceeded 10 to 32 times the total number of confirmed SARS and MERS cases respectively. This has forced several countries around the world to establish extraordinary plans in terms of Public Health in order to prevent global expansion, including logistic design and guidelines with high security standards to repatriate citizens residing in China [1, 2] . We believe that the information published daily in scientific documents as in gray material from government entities may be extremely valuable for estimating the pooled proportion of suspected asymptomatic carriers for COVID-19 (PAC-COVID-19). It is also possible to determine the number of PAC-COVID-19 during a repatriation plan by adjusting to the current R0 in Wuhan, to estimate the frequency of returnees in whom the infection could possibly spread, in context of a positive symptomatic returnee for COVID-19. Therefore, herein we did so including the building of an online calculator to estimate the presumptive asymptomatic COVID-19 carriers.",

For the majority of these, faulty data included: incomplete monitoring during quarantine and absence of definitive RT-PCR confirmatory results. Most government-source publications did not report on the number of PAC-COVID-19 even after ending the quarantine period (data not shown). Five manuscripts presented data on how to calculate the proportion of PAC-COVID-19 amongst repatriated citizens, four described repatriations to Japan and one to Germany. Three manuscripts included gray material and two scientific publications. Confirmations of COVID-19 by RT-PCR was included in 13 of 14 publications; with the caveat that for the publication \"Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia Emergency Response Epidemiology Team\" which included 72,314 cases, only 38.2% of such cases included clinical but not RT-PCR confirmation, due to insufficient capacity to perform laboratory tests on all possible events.",

To date, 16 countries distributed across five continents have implemented at least one repatriation operation [4] . Those carried out by air frequently include flight itineraries including several stopovers and variable travel times, a combination that can increase exposure between healthy travelers and symptomatic or asymptomatic PAC-COVID-19 infected travelers, amplifying the number of contacts [4] .",

In any case, given the latent risk of in-flight transport and transmission there is an increasing need for mathematical modeling tools to aid in the understanding complex epidemiological systems such as this. The natural course of COVID-19 and the worldwide spread of the epidemic through travelers stresses the need for useful methodological tools to estimate an expected number of asymptomatic carriers potentially propagating COVID-19. In addition, early detection will allow timely public health decisions placing travel restrictions, or the set up of specific monitoring requirements to asses risk and protect the population at risk or other biosafety measures at airports, transport terminals and other points of mass entry of migrants.",

Nevertheless, the ongoing epidemic which has already spread beyond mainland China to other countries exhibiting different environmental, political and sociodemographic characteristics, will significantly affect the different R0s used. Thus, adjustments will be required when assessing individually affected countries.
