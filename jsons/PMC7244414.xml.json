            "text": "During the past several years, there have been conferences/symposiums for bovine respiratory disease (BRD) and research with several presentations on various aspects of BRD, including clinical disease, diagnosis, etiology, epidemiology, government and commercial diagnostic laboratories, treatment, prevention, economics of disease and prevention, and immunity. Participants included clinicians in private practice; university and government researchers; diagnostic laboratories; animal health firms; cattle owners including feedlots, beef cow calf operations, dairies for milk production, and dairy calf ranches for heifer replacements and dairy calves entering feedlots. A review published in 2009 summarized BRD research from 1983 (the initial BRD symposium) to 2009.1 This review covered infectious agents, including viruses, bacteria, and mycoplasmas. Coverage of viruses included the 4 most commonly discussed respiratory tract viruses in BRD: bovine herpes virus 1 (BoHV1), bovine parainfluenza type 3 virus (PI3V), bovine viral diarrhea viruses (BVDVs), and bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV). There are commercial vaccines containing immunogens to these viruses. These 4 viruses were investigated extensively prior to 2009 in research studies and were described in published reports from state and federal diagnostic laboratories. These viruses were identified by the virologic methods in place at that time.2 These included isolation in cell culture based on cytopathology and confirmed by fluorescent antibody test using virus monospecific antisera. Other confirmatory tests included neutralization of infectivity using monospecific antisera. Numerous serosurveys permitted detection of viral exposure in selected populations. In the years prior to 2009, selected viruses such as BVDV were sequenced, resulting in the knowledge of genomic regions that could be used to identify these viruses. Eventually, technology produced many automated sequencing procedures and the field of bioinformatics facilitated alignment of newly identified sequences with reference sequences, permitting the identification of the entire or near full length of viral genomes. Terms, such as metagenomics, whole-genome sequencing, and next-generation sequencing, have become commonplace for both research and diagnostic laboratories. These new genomic tests permitted expansion of knowledge of the big 4 viruses: BoHV1, BVDV, PI3V, and BRSV.",

            "text": "The BoHV1 represents one of the original viruses in BRD that was isolated and characterized in the 1950s with the advent of cell cultures. BoHV1 is a common component of bovine viral vaccines, including both modified live virus (MLV) vaccine and killed/inactivated viral vaccine. The MLV vaccine origin strains of BoHV1 have been identified in clinical cases postvaccination and in aborted fetuses. Thus, it became necessary to differentiate field strains from the MLV strains, but this posed significant challenges. Using whole-genome sequencing and analysis of the resulting nucleic segments, the viral genomes of BoHV1 reference strains, BoHV1.1 reference strains Cooper and Los Angeles, were sequenced.3\n,\n4 The resulting information on the BoHV1.1 genome was investigated further using the reference strain, Cooper, and multiple BoHV1.1 strains in the MLV vaccines available in North America.5 This genetic analysis found single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) among the viruses, which permitted the viruses to be classified into groups. The SNPs for various regions permitted the selection of multiple primers to be used and the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) products sequenced. These SNPs patterns then permitted the ability to separate the viruses into groups and each strain to have a specific identity. This information permitted isolates from clinic cases to be categorized as field/wild-type or MLV strain. Use of the SNPs and the sequencing of the PCR products of the primers were applied in multiple studies identifying wild-type strains of BoHV1.1 as vaccine or wild-type strains.5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 In addition to the separation of vaccine from field strains, these genomic sequencing procedures identified a recombinant BoHV1.1 strain (including components of both a wild-type and a vaccine strain) from an aborted bovine fetus.10 Using this genetic sequencing, the BoHV1.2b reference strain K22 and multiple wild-type genital and respiratory BoHV1.2b strains were sequenced.11\n",

Studies of the distribution of these 3 subtypes from diagnostic laboratory accessions indicated BVDV1b as the predominant BVDV subtype,14 and BVDV1b was the predominant subtype in multiple studies of beef calves with BRD, based on recovery of virus from acute cases of BRD and necropsy tissues.15 Investigation of the source of BVDV exposure identified the persistently infected calf as the most imported source of virus exposure, with persistently infected calves resulting from infection of susceptible heifers/cows during a critical stage of pregnancy.12\n",

Although initially studied as a pathogen causing neonatal diarrhea/enteritis in young calves, growing evidence has suggested involvement in BRD, especially because of the recovery of BoCV from clinically ill cattle with BRD and necropsy cases of fatal pneumonias. The use of viral serology and more extensive use of PCR testing on respiratory tract swabs from BRD cases and necropsy cases by diagnostic laboratories have provided further evidence that BoCV plays a role in BRD. Interpretation of these diagnostic reports, however, often is difficult, especially because there is no US Department of Agriculture licensed BoCV vaccine for BRD prevention and control. A recent article by Ellis24 gives an excellent review of the history of BoCV in respiratory cases, both in field cases and in experimental studies.

            "text": "A study using nasal swabs from calves treated for BRD and BRD necropsy cases from multiple feedlots identified viruses with PCR testing and virus isolation.9 Of the 121 cases, the positives include: 14.9% (BoHV1), 15.7% (BVDV), 62.8% (BoCV), 9.1% (BRSV), and 8.3% (PI3V). In contrast to prior studies, the virus positives were tested by sequencing to differentiate vaccine strains from field strains. Often surveys collect samples from cattle recently vaccinated with MLV vaccines containing BoHV1, BVDV, PI3V, and BRSV. In a study of virus recovery from fatal cases in Ontario, Canada, feedlots, BoCV was recovered from 2/99 (2.0%) cases.25 A subsequent report in 2009 dealt with a year-long study of pathology and identification of infectious agents in fatal feedlot pneumonias.26 In that study, which used PCR testing of fresh lung samples, 21/194 (10.8%) were positive for BoCV. The BoCV has been isolated from both healthy calves and sick calves.27, 28, 29, 30 Using a virus neutralization serotest, however, individual calf serums collected at feedlot entry in a retained ownership study (fresh from the ranch and no mixed-source auction calves) were tested for neutralizing antibodies, and those calves with low antibody levels to BoCV (16 or less) were more likely to be treated for BRD during the feeding phase compared with calves with higher titers.27 In other research, BoCV from nasal swabs and bronchoalveolar washing fluids were evaluated for genetic and antigenic differences.28 A region of the viral spike protein in the envelope was the target of genomic sequencing, and virus neutralization tests in cell culture were used to compare antigenic relatedness. Testing demonstrated genetic differences that allowed classification of 2 clades, BoCV1 and BoCV2, which also demonstrated antigenic differences. The current reference BoCV is of enteric origin and is classified as BoCV1. This strain is included in most licensed BoCV vaccines for enteric disease in the United States. Another study of 15 isolates from 3 herds, using sequencing of the spike hypervariable gene region, indicated that there were 4 polymorphisms in the 15 isolates.30\n",

            "text": "A critical question posed for BoCV as a respiratory pathogen has been whether BoCV infection with isolates of respiratory tract origin (as opposed to the reference enteric strain or other enteric strains) in susceptible cattle results in measurable gross and microscopic lesions on the respiratory tract. Such challenge studies are required in order to have a model to measure efficacy of BoCV vaccines in the respiratory tract protection. A series of studies was performed with multiple isolates from the respiratory tract of calves and the reference enteric strain to study dynamics of the BoCV infection.31 BVDV exposure was used in dual infections (BVDV and BoCV) as well as BVDV alone, BoCV alone, and controls.31 Respiratory disease was observed in calves inoculated with BoCV 6 days or 9 days after BVDV. Lung lesions were present in calves in dual infection groups; however, lesions were more pronounced in calves inoculated with BVDV followed by BoCV inoculation 6 days later. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) confirmed the presence of BoCV antigen in the respiratory tract. Gross lung lesions of the dual infected calves were multifocal and randomly distributed throughout the lungs in most cases. Histologically, lung lesions consisted of interstitial to bronchointerstitial pneumonia (BIP), with inflammatory changes ranging from mononuclear infiltrates to fibrin and neutrophils in more severely affected lungs. Similarly, less severe changes could be seen in several of the BVDV or BoCV inoculated calves. In this study, BoCV antigen was found via IHC in bronchial and tracheal epithelium, alveolar interstitium, and macrophages, whereas BVDV antigen was not detected by IHC. This study confirms the potential for BoCV isolates from the respiratory tract to cause clinical disease detected by gross and microscopic lesions, in particular, with a sequential dual infection with BVDV. In addition, IHC detected the present of BoCV antigen in multiple respiratory tract sites. This study indicates that sequential dual infections may have potential as models for vaccine and therapy development and efficacy studies.",

Viruses from these PCR positives were isolated from cell cultures and confirmed to be influenza virus by hemagglutination and PCR. The viral genomes were sequenced and found different from the influenza C viruses. Using serotesting, these bovine isolates also were found antigenically different from the influenza C viruses.

Another question posed for IDV in cattle is whether a vaccine might provide protection in vaccinated and challenged cattle. A subsequent report found that an inactivated IDV vaccine using an isolate from cattle provided partial protection in vaccinated calves compared with controls, and the challenge virus caused inflammation in the nasal turbinates and trachea but not appreciably in the lungs.42 These results give evidence for the role of IDV of cattle in BRD and that partial protection may result from an inactivated vaccine.",

There were 8 samples (18%) positive for the influenza C virus, representing samples from Minnesota and Oklahoma. Five of the positives were isolated in cell culture and were tested further by PCR and hemagglutination assays. Four positives were from 1 herd in Minnesota and 2 were chosen for further study, C/bovine/Minnesota/628/2013 and C/bovine/Minnesota/729/2013, and 1 remaining isolate was from a case in Oklahoma, C/bovine/Oklahoma/660/2013. Eventually these viruses were placed into a new group based on genomic and antigenic differences from influenza C virus group, leading to designation of a new genus (D) in the viral family Orthomyxoviridae. Seroprevalence of IDV in bovine populations was examined with hemagglutination inhibition (HI) with the C/swine/Oklahoma/1334/2011 (C/OK) virus and C/bovine/660/2013 (C/660) as antigen and bovine sera from 8 herds in 5 different states tested individually.

There were 90.8% of the samples from beef cattle and 9.2% from dairy cattle. Formalin-fixed tissues were processed for histologic examination and fresh tissues frozen until further testing. Cases were classified as suppurative bronchopneumonia (SBP), fibrinous bronchopneumonia (BP), interstitial pneumonia, BP + BIP, and bronchiolitis. The metagenomics identification was performed on fresh lung tissues. From 34 samples with metagenomics sequencing results, an RT-PCR test with primers for BVDV, PI3V, BRSV, BoHV1, and BoCV was used in all cases of these viruses detected. In 4 cases, however, a virus was detected by RT-PCR that was not detected by metagenomics sequencing. The recovery of viruses was low, with only 36.9% (48/130) positive. There were 16 viruses identified. The bovine parvovirus 2 was the most prevalent virus, 11.5%, followed by ungulate tetraparvovirus 1 and BRSV, both 8.3%. The BRD viruses\u2014BRSV, 8.5%, and BVDV1 and BVDV2, 2.3%, and 3.8%, respectively\u2014and PI3V, 2.3%, were found infrequently. None of these viruses was associated with a particular pneumonia. Animal viruses were identified in only 1 animal each: bovine rhinitis B, IDV, fowl aviadenovirus, avian adenovirus\u2013associated virus, and bovine polyomavirus. The most prevalent virus in each type of pneumonia was bovine parvovirus 2, at 5.9% in FDP; bovine astrovirus, at 3.1% in SBP; BRSV, at 1.5% in interstitial pneumonia; and ungulate tetraparvovirus 1 in BP and BIP, at 1.5%. However, for every type of pneumonia, samples in which no virus was detected, this was the most common result compared to the percentage virus recovery in each pneumonia category. None of these viruses detected were significantly associated with any type of pulmonary pathology. This virus detection in lung tissue provides low analytic sensitivity relative to ante mortem sampling of the upper respiratory tract for virus surveillance.39 In this study, however, the bacterial agents Histophilus somni, Mannheimia haemolytica, and Pasteurella multocida were found to have strong associations with SBP, fibrinous BP, and BP and BIP, respectively.39 These results were in contrast to a prior western Canadian study using swabs from the upper respiratory tract (nasal and tracheal) of beef cattle where IDV, bovine rhinitis B, BRSV, and BoCV were significantly associated with BRD.37 A potential explanation for these divergent findings is that the lungs of the fatal cases may have cleared the viruses and the bacterial pathogens remained predominant.",

Diagnostic laboratories are now using PCR testing based on primers learned from sequencing. In selected instances, such as IDV and BoCV, serosurveys have demonstrated the widespread presence of these viruses in North American cattle. In limited studies, these viruses, such as IDV and BoCV, have caused disease in animal studies. In various studies, some of these viruses, but not all, have been found in BRD cases more frequently than in healthy cattle. It is important that reagents be developed by diagnostic laboratories to use in diagnostic testing for the new viruses. The pathogenicity of these new viruses should be determined in controlled challenge studies. Vaccine development and evaluation in controlled studies for these viruses should be considered to determine if vaccinations have a role in their control.",
