            "text": "Adult-onset Still\u2019s disease (AOSD) is a rare, idiopathic, systemic, autoinflammatory disorder. Patients can present with the \u201cStill\u2019s triad\u201d, arthritis, evanescent salmon-colored rash, and quotidian or double quotidian fevers, although atypical cases abound. Described as early as 1896 by George Still in children and further characterized in 1971 by Eric Bywaters who an adult onset of symptoms, \u201cStill\u2019s disease\u201d has come to define a disease spectrum with systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis (SJIA) at one end and AOSD at the other, based on age of symptom onset [1]. Clinical manifestations may include hepatosplenomegaly, lymphadenopathy, serositis, and aseptic meningitis. Severe disease complications include endocarditis, myocarditis, and pericarditis, coagulation abnormalities, and, especially, macrophage activation syndrome (MAS). The precise etiology of AOSD remains unclear; however, activation of the innate immunity via an unknown trigger has been described as the key inciting factor. Establishing the diagnosis of AOSD is often difficult due to the protean nature of the disease; the presence of non-specific symptoms, especially in the early phases of the disease; and the absence of characteristic serological diagnostic markers. Importantly, albeit inconsistent, laboratory findings include neutrophil-predominant leukocytosis, negative rheumatoid factor (RF), and antinuclear antibodies (ANA) as well as frequently elevated serum ferritin levels with a low-glycosylated fraction [2].",

AOSD is rare, and hence there are currently no consensus on its incidence and prevalence in different populations. Based on larger reviews from the 1980s, it appears that AOSD occurs worldwide and may affect slightly more women than men. This disease characteristically affects younger people between the age of 16 and 35 years of age [5, 6]. A bimodal peak at ages 15\u201325 and 36\u201346 without a sex bias has been described in a retrospective study of 62 patients from western France [7]. However, an epidemiological survey from Japan described that 67% of the cases presented after the age of 35, the majority (65\u201370%) being women [8]. AOSD affects all ages, and stress has been suggested as an important risk factor for all ages [9]. No familial trend has been reported in the recent literature; however, an association with certain HLA alleles has been observed in certain populations. These HLA subtypes include HLA DR4, B17, B18, B35, DR2, DR5, and DQ1.",

In a small study of 25 AOSD patients, HLA-Bw35 was associated with disease susceptibility conferring a favorable prognosis [12]. Wouters et al. noted an increased frequency of the HLA-DR4 allele in 29 patients with AOSD compared to normal controls, with the presence of HLA-DRw6 being linked to root joint involvement [13]. An association between a chronic articular form of AOSD and HLA-DRB1*1501 (DR2), DRB1*1201 (DR5), and DQB1*0602 (DQ1) was previously reported, while HLA-DQB1*0602 (DQ1) have been also associated with the systemic form of the disease in Japanese population [14]. Statistics from a Korean report supported an association between HLA-DRB1*12 and DRB1*15 and AOSD, while HLA-DRB1*04 seemed to be protective. Conversely, HLA-DRB1*14 alleles were more frequently present in patients with the monocyclic systemic type of AOSD [15].",

Calprotectin (calcium-binding protein) secreted by neutrophils and macrophages and macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) have been found to be useful markers of disease activity [13]. Intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM-1) upregulated by IL-18 has been implicated as a useful clinical marker whose expression typically reflects the level of disease activity.

A predominance of Th1 subset of cytokines has been seen in peripheral blood and tissues of active untreated AOSD patients. Th1 immune cascade is characterized by elevated secretion of interferon \u03b3 (IFN\u03b3), interleukin-2 (IL-2), and tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 (TNF\u03b1) cytokines that direct B cells toward IgG2a production, activate macrophages and natural killer (NK) cells, and promote cell-mediated immunity [10]. When compared with controls, serum levels of IL6, TNF\u03b1, and IFN\u03b3 were significantly increased in 12 patients with active AOSD [16]. IL18 is a pro-inflammatory cytokine that is overproduced in the acute phase of AOSD and is believed to be the cytokine initiating the inflammatory cascade that includes IFN\u03b3, IL6, and TNF\u03b1 [17]. Genetic polymorphisms of the human IL18 gene have been described to confer disease susceptibility in a Japanese study [18]. Conversely, in another Japanese study, serum levels of soluble IL2 receptors, IL4, and IL18 correlated with chronic articular AOSD activity, whereas IFN\u03b3 and IL8 levels were found to be persistently raised, even in disease remission.",

These disorders are associated with recurrent bouts of inflammation without an instigating antigenic stimulus. Defective interleukin-1 processing, regulation of nuclear factor-B transcription factor, and possible uncharacteristic apoptosis are all anticipated mechanisms that may possibly play a role in the generation and perseverance of an inflammatory cascade. Patients with autoinflammatory syndromes, in particular, the typical hereditary periodic fever syndromes, may share certain genetic traits; MEFV gene mutation associated with familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) and IL-1 hypersecretion was seen with augmented frequency in Turkish children with SJIA. Mutation of perforin and the MUNC13\u20134 genes have been seen in patients with macrophage activation syndrome (MAS), a known severe, life-threatening complication of AOSD [3]. Mutations in genes encoding the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor and pyrin superfamilies of molecules may result in the endurance of leukocytes that would customarily go through apoptosis [3].

Complement deposits (C3) have been described with immunofluorescence. Arthralgias and myalgias are common manifestations of AOSD. Most commonly involved joints include the wrists, ankles, knees, elbows, proximal interphalangeal joints, and shoulders. These manifestations can evolve into more severe and potentially destructive polyarthritis that can mimic other systemic inflammatory arthritides, such as rheumatoid arthritis [20]. Myalgia can be debilitating and often associated with fever spikes. The muscle involvement, when severe, may be accompanied by an elevation of serum creatinine kinase and aldolase concentrations. However, muscle biopsy and electromyographic (EMG) studies are typically normal. Sterile pharyngitis manifesting as throat pain can occasionally precede the development of fever or rash by weeks, or even months, as a prodromal symptom and can often reoccur with disease relapses.",

Uncommonly, some patients may develop severe interstitial lung disease and some progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Enlarged, symmetrical, cervical nodes are seen in about one half of patients with AOSD. Lymphadenopathy is often accompanied by fever, leukocytosis creating diagnostic confusion with lymphoma.

            "text": "\nMacrophage activation syndrome (MAS) or reactive hemophagocytic syndrome (RHS) is a life-threatening complication of AOSD. Mortality rate ranges between 10% and 22% [22\u201325], and an incidence of 12\u201314% has been noted in two recent series, a rate higher than other rheumatic diseases [26, 27]. It is categorized by an uncontrollable activation of the reticuloendothelial system within the bone marrow, reticuloendothelial system, and central nervous system, with successive phagocytosis of hematopoietic cells by tissue macrophages (histiocytes) [25, 28]. Patients developing MAS present with acute high fever, lymphadenopathy, and hepatosplenomegaly. Laboratory findings include pancytopenia, elevated ferritin levels, triglycerides, and liver enzymes, often accompanied by normal erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR). The most commonly implicated triggers include infections, medications, and disease flares [29\u201331]. Patients with MAS have a decreased ability to eliminate antigen stimulation, thereby inducing T cell activation and proliferation resulting in cytokine secretion (interferon-gamma and granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor) and macrophage hyperactivation. The end result is an uncontrollable increase in cytokines, specifically TNF\u03b1, interleukin-1, and interleukin-6 production resulting in severe systemic inflammatory reaction, i.e., \u201ccytokine storm\u201d [25]. There is also a suggestion that certain therapeutic agents, such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, methotrexate, sulfasalazine, penicillamine, and lately TNF-\u03b1, IL-1, and IL-6 inhibitors may be capable of provoking MAS, often complicating their therapeutic use [27]. In theory, these therapies may create a state of immunodeficiency resulting in the reactivation of latent viruses (Epstein-Barr virus or Cytomegalovirus) which in turn can stimulate MAS. The counter-argument would be that anti-inflammatory medications may not be able to prevent the development of MAS, at least in the dosages used in AOSD or SJIA.",

Hemophagocytosis, seen in bone marrow aspiration and biopsy, establishes the diagnosis, even though hemophagocytosis could be seen more frequently in biopsies from the liver, spleen, and/or lymph nodes. Bone marrow aspiration is considered the gold standard and is usually required in atypical cases, causing a diagnostic dilemma.

Conditions such as infections, neoplasms, and autoimmune disorders should be ruled out before the diagnosis of AOSD can be confidently made. Viral syndromes (e.g., rubella, cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, mumps, Coxsackievirus, adenovirus) can be excluded if the symptoms persist for more than 3 months and serologies are negative. Neoplastic disorders that can mimic AOSD include leukemia and lymphoma, such as angioimmunoblastic lymphoma. However, the clinical presentation can differ substantially, with atypical rashes and/or isolated lymph node enlargement. At times bone marrow and/or lymph node biopsy may be needed to differentiate these entities. Common mimickers of AOSD include reactive arthritis and the other spondyloarthropathies, hemophagocytic syndrome, dermatomyositis, Kikuchi\u2019s syndrome, Sweet\u2019s syndrome, granulomatous disorders, and the vasculitides. Other differentials of AOSD are the periodic fever syndromes and, in particular, familial Mediterranean fever, hyper IgD syndrome (HIDS), and TNF receptor-associated periodic syndrome (TRAPS). Patients with familial Mediterranean fever often present with acute, self-limited episodes of fever accompanied by signs of peritonitis, pleuritis, synovitis, and erysipelas-like erythema. The disease commonly starts in childhood or early adolescence. A significant family history, clinical presentation, and response to colchicine can aid in making the correct diagnosis. This can be verified, in many cases, with genetic analysis for the MEFV gene. TRAPS and HIDS commonly start in childhood and also have strong familial distributions. However, adult-onset cases of those rare syndromes do exist, and the genetic tests that are commercially available can be helpful in excluding them, especially when atypical presentations are present.",

Several retrospective case series and one open-labeled prospective randomized trial have evaluated the use of anakinra in AOSD patients [41, 42]. Anakinra is approved as a daily subcutaneous injection (100 mg) in RA. In AOSD, higher dose may be necessary, since anakinra has a very short half-life (4\u20136 h). While anakinra does not work in all AOSD cases, for the ones it does work, its onset of action is very rapid. In many cases, resolutions of systemic symptoms and normalization of inflammatory markers were reported within 2 weeks of anakinra use, allowing for rapid tapering of corticosteroids, if they were ever used in the first place. However, relapses are not uncommon with the cessation of these agents. In certain patients, gradual reduction in dose has enabled the weaning of anakinra. Daily anakinra injections are often complicated by frequent injection site reactions. If response to anakinra is incomplete or tolerability issues ensue, rilonacept and/or canakinumab can be considered. They have longer half-lives and can be administered at greater intervals, once or twice weekly for rilonacept and every 4\u20138 weeks for canakinumab, respectively. Additional supplemental data is available in the setting of SJIA. Swart and associates reviewed data pertaining to 140 children with SJIA treated with anakinra [43]. Systemic symptoms resolved in 98% of the patients, and fatigue and well-being improved in 93% of cases. Arthritis improved in 66% of the cases in time. Absolute disease remission was mostly detected in patients with systemic symptoms, less arthritis, and a shorter duration of disease. Similar findings were corroborated in a large, multicenter, randomized, placebo controlled trial by Quartier et al. [44]. Sample population included 24 patients with a systemic-onset JIA for duration of more than 6 months and steroid dependency. In 1 month, anakinra was effective in 8 out of 12 patients (versus one in the placebo group) who reached the modified American College of Rheumatology (ACR) Pediatric 30 score. After 2 months, majority of patients (9/10) who had been switched to anakinra were also responders. Nigrovic and associates studied 46 patients who received anakinra as first-line treatment. Rapid resolution of systemic symptoms was observed in about 95% of cases, along with a supplementary preventive effect on refractory arthritis in almost 90% of the patients. Based on these results, it was postulated that there could be a benefit for IL-1 blockade therapy in initial phase of the disease (i.e., within 6 months after onset) [45]. These findings were also further reinforced by Vaster et al. in 2014 [46]. In a prospective series of 20 patients who received anakinra as first-line therapy, 85% of the patients showed an American College of Rheumatology Pediatric 90 score response or had inactive disease within 3 months. Overall, 75% of the patients treated with anakinra achieved remission. These results clearly indicate that IL-1 blockade has an early place in the treatment strategy.",

Although complete resolution of symptoms has been observed, efficacy of the TNF-inhibitors has been mostly limited to Still\u2019s arthritis. Efficacy was better with the monoclonal antibodies, as compared to the soluble receptor, and switching from one agent to another had no additional effect [19].

Preferred NSAID is high-dose indomethacin (150\u2013200 mg/day). Corticosteroids should be started promptly once the diagnosis is confirmed. Usually, corticosteroid therapy starts at a dosage of 0.5\u20131 mg/kg/day. Pulse dose methylprednisolone is used if there is severe visceral involvement or there is suspicion of MAS complicating the clinical presentation. Higher dosages seem to be more efficient in controlling the disease and lessening the number of relapses. Tapering of corticosteroids can start after 4\u20136 weeks, when symptoms have resolved, and biological parameters have returned to baseline. Methotrexate (MTX) could be considered early for its steroid-sparing effect. Typically, methotrexate (7.5\u201320 mg/week) enables complete remission of the disease (70%) and limits frequent corticosteroid use. Blood count and renal and hepatic function should be monitored before initiation of methotrexate and then at monthly intervals. Alternative DMARDs may be use in the event of methotrexate failure; however, more recent literature suggests better results with targeted biologic treatment.",

In addition, these findings are also reinforced by molecular evidence, cytokine profiles, clinical course, and response to therapy. Predictors for a prominent articular pattern include female sex, proximal arthritis at disease onset, thrombocytosis, and corticosteroid dependency, whereas high fever, transaminitis, or elevated acute phase reactants are more likely to be connected with a systemic pattern of AOSD [14, 52]. Alternative evidence to identify the systemic subtype of AOSD are the following: thrombocytopenia, RHL, and hyperferritinemia. IL-18, interferon-\u03b3, IL-10, and IL-4 are typically associated with systemic AOSD, whereas IL-6, IL-17, and IL-23 are associated with arthritic AOSD [53]. This dichotomy aids in management as patients fall into one of the two categories and should benefit from different therapies.",

From traditional DMARDs, methotrexate has been studied the most and may continue to have a role as steroid-sparing and in the treatment of chronic articular disease. IL-1 antagonists should be considered first line in severe or refractory AOSD, either alone or in initial combination with systemic corticosteroids when necessary. Regularly reported side effects with anakinra include injection site reactions. Longer acting IL-1 inhibitors (rilonacept or canakinumab) may play a role in refractory disease or when tolerability issues exist with anakinra. Tocilizumab, the IL-6 receptor antagonist, has shown efficacy in both systemic and articular disease predominant AOSD, even in cases where IL-1 inhibition has been unsuccessful. In contrast to IL-1 and IL-6 inhibitors, anti-TNF-\u03b1 agents typically have less sustained effect on systemic symptoms, but they may have a limited role for the chronic inflammatory polyarthritis.",
