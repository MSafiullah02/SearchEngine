            "text": "Dengue virus (DENV) is transmitted to humans by infected Aedes mosquitoes in tropical and subtropical areas. It is a member of the Flavivirus genus of the Flaviviridae family. It is the enveloped icosahedral, positive-stranded RNA viruses. The approximately 11-kb genome is translated as a single polyprotein, which is cleaved into three structural proteins (capsid [C], premembrane/membrane [prM/M], and envelop [E]), and seven non-structural proteins (NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, and NS5) by host and viral protease [1]. They comprise four distinct serotypes, DENV1 through DENV4. This virus is the major cause of morbidity in tropical and subtropical regions, and have been estimated that there are 50\u2013100 millions of infected cases annually around the world. However, nowadays, there is neither proven vaccine nor specific anti-viral drug to all serotypes available. Infection with DENV can cause a spectrum of clinical symptoms ranging from flu-like illness, dengue fever (DF), to a severe fatal disease known as DHF or DSS. These fatal forms are often attributed to re-infection by heterologous serotypes [2]. Primary infection with any of the four serotypes can produce lifelong immunity to that serotype, but only temporary immunity to the others; moreover, the sequential infections in the presence of heterologous dengue antibodies often lead to a more severe secondary infection of DHF/DSS [3]. These is attributed to antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) when non-neutralizing antibodies form a complex with the virus and infect phagocytes via Fc receptors, causing more viral load and enhance infection involving DHF/DSS [3].",

            "text": "Other than epitope mapping studies for vaccine design, the genetic analysis of variable region sequences of anti-viral Abs have recently shown its potential for vaccine development. This germline characterization has recently been widely studied in several anti-viral MAb including HIV-1 virus [13], [14], Influenza virus [15], and SARS coronavirus, Hendra virus, and Nipah virus [16] using phage display and high-throughput sequencing. One study of anti-influenza antibodies have shown that mutation at only 7 amino acids in the Heavy chain Complementary Determining Region 2 (HCDR2) and Framework Region 3 (FR3) are evolved for the full activity of neutralization, which can be applied for the rational design of epitope-specific vaccine inducing broadly-neutralizing antibody [15]. For anti-DENV MAbs characterization, there is one study characterizing mouse MAb 4E11 that targeted to EDIII which has been raised against serotype 1 dengue virus, but can neutralize all 4 serotypes with different efficacy. It was found that mutation at only some hotspot can greatly affect the binding activity of that MAb [17]. However, germline study of anti-DENV HuMAbs is still limited. For this reason, further characterization of genetic sequences of our 19 hybridoma IgGs \u2013 all targeted to E, mostly targeted to EDII and show strong to moderate neutralizing activity \u2013 is needed. These should be a good model of antibody\u2019s genetic study that will enlighten dengue vaccine development through the induction of cross-neutralizing activity.",

They found that IGHV1\u201369 were the highest heavy chain germline gene used. Similar with the result from Chen et al. (2012a) who constructed 2 libraries from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from HIV-1 patients from different time point after infection, one from 40 days, and the other from 8 months post infection. It was found that germline gene usages of both HC and LC were different among two libraries. HV1\u201346, HC3\u201333, and HV5\u201351 were most frequently found from library constructed from 40 days post infection PBMCs. In contrast, HV1\u201369 (26%) was the most frequently used HC germline from library constructed from 8 months PBMCs. Comparing with our study, that all 19 IgGs were generated from acute patient PBMCs from secondary dengue infection, it can be suggested that after primary infection, this IGHV1\u201369, which is the high frequency heavy chain germline presence in IgM repertoires [16], should be the major group of germline heavy chain responsible for antibody production. After recovery, the human immune response can stay long in the human blood circulation. Once re-infection has occurred, the memory B cells were stimulated; therefore, high possibility of antibody production from this kind of germline heavy chain was observed.",

The alignment of HuMAbs HC from these 3 groups, along with their closest germline sequences, including their germline LC, as well as annotated FRs and CDRs are shown in Table 3\n.
