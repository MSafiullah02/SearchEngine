            "text": "Long-range RNA-RNA interactions (LRIs) have been marginally reported in various positive\nstrand RNA viruses like Tombusvirus (8 in Carnation Italian Ringspot Virus\n(CIRV) and Tomato Bushy Stunt Virus (TBSV)), Hepacivirus [5 in\nHepatitis C Virus (HCV)], Coronavirus (1 in Transmissible\nGastroenteritis Virus (TGEV)), Flavivirus (3 in Dengue Virus\n(DENV) and West Nile Virus (WNV)), Luteovirus (2 in Barley Yellow\nDwarf Virus (BYDV)), Apthovirus (2 in Foot-and-Mouth Disease\nVirus (FMDV)), Pestivirus (1 in Classical Swine Fever\nVirus (CSFV)) and Human Immunodeficiency Virus (5 in HIV-1)\n(Abbink and Berkhout, 2003; Andersen et al., 2004; Beerens and Kjems, 2010; Huthoff and Berkhout, 2001; Ooms et al., 2007). According to their definition, a long-range\ninteraction spans distances between a few hundred and several thousands of nucleotides\n(>26 kb in TGEV). LRIs are often located in loop regions or internal bulges of local RNA\nstructures (known as cis-acting regulatory elements) and therefore build pseudoknot-like\nstructures. Various programs have been developed for general RNA-RNA interaction prediction,\nwhich can be classified into five groups (Kato\net al., 2010; Seemann\net al., 2011): The first group neglects intramolecular\nbase-pairs, based on the hybrids minimum free energy (MFE). Members of this group are\nRNAduplex and RNAplex (Lorenz et\nal., 2011; Tafer and Hofacker,\n2008) or RNAhybrid (Rehmsmeier et\nal., 2004). The second category includes RNAcofold (Bernhart et al., 2006) and\nPairFold (Andronescu et al.,\n2005). These tools concatenate two interacting RNA sequences and calculate the MFE\nof the joint RNA sequences. The third group considers intramolecular and intermolecular\nRNA-RNA interactions in separated steps, however, only one binding site is predicted.\nMembers of this group are IntaRNA (Busch et\nal., 2008) or RNAup (M\u00fcckstein\net al., 2006). The fourth group considers more complex RNA-RNA\ninteractions and allows also more than one binding site. This group includes tools like\nRactIP (Kato et al., 2010),\ninteRNA (Alkan et al., 2006)\nor inRNAs (Salari et al.,\n2010). The final group contains e.g. PETcofold (Seemann et al., 2011), RNAaliduplex (Lorenz et al., 2011), IRBIS\n(Pervouchine, 2014), ripalign (Li et al., 2011) and simulfold\n(Meyer and Mikl\u00f3s, 2007). These tools\nconsider not only a pair of single sequences, like the tools mentioned earlier, they use\nmultiple sequence alignments as input. With this comparative method, it is possible to\nreduce the false-positive rate by incorporating evolutionary conserved information. All of\nthese programs have different properties, unsuitable for viral genomes. For example,\nRNAaliduplex is unable to predict pseudoknots and neglects intramolecular RNA foldings.\nPETcofold considers both, intra- and intermolecular interactions as well as pseudo-knots,\nbut returns per default only a single secondary structure, which makes the detection of\nmultiple functional binding sites impossible. Ripalign\u2019s running time makes the program not\napplicable to viral sequences and IRBIS is only applicable for predictions of RNA\ninteractions related to RNA splice sites. Up to now, we are aware of a single program that\nis designed for LRI prediction called CovaRNA (Bindewald and Shapiro, 2013). This tool detects long-range nucleotide covariation\nfrom multiple sequence alignments of eukaryotic genomes using an index-based algorithm to\nfind clusters of covarying base-pairs. The extended function CovStat determines the\nstatistical significance of observed covariation cluster. CovaRNA has very strict filter\ncriteria and is therefore very conservative in predicting LRIs. For short genomes, such as\nviral genomes, this leads to almost no predicted interactions.",

Although Flaviviruses and Hepacivirus are\nboth assigned to the family Flaviviridae, the LRI distribution is very\ndifferent. In Flaviviruses, we found some clearly separated peaks with an accumulation of\nLRIs, located at the 3\u2032 end of gene M and in the center of the NS3 and NS5 gene (Fig. 3A). Different from the HCV alignment, we did\nnot find an accumulation of LRIs in the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 UTR. This effect could be explained by\ndifferent sequence conservations of the UTRs. In HCV, the pairwise identity of the UTRs\nis > 95%, whereas the UTR pairwise identity of the Flaviviruses is < 50%. The\nFlavivirus alignment consists of only six sequences, including only the\nmosquito/vertebrate Flaviviruses. In Flavivirus, three experimentally verified LRIs are\nknown: 5\u2032\u20133\u2032-UAR, DAR and 5\u2032\u20133\u2032-CS (Alvarez\net al., 2005; Corver\net al., 2003; Friebe\nand Harris, 2010; Khromykh et\nal., 2001; You et\nal., 2001; Zhang et\nal., 2008). All known interactions are in close proximity and can\nbuild a genome circularization, essential for the viral replication. The strongest\ninteraction (CS) was ranked at fourth position (Fig.\n3B). It was not possible to identify the 5\u2032\u20133\u2032-UAR and DAR, because the seed\nregion does not appear to be conserved in the highly variable 5\u2032 UTR.",

The\nhuge amount of theoretically possible interactions makes it impossible to verify all\npossible interactions by wet lab experiments. LRIscan offers the opportunity to predict\npossible LRIs under certain criteria and reduces dramatically the number of candidates for\nwet lab studies. As shown in part A of Figures 2, 3, 5, and 6 also well\nstudied viruses provide a huge list of highly ranked LRIs, which could be involved in viral\ntranslation and transcription mechanisms. Further wet lab studies, which verify the\nfunctionality of these interactions, could improve our understanding of the viral\nreplication.",
