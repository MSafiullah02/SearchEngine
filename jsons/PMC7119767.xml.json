            "text": "Canine distemper virus (CDV) is a member of the genus Morbillivirus of the Paramyxoviridae and is related closely to the viruses responsible for measles, rinderpest, peste des petits ruminants, phocine distemper, dolphin distemper, porpoise distemper, and equine morbillivirus (Fenner, 1976, Haas and Barrett, 1996, Osterhaus et al., 1995). Canine distemper (CD) is a highly contagious disease that affects dogs of all ages. It is associated with high morbidity and mortality and occurs worldwide. Dogs that have been infected naturally with CD show commonly systemic signs of the disease such as vomiting, diarrhoea and/or respiratory signs; sometimes they also exhibit generalized or localized myoclonus and the characteristic clinical symptoms of CDV encephalomyelitis (Frisk et al., 1999, Moritz et al., 2000, Okita et al., 1997). In the recent outbreaks of CD in Korea, the affected dogs could be classified clinically into two groups, namely, young dogs with CNS signs associated with respiratory and/or gastrointestinal symptoms, and old dogs with CNS signs alone. Thus, the clinical signs of CD vary depending on the age and immune status of the host as well as the virulence of the virus strain and the environmental conditions (Greene and Appel, 1990). Acutely infected dogs shed the virus in all bodily secretions regardless of whether they are symptomatic or not. Although the virus cannot be isolated from the bodily secretions of dogs with subacute distemper encephalomyelitis and persistent viral infection of the CNS, they may still transmit the virus (Appel, 1987).",

Such an assay would also help to exclude other diagnoses and prevent the further transmission of the disease. At present, CD can be diagnosed by virus isolation, immunofluorescence assays (IFA), RT-PCR, and real-time PCR (Frisk et al., 1999, Hoyland et al., 2003, Jozwik and Frymus, 2005, Shin et al., 2004), all of which are relatively time-consuming and laborious techniques. The ImmunoComb antibody test kit (Biogal Galed Labs, Israel) for CD is also used frequently in animal hospitals to decide when to vaccinate a pet, as it reveals the anti-CDV IgM and IgG antibody levels. However, to use this test to determine whether a dog is infected with CDV, the animal has to be tested twice over several days. This delay in diagnosis is a serious limitation of this test.",

All three samples (nasal, conjunctival and blood) were obtained from each of 38 dogs at the time they presented at the animal hospital. Of the remaining dogs, 16 provided blood and either nasal irrigation fluids or conjunctival swab samples, and 12 provided only blood. The conjunctival swabs and nasal irrigation fluids were each mixed with 1 ml PBS (phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4) while blood lymphocytes were separated by using a LeucoSep\u2122 tube (Greiner, Cat. No. 163290, Austria). All of the samples were stored at \u221220 \u00b0C until use. The dogs suspected to have CD were Maltese dogs (n\n = 20), Yorkshire Terriers (n\n = 13), Shih Tzu (n\n = 13), Korea Jindo dogs (n\n = 6), Poodles (n\n = 5), American Cocker Spaniels (n\n = 4), Pugs (n\n = 3), and Miniature Schnauzers (n\n = 2). Most were young dogs who demonstrated mainly acute and systemic clinical signs. However, six dogs which were over 2 years of age showed nervous symptoms. The Choongang Vaccine Laboratory (Daedeok valley, Daejeon, Korea) kindly provided us with the Rockborn strain of CDV, canine coronavirus (CCV), canine parainfluenza viurs type 2 (CPIV-2) and rabies virus.",

Various techniques have been used for this, including virus isolation, IFA, RT-PCR, and real-time PCR (Frisk et al., 1999, Hoyland et al., 2003, Jozwik and Frymus, 2005, Shin et al., 2004). However, the direct IFA gives false negative results in the subacute or chronic form of the disease (Jozwik and Frymus, 2005), and the other methods tend to be labor- and time-consuming. The Biogal's ImmunoComb antibody test kit, which measures the anti-CDV IgM or IgG levels in the dog and is usually used to determine when to vaccinate, can be used as a subsidiary measure to deduce CD infection. However, with this method, the same dog has to be re-tested after several days to determine whether the antibody levels are increasing, which reflects an ongoing immune response and probable infection with CDV. This delay in diagnosis is a serious limitation of this method.",

A similar study using nested PCR that detected CDV NP RNA revealed that of 29 serum, 16 whole blood, and 16 cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples, 86%, 88%, and 88% were positive, respectively (Frisk et al., 1999, Moritz et al., 2000). In contrast, hospitalized dogs with neurological disturbances but lacking the typical findings of distemper were tested, RT-PCR analysis failed to detect CDV RNA in any of the serum samples while only 1/5 (20%) whole blood and 2/5 (40%) CSF samples were positive. However, 4/5 (80%) urine and all 5 (100%) CSF samples were positive (Amude et al., 2006). Another study used RT-PCR to compare the various bodily secretions for the early detection of CDV in experimentally infected dogs (Kim et al., 2006). The conjunctival swab was found to be the most suitable specimen for early diagnosis of CD, as CDV amplicons were detected in the conjunctival swabs from all seven dogs at days 3\u201314 post-infection (Kim et al., 2006).",

The six false negative samples, but neither of the false positive samples, induced pocks on the chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) 7 days after inoculation. These pocks were found by RT-PCR and nucleotide sequence analysis to contain CDV genes. Thus, the overall sensitivity and specificity of the IC assay were 9.2% and 2.2% lower than those of the nested PCR, respectively. It is possible that vaccination may lead to a false positive if testing occurs within a few days after vaccination. Indeed, one of the false positives results identified by the IC assay (which was then found to be a true negative) was a Korea Jindo dog that had been tested 4 days post-vaccination. Notably, of the other dogs that were tested shortly after vaccination (two Yorkshire Terriers and one Shih Tzu were tested 3, 5, and 3 days post-vaccination, respectively), all were true positives as determined by both the IC and nested RT-PCR assays. Hence, it was not clear whether these animals were really infected or whether both assays have detected the vaccine strain (Table 2).",

Due to these advantages, the IC assays detecting specific antibodies are available for other veterinary diseases, including CPV (Oh et al., 2006). An IC test for simultaneous detection of specific antibodies against Babesia caballi and Babesia equi in the horse has also been developed by using recombinant B. caballi 48 kDa rhoptry protein and recombinant truncated B. equi merozoite antigen 2 (Huang et al., 2006). However, the IC assays can be limited in terms of the amount of antigen they can detect, as large amounts of viral antigen are required to produce a clearly visible band. As a result, the interpretation of results may be affected by the subjectivity of the test operator. However, the IC assay developed for CDV is as good as nested RT-PCR when conjunctival swab samples are tested.",
