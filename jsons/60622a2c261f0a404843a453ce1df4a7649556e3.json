Drawing on our findings from these first two research questions, we (3) empirically model how the amount of public health benefit (reduction in infection rate), amount of individual benefit (true-positive detection of exposures to COVID), and degree of privacy risk in a hypothetical contact tracing app may influence Americans' willingness to install.

Unlike manual contact tracing, which an investigator reaches out directly to affected parties, the benefits of these apps for public health scale quadratically with participation [2] .

Understanding how rates of app failure may influence adoption allow us to estimate user response to potential app designs. For example, Saxena et. al. [16] have shown that using Bluetooth as a method for detecting proximity may be innately error prone, estimating an approximate error rate of 7-15% (including both false positive and false negative rates). Our results allow us to estimate user response to such error rates.",
