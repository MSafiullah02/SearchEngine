They increased in SARS whereas lymphocyte counts decreased [4], as our expression of cytokine dysregulation [5]. The elevated cytokines, together with lymphokines, lead to the adhesion of inflammatory cells to endothelium and other injury sites [6]. Several studies showed that impaired endothelium-dependent vasodilation is a prominent feature in patients with moderate renal impairment [7], and plasma cytokine levels could be useful in predicting mortality rates in critically ill patients with ARF.",

There are several Mallory body-like casts (arrowhead) in dilated lumens with some sloughed and flattened renal tubular epithelial cells, indicating rhabdomyolysis and acute tubular necrosis. Interstitial infiltration of mononuclear cells is evident. There was a mild increase in mesangial cellularity and matrix (HE, 200\u00d7). (d) The glomerulus of case 2 (electron microscopy).
