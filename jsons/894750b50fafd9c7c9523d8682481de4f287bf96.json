Initiative Statute.\" or \"The Safe Neighborhoods and Schools\" Act. The referendum, which was approved with 59.6% of the vote, went into effect the following day, November 5, 2014 (Ballotpedia 2014) . Prop. 47 imparted three broad changes to felony sentencing laws in the state of California: i) certain non-violent theft and drug possession offenses would be reclassified from felonies to misdemeanors; ii) those serving sentences for the reclassified offenses would be allowed to petition courts for re-sentencing; iii) those who had completed felony sentences now classified as misdemeanors would be able to petition courts to amend their criminal records. Felonies reclassified as misdemeanors under Prop. 47 include shoplifting, attempted shoplifting, grand theft auto, receiving stolen property, forgery, fraud, writing bad checks; each up to a maximum monetary value of 950 USD. Possession of most illegal drugs for personal use, including methamphetamine, heroin and cocaine, was also reclassified as a misdemeanor. The law allows for some exceptions, for instance reclassification may not apply if perpetrators have a criminal record including violence or sexual offenses.",

            "text": "Prop. 47 was part of a series of initiatives designed to lessen California's incarcerated population in response to allegations of inadequate inmate medical and mental health care, amounting to cruel and unusual punishment. In 2009, federal courts required the state to reduce prison overcrowding and set an occupancy threshold of 137.5% of design capacity to guarantee inmates' Eighth Amendment rights. On May 23, 2011 and upon appeal by the State of California, the US Supreme Court upheld this decision in Brown vs. Plata: California's prison population would have to decrease from approximately 156,000 to 110,000 individuals (Newman and Scott 2012) . To comply with federal orders, state lawmakers enacted significant legislative reforms over the years, including Prop. 47. Assembly Bill (AB) 109, also known as the Public Safety Realignment Bill, and Assembly Bill 117, also known as the Criminal Justice Realignment Bill, were approved and went into effect on October 1, 2011 (Owen and Mobley 2012) . These laws allowed those convicted of certain non-violent crimes to serve their sentences in county facilities, under house arrest, or in alternative sentencing schemes, rather than in state prisons. Overall, 500 criminal statutes were amended and penalties for parole violations were reduced. On November 6, 2012, voters also approved Prop. 36, which revised California's 1994 Three Strikes Law mandating a sentence of 25 years to life for those convicted of a third felony. Under Prop. 36, to be considered a strike, the third offense must be a serious or violent felony, or the perpetrator must have been previously convicted of murder, rape, or child molestation.",

One study found a 50% decline in the number of individuals being held or serving sentences for the reclassified crimes (Bird et al. 2016) . Prop. 47 also stipulated that any resulting monetary savings should be diverted to crime prevention programs targeting youth and recidivists. The Safe Neighborhoods and Schools Fund was specifically created to manage these savings, estimated to be between 150 and 250 million USD per year. To date, 65% of payments have been distributed to the Board of State and Community Correction, with the Department of Education and the Victim Compensation and Government Claims Board receiving minor percentages (Taylor 2016) . Reducing penalties for drug possession may have also lessened racial and ethnic disparities in the California criminal justice system (Mooney et al. 2018) .",

            "text": "While Prop. 47 helped reduce incarceration, determining its effects on the reclassified crime rates has proven more controversial. Several parties, including law enforcement officials, district attorneys, and mayors point to the law for rising crime (Lehner 2016; Casuso 2018; Egelko 2018; Weisberg 2019) . Some studies link moderate (Bartos and Kubrin 2018) or sustained Fischer 2018 ) crime increases to the enactment of Prop. 47, while other groups maintain that current data is inconclusive and that a longer term perspective is necessary (Males 2016) . Aside from the disputed effects of Prop. 47 on crime rates, it has also been claimed that the new law brought unintended consequences such as the elimination of DNA collection for the reclassified crimes, restrictions in arresting repeat offenders, declines in the reporting of crimes as victims learned that police would not be able to apprehend and punish perpetrators, and making habitual drug users less likely to seek treatment (Hanisee 2018) . A preliminary analysis conducted state-wide by the California Police Chiefs Association finds that the consequences of Prop. 47 are not homogeneous among cities of comparable size and that county specific factors, such as efficacy of monitoring and treatment programs, and how probation and/or incarceration are handled locally, may affect crime rates (Lehner 2016) . Judging the outcomes of Prop. 47 has led to a contentious debate within academic, political, and community settings, culminating in a growing movement to reverse some of its reforms through a proposed 2020 ballot initiative (Keep California Safe 2020). Public safety agencies, caught between opposite viewpoints on the overall positive or negative societal effects of Prop. 47, have often expressed the need to better understand its consequences to optimize operations and budgets, to improve procedures, and to share impartial findings with stakeholder groups (Hunter et al. 2017) .",

            "text": "The goal of this work is to investigate the impacts of Prop. 47 on crime rates in the coastal city of Santa Monica, California, population 91,411 (2019) . Located in Los Angeles County, the city is bordered by Los Angeles proper and the Pacific Ocean. Its downtown core has recently undergone intense revitalization, fueled by high-tech start-ups, increased tourism, and the 2016 opening of the Metro Expo Line light rail extension. The latter now connects the beach with nearby Culver City and inner Los Angeles neighborhoods through seven new stations of which four are located within municipal borders. The city has also experienced rising housing costs, the displacement of long-term tenants, and increasing levels of homelessness (Kamel 2012; Holland and Smith 2017) . In recent years both the Santa Monica Police Department (SMPD) and the local press have reported increases in crime, including robbery, burglary, aggravated assault, and homicide, with large numbers of repeat offenders (Sheriff's Department 2018; Cagle 2018; Catanzaro 2019; Pauker 2019c) . Dedicated social media accounts and resident neighborhood groups (Residocracy Santa Monica 2020; Santa Monica Now 2020; Santa Monica Crime Watch 2020; Santa Monica Problems 2020) have been awash with images, anecdotal evidence and speculations on the root cause of these trends. Passage of Prop. 47 is among the theories offered to explain the rise in crime; another is the opening of the Expo Line allowing for easier transportation to and from the city (Cervantes 2016; Neworth 2017; Harlander 2018) . After a change in leadership in May 2018, the SMPD launched a series of new public safety initiatives. These included hiring twenty new police officers, increasing patrolling and outreach efforts, establishing a dedicated unit to analyze crime trends, deploying nightly security guards, adding lighting and CCTV cameras to public garages, and even limiting the hours of operations of some businesses that attracted large amounts of crime Renaud (2019) . The SMPD also increased its engagement with people experiencing homelessness and former inmates, helping them connect to services. Among the newly established programs are the Neighborhood Resource Officers to facilitate community-oriented policing, the Homeless Liaison Program, to assist the unhoused, and the Downtown Business Services Unit to improve communication with business owners. These initiatives are reported to have mitigated crime in the city, especially those affecting quality of life Pauker (2019a,b) .",

Our data analysis is meant as a first step in quantifying long-term crime trends in Santa Monica, and as a way to go beyond casual information and/or personal opinion. Throughout our work, in every instance where we discuss changes to crime trends it is important to note that any increase or decrease we present applies only to the reported crimes listed by the SMPD. This qualifier is crucial, as inferring true crime trends would require perfect knowledge, and the SMPD data may not be an unbiased representative sample of the actual crimes committed.

A decrease in crime is observed towards the end of 2018 and persists through 2019, concurrent with the new police initiatives illustrated above. Longer term studies would be needed to determine whether this decrease will stabilize in the future. A geographical analysis reveals that overall the incidence of reclassified crimes after passage of Prop. 47 increases or stays constant in all but one of the eight Santa Monica neighborhoods, with significant rises in monthly counts in Downtown (+37.2%) and the North of Montana and Ocean Park neighborhoods (+13.2% and +12.0%, respectively).

The first two stations are marked by a larger number of crime attractors and foot traffic than the other two. Crime percent increases are similar for both reclassified (+30.6%) and non-reclassified (+34.6%) crimes at Downtown Santa Monica. At 17 th Street/Santa Monica College instead the percent increase of reclassified crimes (+38.6%) is much larger than that of non-reclassified crimes (+20.6%).

To better manage the information and perform statistical analyses on categories with a sufficient amount of data, we collapsed some original crime categories into coarser ones. For instance, we grouped \"aggravated assault with a firearm,\" \"general aggravated assault,\" \"aggravated assault with hands,\" \"aggravated assault with knife,\" and \"aggravated assault with other weapon,\" under the new general category \"assault.\" We also set a threshold of 450 counts per category, so that if this minimum number of crime occurrences was not met over the 2006-2019 period, the category was excluded from our analysis due to insufficient data. Among the crimes that did not meet the threshold were arson, embezzlement, blackmail and homicide. Misappropriation of property appears in the database only from 2010 onwards so we also discarded this category from our analysis. Finally, all incomplete or corrupted entries were discarded.",

We used ancillary information to determine which categories should fall under the Prop. 47 header, depending on their typical economic value. For example, the FBI's UCR Program for 2017 estimates the average value of property lost due to larceny to be roughly 1,007 USD per offense (Federal Bureau of Investigation 2017). In earlier years, the average value of losses due to larceny was lower, for example in 2006 it was 855 USD per offense, justifying its inclusion in the Prop. 47 reclassified list for all years. Larceny is here broadly defined as the unlawful taking of property such as motor vehicle parts and accessories or bicycles, shoplifting and pick-pocketing. Since the average street value of cocaine, heroin or methamphetamine doses for personal use is well below the 950 USD threshold, we also include possession of narcotics in the Prop. 47 reclassified list. The Federal Reserve estimates that for the year 2015 total fraud from bad checks, general-purpose transactions, and credit card accounts, resulted in 62 million single payments for a total of 8.3 billion USD, averaging Table 1 is usually under the 950 USD threshold imposed for reclassification purposes. We do not adjust crime counts for population change since the number of Santa Monica inhabitants has remained fairly stable in the thirteen year period under investigation. The city tallied approximately 87,000 residents in 2006, and after peaking at 93,000 in 2015, the population is currently estimated to be 91,411 (World Population Review 2018).",

Histograms for the four resulting subsets of data are shown in Fig. 4 . The before and after monthly crime distributions for Prop. 47 offenses are presented in the left-hand panel of Fig. 4 ; before and after distributions for non-Prop. 47 crimes are in the right-hand panel of Fig. 4 . As can be seen, the Prop. 47 crime distribution is shifted to the right after November 2014 with respect to the pre-implementation data. On the other hand, the post-November 2014, non-Prop. 47 crime distribution is shifted to the left. These histograms suggest that crimes affected by the reclassification process increased after passage of Prop. 47 whereas the incidence of crimes that were not subject to the new legislation decreased. To determine whether these shifts are statistically significant we use Welch's unequal variances t-test (Welch's t-test) to compare the before and after mean monthly count of reclassified crimes. This is a two-sample test typically employed to compare two mean values when the respective samples have unequal size or variance (Welch 1947) . In our specific case, data is available over eight years (106 months) before November 2014 and only over five years (62 months) after the same date, leading to very different sample sizes and variances. If the occurrence of Prop. 47 crimes listed in Table 1 were not affected by the reclassification process, we would expect the difference between crime counts before and after passage of the law as determined by Welch's t-test to be negligible. We denote by \u00b5 b and \u00b5 a the mean monthly number of Prop. 47 crimes before and after November 2014, respectively; \u03c3 b and \u03c3 a represent the associated standard deviations, and N b and N a the respective number of months over which these averages were calculated. The null hypothesis is formulated as there being no difference in the mean values, \u00b5 b = \u00b5 a , while the alternative hypothesis posits that Prop. 47 led to an increase in the reclassified offenses, \u00b5 b < \u00b5 a . Our data yields {\u00b5 b , \u03c3 b , N b } p47 = {281.4, 33.2, 106} and {\u00b5 a , \u03c3 a , N a } p47 = {322.9, 53.9, 62}. The 'p47' subscript indicates that these statistical values are evaluated on Prop. 47 offenses. To verify whether the before-to-after crime increase is statistically significant we perform a one-tailed Welch's t-test by calculating the following t-statistic",

Although the climate in the coastal Los Angeles basin is typically mild-to-hot and dry throughout the year, heavy rainfall is concentrated in the months of February and March, potentially affecting crime rates. Similarly, large numbers of tourists visit Santa Monica during the summer. It is thus important to remove seasonal effects from the time series to better understand underlying trends. As mentioned in Sect. 2, the raw data lists the date of each crime; for convenience we aggregate all occurrences by month to produce a crime time series Y (t) where t is a discrete variable that labels each month from January 2006 to December 2019. In order to separate the main trend in crime progression from possible periodic perturbations, we use the Seasonal and Trend decomposition using Loess (STL decomposition) method on our data set (Cleveland et al. 1990 ). Here, the full crime time series Y (t) is decomposed into a trend T (t), a seasonality S(t), and a remainder R(t) so that Y (t) = T (t)+S(t)+R(t), where S(t) is periodic and R(t) represents any residual fluctuations of Y (t). We discard the multiplicative option where the time series is expressed as a product of its components, Y (t) = S(t) R(t) T (t), since we expect seasonality effects to remain relatively stable over the temporal arc of our data. We decompose the data using the 'stl' function in the R statistical package (R Core Team 2018). The algorithm requires several parameters to be be specified, including w trend , the time-frame over which the data is smoothed. Details are illustrated in Sect. A.1 of the Supplementary Information (SI).",

The trend of the number of monthly Prop. 47 crimes starts to increase towards the end of 2014, but no corresponding rise is observed for the non-reclassified ones. In fact, non-Prop. 47 crimes appear to be declining from 2014 onwards apart from a slight increase around 2018. This indicates that the rise in the observed reclassified crime trend should not be attributed to a general pattern of increasing crime rates in the city of Santa Monica, rather it suggests that a specific event in late 2014 is responsible for the observed rise in Prop. 47 crimes, without playing any role in the dynamics of the non-Prop. 47 ones. We identify this event with the implementation of the new law. A significant drop in the T (t) trend emerges for Prop. 47 crimes towards the end of 2018, persisting throughout 2019, and concurrent with the several new initiatives undertaken by the SMPD to improve public safety and towards more community-based operations.",

If so, we also aim to identify the times at which these changes occur, and the associated confidence intervals. To do this, we use change-point analysis, a well developed method that has been applied to many disciplines, from economics to medicine (Page 1954 (Page , 1957 Chen and Gupta 2011) . Once a time series is given, the basic foundation of change-point analysis is to evaluate a statistical quantity on a subsample of the data immediately prior and immediately after each time point. If the difference between the prior and after quantities surpasses a given threshold, the selected time point is the locus of a change-point, given that some consistency requirements are met. This concept can be applied to the mean, variance, or any moment or derived property of the data (Killick and Eckley 2014; Killick et al. 2016) . Operationally, the detection of a change-point is framed as a hypothesis test, where the null hypothesis is that there are no change-points and the alternative hypothesis is that at least one exists (Page 1954 (Page , 1957 . In our case, since we expect Prop. 47 to affect the crime trend, we seek to identify the time when T (t) exhibits the largest rate of change. We thus calculate the difference between subsequent T (t) values and derive a new time series for the slope of T (t), which we refer to as M (t). The M (t) time series is constructed by evaluating the backward difference on each time point",

As shown in Fig. 7 when using the monthly time series Y (t), breakpoints occur on December 2016 and August 2019 with 95% confidence intervals that do not contain November 2014. Performing a segmented regression on T (t) obtained by setting w trend = 19 months yields one breakpoint on November 2006 and one on August 2010 with 95% confidence intervals that do not include November 2014 in either case. For the non-Prop. 47 crimes, breakpoints for both Y (t) and T (t) are highly unstable and highly sensitive to the choice of w trend . Furthermore, regardless of the value of w trend or the number of breakpoints specified, we found no 95% confidence interval that contain November 2014, or even a proximal time frame, as a likely breakpoint for non-Prop. 47 crimes. Hence, the abrupt change in the reclassified time series observed in November 2014 should be attributed not to an overall increase in crime, but rather to an event that specifically affected this category of crimes. As discussed above, we identify this event with the implementation of Prop. 47 in November 2014. Similarly, the second breakpoint evaluated on the Prop. 47 time series and occurring in September 2018 may be attributed to the new SMPD policing strategies Renaud (2019); Pauker (2019a,b) which may have had a stronger impact on Prop. 47 crimes than on non-Prop. 47 ones, for which no corresponding breakpoint was observed. This is because reclassified crimes are generally low-level and quality of life offenses, more easily impacted by the community-based initiatives and the increased patrolling efforts undertaken by the SMPD, such as engagement with vulnerable populations, increased illumination, and physical presence.",

The current analysis reveals that while increased crime levels were observed for the reclassified crimes in most neighborhoods, the strongest effects were felt in areas that were already primed for a criminal surge. In Sect. A.3 we perform an STL decomposition in each of the eight Santa Monica neighborhoods, similarly to what was done in Sect. 3.2 to analyze time dependent trends at the local level. Fig. 18 in the SI shows that Downtown is marked by the highest increase in crime after implementation of Prop. 47 but also by the strongest decrease starting at the end of 2018. The observed decrease may be an indicator of success for the concurrent new police initiatives that added more approachable police officers to engage with the community, often on foot patrol and in highly frequented areas, and a series of measures to improve illumination and monitoring of parking garages and other public places that are more prevalent Downtown.",

Train and bus routes are usually concentrated in areas with high human activity, offering more opportunities for predatory crime. However, the impact of mass transit on crime is found to also depend on the overall demographic, socio-economic, and land-use contexts surrounding transit stops (Levine et al. 1986 ; Loukaitou-Sideris 1999; Loukaitou-All crimes; Monthly averages (2006-2014; 2014-2016; 2016-2019) Figure 12: Histograms of monthly total crime counts in a 450 meter radius area centered around the four new Expo Line stations in Santa Monica.

Here, the gray and colored bars represent crime densities before passage of Prop. 47, and in the interim between passage of Prop. 47 and before opening of the Expo Line, respectively. The right panels are distributions after November 2014 (before and after opening of the Expo Line). Here, the gray and colored bars represent crime densities in the interim between passage of Prop. 47 and before opening of the Expo Line, and after opening of the Expo Line, respectively. Changes to the mean are not statistically significant prior to opening of the Expo Line; crimes increase significantly at the Downtown and 17 th Street/Santa Monica College stops after opening of the Expo Line. Corresponding data is listed in Table 4 . Sideris et al. 2002) .

            "text": "Using a publicly-available database compiled and maintained by the Santa Monica Police Department, we investigated whether passage of Proposition 47 in the state of California had any impact on criminal activity. We specifically focused on crimes that were directly affected by legislative change and were reclassified from felonies to misdemeanors. Our analysis shows that overall the monthly count of these crimes (larceny, fraud, possession of narcotics, forgery, receiving/possessing stolen property) increased by about 15% after implementation of Proposition 47 in November 2014. By contrast, the non-reclassified crime count decreased by 13% after the new legislation became effective. We used a Welch's t-test to verify that the reclassified crime distribution shift from less crime before November 2014 to more crime after the same date was statistically significant, as well as signal decomposition to isolate the main crime trends from seasonal effects. Using change-point analysis, we identified a discontinuity in crime trend at the end of 2014. A segmented regression analysis on the monthly time series led us to identify November 2014 as the main breakpoint. We also identified a secondary discontinuity in the crime trend and a secondary break-point in the monthly time series, both occurring towards the end of 2018, indicating a decreases in crime concurrent with the new SMPD policing efforts. While these changes are too recent to reverse the overall crime surge observed after the 2014 implementation of Prop. 47, and while it is unclear what the longer term implications of the new initiatives will be, our results show that community partnerships, a responsive and outward facing police force, and targeted measures, may help ameliorate crime. We also considered the impact of Prop. 47 on the eight neighborhoods that comprise the city and verified that the largest monthly change in crime (+37.2%) occurred Downtown, an area with many opportunistic crime attractors, such as nightlife, tourists, dining venues, and shopping centers. Finally, we examined the effects of the opening of the Expo Line on monthly crime rates within 450 meters from four new transit stations. We find that total crime counts increase significantly at the Downtown Santa Monica and 17 th Street/Santa Monica College stops. Prop. 47 and non-Prop. 47 percent increases were comparable at the Downtown Santa Monica stop (+30.6% and +34.6% respectively); at the 17 th Street/Santa Monica College stop instead, the increase for Prop. 47 crimes (+38.6%) was much higher than for non-Prop. 47 ones (+20.6%). Several observations are in order. The city of Santa Monica does not report the monetary value of relevant crimes. Partitioning of the data into reclassified vs. non-reclassified offenses is thus based on our best estimate of which crimes would, on average, fall under the 950 USD threshold, one of the conditions specified by Prop. 47 for reclassification. For example, the initiative applies to grand theft auto but only for vehicles worth less than 950 USD. Since the typical value of stolen cars in Santa Monica surpasses this threshold, we do not include grand theft auto in the list of Prop. 47 crimes. It is clear that exceptions may exist and that our partitioning may have introduced errors; however, due to the large data sample, we expect these not to be systematic and not to have significantly affected our results. Other biases could arise from unreported victimizations differentially affecting the reclassified vs. non-reclassified crime categories. For instance, the US Department of Justice estimates that the average annual incidence of unreported larceny was 41% nationwide over the 2006-2010 period; for motor vehicle theft the same figure was 17% (Langton et al. 2012) . Similarly, reporting rates could change over time in response to changing perceptions of the effectiveness of reporting crimes. We also observe that in the immediate vicinity of the four new train stations in Santa Monica no increases in reclassified or non-reclassified crimes were observed after passage of Prop. 47 but before opening of light rail. This may be due to ongoing construction of the new crime attractor, which delayed the effects of Prop. 47. Indeed, crimes increased dramatically at the busiest transit stations after opening of the Expo Line, especially in the Downtown area and for the reclassified crimes. Finally, the period between passage of Prop. 47 in November 2014 and the opening of the Expo Line in May 2016 is only 18 months. Compounding effects of the two events may have led to the observed increases in crime; disentangling their overlap may require more discriminants than the data analyzed here.",

Similarly, it would be interesting to study the incidence of crime on the other three new Expo Line stations operating in Culver City (Palms, Westwood/Rancho Park, Expo/Sepulveda) to compare and contrast results between the two municipalities. A longer term monitoring of crime in Santa Monica would also be desirable. On one hand, it would allow us to determine whether the decrease in the number of monthly crimes observed in late 2018 persists or stabilizes over time. On the other, it would allow us to better discern the effects of the Expo Line, since the incidence of crime may temporarily increase around newly opened stations and settle back to their original levels once novelty effects subside (Poister 1996 ). This may not be possible due to the COVID-19 pandemic that severely impacted the global economy. Suspension of all non-essential activities and stay-at-home orders within the city of Santa Monica, as well as reduction to service and ridership of the Expo Line, do not allow for a meaningful, continuous, long term analysis. Although conducted over short time frames, both after passage of Prop. 47 and the inauguration of the Expo Line, our results do suggest that neighborhood characteristics may influence crime rates, since areas with more opportunities for crime appear to have been affected more by the light rail extension and by the new law. Similarly, our results show that community-based policing, a stronger police presence and targeted interventions may help reduce crime.",

While it is possible that the new law directly motivated offenders to commit more reclassified crimes, there may also be other relevant explanations contributing to the rise. Among them, the increased attention of police, heightened public awareness, more reporting, all of which may have been influenced by media coverage. The observed rise may also be a loose manifestation of the well known Hawthorne effect, whereby individuals modify their behavior as a result of being part of an experiment or study (Roethlisberger and Dickson 1939; Adair 1984) . In this case, reporting behavior could have been affected by awareness of the changes brought by Prop. 47. Similarly, the decrease in the number of reported reclassified crimes observed in late 2018 may be due to shifts in policing, but also due to fading of Prop. 47 awareness, or habituation. We hope that these and other considerations relevant to public utility, respect for human rights, and existence of socioeconomic disparities, will be used in combination with our results to assess the overall effect of Prop. 47.

A new seasonal series is obtained through a combination of loess (locally estimated scatterplot smoothing) polynomial regression with given weights, and moving averages performed on each of the cycle-subseries. The loess regression ensures that the obtained seasonality is defined for all times, not just when data points are available; the moving average procedures guarantee the mean is nearly zero. The input data is then cleared of the newly derived seasonal effect and a temporary trend is obtained, once more using a loess polynomial regression. The freshly derived trend and seasonal estimates are then used as inputs for the next iteration. Any residual elements are included in the remainder and used to compute robustness weights, to reduce the influence of transient, aberrant behavior in the data on the trend and seasonal components. The procedure is run until a pre-set convergence is reached; typically two loops suffice. Two window lengths must be specified to apply the loess regression in the 'stl' function: w season (the s.window argument in R) and w trend (the t.window argument in R). Since we do not assume seasonal patterns to have significantly evolved over the thirteen year time span under investigation, we use the entire data to perform the loess seasonal smoothing analysis and set s.window = periodic. Effectively, the monthly cycle-subseries are smoothed using weighted averages over all the pertaining monthly data. Note that if seasonality were expected to change over the 2006-2019 arc the analysis would have to be performed using a more restricted window, so that older seasonal patterns do not affect more recent ones. Finally, w trend is assumed to be an odd integer and is set following standard procedures (R Core Team 2018) as t.window = Nextodd Ceiling 1.5 n p 1 \u2212 1.5 /s.window .",

The value of w trend plays a fundamental role in the decomposition process: as this parameter increases more points are used in the smoothing process, and sharper trends may be identified. Increases to w trend however may also minimize, eliminate, or shift peaks and valleys. Our data set leads to w trend = 19 months. Unless otherwise noted, we use this value as the default; when more resolution is necessary, for example to investigate trends around November 2014, smaller window lengths are used. Fig. 15 shows various smoothed trend curves for different w trend : note how the minimum located towards the end of 2014 shifts in time and depth as w trend is modified.",

A mosum statistic is then constructed as the difference between the after and prior averages divided by an ad-hoc standard deviation, which may be chosen as the root of the average, minimum, or maximum of the after and prior variances. We select the average. The mosum statistic is then compared with a threshold derived from an asymptotic distribution that depends on the bandwidth, the size of the entire time series, and a significance level chosen by the user.

For all of them changes in the rate of Prop. 47 crimes emerged towards the second half of 2014, between June 2014 and August 2014, The choice of w trend = 1, which corresponds to building the slope M (t) from the full time series Y (t) without any smoothing procedure, typically yields no change-points due to the irregularity of the data, as mentioned above. Some parameter choices allow us to identify additional change-points at the end of 2018. For example, w trend = 19 months, G = 5 months, \u03b7 = 5, = 0.5 yield October 2018 as a new change-point in addition to June 2014. This is true for other {w trend , G, \u03b7, } combinations that allow for a smaller window size and a smaller distance between change-points. Thus, while the main change-point remains between June 2014 and August 2014, a minor one also arises towards the end of 2018 for Prop. 47 crimes. The change-point loci for the non-Prop. 47 crimes are more heavily dependent on the chosen {w trend , G, \u03b7, } parameters, and typically do not extend into 2014.

The latter are typically null sets. In each iteration the data is cleared of the current trend estimate and broken into cycle-subseries, one for each of the data points within a period. In our case, since we have monthly data with a periodicity of n p = 12 months, twelve cycle-subseries",
