            "text": "Initially, acute loss of smell (anosmia) and taste (ageusia) was not considered important symptoms for coronavirus disease 2019 . To determine the prevalence of these symptoms and to evaluate their diagnostic significance, we (approximately 150 physicians of the Daegu Medical Association) prospectively collected data of cases of anosmia and ageusia from March 8, 2020, via telephone interview among 3,191 patients in Daegu, Korea. Acute anosmia or ageusia was observed in 15. 3% (488/3,191) patients in the early stage of COVID-19 and in 15.7% (367/2,342) patients with asymptomatic-to-mild disease severity. Their prevalence was significantly more common among females and younger individuals (P = 0.01 and P < 0.001, respectively). Most patients with anosmia or ageusia recovered within 3 weeks. The median time to recovery was 7 days for both symptoms. Anosmia and ageusia seem to be part of important symptoms and clues for the diagnosis of COVID-19, particularly in the early stage of the disease.",

            "text": "With an explosive increase in the number of new patients, hospital bed shortage was a great challenge to the healthcare system. 1 We developed and employed a remote telephone severity scoring system (Daegu Severity Score for COVID-19) for assigning priority for hospitalization and arranging for facility isolation (\"therapeutic living centers\") starting on February 29, 2020. 1 Fifteen centers were operated for the 3,033 admissions to COVID-19 therapeutic living centers. 1 Approximately 150 physicians of the Daegu Medical Association (DMA) voluntarily participated in this study and checked the status of patients who were staying at home on a daily basis. 1 They reported the interview results to the team arranging hospitalization or facility isolation in Daegu. During the interviews, several DMA physicians found that a significant number of the patients stated experiencing acute loss of smell (anosmia) or loss of taste (ageusia). Acute smell and taste disorders are related to a wide range of respiratory viral infections. 2,3 COVID-19 is characterized by a variety of clinical manifestations. 4 In a typical case, a high fever appears after dry cough; in some cases, viral pneumonia develops and progresses, resulting in shortness of breath. 4,5 Common symptoms among patients with COVID-19 include fever, dry cough, shortness of breath (dyspnea), muscle ache (myalgia), confusion, headache, sore throat, rhinorrhea, chest pain, diarrhea, nausea/vomiting, conjunctival congestion, nasal congestion, sputum production, fatigue (malaise), hemoptysis, and chills. 4,6-9 A literature review revealed a few published articles on the importance of anosmia or ageusia as symptoms of COVID-19. 10-13",
