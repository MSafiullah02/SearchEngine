Examination revealed unilateral eyelid edema and moderate conjunctival hyperemia. A few hours later the patient experienced intense headache and developed fever, cough and severe dyspnea. A nasopharyngeal swab proved positive for SARS-CoV-2. This case demonstrates that conjunctivitis can be the inaugural manifestation of the COVID-19 infection. It illustrates the interest of telemedicine in ophthalmology during the COVID-19 pandemic, since moderate conjunctival hyperemia can be the first sign of a severe respiratory distress.

In a large study including 1,099 hospitalized patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 from 30 hospitals in China, conjunctival congestion was documented in 9 patients (0.8%) (2). In a report of 38 hospitalized patients diagnosed clinically as COVID-19, one third had ocular abnormalities, including conjunctival hyperemia, chemosis, epiphora, and increased secretions (3). Ocular manifestations were mostly reported during the middle phase of the disease, and in patients with severe pneumonia (3). More severe ocular manifestations as anterior uveitis, retinitis, and optic neuritis have been only documented in animal models (4).",

External examination revealed unilateral eyelid edema and moderate conjunctival hyperemia (Figure 1). A topical association of antibiotic and corticoids was prescribed. Three hours later the patient presented severe headache and fever at 39\u00b0C and he developed 12 hours later cough and severe dyspnea impairing speech.
