            "text": "In late 2019, accounts emerged from Wuhan city in China of a virus of unknown origin that was leading 2 to a cluster of pneumonia cases [1] . The virus was identified as a novel strain of coronavirus on 7th 3 January 2020 [2] and the first known death as a result of the disease occurred two days later [1] . Over 4 the next few days, cases were reported in several other cities in China and in other countries around 5 the world including South Korea, Japan and the United States of America. On 23rd January, the 6 Chinese government issued an order for Wuhan city to enter \"lockdown\", whereby all public transport 7 was suspended and residents were not allowed to leave the city. Over the next 24 hours, these measures 8 were extended to all the major cities in Hubei province in an attempt to prevent further spread of 9 disease. 10 Whilst the introduction of these severe social distancing measures began to have an effect upon re-11 ducing the growth rate of cases in Wuhan [3] [4] [5] , reported cases outside China continued to grow and 12 by late February the virus, now designated by the World Health Organisation as SARS-CoV-2, and 13 the disease it causes as coronavirus disease 2019 , had spread to Europe, with a growing 14 number of cases being reported in northern Italy [6] . As more countries in Europe and around the 15 world started to experience a dramatic rise in cases, similar measures were put in place in an effort to 16 protect the most vulnerable members of society and to ensure that health services capacities were not 17 exceeded [6, 7] . 18 In the UK, the first cases of COVID-19 were reported on 31st January 2020, in the city of York in 19 the north of England. In the early stages of the UK outbreak, the government focused on a strategy 20 of containment, to reduce the likelihood of large-scale within-country transmission occurring. This 21 strategy involved rapid identification and isolation of infected individuals, achieved through contact 22 tracing and testing of suspect cases. However, by early March it was evident that sustained community 23 transmission was occurring and there was a growing concern that a large epidemic could rapidly 24 overwhelm the health service, resulting in a significant number of deaths. This led to the government 25 considering the introduction of a range of social distancing measures in order to slow the growth of the 26 outbreak, thus delaying and flattening the epidemic peak and reducing the risk of exceeding hospital 27 capacities owing to an influx of COVID-19 patients. On 12th March, the UK officially entered the 28 \"delay\" phase, with the government declaring that all individuals with a cough or fever should self-29 isolate for a period of seven days. Over the following days, several major sporting events were cancelled 30 and the Prime Minister advised against all non-essential travel and contact with others. With daily 31 cases and deaths continuing to rise, the government introduced its most severe measures, with firstly 32 all restaurants, pubs and cafes being ordered to close on 20th March, followed by a \"stay at home\" 33 order on the evening of 23rd March and the closure of all non-essential retail outlets for an indefinite 34 period. By this time the reported number of deaths in the UK had reached 335.",

This evidence, together with behavioural considerations from SPI-B (Inde-39 pendent Scientific Pandemic Influenza Group on Behaviours) and advice from NERVTAG (New and 40 Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group), is collated and coordinated by SAGE (Scien-41 tific Advisory Group for Emergencies) to support UK cross-government decisions in the Cabinet Office 42 Briefing Room (COBR). As the UK lockdown continues, modelling groups, including those of SPI-M, 43 are analysing potential \"exit strategies\", which could allow some relaxation of social distancing mea-44 sures, whilst minimising the future impact of the disease on the health service. Epidemiologists are 45 critially aware that, should measures be relaxed too rapidly when there are still sufficient susceptible 46 individuals in the population, there is a high risk of a second infection wave that may once again 47 threaten to overwhelm health services. 48 In this paper, we present a novel mathematical model of SARS-CoV-2 transmission that is currently 49 being utilised to provide short and long term forecasts regarding the future course of the COVID-19 50 outbreak in the UK. Our model uses real-time data on confirmed cases requiring hospital care and 51 mortality to provide up-to-date predictions on epidemic spread in ten regions of the UK. We investigate 52 how compliance with social distancing affects future epidemic outcomes. We compare and contrast 53 different exit strategies, namely: relaxing social distancing by age group, or the regional lifting and 54 imposition of restrictions according to healthcare system capacity. Finally, we explore the sensitiv-55 ity of our conclusions to a key biological aspect of SARS-CoV2 which remains unknown: whether 56 different age groups differ in their core susceptibility to infection, or their likelihood of displaying 57 symptoms.",

In the ongoing outbreak in the 62 UK, cases of COVID-19 are confirmed based upon testing, with priority for testing given to patients 63 requiring critical care in hospitals [8] -generating biases and under-reporting. There is evidence to 64 suggest that a significant proportion of individuals who are infected may be asymptomatic or have only 65 mild symptoms [9, 10] . These asymptomatic individuals are still able to transmit infection [11] , though 66 it remains unclear whether they do so at a reduced level. Our modelling approach has consequently 67 been designed to consider the interplay between symptoms (and hence detection) and transmission 68 of COVID-19. We developed a deterministic, age-structured compartmental model, stratified into 69 five-year age bands. Transmission was governed through age-dependent mixing matrices based on 70 UK social mixing patterns [12, 13] . The population was further stratified according to current disease 71 status, following a susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered (SEIR) paradigm, as well as differentiating 72 by symptoms, quarantining and household status (Fig. 1 ). Susceptibles (S) infected by SARS-CoV-2 73 entered a latent state (E) before becoming infectious. Given that only a proportion of individuals who 74 are infected are tested and subsequently identified, the infectious class in our model was partitioned 75 into symptomatic (and hence potentially detectable), D, and asymptomatic (and likely to remain 76 undetected) infections, U . We assumed both susceptibility and disease detection were dependent upon 77 age, although the partitioning between these two components is largely indeterminable (additional 78 details are given in Table 1 and Supporting Text S1). We modelled the UK population aggregated to 79 ten regions (Wales, Scotland, Northern Ireland, East of England, London, Midlands, North East and 80 Yorkshire, North West England, South East England, South West England).",

We addressed 86 this limitation by extending the standard SEIR models such that first infections without a household 87 (E F , D F , U F ) are treated differently from subsequent infections (E S , D S , U S ). To account for the 88 depletion of susceptibles in the household, we assumed that all within household transmission is gen-89 erated by the first infection within the household (for further details, see Supporting Text S1).

To account for 178 regional variation in the outbreak and local hospital capacities, we assumed that control measures 179 would operate locally, using the ten regions. We therefore used a pro-rata threshold, which equated 180 to 3,000 occupied beds on a nationwide scale, as a trigger for reintroducing or relaxing controls (see 181  Table S2 ). Given the sizeable delay between the implementation of controls and their effects on ICU 182 occupancy, the dynamics only predicted a low number of switches between control and relaxation.

However, 188 there is still ongoing uncertainty in the relative level of transmission from asymptomatic individuals 189 (\u03c4 ) and the mechanisms driving age-specific detection rates (\u03b1). A range of \u03b1 and \u03c4 parameter values 190 are all able to generate predictions that closely match the available data. We therefore carried out a 191 sensitivity analysis to these two parameters, investigating the impact of applying lockdown measures 192 for specific age groups, as these parameters vary. We allowed \u03c4 , the relative level of transmission from 193 asymptomatic individuals, to vary between 0 and 0.5; while \u03b1 varied between 0 and 1. For large \u03b1, 194 higher proportions of confirmed cases in a particular age group is as a result of greater susceptibility; 195 whereas low vales of \u03b1 indicate that a higher proportions of confirmed cases is due to greater severity of 196 symptoms. This key parameter interacts with the relative transmission from asymptomatic infection 197 (\u03c4 ), although \u03c4 plays a minimal role when \u03b1 is small. To assess the impact of these parameters on the 198 effectiveness of lockdown measures, we computed the early epidemic growth rate under restrictions 199 that target four specific age-groupings: (i) pre-school children under 5 (PS), (ii) school-aged children 200 and young adults, 5-20 (S), (iii) adults between the age of 20 and 70 (A) and (iv) the elderly over 70 201 (E).

Whilst the short term forecasts from these simulations suggest that keeping 227 some lockdown measures in place can have a positive impact upon reducing cases and deaths, we note 228 that, for simulations in which more severe lockdown remains in place after 7th May, a second infection 229 wave is predicted in 2021, when all social distancing measures are removed.

We observe that continuing lockdown for anyone over the age of 45 for the 237 duration of 2020 results in the lowest number of deaths and number of admissions into hospital and 238 ICU wards during 2020 (Fig. 4, first column) . However, upon release of these lockdown measures, we 239 observed a significant second wave in 2021 when isolation includes these younger age groups (Fig. 4 , 240 second column). When isolation is only in place for older age groups, a large initial wave of infection 241 occurs during 2020, but a subsequent secondary wave is not observed. If we consider the overall 242 impact from 2020-2021, we find that a strategy of continuing lockdown measures for anyone over the 243 age of 65 minimises the total number of deaths, and continuing these measures for anyone over the 244 age of 60 minimises hoapital and ICU occupancy, though the overall effect of this when compared 245 with other age-related lockdown policies is marginal (Fig. 4 , third column). Continuing lockdown for 246 the over 60s throughout 2020 whilst relaxing measures of the remainder of the population results in, 247 on average, 138,000 deaths by the end of 2021 (Table 2 ). Finally, we note that, as the age-threshold 248 at which shielding is implemented increases, the total number of days for which ICU bed occupancy 249 exceeds 4,000 increases, implying that only shielding older age groups may put severe demands upon 250 the health service (Fig. 4 , third row).",

No interventions were applied post-lockdown release, with simulations continued until the end of 2022. Box plots per considered age threshold convey median values for each statistic and extent of spread. Solid lines depict the profile of median estimates across age threshold space. The following statistics were computed for the period 23rd March 2020 to the end of 2021: (Row one) cumulative deaths; (Row two) cumulative ICU bed occupancy; (Row three) amount of days ICU occupancy exceeded 4000; (Row four) cumulative hospital bed occupancy.

We consistently find that any relaxation of control measures in the 311 short term leads to a rapid resurgence of COVID-19 disease with the health system potential being 312 overwhelmed by a sizeable second epidemic wave (Fig. 3) . In contrast, moderate or no adjustments to 313 current social distancing measures allows hospital and ICU occupancy to remain within capacity over 314 the duration of the outbreak. It is apparent from the data on confirmed cases and deaths as a result 315 of COVID-19 disease that the risks associated with infection increase with age [15] [16] [17] . We therefore 316 also investigated the impact of age-specific control policies, whereby lockdown measures remained in 317 place for all individuals over a certain age until the end of 2020. We found that, whilst some marginal 318 gains can be made should everyone over the age of 60 be put under isolation measures, extending this 319 policy to include younger age groups increases the risk of a second wave occurring when measures are 320 relaxed. Furthermore, we projected critical care to be stretched and ICU bed occupancy to exceed 321 4,000 during the course of the pandemic in all but the most wide-ranging age-specific lockdown policies 322 (Fig. 4) .",

Data informing contact structure for the UK were measured histori-352 cally [12] . Were contact patterns in early 2020 (pre-lockdown) to substantially differ from the preex-353 isting data, the influence of projected intervention effects may be impacted. Similarly, while we can 354 infer the compliance to the currently imposed rules, we have limited understand of how people will 355 behave if the controls are released -will they remain wary of potentially infectious situations, or 356 will they compensate for the time in lockdown. Throughout we have assumed that mixing patterns 357 would return to their pre-pandemic norm. Heterogeneities in compliance and in infection patterns, 358 such as increased transmission in hospitals and institutions may affect the outcome of the measures 359 considered. We note that the estimates of deaths resulting from an individual strategy does not take 360 into account the potential for increased deaths due to exceeding hospital or ICU capacities, and so may 361 underestimate deaths from strategies resulting in high occupancies. In addition, though there have 362 been recorded instances of superspreading events for COVID-19 [20] , our model does not explicitly 363 account for such dynamics. However, beyond the early stages of the outbreak the dynamics at the 364 population-level are generally driven by the average pattern of social mixing, rather than individual 365 level variation.",
