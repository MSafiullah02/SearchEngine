Elucidation of the way in which sub-cellular components work together to form functional cells and organisms will enable complete understanding of cellular processes and the way the cell responds to the environment [1].

For example, the presence of various cancers and diseases is sometimes linked to abnormal concentrations of specific proteins [4]. Also, investigation of nucleic acid sequences, especially for identification of a genetic mutation, is a practical approach used to identify or confirm different pathologies [4, 5]. In infectious diseases, the main cause of mortality in developing countries and one of the major causes in developed countries [6], the pathogenic source becomes even more traceable and is perfect candidate for molecule-based diagnostics. In all these situations, complex samples, available in small amounts, have to be processed rapidly, preferably near the patient\u2019s bedside, and a clinically significant response has to be obtained. In this case, the medical response can be adjusted more rapidly to the patient\u2019s reaction, enabling a personalized medical approach.",

Pandora\u2019s box in the biosciences was opened around the 1990s, when advances in incremental technology, the miniaturization boom, and progress in engineering emerged in microfluidic devices [7]. Microfluidics can be regarded as a framework, an enabling technology [8] related to fluid flowing in channels of micro or nano-size, offering the possibility of developing products with better performance and additional features (Fig. 1). The dawn of expectations started with the concept of the micro-total analytical system (\u03bcTAS) [9]. \u03bcTAS was supposed to perform automatic sampling, sample transport, any necessary chemical reactions, and detection on a single, miniaturized, platform [9]. The concept was declared the state-of-art strategy, because of its amazing advantages, i.e. faster separations, shorter transport time, lower sample and reagent consumption and the possibility of multi-component testing under the same conditions [9].\n\n",

Over 70% of all papers on the use of microfluidic devices in the life sciences and medicine are targeted on the characterization of biological systems at the molecular level (Fig. 2). The use of microfluidics was perceived as a possible new dimension in bioanalysis. Microfluidic device-based applications shifted the perspective from the general to the cellular and sub-cellular level and enabled the measurement of molecular variation, the dynamics of seconds-long processes, and bio-macromolecular motion [10]. Valuable bio-molecules were isolated, characterized, quantified, and used to explore interactions with other molecules.\n\n",

Also, solutions were needed for the extremely sensitive and miniaturized detection systems, while the complexity of samples emphasized the need for sample clean-up or enrichment of analytes of interest.

A trial for alternative ways to avoid the use of antibodies [31] has been reported, but in some cases the use of immobilized antibodies can result in extremely sensitive devices [32\u201335]. A very interesting example, with an intended use for single nucleotide polymorphism diagnosis, is presented in Fig. 3. Dielectrophoresis [36], solid-phase extraction (SPE) [21, 37\u201341] or size-exclusion based separations with nanopores [42] and microfabricated plastic membranes [43] are other possible methods reported for target isolation.\n\n\n",

For the particular case of nucleic acid isolation, commonly used procedures with commercially available kits are cumbersome, and include a substantial number of manual steps. For example, some purification kits require approximately ten pipetting steps, three mechanical mixing steps, six centrifugation steps, and ten tube-transfer steps [44]. The common automation approaches for these tests are benchtop-dependent, and therefore not suited to emerging bedside applications that require compact, automated, and robust operational settings [19]. Still, several successful attempts to automate nucleic acids extraction using microfluidic devices have been reported. A plastic chip has been used for viral RNA extraction from a lysate of mammalian cells infected with influenza A (H1N1) virus [40]. The RNA isolation was achieved by \u03bcSPE, by reversible binding of the nucleic acids to silica particles trapped in a porous polymer monolith [40]. The procedure is extremely simple and only requires 10 min. A solid-phase method to isolate PCR-amplifiable genomic DNA from chemically lysed blood cells has also been used [37]. In this case, a porous silicon matrix integrated in the biochip was used to perform the DNA extraction in 20 min [37].",

It amplifies specific DNA sequences (target) in the presence of a pair of primers that hybridize with the flanking sequences of the target, the four deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates (dNTPs), and a heat-stable DNA polymerase [54]. The amplification is performed in cycles of three steps: strand separation, hybridization of primers and DNA synthesis. Each step is isothermal and requires a specific temperature, i.e. 95 \u00b0C, 54 \u00b0C, and 72 \u00b0C, respectively. The amplification is carried out repetitively just by changing the temperature of the reaction mixture [54]. For RNA amplification, either a reverse-transcriptase (RT) PCR approach or a nucleic acid sequence-based amplification (NASBA) procedure can be used. NASBA is a transcription-based RNA amplification system, which is more sensitive, \u201cuser friendly\u201d, and faster than PCR [55].",

            "text": "The feasibility of rapid, single-molecule amplification of nucleic acids was established using a microfluidic system developed to enable rapid PCR analysis of individual DNA molecules with precise temperature control [57]. PCR was performed on heterogeneous samples containing synthetic CYP2D6.6 wild-type and mutant templates, on a quartz chip designed to enable adequate mixing by Brownian diffusion after each stage of reagent dispensing. Samples were loaded from a microtitre plate on to the microchip through an integrated capillary, which minimizes the contamination risk. The chip design allowed eight parallel PCR reactions. Thermocycling was performed by heating with nine embedded resistive heaters built from platinum tracers and cooling by recirculating water underneath the chip. The system had an impressive detection set-up comprising two different lasers for excitation, i.e. a 488 nm optically pumped solid-state laser and the 633-nm line of an HeNe laser, a series of dichroic mirrors and band pass filters, and three charged-coupled device (CCD) cameras, each collecting light of a different wavelength, i.e. 515, 550, and 685 nm. Thermocouples and optical DNA melt analysis were used to demonstrate the chip\u2019s ability to rapidly thermocycle. When the desired temperature was 68.5 \u00b0C, seven out of the eight channels managed accurate control within a 1\u00b0 range. The efficiency of amplification was proved by measuring the fluorescence emission resulting from amplification of a 1:1 mixture of wild and mutant templates of CYP2D6.6 using two Taqman probes. The procedure is fast, reproducible and able to amplify a heterogeneous sample containing two templates without mixing the amplification products between templates. Use of the proposed microfluidic setup overcomes the high reagent cost and cumbersome reaction assembly requirements of plate-based limiting dilution PCR methods and the low throughput and manual handling of current microchip methods. Almost 96 templates were analyzed in 25 min by use of \u223c1 \u03bcL PCR reaction volume. Compared with digital PCR this operation was performed almost five times faster and using a PCR reaction volume a factor of 1 400 lower [57]. Small channel-to-channel differences in amplification were noticed, but these are potentially reducible by refinement of the heating procedure.",

Cell lysis was performed off-chip, using a commercially available device. tmRNA, from 100 lysed E. coli cells, was purified by SPE using silica beads immobilized on the chip surface. Device clogging by debris, or bubble formation because of passage of air were avoided by immobilization of silica beads in a thin layer that leaves enough free space within the channel.

Another interesting application uses an integrated nanoporous membrane to perform simultaneous concentration and detection of the inactivated swine influenza virus. Detection was achieved by coupling with a fluorescent labelled antibody.

            "text": "An important step in the miniaturization and integration of laboratory operations in self-contained devices was made by designing a microfluidic chip for combinatorial library screening (Fig. 5) [25]. The chip was used to map a combinatorial peptide library of possible epitopes for anti-T7\u2022tag antibody and anti-FLAG \u2022tag antibody. The peptides were displayed on E. coli cells as insertions within an external loop of the outer membrane protein OmpX. The binding peptides were selected in several steps (Fig. 5). In the first step, the library was incubated off-chip with the target biotinylated antibodies. Cells with the binding peptides were captured on streptavidin-functionalized 5.6-\u03bcm polystyrene microspheres. In the second step, a disposable chip was used for serial dieletrophoresis activated cell sorting to separate cells with binding peptides from cells with non-binding peptides. The sorting was performed on the basis of size, in continuous-flow, with a sorting speed of more than 108 cells h\u22121. The antibody-binding target cells captured on microspheres were funnelled dielectrophoretically because of their different polarization [25]. In the third step, the collected beads with attached cells were grown overnight and the sorting in the second step was repeated. The DNA of the sorted cells was sequenced automatically to determine the sequence of the binding peptides. Cell library screening using microfluidic sorting was comparable with a combination of conventional cell sorting-methods, i.e. one round of sequential magnetic selection and two rounds of fluorescence activated cell sorting. The microfluidic sorting chip [25] had increased tolerance of flow disturbances and microbubbles and more robust purity performance using high cell concentrations at the inlet. The authors also mention a possibility of increased throughput by optimization of chip architecture, using parallel channels fabricated on a single chip. The technique could be further developed to monitor polyclonal signatures of serum antibodies for disease profiling, for other affinity-based screening using substrate-functionalized beads, and for automated reagent generation, wherein ligands for a given protein or cell type could be discovered using self-regenerating libraries.\n\n",

There are two major approaches\u2014coupling of the macro-scale optical infrastructure as \u201coff-chip approach\u201d or integration of micro-optical functions on to microfluidic devices as \u201con-chip approach\u201d [110]. Several solutions for integration, for example planar waveguides, coupling schemes to the outside world, evanescent-wave based detectors, and optical fluidics integration problems, and perspectives and limitations of these different solutions have been discussed in detail [107]. Irrespective of the detection approach, the LODs achieved are profoundly affected by sensor size and shape, because of analyte transport limitations rather than signal transduction limitations [110]. Production of inexpensive, sensitive, and portable optical detection systems is, therefore, currently of major importance in the manufacture of commercial devices for portable diagnostic devices [108].",

Because the number of fluorescent analytes is rather limited, a derivatization step with a fluorescent dye is usually involved [42, 51, 65, 89, 111]. Unlike UV detection, an alternative to \u201cdiode array detectors\u201d enabling simultaneous data acquisition at multiple wavelengths is not that accessible for fluorescent detection. Fluorescent detectors are bulky and expensive. In some cases, the ability to combine the available detection technology with the most appropriate label is a real challenge, but also the labelling itself is a major analytical burden. In many cases the detection relies on measurement of fluorescence intensity, performed by capturing the signal with a CCD camera coupled to a fluorescence microscope and followed by graphical analysis of the captured images. For instance, CCD cameras have been used to monitor, capture, and specifically isolate viruses and bacteria [112, 113], to control DNA hybridization [114], to type Staphylococcus aureus strains [115], to quantify proteins after separation [98], or to screen and identify new serological biomarkers for inflammatory bowel disease [62].",

The main disadvantage of this technique is the non-specific measure for mass accumulation, thus any change due to non-specifically loaded molecules cannot be differentiated from the target [127]. In case of surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS), the absorption and scattering of properties of metallic nanoparticles enable their use as enhanced chromophores in molecular labelling [128]. In this way, the disadvantages of SPR are overcome. SERS applications for microfluidic devices are described in detail elsewhere [127].

The device can also be used as an inexpensive and portable sensor capable of discriminating between viruses of different sizes. The technique is sensitive to picomolar concentrations and can be used to detect and distinguish fluorescent objects in the size range of viruses, e.g. phages of 26 nm [123].",

The fabrication of mass spectrometers and interfaces between microfluidic platforms and MS detectors on micro and nano scales is currently one of the most investigated topics [140\u2013142]. The reduction in scale brings advantages such as improved process control and automation, shorter analysis times (minutes or seconds), reduced sample consumption, amenability to multiplexing and high-throughput processing, and lower analysis costs [9, 140\u2013142]. Unfortunately, MS requires multi-step sample pre-treatment procedures, sometimes including liquid chromatographic (LC) separations [14]. Two main MS strategies are currently successfully implemented for quantitative proteomics, namely label-free and stable isotope labelling. These strategies are described in detail elsewhere [140\u2013142].",

Proteins from breast cancer cellular extracts were tryptically digested, cleaned from salts and labelled with an isobaric tag for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ) reagents. Bovine proteins were also added to the sample as standards. The separation was performed using a glass microchip LC\u2013MS, designed in-house and enclosing four distinctive functional elements including a pump, a sampling valve, a separation channel, and an electrospray ionization (ESI) interface. Mobile phase propulsion through the LC channel and ESI interface was achieved by EOF pumping. The pumping unit consisted of two arrays of 200 microchannels, each of 2 cm length and 1.5\u20131.8 \u03bcm depth, connected in parallel. The large number of channels ensured sufficient flow rate and the small size resulted in sufficient hydraulic resistance to pressurize a back-flow leakage. The EOF generated in the multichannels pump ensured mobile phase propulsion. The valving had a similar design. Separation was performed in a channel packed with 5 \u03bcm Zorbax C18 particles. Sample injection was performed electrokinetically and a gradient was generated to perform the separation. Quantitative analysis of an entire protein extract has been performed without any sample pre-fractionation and differential protein expression analysis in MCF-7 cells cultured in the presence of \u03b2-oestradiol and tamoxifen [14]. The chip enabled reliable identification of 40\u201350 proteins and, in another experiment, was able to identify five proteins of several previously reported human putative cancer biomarkers that were up or downregulated [14].",

When surfaces are functionalized with biological macromolecules, supplementary aspects such as biomolecule stability and compatibility also become critical. A wide range of biomolecules have been immobilized on the inner surfaces of devices, e.g. anti-Micoplasma pneomoniae antibodies [148], anti-gp120 antibodies [47], anti-AFP antibodies [77], bacterial cells [149], DNA [114, 147], H1N1 probe [147], and Hsp60 [113]. A microspotting tool has been reported for sequential deposition of biomolecules at the same location on an active surface [120]. The technique enables proper coating of the sensing surface with bioactive layers and parallel deposition of three different biomolecules in a single run [120]. Another technique, the \u201clayer-by-layer\u201d (LbL) technique [150], enables polyelectrolyte coatings to be applied to the surface of digitally encoded microcarriers. The coating of microcarriers with antibodies, and the use of the coated microcarriers as capturing agents, have been reported [150].",

Large capillary forces are hence generated, which may drive fluids into unwanted areas of the device, risking contamination of other fluid streams. Within the channels, the mixing of liquids can only be performed by diffusion, because of the laminar flows. To perform adequate mixing, long channels are needed. A new membrane-type micromixer has been described [112]. Mixing was achieved by injecting compressed air controlled by an electromagnetic valve (EMV). The micromixer was used in the process of incubation of the viral samples and the magnetic beads [112]. Other approaches for mixing liquids include the use of centrifugal force and capillary action [114], and magnetic force [151].",

PCR inhibition occurred only after exposure of the mixture to tubing lengths of 3 m or when the sample volume was reduced. Individual testing of PCR products revealed significant DNA adsorption and an even greater adsorption of the fluorescent dye used. These findings imply that adsorption of reaction components by wall surfaces is responsible for inhibition of PCR in polymeric tubing. These phenomena increase substantially with increasing tubing lengths or with sample volume reduction, but not with contact times or typical flow velocities for dynamic PCR amplification [153]. These results indicate the need for careful consideration of chemical compatibility between polymeric capillaries and DNA dyes when quantitative microfluidic devices are developed [153].",

Further, the target is sandwiched between magnetic microparticle and the gold nanoparticles. The sandwiches are easily separated from the sample in a magnetic field. In a further step, the DNA of the bar code is released by heating. Signal amplification is achieved because for each target recognition thousands of bar-codes are released. Half of the released DNA is detected by use of a scanometric assay based on the affinity of the released DNA for a complementary \u201cuniversal\u201d scanometric gold nanoparticle DNA probe. The other part is complementary to the chip immobilized DNA, responsible for sorting and binding barcodes complementary to the target sequence. The concept has unparalleled sensitivity for target detection, i.e. it can be between one and six orders of magnitude more sensitive than conventional ELISA.

The beginning is complete, and applications, for example MammaPrint (Table 5), that uses a microfluidic platform to give a prognosis of the future evolution of breast cancer, will increasingly become part of our life. Technically, applications within the life sciences are increasingly trying to resemble the world depicted in \u201970s\u2013\u201980s science fiction movies: devices were always small (handheld), incredibly sleek, and provided all the information necessary at a moment\u2019s notice [173]. Use of microfluidics devices in life science and medicine have revealed new perspectives and enabled deeper investigation, but they have still to find their way to more generalized and commercialized applications.",
