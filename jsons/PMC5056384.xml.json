A high Pearson correlation (0.96, p < 10\u22123), and agreement with the normality assumption (p > 0.05, using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov normality test), also suggests a linear relationship between the arrival time and effective distance. Taking the slope of the plot gives us an effective velocity of spread, which we find to be 0.015 days\u22121, which is much slower than for previous diseases (\u22480.1 days\u22121)8. An intuitive explanation for our finding is that lower overall migration in West Africa reduces the speed at which EVD spreads compared to other diseases.",

Despite the lower quality data, however, we can still use it to determine the most likely origin of EVD, which we compare to the known origin, Gu\u00e9ck\u00e9dou, Guinea. Quickly finding where a disease originated is important to help understand what caused it (e.g., what was the vector), and to predict where and when it will arrive, which can allow health workers to prepare8. Previously, it was found that the correlation between the arrival time and the effective distances from the disease origin is higher than correlations from areas where the disease did not originate8. We therefore ranked the correlation between the arrival times and effective distances from all the administrative divisions where Ebola was found between 2013 and 2016 (Fig. 3 and Supplementary Fig. S2), and found the true origin has the highest correlation. To determine the statistical significance of the ranking, we bootstrapped residuals of the linear regression between Deff and Ta, with Gu\u00e9ck\u00e9dou as the origin, to accurately bootstrap arrival times. This is equivalent to simulating what would happen if we wound back the clock and restarted the infection from Gu\u00e9ck\u00e9dou. The true origin has the highest correlation 45% \u00b1 1.6% of the time for the radiation model, and 44\u201370% of the time for gravity models (Supplementary Fig. S2), therefore the true origin does not always have the highest correlation, but it often does, and can be a good first guess when determining the origin.",

This seems implausible; more likely, all individuals are susceptible and, as they become aware of an infection, they reduce their interactions or otherwise reduce the overall disease transmissibility. To demonstrate this hypothesis, we created a more realistic, although still simplistic, disease model, in which susceptible (s) individuals can become infected (i), but then recover or are removed17. In our data, all individuals who recovered or died were assumed to be \u201cremoved\u201d. The SIR model, like the SI model, significantly overshoots the cumulative number of cases in the absence of intervention. We counter-balance this effect with an exponentially decreasing disease transmissibility as a result of public health interventions1819. We call this model the Susceptible - Decreasingly Infectious - Recovered (SDIR) model.",

For example, the virus has been found to spread via sexual contact, and has been seen in vaginal fluid for up to 33 days, and in semen for up to 82 days via cell culture, and 550 days via RNA. These values are extremes and might not be likely to be encountered often, however there has been at least one other report of RNA seen in semen 100 days afterwards27. The length scale of 0.5 degrees, however, is roughly the distance between prefectures, which probably explains why the peak is at this bandwidth. We also find that our results are robust to choices of h and \u0394t, and we therefore let h vary between 0.1 and 1 degrees and \u0394t vary between 30 and 300 days.",

When Ss = 0, s is no stronger or weaker than the infection as a whole. If Ss < 0, then s is stronger than strains of EVD generally, while Ss > 0 implies the opposite (see Fig. 8). To determine the statistical significance of Ss, we bootstrap values for which Ss = 0 (see Methods). We find that Ss is significantly different than chance, (Fig. 9), therefore, Ebola strains might not be uniformly transmissible.For example, SL1 has one of the most negative values of Ss (Fig. 9), where all values are statistically significant (p < 0.05, n varies with \u0394t). Interestingly, we also find the values of SL1 appear to fluctuate, possibly because we only have 9 SL1 datapoints, versus 37, 19, 13, and 36 datapoints for GN1, GN2, GN3, and GN4, respectively. Most other strains have a success metric indicating a stronger strain than expected by chance probably because few strains are concurrent in time, and therefore, comparing Ss across strains is difficult. Our method may be compared to the method used by Meyer, Elias, and Hohle28, who compared the success of invasive meningococcal disease (IMD) strains.

First, EVD appears to spread with a constant effective velocity through a migration network, in disagreement with the homogeneous mixing hypothesis (Figs 1 and 2, and Supplementary Fig. S1) commonly used to model diseases like Ebola. By taking into account the role a migration network has in disease spread, we can predict where EVD will arrive with greater accuracy than before. This method can also accelerate the process of identifying the index case by determining which administrative division is the origin through arrival time-effective distance correlation maximization. Second, we find that the growth of EVD at the finer spatial resolutions can be well described by three scaling parameters, and the initial growth rate decreases with the population density, contrary to our intuition, which suggests that a population density-dependent EVD model may more accurately predict the spread of Ebola when the disease first arrives at an administrative division. One plausible explanation for this result is that higher population density areas receive better healthcare than other areas, but more work is necessary to understand this behavior. Finally, we find a wide variation in the transmissibility of different strains of EVD, which suggests that modeling each disease strain, when this information is known, can improve the prediction task by reducing the heterogeneity of the data. In addition, our method may improve vaccination strategies if vaccines are made for particularly transmissible strains as well as the most common ones.",

A meta-population model treats areas such as cities, districts, or countries as nodes on a network, with links connecting them to represent the flow of individuals from one area to another. Diseases within each area (node) are modeled with a compartmental model, under the assumption that the homogeneous mixing approximation is more accurate in smaller areas than for the entire network.

For districts providing multiple census datasets, we collected from the latest report: Guinea, 2014; Liberia, 2008; Mali, 2009; Nigeria 2011; Senegal 2013; and Sierra Leone, 2004. Some population data is probably out-of-date and may lead to some biases in the population density and radiation model. However, we believe that newer data will confirm our initial conclusions.",
