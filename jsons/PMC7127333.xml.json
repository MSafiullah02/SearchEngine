Although recent advances in molecular diagnostic tools have improved our understanding of the impact of HRV infections, they have also revealed confounding factors such as the detection of multiple pathogens and the significance of detecting virus in asymptomatic individuals. As a result, the burden of HRV infections may be overestimated in certain populations (Kieninger et al., 2013).",

Surveillance of 15 children ages 1\u20139 years over a 12-month period identified 20% of children with asymptomatic HRV infections over 1 year (Peltola et al., 2008, Brownlee and Turner, 2008, Greenberg, 2011). In children 3 months to 15 years old, incidence of symptomatic HRV was 6 infections per year (Winther et al., 2006). The incidence of asymptomatic HRV has not been reported in adult populations; however, the incidence of symptomatic HRV is estimated to be 2\u20133 infections per person per year (Madigan et al., 2003). Rates of asymptomatic HRV have varied in the literature, and direct comparisons are difficult because of differences in the study population (most populations observed are children), in the definition of an asymptomatic episode, and in the detection method utilized (Jartti et al., 2004, Johnston et al., 1993, Kusel et al., 2006, Mackay, 2008, Nokoso-Koivisto et al., 2002, Peltola et al., 2008, van Benten et al., 2003, Winther et al., 2006). We sought to detect and characterize asymptomatic and symptomatic HRVs in a cohort of university students enrolled in a clinical trial of vitamin D.",

Interestingly, when we investigated a cohort of hospitalized children with respiratory illness during the same time frame, we identified a higher proportion of HRV-C (Granados, 2012). The lower number of HRV-Cs identified in our student cohort may indicate that HRV-C infections are more common in children than in healthy adults, as previously suggested by Bochkov and Gern (2012). In our study, HRV-B was identified at a higher frequency than has been previously reported (Watanabe et al., 2010, Xiang et al., 2010). In 271 adults presenting with URTI, 25% were infected with HRV-B and HRV-C and had a lower percentage of URTI symptoms compared to HRV-A (\u03c72\n = 7.18; P\n < 0.05) (Xiang et al., 2010).

Our study period only looked at September and October when HRV is most frequently detected in North America. To accurately estimate the annual rate of asymptomatic HRV incidence, surveillance throughout the year would need to be conducted. We utilized an absolute quantitation method to determine the amount of virus. Differences in methodology and imprecision among any quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) assay make direct comparisons between reports difficult to conduct unless digital qPCR is conducted. While previous studies have shown that self-sampling with flocked nasal swabs has consistent quality, our viral load results should not be directly compared with previous studies (Smieja et al., 2010). The identification of symptoms is subjective, and there is a risk that some students had such minimal symptoms that they did not perceive and report any, whereas others may have low tolerance and would report symptoms. In order to minimize reporting bias, all participants were required to submit self-collected nasal swabs weekly regardless of symptom status as it became a weekly activity. Additionally, during the weekly visits, study staff could confirm that any symptoms were properly recorded.",
