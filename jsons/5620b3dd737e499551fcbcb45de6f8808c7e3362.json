In those places where the pandemic has had the greatest effect, it is of paramount importance for most patients to be at home, reducing or postponing their attendance at clinics, as well as avoiding surgeries. In this scenario, neoadjuvant endocrine treatment could be an appropriate alternative treatment for hormone receptor positive breast cancer (luminal-like tumours) in order to minimise hospital admissions and to delay elective surgeries. Accordingly, we present a simple protocol that can be applied to most cases of luminal-like breast cancer and is appropriate for the majority of secondary or tertiary medical centres, or even primary care.",

It has many advantages: tumour and axillary downstaging-which allows for less extensive surgery, and therefore higher rates of breast conservation; assessment of in vivo response, permitting real-time evaluation of drug efficacy as well as the biological and molecular changes that can occur; and, finally, it provides an opportunity for testing new drugs, either individually or in combination.

Evidence for supporting this approach is quite strong. Robust (although relatively small) trial data show preoperative endocrine treatment to be a safe option when compared to chemotherapy [4] [5] [6] , with significantly lower toxicity. The rates of breast conserving surgery increase clearly with NET, reaching 60%-80% [7] [8] [9] . It should be noted that pathological complete response rates are quite low [1] (as with chemotherapy), although this does not appear to influence prognosis as much as happens with non-luminal tumours. Even so, it is possible to establish a clinical prognosis based on the degree of the response. This was described by Ellis et al [10] , after the results of the P024 study. They developed a prognostic model (Preoperative Endocrine Prognostic Index (PEPI) score) incorporating standard pathological staging variables and 'on-treatment' biomarker values, thereby establishing three risk groups [10] . Consequently, patients with a low PEPI score do not benefit from chemotherapy.",

It is well known that those cases with a strong ER expression (Allred scores 7-8) usually show more responsiveness. However, the intensity of ER positivity does not always reflect a good outcome to be derived from hormonal treatment. Other parameters, such as progesterone receptor expression, as well as changes produced in Ki67, also play a role in predicting responsiveness [11] [12] [13] [14] . Performing biopsies a few weeks after starting the treatment provides information about possible resistance, especially in those cases where Ki67 is not reduced [13, [15] [16] [17] . Thus, NET offers an opportunity for investigating new biomarkers that may indicate a greater risk of resistance [18] .",

It usually consists of clinical exploration and ultrasound, following RECIST criteria, every 2 or 3 months. Exceptionally, MRI is employed, mostly in cases where an ultrasound follow-up is difficult or with some lobular breast cancers. If a reduction in tumour size is detected, treatment is maintained until maximum size reduction is achieved (usually in 6-12 months), after which surgery is generally performed.

In regular conditions, this can be suspected if Ki67 levels do not fall significantly after a few weeks of treatment; however, in this epidemiological emergency, repeating biopsies is probably unnecessary and ultrasound monitoring should provide a sufficient means for evaluating NET response. In any case, little harm is to be derived from treating a resistant tumour for 2 or 3 months and encountering such resistance can enable us to find a better approach later.",
