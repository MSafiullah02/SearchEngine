Methods and Results: A total of four candidate time-dependent dose-response models were fitted to four survival data sets for animals (mice or ferrets) exposed to graded doses of HPAI H5N1 virus using the maximum-likelihood estimation. A beta-Poisson dose-response model with the N 50 parameter modified by an exponential-inverse-power time dependency or an exponential doseresponse model with the k parameter modified by an exponential-inverse time dependency provided a statistically adequate fit to the observed survival data. Conclusions: We have successfully developed the time-dependent doseresponse models to describe the mortality of animals exposed to an HPAI H5N1 virus. The developed model describes the mortality over time and represents observed experimental responses accurately. Significance and Impact of the Study: This is the first study describing timedependent dose-response models for HPAI H5N1 virus. The developed models will be a useful tool for estimating the mortality of HPAI H5N1 virus, which may depend on time postexposure, for the preparation of a future influenza pandemic caused by this lethal virus.",

            "text": "Influenza A viruses are members of the family Orthomyxoviridae, which comprises enveloped viruses with segmented, negative-sense RNA genomes (Wright et al. 2007 ). Based on the antigenicity of the two surface glycoproteins, hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA), influenza A viruses are currently divided into 16 HA and 9 NA subtypes, designated as H1-H16 and N1-N9. Over the past century, only viruses of the H1N1, H2N2, H3N2 and H1N2 subtypes have circulated in humans (Wright et al. 2007) . Highly pathogenic avian influenza A (HPAI) of the H5N1 subtype viruses cause severe disease in humans, characterized by rapidly progressive pneumonia, multiorgan dysfunction and high mortality rate of more than 50% (Neumann et al. 2010) . Since 2003, they have spread across large parts of the globe and continued to cause sporadic human infections. Although HPAI H5N1 viruses fortunately have not acquired the ability for efficient infection in and transmission between humans, statistical evidence of human-to-human transmission has been obtained from epidemiological studies (Yang et al. 2007) , suggesting the potential to acquire the ability of sustained human-to-human transmission. To prepare for the worst (namely, the occurrence of an influenza pandemic by this lethal virus), it is essential to evaluate the infectivity and pathogenicity of HPAI H5N1 virus.",

An essential step in the QMRA process is dose-response assessment (Haas et al. 1999) . Dose-response relationships have been investigated for many types of pathogens, e.g. Escherichia coli O157:H7, rotavirus, Cryptosporidium parvum (Haas et al. 1993 (Haas et al. , 2000 Teunis et al. 2002) , by predicting the response from exposure to a given dose. Recently, the time-dependent dose-response models have been developed for improving postexposure decision-making and \u2044 or for estimating exposure time for a point-source outbreak, and they were proposed as an advanced approach for future QMRA frameworks (Huang and Haas 2009a; Huang et al. 2009b) . As the mortality of humans infected with HPAI H5N1 virus is dependent on the days postexposure, based on the clinical observations (Liem et al. 2009 ), it is desirable to utilize time-dependent dose-response model for assessing and characterizing the risks of HPAI H5N1 virus infection to humans. However, to date, none of the prior studies investigated the dose-response relationship to describe HPAI H5N1 virus infection.",

For data set nos. 1 and 2, the four-parameter beta-Poisson model with exponentialinverse-power DPI dependency (Eqn 6b in Table 2 ) proved to be the best-fit model among the candidate models with the lowest minimized deviances and gave a statistically significant improvement in fit over the twoor three-parameter models by reducing the deviance by more than v 2 0:95;2 or v 2 0:95;1 , respectively (Table 3 ). In contrast, the two-parameter exponential with exponentialinverse DPI dependency (eqn 3b in Table 2 ), the simplest model among the four candidate models, was judged to be the best-fit model for data set no. 3 and 4 (Table 3) .",

This is partly because there are no data sets describing human challenge with wildtype HPAI H5N1 virus because of its high mortality. This situation seems common to other pathogens with a high virulence, such as SARS coronavirus (Watanabe et al. 2010) . Prior microbial dose-response studies on several pathogens, however, have demonstrated that data from animal experiments provide reasonable estimates for human susceptibility (Haas et al. 2000; Armstrong and Haas 2007; Bartrand et al. 2008) . Mice have also been widely used as mammalian models to study the pathogenesis of HPAI H5N1 virus; a major advantage of this model is that infection experiments can be performed with large groups of animals, because of the relatively low cost and easy husbandry, to achieve statistical significance (Belser et al. 2009 ). Katz et al. (2000a) reported that H5N1-infected mice exhibited inflammatory cell infiltration that is also observed for human fatal cases associated with HPAI H5N1 virus infection (de Jong 2008) . Ferrets are excellent model to study the pathogenesis and transmissibility of influenza viruses because their clinical symptoms following influenza virus infection are similar to those of humans (Zitzow et al. 2002; Belser et al. 2009 ).",

In the present study, we constructed candidate time-dependent models by incorporating time factor into the exponential or the beta-Poisson model (Table 2) , because it is reasonable to assume the random distribution of HPAI H5N1 virus.
