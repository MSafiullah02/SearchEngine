            "text": "Adenoviruses have been developed as cancer therapeutics using two major strategies. Initially, mutants with deletions in one or more critical viral genes (e.g., E1, E4) were constructed as replication-incompetent vehicles to deliver therapeutic genes including tumor-suppressor genes, prodrug-activating enzymes, or cytokines.1,2,3 Adenoviruses expressing p53 were demonstrated to have selective antitumoral effects, including cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Of note, replacement of p53 alone was enough to kill tumor cells with a great number of genetic alterations. Subsequently, adenoviruses were engineered to replicate selectively within cancers.4 The original approach proposed by McCormick was to delete the E1B\u201355 kDa gene.5 This gene product was known to bind p53 (in complex with E4orf6), leading to p53 inhibition and/or degradation. The theory was that E1B\u201355 kDa\u2013deleted adenoviruses such as dl1520 (later designated Onyx-015) would not be able to inactivate p53 in normal cells and, as a result, the viral replication cycle would not be completed. In cancer cells lacking normal p53 function, however, replication was predicted to proceed. Subsequently, other gene deletion mutants were evaluated to target tumor cells lacking G1\u2013S checkpoint control and/or loss of pRB function.6,7 A subsequent approach to emerge was construction of replication-selective adenoviruses by placing the expression of E1A under control of tumor/tissue\u2013specific promoters.8,9,10 This approach has been used with PSA, E2F, AFP, and other promoters.",

Head and neck cancers11 and localized lung3 or prostate12 cancers were evaluated extensively. Once safety and gene expression or replication was demonstrated with i.t. injection, e.g., with dl1520, intraperitoneal (i.p.) injections were performed in patients with ovarian carcinoma.13 After safety and feasibility of i.p. delivery to ovarian cancer patients were demonstrated, intravascular administration was contemplated. However, the feasibility of vascular delivery to tumors in the face of innate immunity and neutralizing antibodies was unknown. The dose-limiting toxicity in mice was typically hepatotoxicity with adenovirus vectors.14 Finally, the tragic death of a patient on an adenoviral gene therapy trial for ornithine transcarbamylase (OTC) deficiency at the University of Pennsylvania eventually raised serious concerns about the safety of intravascular adenovirus administration and led to numerous trials in the US and Europe being put on hold.15,16,17,18 We summarize publicly disclosed and/or published data on clinical trials of intravascular adenovirus in cancer patients.",

The virus contains a deletion between nucleotides 2496 and 3323 in the E1B region encoding the 55-kDa protein. In addition, a C-to-T transition at position 2022 in E1B generates a stop codon at the third codon position of the protein. These alterations eliminate expression of the E1B\u201355 kDa gene in Onyx-015\u2013infected cells. Because E1B\u201355 kDa binds to and inactivates the p53 tumor-suppressor gene product, this mutant should theoretically be unable to overcome the p53-mediated blockade of viral replication in a normal cell.20 In a tumor cell lacking p53 function, in contrast, the E1B\u201355 kDa protein should be expendable for p53 inhibition and replication should proceed.21 Initial studies demonstrated p53-dependent selectivity in matched cells with and without dominant-negative p53. Normal cells were subsequently shown to be relatively resistant to the effects of the virus. Publications from preclinical studies with different cell systems and/or endpoints have reported both supportive data regarding the original McCormick hypothesis and data that seemed to contradict it.20,21,22,23,24,25 At least some of the confusion can be attributed to the fact that many tumor cell lines with wild-type p53 genomes actually do not have normal p53 function.26 For example, loss of p14arf can lead to loss of p53 induction; replacement of p14arf was able to restore resistance to the virus in one cell line.",

The cellular changes induced by viral infection are often strikingly similar to the cellular changes acquired during carcinogenesis (e.g., p53 tumor-suppressor protein inactivation, inhibition of apoptosis). Given this genetic convergence, it is not surprising that many viruses inherently grow preferentially in tumor cells and/or that viruses can be engineered for tumor selectivity. Five general mechanistic approaches to tumor-selective replication have been described to date. These include (a) the use of viruses with inherent tumor selectivity (e.g., NDV, reovirus, VSV, autonomous parvovirus);47 (b) deletion of entire genes (e.g., HSV, adenovirus)48 or (c) functional gene regions (e.g., adenovirus, poliovirus)6 that are necessary for efficient replication and/or toxicity in normal cells but are expendable in tumor cells; (d) engineering of tumor/tissue\u2013specific promoters into viruses to limit expression of gene(s) necessary for replication to cancer cells (e.g., adenovirus, HSV);8 and (e) modification of the viral coat to target uptake selectively to tumor cells (e.g., adenovirus, poliovirus).49,50",

Endogenous viral gene expression can be modified to enhance antitumoral potency; examples with adenovirus include reintroduction or overexpression of the adenovirus death protein,51 deletion of the E1B\u201319 kDa gene, or deletion of the E1A CR2 region.6 Viral replication within tumors can lead to induction of cytokines with antitumoral and antivascular properties, as well as tumor-specific CTL. Viruses can be \u201carmed\u201d to express exogenous therapeutic genes including cytokines or prodrug-activating enzymes.52 Finally, strategies to immunomodulate the host are being explored.
