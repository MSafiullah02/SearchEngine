            "text": "Our first line of defense against viral and bacterial attacks relies on the innate immune system, which detects non-self products by means of specific surface, endosomal or cytosolic receptors. For example, bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is sensed by Toll-like receptor (TLR)-4 on the cell surface, whereas viral RNA is sensed by endosomal TLR3 or cytosolic retinoid acid-inducible gene (RIG-I) [1]. A major output from these receptors is the activation of transcription factors belonging to the nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-\u03baB) and interferon (IFN) regulatory factor (IRF) family, which control the expression of multiple immune regulatory genes. In this review we will focus on p50/p65 NF-\u03baB and IRF3, whose activation involves specific members of the inhibitor of \u03baB (I\u03baB) kinase (IKK) family. The canonical IKKs, IKK\u03b1 and IKK\u03b2, form a complex with the adaptor protein NEMO (also known as IKK\u03b3), which has a regulatory role. This IKK complex is required for proper NF-\u03baB signaling in response to multiple proinflammatory stimuli such as TNF and TLR ligands. IKK\u03b1 and IKK\u03b2 are Ser/Thr kinases that phosphorylate the NF-\u03baB inhibitor protein I\u03baB\u03b1, resulting in its Lys48-linked polyubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation. This allows NF-\u03baB to translocate to the nucleus and bind to specific DNA elements [2]. IKK\u03b1 and IKK\u03b2 contain an N-terminal catalytic kinase domain (KD), a more central leucine zipper (LZ) and helix loop helix (HLH) domain, and a C-terminal NEMO-binding domain (NBD) (Fig. 1\n). The major impact of the IKKs on NF-\u03baB signaling inspired many researchers to search intensively for IKK-related kinases. Based on sequence similarities with IKK\u03b1 and IKK\u03b2, two IKK-related kinases, TANK binding kinase 1 (TBK1) and IKK\u025b (also known as IKK-inducible or IKK-i), were discovered. IKK\u025b and TBK1 are known as the non-canonical IKKs and expand the IKK family to four members [3], [4]. The kinase domain of IKK\u025b shares 33% and 31% amino acid identity with the corresponding domains in IKK\u03b1 and IKK\u03b2, respectively, and 67% with TBK1 [5]. Furthermore, TBK1 and IKK\u025b have a similar domain composition as the canonical IKKs. IKK\u03b2 and the non-canonical IKKs also share an ubiquitin-like domain (ULD), which is required for optimal kinase activity [6]. Importantly, IKK\u025b and TBK1 lack a NBD and do not interact with NEMO, but each forms similar complexes with other specific scaffolding proteins (see Section 4).",

            "text": "Although IKK\u025b and TBK1 were originally classified as IKKs based on their ability to phosphorylate I\u03baB\u03b1 upon overexpression, studies with IKK\u025b and TBK1 deficient cells revealed that these kinases are dispensable for I\u03baB\u03b1 phosphorylation [7], [8]. Instead, both kinases were shown to contribute to LPS- and virus-induced phosphorylation of IRF3 and IRF7, allowing their homodimerization, nuclear import, and activation of type I IFN genes (IFN-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b2) [9]. IKK\u025b and TBK1 are similar in their ability to activate IRF3 and IRF7 and their ability to phosphorylate the I\u03baB\u03b1 inhibitor of NF-\u03baB, but they present some differences that may be of importance. For instance, deletion of the TBK1 gene leads to embryonic lethality at day 15 due to TNF-induced apoptosis in the liver [7], whereas IKK\u025b deficient mice are viable [9]. The reason for these different phenotypes is still unclear but may in part reflect the differential expression and use of TBK1 and IKK\u025b in various cell types (see also section 2). Moreover, TBK1 and IKK\u025b may have nonredundant functions in other signaling pathways than those controlling IRF and canonical NF-\u03baB activity. For example, recently published work demonstrated a specific role for TBK1 as a negative regulator of non-canonical NF-\u03baB signaling in B cells stimulated with BAFF or anti-CD40, which was associated with the inducible TBK1 mediated phosphorylation of the kinase NIK, leading to its degradation [10]. Although B cells express both TBK1 and IKK\u025b, NIK phosphorylation was highly specific for TBK1. Since TBK1 and IKK\u025b share the same substrate consensus phosphorylation motif [11], substrate specificity is likely driven by recruitment of TBK1 or IKK\u025b to discrete signaling complexes, possibly involving specific scaffolding proteins (see Section 4). Given the ever-growing number of TBK1 and IKK\u025b interaction partners and substrates [12], localized kinase activation and substrate modification could be an effective strategy to confer TBK1 or IKK\u025b specific functions.",

            "text": "While IKK\u03b1, IKK\u03b2 and TBK1 are constitutively expressed in most cell types, basal IKK\u025b expression is only observed in specific tissues (pancreas, thymus and spleen) and cell types (T-cells and peripheral blood leukocytes). However, in other cell types (e.g. fibroblasts) IKK\u025b is rapidly upregulated by cytokines (e.g. TNF, IL-1, IL-6, IFN-\u03b3), microbial products (e.g. LPS, viral RNA), and phorbol esters (PMA), and has therefore also been called inducible IKK or IKK-i [12], [13]. The promoter of the IKK\u025b gene contains two putative NF-\u03baB binding sites, of which only one was shown to be functionally active [14], as well as seven STAT3-binding sites, of which two are active [15]. Whether the increase in IKK\u025b expression induces kinase activation is currently still unclear. Recently, two IKK\u025b splice variants, missing 25 amino acids (IKK\u025b-sv1) or 13 amino acids (IKK\u025b-sv2) at their C-terminal end, were detected in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells [16]. While these splice variants are ubiquitously expressed at the mRNA level, both protein isoforms are selectively upregulated by TNF stimulation or virus infection. IKK\u025b is frequently overexpressed in a number of human cancers, in particular breast, ovarian and pancreatic cancer and has been implicated in tumorigenesis (see Section 6). Although IKK\u025b and TBK1 show many overlapping activities that are relevant to innate immunity and inflammation, the more restricted expression of IKK\u025b is of particular interest. In this review we will therefore focus on IKK\u025b and mainly refer to TBK1 for reasons of comparison.",

            "text": "The identification of TBK1 and IKK\u025b as I\u03baB\u03b1 kinases has always been very controversial and the source of many debates. Evidence is based primarily on the observation that overexpression of IKK\u025b or TBK1 in cultured cells leads to phosphorylation of I\u03baB\u03b1, be it only at one phosphoacceptor site (Ser36 or Ser32, respectively), driving increased I\u03baB\u03b1 turnover [13]. However, both IKK\u025b and TBK1 deficient MEF cells display normal I\u03baB\u03b1 degradation in response to TNF, IL-1 or LPS, contradicting the overexpression data [7], [8]. Nevertheless, TNF-, IL-1- or LPS-induced NF-\u03baB dependent gene expression is abrogated in the absence of IKK\u025b [7], [8]. Therefore it is believed that IKK\u025b influences NF-\u03baB signaling and concomitant gene expression downstream of I\u03baB\u03b1 [12] (Fig. 2\n). In this context, several studies support a role for IKK\u025b-mediated Ser468 and Ser536 phosphorylation of the p65 NF-\u03baB subunit in the expression of a specific subset of NF-\u03baB target genes in response to pro-inflammatory signals and viral infection [12], [17], [18], [19]. It has also been shown that activated p65 (phosphorylated on Ser468 or Ser536) serves as a docking site to bring IKK\u025b-enzymatic activity to \u03baB-containing inflammatory gene promoters in the nucleus, enabling IKK\u025b to phosphorylate adjacent c-Jun and initiate nuclear receptor corepressor clearance [20]. These results suggest that p65-recruitment of IKK\u025b to promoters that exhibit AP1 and \u03baB sites in close proximity (e.g. inos, cxcl2, cxcl9, cxcl10, ccl4, tnfaip3) may regulate their activation by initiating corepressor turnover. Besides p65, IKK\u025b/TBK1 also targets c-Rel NF-\u03baB, leading to its nuclear accumulation and activation of NF-\u03baB dependent gene expression [21].",

            "text": "Next to their role in NF-\u03baB signaling, TBK1 and IKK\u025b are also implicated in IRF3 and IRF7 signaling in response to viral infection that is sensed by a diversity of receptors, such as TLR3 and RIG-I, leading to the production of type I IFNs [12] (Fig. 2). While IRF3 is constitutively expressed in the cytoplasm of many cells, IRF7 needs to be transcriptionally upregulated. Both IKK\u025b and TBK1 directly phosphorylate IRF3 and IRF7 at their C-termini, resulting in their homo- and heterodimerization and translocation to the nucleus. Mass spectrometry pinpointed Ser386, Ser396 and Ser402 in IRF3 as redundant phosphorylation sites for IKK\u025b upon viral infection of innate immune cells [22]. IKK\u025b deficient MEF cells showed no change in IRF3 activation [9], whereas TBK1 deficient MEF cells showed reduced IRF3 activation upon TLR3 and TLR4 triggering [9], [23], [24]. However, IRF3 activation was completely abolished in TBK1 and IKK\u025b double deficient MEFs [9]. IKK\u025b overexpression, but not its kinase dead mutant, could restore IRF3 activation in TBK1 deficient cells, suggesting redundancy between both kinases [24]. Although IKK\u025b and TBK1 seem to exert overlapping functions in IRF3 activation, mechanistic differences in the activation of TBK1 and IKK\u025b following virus infection have been observed (e.g. mitochondrial localization of IKK\u025b versus cytoplasmic localization of TBK1) [25]. Moreover, partially different substrates have been reported for both kinases. It is interesting to note that the TLR adaptor protein MyD88 was recently shown to abrogate TLR3-induced IFN production by preventing IKK\u025b but not TBK1-mediated IRF3 phosphorylation [25], indicating that both kinases can also be differentially regulated.",

Receptor stimulation induces the recruitment of specific adaptor proteins to the receptor (TRIF for TLR3 and TLR4, MAVS for RIG-I). Subsequently, these adaptors interact with the E3 ubiquitin ligase TRAF3 to activate IRF3, or with the E3 ubiquitin ligase TRAF6 and RIP1 kinase to activate NF-\u03baB. Autoubiquitination of TRAF3 is needed for the recruitment and activation of IKK\u025b and TBK1 [28]. At later time points, the presence of IKK\u025b in the MAVS complex eventually leads to the release of TRAF3, with the shutdown of IFN signaling as a consequence [29].",

Although overexpression studies indicated a role for autophosphorylation of IKK\u025b/TBK1 at Ser172 [13], [31], activation of the endogenous kinases does not only involve autophosphorylation. Indeed, cells treated with the TBK1 and IKK\u025b inhibitor BX795 still showed phosphorylation of TBK1 and IKK\u025b at Ser172 in response to poly(I:C), LPS, TNF and IL-1 [32], suggesting the involvement of other kinases. Clark and co-workers could show that Ser172 phosphorylation of IKK\u025b/TBK1 is impaired in IKK\u03b1 deficient cells treated with an IKK\u025b inhibitor [31], indicating IKK\u03b1 as a potential IKK\u025b kinase. In line with these observations, TNF-induced activation of IKK\u025b/TBK1 seems to be mediated solely by the canonical IKKs [31]. Interestingly, IKK\u025b/TBK1 activation by the canonical IKK pathway only results in NF-\u03baB activation and not IRF3 activation.",

Interestingly, this negative regulation of the canonical IKKs by IKK\u025b/TBK1 was impaired in TANK-deficient macrophages [36]. Using these cells it was also shown that TANK is required for IKK\u025b/TBK1 and NF-\u03baB activation in response to LPS via both the MyD88- and TRIF-dependent pathways, and mediates the interaction of the non-canonical IKKs with the canonical IKKs. The latter most likely involves the binding of TANK to the canonical IKK adaptor protein NEMO [37].

For example, the deubiquitinase DUBA reverses TRAF3 ubiquitination, disconnecting TRAF3 from its substrates TBK1 and IKK\u025b [38]. Also the deubiquitinase CYLD negatively regulates RIG-I induced interferon production by deubiquitinating RIG-I and TBK1/IKK\u025b [39], [40]. Conversely, IKK\u025b directly phosphorylates CYLD at Ser418, hereby decreasing its deubiquitinating potential but increasing the IKK\u025b-induced cell transformation [41] (Fig. 3\n) (see Section 6). Others have shown that the ubiquitin-editing enzyme A20, in conjunction with Tax1 binding protein 1 (TAX1BP1), antagonizes Lys63-polyubiquitination of TBK1 and IKK\u025b. Surprisingly, A20-mediated inhibition of TBK1/IKK\u025b Lys63-polyubiquitination was independent of its DUB function [42]. Recently, the E3 ubiquitin ligases TRIP and DTX4 have been shown to negatively regulate IRF3 activation by inducing TBK1 Lys48-polyubiquitination and proteosomal degradation [43], [44]. DTX4 showed weak or no activity against IKK\u025b, while the activity of TRIP against IKK\u025b was not studied. Interestingly, also many viruses themselves interfere with the IRF pathway and antiviral IFN production at the level of IKK\u025b and/or TBK1. For example, specific viral components disturb the interaction of IKK\u025b/TBK1 with other signaling proteins (e.g. Ebola virus VP35 protein [45], M protein of Corona virus [46], Hepatitis B or C virus [47], [48]). Alternatively, viral proteins may act as alternative substrates for IKK\u025b and TBK1, thereby targeting these kinases for degradation (e.g. Borna disease virus P protein, paramyxovirus V proteins [49], [50]). These virus adaptations further emphasize the importance of the non-canonical kinases in antiviral signaling.",

Further supporting a major contribution of IKK\u025b to the pathogenesis of RA is the finding that mice deficient in IKK\u025b show less synovial inflammation in a passive K/BxN arthritis model due to lower expression of inflammatory mediators [51]. Furthermore, IKK\u025b single nucleotide polymorphisms have been associated with the early stages of RA [54], and genome wide associated studies revealed IKK\u025b as a susceptibility locus for systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), in which type I IFNs play a crucial role [55].

In this context, IKK\u025b deficient mice showed fewer infiltrating neutrophils and diminished expression of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines after intranasal administration of IL-17. Surprisingly, in this model IKK\u025b deficiency did not affect NF-\u03baB activation, but did reduce MAP kinase signaling [57]. More specifically, IKK\u025b was shown to be responsible for phosphorylation of the IL-17 receptor adaptor Act-1, thereby activating the TRAF2/TRAF5 pathway leading to increased MAP kinase activation and leaving the TRAF6/NF-\u03baB axis emanating from Act-1 undisturbed. Increased MAP kinase activation led to increased chemokine mRNA stability, contributing to increased chemokine production and neutrophil infiltration into the lungs. A role for IKK\u025b in the regulation of IL-17 responses is also illustrated by the recent finding that IKK\u025b can promote the AKT-mTOR signaling pathway, which mediates IL-1 induced Th17 maintenance, by phosphorylating and inactivating GSK3\u03b1 [58]. Taken together, many studies indicate an important role of IKK\u025b in the pathophysiology of inflammatory diseases, mainly by regulating NF-\u03baB, IFN and IL-17 responses.",

At the same time, the provoked NF-\u03baB activation in nociceptive neurons (neurons involved in perception of pain) was reduced, as reflected by lower inflammatory gene expression.

Obese mice have major risks to develop inflammatory or metabolic diseases such as type 2 diabetes [60]. In fact, obesity mimics a permanent low-grade inflammatory condition due to dietary fatty acid recognition by TLR4 [61] or hypoxia [62]. Elevated NF-\u03baB activity in obese mice drives increased IKK\u025b expression in the liver, adipocytes and adipose tissue macrophages [63], [64]. Furthermore, mice deficient in IKK\u025b were found to be protected from high fat diet-induced obesity and showed less chronic liver inflammation, hepatic steatosis and insulin resistance. These events are regulated by changes in the expression of regulatory proteins and enzymes that are involved in glucose and lipid metabolism, and by a decrease in the production of proinflammatory cytokines and proteins involved in insulin resistance. Transfection of cultured adipocytes and hepatoma cells with IKK\u025b induced similar changes, suggesting a direct role for IKK\u025b in the regulation of hepatic inflammation. However, contradictory results were reported by another group, showing no difference between IKK\u025b knockout and wild type mice in a model of high fat diet-induced obesity and insulin resistance [65]. Therefore, more work is needed to define the precise role of IKK\u025b in the development of metabolic diseases.",

            "text": "IKK\u025b has been associated with the initiation and progression of multiple cancers and might function as an oncogene for malignant transformation. For instance, several breast cancer cell lines and \u223c30% of primary human breast tumors express high levels of IKK\u025b [66]. Increased IKK\u025b expression is due to an up till now unknown mutation regulating IKK\u025b transcript levels or to an amplification of the 1q32 region comprising the IKBKE locus [67], [68]. Ectopic expression of IKK\u025b in immortalized mammary epithelial cells at levels found in human cancer cells renders them tumorigenic, confirming that the allele amplified in breast cancer specimens is transforming [67]. High IKK\u025b expression is often associated with the accumulation of c-Rel and p65 NF-\u03baB subunits in the nucleus (e.g. in primary breast tumors), and IKK\u025b silencing in several breast cancer cell lines was shown to reduce NF-\u03baB activation and cell proliferation [69]. Similarly, introducing a kinase inactive IKK\u025b mutant (IKK\u025b K38A) in breast cancer cells, which exerts a dominant negative effect on endogenous IKK\u025b, reduced NF-\u03baB dependent gene expression (e.g. cyclin D1 and RelB) [70], demonstrating the necessity of IKK\u025b catalytic activity. Recently, this was further confirmed by demonstrating the requirement of IKK\u025b-mediated phosphorylation at Ser418 of the tumor suppressor CYLD, which prevents its deubiquitinating activity on NF-\u03baB signaling proteins such as TRAF2 and NEMO [41], [71] (Fig. 3). Moreover, IKK\u025b also activates the E3 ubiquitin ligase TRAF2 by direct phosphorylation at Ser11, resulting in increased TRAF2 ubiquitination [71]. Together these events lead to enhanced NF-\u03baB activation, which promotes survival, transformation and proliferation of mammary epithelial cells (Fig. 3). Furthermore, IKK\u025b (as well as TBK1) may contribute to enhanced NF-\u03baB activity and tumorigenesis by directly phosphorylating NF-\u03baB p65 (as described above) or by phosphorylating Akt, which then phosphorylates and activates p65 [72], [73]. In addition, elevated IKK\u025b levels are also associated with STAT1 activation in different primary tumors and cell lines derived from a diversity of cancers, like lung and breast carcinoma [15], [74], [75], which may also contribute to the oncogenic activities of IKK\u025b. As IRF3 suppression did not affect IKK\u025b-induced cell transformation, the oncogenic potential of IKK\u025b seems to be independent of its IRF3 signaling function [67].",

This is also the case for elevated NF-\u03baB activation, which is known to contribute to cancer cell survival and to reduce sensitivity to chemotherapeutic agents and ionizing radiation [84]. Unfortunately, breast cancer cells in which IKK\u025b was inactivated retained their resistance to chemotherapeutics despite a lowered NF-\u03baB activation, suggesting that additional mechanisms must be involved in the regulation of cell death [69], [77], [85]. Finally, IKK\u025b also accumulates in subnuclear promyelocytic leukemia (PML) bodies upon genotoxic stress, where it undergoes SUMOylation, leading to its activation and ultimately resulting in NF-\u03baB mediated anti-apoptotic responses [86]. In this respect, it is worthwhile to mention that several glioma cell lines and human primary glioma tissues exhibit elevated levels of IKK\u025b and are less sensitive to DNA damage-induced apoptosis [87]. Suppression of IKK\u025b, however, renders the cells more sensitive, confirming its prosurvival function.",

So far, only few small molecule inhibitors of IKK\u025b have been described. BX-795 was the first IKK\u025b inhibitor on the market and suppresses TBK1 and IKK\u025b activity at nanomolar concentrations in vitro [32]. The specificity of BX-795 is however an issue since it was originally developed as an inhibitor of 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase 1 (PDK1) and only later found to also inhibit IKK\u025b [88]. Moreover, BX-795 shows off-target effects towards several other kinases, including JNK and p38 MAP kinases [31], [32]. A modified version of BX-795, MRT67307, no longer inhibits JNK or p38 MAP kinases, but still interferes with the activity of TBK1 and PDK1 [31], [32]. More recently, a series of azabenzimidole derivatives and 2,4-diamino-5-cyclopropyl pyrimidines with improved kinase selectivity and drug-like properties were described [88], [89]. However, these compounds still inhibit both IKK\u025b and TBK1, with a slightly higher potency against TBK1. In mice, the pyrimidines significantly inhibited LPS-induced release of IFN-\u03b2, although toxicity was observed at higher doses [88], [89]. It is worth mentioning that also a number of naturally occurring compounds (polyphenoles such as (\u2212)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate, lutolin, quercetin) with anti-inflammatory properties have been shown to target TBK1 [90], [91]. Activities against IKK\u025b have not been described, but in general the specificity of these polyphenoles is low and most of them have multiple targets.",

These studies demonstrated that the consensus phosphorylation motif of IKK\u025b differs from that of IKK\u03b2, but is identical to that of TBK1, suggesting that the development of IKK\u025b inhibitors that do not target TBK1 may be very difficult. Nevertheless, high-throughput screening using a specific IKK\u025b/TBK1 substrate peptide resulted in several lead molecules that showed selectivity for either IKK\u025b or TBK1 [11]. However, as IKK\u025b and TBK1 show many overlapping functions in oncogenic and inflammatory signaling pathways, it is likely that the therapeutic effectiveness of IKK\u025b specific inhibitors may be hampered by the redundant activity of TBK1. Therefore, at least in some cases inhibition of the activity of both kinases may be a better therapeutic approach. Finally, as overexpression of IKK\u025b is linked with tumorigenesis, therapeutic approaches that would reduce IKK\u025b expression to normal levels may be a valid alternative. Therefore, more fundamental research on the molecular mechanisms that regulate IKK\u025b expression may further boost the development of IKK\u025b targeting drugs.",

            "text": "The potential value of IKK\u025b as therapeutic target for anti-inflammatory or anti-cancer therapies requires further investigation into the mechanisms and pathways involved. The pharmaceutical industry has been very active in the development of IKK\u03b1/IKK\u03b2 inhibitors as novel anti-inflammatory agents, but so far with limited success. Since NF-\u03baB mediates a number of physiological functions, non-selective and complete inhibition of the NF-\u03baB pathway may lead to serious side-effects. This is also illustrated by the fact that p65-, IKK\u03b1-, IKK\u03b2-, or NEMO-deficient mice die during embryonic development or perinatally. Compounds that more selectively repress the activation of NF-\u03baB in response to specific receptors or the expression of only a specific subset of NF-\u03baB dependent genes would be associated with fewer side effects. Therefore, IKK\u025b could well be such a target with great clinical value. This is supported by the fact that IKK\u025b knockout mice, in contrast to IKK\u03b1 or IKK\u03b2 knockout mice, are viable and fertile. Since TBK1 knockout mice also die embryonically, the challenge will be to develop IKK\u025b specific inhibitors that do not target TBK1. In this context, it will also be important to further determine the relative contribution of IKK\u025b and TBK1 in different pathways (e.g. NF-\u03baB versus IRF) and pathophysiological processes. Modulation of IKK\u025b or TBK1 expression and activity in distinct cell types or tissues by means of conditional knockout mice will therefore be of high value. In addition, knowledge of the different IKK\u025b substrates and the physiological relevance of their phosphorylation may help to predict efficiency or side effects of IKK\u025b inhibitors.",

            "text": "The relationship between the canonical and non-canonical IKKs, and other signaling pathways, is also an open line of investigation. In particular the negative regulatory effect of IKK\u025b/TBK1 on the canonical IKKs could suggest that inhibition of IKK\u025b/TBK1 may actually have a pro-inflammatory effect. In this context, a more detailed understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in the counter-regulation in the IKK family could be helpful. Many of the players that are involved (e.g. TANK, NEMO) in the connection between IKK and IKK-related kinases are phosphorylated or modified by different types of ubiquitin chains, but the consequence of these modifications is not fully clear. IKK\u025b is also believed to form distinct complexes with different adaptor proteins (TANK, NAP1, SINTBAD), which could perform different functions. Future studies on the existence and function of IKK\u025b complexes consisting of distinct IKK\u025b adaptor proteins are therefore of high interest as it may allow more selective IKK\u025b targeting. Such studies may also help to explain why some stimuli (e.g. TNF, IL-1, IL-17) activate IKK\u025b/TBK1 without inducing the phosphorylation of IRF3, whereas other stimuli (e.g. LPS, viral RNA) do activate this pathway via IKK\u025b/TBK1. The strong inducibility of IKK\u025b expression and its overexpression in multiple tumors is also worthwhile to examine. What are the upstream signals that can regulate IKK\u025b expression? What determines IKK\u025b stability? Is IKK\u025b overexpression sufficient to be oncogenic? In this context, generating (e.g. mammary) tissue specific IKK\u025b transgenic mice may be very informative.",

Non-canonical IKKs (IKK\u025b and TBK1) can be activated by two signaling pathways: (1) IKK\u03b1/\u03b2 mediated activation of IKK\u025b/TBK1. Ligand binding to several receptors (TNF-R1, IL-1R, TLR4, RIG-I) initiates the recruitment of specific adaptor proteins (e.g. Mal, MyD88, TRAM, TRIF, MAVS), E3 ubiquitin ligases and kinases (not shown) to the receptor, eventually resulting in the activation of the canonical IKK (IKK\u03b1/IKK\u03b2/NEMO) complex. This leads to the IKK\u03b2-mediated phosphorylation and subsequent Lys48-linked polyubiquitination of I\u03baB\u03b1, resulting in its proteasomal degradation and release of the p50\u2013p65 NF-\u03baB heterodimer, which then translocates to the nucleus. (2) IKK\u03b1/IKK\u03b2-independent and TRAF3-dependent IKK\u025b/TBK1 autoactivation. TRIF-dependent TLR3 and TLR4 signaling, as well as MAVS-dependent RIG-I signaling, induce IKK\u025b/TBK1 autoactivation via TRAF3. This also requires the binding of IKK\u025b/TBK1 to different scaffold proteins (TANK, NAP1, SINTBAD). IKK\u025b/TBK1 then mediate different activities: (A) IKK\u025b/TBK1 can phosphorylate NF-\u03baB (p65), contributing to NF-\u03baB dependent expression of specific genes. (B) IKK\u025b/TBK1 can phosphorylate IRF3 (and IRF7; not shown), leading to its homodimerization and nuclear translocation. (C) IKK\u025b/TBK1 can phosphorylate c-jun, leading to the release of the nuclear repressor complex (NCoR). (D) IKK\u025b/TBK1 can phosphorylate their own scaffold proteins (TANK, NAP1 or SINTBAD), the function of which is still unclear. (E) IKK\u025b/TBK1 is also able to phosphorylate the canonical IKKs, leading to their inactivation.",

Overexpression of IKK\u025b in tumor cells induces cell survival, cell transformation and proliferation by different mechanisms involving IKK\u025b mediated phosphorylation of specific substrates. IKK\u025b can either directly or indirectly (via Akt phosphorylation and activation) phosphorylate NF-\u03baB (p65), leading to increased NF-\u03baB dependent gene expression. IKK\u025b also phosphorylates and inactivates the tumor suppressor CYLD, preventing CYLD from deubiquitinating specific substrates in the NF-\u03baB signaling pathway. In addition, phosphorylation of TRAF2 activates its E3 ubiquitin ligase activity. Both CYLD and TRAF2 phosphorylation thus increase ubiquitin-dependent NF-\u03baB signaling. IKK\u025b also directly phosphorylates STAT1, increasing its gene activating potential.",
