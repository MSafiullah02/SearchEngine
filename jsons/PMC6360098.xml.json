In children from Madison, Wisconsin, virus-positive weeks were associated with greater asthma symptoms, as well as more frequent loss of asthma control.[19], [20] In a community cohort of children with asthma from Randrick, Australia (a suburb of Sydney), RV was detected in 25.5% of nasal samples and associated with increased cough, phlegm, wheeze, and chest tightness.[21], [22] No change in peak expiratory flow (PEF) or forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) was seen. However, effects of natural respiratory viral infections on lung function and symptoms in urban children with asthma remain largely undefined. Patterns of viral respiratory illnesses may differ between urban and suburban children. For example, sick inner-city infants have lower rates of viral detection than suburban infants.23 In addition, asthma is undertreated in urban children,24 which may amplify the effects of viral infection. Finally, whereas we25 and others[26], [27], [28], [29] have examined nasal cytokine responses of children with asthma to natural colds, potential effects of asymptomatic or mild viral infections have not been studied.",

The questionnaire asked about demographic information, symptoms, and whether their child had ever been diagnosed by a medical care provider with any of the following conditions: asthma, bronchitis, bronchiolitis, reactive airways disease, or pneumonia. Parents also were asked whether their child had taken prescription medication for these conditions. Classification of asthma severity was based on symptom frequency and reported inhaled steroid use (eTable 1). Children were classified as atopic if they reported having hay fever, nasal allergies, or eczema. This study was approved by the University of Michigan IRB (ID# HUM00018442).",

In addition, samples from children with more severe colds were more likely to have detectable levels of TLR3 mRNA (Fig 2B). Samples from children with mild and asymptomatic viral infections also showed significant increases in some nasal aspirate biomarkers, albeit fewer biomarkers than samples from more severe colds (Fig 2A, 2C). Samples from children with asymptomatic infections showed higher nasal CXCL10 mRNA and CCL20 protein expression, suggesting persistence of these cytokines after resolution of symptoms. Children with mild colds and asymptomatic infections, but not those with severe colds, also showed an increase in the number of aspirates positive for IFN-\u03bb mRNA (Fig 2B). Finally, and unexpectedly, symptomatic virus-negative illnesses showed no significant increases in nasal biomarkers except for CXCL10 protein. When we re-examined data, restricting our analysis to children with persistent asthma (either mild or moderate-to-severe), nearly identical results were obtained, except that samples from all 3 virus-positive groups showed significant increases in IFN-\u03bb compared with the virus-negative, asymptomatic condition (not shown).",

We hypothesized that children with high-symptom severe colds have greater airflow obstruction, respiratory tract inflammation, and viral copy number than those with milder colds and asymptomatic infections, as well as virus-negative conditions. In contrast to children from a suburban setting,22 high-symptom viral infections were associated with reduced small airway function, as evidenced by changes in FEF25%-75%. Compared with the virus-negative asymptomatic condition, children with severe colds showed elevations of nasal mRNA and protein biomarkers. Children with mild and asymptomatic infections showed fewer elevations. We found associations between viral load and nasal aspirate levels of chemokines, which together attract neutrophils and monocytes to the airways, but not those that promote eosinophil chemotaxis and allergic airways disease. This is the first study to correlate viral load and respiratory tract cytokine levels during natural colds. Finally, urban children with asthma experienced many virus-negative symptomatic illnesses, which were associated with increased exhaled nitric oxide but not reduced airway function or elevated nasal biomarkers.",

The high rate of viral detection during surveillance periods is consistent with previous studies in well children with asthma[1], [2], [3], [4] and is unlikely to be attributable to false positives, because RV detection was confirmed by amplification and sequencing of gel-purified PCR products in 92% of cases. Conversely, we believe the low viral detection rate during symptomatic episodes can be explained by the fact that samples were not collected in the fall and instead were only collected from January to August, when rhinovirus infections are less prevalent. The low symptom threshold for \u201csick\u201d sample collection and financial reimbursement for each sick period assessment, which offset time and effort needed to participate, could also have contributed to a low viral detection rate. While our rate of viral detection is lower than reported previously,[1], [2] it is consistent with the lower frequency of viral detection in urban children with respiratory illnesses compared with suburban children.23 Finally, our data indicate that urban children with asthma experience frequent virus-negative upper respiratory tract illnesses. Cold-like illnesses were unlikely to represent false-negative viral infections, because they were unaccompanied by reduced pulmonary function or increases in nasal aspirate MDA5, a double-stranded RNA pattern recognition receptor that was increased in virus-positive samples and has been shown to be induced after RV infection.35 Finally, when we retested a subset of our initial multiplex PCR viral detection results using standard RV qPCR, we found a false-negative rate of only 3%. As in previous studies,[23], [30] RV was the most common virus detected, and overall, inner-city infants had low rates of viral detection. However, we did not appreciate higher adenovirus rates as observed previously.23 Although RV-C is associated with severe asthma exacerbations,32\n,\n[36], [37], [38], [39], [40], [41], [42] we did not recruit enough patients to discern a difference in symptom severity between species.",

Previous studies of children with natural colds have shown increases in nasal chemokines.[25], [26], [27], [28], [29] Increases in MDA5, TLR3, and ICAM-1 are noteworthy, because each functions as a receptor for RV. Melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5 and TLR3 are cytoplasmic and endosomal receptors for viral double-stranded RNA, respectively,47 whereas ICAM-1 is a receptor for major group RV.48 Samples from children with mild and asymptomatic viral infections also showed significant increases in nasal aspirate biomarkers, albeit fewer than samples from more severe colds. One fourth of virus-positive samples were not associated with symptoms. Collection of these samples often followed symptomatic viral infections, indicating that asymptomatic infections represented convalescence from more severe colds. Samples from children with asymptomatic infections showed higher nasal CXCL10 mRNA and CCL20 protein expression, suggesting persistence of these cytokines after resolution of symptoms.",

In contrast, no association was seen between viral copy number and symptoms. Our data are consistent with a previous study in adults with asthma showing no correlation between severity of lower respiratory tract symptoms and viral load.49 These data suggest that respiratory symptoms in children with asthma with natural colds may not depend on viral load alone.
