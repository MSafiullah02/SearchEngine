A better understanding of the ferroptotic death mechanism could lead to the development of new therapeutics for degenerative diseases, and a better understanding of how to induce ferroptosis in specific tumor contexts. We performed an unbiased genome-wide siRNA screen to find genetic suppressors of ferroptosis. We determined that loss of CARS, the cysteinyl-tRNA synthetase, suppresses ferroptosis induced by erastin, which inhibits the cystine-glutamate antiporter known as system x c \u2212 . Knockdown of CARS inhibited erastin-induced death by preventing the induction of lipid reactive oxygen species, without altering iron homeostasis. Knockdown of CARS led to the accumulation of cystathionine, a metabolite on the transsulfuration pathway, and upregulated genes associated with serine biosynthesis and transsulfuration. In addition, inhibition of the transsulfuration pathway resensitized cells to erastin, even after CARS knockdown. These studies demonstrate a new mechanism of resistance to ferroptosis and may lead to strategies for inducing and suppressing ferroptosis in diverse contexts.",

            "text": "Glutathione (GSH) is a tripeptide, the synthesis of which is dependent on the availability of the amino acid cysteine. A substantial fraction of extracellular cysteine exists as its oxidized disulfide form, cystine, because of the oxidative extracellular environment. 5 Some cells primarily obtain cysteine by importing extracellular cystine through system x c \u2212 , the cystine-glutamate antiporter. Cystine is then reduced to cysteine inside cells, fueling GSH synthesis. GSH maintains redox homeostasis by acting as a reductive substrate for reactive oxygen species (ROS)-detoxifying enzymes. As one example, glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) uses GSH to reduce lipid hydroperoxides and organic hydroperoxides to alcohols, serving a critical role in lipid repair and detoxification. GPX4 was recently shown to be a central regulator of ferroptosis. 6 Ferroptosis can be induced by two classes of compounds, exemplified by erastin and (1 S, 3 R)-RSL3. [6] [7] [8] [9] These two compounds target different parts of the ferroptotic pathway. Erastin inhibits system x c \u2212 to deplete GSH, which effectively inactivates all cellular glutathione peroxidases, including GPX4. RSL3, on the other hand, acts downstream, inhibiting GPX4 directly. In both cases, the loss of GPX4 activity causes accumulation of lipid peroxides, and ultimately, cell death. Recently, the FDA-approved drugs sorafenib and sulfasalazine were also found to induce ferroptosis through inhibition of system x c \u2212 activity, 10, 11 although these lower-potency compounds may also activate other competing processes at similar or slightly higher concentrations. A specific inhibitor of ferroptosis, ferrostatin-1, and its analogs have been shown to suppress cell death in several degenerative disease models, including HD, PVL and kidney dysfunction, as well as in a model of glutamate toxicity, suggesting the involvement of ferroptosis in these conditions. 4, 12 Collectively, these findings suggest that modulation of ferroptosis is of potential therapeutic relevance in several pathological conditions.",

            "text": "RNAi screen to identify genes essential for ferroptosis. In order to identify genes essential for ferroptosis in an unbiased fashion, we performed a screen in HT-1080 fibrosarcoma cells using a siRNA library targeting 21 687 human genes (Ambion Silencer, Grand Island, NY, USA). A pool of three siRNA sequences targeting each gene was tested in 384-well format to identify suppressors of erastininduced ferroptosis. A pool of siRNAs targeting VDAC3, which was previously identified as an essential gene for erastin-induced ferroptosis, was used as a positive control on each plate (Figure 1a ). 9 HT-1080 cells were reverse transfected with siRNAs for 72 h, after which they were treated with either 7 \u03bcM erastin (GI 100 , the concentration required for 100% growth inhibition; this meant that we could only detect suppressors, not enhancers, in the screen) or an equivalent volume of DMSO as a vehicle control, for 24 h (Figure 1b ). Growth inhibition (%GI) was calculated for each pool of siRNAs, and screening data were analyzed using CellHTS2, an R-based open source software package. 13 Gene knockdowns that prevented erastin-induced ferroptosis by more than three median absolute distribution (MAD) from the median were rescreened in a second cell line (BJeLR), in the same manner as in HT-1080 cells (Supplementary Figure  S1A ). 8 BJeLR cells are fibroblast cells harboring oncogenic hTERT, Simian Virus 40 large and small T oncogenes and oncogenic HRAS, and are sensitive to ferroptosis. 14 A total of 1426 siRNA pools were retested in BJeLR cells; 325 showed 450% rescue of erastin-induced ferroptosis in this cell line. siRNA pools targeting 250 genes were cherry picked based on the magnitude of rescue from erastin-induced ferroptosis, excluding genes that were independently toxic (o10% remaining viability without erastin treatment). siRNAs targeting the 250 selected genes were retested in a deconvoluted format (three independent siRNAs against each gene tested in separate wells) in a third cell line, Panc-1 (pancreatic epithelial carcinoma), as well as again in HT-1080 cells. We used Panc-1 cells to decrease the chances of finding a genetic modulator of ferroptosis that might be cell-line or lineage specific, and because Panc-1 cells are derived from a different tissue lineage, but are sensitive to ferroptosis. Toxic siRNAs that decreased viability to o30% of control were not further evaluated. Eleven genes reproducibly suppressed erastin-induced ferroptosis upon knockdown in both HT-1080 cells (three sequences, t-test, Po0.05 compared with nontargeting siRNA) and Panc-1 cells (three sequences, t-test, Po0.05; Supplementary Table SI1 ). These 11 genes were associated with distinct pathways. Knockdown of CARS had by far the most robust suppressive effect, so we further investigated the function of this gene in ferroptosis (Figure 1c ).",

CARS encodes the cysteinyl-tRNA synthetase, an enzyme involved in charging of tRNAs with cysteine for protein translation. 15 We first validated the ability of CARS knockdown to prevent erastin-induced ferroptosis using three additional sequences of Ambion Silencer Select siRNAs targeting CARS (Figure 2a ). These siRNA sequences knocked down CARS protein and mRNA levels as determined through immunoblotting and qPCR ( Figure 2b ). Independent shRNA constructs targeting CARS also showed a suppressive phenotype, corresponding to the degree of mRNA knockdown (Supplementary Figure S1B ). CARS knockdown with siRNA was able to rescue from erastin treatment for longer than 24 h (Supplementary Figure S1C) . Moreover, overexpression of a CARS cDNA construct, with the third codon of the siRNA target sequence mutated, prevented knockdown of CARS with the siRNAs and reversed the suppressive effects of siCARS, restoring sensitivity to erastin (Supplementary Figure S2A) . CARS overexpression on its own did not sensitize to erastin-induced lethality, suggesting that excess CARS abundance does not further contribute to erastin-induced ferroptosis (Supplementary Figure S2B) . These experiments established that CARS expression is essential for erastin-mediated ferroptosis.",

Specifically, we tested two other compounds that induce ferroptosis through distinct mechanisms (1 S,3 R)-RSL3 (hereafter referred to as RSL3, which inhibits GPX4 directly) and FIN56, which causes depletion of GPX4 protein (Shimada et al., under review), and on the lethality of the apoptosis inducers doxorubicin (a DNA-damaging agent and topoisomeriase inhibitor) and rotenone (an inducer of mitochondrial ROS generation), in HT-1080 cells. CARS knockdown did not suppress the lethality of any of these compounds (Figure 2d ), indicating that the suppressive effect of CARS is likely specific for ferroptosis induced by system x c \u2212 inhibition. In support of this observation, the lethality of ME II and PE, two erastin analogs that also inhibit system x c \u2212 , was suppressed by CARS knockdown. Given that RSL3 and FIN56 act at the level of GPX4 inactivation, leading to accumulation of lipid peroxides and execution of ferroptosis, 6 we hypothesized that CARS knockdown inhibits erastin's lethality upstream of GPX4. CARS knockdown did not suppress the lethality of buthionine sulfoximine (BSO), an inhibitor of \u03b3-glutamylcysteine synthetase, the rate-limiting enzyme in GSH synthesis, in HT-1080 cells, suggesting that CARS knockdown does not protect from lethality in response to inhibiting this step in glutathione synthesis (Supplementary Figure S2D) . BSO, however, has been documented to induce both ferroptosis and apoptosis in different contexts, potentially complicating the interpretation of this result.",

As CARS uses cysteine in a conjugation reaction with uncharged tRNAs, we hypothesized that CARS knockdown might elevate intracellular cysteine levels, which might in turn alter intracellular glutathione levels. We performed a global metabolite analysis to detect alterations in over 300 metabolites upon CARS knockdown. There was a detectable increase in intracellular free cysteine ( Figure 3b) ; however, there was no change in the level of reduced or oxidized intracellular GSH (Figure 3b ). The most increased metabolite upon CARS knockdown was in fact cysteine-glutathione disulfide (CSSG), which would likely form in response to an increase in cysteine levels ( Figure 3b ). We hypothesized that CSSG could serve as a source of glutathione in times of stress, such as upon loss of cellular cysteine. Indeed, there was a slight but significant (t-test, P-valueo0.05) increase even in reduced and oxidized GSH upon erastin treatment in the presence of CARS knockdown. We also determined from this experiment that cystathionine, a central metabolite in the transsulfuration pathway, was increased upon CARS gene knockdown (Figure 3c) . We wondered whether, upon CARS knockdown, cells might become dependent upon the transsulfuration pathway to generate cysteine, leading to resistance to erastin. We examined changes in the transcriptome using RNA sequencing (using RNA-seq) to determine whether genes involved in the transsulfuration pathway may be induced upon CARS knockdown. Indeed, compared with nontargeting-siRNAtreated cells, siCARS induced genes involved in serine biosynthesis and transsulfuration (Figure 3c , relative abundances in Supplementary Table SI2 ); thus, we further investigated this pathway's involvement in leading to resistance to erastin.",

To evaluate the potential relevance of the ability of CARS knockdown to inhibit ferroptosis to degenerative disease models, we tested the ability of CARS knockdown to prevent glutamate-induced toxicity. It has been found that glutamate can induce ferroptosis in models of glutamate toxicity, raising the question of whether CARS knockdown could prevent glutamate toxicity. 4, 12 To test whether CARS knockdown could prevent glutamate toxicity in a high-throughput format, we developed an assay using PC12 rat pheochromocytoma cells. PC12 cells are sensitive to glutamate-induced toxicity, which can be rescued with antioxidants. 20 We first tested whether PC12 cells undergo ferroptosis in response to erastin or glutamate. PC12 cells were sensitive to both erastin and glutamate, and both lethal agents were rescued upon treatment with any of the ferroptosis inhibitors Fer-1, deferoxamine (DFO), and ATOC (Figure 4a ). The lethality of both erastin and glutamate was also associated with increased lipid ROS levels (Figure 4b) , consistent with induction of ferroptosis. To confirm that the mechanism by which PC12 cells were dying in response to glutamate was due to cystine depletion, we co-treated cells with \u03b2-mercaptoethanol (\u03b2-ME), which allows cells to take up cystine circumventing system x c \u2212 inhibition, and with glutamate. 21 \u03b2-ME co-treatment rescued cells from glutamate toxicity, signifying that PC12 cells undergo cell death due to cystine depletion in response to glutamate (Figure 4c ). We employed shRNAs targeting rat Cars (as PC12 cells are of rat origin) and observed a suppressive effect on erastin and (c) Glutamateinduced toxicity can be rescued with \u03b2-mercaptoethanol (BME) co-treatment. PC12 cells were treated with the indicated concentration of glutamate (e) with or without 50 \u03bcM BME for 48 h before viability was assessed using a ViCell (Beckman Coulter). Error bars represent one S.D. from three biological replicates. One-way ANOVA, Bonferroni correction, ***P-valueo0.01. (d) Cars knockdown using either of two shRNA sequences rescues from erastin-induced and glutamate-induced lethality in PC12 cells. Error bars represent S. D. using technical triplicates. Data are representative of biological duplicates glutamate lethality (Figure 4d ; mRNA, Supplementary Figure  S4A) . These experiments suggest that inhibiting CARS in degenerative disease contexts where aberrant ferroptosis occurs may be of potential benefit, although the therapeutic index of this intervention remains to be established.",

CARS is involved in cysteine metabolism, which is the rate-limiting reagent for the synthesis of glutathione, an important molecule in the regulation of the oxidative environment of cells and ferroptosis. Upon CARS knockdown, we found an increase in intracellular cysteine and also an increase in reduced and oxidized glutathione with erastin treatment, leading to maintenance of GPX4 activity and to the rescue of erastin-induced ferroptosis.",

We determined that this difference was because of each ARS knockdown's ability to induce genes associated with the transsulfuration pathway. Specifically, CBS, which is involved in the conversion of cystathionine to cysteine, was upregulated by ARS knockdowns that suppressed erastin's lethality. The basis for the specificity of some ARS knockdowns' ability to induce transsulfuration genes is unknown. Individual aminoacid deprivation can induce ATF4 expression to different extents. 22 One possibility is that cells are more sensitive to accumulation of, or incorporation into proteins, cysteine, histidine and proline/glutamate. Another possibility is that as we were using siRNA technology to knockdown genes, knockdown of some ARSs was more efficient than others, although this was not distinguishable by RT-qPCR.",

            "text": "The ability of CARS knockdown to suppress ferroptosis induced by erastin, through activation of the transsulfuration pathway, explains the observation that CARS knockdown does not suppress the lethality of RSL3 or BSO. GPX4 inhibition by RSL3 cannot be rescued by increasing the pool of CSSG, GSH or cysteine, as RSL3 directly inhibits GPX4 biochemical activity. In addition, increasing the pool of intracellular cysteine would not suppress the lethality of BSO, which acts at the level of inhibiting the conjugation of cysteine to the \u03b3-carboxyl group of glutamate. Thus, activation of the transsulfuration pathway by CARS knockdown is only expected to suppress the ferroptosis induced by cysteine depletion, caused by inhibiting the cystine-glutamate exchanger, system x c \u2212 . GPX4 activity has been shown to be neuroprotective in HD models. 23 In addition, supplementation of cysteine to mouse diets was recently shown to delay neurodegeneration in mouse models of the disease. 24 The deficiency of cystathionine \u03b3-lyase in HD models was suggested to mediate the pathophysiology of the disease. tRNA synthetase inhibitors exist as antimicrobial agents; 25 however, development of a mammalian CARS inhibitor may be toxic, as tRNA synthetases are essential for protein synthesis. Mild and transient inhibition, however, may be beneficial in slowing cell death in certain physiological conditions, such as HD or ischemiareperfusion injury. Irrespective of this, the knowledge that ARS activity and the transsulfuration pathway regulate sensitivity to ferroptosis may aid in understanding and regulating this form of cell death in diverse contexts.",

            "text": "Validation of CARS as an inhibitor of erastin-induced ferroptosis. (a) Use of three independent siRNA sequences against CARS. Knockdown was performed in a 384-well plate for 48 h before the addition of 9 \u03bcM erastin for 24 h. Viability was measured with alamarBlue. mRNA levels were detected through qPCR from cells reverse transfected with siRNA in six-well format. Error bars represent one S.D. using three biological replicates. (b) CARS protein knockdown with siRNAs. (c) CARS knockdown prevents erastin lethality in a panel of cell lines. CARS (three unique siRNA sequences combined) was knocked down in 12-well format in HT-1080, Panc-1, 143B and A673 cells. After 48 h of knockdown, DMSO (vehicle) or 9 \u03bcM erastin was added for 24 h before viability was measured using a ViCell (Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA, USA). Erastin-treated cell counts were normalized to DMSO-treated cell counts. Error bars represent one S.D. using three biological replicates. Two-way ANOVA, Bonferroni correction, ***P-valueo0.001; NS, not significant relative to the indicated treatment. (d) CARS knockdown is specific for erastin-induced ferroptosis. CARS was knocked down in 6-well format and, after 48 h, was reseeded into 384-well format. After 24 h, lethal compounds were added in a twofold, 12-point dose curve. The highest concentrations of compound used were: erastin (37 \u03bcM), PE (15 \u03bcM), ME2 (3 \u03bcM), RSL3 (10 \u03bcM), FIN56 (41 \u03bcM), doxorubicin (36.8 \u03bcM) and rotenone (1.25 mM). AUC of each dose curve was calculated, then normalized to DMSO (vehicle) treatment, from which \u0394AUC was calculated and compared with DMSO. Data are from four biological replicates, one-way ANOVA compared with vehicle treatment, Bonferroni correction, ***P-valueo0.001, **P-valueo0.01",

(a) CARS knockdown inhibits lipid ROS formation in response to erastin. HT-1080 cells were reverse transfected with siRNA for 48 h, before 9 \u03bcM erastin treatment for 7 h. C11-BODIPY was added to cells and analyzed through FACS. Two-way ANOVA, Bonferroni correction, ***P-valueo0.001, **P-valueo0.01. (b) Metabolite analysis of CARS knockdown cells. Intracellular cysteine, cysteineglutathione disulfide, GSH reduced and GSH oxidized are shown. Welch's t-test, **P-valueo0.05, *0.05oP-valueo0.1. (c) Summary of metabolite (from metabolite analysis) and mRNA (from RNA-seq) levels associated with serine biosynthesis and transsulfuration. In gray are genes, followed by mRNA fold change comparing siCARS-treated cells with siNT cells. In black are metabolites, with fold change in relative metabolite levels comparing siCARS to siNT cells. Serine biosynthesis and the transsulfuration pathway are upregulated. (d) Co-treatment of CARS knockdown cells with propargylglycine resensitizes cells to erastin. HT-1080 cells were reverse transfected with siRNA for 48 h, before reseeding into 384-well format with DMSO (vehicle), or 2 mM propargylglycine.
