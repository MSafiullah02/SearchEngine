            "text": "A 24-year-old woman underwent living unrelated kidney transplantation. Immunosuppression included cyclosporine, mycophenolate mofetil, and corticosteroid. Both donor and recipient tested positive for anti-CMV IgG and negative for IgM antibodies. Serum creatinine (SCr) concentration was 1.2 mg/dL at 18 days posttransplantation. At day 22, the SCr concentration increased to 3 mg/d, and a 6-day course of antithymocyte globulin therapy was administered; the SCr concentration decreased to 1.5 mg/dL by day 30. However, in the sixth week posttransplantation, the SCr concentration was again increased, to 2.2 mg/dL. A serologic study revealed positive anti-CMV IgM and IgG antibodies. Intravenous ganciclovir was given for 12 days. At the beginning the fifth month posttransplantation, the patient experienced gradual onset of weakness, anorexia, weight loss, vague abdominal pain, and muscle cramping. Physical examination reveal hypotension (blood pressure, 85/60 mm Hg), which was aggravated by standing; hyperpigmentation of the brow, palmar creases, and transplantation scar but not the buccal mucosa; and loss of axillary and pubic hair. Laboratory findings included the following: while blood cell count, 6900/\u03bcL; hemoglobin, 12 mg/dL; Scr, 1.5 mg/dL; fasting blood glucose concentration, 95 mg/dL; serum sodium concentration, 136 mEq/L; and serum potassium concentration, 5 mEq/L. The patient was receiving prednisolone, 5 mg/d; cyclosporine; and mycophenolate mofetil. Prednisolone therapy was changed to oral hydrocortisone, 15 mg/d. After 2 weeks, the basal free cortisol concentration determined at 24 hours after administration of hydrocortisone was 4 \u03bcg/dL. Adrenal reserve capacity was determined at 30 minutes and at 6 and 24 hours after intramuscular injection of tetracosactide, 1 mg (Synacthen; Novartis Pharma AG, Basel, Switzerland); serum cortisol concentrations were 8, 7, and 7 \u03bcg/dL, respectively. A diagnosis of primary adrenal insufficiency was made. Hydrocortisone therapy was discontinued, and oral prednisolone, 10 \u03bcg/d, was initiated, and the patient was encouraged to ingest a liberal amount of salt. The constitutional symptoms and hypotension gradually improved, as did hyperpigmentation over the following months.",

A random cortisol value of less than 400 nmol/L (15 \u03bcg/dL) is suggestive of corticosteroid insufficiency; in our patient, the value was less than 5 mg/dL. An adrenocorticotropin hormone\u2013stimulated serum cortisol concentration less than 550 nmol/L (<20 mg/dL) also confirmed primary adrenal insufficiency.

Later studies suggested that the adrenal gland is the organ most frequently affected by CMV infection in patients with AIDS.3 Despite the high incidence of adrenal gland involvement, clinical adrenal insufficiency has been reported in 5% to 8% of HIV-infected patients. In addition to CMV, Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare, Cryptococcus, microsporidia, and Kaposi sarcoma have been reported as causing adrenal insufficiency in patients with HIV infection.5 Pathogenic fungi such as Histoplasma capsulatum, Paracoccidiodes brasiliensis, and less commonly Blastomyces dermatitidis and Cryptococcus neoformans can infect the adrenal gland, in particular in individuals with impaired cell-mediated immunity. Tuberculosis and herpes simplex virus infection also may infect the adrenal gland in immunocompetent individuals.5 In addition, hemorrhagic viruses such as Ebola virus, Marburg virus, and Lassa virus, and respiratory syndrome\u2013associated coronavirus and H5N1 avian influenza A virus may infect the adrenal gland in immunocompetent individuals. Acute adrenal hemorrhage may occur due to infection with Neisseria meningitidis (Waterhouse-Friderichsen syndrome), group A streptococci, pneumococci, and Haemophilus influenzae.\n5\n",

            "text": "In conclusion, an analogy may be made between renal transplant recipients and patients with AIDS because both have impaired cellular immune responses and are susceptible to the same pathogenic organisms, some of which, such as CMV, potentially can invade the adrenal gland. Corticosteroid therapy as part of the immunosuppression regimen may mask the signs and symptoms of underlying adrenal insufficiency. Low-dose corticosteroid therapy (eg, prednisolone, 5 mg/d) may be inadequate in some renal transplant recipients with underlying adrenal insufficiency, in particular during stress from medical conditions and major surgery. Awareness of this issue is also important when prescribing steroid-free immunosuppression regimens. Awareness of CMV-induced adrenal insufficiency is particularly important in transplantation centers with inadequate CMV prophylaxis.",
