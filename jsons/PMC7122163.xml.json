Indeed, in some cases researchers use these data sources without considering that they constitute a naturally occurring source of information about health and illness. This includes television programmes, documentaries, magazines, newspapers, policy documents, medical notes, and natural diaries. The world\u2019s media is full of reports and references to physical and mental health conditions, including references to services, stigma, disorders, and societal views. Through various media sources and through a range of difference natural texts, it is possible to perform a range of qualitative analytic approaches on this naturally occurring data.",

We consider how using recordings of various television sources, such as documentaries and chat shows, can provide insights into the social construction of health and illness. Text-based traditional media is also considered in terms of how this might be a useful way of understanding health and illness. The chapter concludes with other types of text-based sources that are common in health disciplines, such as medical notes, referral letters, health-related policies and guidelines, as well as natural diaries that are sometimes kept by patients with certain disorders, such as cancer or eating disorders.",

To achieve this, journalists often draw upon trusted sources such as medical staff, and specialist reporters have technical knowledge, appropriate sources of information, and more power within their organisations (Leask, Hooker, & King, 2010).",

            "text": "However, despite the effort to report health factually, research in this area has shown that media representation of health and illness is by no means neutral. A good example of this is evident if we turn our attention specifically to mental health. Media coverage of mental health is often negative in tone, often focusing on the criminal behaviour of the mentally ill that perpetuates the stigma (Bithell, 2010), and tends to be more negative in UK media than others such as the USA or Australia (Huang & Priebe, 2003). Additionally, mental health receives less press coverage than general medicine (Lawrie, 2000). While the coverage of mental health is particularly negative, all types of illness tend to be represented in quite negative ways. The representation of illness in the media tends to focus on illness as a deviation from society\u2019s norms (Rozonova, 2006). Furthermore, certain physical diseases also have stigma perpetuated by the media, such as cancer and AIDS, and this can increase the patient\u2019s suffering and hinder help-seeking (Sontag, 1991). Of course, there are many physical and mental health conditions that have negative associations, stereotypes, or attitudes linked to them. We encourage you to reflect on this in the activity in Box 7.1.",

In other words, in the analyses of media representations of disease, it is necessary to examine not only the accuracy of the media portrayals of diseases and how that compares to scientific findings, while also attending to the meaning of those media portrayals, as well as exploring why some health issues receive attention, while others do not (Rock, 2005).The second direction of the research conducted into the way the media represents health and illness relates to the effects of those portrayals on the audiences/readership. In other words, the media performs an important agenda-setting function. It selects which issues and diseases are worthy of the attention of the public, and likewise the public relies heavily on the media for information about health and illness (Frost, Frank, & Maibach, 1997). Consequently, the media reports of disease influence the ways people construct their views about health and illness (Hodgetts & Chamberlain, 2002).",

They argued that an explanation for this lay with the national news media\u2019s reporting on the explanations of the epidemic and how this reporting shaped the very meaning of the virus for a range of audiences. They demonstrated in their study that coverage of the epidemic occurred in three short periods and public opinion seemed to shift and debates in government began. They also noted that typical stories about AIDS tended to report it in sensationalising ways rather than reassuring ways, and the media utilised doctors and government officials as evidence for the news being reported. The authors argued that there were both benefits and pitfalls to the news media\u2019s power in shaping the public agenda.",

They noted that this was necessary as there were concerns about how the media might contribute to the developing culture of excessive drinking, particularly in younger people. For their study, they examined alcohol comments across six radio stations in England, with a data corpus of 12 h of radio. Analyses were quantitative and qualitative, and they identified 703 comments about alcohol with 244 involving presenters. They reported that 73% of the comments that were initiated by presenters and 45% of comments from all sources encouraged drinking. The authors argued that alcohol comments seemed to create an identity for programmes and to forge connections between presenters and audiences. Notably, the idea that alcohol is required for having a good time was rarely directly challenged on the radio. The data showed that weekend drinking and partying were key themes, and findings suggested that alcohol comments played a role in marketing and branding of radio output. The authors argued that comments about alcohol are shaped by the conventions of media that can make it difficult to challenge discourses about excessive drinking.",

As such they provide a useful source of data to examine the rhetorical and persuasive aspects. One of the techniques used by marketing companies is to produce advertisements with controversial subject matter that encourages conversation about the source of controversy. Furthermore, the advertising placement has implications and could be a topic of study in its own right. It is worth considering who the target audience of advertisements might be. The placement of the advertisement, its content, its use of stereotyping, and the possible controversial message can all be an interesting source of data.",

In this case, the authors quantify the representativeness of print newspapers\u2019 depictions of mortality. The results of the study demonstrated that for every tested cause of death, there was a disproportion between the text devoted to the cause and the real number of attributable deaths. Examples and statistics are provided by the authors. They conclude from their work that the news media misrepresents the prevalence of leading causes of death and the risks associated with them. They claimed that this misrepresentation may contribute to the distorted perceptions that people hold about threats to their health.Garner, A., Harwood, S., & Jones, S. (2016).

In this the authors explore the powerful influences of film on the rhetoric of mental health, by looking at representations of autism in film. The authors utilise discourse analysis to examine influential knowledge about adult autism and to explore how the images in film can have effects on the discourses of autism. The authors argue that such representation provides a restrictive frame for the viewer and too frequently depicts autism in negative and stereotyped ways.",
