Throughout the week there will be poster sessions linked to the Workshops, and a Commercial Exhibition. A novel departure is the One Day Course on the day preceding the Congress; this is conceived as a training session for virologists wanting to learn some of the basics in an area outside their own expertise-we hope it will appeal to students and more experienced scientists alike.",
