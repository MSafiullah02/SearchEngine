After the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) was initially described in 1981, a national epidemiologic surveillance case definition was developed. Disease surveillance was initiated to characterize the cases by standard measures of time, place, and person and to identify population groups at risk. Based on these efforts, an infectious etiology was hypothesized early in the epidemic, before the first laboratory evidence of an etiologic agent was presented. Combined clinical, epidemiologic, and laboratory studies led to the identification of HIV as the cause of AIDS and to the development of sensitive and specific serologic tests for infection. This progress in turn led to studies that characterized the spectrum of illness associated with HIV infection.",

Longitudinal follow-up studies of HIV-infected persons have identified long-term survivors\u2014individuals who have been infected for more than 10 years (and now more than 30 years) and have received no treatment yet remain without disease.4 Others have been studied who were exposed to HIV on numerous occasions but did not become infected. Collectively, these studies provided important observations leading to better understanding of the mechanisms of resistance to HIV infection and disease. Clinical trials were conducted to assess the efficacy of antiretroviral agents and combinations of drugs to increase the effectiveness of therapy and reduce the rate of resistance to individual drugs. Development of potential HIV vaccines progressed to the implementation and innovative design of phase III human trials.5, 6 Other trials were conducted to assess the efficacy of a range of antimicrobial agents aimed at preventing a variety of opportunistic infections. Finally, community-based programs were developed on the basis of epidemiologic data to promote behavior change aimed at reducing the risk of HIV transmission. Epidemiologic methods were also applied to evaluate these community-based programs and to establish a framework in which a disease-modifying HIV vaccine could be integrated into a comprehensive HIV prevention program. These examples illustrate the broad range of roles that epidemiologic methods have played in understanding and controlling the HIV epidemic.",

By late May 2013, approximately 2 months after the initial report, the number of laboratory-confirmed H7N9 infections reached 132, with 37 deaths.15 The rapid conduct of clinical, epidemiologic, and laboratory studies were initiated by Chinese medical and public health officials with support from experts from around the world. It was determined that the novel H7N9 viruses were reassortants, comprising H7 HA, N9 NA, and the six internal genes of H9N2 influenza A viruses. This combination of influenza genes had not previously been identified among viruses obtained from birds, humans, or any other species, although individual genes are related to those of recent avian influenza viruses circulating in East Asia. H7N9 viruses obtained from human cases, poultry, and environmental samples were closely related and contained a number of genetic signatures previously associated with low pathogenicity in poultry, enhanced capacity for mammalian infection, and resistance to the adamantane class of antiviral drugs.16, 17 The detection of H7N9 virus in live poultry markets in the vicinity of human cases in Shanghai, the contact history with live poultry or live poultry markets in a substantial number of cases, and the major reduction in human cases after the closure of live poultry markets throughout eastern China, suggest exposure to live poultry as a key risk factor for human H7N9 infection18 (see Chapter 157).",

Specificity and sensitivity are concepts that are frequently used in reference to laboratory test performance, particularly with tests that are used for screening purposes.1 However, in the epidemiologic study of infectious diseases, it is important to also apply the concepts of specificity and sensitivity more broadly in terms of diagnosis of infection and disease. For example, the diagnosis of smallpox was both highly specific and sensitive. Few other diseases could be confused with smallpox (i.e., the diagnosis was specific), and clinical disease developed in most people who became infected with smallpox virus (i.e., the diagnosis was sensitive). These qualities, in addition to the facts that humans were the only important reservoir for the smallpox virus and that highly immunogenic vaccines had been developed, led to the successful eradication of smallpox.19\n",

Epidemiologic studies of diarrheogenic Escherichia coli are complicated by the fact that diarrhea is not specific for E. coli, and the sensitivity of E. coli detection is limited due to an array of virulence factors that can result in disease yet are not detected by standard biochemical tests.20 Even the ability to detect specific agents and virulence factors by rapid, nonculture methods does not resolve these difficulties.21\nE. coli O157:H7 and some other Shiga-toxin\u2013producing E. coli (STECs) may lead to a broad spectrum of clinical illnesses, including uncomplicated diarrhea, hemorrhagic colitis, and hemolytic-uremic syndrome. However, not all STEC strains have the same disease-causing potential. Depending on whether the goals of a particular study address the clinical illness, the specific agent, or the public health implications of detecting the agent in clinical, food, or environmental samples, investigators may choose a case definition that casts a wide net or is more narrowly focused.

In these situations, how the outcome variables and study population are defined and measured can affect interpretation of the results and the validity of the conclusions. For example, in the development of recombinant vaccines for hepatitis B virus (HBV), two vaccine formulations, containing either 10 \u00b5g or 20 \u00b5g of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) in each dose, were evaluated in clinical trials. Higher antibody titers developed in subjects who were administered vaccine with the higher dose. Both vaccines produced sufficient levels of antibody to be considered protective against infection, and both were licensed by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. However, when the vaccines were more broadly administered to Minnesota hospital employees, those who received vaccine with 20 \u00b5g HBsAg per dose were more likely than those given the lower-dose vaccine to have detectable antibody when tested within 6 months after completing the three-dose series.22 The results of this investigation suggested that sociodemographic factors of the community-vaccinated population, such as age, gender, weight, and smoking, affected the outcome of vaccination programs in ways that were not predicted by the clinical trials.23 In a study of children with inflammatory bowel disease, only 56% of children previously vaccinated against HBV had immunity to HBV, a mean of 13 years later.24 Older age, lower albumin levels, and the presence of pancolitis were associated with lack of immunity. The use of immunosuppressive therapy was not associated with a lack of immunity, but it was associated with a lack of response to an additional dose of HBV vaccine given to children who lacked immunity.24\n",

For example, large multistate outbreaks of E. coli O157:H7 have been documented with increasing frequency. However, without molecular subtyping of E. coli O157:H7 strains, population-based surveillance is limited in its ability to detect and determine when an unexpected number or temporal clustering of cases actually documents a common vehicle-associated outbreak. In September 2006, epidemiologists and public health laboratory workers in Wisconsin noticed a small cluster of E. coli O157:H7 cases with a common pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) subtype pattern. The Wisconsin state laboratory posted the PFGE pattern on the national subtyping network for foodborne disease surveillance known as PulseNet. Within 1 week, multiple states reported matching cases, an epidemiologic study was conducted to evaluate case exposures, and fresh spinach was identified as the vehicle.25 Ultimately, 205 cases in 26 states were linked to the outbreak, and the results of the investigation stimulated important investments in research related to the safety of leafy-green produce items.

It is common practice to define outbreaks as the occurrence of cases of disease at a frequency greater than expected.1 When an outbreak occurs, it is necessary to define the population at risk (i.e., the denominator) if an accurate measure of the rate of disease is to be calculated. For example, it is not unusual to recognize a cluster of cases of Neisseria meningitidis disease in the community in populations not previously vaccinated. Because outbreaks of invasive N. meningitidis disease are known to occur in closed populations, such as persons living in dormitories and barracks, and because a vaccine and antibiotic chemoprophylaxis are available to prevent or control these outbreaks, the occurrence of multiple cases of meningococcal disease inevitably prompts a rapid public health assessment.27 Cases of meningococcal disease tend to occur during well-described seasonal peak periods, so it is possible that a cluster of unrelated cases may occur in a defined population. Conversely, a common strain may be transmitted within social networks that form a population group that is not easy to define. During 2005 to 2006, 23 cases of serogroup C meningococcal disease occurred among illicit drug users and their contacts in Brooklyn, New York.28 From 2010 to 2012, 18 men who have sex with men (MSM) in New York City were infected by a closely related strain.29 The need for public health intervention is quite different for a cluster of cases representing an outbreak associated with a single strain, compared with a cluster in which each case is caused by a different group or strain of N. meningitidis.\n30 However, in many situations, strains are not available for further subtyping, because laboratory capacity to distinguish strains is limited.",

It is common to express incidence rates in terms of person-years of exposure. Prevalence describes the number of current cases of disease per population unit at the time of observation. The relationship between incidence and prevalence depends on the duration of infection or disease. For example, the incidence of Lyme disease or hepatitis A virus (HAV) infections over a period of 1 year is always greater than its prevalence at a given point because the disease has a very short duration. In contrast, the prevalence of HIV or M. tuberculosis infections is always greater than its incidence because the infection is chronic, and infected persons may live for years after the initial infection.",

Relative risk (RR) is the ratio of the rate of illness or infection among persons who were exposed to the rate among persons who were not exposed (Fig. 13-1\n). RRs may also be called rate ratios and are the products of cohort studies. In case-control studies, odds ratios (ORs) are determined and approximate the relative risk. ORs provide a valid estimate of the RR under conditions that prevail in most case-control studies: the cases of disease are newly diagnosed, prevalent cases are not included in the control group, and the selection of cases and controls is not based on exposure status.31 An increased RR or OR (i.e., >1.0) for an exposure variable indicates that the exposure is related to an increased risk of disease. Similarly, a decreased RR or OR (i.e., <1.0) indicates that the exposure variable is related to a decreased risk of disease. For example, the consumption of undercooked ground beef has been associated with an increased risk of E. coli O157:H7 infection in outbreak settings and of sporadic E. coli O157:H7 infections in the community.32\n",

Rather, the attributable risk or fraction considers both the RR for an exposure variable and the proportion of the population exposed to that variable. In a case-control study of sporadic E. coli O157:H7 infections conducted by the Foodborne Disease Active Surveillance Network (FoodNet) in 1996 to 1997, persons who ate undercooked hamburgers away from home had approximately a 6 times greater risk of E. coli O157:H7 than those who did not. For those who ate undercooked hamburger at home, the risk was only 2 times greater. However, eating undercooked hamburger at home was more common than eating it away from home. Therefore, eating undercooked hamburger at home accounted for an estimated 8% of cases, whereas the riskier (i.e., higher OR) practice of eating undercooked hamburger away from home accounted for 7% of cases. Furthermore, persons who ate at a table service restaurant were only 1.7 times as likely to have E. coli O157:H7 infection than those who did not. But, because eating at a table service restaurant is a very common practice and therefore represents more frequent exposure, it accounted for an estimated 20% of cases. Although it had the weakest statistical association, it accounted for the highest proportion of cases. Similarly, in a case-control study of sporadic listeriosis cases reported in FoodNet sites from 2000 to 2003, living on a cattle farm had the strongest association with illness (OR = 13.75), but, because it was an uncommon exposure, it had a population attributable fraction of only 1.6%. However, eating melons at a commercial establishment accounted for 10.6% of cases, even though the OR was only 2.6.33 The identification of melon as a risk factor for sporadic listeriosis in this study subsequently made it easier for investigators to identify cantaloupe as the source for a large multistate outbreak of listeriosis in 2011.34 As these examples show, both RR and attributable risk are important measures for describing the epidemiology of infectious diseases and determining public health priorities.",

Statistical associations, both positive and negative, may represent a true causal relationship, a confounding relationship with another factor, or a chance occurrence. If more than one factor is statistically associated with infection or disease status in univariate (single-variable) analyses, the relationship between individual factors and infection or disease status can be evaluated by multivariate regression analysis.35 These procedures allow the investigator to simultaneously control for a combination of factors in the analysis and to determine whether any of the risk factors are associated with infection or disease status independently of other factors. Another critical way of distinguishing causation from confounding or chance is by assessing the biologic plausibility of the association. An unexpected statistical association found in conjunction with an epidemiologic study may result in new understanding of how agent transmission or disease occurs. The temptation to stretch the plausibility of biology to provide meaning to statistical results is a constant danger.

Academic-based research centers are often settings for clinical trials, studies requiring newly developed laboratory methods, or studies derived from referrals to clinical specialty groups. Public health departments typically do not have direct access to or contact with patients for clinical trials, but they are responsible for surveillance of reportable diseases and the investigation of outbreaks.

Based on the recommendations of the work group, a multisite study coordinated by the CDC was initiated in multiple states or areas with active surveillance of invasive GAS disease.

Surveillance for unexplained deaths from possible infectious causes, with characterization of such deaths based on the clinical syndrome at the initial evaluation, is a way to monitor the emergence of potential new infectious disease threats.48 Finally, syndromic surveillance has been established in several large cities to serve as an early warning system for the detection of bioterrorist events.49 Although useful for tracking community-wide spread of influenza-like illness, syndromic surveillance systems have shown very little sensitivity to the occurrence of infectious disease outbreaks in these cities.50, 51\n",

Active surveillance involves a regular, systematic effort to contact reporting sources or to review records within an institution to ascertain information on the occurrence of newly diagnosed diseases or infections. An example of an active surveillance system for foodborne illnesses is FoodNet, which operates as part of CDC's Emerging Infections Program.56 Active laboratory-based surveillance for confirmed cases of Campylobacter, Cryptosporidium, Cyclospora, E. coli O157:H7, Listeria, Salmonella, Shigella, and Vibrio increased from five sites, covering 5% of the U.S. population in 1996 to 10 sites covering approximately 15% of the population in 2007. Each clinical laboratory in the surveillance catchment areas is contacted weekly or monthly to ensure that all confirmed infections under surveillance have been reported. These data have been extremely useful in establishing national estimates for the burden of foodborne illness in the United States and for monitoring trends in the incidence of specific foodborne agents. Passive surveillance relies on the individual clinician or laboratory to initiate the report. For many diseases of public health importance, passive surveillance can be almost as comprehensive as active surveillance. Although surveillance systems are labeled as active or passive based on how cases are reported, all surveillance systems require an active review and analysis of reported cases, with dissemination of results to key stakeholders.44\n",

These qualities vary by disease and depend on multiple factors. The first factor of importance is that the patient must seek medical attention. It is not common for persons with mild or limited illnesses to seek medical attention. Second, the physician must seek laboratory testing of appropriate clinical specimens to confirm the diagnosis. Third, the laboratory must have the capability to identify the agent. Fourth, the physician and laboratory must report the clinical and laboratory findings to public health officials in a timely manner. Fifth, the availability of molecular subtyping techniques such as PFGE and the ability to compare PFGE patterns electronically through the national computer network PulseNet can greatly increase both the sensitivity and the specificity of pathogen-specific surveillance. Even in states where laboratory-based infectious disease reporting is required, there may be confusion among physicians and laboratory officials regarding who has the responsibility for reporting. Finally, public health agencies must have the resources to conduct timely and routine follow-up of such reports, to ascertain basic case demographic and other relevant data. Failure at any step of this process results in loss of information to the community-based surveillance system.",

For example, for many years, the diagnosis of Lyme disease presented difficulties because many patients were not seen when the typical clinical manifestations of the disease were present, and laboratory testing was not adequate to establish the diagnosis. In contrast, the diagnosis of measles can be confirmed by specific serologic testing, regardless of whether the physician sees the patient or has the training and experience to recognize the pathognomonic clinical features of the disease. Surveillance for invasive bacterial diseases such as those caused by N. meningitidis is facilitated by the need for medical treatment because of the relative severity of the disease and the laboratory-supported diagnosis. For diseases such as these, active case ascertainment can greatly enhance the effectiveness of surveillance activities. However, active surveillance requires the commitment of personnel and other resources that are limited for many reportable diseases. Nonetheless, it may be critical to evaluating the impact of vaccines for invasive diseases such as Haemophilus influenzae type b, which declined by 95% within 6 years after the introduction of the conjugate vaccine in 1989. Active surveillance for invasive H. influenzae disease has confirmed the effective control of H. influenzae type b with no evidence of increased disease caused by non-B serotypes in young children in the United States.57\n",

Passive surveillance systems are subject to selection bias because disease reports are likely to come from a nonrepresentative sample of practicing physicians who may report specific diseases because of personal interest.44 In addition, some data (i.e., age and gender versus clinical and pathologic information) may be more readily reported because of ease of ascertainment.44\n",

Case-control studies are the most widely conducted type of epidemiologic study because they are relatively cheap, powerful, and adaptable to many settings.35 For example, in a nationwide outbreak of Salmonella enteritidis infection, the results of a case-control study identified the ice cream made by a large national producer as the source of the outbreak 10 days before S. enteritidis could be isolated from samples of the implicated ice cream.62 When S. enteritidis was isolated from the ice cream, it was shown to be present at levels of less than one to six organisms per half-cup serving, levels that rendered microbiologic surveillance of ice cream insensitive. Furthermore, the case-control study established that contamination of the pasteurized ice cream premix occurred during transport in tanker trailers that had previously carried nonpasteurized liquid eggs, even though regulatory officials were not able to isolate S. enteritidis from any environmental samples.",

In the community setting, it is customary to select controls from the same area of residence as the cases. It is desirable for controls to resemble cases with respect to variables that are not being studied. Controls may also be matched by age, gender, or any other factor that the investigator considers necessary. For example, in studying risk factors for listeriosis, it has been important to select or match controls with a similar risk of illness based on the presence of an immunocompromising condition or treatment. This is necessary because healthy community control subjects who have exactly the same exposures are less likely to develop disease. Therefore, a case-control study of listeriosis using healthy community-based controls would require simultaneously trying to assess the risk for exposure as well as the risk for illness given exposure. However, overmatching, such as requiring the control to have the same birthday as the case, may make it difficult to identify and recruit controls. Also, once a variable is used as a matching criterion, it is no longer available for evaluation. In hospital settings, controls are frequently selected from patients with unrelated diagnoses who might otherwise be comparable to the cases.",

At the local or state level, outbreaks may be reported because a physician or the public is aware of the health department's existence and desires some intervention. Once an outbreak has been recognized, it is necessary to determine its extent in terms of person, place, and time. For example, the nationwide outbreak associated with Schwan's ice cream initially appeared as an increased occurrence of cases in southeastern Minnesota.62 These cases served to index the larger outbreak occurring throughout the distribution area for the implicated product. Similarly, a cluster of four human Salmonella serotype I 4,5,12:i:\u2212 infections with an identical PFGE pattern was identified by the Pennsylvania Department of Health and reported to PulseNet in June 2007. As recognition of the outbreak increased and the case count soared to 401 cases across 41 states, a series of independent and coordinated studies was conducted by state and local health departments in collaboration with CDC. After a cluster of cases was linked to consumption of potpies by the Minnesota Department of Health in October, a multistate case-control study quickly confirmed the association, identified a specific product, and determined that most of the patients cooked the potpies in a microwave oven, without regard to cooking instructions.70 However, the potpies were not ready-to-eat foods. Undercooking of foods in microwave ovens has surfaced as an important risk factor in several recent outbreaks of salmonellosis.71\n",

The timeliness of outbreak investigations is further limited by the need to interview cases, formulate hypotheses, and subsequently recruit and interview controls. Currently, all listeriosis cases in the United States are interviewed as part of a national Listeria initiative.73 This has allowed the use of case-case comparisons, with the results of subtyping to distinguish outbreak cases from unrelated cases.74 Such methods led to the rapid identification of cantaloupe as the source of a multistate outbreak of listeriosis.73 If Salmonella and E. coli O157:H7 cases were similarly interviewed on a routine basis, the same approach could be applied to these outbreaks as well. A recent development that has been used to accelerate outbreak investigations has been to compare exposure histories among cases to an expected rate of exposure based on population surveys.75 This has the benefit of eliminating the labor-intensive and time-consuming process of recruiting and interviewing controls. However, it is limited by the availability of population exposure data. Most outbreaks using this method have used FoodNet population survey data, which is only available for FoodNet sites, includes a limited number of food items, and was last updated in 2006 to 2007.76 In addition, because the use of binomial statistics creates the functional equivalent of a case-control study with a very large control group, it increases the potential for type 1 error, in which an association is accepted when it should not be. The key step to prevent type 1 error with this method is to confirm the association through traceback of suspected food items to a common production or distribution source.75\n",

Although many of these outbreaks may seem to be self-limited events unique to the establishment, they may serve to index much larger outbreaks. They also provide opportunities to identify emerging foodborne pathogens. For example, in both 1996 and 1997, the nationwide outbreaks of cyclosporiasis associated with raspberries imported from Guatemala were manifested as a large series of otherwise unrelated outbreaks associated with restaurants, banquets, and parties.77, 78 It was only through collective investigation and tracing the product back from these individual events that the nature of the outbreak was recognized. Similarly, the investigation of an outbreak of gastrointestinal illness with clinical and epidemiologic features of enterotoxigenic E. coli at a restaurant led to the identification of a novel strain of atypical enteropathogenic E. coli.\n20 Nationwide surveillance efforts conducted by individual states, coordinated by the CDC, and facilitated by resources such as FoodNet and PulseNet offer great promise to enhance understanding of foodborne diseases in the coming years. A challenge to this promise is the rapid development and use of nonculture diagnostic tests that may reduce the ability of PulseNet to identify outbreaks if isolates are not submitted to public health laboratories for molecular subtyping.79 However, if these tests are cheaper and produce results that are faster and more clinically relevant, it may greatly increase the diagnosis of Salmonella, Shiga-toxin\u2013producing E. coli, and other foodborne pathogens. This could lead to more sensitive outbreak detection and increase the usefulness of outbreak investigations to attribute foodborne diseases to specific food items and routes of exposure.",

Second, would patients be harmed by withholding the treatment or vaccine? These issues gained particular attention regarding trials of drugs and vaccines for the treatment of HIV infection. The initial double-blind, placebo-controlled study of oral azidothymidine (AZT) in AIDS patients was stopped early because of the marked effectiveness of the treatment.83 Over the past decade, multiple efficacy trials of an HIV-1 vaccine were terminated early when an interim analysis demonstrated that the vaccine did not protect against HIV infection or reduce viral loads after infection and may have increased susceptibility in some subjects.84, 85 An overriding concern in HIV-related clinical trials is the need to maintain behavior-related educational interventions for all participants in the trials. Although this may reduce the likelihood of demonstrating vaccine efficacy because of the lack of new infections among placebo recipients, to withhold such education would be unethical.",

This type of direct contact transmission occurs in association with touching, kissing, or sexual intercourse or by the direct projection (droplet spread) of droplet spray from an infected host onto the conjunctiva or the mucous membranes of the nose or mouth of another host. Typically, droplet spread is limited to a distance of approximately 1 m. The second type of direct transmission occurs when host-susceptible tissue is exposed to the agent, such as through the bite of a rabid animal or contact with soil or decaying matter in which the agent leads a saprophytic existence (e.g., systemic mycosis). As an example, direct human contact with infected pet prairie dogs led to an outbreak of monkeypox in the United States.106 Transplacental transmission is the third form of direct transmission.",

Education and drug treatment programs targeted to this population can serve as an important disease prevention and control strategy. Finally, assessing the population of species-specific mosquitoes and viability of local breeding sites can provide a risk assessment of the likelihood of vector-borne disease transmission (e.g., West Nile virus infection).118, 119\n",

As the routine childhood immunization schedule becomes increasingly complex, new methods of vaccine delivery need to be developed. Of particular interest is the development of new multiple-antigen vaccines to simplify the routine schedule and maximize efficiency of vaccine delivery. The goals of routine childhood immunization are twofold: to protect the individual and to provide herd immunity, which can be effective in controlling certain diseases at the population level (e.g., measles, mumps, rubella, H. influenzae).124 Ongoing adequate surveillance for these diseases is essential to monitor the effectiveness of population-based immunization programs so that strategies can be adapted as needed.

As a primary prevention strategy, it may be used before or after exposure to prevent infection. Examples of chemoprophylaxis in the postexposure setting include erythromycin after exposure to pertussis; rifampin after N. meningitidis; amantadine, rimantadine, zanamir, or oseltamivir after influenza A virus; and zidovudine after HIV exposure. Use of antiretroviral drugs by HIV-infected pregnant women has been shown to substantially reduce the risk of perinatal HIV infection.128 Prophylaxis against surgical wound infections with broad-spectrum coverage before surgery and prophylaxis of neonates against ophthalmia neonatorum are examples of chemoprophylaxis used in the hospital setting. In such situations, chemoprophylaxis is used because a likelihood of exposure to pathogenic organisms is present, even if exposure is not clearly documented. Chemoprophylaxis is also used in anticipation of exposure during travel; examples include the use of chloroquine or mefloquine to prevent malaria or antimicrobials against enteric pathogens to prevent traveler's diarrhea.",

Routine screening programs for sexually transmitted diseases such as Chlamydia infection are examples of secondary prevention strategies.129, 130 Contact investigations for partners of persons with sexually transmitted diseases are also part of a secondary prevention strategy focused on those at highest risk of infection (i.e., those with known exposure).
