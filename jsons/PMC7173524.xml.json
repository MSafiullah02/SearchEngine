BMV is the type member of the genus Bromovirus in the family Bromoviridae. BMV is also a representative member of the alphavirus-like super-family that include viruses infecting human, animal, and plants that share similar genome structures, gene expression strategies, and protein functions. BMV has been used as a model to study gene expression, RNA replication, virus-host interactions, recombination, and encapsidation by positive-strand RNA viruses. Major contributions have revealed insights and principles extending to many other viruses and to general cell biology. Among numerous advances, research in BMV defined the first ribosome binding sites in eukaryotic mRNAs, produced the first eukaryotic viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) extract that was template specific, the first infectious transcripts from cloned cDNA, the first engineered RNA virus expression vector expressing foreign genes, the first definition of sub-genomic mRNA synthesis pathways and determinants, and the first demonstration of higher eukaryotic viral replication in yeast. BMV has contributed many insights into virion assembly, virus-host interactions, RNA recombination, and RNA replication, including parallels in the replication of positive-strand RNA, reverse-transcribing and dsRNA viruses.",

Cryo-electron microscope reconstructions and subsequently x-ray crystallography showed that the BMV capsid structure is extremely similar to that of the related bromovirus Cowpea chlorotic mottle virus (CCMV). Intriguingly, some features of these capsids are dissimilar from other known isometric RNA virus capsids, but similar to capsids of the DNA-containing papovaviruses. These features include orientation of the core \u03b2-barrel nearly perpendicular to the capsid surface to form distinctively prominent hexameric and pentameric capsomeres, and linking of adjacent capsomere clusters by exchange of invading C-terminal arms. These shared features suggest that BMV CP and the CPs of polyoma- and papillomaviruses likely share a common ancestor. BMV virion RNA is arranged as an interior subshell inside the capsid, leaving a hollow virion center. The N-terminal 26 aa of the CP, which are highly basic and required for RNA packaging, interact with the RNA to neutralize its charge.",

Heavy virions contain a single copy of RNA1 (3.2 kb), medium density virions contain one copy each of RNA3 (2.1 kb) and RNA4 (0.9 kb), and light virions contain a single copy of RNA2 (2.9 kb). The three classes of viral particles are indistinguishable by electron microscopy, however, distinct capsid-RNA contacts influence the stability of the virions, viral RNA release, and BMV infection. Mapping of the contacts made between CP and the viral RNAs showed that RNA1 contacts CP differently than RNA2 or RNA3/4. Virions containing RNA1 were more sensitive to protease digestion and treatment of virions with RNase A revealed that RNA1 was preferentially degraded, while RNA2 or RNA3/4 were more resistant to RNase A digestion. The more facile interaction between RNA1 and the capsid proteins could ensure earlier and higher expression of BMV 1a, which is responsible for the formation of the viral replication compartments (see below in the Section of \u201cProperties and Functions of Viral Gene Products\u201d). The interaction of the viral RNAs with capsid is also influenced by the phosphorylation state of the N-terminal arm of the capsid protein. Interestingly, virions produced from different plant hosts had different post-translational modifications that impacted the thermostability of virions as well as the capsid-RNA interactions.",

Although early infectivity studies showed that RNA3 encodes CP, tryptic analysis showed that the principle translation product of RNA3 was unrelated to CP, while RNA4 served as an excellent template for CP. Moreover, when mixtures of all BMV RNAs were added to wheat germ extracts, increasing amounts of RNA4 inhibited translation of genomic RNAs 1\u20133. These results showed that RNA4 is a sub-genomic CP mRNA derived from RNA3, and implied an elegant system of gene regulation by translational competition: early in infection when viral RNA concentrations are low, all viral proteins including nonstructural RNA replication factors are translated, while after the virion RNAs are sufficiently amplified, CP is preferentially translated to encapsidate these RNAs.",

In 1975, the first eukaryotic translation initiation site was characterized by isolating two fragments of BMV RNA4 that were efficiently bound by wheat germ ribosomes. RNA sequencing (a challenging, chromatography-based process at the time) revealed that the two fragments were 5\u2032 terminal, overlapping, and encoded the first 4 and 14 aa of CP, respectively. The most distinguishing feature was that the initiating AUG codon for CP began only 10 nucleotides from the m7G5\u2032ppp5\u2032Gp-capped RNA4 5\u2032 end, presaging the now well-known mechanistic linkage between most eukaryotic translation initiation and 5\u2032 mRNA caps.",

Later work discussed below showed that 3a is required for infection movement in plants. Comparisons with other emerging viral RNA and protein sequences quickly revealed that the BMV 1a and 2a proteins, already implicated in RNA replication by protoplast experiments, shared extensive amino acid sequence similarities with proteins encoded by a diverse set of plant and animal positive-strand RNA viruses. These similarities initially were recognized between BMV, Alfalfa mosaic virus, Tobacco mosaic virus and Sindbis virus, and subsequently were found to extend to many other viruses now grouped together as the alphavirus-like super-family. Similarities shared by these viruses include a polymerase domain in BMV 2a (hereafter 2apol) and RNA capping and RNA helicase-like domains in 1a (Fig. 1).",

Beginning in the 1970s, further sequencing, enzymatic structure probing, and three-dimensional computer modeling showed that the 3\u2032 ~200 nt of all BMV RNAs were strongly conserved and folded into an extended, tRNA-like structure with at least two alternate forms that differed in pairing nucleotides near the 3\u2032 with local or distal partners.

Deletion analysis revealed that, in addition to 3\u2032 and 5\u2032 sequences required for negative- and positive-strand RNA initiation, BMV RNA3 replication in vivo requires a segment of ~150 nt in the 5\u2032 half of the intergenic non-coding region between the 3a and CP genes (Fig. 1). Subsequent studies showed that this region is required for a step prior to negative-strand RNA synthesis, and is necessary and sufficient for 1a to recognize and recruit an RNA to a membrane-associated, translationally inaccessible, nuclease-resistant state that appears to be the interior of the replication compartments, also known as spherules (see the Section \u201cBMV 1a and Viral Replication Compartments\u201d). Structure probing studies show that this intergenic RNA3 sequence folds into a long, bulged stem-loop, which presents at its apex the invariant sequence and structure of tRNA T\u03a8C stem-loops. In plant and yeast cells, the appropriate BMV residues in this consensus are modified to T and \u03a8, showing that, like the 3\u2032 end, this sequence interacts in vivo with tRNA-specific enzymes. Moreover, any mutations to this T\u03a8C stem-loop mimicry abolish 1a-mediated template recruitment. Similar stem-loops with apical T\u03a8C stem-loop regions are found at the extreme 5\u2032 ends of BMV RNA1 and RNA2, where they similarly direct 1a-mediated template recruitment (Fig. 1).",

This first elucidation of a pathway for sub-genomic mRNA synthesis appears to provide a meaningful precedent for similar sub-genomic mRNA synthesis by many positive-strand RNA viruses, and an important foundation for understanding the diversity of alternate mechanisms that has begun to emerge with the demonstration of distinctly different sub-genomic mRNA synthesis pathways used by coronaviruses, nodaviruses and some other positive-strand RNA viruses.",

Subsequent work demonstrated many forms and features of inter- and intra-molecular, homologous and non-homologous RNA recombination in BMV. Mutations in BMV RNA replication proteins 1a and 2apol could alter the frequencies and distributions of crossover sites, implying that at least a significant portion of such recombination was a byproduct of RNA replication, as by template switching. These and other results show that RNA recombination is a major force for repairing BMV genomes damaged by the high mutation rates of viral RNA replication and other events, thereby contributing to BMV survival and adaptability. Subsequently, it was further demonstrated that the recruitment of parental RNAs to a shared replication compartment is a limiting step in intermolecular RNA recombination. These results support a model in which BMV genomic RNAs are individually recruited into replication compartments, and intermolecular recombinants arise only in replication compartments receiving multiple viral RNAs.",

Similar membrane invaginations are seen in plant cells infected by viruses from Bormoviridae, Tombusviridae, and Tymoviridae families, and in animal cells infected by viruses in and beyond the alphavirus-like super-family. However, in BMV-infected N. benthamiana cells, there are three types of polymorphic vesicles that are associated with cytoplasmic ER membranes but are absent from the perinuclear ER region. Type 1 vesicles are ~66 nm in diameter with some spherule-like structures that remain connected to the ER through neck-like structures and as such, type 1 vesicles resemble those formed in yeast cells. Type 2 vesicles are ~359 nm in diameter and likely are induced by CP. Type 3 vesicles are most probably formed by fusing type 1 and type 2 vesicles. Some possible reasons for the differences in BMV-induced membrane rearrangements between yeast and N. benthamiana are likely due to the organization and lipid composition of the ER membranes in yeast and N. benthamiana or possible variation in relative protein expression levels and replication efficiency in each system.",

The reticulons were shown to stabilize the membrane curvature in the neck of the spherules and to also regulate the size and number of spherules.

One group of ESCRT genes regulate BMV RNA replication and the frequency of spherule formation while a second group of genes regulate RNA replication independent of spherule formation. In particular, deleting SNF7 significantly reduced viral replication and abolished detectable spherule formation. The current model suggests that BMV 1a initiates the invagination of the perinuclear ER, followed by recruitment of Snf7p and other ESCRT components to constrict the wide membrane rim, allowing the formation of the spherule body and neck.
