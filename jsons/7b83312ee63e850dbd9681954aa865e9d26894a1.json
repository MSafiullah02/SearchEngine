The clinical manifestations of cytokine storm observed in COVID-19 patients could be linked to a dysfunction of the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway. At the same time, several patients experience neurological symptoms that could be explained by the invasion of the virus to the terminal area of afferent vagus fibers or the origin of the efferent vagus fibers, and further dysregulation of the inflammatory response. Anosmia has been experienced by several patients, a phenomenon that has been observed in patients with Parkinson's disease and is caused by impaired cholinergic transmission. Thromboembolic complications, activation of platelets and endothelial damage with increased vascular permeability indicate ineffective control by the nicotinic cholinergic system.

More than 170,000 deaths have been reported, while there are certainly many more cases of milder disease that have not been diagnosed and officially confirmed due to limited testing capacity in most countries. The pandemic is a global emergency due to the rapid transmission of the disease and the potential to overwhelm the healthcare systems, and is expected to have considerable economic and health impacts. Possible contributing factors, their possible role in the relatively high infection, death rates between countries and origin have recently been studied (Goumenou et al. 2020a , Goumenou et al. 2020b ). This new outbreak has been additionally evaluated for current knowledge on coronaviruses based on a short history to epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical manifestation of the disease, as well as treatment and prevention strategies (Docea et al 2020) . The search for potential protective and therapeutic antiviral strategies is of particular and urgent concern (Skalny et al., 2020) .",

Predictors of adverse outcomes include J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f elevated levels of inflammatory markers and pro-inflammatory cytokines. A study of 150 COVID-19 cases reported that elevated levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), ferritin and IL-6 were associated with death (Ruan et al., 2020) . IL-6, an important pro-inflammatory cytokine, was elevated in fatal cases of COVID-19 in another study of 191 patients (Zhou et al., 2020) . Another study of 452 patients reported that those with severe disease showed lymphocytopenia, neutrophilia, low levels of monocytes, eosinophils and basophils, and elevated levels of infection-related biomarkers and inflammatory cytokines (Qin et al., 2020) . Pathological examination of a case in China revealed bilateral diffuse alveolar damage, desquamation of pneumocytes, hyaline membrane formation and interstitial mononuclear inflammatory infiltrates (Xu et al., 2020) . Flow cytometry of peripheral blood revealed reduced levels of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, which however were hyper-activated, and elevated concentration of proinflammatory CCR6+ Th17 in CD4+ T cells. Such findings are hallmarks of ARDS and resemble features observed in SARS and Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome (Ng et al., 2016; Ding et al., 2003) . Systemic vasculitis was also observed (Xu et al., 2020) . Therefore, it seems that immune dysregulation may be implicated in the pathophysiology of severe COVID-19.",

            "text": "While for decades common thinking suggested that every immune response to antigenic invasion was always beneficial in averting potential damage, studies in the 1980s identified that immune cells produce proteins with pleiotropic properties, having the potential to be either beneficial or harmful (Tracey, 2007) . The proteins, called cytokines, were found to cause clinical manifestations similar to sepsis such as hemodynamic instability, fever, and localized inflammation (Tracey et al., 1986; Dinarello et al., 1986) . Cytokines are important in mediating both immune cell recruitment and complex intracellular signaling control mechanisms that They are expressed by numerous cells,   including macrophages, monocytes, B cells and T cells, promote differentiation of T-helper cells and stimulate CD4+ cells (Turner et al., 2014) . While activation of the immune system is important in fighting pathogens, dysregulation of cytokine production may lead to uncontrolled effects that can ultimately be detrimental to health (Dinarello, 2007; Turner et al., 2014) . Several animal experimental models inducing pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as sepsis, ischemia-reperfusion and pancreatitis have shown that vagus stimulation improves outcomes. This effect is mediated by the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) \u03b17 subunit on macrophages (Wang et al., 2003) . Mice deficient of the \u03b17 subunit exhibited increased endotoxin-induced TNF production, and electrical vagus innervation failed to reduce serum TNF levels (Wang et al., 2003) . B-lymphocytes also express \u03b17 nAChRs. Macrophages appear to be very sensitive to acetylcholine, which suggests that any source of acetylcholine, even from nonneuronal sources such as epithelial and endothelial cells, could also modulate the activity of adjacent macrophages (Tracey, 2002) . Besides TNF, other pro-inflammatory cytokines are inhibited by acetylcholine, such as high mobility group B1 (HMGB1), IL-1, and IL-6 (Ulloa, 2005 ).",

In 2018, the population smoking prevalence was 26.6% with a much higher prevalence in men (50.5%) than in women (2.1%) (World Health Organization, 2018). Therefore, a high smoking prevalence among patients with COVID-19 would be expected, even if smoking did not adversely affect disease susceptibility and severity. It is obviously inappropriate to suggest that anyone should initiate smoking or to continue to smoke due to the well-established smoking-related morbidities and the large number of potentially toxic chemicals in cigarette smoke. Furthermore, it is unlikely that any other compound in tobacco cigarette smoke, besides nicotine, would be implicated to the potential benefits observed in smokers. Moreover, due to the adverse effects of smoking and the fact that many smokers would suffer from co-morbidities (such as cardiovascular disease, COPD etc.), it is expected that the potential benefits of nicotine would be blunted when observed in smokers.",

Venous thromboembolism was reported in 25% of patients who were not under thromboprophylaxis, and was associated with higher mortality rate (Cui et al., 2020) . Abnormal coagulation parameters were also associated with poor survival (Tang et al., 2020) . Although antagonists of acetylcholine on \u03b17-nACh receptor with high affinity, we decided to explore the hypothesis that SARS-CoV-2 may have acquired sequences by any of the potential, and not defined yet, intermediates through genomic recombination. We compared the protein sequences between SARS-CoV-2 and snake venom neurotoxins. We were able to identify regions with four or five amino acids homology between the coronavirus and several neurotoxin molecules (e.g. SARS-CoV-2 compared with alpha Bungarotoxin, Fig 1A; SARS-CoV-2 and alpha-Cobratoxin, Fig 1B) . J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Therefore, we hypothesize that these sequences on the SARS-CoV-2 proteins, being similar to the active sites of a neurotoxin, can result in binding to nAChRs and adversely affecting their function by preventing the action of acetylcholine.",

The uncontrolled action of pro-inflammatory cytokines will result in the development of cytokine storm, with acute lung injury leading to ARDS, coagulation disturbances and multiorgan failure. Based on this hypothesis, COVID-19 appears to eventually become a disease of the nicotinic cholinergic system. Nicotine could maintain or restore the function of the cholinergic anti-inflammatory system and thus control the release and activity of pro-inflammatory cytokines. This could prevent or suppress the cytokine storm. This hypothesis needs to be examined in the laboratory and the clinical setting.",

            "text": "Cytokine storm (also called macrophage activation syndrome) is a systemic inflammatory response that can be triggered by a variety of factors such as infections and drugs (Shimabukuro-Vornhagen et al., 2018). It represents a failure of the inflammatory response to return to homeostasis. The resulting unregulated immune activity can potentially lead to catastrophic tissue damage. The term first appeared in 1993 in an article relevant to graft-versus-host disease (Ferrara et al., 1993). Subsequently, cytokine storm was a phenomenon recognized in both viral and bacterial infections. It has been particularly studied in viral infections such as cytomegalovirus pneumonitis, influenza virus and SARS-CoV (Barry et al., 2000; Bermejo-Martin et al., 2009; Huang et al., 2005; Tisoncik et al., 2012). Bermejo-Martin et al. (2009) recruited both inpatients and outpatients during the first wave of the pandemic flu in 2009 (nvH1N1) and examined the effects of immune host responses to the evolution of mild or severe disease by measuring serum levels of several chemokines and cytokines. They found a dramatic increase of mediators that stimulate Th-1 responses and Th-17 responses (which are responsible for attacking intracellular pathogens and clearing pathogens during host defence reactions) among severe hospitalized patients compared to milder cases of nvH1N1 infection during the 2009 pandemic. The cytokine storm can result in acute lung injury and further progress to ARDS. This is characterized by local infiltration of inflammatory cells, increased vascular permeability and systemic spillover of inflammatory mediators that can cause systemic sepsis-J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f like symptoms (Tisoncik et al., 2012). While focus on cytokine storm detection relies mostly on measuring cytokines in the systemic circulation, it has been suggested that measuring systemic inflammatory mediators may underestimate the extent of the immunological cascade that takes place locally in deep tissues such as the respiratory tract (Tisoncik et al., 2012). Considering the above, controlling the inflammatory response may be an effective way of preventing collateral damage caused by the excessive activation of the immune system to clear pathogens.Cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathwaySince the early 2000s, the cholinergic nervous system has been identified as an important pathway that modifies and controls the inflammatory response. Surgical dissection of the vagus nerve in mice led to enhanced TNF production and excessive response to endotoxin administration, while vagus nerve electrical stimulation inhibits the synthesis of TNF and prevents the acute inflammatory response(Borovikova et al., 2000;Tracey 2002;Blalock, 2002).",

The analysis was further expanded on 3 April by examining 13Chinese studies and 5960 hospitalized COVID-19 patients, with a pooled smoking prevalence of 6.5% (95% CI: 4.9-8.2%)(Farsalinos et al., 2020b). On that date, we presented for the first time a hypothesis about the potential beneficial effects of nicotine, which was subsequently expanded(Farsalinos et al., 2020c). While there were limitations in the study analysis, mainly due to the inability to adjust for confounding factors, the findings of low smoking prevalence among hospitalized COVID-19 patients in China were consistent across all studies and in agreement with case series from USA (CDC, 2020; Richardson et al., 2020). The original hypothesis was based on the anti-inflammatory properties of nicotine through the cholinergic anti-inflammatory system, acknowledging that the disease appeared to involve a dysregulation of the immune response to viral invasion.",

            "text": "HMGB1 while it does not inhibit anti-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-10 (Li et al., 2011; Ulloa, 2005). In vivo animal models found nicotine to be protective against lipopolysaccharide-induced ARDS by reducing leukocyte infiltration and proinflammatory mediators in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (Ni et al., 2011; Mabley et al., 2011).Such effects are relevant to COVID-19 since cytokine storm appears to be the hallmark in severe cases(Mehta et al., 2020; Huang et al., 2020). Several pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1\u03b2, IL-2, IL-6, IL-17, IL-8, TNF and CCL2 are elevated in COVID-19 patients (McGonagle et al., 2020). Treatment with anti-IL-6 anti-TNF medications has been proposed and clinical trials are already underway (Feldmann et al., 2020; Georgiev et al., 2020). However, it may be more effective to inhibit several instead of selectively one cytokine, while some cytokine inhibitors are associated with elevated risk of opportunistic infections (Rutherford et al., 2018). Also, it is possible that measuring blood levels of inflammatory cytokines does not accurately reflect the extent of the immune imbalance that exists locally in the lungs. In any case, the cholinergic antiinflammatory system provides better control and modulation of the cytokine response compared to blocking a single agent, and nicotine could effectively contribute to maintaining a balanced immune response against viral infection. Therefore, it is possible that the clinical manifestations of cytokine storm in COVID-19 patients are the result of dysfunction of the cholinergic antiinflammatory pathway. SARS-CoV-2 is known to use the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as a receptor for cell entry (Zhang et al., 2020). ACE2 has well-established vasodilatory, anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. Studies on smoking and ACE2 are contradictory. Studies published before the COVID-19 pandemic reported that smoking and nicotine down-regulate ACE2 (Oakes et al., 2018; Yue et al., 2018). However, more recent studies suggest that they up-regulate ACE2 (Cai et al., 2020; Leung et al., 2020; Blake et al., 2020). There is currently no evidence to suggest that up-regulation of ACE2 is associated with increased COVID-19 susceptibility or severity. In fact, up-regulation of ACE2 appears to be protective against tissue damage caused by SARS-CoV-2. ACE2 has been found to protect mice from developing ARDS (Hung et al., 2016; Imai et al., 2008; Imai et al., 2005). Data from SARS experimental studies suggest that continuous SARS-CoV-2 infection and replication induces immediate down-regulation of ACE2 that may be implicated in organ damage and disease severity (Vaduganathan et al., 2020). Further support for the beneficial role of ACE2 comes from data that estrogens appear to upregulate ACE2 while children and younger adults have higher ACE2 levels compared to older people (Christiani et al., 2020; Ciaglia et al., 2020). At the same time, women, children and young people have milder COVID-19 symptoms. If accurate and verified, the recently-observed ACE2 up-regulation in smokers is probably induced as a defence mechanism to counteract the effects of angiotensin II. There is probably a dynamic balance between ACE and ACE2, which is continuously changing, depending on stressors and stimuli. Thus, there is uncertainty on whether nicotine affects COVID-19 progression through the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone axis and there is no known interaction between ACE2 and nAChR receptors. Importantly, ACE2 is expressed in several regions in the brain. The regions where vagal afferent fibers terminate and vagal efferent fibers originate exhibit ACE2 expression (Xia &Lazartigues, 2010; Dubay et al., 2006). Neuroinvasion is a common feature of coronaviruses (Desfroges et al., 2020). Anosmia and ageusia have been reported by COVID-19 patients (Giacomelli et al., 2020). SARS-CoV-2 may enter the CNS either through the blood stream or via the olfactory nerve across the cribriform plate (Manji et al., 2020; Baig et al., 2020). A case series of 214 patients reported that 36.4% had neurological manifestations (Mao et al., 2020). Thus, it is possible that J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f the virus might infect the terminal areas of vagus afferent fibers or the origin of vagus efferent fiber causing down-regulation of ACE2 and resulting in local inflammation that could disrupt the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway and dysregulate the inflammatory response. Nicotine could have protective properties against possible brain inflammation caused by SARS-CoV-2, mediated through \u03b17-AChRs (Bencherif et al., 2011). A noteworthy parameter relative to anosmia and ageusia observed among COVID-19 patients is that these are characteristic and prodromal non-motor manifestations of Parkinson's disease (Oppo et al., 2020; Haehner et al., 2011). While ageusia has not been extensively studied, olfactory disturbance is a very common feature, observed in up to 95% of Parkinson's disease patients (Haehner et al., 2011) and this symptom may appear several years before the onset of motor symptoms. There is no olfactory improvement with dopamine agonists (Doty et al., 1988; M\u00fcller et al., 2002). Unlike the general population where smoking is associated with impaired olfactory function, smokers with Parkinson's disease experience less decline in olfactory sense compared to non-smokers, suggesting a protective effect of smoking (Sharer et al., 2015). This is explained by the fact the phenomenon has been linked to impairment of cholinergic transmission (Bohnen et al., 2010) while nicotine improved the olfactory impairment in a mouse model of Parkinson's disease (Yang et al., 2019). The olfactory bulb has a rich network of nAChRs, but \u03b17 nAChRs may also be expressed on the axon terminals of the olfactory receptor neurons (D'Souza & Vijayaraghavan, 2014). While this may suggest facilitated brain infection through anterograde transport along the olfactory nerve, it is possible that olfactory receptor neurons may act as first-line viral sensors and initiate a rapid immune response (Butowt & Bilinska, 2020).This would explain the mild symptoms in COVID-19 patients with olfactory loss.In any case,",

            "text": "venous thromboembolism is a well-known risk factor of any serious infection, additional mechanisms such as endothelial damage, increased vascular permeability and microvascular occlusion may be implicated in COVID-19 (Kollias et al., 2020). It is important to note that platelets express functional \u03b17-AChRs (Schedel et al., 2011) while hematopoietic \u03b17 nAChR deficiency increases inflammation and platelet activity (Kooijman et al., 2015). Recently, acetylcholine was found to be an endogenous inhibitor of platelet activation (Bennett et al., 2019). Therefore, dysfunction of the nicotinic cholinergic system could be implicated in the thrombotic and vascular complications of COVID-19. COVID-19 could be a disease of the nicotinic cholinergic system The observation of a low prevalence of hospitalized COVID-19 patients in China led to the development of a hypothesis that nicotine could have protective effects by enhancing the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway (Farsalinos et al., 2020b). As more studies presented the clinical manifestations, laboratory findings and disease progression in COVID-19 patients, it became apparent that the nicotinic cholinergic system could explain most (if not all) of the disease characteristics. It would be unlikely for a single \"defence system\" to ameliorate all the J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f diverse and complex manifestations of COVID-19, unless that \"defence mechanism\" was the target of the viral host. Could that be possible? SARS-CoV-2 appears to have originated from a bat coronavirus. Ji et al. (2020) carried out comprehensive sequence analysis in conjunction with relative synonymous codon usage bias and reported that the virus may have been a recombinant virus between the bat coronavirus and an unknown-origin coronavirus (Ji et al., 2020). One possible intermediate host could have been a snake coronavirus. Taking into consideration that snake venom toxins are competitive",

Besides gums and patches, nicotine can be administered though inhalation, with the use of a nebulizer or other aerosol systems, if necessary. Nicotine administration could be added on top of antiviral or other therapeutic options for COVID-19. By restoring and re-activating the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway, a more universal suppression of the cytokine storm could probably be achieved compared to administering inhibitors of a single cytokine. The potential need to provide pharmaceutical nicotine products to smokers and users of other nicotine products who experience abrupt withdrawal symptoms of nicotine when hospitalized for COVID-19 or aim to follow medical advice to quit smoking,should also be examined. Additionally, if the hypothesis about the beneficial effects of nicotine is valid, smokers who quit nicotine use when hospitalized will be deprived from these benefits.",
