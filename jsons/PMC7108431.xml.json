Increasingly, greater emphasis is being paid on PM2.5 due to its serious health implications [1], [2], [3]. Removal of particulate matter is commonly achieved through the use of porous filters. In addition to particulate matter, other harmful chemicals and biological contaminants in air also need to be addressed.

Besides silver, some metal oxides have also been found to have disinfecting properties. Metal oxides such as ZnO are reported to be used in antibacterial cream, lotions and ointments [13]. CuO has been found to express activity against bacterial pathogens such as methicillin resistant strain of Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli\n[14].

On the extreme end of the spectrum, chemical warfare agents such as nerve gas, mustard agent, blood agents and toxins such as arsine pose a serious health risk. These chemical contaminants are broadly characterized as organophosphorus (OP) nerve agents, which break down the acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter located at the nerve endings [17], [18], [19], [20], [21], [22], [23], [24]. Paraoxon, is an example of a chemical warfare agent simulant which is widely used as a pesticides [23]. A method used by the military to combat these chemical contaminants in air is to pass the air through a liquid known as DS2 comprising of 2% NaOH, 28% 2-methoxyethanol and 70% diethylene triamine [25]. Other solutions to remove chemical contaminants from air are through adsorption with activated carbon or other carbon based materials being employed. More recently, nano-silver and other metal oxide nanoparticles such as ZnO, CuO, TiO2, were found to hydrolyze these chemical contaminants through the Lewis and Bronsted and the acidic sites [26], [27], [28]. Other studies have also confirmed that the use of metal oxide nanoparticles such as Al2O3, Fe2O3, TiO2 and MgO could serve as an effective catalyst against chemical warfare agents [29], [30], [31] and potentially other chemicals in air as well.",

More importantly, we have developed a filter that is able to achieve high contaminant removal rates, while also allowing high mass transfer through it or low resistance. This is critical, as better protection is typically achieved at the expense of higher energy to push air through the filter. To achieve this, we have worked with nanofibers, which have been shown to have smaller resistance when compared to spun-bound or melt blown microfibers that are commonly used for air filtration [32]. More specifically, air filters comprising of PVDF nanofibers, blended with silver and aluminum oxide nanoparticles were produced by electrospinning. The produced filters were characterized and studied for their effectiveness in removing particulate matter; bacteria and a model OP compound i.e. paraoxon.",

After electrospinning, the nanofibrous metal oxide membranes (M1, M2, M3, M4, M5 and control) are dried for a day at room temperature for the solvents to evaporate. The dried membrane was heat treated (post treatment) at 135 \u00b0C for 15\u201320 min. The silver nanoparticles on the surface of the nanofibers were found to increase upon treating with UV light [35]. Thus, the membranes were kept under UV light for about 20 min to make sure that all the silver nitrate is photoreduced to silver nanoparticles [36], which can be observed by the color change of the membranes from yellow to brownish black. The concentration of Al2O3 cannot go beyond 8% for 15% PVDF. This is because for more than 8% Al2O3 the viscosity increases to an extent where the solution cannot be electrospun. Thus, for 15% PVDF solution, the maximum electrospinnable Al2O3 concentration is 8%.",

In addition to the fibers, we can also find the Al2O3 nanoparticles attached onto the nanofibers. The presence of Al2O3 nanoparticles on the surface of the membrane was confirmed by comparing EDX images of the membrane samples with nanoparticles. From the SEM images, we can visualize that the amount of Al2O3 in M5 is higher than the rest of the membranes and is confirmed by the EDX measurements. We can also see that the amount of silver is almost the same in all the EDX spectrums. This shows that the developed composite membranes contain Ag and Al2O3 nanoparticles, which can disinfect microorganisms and detoxify chemical pollutants respectively that come into contact with the membrane. The Java image processing software [Image J1.29 (222 commands)] was used to measure the diameter of the fibers from the SEM images. Table 1\nshows the average membrane diameters of M1, M2, M3, M4 and M5. It was found that the fiber diameter is 0.85 \u03bcm for M5 which is higher than the rest of the membranes and might be due the presence of the increased metal oxide nanoparticles after post treatment as seen in the SEM images.

All the membranes with silver cleared the E.\ncoli bacteria around them and we observed distinct zones of inhibition (clear areas with no bacterial growth) around the membranes. The width of the zone around the control PVDF membrane, M1, M2, M3, M4 and M5 was about 0, 6.5, 6, 5, 5.5 and 5 mm. This attributes to the bactericidal property of silver nanoparticles in the composite membranes, where silver is a well known antibacterial material. It was found that, as the concentration of Al2O3 increases, the zone of inhibition decreases slightly, which is due to the decrease in exposure of silver nanoparticles present on the surface as Al2O3 is added to the membrane. However, Al2O3 also has antibacterial property, but of less activity than the silver. It was also observed that the zone of inhibition hardly changed even if the samples were kept for about 1 week at room temperature, showing that the antibacterial property of the membrane is effective and durable. In contrast, the PDVF membrane exhibits no zone of inhibition under the same conditions and high bacterial growth near the sample was detected. These results indicated that the incorporation of Ag and Al2O3 nanoparticles have in turn incorporated the antibacterial property into the nanofiber composite membranes, to disinfect the biological pollutants in air.",

This test was performed in triplicates and the antibacterial efficiency was found to be above 99% for all membrane samples except PDVF control which has no antibacterial activity as shown in Fig. 4\n. This proves that the composite nanofiber membranes are active against the E.\ncoli bacteria. This is mainly because of the silver, which is well known for the antibacterial activity and so is used in several applications. The results clearly indicate that the silver and the metal oxide particles exhibit its own antibacterial activity. We also observe that the M1 membrane has an average antibacterial efficiency of 99.66%, which is more than the other membranes. This is attributed to the more number of silver nanoparticles on the surface of the membrane, while the other membranes take up space for the metal oxide on its surface. The zone of inhibition test result supports this as well. In this study, a homogenous solution containing silver and Al2O3 nanoparticles was used as the spinning solution. Besides being exposed on the surface, silver particles are also embedded inside the nanofibers like the metal oxide nanoparticles that also have some antibacterial function. Some literature shows that the Ag+ ions can be released from the inside of electrospun nanofibers [37], [40], [41]. Due to this, the nanoparticles present, the porous structure and high surface area of the nanofiber membranes is said to have an excellent antibacterial activity. The antibacterial activity of the membranes can also be increased or decreased by adjusting the composition of the silver and Al2O3 nanoparticles in the membrane. Thus, the prepared hybrid composite membranes with silver and Al2O3 nanoparticles incorporated, has a broad spectrum antimicrobial property that can kill biological pollutants in air.",

The detoxification of the chemical pollutant Paraoxon occurs by hydrolysis into its simplest forms. Fig. 5\n(a) shows the trend of decrease in the concentration for paraoxon at 268 nm as the time increases from 0 to 120 min. The sample membranes and the control membrane were measured for the optical density using the UV spectrophotometer after stirring with paraoxon for the required time intervals. The measurements were then compared for the relative rate of hydrolysis of paraoxon. It was found that the membrane M5 reduces the paraoxon concentration relatively more than the other membranes. However from the figure, we can see that, as the concentration of Al2O3 increases, the decrease in paraoxon concentration increases constantly until 120 min. Fig. 5(b) shows the detoxification efficiency of the membranes along with the control sample. The detoxification efficiency was found to be increasing as the concentration of the Al2O3 increases. It was found that the efficiency increases to 36.47% for M5 membrane which is about 3.89% higher than M4, 14.85% higher than M3, 22.92% higher than M2, 32.41% higher than M1 and 35.81% higher than the PVDF control membrane.

This proves that the PVDF\u2013Ag\u20138% Al2O3 membrane is highly active against the paraoxon showing about 36.47% detoxification. Further, increased rate of hydrolysis of paraoxon can be achieved by increasing the amount of membrane tested or increasing the initial metal oxide concentration in the electrospun membranes.

Fig. 6\nshows the experimental filtration efficiencies of the nascent and nanoparticle loaded membranes at a face velocity of 26.67 cm/s and a flow rate of 32 Lpm. The M5 membrane is found to be highly efficient in filtering 0.36 micron size particles and is 99.17% efficient, which is 0.49%, 1.81%, 2.74%, 3.57% and 4.84% higher than the M4, M3, M2, M1 and nascent PVDF membrane respectively. The aerosol test was conducted in trials and the average particle filtration efficiency was calculated. Thus, the increasing order of the PFE of the membranes are found to be PVDF < PVDF\u2013Ag\u20130% Al2O3\n < PVDF\u2013Ag\u20132% Al2O3\n < PVDF\u2013Ag\u20134% Al2O3\n < PVDF\u2013Ag\u20136% Al2O3\n < PVDF\u2013Ag\u20138% Al2O3. This trend is due to the increase in the thickness of the membrane and the reduced pore size due to the addition of Al2O3 nanoparticles on to the membranes and hence the PFE increases with increasing concentration of Al2O3. This is evident from Table 1.",

The membrane structure, pore size, contact angle and resistance were shown to provide good air permeability and thus the membranes are suitable for air filtration applications. The antimicrobial and the detoxification efficiency of the membranes were also studied to show that the functionalized membrane can kill the pathogens and detoxify the chemical compounds that come into contact with them, which is an added functionality to the air filtration membranes. The detoxification and PFE efficiency of PVDF\u2013Ag\u20138% Al2O3 membrane is the highest when compared to the other hybrid composite membranes. The increase in removal efficiency by the best performing filter was compensated by an increase in filter resistance of approximately 10% over the un-modified filters. The filter resistance can be further reduced by adjusting the structure of the membrane and optimizing the attachment of the nanoparticles on the filter fibers.",
