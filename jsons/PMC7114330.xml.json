            "text": "OROV (Simbu serogroup) is transmitted mainly by the biting midge (Culicoides paraensis) and has been associated with dengue-like acute febrile illness. OROV fever has emerged over the past 40 years as a serious public health problem in tropical and subtropical areas of Central and South America, having caused at least 30 reported outbreaks involving more than half a million people (Watts et al., 1997, Pinheiro et al., 2004). Clinical features of OROV fever include abrupt onset of fever, chills, severe headache, dizziness, myalgia, arthralgia, nausea, and vomiting. About half of the patients have a recurrence of symptoms within 2\u201310 days after they become afebrile. Aseptic meningitis by OROV has been reported during outbreaks. All ages and both sexes appear to be equally susceptible to infection (LeDuc and Pinheiro, 1988). Similarly to OROV, CARV (Group C serogroup), GMAV (Guama serogroup), GROV (California encephalitis and Bunyamwera serogroups) and TCMV (Anopheles A serogroup) have also been associated with febrile illness in humans. These viruses are transmitted by mosquitoes and cause disease mainly in the South America countries (Brinton et al., 1993, Tavares-Neto et al., 2004, Jonkers et al., 1968, March and Hetrick, 1967, Travassos da Rosa et al., 1997, Iversson et al., 1993, Iversson, 1994). An antiviral therapy, if available, would be a very helpful intervention, reducing symptoms and disease period of OROV fever as well as of those febrile illnesses caused by other orthobunyaviruses. However, until the moment, there is not treatment or vaccine for these viral diseases, and a recent study demonstrated that these viruses are resistant to antiviral action of the ribavirin, a broad-spectrum antiviral drug (Livonesi et al., 2006).",

This system is able to block the spread of virus infection in the body, sometimes at the expense of accelerating the death of the infected cells. Interferons are divided into two types, type I and type II, both of which have antiviral activity (Sen, 2001, Galligan et al., 2006). The type I interferons include the IFN-\u03b1 and -\u03b2 and they are secreted by virus-infected cells, and exhibit multiple biologic properties including antiproliferative, antiviral, and immunomodulatory effects (Platanias et al., 1996, Stark et al., 1998, Goodbourn et al., 2000). The type II interferon present only one member, the IFN-\u03b3, which is not virus-inducible, but it is secreted by activated T lymphocytes and NK cells and shows antiviral activity directly, through the induction of effector molecules (e.g. nitric oxide), and indirectly, through enhanced antigen presentation and the induction of apoptosis (Boehm et al., 1997).",

Moreover, in vitro and/or in vivo experiments have demonstrated that IFN-\u03b1 is able to inhibit the replication of many viruses as: sandfly fever Sicilian (Crance et al., 1997), dengue (Diamond et al., 2000), severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (SARS CoV) (Tan et al., 2004, Str\u00f6her et al., 2004, Galligan et al., 2006), vaccinia (Liu et al., 2004), and ebola (Mahanty et al., 2003).

The IFN-\u03b1A doses used were 1000, 10,000, and 100,000 IU mL\u22121 (30 \u03bcL per mouse/day). The mice were treated intraperitoneally (i.p.) daily for 10 days.

IFN-\u03b1 had a significant antiviral effect in vitro on all studied orthobunyaviruses. The antiviral action observed was dependent on both administration timing (Table 1) and concentration of the drug (Fig. 1). In vivo experiments confirmed the antiviral activity of IFN-\u03b1 on OROV and GROV, but not on CARV, GMAV and TCMV, being that this antiviral activity was dependent on the administration period of the drug (Table 2, Table 3). The antiviral effect of IFN-\u03b1 observed in vivo was related to its ability to inhibit viral replication in the brain tissue of infected mice (Fig. 3, Fig. 4, Fig. 5). The antiviral action of exogenous IFN-\u03b1 observed in vitro was probably due to its ability to induce an antiviral state on cells through the secretion of proteins that ultimately inhibit viral replication. For instance, the dsRNA-dependent protein kinase (PKR) leads to phosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1 with a consequent blockade of translation of most cellular and viral mRNAs; the 2\u2032,5\u2032-oligoadenylate synthetases (OAS), which are also activated by viral dsRNA, produces 2\u2032,5\u2032-oligoadenylates that in turn activate the Rnase L, resulting in the degradation of viral and host RNAs; and the Mx proteins, GTPases of the dynamin family, whose mechanisms of action and functions await elucidation (Stetson and Medzhitov, 2006). Similarly, the antiviral effect observed in vivo after administration of exogenous IFN-\u03b1 might have been either due to the above-mentioned cell-intrinsic mechanisms of this cytokine or the actions of type I IFNs on the immune system. In fact, type I IFNs are able to enhance the expression of MHC class I proteins on cells and thereby promote CD8+ T cell response (Goodbourn et al., 2000). Moreover, type I IFNs play an essential role in the differentiation and function of effector CD8+ T cells (Stetson and Medzhitov, 2006). Type I IFNs are also able to enhance the cytotoxicity of NK cells by up-regulating the levels of perforins, and can stimulate the proliferation of NK cells to a limited degree (Stetson and Medzhitov, 2006). Ordinarily, CD8+ T and NK cells can eliminate infected cells, defending the host against intracellular infections (Stetson and Medzhitov, 2006). However, the mechanisms through which the exogenous IFN-\u03b1 performed its functions were not analysed in the present study.",

Brinton et al. (1993), corroborating the results obtained by us, observed that CARV resisted antiviral action of immmunomodulators, such as IFN-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b2. However, the escape mechanism of CARV was not studied by the authors. Rift Valey fever and Bunyamwera viruses presented resistance to the IFN system associated with the non-structural protein NSs which is encoded during viral replication. This protein showed to be able to block the production of IFN\u03b1/\u03b2 through the inhibition of transcription factors (Bouloy et al., 2001, Weber et al., 2002). Additionally, a recent study has demonstrated that the NSs protein is also able to inhibit the IFN response through the interaction with the MED8 component of Mediator, a protein complex necessary for mRNA production (L\u00e9onard et al., 2006). In our study, both cells and mice received high doses of exogenous IFN-\u03b1 and a possible inhibition of the production of endogenous IFN-\u03b1 by orthobunyaviruses would not be sufficient to block the antiviral effects derived from exogenous IFN-\u03b1. Moreover, it is known that Vero E6 cells have an IFN I gene deficiency and thus they are unable to express endogenous type I IFN (Mosca and Pitha, 1986). However, the IFN-dependent pathways are functional and can be activated by exogenously provided IFN (Mosca and Pitha, 1986). Thus, it is possible that the studied orthobunyaviruses present a escape mechanism similar to that recently described for Bunyamwera virus (L\u00e9onard et al., 2006), being able to inhibit the responses produced by IFN after association with the cell surface receptor. It would be interesting to further elucidate the escape mechanisms used by different bunyaviruses, especially those etiologically related to human diseases.",

Therefore, we cannot affirm whether other IFNs-\u03b1 would present a similar antiviral activity to that observed here. For instance, Tan et al. (2004) evaluated the in vitro antiviral activity of four types of IFN-\u03b1, Roferon\u00ae-A (IFN-\u03b1-2a), Intron A (IFN-\u03b1-2b), Wellferon (IFN-\u03b1-n1) and Alferon (IFN-\u03b1-n3), on SARS Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and observed that only two out of them, Wellferon and Alferon, were able to inhibit the cytophatic effect caused by this virus in Vero E6 cell cultures. Mechanisms for explaining these differences in activity of IFNs-\u03b1 are unknown. We may suppose that it could be related to distinct IFN-\u03b1 sources because some preparations are derived from human lymphoblastoid or leukocyte cells, while other preparations are recombinantly produced in Escherichia coli or mammalian cell culture (Foster and Finter, 1998). In particular, the IFNs-\u03b1 used in our experiments were the Roferon\u00ae-A and the IFN-\u03b1A, both produced in E. coli.",
