Flunarizine, a diphenylmethylpiperazine used to treat migraine, inhibited HCV cell entry in vitro and in vivo in a genotype-dependent fashion. Analysis of mosaic viruses between susceptible and resistant strains revealed that E1 and E2 glycoproteins confer susceptibility to flunarizine. Time of addition experiments and single particle tracking of HCV demonstrated that flunarizine specifically prevents membrane fusion. Related phenothiazines and pimozide also inhibited HCV infection and preferentially targeted HCV genotype 2 viruses. However, phenothiazines and pimozide exhibited improved genotype coverage including the difficult to treat genotype 3. Flunarizine-resistant HCV carried mutations within the alleged fusion peptide and displayed cross-resistance to these compounds, indicating that these drugs have a common mode of action. Conclusion: These observations reveal novel details about HCV membrane fusion; moreover, flunarizine and related compounds represent first-inclass HCV fusion inhibitors that merit consideration for repurposing as a cost-effective component of HCV combination therapies.

Finally, we administered flunarizine to HCV cell entry reporter mice, which express crucial human cofactors for HCV entry and carry a luciferase reporter gene that is activated by CRE recombinase. 12 When these animals were challenged with infectious Jc1 expressing a CRE recombinase, flunarizine serum levels reached an average of 133 nM, which is close to the in vitro median effective concentration value described above.

Therefore, Huh7-Lunet/ hCD81/G-Luc cells were inoculated with chimeric HCV viruses in the presence of increasing doses of flunarizine ( Fig. 2A) . All non-GT2 strains displayed resistance toward this drug with IC 50 values more than an order of magnitude greater than Jc1. The GT2b isolate showed an intermediate phenotype, with an IC 50 value of 3.69 mM; and both GT2a isolates, JFH1 and Jc1, were highly susceptible, displaying IC 50 values of 0.37 mM and 0.22 mM, respectively. To map the determinants of flunarizine susceptibility, we shuffled viral core to NS2 proteins between the resistant Con1 (GT1b) and the susceptible Jc1 (GT2a). Transfer of Con1-derived p7 into Jc1 did not render the resulting virus (Jc1/Con1-p7) resistant to flunarizine (Fig. 2B ). In contrast, insertion of the Con1derived E1 and E2 proteins into Jc1 did confer flunarizine resistance to Jc1/Con1-E1-E2. Conversely, replacement of the Con1-derived E1 and E2 sequences by those of Jc1 rendered the Con1 chimera (Con1-/J6-E1-E2) susceptible to the drug (Fig. 2B) . Therefore, susceptibility to flunarizine is governed by determinants resident in the E1 and E2 genes. Likewise, when we exchanged structural proteins, p7 or NS2 between J6 (GT2a) or J8 (GT2b), all viruses carrying the J6 E1 and E2 genes displayed greater susceptibility to flunarizine compared with those harboring the J8-derived glycoproteins (Supporting Fig.   S5A ). A chimeric virus carrying J8-derived E2 in the backbone of Jc1 produced infectious virus and exhibited partial resistance to flunarizine, indicating that determinants in both E1 and E2 influence susceptibility to this drug (Supporting Fig. S5B ). Next, we used HCV particles trans-complemented with primary E1 and E2 gene sequences from GT2a-infected and GT2b-infected patients. 13 Also, these clinical GT2a isolates were susceptible to flunarizine, whereas the GT2b isolates were resistant (Fig. 2C ). Finally, we created HCV transcomplemented particles carrying E1 and E2 proteins from six additional GT2 subtypes including d, e, k, m, q, and r. All of these strains were susceptible to inhibition by flunarizine, albeit to variable degrees (Fig. 2D ). Collectively, this indicates that flunarizine interferes with HCV entry by targeting viral E1 and E2 protein function(s) of almost all GT2 subtypes tested and with a clear preference for GT2 over other viral genotypes.",

            "text": "Flunarizine Inhibits HCV Membrane Fusion. To precisely define the mode of action of flunarizine, we conducted time-of-addition experiments including HCV entry inhibitors which arrest HCV infection at distinct stages of cell entry (Supporting Fig. S6 ). Because flunarizine resistance was reached at a time point similar to resistance to inhibitors of endosomal acidification (e.g., concanamycin A), this suggested that flunarizine inhibits a late entry step. To explore this further, we used an HCV plasma membrane fusion assay where cells are pretreated with concanamycin A to prevent viral entry and membrane fusion by the normal route through acidified endosomes (Fig. 4) . 7 Under these circumstances, HCV fusion and thus productive infection can be triggered by briefly exposing virus inoculated cells to a low pH buffer. Because HCV membrane fusion requires receptor interactions including binding to CD81, 14 the virus is receptive to this exogenous trigger (low pH buffer) only after incubation of approximately 1 hour at 378C. 7 Thus, Huh7-Lunet/hCD81 cells were continuously treated with concanamycin A and additional drugs were added either directly after virus inoculation and throughout the experiment until 4 hours post-temperature shift (Fig. 4A, protocol I) , only during the incubation with low pH buffer (protocol II), or only directly subsequent to the fusion triggering low pH wash (protocol III). A buffer with neutral pH 7 was used to control that productive infection fully depends on low pH-induced fusion. As expected, HCV infection only occurred when cells were exposed to low pH buffer because only then was luciferase expression above the background of uninfected cells detected (Fig. 4B) . When DMSO was added to the cells according to protocol I, II, or III, the low pH wash resulted in high luciferase activity, approximately 50-fold above the background of mock infected cells or virus inoculated cells treated with the neutral pH buffer (Fig. 4B) . Addition of bafilomycin A1, which like concanamycin A prevents acidification of endosomes, did not have an antiviral effect, regardless of the administration protocol. This confirms that HCV can only access cells by exogenous administration of low pH, independently of endosomal acidification. Moreover, all inhibitors had completely lost antiviral activity when applied directly after the low pH fusion trigger, indicating that they exert their antiviral activity by blocking HCV entry during or upstream of membrane fusion (Fig. 4B, protocol III) . Both BJ486K and flunarizine reduced HCV infection essentially to background levels when administered directly after virus inoculation and thus when present during virus trafficking at the cell surface (1 hour 378C) and the low pH fusion treatment. However, only flunarizine was fully antiviral when added selectively during the 5-minute low pH washing step (Fig. 4B, protocol  II) . Interestingly, viruses carrying the two E1 resistance mutations were no longer inhibited (Fig. 5C) , whereas the E2 mutation alone was not sufficient to confer flunarizine resistance in this fusion assay. These results indicate that flunarizine specifically targets HCV membrane fusion and that resistance is primarily mediated by two mutations within E1.",

We observed that flunarizine did not affect the localization of DiD-HCV to the tight junction (Fig. 5A,B) , nor did it affect the internalization and localization of DiD-HCV with the early endosome (Fig. 5C,D) .

Flunarizine is a T-type Ca 21 channel inhibitor and belongs to the group of diarylmethyl piperazine drugs. A range of structurally related drugs (e.g., pimozide) are known which also block Ca 21 ion channels and are used as antipsychotic drugs. 16 Moreover, phenothiazines such as fluphenazine and trifluoperazine are also important drugs in which the phenothiazine group resembles the biarylmethyl group. Indeed, all of these have emerged as potent HCV inhibitors in our screening (Supporting Fig. S1 ). Therefore, we explored if inhibition of Ca 21 ion channels in general is essential for the antiviral activity of these molecules. Furthermore, we investigated if these drugs inhibit HCV through an antiviral mechanism comparable to flunarizine. To address this we explored the influence of 1,2bis(o-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N 0 ,N 0 -tetraacetic acid and ethylene glycol tetraacetic acid, two Ca 21 -chelating agents, which sequester intracellular and extracellular Ca 21 pools, respectively, on the antiviral activity of flunarizine. Although both 1,2-bis(o-aminophenoxy) ethane-N,N,N 0 ,N 0 -tetraacetic acid and ethylene glycol Huh7-Lunet/hCD81/G-Luc cells were incubated with 5 nM concanamycin A 1 hour before virus inoculation and throughout the experiment until 4 hours post-virus inoculation. Additional drugs or DMSO were applied as indicated by black bars according to protocols denominated I, II, and III. F-Luc Jc1 particles were inoculated for 2 hours at 48C. Virus membrane fusion at the plasma membrane was triggered by washing cells with a pH 5 buffer (or a pH 7 buffer as control) for 5 minutes 1 hour after inoculated cells were shifted to 378C. In all treatments, cells were incubated another 48 hours at 378C before infection efficiency was quantified by luciferase assays.

Next, we explored if mibefradil, 17 penfluridol, 18 or NiCl 2 , 19 three well-established inhibitors of T-type Ca 21 channels, interfere with HCV infection. None of these molecules inhibited infection of parental HCV or flunarizine-resistant HCV (Fig. 6B) . In contrast, both phenothiazines (fluphenazine and trifluoperazine) and pimozide preferentially inhibited the parental virus and were less active against the variant with flunarizine resistance mutations. The antiviral activity of BJ486K 20 and curcumin, 21 two molecules that inhibit HCV cell entry by different molecular mechanisms, was not influenced by these mutations (Fig. 6B) . While this work was in preparation, Chamoun-Emanuelli et al. reported that selected phenothiazines inhibit HCV entry potentially by increasing the fluidity of cholesterol-rich membranes. 22 This prompted us to explore if viral susceptibility to flunarizine correlates with susceptibility to modulation of membrane fluidity achieved by depletion of cholesterol using methyl-beta-cyclodextrin. Interestingly, we observed that Jc1 was significantly more susceptible to cholesterol depletion than a GT5a virus, which has high endogenous flunarizine resistance (Fig.  6C) . Moreover, also the flunarizine-resistant Jc1 variant was significantly more resistant to depletion of cholesterol compared with the parental Jc1 (Fig. 6C ). This suggests that differences in the dependence of the HCV fusion machinery on membrane properties may in part determine susceptibility to flunarizine, phenothiazines, and pimozide. However, in our experiments these drugs did not modulate membrane fluidity (Supporting Fig.  S7 ) or cellular cholesterol content (Supporting Fig. S8 ), suggesting that other membrane changes are responsible for fusion inhibition.",

However, pimozide and fluphenazine displayed a much improved cross-genotype coverage, with IC 50 values below 10 mM for GT3a, GT5a, and GT7a in the case of pimozide and for GT3a, GT6a, and GT7a for fluphenazine (Fig. 7) . In conclusion, the antiviral activity of flunarizine and related compounds is not directly linked with their ability to inhibit Ca 21 ion channels.

Firstly, these drugs, which all inhibit cellular Ca 21 channels, may prevent fusion by changing Ca 21 fluxes in HCV target cells and/or by directly blocking the interaction of HCV with a Ca 21 channel critical for membrane fusion. However, not all tested Ca 21 channel targeting drugs also arrested HCV infection. Moreover, sequestration of Ca 21 did not modulate the antiviral activity of flunarizine. Therefore, we consider it unlikely that inhibition of Ca 21 channels by these drugs, which then would be used by HCV in a genotypedependent fashion, is responsible for the anti-HCV activity of this class of molecules.",

            "text": "Secondly, it is possible that flunarizine, pimozide, and phenothiazines directly bind E1 and E2, thereby inhibiting membrane fusion. The genotype specificity of the antiviral activity supports this notion as sequence variation may prevent drug binding. However, HCVpp carrying the same viral envelope proteins as flunarizinesusceptible HCVcc particles are not inhibited by flunarizine, arguing against this. Also, Chockalingam et al. 10 and Hu et al. 11 reported resistance of HCVpp to flunarizine, leading them to conclude that flunarizine is likely not an entry inhibitor. Our data, however, show that flunarizine inhibits entry of authentic HCV at the stage of membrane fusion. This highlights an as yet unexplored difference between the mode of HCVpp and HCVcc membrane fusion, which may arise because HCVpp are produced in 293T cells rather than in human liver cells. Consequently, HCVpp could differ in lipid and lipoprotein composition, thus affecting cell entry. Notably, it has been reported that receptor usage can differ between HCVcc and HCVpp, with only the former using the Niemann-Pick C1-like 1 cholesterol absorption receptor for cell entry. 23 Furthermore, Meertens and colleagues observed that cholesterol depletion of the host cell had no effect on the entry of HCVpp, whereas it was antiviral for HCVcc. 24 Therefore, the resistance mutations identified by us could be part of a direct drug binding site, or they could modulate the conformation and function of E1 and E2 in membrane fusion, which seems to be exquisitely cholesterol-dependent for HCVcc particles. The E1 domain from residue 264-290 has previously been implicated in harboring an HCV fusion peptide based on phylogenetic comparison with related flaviviruses, sequence conservation, and hydrophobicity. 25 The observation that drugs that specifically inhibit membrane fusion select for viral resistance in this region indirectly supports the notion that this peptide is critical for fusion. The crystal structures of E2 did not reveal evidence for a major role of E2 as a fusion protein, so E1 is now assumed to be the primary fusion protein of HCV. 26, 27 This is supported by earlier studies. [28] [29] [30] Finally, it is possible that these lipophilic drugs perturb membrane properties critical for virus membrane fusion. In fact, while this work was in preparation Chamoun-Emanuelli et al. reported that this was the case for specific phenothiazines including fluphenazine and trifluoperazine, also characterized by us. 22 Intriguingly, we observed a correlation between HCV susceptibility to flunarizine and susceptibility of HCV to cholesterol depletion-induced changes in membrane properties. This result is compatible with the notion that flunarizine and pimozide, like the phenothiazines, modulate membrane fluidity and that this is the antiviral principle of these groups of compounds. In turn, the genotype-specific antiviral activity of these molecules implies that viral strains differ with regard to membrane requirements during fusion. The cholesterol depletion experiment reported here, which shows that Jc1 is more susceptible to cholesterol depletion compared to the flunarizine-resistant Jc1 and to a flunarizine-resistant strain (GT5a), supports this notion. However, unlike Chamoun-Emanuelli et al. but consistent with Thomas and Verkleij, we did not observe a modification of membrane fluidity by flunarizine and related drugs. 31 This discrepancy between studies may be due to differences in the assay setup including the composition of liposomes (Supporting Fig. S7 ). Moreover, flunarizine and related compounds did not extract cholesterol from Huh-7.5 cells, even upon prolonged incubation (Supporting Fig. S8 ).",
