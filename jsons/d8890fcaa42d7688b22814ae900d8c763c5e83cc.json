The dominant response (25/26 subjects) was specific to the EBOV nucleocapsid protein (NP). It has been suggested that epitopes on the EBOV NP could form an important part of an effective T-cell vaccine for Ebola Zaire.",

For HIV and EBOV and influenza in particular, the potential of CTL vaccines has been discussed [21] [7] [56] . Although computational prediction alone has been used for T-cell vaccine design [2] [14], we saw a unique 10 opportunity to see if a preventative EBOV T-cell vaccine could be successfully designed based on the specific epitopes targeted by survivors of documented EBOV infection.",

ELISPOT analysis of PBMCs taken from the peripheral blood of COVID-19 controllers and progressors to assess the presence of a differential response to the 53 peptides could lead to a broadly applicable protective CTL vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 by incorporating peptides into the vaccine that are more commonly targeted for CD8+ attack by the controllers versus the progressors. A peptide vaccine for SARS-CoV-2, unlike a typical antibody vaccine, is not limited to virus surface antigen targets. This provides opportunities to attack other targets on SARS-CoV-2 besides spike which may be prone to mutation [74] . In addition, a peptide vaccine mitigates the risk of Antibody Disease Enhancement (ADE) seen in the context of a non-neutralizing antibody response to a whole protein vaccine [75] [55] . Also, neutralizing antibodies directed against spike protein in SARS-CoV-1 patients have been associated with an increased risk of Acute Lung Injury (ALI) [35] . Specifically, patients succumbing to SARS-CoV-1 were found to develop a neutralizing antibody (NAb) response to spike protein faster than survivors after the onset of symptoms and the NAb titers were higher in the patients who died compared with those who recovered [76] . To the extent to which antibody vaccines producing an antibody response against the spike protein in SARS-CoV-2 could increase the risk of ALI, this risk could also be mitigated by a using peptide vaccine as an alternative approach.",

Furthermore, Sakebe and Peng did not report progressor data perhaps because of the difficulty in obtaining blood samples from those patients. If researchers act now during the COVID-19 outbreak, perhaps controller and progressor blood samples could be collected and prospectively analyzed, quickly creating a database of optimal candidate class I peptides for inclusion into a CTL vaccine with potentially broad HLA coverage for subsequent rapid manufacture and deployment. It would be interesting to see the extent to which the peptides favored by controllers appear on SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid, making SARS-CoV-2 a second example, across two different viruses, of controllers exhibiting CTL attack preferentially on the nucleocapsid protein.",

We saw a paradoxical effect in control animals with survival increasing between 1,000PFU (Figure 3a) and 10,000 PFU (Figure 5a). We believe this was caused by innate immunity triggered by the very large maEBOV challenge. All mice in all vaccinated groups across both experiments survived and showed no morbidity by clinical observation scores and weight data. For each of the three challenge levels, the difference between the number of survivors in the vaccinated group versus the PBS control group was statistically significant by chi square (100 PFU P = 0.001; 1000 PFU P = 0.0003; 10,000 PFU P = 0.003).",

This epitope resides in a sequence conserved across multiple EBOV strains as shown in Supplementary Material Figure 6. A 7.3A O structure for NP and VP24 is shown for context in Figure 6a [67]. A 1.8A O resolution structure rendering for EBOV NP shown in Figure 6b illustrates that NP44-52 is a buried structural loop, which is likely to be important to the structural integrity of the EBOV NP protein [16].

Antigenic escape allows a virus to retain fitness despite an immune response to vaccination [20]. Picking conserved regions for vaccine targeting is an important part of mitigating this problem. Coronavirus spike protein, for example, may be particularly susceptible to mutation meaning that antigenic escape would be likely if the spike protein was targeted by a coronavirus vaccine, making it difficult to achieve durable protection. [74] A recent paper conducted a population genetic analysis of 103 SARS-CoV-2 genomesshowing that the virus has evolved into two major types: L and S, with changes in their relative frequency after the outbreak possibly due to human intervention resulting in selection pressure[62].We took all possible 424 9mer peptide sequences from the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein sequences available and evaluated each peptide for HLA restriction using NetMHC 4.0 and NetMHCpan 4.0[65][30][1]. We analyzed 9mer peptide sequences because these are often associated with superior MHC binding properties than class I peptides of other lengths [63][18]. We found 53 unique peptides with predicted binding below 500nM from NetMHC 4.0 and/or NetMHCpan 4.0. These results are shown in Supplementary Material",
