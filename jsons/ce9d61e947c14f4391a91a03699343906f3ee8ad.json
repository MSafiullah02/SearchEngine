            "text": "With 3 figures in the text) Relationships between body shape and relative abdominal size were compared among differentially elongate species within the scincid lizard genus Bruch.ymek.7, to investigate how morphological evolution affects the proportion of body volume available to hold eggs and offspring. Relative abdominal size is inversely related to elongation, suggesting that relative clutch mass decreases with addition of abdominal body segments. Shape-volume relationships contradict trends seen in comparisons among distantly related limbed and limbless squamates (lizards and snakes), in which snakes have relatively more abdominal volume. Comparison within a phylogenetically restricted group allows the identification of functional and ontogenetic factors potentially limiting reproductive output. In Bruchymeles, constraining factors include retention of anterior body segments bearing parasternal ribs, which prevents extension of the clutch anteriorly within the body, and reduction of allometry of abdominal segments, which provides extended series of uniformly-sized vertebrae for limbless locomotion, but reduces the relative size of the abdomen. The latter trait is associated with overall size reduction, which affects relative eggsize and packing. Factors constraining abdominal volume in this genus are probably common to other elongate lizards, a morphological group that has been rarely represented in comparative studies of life history.",

A common measure of reproductive output is relative clutch mass (RCM), a ratio of mass of the clutch relative to maternal mass (including or excluding clutch mass). Vitt & Congdon (1978) found that differences in body shape among lizards with different foraging modes accounted for much of the observed variation in RCM, and suggested that RCM could be predicted for given body shapes. In a recent quantitative study, Shine (1992) determined that differences in body morphology, expressed as a ratio of trunk volume: total mass, could account for the higher RCMs in snakes than in limbed lizards, and thus regarded body shape as having a role in constraining or explaining RCM. Relationships among lizards (from several families) were less clear, but there was some statistical correlation between shape and RCM.",

Perhaps because of unavailability of live animals or published data, comparative studies of life history have rarely exploited broad ranges of morphologies within more restricted groups (within families or genera).

Snakes are different from limbless lizards in several respects which may influence the amount of the trunk available to retain the clutch, including numbers of abdominal segments, and morphology and arrangement of internal organs. An elongate body, plus lack of limbs may lead to a high relative abdomen size in snakes (compared to 'typical' lizards), but it is unclear whether that same relationship would be obtained from a phylogenetically restricted comparison within lizards only. Limb-reduced lizards retain elements of saurian anatomy and morphology that are absent in snakes, and the degree to which ancestral traits are present varies among members of different families and genera. Depending on how elongation occurs (by increasing the number of abdominal segments, or their relative sizes), limb-reduced lizards may not have a relatively large available abdominal volume, despite overall elongation of the body.",

This result should provide a first relative estimate of RCM in limbless liLards, a phylogenetically diverse group that shows uniformity in numerous features (Gans, 1975) . In addition, through interspecific comparisons of anatomy and allometric growth within Brachymeles, ancestral features are identified in elongate species which influence abdominal size, and it is suggested that elongate lizards have constraints to body volume that have been overcome in the evolution of snakes.",

As in Shine (l992), I assumed that there is little variation in body distension, or relative 'fullness' of the abdomens of females of different species. This is a relatively strong assumption because of the restricted phylogenetic level of the present study. A more simple comparison of relative size of the abdomen involved dividing the length of the trunk used to retain eggs for each species by body (axilla-groin) length. This comparison assumes that longitudinal variation in the cross-sectional shape of the adult trunk does not differ significantly among species, which seems likely, because of the generally cylindrical form of all species. The ratio is analogous to comparisons using estimates of volume and mass, but avoids the error resulting from relatively inaccurate measurements of body width and depth, and high variability in body mass in preserved specimens.",

Eggs may be arranged in slightly staggered pairs if clutch sizes are greater than two. In Group 2 species, late-stage embryos are folded rather than coiled, and with their yolk from cylindrical masses that are approximately three times longer than wide, with diameters equivalent to that of the distended maternal abdomen. They lie lengthwise in single file. In individuals from Group 1 with large clutches, there was significant intrusion of the clutch mass into the region bounded by parasternal ribs (Fig. 3a) , to the level of the 14th or 15th vertebra. In species from Group 2, the clutch is limited to the region posterior to the last pair of parasternal ribs (Fig. 3b) . It seems to be restricted from more anterior positioning, either by the presence of the viscera (lungs, liver and stomach), or the restriction to lateral distension caused by the parasternal ribs. Both estimates of relative sizes of abdomens indicated that the 'usable' volume decreases with body elongation (Table 111 ). Significant differences in the ratios of abdominal volume: body mass were found among representative species of varying vertebral counts (ANOVA F = 16.94, d.$ = 2, 28, P < 0.0000 l), and in relative lengths of usable abdomen (ANOVA F = 65.1 8, d.$ = 2,28, P < 0.OOOOl).

Two groups were recognized to simplify discussion, although there is variation in size or degree of elongation within each of potential functional significance. The groups are considered as grades, rather than monophyletic groups, because there is no interspecific phylogenetic hypothesis available to suggest otherwise. Small size (as shown by Group 2) and elevated numbers of presacral vertebrae are expected to be apomorphic, because relatively low vertebral counts and moderate body size are primitive for the Scincidae (based on outgroup comparison with the Cordylidae). Thus, the hypothetical common ancestor of Brachymeles was most likely morphologically more similar (in size and general shape) to members of Group 1 than to members of Group 2, although at least some, and probably all Group 1 species have diverged from it in some respects.",

In Group 2, clutches tend to be invariant (two eggs), and are restricted to a smaller, more posterior portion of the maternal abdomen than in Group 1.

Instead of strong positive allometry of the posterior abdominal segments, as occurs in Group 1, there is little differentiation in relative lengths of abdominal segments in Group 2. This trend is illustrated further by differences within Group 2 between B. vermis and other species (Fig. 2) . Although elongation includes addition of abdominal segments, which plausibly could enhance abdominal volume, the number of anterior, rib-bearing somites also increases, so that in relative terms there is little or no increase in abdominal size, and abdominal volume : mass ratios decrease despite the reduction of limbs. I did not determine by direct measurements that relative abdominal size (volume or length) is strongly correlated with RCM in Brachyr?zeles. However, given that the usable abdominal size is lower relative to mass in species with elevated numbers of PSV, the only ways that RCM would not be lower in Group 2 than in Group 1 would be if the available portions of abdomens in small species distend more, or are more densely packed with eggs, than in larger species. Neither appears to be the case, and either would seem to be unlikely, because axial flexibility and a small body diameter are needed for limbless, burrowing locomotion.",

Most or all limb-reduced lizards have elevated numbers of uniformly-sized vertebrae (Hoffstetter & Gasc, 1969; Leonard, 198 1). This morphology most likely facilitates limbless locomotion, but it may have a reproductive cost due to reduction of relative size of abdominal segments, which restricts abdominal volume. Small adult masses and body diameters, which complicate functional considerations of abdominal size because of female-egg allometry, and which are characteristic of members of many clades of lizards (e.g. Anniella, dibamids, some pygopodids, some anguids, and skinks from several major lineages), seem to be associated with retention of the juvenile condition of having relatively little variation in vertebral lengths. Perhaps the only 'means' of achieving uniformity in vertebral size is by reducing allometry among segments by limiting somatic growth, which results in small adult size. A general pattern of paedomorphic (progenetic) evolution may be involved in the derivation of elongate forms, which also is suggested by their relatively juvenile cranial morphologies (Rieppel, 1984; Griffith, 1990) .",

The morphology of snakes shows dissociation from traits that limit abdominal volume in elongate lizards, such as small body diameter and retention of limb girdles. Other morphological differences which could affect relative volume include dimerentid development of lungs, asymmetrical arrangement of internal organs, and further variation in numbers of body segments.
