Hospitals are designing new policy measures and working hard to implement those in place. Radiation Oncology is an integral part of oncology care and the nature of fractionated treatment requires patients to visit cancer centers daily for a significant number of days. The risk of patient contacting/getting exposed to and diffusion of spread is paramount. 4 The risk of decrease in specialized radiation oncology workforce could hamper and even halt operations of radiation oncology centers. 5 Learning from Chinese and Italian experience, aiming to reduce the impact of epidemic operations changes several are recommended. 4, 6, 7 Radiation oncology community must evaluate options of prioritizing radiation treatments, deferring where applicable, omitting where there is no or very minimal benefit and strongly consider reduce numbers of fractions where there is evidence to support. 8 We proposed 4 new R's in the COVID era [1] ViRtual care (reduce in-person consult / follow up / on treatment visits) [2] Ration radiation (ofer radiation wisely and avoid RT where minimal benefit) [3] defeR radiation (as appropriate) [4] hypofRactionate radiation (where applicable) and came up with provincial preferred thoracic radiation regimen.",

Stage IV NSCLC: Priority level -Intermediate: RO Consensus: Majority stage IV NSCLC patients face significant symptom burden. Palliative radiation offers a significant improvement in symptoms and Quality of life. 14 Group recommended 8-10 Gy in 1 Fr or 16 Gy in 2 Fr (1 week apart) as preferred regimen over other fractionated regimen as 20 Gy in 5 Fr or 30 Gy in 10 Fr especially in patients with poor performance status. 15 There is no strong evidence that any regimen gives greater palliation. 16 Small-cell Lung Cancers: Limited stage (stage I-III): Priority level -high: RO Consensus: Concurrent chemo radiation plays a vital role in the management of thiscurative group of patients. We adopted 40Gy in 15 Fr as a preferred consensus recommendation for good performance status candidates. 17 Group discouraged the use of 45Gy in 30 Fr BID or 66Gy in 33 Fr regimens in the current scenario. 18,19 The evidence suggests early administration of concurrent RT is superior to delayed administration and RO favoured early administration of RT. 20 Stage I SCLC could account for 10% of screen detected lung cancers. Acknowledging the limitations of available data, SBRT should be considered in stage I SCLC. 21,22 In such cases group favored SBRT should be offered post chemotherapy. 23 Prophylactic cranial radiation: Priority level -Intermediate: RO Consensus: For limited stage SCLC responding to initial therapy, our group supported and recommended standard regimen of PCI (25Gy in 10 Fr) for eligible patients. 24 Extensive stage (stage III-IV): Consolidation thoracic radiation: Priority level -Intermediate: RO Consensus: For extensive stage SCLC responding to initial therapy, consolidation thoracic radiation improves progression-free survival; reduced intra-thoracic failures, however, did not improve overall survival significantly. For suitable patients group favored 20Gy in 5 Fr over other regimens. 25,26 Prophylactic cranial radiation: Priority level -low: RO Consensus: For extensive stage SCLC responding to initial therapy, the role of PCI is debatable. 27,28 For eligible patients group supported and recommended MRI surveillance as a preferred option in the current environment. 27,28Palliative radiation in SCLC for symptomatic issues: regimen over other fractionated regimen as 20 Gy in 5 Fr or 30 Gy in 10 Fr.",
