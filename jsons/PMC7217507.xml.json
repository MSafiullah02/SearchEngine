            "text": "The importance of the contact pattern of individuals in epidemic spreading has long been acknowledged by researchers [1\u20134]. With the growth of the field of complex networks, there have been a number of studies on infection spreading on networks with nontrivial properties [5\u201311]. Typically, the underlying network in epidemic-spreading models is considered to be static. One can then study the effect of network structure on disease propagation. While the assumption of a static network may work well for cases in which the topology of the network does not change significantly during the course of the spreading process, in general we cannot neglect the fact that human contacts evolve over time. Depending on the disease and the type of contacts in which we are interested, the time scales for the change of human contacts and the spread of an epidemic may vary. To take into account the changing contacts of individuals, many researchers have considered disease spread on networks in which links change over time [12\u201315].",

Using models based on partnership formation [16\u201318], one can study the effect of dynamic contacts due to mixing. These models do not take into account the contact networks behind partnership formation and assume that contacts form at random. Thus, attempts have also been made to consider the underlying network structure in disease propagation models. For example, Volz and Meyers [15] considered a susceptible-infective-recovered (SIR) model on a full network in which each individual's contacts change in time. In their model, referred to as the neighbor exchange model, the dynamics of partnership is implemented through edge swapping between two already connected pairs of nodes.",

The proposed model tries to capture some of the important features of the dynamics of real human networks. In this model, social mixing dynamics and disease evasion causes change in network topology. Social mixing results in the constant evolution of contacts, which is independent of the disease status of the nodes, while disease evasion causes suppression of susceptible-infected links in the network due to the avoidance of infected nodes by the susceptible nodes. We study SIR disease on such dynamic networks where, at any given time, the nodes could be in one of the three possible states, namely susceptible (S), infective (I), and removed (R). Here, R represents the state in which the node is removed from the network and no longer takes part in any kind of dynamics. The model considers the case of imperfect evasion where susceptible nodes cannot avoid infected nodes completely when new connections are formed in the network. This is in contrast to other models where, after the susceptible-infected links are broken, either the broken links are removed or susceptible nodes reconnect the broken links to noninfected nodes in the network [12\u201314]. In our study, we focus on how the above-mentioned network dynamics influences the value of disease transmission probability above which the disease infects a finite fraction of the population in the limit of infinite system size.",

The evasion process and the social dynamics constitute the topological dynamics of the network in which nodes delete their old links and form new connections. Because of the suppression of susceptible-infected links due to disease evasion, each existing S-I link in the network is deleted with a constant probability \u03b71. Due to social dynamics, we assume that the nodes delete their links randomly, independent of their disease status. To account for this, each existing link in the network is deleted with a constant probability \u03d5. Since in our model both the evasion process and social dynamics happen together, each S-S and I-I link is deleted with probability \u03d5 while each S-I link is deleted with probability \u03b1=\u03b71+(1\u2212\u03b71)\u03d5.",

This also includes nodes from the previous time steps that have deleted links due to other reasons discussed below. In our model, nodes attempt to maintain the number of connections specified by their desired degree (which never changes). Thus the number of partners that a node seeks is equal to the number of its deleted links. While searching for new partners, we assume that the nodes mix randomly. In the mixing population, a node could appear more than once and the multiplicity of a node in equal to the number of its deleted links. While mixing, a node has an equal chance of meeting any other node, independent of their disease status. However, we differentiate between nodes meeting each other and actually forming a new link. When nodes with the same disease status meet (i.e., a potential S-S or I-I link), they form a new link with probability 1. When nodes with a different disease status meet (i.e., a potential S-I link), due to disease evasion, the link is formed with probability 1\u2212\u03b72, where \u03b72 is a second evasion parameter. This is the case of imperfect evasion where the susceptible nodes avoid getting infected by deleting their links with the infected neighbors, but while searching for new partners there is again a chance of the formation of new susceptible-infected links. When a pair of susceptible and infected nodes is rejected (with probability \u03b72), the rejected pair move to the next time step to search for partners.

We also allow for self-loops and multiple edges. Under these assumptions, when we have KI~ and KS~ nodes seeking partners [where KI~ and KS~ denote the actual (integer) number, and not the expected number, of nodes seeking partners in a particular realization of the system], the probability of X~ susceptible-infected pairs forming, when KI~+KS~ is even, is given by (see the Appendix A)\n(6)2X~KI~!KS~!(KI~+KS~)2!X~!KI~\u2212X~2!KS~\u2212X~2!(KI~+KS~)!.One can show that over the above distribution, the expected value of X~ is KI~KS~/(KI~+KS~\u22121). Similarly, when KI~+KS~ is odd, one can show that the expected value of X~ is KI~KS~/(KI~+KS~). We assume that the number of nodes seeking partners is large, and we approximate the expected number of susceptible-infected pairs, Xt, as\n(7)KIKSKI+KS.Of the Xt pairs of nodes, (1\u2212\u03b72)Xt is the expected number of pairs that actually form links.

Incorporating the effects of changing network topology due to disease-independent mixing (social mixing dynamics) as well as disease evasion makes the model more meaningful. In our dynamic network model with both social dynamics and disease evasion (Sec. II), we find that, in certain cases, the value of the transmission probability at which the epidemic first occurs increases with increased mixing (Figs. 2, 3, and 4). In other words, as social mixing increases, disease spread is inhibited [Fig. 6(a)]. This occurs due to the suppression of susceptible-infected links when new connections are formed. When the period of infectivity is greater than 1, in certain parameter ranges we get the behavior that increased social mixing can lead to an increase in the spread of diseases.
