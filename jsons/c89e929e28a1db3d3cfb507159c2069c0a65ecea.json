This is particularly true for an intensive care unit (ICU), where highly specialized staff cannot be readily replaced. In the light of lacking evidence for optimal staffing models in a pandemic, we hypothesized that staff shortage can be reduced when staff scheduling takes the epidemiology of a disease into account. METHODS: Various staffing models were constructed, and comprehensive statistical modeling was performed. A typical routine staffing model was defined that assumed full-time employment (40 h/wk) in a 40-bed ICU with a 2:1 patient-to-staff ratio. A pandemic model assumed that staff worked 12-hour shifts for 7 days every other week. Potential in-hospital staff infections were simulated for a total period of 120 days, with a probability of 10%, 25%, and 40% being infected per week when at work. Simulations included the probability of infection at work for a given week, of fatality after infection, and the quarantine time, if infected. RESULTS: Pandemic-adjusted staffing significantly reduced workforce shortage, and the effect progressively increased as the probability of infection increased. Maximum effects were observed at week 4 for each infection probability with a 17%, 32%, and 38% staffing reduction for an infection probability of 0.10, 0.25, and 0.40, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Staffing along epidemiologic considerations may reduce HCW shortage by leveling the nadir ofaffected workforce. Although this requires considerable efforts and commitment of staff, it may be essential in an effort to best maintain staff health and operational functionality of health care facilities and systems.

We therefore aimed to study the dynamics of staff shortages over time under usual scheduling compared to a schedule adapted to disease epidemiology, specifically that of COVID-19. This is done to optimize schedules and to allow for optimal allocation of staff resources, which is crucial for maintaining a maximum of work power during a pandemic crisis, to ensure ICU capacity, and to save the lives of those most severely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.",

A staff member was assumed to be immune for the duration of the 120 days after recuperating from an infection. For both scenarios, each staff member was assigned a single probability of being infected each week at work as a random draw from a binomial distribution with the given underlying probability (10%, 25%, or 40%). Whether a staff member became infected in a given week was then determined by a random draw from the Bernoulli distribution using the staff member's randomly drawn probability of being infected. Likewise, whether or not a staff member died after infection was determined by a random draw from the Bernoulli distribution at 10%, 3%, or 1%, depending on the simulation.

First, the theoretical nature of the models, as opposed to having implemented a research study to compare these staffing scenarios, is certainly a limitation. Additionally, because ICU care is a 24/7/365 business, our standard scenario is a simplified version, and exact working schemes likely differ between hospitals. Nevertheless, it may provide guidance given the diversity of labor laws and \"best common practice\" for routine staffing in health care settings globally. Second, epidemiologic data and recommendations (eg, regarding quarantine times) may be diverse and may differ among regions and affected health care systems. Nevertheless, our simulations reveal a consistent dip in HCW availability that is expected after 4 weeks of a COVID-19 outbreak, independent of specific sickness periods and quarantine times.",

E Quarantine: number of weeks a staff member stays off of work after being infected. Infection: probability of an uninfected staff becoming infected in a given week at work. Mortality: probability of an infected staff member succumbing to the coronavirus. % working: percentage of starting staff working for the given week. Savings: absolute difference between scenario B (rotating weeks, 7-12 h shifts) and scenario A (standard 8-h shifts each week). Scenarios rotating weeks (B) and standard (A) are compared on the absolute difference for each week in the percentage of the starting labor force.
