Understanding its spreading dynamics is of fundamental importance for both public health and scientific researches. Recent studies have focused mainly on evaluation and prediction of on-going spreading, which strongly depends on detailed information about the structure of social contacts, human traveling patterns and biological activity of virus, etc. Methodology/Principal Findings: In this work we analyzed the distributions of confirmed cases of influenza A (H1N1) in different levels and find the Zipf's law and Heaps' law. Similar scaling properties were also observed for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and bird cases of H5N1. We also found a hierarchical spreading pattern from countries with larger population and GDP to countries with smaller ones. We proposed a model that considers generic control effects on both the local growth and transregional transmission, without the need of the above mentioned detailed information. We studied in detail the impact of control effects and heterogeneity on the spreading dynamics in the model and showed that they are responsible for the scaling and hierarchical spreading properties observed in empirical data. Conclusions/Significance: Our analysis and modeling showed that although strict control measures for interregional travelers could delay the outbreak in the regions without local cases, the focus should be turned to local prevention after the outbreak of local cases. Target control on a few regions with the largest number of active interregional travelers can efficiently prevent the spreading. This work provided not only a deeper understanding of the generic mechanisms underlying the spread of infectious diseases, but also some practical guidelines for decision makers to adopt suitable control strategies.",

            "text": "A new global influenza pandemic has broken out. In the first three months, the epidemic spreaded to over 130 countries, and more than 10 5 people were infected by the novel virus influenza A (H1N1). H1N1 represents a very serious threat due to cross-species transmissibility and the risk of mutation to new virus with increased transmissibility. Several early studies paid attention to this public issue from different perspectives [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] , and made known important information such as the biological activity of H1N1 virus and the patterns of early spreading. While every effort was taken to develop antiviral and vaccination drugs, efficient reduction of the spreading could have already been achieved by interventions of population contact. However, such interventions, like strict physical checking at the borders and enforced quarantine, are costly and highly controversial. It is therefore difficult to decide the control strategies: when should the schools be suspended and whether the border control should be reinforced or given up?",

Many health organizations have collected large amount of information about the spreading of H1N1. In-depth analysis of these data, together with what we have known for SARS [9, 10] , avian influenza (H5N1) [11, 12] , foot-and-mouth epidemic [13, 14] and some other pandemic influenza [15, 16] , may lead us to a more comprehensive understanding of the common spreading patterns that do not rely on the detailed biological features of virus. In this paper, we studied the spreading patterns of influenza pandemic by both empirical analysis and modeling. Our main contributions were threefold: (i) The Zipf's law of the distribution of confirmed cases in different regions were observed in the spreading of H1N1, SARS and H5N1; (ii) A simple model was proposed, which does not rely on the biological details but can reproduce the observed scaling properties; (iii) The significant effects of control strategies were highlighted: the strong control for interregional travel is responsible for the Zipf's law and can sharply delay the outbreak in the regions without local cases, while the focus should be turned to local prevention after the outbreak of local cases. Our analysis provided a deeper understanding of the relationship between control and spreading, which is very meaningful for decision makers.",

            "text": "We first analyzed the cumulative number n i of laboratory confirmed cases of H1N1 of each country i to a given date (see the data description in Materials and Methods). Because n i is growing, the distributions for different dates are normalized by the global total cases N T = n i to the corresponding dates for comparison. What we used in our analysis is the Zipf's plots [17] , which was obtained by sorting each n i > 0 in a descending order, from rank 1 to the largest value M and plotting n i with respect to the rank r i . We considered the normalized Zipf's plot where each n i was replaced by its corresponding proportion P i = n i /N T . More discussion of the Zipf's plot can be found in Materials and Methods. Table 1 shows the ranking of the top 20 countries and their total of confirmed cases in five typical dates. Fig.1 (a) and 1(b) report the Zipf's plots for the distributions of normalized n i in different dates. The maximal rank M corresponds to the number of regions with confirmed cases, which grows during the spreading. The normalized distributions P surprisingly display scaling properties. Before the middle of May, P shows clearly a power-law type P \u223c r \u2212\u03b1 with an exponent \u03b1 changing around 3.0 (except the first data point, see Fig. 1(a) ). Although the total cases N T grows rapidly in this early stage, P for different dates seems to follow the same line in the log-log plot. After the middle of May, the middle part of the distribution grows more quickly, and meanwhile the virus spreads quickly to many more countries. In this stage the exponent \u03b1 of the left part of P steadily reduces from higher than 3.0 to 1.7 (see Fig. S3 (b) in Supporting Information), and an exponential tail emerges ( Fig. 1(b) ). After June 10, P can be well fitted by a power-law function with an exponential tail, for example, P \u223c r \u22121.70 e \u22120.013r for the data of July 6 (solid line, Fig. 1 (b) ). The scaling properties are not special for H1N1, but quite common in various diseases, such as SARS in 2003 ( Fig. 1(c) , \u03b1 \u2248 2.7) and the bird cases of H5N1 in 2008 ( Fig. 1(d) , \u03b1 \u2248 2.0), although the spreading range is much more limited (to only about 30 countries).",

We found that the form of power-law-like distribution in Zipf's plot is robust under these different types of variations (Fig. S1 ).This analysis shows that our finding of the power-law-like form is still believable in the presence of variations or errors in surveillance.

Heaps' law describes a sublinear growth of the number of distinct sets M (t) as the increasing of the total number of elements N T (t) belonging to those sets, with the power -law form M \u223c N \u03bb T . A detailed introduction can be found in Materials and Methods. In the pandemic of H1N1, the number of infected countries M and the global total confirmed cases N T obeys the Heaps' law with the Heaps' exponent \u03bb \u2248 0.35 before May 18, 2009 and \u03bb \u2248 0.53 after May 18 (Fig. 2) . The exponents of the Zipf's law and the Heaps law satisfy \u03b1\u03bb \u2248 1, which is consistent with the theoretical analysis [21] that if an evolving system has a stable Zipf's exponent, its growth must obey the Heaps' law with exponent \u03bb \u2248 1/\u03b1 (an approximate estimation when \u03b1 > 1: the larger the \u03b1, the more accurate the estimation).After May 18, the pronounced exponential tail in the distribution P ( Fig. 1(b) ) leads to a deviation from strict Zipf's law, and the two exponents no longer satisfy the relationship \u03bb \u2248 1/\u03b1.",

Figs. 3(a) and 3(b) report the dependence between the number of confirmed cases n i and the population and gross domestic product (GDP). A clearly hierarchical spreading pattern, similar to what were predicted by some theoretical complex network models [22, 23] , can be observed: the big and rich countries were infected first, and then the disease spread out to the global world. This can be understood that bigger and richer countries usually have more active population in international travel, and thus are of higher risk to be new spreading origins in the early stage of epidemic. The evolution of correlations between the confirmed cases n i and population and GDP was reported in Fig. 3 (c) by the Kendall's Tau \u03c4 K . Kendall's Tau measures the correlations between two datesets which are strongly heterogeneous in magnitude. The method to calculate \u03c4 K was introduced in Materials and Methods. To test whether \u03c4 K is significant, we compared the value from original datasets to those from surrogate data by shuffling the order of the population of GDP (see Supporting Information). Significantly positive correlations with a tendency of increase with time can be observed ( Fig. 3(c) and Fig. S2 ). These results show that the interconnectivity among world regions and human mobility are important factors that accelerate the spread of diseases globally. The global total confirmed cases N T displays two phases of growth ( Fig. 3(d) ): in the early stage N T increases with a high rate and then turns into a stable exponential growth with a much smaller rate, with the transition occurring around the middle of May. Such a transition may reflect the changes in the contacting rate among people due to imposed or self-adaptive control.",

Employing the method in Ref. [1] and the estimate of the mean serial interval of 3.2 days in Ref. [2, 3] , we estimated, using the growth rate in the stable growth period after the middle of May, that R is between 1.09 and 1.22 for the serial interval in the range [1.9, 4.5] days. This range is slightly smaller than the results in several other estimations based on the early spreading [4, 5] , but generally in agreement with other studies based on the spreading after the early outbreak [3] . As seen in Fig. S3 (a) in Supporting Information, there is a rapid decrease of R in the period before the middle of May. As we will show later in the model, the decrease of R could be attributed to the control effects. Interestingly, the power-law exponent \u03b1 of the distribution P has a similar trend of evolution ( Fig. S3(b) ). An positive correlations can be found in the plot R vs. \u03b1 for the early stage when both of them are relative large. This relationship could be explained as follows. In the early stage of spreading, R is effectively higher when surveillance and control schemes for H1N1 were not very effective. On the other hand, only a small portion of the population was infected. In this stage, local growth was quicker than transmission between countries, so that the reported number decreases quickly with rank, corresponding to a larger \u03b1. However, a simple relationship between R and \u03b1 is not expected because \u03b1 from the normalized distribution of a given date is related to the accumulated effects of R before this date, especially in the later stage of spreading.",

We believed that the scaling properties have the origin at the generic contact process underlying the transmission of diseases, and the variation could result from the heterogeneity of the contact process in different diseases and regions. One most important heterogeneity may be the control strength. To build a generic model incorporating the effects of control, let us consider the actions taken by people when facing a serious epidemic spreading. In general, individual people try to take many approaches to reduce the probability of infection, such as using respirator, reducing the face-to-face social interactions, and disinfecting frequently. Meanwhile, many organizations usually take measures to prevent the spreading of epidemic, such as physical examinations in public transportation and schools, isolation for highly risky groups, and so on. If epidemic breaks out in a country, other countries may reinforce the health examinations at the borders for the travelers from that country. For example, in China, measurement of body temperature was used in many airports and border crossings, and the identified infected persons and their close contacts were strictly isolated in the early stage of H1N1 spreading. In Hong Kong, students had to measure body temperature and were not allowed to go to school when the temperature was higher than a threshold. These actions of individuals and social organizations can effectively change the structure of social contacts, reduce infection probability and affect the spreading patterns of epidemic [29, 30] . Such effect of imposed or self-adaptive controlling actions was the starting point of our model. Different from many individual-based models, our model is in the regional level, so the detailed social contact structure [9, 31, 32, 34, 35] as well as the control methods and strategies in individual level [36] [37] [38] are not considered directly. Our scheme was based on the metapopulation framework. In this framework, the global community is divided into a set of regions, each having its own spreading dynamics, but also interacting with each other. This framework has been widely used in modeling epidemic spreading in the last decade [39] [40] [41] [42] [43] . In our model, a region (such as a country) is denoted by a node in a network with K nodes in total. Different from previous work considering details of transportation [9, 44] or mobility [45] networks, the network is supposed to be fully-connected since in general there are direct contacts between almost all countries in the world. However, the strength of connections between countries could be different due to the heterogeneity in various factors, such as population and economics. As will be shown later, while such heterogeneity has some impact on the epidemic spreading, the most important ingredients are the strengths of control within and between regions. Therefore, instead of employing the detailed information of real traffics, we generically denoted the international traffic of a node as its strength s i , and the weight of link between two node i and j is assumed to be symmetric and proportional to the products of the strengths s i and s j :",

(3), the parameter \u03c1 does not affect the pattern of the normalized distribution P . \u03c1 is thus fixed at 0.2 in all our simulations, which is close to the fast growing rate of the influenza A in the early stage of outbreak (see Fig. 3 (d)). We quantified the epidemic spreading initiated randomly at one node by the spreading range M (the number of nodes with n i > 0) and the total cases N T and investigate how they depend on the control parameters \u03b2 1 and \u03b2 2 (Fig. 6 ). It is seen that both large \u03b2 1 and large \u03b2 2 can reduce the range of spreading M , but the control on the interregional borders by \u03b2 1 is more effective than \u03b2 2 ( Fig. 6(a) ). On the contrary, large \u03b2 2 is much more effective than \u03b2 1 to reduce the total number of cases N T ( Fig. 6(b) ). The patterns in Fig. 6 are generic in the model for different parameters \u03c1, b and g and for different time during the spreading.

For example, with \u03b2 1 = 0.8 and \u03b2 2 = 0.2, the distribution P can be well fitted by a power-law function with exponent 1.67 ( Fig. 7(a) ), and this value is close to the empirical exponent of influenza A on July 6 ( Fig. 1(b) ). Large \u03b2 1 and small \u03b2 2 is consistent with the real-world situation. While more efficient to implement control measures on the borders, e.g., to identify infected and suspected candidates and their close contacts for quarantine, it is much more difficult to get the same efficiency for the same control schemes in local communities. The relative lower death rate of influenza A is also likely to weaken the self-adaptive control and voluntary isolation of the individuals, leading to insignificant change of the contact patterns (e.g., much weaker than SARS).

While previous investigations have focused overwhelmingly on the impact of heterogeneity in the degree of complex networks [9, 22, 34, 35] , here we study the effects of the heterogeneity in the intensity of nodes and links in globally coupled networks. We first took the real population of different countries as s i in our model and investigate how does the initiation of the disease in countries with different ranks of populations influence the global spreading. When the disease starts in a country with a large s i ( Fig. 9 (a), population rank R ini = 11 as Mexico), the disease spreads out quickly and the spreading process displays a clear tendency from the node with large s i to those with small s i as seen by the evolution of the scatter plot of n i (t) vs. s i and the Kendall's tau ( Fig. 9(c) ), which reproduces the main features in the empirical data in Fig. 3 . On the contrary, when the initiation happens in a country with small population ( Fig. 9(b) , population rank R ini = 100 as Libya), the disease is contained in the country where it is initiated for a period of time, and then the countries with the largest populations get infected soon and become new centers of spreading. \u03c4 K is around zero in the very beginning when the diseases is contained and becomes negative when spreading to a few nodes with the largest s i and quickly shift to positive values when the new centers take the leading role in the spreading Fig. 9 (c)). The total cases N T grows much faster in the first case ( Fig. 9(d) ). We applied target control in our model (see Material and Methods), and we found that strong control just on one or two nodes with the largest s i can sharply reduce the spreading by several orders of magnitude ( Fig. 9(e) ). This effect is similar to target immunization of the hubs in degree heterogeneous complex networks [36] . Here the results are shown for one realization of the simulation. The statistics over many realizations displayed in Fig. S6 in the Supporting Information can evidently demonstrate the spreading from the nodes with large s i to those with small s i . A more systematic analysis of the effects of node heterogeneity and target control by considering a power-law distribution of s i is included in the Supporting Information. We find that even though the heterogeneity can accelerate the spreading (Fig. S7) , the strength of control plays the leading role to determine the patterns of spreading (Fig. S8) . The spreading can be sharply decelerated by reducing both the total cases N T and range M , when only a few nodes with the largest s i are in strong border control (Fig. S9) .",

In each group, we consider four combinations of the parameters \u03b2 1 and \u03b2 2 . For the nodes where the disease is initiated and got infected in the very beginning ( Fig. 10 (a) ), the other nodes are not infected and there is no significant input, thus the growth patterns are dominantly determined by \u03b2 2 . When \u03b2 2 is close to 1, the local growth rate shifts quickly to \u03c1g, corresponding to an exponential function without a clear transition. A pronounced transition happens when \u03b2 2 is close to zero and it takes a period time for the local growth rate to settle down to \u03c1g. The growth patterns of the late infected nodes depend on both \u03b2 1 and \u03b2 2 ( Fig. 10(b) ): the transition to stably exponential growth is still determined by \u03b2 2 , while larger \u03b2 1 prevents the input from other nodes and makes n i smaller. In all the cases, the stable growth rates are close to \u03c1g (the slope \u2248 \u03c1g log 10 e), therefore additional variation of \u03c1g can account for diverse exponential growth rates in the data. We can see that the basic growth patterns in empirical data, i.e., with and without a pronounced transition, can be reproduced by different control parameters in the model. The model, however, does not include strong non-stationary ingredients that could lead to sudden increase of n i observed in a few countries in Fig. 5 . Fig. 10 also shows the corresponding N T in this model of diverse control parameters, which also reproduce the feature of N T in the data. The behavior is similar if we further include the diversity in the parameter g. We would like to point out that the growth patterns of n i in the individual nodes with different parameters are similar to various growth patterns of the global total N T in the model without diversity in parameters. This provides justification that we can apply our model to the global level where each node represents a country, or to the level within a country where each node denotes a state/province. In the later case, N T of the model represents the growth of the total cases of a country and is consistent with the growth of n i in the former case when similar interregional parameters \u03b2 2 and g are considered in both level, namely the model at different level will provide consistent conclusion about the epidemic spreading.",

In particular, the exponent \u03b1 of the empirical distribution P of H1N1 is about 3.0 in the early stage and changes to 1.7 on July 6, 2009, and \u03b1 is about 2.7 for SARS and 2.0 for H5N1. In the stable spreading period, the \u03b1 of H1N1 is smaller than SARS and H5N1. According to the understanding from our model, larger \u03b1 indicates that the control measures are more strict and effective. This is in agreement with the situation in SARS and H5N1 spreading. Because of high death rate and strong infection capability, SARS gave rise to strong social panic and attracted attentions from citizens to governments in the countries with outbreaks, such as China, and strict control measures were enforced in each public transportation systems and in daily life of people. As for H5N1, many efficient control measures were also taken to prevent the spreading, such as immunity for poultry and culling of livestock, etc. Large \u03b1 in the early stage of the spreading of H1N1 could be related to stronger control effect due to overrating of the mortality of H1N1. Empirical results also showed that the distribution P of H1N1 in USA is more homogeneous than in China. While there are probably several factors contributing to this difference, but the most obvious difference is in the control measures. China took strict control policies, such as entry screening at airports and border crossings, and enhanced surveillance of outpatients and inpatients with influenza-like illness, enforced quarantine and isolation for identified infected persons and the close contacts, which are not so strict compared to those during the SARS spreading, but are stronger than USA.",

For regions that have no or only a few local infected persons, strict control measures for interregional travellers can delay the local outbreaks significantly, but if there are large number of local cases, these control methods for travellers are not so important. Instead, control methods and treatment for local communities will be much more helpful. After the Summer of 2009, the focal point of the control policies for H1N1 of many countries turned to the treatment for infected persons. According to the conclusions of the present model, this strategy shift is reasonable. This model also indicates that the diversity of different regions will accelerate the spreading. Efficient prevention of the spreading could be achieved by enhanced control measures, especially for the giant regions.

The Heaps' law [6] is another well-known scaling law observed in many complex systems, which describes a sublinear growth of the number of distinct sets M (t) as the increasing of the total number of elements N T (t) belonging to those sets, with the power -law form M \u223c N \u03bb T . Recent empirical analysis [19, 20] suggested that the Heaps' law and Zipf's law usually coexist. Actually, L\u00fc et al. [21] proved that if an evolving system has a stable Zipf's exponent, its growth must obey the Heaps' law with exponent \u03bb \u2248 1/\u03b1 (an approximate estimation when \u03b1 > 1: the larger the \u03b1, the more accurate the estimation).",

The ranks of the real number could be different from those of the reported number for some countries. Here we discuss the impact of this deviation on Zipf's plots, and our results show that this impact is slight on the power-law-like distribution of the reported number. Let us denote the real total number of cases of the ith country as n \u2032 i = n i + \u03b5 i , where the positive value \u03b5 i represents the error or variation in surveillance of the country. It is reasonable to assume that \u03b5 i could be related to n i or the population M i of a country. We consider three types of assumptions on such variation as follows: Type A, the variation is correlated with the reported total of cases, namely \u03b5 i = \u03c3n i \u03b7, where \u03b7 is a positive random number and obeys the right-part standard Gaussian distribution; Type B, the variation is correlated with the population of the country, so \u03b5 i = \u03c3M i ( i ni i Mi )\u03b7, where M i denotes the population of the country; Type C, the variation is correlated with both the reported total of cases and the population of the country, and we assume \u03b5 i = \u03c3n i M i ( Fig. S1 (a), (b) , (c), respectively, for various \u03c3 values. While the variation proportional to population (Type B) can result in some deviation of the distribution from the original one, the other two types has no obvious impact on the distribution even though the average variation magnitude \u03c3 is large. This result indicate that the power-law-like distribution in Zipf's plot is robust under the variation in Type A and C. ",

According to the algorithm of Kendall's Tau, \u03c4 K \u2248 0 for two completely uncorrelated serials, however, a non-zero value could be obtained due to the small number of countries with reported cases, especially in the early stage of the spreading. To test the significance of the original \u03c4 K , we compare it to \u03c4 \u2032 K from surrogate data where the series of the population or GDP of the corresponding countries is randomly shuffled. We can obtain a distribution of \u03c4 \u2032 K for the surrogate for many realizations, and such a distribution is normal-like around \u03c4 \u2032 K = 0. From this distribution, we can obtain the 95% significance levels. If the original \u03c4 K is out of these levels, then there is less than 5% of possibility that the original \u03c4 K is due to coincidence in finite size uncorrelated series. Note that, in the early stage of May, there are just very few countries with reported cases. The number of shuffling realizations in the surrogate data is too small to obtain a reliable distribution of \u03c4 \u2032 K . Fig. S2 shows the comparison between \u03c4 K and the distribution of \u03c4 \u2032 K . While in the early stage (before May 22) we cannot reject the null hypothesis with very high confidence that the two series are uncorrelated, \u03c4 K is clearly significant afterwards for both the population and GDP.

For the comparison, the time scale in our model is rescaled by the following method: Firstly, we find two times t 1 and t 2 in the growth curve of N T in the model to satisfy N T (t 1 ) \u2248 38 and N T (t 2 ) \u2248 94512. The numbers 38 and 94512 are the global total of conformed cases in April 26 and July 6, respectively. There are 71 days form April 26 to July 6, thus we assume the length of one time step in our model is corresponding to 71 t2\u2212t1 days. Consequently, the growth rate of each time step in our model is \u03bb(t) = [ln(N T (t)) \u2212 ln(N T (t))](t 2 \u2212 t 1 )/71. From the growth rate \u03bb(t), the reproductive number R(t) can be obtained as in the real data. As shown in Fig. S4 , in our typical parameter settings (\u03b2 1 = 0.8, \u03b2 2 = 0.2, b = 0.06 and g = 0.2), the evolution of R also shows a rapid decrease: R changes from the range between 1.7 and 3.0 to the range between 1.1 and 1.4, and generally in agreement with our empirical estimation of R.

            "text": "The empirical results in Fig. 1(b) in the paper indicates that the Zipf's plot converges to a stable distribution before the range of spreading M reaches saturation. The convergence to a stable distribution is inherent in our model. Let us consider a few nodes in the model with the largest n i . The growth n i in such nodes is mainly determined by the local growth rate \u03c1g, n i (t + 1) \u2248 (1 + \u03c1g)n i (t), since the number of infected case due to input from other nodes is much smaller and can be neglected and the local growth has shifted to a stable rate due to local control in Eq. 4. When considering a power-law Zipf's distribution at time t, P t (r) \u223c r \u2212\u03b1 , the total global cases N T are mainly contributed by these nodes with the largest n i , i.e., N T (t + 1) \u2248 (1 + \u03c1g)N T (t). Thus the normalized distribution at t + 1 for these nodes is P t+1 (r) = n i (t + 1)/N T (t + 1) \u2248 n i (t)/N T (t) \u223c r \u2212\u03b1 which is invariant vs. time. This analysis is confirmed by the evolution of P at various parameters in Fig. S5(a-d) . We can see that the distributions P at different time overlap for the nodes with the smallest ranks r. The range of the forepart of the curve of P which can be well fitted by power-law extends along with the time evolution, and the cut-off tail will move to large ranks r till it reaches the system size K. In our model, the scaling property in the distribution P is mainly contributed by large \u03b2 1 . An extreme situation is that \u03b2 1 > 0 and \u03b2 2 = 0, namely, the effect of local control is ignored (the parameter g does not have any impacts). In this case, n i (t + 1) \u2248 (1 + \u03c1)n i (t) for the nodes with the largest n i and N T (t + 1) \u2248 (1 + \u03c1)N T (t). P converges quickly to a power-law distribution when \u03b2 1 is large (Fig.  S5(a) ), and the exponent \u03b1 is quite large because n i of early infected nodes grow very fast, leading to a heterogeneous distribution. On the other hand when \u03b2 2 is large enough, the growth of n i and N T will shift quickly to a stable rate \u03c1g and P again converges to a power-law distribution. \u03b1 is significantly smaller than that at \u03b2 2 = 0 because the local control reduces significantly the growth rate of the early infected nodes, and n i is not as heterogeneous. The stronger the control, the slower the growth of the newly infected nodes, and the more heterogeneous the distribution. Therefore, the convergent exponent \u03b1 becomes larger when \u03b2 2 increases. When \u03b2 2 is small, it takes a long period of time for infected nodes to achieve an stable exponential growth and consequently it takes many steps for P to converge.",

Fig.  9 in the paper shows the evolution of the dependence between n i (t) and s i in one realization of the model simulation when the disease is initiated at two countries with population rank R ini = 11 and R ini = 100, respectively. Fig. S6 displays the statistics over many realizations: (a) and (b) show the probability density function in the space (log 10 s i , log 10 n i ) with color scale and (c) and (d) are the time evolution of the total cases N T and the Kendall's Tau, corresponding to Fig. 9 in the paper. In the early stage, the initiation position is the center of spreading, but shortly, the nodes with the largest s i become the super-spreaders. The spreading from the nodes with large s i to those with small s i becomes very evident in this presentation. In the following we carry out a more systematic analysis of the impact of heterogeneous s i and target control by considering power distributions of s i , i.e., P (s) \u223c s \u2212\u03b3 . Two spreading processes are compared. The first one is the situation without any control impacts, namely \u03b2 1 = 0 and \u03b2 2 = 0. In the second situation we consider strong border control (\u03b2 1 = 0.8 and \u03b2 2 = 0.2, typical parameter setting introduced in Fig. 7 in the paper).",

            "text": "Without control, the spreading is very fast even in the case of uniform s i . Simulation results indicate that increased heterogeneity at smaller \u03b3 sharply accelerates the spreading by increasing the total cases N T in all the spreading period ( Fig. S7(a) ). The impact of heterogeneity on the spreading range M varies in different periods of the spreading: for stronger heterogeneity (smaller \u03b3), M is larger in the early stage, but smaller in the later stages ( Fig. S7(b) ). With control, the spreading is significantly suppressed (e.g., compare t = 100 in panel (c) to t = 60 in panel (a)), and the acceleration by the heterogeneity is weaker: N T does not increase so strongly when \u03b3 is smaller (Fig. S7(c) ), while M displays similarly non-monotonic but relatively stronger dependence on \u03b3 (Fig. S7(d) ). The non-monotonic impact of heterogeneity on M can be understood as follows. When s i become rather heterogeneous, the epidemic will rapidly arrive at the nodes with large s i when initiated at a random node (see Fig. S7(b) ), so M is larger at smaller \u03b3 in the early stage. Then the epidemic mainly grows in these a few early infected nodes with the largest s i and the majority of nodes with small s i have rather weak connections between them, which makes the spreading to new nodes more difficult, even though the total cases N T is larger. In the situations with control, the spreading from these nodes having the largest s i and n i to the nodes with small s i is further reduced. As a result, the non-monotonic impact on M is more obvious in the situations with control. The enhanced spreading by the heterogeneity, however, only makes the distribution P slightly more homogeneous (Fig. S8) . Generally speaking, the nodes with large intensity on heterogeneous structures usually are the keys towards the dynamics of the system. We have applied the target control to the first R m nodes with the largest s i . The spreading can be sharply decelerated by reducing both the total cases N T and range M (Fig. S9(a) and (b) ), when only a few nodes with the largest s i are in strong border control (setting \u03b2 1 > 0 for the first R m nodes and \u03b2 1 = 0 for the others). Similar impact can also be observed with target local control on the same nodes (setting \u03b2 2 > 0 for the front R m nodes and \u03b2 2 = 0 for others, see (d)). In this case, infection in those nodes with \u03b2 2 = 0 grows very fast (with a rate \u03c1) and the control on a few nodes does not reduce the total N T very significantly. However, M is clearly reduced because the nodes with the largest s i are usually the centers of spreading in the early stage and the target control within these nodes will retard the spreading to other nodes. These impacts of control on the nodes with large s i are quite similar to the targeted immunization strategy on hubs notes with the largest degrees in scale-free networks [10] . Therefore, the heterogeneity could be employed to prevent the spreading with target control strategies, and the target control over a few nodes can save the overall cost of control.",

In this case, infection in those nodes with \u03b2 2 = 0 grows very fast (with a rate \u03c1) and the control on a few nodes does not reduce the total N T very significantly. However, M is clearly reduced because the nodes with the largest s i are usually the centers of spreading in the early stage and the target control within these nodes will retard the spreading to other nodes. These impacts of control on the nodes with large s i are quite similar to the targeted immunization strategy on hubs notes with the largest degrees in scale-free networks [10]. Therefore, the heterogeneity could be employed to prevent the spreading with target control strategies, and the target control over a few nodes can save the overall cost of control.",
