There is a constellation of emotional coping strategies and practices that suggests a disposition of wellness and tenacity among those physicians with lower levels of burnout, secondary stress, and higher levels of compassion satisfaction. These physicians have higher levels of positive copings strategies such as grit, acceptance, active coping, positive reframing, strategy planning, and even physical exercise. These findings have very provocative implications for the emotional health of the physician workforce. Can positive emotional coping be taught? Many studies show training in resiliency strategies reduce burnout, perceived stress, and improve perceived ability to manage stress but there are few studies among physicians (Robertson et al., 2015). Of note, a pilot study of an 8-week, abbreviated mindfulness-based stress reduction class designed for primary care physicians showed reduction in Maslach burnout subscales, but no improvement in resilience (Fortney, Luchterhand, Zakletskaia, Zgierska, & Rakel, 2013). Another study by West et al (2014) organized bi-monthly small-group training sessions for physicians to learn mindfulness and coping skills for 9 months. This program demonstrated improved engagement, empowerment, and decreased depersonalization among the intervention group. These effects were maintained at a 12-month follow-up. Providing opportunities to optimize resilience and improve emotional coping strategies can be an important resource for physician wellness (West et al., 2014). Institutional leadership would benefit from formal collaboration with psychologists, and other mental health providers to design, implement, and evaluation interventions to address burnout.",

Similarly, those physicians who felt well supported by their institution also had lower burnout and greater compassion satisfaction. While causation cannot be implied, social support, friendships, and institutional culture may play an important role to mitigate burnout. Social support has been associated with job satisfaction in several studies among nurses but has not been well studied among physicians (Woodhead, Northrop, & Edelstein, 2016; Orgamb\u00eddez-Ramos & de Almeida, 2017).",

These include making wellness a measurable quality indicator, similar to catheter-related infections and hospital readmission rates, which promotes tracking and dialogue around workplace culture. Other evidence-based interventions include mindfulness training, optimizing the electronic medical record, and improving resources in the work environment such as job-sharing and increased ancillary staff (Linzer et al., 2014). In addition, institutions need to hire leaders who foster a collaborative, supportive environment. Physician retention and satisfaction has an important impact upon institutions. The cost of replacing a primary care physician is 2\u20133 times a physician salary (Buchbinder, Wilson, Melick, & Powe, 1999; Misra-Hebert, Kay, & Stoller, 2004). Physicians who experience burnout are more likely to commit medical errors (Shanafelt et al., 2010; Williams et al., 2007). In an era when insurance companies withhold payments and penalize hospitals for readmission rates and poor quality indicators, addressing physician satisfaction can potentially save lives and positively confer cost savings.",

            "text": "Limitations to this project should be considered. First, the response rate of 33% is low, but similar to cohort studies of this type (Lavanchy et al., 2004; Vicentic et al., 2013). While adequately powered, the burnout prevalence of those who did not respond to the questionnaire is unknown. Yet, the prevalence of burnout was consistent with prior studies of physicians (Shanafelt et al., 2019). Second, these associations are observational. It is difficult to infer causation. For example, does greater resilience prevent secondary stress? Or, does the secondary stress exhaust the resilience of the physician? Further, as this was a convenience sample, we do not appreciate how physician burnout fluctuates over time. Is burnout a stable personality type or does burnout fluctuates due to the stresses of the job?",

A qualitative study among satisfied physicians exploring positive emotional coping strategies, workplace environment, and social networks would be an important contribution to the literature. This would include potentially supportive relationships such as marriage satisfaction, family life, or community involvement. Also, the nature of institutional support is not well-defined in the literature and merits further definition. Institutional support could imply a collegial environment, a corps d\u2019esprit, that sustains physicians amidst work stress. Institutional support could also imply job-related operational factors such as job-sharing, on-site child-care, or ready access to mental health services. In addition to a qualitative study, longitudinal intervention trials of wellness programs, such as resilience and mindfulness training, would inform gaps in the literature.",
