The first HSCT was performed at SAMMC in July 2011. Retirees, dependents, and active duty service members from all services are referred to SAMMC from around the world to undergo HSCT. As both patterns of infections and clinical practice vary among institutions, we decided to characterize our rates and sources of infections and the yield of microbiologic testing in the early post-transplant period. The primary goal was to identify areas for intervention in the diagnostic approach in this population. A secondary goal was to identify the rate of antimicrobial resistance which, if high, could change empirical antimicrobial selection.",

Common contaminants, such as coagulase negative staphylococci, required recovery from more than one site, continued recovery, or recovery from an intravenous catheter to be considered a BSI. Streptococcus viridans was not considered to be a common skin contaminant as it is well described as a known pathogen in this population.9 Repeated isolation of the same organism was considered a single BSI unless a negative blood culture was obtained between episodes. Aerobic and anaerobic blood cultures were processed according to routine methods. Urinary tract infection (UTI) was diagnosed if \u2265105 colony forming units per milliliter of urine were recovered in a monomicrobial sample or when an organism was simultaneously recovered with co-occurring bacteremia. BK virus was assessed via real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (Quest Diagnostics, Irving, Texas) testing of blood or urine. Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) was diagnosed with either a positive cytotoxin assay or PCR assay. The C. difficile PCR assay replaced the cytotoxin assay as the first-line test at SAMMC in May 2012. Bacterial stool cultures were assessed for common bacterial causes of diarrhea. Herpes simplex virus assays were performed via direct antigen testing or PCR. Respiratory viruses were investigated through the FilmArray Respiratory Panel multiplex PCR (BioFire Diagnostics LLC, Salt Lake City, Utah), direct fluorescent antigen assays (respiratory syncytial virus), or lateral flow antigen assays (influenza A/B) obtained from nasopharyngeal swabs, washings, or bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL). Endemic fungal infection antigen testing was noted. The Platelia Aspergillus Galactomannan enzyme immunoassay (EIA) (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, California) and the Fungitell (1,3)-\u00df-d glucan assay (Associates of Cape Cod, East Falmouth, Massachusetts) were interpreted as positive or negative according to manufacturer's instructions.

Although not statistically significant, we did note that all BSIs identified in ASCT patients were in the pre-engraftment period, and AlloSCT patients continued to experience bacteremia in the postengraftment period, which is consistent with findings by others.4 Significance is likely limited by small sample size and greater number of ASCT patients than AlloSCT patients at our institution. We noted that 60% of patients with BSI died in the first 100 days compared with 14% of those with negative blood cultures, which is consistent with literature showing that bacteremia is associated with increased mortality in the post-transplant period.12",

We did not note a similar pattern, and attribute it to the number of patients in our evaluation. The median time to onset in this population was 5 days, consistent with findings by others.16 No information was available on pretransplant diagnosis of CDI and whether these instances were relapses of earlier illnesses. The overall yield of our assays was 6%. However, during the study period, our institution introduced the PCR assay to diagnose CDI, which requires fewer tests to make the diagnosis because of increased sensitivity.10 A recent study assessing all C. difficile testing ordered at a tertiary care center describes a similar yield of tests; although the yield of toxin EIA (5%) and PCR (8.2%) varied, no difference in diagnosis of CDI was noted.17 All of our AlloSCT patients who developed CDI also developed acute GVHD, which is an association observed by some investigators.18,19 Whether a causative relationship exists or if C. difficile detection does not represent CDI in GVHD-associated diarrhea is unclear.20 However, investigations have previously described objective findings of infection in HSCT with reports of pseudomembrane formation18 and infection recurrence.18,21 The clinical impact of C. difficile detection in our patients could not be assessed.",

In one study, the incidence of human rhinovirus was 22.3% and human coronavirus was 11.1% at 100 days.22 Our low rate may be attributed to underutilization of this test, although presence of respiratory symptoms in this cohort is unknown. In addition, we did not analyze incidence for seasonality, which impacts incidence of respiratory viral infections in HSCT.22 High rates of progression from upper respiratory tract infection to lower respiratory tract infection have been shown, and co-occurrence with more virulent copathogens has been described.23 More work is being accomplished with respiratory viruses in HSCT as diagnosis has improved. A recent publication examined surveillance of respiratory viruses by PCR and found a pretransplant incidence of 25% for all viruses tested and noted that this was associated with increased mortality at 100 days;24 the authors advocate for incorporation of respiratory viral testing as part of the pretransplant evaluation. Currently, there is no recommendation for active surveillance or pretransplant assessment of asymptomatic respiratory viruses.9 We suspect, however, that increased usage of the viral PCR panel may aid in diagnosis, infection control, treatment decisions, and may prompt investigation and prevention of potential copathogens, and we plan to expand its use in our HSCT patients experiencing respiratory symptoms.",
