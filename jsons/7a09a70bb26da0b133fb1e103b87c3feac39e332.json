A previous study in the four major Chinese cities suggested that the SARS outbreak was significantly associated with the temperature, increasing the daily incidence rate with lower temperatures (Tan et al., 2005) . Recent preprint studies using national data from countries affected by COVID-19 reported that low temperature is beneficial to the viral transmission (Triplett 2020; Wang et al., 2020a; Wang et al., 2020b) .

There is a specific temperature that best fits the benefit of the virus and that lower temperatures contribute to the transmission because it is when the vulnerability increases. Thus, the arrival of summer could reduce the transmission of the COVID-19. Our result agreed with those already reported in other geographical locations, showing how the number of diagnosed cases increase below a maximum temperature of 10 \u00baC and linearly decreasing afterward (Triplett 2000; Wang et al., 2020b) . However, these are cross-sectional studies at the country scale, which might have some measurement error due to high spatial variability when estimating a fixed temperature exposure for large geographic areas (Soares et al., 2012) . Our study considers a smaller area, mainly defined by Barcelona's metropolitan area, where the daily variability of maximum temperature can be estimated more accurately. However, we have not been able to account for socioeconomic status or other meteorological factors, such as ultraviolet radiation or absolute humidity. While daily mortality could be a more robust indicator of the virus behavior, because it is not affected by the number of people tested, mortality may have different incident lag, from days to weeks from the diagnostic. We used instead of the incidence rate of positive diagnosed COVID-19 confirmed with a PCR test.",
