Until a germ\u2010free environment is developed, the average pregnant woman will remain at risk for such minor health problems as upper respiratory infections (URIs). Upper respiratory infections are the most common types of adult infectious diseases, accounting for an estimated $10 to $15 billion annually and 150 million days lost from work. The average American experiences two to four such infections per year.\n3\n, \n4\n The condition of pregnancy further complicates the treatment of URIs insofar as two patients are involved. Much of that which is written concentrates on URIs in the nonpregnant state. Thus, a review of the etiology, symptomatology, and application of treatment of URIs in pregnancy is warranted.",

Although it has almost universal connotation, it actually names a collection of symptoms associated with a virus. Moreover, URIs are not caused by one single virus. More than 100 different strains of viruses have been implicated as causative agents.\n5\n The major two types of viruses are rhinoviruses and coronaviruses. Although these usually are implicated as the cause, fully one\u2010third of URIs are unable to be linked with a specific etiologic agent.\n6\n\n",

Although once dismissed as a myth, changes in weather and drafts are now recognized as part of multiple stresses which may decrease a host's resistance to a virus.\n8\n Actual transmission of a cold virus has been proposed through infected droplets found on tissues, as well as self innoculation from mouth to finger. It is rare that an individual transmit a cold simply by sneezing or coughing.\n9\n Regular handwashing has been found to be the single most preventative policy.\n10\n, \n11\n\n",

One normal response to the epithelial invasion is the release of inflammatory mediators which increase the serum in nasal secretion resulting in rhinorrhea with increased vascular permeability and edema causing nasal stuffiness. The cold virus also causes cholinergic stimulation which not only increases mucoid production and rhinorrhea, but also can alter respiratory function by bronchial constriction. This bronchial constriction, associated with the rhinorrhea and cellular tissue damage of the nasal membranes and pharynx from the cold virus can be expressed as a cough or sore throat. Histamine is released in response to the cellular tissue damage, compounding the discomfort.\n8\n A cold is a self\u2010limiting entity, commonly lasting three to seven days. Such a condition is communicable for two to three days after onset.",

Past history or length of symptoms will help to differentiate between a cold and seasonal allergies, the latter being of a recurrent nature and associated with allergens instead of a usual short\u2010term episodic cold. Bacterial pharyngitis is another condition that can be confused with an URI. Bacterial pharyngitis is usually of a rapid onset, without the prodromal or the increasing intensity of symptoms found with a cold. Furthermore, it is most commonly associated with febrile episodes, where simple URIs are nonfebrile conditions, or evidencing a slight low\u2010grade temperature elevation at best. Influenza may mimic the signs and symptoms of an URI but will also have associated fever and usually gastrointestinal symptomatology. Pneumonia is differentiated from a simple cold as its symptoms include severe cough, fever, chills, and such serious signs as respiratory distress.\n13\n, \n14\n\n",

Fluids may help with expectoration of respiratory secretions while still maintaining hydration, a point of particular importance in pregnancy. The issue of starving a cold not only has little relevance, but can be of danger in pregnancy where dehydration has been implicated in preterm labor. Humidified air decreases the viscosity of respiratory secretions. Such air is particularly comforting for the individual with a sore throat. Cool air vapor has been suggested as superior to hot steam because of safety reasons. However, such vaporizers quickly become contaminated. To prevent this, they should be frequently cleaned according to manufacturer's instructions.\n13\n\n",

Although the FDA reported that there is no convincing evidence linking doxylamine and pyridoxine to teratogenic effects, the manufacturer removed the combined drug from the marketplace. Because doxylamine is still available as an antihistamine with marked sedative potential, the clinician has the ability to prescribe it in combination with over\u2010the\u2010counter pyridoxine. The advisability of doing this must be tempered with the recognition of the risk of dealing with \u201clitogens\u201d as opposed to teratogens in today's litigious society.\n16\n It also is important to note that the FDA continues to conduct investigation of the combination drug \u201cBendectin\u201d.\n2\n\n",
