Increased morbidity, mortality, and socio-economic implications 6, 7 are recognised by inclusion of Cryptosporidium in the Neglected Diseases Initiative of the World Health Organization (WHO) [8]. Cryptosporidiosis is a laboratory diagnosis because it is not pathognomonic \u2013 in other words, the acute signs and symptoms can be similar to other infectious and non-infectious causes of gastroenteritis 9, 10. In cases where other parasites are also suspected, or in populations where they are prevalent, multiple faecal samples with and without chemical preservation may be required [11] (Figure 2\n). Differential diagnosis enables provision of appropriate advice on treatment, control, and management, and at the population level it is required for the identification of outbreaks and for monitoring trends, risk factors, and interventions.",

This report highlights difficulties in comparing data across countries, derived differently due to variations in laboratory testing and reporting. The lack of widespread, routine Cryptosporidium diagnosis and species identification, or a standardised subtyping scheme, impinges on investigation. These shortcomings also occur in water testing where only the genus is identified. Phylogenetic comparisons of isolates from cases and sources are not undertaken in most settings, impacting on source attribution and risk assessments for drinking water and other exposures [13].",

            "text": "Taxonomic positions are important in understanding the evolution, biology, pathogenesis, sources, and transmission of pathogens as well as focussing efforts for identifying targets for diagnosis and drug therapies. The taxonomy of Cryptosporidium (phylum Apicomplexa, class Coccidea, order Eimeriidae) was disputed, because of life-cycle (Figure 1), phylogenetic, and biological differences observed in comparison with other Eimeriidae (e.g., Cyclospora, Cystoisospora, and Eimeria) [19]. Traditionally, Apicomplexan species were defined by host-specificity, location of endogenous stages, and morphology. For Cryptosporidium spp., however, host-specificity is variable, and oocyst morphology distinguishes only those with smaller, near-spherical oocysts (4\u20136 \u03bcm in diameter) from those with larger, more oval oocysts (7 \u00d7 5 \u03bcm) (Table 1\n). Therefore, a combination of biological and genetic data is recommended for identifying and naming new species: (i) morphological features of the oocyst and demonstration of developmental stages; (ii) natural and experimental host range; (iii) detailed biological characterisation, including localisation and pathology associated with an individual host; (iv) differential diagnosis; (v) genetic characterisation at multiple loci, to include the small subunit ribosomal RNA (SSU rRNA) and other functional genes; (vi) deposition of definitive reference sequences and preserved material for further analyses; and (vii) compliance with International Committee for Zoonotic Nomenclature (ICZN) species-naming rules [20]. Where mainly genetic data are available, isolates are described as \u2018genotypes\u2019 [21]. The ICZN rules are open to interpretation, especially in the Principle of Priority, leading to conflicting opinions about renaming Cryptosporidium spp. (e.g., Cryptosporidium parvum as Cryptosporidium pestis) [22]. To avoid confusion and promote stability, here we use C. parvum for the species infective to calves and humans [21].",

Infection is transmitted by oocysts and acquired mainly by the faecal\u2013oral route, with very rare instances of respiratory infection following inhalation or aspiration [6]. Despite occasional reports in livestock, C. hominis appears to be transmitted anthroponotically. Immunocompromised patients have provided sentinel alert to some new infections [23]. In animals, the clinically and economically important gastrointestinal species are C. parvum (pre-weaning ruminants), C. meleagridis (birds), C. canis (puppies), C. felis (kittens), Cryptosporidium serpentis (snakes), and Cryptosporidium varanii (reptiles) [5]. Cryptosporidium baileyi is also associated with respiratory disease in birds [5].

The incubation period (normal range 3\u201312 days, usually 5\u20137 days) is dose-dependent. Cryptosporidiosis is self-limiting in immunocompetent people, and the symptoms vary in severity (mild to severe); duration can be for up to 1 month during which time relapse occurs in about one third of cases. Severity varies partially with the general health of the patient, and those experiencing mild, self-limiting diarrhoea will be unlikely to seek medical attention and obtain a diagnosis (Table 2\n).",

The parasite is widely endemic and is one of the most frequently diagnosed causes of diarrhoea in pre-weaning calves [25]. Multiple pathogens can be involved in neonatal diarrhoea (rotavirus, coronavirus, pathogenic strains of Escherichia coli and Salmonella spp.), and cryptosporidiosis is confirmed by finding significant numbers of oocysts in diarrhoeic faeces in their absence [25]. However, coinfection may modulate the clinical presentation, and has been widely speculated to lead to more severe cryptosporidiosis [5], although experimental data to support this are still lacking. Infection with C. felis is often asymptomatic in cats but those also infected with the feline leukaemia virus are more likely to exhibit clinical signs [5]. A very different clinical spectrum may also be seen for example in birds where C. baileyi and C. meleagridis can also cause respiratory disease, requiring investigation of different sample types (Table 2).",

For example, C. hominis, but not C. parvum, was associated with joint pain, eye pain, headaches, and fatigue during the 2 months following human infection [26]. Although a study of intestinal mucosal biopsies and serology from patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) did not support a major role for Cryptosporidium in its pathogenesis [27], infection can trigger IBD flare, and inclusion of a test for Cryptosporidium is indicated in IBD patients seeking medical intervention for sudden exacerbation of digestive symptoms [28]. Experimental infection of rats with C. parvum triggers long-term pathological changes in the small intestine similar to those found in patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) [29], supporting anecdotal reports of association. If a postinfectious (PI) association is found with Cryptosporidium for IBS (PI-IBS), reassurance could be provided to diagnosed patients that their altered bowel habit is consistent with PI-IBS and is likely to resolve without need for medical intervention. Potential impacts include reduction in use of health services (e.g., consultations and investigations).",

At most risk are those with primary or secondary T cell immunodeficiencies, notably untreated advanced HIV infection, lymphoma, and leukaemia (especially children). In this patient group, complications include pancreato-biliary infection, which may lead to sclerosing cholangitis and liver cirrhosis, and respiratory cryptosporidiosis (Table 2). Rapid detection of carriage in high-risk groups could help to limit clinical sequelae [31]. The findings of a recent study indicate that even low doses of C. parvum infect dexamethasone-treated, severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) mice, leading to digestive adenocarcinoma, implying that severely immunocompromised humans may also be susceptible [32], which highlights the need for vigilance in diagnosis.",

            "text": "Asymptomatic carriage of Cryptosporidium occurs, and in humans has been mainly investigated in young children, including those in industrialized countries where carriage rates of up to 3.8% have been reported [38]. A study of children in daycare in the UK used highly-sensitive immunomagnetic separation (IMS) and direct immunofluorescence microscopy (IFM), and reported concentrations of 13367 \nC. hominis oocysts per gram (opg), 3471 \nC. ubiquitum opg, and 56 skunk genotype opg [38]. Only the C. hominis-positive sample contained sufficient oocysts for detection by some current methods (Figure 2), and low parasite density challenges most diagnostic assays (Box 1\n). This is also an issue for samples obtained late in an infection when oocyst numbers may be in decline or where partial immunity may result in few oocysts being shed [31].Box 1Attributes of current Cryptosporidium faecal diagnostic assays\n\u2022Selection criteria include resources (staff time, expertise, grade, finances, specialist equipment), desired turnaround time, the population being tested, desired sensitivity and specificity, and the need to identify other pathogens.\u2022Preservatives can inhibit PCR and must be removed by washing; this may not be possible if the preservative has penetrated the oocysts.\u2022Faeces can be concentrated by sedimentation using modified formol\u2013ethyl acetate or solvent-free techniques, but significantly fewer parasites and larger deposits have been reported in a solvent-free system, and low-density parasites might be missed [86]. Conventional flotation (e.g., zinc sulphate, saturated sodium chloride or sucrose) results in cleaner preparations but low-density oocysts may be missed.\u2022Using fluorescent stains (e.g., Auramine O) oocyst observation is easier and less subjective, and slides can be scanned at lower magnification than acid-fast stained slides, but a fluorescence microscope is needed.\u2022IFM is less subjective than other microscopy stains and increases sensitivity and specificity, although some notable cross-reactions (e.g., algae) may occur in food, water, and environmental testing, necessitating observation of confirmatory features: internal contents and sporozoites by differential interference contrast and sporozoite nuclei by staining with a nuclear fluorogen.\u2022EIAs can be automated and are more sensitive than acid-fast microscopy. Immunochromatographic lateral flow (ICLF) is less sensitive, but requires little skill and can be performed anywhere as a rapid test, for example pen-side. ICLF and EIA kits may include other pathogenic protozoa in a single test (e.g., Giardia\n[87]), and additionally for humans, Entamoeba histolytica\n[88].\u2022\nCryptosporidium species antigen variability may compromise immunodiagnostic tests based on antibodies raised against Cryptosporidium parvum; there is some evidence that Cryptosporidium felis may be less well detected [89].\u2022Conventional and real-time PCR assays have been described, but real-time PCR has been reported as the most sensitive and specific test for Cryptosporidium in diarrhoeic calf samples [90].\u2022Molecular assays are underpinned by efficient DNA extraction but oocysts may be present at low density in complex matrices (faeces, slurry, food, water) that may contain PCR inhibitors. Oocysts in faeces or semi-purified suspensions need first to be disrupted by procedures such as bead beating, freeze\u2013thaw, cycles or enzymatic digestion [91]. Automated DNA extraction procedures can be used [48].\u2022PCR conditions must include mitigation of potentially inhibitory substances (e.g., heme, bilirubin, bile salts, or complex carbohydrates). PCR primers and conditions need to be selected carefully to amplify all Cryptosporidium species of interest and to avoid non-specific amplification.\nThere is no gold-standard diagnostic test. For comparison of sensitivity and specificity, either one must be nominated or comparison tests such as McNemar's or a Bayesian model must be applied [90]. The outcome depends not only on the test properties but also the nature of the samples (e.g., consistency, parasite density), the statistical power of the study, and skill in performing assays. Nevertheless, when performed under diagnostic conditions, the general consensus is as shown below (Figure I\n).",

Immune reconstitution is most effective but not always possible. Halofuginone is licensed for the treatment and control of cryptosporidiosis in calves. However, this drug is toxic at twice the recommended dose and is contraindicated for use in diarrhoeic animals. A recent meta-analysis found that although it provided beneficial prophylactic use, there were insufficient data to establish a therapeutic effect [40]. However, a study in Ireland showed that halofuginone was effective in reducing clinical signs and environmental contamination with oocysts [41].

One approach to overcoming this has been the commercial development of a PCR-EIA that identifies Cryptosporidium spp., C. hominis and C. parvum\n[45]. However, molecular diagnostic assays are being implemented in diagnostic laboratories, especially in virology and some aspects of bacteriology, and are emerging for enteric protozoa. Real-time PCR probe-based assays for the detection of multiple protozoa have been described, such as for Cryptosporidium spp., Giardia lamblia, Entamoeba histolytica, and Dientamoeba fragilis, with a testing algorithm for microscopy based on clinical information, which could be adapted to specific settings depending on the likelihood of involvement of other parasites [46]. The replacement of probes with carboxylated Luminex microspheres provides an alternative detection system, as demonstrated for several parasites [47]. An assay based on multiplex-tandem PCR (MT-PCR) describes the simultaneous detection of bacterial pathogens in Cryptosporidium-positive stools, and the authors suggest that the increased amplification efficiency would also be useful for water samples [48]. Commercial multiplex PCR-based assays for comprehensive panels of gastrointestinal pathogens are becoming available, utilising robotic platforms for DNA extraction and assay set-up. Although offering streamlined and high testing capacity, investigation of a wide range of pathogens in all samples increases the number of positive findings; this may not always be warranted clinically but may shed light on the importance of infection in patients previously not investigated, and of coinfections. Pathogen panels should ideally be tailored for the population under investigation. Downstream testing of extracted DNA for further species/genotype discrimination of Cryptosporidium-positive samples either in the same, or more likely a reference, laboratory could be readily implemented for epidemiological and outbreak investigations (Figure 2).",

However, outbreak investigations focus on specific incidents, and the contamination event will usually have passed some time before recognition of an outbreak. For understanding Cryptosporidium spp. transmission, baseline data need to be generated by well-structured sample surveys. Interventions such as those implemented to reduce waterborne disease need to be monitored for effectiveness, and one strategy is to compare population exposure.

This is particularly important because a single locus (the SSU rRNA gene) is often used as species marker; confidence in species determination and subtyping is greatly increased by using multiple markers that are spread throughout the genome [56]. Phylogenetic analysis has proven to be an essential tool for determining species status; this approach provides more information than is achieved through individual sequence comparisons (such as BLAST searches) because more weight is given to informative mutations that may be species- or group-specific 20, 54. Use of reference sequences will help to reduce the confusion caused by sequences deposited in databases that may have been falsely attributed to a species due to limited understanding of species complexity at the time of submission.

            "text": "Comparative analyses of the published C. parvum and C. hominis genomes (http://cryptodb.org) have revealed new possible diagnostic targets, for example a new family of telomerically-encoded Cryptosporidium proteins, the C. parvum-specific Cops-1 and the C. hominis-specific Chos-1 [34]. The relatively small Cryptosporidium genome (9.1\u20139.2 Mb) combined with ever-reducing sequencing costs will allow more Cryptosporidium genomes to be sequenced, and from different species and from multiple isolates of the same species [57]. Publication of new genomes will allow detailed comparisons, resulting in identification of more species-specific markers, polymorphic mini- and micro-satellite markers, and single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) [58]. These markers can be exploited to develop improved PCR-based diagnostics utilising the more informative parts of the Cryptosporidium genome [16]. The SNPs may also be used in attempts to identify virulence genes or factors involved in host-specificity [58]. The increasing amount of genomic data will undoubtedly lead to further development of microarrays for detecting variation within parasite populations. However, this is a longer-term development and currently there is much focus on the use of mini- and micro-satellite markers. Generally, these are very variable because they are commonly in noncoding regions of the genome and are subject to fewer functional restraints that impede the accumulation of mutations. However, many Cryptosporidium satellite markers were identified before genome sequences became available, and are mostly within coding regions [59]. These satellite markers have been used successfully for studying Cryptosporidium population dynamics to evaluate transmission routes and zoonotic potential 59, 60, 61, 62. There is a need not only for the further development of subtyping methods for epidemiological purposes, but also for their standardisation. A recent review revealed that 55 markers have been used in various combinations on different platforms to investigate variation within C. parvum and C. hominis\n[59]. Although multi-locus typing is a potentially powerful tool, global meta-analysis and comparisons are impossible if different methods are used, and there is a need for standardisation. Assessment of existing markers and suggestions for taking these forward in independent validation studies for harmonisation of typing schemes have been published recently by Robinson and Chalmers [59]. Typing tools developed based on Cryptosporidium genome analyses, if harmonised, will also have the potential to help with outbreak investigations, source attribution, investigations into the fate and transport of oocysts, persistence within hosts, studies into the role of strain-specific immunity, and the identification of virulence factors and genes involved in host specificity.",

Four sporozoites are present in each oocyst, and emerge (A) to invade the microvilli at the brush border of the mucosal epithelium (B) and develop into trophozoites (not shown). Trophozoites undergo asexual division (merogony) to form eight merozoites within type I meronts (C), and release invasive merozoites (D) that invade adjacent host cells to form additional type I meronts or to form type II meronts (E). Merozoites released from type II meronts do not recycle but invade host cells to initiate the sexual stage. Microgametocytes released from microgamonts (F) fertilise the macrogamonts (G) to become zygotes. Most of the zygotes develop into oocysts with a thick, two-layered wall (H) but a minority only have a unit membrane surrounding the four sporozoites (I) and facilitate the autoinfective cycle that maintains infection without further ingestion of thick-walled oocysts. Sporulated, thick-walled oocysts containing four sporozoites (J) are released in faeces and transmit infection between hosts. Abbreviation: TRAPs, thrombospondin related adhesive proteins.",
