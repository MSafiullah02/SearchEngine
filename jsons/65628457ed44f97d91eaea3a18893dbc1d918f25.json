            "text": "Repurposed drugs that are immediately available and have a good safety profile constitute a first line of defense against new viral infections. Despite a limited antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2, several drugs serve as candidates for application, not only in infected individuals but also as prophylaxis to prevent infection establishment. Here we use a stochastic model to describe the early phase of a viral infection. We find that the critical efficacy needed to block viral establishment is typically above 80%. This value can be improved by combination therapy. Below the critical efficacy, establishment can still sometimes be prevented; for that purpose, drugs blocking viral entry into target cells (or equivalently enhancing viral clearance) are more effective than drugs reducing viral production or enhancing infected cell death. When a viral infection cannot be prevented because of high exposure or low drug efficacy, antivirals can still delay the time to reach detectable viral loads from 4 days when untreated to up to 30 days. This delay flattens the within-host viral dynamic curve, and possibly reduces transmission and symptom severity. These results suggest that antiviral prophylaxis, even with reduced efficacy, could be efficiently used to prevent or alleviate infection in people at high risk. It could thus be an important component of the strategy to combat the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in the months or years to come.",

As of May 6th, more than 3.5 million cases and 250,000 associated deaths have been detected worldwide. SARS-CoV-2 causes substantial morbidity and mortality with 5% to 47% of cases requiring hospitalization (Verity et al., 2020; Cereda et al., 2020) and a case fatality ratio of the order of 1% overall, but much higher in the elderly Hauser et al., 2020; Verity et al., 2020) . With a short doubling time of 2 to 7 days when uncontrolled Cereda et al., 2020; Muniz-Rodriguez et al., 2020) , this epidemic can rapidly overburden healthcare systems (Ferguson et al., 2020) . Many countries have imposed social distancing measures to reduce incidence. Lifting these measures while keeping the epidemic in check may require a combination of intensive testing, social isolation of positive cases, efficient contact tracing and isolation of contacts (Bi et al., 2020; Ferretti et al., 2020) . Even if these measures are locally successful in keeping the disease at low prevalence, the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in many countries and substantial pre-symptomatic transmission (Tindale et al., 2020; Ferretti et al., 2020) suggest that the virus may continue to circulate in the years to come.",

Clinical trials to test several agents are underway, but existing antivirals have limited efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 and are most efficient to reduce viremia when taken early in infection (Gon\u00e7alves et al., 2020; Kim et al., 2020) . Prophylactic therapy using repurposed antivirals has recently been proposed (Jiang et al., 2020; Pagliano et al., 2020; Spinelli et al., 2020) . Prophylactic therapy is successfully used in the prevention of HIV infection and malaria (Mermin et al., 2006; Baeten et al., 2012) . It could be an essential tool to reduce the probability of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the elderly (especially those in nursing homes), individuals with co-morbidities, and health care workers, thus substantially reducing the burden on health care systems. Depending on the safety profile of the antiviral drug it could be taken continuously (pre-exposure) or just after potential exposure (post-exposure). In this study, we integrate recent knowledge on SARS-CoV-2 hostpathogen interactions and the pharmacological properties of the antivirals currently tested in clinical trials to evaluate the efficacy of prophylactic antiviral therapy. We calculate the probability of establishment of a viral inoculum in an individual under prophylactic antiviral therapy.",

This mitigates two risks incurred by the virus: the risk that it does not find a cell to infect before it is cleared, and the risk that infected cells die early by chance.

The third mode of action corresponds for example to nucleoside analogues that prevent viral RNA replication (favipiravir, remdesivir), or to protease inhibitors (lopinavir/ritonavir) (Li and Clercq, 2020) .

In Section S5 in the SI, we give an approximation for the distribution of the extinction time. We find that antiviral drugs that either reduce viral infectivity \u03b2 or increase infected cell death \u03b4 show comparably low extinction times ( Table 2 ). The extinction time is useful to determine the number of days a potentially infected person should take antiviral medication post-exposure. It is particularly relevant when the time to reach a detectable threshold is so long that treatment risks to be stopped before reliable detection of the virus is possible. For example in the LowN parameter set, with an antiviral drug reducing viral production p with 75% efficacy, the time to reach a detectable viral load is around 24 days on average (Table 2 ; V 0 = 10). Yet, extinction, if it occurs, happens very quickly: the median extinction time is two days but can be longer than six days in 10% of individuals.",

Using a stochastic model of within-host SARS-CoV-2 dynamics whose structure and parameters are informed by recent data (Gon\u00e7alves et al., 2020; Kim et al., 2020) , we showed that in principle a combination of two drugs each with efficacy between 60% and 70% will almost certainly prevent infection (Fig. 3) . For single drug treatment, we find that even intermediate efficacies can largely delay the within host establishment of the viral infection (Fig. 4) . More generally, our stochastic model for the early phase of virus establishment within a host could be used to study the impact of prophylactic treatment on viral infections whose dynamics can be captured by the deterministic model in (1). A limitation of our model is that it encompasses a simplified version of events in which the effects of the innate immune responses are embedded in the parameter values of the model. For example, an early innate response, if not effectively subverted by the virus, might put some target cells into an antiviral state where they are refractory to infection, thus effectively reducing \u03b2 (or equivalently, increasing c) (e.g. Pawelek et al., 2012) . We neglect a potential adaptive immune response against the virus because we are interested in the early stages of the infection before the immune system develops a specific response to the viral infection. A specific immune response may in later stages enhance the ability of the body to eliminate the virus. Thus, the estimates of the drug efficacies needed to prevent establishment of infection are conservative and in reality may be overestimates. Further, even if the drugs being used do not have efficacies high enough to prevent infection on their own, they can lengthen the time needed to establish infection and hence allow time for the immune response to develop and assist in the clearance of the virus.",

However, they depend on the intra-host basic reproduction number estimated at R 0 = 7. This basic reproduction number was estimated from time series of viral load in 13 infected patients (Gon\u00e7alves et al., 2020) . There are three main sources of uncertainty in that number, based on longitudinal viral load measurements in nasopharyngeal swabs (Young 12 .

First, the number of virions may vary at different sites. Here we model the early phase of the infection in the upper respiratory tract, and neglect other compartments that may be more favorable to viral multiplication. For example, the number of virions in the sputum is 10 to 100 fold higher than in throat swabs (Pan et al., 2020) . The upper respiratory tract may allow a small amount of virus to enter the lower respiratory tract. Modelling such complexities is difficult with current data, but would affect the establishment probability. Second, a fraction of the virions detected by a PCR assay may not be infectious (W\u00f6lfel et al., 2020b) . Taking into account non-infectious virions would not change the model dynamics much but may affect the inference of parameter values on which our analysis builds. Third, the incubation time of all patients was assumed to be five days (Gon\u00e7alves et al., 2020) . Varation in this value changes the timing of the peak viral load. Lower incubation times result in an earlier peak which increases the estimate of R 0 . Integrating fully these sources of uncertainty would require re-inferring parameter values based on corrected viral load time series and for different incubation times. While we cannot account for the first two uncertainties, we varied the incubation time from two to ten days. The corresponding parameter sets, with R 0 values of 12.2 and 4.3, respectively, are analyzed in Section S8 in the SI. Our qualitative findings on the effectiveness of prophylactic therapy remain valid under these variations of R 0 (see Fig. S6 in the SI). Of course, the quantitative predictions, which depend on R 0 , will change (Table 2 ). Considering the current uncertainty in the basic reproduction number and other parameters, we developed an online interactive application to compute and visualize the establishment probability and deterministic dynamics as a function of parameters. This application can be used to update our results as our knowledge of intra-host dynamics and treatment efficacies progresses (currently accessible at fdebarre.shinyapps.io/prophylactic_ antiviral_therapy). Lastly, we note that we measured efficacy as the degree of inhibition of a specific pathway (viral infectivity or production). As a consequence, drugs targeting for instance viral infectivity or production do not affect the basic reproductive number R 0 in the same way. If for example the efficacies were defined such that they reduce R 0 equally, critical efficacies would be the same for all modes of action. Antiviral therapy with efficacy above a critical value can prevent infection entirely. The critical efficacies found in our stochastic model are obtained by solving R 0 = 1 for different types of treatment. Solving this equation is equivalent to studying the critical efficacy in a deterministic modeling framework. However, the shape of the establishment probability can only be inferred by a stochastic analysis of the model. Below critical efficacy, drugs reducing infectivity or increasing viral clearance reduce the establishment probability the most. Importantly, drugs reducing viral production need to be close to critical efficacy to cause a marked reduction on the probability of establishment (Figs. 2 and 3) .",

The first value in each cell gives the establishment probability, the second value denotes the median of the time to detection (days), the numbers in brackets are the 10 and 90-percentiles of the time to detection distribution (days), and the last line of numbers gives the median time to extinction (days) with the 10 and 90-percentiles in brackets. All times are rounded to half-day values if below 5 days, and to days if above. Missing values, denoted by dashes, are explained by the viral population either not going extinct or not to establish. Times which are larger than a month are just given as > 30. All values are estimated from 100, 000 stochastic simulations for the establishment probability and 10, 000 stochastic trajectories for the extinction and establishment times. The parameter sets for the lower and higher values of R 0 are given in Table S3 in the SI.",
