Overall, pulmonary abnormalities and/or significant ongoing respiratory symptoms were detected in nearly a third of ALL survivors treated without HSCT. Larger, prospective studies are warranted to evaluate the etiology and clinical significance of these findings. follow-up studies have found respiratory-related deaths to be second only to subsequent malignancy, and pulmonary abnormalities have been detected in up to 81% of survivors before the age of 50 years. Of all childhood cancers, acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is the most common and carries an excellent prognosis with a 10-year survival exceeding 90%. 3 In an era of rising cure rates, late pulmonary effects will become increasingly important for a growing population of survivors. 4 Historically, research has focused on identifying pulmonary-toxic therapies, such as radiation and hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT), to inform risk-based pulmonary follow-up. [4] [5] [6] However, respiratory infections are also a significant cause of pulmonary morbidity during treatment. 7 In particular, recent studies using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) diagnostics have found respiratory viral infections (RVI) cause up to 57% of febrile episodes, and that children undergoing chemotherapy are at risk of more severe RVIs with a prolonged clinical course and higher viral loads. [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] In general population-based studies, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and rhinovirus (HRV) bronchiolitis during infancy have been associated with subsequent wheeze and obstructive defects. 12, 13 RVIs have also been shown to precipitate late airflow decline 14 and alloimmune lung syndromes 15 in transplant recipients.
