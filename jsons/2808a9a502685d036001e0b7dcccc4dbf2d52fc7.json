The disease is caused by the novel Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus, also known as the novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV). A custom convolutional neural network (CNN) and a selection of pretrained CNN models are trained on publicly available CXR collections to learn CXR modality-specific feature representations and the learned knowledge is transferred and fine-tuned to improve performance and generalization in the related task of classifying normal, bacterial pneumonia, and CXRs exhibiting COVID-19 abnormalities. The best performing models are iteratively pruned to identify optimal number of neurons in the convolutional layers to reduce complexity and improve memory efficiency. The predictions of the bestperforming pruned models are combined through different ensemble strategies to improve classification performance. The custom and pretrained CNNs are evaluated at the patient-level to alleviate issues due to information leakage and reduce generalization errors. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that the weighted average of the best-performing pruned models significantly improves performance resulting in an accuracy of 99.01% and area under the curve (AUC) of 0.9972 in detecting COVID-19 findings on CXRs as compared to the individual constituent models. The combined use of modality-specific knowledge transfer, iterative model pruning, and ensemble learning resulted in improved predictions. We expect that this model can be quickly adopted for COVID-19 screening using chest radiographs.",

This is especially important in locations with insufficient radiological expertise while producing fast, high throughput triage such as in mass casualty [5] . Automated approaches, once validated, have been shown to reduce inter-and intra-observer variability in radiological assessments [6] . Additionally, CADx tools have gained immense significance in clinical medicine by supplementing medical decision making and improving screening and diagnostic accuracy [7] . These tools combine elements of radiological image processing with computer vision for identifying typical disease manifestations and localize suspicious regions of interest (ROI). At present, recent advances in machine learning, particularly data-driven deep learning (DL) methods using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have shown promising performance in identifying, classifying, and quantifying disease patterns in medical images, particularly CT scans and CXRs [7] . These models learn the hierarchical feature representations from medical images to analyze for typical disease manifestations and localize suspicious densities for ROI evaluation [7] .",

            "text": "A study of the literature reveals several AI efforts for COVID-19 screening. The authors of [3] distinguished COVID-19 viral pneumonia manifestations from that of other viral pneumonia on chest CT scans with high specificity. It was observed that COVID-19 pneumonia was found to be peripherally distributed with ground glass opacities (GGO) and vascular thickening. The authors of [8] established a publicly available collection of 275 CT scans showing COVID-19 pneumonia manifestations and trained a deep CNN to achieve 0.85 F-score in classifying CTs as normal or showing COVID-19 pneumonia-related opacities. The authors of [9] used a customized CNN and pretrained AlexNet model to classify CXRs as normal or showing COVID-19 pneumonia with 94.1% and 98% accuracy respectively. The authors of [10] used a ResNet-50 [11] CNN to classify normal, pneumonia, and COVID-19 viral pneumonia manifestations in CXRs and achieved an accuracy of 98.18 % and F-score of 98.19. CXRs are also commonly analyzed to diagnose and differentiate other types of pneumonia including bacterial and non-COVID-19 viral pneumonia [2] . The authors of [12] proposed a custom CNN model that was designed by combining manual design prototyping with a machine-driven designing approach to classify CXRs as normal, or showing non-COVID-19 or COVID-19 pneumonia-related opacities with 92.4% accuracy. Modality-specific knowledge transfer: With limited amounts of COVID-19 pneumonia CXR data, traditional transfer learning strategies offer promise [13] where the learned feature representations are fine-tuned to improve performance. However, unique challenges posed in the appearance of medical images [6] including high inter-class similarity and low intraclass variance lead to model bias and overfitting resulting in reduced performance and generalization. These issues can be alleviated through modality-specific knowledge transfer by retraining CNN models on a large CXR image collection to learn modality-specific feature representations. Modality-specific model knowledge transfer [14] and ensembles [15] have demonstrated superior disease ROI localization compared to individual constituent models.",

Reed [16] performed a neural model pruning to decrease computational complexity.

The authors of [18] found that the earlier layers in the neural networks have low activations that can effectively be excluded from the network without affecting the model performance. They proposed an iterative optimization method to gradually eliminate the neurons with the least activations toward reducing the memory and power requirements and promoting faster model inference. When applied to medical imaging, the authors of [19] proposed a genetic algorithm-based pathway evolution strategy to prune DL models that resulted in a 34% reduction in the network parameters and improved the mass classification performance in breast mammograms.

These issues can be alleviated by ensemble learning by training multiple models and combining their predictions where an individual model's weaknesses are offset by the predictions of other models. Combined predictions are shown to be superior to individual models [23] . There are several ensemble strategies reported in the literature including max voting, simple and weighted averaging, stacking, boosting, blending and others that are shown to minimize the variance error and improve generalization and performance of CNN models. Applied to CXRs, the authors of [7] , [14] , and [24] leveraged the use of an ensemble of CNN models toward improving TB detection in CXRs. An averaging ensemble of pretrained CNNs was used by the authors of [25] toward improving cardiomegaly detection using CXRs.",

We didn't perform ensemble learning for the binary classification task since the individual models are 100% accurate in classifying CXRs as normal or showing COVID-19 pneumonia-related opacities. Table 5 shows the performance achieved with different ensemble strategies. It can be observed that a simple average of the models' predictions is more accurate with a shorter CI for the AUC metric, signifying a smaller margin of error and therefore, higher precision, compared to other ensemble methods. Considering the F-score and MCC, the averaging ensemble outperformed other ensemble strategies in classifying CXRs as normal, or as showing bacterial pneumonia or COVID-19 viral pneumonia. For the multi-class classification task, we iteratively pruned the task-specific models (VGG-16, VGG-19, and Inception-V3) by removing 2% of the neurons with the highest APoZ in each convolutional layer at a given time step and retrained the pruned model to evaluate its performance on the validation set. We used model checkpoints to store the best-pruned model that gave a superior performance with the validation set. The process is repeated until the maximum pruning percentage of 50% is reached. We then evaluated the performance of all the pruned models on the test set. The pruned model that achieved superior performance with the test set is used for further analysis. Table 6 shows a comparison of the performance achieved by the pruned models to that of the baseline, unpruned taskspecific models shown in Table 4 . It can be observed that the pruned models are more accurate than their unpruned counterparts. Considering the F-score and MCC metrics, the pruned models are found to deliver superior performance than the unpruned models. It is interesting to note that the performance improvement is achieved with a significant reduction in the number of parameters. As can be seen, the number of parameters in the pruned VGG-16 model reduced by 46.03% compared to its unpruned counterpart. Similarly, the number of trainable parameters reduced by 16.13% and 36.1% for the pruned VGG-19 and Inception-V3 models, respectively with the added benefit of performance improvement in terms of accuracy, F-score, and MCC metrics, compared to their unpruned counterparts. Fig. 6 shows the results of performing Grad-CAM visualizations to localize the salient ROIs used by the different pruned models to classify a sample test CXR into the COVID-19 viral pneumonia category. The visualizations are compared with consensus GT annotations provided by the expert radiologists. The predictions of the pruned models are decoded for the test sample. Two-dimensional heat maps are generated in which bright red corresponds to the pixels carrying higher importance and hence weights for categorizing the test sample to the COVID-19 pneumonia infected category. Distinct color transitions are observed for varying ranges of pixel importance toward making the predictions. Salient ROIs are localized by superimposing the heat maps on the input sample CXR. It is observed that the VGG-16 pruned model precisely localizes the salient ROI, followed by the VGG-19 and Inception-V3 pruned models. However, the Inception-V3 pruned model is found to have false negatives, thus missing to localize some salient ROI, compared to the VGG models. The VGG-16 pruned model, because of its architecture depth suitability to the current task, has learned the implicit rules that generalize well and conform to the experts' knowledge about the problem. In this regard, VGG-16 is more accurate with salient ROI localization compared to the other pruned models. Table 7 shows a comparison of the performance metrics achieved with the different ensemble strategies for the unpruned and pruned models toward classifying the CXRs as normal, or showing bacterial pneumonia, or COVID-19 viral pneumonia .
