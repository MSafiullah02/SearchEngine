            "text": "On encountering viral antigens under conditions of appropriate costimulation, T cells proliferate and differentiate into IFN\u03b3-producing cytotoxic CD8 T lymphocytes (CTL) and cytokine-producing Th1 (IFN\u03b3, TNF) or Th2 (IL-4, IL-5) effector CD4 T cells Kaech and Ahmed 2001, van Stipdonk et al. 2001, Mercado et al. 2000, Swain 1999, Dutton et al. 1998. This is a programmed event that can be initiated after only brief contact with the antigen-presenting cell (APC). Studies using limiting dilution assays and transfers of CFSE-labeled T cells indicate that CD8 T cells undergo as many as three divisions a day and divide at least 8 and as many as 15 times before reaching their peak Selin et al. 1996, Kaech and Ahmed 2001. Viral titers are greatly reduced during this T cell expansion phase, after which the T cells decline in number. This silencing of the T cell response is a consequence of T cell apoptosis in spleen and lymph nodes and of the dissemination of T cells into the peripheral tissue Razvi et al. 1995a, Masopust et al. 2001, Marshall et al. 2001. Some of these T cells resist the apoptotic events and enter a memory pool, where they provide enhanced protection of the host on reexposure to a pathogen and act to prevent low-grade persisting viruses from reemerging.",

Memory T cells need to be antigen specific, easy to reactivate, and present at a high frequency for a substantial period of time to be fully effective in this role. Previous reviews have described these aspects of T cell memory Dutton et al. 1998, Ahmed and Gray 1996, Zinkernagel 2002. We think it best, however, to view memory cells not simply as a cluster of individuals but, instead, as part of an interactive network, which is continually evolving as immune responses composed of some cells alter the frequencies, distributions, and activities of others. This network is composed of a diverse repertoire of naive and memory T cells, which compete with each other for niches in an ever-changing microcosm. With each virus infection, the adaptive immune response generates a diverse repertoire of antigen-specific memory T cells to a variety of immunodominant epitopes. These T cells need to be accommodated in many different local environments throughout the tissues of the host. During subsequent infections, the resident memory T cells must once again compete with the new T cells in the finite space of the immune system. These ever-changing networks of T cell populations provide the immune system with a resilient plasticity to combat infections.",

Although memory CD8 T cells are consistently CD44hi, they are heterogeneous in expression of other surface molecules, including lymph node homing receptors (CD62L, CCR7) Razvi et al. 1995b, Sallusto et al. 1999, Tripp et al. 1995 and molecules associated with costimulation (CD27, CD28) Appay et al. 2002, Tomiyama et al. 2002 or activation state (CD45RA and CD45RO) Appay et al. 2002, Champagne et al. 2001. Viral antigen-specific CD8 T cells migrate to and reside at high frequencies throughout the organs of the host, including lung, kidney, gut, fat pads, and liver Masopust et al. 2001, Chen et al. 2001, Hogan et al. 2001. In the absence of antigen, \u201cresting\u201d memory T cells are not quiescent. A portion of the memory CD8 T population undergoes a continuous but low-level homeostatic proliferation that must be offset by apoptosis, as their frequencies remain stable Sprent and Tough 1996, Zimmermann et al. 1996. Blast-size memory CD8 T cells in the spleens of lymphocytic choriomeningitis (LCMV)-immune mice are cytolytically active when exposed to sensitive targets, indicating that some memory cells exist in an effector state (Selin and Welsh, 1997). These cytolytically active \u201ceffector memory\u201d cells are also present at relatively high levels in the peripheral tissues of mice immune to vesicular stomatitis virus (Masopust et al., 2001). Examination of memory cells by their physical or functional phenotype and anatomical location led some investigators to describe memory T cells in terms of two major subsets: central memory cells, which express CCR7 (or CD62L) and localize in secondary lymphoid tissue, and effector memory cells, which lack CCR7 (or CD62L) and remain in peripheral organs Sallusto et al. 1999, Champagne et al. 2001.",

Three models have recently been proposed for lineage differentiation. The first model is based on expression of L-selectin (CD62L) and CCR7, which are receptors involved in homing to lymphoid tissue. These two receptors, along with the presence or absence of CD45RA, define three subsets of memory cells: central memory cells, effector memory cells, and terminally differentiated effector cells (Sallusto et al., 1999). Examinations of HIV- and human cytomegalovirus (HCMV)-specific CD8 T cells led investigators to propose a linear differentiation scheme whereby naive CD4 or CD8 T cells (CD45RA+CD62L+CCR7+) on encountering antigen mature into central memory cells (CD45\u2212CD62L+CCR7+), effector memory cells (CD45RA\u2212CD62L\u2212CCR7\u2212), and finally, terminally differentiated effector cells (CD45RA+CD62L\u2212CCR7\u2212) (Champagne et al., 2001). The second model for human T cell differentiation is based on downregulation of the costimulatory molecules CD27 and CD28, along with CD45RA in HCMV- and Epstein Barr virus (EBV)-specific T cell responses. In this pathway, naive cells (CD45RA+CD27+CD28+) mature into early-differentiated cells (CD45RA\u2212CD28+CD27+), intermediate cells (CD45RA\u2212CD28\u2212CD27+), and finally, fully differentiated cells (CD45RA\u2212CD28\u2212CD27\u2212) Tomiyama et al. 2002, Wills et al. 2002, Hamaan et al. 1997. A third model using the murine LCMV infection utilized CD62L expression and the time course of virus clearance after infection. This third model demonstrated results that were the opposite of the first model, as naive cells (CD62L+) upon antigen exposure matured into effectors (CD62L\u2212), then effector memory (CD62\u2212), and finally central memory (CD62L+) (Wherry et al., 2003b).",

Central memory (CCR7+, CD62L+ [first and third models]) or early differentiated (CD45\u2212, CD27+, CD28+ [second model]) phenotypes appear to be more resistant to apoptosis and cycle more rapidly, and, upon antigen exposure, are better at producing IL-2 and proliferating when compared to the effector (CCR7\u2212, CD62L\u2212 [first and third models]) or late fully differentiated (CD45\u2212, CD27\u2212, CD28\u2212 [second model]) phenotype memory T cells Sallusto et al. 1999, Champagne et al. 2001, Wherry et al. 2003b. The interchangeability of these populations remains unclear. As indicated in the third model, adoptive transfer studies in the mice have shown that effector memory T cells can convert back into central memory T cells, suggesting a reversible differentiation scheme (Wherry et al., 2003b). On the other hand, a human T cell receptor (TCR) repertoire study using CD45RA and CD62L to define effector and memory populations found that 90% of the clonotypes were not in common between the effector and central memory CD8 T cell populations (Baron et al., 2003). This surprising result would suggest that a differentiation pathway between those subsets was less likely or else that there was a very selective proliferation or apoptosis of T cells within those subtypes.",

Examples of this heterogeneity include cytokine-producing weakly cytotoxic cells low in perforin, as shown with HIV (Appay et al., 2000); cytokine-producing weakly cytotoxic cells high in perforin, as shown in murine polymavirus infections (Moser et al., 2001); and weakly cytotoxic cells that do not produce cytokines, as shown in SIV infection in monkeys (Xiong et al., 2001). Among the interesting factors now found to modulate CD8 T cell function are the acquisition of inhibitory natural killer cell receptors, such as CD94 (NKG2A) Moser et al. 2001, Moser et al. 2002. Inhibitory receptors have now been reported to modulate the functions of T cells in HIV and EBV infections in humans and polyomavirus infections in mice Moser et al. 2001, Moser et al. 2002, Vely et al. 2001, De Maria et al. 1997. Studies with persistent LCMV infections in mice, initiated as a consequence of high dose infection with a widely disseminating strain (clone 13), have illustrated how high viral loads can modulate T cell frequencies and functions in complicated fashions Zajac et al. 1998, Moskophidis et al. 1993. In the LCMV system, some (e.g., NP396) specific T cells, which are probably most highly stimulated by antigen, are completely eliminated from the host. However, T cells with other specificities (e.g., GP33) undergo various states of anergy in which there is a loss in cytolytic ability, IL-2, TNF\u03b1, and then IFN\u03b3 production, in that order Fuller and Zajac 2003, Wherry et al. 2003a. In LCMV persistently infected hosts, the CD8 T cells seemed to be lost or anergized more in lymphoid organs than in the periphery (Wherry et al., 2003a). This may reflect recent evidence showing that LCMV-specific CD8 T cells during the acute infection are more resistant to apoptosis in peripheral than in lymphoid tissues (Wang et al., 2003). Thus, tissue-dependent factors may influence the fate of T cells.",

The development of MHC-tetramers has enhanced the study of viral antigen-specific T cell populations by allowing for the purification of epitope-specific T cell populations. Using this technique, Perlman and colleagues examined the V\u03b213 TCR repertoire to a mouse hepatitis virus S510 epitope, sequenced 35 to 85 TCR per mouse in nine mice, and estimated a frequency of 300\u2013500 unique clonotypes specific for that epitope (Pewe et al., 1999). Stern and colleagues demonstrated diversity in human memory CD4 T cell responses to influenza A using MHC class II HLA-DR1-restricted tetramers to an HA epitope with 35 different clonotypes out of 110 sequences (Camereon et al., 2002). Naumov et al. have shown in human studies that the CD8 memory response to the HLA-A2-restricted influenza A epitope M1-58-specific consisted of 141 unique clonotypes out of 500 V\u03b217 sequences (Naumov et al., 2003).",

This means that a small number of clones were present at high frequencies and ever-increasing numbers of clones were present at lower and lower frequencies. Furthermore, when the structure of the M1-specific repertoire was analyzed by focusing on many different subsets of the repertoire, such as clonotypes using J\u03b22.7 or those whose CDR3 region encodes the amino acid sequence IRSS, the clonotype frequencies still maintained a power law-like distribution. This indicates a self similarity to the repertoire in which smaller subsections of the repertoire form a distribution similar to that of the larger whole repertoire. The power law-like distribution and the self similarity, which described this influenza A M1-58-specific response, suggested that this repertoire was organized in the form of a fractal system. Fractal systems occur throughout nature, in such common forms as snowflakes, trees, and blood vessels, where there is a self similarity of structure. We do not understand the mechanisms which drive the memory T cell repertoire to develop as a fractal system, but it is notable as it is also seen in B cell systems. This type of organization may be another reflection of the flexibility of the adaptive T cell immune response. The high number of low-frequency clones means there is a great breadth to an epitope-specific memory response. Thus, if antigenic variants were to elicit the recall response, then some of the many diverse low-frequency clones expressing TCRs capable of recognizing the mutant Ag might be selectively expanded as new major clones. This flexibility of repertoire selection would be an advantage in both antiviral and antitumor responses where antigenic variants can be quite common.",

Thus, the TCRs on the antigen-specific T cell clones are unique to the individual, and these unique regions have been referred to as the \u201cprivate specificity\u201d for that epitope-specific response. This variation is probably a consequence of the random stochastic process of TCR rearrangement in the thymus, which results in variations in the naive peripheral TCR repertoire, and of the random stochastic process whereby a T cell encounters an APC presenting its cognate ligand (Bousso et al., 1998).

This suggests that lower-affinity altered peptide ligands might more easily activate effectors or effector memory cells in comparison to resting memory CD8 T cells. The virus-induced cytokine environment may also enhance crossreactive effector responses; for instance, since cytokines such as IL-12 are known to synergize with antigen to enhance IFN\u03b3 production by T cells it is easy to envision IL-12 enhancing IFN\u03b3 production in low-affinity TCR interactions (Gately et al., 1998).",

The mobilization of crossreactive memory cells into a primary immune response can alter the immunodominance of subsequent T cell responses. In genetically identical animals with a naive immune system, the hierarchy of T cells specific to immunodominant epitopes is consistent and predictable (Brehm et al., 2002). However, studies in humans have shown that there is variability in the hierarchies of T cells responding to different HLA-A2-restricted HIV epitopes in individual patients (Betts et al., 2000). This disparity in epitope hierarchies could be caused either by genetics or by the environment, where humans have a lifetime history of earlier infections that may have altered the T cell repertoire and influence the immunodominance hierarchy. In fact, studies in the mouse have shown that T cell immunodominance can be greatly affected by previous antigenic exposures that might elicit crossreactive responses. Brehm et al. showed that LCMV and PV encoded crossreactive epitopes, with six of eight amino acids in common (Figure 1)\n(Brehm et al., 2002). Responses to these epitopes were subdominant in each infection, accounting for less than 3% and 1% of the acute and memory CD8 responses, respectively, for each infection. However, if LCMV-immune mice were infected with PV, or if PV-immune mice were infected with LCMV, the T cell responses to these epitopes became dominant, reaching levels as high as 20% of the CD8 T cells. In contrast, T cell responses to the normally dominant epitopes were much lower. Thus, infections with heterologous viruses can alter immunodominance when crossreactive responses are present. This phenomenon is reminiscent of the concept of clonal imprinting or original antigenic sin that was proposed initially to explain the anamnestic antibody response to crossreactive B cell epitopes of related influenza virus strains (Fazekas de St. Groth and Webster, 1966).",

The mobilization of crossreactive memory cells into a primary immune response can alter not only immunodominance profiles but also disease outcome by influencing both protective immunity and immunopathology. Protective heterologous immunity has been shown with a number of viruses Selin et al. 1998, Selin et al. 2000, Welsh and Selin 2002. For instance, LCMV-immune mice challenged with VV (LCMV + VV) demonstrated partial protective immunity at 4 days postinfection, with altered immunopathology in both systemic (i.p.) and respiratory (i.n.) infection models Selin et al. 1998, Chen et al. 2001. Protective immunity was transferred by LCMV-immune CD8 and CD4 T cell populations and was dependent on IFN\u03b3. Notably, at 3 days after VV infection, 15%\u201330% of lung memory CD8 T cells specific to each of six LCMV epitopes produced IFN\u03b3 in vivo. It is not clear whether this early IFN\u03b3 production was caused by crossreactivity or by a nonselective cytokine-dependent activation, but the IFN\u03b3 contributed to the clearance of VV. Later in infection there was a selective expansion LCMV-specific T cells with some but not other epitope specificities, consistent with a crossreactive antigen-driven expansion (Welsh et al., 2004).",

The respiratory infection with VV resulted in dramatic differences in pathology, associated with accumulation of LCMV-specific CD8 T cells in a greatly enhanced bronchus-associated lymphocyte tissue (BALT) surrounding the airways and with the induction of bronchiolitis obliterans (Chen et al., 2001), which can be observed in humans sporadically during viral and intracellular bacterial infections and during lung transplant rejection (Schlesinger et al., 1998).

Although immunity to LCMV protected against respiratory VV infection, it inhibited the clearance of RSV Chen et al. 2001, Ostler et al. 2003. Similarly, a history of influenza A infection protected against VV but inhibited clearance of MCMV and LCMV (Chen et al., 2003). During MCMV infection, prior immunity to influenza A also dramatically altered early cytokine profiles, enhancing proinflammatory cytokines, such as IL-6, IL-12, and IL-1\u03b2 (Figure 3)\n. Instead of the usual mild mononuclear infiltrate observed in acute MCMV infection of naive mice, influenza-immune mice infected with MCMV developed a severe consolidating mononuclear pneumonia with evidence of bronchiolization (Figure 3). During bronchiolization, alveolar epithelium is replaced by bronchiolar-like cells, and this is thought to be an indicator of lung repair (Nettesheim and Szakal, 1972). Patterns of heterologous immunity can therefore be complicated and difficult to predict, although they are quite reproducible in experimental models.",

Naive mice have very few allospecific T cells of the memory phenotype, but, as a consequence of crossreactivity, viral infections leave mice with much higher frequencies of allo-specific memory T cells. For example, about 1% of the CD8 T cells in LCMV-immune C57BL/6 mice (H2b) are memory cells specific to H2d alloantigens (Brehm et al., 2003). Crossreactivity with alloantigens is extremely diverse, in that some of the T cells specific to each of four tested LCMV-encoded epitopes reacted against allogeneic targets expressing H2d. Considerable effort has gone into developing tolerization protocols to enable hosts to accept and maintain allogeneic tissue engraftment. However, mice with a history of viral infections are more difficult to tolerize to accept grafts (Welsh et al., 2000), and acute viral infections can break tolerance and stimulate the rejections of allografts in tolerized mice Brehm et al. 2003, Adams et al. 2003.",

Reactivation of crossreactive memory T cells may play a role in mediating autoimmune diseases, such as multiple sclerosis, diabetes mellitus, Crohn's disease, or rheumatoid arthritis. Virus-induced autoimmunity may be a consequence of many factors, including disregulation of regulatory T cells or providing helper factors for self-reactive T cells. However, there may be conditions where there is a direct crossreactivity between viral and self antigens, and such T cells might get activated again by another viral infection. An HSV-specific CD8 T cell response in mice is directed against a viral epitope that is sufficiently similar to a corneal self antigen to induce autoimmune herpes stromal keratitis (Zhao et al., 1998). Some EBV-specific CD8 T cell clones, which recognize crossreactive self peptides, have been found in joints of humans afflicted with rheumatoid arthritis Edinger et al. 1999, Misko et al. 1999. Mice expressing an LCMV NP transgene in the brain develop transient encephalitis after infection with LCMV but not with heterologous viruses PV or VV (Evans et al., 1996). However, after LCMV has broken tolerance and elicited a memory CD8 T cell response that is specific to the self \u201cNP\u201d antigen expressed in the brain, subsequent infections with these heterologous viruses are now able to reactivate these memory T cells and reelicit the disease. This may be a mechanism for autoimmune diseases that undergo exacerbations and remissions.",

Individuals who have been immunized with Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG), a strong Th1 inducer, have a decreased frequency of atopy, which is Th2 dependent, as compared to those who did not receive this immunization (Shirakawa et al., 1997). Also, mice immunized with BCG suppressed a Th2-type response and the associated eosinophilia in the lung when exposed to an allergen (Erb et al., 1998). Mice infected with influenza virus before vaccination with VV-RSV G protein developed a Th1-type response on RSV challenge instead of the expected Th2 response and cleared RSV without developing severe eosinophilia (Walzl et al., 2000).

For, example, T cell responses to HSV are more profound in hosts treated with low doses of cyclophosphamide (Pfizenmaier et al., 1977). The relationship between these events remains unclear, but it has recently been shown that the virus-induced lymphopenia is more dramatic in young than in old mice, and young mice tend to generate a stronger T cell response to a virus than old mice (Jiang et al., 2003b).",

The recovery of bona fide memory CD8 T cells from their lymphopenia-associated loss would be dependent on their ability to compete with the antigen-specific T cells responding to the ongoing infection and with T cells homeostatically expanding to fill the lymphopenic environment. Interestingly, lymphopenic environments induce the homeostatic proliferation of CD8 T cells, which expand in number until the environment is replete with cells that phenotypically resemble bona fide memory cells (Freitas and Rocha, 2000). These naive CD44lo CD8 T cells, which upregulate CD44 and proliferate in response to signals from IL-7 and IL-15, represent another example of the plasticity in functional phenotypes of memory T cell populations Tan et al. 2002, Goldrath et al. 2002. Not all of these cells proliferate comparably, and it is thought that those undergoing the greatest degree of homeostatic division may be self reactive with host antigens. The net effect is that there are considerable numbers of these CD44hi CD8 \u201cpseudomemory\u201d cells that have not gone through the differentiation scheme of bona fide memory cells.",

An active model would predict that there is a mechanism that selectively kills off the preexisting memory cells. The obvious candidate for such an active model would be the lymphopenia that occurs early during infection. Recent kinetic studies on the survival of PV-specific T cells after LCMV infection in mice have indicated that the memory cells, once depleted, fail to recover and remain depleted in long-term memory (Kim and Welsh, 2004).

Indeed, after an across-the-board deletion as a consequence of lymphopenia, crossreactive T cells will extensively proliferate and influence T cell immunodominance in the next infection (Brehm et al., 2002)\n(Figure 4)\n. Hence, a history of a previous infection can influence the T cell response to a subsequent infection, and a second infection can activate memory T cells specific for previously encountered pathogens. The T cell repertoire specific to a pathogen can thus be permanently changed by subsequent infections with putatively unrelated viruses. Significantly, these continuously evolving memory T cell responses participate in and influence disease outcome of each new infection, whether it be harmful or beneficial to the host.",

Depending on the private specificity of the TCR repertoire in each host, this repertoire may contain memory T cells crossreactive with allo-antigens (mouse A) or with autoantigens (mouse B). If there are LCMV-specific memory T cells crossreactive with a heterologous virus, such as VV, as in mouse A (yellow dots), these would preferentially expand upon infection with VV.
