Ebola, like other epidemics, seems to draw on a familiar store of images and metaphors\u2014of parasites and hot zones, desperate patients, and intrepid disease detectives. The dramatic arc of the epidemic from progressive revelation, to crisis and recrimination, seems to conform to a classic three-act Greek tragedy. But if Ebola echoes earlier epidemics, which ones? And what can the parallels with those earlier epidemics tell us about the closing scenes of the current outbreak of Ebola?",

But in other respects Ebola has more in common with the epidemics of yellow fever and cholera of the 18th and 19th centuries. Then, as now, reports of the spreading depredations, carried on ships plying the triangular trade between Africa, the Caribbean, and Europe, or by Jewish immigrants fleeing pogroms in Tsarist Russia, fuelled colonial fears of the \u201cdark continent\u201d and contamination from the \u201cuncivilised\u201d East. Then, as now, the loss of bodily fluids was deeply disturbing to a culture grown accustomed to concealing human emissions behind a veil of polite discourse. And then, as now, politicians struggled to balance free trade concerns with the growing popular clamour for restrictions to safeguard public health and national security.",

Instead, the desperate citizens of Philadelphia, New Orleans, and Memphis called for quarantines to keep vessels suspected of communicating the fever between ports from introducing the dreaded \u201cyellow jack\u201d to their cities. But commerce was the lifeblood of the young American republic and for every believer in contagion theory there was an anti-contagionist convinced that the problem lay not with Atlantic trading vessels but with local environmental conditions and the miasmas that bred in the filth of wharfside communities.",

In the 1878 epidemic in Memphis alone 47 000 citizens fled the city. Of those that remained, two thirds would contract the fever and one third\u2014some 5000 people in all\u2014would die. By the second week in September, Dr William T Ramsey, a correspondent for The Washington Post, reported that the stench of Memphis's dead could be smelled from 5 miles away. \u201cNo words can describe the filth I saw, the rotten wooden pavements, the dead animals, putrefying human bodies, and the half-buried dead combining to make the atmosphere something dreadful\u201d, he wrote. Yellow fever is, indeed, terrifying to behold: the virus attacks every organ of the body, causing high fever, delirium, and the leaking of bloody haemorrhagic fluids from bodily orifices. In the final throes of the disease patients also frequently bring up a black haemorrhagic vomit. As the virus attacks the liver victims also turn yellow.",

In the UK, it was the prospect of \u201cAsiatic cholera\u201d that filled people with dread, not the forms of dysentery and domestic cholera that were a regular seasonal occurrence in working-class districts running with sewerage. And just as in Sierra Leone and Liberia today, so in the 19th century hygienic measures aimed at stemming the spread of disease often met with fierce resistance. During the 1832 cholera epidemic in Exeter, for instance, regulations that required the disposal of the dead in municipal graves sparked widespread rioting. Similar riots were seen in Liverpool where physicians were suspected of hastening the death of cholera victims and selling their corpses to anatomists. Popular distrust of the medical profession also ran high in Prussia where physicians were suspected of poisoning the wells as part of a plot by the wealthy to reduce the burden on the state of the poor. Even as late as the 1892 cholera epidemic in Germany, the attempt to enforce hygiene measures in Hamburg led to an angry mob beating to death a sanitary officer.",

Thus when news reached New York in August, 1892, that a steamship crowded with Russian Jewish people fleeing cholera in Hamburg was headed for Manhattan, medical historian Howard Markel reports that The New York Times called for the port health authority to bar them entry, describing them as \u201chuman riff-raff\u201d whose \u201cmode of life\u2026makes them always a source of danger\u201d. The result was that by the 1890s federal quarantine powers granted to the Marine Hospital Service during the 1878 yellow fever epidemic in the southern US states were increasingly being abused by states and local port authorities to deny entry to immigrants in the north. Indeed, such was the hysteria about the dangers presented by Russian Jewish immigrants to New York that in September, 1892, President Benjamin Harrison signed an executive order mandating 20-day quarantines for the occupants of \u201ccholera ships\u201d. That order halted immigration to the USA for 5 months. However, it applied only to those in steerage class\u2014passengers in higher priced cabins were exempted.",

In Manhattan, Markel observes, the city's Health Commissioner, Cyrus Edson, ordered a dragnet of Jewish tenements on the lower east side, instructing officials to \u201chunt up all persons with intestinal disorders\u201d. In scenes reminiscent of the forcible containment of Ebola patients by medical orderlies wearing protective clothing and masks in Freetown today, suspicious cases were hauled into horse-driven ambulances by officials wearing rubber suits, while those with full-blown cholera were placed in large canvas bags with drawstrings around the neck. For many Jewish immigrants the measures recalled the horror of the typhus round-ups that had followed the arrival in New York 6 months earlier of many of their brethren on a ship from Constantinople. Then occupants of tenements that had welcomed passengers infected with typhus were removed along with the sick to a lazaretto in the East River where they became easy prey for the lice that bred in their co-religionists' clothing. Worse, many were denied burials in accordance with Jewish law. Little wonder then that when cholera arrived, some Jewish families went out of their way to avoid doctors and health officials.",

Moved by the plight of Memphis, people from the northern states wired money to the city while train companies sent supplies of food. And just as present-day medics have been willing to risk their lives in west Africa, so in 1878 Dr Mitchell Howard's Medical Corps sent 111 doctors and nurses to the aid of Memphians\u2014all but one contracted yellow fever and 33 died.",

Despite the southern states' history of slavery and the recent experience of the Civil War, historian Jeanette Keith recounts how African-American grave diggers worked into the night to bury prominent white victims, despite being told by their white bosses that they would not be paid overtime. Sex workers also died rather than abandon care of the sick. \u201cThe epidemic turned all common categories of trust and honour upside down\u201d, Keith writes, \u201cand reduced good and evil to the most basic question: do you leave your people to die, or do you help?\u201d",

Meanwhile, in the USA, in scenes reminiscent of the 19th-century tensions over cholera, many states continue to insist on restrictions on returning health workers over and above the guidelines set down by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In other words, we are still in the crisis and recrimination phase. It remains to be seen whether there will be a fourth act and if it will be cathartic.",
