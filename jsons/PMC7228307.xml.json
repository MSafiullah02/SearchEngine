Upon cell activation, cytoskeletal remodeling is associated with the loss of the receptor corrals, allowing Fc\u03b3Rs and other receptors to freely diffuse, engage ligand, cluster and signal.39 The influence of such surface constraints on receptors and effector cell function helps explain some of the observed epitope distance requirements for optimal mAb function,39, 41 which were apparent in a comparative study of ADCC and ADCP.42 ADCC was optimal when the epitope was displayed close, 0.3 nm \u201cflush\u201d or 1.5 nm, to the target membrane where close conjugation of effector and target by the mAb presumably facilitates the delivery of pore\u2010forming proteins to the target membrane as required by ADCC. Interestingly, complement\u2010dependent cytotoxicity which also utilizes pore\u2010forming proteins for its cytotoxicity has similar distance constraints. By contrast, ADCP was poor  when targeting epitopes displayed close or \"flush\" to the target cell membrane (within ~0.3 nm) but ADCP activity was restored when the epitope was displayed 1.5 nm off the membrane, demonstrating different optimal epitope distance requirements for ADCC and ADCP.42\n",
