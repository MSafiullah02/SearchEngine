Human bocavirus (HBoV) is a newly described parvovirus. HBoV1 has been associated with respiratory infections, including acute otitis media (AOM), but the knowledge on the significance of HBoV1 in upper respiratory tract infections (URI) and AOM in relation to other respiratory viruses is limited. The objective of this study was to compare the rate of detection of HBoV1 to that of other respiratory viruses in specimens from children with URI, with and without AOM complication. Methods. Nasopharyngeal secretions (NPS) were collected during URI from healthy children (6-35 months) followed prospectively for 1 year; specimens have been previously analyzed for broad spectrum of respiratory viruses. Archived NPS were analyzed for HBoV1 using a high-throughput, quantitative polymerase chain reaction method. Results. Seven hundred and seven NPS samples collected during URI episodes from 201 children were studied for HBoV1. A total of 94 (47%) children tested positive for HBoV1 DNA during 172 (24%) URI episodes; HBoV1 was present as the only virus in 44 (6%) URI episodes. Overall, 37% of URI episodes were complicated by AOM. Of URI associated with single virus (n = 303), the rate of AOM complicating URI associated with HBoV1 only was 52% (23 of 44); this was a higher AOM rate, compared to that of other respiratory viruses. Conclusions. Among URI associated with single respiratory virus, HBoV1-URI was commonly associated with AOM complication.

Our findings suggest that HBoV1 may play an important role in AOM pathogenesis, similar to other viruses such as RSV, adenoviruses, and coronaviruses [10, 20] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 535, "end": 539, "text": "[10,", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 540, "end": 543, "text": "20]", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "The HBoV1 is now recognized as a respiratory virus [5] ; it has been detected in the MEF of children with AOM [12] and active HBoV1 infection documented by serology significantly associate with AOM development [14] . However, it is known that HBoV-DNA can be detected in asymptomatic children [15] due to prolonged presence of the viral nucleic acids. Therefore, detection of HBoV1-DNA alone in the NPS might not be sufficient to document active HBoV1 infection. Unfortunately, we were unable to confirm active HBoV1 infection in our study by serology. Due to the longitudinal nature of the study and nonsevere nature of viral URI and AOM, we were not able to include blood drawing for acute and convalescent serology in our design. Nevertheless, indirect evidence exists to support the role of active HBoV1 infection in our cases with URI associated with HBoV1 alone. First, we used extensive viral diagnostic methods to detect a variety of common respiratory viruses during symptomatic URI, although we did not detect less common, newly described viruses such as polyomaviruses and parechoviruses. Negative findings for other viruses but positive finding for HBoV1 only suggested the association between HBoV1 (a recognized respiratory virus) and acute symptoms. Second, viral load in the cases of HBoV1 alone was relatively high (mean viral load, 1.8 \u00d7 10 10 copies/mL of the original sample; range, 3.2 \u00d7 10 3 to 5.5 \u00d7 10 11 ). Lastly, in our recently published study using NPS samples from the same cohort [21] , concentrations of lactate dehydrogenase, a marker for cellular injury during inflammation, are associated with the rate of AOM complication after URI and with the presence of adenovirus, rhinovirus, and HBoV1. These findings together support the association between the presence of HBoV1 and its clinical significance during URI episodes for which no other virus was detected. The incidence of HBoV1 detection in our patients with URI (24%) is among the highest published; overall, the incidence of HBoV has ranged from 5% to 33% in children with respiratory infection [2-4, 15, 22-23] . The higher incidence of HBoV detection in longitudinal studies, compared with that in cross-sectional studies, is likely from prolonged presence of the virus in the respiratory tract. The same reason may also explain high frequencies of concurrent detection of HBoV with other viruses, which has been reported to occur up to 72% [13, 15, 22, [24] [25] . In our study, 45% of children with HBoV1 in the NPS had the virus detected more than once. Prolonged shedding of HBoV1 in nasal secretions has been described up to 11 weeks in children attending day care [15] and up to 3 months in otitis-prone children [26] . Extended viral shedding has also been observed with other DNA-viruses; in the same study population, we studied genetic sequences of adenoviruses and found that repeated presence could be from the same viral serotype and strain detected continuously or intermittently, or different serotype or strain detected sequentially [27] . Further studies of the viral genome in children with sequential HBoV1 are required, to differentiate between prolonged presence of the viral and reinfection with different HBoV isolates. These types of studies will help elucidate the natural history and foster the understanding of the pathogenicity of HBoV1 infection.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 51, "end": 54, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 110, "end": 114, "text": "[12]", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 210, "end": 214, "text": "[14]", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 293, "end": 297, "text": "[15]", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 1511, "end": 1515, "text": "[21]", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 2087, "end": 2103, "text": "[2-4, 15, 22-23]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2435, "end": 2439, "text": "[13,", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 2440, "end": 2443, "text": "15,", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 2444, "end": 2447, "text": "22,", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 2448, "end": 2452, "text": "[24]", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 2453, "end": 2457, "text": "[25]", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 2664, "end": 2668, "text": "[15]", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 2713, "end": 2717, "text": "[26]", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 3043, "end": 3047, "text": "[27]", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "In conclusion, HBoV1 was a common virus detected alone or in combination with other respiratory viruses during URI.
