Although aerosol transmission has been postulated, clinical and epidemiological observation during the past 40 years provides convincing evidence that direct exposure to blood or bodily secretions is usually required for transmission of Lassa virus between humans [3, 6].

Among >25 imported cases with at least 1500 cumulative identified contacts reported since 1969, only a single putative and asymptomatic instance of secondary transmission of Lassa virus has been noted [31] (A. Sanzone, personal communication).",

However, mortality data are derived primarily from infections with the Josiah strain or close variants circulating in Sierra Leone, Liberia, or Guinea [54, 55, 58\u201360]. Strains from Nigeria are often considered to be more virulent [53, 61]. Severe and fatal disease may occur with all strains of Lassa virus, but, other than during the third trimester of pregnancy, in which maternal and fetal mortality are elevated, no prognostic indicators are known that would identify, prior to disease onset, patients who will ultimately develop severe Lassa fever and for whom PEP would logically be indicated [41]. Anecdotally, morbidity and mortality seem to be increased in expatriates relative to native Africans (D.G.B., unpublished observation). Whether this represents a genetic difference in susceptibility or the consequence of partial immunity from previous infection in populations indigenous to areas of endemicity is unknown.",

In cell culture experiments, ribavirin has been reported to have a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) for Lassa virus in the range of 4\u201340 \u00b5mol/L. The median inhibitory concentration (IC50), reported either as IC50 or effective dose (ED50), ranges from 37 \u00b5mol/L to 82 \u00b5mol/L [43, 62, 67, 68]. IC50 and ED50 have also been reported for various other arenaviruses, including Junin virus (IC50, 4.5\u201313 \u00b5mol/L; ED50, 90 \u00b5mol/L), Machupo virus (ED50, 131 \u00b5mol/L), Tacaribe virus (IC50, 4.5 \u00b5mol/L), and Pichinde virus (ED50, 246 \u00b5mol/L) [43, 69\u201371]. Ribavirin concentrations in the range of the MIC or IC50 for Lassa virus can be achieved relatively easily with intravenous administration, in which single doses of 600\u20132400 mg produced peak serum concentrations of 47\u2013161 \u00b5mol/L [72]. Ribavirin in patients with Lassa fever produced mean peak serum levels of 32.1\u201394 \u00b5mol/L after 4 days of 4000 mg administered intravenously daily (1000 mg every 6 h) and 68 \u00b5mol/L after continued treatment with 500 mg administered intravenously every 8 h for 6 days [68, 73]. In the single study in which the drug's efficacy for treatment of Lassa fever in humans was assessed, the dose of intravenous ribavirin used was a 2-g loading dose, followed by 1 g every 6 h for 4 days, followed by 500 mg every 8 h for 6 days (total course, 10 days) [10].",

In calculating the risk of infection, clinicians should realize that titers of Lassa virus in blood and bodily secretions correlate with disease severity [10]. The most infectious patients are those with severe clinical conditions, usually late in the course of illness. In all cases, the exposure to the index case must be during the period of acute febrile illness [48].

For a 70-kg adult, this translates to an \u223c2.4-g loading dose, followed by 1 g taken 3 times a day. This regimen is derived from the standard intravenous dose, taking into account the 50% mean oral bioavailability (which theoretically requires a doubling of the intravenous dose when given orally), with modifications for tolerability and ease of administration. This represents a cumulative maintenance dose of only 54%, compared with the standard intravenous regimen, which may not achieve the target MIC for Lassa virus in all cases. However, considering that mortality in Lassa fever correlates with the viral load, prophylaxis or therapy that lowers the level of viremia could reasonably be presumed to decrease severity, even if disease still occurs [10, 62, 64]. Ribavirin is excreted primarily through the kidneys; therefore, the dose should be decreased in persons known to have significant renal insufficiecy (creatinine clearance, <50 mL/min) [78, 80, 81].",

These guidelines may also serve for PEP for the other arenaviruses causing hemorrhagic fever (Junin, Machupo, Guanarito, Sabi\u00e1, and Flexal viruses) as well as for Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus. Although efficacy trials involving humans are likely impossible, studies in nonhuman primates can and should be conducted to confirm the efficacy of oral ribavirin PEP for these diseases. These data could also guide decisions on whether oral ribavirin merits inclusion in the US Strategic National Stockpile. In vitro and in vivo testing should be conducted to assess the efficacy of newer antivirals against arenaviruses and other hemorrhagic fever viruses for consideration in both PEP and treatment regimens. This could include drugs that are already licensed for other indications as well as promising drugs still at the experimental stage.",
