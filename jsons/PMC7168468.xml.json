Advantages of the MALDI\u2010Q\u2010TOF combination for proteomics and glycomics have been stressed in a brief focus paper (Huang, 2003). Figure 1 shows the year\u2010by\u2010year increase in papers reporting use of MALDI MS for carbohydrate analysis for the period 1990\u20132004. As the review is designed to complement the earlier work, structural formulae, etc. that were presented earlier are not repeated. However, a citation to the structure in the earlier works is indicated by its number with a prefix (i.e., 1/x refers to structure x in the first review and 2/x to the second). Other reviews and review\u2010type articles directly concerned with, or including MALDI analysis of glycoconjugates that have been published during the review period include general reviews by Harvey (2003), Stuhler and Meyer (2004), and Zaia (2004), a review of capillary electrophoresis\u2010mass spectrometry for glycoscreening (Zamfir & Peter\u2010Katalinic, 2004) and a review on new methods for mass spectrometry of bioorganic macromolecules (Cristoni & Bernsrdi, 2003).

Yassin and Marynick (2003) have calculated the gas\u2010phase acidities of the radical cations of all six dihydroxybenzoic acid (DHB) isomers using density functional theory and found excellent agreement with experimental measurements. The 2,5\u2010isomer (1/26), the most effective matrix, was the least acidic (in this review the abbreviation DHB is used for the 2,5\u2010isomer, unless stated otherwise). The results indicate that, as proposed earlier (Gimon et al., 1992), deprotonation occurs at the phenolic rather than the acidic site as the result of resonance stabilization of the resulting ion. This conclusion is consistent with the theory proposed by Harvey (1993) that one of the reasons that the 2,5\u2010isomer is so effective a matrix is that it is the only one that can form a p\u2010benzoquinone\u2010type (5) structure after photochemical decarboxylation.\nchemical structure image\n",

Among those containing a charge, and which formed M+ ions, the pyridinium derivative (13) was the most efficient, producing a detection limit of 1 fmol. The guanidine derivatives formed [M + H]+ ions and some produced equal detection limits. It would appear that the most efficient derivatives possessed both good ion\u2010forming properties and high lipophilicity. Improved detection limits have also been achieved by use of hydrazide derivatives of the cyanine dyes Cy\u20103 (14) or Cy\u20105 (15) that contain a constituent positive charge (Kameyama et al., 2004). N\u2010glycans from chicken ovalbumin could be detected with near independence from the type of matrix.

Sinapinic acid was used as the matrix and under these conditions, dextran, a linear polymer, produced only [M + H]+ ions (Bashir et al., 2003a). Inclusion complexes with cyclodextrins have recently been used to investigate the composition of humic acids from Antarctica. The structure of humic acids is still largely unknown even though they are widely distributed in nature. Gajdo\u0161ov\u00e1 et al. (2003) recorded the MALDI spectra of humic acids with and without \u03b3\u2010cyclodextrin and found that several constituents appeared to form inclusion complexes. Thus, for example, a shift in the cyclodextrin peak by 66.0 mass units after addition of humic acid from a standard soil sample was interpreted as consistent with inclusion of a cyclopentadiene radical (C5H 6+). Results from the soils from Antarctica were similar. MALDI spectra were recorded without a matrix to simplify the spectra. An investigation of the mechanism of the well\u2010known migration of alkyl\u2010silyl groups from the two\u2010 to the three position in cyclodextrins has shown that the receiving oxygen is that from the same ring as the migrating silyl group and not to the adjacent ring (Teranishi & Ueno, 2003).",

Thus, epoetins (erythropoietins), with several glycosylation sites occupied by sialylated complex glycans, produced only broad peaks with masses in the range of 30\u201335 kDa and half\u2010height peak widths of up to 5 kDa when examined by MALDI\u2010TOF (Stanley & Poljak, 2003). Deglycosylation, however, produced sharp peaks from the protein with only minimal tailing. Human follistatin expressed in CHO cells has two N\u2010linked glycosylation sites at Asn\u201095 and 259. Its MALDI spectrum contained three peaks; the first at m/z 31,525 corresponded to the unglycosylated protein and the other two at m/z 33,804 and 35,600 were produced by unresolved glycopeptides. LC/MS analysis identified nine complex glycans (Hyuga et al., 2004). Several partially resolved peaks from 52 to 55.5 kDa suggest glycosylation of human \u03b2\u2010secretase catalytic domain, confirmed as N\u2010linked by digestion with PNGase F (Wang et al., 2004b). Reduction in mass of 1.4 kDa of a humanized anti\u2010HBs Fab fragment by treatment with Endo\u2010H gave a mass that was still 3.7 kDa above that of the protein. The authors speculated that the extra mass might indicate O\u2010linked glycosylation but no proof was provided (Ning et al., 2003a). Similarly, a reduction in the mass of approximately 4.5 kDa of a lysosomal serine carboxypeptidase from Trypanosoma cruzi following Endo\u2010H treatment suggested the presence of two to three N\u2010linked glycans (Parussini et al., 2003).

Detection of glycopeptides by HPLC following proteolysis is often difficult because of effects such as signal suppression. Monitoring of oxonium ions (163 for hexose, 204 for GlcNAc, etc.) is a standard method for tracking the glycopeptides and has been extended to monitoring with an ion trap mass spectrometer by generating them in the ion\u2010source region (Sullivan, Addona, & Carr, 2004). Peptide masses were confirmed by MALDI\u2010TOF MS after desalting with C18 ZipTips. A method for predicting peptide retention times in reversed\u2010phase HPLC has been published (Krokhin et al., 2004b) following examination of 346 tryptic peptides and deglycosylated glycopeptides identified by MALDI\u2010TOF MS from 17 proteins. Glycopeptides eluted slightly earlier than their deglycosylated versions. Liu, Feasley, and Regnier (2004) have evaluated the technique of diagonal chromatography which involves comparisons of HPLC chromatograms run under identical conditions before and after enzymatic removal of the glycans and have concluded that, although the technique worked well for detection of protein phosphorylation, retention times of the glycopeptides and derived peptides, identified by MALDI\u2010TOF MS, were too similar for diagonal chromatography to be a reliable technique for detecting glycopeptides. MALDI\u2010TOF MS has the advantage over ESI\u2010MS for the detection of glycopeptides in that the spectra usually only contain singly charged ions unlike ESI with its tendency to produce multiply charged ions. Glycopeptides are often revealed in MALDI profiles by their relatively high mass and by peak spacing corresponding to monosaccharide residues (e.g., 162 for hexose) (Krokhin et al., 2004a).",

The isolated glycopeptides could then be examined by LC or linear MALDI\u2010TOF. MS/MS in an ion\u2010trap\u2010TOF instrument provided peptide fragments for protein identification and carbohydrate ladders that gave information on the glycan composition. The method was applied to transferrin, IgG and \u03b22\u2010glycoprotein 1.

Cis\u2010diol groups in the carbohydrate were oxidized with periodate to aldehydes allowing the carbohydrate to be captured by hydrazide chemistry.

The technique has been used, for example, to show glycosylation in 10 of the 11 consensus sequence sites of the SU component of avian sarcoma/leukosis virus envelope glycoprotein (Kvaratskhelia et al., 2004) and to identify occupied glycosylation sites in membrane\u2010bound glycoproteins. Normally this latter task is difficult because 2D sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS\u2013PAGE) gels are ineffective in separating these compounds. To overcome the problem, the proteins were solubilized in guanidine\u2013HCl, digested with trypsin and the glycopeptides were recovered by lectin binding. Following removal of the N\u2010glycans with PNGase F, the peptides with the Asn to Asp conversion were detected by MALDI\u2010Q\u2010TOF MS (Fan et al., 2004). Investigations of the spike glycoprotein from the SARS virus have revealed four occupied and one unoccupied N\u2010linked sites by molecular weight measurements made before and after glycan removal by PNGase F and by observing the Asn to Asp conversion (Ying et al., 2004). In a similar experiment, digestion of the glycoprotein N\u2010CAM with AspN and trypsin resulted in the identification of glycopeptides, each containing a single glycosylation site. They were separated by HPLC and analyzed by MALDI\u2010TOF MS. Five of the six sites were identified but glycopeptides from site Asn\u20104 were missing.

Incorporation of 18O into the aspartic acid from H 218O can be used to label the newly produced aspartic acid and was used by Barinka et al.

Glycans from ribonuclease extracted from pancreatic adenocarcinoma tumor cells, on the other hand, contain fucosylated hybrid structures and biantennary glycans whose antennae terminated in GalNAc, thus providing a potential diagnostic test for the adenocarcinoma (Peracaula et al., 2003a). MALDI\u2010TOF analysis gave much better resolution of the large glycans than could be obtained by HPLC. Altered glycosylation has also been found associated with prostate cancer; glycans from prostate\u2010specific antigen (PSA) contained increased amounts of fucose and GalNAc in the antennae, again indicating a possible diagnostic test (Peracaula et al., 2003b). Another study found increased amounts of \u03b1\u2010(2 \u2192 3)\u2010linked sialic acid in human poly\u2010sialic acid (PSA) suggesting that differential binding to Maackia amurensis agglutinin lectin could be used to differentiate prostate cancer from benign prostate hypertrophy (Ohyama et al., 2004). Masses of some sialylated glycans were reported from linear MALDI\u2010TOF spectra but most measurements were made on neutral glycans following linkage\u2010specific removal of sialic acid. Increased fucosylation has also been found in N\u2010linked glycans from human hepatoma (Higai et al., 2003b) and melanoma (Ciolczyk\u2010Wierzbicka et al., 2004) cell lines and a reduction in the concentration of fucosylated glycoproteins has been found in dogs undergoing treatment for lymphosarcoma (Xiong, Andrews, & Regnier, 2003a). An extensive study of the N\u2010 and O\u2010glycosylation of the human ovarian tumor marker CA125 has been reported. The bi\u2010, tri\u2010, and tetra\u2010antennary glycans were identified by MALDI\u2010TOF, MS/MS and FAB mass spectrometry as permethylated derivatives coupled with exoglycosidase digestion (Wong et al., 2003). Highly processed glycans have also been found on the breast tumor marker protein, gross cystic disease fluid protein\u201015, than on the same protein from healthy controls (Caputo et al., 2003). Glycans were again examined as permethylated derivatives but, this time, by surface\u2010enhanced laser desorption/ionization (SELDI) mass spectrometry. MUC1 glycoprotein is overexpressed in breast cancer and O\u2010Glycans have been shown to control proteolysis by preventing proteolysis of the Thr3\u2010Ser4 bond if either amino acid is glycosylated (Hanisch et al., 2003). Tetrasialylated\u2010tetra\u2010antennary glycans carrying a \u03b21 \u2192 6 antenna appear to be associated with the development of cancer metastases as demonstrated by studies on integrins from metastatic and non\u2010metastatic human melanoma cell lines (Pochec et al., 2003). MALDI\u2010TOF profiles were obtained following in\u2010gel glycan release using the method described by K\u00fcster et al. (1997) as modified by Hoja\u2010Lukowicz et al. (2000). Bi\u2010 and tri\u2010antennary glycans have been identified attached to human chorionic gonadotropin produced in a choriocarcinoma cell line (JEG\u20103); the biantennary glycans, which were useful markers, were unusual in having a branched 3\u2010antenna (35) rather than carrying both unbranched 3\u2010 and 6\u2010antenna (Takamatsu et al., 2004). The structure was confirmed by MALDI\u2010TOF analysis of exoglycosidase digestion products with an \u03b1\u2010mannosidase digestion following \u03b2\u2010galactosidase digestion to confirm the presence of the exposed mannose residue on the 6\u2010antenna. The study illustrates the danger of assigning structures directly by matching masses with those from a database or by using only the usual exoglycosidase sequence of \u03b2\u2010galactosidase followed by N\u2010acetylhexosaminidase which would incorrectly have suggested a normal biantennary structure such as 23.\nchemical structure image\n",

In a newly characterized disorder, CDG\u20101i, MALDI\u2010TOF and HPLC were used to show that some of the N\u2010glycans on fibroblasts consisted only of Man1GlcNAc2 and Man2GlcNAc2 (Thiel et al., 2003). Analysis by MALDI\u2010TOF and HPLC of serum glycoproteins from several patients with CDG type II syndromes (defective glycan processing) has been used to identify several enzyme defects. One patient was characterized with a mannosidase\u2010III deficiency that prevented biosynthesis of complex glycans as the result of failure to remove residual mannose residues from the 6\u2010antenna.

Residual glycans were monitored in this study by MALDI\u2010TOF MS (Roces et al., 2004). A GlcNAc\u2010transferase\u2010II deficiency in another patient in the study by Butler et al. prevented elaboration of the 6\u2010antenna and resulted in the same biantennary glycans with a branched 3\u2010antenna (35) as observed in the choriocarcinoma cell line (JEG\u20103) discussed above.

The same technique has been used to show that methylglyoxyl, produced during the Maillard reaction binds to Arg\u2010184 and Arg\u2010185 located within the binding site of bovine glutathione peroxidase and to deactivate the enzyme, resulting in an increase in the intracellular peroxidases responsible for oxidative cellular damage (Park et al., 2003b). AGEs from ribose were formed more rapidly when incubated with bovine serum albumin (BSA) than those from glucose or fructose as measured by binding to AGE receptors (Valencia et al., 2004). The use of in\u2010house\u2010developed PERL script software has been used to identify and localize AGEs on \u03b22\u2010microglobulin (Cocklin et al., 2003; Zhang et al., 2003d). The program identifies masses, measured by MALDI\u2010TOF MS that correspond to those of peptides with an AGE modification. In other studies, the AGEs N\n\u03b5\u2010(carboxymethyl)\u2010lysine, imidazolone A (42) and B (43), pyrraline (44) and 1\u2010alkyl\u20102\u2010formyl\u20103,4\u2010glycosyl pyrrole (45) have been found on the type 2 ryanodine receptor calcium\u2010release channel, accounting for decreased cardiac contractility in diabetes (Bidasee et al., 2003). The soluble AGE receptor (sRAGE), a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily, has been characterized from mouse and its N\u2010glycosylation identified by MALDI\u2010TOF MS (Hanford et al., 2004). In another study, measurements of protein molecular weights have added support to the conclusion that Amadori decomposition pathways are constrained in the presence of metal ion chelators and radical traps (Culbertson et al., 2003).\nchemical structure image\nchemical structure image\nchemical structure image\nchemical structure image\nchemical structure image\n",

The enzyme was, thus, classified as an N\u2010acetylmuramoyl\u2010l\u2010alanine amidase (Mellroth, Karlsson, & Steiner, 2003). HPLC and MALDI\u2010PSD were used by Antignac et al.

Thus, for example, the backbone structures of the LOS from V. parahaemolyticus strains have been obtained following O\u2010 and N\u2010deacylation with hydrazine and dephosphorylation with TFA (Hashii et al., 2003a,b). Laser\u2010induced decomposition can be a problem or, in some cases, can yield useful structural information. Thus, the negative ion MALDI\u2010TOF spectrum from DHB of the short\u2010chain LOS from a strain of V. parahaemolyticus (3 kDa) following deacylation showed successive losses of phosphoethanolamine (49), hexuronic acid and phosphate (Hashii et al., 2003b). LOS from M. catarrhalis has been deacylated with hydrazine and examined in negative linear mode from DHB/hydroxy\u2010iso\u2010quinoline (HIQ). The spectrum showed several peaks produced by in\u2010source cleavage at the labile Kdo\u2010lipid A glycosidic bond (Luke et al., 2003). The lipid A molecule itself, examined in reflectron mode, was found to contain seven acyl groups and varying amounts of ethanolamine esterified to the two phosphate groups.

The molecule consisted of a \u03b2\u2010(1 \u2192 6)\u2010linked 2,3\u2010diamino\u20102,3\u2010dideoxy\u2010d\u2010glucopyranose disaccharide carrying six hydroxylated fatty acids. \u03b1\u2010d\u2010mannopyranose residues occupied the two positions normally occupied by phosphates. A similar 2,3\u2010diamino\u20102,3\u2010dideoxy\u2010d\u2010glucopyranose disaccharide carrying six hydroxylated fatty acids was found in the lipid A from Leptospira interrogans which causes a hemorrhagic fever known as Weil's disease. The molecule carried only one phosphate group which was mono\u2010methylated. The two hydroxy\u2010acyl groups attached to the diamino\u2010glucose residue I were esterified with unsaturated \u03c9\u20106\u201012:1 and 14:1 fatty acids (Que\u2010Gewirth et al., 2004). 2,3\u2010Diamino\u20102,3\u2010dideoxy\u2010d\u2010glucopyranose has also been found in lipid A from Bartonella henselae, a Gram\u2010negative bacterium that causes cat\u2010scratch disease (Z\u00e4hringer et al., 2004) and in that from Mesorhizobium huakuii. In the latter compound, the phosphate group normally attached to the di\u2010NH2\u2010Glc moiety II was replaced by d\u2010glucuronic acid (Choma & Sowinski, 2004). A 4\u2010amino\u20104\u2010deoxy\u2010l\u2010arabinopyranose\u20101\u2010phosphate has been found at the reducing end of the lipid A from Burkholderia caryophylli (Molinaro et al., 2003).

The proximal (reducing end) GlcN residue of lipid A from Rhizobium leguminosarum lacks a phosphate group and can be oxidized to 2\u2010amino\u20102\u2010deoxy gluconate by an enzyme recently identified in the outer membrane of the bacterium (Que\u2010Gewirth et al., 2003). The first example of lipid A from an Agrobacterium species (A. tumefaciens strain C58, a plant pathogen) has revealed the presence of a normal bis\u2010phosphorylated glucosamine disaccharide backbone with several acyl variants. The main species was a penta\u2010acyl derivative bearing two 3\u2010OH\u201014:0 fatty acids in ester linkage and two 3\u2010OH\u201016:0 acids in amide linkage. The 3\u2010OH\u201016:0 acid on GlcN II was esterified with 27\u2010OH\u201028:0 that, in turn was esterified with a 3\u2010OH\u2010butyroyl residue (Silipo et al., 2004a).

MALDI\u2010TOF spectra of the glycolipids showed a range of produces with masses of around 1.5 kDa resulting from acyl heterogeneity. A new mannitol teichoic acid has been reported from the cell wall of the bacterium Brevibacterium sp. VKM Ac\u20102118 isolated from a frozen late Pliocene layer (1.8\u20133 Myr) of Kolyma lowland, Russia. The structure consisted of 1,6\u2010poly(mannitol phosphate) with the majority of mannose residues carrying additional phosphate groups. Positive ion MALDI spectra from DHB gave peaks to 6 kDa (Potekhina et al., 2003). The structures of hexamannosides from mycobacterial species have been elucidated and found to contain up to four long\u2010chain acyl groups (Gilleron, Quesniaux, & Puzo, 2003). A typical structure is 53. Studies with M. smegmatis have shown that mannose metabolism, as revealed by studies on phosphoinositol mannosdes, is required for growth (Patterson et al., 2003). Mycoglycolipids have been isolated from the edible fungus Hypsizygus marmoreu and identified by GC/MS and MALDI\u2010TOF MS (Itonori, Aoki, & Sugita, 2004a).

Glycosides identified by MALDI during the review period are listed in Table 8. Glucosylated heteropolyflavans (e.g., 54) from Sorghum bicolor have been examined by Krueger, Vestling, and Reed (2003); polymers with from three to seven flavan units and up to seven glucose residues were found. To overcome problems with estimation of the number of hydroxyl groups present due to the coincidence in mass with the [M + K]+ ion, samples were analyzed as cesium adducts by addition of cesium trifluoroacetate to the sample/matrix solution. Silver trifluoroacetate was also investigated but problems were encountered with cluster formation and the two mass unit difference between the silver isotopes. Over 28 triterpene saponins, 8 of them new, have been identified in a fraction, named QH\u2010B from the South American tree Quillaja saponaria. The 28 saponins formed 14 equilibrium pairs by the migration of an O\u2010acyl group between two adjacent positions on a fucosyl group (Nyberg, Baumann, & Kenne, 2003). The triterpene glycoside from the sea cucumber Stichopus mollis (Stichopodidae) was found by Moraes et al. (2004) to differ in structure from the corresponding glycosides from all other known stichopodids in possessing a sulfate group in the carbohydrate chain, prompting the authors to propose a reclassification to a new genus, Australostichopus Levin. Both MALDI and ESI in negative ion mode have been demonstrated to be capable of detecting carminic acid (55), the red dye isolated from cochineal, in paintings applied to canvas. Binding agents such as linseed oil did not interfere with the detection (Maier, Parera, & Seldes, 2004).

The dendrimer with 32 sugar units produced a spectrum (m/z 19,132) but the next generation glycodendrimer (64 sugar units, predicted mass for C1518H2656O892N250 = 38,661) failed to give a signal. Synthesis of large, fifth generation glycodendrimers with potentially 64 outer sugar residues (69) and sulfated analogues has been monitored by MALDI\u2010TOF MS from THAP (positive ion) and IAA (negative ion) to reveal that approximately 50 of the potential 64 sugars were actually incorporated (Kensinger et al., 2004). Sharp MALDI\u2010TOF peaks from spherical oligosaccharide\u2010\u03b2\u2010alanine\u2010poly(lysine) dendrimers containing 32 cellobiose (13,418 Da), maltose (13,472 Da), and lactose (13,507 Da) groups respectively, synthesized by Baigude et al. (2003), showed complete substitution of the amino groups by carbohydrate. Differences were found between the measured and calculated masses of larger maltose\u2010containing glycodendrimers (13 kDa) based of a poly(ornithine) scaffold with the higher experimental masses being attributed to instrumental factors. The MALDI\u2010TOF spectrum from CHCA of a third generation maltose\u2010proline\u2010poly(lysine) dendrimer (4.4 kDa) synthesized by Baigude et al. (2004b) gave three peaks attributed to the [M + H]+, [M + Na]+, and [M + K]+ ions. Attempted addition of a succinyl group to each maltose residue produced a MALDI spectrum with multiple peaks attributed to different numbers of attached succinyl groups and giving an average number of 13 attached groups. Finally a 24\u2010mer peptide was attached to produce a potential AIDS vaccine; MALDI\u2010TOF analysis indicated the addition of one and two such units. Self\u2010assembling dendrimers carrying four or eight GalNAc residues have been constructed on a bipyridyl core; addition of Cu(II)SO4 linked two bipyridyl units to give the dendrimer. It was characterized by MALDI\u2010TOF MS from DHB and THAP as the intact Cu(II)\u2010linked molecule (70) (Roy & Kim, 2003).\nchemical structure image\nchemical structure image\n",

Conjugation of the glycans is frequently by squaric acid chemistry or by reductive amination. However, Lewis b hexasaccharide has been linked to human serum albumin (HSA) with a disuccinimidyl suberate spacer. The authors found that this spacer had a similar linking efficiency to squaric acid but had the advantage of a fast incorporation of the receptor saccharide to the carrier protein (Lahmann et al., 2004). Saksena, Ma, and Kov\u00e1c (2003) have used SELDI to monitor the conjugation to BSA of di\u2010 through penta\u2010saccharides that mimic the upstream terminus of the O\u2010specific polysaccharide of Vibrio cholerae O:1, serotype Ogawa using squaric diester chemistry. SELDI monitoring of the reaction allowed the extent of conjugation to be monitored and stopped when the desired molar hapten\u2010BSA ratio had been reached. The accuracy of the mass measurement could be increased by using the carrier protein as the internal standard. Tri\u2010 and hexa\u2010galacturonates have been synthesized and coupled to BSA by reductive amination; MALDI analysis gave a molecular weight of 70.996 corresponding to 3.8 mol of ligand/mol of BSA (Clausen & Madsen, 2004). To develop antibodies to Saikosaponin A, a triterpenoid saponin from the root of Bupleuri radix, a plant used in Eastern medicine, Zhu et al. (2004b) have conjugated the saponins to BSA and determined the hapten number as 11 by MALDI from sinapinic acid. Concanavalin A has been labeled with a fluorescent probe at the active site by first binding a photolabile linker attached to mannose to the active site. The probe was then fixed to the protein by photoaffinity labeling, the mannose was removed by reduction of the disulfide link and the resulting thiol group used to attach various fluorescent reagents (Nagase et al., 2003). MALDI from sinapinic acid was used to monitor various stages of the reaction and to demonstrate that the final addition of the fluorescent group occurred to the extent of 70\u201390%. Nyame et al. (2003) have synthesized di\u2010 and trisaccharides bearing the LDN and LDNF epitopes and conjugated these, together with one carrying the Lewisx epitope, to BSA. MALDI\u2010TOF analysis showed that three to four molecules were coupled per mole of BSA. These and additional examples are listed in Table 11.\nchemical structure image\n",

MALDI analysis of several of the reaction intermediates showed acylated cyclosophoraoses in the mass range 3,000\u20134,500.

Thus, Microsin E492 (MccE492), an 84\u2010amino acid antimicrobial peptide from Klebsiella pneumoniae has been purified in a post\u2010translationally modified form from E. coli VCS257 harboring the pJAM229 plasmid or K. pneumoniae RCY492. The 831 Da modification was characterized by MS and NMR and found to consist of a trimer of N\u2010(2,3\u2010dihydroxybenzoyl)\u2010l\u2010serine linked via a C\u2010glycosidic bond to \u03b2\u2010d\u2010glucose that was O\u2010linked to the MccE492 (Thomas et al., 2004b). It has been proposed that tunicamycin, an inhibitor of d\u2010HexNAc\u20101\u2010P\u2010translocases, exerts its action by coordinating the divalent metal cofactor at the active site. MALDI spectra of tunicamycin in the presence of several divalent metals contained ions with compositions of [Tun + Metal2]+ showing that one of the metal atoms was present as a metal chelate (Xu et al., 2004). The C\u2010terminus loop 13 of the Na+ glucose co\u2010transporter (SGLT1) has been shown to contain a binding site for inhibitory alkyl glucosides following photoaffinity labeling and MALDI\u2010TOF analysis (Raja, Kipp, & Kinne, 2004). Three hydroxyproline\u2010rich peptides of 15, 18, and 20 amino acids, containing several pentose residues have been identified as defense signaling peptides released at wound sites in tomato plants (Pearce & Ryan, 2003).",

            "text": "From the above, it can be seen that MALDI and particularly MALDI\u2010TOF is still a major analytical method for carbohydrate analysis. Even though electrospray ionization, particularly when coupled with CID, is being increasingly used, MALDI\u2010TOF usually provides a superior profile of constituent sugars because of the tendency of the technique to produce only singly charged ions. However, MALDI\u2010TOF MS of native acidic glycans is less satisfactory because of problems with prompt fragmentation. Electrospray causes less fragmentation of these compounds but tends to produce ions in different charge states from glycans with several acidic groups, thus giving a profile that is not representative of the glycan content. However, this problem, and the instability of acidic carbohydrates under MALDI conditions, can be overcome by derivatization of the carboxylic acid group of sialic acids but sulfates must be protected by other techniques such as ion pairing. Thus, both MALDI and electrospray have advantages and disadvantages for carbohydrate work and the best technique to use will be dictated by the problem to be solved. The work during the review period has shown that although MALDI is now relatively \u201cmature,\u201d it is expected that future editions of this review series will be able to report many improved methods for performing these analyses.",
