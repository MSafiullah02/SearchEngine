To date, the only known and used drug to treat CCHF is ribavirin [9] and there is no effective vaccine available against CCHFV [9] . Viral envelope proteins are the first-choice for vaccine design. However, they are more prone to mutation to evade the host immune system [11] . The nucleocapsid (N) proteins are normally comparatively abundant and conserved in viruses, therefore N proteins have been widely tested as protective immunogens. The N protein of the feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV) was found to induce protective immunity in cats [30] ; the N protein of Influenza virus, Ebola virus and avian coronavirus can elicit a strong cellular immune response [12, 19, 33] . These results indicate the nucleocapsid protein is a promising candidate for vaccine development [17, 29] . The N protein of CCHFV is highly immunogenic [25, 31] . In this paper, the N protein of CCHFV was expressed by the baculovirus expression system, which is a candidate for protein overexpression and is extensively used for vaccine development. By Western blot and IEM analysis, it was shown that CCHFV N protein can automatically assemble into Virus-Like Particles (VLPs) when over expressed in insect cells.",

The N proteins bind with viral RNAs and interact with RdRp (RNA dependent RNA polymerase, also called L protein) to form RNP complexes [1, 10] , then the RNPs are packaged with bilayer lipid membrane embedded with glycoproteins [24] . Our results indicated that N proteins may self-assemble into nucleocapsids in natural CCHFV infection. However, the specific mechanism of CCHFV assembly remains to be investigated. Many viral nucleocapsid proteins or envelope glycoproteins can spontaneously self-assemble into VLP. VLP has been developed as an ideal vaccine candidate, because it mimics the overall structures of a virus particle without containing infectious genetic materials, thus is safe and highly immunogenic.",

Vlak, Wageningen University) by XhoI and HindIII, blunted by Klenow Fragment (Takara) and inserted into the Bst1107I site of the transfer vector pFast-Bac TM Dual (Invitrogen), to give pFastBacDual-egfp. Then, the CCHFV S gene was digested from pGEM-T Easy vector by EcoRI and subcloned into pFast-BacDual-egfp, generating donor plasmid pFastBacDualegfp-cchfvs. The donor plasmid pFastBacDual-egfpcchfvs was introduced into AcBacmid via Tn7-mediated transposition (Bac-to-Bac, Invitrogen), resulting in recombinant bacmid Ac-egfp-cchfvs (Fig.1).

RESULTS Generation of recombinant AcMNPV containing CCHFV s gene. The recombinant bacmid Ac-egfp-cchfvs were generated as described in Materials and Methods and its genomic structure is shown in Fig. 1A. Positive clones were confirmed by PCR amplifications and sequencing (data not shown). Sf9 cells were transfected with the recombinant bacmid DNA. At 72 h p.t., green fluorescence was found in some cells (Fig. 2A), suggesting the successful transfection of recombinant bacmid DNA into the Sf9 cells.
