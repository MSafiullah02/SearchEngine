Moreover, the clinical significanc of CoV-HKU1 was confi med by the presence of a specifi antibody response in all 6 patients from whom serum samples were available.

SARS-CoV pneumonia is often described as a biphasic disease, with the firs phase due to cell lysis as a result of viral replication and the second phase due to immunopathological damage [4, 12] . On the other hand, all 10 patients with CoV-HKU1-associated pneumonia showed the pattern of a monophasic disease. Although dyspnea was present in one-half of the patients with CoV-HKU1-associated pneumonia at presentation, compared with only \u223c20% of patients with SARS-CoV pneumonia at presentation [4] , patients with CoV-HKU1-associated pneumonia often recovered quickly, but patients with SARS-CoV pneumonia deteriorated after 7-10 days [4, 12] . For the 8 patients who recovered, the median duration of hospitalization was only 5.5 days. This rapid recovery of patients with CoV-HKU1-associated pneumonia could be related to the rapid control of the virus by the immune system. This is in line with the results of our previous study, which showed that the index patient with CoV-HKU1-associated pneumonia had his peak viral load at around day 3 after the onset of illness [19] . Moreover, only 1 of the patients had extrapulmonary symptoms, and all available extrapulmonary specimens (stool, urine, and serum) were negative, by RT-PCR, for CoV-HKU1 (authors' unpublished data). On the other hand, for SARS-CoV pneumonia, patients usually had their peak viral loads 7-10 days after onset of illness [12] . Furthermore, the virus can be readily detected in extrapulmonary specimens, in which the viral loads correlated with the manifestations in the corresponding systems [22] .
