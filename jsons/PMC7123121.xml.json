Usually, they depend on natural roosting structures such as caves, crevices, foliage, branches, tree trunks, and hollows among many others. Bats most likely used buildings as roosts when humans started to build primitive huts thousands of years ago. Indeed, some bat species, such as the hairy split-faced bat, Nycteris macrotis, inhabit thatched huts in Africa that are likely similar to the earliest buildings of humans (Poch\u00e9 1975).",

Bats have low reproductive rates that are associated with exceptionally long life spans, a feature most obvious in insectivorous bats from temperate zones (Wilkinson and South 2002; Munshi-South and Wilkinson 2010). Long life spans may predispose bats to inhabit relatively permanent structures, such as in buildings, since some bat species are loyal to their roost over many years and form long-term social relationships with other colony members (Kerth et al. 2011).",

            "text": "Similar to other small mammals, bats exhibit relatively high mass-specific metabolic rates (McNab 2002). Many bats are also heterothermic, reducing their body temperature and consequently metabolic rate, during periods of adverse conditions, such as low resource abundance (insects, fruits, or nectar), low ambient temperature, or high rainfall (Geiser 2004). Most notably, temperate zone bats employ extended torpor when they hibernate in winter. Apart from hibernation, almost all bats use torpor on a daily basis as an energy-saving strategy (Speakman and Thomas 2003; Willis et al. 2006). During daytime torpor, bats may use passive rewarming when ambient temperatures peak during the warmest part of the day (Turbill et al. 2003). The use of radiant heat created by the exposure of building exteriors to sunshine likely saves synanthropic bats significant amounts of energy since they do not depend on endogenous heat production in brown adipose tissue (Geiser and Drury 2003). This could be a selective advantage for bats using sun-exposed buildings instead of dark caves as daytime roosts or hibernacula (Lausen and Barclay 2006; Halsall et al. 2012).",

Unfortunately, synanthropic bats are unwanted by most humans, which generate conflicts (Gareca et al. 2007). Accordingly, synanthropic bats are persecuted virtually worldwide, even if the legal framework may define this action as criminal. Documented cases of humans removing bats from buildings are apparent across the entire geographic range of synanthropic bats (e.g., Merzlikin 2002), but most cases remain unnoticed by law enforcement agencies even where bats are legally protected. Indeed, bats are legally protected in only a few countries. For example, bats are protected in countries of the European Union according to the Habitats Directive (Council Directive 92/43/EEC). Also, migratory bats are specifically protected in countries that have signed the United Nations convention on the \u201cConservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals\u201d (Lyster 1989). In some countries, conservationists have established action plans for threatened bat species, including suggestions for protecting synanthropic bats (Aguirre et al. 2010). However, these recommendations have not yet been converted into some form of legal framework. In African and Asian countries, bats are not protected under specific legislation. In summary, the level of protection of synanthropic bats by national or international legislation is highly variable and clearly deficient.",

Yet, most observations of foraging at buildings are bats hunting insects around illuminated buildings. Artificial lighting is known to attract insects, and consequently, bats may chase insects close to illuminated buildings (Rydell 1991, 1992; Rydell and Racey 1995; Pavey 1999; Rowse et al. 2016).",

According to our literature survey, at least 35 bat species form maternity colonies in buildings. Energetic advantages and reduced predation risk may be benefits for female bats that give birth and raise their young in buildings. Harbusch and Racey (2006) reported that the serotine bat, Eptesicus serotinus, selected old buildings with slate roofing for maternity roosts, largely because such buildings tend to have small holes and fissures allowing easy access. Also, such buildings offered suitable temperatures of about 22 \u00b0C during gestation and lactation periods, a critical parameter for the survival of offspring (Harbusch and Racey 2006). Further, many species that form maternity colonies in buildings show high levels of site fidelity and natal philopatry, with female young returning to the same roosts to reproduce when they mature (Harbusch and Racey 2006). This could initiate a tradition of using buildings instead of natural roosts in local bat populations.",

Usually, swarming occurs after juveniles have fledged and as they start to disperse from their natal roost. In Marburg, Germany, common pipistrelles swarm between mid-August and late September not only at tall buildings, such as historic towers, castles, and churches, but also at large multistory buildings. Interestingly, bat researchers recorded almost exclusively juvenile bats during swarming events (Kanuch et al. 2010; \u0160uba et al. 2010), and therefore, it was argued that swarming was related to roost exploration (Smit-Viergutz and Simon 2000). Yet, a social function of swarming behavior has also been suggested, for example, for (Kanuch et al. 2010; \u0160uba et al. 2010). To the best of our knowledge, swarming of bats at buildings has not been observed in countries outside of Europe.",

For many of these species, natural hibernacula include not only caves, rock crevices, and rock screes, but also tree hollows. Michaelsen et al. (2013) reported that in Norway, hibernating bats prefer anthropogenic structures rather than natural subground hibernacula, but the reason for this preference was unknown. Bats, such as big brown bats, , hibernating in walls of heated buildings expose themselves to ambient temperatures of 2\u20135 \u00b0C which are created by the balance between warm interior temperatures from heated rooms and cold ambient temperatures from the outside (Whitaker and Gummer 1992). In addition, bats hibernating in buildings may also benefit from occasional passive rewarming, when being exposed to mild exterior temperatures. usually forms maternity colonies in tree roosts, yet in Central and northern Europe, they frequently use prefabricated buildings, i.e., multistory buildings consisting of prefabricated concrete walls that are assembled at the construction site. Throughout continental Europe, large numbers of noctule bats hibernate in such buildings in crevices at about 5\u201310 m aboveground, sometimes forming winter aggregations of a few thousand individuals (Zahn et al. 2000; Kozhurina and Gorbunova 2004; Cel\u2019uch and Ka\u0148uch 2005; Cel\u2019uch et al. 2006). Bats in subtropical and tropical zones may also use buildings during adverse conditions and employ torpor, yet their biology is largely unknown and therefore in need of further studies.",

Yet some birds, mammals, and even invertebrates hunt bats on a regular basis (Gillette and Kimbrough 1970; Speakman 1991; Altringham 1996; Nyffeker and Kn\u00f6rnschild 2013). Roosts in buildings could reduce the exposure of bats to predators if predators avoid anthropogenic environments. For example, snakes and giant centipedes hunt neotropical bats at the entrance of caves, and many of these species are less abundant or even absent in an urban environment (Molinari et al. 2005; Esb\u00e9rard and Vrcibradic 2007). In North America, big brown bats, E. , seem to be less exposed to predators when roosting in buildings than in natural roosts (Lausen and Barclay 2006). However, clustered emergence of bats from roosts in buildings may point to antipredatory behavior in synanthropic bats in urban environments (Speakman et al. 1995; Duverg\u00e9 et al. 2008; but see Irwin and Speakman 2003).",

Angolan free-tailed bats, , inhabit maternity roosts under corrugated steel roofs of houses that often exceed 40 \u00b0C during the day (Maloney et al. 1999), enabling them to maintain ideal growth conditions throughout the reproductive period without expending a lot of energy (Vivier and van der Merwe 2007). Their use of hot roosts may even be linked to increased reproductive rates (Bronner et al. 1999). Higher roost temperatures in attics seem to be also favorable for the development of juveniles of European greater mouse-eared bats, . This species forms large clusters of individuals in natural cave roosts, presumably to benefit from huddling and sharing of body heat (Dietz et al. 2009). In buildings, however, greater mouse-eared bats usually form smaller colonies, and these smaller clusters may be energetically feasible only because Myotis myotis may benefit from exogenous instead of endogenous heat when roosting in warm attics (Zahn 1999). The use of different locations depending on reproductive state has been confirmed for other species as well, including Rafinesque\u2019s big-eared bats, (Roby et al. 2011). Similar to attic-roosting Myotis myotis, thermal benefits have also been suggested for . Pregnant big brown bats rarely entered torpor when roosting at favorable ambient conditions in buildings (Lausen and Barclay 2006). The avoidance of torpor may be advantageous for fetal development. For example, big brown bats gave birth earlier when roosting in buildings than when roosting in natural roosts. Furthermore, juveniles from buildings fledged one to two weeks earlier than conspecifics born in natural roosts (Lausen and Barclay 2006). Similarly, building-dwelling bats gave birth earlier than their conspecifics roosting in foliage or trees (Kurta 2010). These temporal differences could translate to important advantages for building-roosting juveniles; for example, they have more time to explore new roosts and foraging sites and to prepare for the onset of hibernation.",

            "text": "\nPresence of social or mating partners If buildings are selected as roost sites by a single bat, conspecifics may follow to benefit from social advantages (Kerth 2008). These secondary social benefits for synanthropic bats are identical to those of conspecific roosting in natural roosts. Briefly, bats that form large colonies in buildings may be less exposed to predators because of the dilution effect. They may as well benefit from information transfer and by cooperation among members of the same social unit. Clustered emergence of bats from a roost may constitute an antipredator behavior (Speakman et al. 1995), yet clustered emergence may be disrupted in large colonies due to bottleneck effects (Speakman et al. 1999). Gillam et al. (2011) found non-random patterns when pit-tagged Eptesicus fuscus emerged from buildings, indicating that these bats may form social bonds that likely influence their foraging. Information transfer might also be involved during swarming at buildings as observed in some temperate zone bats (Kanuch et al. 2010; \u0160uba et al. 2010). Finally, bats may explore buildings in search of mating partners. For example, buildings are known to be used as mating roosts in a number of species, such as greater sac-winged bats, (Bradbury and Emmons 1974; Bradbury and Vehrencamp 1976), greater mouse-eared bats, (Dietz et al. 2009), spear-nosed bat, (Santos et al. 2003), and free-tailed bats, such as and (Vivier and van der Merwe 2001).",

Therefore, it is almost impossible for aerial-hawking insectivorous bats to use these habitats, unless artificial roosting structures are available. Here, buildings may present pivotal resources for bats to survive in an otherwise hostile environment. Farm buildings, villages, and cities may create structurally complex islands used by bat colonies (Coleman and Barclay 2012a), and this could possibly lead to an increase in local species richness.

Some temperate bat species such as greater mouse-eared bats, , and lesser and greater horseshoe bats, and Rhinolophus ferrumequinum, respectively, predominantly form maternity roosts in caves in southern Europe but occupy mostly attics of large buildings (e.g., churches and castles) in more northern regions of their geographic ranges where cave temperatures are too cold to host cave-roosting maternity colonies (Dietz et al. 2009). The notch-eared bat, , also uses buildings as maternity roosts in the northernmost part of their range in Europe (Dekker et al. 2013). Frafjord (2007) observed a small nursery colony of the northern bat, , in the attic of a cabin at the northern extent of the species range. The roost was only occupied when human inhabitants heated the house for their own use, giving support to the idea that bats benefited from the warmer roost temperatures. The use of buildings as a driving force to reach more northern limits of their geographic ranges (in the Northern hemisphere) has been suggested for E. nilssonii and soprano pipistrelles, , in Norway (Michaelsen et al. 2004), Pipistrellus pipistrellus, in Sweden (Ahlen et al. 2004), and Eptesicus fuscus, in North America (McAlpine et al. 2002). Bats may also benefit from favorable thermal conditions in buildings at higher elevations and may thus go beyond their normal elevational range. For example, a maternity colony of the rare eastern small-footed myotis, Myotis leibii, was found roosting in a high-elevation cabin above the previously known elevational limits for this species (O\u2019Keefe and LaVoie 2011).",

Strelkov (2002) made the point that the ability of some European bat species, such as Nyctalus noctula, to hibernate in buildings may have enabled them to overwinter in more northern regions than when using exclusively natural roosts. By doing so, Nyctalus noctula are closer to their breeding ranges when arousing from hibernation in spring, which gives them an advantage in terms of time and energy in relation to conspecifics that migrate to more southern areas. This could lead to the expansion of this species\u2019 geographic range northward.",

Interestingly, many early papers that discuss bats in buildings deal largely with the eradication or control of bats roosting in buildings (e.g., Silver 1935; Daver 1953; Kunz et al. 1977; Barclay 1980). These papers were gradually replaced by descriptive papers about the biology of synanthropic bats and eventually by those focusing on conservation topics. Nonetheless, eradication of bats from buildings is an eminent, yet mostly undocumented, problem, in all regions of the world. Unfortunately, there are no data available on the number of bats killed each year by closing entrances to daytime roosts in buildings, by destroying roosts, or by fumigating or poisoning bats. In many countries, bats are considered pests or vermin. Therefore, eradication of whole colonies is commonly practiced. In some African countries, synanthropic molossids are consumed by humans as a delicacy (Goodman et al. 2008b), and the bats\u2019 distinct odor is regarded favorably from a culinary perspective (Allen et al. 1917), yet synanthropic bats as a form of bushmeat is rather the exception (Mildenstein and Tanshi 2016).",

Chemical pollutants are likely an indirect threat for bats roosting in buildings (Mitchell-Jones et al. 1989; Bayat et al. 2014). Wood used in buildings is usually treated by chemicals such as chlorinated hydrocarbons to prevent rotting caused by fungi or insects. Bats roosting in buildings are in close contact with wooden structures and thus may be exposed to chemical preservatives such as lindane, pentachlorophenol, and pyrethroids (Racey and Swift 1986; Boyd and Myhill 1988; Mitchell-Jones et al. 1989; Shore et al. 1990, 1991; Bennet and Thies 2007). Most often, bats do not die immediately after contact with treated wood but instead suffer sublethal effects that cause, for example, immune suppression (Corrao et al. 1985; Clark and Shore 2001). Sometimes, bats are eradicated from buildings using poisons, and these poisons continue to persist so that bats may be exposed to toxic residues for extended periods after application. Poisoning is usually a gradual process that is exacerbated in temperate bats via the accumulation of toxic compounds in fat tissue and seasonal mobilization of these compounds during migration and hibernation (Mitchell-Jones et al. 1989; Bayat et al. 2014). Since the introduction of alternative bat-friendly chemical treatments of wood in buildings, mortality caused by chlorinated hydrocarbons has decreased markedly (Bayat et al. 2014), yet from a global perspective, the problem of slow poisoning of synanthropic bats in buildings remains an issue.",

(2007) found that bats inhabiting relatively permanent roosts, such as caves and buildings, carry more ectoparasites than bats that roost in temporal structures, such as leaves or tree hollows. Buildings may provide ectoparasites, e.g., streblid flies, bed bugs (Cimex spp.), or reduviid bugs (Triatominae; Reduviidae), an ideal substrate for egg laying and larval development. As female bats may be immunosuppressed during pregnancy, they may suffer from heavy parasite infestation during reproduction (Christe et al. 2000; Pearce and O\u2019Shea 2007). The combined effect of inflammation and immune challenge may then increase oxidative stress and consequently reduce longevity in house-dwelling bats (Schneeberger et al. 2013; Lilley et al. 2014). Endoparasites are poorly studied in synanthropic bats. occurs in Brazilian house-dwelling bats, yet it is unknown whether roost choice and colony dynamics are different from those of conspecifics roosting in natural roosts and whether building roosts may impose a higher risk of contracting these parasites (Shapiro et al. 2013).",

Bats provide essential ecological services (e.g., pest suppression, pollination, seed dispersal) near houses, villages, and cities (Jones et al. 2009; Kunz et al. 2011; Ghanem and Voigt 2012). For example, synanthropic bats, such as molossids, feed on large quantities of insects that are vectors of human diseases, such as dengue, yellow fever, and chikungunya fever (Andrianaivoarivelo et al. 2006; Goodman et al. 2008b). In tropical and subtropical regions, bats are important seed and pollen dispersers. Orchards in house gardens may largely benefit from the cost-free ecosystem services provided by pollinating bats. Insectivorous bats have the ability to reduce insect herbivory in temperate forests (B\u00f6hm et al. 2011), tropical forests (Kalka et al. 2008), and tropical agricultural fields (Williams-Guill\u00e9n et al. 2008; Maas et al. 2013). Thus, the presence of synanthropic bats comes with large, yet mostly unacknowledged, benefits to humans. Lastly, bats are an integral component of our natural heritage, and thus, they have intrinsic value (Soul\u00e9 1985).",

            "text": "\nViruses Bats inhabiting buildings may be reservoir hosts of viruses. For example, North American and Eurasian are both synanthropic species roosting in buildings, and they are known for their relatively high prevalence of rabies (Zorya 2002; O\u2019Shea et al. 2012; Racey et al. 2013). In Dutch populations of Eptesicus serotinus, bats exhibited a 21 % seroprevalence for lyssavirus (Van der Poel et al. 2005), yet is unknown how many of these positive cases were infectious. In another Dutch study, 30 % of sampled bats that bit humans tested positive for European bat lyssaviruses (Takumi et al. 2009). Other synanthropic bat species may carry lyssaviruses, such as the molossid bats or in North and South America, or vespertilionid bats such as Eptesicus furinalis in South America (Clark et al. 1996; Uieda 1998; Passos et al. 1998; de Almeida et al. 2011; Favi et al. 2012) or nycterid bats such as in Zimbabwe (Foggin 1988). In Kenya, SARS-like coronaviruses (CoVs) were identified in a Chaerephon spp. (Tong et al. 2009), and in South Africa, bat-derived CoVs that are closely related to the MERS-CoV were found in (Corman et al. 2014). Frequent roost switching of synanthropic bats may increase the transmission risk of the rabies virus to humans (Ellison et al. 2007), particularly when humans try to evict bats from houses (Streicker et al. 2013). In general, precautionary measures should be taken when handling synanthropic bats: (1) Do not touch or handle bats without gloved hands, and (2) in case of a bat bite, immediately proceed to the appropriate facility for post-exposure prophylactics. A more detailed treatment of bat-related diseases is provided in Chap. 10.1007/978-3-319-25220-9_10 (Schneeberger and Voigt 2016).",

For example, bats may act as a reservoir for Bartonella/Burkholderia bacteria, which can be transmitted to humans via bed bugs (Saenz et al. 2013). Bat ticks, specifically Argas vespertilionis, collected from a human-inhabited building were documented to carry Borrelia, Rickettisa, and Ehrlichia species (Socolovschi et al. 2012). Staphylococcus nepalensis was detected in guano samples from mixed M. and M. blythii summer roosts, and guano in or near buildings may pose a significant threat to human health (Vandzurova et al. 2013). To our knowledge, no direct infection of humans with bat-related bacterial strains has been described. Overall, synanthropic bats have the potential to transmit zoonotic diseases, yet as outlined by M\u00fchldorfer et al. (2011), there is no evidence, at least for temperate zone bats, that they pose a greater health risk to humans than other wildlife species.",

For example, bed bugs (Cimex spp.) could possibly switch between bat roosts and rooms inhabited by humans (Pearce and O\u2019Shea 2007). Bat ticks have been suggested to cause inflammatory responses in humans living in a building with bats in the attic (Labruna et al. 2014). Ticks associated with bats, and known to bite humans, may also be carriers of bacteria or viruses that can cause disease in humans. For example, Carios kelleyi collected from residential and community buildings in Jackson County, Iowa, tested positive for Rickettsia (Loftis et al. 2005). In addition, some endoparasites are threats to human health, yet many depend on an invertebrate host as a vector for transmission to humans. For example, in Brazil, occur in some synanthropic bat species that serve as a reservoir host for leishmaniasis but require sand flies as a vector (Shapiro et al. 2013).",

For example, Nyctalus noctula roosting in buildings preferred roosts that were located at the top floors (Bihari 2004; Cel\u2019uch and Ka\u0148uch 2005). Molossids, e.g., Chaerephon ansorgei, and vespertilionids, e.g., , that inhabit crevices or narrow spaces under roofs are capable of landing and crawling through narrow roost entrances, whereas horseshoe bats, e.g., Rhinolophus clivosus, and slit-faced bats, e.g., , require an opening large enough to fly through since they usually do not crawl (Monadjem et al. 2010). Other species, such as , are generalists with respect to their roost preference, i.e., they do not prefer specific structural attributes of buildings (Jenkins et al. 1998). It is also noteworthy that some species may require several roosts in separate buildings to establish a stable colony, e.g., greater horseshoe bats, (Maltagliati et al. 2013), eastern pipistrelles, Pipistrellus subflavus (Whitaker 1998), and Eptesicus fuscus (Ellison et al. 2007; O\u2019Shea et al. 2012).",

The corresponding authorities may grant concessions if there is no alternative to the exclusion of bats from roosts. Yet, in many countries, it is a legal requisite that appropriate measures are practiced to compensate for the loss of a roost. The permanent closure of roost exits or the destruction of a roost should only be considered during times when bats are not using the roost, e.g., outside the reproduction or hibernation period. Otherwise, bats may be trapped and killed, which is against animal welfare. If roosts are destroyed or closed, bats may switch to alternative roosts (Neilson and Fenton 1994). After eviction of Eptesicus fuscus from buildings, females produced fewer offspring at alternative sites, even though foraging behavior remained constant (Brigham and Fenton 1986). Relocation of bats to nearby habitats usually fails because bats will return to their original roost in most cases. Lastly, the permanent eviction of bats from roosts may increase the frequency of roost switching. In the case of species with a high prevalence of rabies infections, it is predicted that the rabies transmission risk may increase due to more, and possibly undirected, movements of evicted bats around buildings (e.g., , Streicker et al. 2013). Therefore, roost closures might have unforeseen and unwanted side effects for public health.",

For example, Pipistrellus pipistrellus are quite tolerant to artificial light during foraging, but altered their emergence behavior when exposed to different light intensities at their daytime roost (Down et al. 2003). Directing artificial light at roost entrances may have a negative impact on bats roosting in buildings (Boldogh et al. 2007).

Deserted buildings may provide new roosting structures for bats, e.g., for Hipposideros nicobarulae in Myanmar (Douangboupha et al. 2012). Yet in the long run, synanthropic bats may vanish from these sites when buildings deteriorate (Sachanowicz and Wower 2013). Another effect of demographic changes involves movement and thus concentration of people in urban areas. Following this, previously unused buildings, even in industrial areas, or unoccupied space under the roof of buildings are converted into houses or apartments to host the influx of people in cities. This may cause losses of roosting opportunities for synanthropic bats. In China, like in many Asian countries, a vast number of old buildings are demolished during the process of modernization and this reduces the density of roosts significantly for synanthropic bats (Zhang et al. 2009).",

The major goal of this program is to support populations of synanthropic bats by maintaining or even enhancing their roosts and to involve local people in the protection of bats. Several hundred houses have been deemed bat-friendly in the federal states of Hessen, Schleswig-Holstein and Northrine-Westfalia and others in Germany. The award ceremony is usually accompanied by a press campaign to raise awareness about the conservation of bats that use building as their roosts.

Developers were faced with the difficult task of renovating a building complex that was protected by law, while at the same time keeping the roosting requirements of greater horseshoe bats in mind. The majority of space inside the building complex was designated for the exclusive use by bats. The ground floor level of the main buildings was transformed into an education center and some office space for the project coordinator. The fact that several attics and rooms with variable microclimatic conditions were available to the colony likely contributed to the success of the project. This is consistent with observations of roost use by greater horseshoe bats elsewhere. For example, Maltagliati et al. (2013) pointed out that the largest nursery colony of in Italy uses several buildings. The Hohenburg house was carefully modified to include some further beneficial structures for bats. For example, workers built a so-called heat dome inside the attic where warm, upward moving air is trapped in a structure that is used by bats as a roosting site (Fig. 14.6b, c). Furthermore, they created a 1-m2 pool of water (3 cm depth) at which bats may drink. Finally, roost exits were constructed in a way that prevents predators, e.g., stone martens and domestic cats, from entering the building.",

Accordingly, a strategic plan was developed to protect foraging habitats and enhance the quality of landscape elements. Efforts are currently underway to convert forests into so-called Hutewald, which is an extensive forest used by livestock as pasture that resembles a landscape park.

From our point of view, it is equally important to engage in outreach programs and communicate with building owners about the conservation value of synanthropic bats (see also Kingston et al. 2016). With respect to research directions, we identify the following questions that need to be addressed:What sensory cues do bats use to explore buildings as potential night or day roosts?What are the differences in microclimate between natural and building roost sites, particularly in tropical and subtropical regions?Is use of building roosts a learned behavior? Do local populations establish a tradition of inhabiting buildings?Is swarming behavior unique to European bats?Are there differences in the way bats use buildings between areas or continents where buildings have been in place for many centuries compared with areas where humans have only built houses recently.Do tropical and subtropical bats also use buildings for extended periods of torpor, similar to hibernation of temperate zone bats?What is the selective benefit for synanthropic bats inhabiting roosts in buildings compared with conspecifics inhabiting natural roosts? Why do some species commonly hibernate in buildings and others do not (see also Rintoul and Brigham 2014)?Do tropical and subtropical bats exhibit similar expansions of geographic ranges when thermal benefits of using buildings as roosts are not the predominant driving benefit?Is it possible to estimate the monetary value of ecosystem services provided by synanthropic bats?To what extent have the geographic ranges of synanthropic bats changed in response to the coinhabitation of buildings?\n",

We also see a strong incentive to coordinate conservation efforts to protect populations of synanthropic bats. Bats that live in the same buildings as humans could be ambassadors for the conservation of bats if other successful outcomes are replicated and publicized to a general audience.
