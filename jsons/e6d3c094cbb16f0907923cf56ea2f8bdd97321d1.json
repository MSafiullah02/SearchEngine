Bats host many viruses that are significant for human and domestic animal health, but the dynamics of these infections in their natural reservoir hosts remain poorly elucidated. 2. In these, and other, systems, there is evidence that seasonal life-cycle events drive infection dynamics, directly impacting the risk of exposure to spillover hosts. Understanding these dynamics improves our ability to predict zoonotic spillover from the reservoir hosts. 3. To this end, we followed henipavirus antibody levels of >100 individual E. helvum in a closed, captive, breeding population over a 30-month period, using a powerful novel antibody quantitation method. 4. We demonstrate the presence of maternal antibodies in this system and accurately determine their longevity. We also present evidence of population-level persistence of viral infection and demonstrate periods of increased horizontal virus transmission associated with the pregnancy/lactation period. 5. The novel findings of infection persistence and the effect of pregnancy on viral transmission, as well as an accurate quantitation of chiropteran maternal antiviral antibody half-life, provide fundamental baseline data for the continued study of viral infections in these important reservoir hosts.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "There are approximately 1200 bat species in the order Chiroptera, and these collectively act as reservoir hosts for a number of important viral zoonoses (Calisher et al. 2006; Luis et al. 2013) .

The emergence of viral zoonoses from bats often has drastic consequences, such as the >150 human deaths associated with Nipah virus (NiV) emergence in Malaysia in 1999 (Chua et al. 2000) . The trigger for initial emergences and drivers of exceptional increases in spillover frequency, such as the dramatic increase in Hendra virus spillover events in 2011 (Field et al. 2012) , are often unknown and difficult to determine with so few events. However, bat-derived viral zoonoses that do cause recurrent spillover events (such as henipaviruses and Marburg virus) often have a seasonal pattern (Luby et al. 2009; McFarlane, Becker & Field 2011) . It is possible that this is related to seasonal changes in contact rates between reservoir and spillover hosts (e.g. animal stocking densities and caving tourism), but this has not been shown for Hendra or Marburg viruses (McFarlane, Becker & Field 2011; Amman et al. 2012) . In the latter case, seasonal changes in zoonotic Marburg virus infections are suggested to be directly related to altered viral excretion from reservoir hosts (Amman et al. 2012) .

This is likely because, as for many other wildlife classes (Hosseini, Dhondt & Dobson 2004; Altizer et al. 2006) , bat life cycles are highly seasonal, with tightly synchronized breeding, hibernacula formation and migrations that will drive epidemiology by controlling key factors such as contact rates and the introduction of susceptible animals (George et al. 2011; Drexler et al. 2012a ). This is supported by studies which show that the infection and immunological status of individual bats are affected by age, breeding phase and nutritional stress for some viruses (Gloza-Rausch et al. 2008; Plowright et al. 2008; Breed et al. 2011) .

No henipavirus has yet been isolated from Africa, so the preference to work within a fully characterized host-pathogen system could not be fulfilled here. However, despite the complex relationship between bats and paramyxoviruses, some inferences about the virus (or viruses) likely responsible for inducing the production of these antibodies can be made. Fragments of many henipa-like viruses have been detected in this bat species (Drexler et al. 2009 (Drexler et al. , 2012b Baker et al. 2012a ). Among these, however, we believe only one, or potentially a very small number of closely related viruses are responsible for the production of antibodies detected using the Luminex-NiVsG assay. The evidence for this is that antibodies detected by this assay correlate well with HeV and NiV neutralizing activity in this, and other bat species (Plowright et al. 2008; Breed et al. 2010 Breed et al. , 2013 Peel et al. 2012 Peel et al. , 2013 , whereas antibodies against the recently identified Cedar virus (CedPV, the third henipavirus), however, are cross-reactive, but not cross-neutralizing with HeV and NiV (Marsh et al. 2012) . This suggests that the virus under study here should have a closer relationship with HeV and NiV than CedPV does. This criterion is only filled by two of the multitude of henipavirus-like sequence fragments detected in E. helvum (Fig. S4) .

(Epstein et al. 2013) . Correlations in both the serostatus and antibody concentrations of dam-pup pairs indicated that matAbs were present, with pups having slightly higher concentrations than their dams, as in other matAb systems (Lefvert 1998) . That neonatal antibodies were the IgG isotype and universally declined in subsequent samplings provided further evidence of their likely maternal origin. Furthermore, these maternal antibodies appeared to offer protection against infection (surrogated in this study by seroconversion). This was shown by the seroconversion of young bats following the decline of maternal antibodies (between 6 and 12 months of age). Bats born seronegative were more likely to have seroconverted by the end of the study, and seroconversion happened at a younger age compared with bats born seropositive. Collectively, this evidence suggests an uncomplicated system, where antibodies in neonates are maternally derived, are protective against infection until their decay, upon which young are susceptible to infection via horizontal transmission. However, given the conflicting evidence regarding the vertical transmission of henipaviruses (Williamson et al. 1999; Halpin et al. 2000 Halpin et al. , 2011 , and the possibility of neonatal infection with henipaviruses, it is important to consider evidence contrary to the encompassing statement outlined above. Here, two pups had a serostatus that differed from their dams. Being born in different years with repeatable laboratory results, these likely represent true observations. The seronegative pup born to a seropositive dam was not sampled until 3 months of age (equivalent to 1\u00c17 matAb half-lives as estimated here) and later was the earliest pup in the study to seroconvert, so it is possible it was born with a low level of matAb that was not observed due to delayed sampling. In the alternate pair (the seropositive pup born to a seronegative dam), the pup had the lowest antibody concentration at birth of any neonate in the study and, following waning of these antibodies, similarly seroconverted comparatively young for its birth cohort (i.e. seropositive bats born in 2010, Table 2 , Fig. 5 ). Given the low antibody concentration in the neonate and that neonatal antibody levels were typi-cally~35% higher than their dams, it is possible that the dam became seronegative prior to the sampling event. An alternative biological explanation for either of these dampup discrepancies would be allosuckling, which has been reported in bats (Roulin & Heeb 1999) . However, owing to the low antibody concentrations involved and subsequent life events, these discrepancies in dam-pup serostatus most likely arose from observational gaps.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 139, "end": 162, "text": "(Plowright et al. 2008;", "ref_id": "BIBREF50"}, {"start": 163, "end": 181, "text": "Breed et al. 2011;", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 182, "end": 199, "text": "Peel et al. 2012)", "ref_id": "BIBREF48"}, {"start": 236, "end": 257, "text": "(Epstein et al. 2013)", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 468, "end": 482, "text": "(Lefvert 1998)", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}, {"start": 1406, "end": 1430, "text": "(Williamson et al. 1999;", "ref_id": "BIBREF69"}, {"start": 1431, "end": 1449, "text": "Halpin et al. 2000", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 1450, "end": 1470, "text": "Halpin et al. , 2011", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 2765, "end": 2785, "text": "(Roulin & Heeb 1999)", "ref_id": "BIBREF58"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 2404, "end": 2411, "text": "Table 2", "ref_id": "TABREF2"}, {"start": 2414, "end": 2420, "text": "Fig. 5", "ref_id": "FIGREF3"}], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Throughout the course of the study, there was strong evidence of seasonal horizontal transmission among young bats and adult females. Younger, seronegative bats typically seroconverted between 16 and 24 months of age, and these events were clustered in periods corresponding with late pregnancy of adult females (March 2011 and January 2012). These events were coupled in time with increases (both seroconverting and more moderate) in antibody concentrations of adult females. The undulating pattern of seroconversion in adult females with breeding is supported by a similar association of seropositivity with late pregnancy and lactation seen in field studies (Plowright et al. 2008; Breed et al. 2011) . This is probably due to shifts in the immunological response during pregnancy. Typically, late pregnancy is coupled with a depression of cell-mediated immunity (Boue, Nicolas & Montagnon 1971; Weinberg 1984) , and this has been demonstrated for Myotis bats (Christe, Arlettaz & Vogel 2000; Baker, Schountz & Wang 2013) . Thus, the finding that late pregnancy appears to make adult females susceptible to henipavirus infection might suggest an important role for cell-mediated immunity in its control outside of these times. Regardless of mechanism, however, the coupling of adult female seroconversions with those of young bats appears to indicate an increase in horizontal transmission during these periods. This seasonal increase in transmission might represent a period of increased zoonotic risk, as infection peaks in juvenile bats have been associated with increased zoonotic spillover of Marburg virus (Amman et al. 2012) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 661, "end": 684, "text": "(Plowright et al. 2008;", "ref_id": "BIBREF50"}, {"start": 685, "end": 703, "text": "Breed et al. 2011)", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 866, "end": 898, "text": "(Boue, Nicolas & Montagnon 1971;", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 899, "end": 913, "text": "Weinberg 1984)", "ref_id": "BIBREF67"}, {"start": 963, "end": 995, "text": "(Christe, Arlettaz & Vogel 2000;", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 996, "end": 1024, "text": "Baker, Schountz & Wang 2013)", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 1615, "end": 1634, "text": "(Amman et al. 2012)", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Notably, however, these seasonal seroconversions did not affect adult males.

Very few seroconversions of adult males occurred throughout the present study and those that did were not coupled in time with pregnancy/ lactation. Although explanations regarding the timing of so few, events are somewhat speculative, rather than being associated with pregnancy/lactation as in the adult females and young, seroconversions of adult males occurred in the middle of the year (May 2010 and July 2011), closer to the April -June mating period of E. helvum (Mutere 1968 ), when increased aggression among males and more intimate contact with females is likely. Thus, rather than being associated with increased horizontal transmission during the time of pregnancy/lactation, the few adult male transmissions may have been associated with the mating period.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 769, "end": 781, "text": "(Mutere 1968", "ref_id": "BIBREF46"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Here, evidence of active infection in the colony was seen throughout the study period (including in bats born in the facility), but was not first observed until 4 months into the study. The population-level infection persistence in this small population is consistent with the finding that the small, isolated population of E. helvum annobonensis maintains henipavirus infection . The pressing questions then are that of site and mechanism for this population-level persistence. Where, and in whom, is the virus maintained, and what drives periods of active infection and quiescence? Two potential mechanisms for this population-level virus persistence are that immunity after a period of infection declines (i.e. SIRS dynamics) or the existence of persistently infected individuals. In the case of the former, the waning-seroconversion cycle in adult females provides evidence that SIRS dynamics may exist in this system. Furthermore, other studies of henipaviruses in E. helvum show a decrease in adult seroprevalence with age in years (Peel 2012) , which may also lend itself to such dynamics. In the latter case of persistently infected individuals, theoretical models have shown such individuals would greatly contribute to population-level persistence of henipaviruses (Plowright et al. 2011) . Recrudescent henipavirus infection has already been suggested to occur in humans and Pteropus bats (Rogers et al. 1996; Tan et al. 2002; Sohayati et al. 2011) , and another paramyxovirus (Porcine rubulavirus) is known to persist in the male reproductive tract of pigs for over 4 months (Rivera-Benitez et al. 2013) . Also, but speculatively, if vertical infection did occur (although no evidence was found in this study), infected neonates might become immunotolerant to henipaviruses and continue lifelong excretion in a manner similar to Bovine Viral Diarrhoea Virus (Potgieter 1995) . In this case, individuals would be born matAb positive, and, following matAb waning, fail to seroconvert on exposure. Indeed, there were some individuals in this study which had failed to seroconvert by \u22654 years of age. To further address questions regarding potential mechanisms of persistence, however, longitudinal molecular virological studies are required (see below).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1038, "end": 1049, "text": "(Peel 2012)", "ref_id": "BIBREF47"}, {"start": 1275, "end": 1298, "text": "(Plowright et al. 2011)", "ref_id": "BIBREF51"}, {"start": 1400, "end": 1420, "text": "(Rogers et al. 1996;", "ref_id": "BIBREF57"}, {"start": 1421, "end": 1437, "text": "Tan et al. 2002;", "ref_id": "BIBREF62"}, {"start": 1438, "end": 1459, "text": "Sohayati et al. 2011)", "ref_id": "BIBREF61"}, {"start": 1587, "end": 1615, "text": "(Rivera-Benitez et al. 2013)", "ref_id": "BIBREF56"}, {"start": 1870, "end": 1886, "text": "(Potgieter 1995)", "ref_id": "BIBREF53"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Another final consideration for understanding viral persistence in a population is the role of population structure and dispersal events in the maintenance of infection. In the current study, naturally occurring population seroprevalences might have been disrupted by the end of the study period, as evidenced by an increase in juvenile seroprevalence to levels comparable to adults. This increase is probably attributable to bats born in 2011 having higher levels of matAb (Table 2, Fig. S2 ), which were still detectable at 10 months of age. The reasons for the high matAb concentrations in these bats relative to their wild counterparts or pups born in 2010 are unknown, but it is possible that if infection equilibrium previously existed in the wild population, it may be disrupted by the absence of migration, severe reduction in population size and closure to outside infection, as necessitated by the study design.

For example, longitudinal sampling of wild Pteropus roosts in Thailand and Myotis populations in Germany shows seasonal excretion peaks of henipavirus and coronaviruses, respectively, that are associated with pregnancy and lactation (Gloza-Rausch et al. 2008; Wacharapluesadee et al. 2009 ).
