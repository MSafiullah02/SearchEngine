In its current use, a diagnosis of croup encompasses a number of respiratory illnesses characterized by varying degrees of inspiratory stridor, cough, and hoarseness resulting from inflammation and narrowing of the larynx. Viral croup (acute laryngotracheitits) refers to the typical croup syndrome that occurs in children at the peak ages of six months to three years [2]. It is characterized by hoarseness, stridor, and a barky cough that occurs after a viral prodrome of low-grade fever and coryza lasting 12\u201372 h. Symptoms tend to worsen at night, and when the child is agitated or crying.",

This results in erythema and swelling of the lateral walls of the trachea and larynx, leading to epithelial necrosis and laryngeal and subglottic narrowing secondary to inflammation [3,5]. The disease process is self-limited with resolution typically within one week [6,7]. In mild cases, a single dose of oral dexamethasone may be administered. In moderate to severe cases, dexamethasone and nebulized epinephrine are the mainstay of therapy. In cases of failure of medical treatment, progression to exhaustion from increased work of breathing, hypercapnic or hypoxic respiratory failure, or imminent airway obstruction, treatment with endotracheal intubation is warranted. The incidence of intubation is approximately 3% for all patients admitted for croup [[8], [9], [10]].",

Patients with uncharacteristic presentations or abnormal natural history are commonly diagnosed with atypical croup. The use of this term leads to several difficulties in the management of these patients in the acute care setting. Given there is no definitive diagnostic or management pathway for atypical croup, patients are often subject to radiographic studies and operative assessments that require a general anesthetic. The primary objective of this case report and systematic review is to evaluate the published definitions of atypical croup. The secondary objectives are to summarize its diagnosis, etiologies, and management, and identify the patient characteristics that may result in intubation or tracheostomy and propose a management pathway.",

Despite a 3-day course of amoxicillin and prednisone, his work of breathing and stridor increased, requiring nebulized epinephrine administered at a regional emergency department. He was subsequently transferred to the Alberta Children's Hospital (ACH) pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) due to airway concerns. Although he remained non-toxic and playful, his biphasic stridor only improved briefly with medical therapy. As a result, a lateral neck x-ray and computed tomography (CT) of the neck were performed on day 2 of admission to rule out a subglottic lesion.",

Due to the degree of narrowing, a 3.0 endotracheal tube was placed. A mucosal biopsy performed intraoperatively showed respiratory epithelium with prominent lymphoid aggregates and abundant reticulin fibres in the subepithelial stroma. These lymphocytes were diffusely positive for CD21 and B-cell markers, CD45, and CD3. There was no significant cytological atypia. Tracheal swabs were negative for bacteria, fungus, and EBV.

Following one month of watchful waiting, suspension laryngoscopy and rigid bronchoscopy demonstrated significant improvement in subglottic patency. However, a tracheostomy was maintained due to continued narrowing of his airway. On follow-up bronchoscopy, a suprastomal granuloma was seen and obliterated with a YAG laser. Repeat rigid bronchoscopy performed 3 months later showed resolution of the posterior tracheal wall mass and subglottic stenosis. He was decannulated intraoperatively and admitted to the PICU for overnight observation. He was discharged the following day with no further concerns, 219 days after his initial presentation.

Articles were screened by two authors and the reference lists of chosen articles were searched to further identify relevant articles. Articles with a focus on atypical presentations of croup were included. Reviews, commentaries, and editorials were excluded.

In our review, endoscopy was used to aid diagnosis in all 12 studies. Findings on endoscopy varied based on etiology. Ulcerations were reported in cases of herpetic croup by O'Niel et al. (2013), Inglis Jr (1993), Chauhan et al. (2007), and Krause et al. (1998) [13], [16], [17], [20]. In a retrospective chart review, Hatherill et al. (2001) assessed the presence of ulcerative lesions on microlaryngoscopy in children with croup who were admitted to the PICU [15]. Laryngeal ulcerations were identified in 10% of children admitted while 18% had gingivostomatitis consistent with HSV infection. Furthermore, in a review performed by Cooper et al. (2012) of 80 children diagnosed with atypical croup, 33 had large airway lesions, which included subglottic stenosis, laryngeal clefts, subglottic hemangiomas, tracheomalacia, and laryngomalacia [11]. In addition, the authors reported associations between atypical croup and atopic conditions such as eosinophilic esophagitis. The authors recommended that endoscopy be coupled with allergy and gastrointestinal investigations in children with atypical croup. Barnes et al. (1999) described a case where laryngoscopy revealed two large subglottic cysts in addition to subglottic stenosis [21]. Finally, Waki et al. (1995) noted an association between gastoesophageal reflex disease (GERD) and recurrent croup [12]. Patients with GERD had shorter time periods between episodes of croup and younger age of presentation. Findings associated with GERD, including edema and erythema of the arytenoid and tracheal mucosa, were identified in 47% of children assessed for recurrent croup and 25% showed anatomical airway narrowing with direct laryngoscopy and bronchoscopy.",

In one immunosuppressed child, the fungus Curvularia was isolated [18]. This suggests that immune modulation plays a role in determining croup presentation and severity.

Some studies have proposed more strict definitions of atypical croup, mostly based on recurrent presentations with consideration of age at presentation; however, there remains a gap in knowledge on the incidence of these atypical episodes [11]. This discordance suggests that it may be beneficial to present a broader definition of atypical croup. We therefore propose that atypical croup may be defined as a child who presents with croup that is either: a) severe, necessitating definitive airway management, b) prolonged, symptoms persisting for 7 or more days despite medical therapy, c) untimely, presenting at an age younger than 6 months or older than 6 years, d) associated with an atypical pathogen, or e) presenting with an airway lesion other than the classically described steeple sign on x-ray imaging. Several of these features were present in this case study, in particular symptoms refractory to maximal medical therapy, prolonged duration, a pseudotumour, and airway narrowing persisting for 6 months after initial presentation.",

Atypical findings on endoscopy were reported in several studies. Large airway lesions such as subglottic clefts, laryngeal ulcers and hemangiomas were found in a variety of cases labelled atypical croup. In one study the prevalence of these lesions was as high as 40% in patients with recurrent croup [11]. The question of who needs endoscopic evaluation was only addressed in one evaluated study by Farmer and Wohl (2001) who proposed endoscopy be undertaken if croup is severe, persists despite treatment, in cases of abnormal imaging or prior to elective surgery [1,14].",

We sought to clarify the patient characteristics that place children at risk of intubation or tracheostomy. In one review by O'Niel et al. (2013) of HSV laryngitis, 50% of patients required intubation [17]. The rate of intubation in other forms of atypical croup was not well studied. Furthermore, specific characteristics associated with intubation were not reported. However, Hatherill et al. (2001) described the decision to proceed with tracheostomy based on the prevention of further mucosal damage due to severe ulceration and subglottic narrowing from prolonged intubation [15]. The study noted that 5 children of the 263 reviewed required tracheostomy. In our case the decision to proceed with tracheostomy was based on persistence of airway narrowing following intubation. Overall tracheostomy was only reported in one of the twelve studies reviewed. Thus, other than herpetic croup, there remains a question of the risk factors and patient characteristics that may result in intubation and tracheostomy. Future investigation is warranted to clarify this issue.",
