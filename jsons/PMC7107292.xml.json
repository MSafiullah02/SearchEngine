Fully understanding the ways disease impacts commercial production is imperative to quantify the influence of disease on pig performance and net financial returns. Studies conducted in a research facility have the advantage of being well controlled but the disadvantage of uncertain relevance to practical conditions; conversely, studies carried out on commercial farms enhance relevance but maintaining proper controls can be difficult. The ideal situation would be an intensive, well-managed study carried out in a commercial research facility which requires attention to detail, adherence to accepted standards of scientific endeavor, and a great deal of on-site labor.",

Production costs were obtained from data compiled by Meta Farms (MetaFarms, Burnsville, MN), USDA-AMS, and Iowa State University (Ames, IA) in 2015 (Table 1). The price per feeder pig was calculated by using the composite weighted average price (formula and cash) of an 18 kg feeder pig from the National Direct Delivered Feeder Pig Report NW_LS255. The feeder pig price ($55.51 per pig) was based on an average of weekly prices reported during 2015 (USDA-AMS, 2017a). However, the feeder pigs in this study were lighter at 13 kg. In order to appropriately apply a feeder pig price, a linear relationship was used between price and weight. The feeder pig price used in this model was $41.63 per pig. Feed costs were applied based on the feed budget assigned per feeding phase. Major ingredient prices were calculated from the North Central Iowa corn prices report NW_GR110, Iowa DDGS report NW_GR111, and Iowa SBM report NW_GR116 (USDA-AMS, 2017b, c, d). Other ingredient prices were obtained from Meta Farms. Based on a weighted average of ingredient prices, diet costs across phases were calculated to be $201.67/t. Transportation costs were obtained from the Iowa State University Ag Decision Maker website ($3.90/loaded mile, semi-trailer; Plastina and Johanns, 2015). Assuming a semi-trailer capacity of 500 feeder pigs, and transportation distance of 25 miles, the cost of transportation for feeder pigs used in this model is $0.195 per pig placed. Assuming truck capacity of 130 market pigs and a distance to market of 50 miles, the cost of transportation for market pigs used in this model was $1.50 per market pig. A base price for veterinary costs ($5.00/pig placed) was obtained from Meta Farms and was applied to the LCh barn. The MCh and HCh barns incurred additional veterinary costs of $2.37 and $2.02/pig sold, respectively. These added costs were due to the increased number of pig treatments in these barns and the medications used related to different clinical symptoms. An assumed yardage cost ($0.115/pig space/d) was obtained from Meta Farms. Yardage costs can be a major component of the total costs of pork production, and vary significantly from one producer to the next. Yardage is broadly defined as overhead costs, and incorporates non-feed costs that are not associated with hog ownership. Yardage calculations will vary and costs included differ; nonetheless, the assumed yardage cost used in this model included fuel, operating interest, machinery, labor and building depreciation, taxes, and insurance. The secondary market price of lightweight and cull pigs ($78.74/pig) was obtained from Meta Farms. The primary market hog price was calculated by using the average of the monthly negotiated Iowa/Minnesota Daily Direct Prior Day Hog Report LM_HG 204 (plant delivered) prices for 2015 ($1.48/kg carcass weight; USDA-AMS, 2017e).",

The authors recognize that in most animal science research, the barn would be considered the experimental unit. However, it is not possible to replicate a disease treatment across multiple barns; as demonstrated in this study, health status within a barn can change over time, making replication improbable. However, great care was taken to ensure that any potential differences among the barns other than disease were minimized; as previously explained, the three barns were identical in design and construction, were all managed by the same person, were of the same genetic origin and received the same dietary regime. All three barns were located on the same site to eliminate the chance of differences in weather affecting outcomes. On this basis, it was concluded that the pen within the barn can be considered the experimental unit, although the chance of other factors besides HC affecting performance cannot be completed precluded.

Van Reeth et al. (1996) reported reduced ADG under a PRRSV-IAV-S challenge; however, no other published data exist that describe the impact of a PRRSV and IAV-S co-infection specifically on growth performance in grow-finish pigs. Rochell et al. (2015), Schweer (2015), and Schweer et al. (2016a) reported reduced overall ADG and ADFI when pigs were under a PRRSV challenge. While ADG and ADFI were lower in the present experiment, the modest reduction in G:F was a surprise. In a grow-finish experiment by Schweer (2015), feed efficiency was reduced by 6.8% when pigs experienced a PRRSV infection, which is greater than the 4.8% observed in this experiment.",

Later, Holtkamp et al. (2013) estimated these losses at $664 USD million in grow-finish pigs. In a recent interim report, Holtkamp reported that the economic impact of PRRSV has fallen by $83 million USD to $581 million USD in grow-finish pigs (Miller, 2017). Both economic models in the present study reveal serious losses in the event of a PRRSV and IAV-S co-challenge under commercial conditions; however, the fixed-time model resulted in greater losses when calculated on a per barn-turn basis. Neumann et al. (2005) estimated PRRSV cost U.S. hog producers $7.67 USD/pig, while Holtkamp et al. (2013) reported production losses of $4.67 USD for every pig marketed in the U.S. Unfortunately, these economic analyses by Neumann and Holtkamp only assess the economic contribution of a PRRSV infection. They also represent \u201caverage\u201d losses estimated across the total US pig herd. The results of this experiment suggest that the economic impact of a co-challenge can vary widely.",
