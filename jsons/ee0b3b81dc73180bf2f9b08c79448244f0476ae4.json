To manage SECD, initiating and maintaining herd immunity is typically performed through feedback and potentially vaccination. Controlled exposure through feedback of infectious SECD in the form of faeces, ingesta or homogenized intestines is commonly used to simultaneously stimulate immunity in sows and replacement gilts through programs designed to \"load, close and expose\" the herd. Stimulating gastrointestinal immunity in sows and gilts through controlled exposure increases the beneficial lactogenic immunity through IgA in colostrum or milk consumed by neonatal pigs. Lactogenic immunity is critical for protecting piglets from the high morbidity and mortality of SECD and mitigating the significant losses that can occur within na\u20ac \u0131ve herds (Langel, Paim, Lager, Vlasova, & Saif, 2016) .

Once porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus (PEDV) is introduced into a swine herd, strategies for disease control are utilized to stimulate immunity for management or eliminate the virus for eradication benefits to offspring, feedback is generally considered to have several unknowns and potential risks. Importantly, there is no widely accepted standard feedback protocol shown to have the highest efficacy in controlled experimental conditions. This leads to several factors that vary considerably between herds administering feedback, such as (i) virus concentration and volume of material administered, (ii) physical material administered (i.e., faeces, homogenized intestines, ingesta or a mix), (iii) frequency and timing of administration, and (iv) procedures to ensure material is free of other infectious agents (i.e., multiplex PCR, metagenomic sequencing, bacterial culture and herd history).

Even so, the currently available vaccines are generally considered to provide incomplete protection in na\u20ac \u0131ve animals. Subsequent to feedback administration or natural exposure, killed vaccines may effectively booster immunity and could provide an alternative for repeated virulent SECD exposure through the oral route. In Gillespie, Song, Inskeep, Stone, and Murtaugh (2017) , PEDV-neutralizing antibodies in milk and colostrum were significantly increased (approximately fivefold) in vaccinated sows with pre-existing immunity compared to non-vaccinated sows with preexisting immunity. However, this same response to an inactivated vaccine was not seen in na\u20ac \u0131ve sows (Gillespie et al., 2017) . Overall, use of feedback and vaccines in the field vary considerably in practice and a standardized procedure for stimulating and maintaining uniform SECD immunity throughout the herd is a much-needed resource for the industry. (Huss et al., 2017) . It is unknown whether the detection of RNA in this study indicated the presence of infectious virus. In Bowman, Krogwold et al. (2015) ; Bowman, Nolting et al. (2015) , several disinfectants, including a phenol, quaternary ammonium compound, sodium hypochlorite, oxidizing agent and quaternary ammonium/glutaraldehyde combination, were investigated for their ability to inactivate PEDV in the presence or absence of faeces. Although PEDV RNA was often detected at low levels on PCR after application of the disinfectant, the virus was found to be non-infectious on virus isolation and/or bioassay (Bowman, Nolting et al., 2015) . An emerging area of study is the role of direct-fed microbials and probiotics as potential therapeutics to improve the response of pigs to SECD. For example, Canning et al. (2017) recently reported that feeding the bacterial species Bacillus subtilis to 2-week-old pigs infected with PEDV reduced intestinal pathology as shown by decreased atrophic enteritis scores; however, no differences were detected in diarrhoea or average daily gain when compared to nontreated infected controls (Canning et al., 2017) . Interestingly, the presence of normal flora seemed to enhance disease after challenge with a cell culture-adapted PDCoV in Ma et al. (2015) , as conventional 10-day-old pigs had more severe disease than 10-day-old gnotobiotic pigs post-challenge with the same virus and inoculation dose. However, small numbers of pigs were used for these studies (3-4 piglets/group), and further investigation is needed to delineate the beneficial or detrimental role of normal flora in SECD pathogenesis (Ma et al., 2015) . Overall, the microbiome is a relatively new area of study and additional research to determine the potential application of microbiome therapeutics in the prevention or treatment of SECD would benefit the industry. on up to five unique swine herds, including information on size, production type, location, SECD status and exposure, source of SECD introduction and methods for SECD control.

Interestingly, infection of pigs with PRRSV and PEDV in combination resulted in a greater reduction in ADG than with either singular infection, indicating the importance of co-infections in the pathogenesis of both viruses.Field studies on the impact of PEDV through the evaluation of production records have reported similar effects. Alvarez, Sarradell, Morrison, and Perez", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF3": {"text": "this evidence suggests that PEDV has a greater production impact on growth, additional research is needed to compare the growth impact of PDCoV and PEDV in side-by-side controlled experimental studies.The long-term impact of PEDV and potentially PDCoV on performance may be due to the systemic inflammatory effects on feed intake and utilization, localized effects on enterocyte health and function. Studies evaluating how SECD impacts growth performance long-term through the finishing period to market are lacking; additional research is necessary to determine the lifelong effects of SECD on weight as well as determine the nutrient requirements for pigs with enterocyte compromise post-infection. However, data thus far suggest that PEDV-infected pigs may require an extended period in the grow/finish phase to reach market weight and that reduced weight gain early on post-infection may be a largely unrecognized long-term economic loss due to SECD.6 | TRANSMISSIONFaecal-oral direct or indirect fomite exposure is the primary routes of transmission for SECD, with aerosol transmission also being considered as a possible route for viral spread. Alonso et al. (2014) evaluated the detection and infectivity of PEDV collected from air samples in both experimentally infected as well as naturally infected field premises. Although PEDV was detected in air samples from the experimental setting and at distances of up to 10 miles in the field setting, only the PEDV collected in air samples from experimentally inoculated pigs was shown to be infectious to other pigs through bioassay. The authors attributed this difference to a lower PEDV titre in field samples as well as environmental conditions affecting the infectivity of the airborne virus(Alonso et al., 2014). When compared to porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) and highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAIV), PEDV was detected at the highest concentration in air samples collected from naturally infected herds(Alonso et al., 2017).When studies have included contact controls to assess transmission from cohoused infected pigs, faecal-oral transmission is typically rapid and occurs within 24 hr of contact(Crawford et al., 2015;   Niederwerder et al., 2016;Vitosh-Sillman et al., 2016). Although faecal-oral transmission occurs quickly after experimental inoculation, productive transmission depends on both the oral dose and the age of the pigs. For example,", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF4": {"text": "ulated(Vitosh-Sillman et al., 2016). Rate of air exchange and disinfectant protocols in a BSL-2 versus a BSL-3 facility likely contributed to the differences in these two studies.It would appear that productive aerosol transmission can occur with SECD in experimental conditions. InNiederwerder et al. (2016)    andVitosh-Sillman et al. (2016), extensive examination of the respiratory tract revealed no evidence of infection in respiratory-associated tissues. Thus, the mechanism by which aerosol transmission occurs is likely due to ingestion of aerosolized virus via the faecaloral route. This is in stark contrast to the tissue tropism of transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), where infection of the respiratory tract is a known characteristic of pathogenesis(Furuuchi & Shimizu, 1976;Kemeny, Wiltsey, & Riley, 1975;O'Toole, Brown, Bridges, & Cartwright, 1989).7 | RISK FACTORS FOR IN TR ODUCTIONAlthough several possibilities have been considered for how PEDV and PDCoV were introduced and rapidly disseminated throughout pig farms in the United States and North America (Figure 3), the exact mechanism by which these two viruses entered and spread are not completely understood. Aerosols, neighbouring farms, breaches in biosecurity, contaminated transport vehicles, feed and feed totes have all been implicated as potential contributors (Alonso et al., 2014; Bowman, Krogwold, Price, Davis, & Moeller, 2015; Dee et al., 2014; Lowe et al., 2014; Pasick et al., 2014; Scott et al., 2016). Alvarez, Goede, Morrison, and Perez (2016) investigated the spatial and temporal epidemiology of PEDV outbreaks in both the southeastern and midwestern regions of the United States to understand the role of neighbouring farms in local spread. Farms infected with PEDV had significant spatial clustering, with negative herds located <2 km from an acutely infected farm having a significant risk of subsequent exposure (Alvarez et al., 2016). Lowe et al. (2014) investigated truck trailers for evidence of PEDV contamination after transporting pigs to harvest facilities in June 2013. Samples collected from 575 trailer floorsshowed that 6.6% were positive prior to unloading pigs and another 5.2% became PEDV-positive sometime, while pigs were being unloaded(Lowe et al., 2014). These data suggest that transport vehicles may (i) serve as fomites for SECD spread and (ii) become contaminated with SECD and potentially other pathogens at locations where pigs congregate from multiple sources, such as abattoirs.After PEDV was introduced into the United States, several investigations revealed an epidemiological link to contaminated feed as a vehicle for introduction and transmission. A root cause investigation performed by USDA revealed that flexible intermediate bulk containers or feed totes may have served as fomites in the spread of PEDV.", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF5": {"text": "of other endemic and foreign animal diseases. Consistent with understanding and mitigating this risk, recent research studies funded by the Swine Health Information Center (SHIC) have focused on investigating the survival of viruses important to the US swine industry through imported feed ingredients (Swine Health Information Center, 2016, 2017). Viruses such as Seneca virus A (surrogate for foot and mouth disease virus), bovine herpesvirus-1 (surrogate for pseudorabies virus), feline calicivirus (surrogate for vesicular exanthema virus), and porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) have all been shown to be capable of maintaining infectivity for weeks under simulated shipping conditions from China (Swine Health Information Center, S, 2017).", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF6": {"text": "Numerous strategies can be employed for SECD elimination post-exposure, such as enhanced biosecurity, virus mitigation through a feed additive, piglet depopulation and segregated early weaning (Figure 4). Both PEDV and PDCoV are enveloped viruses and fairly susceptible to a wide range of disinfectants. The Quebec swine health team (EQSP) created a list of over 20 potential disinfectants which may be used to inactivate SECD, including recommended dilution rates, contact times and application rates. For example, Virkon\u00e2 (potassium peroxymonosulfate; DuPont, Wilmington, DE) is recommended at a 1.0% dilution rate for 10 min of contact time, and Synergize TM (quaternary ammonium chloride and glutaraldehyde; Preserve International, Reno, NV) is recommended at a 0.4% dilution rate for 5-12 min of contact time (EQSP, 2015). Additionally, experimental studies have been performed to assess the efficacy of disinfection or cleaning procedures on eliminating the risk of SECD spread through fomites or facilities. In Huss et al. (2017), a quaternary ammonium compound, a 5% sodium hypochlorite solution, and heat (60\u00b0C) were investigated in succession for their ability to disinfect a feed manufacturing facility contaminated with PEDV.

The remaining herds had either never been exposed to SECD (24/83; 28.9%) or had been exposed and had eliminated the virus without a recent reintroduction (47/83; 56.6%).

Taken together, these survey data suggest that most herds have had long-term success in maintaining a negative status or eliminating PEDV after exposure.
