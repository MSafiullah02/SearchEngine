Whilst the substantive issues and problems that are to be addressed during project implementation are generally well analysed and the potential solutions are identified based on sound scientific knowledge and information, less attention is all too frequently paid to the management structure that will ensure coherence and co-ordination of the diverse types and levels of intervention once the programme or project is under implementation.",

Of these three substantive project components, the first, relating to habitat degradation and loss, was the largest and divided into four sub-components. The fourth component of the project dealt with regional co-ordination including facilitation of national level execution and securing inter-country agreement on project related matters. The financial appropriations approved by the GEF Council are presented in Table 1\n, where it can be seen that the allocations from all sources for the priority habitats (mangroves, coral reefs, seagrass and wetlands) total just over 21 million US dollars or 63% of total project costs. The allocation for mangrove related activities was greater than all other components and sub-components.",

The estimated regional co-ordination costs included the costs of convening some 16 regional meetings per year for the first two years and around 10 per year thereafter, together with the costs associated with the activities of the Project Coordinating Unit.

The latter concerns led to a recognition of the need for separate bodies of specialists to guide the implementation of the individual components and subcomponents whilst, at the same time, providing a framework (the Regional Scientific and Technical Committee) within which individual specialists could interact to determine overall regional priorities from a scientific and technical standpoint. The geopolitical context, with the ongoing territorial disputes and arguments regarding sovereignty, dictated the need to exclude non-involved countries from participating in decisions regarding project management and dictated the limitations on membership of the Project Steering Committee. Similarly, the desire of China not to \u201cinternationalise\u201d the South China Sea resulted in limitation of the extent to which other international and regional organisations could be involved in the project.",

Both these decisions involved no increase in the amount of the GEF grant funds, merely a reallocation of existing funds (Table 4\n).

For example, the habitat subcomponents could have been executed by international NGOs such as IUCN or Wetlands International, the fisheries component by FAO and the Land-based pollution component by IOC-WESTPAC. In part, such a mode of project implementation was precluded by the requirement of China that no international organisation other than UNEP be involved in project management. Had such an alternative mode of execution been adopted, it is unlikely that the resultant project would have been as well integrated or as well accepted by the participating governments as the project ultimately was.",

The chosen formula depends upon political and cultural realities; in the extreme case of projects such as the South China Sea and FREPLATA, the Steering Committee exclude all observers, except for the project co-ordinator.

Many such organisations use inter-governmental bodies for purposes other than those for which they were created, frequently resulting in loss of momentum and in extreme cases breakdown of the communication mechanism itself. A further aspect of the operation of the present system was the use of experts and consultants entirely from within the region as noted by both the Mid-term evaluation and the SMPR.\u201cAll consultants and reviewers hired to date come from the participating countries and Singapore.

Too frequently, large-scale projects, if they create any kind of forum for scientific and technical specialists to meet, do so in the form of a single body advising the single political decision-making body.

This is because the nature of the environmental and ecological processes in these three systems, their use by human populations and the management measures required for their sustainability, are fundamentally different and, frequently, not part of the \u201cshared\u201d body of ecological knowledge. By creating a more specialised lower-level forum, the opportunity existed to consolidate a wider body of highly specialised knowledge and experience before sharing it with specialists having other, often very divergent, interests and concerns. Thus, not only were the mangrove scientists networked together but they were also linked to, and networked both nationally and regionally with, other habitat specialists, pollution experts, fisheries specialists, lawyers and economists. By having each regional entity working together, the opportunities for learning were expanded with, for example, the economic forum providing advice on matters such as economic evaluation to the biologists and the legal specialists providing advice to the national committees regarding the needs for strengthening the national legal regime.",
