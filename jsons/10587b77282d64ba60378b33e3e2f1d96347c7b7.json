As a global language, English has developed in interesting ways via social media and the Internet all over the world. However, it is only in special polities such as Singapore where it is used as the 'working language' of the country for a multilingual population base, that English has developed into a phenomenon that has to be studied, better understood and perhaps given a label such as 'glocal English.' The chapter will contribute to the ongoing discussions of what it means for English to be a global language and how it adapts as 'a communicative tool of immense political, ideological, and economic power' (Kachru, Kontalinguistik, 1996, pp. 906-913) in global-local tensions (e.g. commerce, trade, finance, industry, science and technology versus intra-ethnic and inter-ethnic communication within Singapore). In the shifting perspectives of what English is (really global or truly local?), what it does (for and in education), and how it is used in this country (globally and/or locally), the paper hopes to elucidate the dimensions of teaching and learning English in the Singapore context and perhaps more widely in an Asia-Pacific context.",

Wei (2000, p. 455 ) defines an ascendant bilingual as \"someone whose ability to function in a second language is developing due to increased use.\" I define an ascendant English-knowing bilingual community as one that functions increasingly in English but, because of its collective association with other languages and cultures (mainly Asian in this case), taps these links for identity and rootedness.

English figured prominently at the top of the applied linguistics agenda whether as an object of enquiry in language education or as a commodity of desire among eager learners of the language with implications for culture and development, pedagogy, and frameworks of study. Furthermore, the rise of the internet generation gave mobility and portability of English an added dimension-that of changing functions, values and meanings of English in the midst of globalization and acceleration brought about by instant connectivity across the world. \"Which English?\" \"Whose English?\" \"Who are the proper English?\" and \"Quo vadis English?\" were questions of debate and controversies that drew opposing conclusions. The English as an International Language (EIL), World Englishes (WE) and the more recent English Lingua Franca (ELF) paradigms, produced scholarship of different foci in the teaching and learning of English and the research (Pakir 2010) . For example, WE, which celebrates linguistic diversity and the approach that languages change and adapt, argues for multiple standards and recognition of the pluricentric nature of English. The WE (or Kachruvian) paradigm introduced the idea of three concentric circles of English-users: the Inner Circle (mainly found in the UK, the USA, Canada, Australia, New Zealand), the Outer Circle (mainly composed of speakers from former British and American colonies and territories with some familiarity and experience of English), and the Expanding Circle (mainly foreign learners of English). Older proponents of EIL, many found in the Inner Circle, focused on language proficiency and the importance of producing near-native like speakers of the language. On the other end, ELF promoted a new concept of English as a contact language \"for groups of English speakers having different first language backgrounds\", thus agreeing that the world will see pluricentric Englishes but with an ELF core.",

A global and yet local language, English is an unusual lingua franca in Singapore, a country that promotes extensive English-knowing bilingualism and one that is becoming an ascendant English-knowing bilingual community. Competing norms, internationally standardized for the global orientation versus locally indigenized English for a global orientation (Pakir 1994 (Pakir , 2001a have developed over several decades of pervasive English use in Singapore. The identification of Singlish, a variety of English immediately recognizable as Singaporean and often described as non-standard, has been the subject of scrutiny and news commentaries/reports. For example, a recent news clip reported that Yale-NUS professors, teaching at a new liberal arts college that opens at the National University of Singapore in August 2013, took a crash course in \"Singapore's unique colloquial language\" (Lee 2013, p. 10). The faculty members (including some from the United States, India and Australia) were willing to do whatever they could to understand the society they were joining \"and that includes being able to understand and correctly interpret what is being said around us\", said Charles Bailyn, Dean of the Yale-NUS College. The widespread use of English in Singapore by so many different ethnic groups has led to cultural mixing and hybridity in the language and a variety has emerged that can be \"taught\" or \"caught\" in Singapore.",

The first emphasised the necessity of one or (at most) two standard models of the English language with clearly defined English language skills to be taught to learners. The second, and more dynamic model, speaks to the modelling of language and culture in terms of flow: communication flow and counter-flow, producing a tension between the global and the local. Within the latter modelling, different norms of English will evolve over time. At the societal level, one can recognise a distinctive trend going global and yet remaining local as a response to shifting times (glocal became an acceptable English word around the time of this discussion and debate, within the decade of [1975] [1976] [1977] [1978] [1979] [1980] [1981] [1982] [1983] [1984] [1985] . At the sociolinguistic level, I suggested that the tension between global and local resolves itself in the emergence of Glocal English, one that is internationally oriented but locally appropriate and at the same time, one that could be locally oriented but globally understandable. An English in Singapore that is internationally intelligible but requires explanation for linguistic features that reflect deeply rooted substratal language influences.",

            "text": "Two illustrations will suffice, one from a Singaporean poet writing in English (\"A poem not too obiang\", Leow 1995) and the other, a rap song (\"SAR-vivors\", Phua Chu Kang 2003) used in educating Singaporeans in how to defend themselves against a dangerous bird flu virus that brought about some deaths in Singapore in 2003. They both demonstrate the use of glocal English-internationally intelligible and acceptable, but rooted in Singaporean sensibilities and local cultures. Glocal English is also evident in the lyrics of the rap-song featured in a YouTube video by Phua Chu Kang, a local comedian brought in to be \"Uncle Phua CK\" to teach Singaporeans to be SAR-vivors! (http: effectmatrix.com). The SARS outbreak in Canada, Hong Kong, Singapore (among other places) in 2003 required local populations to respond by following sanitary habits, and Singapore's fight against the virus in a publicity blitz led by Phua Chu Kang, the well-recognised sitcom local actor, enabled the local population to fight the virus which gave rise to the identified Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). Much of the language incorporates local idioms (\"then at least got hope\"; \"play play\", \"think no one see you?\"), pragmatic particles (\"lah\", \"leh\") and loanwords mainly from the Chinese and Malay languages (\"kapui\", \"kena\", \"tahan\"). Glocal English in Singapore is easily identifiable as in the two examples given above. More problematic, however, is its definition. In 1999, I attempted to define a glocal language as \"globally appropriate but culturally relevant\". In terms of the sociolinguistic realities of Singapore, English will remain its most global language (until perhaps Mandarin becomes a strong contender in the future). But along with other English-knowing multilingual speakers throughout the world, Singaporeans have turned the language into a multifaceted one, serving both global and local needs. Going glocal (that is, going global while maintaining local roots) makes for greater awareness of intercultural and cross-cultural exchanges. The term \"Glocal English\" can be defined as English that is global and yet rooted in the local contexts of its English-knowing bilingual users. Glocal English is a language that has international status in its global spread but at the same time expresses local identities. In developing a new role as a global-local language, English supports local users and their uses for it, while serving to connect the world. This phenomenon of Glocal English is most often to be found in the countries where English has an institutionalized role, achieving range and depth in its spread. The glocalization of English in Singapore results from different kinds of cultural demands made on English and in the population's response to globalist and localist tensions. As Alsagoff avers (2007 Alsagoff avers ( , 2010 , the variables of globalism and localism produce cultural models of orientation that reflect contemporary patterns of English use in Singapore: in globalism-economic capital, authority, formality, distance, and educational attainment; in localism: socio-cultural capital, camaraderie, informality, closeness, community membership. Glocalization of English in Singapore suggests that language and identity are intertwined and fluid. Alsagoff (2010) offers a model variation of the use of an indigenized English in multilingual multicultural speech communities-\"developed from a perspective that allows us to see language as a meaning-making and identity-creation resource in a culturally grounded manner\" (p. 126).",

Can we hope to elucidate the dimensions of teaching and learning English in the Singapore context and perhaps more widely in an Asia-Pacific context? There will be the challenges to education and pedagogy and the expected ideological debates, for example, teaching only standard English (and suppressing Singlish or ignoring Glocal English); assessing English proficiency in Singapore with an external reference framework only; and examining role models presented by \"native\" versus \"non-native\" teachers of English in Singapore.",

Secondly, what can the current controversies among scholars working in different paradigms tell us about international English language education?
