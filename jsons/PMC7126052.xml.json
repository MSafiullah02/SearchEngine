            "text": "After the anthrax attacks in 2001, concerns regarding infectious bioaerosols in public safety have been brought to light. Bioaerosols vary in size from submicron to a few hundred microns. More specifically, bacteria and fungal spores have sizes ranging from 0.3 to 30 \u03bcm, whereas viruses are smaller, ranging from 20 to 300 nm (Hinds, 1999). Through aerosolization, large amounts of biological agents can be dispersed over a wide area in a very short period of time (Ratnesar-Shumate et al., 2008). One can also inexpensively contaminate an entire building by spraying bioaerosol into its ventilation system; for example, a medical nebulizer can be purchased by less than $2. Hence, aerosolization is deemed as one of the most effective methods for biological attacks (Henderson, 1998, Kortepeter and Parker, 1999) and measures to counter such attacks are necessary. The outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2003, the long-lasting threat of avian flu and the recent outbreak of the H1N1 Influenza A virus have also raised public awareness of the need to protect the public from natural bioaerosols. In addition, exposure to concentrated airborne microorganisms is associated with allergenic diseases (Jo and Seo, 2005, Ren et al., 1999). All these are calling for better control of exposure to bioaerosols albeit intentionally released or natural (Douwes et al., 2003, Lee et al., 2008).",

            "text": "Filtration is one of the most commonly applied methods for air purification. Due to their simple structure and low cost, fibrous air filters are among the most popular ones (Yun et al., 2007). Nanofibrous filtration media have small fiber size, allowing integration of small pore size and large surface areas. Gas slip occurs on nanofibers, which reduces air resistance (Li et al., 2009, Zhang et al., 2009). All these advantages make nanofiber filtration a promising alternative to existing filters (Barhate & Ramakrishna, 2007). However, air filters alone may not provide sufficient protection against pathogenic bioaerosols, if the captured microorganisms are reentrained into the air. Therefore, it is necessary to add a treatment to the filters to inactivate the microorganisms. Ultraviolet (UV) light is effective in killing bacteria but has limitations on spores (Nicholson, Schuerger, & Setlow, 2005), whereas for a biocidal filter the active chemical is consumed (e.g. by vaporization or reaction) over time (Lee, Wu, Wysocki, Farrah, & Wander, 2008). A remedy to this issue is microwave disinfection. Microwave is an electromagnetic wave with frequencies ranging from 300 MHz to 300 GHz (Jones, Lelyveld, Mavrofidis, Kingman, & Miles, 2002). Volumetric heating, selective heating, and hot-spot effect distinguish microwave heating from conventional heating (Zhang & Hayward, 2006).",

            "text": "Since the mid-1980s, microwave induced/assisted reactions have been studied and widely applied. Among these microwave assisted reactions is the use of microwave irradiation for killing microorganisms (Apostolou et al., 2005; Celandroni et al., 2004; Vaid & Bishop, 1998). Some researchers, especially those among earlier research studies, believe that the microwave inactivates the microbes solely through thermal effects. Goldblith and Wang (1967) studied the effect of microwave irradiation on Escherichia coli (E. coli) and Bacillus subtilis (B. subtilis) and failed to detect any non-thermal effects. Jeng, Kaczmarek, Woodworth and Balasky (1987) found no significant non-thermal effects in a dry microwave disinfection process. Fujikawa et al. (1992) investigated the kinetics of E. coli destruction by microwave irradiation and found the difference between microwave exposure and conventional heating was not remarkable. Meanwhile, other studies have reported their observations of non-thermal effect during microwave disinfection of microorganisms. They distinguished the non-thermal effect through examination of damaged cells (Campanha et al., 2007; Celandroni et al., 2004), distorted membrane structure and function (Persson et al., 1992, Phelan et al., 1994), increased release of Ca2+, K+, DNA, dipicolinic acid and protein (Campanha et al., 2007; Celandroni et al., 2004; Vaid & Bishop, 1998) and altered the enzyme activities (Dreyfuss & Chipley, 1980) after microwave irradiation. Betti et al. (2004) acknowledged the disruption of weak bonds in active protein forms, enhanced production of reactive oxygen species, and cell-signaling pathway interference to microwave non-thermal effects. Watanabe et al. (2000) found that the ionic strength can affect the microwave disinfection rate of microbes and linked the effect to the current within the cells generated by microwave.",

The E. coli population on the slant was then physically removed by a plastic loop and transferred to Ringer\u2019s solution (Fisher, Cat. no.: S77939, NY) and vortexed to prepare the E. coli suspension for bioaerosol generation. Every three days, a new colony was picked up and inoculated into another Difco Nutrient Agar plate to renew the culture.",

As a gram positive bacterium, B. subtilis has the ability to sporulate and has been used extensively as a benign surrogate to Bacillus anthracis spores (Montville, Dengrove, De Siano, Bonnet, & Schaffner, 2005). B. subtilis endospores are ellipsoidal in shape, approximately 0.8\u20131.2 \u03bcm in length, and have an aerodynamic diameter of 0.9 \u03bcm (Aizenberg, Reoonen, Grinshpun, & Willeke, 2000). Although considerably resistant to heating, B. subtilis spores have been shown to be inactivated effectively by microwave irradiation in a saline solution (Celandroni et al., 2004). B. subtilis vegetative cells were obtained from the University of Florida Department of Microbiology and Cell Sciences. The vegetative cells were subject to the process outlined by Lee, Wu, Wysocki, Farrah and Wander (2008) to induce sporulation. African violet agar, which included 200 mL African violet soil extract, 800 mL deionized (DI) water, 1 g yeast extract (Fisher Scientific) and 15 g Difco Nutrient Agar was used (ATCC, 1998). B. subtilis vegetative cells were inoculated in this agar and incubated at 36 \u00b0C for endospore development. After one week, a 2 mL DI water suspension of B. subtilis was created by vortexing the microbes off the surface of an agar slant. This suspension was heated in a water bath at 80 \u00b0C for 30 min to kill the remaining vegetative cells. The suspension was subsequently cooled and centrifuged at 3500 rpm for 10 min to remove cell debris. After applying the malachite green spore-staining technique (Munro, 2000), microscopic analysis showed the absence of vegetative cells in the purified suspension. The spore suspension was used immediately after the purification process.",

One of the quadrants was directly inoculated into 50 mL of Ringer\u2019s solution and vortexed to extract the microorganisms. This inoculated solution was serially diluted, plated and incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 24 h. The number of colony forming unit (CFU) on the plates was then counted. Only plates with between 30 and 300 units were counted. The remaining quadrants were placed between two SiC disks (Vesuvius, 47 mm OD\u00d720 mm thickness, 45 PPI, OBSIC, lot no.: AL7370101L) and heated in the microwave oven for varying periods of time (30, 45, 60 and 90 s) to determine the microwave disinfection efficiency and to ascertain how long it would take to completely sterilize the bioaerosols by microwave irradiation. SiC disks were used because they are a good microwave absorber and can be quickly heated by microwaves. After microwave irradiation, the quadrants were also inoculated into the Ringer\u2019s solution and cultured as described above. In the case that had no plate with more than 30 colonies, the plate of the lowest dilution level was analyzed. The survival fraction (S) on the filter was then calculated as S=c\nt/c\n0, where c\nt is the viable bioaerosol concentration of the quadrant treated in microwave for time t, and c\n0 is the viable bioaerosol concentration of the quadrant without microwave treatment. Additionally, to verify that the 4 quadrants collected similar amounts of microorganisms, a triplicate set of control tests (where all of the 4 quadrants were not microwaved) were carried out for E. coli. Results showed that the average coefficient of variation (CV) was 32%. Hence, the deviations are insignificant considering that microwave disinfection is measured logarithmically.",

After the dilution dryer, the air flow was split equally into three paths of 4 LPM each. The first path was directed to the quartz filter holder inside the microwave oven. The pressure drop across the filter was monitored by a differential pressure gauge and the flow rate across the microwave/filtration system was adjusted according to the pressure drop. The corresponding face velocity across the filter holder was 5.3 cm/s based on the effective filter diameter in the holder (40 mm). The second 4 LPM split stream was directed to a filter holder outside the microwave oven with an identical filter type as was present in the microwave oven. The third split stream was directed to a Biosampler (SKC, Eighty-Four, PA) without any filter to determine the feed concentration. A vacuum pump (Model no.: RVE56B17F5305A, Marathon Electric, WI) was used to draw air from the system in order to prevent pressure built up in glass joints, which would otherwise be forced apart. Low numbers of CFU were noticed in the preliminary B. subtilis spore data due to the endospore purification process, in which some vegetative cells in the culture did not fully sporulate and were killed when subjected to heat.

(2004) observed complete disinfection of B. subtilis spores in a 0.25 mL saline solution under 100 W microwave for 20 min where boiling occurred within 45\u00b15 s. Because a different heating medium and setup was used, it is not appropriate to compare their results directly to the present study. In the previous study, spores were suspended in a solution during irradiation while in this study spore aerosols were collected on microwave transparent PAN fibers which required SiC disks for heating. Although fiber heating occurred by conduction with the SiC disks rather than direct heating by radiation, the SiC disks were able to reach a much higher temperature than boiling water near 100 \u00b0C. Therefore, the method developed in this study has greater potential for faster spore disinfection.",

Compared to other filter disinfection methods, the use of microwaves proved superior with respect to the magnitude of inactivation and the application time required. For example, a study investigating UV irradiation of air filter media required 1 h to achieve 97% inactivation of collected Mycobacterium parafortuitum. For the fungal spore Aspergillus versicolor, only 75% on-filter inactivation was achieved under the same conditions (Kujundzic et al., 2006). Similarly, another study involving microorganism inactivation by photocatalysis of a TiO2 filter by UV required hours for 50% inactivation of bacteria (Lin & Li, 2003). Compared to these two studies, the results of the present study indicate that microwaves have significant potential in air filter disinfection.",

It is of great interest to monitor the real-time temperature pattern on the filter surface during irradiation and the disinfection temperature of the microorganism for better understanding of the whole process that will be helpful in improving the effectiveness of the system. However, due to technical limitations, real-time measurement was not conducted in this study. There are several ways that may be possible for the monitoring, including fiber optical temperature measurement, pyrometer, infrared (IR) cameras, etc., that can be considered in future works.",

Microwave power is found to be the major factor affecting the effectiveness of disinfecting biological agents, whereas microwave application time is a less significant factor in the process. Endospores such as B. subtilis spores do need a higher microwave power to be efficiently disinfected than vegetative cells such as E. coli due to their resistivity to heat. On the other hand, microwave non-thermal effect was observed by an experiment running without a filter. Reducing flow velocity to decrease heat dissipation would also enhance disinfection efficiency. In order to further understand and optimize this process, future works are needed to measure real-time temperature on the filter surface and to provide a more uniform electric field in the microwave oven.",
