Studies confirm that individuals who have experienced [2], or not [3], COVID-19 emergencies have mental disorders such as stress, anxiety, and depression. There are also psychological disorders of occupational origin, such as those found in members of medical teams working in contact with infected patients [4]. In general, the population confined to their homes appears with new emotional disorders (irritability, insomnia, fear, confusion, anger, frustration, boredom), which previously did not suffer from them, but now even persist after the quarantine is lifted [5]. Furthermore, recent studies report that the virus not only affects the respiratory system, it could also be affecting the nervous system of infected people [6], which could cause the appearance of new psychological diseases.",
