The rate of late-onset sepsis was strongly and inversely associated with birthweight and gestational age, decreasing from ~60% in neonates with gestational age <25 weeks to 20% in infants born at 28 weeks\u2019 gestation.6 Consequently, institutions caring for more extremely-low-birthweight (ELBW) infants have higher rates. Management practices, particularly those concerning utilization and maintenance care of central venous catheters (CVCs) or peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs), can further impact these rates of infection.7\n",

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN) definition8 for a CLABSI includes: (1) isolation of a pathogen from one blood culture or of a skin commensal from two blood cultures; (2) one or more clinical signs of infection (e.g., apnea, bradycardia, or temperature instability) that are not related to an infection at another site; and (3) presence of a CVC at the time the blood culture is obtained or within 48 hours before the development of the infection. A rate of HAI that is linked to device utilization, such as a CLABSI, helps control for variability in management practices from institution to institution, and the preferred unit of measure is infections per 1000 catheter-days. The NHSN continues to recommend that CLABSI be a major focus of surveillance and prevention efforts in NICUs, and to that end, provide summary data on CLABSI rates for different birthweight groups. The NHSN data help individual NICUs assess their CLABSI rate relative to other NICUs. Values at the extremes of the NHSN data indicate problems with effective infection control or underreporting of CLABSI events, respectively. Individual NICUs are encouraged to monitor and compare their CLABSI rates with NHSN data, which are updated annually and usually published in December.9\n",

Consequently, considerable variability has existed in clinical practice concerning performance of a lumbar puncture in neonates with suspected late-onset sepsis. In a prospective study of 9641 VLBW infants who survived >3 days, late-onset meningitis occurred in 134 infants. This represented 1.4% of all infants and 5% of those who had a lumbar puncture performed. Compared with infants without septicemia, VLBW infants with meningitis were more likely to have seizures (25% versus 2%), and were more likely to die (23% versus 2%).2 Importantly, one-third (45 of 134) of the infants with meningitis had simultaneously drawn blood cultures that were negative. Because meningitis can alter duration of antibiotic therapy and long-term prognosis, all VLBW infants with suspected late-onset sepsis should have a lumbar puncture as part of the initial diagnostic evaluation, unless they are too critically ill to tolerate the procedure. In the latter case, lumbar puncture should be performed when clinical stabilization is achieved.",

Clinicians have tended to avoid suprapubic bladder aspiration in neonates because of the risk of serious, albeit rare, complications such as bowel perforation16 and increased pain.17 Fortunately, sterile urethral catheterization can be performed easily by experienced nurses, even in ELBW infants, and has a potentially higher rate of success in obtaining urine compared with suprapubic bladder aspiration.18, 19\n",

New definitions from the CDC/NHSN in 2008 attempt to provide reproducible criteria for surveillance, classifying pneumonia into 3 specific types: clinically defined (PNU1), pneumonia with laboratory finding (PNU2), and pneumonia in immunocompromised patients (PNU3).8 In general, infants and children fall into category 1. Diagnosis of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is especially difficult in neonates because noninfectious conditions such as respiratory distress syndrome and bronchopulmonary dysplasia are common and frequently cause radiologic abnormalities. The NHSN has published specific guidelines adapted to infants <1 year, but these are not specific to the premature infant. New benchmark data are becoming available through the NHSN. The highest incidence of VAP occurs in infants with a median birthweight of 1.3 per 1000 ventilator days \u2264750 grams.9\n",

Cordero et al.22 showed that finding purulent tracheal aspirate with positive tracheal culture in mechanically ventilated neonates in the absence of worsening clinical or radiologic findings is more consistent with clinically insignificant tracheal colonization than with VAP. Apisarnthanarak et al.23 performed a prospective cohort study addressing the risk factors, microbiology, and outcomes of VAP in neonates. Their definition of VAP required new and persistent radiologic evidence of focal infiltrates >48 hours after initiating mechanical ventilation and treatment with antibiotics for >7 days for presumed VAP. By this definition, 19 of 67 (28%) of mechanically ventilated VLBW infants developed VAP, with a rate of 6.5 per 1000 ventilator-days.23 Gram-negative bacteria were isolated from tracheal aspirates in 94% of VAP episodes and most cases were polymicrobial. VAP developed in neonates on a median of day 30 and the risk of VAP increased by 11% for every additional week an infant was mechanically ventilated. VAP was strongly associated with mortality in neonates who required NICU care >30 days.23\n",

Stoll et al.3 found it alarming that 44% of all VLBW infants in the Neonatal Research Network were treated with vancomycin whether or not they had CoNS BSI. The Hospital Infection Control and Practices Advisory Committee of the CDC recommend avoiding empiric vancomycin therapy in patients with suspected sepsis to prevent the emergence and spread of vancomycin-resistant enterococci.87 Karlowicz et al.33 showed that avoidance of empiric use of vancomycin had no impact on the very low rate of fulminant CoNS sepsis in neonates and that the practice of beginning vancomycin only after CoNS was identified in blood culture did not prolong the duration of BSI. Despite ongoing education, vancomycin continues to be the most commonly used drug in NICUs surveyed and was inappropriately used 32% of the time.58 It is possible to reduce the empiric use of vancomycin in units that have low levels of MRSA infection without compromising patient care or safety. Chiu et al. demonstrated that the application of guidelines for vancomycin use decreased neonatal vancomycin exposure from 5.2 to 3.1 per 1000 patient-days (40% reduction) and 10.8 to 5.5 per 1000 patient-days (49% reduction) in two separate NICUs with no change in causes of infection, duration of BSI, or incidence of complications or attributable deaths.88 Antibiotic stewardship, specific to each NICU, remains critical to prevention of spread of resistant bacteria and avoidance of use of unnecessary medications.",

Pentoxifylline also has been reviewed by the Cochrane Database as an adjunct to antibiotics for treatment of suspected or confirmed sepsis or NEC, with results, suggesting a decrease in all-cause mortality, but the studies evaluated were small.96 More research is needed to determine the usefulness of this adjunctive agent. A larger, multicenter trial used GM-CSF for prophylaxis of late-onset sepsis in neonates <31 weeks\u2019 gestation and small for gestational age but did not show significant difference in sepsis-free survival.97 A review of the data from studies of granulocyte transfusions in septic neonates demonstrated improved outcome in the situation of neutropenic depletion of the marrow storage pool, but associated morbidities, including fluid overload, worsening hypoxia and respiratory distress from leukocyte sequestration in the lung, graft-versus-host disease, and risk of transmission of viral infections.95 Careful assessment of the risks versus the benefits of leukocyte administration is required, as is the use of any of the other adjunctive therapies.98\n",

It may be reasonable to use fluconazole with dosing of 3 mg/kg twice per week until intravenous (central or peripheral) access is no longer needed in the high-risk populations, starting in the first 2 days of life.120 Nystatin prophylaxis also has been studied (but not as extensively) and it also shows potential effectiveness in the same high-risk population but may have increased gastrointestinal side effects compared with fluconazole.120\n",
