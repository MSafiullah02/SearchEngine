Seasonal epidemics and sporadic pandemics of influenza are caused by the transmission of influenza virus via aerosols [3,4]. Since the respiratory tract is the portal of influenza virus entry, in-theory the best means of protection would be to use a vaccine to generate a local memory immune response able to neutralize the virus at the site of infection. However, the majority of the currently available influenza vaccines are administered via intramuscular or subcutaneous injection [5]. Injected vaccines generate strong systemic immunity but minimal mucosal immunity [6,7]. Moreover, injected vaccines can cause local reactions including pain, swelling and redness at the injection site, needle phobia, and transmission of infectious diseases due to needle stick injuries. An influenza vaccine formulation that could be administered via the respiratory tract would overcome these drawbacks of current injected formulations, is therefore needed.",

This problem could be avoided by the use of inactivated influenza vaccine formulations suitable for delivery via the respiratory tract. Already in 1969, Waldman et al. reported that pulmonary vaccine administration was as effective as the conventional i.m. administration for preventing influenza associated illness [8]. Pulmonary vaccines can be delivered as liquids or as dry powders [6,9,10]. In pre-clinical studies, pulmonary delivery of both liquid and dry powder influenza vaccine formulations has shown to induce mucosal as well as systemic immune responses [6,7,11,12]. However, the magnitude of immune responses evoked by these non-adjuvanted vaccines was low with low mucosal IgA titers and low numbers of memory cells; this might result in short lived protection against infection [7,12,13]. These issues might be solved by the use of a suitable adjuvant to boost the immune memory responses able to be elicited by respiratory tract administration of influenza vaccine.",

            "text": "Identification of an adjuvant suitable for administration via the respiratory tract is not as easy as for parenteral administration, with no adjuvant currently approved for intranasal or pulmonary use in clinic. The problems of developing a mucosal adjuvant for influenza vaccines are highlighted by the issue of rare cases of facial palsy in clinical trial subjects who were administered an intranasal inactivated influenza vaccine containing a latent toxin adjuvant, resulting in the vaccine being abandoned [14]. Of current approved alternatives, alum, is not effective in influenza vaccines [15], and in addition causes inflammasome activation, local cell necrosis with DNA release and forms insoluble aggregates rendering it unsuitable for pulmonary use [16,17]. The only other currently approved influenza vaccine adjuvants are based on squalene oil emulsions, which are restricted to subcutaneous or intramuscular use. Moreover, the administration of oil-based emulsions to the respiratory tract are most likely detrimental for the normal balance of the alveolar lining fluid; thus interfering with lung function. Newer experimental adjuvants such as toll-like receptor agonists work via activation of NF\u03baB. However, NF\u03baB is a key inducer of inflammatory responses, and therefore pulmonary administration of these agonists may induce unacceptable lung inflammation [18]. Hence, the number of candidate adjuvants likely to be suitable for respiratory tract use is very limited.",

Advax adjuvant is composed of the insoluble particulate polymorph of inulin, also referred to as delta inulin. The inulin that makes up Advax adjuvant is rapidly excreted from the body through renal excretion with complete clearance within approximately 3 weeks after parenteral administration [22]. Advax adjuvant comprises discoidal shape particles of 1\u20132 \u03bcm in diameter, formed by assembly of a series of lamellar crystalline sheets [23]. Adjuvantation of parenterally administered vaccines with Advax has shown to improve the immunogenicity and protective capacity of several vaccine candidates against hepatitis B, anthrax, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus, listeria and influenza [21,[24], [25], [26], [27]]. The exact mechanism by which Advax boosts immune responses upon parenteral administration is still under investigation [23].",

The rationale for the 0.1 \u03bcg WIV immunization dose for challenge study was that this was found to be the optimal vaccine dose to see differences between groups in clinical outcomes, whereas 5 \u03bcg HA was found to be the optimal dose to see differences between groups in immunogenicity measures such as HI and MN. The vaccine was administered under anaesthesia using an intratracheal intubation and a microsprayer. Two weeks after the immunization, animals were challenged with a live virus (A/PR/8/34). The 50% mouse lethal dose (LD50) of the virus was estimated in adult BALB/c mice by the Reed-Muench method [32]. One LD50 corresponded to 1250 TCID50 on MDCK cells (data not shown) and the virus challenge dose used was 10,000 TCID50 (8xLD50) administered intranasally in a volume of 30 \u03bcl which gave 100% lethality in control non-immunized mice. Daily weights and a sickness scoring system based on coat condition, posture and activity was used to assess the extent of clinical disease with mice evaluated daily. Ruffled fur (absent = 0; slightly present = 1; present = 2), hunched back (absent = 0; slightly present = 1; present = 2) and activity (normal = 0; reduced = 1; severely reduced = 2). The final score was the addition of each individual symptom score (e.g. an animal showing slightly ruffled fur (1), slightly hunched back (1) and reduced activity (1) was scored as 3. Mice were euthanized if they had developed a clinical score of 6.",

Further, upon dispersion from RODOS, the average geometric particle size (X50) of SFD Advax-adjuvanted WIV formulation was found to be comparable to SFD non-adjuvanted WIV formulation, i.e. 8.64 and 9.12 \u03bcm, respectively (Fig. 1E). An important criterion for particles to be suitable for inhalation is their aerodynamic particle size, which ideally should be 1\u20135 \u03bcm [33,34]. Aerodynamic particle size was calculated according to the formula described by Bhide et al. [35]. Aerodynamic particle size of both WIV and Advax-adjuvanted WIV after SFD were found to be in the required size range, i.e. 1\u20135 \u03bcm, thus indicating the suitability of both these formulations for pulmonary immunization (Fig. 1F). Thus, upon SFD of WIV formulated either with or without Advax, powder particles with a similar size and morphology were formed making a fair comparison between the non-adjuvanted and Advax-adjuvanted SFD powders possible.",

            "text": "An important goal of influenza vaccination is the induction of antibodies in the respiratory tract, the portal of influenza virus entry [37,38]. The traditional parenteral route of influenza vaccine administration is inefficient in inducing mucosal immune responses. Similarly, pulmonary immunization with non-adjuvanted WIV generally induces only low levels of local or mucosal immunity [9,12]. In order to investigate the potential of Advax to boost local mucosal immunity, respiratory tract immunity was determined a week after the second immunization by assessment of nasal IgA and BAL anti-influenza IgA and IgG levels along with ASC in lungs. As expected, WIV administered via the i.m. route failed to induce substantial nasal or lung IgA titers (Fig. 3A, B). Compared to the i.m. route, higher nose IgA titers were found for Advax-adjuvanted WIV formulations administered to the respiratory tract, which, however, were only significantly higher for the liquid formulation administered to the nose and the powder formulation administered to the lungs (Fig. 3A). Yet, compared to non-adjuvanted WIV formulation, only the Advax-adjuvanted liquid formulation administered to the lungs elicited significantly higher nasal IgA titers. By contrast, a significant effect of Advax adjuvant was seen on BAL IgA in both the i.n. and pulmonary vaccine groups with approximately four-eight-fold higher lung IgA titers than mice immunized with corresponding non-adjuvanted WIV formulations (Fig. 3B). Hence, Advax either administered i.n. or into the lungs increased lung but not nasal IgA production. This might be due to the relatively smaller surface area of the nasal mucosa compared to that of the lower respiratory tract [39]. Since 1 ml of PBS was used for collecting both nasal and lung washes, the concentration of IgA in the lung washes would be expected to be much higher than in the nasal washes if the amount of IgA per specific surface area in the lung and nose would be the same. The fact that only pulmonary powder but not liquid delivery where adjuvanted or WIV alone induced increased nasal IgA, might suggest powder particles may have been exhaled by the mice back up from the bronchi into the nasal nares after the insufflation procedure, whereas the liquid vaccine may have been more likely to instantly adhere to the bronchial walls and thereby not remain suspended in air and able to escape into the nose.",

In order to investigate whether incorporation of Advax in a WIV formulation and delivery of the adjuvanted vaccine to the respiratory tract has an influence on the type and magnitude of cell-mediated immune responses induced, the frequency of influenza-specific IFN-\u03b3 and IL-4 secreting splenic T cells was determined. In addition, IFN-\u03b3 and IL-4 levels were measured in supernatants of splenocytes stimulated in- vitro with WIV. Compared to WIV alone, Advax-adjuvanted WIV formulation was associated with a significant increase in the number of IFN-\u03b3 secreting influenza-specific T cells (Fig. 4A). Likewise, increased production of IFN-\u03b3 was seen in Advax-adjuvanted WIV groups when compared to non-adjuvanted WIV, although, the differences were only significant for the pulmonary immunized groups (Fig. 4B). Moreover, Advax-adjuvanted WIV was associated with significantly higher frequencies of both IL-4 secreting T cells as well as significantly higher amounts of IL-4 in the culture supernatants as compared to WIV alone (Fig. 4C, D). By contrast, i.m. administered WIV induced a high number of IL-4 secreting T cells but low numbers of IFN-\u03b3 secreting T cells (Fig. 4A, C), which was matched by the IFN-\u03b3 and IL-4 levels measured in the culture supernatants (Fig. 4B, D).",

In order to characterize the phenotype of class switched B cells, we determined the fraction of memory B cells among the total number of class switched B cells after i.n. or pulmonary delivery of WIV alone or with Advax adjuvant. A previous study has shown that memory B cells, particularly in lungs, play a key role in protection against influenza re-infection [43]. These memory B cells can be identified by the expression of CD38 [[43], [44], [45]]. Hence, cells isolated from lungs, spleen and bone marrow were stained for both IgM/IgD (to identify IgM/IgD\u2212 class switched cells) and the memory B cell marker, CD38 (Fig. 5A\u2013B). Advax-adjuvanted WIV administered via the pulmonary route led to an 8-fold increase in the frequency of memory B cells in the lungs, 4-fold in spleen and about 10-fold in bone marrow in comparison to administration with WIV alone (Fig. 5A\u2013B). Further analysis of these cells revealed that in lungs and spleen the percentage of memory B cells was particularly high among IgG producing cells (Fig. 5C, D) while in bone marrow it was high among IgA producing B cells (Fig. 5D). By contrast, much lower numbers of CD38+ B cells were seen in the i.n. immunized groups although still a 2\u20133 fold increase in lung memory B cells among IgG or IgA producing cells was observed in the Advax-adjuvanted WIV group when compared to the WIV alone group (Fig. 5A, C). Our data suggests that respiratory tract immunization, in particular, pulmonary immunization with Advax-adjuvanted WIV induces a large number of both class-switched IgG+ and IgA+ memory B cells with the IgG+ memory B cells primarily trafficking to the lungs and spleen and the IgA+ memory B cells instead trafficking to the bone marrow.",

Previous studies have shown that even in the absence of B cells and CD8+ effector/memory T cells, CD4+ effector/memory T cells can provide at least partial protection against influenza infection with recruitment of CD4+ T effector/memory cells to the lungs [50,51].

Besides CD103, the expression of CXCR3 on effector/memory is known to promote their migration and localization to infected lungs [46,47,54]. We therefore characterized CD4+ effector/memory T cells for the expression of the lung localization factor CXCR3 and the tissue resident T cell marker CD103. I.n. immunization with Advax-adjuvanted WIV formulation showed a minor increase in the percentage of CXCR3+ cells as compared to the corresponding non-adjuvanted WIV formulation. By contrast, pulmonary administration of Advax-adjuvanted WIV enhanced the percentage of CD4+ effector/memory expressing CXCR3 by 3-fold (Fig. 6B). Consistent with previous studies we also found that the augmented expression of CXCR3 on effector/memory T cells led to an increase in the migration of these cells to the lungs (Fig. 6A). Staining of the TRM marker, CD103, revealed that adjuvantation with Advax led to an approximately 2-fold increase in CD4+ TRMs in the lungs for pulmonary as well as for i.n. administered vaccine (Fig. 6C). Thus, immunization of mice with Advax-adjuvanted WIV, in particular via the pulmonary route, increased effector/memory T cells with augmentation in the expression of CXCR3 and CD103 cells in the lungs. This is consistent with previous studies, which showed that mucosal administration of an antigen is necessary for the generation of local T cell responses [53,55,56].",

However, in the mechanistic studies, mainly, pulmonary immunization with Advax-adjuvanted WIV was found to boost memory responses and the expression of lung localization factors. Hence, the pulmonary route was chosen for a challenge study. In the challenge study, we explored whether the enhanced immunity translated into enhanced protection if mice were exposed to a lethal dose of influenza virus. To maximize the stringency of the model, mice received just a single dose of pulmonary WIV (A/PR/8/34) with or without Advax. An Advax alone (without antigen) control group was not included as in previous studies we observed no effect of administering Advax alone on influenza disease, with recipients of Advax alone having the same clinical scores and dying at the same rate as saline-injected controls, whether the Advax was given i.m. [27] or via the pulmonary route (unpublished data). Since a highly immunogenic influenza virus strain was used, a low dose of 0.1 \u03bcg WIV with or without 1 mg of Advax was found to be optimal to avoid complete protection that might be induced by antigen alone (without adjuvant) with a high dose. After lethal viral challenge, we found that, mice that received non-adjuvanted WIV were not protected against influenza infection, as evidenced by a rapid weight loss and a clinical sickness score of 6 within 8\u20139 days after challenge (Fig. 7A\u2013C). By contrast, mice that received a single pulmonary dose of WIV formulated with Advax adjuvant were fully protected with no weight loss and no clinical disease symptoms after challenge (Fig. 7A\u2013C). A Cox-Mantel log rank test revealed that the difference in survival between non-adjuvanted WIV and Advax-adjuvanted WIV group was significant (p = 0.029). Similar outcome was obtained upon repetition of the experiments twice.",

To our knowledge, this is the first study to show that an effective Advax-adjuvanted dry powder influenza vaccine formulation with full retention of biological activity of the WIV antigen and the Advax adjuvant can be prepared by SFD. Though both liquid and dry powder influenza vaccine formulations can be used for pulmonary administration, a dry powder formulation is preferable due to its long-term stability at ambient temperatures, which facilitates stockpiling [10,57,58]. In cases of an influenza pandemic, a stockpiled dry powder formulation would be readily available and easy to administer in mass vaccination campaigns. For Advax-adjuvanted influenza formulations, the i.n. and pulmonary route were found to be equally effective in boosting humoral and cellular immunity, however, pulmonary route was found to be superior for the augmentation of memory responses as well as lung localization factors. Moreover, pulmonary immunization with Advax-adjuvanted WIV was found to be equally effective as an i.m. immunization with WIV in terms of induction of systemic and cellular immunity and was superior in terms of mucosal immunity. In addition, a single pulmonary administration with Advax-adjuvanted WIV at a low dose of 0.1 \u03bcg WIV not only protected the animals from weight loss and observable clinical symptoms but also led to their complete survival which is in contrast to the animals immunized with WIV alone. Moreover, no adverse effects (weight loss, sickness) were seen in animals that received pulmonary immunization with Advax adjuvant. Hence, inhalation of Advax-adjuvanted influenza vaccine as either a liquid or a dry powder formulation may be a promising alternative to conventional parenteral influenza vaccines.",
