            "text": "Most models of epidemic spread, including many designed specifically for COVID-19, implicitly assume that social networks are undirected, i.e., that the infection is equally likely to spread in either direction whenever a contact occurs. In particular, this assumption implies that the individuals most likely to spread the disease are also the most likely to receive it from others. Here, we review results from the theory of random directed graphs which show that many important quantities, including the reproductive number and the epidemic size, depend sensitively on the joint distribution of in-and out-degrees (\"risk\" and \"spread\"), including their heterogeneity and the correlation between them. By considering joint distributions of various kinds we elucidate why some types of heterogeneity cause a deviation from the standard Kermack-McKendrick analysis of SIR models, i.e., so called mass-action models where contacts are homogeneous and random, and some do not. We also show that some structured SIR models informed by complex contact patterns among types of individuals (age or activity) are simply mixtures of Poisson processes and tend not to deviate significantly from the simplest mass-action model. Finally, we point out some possible policy implications of this directed structure, both for contact tracing strategy and for interventions designed to prevent super spreading events. In particular, directed networks have a forward and backward version of the classic \"friendship paradox\" -forward links tend to lead to individuals with high risk, while backward links lead to individuals with high spread -such that a combination of both forward and backward contact tracing is necessary to find superspreading events and prevent future cascades of infection.",

We can then analyze various compartmental epidemic models (e.g., SIR, SEIR, etc.) and how they depend on the structure of the resulting graphs [2] [3] [4] [5] . For the simplest random graphs, epidemics end up being equivalent to classic, mass-action compartmentalized models in epidemiology, which can be analyzed using systems of differential equations. For instance, the SIR model on Erd\u0151s-R\u00e9nyi random graphs, where every pair of nodes is independently connected with the same probability, behaves like the Kermack-McKendrick SIR solution in the limit where the number of nodes, i.e. the population size, is large [6] [7] [8] .",

            "text": "However, graphs allow us to model many kinds of heterogeneity and structure, and explore how and when heterogeneity affects epidemic thresholds and sizes. Since the degree of a node is the number of links or contacts it has, we can model superspreading events (SSEs) by having a heavy-tailed degree distribution, where some nodes have degree considerably larger than the mean [9] . A random contact is more likely to be with a high-degree individual, who has more secondary contacts in turn. Thus the average degree of a node hit by a random contact is greater than the average degree of a random node. This phenomenon is often called the \"friendship paradox\": on average, your friends have more friends than you do [10] . In the epidemic context it has two effects. First, the reproductive number is not a. low-risk, but high-spread b. high-risk, but low-spread C. high-risk and high-spread simply the mean degree; it depends also on its second moment or variance (see Box I). In particular, even if we hold the mean degree constant, increasing the variance lowers the critical transmission rate-i.e., the per contact probability of transmission needed to reach the epidemic threshold [2] . Second, as developed by [11] [12] [13] and recently pointed out as highly relevant for COVID-19 in [14, 15] , the \"friendship paradox\"can amplify the effectiveness of contact tracing, giving a better chance that a contact leads to a SSE, helping us prevent further cascades of infection. However, these results on SSEs assume that the graph is undirected: that is, links are equally likely to spread the disease in either direction. While this may be true for individuals who attend a group event or work together in close quarters, some some mechanisms of spread, such as surface contacts from handling and delivery, are inherently directed [16] . In network terms, an individual might have high out-degree (e.g. a high viral load if infected) but low in-degree (a low risk of receiving the infection from others), or vice versa. In addition, many non-pharmaceutical interventions to prevent disease spread have a directed effect. Wearing a simple mask is one such mechanism, as it is believed to reduce the probability that the wearer spreads a respiratory disease like COVID-19 to others, but not to strongly protect the wearer from receiving the disease from others [17, 18] .",

Here each node has an in-degree, i.e., the number of contacts from whom it could receive the disease, and an out-degree, the number of contacts to whom it could spread the disease if it becomes infected. We can think of the in-degree as the risk of this individual, and the out-degree as their spread. As illustrated in Fig. 1 , an individual might contribute to rapid spreading by having high risk, high spread, or both. For instance, an average immunocompromised individual might have high risk but low spread, while someone who fails to wear a mask even while those around them do might have low risk and high spread. Finally, someone who by choice or necessity interacts with many others in close quarters would have both high risk and high spread, as in the traditional undirected picture of SSEs.",

A classic question in the theory of branching processes is whether the resulting tree of contacts is finite or infinite. Since the total number of descendants of a link is finite if and only if this is true of all of its children, the probability of this event obeys a fixed-point equation which can be written compactly using probability generating functions (see Box IV). Now consider the epidemic size. Nodes receive the infection from their predecessors, who receive it from their predecessors in turn. This leads to a backwards branching process of incoming links, where a link has i \"children\" (or perhaps we should call them parents now) if it comes from a node with in-degree i. If a node has only a finite number of ancestors in this tree, then with high probability none of them will be the initial node and it will remain uninfected.",

What is so special about this distribution? As it turns out, the Poisson distribution is the only one where the excess degree has the same distribution as the degree itself: the probability a link leads to k secondary contacts equals the probability that a random node has k contacts. In terms of the friendship paradox, the probability you have k friends is the same as the probability your friend has k friends in addition to you. In particular, these two distributions have the same mean, so R 0 = k . This is similar to the mass-action hypothesis of Kermack and McKendrick since it implies that information about the contact structure does not matter.

The undirected Poisson case, where this independence does not hold since the in-and out-degrees are identical by definition, is somewhat unique since the lack of backtracking and the friendship paradox balance out.

Note that these equations are perfectly equivalent to the model described in the Supplementary Materials of Ref. [30] .The equations can be understood as setting a Poisson distribution of in-degree with average \u03b2\u03c3 i M i,j /\u03b3 coming from group j for all individuals in group i. The model therefore corresponds to a mixture of directed Poisson processes and it is unclear how much we should expect these models to differ from the much simpler, undirected and unstructured, mass-action SIR. We apply our framework to a multitype directed graph [34] (see Box V) where the type of a node corresponds to their age group and where direction allows us to consider heterogeneous susceptibility. As shown in Fig. 3(right) , the multitype directed graph approach exactly solves for the final epidemic size produced by the system presented in Eq. (20) . Our solution thus provide a general solution, as a set of polynomial equations, to exactly solve structured SIR-like models. Perhaps more importantly, this solution highlights how the solution of such systems is actually a simple mixture of Poisson processes and therefore a combination of Kermack-McKendrick-like terms. As can be observed in Fig. 3(right) , this implies that if the average R 0 is large enough (say, greater than 1.5), the result is unlikely to deviate much from the pure Kermack-McKendrick solution given that it is composed of a combination of Kermack-McKendrick terms which are all drawn from relatively flat function. Such models, which are usually composed of a handful to a couple dozen types of nodes, can not truly embrace the full heterogeneity of risk and spread produced by biology, demographics and human behaviour.",

(a) An undirected graph where all nodes are exactly the same, showing that too much homogeneity is different from mass-action mixing. (b) A simple undirected, Poisson graph: The fish out of water. Poisson graphs can be represented with a network structure but make predictions that fall back exactly on classic mass-action models and therefore fail to include important network effects. (c) We take the undirected, Poisson graph and add directions to all links (left graph). This procedure preserves the in-and out-degree for all nodes. We then rewire the directed links to obtain a simple graph without overlap between contacts (right graph). Should we expect the Kermack-McKendrick solution to correctly predict the epidemic size as it did in the original undirected graph? No. (d) A directed graph obtained by independently specifying an in-degree distribution (here Poisson) and an out-degree distribution (here fairly heterogeneous). This corresponds to a situation where all individuals have similar risk of infection, but allowing for superspreading events. Proofs of mapping (or lack thereof) to the Kermack-McKendrick solution are available in the Appendix. . 3. (left) Impact of heterogeneity and correlations on final epidemic size. We compare different case-studies to the Kermack-McKendrick solution to illustrate the importance of heterogeneity and correlations. Importantly, we show that increasing correlations always lead to lower final epidemic size, and that their effect is larger for higher heterogeneity in outdegree. (right) We compare our multitype directed Poisson random graph to numerical integrations of the model of Ref.[30] and again to the Kermack-McKendrick solution. This comparison showcases the generality of our approach and illustrates how a mixture of Poisson processes tend to not deviate significantly from the mass-action prediction.",
