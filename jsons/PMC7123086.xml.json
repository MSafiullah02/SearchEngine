This increase has been attributed to several contributing factors, the most prominent being the accelerated movements of humans and animals due to increased globalization and international trade, the climatic changes, and the larger and larger populations kept together in animal husbandry and breeding. Some of these diseases, termed transboundary animal diseases (TADs), such as foot-and-mouth disease and classical swine fever, have a high capacity to spread very rapidly over countries and borders, having a devastating impact on animal productivity and trade, as well as causing other losses in the animal husbandries and in wildlife. Other diseases, such as anthrax, bovine tuberculosis, and rabies, have more endemic character, establishing themselves in limited areas and showing slower tendency of spread. Considering their importance, many of these infectious diseases are listed by the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) as notifiable animal diseases, collectively referred to as OIE-listed diseases. The OIE is also determining and updating the international animal disease status on a regular basis. The current OIE-listed diseases and the latest disease status reports are available at the OIE website (www.oie.int).",

Direct detection and identification means that the infectious agents and/or their components, such as nucleic acids or proteins, are detected in the collected samples. Commonly used classical diagnostic methods for direct detection include identification of microorganisms by culture techniques and immunofluorescence, and the most widely applied molecular diagnostic methods are the various assays of nucleic acid hybridization, e.g., polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and isothermal amplification methods, such as the loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP), among others. When running indirect diagnosis and identification, the immune responses of the host are investigated, looking for antibodies against various infectious agents, which indicate the occurrence of the infections in the hosts. In this chapter we focus on direct diagnosis, with special regard to molecular diagnostic methods, as well as some considerations regarding the interpretation, understanding, and communication of the diagnostic results.",

The greater sensitivity has been attributed to both a dilution effect of any inhibitory compounds present in the sample, since only a minor fraction of the first reaction volume is used in the second reaction, and the fact that the primer-driven reaction is run twice, using four specific primers, rather than two. An intermediate situation is obtained if one of the primers from the first reaction is retained in the second, which yields a semi-nested PCR format.",

Furthermore, it only reflects the end point of the PCR and, for this reason, doesn\u2019t allow the determination of the initial quantity of the detected material, e.g., determination of the viral load. Since it lacks specific markers for the targeted amplicon, unspecific amplification yielding similar product sizes may lead to false positive detection. Nested PCR has the further disadvantage of being prone to cross-contaminations since reaction tubes with potentially very high quantities of target DNA are opened between the two reactions. Many of these drawbacks were solved by the advent of real-time PCR [6]. With this technique, the PCR product is monitored in the course of the reaction using DNA-binding moieties that alter their fluorescence upon binding to the amplified DNA. This allows a closed tube, homogeneous assay format, which reduces the risk for cross-contamination and also removes the laborious gel electrophoresis step. In addition, the cycle number where the fluorescence reaches a defined threshold level will depend on the initial quantity of target DNA or RNA (before reverse transcription).",

            "text": "Three main approaches have been taken to monitor fluorescence alteration in real time due to the buildup of the PCR product, which can be ordered according to the level of specificity the methods provide. The simplest method is to add a fluorescent dye to the PCR mixture with the property that the fluorescence intensity changes upon DNA binding. Typical dyes are asymmetric cyanine dyes, such as SYBR green or tiazole orange, that exhibit a fluorescence increase when bound to DNA [7, 8]. These types of real-time PCR have no better specificity than gel-based PCR, rather the opposite, since no information is provided about the product length. New possibilities are given by tethering the dye to one of the PCR primers that are constructed so that incorporation of the primer into the amplicon leads to an alteration of dye fluorescence. Several chemistries have been devised to this end, for example, scorpion primers [9], LUX primers [10], and Plexor primers [11]. Although in principle not providing a better specificity in regard to spurious amplification than the pure dye approach, fluorescent primers enable multiplexing by co-adding several primer pairs, each with a distinct fluorophore. The third approach includes addition of a third fluorescently labeled oligonucleotide, located between the primers, called a probe. The probe can also be labeled with a quencher (dual-labeled probe) but not always, e.g., not for the LightUp probes [7] or in the PriProET approach [12, 13]. Prominent examples of methods based on dual-labeled probes include TaqMan [14] and molecular beacons [15].",

This technique employs a three level semi-nested PCR format that utilize Plexor [11] fluorogenic primers as a detection mechanism. Furthermore, the assay format allows a highly multiplex interrogation of the sample by using primers in two vastly different concentration regimes. Instead of, as hitherto has been the case, requiring nucleotide sequencing over the hemagglutinin and fusion protein genes of avian influenza and Newcastle disease viruses, a much faster diagnosis can be obtained by a simple PCR-based method. This method could even be implemented on field PCR instruments for rapid on-site diagnosis and thereby providing means for faster containment of disease outbreaks.",

The reaction is performed at a constant temperature in simple devices, such as water baths or heating blocks, which eliminates the need for high-end equipment and system maintenance. It can be used to test for infections in regions where resources are limited and logistic chains are impossible, but a rapid answer is needed. Isothermal amplification normally takes about an hour or less to complete, providing a fast specimen-to-result diagnosis at the point of care (POC). To make the best use of isothermal amplification, a system should ideally integrate the upstream sample preparation and the downstream detection steps and be operated by personnel without extensive training. Several platforms utilizing isothermal technology are commercially available or close to market [21].",

These have been summarized by Niemz et al. [21] and include transcription-mediated amplification (TMA) [22], helicase-dependent amplification system [23], loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) [24], and rolling-circle amplification [25]. Of those methods, LAMP has gained the greatest interest because of its high specificity, efficiency, and rapidity. By addition of a reverse transcriptase in the reaction, RNA targets can also be amplified and detected by LAMP, which is referred to as RT-LAMP. The LAMP utilizes four primers that bind to six distinct regions of the target DNA to specifically amplify a short region and is catalyzed by Bst DNA polymerase with strand-displacement activity [24]. Addition of loop primers may accelerate the reaction [26]. As of 8 February 2014, PubMed listed 990 publications with the search term \u201cloop-mediated isothermal amplification.\u201d LAMP technology has been applied for the detection of viral pathogens such as classical swine fever virus [27] and foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) [28], bacteria such as Clostridium difficile [29], and parasites such as malaria [30]. Commercial developments have progressed: a total of eight LAMP kits are approved in Japan for the detection of SARS coronavirus, Mycobacterium tuberculosis (TB), Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Legionella species, influenza A virus, H1 pdm 2009 influenza virus, H5 influenza virus, and human papilloma virus, as reviewed by Mori et al.

As the names imply, the main difference between macro- and microarrays is the number and size of spots on the support. Macroarrays typically have larger and fewer spots and have proven particularly effective for detecting smaller subsets of genes, such as genes involved in antibiotic resistance [37]. Microarrays can contain thousands, and even up to many hundred thousands, of spots with different oligonucleotide probes and have successfully been used for detection and genotyping of bacterial and viral pathogens [38, 39]. The main advantages of microarray technology are high throughput, parallelism, miniaturization, and speed. However, microarrays are still considered to be an expensive technology and usually require large amounts of nucleic acid targets. Furthermore, unless it has been completely automated, the data analysis procedure might be time-consuming, and the results can be difficult to translate into information that is clearly communicable and decision supportive.",

            "text": "Genomic partitioning refers to the methodologies used for capture and enrichment of target regions. Within these methodologies, PLP has been used repeatedly for genotyping, localization, and array-based diagnostics. The earliest version of PLP consisted of two oligonucleotide probes of 20 nt connected by a linker region of 40 nt [33]. As the probes hybridize towards the target, the construct is ligated into a circular detector that can be replicated isothermally by Phi29 polymerase [40]. The detection can then be performed through incorporation of fluorophore tagged nucleotides. The PLP concept was further expanded with the introduction of the molecular inversion probe (MIP) technology. Where PLP leaves no gap after hybridization to the target region, MIP aims at leaving a single nucleotide gap. This gap is then filled in by addition of a single type of nucleotide into the assay. This approach enables substitutions on nucleotide level to be detected using just four reactions easily set up in a normal lab environment. It also provides a possibility of highly multiplexed designs of assays [41, 42]. Building on the same principle as PLP and MIP, the connector inversion probe (CIPer) technology extends the gap up to a few hundred nucleotides. Using DNA polymerase to fill the gap generates a product that can be sequenced, revealing the content of the target region [43]. Applications of PLP methodology and its derivatives for infectious diseases in animals include detection of all hemagglutinin and neuraminidase subtypes of AIV [44], as well as multiplex detection of FMDV, swine vesicular disease virus (SVDV), and vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) [45]. In addition, by designing different probes for the genomic and replicative form of the virus, it is possible to not only detect a virus but also localize it in relation to the host cells and perform semiquantitative analysis of the amount of replicative viruses, as demonstrated with porcine circovirus type 2 [46].",

Two sets of antibodies are designed: one targets the protein/s of interest and the other target the first set. The antibodies in the second set carry short oligonucleotide strands that can hybridize with special connector oligonucleotides and thereby enable the formation of circular DNA constructs. These are amplified and detected by PCR and fluorescent probes. The methodology combines dual antibody specificity with the signal amplification power of DNA amplification to produce a versatile and sensitive method for detection of very low amounts of targets. It also enables in situ localization studies of protein targets within cells [47]. Furthermore, PLA requires little to no sample preparation, making it ideally suitable for screening of massive amounts of samples, and can be used with a solid support to capture antigens for detection, similar to ELISA. The use of a solid support may also facilitate the removal of contaminants from the sample, thereby enabling PCR-based detection without the problem of inhibition. By combining the solid-support approach with RT-PCR detection, great sensitivity was demonstrated in a study of avian influenza virus [48]. Other applications of PLA technology include detection of several viruses, among them FMDV, with detection levels close to those of RT-PCR and 100-fold more sensitive than ELISA [49], as well as localization of influenza virus proteins within cells [50].",

These integrated systems with use in molecular diagnostics are more commonly known as biochip or lab-on-a-chip (LOC) devices. Since they usually consist of fluid channels and sensing chambers with dimensions of a few to hundreds of microns, very small amounts of sample can be analyzed, requiring only low consumption of reagents. The use of materials that can be easily functionalized, such as glass and plastic, allows the inner surfaces to be coated with different capture and sensing agents, e.g., antibodies and nucleic acids.

However, regardless of amplification method, it is first necessary to concentrate and lyse the sample material to extract and purify the nucleic acid. As described in the review by Heo et al. [57], a variety of alternative solutions have been developed to perform these sequential steps on a microfluidic chip. Popular strategies for sample concentration include magnetic beads [58] and dielectrophoresis [59]. The lysis of enriched samples can then be achieved by various methods, such as thermal energy, optothermal energy, mechanical force, and chemicals [60]. For the purification of extracted nucleic acid, packed silica beads, microfabricated structures, and magnetic beads have all proved to be useful solutions [61]. After amplification, the detection of products is most commonly performed with fluorescence or electrochemical methods, which easily can be miniaturized. A classification into three categories was suggested for microfluidic chips that use amplification-based detection by Mairhofer et al. [52]. These categories included microfluidic chips with (1) a stationary chamber as nano-/picoliter reservoir for conventional thermocycling, (2) a continuous flow where the sample is moved between individual temperature zones at different locations for cycling, and (3) a droplet-based system where each amplicon is individually amplified within a water-in-oil droplet. Examples of fully implemented amplification-based systems include devices for detection of different viruses, such as dengue virus and enteroviruses [62], as well as various bacteria, most notably Bacillus anthracis [63, 64].",

This has contributed to the development of innovative assays that provide rapid detection of infectious agents with improved sensitivity and limit of detection (LOD) [65]. Because of the small scale, nanotechnology can also be used to create high-density arrays of sensors for high-throughput detection without increased sample requirements. Moreover, the use of sensitive nanoscale sensors has the potential to eliminate the need for sample preparation and target amplification, making it possible to construct assays for direct detection in opaque media, like blood and milk [51].

These nanomaterials include noble metal nanoparticles, nanobarcodes, quantum dots, and magnetic nanoparticles [68\u201371]. Nanowires and nanotubes can also be coated with biological recognition elements to be used as nanosensors, and binding events are measured as a change in their electrical conductance [72]. Another example is silicon-based cantilever sensors functionalized with biomolecules such as DNA for target recognition.

Among them, PCR has been the most commonly used technology. When considering the development of new technologies, a general trend can be observed towards robust and affordable automatic systems that also integrate sample preparation steps for rapid and highly sensitive multiplex detection of an easily enlarged panel of pathogens, both bacterial and viral. Although few, if any, of the novel systems have successfully incorporated all of these properties, they still represent important technological advancements towards more sensitive and efficient detection. Even so, only a limited number have so far been developed into commercial diagnostic kits, and only a few molecular tests are offered by veterinary diagnostic laboratories. The full potential and impact of molecular diagnosis is therefore yet to be realized. A possible explanation may be that most new published assays are only analytical validated and not properly evaluated in accordance with the appropriate criteria for field validation. New molecular tests might also not comply with current accreditation standards.",

A \u201cPCR positive result\u201d by itself, without analyzing the complex scenario, can be unreliable, even misleading, and may cause serious problems for the veterinary and human medical health authorities during implementation of eradication programs. To avoid such problems and to provide a reliable diagnosis, it is important to obtain a complete medical understanding of the disease scenario. Reliable diagnoses can be reached, of course, even on the basis of single PCR assays, if they are raising the right questions and the results are professionally communicated. On the other hand, there are many cases of infectious diseases where the diagnosis is more reliable if a range of various methods, both direct and indirect approaches, are applied simultaneously. It should therefore be emphasized that in certain cases, the simultaneous application of novel molecular diagnostic methods and classical approaches, such as isolation by culturing, is required for a fully reliable diagnosis.",
