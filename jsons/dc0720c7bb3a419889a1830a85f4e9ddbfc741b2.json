One remarkable statistic is around the continually changing demographic of new consumers and the increase in social media penetration reach. For example, while in 2018 the Pew Research Centre [2] reported that most Americans continue to get news on social media, even though they may have concerns about its accuracy. Numerous surveys have been undertaken to capture the online behavior of news consumers worldwide, and the trend seems to be that social media platforms are highly influential when it comes to acquiring news stories, for the majority of people. In a large-scale study conducted in 2019 by Ofcom [3] , the UK governments regular for the communications services that are used by the public, it was shown that Half of the adults in the UK now use social media to keep up with the latest news\". Furthermore, governments and major centers for disease control, including the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), are relying on social networks as a mean for managing the evolving pandemic by regularly disseminating guidance and updates and by providing emergency responses.",

This led the United Nations to warn against a proliferation of false information about the virus and the emergence of the COVID-19 infodemic, according to WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus at the Munich Security Conference on Feb 15, 2020 [4] . Moreover, various researchers and news outlets [5] at a time when people needed to focus during the outbreak on how to do the right thing in order to control the disease and mitigate its impact (e.g. virus does not infect children, virus dies in temperature above 27 degrees, combination of diet offering cures and immunity for the virus, cure discovery). Cyberattacks also flourished during the outbreak [9]. Videos, photos and posts in different languages exploited the COVID-19 context in order to redirect the general public to shady websites and inadvertently install spyware. Some cybersecurity firms claimed that 3-8% of the newly registered COVID-19 related sites are suspicious, while others phishing messages about potential cures lead to the installation of malware.",

This became a priority in order to ensure that people who are in lockdown would receive the appropriate information in order to do the appropriate thing, control the disease and mitigate its impact. Although social networks platforms have plans for mitigating and banning harmful content, it is apparent that they themselves were not well prepared and needed an emergency plan in order to respond to COVID-19 infodemic. In fact, most platforms are now filtering and banning users who are identified as sources of verified misinformation. However, this has led at times to more misinformation and at other times to accounts being unfairly removed as social media platforms do not have the capability of dealing with a huge amount of misleading and unverified data. The main focus was on advertisement and offering personalized services to both industries and people while analyzing human behavior and preference. Moreover, in most cases they used machine learning and artificial intelligence tools resulting in a lot of false positives. Although there are many various intelligent approaches in the literature tackling the identification of credible content in social media, the topic was not of high priority for the research and industrial communities. In fact, there was no justification for investing in this research direction.",

The analysis of the unique users' profiles, metadata and context of the tweets allowed us to deduce various important findings and insights while providing guidance for potential solutions. To the best of our knowledge, except Li et al.

The initial results indicate that around 16.1% of the tweets (i.e. 160K Tweets, 2.1M Interactions and 5.6B Reach) are exploiting COVID-19 contexts for advertisement, redirecting users to out of scope topics or even maliciously misleading the community. A further ontology-based analysis on the context and users' meta-data confirms that only 3.5% of the unique users initiating the tweets have medical profile while 2.8% are virus specialists. Accordingly, at least of 93.7% of the COVID-related tweets (i.e. 800K Tweets, 17M Interactions and 30B reach) may be transmitting misleading or unverified medical information. On the other hand and in order to highlight the importance of non-medical users in spreading important information in such situation, a deeper analysis was performed to identify unique users with key specialties. Results reaffirmed our initial findings and show that users with context-relevant occupations such as doctor, writer, reporter, journalist, editor and governor do not even constitute 1% of the total reach count (i.e. 300M out of 37B). Accordingly, these insights illustrated the need to identify relevant influencers in specific contexts and seek their help in order to disseminate verified and reliable information. Finally, it is important to note that the infodemic that is impacting social media including Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, etc. is by order of magnitude bigger [15] .

The system systematically fetched approximately a million tweets from Twitter along with their corresponding users' profiles. A descriptive analysis report was then generated by aggregating the collected records. In order to gain deeper insight into the collected data, we developed five different ontology relationships. The ontology rules allowed the system to analyze the content and consequently build the targeted aggregations. Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques were used in order to classify the tweets and the users based on the above analysis.

As we processed around 109.3K hashtags from the one million random unique For instance, regardless of the context of the tweet, a hashtag that matches or partially contains #COVID or #CORONA is classified as CORONA since it is explicitly related to the Corona virus, while other hashtags like #China, #US or #Italy are classified as NON-CORONA since they are not directly related to the Corona virus. Figure 2 shows the comparison between the occurrences of the two classes (CORONA and NON-CORONA) in the tweets. It can be noted that 53.5% of the tweets (582.9K Tweets) represent tweets that are explicitly related to the Corona virus based on the hashtag, while 46.5% (506.2K Tweets) represent tweets that are not explicitly related to the Corona virus and belong to the NON-CORONA classification based on the hashtags. It should be noted that since some tweets contain hashtags from both classes, the total number of the classified classes does not reflect the number of unique tweets but rather the count of tweets. This explains the fact that the number of tweets per each class does not add up to one million (same applies to Figure 4) . Figure 3 displays the top used hashtags from the 109.3K ones sorted by the total count of occurrences in all tweets. The TreeMap visualization chart has three dimensions to display. The position (from left to right), the box size (bigger to smaller), and the color opacity(100% to 1%). All dimensions are displayed based on the number of total occurrences of each hashtag in the entire tweets dataset. It should be also mentioned that the displayed hashtags have different dialogs and formats. For example, Covid19, COVID19, and covid19 were counted as separate hashtags in order to measure the different usage for later text analysis searches. Figure 4 shows the total Interactions and Reach counts of each class of hashtags (CORONA and NON-CORONA) using a stacked column chart. It is interesting to notice that the number of Interactions and Reach level covered by the COVID hashtags on just a small set of users compared to the actual twitter size. The number of Interactions reflects the total Interactions (i.e. retweets and favorites) of all the unique tweets where the classified hashtags were used. The total Reach displays the possible Reach counts of the mentioned unique tweets based on their users' followers count. Again, both Reach and Interactions summations of the two classes do not sum up to the total Reach and Interactions specified in the header. We notice that the total number of Reach counts of the two classes is 36.6B out of 36.7B (a difference of 86,000,000 possible Reach), which indicates that more than 80% of the users performed the discovered Unique Tweets.",

Some of the non-related ones were using the trend hashtags to advertise for products and other topics, and others were malicious intended to mislead the trend into different subjects. Figure 6 shows the total Interaction and Reach counts of each tweet in each classified category. In addition to the details mentioned in the description of Figure 5 , it is important to highlight the large effect of the 16.1% tweets in terms of Interactions and Reach counts, which recorded around 2M and 5B respectively. It is very important to mention that those counts are subject to increase with time, hence enlarging the misleading ratios. Moreover, the misleading negative effect is much worse in real life context where billions of Reach counts may occur and vary from a community to another. In this context, additional research need to take place in order to identify the final destination of these tweets in order to take the needed actions for immediate remediation.",

We built an ontology of experts based on several dictionaries. The results of the ontology-based classification allowed us to study the profile of the 288K tweeters and identify 510 occupations belonging to the COVID tweet initiators. In this regard, we extracted very important insights about the credibility of tweets' initiators who might be eligible for broadcasting relevant messages in such a critical period. Figure 7 aims at showing the participation of users that have medical backgrounds in the overall conversations in order to measure their effect based on their corresponding Interactions and Reach counts. It is clear that only 29.1K Tweets (i.e. 3.5% of the COVID related tweets) were initiated by tweeters that have medical profiles, while the other 96.4% of the tweets were initiated by tweeters that do not have medical profiles or expertise. Likewise, Figure 8 measures the different Interaction and Reach counts for the tweeters having virus specialty backgrounds. It also shows that only 2.8% of the COVID related tweets were initiated by specialists, while the remaining 97.2% were initiated by other tweeters' profiles. Usually, a specialty profile could be inherited from a medical profile, but not the opposite. We can depict from both Figures 7 and 8 that the total Interactions and Reach counts of tweets initiated by non-specialists tweeters are around 18M and 31B respectively, which reflect 38.6 and 303 times more than the tweets initiated by specialists in the field respectively. This might be very critical since it reflects the extent of the unintentional or intentional mislead ratios who may lead to potentially spreading unverified and non-credible medical information and guidelines for defeating COVID-19.",

Governors, mayors, editors, writers and journalists are obvious examples of tweeters who should be on the list of occupations other than medically related who should be encouraged to interact and engage in such critical times. Indeed, the results of the COVID tweeters occupational analysis and classification based on their Tweet, Reach and Interactions counts support our hypothesis and findings. The list of credible tweeters could be expanded to include public figures such as actors and artists. Figure 9 presents three wordles that rearrange these occupations into a visual pattern broken down per Tweet, Reach and Interactions counts. The font size per occupation reflects its frequency while Figure  10 shows the top 18 occupations for the COVID tweeters' occupations initiating related unique tweets broken down per Tweet, Interactions and Reach. The main objective is to assess the impact of each group of tweeters and study their impact and influence rate in terms of Interactions and Reach. Clearly, both figures illustrate visually and numerically that the correlation between the number of Tweet, Interactions and Reach counts is not linear. In other words, the total Reach count of tweets initiated by the group of tweeters having Arts profiles and backgrounds are much higher than the total Reach of tweets initiated by the group of users having Doctor profiles and backgrounds, regardless of the number of uniquely initiated tweets by both groups. Furthermore, the correlation between the Tweet and Interactions counts is also not linear but logical. For instance, relevant occupations such as writers and journalists achieve high Interactions level, while non-related ones such as engineers and retired are getting low counts. Moreover, numerical results illustrate that context-related occupations such as doctors, writers, reporters, journalists, editors and governors do not even constitute 1% of the total Reach counts, i.e. a total of around 300M out of 30B Reach counts. To further highlight the problem, these 1% tweeters are supposed to be the only ones allowed to interact with people during such a critical situation. In this regard, two main implications can be reached from the presented results. First, accurate techniques are needed in order to verify the authenticity of the reported occupations based on historical and real-time means. Second, detection approaches need to be elaborated for identifying influencers relevant within specific contexts and situations.",

In this regard, various researchers tackled approached for detecting spams and misleading information in social networks based on users' meta-data, texts and contexts [18] - [33] . However, these approaches did not consider critical and crisis times where high accuracy and time efficiency factors have major impact on overall solutions. Even major social network platforms have confirmed that applying current AI techniques without human interventions may lead to unfairness by wrongly banning valid accounts and interactions. Accordingly, additional research efforts have to investigate efficient and accurate human-less techniques and methodologies for better understanding the origin of misinformation while identifying both disruptive contexts and users. \u2022 Although information broadcasts are not initiated by medical experts or officials, they may be at times essential and useful. Accordingly, allowing only communications by specific categories may be counterproductive as it could block legitimate and helpful information. In this regard, several approaches have addressed reputation and credibility based on user-centered and content-based analysis [34] - [46] . However, to the best of our knowledge, none of these approaches have classified and managed posts and accounts based on their verified roles, occupations and specialities. Consequently, mechanisms should be proposed in order to efficiently and accurately allow postings based on the aforementioned criteria, while at the same time considering credibility, historical engagement, insights and influence rate in related contexts and events. Moreover, there is a need at this time to develop systems that have efficient and highly accurate trust and credibility preserving models to be opportunistically adopted during crisis periods. Approaches relying on Blockchain and operating in highly distributed environments may be good options for potential efficient solutions regardless of their high cost. \u2022 Results show that the Reach level of professional COVID-19 context-relevant roles and occupations (e.g. doctors, editors, governors) is very low (i.e. only 1% of total Reach). Accordingly, extensive effort should be put to elaborate methodologies and recommendation systems for efficiently recognizing credible and convincing influencers in specific events/locations/communities (e.g. based on profile, insights, historical engagement) for spreading the relevant and cited information provided by trusted scientists and experts at large scale, in the right place and to the right people. In this context, researchers may benefit from the rich literature that targets identifying influencers based on selected events in order to build relevant approaches [47] - [54] . \u2022 Current raised infodemic shed the light on the urgent need to elaborate methodologies and techniques to be embedded in the social network platforms for systematically adopting emergency and crisis mode management strategies and responding to the situation dangers. This also includes developing code of conduct, standards and regulations to abide by during crisis periods, which may differ from the policies applied within regular terms.",

Accordingly, the UN is step-ping up their communications efforts through global cooperation and viral acts of humanity. Although some are promoting the Chinese model of censored contagion, the solution is for health authorities, governments and social network stakeholders to formulate regular responses to the infodemic using a strategy of active engagement and communication with those who are spreading inaccurate stories in order to gain a deeper understanding of how infodemic spread. Governments should set-up official units mandated to combat the spread of inaccurate and unsubstantiated news. For example, the UK established a rapid response unit within the Cabinet Office. The Unit will work with social media firms in order to filter fake news and harmful content. \u2022 The most powerful solution to tackle this, or any future infodemic, lies with the consumers themselves. Taking personal responsibility of the role that each person plays when they receive, read, edit, comment and then forward a piece of information that originates on a social media platform is, arguably, the most impactful intervention to debunk the myths and falsehoods that are generated on an hourly basis.

However, most of the approaches extend their techniques by exploiting users profile and their relations [30] . Sedhai et al. [18] proposed a semi-supervised technique for spam detection, in which they proposed multiple detectors that investigate tweets' contents to classify maliciousness. Similarly, Alghamdi et al. [19] exploited a set of OSNs object and URL features for the same purpose. Such features include information related to users profile, and URL related features including hosts and domains. Similarly to the previous approach, Lee at al. [26] deployed a real-time malicious URL detector by exploiting URL redundancy driven by the limitation posed on the attackers' resources. Guille et al. [25] proposed another approach that takes advantage of the URL used by the users in their tweets to spot malicious intents. A multi-feature analysis like unique mentions, trends, hyperlinks, and tweets ratio has been employed by Amleshwaram et al. [20] to distinguish spam accounts in a supervised manner. Moreover, Benevenuto et al. in [21] aimed to classify users between promoters, spammer and legitimated from their videos. By manually selecting different users and learning their behaviors, authors were able to employ a supervised machine learning technique capable of classifying malicious users with a relatively small margin error. Kuhn et al. [22] described spamming strategies techniques of more than 570 million tweets. SHEN et al. [28] deployed another approach that depends on the tweets contents to extract users behaviors and supply them to a supervised classifier. However, supervised and semi-supervised techniques cannot classify data by discovering features on their own, which requires manual classification in the initial stages. Such involvement requires the intervention of human in which by its nature prone to errors, thus reducing the accuracy of the results.

The first set of approaches focused on the content to assign reputation using machine learning techniques [47] , [58] , [59] , while the second set relied on the user and its relation described as nodes in a graph model [35] , [48] , [58] .

On the other hand, authors in [63] analyzed the relationships between users in order to rank them by their influence relationships. [64] analyzed the user's social activity during a specific event. Anger, Isabel &amp and Kittl, Christian [65] determined a grounded approach to measure the individual's influence or potential social networking ratio (SNP) using users and tweets metadata to find the top 10 Twitter users in Austria. Bakshy, Eytan et. al [66] calculated the user influence rate per event using diffusion trees and cascading methods by selecting only events that have URLs. Then, they applied diffusion algorithms on the shared URLs to measure the reach of the initial tweets. M. Anjaria and R. M. R.

The empirical analysis of 1 million COVID-19-related tweets belonging to 288K unique users illustrated the severe impact of misleading people and spreading unreliable information. Inferred insights showed that (1) the potential reachability of the 16.1% tweets that misled users by redirecting them to out of scope and/or malicious content is 5.6 billion, and (2) a minimum of 93.7% of the remaining within-context 83.9% tweets (i.e. with around 17M Interactions and 30B Reach counts) were initiated by users with non-reliable medical and/or relevant speciality profiles, and consequently might be disseminating misleading noncredible medical information. Moreover, different insights highlighted the low reachability (i.e. 1% of the total Reach counts, which is equivalent 300M out of 30B) of the unique users with key context-relevant specialties and occupations such as doctor, writer, reporter, journalist, editor and governor. The results shed the light on the importance of identifying nonmedical key influencers for assisting in spreading legitimate information relevant in such situations. Finally, the paper elaborated on few computing and non-computing implications as well as future research directions to highlight the potential solutions and future work in such a promising field.",
