These clades categorize into the previously reported S, G as well as a new unclassified subtype. A detailed analysis of gene encoding the Spike (S) protein in the strains across the globe shows non-synonymous mutations on 54 amino acid residues. Among these, we pinpoint 4 novel mutations in the region that interacts with human ACE2 receptor (RBD). Further in silico molecular docking analyses suggest that these RBD mutations could alter the binding affinity of S-protein with ACE2 that may lead to changes in SARS-CoV-2 infectivity. Strikingly, one of these RBD mutations (S438F) is unique to a subset within the R4 clade suggesting intrinsic S-protein variations in strains currently circulating in India. Together, our findings reveal a unique pattern of SARS-CoV-2 evolution that may alert vaccine and therapeutic development.",

Our analysis reveals that there are at least 5 distinct clades of strains circulating in India. In addition, the global strains appear to have acquired 54 mutations that are non-synonymous in the gene encoding S-protein among which 4 important mutations are on the RBD that may have direct implications on the infectivity of SARS-CoV-2.

Although no changes were evident in the interactions during conservative substitution of V367F (Figure 4c, Supplementary Figure 1a) , the binding affinity towards ACE2 receptor decreased (Kd = 1.4E-09) when compared to the wild type protein complex (Kd = 4.3E-10). The amino acid substitution that is unique to Indian strains, S438F is associated with alterations in hydrogen bonding with D442. Also, a new hydrogen bond with N437 is formed in the mutant (Figure 4d, Supplementary Figure 1b) . These structural alterations are consistent with the reduced binding affinity observed in S438F mutant (Kd = 1.2E-09). The amino acid mutation at position 476, G to S also made some changes to its interacting residues. In wild type protein complex, G476 is forming two hydrogen bonds with T478 while this interaction is abolished in the mutant. Also, the single hydrogen bond interaction with Q474 in the wild type was replaced to double bond in mutant (Figure 4e, Supplementary Figure 1c) ",

            "text": "://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus). This increased transmission was recently correlated with the high mutation frequency of SARS-CoV-2 strains (Yin, C. 2020). The single stranded RNA genome of COVID-19 has 2,9891 nucleotides, possesses 14 ORFs encoding 29 proteins which include four structural proteins: Envelope (E), Membrane (M), Nucleocapsid (N) and Spike (S) proteins, 9 accessory proteins and 16 non-structural proteins (Wu, A. et al. 2020, Gordon et al. 2020). A recent study shows that mutations in the S-protein that mediates viral entry can modulate viral pathogenesis (Shang et al., 2020). The S-protein is functionally bipartite with a proximal S1 segment that binds the host angiotensin-converting enzyme2 (ACE2) receptor (Wang et al., 2020) and a distal S2 region helps in virus-host cell fusion separated by S1-S2 linker containing protease cleavage sites. S1 subunit consists of a signal peptide (SP) followed by the N-terminal domain of unknown function and the C-terminal domain consisting of receptor binding domain (RBD) and a receptor binding motif (RBM) within. S2 subunit comprises a fusion peptide (FP), heptad repeats (HR1&HR2), transmembrane domain (TM) and a short cytoplasmic domain (CP). This viral entry process requires the S protein priming, which is facilitated by TMPRSS2, a serine protease that is produced by the host cell (Hoffmann et al., 2020). Together, these features make S-protein the primary target for the development of antibodies, entry inhibitors and vaccines (Du, L. et al.,2009; Wang, Q. et al.,2016). Also, SNPs identified on S-gene may have an important role in its host range and pathogenicity (Yin, C. 2020). Furthermore, identifying a complete set of variations in S-protein of SARS-CoV-2 and their impact on human ACE2 affinity is much needed for the development of therapeutic countermeasures. Thus, studying S-protein and their evolution can enhance our understanding of host receptor affinity variations and virulence levels.",

Maximum likelihood phylogenetic analysis of these strains provides distinct evolutionary features. However, country specific, monophyletic pattern was not observed in the global distribution of SARS-CoV-2 strains (Figure 1).Within this global distribution, we identify five major clades-R1, R2, R3, R4 and R5 for strains circulating in India(Figure 1). Among these, R1, R3, R4 and R5 belong to previously reported S and G global subtypes whereas R2 stands out as a previously uncharacterized, unique cluster. In-depth phylogenetic analysis shows peculiar features for Indian clades. Clade R1 consists of only one strain from Kerala that belongs to S-subtype and is consistent with epidemiological travel history from Wuhan, China. In addition, R1 defines 5 unique non-synonymous mutations in the orf1ab (I476V, P2079L, Q5538Z), orf8 (L84S) and S gene (A930V). Clade R2 does not belong to any known S, V or G subtypes and possess two non-synonymous substitutions in orf1ab (V378I, L3606F) and one synonymous mutation on N gene (L139L). Clade R3, R4 and R5 belong to G subtype and show clear epidemiological link to Italy but differ in their mutational profile. While two Indian strains in R3 contain non-synonymous substitutions in the M-gene (D3G) and in the orf1ab (Z6697W), R4 possesses nonsynonymous mutation in orf1ab (S1515F) with an additional mutation in the RBD region of S-protein (S438F) in 15% of the strains(Figure 1). Clade R5 has two non-synonymous substitutions in the N gene (R203K, G204R). Our analysis is currently limited to only 30 genomes from India; hence require further investigation using more genomes. Nevertheless, these findings reveal that along with global strains unique subtypes of SARS-CoV-2 strains are currently circulating in India.",

The mutated residues are highlighted in light blue color and substitutions are marked below in green.Interestingly, we found four mutations in the linker region separating S1 and S2 segments of S-protein viz., L611F, D614G, Q675H and A706V. Among these, D614G which corresponds to Gsubtypes of SARS-CoV-2 was found to be the most abundant mutation globally as well as in Indian subcontinent, accounting for 52.26% (1,544) strains analyzed. This mutation is located outside RBD and near to the furin cleavage site in the S1-S2 junction. The exact functional impact of this mutation remains unclear. Although SARS-CoV-2 possesses a unique furin/ TMPRSS2 cleavage sites, mutations are not observed in this region(Figure 2).Several mutations were found in the S2 region. S2 region consists of proximal fusion peptide (FP) followed by Heptad Repeat-1 ad 2 (HR1 and HR2), transmembrane domain (TM) and short distal cytoplasmic tail (CT)(Figure 2). FP along with HR1 and HR2 plays a significant role in the fusion between the virus and target cell membranes(Liu, Shuwen, et al., 2004;Tripet, Brian, et al., 2004). FP is one of the highly conserved regions in S-protein(Cascella, Marco et al., 2020). We found five mutations in the Fusion peptide region-A831V, D839Y, A845S, A846V and A852V. In addition, weidentified five mutated positions (D936Y/D936H, S939F, S940F/S940T, T941A, S943P) in the HR1 domain and only one in HR2 (D1163G). The functional implications of these mutations in regulating SARS-CoV-2-host cell fusion need to be determined.",

The energy minimization of the modeled structure was done by YASARA server (Krieger, E. et al., 2002), and each modeled structure was superimposed with template structure and calculated the RMSD value in Pymol(Delano, W.

HADDOCK 2.4 webserver (De Vries et al., 2010) was used for docking of the wild and mutated spike proteins against Human ACE2 protein (PDB ID: 6LZG_A), and the binding affinity of the docked structures was calculated using PRODIGY webserver (Xue, Li C., et al., 2016).",
