Although on the surface the COVID-19 pandemic seemed to be unrelated to orthopaedic departments since these patients and surgeons do not face infectious disease on a routine basis, widespread fear gave way to many poorly considered decisions, including the decision of many prosthesis companies to stop their services immediately, even before any official statements from the MoH or the hospitals were released to cease elective surgeries.",

Two days after this letter, the privatesector hospitals obtained permission to restart their elective surgeries, perhaps due to their lobbying with the MoH. However, all governmental health-care centers discontinued all of their elective orthopaedic surgeries, and only trauma patients were seen. In the governmental sector, no minor elective surgeries, even those that would include a hospitalization of <24 hours (e.g., removal of plates and implants or carpal tunnel release), were performed. In the private sectors, each institution made its own decision of whether or not to perform specific elective surgical procedures. Interestingly, the spread of the virus during March 2020 coincided with the Iranian New Year holiday known as Nowruz, during which the usual elective surgeries that are performed in private and governmental sectors are postponed. Because of mass fear and concern regarding the spread of COVID-19, and the fact that some orthopaedic surgeons contracted the virus, most private-sector hospitals paused their elective surgeries for a few weeks before completely stopping all of their surgeries at 1 month after the first official reports of COVID-19 in Iran. Subsequently, all of the empty hospital beds were designated for the treatment of patients with COVID-19. The number of trauma cases in Iran is much higher than that of other regions in the world, and all orthopaedic surgery procedures that are related to trauma are still being performed. However, with the practice of self-quarantining in Iran, the number of traffic accidents has decreased because fewer people are commuting, and this has decreased the number of trauma-related surgeries.",

However, with the passing of time and the announcement from the MoH, the number of referrals to orthopaedic clinics decreased substantially, mainly due to mass fear in the community. Subsequently, stations were designated to check for fever in patients and their escorts in all clinics. With regard to personal protective equipment (PPE), physicians were given N95 masks (although not in every center in the country), and latex gloves and disinfectants were placed in all of the clinics. Patients were advised to buy protective gloves and masks for themselves, which caused a lack of availability. Because no official ground rules or instruction were given to private orthopaedic clinics by the MoH, they were free to continue treating patients. Almost 3 weeks after the first case of COVID-19, almost all physicians were convinced to close their clinics, and some started seeing patients online with the use of special applications and through social media, although not enough infrastructure exists to facilitate such services. More importantly, the number of orthopaedic patients who benefited from this type of consultation was very few.",

The Iranian Ministry of Communication provided some limited free use of the internet to the public, which covered the need for internet to some extent. Many orthopaedic personalities in the country also aided in preparing brochures and video clips to invite people to stay in their homes and self-quarantine. With the unexpected pause of all surgeries and routine activities, orthopaedists were confronted with a unique situation. Orthopaedic residents became demoralized as they became more idle because of the cancellation of classes and hospital grand rounds; however, the continuity of trauma surgeries and seeing patients in the emergency department maintained a level of practical education. From another point of view, the lack of a protocol from the MoH for the care of trauma patients with regard to COVID-19 created a concern for health-care providers.",

PPE for orthopaedic residents includes normal surgical masks and does not differ from that of other personnel. The main policy for general hospitals with many different departments (including orthopaedic departments/wards) was to ensure the longest distance possible between wards that were designated for COVID-19 patients and wards that were unrelated to COVID-19, and orthopaedic residents are only obligated to respond to consults from the non-COVID-19 wards.",

Online courses in the orthopaedic departments, which were mainly done with the use of webinars, are held for 2 main reasons: (1) to maintain orthopaedic education for residents and undergraduate students, and (2) to create a platform to increase awareness and to exchange up-to-date information regarding COVID-19.
