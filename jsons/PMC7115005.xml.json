Histologically the lining of the cyst contains only epithelium [2]. Panoramic radiographs are not able to show these cysts even if they are located on the dentomaxillofacial region. Epidermoid cyst usually appears as a hypoattenuated well-circumscribed cystic mass with near cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) density on computed tomography (CT) images and does not enhance after the administration of the contrast material [3]. This non-tender and dome-shaped cyst has low signal intensity on T1-W images while high signal intensity in T2-W images with focal low signal intensity debris [4]. Cyst signal intensity in MRI is varying broadly according to the composition of the cyst, but most of the intracranial epidermoid cysts have low signal intensity on T1-W images and high or equal signal on T2-W images when compared the cerebral cortex [5]. While DWI demonstrates high signal intensity, ADC maps have iso- or slightly hyperintense relative to the brain tissue [6]. Seven percent of epidermoid cyst is seen in head and neck region, whereas in oral cavity they account for only 1.6% [7].",

Arachnoid cysts are usually asymptomatic and found incidentally on CT or MR images. It was determined as a CSF-like density mass in CT scans with a 0\u201320 Hounsfield unit (HU) attenuation values. They can cause the remodeling of the bony wall in calvaria, may compress the adjacent brain tissue, and do not enhance after the contrast material [9, 10]. It is important to differentiate the arachnoid and epidermoid cysts; both have the same signal intensity in conventional MR sequences; DWI is used in this situation, showing characteristic high signal for ECs compared with low signal for arachnoid cysts with very high diffusivity [6, 10] (Figs. 11.1 and 11.2).\n\n",

Obstruction of the pharyngeal bursa that communicates the roof of the nasopharynx and notochord causes the development of the Thornwald cyst [12] and does not involve the adjacent bony structures. This cyst appears as a hyperintense area on both T1- and T2-W images due to the high proteinaceous content concentration [12, 13]. If the cyst contains less protein, it will appear as hypo- or isointense on T1-W and hyperintense on T2-W images. After the gadolinium injection, the cyst content will not enhance [12]. Most of the patients are asymptomatic and found incidentally on images or while performing nasal endoscopic examination. CT images show low-attenuation soft tissue mass in the high posterior midline nasopharynx, and image characteristics are similar to CSF [12, 13] (Fig. 11.3).\n",

Nasopharyngeal carcinoma is classified as squamous cell carcinoma and nonkeratinizing carcinoma (subdivided this type to differentiated nonkeratinizing carcinoma and undifferentiated carcinoma subtypes) by the World Health Organization (WHO) [17]. Etiological factors of this malignancy include the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) (especially in children), genetic susceptibility and environmental carcinogens, and consumption of food (in particular salted fish) containing carcinogenic volatile nitrosamines [14]. MRI is sensitive than CT to perineural spread and for demonstrating early the bone marrow changes of infiltration (see normal bone marrow signal of the clivus), although not all bone marrow changes represent tumor extension. Signal characteristics on T1-W typically isointense to muscle, on T2-W image isointense to somewhat hyperintense to muscle fat saturation is helpful. Postcontrast sequences should be fat-saturated; prominent heterogeneous enhancement is typical. Perineural extension should be taken into consideration [18]. On CT images it is difficult to differentiate the small nasopharyngeal carcinomas from the muscles in consequent of resemblance density of the tumor with muscles [10].",

Pleomorphic adenoma is originating from the ductal epithelium of both salivary glands containing epithelial and mesenchymal components. The CT appearance of pleomorphic adenoma is well-defined mass that has parallel density to the muscle and shows mild to moderate contrast enhancement [10, 19]. This tumor represents various signal intensities in different MRI sequences such as relatively hypointense on T1-W images, isointense on proton density-weighted images, and hyperintense on T2-W images [20]. Pleomorphic adenomas have hypoechoic appearance compared with the normal parenchyma of the salivary gland on ultrasound (US). Also this tumor most commonly has lobulated shape, well-defined borders, heterogeneous echotexture, distal acoustic enhancement, and grade 0 or 1 vascularity. Peripheral vascularity is common in more than half of this tumor [21]. Ultrasound elastography shows generally heterogeneous stiff appearance, but this feature is not specific for the pleomorphic adenoma and may be seen also in a significant portion of the malignant tumor [22]. Klintworth et al. [23] defined specific elastographic findings for parotid gland tumors, and they reported that \u201cdens core\u201d sign (with a central zone of very stiff tissue with softer tissue in the vicinity) is specifically related with pleomorphic adenoma (Fig. 11.4).\n",

More males than females suffer from this tumor, and it is found bilaterally in 10% of patients [18]. Warthin\u2019s tumor has low signal intensity on T1-W images compared with the high signal intensity of the parotid gland. On T2-W images tumor is heterogeneous and variable in signal intensity [10]. On CT scans, tumor density is equivalent to soft tissue or cystic density [20]. This tumor has hypoechoic appearance on US like the pleomorphic adenoma comparing with the normal parenchyma. Characteristic sonographic features of the Warthin\u2019s tumor include generally oval shape, well-defined borders, distal acoustic enhancement, heterogeneous echotexture, and grade 2 or 3 vascularity with central or mixed perfusion. Also more than half of the tumors have cystic areas [21]. Klintworth et al.

These tumors are classified into the four World Health Organization (WHO) categories: Grade I includes pilocytic astrocytoma and subependymal giant cell astrocytoma; Grade II includes pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma, oligodendroglioma, and diffuse astrocytoma; Grade III includes anaplastic astrocytoma, anaplastic oligodendroglioma, and anaplastic pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma; and Grade IV includes glioblastoma and diffuse midline glioma [32]. Spinal cord astrocytomas peak at third and fifth decades of life with a slightly male predominance. MRI is useful to demonstrate spinal cord edema, drop metastasis, and leptomeningeal spread [33]. Low-grade astrocytomas are determined as ill-defined areas of decreased attenuation involving the white matter on CT scans [34]. Low-grade astrocytomas are best seen on MRI with multimodality images. T1-W image is isointense to hypointense compared to white matter and causes expansion of the adjacent cortex. T2/FLAIR is usually mass-like hyperintense signal. The \u201cmicrocystic changes\u201d along the lines of spread of the infiltrative astrocytoma are a unique behavior for the infiltrative astrocytoma. DWI/ADC typically has expedited diffusion, with lower ADC values suggesting a higher-grade tumor. Contrast is usually no enhancement, but small ill-defined areas of enhancement are not rare; however, when enhancement is seen, it should be considered as a warning sign for progression to a higher grade (Fig. 11.9).\n",

From these types approximately 80% of the cases occur in Grade I (benign) [24]. Incidental detection of asymptomatic meningiomas is getting higher with the advanced imaging modalities. Some of the conditions may be related with the growing tumor such as gender, hyperintensity on T2-W images, tumor size at the initial diagnosis, and tumor with no calcification [35]. On unenhanced CT, the tumor appears as hyperdense or isodense mass compared with the adjacent brain tissue and shows homogeneous enhancement after contrast material administration [19]. Spinal meningioma shows isointensity relative to the spinal cord parenchyma on T1- and T2-W images [33].

Only 15% and 25% of the hemangiomapericytomas occur in the head and neck region [39]. On CT scans, hemangiopericytomas reveal round homogeneous masses with a sharp outline and often displace the adjacent structures [40, 41]. On T1-W images tumor shows intermediate signal intensity relative to the gray matter; after the gadolinium administration, it enhances heterogeneously [24]. Contrast T1-W images shows intense enhancement and heterogeneous signal intensity. There may be a dural tail sign in Grade II tumors. On T2-W images the lesion is isointense to gray matter multiple flow voids on MRI. DWI shows an intermediate restricted diffusion.",

Osteomas originate from the cartilage and embryonal periosteum that are usually nodular or pedunculated polyp attached to the bone with a narrow stalk. It occurs almost exclusively in the head and neck region, particularly in the posterior mandible and also in paranasal sinuses especially in frontal sinuses and are most often encountered after 40 years of age [20]. Multiple osteomas which develop in the head and neck region and multiple epidermoid cysts of the skin and polyposis of the colon and rectum are the part of the Gardner syndrome [19, 20]. Histologically osteomas are divided into (1) ivory or compact osteoma, (2) spongious or trabecular osteoma, and (3) combination of the first two types [20, 42]. On MR T1-W and T2-W images, the ivory osteoma appears as a hypointense area and may be misinterpreted as air within the paranasal sinuses or nasal fossae [42]. While the CT appearance of the compact osteoma is very dense calcified, well-defined lesions, trabecular osteoma\u2019s density is changing depending on the fibrous component of the lesion [19, 42].",

Congenital cholesteatomas are derived from persistent embryologic remnants in the form of epithelial foci in the middle ear [44]. The pathogenesis of acquired cholesteatoma is explained on the invagination of the tympanic membrane, basal cell hyperplasia, epithelial in-growth through perforation, and squamous metaplasia of middle ear epithelium [43]. CT scans demonstrate the expansile nonenhancing hypodense lesions with neighboring smooth bony erosion [18]. Generally cholesteatomas have nonspecific signal intensity on basic MRI sequences, but non-echo planar diffusion-weighted imaging is more specific to diagnose these lesions and differentiate the primer and recurrent cholesteatoma. Cholesteatomas have high signal relative to the brain tissue on DWI [46, 47].",

Acute otomastoiditis presents opacification of the mastoid air cells [57, 58]. CT scans demonstrate the mastoid air cells filled with the soft tissue mass instead of the air [59]. MRI can be used for evaluating the otomastoiditis, however, with solely MRI it is difficult to diagnose the infection related to mastoid region. MRI characteristic of acute otomastoiditis are nonspecific debris within the middle ear and mastoid, possibly with several fluid levels which can be seen bright signal areas on T2-weighted images. For chronic otomastoiditis with cholesteatoma, MR signal characteristics are nonspecific; ordinarily, both T1 and T2 relaxation times are relatively long [57, 58]. Signal characteristics are mostly low signal on T1-W and high signal on T2-W images. DWI/ADC diffusion restriction may be present; mucosal contrast enhancement is present in the majority of the cases on T1-W contrast images (Fig. 11.12).\n",

Empty sella is divided into two types based on the reason: primary and secondary. Primary empty sella appears without any pathological changes in the pituitary gland, while secondary empty sella is caused by some pathologic conditions such as pituitary adenoma (radiation, drug or surgical therapy), postpartum pituitary necrosis, or lymphocytic hypophysitis [61]. Primary empty sella is asymptomatic and may be found incidentally, but secondary empty sella may be related to endocrine dysfunction, cerebrospinal fluid rhinorrhea, and visual abnormality. On CT scans an empty sella appears as a CSF or water-filled cavity density instead of normal pituitary gland tissue [62]. MRI is the modality of choice for confirming the diagnosis. On T1-W and T2-W images, empty sella shows the same signal intensity with cerebrospinal fluid [63]. Both MR images demonstrate the sella to be filled with CSF, and the infundibulum can be seen to traverse the space, thereby excluding a cystic mass. This is known as the infundibulum sign (Fig. 11.13).\n",

Because venous angiomas are infrequently symptomatic, their clinical significance remains unclear. When symptomatic, they are associated mainly with seizures or bleeding or headache or scatter pain around the area. Although cerebral angiography is the definitive study of choice, it is no longer judged necessary with uncomplicated vascular malformations. Cerebral developmental venous anomalies are usually incidentally detected and can be easily diagnosed as a linear or curvilinear focus of enhancement with contrast-enhanced CT images, and early CT findings of the VA include round, 1\u20132 cm focus enhancement [68]. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT), which is no doubt responsible for the recent increase in the number of reported cases of VAS, is yielding to the far superior imaging ability of magnetic resonance (MR) as it becomes routinely available. MR imaging is thus becoming the primary study of choice. The most characteristic feature is an enlarged draining vein, followed by increased signal on T2-weighted images and decreased signal on T1-weighted images in adjacent parenchyma. T2 imaging is more successful in showing the lesions than T1 imaging. Best options are to find it as a gradient-echo or blood oxygen level-dependent sequence on MRI (Fig. 11.15).\n",

One of them is a vestibular/ acoustic schwannoma that derives from glial-neurilemmal junction of nerve sheath, mostly vestibular division of the CN VIII. It is visible in the internal auditory meatus or cerebellopontine/pontine angle [69]. On CT scans schwannomas are usually oval or spindle in shape and have well-defined borders [70]. On contrast-enhanced CT, a schwannoma displays mottle central lucency with peripheral intensification. CT images demonstrate the tumor and neighboring bony structure relation and the erosion and destruction of the bone clearly [71]. Besides typical symptoms such as tinnitus and sensorineural hearing loss, patients also complain on headache, vertigo, facial pain, and weakness; even big lesions may often be incidental and asymptomatic findings. Large tumors may develop mass effect with cerebellar and brainstem symptoms, e.g., hydrocephalus and cranial nerve dysfunction other than CNVIII. The signal of the tumor is slightly hypo- or isointense in T1- or heterogeneously hyperintense to adjacent brain in T2-weighted images. Cystic areas show signal typical for fluid. In both modalities, most tumors show intense contrast enhancement with or without cystic degeneration and hemorrhagic areas (Fig. 11.16).\n",

[72] reported that calcified masses occur with a variation of sizes ranging from a few millimeters to several centimeters. Small-sized calculi are common and asymptomatic, but the giant-sized tonsilloliths are rare [73, 74]. Symptoms include dysphagia, recurrent sore throat, foreign body sensation, and halitosis [74]. The mechanisms of formation are still controversial. It is believed that they occurred due to repeated inflammation of the tonsillar crypts with recurrent tonsillitis. Repeated episodes of inflammation may cause cryptal fibrosis. Bacterial and epithelial debris accumulates within these crypts, and calcification occurs subsequent to the deposition of inorganic salts which derived from saliva [73, 75]. In addition, it is reported that tonsilloliths are primarily consisted of calcium hydroxyapatite/calcium carbonate and some other minerals such as magnesium, sodium, silica, potassium, copper, aluminum, iron, and ammonia radicals [72, 74, 76]. The most common cause of tonsillitis is viral infection including enteroviruses, particularly coxsackie virus, respiratory viruses (e.g., adenovirus, rhinovirus, influenza virus, coronavirus, parainfluenza virus, and respiratory syncytial virus), and viruses of the Herpesviridae family like Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), cytomegalovirus (CMV), and herpes simplex virus (HSV), while the most common bacterial pathogen is Group A \u03b2-hemolytic streptococcus in pediatric population [77].",

Fungal infection of the sinuses is classified as invasive and noninvasive due to the presence or absence of hyphae within the mucosal and other tissues of the paranasal sinuses [92] and divided into five subgroups. Aspergillosis is the most common fungal pathogen of the sinuses and usually affects the immunocompromised patients [93]. At noncontrast CT scans, aspergilloma is characterized by a hyperdense mass with occasional calcifications. This hyperattenuating lesion is usually surrounded by a hypodense mucosal thickening [94]. MR features can change due to the stage of the disease, mostly the lesions hypointensity on T1-WI and T2-WI. On T1-W image the lesion is hypointense because of the inflamed mucosal thickness and on T2-W usually appears as hyperintense peripheral inflamed mucosal thickness, and low T2 signal or signal void is due to high concentration of various metals such as iron, magnesium, and manganese concentrated by fungal organisms (Fig. 11.20).\n",

Taeniasis and cysticercosis are highly endemic in developing countries in Latin America, most parts of Asia (including China and the Indian subcontinent), Eastern Europe, and most of Africa. Whereas infection with the adult tapeworm causes intestinal taeniasis, fecal-oral contamination of the larval Taenia solium results in cysticercosis [102]. Cysticercosis in human may affect the brain, muscle, skin, liver, lung, subcutaneous tissue, and heart as well as in the oral and perioral tissues especially in the masticatory muscles where the majority die and become densely calcified [20]. Both T1- and T2-W images show hypointensive area with a null signal due to parasite itself. The nidus due to central location of the parasite can be seen in STIR images (Fig. 11.16). Extraoral conventional imaging modalities such as panoramic or cephalometric images are enough to visualize calcifications. CBCT evaluations easily reveal these calcifications. Calcified masses may be found in the region of masseter and suprahyoid muscles, tongue, buccal mucosa, or lips [20, 103] (Fig. 11.22).\n",

Myositis ossificans circumscripta occur as a result of some traumatic injury to muscle such as acute and chronic trauma, heavy muscular strain, infections, burns, neuromuscular disorders, hemophilia, tetanus, and drug abuse [105]. Masseter and sternocleidomastoid muscles are most commonly affected in the head and neck region [20]. Also it may be localized in other masticatory muscles [106, 107]. MRI appearances depend on the age of the lesion. Early lesions can be misleading before the maturation, however soft tissue may appear with edema. T1-W images show ill-defined isointense images; T2-W shows mostly edema as high signal. The signal intensity may change depending on the localization of the lesion in which central part mostly seen with heterogeneous signal intensity T1-W contrast enhancement is often present. Standard radiographs do not disclose any anomaly in the early stages of myositis ossificans. Typically, they are distant from adjacent bony structures [108]. CT scan examination is more sensitive than radiography for detecting ossification and may also show a central fatty metaplastic area [109].",

Because of congenital factors, trauma, and age-related factors, this fibrous cord starts to be ossified. Due to its close relationship with some important anatomical structures, ossification or elongation of this complex may lead some symptoms such as dysphagia and head-neck pain. Ossification of the stylohyoid ligament is a common condition which is found as an incidental finding in routine dental radiographic examination [114]. According to literature, incidence rates of stylohyoid ligament ossifications are between 2% and 30% [115]. Panoramic radiographs are routinely used in dentistry, and it allows to identify calcified stylohyoid ligament especially in asymptomatic patients. It extends forward from the mastoid region and crosses and superimposed to the ramus toward the hyoid bone. It appears as long, tapering, thin, interrupted by a jointlike junction or a straight structure [20]. Although panoramic radiography has frequently been used to show elongation or ossification of stylohyoid ligament, it also has some disadvantages such as superposition. Hence, CT and CBCT should be used for appropriate evaluation of this structure [115] (Fig. 11.24).\n",

Calcifications of tunica media of medium-sized arteries are described as M\u00f6nckeberg\u2019s medial calcinosis. The etiology is not well understood, but it is believed that glucose intolerance, age, sex, osteoporosis, or chronic renal failure is related. Medial calcinosis does not obstruct the lumina of the arteries, so tissue or organ ischemia is not seen [117]. Hence, it is mostly asymptomatic. Only it is clearly seen in three-dimensional imaging modalities and plain radiography techniques as an incidental finding. Radiographically, calcified vessels of M\u00f6nckeberg appear as a parallel pair of thin, radiopaque lines which were described as \u201ctram tracks,\u201d \u201cpipestem,\u201d or \u201ctramline.\u201d In cross section, involved vessels can view a circular or ringlike pattern [20, 118].",

The most common location for an atherosclerotic plaque lesion is at the carotid bifurcation; therefore, it may be visible in the panoramic radiograph. It may be seen as a heterogeneous radiopacity at the level of the intervertebral space between C3 and C4. They are usually multiple, unilateral or bilateral, irregular, and sharply defined from the surrounding soft tissues [20]. These plaques have an aspect mostly circular when small and mostly linear or thin rectangular when enlarged. They are usually located posterior to the angle of mandible, approximately at the inferior margin of third cervical vertebra near the hyoid bone [119].",

Acute sinusitis describes the short-term (less than 4 weeks) infection or inflammation of the mucosa. Subacute sinusitis is defined as symptoms of 4\u201312-week duration. If the inflammation persists more than 12 weeks, it is considered chronic [122, 123]. Signal characteristics depend on the affected regions of the sinuses. In acute stages, on T1-W image due to mucosal thickening, the lesion is isointense to soft tissue, but the fluid shows hypointense areas. On T2-W images both mucosal thickening and fluid can show variable hyperintensity. On contrast-enhanced images, the T1-W images show enhancement only along with the inflamed mucosa (Fig. 11.26).\n",

Because of the complex anatomy of the dentomaxillofacial region, it is difficult to visualize important anatomical structures due to the superimposition [124]. Maxillary sinus hypoplasia can be misdiagnosed with mucosal thickening in infectious disease or neoplasms involving the sinus in conventional radiographs. Maxillary sinus hypoplasia can be seen as a partial opacification, and aplasia appears as a total opacification. CT/CBCT examination is the ideal method for detecting this anatomical variation. Radiological diagnosis of maxillary sinus hypoplasia and aplasia is important to prevent possible complications during endoscopic sinus surgery, such as causing potential harm to the orbit [131] (Fig. 11.31).\n",

Due to its limitations, plain conventional radiographic techniques are not able to visualize the paranasal variations such as accessory ostium. Obtaining a three-dimensional view using CT is a more accurate method to evaluate the maxillary sinus. In addition, CBCT becomes the first choice to evaluate dentomaxillary area because of its advantages [151] (Fig. 11.35).\n",
