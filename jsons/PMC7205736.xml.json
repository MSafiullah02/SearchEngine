Home care services are an alternative answer to help the elderly people, defined by both healthcare practitioners and academics. These services, including nursing, wound-care, housekeeping, injection, cleaning and physiotherapy, are less expensive and more efficient than regular services delivered in hospitals or retirement homes [2], [3]. In addition, the ageing population prefer to receive their care at home. Based on official reports, the European population over 60 years old will grow to 54% by the year 2060 [4], which could lead to a rapid increase in home healthcare operations.",

            "text": "Caregivers provide several cares for elderly people at home [5], [6]. Moreover, old people may need a combination of different caregivers such as a nurse, physiotherapist or nutritionist [7]. The planning of caregivers including patient assignment, routing and scheduling decisions, is very difficult and requires a great deal of time and effort to find a valid plan [8]. The daily activities of caregivers start at the pharmacy [9]. After meeting the patients, the biological samples or the treatments taken from the patients are analyzed and their electronic health records are updated in a laboratory [5]. From the perspective of home healthcare managers, there are two important challenges. The first one is the transportation cost associated with the logistics activities of caregivers [10]. Another concern is the availability of patients and caregivers [11]. However, the availability of patients is considered as an uncertain issue rather than exact [8]. Thus, fuzzy logic by using triangular fuzzy numbers can help decision-makers to estimate the time windows of availability. The uncertain factors can be estimated by three possible scenarios including optimistic, realistic and pessimistic ones based on the triangular fuzzy numbers. Additionally, the patients\u2019 satisfaction is another important factor characterizing the quality of home healthcare from the perspective of the patients. Although most of the studies focus on the total cost of home care services, the patients\u2019 satisfaction is still scarce. These reasons motivate us to develop a bi-objective optimization decision-making model called the home healthcare routing and scheduling problem under fuzzy conditions. To this end, we use a fuzzy approach to cope with the uncertainty of travel parameters and patients\u2019 satisfaction.",

Due to the daily decision-making of this problem and the complexity of this combinatorial optimization model, the applications of heuristics and metaheuristics are popular in the literature [12], [13]. According to a well-known theory for optimization called \u201cno free lunch\u201d, no optimization algorithm is able to be efficient for all complicated optimization problems [14]. Since the proposed home healthcare routing and scheduling problem is more complex as compared with the previous ones, it is difficult to get a robust answer using current metaheuristics in the literature. This motivates our attempts to employ a recent metaheuristic, namely, social engineering optimizer (SEO) [15]. Therefore, a new modification on this metaheuristic based on an adaptive memory is designed to better address the proposed problem in comparison with itself and two other well-known metaheuristics.",

One of first papers addressing the problem was (Begur et al. in 1997 [16]). The authors applied a decision-making tool called as SDSS to model a simplified home healthcare routing problem through a case in the United States. Nine years later, the first vehicle routing optimization approach applied to the home healthcare was addressed by Bertels and Fahle [17]. They solved it by using a heuristic algorithm combining the linear and constraint programming methods and local search strategies. In 2007, a particle swarm optimization (PSO) was applied successfully by Akjiratikarl et al. [18] to address a home healthcare scheduling problem in Ukraine. A heuristic for the scheduling was also implemented. In 2009, Eveborn et al. [19] developed two mathematical models to improve both routing and scheduling problems of the home healthcare. Later in 2011, Trautsamwieser et al. [20] addressed a scheduling problem for the home healthcare under uncertainty. They considered a case of natural disaster based on Austrian flood in 2002 to validate their proposed stochastic model. Another contribution in the area of home healthcare scheduling was introduced by Rasmussen et al. [21]. They proposed a branch-and-price solution planning to solve it.",

The reason is that the home care logistic costs are the main concern for the organization of the home healthcare. In 2013, Liu et al. [22] proposed a home healthcare routing problem considering the supposition of time windows. They assumed both pickup and delivery operations, simultaneously, for drugs and biological samples, respectively. Their innovation was also the development of heuristics formulated by the tabu search (TS) and the genetic algorithm (GA). In 2014, Mankowska et al. [23] proposed a new home healthcare routing problem as a multi-period and multi-service. In their proposed problem, each caregiver can support at least two services regarding the required medications and time availability. In another research, Liu et al. [24] introduced a hybrid metaheuristic by an improvement on TS with infeasible and feasible local searches to tackle a home healthcare logistic problem. In 2015, Fikar and Hirsch [11] offered another routing and scheduling problem for the application of the home healthcare with the possibility of caregivers\u2019 walking to visit the patients as well as the time window limitations. A case study in Austria was suggested to generate the test problems and to address the proposed problem, two hybrid metaheuristics based on TS and simulated annealing (SA) were introduced. In 2016, a bi-objective optimization model for the home care scheduling problem was firstly developed by Braekers et al. [25]. Their goal was to find an interaction between two minimization objectives, namely, the total cost and the patients\u2019 inconvenience. They also used some simplified metaheuristics combined by dynamic programming. In 2017, Shi et al. [26] proposed a single objective and single depot routing and scheduling problem for the application of home healthcare with the suppositions of time windows and fuzzy demand function.",

They also added immigrant schemes and inheritance to this problem to consider the synchronization of the caregivers. Liu et al. [28] introduced another formulation of the bi-objective optimization to consider the medical team working in home care services. In addition to the transportation costs, they minimized the unemployment of caregivers through a group of medical operations. In another paper concerning metaheuristic algorithms, a memetic algorithm (MA) for the first time was applied by Decerle et al. [1] to a single objective multi-period routing and scheduling problem of the home healthcare. A Lagrangian relaxation-based algorithm was firstly contributed by Fathollahi-Fard et al. [3]. They also considered a penalty function to better optimize the routes of caregivers known as travel balancing. In another study, Cappanera et al. [29] proposed a robust optimization of the routing and scheduling problem for a home healthcare under uncertainty. As another multi-objective optimization, Fathollahi-Fard et al. [9] contributed the environmental pollution to the home healthcare by considering the operational routing and scheduling decisions. They developed four heuristics based on two decision rules to find an interaction between the transportation costs and green emissions. They also utilized salp swarm algorithm (SSA) and its hybridization with SA for the first time.",

The transportation cost of TCk and capacity of CAPk have been considered according to the vehicles. The time window is also existed in our model. For each time period, the latest time (L~it) and the earliest time (E~it) of the availability of the patients are uncertain. With regards to home healthcare services, each nurse or caregiver has an estimated time to achieve the planned activities (W~it). In this regard, the visit of patients i toj as the traveling time is T~ijt. The main contribution of the model is the supposition of privilege from patients to the caregivers for their provided services of the home care to increase the patients\u2019 satisfaction (\u03bb~int). Notably, it is difficult to estimate this parameter and other parameters related to the time services. Due to the uncertainty of these parameters (i.e., E~it,L~it,W~it,T~ijt,\u03bb~int), the tilde sign (\u223c) is considered and the fuzzy set theory will be utilized to estimate them. Furthermore, the first objective in addition to the transportation cost and allocation costs, includes the penalty of the overall distance for caregivers in order to manage the routes of caregivers and to do the travel balancing of the caregivers in each period. Accordingly, if the total number of the caregivers\u2019 routes is higher than a value (MDISnkt), a penalty value is then considered (PEN).",

Exploitation is typically the most demanding of the two. Given that the training and retraining phase is key to the exploitation phase, the proposed extension is to make that process more efficient. For the existing SEO training and retraining of the attacker, a percentage of defender traits as \u03b1 is selected randomly. Rather than employing an arbitrary selection process, the AMSEO extension identifies if any specific trait is having a generally successful impact on the defender over the course of different iterations (whereupon the new defender can dominate the old one). Whenever any such trait is identified, the selection process is modified so that this trait can increase the chance of selection. The selection process adapts to reflect the more successful patterns of selection, learned over time. For example, consider that there are four traits and the initial rate of \u03b1 is to weight each probability of selection equally, at 0.25 for each, {0.25, 0.25, 0.25, 0.25}. Over time the rates of success for each trait is recorded, and the relative probabilities adjusted accordingly. Thus, for a rate of success across the four traits of {3, 4, 2, 2}, the selection probabilities are adjusted to {0.27, 0.36, 0.18, 0.18}, respectively.",

From the majority of cases, specifically and perhaps in European and North American countries, the ageing population care is a challengeable concern. More broadly, in a case of an epidemic disease like COVID-19 in 2020 [62], the best and efficient way to do the care, is staying at home along with considering the healthcare instruments. Therefore, a simplified model to the home healthcare is not suitable to fully deliver all the real aspects of this important optimization problem. This paper aims to introduce an extension to the home healthcare optimization which is performance and practical. No doubt a multi-objective optimization is needed to accommodate the total cost of a structured logistics network with a set of pharmacies and laboratories as well as the patients\u2019 satisfaction to provide better home care services. As some parameters of the model are uncertain, this study uses a fuzzy Jimenez\u2019s method to control the uncertainty of service times, the privilege from patients to caregivers based on their performance from previous data and other key parameters of model. This estimation is done by using the triangular fuzzy numbers to consider the optimistic, realistic and pessimistic scenarios for these parameters. At last but not least, an algorithm allows this complex problem to be efficiently solved in a way which is strong and manageable computationally.",

A new adaptive extension of SEO in its multi-objective version (AMSEO) is well given the particular two objective functions of the problem definition. Based on the analyses, AMSEO performs significantly better than SEO, NSGA-II and SA, when all methods were tuned by response surface methodology (RSM) and compared across four popular evaluation metrics: the number of Pareto solutions (NPS), the spread of non-dominance solutions (SNS), mean ideal distance (MID), and hyper volume (HV).
