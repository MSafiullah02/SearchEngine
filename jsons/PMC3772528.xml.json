First, we provide the first link between a low serum 25(OH)D level and risk of viral coinfection, specifically the risk of RSV, rhinovirus, or both infections, which were involved in most of the coinfections. Interestingly, the association was demonstrated in the most severe spectrum of viral illness in children with acute wheezing necessitating hospitalization. Moreover, RSV is the dominant cause of bronchiolitis, whereas rhinovirus is the main trigger of wheezing in slightly older children and an important risk factor for asthma.8 Our results are consistent with multiple epidemiologic studies examining the association between vitamin D intake/level and risk of respiratory tract illness and one randomized controlled trial examining influenza.1, 2, 3, 4, 5 Together these findings suggest that vitamin D might play a role in antiviral defense and might be particularly important in children at increased risk of moderate-to-severe viral infections, such as young infants exposed to RSV and high asthma risk children exposed to rhinovirus. The potential beneficial effects of vitamin D in the defense against respiratory tract infections might involve changes in both the innate and adaptive immune systems.9\n",
