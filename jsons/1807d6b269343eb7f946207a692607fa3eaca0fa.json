After adjusting for severity of illness, the hospital mortality for all patients with tuberculosis requiring mechanical ventilation was similar to patients with ARDS from any cause (69 vs. 56%) but higher than the mortality from nontuberculous bacterial pneumonia requiring mechanical ventilation but without ARDS (36%) (17). The reasons postulated for this increased mortality include a delay in appropriate anti-microbial therapy, difficulties associated with the administration and tolerance of anti-tuberculosis drugs, and the frequent lack of quick improvement even in the setting of appropriate therapy.",

However, in a recent retrospective case series, granulomas were only found in 52 of 871 autopsies from patients with active tuberculosis, yielding an overall incidence of adrenal involvement of 6% of all patients with TB (25). An additional 3 cases were detected among surviving patients undergoing 270 adrenalectomies for indications without suspicion of TB. In this series, thirty percent of the patients had extrapulmonary disease, and the adrenal gland was the fifth most common site, behind liver, spleen, kidney and bone (25). Interestingly, only seven of the 55 patients with adrenal involvement presented with signs and symptoms of Addison's disease (25). This is consistent with biochemical studies revealing subnormal cortisol responses to administration of cosyntropin in only 8 of 88 patients with active disease prior to starting therapy and in only one of these 88 patients after four weeks antibiotic therapy (26). Nonetheless, given the prevalence of relative adrenal insufficiency in ICU patients (27), this entity must be considered in any patient with tuberculosis presenting with septic shock and replacement of stress-dose steroids may be beneficial (28). Conversely, tuberculosis must be considered as a potential explanation for patients presenting with adrenal insufficiency.",

Often, this is in the setting of active disease with a high burden of organisms. It can occur either with bronchiolar ulceration and necrosis of adjacent bronchial vessels during acute disease, or by rupture of a Rasmussen's aneurysm from the pulmonary arterial circulation eroding through a thick walled cavity (30). Additionally, massive hemoptysis can occur after resolution of active disease by the broncholithic passage of a calcified lymph node (30). Early surgical intervention has been recommended for definitive treatment, with few studies to document overall efficacy in this high-risk population (29). Securing the airway, often by the use of a double-lumen endotracheal tube, is essential followed by bronchoscopic localization of the source of bleeding as the diagnostic procedure of choice (30) and by blood replacement. Temporizing measures including iced saline irrigation, topical epinephrine or fibrinogen, balloon tamponade, and /or vessel embolization appear to be associated with variable success (30).

However, the incidence of extrapulmonary disease appears to be increasing (17.5% of all tuberculous cases in 1986 vs. historical values of about 11 to 13%), reflective of a decline in pulmonary cases and a rise in the number of immunocompromised patients particularly with HIV co-infection (31, 32). The sites of infection for these cases are listed in decreasing order of prevalence; lymphatic (5.4% of the total), pleural (4.0%), genitourinary (2.1%), bone and joint (1.7%), other (1.6%), miliary (1.3%), meningeal (0.8%), and peritoneal (0.6%) (32). Unfortunately, these data have not been stratified according to the level of disease severity (i.e. ICU vs. hospital ward vs. community).

Both urinary TB and scrofula have a similar pathogenesis involving the erosion of preexisting granulomas through local tissue planes (33, 34). Although the potential exists for limited environmental shedding of viable organisms, this routinely is without aerosol formation such that nosocomial spread is very unlikely by this route, unless there is high velocity irrigation of diseased bone, joint or skin. Urinary TB is suggested by unexplained (i.e. \"sterile\") pyuria, particularly in the presence of renal calyx dilatation, focal calcium deposits, cavity formation, or multiple segments of partial ureteral obstruction (33). Lymph node tuberculosis is suggested by the presence of an indurated, cool subcutaneous nodule over the neck, clavicle, knees or ankles with a sinus tract draining caseous material, and is often a reflection underlying soft tissue or bone/joint involvement, necessitating radiographic investigation of these areas (34). Other dermatologic hallmarks of tuberculous reactivation with or without pulmonary involvement include lupus vulgaris (coalescent red-brown papules forming a plaque with raised edges and scarred centers on the head and neck), and less commonly tuberculosis cutis orificialis (nonhealing periorificial ulcers in immunocompromised patients). Fortunately in all of these cases, acid-fast stains of spun urine samples, drainage or biopsy material, are very sensitive and can facilitate diagnosis, and offer an explanation for pulmonary infiltrates when these are present.",

Whereas pericardial involvement almost always reflects the presence of clinically silent tuberculosis at other sites (35), the meningeal form often presents with a normal chest radiograph and occasionally represents the only site of involvement in a previously healthy patient without identifiable risk factors (36). Unfortunately, the clinical presentations for these two extrapulmonary manifestations do not distinguish them from nontuberculous etiologies. Additionally, the sensitivity of acid-fast smears of pericardial and cerebral spinal fluid are low. However, tuberculosis must be in the differential diagnosis for patients presenting to the ICU with tamponade, particularly immunocompromised patients or those from select racial/ethnic groups or communities with a relatively high rate of TB who also have a bloody, lymphocytic and/or monocytic exudative effusion (35). Similarly, tuberculosis must be strongly considered for critically ill patients with mental status changes, signs and symptoms consistent with meningitis, who also have a lymphocytic pleocytosis with a glucose less than 40 in their cerebral spinal fluid with a negative Gram stain and cryptococcal antigen. Adenosine deaminase (ADA) analysis and/or the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) coupled with gene probing of this fluid may help speed diagnosis (see below). Determining the level of in these fluids may also be useful in diagnosis. Finally, due to the intensity of the inflammatory and fibrotic reactions at these two sites, adjunctive corticosteroids (in addition to standard therapy) are recommended in the management of patients with either tuberculous pericarditis or meningitis (38).",

By contrast, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved the Enhanced MTD test for the diagnosis of active disease using respiratory specimens.

Whereas isoniazid has the most killing activity against rapidly dividing mycobacteria, rifampin or other rifamycins have become the cornerstone of tuberculous therapy because of their sterilizing ability in dormant populations. Pyrazinamide has preferential activity in acidic environments and is therefore useful cavitary disease. Ethambutol helps maintain susceptibility to rifamycins in the setting of pre-existing isoniazid resistance, and may add to a regimens early mycobactericidal activity. Other first-line drugs include rifapentine and rifabutin (not FDA approved). Second-line agents include cycloserine, ethionamide, streptomycin, amikacin/kanamycin, capreomycin, p-aminosalicylic acid, ciprofloxacin (or other fluoroquinolones) and clofazamine. The initial phase of treatment should include four drugs for at least two months, followed by a continuation phase with two drugs (preferably isoniazid and rifampin) determined by culture susceptibilities and the site and extent of disease burden (38).",

            "text": "Although well-accepted, reduced-frequency (i.e. intermittent) regimens exist for both the initial and continuation phases, critically ill patients should receive daily therapy due to the risk of altered pharmacokinetics in this population. Because ethambutol and pyrazinamide are only available for oral administration, every effort should be made to initiate early feeding and drug delivery via a Dobhoff or similar tube, even within twelve hours of major abdominal surgery and in advance of the return of bowel sounds and flatus. If the oral route cannot be tolerated due to severe gastroparesis, vomiting, or diarrhea with malabsorption, parenteral therapy can be initiated with isoniazid, rifampin, streptomycin and a fluoroquinolone, followed by a transition to a standard regimen when bowel function is restored. Other factors influencing pharmacokinetics include the presence of renal dysfunction, necessitating dose adjustments for most agents. Moreover, patients with severe liver dysfunction at baseline should not be given a standard regimen due to the combination of multiple potentially hepatotoxic agents. In this case, a preferable regimen might be rifampin, ethambutol, and a fluoroquinolone or aminoglycoside (38). If there are major pharacokinetic concerns about an individual critically ill patient, it is possible and perhaps desirable to monitor drug levels (53), however, these targets are not well established making this area of therapy controversial (38). Finally, many of these antibiotics have significant drug interactions with agents commonly used in the ICU, including anticoagulants, anticonvulsants, cardiovascular agents, psychotropic drugs, and steroids or other drugs used in organ transplantation. Thus, clinical vigilance is needed, often supplemented by therapeutic drug monitoring of the non-tuberculous agents (38).",

The acts of breathing, coughing, sneezing, speaking and singing normally cause the release of droplets of varying size, which also carry tubercle bacilli from an individual with active pulmonary disease. The largest of these droplets rapidly settle onto surfaces, which are contaminated but generally not considered infectious from a pulmonary standpoint. Evaporation of medium particles causes the formation of droplet nuclei roughly 1 to in size. Animal experiments have shown that nuclei of this size are required to directly infect the alveolus, and that particle deposition in the larger airways does not render a productive infection. These nuclei remain airborne and infectious for several hours (54).",

Unfortunately, attempts to use clinical risk factors to reduce the numbers of patients with non-tuberculous disease requiring respiratory isolation during their workup have unacceptably high failure rates (20% or more) (56, 57).

As discussed above, patients exclusively with extrapulmonary tuberculosis are much less contagious due to the lack of aerosol formation.

Any exposed personnel should have a PPD test within the first week following exposure to document prior exposure history, followed by a second PPD test three months later. With documented exposure to a patient with active disease, the \"cut point\" for a positive result becomes 5 mm of induration, reduced from the 10 mm point normally used for health care personnel so as to increase the sensitivity of the test. According to recently revised guidelines, a positive PPD test is an indication to consider treatment to prevent the occurrence of latent disease, regardless of age. This recommendation reflects a lower incidence of isoniazid-related hepatitis than previously documented, in combination with the recent resurgence in TB incidence. If the isolate from the index patient is susceptible, isoniazid (5 mg/kg PO daily, max 300 mg/day) remains the standard for a course of therapy for nine months. Shorter regimens may be effective including the combined use of rifampin and pyrizinamide, however, the latter may be associated with increased risk of liver toxicity. Successful completion of a prophylactic regimen reduces the risk of development of active disease by 93% (58).",

Several candidate genes, including gamma interferon, interleukin-10, and the natural resistance-associated macrophage protein 1 (NRAMP-1), have polymorphisms that are associated with an increased risk of active disease in select populations (62, 63).

Making the transition from the epidemiological identification of a genetic risk factor to a surrogate endpoint for clinical outcome can be greatly facilitated when there is a reproducible biochemical assay that correlates with both the genetic changes and the outcome surrogate. An example of this may be the nucleotide receptor, Polymorphisms of this gene have been associated with protection from smear-positive disease in a Gambian population (65). This gene encodes an ion channel and pore expressed by most classes of leukocytes, and is involved with phagolysosomal maturation and killing of intracellular mycobacteria (66). Individuals with other loss-of-function genetic defects in this pore have monocytes that are less able kill the BCG strain in vitro (67). This pore is defective in roughly 15% of healthy adults and can be screened rapidly (68), thus providing the foundation for future clinical trials evaluating the risk of reactivation from latent disease. Collectively, genomic advances may allow for rapid diagnosis of tuberculosis in critically ill patients and could even direct the administration of immunomodulatory adjunctive therapy. ",
