While retinal ganglion cells and inner ear hair cells receive external stimuli behind some physical barrier, olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs) are directly embedded in the upper olfactory mucosa ready to bind odour molecules as they enter nasal fossae. The advantage is having a direct sensor of our chemical environment but the downside is having a vulnerable entry point to the brain for inhaled pathogens and toxins. In humans, many neurotropic viruses are naturally neuroinvasive, often primarily via this olfactory route, such as poliovirus, influenza, HSV and, more importantly, coronaviruses [1]. Netland et al. showed that SARS-CoV-1 spread in mice central nervous system primarily through the olfactory bulb, inducing neuronal loss [2]. In humans, presence of SARS-CoV-1 was found in brain autopsies \u2013 in neurons \u2013, and in CSF of living patients [2], [3]. Other human coronaviruses have shown to result in encephalitis, acute paralysis and other neurological complications [4]. As for COVID-19, the extent of neurological involvement is still unknown, although preliminary studies report neurological manifestations in 36.4% of infected patients and a case of meningo-encephalitis was reported in which SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in CSF [5], [6].",

A European study reported early on that 72% of patients complained of persisting loss of smell after the acute phase. Post-viral olfactory dysfunction is indeed a well-known sequela of common colds by respiratory viruses, such as influenza, rhinovirus, and other coronaviruses, but unlike COVID-19, it has always been a rare event given the high incidence of common colds in the population [9]. Although the mechanism underlying post-viral olfactory dysfunction is still unknown, human biopsies showed disordered or absent olfactory neuroepithelium with signs of loss of sensory cilia, neuronal apoptosis, excessive cicatrisation and respiratory metaplasia. These pathological observations led to think that post-viral loss of smell is an unfortunate consequence of virus-induced damage to the olfactory neuroepithelium [10].",

We wonder whether beyond a certain threshold, when local barriers are overwhelmed by viral spread, an immune-mediated self-defence mechanism in ORNs is triggered in order to cut off the road to the brain? Could it be that some people lose smell not because the virus destroyed olfactory neurons but because our body evolved to bomb the bridge in a scorched-earth strategy?",

They showed that influenza viral components were trapped in apoptotic bodies later to be phagocytised by macrophages, effectively preventing lethal spread to the central nervous system. Perlman et al. showed in mice that intranasal inoculation of a neurotropic coronavirus led to central nervous system infection via the olfactory nerve; and that it did not, when the olfactory bulb was ablated, suggesting that cutting off the road can be an effective protective mechanism against coronaviruses [14].",

This is totally different if neurons have the capacity for self-renewal. ORNs are very special neurons as they self-renew continuously through life every 30 to 120 days [16]. Lifelong regulated apoptosis is therefore a normal turnover phenomenon for ORNs. People do not perceive any olfactory change in a permanent controlled apoptosis mechanism, whereas brutal large-scale apoptosis of ORNs could in contrast lead to sudden loss of smell. Teleologically it makes sense for nature to be able to continuously regenerate parts of the only cranial nerve it can knock down, thereby allowing restoration of the ability to smell after the threat has passed.",

In late 2019, olfactory mucosa samples from living adult humans showed the presence of many immature neurons alongside leukocytes, suggesting that (a) olfactory neurogenesis is a robust process in adult humans, and that (b) cells from the immune system play a key role in olfactory epithelium homeostasis [18].",

As of now, it remains still controversial where exactly loss of smell stands in COVID-19 clinical picture in terms of severity. Preliminary studies show that patients reporting anosmia seem to be younger and have less serious symptoms [7]. Conversely, it seems that hospitalised patients may be less subject to olfactory impairment. Mao et al. found only 5% out of 214 hospitalised patients complained of loss of smell with a mean age of 52.7 [5]. This suggests that losing smell could turn out to be a positive prognostic factor, corroborating the concept that anosmia could reflect an effective defence strategy against the virus. Moreover, beyond the acute phase, time will tell if COVID-19-related anosmia or its absence will also be linked to long-term neurological disease. Human coronaviruses have indeed been found persisting in neurons of living patients, some with neurological sequelae [2], [20]. They have been suggested as potential etiological agents or triggers for many neurological diseases in genetically predisposed individuals, such as multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer\u2019s disease, and Parkinson\u2019s disease [20], [21]. This is part of the still debated \u201colfactory vector hypothesis\u201d which posits that with time inhaled pathogens and toxins lead to or participate in neurodegeneration as they pass via a porous olfactory nerve [22], [23].",

The immune system loss of control and cytokine storm seem indeed to play a bigger role than thought in the morbidity and mortality of COVID-19, but this contradicts the observation that loss of smell seem to concern patients with mild to moderate symptoms [28]. It may be that older or more vulnerable patients lack an effective and regenerative immuno-olfactory barrier which eventually let viruses pass through and without successfully triggering immune-induced apoptosis.",

They analysed the expression of ACE2 in olfactory mucosa, a known receptor SARS-CoV-2 uses to infect human cells [29]. They showed that ACE2 can be sparsely found in support cells, pericytes and stem cells but not in olfactory neurons. They speculated therefore that olfactory dysfunction was not due to direct ORN infection by the virus and could be due to secondary infection or inflammation of olfactory neurons. Paradoxically, they observed that infecting the rat olfactory epithelium with a strain of coronavirus led to loss of neurosensory cilia from ORNs and rather limited infection of supporting cells. These results support the idea that ORNs may be affected in an ACE2-independent manner and that the subsequent olfactory dysfunction may be due to an immune response towards SARS-CoV-2 rather than direct damage by the virus.",

However, even though most biological pathways may be very similar among mammals, olfaction is much more important for mice than humans in terms of impact on survival. This means that to fully explore the interactions between coronavirus neuroinvasion, immune reaction, apoptosis and neurogenesis, future research will have to be conducted on fresh human olfactory mucosa sampling. This can be done by excision of a portion of the olfactory cleft as part of a transnasal endoscopic surgery for another indication.",

Besides, such a drastic protective strategy is all the more worth the risk since the olfactory nerve has the rare ability to regenerate. Consistent with this hypothesis and as anosmia also seems to be part of the mild-to-moderate clinical presentation of COVID-19, we suspect it to be a positive prognostic factor.",
