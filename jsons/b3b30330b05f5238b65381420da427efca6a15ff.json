We have devised a new informed consent format for all patients undergoing surgery incorporating a few points specific for the disease.",

We have devised the first pro forma of informed consent of such patients undergoing surgical intervention.",

In a retrospective cohort study of 34 operative patients with confirmed COVID-19, 44.1% of patients required ICU care in the post-operative period and mortality rate was 20.5% [1] . Therefore, it is very important to devise a separate informed consent for operative patients during COVID-19, taking all the risk under consideration. We are reporting the first ever informed consent pro forma especially designed for COVID-19 patients undergoing surgery.",

A normal patient may develop or contract corona virus infection in the peri-or post-operative period which should be again documented in the consent form. Hence, a detailed modified consent form was designed exclusively for all patients who require surgery during this pandemic.",
