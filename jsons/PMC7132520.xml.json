Surface contamination with viruses is common in households, industrial settings and healthcare facilities, and the role of these contaminated surfaces in the transmission of certain viruses, such as norovirus, is recognized increasingly.1 Many viruses have a low infectious dose and are shed at high titres from infected individuals, even when the infection is asymptomatic.2 They can contaminate dry surfaces, survive for extended periods and be transmitted to susceptible hosts from surfaces.2, 3 Once dried on inanimate surfaces, viruses are less susceptible to disinfection than when hydrated in suspension.4 This susceptibility is further reduced by the presence of organic soil and viral clumping.4\n",

Condensing systems inject hydrogen peroxide until the air in the enclosure becomes saturated and hydrogen peroxide begins to condense on surfaces. Non-condensing systems dry the vapour stream as it is returned to the generator.12 Both condensing and non-condensing systems are registered with the Environmental Protection Agency, and have well-established efficacy against bacterial spores and other microbes.12, 13, 14 A study published in the 1990s evaluated the efficacy of a non-condensing VHP system against a range of viruses.14 However, limited evidence is available for the virucidal activity of condensing HPV systems. Recently, several studies have demonstrated the in-vitro activity of condensing HPV systems against individual viruses, including feline calicivirus (FCV),11 adenovirus,15 lactococcal bacteriophages16 and MS2 coliphage.17 However, to the authors' knowledge, no studies published to date have evaluated the efficacy of condensing HPV systems against a range of viruses exposed under the same conditions.",

The total exposure time, including injection and aeration (the breakdown of hydrogen peroxide), was approximately 2\u20133 h, varying with the amount of hydrogen peroxide being vaporized.

They reported that HPV reduced the viral titre by 4-log on all surfaces tested within 20 min of exposure in a microbiological safety cabinet. The present finding that HPV was virucidal against FCV [>5-log reduction in tissue culture infective dose (TCID50)] is similar to the results of Bentley et al.,11 despite recovery of a lower inoculum from the control discs (>5-log compared with >7-log) and the fact that a different strain of the virus was tested.",

Effective disinfection of the environment is key for interrupting transmission from the environment, especially as many of these viruses have a very low infective dose. However, this is not always achieved by conventional cleaning and disinfection techniques due to inherent limitations in the process and variation in viruses' resistance to the disinfectant. HPV, a vapour-phase disinfection method, was virucidal on structurally distinct viruses dried on surfaces, and hence HPV can be considered for the disinfection of virus-contaminated surfaces.",
