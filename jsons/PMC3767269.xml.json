These include new, previously undefined diseases as well as old diseases with new features. These new features may include the introduction of a disease to a new location or a new population (e.g. it may present in youth where previously it was only seen in the elderly); new clinical features, including resistance to available treatments; or a rapid increase in the incidence and spread of the disease. Reappearance of a disease which was once endemic but had since been eradicated or controlled, would classify it as a re-emerging infectious disease. Emergence may also be due to a new recognition of an infectious agent in the population or the realization that an established condition has an infectious origin1.",

Epidemics or pandemics caused by these emerging and re-emerging infections often take a heavy toll of life and by rapidly spreading across borders are responsible for much concern and panic. Besides health, emerging infections also present a grave economic, developmental and security challenge. As a case in point SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome), is the first severe infectious diseases to emerge in the twenty-first century. Having emerged in Guandong province of China in 2003, possibly from civet cats, SARS, a new corona virus, spread rapidly to 30 countries across Asia, Americas and Europe, with a total of 8,439 cases and 812 deaths, within 7 to 8 months5. It posed a serious threat to global health security, the health system capacities to cope where health workers themselves were at risk, and the stability and growth of economies. The economic losses to countries in Asia were estimated at UD$ 10-30 billion6.",

Adaptation by one partner to exploit new environments will often stimulate the other to modify its characteristics to take advantage of the change. The human encroachment into habitat especially in tropical regions and interface with wildlife can lead to creation of \u201chot spots\u201d for emergence of new pathogens, with a potential for rapid spread among susceptible human populations, facilitated by rapid means of travel and wildlife trafficking. The mutation of a virus strain from animals, as making it infectious to humans, is a common cause of new illnesses in humans. A systematic review conducted to identify factors associated with emergence and re-emergence of human pathogens has shown changes in land use or agricultural practices and changes in human demographics and society as the major drivers associated with emergence and re-emergence of human pathogens11.",

Distribution of emerging and re-emerging pathogens by groups shows that 37 per cent of emerging and re-emerging pathogens are viruses and prions followed by protozoa (25%). This indicates that emerging and re-emerging pathogens are disproportionately viruses11. Examples of some recent emerging and re-emerging infections are shown in Fig. 1. In addition, emergence of microorganisms resistant to antimicrobials to which these were previously sensitive to is cause of concern. Cases with such infections often fail to respond to the standard treatment, resulting in prolonged illness and increased risk of death. According to WHO, 440,000 new cases of multi-drug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) emerge annually, causing at least 150,000 deaths6. A more virulent form called extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) has been reported from 64 countries. Another example of global concern relates to the specter of falciparum malaria resistant to artemisinin combination therapy (ACT) emerging at the Cambodia-Thai border which has a potential to spread across countries6.",

Plague infection continues to exist in sylvatic foci in many parts of India which is transmitted to humans occasionally. This has been demonstrated with focal outbreaks of plague in India in 1994, 2002 and 2004232425. Epidemiological investigations have attributed these recurrences to spillover from an epizootic cycle of plague in wild rodents to commensal rodents driven by climate variation2627. Recent analysis of data from Kazakhstan shows that warmer springs and wetter summers increase the prevalence of plague in its main host, the great gerbil27. The National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) has identified four sylvatic foci in India; the tri-junction of Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu, later Beed belt in Maharashtra, Rohru in Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand25. The plague outbreak in Surat, led not only to nationwide panic but to a near international isolation of India. As a result, the country incurred direct economic losses to the tune of US $ 1.7 billion6.",

The three rounds of National Family Health Surveys (NFHS) also show that DPT 3 coverage during 1992-2006 was only 52-55 per cent303132. Persistence or resurgence of diphtheria in the country seems mainly due to low coverage of primary immunization as well as boosters (Fig. 3).

An epidemiological age shift has been noted in these outbreaks, with the disease now affecting older children (5-19 yr) and adults.

This virus was not considered to have an epidemic potential until an outbreak of acute encephalitis in children in Andhra Pradesh, India was attributed to CHP virus in 2003 with a case fatality rate of 55 per cent43. CHP virus is transmitted to humans by sandflies. Subsequently focal outbreaks have been reported from Gujarat (2004), and Maharashtra (2007)4445. The outbreaks have predominantly focused in rural areas and sandflies seem to be the main vector and maintainence host of the virus.

A comprehensive national strategy on infectious diseases addressing the challenges of emerging and re-emerging infections cutting across all relevant sectors, both governmental and non-governmental, should be in place. Identification of national centres of excellence and their capacity building is of critical importance. These centres of excellence should be encouraged to develop networking and partnerships between public health organizations to improve their individual scientific capacity, share best practices and expand collective knowledge base. Concerted efforts are also needed to develop advanced countermeasures such as surveillance tools, diagnostic tests, vaccines and therapeutics through basic, translational and applied research. Sensitive rapid response mechanisms at various levels of health service are the cornerstone to detect public health threats and respond quickly enough to protect valuable human lives. National commitment and comprehensive efforts are necessary at all levels of health services in order to meet the threat of emerging and re-emerging infections.",
