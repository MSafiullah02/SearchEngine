The machine vision systems are able to provide such functionality. They have high reliability, performance and accuracy in determining the geometric dimensions of ore particles. At the moment, several vision systems have been developed and implemented for the operational control of the particle size distribution of crushed or granular material.

            "text": "Based on the drawn borders on the test images, it can be concluded that the convolutional neural network is able to correctly identify the boundary points with a high probability. It rarely makes mistakes for cases when there is no boundary (false positive), but often makes mistakes when recognizing real boundary points (false negative). The boundary breaks are too large to be closed using morphological operations on binary masks, however, the use of the \"watershed\" algorithm will reduce the identification error for boundary points.",
