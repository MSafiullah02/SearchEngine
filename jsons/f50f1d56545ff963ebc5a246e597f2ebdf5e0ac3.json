Significance: A postitional scanning library of potentially 390,625 members was prepared on solid-phase from Nalkylglycines and lysines. The library had the format XXXXKKK, where K \u00bc lysine and X \u00bc one of 25 N-alkylglycines. From screening, a lead with 1 mM activity against bacterial strains was identified. Significance: The amino acid Choi was immobilized on a silyl linker and used in the solid-phase synthesis of the natural product areuginosin 298-A and 23 additional analogues. Compounds were tested for trypsin inhibition, and the analogue lacking a hydroxymethyl group in the arginyl sidechain was 300 fold more potent than the natural product. Significance: An optimization library of 24 isoxazolines linked to a flourescent coumarin was prepared as chymotrypsin substrates. The best substrate was then converted to the inhibitor shown by replacing the coumarin by a phosphonate. The inhibitor showed selectivity between serine proteases.",
