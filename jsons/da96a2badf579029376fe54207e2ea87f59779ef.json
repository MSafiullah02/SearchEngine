            "text": "The critical step in the emergence of a new epidemic or pandemic viral pathogen occurs after it infects the initial spillover host and then is successfully transmitted onwards, causing an outbreak chain of transmission within that new host population. Crossing these choke points sets a pathogen on the pathway to epidemic emergence. While many viruses spill over to infect new or alternative hosts, only a few accomplish this transition-and the reasons for the success of those pathogens are still unclear. Here, we consider this issue related to the emergence of animal viruses, where factors involved likely include the ability to efficiently infect the new animal host, the demographic features of the initial population that favour onward transmission, the level of shedding and degree of susceptibility of individuals of that population, along with pathogen evolution favouring increased replication and more efficient transmission among the new host individuals. A related form of emergence involves mutations that increased spread or virulence of an already-known virus within its usual host. In all of these cases, emergence may be due to altered viral properties, changes in the size or structure of the host populations, ease of transport, climate change or, in the case of arboviruses, to the expansion of the arthropod vectors. Here, we focus on three examples of viruses that have gained efficient onward transmission after spillover: influenza A viruses that are respiratory transmitted, HIV, a retrovirus, that is mostly blood or mucosal transmitted, and canine parvovirus that is faecal:oral transmitted. We describe our current understanding of the changes in the viruses that allowed them to overcome the barriers that prevented efficient replication and spread in their new hosts. We also briefly outline how we could gain a better understanding of the mechanisms and variability in order to better anticipate these events in the future.",

Most animal viruses appear to have defined host ranges, circulating and maintaining themselves among a specific group of animal hosts in established relationships. Spillovers occur when viruses infect hosts in which they are not commonly found, and most often involve the infection of single animal species with limited (or no) transmission to additional animals of the same species [5] . However, the true host ranges (i.e. the animal species that are naturally infected and which can sustain transmission) and onward transmission potentials of many viruses are still poorly defined, because in the past, we did not sample to detect mild or subclinical infections, which appear to be quite common. In addition, our current understanding of the true natural host ranges of most viruses is likely incomplete due to the limited exposure of many animals which are geographically or ecologically isolated from the reservoir species in which the virus naturally circulates.",

            "text": "While disease ecologists have debated the best definition of a reservoir, one useful definition is an animal population that can maintain a virus in circulation and which may transmit to a target species such as humans [6, 7] . However, it is still notoriously difficult to identify true reservoirs in natural systems, and furthermore, our knowledge of the viruses infecting different animal species and populations has been changing rapidly in recent years, but we have little information about the likelihood of human infection for most viruses of animals. Before the advent of high-throughput sequencing techniques, most viruses were known due to their associations with disease or as a result of isolations in laboratory culture. More recently, unbiased metagenomic analysis of animalassociated samples, including tissues and faeces, has resulted in the discovery of many more viruses based on finding their nucleic acid sequences [1] [2] [3] . In addition to emergence in humans, there are many cases of viruses transferring between animals to cause outbreaks or epidemics in new hosts. Some human viruses can also be transferred to animals (as reverse zoonoses) to cause outbreaks directly, or to recombine or re-assort with sequences from other viruses of those animals to introduce altered host range properties-this has been commonly observed for IAVs [8] , as well as for metapneumovirus [9] . Some animals can be infected simultaneously by different viruses from humans and other animals, allowing recombination or reassortment, and those animals may therefore sometimes be referred to as 'mixing vessels' [10] . Those resulting viruses may have new host range, antigenic or transmission properties compared to either of their parental strains.",

For example, humans are frequently exposed to viruses of domesticated animals and to those of animals that live in our environment-but most never cause infections. Those exposures may be increasing due to anthopogenic effects (including but not limited to habitat destruction or climate change). Even for many known zoonotic viruses, it is likely that hundreds or even thousands of people are exposed for every person who is infected and who develops detectable disease. It is not always clear where the block to infection occurs, but some of the different possible barriers that viruses may encounter and overcome have been reviewed in [5] . However, it is clear that infection may be blocked at one or more steps in the infection process, including physical barriers, mucus of several types, ciliary and other clearance processes, natural antibodies to some viral glycoproteins or other viral [11] Human immunodeficiency virus non-human primate to human, two major events [12] Ebola virus bat to human, outbreaks, some extended epidemics bat to gorilla (to human) bat to duiker (to human) [13] MERS coronavirus camel to human, mostly spillover, some outbreaks [14] SARS coronavirus bat to palm civet to human, global spread but controlled [14] Nipah virus bat to swine epidemic, spillover to humans [15, 16] Canine parvovirus (CPV) carnivore to dog pandemic [17] Zika virus primate to human, adaptation to mosquito vector and humans resulted in epidemic [18] royalsocietypublishing.org/journal/rstb Phil. Trans. R. Soc. B 374: 20190017 components, innate immune responses that block virus establishment and infection, replication or shedding. Beyond the initial spillover infection, there is likely a second level of adaptation that is required to spread efficiently and cause an epidemic or pandemic. This review addresses both steps leading to successful emergence by outlining the host and viral factors that were associated with the emergence of three different viruses which have given rise to pandemics in new hosts. Those include an enveloped negative-sense single-stranded RNA virus (IAV), an enveloped RNA-genome retrovirus that replicates through a DNA intermediate (HIV) and a non-enveloped small single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) virus that replicates using host DNA polymerases (canine parvovirus (CPV)). Despite their different structures and replication strategies, each of those emerging viruses had to overcome common barriers to efficiently replicate and transmit in their new hosts, so that they illuminate the common, as well as the virus-unique, processes involved. Because of the limited space and the vast literatures that describe many of these viruses and their properties, we largely reference selected recent reviews; many specific references are contained within those reviews.",

Other epidemic strains have arisen in horses (H7N7 and H3N8), swine (besides the H1N1, there have been two different H3N2 strains and reassortant forms [22] ), seals and dogs (H3N8 and H3N2) [23] [24] [25] . Although there are IAVs in bats, those strains are not known to spread to other hosts [26] . Birds in fresh or salt water environments are the primary reservoirs of IAVs where infections are largely non-pathogenic, replicating in the gastrointestinal tract, and the viruses are shed into the water where they are taken up, likely by oral and respiratory routes, to infect other individuals [11, 21] . Apart from the bat viruses, all IAVs in mammalian species, including humans, ultimately originate from viruses in wild birds, either directly or via intermediate hosts.",

However, we have little information about the viruses circulating in birds or in other hosts prior to 1918, and it is also not clear if the 1918 IAV emerged in humans and then transferred to swine, or vice versa [21] . However, the H2N2 pandemic strain emerged in 1957 when the haemagglutinin (HA), neuraminidase (NA) and PB2 gene segments of the H1N1 virus were replaced by reassortment with one or more avian viruses, while in 1968, the HA and PB2 gene segments of that H2N2 virus were in turn replaced by those from an avian virus, giving rise to the H3N2 strain [11, 22, 27] . The H1N1 pandemic virus that emerged in 2009 had a complex history and contained segments from a variety of different host sources, including segments with swine, avian and human viral origins, and likely originated in swine in Mexico [10, 28] .",

Several different host barriers have been identified that were overcome by one or more emerging IAVs, and those have been recently comprehensively reviewed [11] , and also an assessment of pandemic risk has been developed [29] . The main pathways to human emergence are outlined in figure 1. Each epidemic in humans and most other mammals has initiated with a single virus genotype, and that virus is assumed to have overcome a number of barriers to become a well-adapted and transmissible virus of mammals. Across these known examples of animal influenza viruses overcoming host-specific differences to cause epidemics in humans, genetic changes have been identified in almost every step of the IAV replication cycle. Those include the animal environments that differ between the avian gastrointestinal tract which is around 418C, and the upper or lower respiratory tracts of mammals, which are approximately 34 or approximately 378C. Other differences include the display and binding of specific sialic acid receptors and linkage forms which influence haemagglutinin (HA) binding and neuraminidase (NA) cleavage, release of the viral ribonucleoproteins from the endosome and transport to the nucleus, RNA replication and/or transcription, antagonizing various interferon-associated innate immune responses, viral budding from the cell and release from the cell surface, shedding and transmission among individuals of that host [11] .",

The Sia found on human cells is the N-acetyl neuraminic acid, but in other hosts modified forms such as N-glycolyl neuraminic acid are also commonly found, while in some (horses and guinea pigs), there are high levels of an inhibitory Sia, Neu4,5Ac. Those structural differences may influence the binding of HA, and also inhibit the sialidase activity of the viral NA. A second level of receptor specificity comes from the linkage of the Sia to the glycan, which is commonly a2,6 in the upper respiratory tract (and a combination of a2,3 and a2,6 in the lower respiratory tract) in humans, but is most often a2,3 in the intestinal tract of birds and some other hosts. The switch in specificity from the a2,3 to the a2,6 Sia linkage seems to be a requirement for efficient human-to-human transmission [30] . A third receptorassociated inter-host difference is the length and branching of the glycan, and the number of Sia that are displayed [32, 33] . This may affect the binding of HA to the receptor as more branched and multi-Sia glycans can bind virus with higher affinity. The length of the glycan may also require a change in the structure of the NA tetramer, which tends to have shorter sequences in the stalk structure in viruses growing in avian tissues, and longer when the longer glycans in the human respiratory tract are encountered [11] .",

            "text": "Once taken into the cell, there are additional host factors that interact with the IAV components in a host-specific manner [11, 37] . While several important host factors have been identified, three that are well characterized are the tripartite motif-containing protein 25 (TRIM25) and the retinoic acidinducible gene I (RIG-I), which can bind the incoming viral ribonuleoproteins and reduce infection, and the MxA protein (in humans) which is a nuclear interferon-stimulated gene (ISG) that binds to the viral ribonuleoproteins to block infection. Viruses from birds or other hosts may be able to evade those factors through the acquisition of specific mutations in PB2 or nucleoprotein. During replication, IAVs induce additional host immune responses, in particular the interferon response, which triggers the expression of many different interferon-stimulated genes that can block many steps of the viral replication cycle. The IAV non-structural 1 protein is a multipurpose protein that can block or downregulate many of those responses, and evolution of NS1 occurs after transfer into new hosts to optimize the antagonism of the host innate immune response [11, 37, 38] . Some of these changes are likely to be involved in fine tuning the virus:host interaction after pandemic spread has already been accomplished [39] . For example, the ability of IAV NS1 to interact with the cellular cleavage and polyadenylation-specific factor 30 and inhibit host gene expression and interfering with the Janus kinase/signal transducers and activators of transcription (JAK/STAT) pathway have been shown to be an important mechanism of IAV host adaptation [40] .",

The processes underlying the transmission of influenza viruses are still not well understood, but likely require optimal receptor interactions and replication, along with the ability to survive in the respiratory secretions of the new host. In humans, the respiratory secretions that the virus is shed in have a relatively low pH (around 5.5), and a number of mutations in the interior of the HA trimer have been found that stabilize the HA at lower pHs and have been associated with the ability to transmit efficiently [41, 42] .",

The transfer to humans of the M strain was also associated with efficient cell infection, replication and transmission. Similarly, the transfer of the ancestor of the O strain from chimpanzees into gorillas appears to have allowed some additional adaptation, after which the virus transferred to humans.

Each of those steps involved multiple host barriers on the cellular level that the virus needed to overcome before efficient replication and spread were possible. Known host factors that are involved in cell infection and viral adaptation are the cluster of differentiation 4 (CD4) receptor, C-C chemokine receptor type 5 (CCR5) receptor, Tripartite motif-containing protein 5 a form (TRIM5a), apolipoprotein B mRNA editing enzyme, catalytic polypeptide-like (APOBEC) 3D, APOBEC F, APOBEC G, APOBEC 3H, SAM and HD Domain Containing Deoxynucleoside Triphosphate Triphosphohydrolase 1 (SAMHD1), Tetherin, human silencing hub (HUSH) RanBP2 [45] . Each has a degree of host specificity that required one or more modifications or countermeasures from the virus for successful emergence in one or more of the new hosts. The necessary adaptations were achieved through amino acid changes or by the acquisition or modification of viral accessory protein genes: for TRIM5a, this involved mutations in the capsid protein; for APOBECs, it required the presence of the Vif gene; SAMHD1 was countered by the viral Vpr; Tetherin by Nef and/or Vpu; human silencing hub (HUSH) complex by Vpr; RanBP2 interacted with the capsid protein and was countered by capsid mutations. There was also some specificity of attachment or use of the CCR5 protein co-receptor in different hosts [49] . The number of factors royalsocietypublishing.org/journal/rstb Phil. Trans. R. Soc. B 374: 20190017 viruses had to overcome or become adapted to indicates the complexity of the host-switching process, particularly for the M and O strains. Analysis of the complete SIV and HIV sequences searching for human-specific mutations has shown very few point mutations-indeed, it appears that there is only a single mutation in the gag protein (matrix-MA) associated specifically with adaptation to the human host [50, 51] . Each emergent strain, therefore, appears to have bridged the larger host barrier between monkeys and humans by gaining adaptive changes in intermediate hosts, likely allowing the virus to make successful spread among humans possible. However, it is likely that changes in human population demographics and behaviour allowed the spread of the M strain virus from the sites of emergence in central Africa into the rest of the world in the late 1970s and early 1980s.",

The parvoviruses are small non-enveloped viruses, which form a stable capsid of about 26 nm in diameter, that packages an ssDNA genome of about 5100 bases. The viral DNA replicates through linear double stranded DNA intermediates in the nucleus of the cell using the host cell DNA polymerases, most likely Pol d and some of the accessory polymerases such as the DNA polymerases h and k produced in response to DNA damage [52] . The example of interest is the emergence of the pandemic CPV in dogs, where the virus apparently spilled over from another host, gained the canine host range and spread worldwide in 1978. The parvovirus properties and many events surrounding the emergence of CPV have also been reviewed recently [53] , as well as earlier [27] . The viruses that gave rise to CPV have been known to infect many different hosts within the order Carnivora, and they were first found to cause disease in cats in the 1920s, in raccoons in the 1930s and in mink in the 1940s. Those viruses were variously named feline panleukopenia virus (FPV), raccoon parvovirus or mink enteritis virus, although it has long been recognized that those viruses are related and that viruses from one host could infect some other carnivore hosts. In 1978, new diseases of dogs were recognized which were seen in all regions of the world, with some dogs developing severe gastroenteritis with profuse bloody diarrhoea, while neonatal puppies developed a myocardial disease [54] . The cause was recognized as a parvovirus similar to FPV, which was named CPV type-2 (CPV-2) to distinguish it from the distantly related minute virus of canines, also known as canine bocavirus. Testing of dog sera collected from many parts of the world before 1978 showed positive antibodies in 1974 and 1976 in Europe, but none in other regions of the world until 1978. Sequence analysis showed that CPV was a new virus in dogs, and that all viruses in dogs share a common ancestor present around the mid-1970s, and they were greater than 99% identical to the FPV-like viruses [55, 56] .",

All of these viruses cause a systemic infection in animals, infecting through the oro-nasal route, replicating in and spreading between tissues that contain dividing cells, including the lymphoid tissues and the rapidly dividing cells in the crypts of the small intestinal villae [54] . The virus is shed in the faeces of the infected animal, where it is able to survive for long periods allowing efficient transport on fomites. While FPV-like viruses do not bind and infect canine cells in tissue culture, they may replicate in dogs in some tissues after natural exposure, primarily in the thymus [62] . Replication in those internal tissues did not result in efficient shedding of the virus, so those infections are dead-end spillovers.

Viruses produced in one host will carry an imprinted source glycosylation that is determined by the specific cell or tissue they are produced in.

Processes involved may include the structures and functions of the respiratory secretions that generate aerosols, droplets, or dried particles, materials in faeces and the environment that influence faecal-oral transmission, the nature of the virus-containing materials involved in direct transmission, as well as other viral, host or environmental factors. Persistent infection and shedding provides prolonged opportunities for transmission (e.g. by HIV), while acutely infecting viruses (such as IAV and CPV) are only shed for a few days, so that contact is required (IAV) or survival in faecal matter (CPV). There are many details of transmission that need to be determined, including the physical nature of the shed virus and host components, and the roles of different regions of the respiratory or gastrointestinal tract (or other sites) in facilitating transmission. Invertebrate vectors may impose an addition level of host adaptation, but they may facilitate the spread of a virus in a new host population. All of these potential interactions are still poorly understoodand studying combinations of factors is challenging in experimental animal models of infection and transmission. The host population structures (of both donor and recipient) play key roles in viral emergence. The density and connectedness of the new host population may determine whether viruses emerge rather than die out. This is particularly true for viruses causing acute infections, which are more prone to burn out before spreading to new patches of host population [65] . Changes in hosts and host populations that alter the likelihood of emergence include population size, density, mobility, behaviour such as sexual practices, and connectedness. Transmission heterogeneity is likely important early in outbreaks of new viruses, when stochastic events will often determine the outcome, and in particular, 'superspreaders' may create a large number of secondary infections that allow viruses to overcome demographic barriers [66, 67] . Specific control or reduction in those events may be particularly effective in the early control of outbreaks, but that hinges on the identification of potential superspreaders early.",

Those confirm that the replication of many viruses is relatively low fidelity and creates many mutations, providing significant amounts of genetic variation in most viral populations. While RNA viruses and retroviruses show frequent mutations and recombination or reassortment, it is now clear that sequence variation is also common in both ssDNA and double-stranded DNA viruses [68] . We are rapidly gaining new insights into the complexities of viral royalsocietypublishing.org/journal/rstb Phil. Trans. R. Soc.

As described above, and reviewed elsewhere [72, 73] , the emergence of new epidemic viruses requires host adaptive mutations, recombination or reassortment, or the acquisition of modifications and accessory genes. Retrospective analysis indicates that those changes occur during the early stages of infection and spread in the new host or within an intermediate host, and that those are required to give increased replication and transmission. It is not generally possible to identify those key mutations before virus emergence, but we can now identify adaptive mutations required for initial epidemic spread, or for additional 'fine tuning' of the host range [39] .

The transfer of viruses into new hosts involves the traversing of complex fitness landscapes between old and new hosts and/or invertebrate vectors. Models of emerging epidemic viruses, including those outlined here, show that the process is complex and generally involves multiple steps. Each epidemic examined initiated from a single ancestral virus that made the transition to successful replication and spread in the new host by overcoming a number of barriers, in the form of host-specific proteins or processes that differed between the reservoir and the new outbreak host. Transferred viruses, therefore, had low fitness in their new hosts, and that was improved by the acquisition of multiple mutations, more often in several genes. Intermediate hosts are clearly involved in many examples that have been examined, and those may both give greater exposure to the new outbreak host, and reduce the fitness valley that must be traversed.",

Integrated models of spillover and early transmission can be paired with a knowledge of animal and human viruses. Key challenges include methods to distinguish cases infected directly from animal spillovers (primary cases) and secondary cases resulting from human-to-human transmission, and methods to estimate transmissibility, which are often difficult to obtain at the start of an epidemic. By clarifying the series of steps that are required to go from exposure to spillover to epidemic or pandemic, new models should identify multiple points where strategic interventions could allow us to forestall new viruses before they can emerge to create widespread epidemics.",

Mucus is composed of a variety of different glycans and proteins, which differ widely between various hosts and their tissues. Mucus composition and susceptibility to viral infection also vary depending on the health of the individual, the presence of resident commensal microflora and coinfections, and physiological stressors. Many viruses carry glycosidases, sialidases, or esterases that act as countermeasures against mucin glycans upon entry as well as during egress and shedding of viral particles. Mixed infections of newly transferred viruses with other viruses or bacteria may alter the host mucus and facilitate infection.",
