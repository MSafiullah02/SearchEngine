As the baseline CT scores were higher in umifenovir group, stratified analysis based on CT scores were performed to correct this bias between two groups. The results of stratified analysis supported that umifenovir therapy was not superior over supportive therapy treatment in terms of radiology improvement. The results were consistent with a previous study which found that 5 days\u2019 umifenovir treatment did not increase the negative rate of pharyngeal swab\u2019s test within 1 week15. In our study, even the patients who had longer treatment duration (7-10 days) with umifenovir did not experience better outcomes.",

Umifenovir is a hemagglutinin inhibitor, which can specifically inhibit the fusion of the virus with the host cell membrane and inhibit the synthesis of viral DNA and RNA. It can also induce the production of interferon and play a role in regulation of immune system. Combined with drugs with different antiviral mechanisms, umifenovir may show an improved efficacy, but as a trade-off, the potential adverse effect may increase during treatment12.",
