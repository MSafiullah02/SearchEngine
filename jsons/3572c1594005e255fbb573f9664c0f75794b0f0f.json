At the same time, people is using Social Networks to express what they think, feel or experiment, so this people are Social Sensors and helps to analyze what is happening in their city. The objective of this paper is analyze the publications of Colombian people living in Bogota with a radius of 50 km using Text Mining techniques from symptomatology approach. The results support the understanding of the spread in Colombia related to symptoms of covid19.",
