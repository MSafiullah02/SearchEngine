Despite the lower mortality rate of SARS when compared with HIV,16 SARS is much more communicable in health care settings through droplet-based transmission.17 The outbreaks caused suspension of clinical services, and quarantines were rampant. Our results identified that physicians\u2019 main concerns were the decreased ability to care for non-SARS patients during the outbreaks and personal loss of income, both of which are novel concerns not raised in the literature regarding other infectious diseases. Consistent with the HIV literature however,11 almost a third of physicians were concerned about spreading the infection to their family. In addition, almost one-fifth reported experiencing new distressing psychological symptoms as a result of their potential occupational exposure (almost 50% among those providing direct care). Remarkably, few physicians reevaluated their career choice, and most felt it was their duty to treat these infectious patients regardless of the personal risks.",

It may be that some physicians worked for financial reasons despite SARS-like symptoms, since most Canadian physicians work in a fee-for-service system (with a government payor). As some governments are now reimbursing a variety of workers for lost income due to the SARS outbreaks, consideration should be given to policy regarding timely guarantees of income for physicians during future virulent infectious outbreaks.",

When asked about the best aspect of the outbreak, 40% of physicians conveyed the increased collegiality and teamwork that ensued. This extended to appreciation of allied health, nursing, and administrative leaders. Comments centered around camaraderie, courage, professionalism, dedication to patient care, altruism, cooperation, mutual support, unity in a common cause, the spirit of pulling together through a crisis, and rising to the challenge. Other beneficial aspects included having more time for research, reading, paperwork, writing, and relaxation. A few physicians amusingly noted the decrease in rounds and meetings and shorter waiting times for elevators.",

Physicians with children in the home appeared to feel more vulnerable and need more psychosocial support. Targeted interventions should be explored to help physicians cope with their fear of infectivity and the risks to their families. While physicians should not be pathologized, offering a support or discussion group through the use of web-based technology could be evaluated as a potential means of offering support without the risk of transmission. Also, posting a question-and-answer page on the hospital intranet outlining how to talk with children about these risks might be useful. Future research should evaluate the most effective ways of offering support to reduce the psychosocial impact on physicians and their families.",
