            "text": "Bovine respiratory disease (BRD) in calves represents an important cause of economic losses for the dairy industry worldwide due to costs associated with reduced weight gain, farm labor, treatment, prophylaxis, and high morbidity and mortality rates [[1], [2], [3], [4]]. Bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV), bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV), bovine alphaherpesvirus 1 (BoHV-1), bovine coronavirus (BCoV), and bovine parainfluenza virus 3 (BPIV-3) are the main viral pathogens infecting the bovine respiratory system [[5], [6], [7]]. Mannheimia haemolytica, Pasteurella multocida, Histophilus somni, and Mycoplasma bovis are the major bacteria involved in secondary infection of the respiratory tract and are associated with pneumonia in young dairy calves [6,8,9]. These etiological agents may cause a single infection or act in synergy in coinfections, enhancing the severity of the disease [10,11]. Although BRD may affect cattle of different ages, it is more commonly diagnosed in calves up to 3 months, and the peak of the disease usually occurs between 4 and 6 weeks of age [2,12,13].",

The calves of the calf rearing unit were divided into 3 groups based on age, between 6-30 days, 31-60 days and over 60 days. At least four BALF samples per age group were collected at random including asymptomatic and symptomatic calves. The collection procedures of BALF samples were conducted by veterinarians at the Universidade Estadual de Londrina, Paran\u00e1, Brazil, including a trained veterinary surgeon, in a single visit to the rearing unit. The samples were placed in sterile tubes, shipped on ice baths and stored at \u221280 \u00b0C until processing.",

Additionally, serology tests in young cattle may interfere with colostral antibodies and cross-reactions of pathogens with other commensal microorganisms, making interpretation of test results difficult [41]. Classical virus and bacterial isolation methods are laborious and time-consuming [44]. Among the antemortem diagnostic procedures applicable to BRD-affected calves, molecular techniques may be considered the most appropriate due to their fast and reliable results, facilitating actions to define preventive and therapeutic strategies in Brazilian herds [45].",

The most frequent mixed infections were between viruses and bacteria (55.5%), which shows the synergism of these infectious agents in BRD, similar to severe pneumonia in children and puppies [49,50]. Single viruses associated with BRD are rarely lethal to cattle. Severe pneumonia usually occurs when commensal bacteria from the nasopharynx invade the lower airways of cattle after stressful conditions and viral infections. These predisposing factors affect the host defense mechanisms by altering mucosal surface components and decreasing the activity of innate immune system cells, such as T lymphocytes, B-lymphocytes, monocytes, and macrophages, thereby increasing the exposure to pathogens [9].",

Multiple strains of BVDV have been reported in cattle from the same geographic region of the calf rearing unit, such as BVDV 1a, BVDV 1b, and BVDV 1d, associated with reproductive failure in cows [55]. Within these subgenotypes, BVDV 1b was suggested be predominantly associated with BRD in calves [56]. However, the phylogenetic analysis performed using 5\u2019UTR sequences of BVDV strains in the BALF samples of the current BRD outbreak clustered with the BVDV 1d subgenotype. Furthermore, susceptible calves do not become ill until 5 weeks of age after exposure to BVDV virulent strains when passive immunity is acquired, even supposing that low virus replication may occur in these animals [57]. However, in the present study, BVDV was detected in BALF samples of calves in the first weeks of age. This finding may be due a failure in the transfer passive antibodies to the newborn calves due to colostrum deprivation, low intake or even the lack of immunity of the cow with the different strains of BVDV, this can make the calves susceptible the infection occurs in the first weeks of life. Also, infection of these calves with different BVDV strains of their herds of origin, since cross-protection between different BVDV subgenotypes is incomplete [54,55].",

P. multocida, M. bovis, and H. somni were detected in single or in mixed infections with other BRD pathogens. These results need to be considered with caution, as P. multocida and M. haemolytica are eventually listed as a primary agent of BRD, being more often considered opportunistic pathogens, and contributing to the increase of clinical signs in outbreaks [5,15]. Our study differs from another study that evaluated bacteria present in the lower respiratory tract of healthy and diseased calves with BRD in Brazil, in which Enterobacteriaceae were the predominant bacteria in BALF samples [21]. However, these bacteria are not associated with outbreaks of BRD. Similar results to this study were obtained by another recent Brazilian study, nasal swabs from cattle with BRD were analyzed and found the presence of H. somni, BRSV, BCoV, and M. haemolytica in single infections or co-infections [18].",

Diagnoses of M. bovis are difficult cultivate due to overgrowth of contaminants in nutritionally complex media after a long period of incubation [34,59]. The current study presents an alternative to detect M. bovis specifically in BALF samples by nested PCR and differentiate it from other species of mycoplasmas that are opportunistic and/or commensals of the respiratory tract.",

In association with this condition, potential risk factors for BRD previously described were detected at the rearing unit [12,13,61]. This unit includes automatic milk feeders with a common nipple, large group pens (>12 calves), older calves housed with younger calves, and calves from various sources with unknown sanitary status.",

A study with M. bovis isolated from young cattle in France revealed that 100% of recent strains are resistant to common antibiotics used to control BRD [62]. Thus, it may be suggested that when calves are challenged with so many etiological agents and in the presence of risk factors, simple maternal immunity and broad-spectrum antimicrobial drugs may not be sufficient to control BRD in calves. However, an essential tool for prevention is the use of commercial vaccines against the main pathogens that cause respiratory, bacterial, and viral diseases. These vaccines should be administered mainly to cows in the final period of pregnancy, to promote the transfer of immunoglobulins by colostrum. In addition, it is essential to ensure the intake of an adequate amount of colostrum soon after the calves are born. Finally, all preventive measures together can help to reduce the number of susceptible animals and the excretion of microorganisms, in addition to reducing the risk of BRD occurring mainly in the critical phases, which are transport and grouping in the calf rearing unit [17,63].",

The diversity of potentially pathogenic microorganisms for the respiratory tract of calves identified mainly in mixed infections in conjunction with the risk factors present in this calf rearing unit may explain the high morbidity rate and the difficulty in the treatment of calves in this BRD outbreak. The use of a molecular diagnostic platform provided the rapid and reliable identification of several microorganisms involved in the BRD outbreak. Further studies focusing on the characterization of etiological agents detected in BRD are extremely important to clarify the circulating strains in epidemiological studies. The elucidation of the plurality of infectious agents that may be involved in BRD outbreaks in dairy calves highlights the importance of adopting preventive measures for BRD control, particularly in calf-rearing units where heifer calves from diverse origins and with distinct health and immunological status are grouped together in the same rearing system.",
