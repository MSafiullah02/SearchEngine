In urology, many 81 issues are very intimate and it is vital to establish 82 adequate doctor-patient rapport. 83 ii 84 Telemedicine communication skills: As telemedicine 85 is a new tool we will have to master communication 86 via video. 87 iii 88 Integrated practice units (IPUs): The world of 89 medicine is moving towards value-based medicine. 90 What this essentially means is shifting the focus 91 from the volume and profitability of services 92 provided-physician visits, hospitalizations, and 93 procedures-to the patient outcomes achieved 94 [6]. As a field, we should seize the opportunities 95 provided by telecommunication and technology to 96 transform our approach. At the core of value transformation is changing 97 the way we are organized. In urology, this requires a 98 shift from the current organization by service to 99 organization around the patient's medical condition. 100 This structure is termed an IPU. In an IPU, a dedicated 101 team made up of clinical and nonclinical personnel 102 provides the full care cycle for the patient's condi-103 tion. Many institutes already have multidisciplinary 104 uro-oncology clinics, so moving to IPUs would be an 105 easy transition.",
