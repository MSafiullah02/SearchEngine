HCMV causes morbidities and mortalities in immunocompromised individuals such as transplant recipients and acquired immune deficiency syndrome patients (Landolfo et al., 2003, Davis et al., 1987). HCMV surface glycoprotein ligands interact with cellular receptors to produce multiple cell growth and inflammatory signals that are reactivated once HCMV immediate-early proteins are expressed (Evers et al., 2004). Many of the pathways that HCMV employs to activate cell growth and inflammatory events are required for viral replication and may be useful targets for antiviral drug development.",

A number of biological properties have been described (or proposed) for various flavonoids. These include antioxidative, antiinflammatory, antiproliferative, and vasculoprotective effects (Gabor, 1986, Formica and Regelson, 1995), and specific modulation of the activities of a number of cellular enzymes, including inhibition of protein kinases (Middleton et al., 2000).",

            "text": "Two properties of flavonoids predicted possible antiviral activity against HCMV. First, the replication of multiple viruses is inhibited by various flavonoids. Genistein was active against bovine herpesvirus type 1 (Akula et al., 2002). 5,6,7-Trimethoxyflavone inhibited herpes simplex virus (HSV), HCMV, and poliovirus (Hayashi et al., 1997). Quercetin was active against herpes simplex, adeno-, respiratory syncytial (RSV), Rous sarcoma, Sindbis, pseudorabies, and parainfluenza viruses (Chiang et al., 2003, Formica and Regelson, 1995). Luteolin and quercetin inhibited the SARS coronavirus (Yi et al., 2004). Kaempferol and its derivatives inhibited HSV, HCMV, and poliovirus (Amoros et al., 1992, Mitrocotsa et al., 2000, Robin et al., 2001). Antiviral activity against several herpesviruses and respiratory viruses was reported for a series of biflavonoids (Lin et al., 1999). Several glycosylated flavonoids were active against RSV or influenza A H1N1 (Wei et al., 2004). Second, flavonoids affect signal transduction pathways that are required for HCMV replication. The effects of various flavonoids upon receptor tyrosine kinases, PI3-K, Akt, MAPKs, transcription factors, and prostaglandins vary according to the compound, compound concentration, stimulus, and cell type (Formica and Regelson, 1995, Middleton et al., 2000).",

Western blot analyses revealed that all three kinetic classes of HCMV proteins were reduced to nearly background levels by baicalein (Fig. 2\n). Fifty micromoles genistein reproducibly resulted in slightly lower levels of IE1-72 at 24 h post infection (hpi). IE2-86 levels were more sensitive to genistein, but were never reduced by more than 65%. Since IE1-72 is present prior to IE2-86 (Cherrington and Mocarski, 1989), we reasoned that the mechanism of action for genistein might be direct inhibition of IE1-72. IE1-72 is a protein kinase that autophosphorylates (Pajovic et al., 1997). We reproducibly detected substantially the same amounts phosphorylated relative to total IE1-72 in the presence and absence of genistein (Fig. 2). In contrast to its effects upon immediate-early proteins, genistein treatment resulted in an unambiguous block to HCMV early and late proteins. This flavonoid reduced UL84 and UL94 proteins to nearly background levels at 48 and 72 hpi, respectively (Fig. 2).",

We infected cells in the presence of baicalein and genistein, and 72 hpi the media was replaced with drug-free media. Samples were harvested on each of 6 days: 3 days in the presence of flavonoids, and 3 days of release from drug pressure (Fig. 3b). Input virus in these experiments was similar to that in Fig. 3a, however, films were under exposed in Fig. 3b so that the signal of virus controls would not be saturated at 5\u20136 days post infection. Upon release from genistein inhibition, HCMV DNA replication resumed and increased over time delayed approximately 48 h after virus controls, suggesting that the genistein block occurred at about 24 hpi. Low levels of rebound viral DNA were present upon release from baicalein inhibition, suggesting that the antiviral effects of baicalein were poorly reversible.

This was evidenced by increased levels of cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (cdk2), cyclin E, and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), as well as cellular DNA levels consistent with a block at either G1/S or G2/M (Jault et al., 1995, Dittmer and Mocarski, 1997). Cell cycle arrest was reproduced in cells transfected with IE2-86 (Wiebusch and Hagemeier, 1999). IE1-72 and IE2-86 have roles in the disruption of a variety of cell cycle regulatory pathways (Castillo et al., 2000). HCMV immediate-early proteins induce the p53 tumor suppressor protein (Muganda et al., 1994, Speir et al., 1994), and p53 levels may provide some measure of immediate-early protein transactivation. We measured the ability of baicalein, genistein, and control viral DNA replication inhibitor ganciclovir to inhibit HCMV-mediated cell cycle regulatory protein induction at 24 hpi by immunoblotting (Fig. 4\n). Increases in the steady-state levels of cdk2, cyclin E, p53, and PCNA were not affected by treatment with ganciclovir. The activation of these proteins by HCMV was inhibited by both baicalein and genistein. Genistein treatment did not always result in full inhibition of HCMV induction of these proteins (Fig. 4), however, none were increased to levels reflecting those of immediate-early proteins as compared to HCMV positive controls in response to genistein (Fig. 2).",

This compound inhibits HCMV replication at the stage of viral DNA replication via the inhibition of HCMV-specific DNA polymerase, it does not inhibit immediate-early or early gene expression. Because the expression of reporter enzyme, \u03b2-galactosidase in RC256 HCMV-infected cells is under early (\u03b2-)promoter control, thus, the colorimetric assay can not faithfully measure the inhibitory effects of certain compounds that act on the DNA replication or L stage of virus replication. In contrast to its effects upon viral DNA (Fig. 3) and titer (Table 1), the colorimetric assay detected little antiviral activity for positive control ganciclovir. A reproducible IC50 of 9 \u03bcM was reported for ganciclovir in the original description of this assay (Hippenmeyer and Dilworth, 1996). In our adapted assay, we examined ganciclovir ten times and nine times obtained an IC50 of >100 \u03bcM (Table 1 and data not shown). It is possible that different infection conditions were responsible for this discrepancy. They infected fibroblasts by centrifuging virus (0.05 pfu/cell) onto trypsinized cell pellets, while we infected by adding supernatant virus (1.2 pfu/cell) to the media of adherent cells. Infecting cells with HCMV by centrifugation was elsewhere shown to accelerate (viral DNA replication was detectable at 16 instead of 56 hpi) and amplify (30\u201350 fold increased HCMV protein staining) HCMV replication (Ho et al., 1993, Gleaves et al., 1989).

Since naringenin was essentially inactive in both antiviral assays, it is possible that anti-HCMV activity requires aromatic conjugation or coplanar arrangement of the benzene rings. While baicalein was the most potent compound, it lost only 10-fold activity when conjugated to glucuronic acid at the 7 position (baicalin). Similarly, 3-glycosides of kaempferol were active against HCMV and less toxic than the parent compound (Mitrocotsa et al., 2000).

The antiviral effects of genistein and baicalein were fully and poorly reversible, respectively (Fig. 3b). However, pre-incubation of virus with baicalein (or genistein) did not result in marked inhibition of HCMV. This suggested that baicalein did not directly inactivate virus particles.",

Genistein had an IC50 of 22 \u03bcM against the phosphorylation of histone H2B by purified EGFR in a test tube, and an IC50 of 111 \u03bcM against EGF-stimulated EGFR autophosphorylation in human epidermoid carcinoma cells (Akiyama et al., 1987). These differences from our experimental conditions may explain this discrepancy. Additionally, EGF and the HCMV gB glycoprotein specifically recognize different species of ErbB homo- and hetero-oligomers (Wang et al., 2003).",

This study supports further inquiries into the possibility that flavonoid(s) may assist in clearing HCMV infections as well as other possible health benefits.
