These viruses have genome sizes ranging from 28 to 32 kb, which makes them the biggest among the RNA viruses (1). The genomes contain five major open reading frames (Orfs) that encode the replicase polyproteins (Orf 1a and Orf 1ab), spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N) proteins, in that order. Based on antigenic and genetic analyses, coronaviruses can be subdivided into three groups. Coronaviruses from groups 1 and 2 have been found to infect mammals. By contrast, avian species are known to be the natural hosts for group 3 viruses. Most coronaviruses hosts (2,3) . Animal coronaviruses are known to cause respiratory, gastrointestinal, neurological, and hepatic diseases. By contrast, with the exception of SARS coronavirus, in the case of healthy individuals all previously known human coronaviruses were generally only associated with mild respiratory and gastrointestinal diseases.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [{"start": 695, "end": 706, "text": "hosts (2,3)", "ref_id": "FIGREF3"}], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "The discovery of a novel coronavirus as the cause of SARS led to a resurgence in interest in these viruses and to the discovery of other novel coronaviruses in humans, namely NL-63 and HKU-1 (4-6). The recognition of SARS-like coronaviruses in palm civets and other small mammals in live-game animal markets (7) prompted intensive surveillance for coronaviruses in wild animals. Following upon this interesting discovery, several novel coronaviruses were identified in the mammalian and avian species (6, (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) (13) (14) (15) (16) (17) . In particular, our initial studies first revealed that bats are important reservoirs for coronaviruses. By screening respiratory and fecal samples collected from a wide range of animals, we identified the first coronavirus in bats (14) . Subsequent studies by ourselves and others also indicated that there are number of group 1 and group 2 viruses circulating in bat species (11, 12, 15, 17) . In particular, a SARS-like coronavirus was found in two of these studies independently (11, 12) . These results suggest that bats might play a key role in the evolution of coronaviruses.

Viral transport medium contains a high concentration of antibiotic to inhibit bacterial growth. 2. Buffer AVL containing carried RNA might form white precipitates when it is stored at 4 \u2022 C. The precipitates can be dissolved in the buffer by heating the bottle in a water bath. Cool the buffer to room temperature before use. 3. Ethidium bromide is a known mutagen and may be carcinogenic. Handle solutions of ethidium bromide with gloves. 4. For reasons of safety, staffs who are required to handle animals should have the appropriate inoculations (e.g., rabies vaccine for handling bats). Appropriate protective equipment should be worn when handling animals. 5. Bats are protected species in Hong Kong, and a permit from the relevant governmental office is required to perform the work. 6 . For some small bat species, the finest swabs used in our studies are still too big to fit into the anal opening. In this situation, we use fecal instead of anal samples. To minimize possible contamination, these bats are kept individually in clean cotton bags for a few minutes. Fecal pellets collected in the cotton bags are sampled for further analysis. 7. In our study, we also tried to isolate viruses from our samples. As some viruses might be sensitive to repeat freeze and thaw cycles, we normally aliquot the original samples into two separate tubes. One tube is kept at -80 \u2022 C for long-term storage and the other is kept at 4 \u2022 C until it is ready for RNA extraction and virus isolation. 8. Contents in fecal samples and calcium alginate in swabs are known to inhibit RT-PCR assays. One should validate the protocols and test the reagents with specimens spiked with positive samples in advance. RNA purified from our recommended RNA extraction kit work well for us. 9. General procedures to prevent PCR cross-contamination should be strictly followed. Aerosol-resistant filtered pipette tips could minimize possible carryover of amplicons. Separate pipettes and areas are used for sample processing, PCR, and post-PCR analysis. It is essential to include multiple positive and negative controls in the PCR reactions when a large number of samples are tested at the same time. 10. Agarose solutions can be superheated in a microwave oven. Do not handle the bottle immediately after microwaving. Always wear heat-resistant gloves when handling melted agarose. 11. UV light can cause severe skin and eye damage. Wear safety glasses and close the photography hood before turning on the UV transilluminator. 12. Purified PCR products from Section 3.7 can be directly subjected to DNA sequencing. As quiescent species were found in our studied bat samples, we observed several single nucleotide polymorphisms in the products. To obtain more accurate sequencing data for our phylogenetic analysis, PCR products from these reactions were cloned into vectors (Section 3.8) and several clones from the same PCR reaction were randomly selected for further analysis. 13. On some occasions, nonspecific PCR products might be observed (lane 8, Fig. 1 ) and the desired PCR products have to be recovered by direct excisions from the agarose gel. As UV can damage DNA, it is important to use low-energy UV light to visualize and locate the desired product in this scenario. Try to excise the product as quickly as possible. We normally purify the excised products using a QIAquick gel extraction kit (Qiagen). The purified products can be subjected to cloning or sequencing as noted. 14. The products should be sequenced in both directions. 15.
