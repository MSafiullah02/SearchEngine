            "text": "Previously, cumulative skew diagrams have been employed successfully to analyze mutational patterns in various viral genomes. They have been used to: (i) link the nucleotide content changes to the genome organization, replication and transcription of double-stranded DNA viruses [1]; (ii) correlate the transcriptional pattern of a bacteriophage T7 with its nucleotide content [2]; and (iii) associate the compositional biases with mutational pressures in retroviruses [3]. (See Box 1\non how to interpret cumulative diagrams.)Box 1Box 1. Interpreting cumulative skew diagramsCumulative skew diagrams 1, 7, 8 can simplify the interpretation of biases in nucleotide sequence. An example of such bias is GC skew, which is a measure of the relative excess of guanines against cytosines on one sequence strand. It is calculated as ([G]\u2212[C])/([G]+[C]), where [G] and [C] represent the occurrence of the guanines and cytosines within a specified sequence window.Such biases have been reported for bacteria 7, 20, 21 and double-stranded (ds) DNA viruses 1, 21, and interpreted as evidence of asymmetry in mutation pressure because skew changes the polarity at the replication origin. The GC skew has been linked to the time the DNA strand spends in a single-stranded state [7], for example, during replication or transcription because cytosine deamination is much faster in single-stranded (ss) DNA compared with dsDNA (see 22, 23 for in-depth reviews of the underlying mechanisms).Cumulative skew represents a numerical integration of the skew value across the genome and replaces the most significant changes in polarity by global maxima and minima. For example, a non-cumulative plot of GC skew is shown in Figure Ia\nfor the genome of the virus SV40, where GC skew changes sign at a point near the 50% coordinate. It is unclear which of the multiple local polarity switches in the middle of the plot is actually the global switch. On the cumulative GC skew plot Figure Ib these polarity switches are seen to correspond to local minima and maxima on the GC diagram. The global maximum at 54% clearly separates two genome segments with the opposite deviations from the parity [G]=[C], and the slopes of the opposite linear trends on the GC diagram correspond to the respective mean GC skews for the two genome segments. GC skew is positive for the leading (left-hand side of the GC diagram) and negative for the lagging strand, as is the case with microbial genomes.The two segments of the GC diagram also correspond to the divergently transcribed coding sequences of SV40. Note that the slopes of the two halves of the GC diagram are different. The excess of G compared with C in the leading strand in the late mRNA region of SV40 is almost half of the excess of C compared with G in the lagging strand in the early mRNA region. This suggests a contribution of transcription to the overall picture.Even more illustrative interplay of replication and transcription is a seen in a cumulative diagram of human papillomavirus [1]\nFigure Ic. Although the replication is bi-directional (from 0 or 100% on the diagram), transcription is unidirectional: all papillomavirus genes are transcribed from one strand. If there are separate biases induced by replication and transcription, they should act in the same direction in one half of a papillomavirus genome, and in the opposite directions in the other half. This model explains the observed behavior in Figure Ic such that the steeper slopes on the left-hand side reflect a sum of the net contributions of replication and transcription, and the right-hand side of the diagrams corresponds to their subtraction, where their effects almost cancel each other out (a near-horizontal cumulative plot corresponding to zero mean GC skew).The same rules apply to the analysis of RNA viral genomes. For example, for plus-strand RNA viruses the events taking place on the minus strand can be taken into account in much the same way as is done for the second strand of dsDNA. Because GC skew measures the level of cytosine depletion on one strand relative to its complementary strand, changes in the diagram shape enable researchers to infer the contribution of processes occurring on both strands, even in taxonomical orders of single-stranded viruses.",

            "text": "The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) plus-strand genomic RNA (plus-gRNA) consists of two distinct parts: one (comprising two thirds of the genome) encodes the replicase polyprotein and the other encodes structural and other proteins 4, 5. In this paper, these parts are referred to as the long and short arm, respectively. Strikingly, there is a change in behavior of the cumulative skew diagram at the border of the arms in all coronaviruses sequenced to date (six representatives are shown in Figure 1), indicating a lower GC skew on the short arm. This behavior suggests that biological processes that distinguish the two arms (Box 2) are responsible for the mutational pattern, rather than the fidelity of the replication machinery; the latter not would result in a constant slope of cumulative skew, as is the case in retroviruses [3]. The mutation rates (as indicated by the extent of the cumulative skew on the y-axis) do not appear to depend on a host organism: skews are similar in murine, avian and human 229E coronaviruses (Figure 1c,e,f) but substantially lower in SARS-CoV (Figure 1a, Table 1).Box 2Box 2. Coronavirus replication and transcription in SARS-CoVThe genome of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) is a plus-strand genome RNA (plus-gRNA) of \u223c30 Kbp in length. Translation of the replicase polyprotein on the long arm of the genome is followed by minus-gRNA synthesis and transcription from the short arm. The long and short arms of the SARS-CoV genome are shown, together with the transcriptional products [eight subgenomic mRNAs (sgmRNAs)], in Figure Ia\n[16].Transcription on the short arm produces a nested set of 3\u2032-coterminal sgmRNAs, containing at their 5\u2032-end a short leader sequence derived from the 5\u2032-end of the genome. A process for one of the subgenomic mRNAs is shown in Figure Ib\n10, 11, 12. After a minus-strand sgmRNA is synthesized on the short arm, a template switch enables the completion of the synthesis of the leader sequence (shown as open box on the left-hand side), skipping the long arm.The relative levels of transcription and replication in coronaviruses mean that subgenomic mRNAs are by far the most abundant coronavirus RNAs in the cell, whereas the genome-length negative strand RNA (minus-gRNA) is the least abundant (it is \u223c10% of the level of plus-gRNA) [24]. These levels and localization of transcriptional activity are likely to be linked to the difference in mutation rates on the short and long arms (see main text).",

Most probably, this reflects higher rates of cytosine deamination on the minus-strand related to subgenomic mRNA synthesis. The intracellular duplex of minus-gRNA with plus-gRNA protects them from cytosine deamination. If the first stage of transcription, which involves subgenomic mRNA template synthesis from the plus-gRNA, leaves minus-gRNA on the short arm as a single strand (Box 2, Figure I), then cytosine deamination will lead to the accumulation of uracils on minus-gRNA. Subsequently, synthesis of the new viral plus-gRNA from minus-gRNA will propagate these mutations, depleting guanines and decreasing the overall GC skew on the short arm of the plus strand. This explanation concurs with the model of subgenomic mRNA synthesis from minus-strand subgenomic RNA templates 9, 10, for which there is experimental evidence in arteviruses [11] and murine hepatitis virus (MHV) [12]. The rate of cytosine deamination that is related to sgmRNA synthesis is likely to be proportional to the difference between the slopes of the curves in the long and short arms (Table 1).",

More than 80% of these differences correspond to the third base of a codon, indicating mutational pressure. I analyzed the distribution of these 107 positions and found that 59 of them localized to the short arm, suggesting an \u223c2.5-fold increase in polymorphisms on that arm. Most of these polymorphisms (85, \u223c80%) correspond to a C to U substitution on one of the strands, further emphasizing the role of cytosine deamination as the primary mutational force in coronaviruses.",

The cause is probably not in the host because another human coronavirus (229E) does not appear different from the other viruses examined (Figure 1e). Could the parameters of the virus-encoded RNA synthesis machinery, such as the speed of replication or transcription, or their relative turnover be responsible for this difference? The level of cytosine deamination, reflected in GC skew, has been hypothesized to depend on the time a DNA strand spends in a single-stranded state 1, 7, 8 (Box 1), and the same is probably true for RNA. Although the relative contribution of transcription in SARS-CoV is similar to that in other coronaviruses (Table 1, column L-S), the effect of replication is much lower (Table 1, column L). This suggests that either minus-strand synthesis is faster or plus-strand replication is slower in SARS or their relative turnover is lower compared with the synthesis of subgenomic mRNA template RNA.",
