[1] . Authors introduced a very comprehensive analysis on elective surgery for digestive cancer during COVID-19 pandemic [1] . In particular, they highlighted both broad and specific strategies (esophagogastric, hepato-bilio-pancreatic and colorectal surgery) for intraoperative and postoperative care of ''surgical environment'' [1] .",

Among COVID-19 patients requiring hospitalization, 69% showed an abnormal chest x-ray at the initial time of admission and 80% showed radiographic abnormalities in the course of hospitalization [6] . X-ray findings are most extensive 10-12 days from symptom onset [6] . Most patients had a negative CT in the two days following symptom onset with ground-glass opacities developing between day 0 and day 4 following symptom onset and peaking between 6-13 days [7] . Therefore, negative CT should not be used to rule out COVID-19, particularly in the early stage of disease [7] . Reported CT sensitivities and specificities for COVID-19 vary widely: they range from 60% to 98% and from 25% to 53% respectively [7] .",
