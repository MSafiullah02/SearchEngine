            "text": "Respiratory tract infections (RTI) cause considerable morbidity and mortality among the elderly population because of the general decline in the respiratory and immune systems with age (Falsey and Walsh, 2006). There is increasing recognition that many of these RTIs are viral in origin, with viruses contributing up to 80% of acute RTI (Falsey et al., 1995, Flamaing et al., 2003). Infectious outbreaks commonly occur among older adult communities (Graat et al., 2003, Hicks et al., 2006, Loeb et al., 2000, Strausbaugh and Joseph, 2000). Clinical clues are often unreliable because indicators of infection and traditional laboratory methods are cumbersome, slow, and variably insensitive, making most diagnoses retrospective (Falsey et al., 1996, Falsey and Walsh, 2006, Walsh et al., 2007). Emerging molecular diagnostic techniques now offer the potential to test for both a greater breadth of viruses and detect them with increased sensitivity and rapidity (Kuypers et al., 2006, Oosterheert et al., 2005, Templeton et al., 2005). Previous studies were often limited by design, knowledge of etiologic agents, or available diagnostic tests (Angeles Marcos et al., 2006, Flamaing et al., 2003, Jennings et al., 2008, Templeton et al., 2005).",

For this population, there has not been a comprehensive comparison of current modalities for detection of respiratory viruses (i.e., direct fluorescent antibody testing [DFA], culture, multiplex nucleic acid amplification, and rapid antigen assays), and test performance is likely to differ because adults are known to shed fewer virus particles than children during RTI (Hall et al., 1976).",

PCR, target-specific primer extension, bead hybridization, and signal detection were performed as previously described (Mahony et al., 2007). Data were analyzed on the Luminex\u00ae xMAP\u00ae system using the Tag-It Data Analysis Software RVP-I. The mean fluorescence intensities (MFI) for positive samples were recorded. Statistical comparison between adult and pediatric patients was made using the 2-sample Wilcoxon rank-sum (Mann\u2013Whitney) test. Proportions were compared using the 2-sample test for equality of proportions with continuity correction.",

We found that approximately one-fifth of older adult patients with an acute RTI had a detectable viral etiology. This is somewhat lower than the frequency seen in other studies, which have found a viral etiology in approximately one-third of elderly patients with RTI using various combinations of culture, serology, and antigen detection (Falsey et al., 1995, Flamaing et al., 2003). This study did not have a surveillance group of asymptomatic older adults to establish a causal relationship, but respiratory viruses are found generally in a low percentage (<5%) of adult surveillance specimens when PCR is used (Jartti et al., 2008).",

The MFI data from the RVP assay suggest that older adults shed less virus than children during RTI. Virus detection in the older adult population is therefore enhanced by highly sensitive methods such as RT-PCR. An additional advantage of the RVP assay is that viruses that are not routinely cultured or stained can be detected, such as rhinovirus and coronavirus. This is especially useful in elderly patients, for whom rhinovirus and coronavirus can cause severe to fatal respiratory disease (Greenberg, 2007, Hicks et al., 2006). Although it may seem intuitive that RVP testing after 24 h of culture would be equally if not more sensitive than RVP on the direct specimen, we found the opposite to be true. This may be due to the dilution of the specimen with culture media, particularly when there were low numbers of infective virus particles in the original sample. Furthermore, R-mix cells are optimized for rapid viral antigen detection at 24 or 48 h but not for propagation of virus (Wilkey et al., 2006). Our observation that RVP from the supernatant of a 24-h R-mix culture is associated with reduced sensitivity is an important finding, especially for developing diagnostic algorithms for the detection of respiratory viruses.",

In the older adult population studied here, DFA failed to detect a viral pathogen in 8 of 12 possible cases, whereas RVP did not miss any cases that were found by DFA. Culture was even less sensitive than DFA, contributing no additional information to the patients tested. Other studies have also found viral culture to be insensitive, especially in older adults (Falsey et al., 1996). Although convenient, rapid antigen testing for RSV is not recommended for testing in older adults because of its insensitivity in this patient population. This finding is corroborated by other investigators (Casiano-Colon et al., 2003, Falsey et al., 1996). No influenza A or B cases were available for testing by rapid antigen; thus, conclusions on rapid antigen testing for influenza in older adults cannot be made.",

This finding suggests that PCR is sufficiently sensitive to detect virus even in specimens with poor cellularity.
