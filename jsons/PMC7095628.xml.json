            "text": "To understand better the mechanism of antibody neutralization of West Nile virus we generated a large panel of envelope glycoprotein-specific monoclonal antibodies8. Domain mapping by yeast surface display revealed that ten out of twelve potently neutralizing monoclonal antibodies selectively bind DIII. We also established that one of these monoclonal antibodies, E16, protects mice from lethal West Nile virus challenge even if administered therapeutically 5 days after infection. Here we have examined the structural basis for E16-mediated neutralization by determining the crystal structure of the Fab fragment in complex with West Nile virus DIII at 2.5 \u00c5 resolution (Supplementary Table S1). Our structure reveals that DIII adopts an immunoglobulin-like \u03b2-sandwich topology similar to that found in other flavivirus envelope glycoproteins, whereas the E16 Fab adopts a typical quaternary assembly (Fig. 1a). The binding interface has a high degree of shape complementarity (Sc = 0.763) (ref. 9) and occludes 1,550 \u00c52 of surface area, with VH (variable domain of heavy chain) accounting for 67% of the total antibody-combining site (Fig. 1b). E16 contacts DIII with 18 residues spread along all six of its CDR (complementarity determining region) loops in addition to three VH framework residues (Supplementary Table S2). The interaction between E16 and DIII is dominated by hydrogen bonds, with 16 direct hydrogen bonds and numerous water-mediated networks at the interface of the complex.",

E16 contacts a total of 16 DIII residues, which together form a single convex surface patch. Notably, yeast surface display epitope mapping10 of DIII identified four residues at the core of this binding site that are critical for E16 recognition (Fig. 1c). Non-conservative substitution at Ser 306, Lys 307, Thr 330 or Thr 332 disrupts E16 binding but not that of a non-neutralizing DIII-specific monoclonal antibody, E22. These four residues cluster at the centre of the E16\u2013DIII interface (Fig. 1b). The decreased binding associated with mutation of the DIII residues Ser 306, Lys 307 and Thr 332 is most likely attributable to loss of hydrogen-bonding potential with E16, whereas Thr 330 appears to stabilize the DIII N-terminal strand conformation and provides numerous van der Waals contacts with the Fab (Fig. 1d, e). Collectively, our structural studies define the E16 epitope as a large surface patch on DIII created by four distinct secondary structure elements, and yeast mapping highlights the critical contributions of four central residues.",

Not surprisingly, E16 blocks infection of ten different lineage I and II West Nile virus strains8. Notably, nine other neutralizing monoclonal antibodies from our panel also lose the ability to recognize DIII after mutation of Ser 306, Lys 307, Thr 330 or Thr 332. Importantly, this epitope is also key in the humoral immune response of humans, as E16 Fabs effectively compete with West Nile virus convalescent antibodies for DIII binding8. Sequence analysis of other flaviviruses reveals a high degree of diversity in the four segments of the E16 epitope, with notable variation even between dengue serotypes (Fig. 2). Not surprisingly, E16 does not cross-neutralize dengue, Japanese or St Louis encephalitis viruses. Other groups have also identified flavivirus-specific neutralizing antibodies that localize to an analogous DIII-binding region11,12,13. Thus, the coincident mapping of our and other neutralizing monoclonal antibodies suggests that the structural epitope has a dominant role in flavivirus neutralization.",

The E16 epitopes are unencumbered in either configuration, although intact E16 antibody is unlikely to bivalently recognize these isolated oligomers due to extensive distal splaying of the Fab tails (Fig. 3a, b). DIII undergoes an \u223c70\u00b0 rotation towards DII in the dimer to trimer transition2,3, and E16 ligation per se could serve to hinder this conformational change. Moreover, E16 binds part of the linker that connects DIII to DI, and the N terminus of our truncated West Nile virus DIII fragment adopts a unique conformation that enables Tyr 302 to make contact with the E16 VH domain (Fig. 3c). In envelope glycoprotein trimers, the flavivirus invariant Tyr 302 interacts with DI in a manner that would be disrupted if re-oriented as observed in the E16\u2013DIII complex. Thus, E16 binding could stabilize the mature state or alternatively restrict transition to the post-fusion conformation.",

With three envelope glycoproteins in the asymmetric unit, there are three potential Fab-binding environments (Fig. 3d). Two binding modes are clearly allowed: one that closely circles the three-fold axis and a second disposed symmetrically about the icosahedral dyad that is permuted as an outer five-fold ring (Fig. 3e, f). However, the DIII epitopes are too tightly clustered at the true five-fold axis to permit E16 engagement without steric overlap with adjacent DIII residues. Thus, we postulate that at saturation no more than 120 Fabs can bind the 180 envelope glycoproteins in the mature virion, with exclusion of Fab binding to DIII around the inner five-fold ring (Fig. 3g). Additional exclusions may occur for intact antibody, although we note that E16 Fab alone neutralizes West Nile virus. This incomplete saturation is analogous to that observed in the decoration of papillomavirus by a neutralizing antibody, which blocks infection through a post-attachment mechanism17.",

In contrast, E53 and E60 block virus attachment by 8\u20139-fold (P < 0.001) whereas E16 and E24, which recognize the same dominant DIII epitope, only inhibit binding by 3.5-fold (P = 0.003) (Fig. 4a). The observation that E53 and E60 block virus binding more efficiently than E16 was not expected, as E53 and E60 are tenfold less potent in plaque reduction neutralization assays8.",

Antibody-dependent enhancement of infection occurs when antibody\u2013virus complexes are preferentially internalized through Fc\u03b3 receptors on myeloid cells. Although the in vivo consequences remain uncertain, many monoclonal antibodies efficiently enhance flavivirus infection of Fc\u03b3-receptor-bearing cells even when inhibitory in fibroblast neutralization assays21. We tested whether saturating concentrations of non-neutralizing (E5) or neutralizing (E16, E24 or E60) monoclonal antibodies enhance West Nile virus infection in macrophages. We found that whereas E5 and E60 augment infection 270- and 3,000-fold, respectively, E16 potently inhibits macrophage infection at the same concentration. Notably, when E16 is combined with E5 or E60, it completely blocks enhancement as judged by reduction of virus yield (Fig. 4c) or viral RNA (data not shown). E24, which maps to the E16 dominant epitope, also blocks E5- and E60-dependent enhancement. Finally, the blockade of enhancement is not due to epitope competition as E16 and E24 do not cross-compete E5 or E60 for West Nile virus envelope glycoprotein binding (Fig. 4d and data not shown). Collectively, these virological experiments strongly suggest that E16 blocks West Nile virus infection primarily after cellular attachment.",

Modelling studies suggest that E16 is excluded from five-fold clustered DIII epitopes on mature virions, potentially leaving them free to serve in receptor binding. Consistent with this, E16 inhibits West Nile virus infection primarily at a step after virus attachment. Moreover, our data suggest a potential advantage for interfering with post-attachment events, an emerging theme in other viral inhibition studies22,23,24,25. Vaccines that selectively elicit antibodies specific to the critical DIII epitope may neutralize infection regardless of the mode of cellular entry, which may be particularly relevant given the increasing number of putative flavivirus entry receptors26,27,28,29.",
