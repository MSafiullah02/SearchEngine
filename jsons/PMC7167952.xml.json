Twenty\u2010two of these 57 patients showed wheezing, but IL\u20104 was not detected in most of these 22 patients, suggesting the lack of an association between H1N1 2009 infection and allergic response.

Twelve of our 75 patients (6 in group 1, 4 in group 2, and 2 in group 3) received corticosteroids, and all appeared to benefit and achieved a good outcome. We suggest that corticosteroid would decrease pro\u2010inflammatory cytokine levels (IFN\u2010\u03b1, IL\u20106, and IP\u201010) in H1N1 2009 infected pediatric patients, and that this would ameliorate severe disease.",

In particular, serum IP\u201010 and IL\u20106 levels were found to be negatively correlated with disease severity. Our findings suggest that IP\u201010 and IL\u20106 are important markers in pediatric H1N1 2009 infection. We believe that a more thorough understanding of cytokine response to H1N1 2009 infection is likely to be an important aid to treatment decision making.",
