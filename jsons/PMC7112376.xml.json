The expression of SARS coronavirus small envelope protein [2] and deletion of lpp encoding lipoprotein in E. coli [3] were effective for increasing the outer membrane permeability. We have constructed E. coli mutants that could synthesize different length of lipopolysaccharides (LPS), the major molecules in the outer membrane, and found that the structure of LPS is closely relevant to the outer membrane permeability [4].",

            "text": "Lycopene is a bright red carotenoid pigment with 11 conjugated double bonds, and is an efficient singlet oxygen quencher. Recent advance in metabolic engineering has provided a very promising route for the heterologous production of lycopene within various microorganisms. E. coli has been widely utilized as microbial cell factory for the synthesis of various carotenoids [5]. E. coli can naturally synthesize (2E, 6E)-farnesyl diphosphate (FPP) from 3-phospho-d-glycerate and pyruvate through a series of catalytic reactions; expressing heterologous crtE, crtB and crtI in E. coli can convert FPP into lycopene (Fig. 1\n). Different types of plasmids have been used to carry the genes crtE, crtB and crtI to synthesize lycopene in E. coli [6]. Isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP) and dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMAPP), are synthesized via MEP pathway in E. coli [7]. In the MEP pathway, isopentenyl diphosphate isomerase encoded by idi, 1-deoxyxylulose-5-phosphate synthase encoded by dxs, 4-diphosphocytidyl-2C-methyl-d-erythritol synthase encoded by ispD, and 2C-methyl-d-erythritol 2,4-cyclodiphosphate synthase encoded by ispF play important roles; therefore, over-expressing these genes has been used to elevate isoprenoid accumulation [5,8,9]. For example, overexpressing idi could significantly stimulate carotenoid synthesis [[10], [11], [12], [13]]. Enhancing the gene expression by chromosomal promoter replacement [14] or introduction of a heterologous mevalonate pathway to increase IPP and DMAPP supply [15] have also been used for carotenoid synthesis.",

In the previous publications, lpp deletion was developed as a general permeabilization method. The lpp mutant had higher permeability of outer membrane and higher ability to synthesize l-carnitine [3].

            "text": "LPS, as the major molecule in outer membrane, played important roles on membrane behavior. In E. coli, LPS typically consists of a hydrophobic domain known as lipid A, a nonrepeating core oligosaccharide, and a distal polysaccharide known as O-antigen repeats. The core oligosaccharide is assembled on lipid A via sequential glycosyl transfer from nucleotide sugar precursors. In E. coli, the chromosomal waa locus encodes enzymes required for biosynthesis of the core oligosaccharide [20]. Mutations in LPS could alter outer membrane stability, giving rise to pleiotropic phenotype [21,22]. Among 10 W3110 \u0394waa mutant strains, W3110 \u0394waaC has the simplest LPS structure. In compared to W3110, W3110 \u0394waaC had four-fold higher membrane permeability, and this likely benefited for lycopene accumulation. Comparative transcriptome showed that mRNA levels of dxr and ispA in \u0394waaC and \u0394waaF were up-regulated, compared to W3110 (data not shown). The over-expression of the dxr gene provided more IPP precursors in the MEP pathway in tobacco, which consequently stimulated synthesis efficiency of isoprenoid downstream [23]. IPP and DMAPP supply likely limited lycopene biosynthesis [9]. Besides, the accumulation of metabolites in the MEP pathway stimulated the transcription of dxs and dxr in Arabidopsis cell culture [24]. In the current study, therefore, the genes dxs, dxr and idi were overexpressed individually or in combination, to increase these precursors supply. As expected, the overexpression of genes in MEP pathway stimulated lycopene synthesis [25].",
