Curvilinear probes (3) (4) (5) provide good visualization of both superficial and deep structures but have a larger footprint and may require angulation when scanning to avoid rib shadows. Phased array probes can show all lung findings and have a smaller footprint, making the avoidance of rib shadows easier, but provide less adequate visualization of the pleural line.

The angle of insonation must be perpendicular to the pleural line. Because the contour of the chest wall may differ from the underlying pleura, techniques such as sliding and fanning are essential to ensure ultrasound beam alignment. Failing to do so may cause false positive (e.g., impression of an abnormal pleural line) or false negative (e.g., failing to see A-or B-lines) findings. LUS clips should capture an entire respiratory cycle and should be stored for documentation.",

Table 1 Lung abnormalities in COVID-19 may develop prior symptoms and nucleic acid detection. 2, 3 In one series, the sensitivity of chest computed tomography (CT) and initial real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was 98% and 71%, respectively, for detection of SARS-CoV-2. 2 In patients with a negative initial RT-PCR, the sensitivity of chest CT is 75%, leading to the suggestion by some for the use of screening chest CT in patients suspected of COVID-19. 2, 4 However, this practice has significant implications for resource utilization and infection control and is discouraged by North American radiological societies. 5, 6 Lung ultrasound (LUS) therefore emerges as an important imaging modality. LUS outperforms chest x-ray and approaches the accuracy of chest CT in the evaluation of pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). 7 LUS can identify disease, detect complications, and guide therapy. LUS offers the advantage of a point-of-care test without radiation exposure and may reduce the risk of nosocomial spread of infection.",

Examples in a hospitalized patient include to aid in the diagnosis when RT-PCR is negative or pending, to exclude alternative diagnoses, to detect progressive disease or complications (e.g. development of ARDS, pneumothorax), to guide therapy (e.g. Figure 7) . We avoid LUS when it will not impact clinical care, such as for a patient with confirmed COVID-19 who is clinically stable. We avoid LUS for training purposes in patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19.",

B-lines in a dependent, symmetrical distribution, coupled with a smooth pleural line and bilateral simple pleural effusions, suggest heart failure. B-lines in a patchy or asymmetrical distribution with an irregular pleural line (with or without subpleural consolidations) suggest an inflammatory interstitial process, such as viral or atypical pneumonia, inflammatory lung disease, or early ARDS. Coalescent B-lines correlate with ground-glass opacities on chest CT and suggest a higher burden of disease. Bilateral dependent consolidations with associated simple pleural effusions suggest atelectasis. In contrast, unilateral consolidations (particularly if associated with dynamic air bronchograms or inflammatory B-lines) are more suggestive of an infectious process. Pulmonary embolism and obstructive lung disease typically present with a normal pleural line, normal lung sliding, and an absence of B-lines.

Devices are cleaned and disinfected after every use. Health Canada provides a list of hardsurface disinfectants for use against COVID-19. 12 Ultrasound and mobile device manufacturers provide information regarding the safety of disinfectant solutions on their product. For example, Apple and Google recommend using disinfectant wipes with 70% isopropyl alcohol whereas Samsung advises against all cleaning solutions with strong chemicals. 13-15 The latter is inadequate to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection. While we describe examples of measures to prevent infection, we suggest that institutions develop and providers follow local protocols for infection prevention and control when using handheld ultrasound devices. These procedures are standardized and integrated with other safety protocols such as donning and doffing of PPE.
