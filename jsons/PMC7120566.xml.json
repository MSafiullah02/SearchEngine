            "text": "Vaccination is the most effective method to control both seasonal and newly evolved pandemic strains of the influenza virus. However, currently used parenteral influenza vaccines are only effective against strains that are closely antigenic to the vaccine strains. Thus, the yearly seasonal vaccine contains multiple influenza virus strains, including influenza virus A strains H1N1 and H3N2, and influenza virus B strain. However, there is an urgent need for improved cross-protection because antigenic mismatches between seasonal vaccines and circulating virus strains. It is also difficult to predict the newly evolved strains such as A/H5N1 and A/H7N9. Ideally, a universal influenza vaccine that induces a strong and long-lasting memory response and cross-protects against drifted variants, as well as against several subtypes of the influenza virus, which induce hetero-subtypic immunity, should be developed. While mucosal secretary IgA (S-IgA) antibodies show cross-protection against variant influenza viruses in mouse models, rational design of IgA antibody-inducing vaccines has so far been hampered by a lack of knowledge about local and tissue-specific immune responses and IgA antibody function (Matzinger and Kamala 2011). Consequently, the importance of IgA antibodies in immunity and the mechanisms by which IgA antibody responses are induced and maintained are just beginning to be established (Brandtzaeg 2007). In this review, we discuss the different mechanisms involved in the induction of S-IgA antibodies during influenza virus infection and vaccination and provide insight into how this information could be used to improve vaccine design.",

            "text": "The respiratory mucosal surface is the first line of defense against influenza virus infection. For example, pre-existing S-IgA antibodies on the surface of mucosal epithelial cells can eliminate a pathogen before it infects respiratory epithelial cells, thereby providing immediate immunity (Renegar et al. 2004) in a process defined as immune exclusion (Stokes et al. 1975). S-IgA antibodies can also disarm viruses within infected secretory epithelial cells and redirect antigens to the lumen after they have entered the lamina propria (Brandtzaeg 2007). All of these responses are non-inflammatory in nature because, unlike IgG antibodies, IgA antibodies do not fix complement and do not activate the inflammatory complement pathway (Yel 2010). Therefore, a strong S-IgA response is critical for prevention of influenza virus infection especially in case of pathogenic strains for their severe clinical outcomes. Although it is difficult to study the functions of S-IgA and serum antibodies independently, mucosal vaccination and influenza virus infection in knockout mice, which lack poly Ig receptor expression and fail to secrete IgA antibodies from the mucosal surface, show that S-IgA antibodies protect against both homologous and heterologous influenza virus strains (Asahi et al. 2002, 2004). Moreover, transfer of S-IgA antibodies from respiratory tract washings from immunized to na\u00efve mice has been shown to protect against challenge with a homologous or drifted strain (Tamura et al. 1991). Several studies in mice also have shown induction of strong homosubtypic, as well as modest heterosubtypic, cross-protective IgA antibodies.",

Therefore, intranasal immunization is the most widely explored route of mucosal vaccination against influenza.

In the human serum, IgA antibodies are present mostly as monomeric IgA1 (Yel 2010), while S-IgA antibodies are found as dimeric IgA2, although tri- and tetrameric molecules also exist. These polymeric IgA antibodies consist of monomeric IgA molecules connected by one or more J (Joining) chains. After binding to the secretory component (SC), the ectodomain of the polymeric Ig receptor (pIgR), the polymeric IgA is secreted as S-IgA antibodies. Since the cross-protective characteristics of nasal IgA antibodies depend on the polymeric nature of IgA, understanding the molecular structure, development, and function of these higher order polymeric IgA antibodies may be important for the rational design of cross-protective vaccines (Taylor and Dimmock 1985; Song et al. 1995; Renegar et al. 1998).",

The inductive site includes mucosa-associated lymphatic tissue (MALT), and local and regional draining lymph nodes. Antigens are directly taken from the mucosal surface with an important role of microfold (M) cells and antigen-presenting cells (APC). Antigen-specific antibody producing B-cells can be developed at two different inductive sites, namely extrafollicular and germinal centres (GC), and their induction involves T-cell-dependent or -independent mechanisms (Cerutti 2008). The GC is a specialized environment that supports affinity maturation, which is mediated by activation-induced deaminase (AID) induced somatic hypermutation (Honjo et al. 2004). In addition, AID participates in the production of the preferred antibody class by influencing class switch recombination (CSR) of the heavy chain (Honjo et al. 2004; Zaheen and Martin 2010). Most IgA memory B-cells (BMem) and long-lived IgA plasma cells develop in the GC of peripheral lymphoid organs and that step requires T-cell help via CD40L (CD154) and TGF\u03b21. T-cell-independent B-cell class switching in the GC might be mediated by interactions with (DC) and stromal cells, including follicular DC (Puga et al. 2010).\n",

While the respiratory tract is not populated with as many commensals as the intestinal tract, it would appear to be protected from the influenza virus by commensals in the gut because CD4 and CD8 T-cell number and the IgA antibody response were reduced in mice treated with an antibiotic. Immunity against the influenza virus was restored by nasal administration of lipopolysaccharides (LPS) but also by rectal administration of Toll-like receptor (TLR) agonists (e.g., LPS, CpG, polyI:C) (Ichinohe et al. 2011). These findings indicate that signals from distal mucosal regions can support immune priming in the mucosal effector in the respiratory tract. Additional studies are needed to determine whether distal regions contribute to immunity in the respiratory tract.",

To improve vaccine efficacy, members of the pattern recognition receptor family, which are not activated by influenza virus infection, can be employed. For example, flagellin, which activates TLR5, promotes IgA production and heterosubtypic protection when incorporated into the membrane of influenza virus-like particles (Wang et al. 2010). Similarly, PolyI: PolyC12U, activating TLR3, has been shown to induce heterosubtypic protection through IgA antibodies after administration of an intranasal vaccine (Ichinohe et al. 2007). Moreover, the TLR3 ligand acts synergistically with the TLR-2 ligand zymosan (Ainai et al. 2010).",

Early studies have shown only two signals to induce CSR in na\u00efve B-cells, namely, the presentation of antigenic peptides on MHC class II molecules after antigen binding to the B-cell receptor, and the activation of these B-cells via cytokines and the interaction of CD40-CD40L with antigen-specific T-cells. Presently, TLR signaling is thought to involve an important third signal (Bekeredjian-Ding and Jego 2009). A recent study has shown that MyD88 can induce a protective immune response during primary, but not secondary, influenza virus infection. The IgA level in MyD88-/-TRIF-/- mice is reduced in the saliva during secondary infection; however, in serum and nasal wash, the level, which was induced in a TLR-independent manner, is similar to those in wild type mice (Seo et al. 2010). Furthermore, TLRs play a role in both T-cell-dependent and -independent IgA responses in mucosal and systemic antibody levels (Bessa et al. 2009).",

The fact that IgA antibodies alone cannot induce complete protection after heterosubtypic infection may be an advantage because partial protection by IgA antibodies can reduce the viral load and provide time for immune system priming. In this way, innate, humoral, and cellular responses are activated, resulting in the strongest renewal of immunological memory. This ensures the best possible preparedness for the next influenza virus encountered.",
