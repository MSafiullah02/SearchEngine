            "text": "Rotaviruses are an important cause of severe diarrheal illness in infants and young children globally, causing 453,000 deaths per year in those <5 years of age (Estes and Greenberg, 2013, Tate et al., 2008). Rotaviruses are members of the genus Rotavirus of the family Reoviridae and possess a genome comprising 11 double-stranded RNA segments that encodes 6 structural (VP1-VP4, VP6, VP7) and 6 non-structural (NSP1-NSP6) proteins. Of the documented species (rotavirus A-H) (Matthijnssens et al., 2012) and the tentative species (rotavirus I) (Mihalov-Kov\u00e1cs et al., 2015), rotavirus A (RVA) is responsible for the majority of seasonal endemic diarrheal disease in young children. Based on sequences of the VP7 and VP4 genes RVAs have been further classified into G and P genotypes, respectively. To date, at least 31 G and 44 P genotypes have been identified worldwide (Matthijnssens et al., 2011, Trojnar et al., 2013; Rotavirus Classification Working Group (RCWG), 2015). Recently, a uniform system for rotavirus nomenclature was established for RVA based on nucleotide identities of the 11 rotavirus genome segments and phylogenetic analysis (Matthijnssens et al., 2008). Globally, the most common combinations in humans are G1, G2, G3, G4 or G9 and the P[4] or P[8] genotypes, especially G1P[8] which accounts for approximately 31% of human strains globally (B\u00e1nyai et al., 2012, D\u00f3r\u00f3 et al., 2014). Notably, genotype distributions vary among geographic regions, and several unusual strain combinations have recently been identified (D\u00f3r\u00f3 et al., 2014, Nordgren et al., 2012).",

            "text": "As well as humans, rotaviruses infect a wide range of vertebrates including domestic and wild mammals and birds (Estes and Greenberg, 2013). Rodentia (rodents) is the largest order of mammals, with approximately 2277 species distributed globally (Wilson and Reeder, 2005). It is therefore no surprise that rodents are also the largest zoonotic source of human infectious diseases (Luis et al., 2013, Meerburg et al., 2009). In addition to known pathogens, rodents are also an obvious source for the discovery of novel viruses, and new rodent arenaviruses, coronaviruses, and hantaviruses have been described recently (Gonzalez et al., 2007, Guo et al., 2013, Holmes and Zhang, 2015, Li et al., 2015, Wang et al., 2015). To date, however, relatively little attention has been directed toward the rotaviruses that might circulate in rodent populations (Everest et al., 2011, Firth et al., 2014, Greenwood and Sanchez, 2002, Linhares et al., 1986, Sachsenr\u00f6der et al., 2014). However, as rodents (especially rats) often live in close proximity to humans and domestic animals, and at high densities, they may play an important role in the cross-species transmission of rotaviruses, including to human populations.",

In the G2 genotype, the viruses identified in Wenzhou were closely related to each other and formed a single distinct lineage, most closely related to human viruses from the USA. As noted previously (Matthijnssens et al., 2009), the genotype G3 viruses did not form a monophyletic group. In the VP7 gene tree, the G3 viruses identified here and previously were classified into two groups, separated by other genotypes, including the newly identified genotype G32 and the G14. The first group included most human G3 viruses identified here. Notably, within this group, viruses could be further subdivided into two lineages. One lineage comprised the virus RVA/Human/CHN/WZ606/2013/G3P[9] that clustered with the human virus RVA/Human-tc/CHN/L621/2006/G3P[9] from China, as well as a number of animal (feline and porcine) rotaviruses, and therefore indicative of cross-species transmission. The second lineage consisted of only human viruses identified here and previously in and outside of China. The second group, which was more closely related to genotype G14, mainly comprised animal viruses from diverse species and small number of human viruses, again indicative of inter-host transmission. Of particular importance was that the virus RVA/Human-wt/CHN/WZ101/2013/G3P[3] from Wenzhou was closely related to those viruses identified in mice and rats from neighboring Longquan, compatible with the idea that the human virus originated in the local animal population.",

Within the P[8] genotype, the human rotaviruses from Wenzhou formed three lineages separated by human viruses identified from geographic regions both inside and outside of China. In the P[4] genotype the human viruses from Wenzhou were closely related to each other and formed a clade with human rotaviruses from the USA. Within the P[9] genotype the Chinese viruses identified here and previously were closely related to cat rotaviruses, indicative of their zoonotic origin. Notably, within the P[3] type, the human virus RVA/Human-wt/CHN/WZ101/2013/G3P[3] was again most closely related to those viruses sampled in mice and rats from Longquan.",

Similarly, and consistent with the pattern seen in the VP7 gene, the cluster of viruses from shrews and mice forms another novel genotype that we denote P[46]. In addition, viruses from mice and rats in Longquan still clustered together with the human virus RVA/Human-wt/CHN/WZ101/2013/G3P[3] in the P[3] genotype. Finally, the rat virus RVA/Rat-wt/CHN/RA108/2013/G3P[3] formed a distinct lineage within the P[3] genotype, and showed a close relationship with a rat virus previously sampled in Germany (Sachsenr\u00f6der et al., 2014).",

To date, only a small number of human Wa-like x DS-1-like reassortants have been described (Matthijnssens and Van Ranst, 2012).

Notably, they only clustered together in the NSP5 gene tree (Fig. 4) and were separated by viruses sampled from other locations in the remaining 8 gene trees (Fig. 2, Fig. 3). Hence, these data reveal that there have been multiple independent introductions of these viruses into Wenzhou. Both types of Wa-like x DS-1-like reassortant viruses (Table 1) clustered together in the NSP4 gene tree and with viruses with the genotype constellation (G9-P[4]-I2-R2-C2-M2-A2-N2-T2-E6-H2) in the NSP2 gene tree. However, they exhibited distinct topologies in the VP1-VP3, NSP1, and NSP3 gene trees, and showed great phylogenetic variation in the VP6 gene tree. Additionally, in the VP2 and NSP3 gene trees, the human virus RVA/Human-wt/CHN/WZ193/2013/G2P[4] was closely related to those sampled from Wenzhou and other parts of China. More importantly, in the NSP5 gene tree all Wa-like x DS-1-like viruses exhibited a close evolutionary relationship with Wa-like viruses also sampled from Wenzhou, suggesting that reassortment events may have occurred locally. Remarkably, all nine segments of the AU-like virus strain RVA/Human-wt/CHN/WZ101/2013/G3P[3] were most closely related to those identified in local rodents that showed the same reassortment pattern (Table 2). Finally, five segments of the AU-like virus RVA/Human-wt/CHN/WZ606/2013/G3P[9] were closely related to those viruses sampled from animals, while the remaining four segments were closely related to human viruses from China (Wang et al., 2013a, Wang et al., 2013b). Hence, these very close phylogenetic relationships clearly indicate the interspecies transmission of RVA from animals into humans.",

According to the criteria for genotype demarcation in the genus Rotavirus proposed by the RCWG (Matthijnssens et al., 2011), this virus is sufficiently genetically distinct that it should be recognized as a distinct genotype constellation. Furthermore, one novel G (G32) and two novel P genotypes (P[45] and P[46]) were identified in rodents captured in Wenzhou, with >20% nucleotide differences from any recognized VP7 and VP4 genes. Finally, at least two different AU-1-like viruses were circulating in rodents and insectivores in this geographic region (Table 2).",

Overall, compared with Wa-like and DS-1-like viruses, AU-1-like and AU-1-like reassortant viruses are at low prevalence in humans (Matthijnssens and Van Ranst, 2012). Recently, the genotype constellation G3-P[3]-I8-R3-C3-M3-A9-N3-T3-E3-H6 was identified in bats sampled from China (He et al., 2013). In this study, three types of AU-1-like genotype constellations were identified in rodents (Table 2), indicative of a diverse host range of AU-1-lke genotype constellations with multiple reassortment events involving bat, feline species, and rodents.",

Strikingly, our phylogenetic analyses identified one human virus (RVA/Human-wt/CHN/WZ101/2013/G3P[3]) that was very closely related to those rotaviruses sampled from rodents in the same geographic region, strongly suggestive of animal to human cross-species transmission. Despite the relatively low prevalence of RVAs in rodents and insectivores, such that the likelihood of zoonotic transmission from these animals may be small, additional work to determine whether this rodent virus has infected other humans in this part of China will be important. Because of the close relationship between RVA/Human-wt/CHN/WZ101/2013/G3P[3] and those viruses found in bats, dogs, cats and rodents, this may represent a true animal rotavirus genotype constellation. In addition, although it clustered with human AU-1-like viruses in nine of the segments (G3, P[3], I3, R3, C3, M3, N3, T3, E3) (Table 2), its NSP1 and NSP5 clearly fell into the A9 and A6 groups, respectively, suggesting that it may be a reassortant.",

Our study is of note because rat, mouse and shrew populations were found to harbor (i) known genotypes of RVAs, (ii) novel G and P genotypes, and (iii) a novel genotype constellation. In sum, these data suggest that rodents and insectivores may constitute an important reservoir for rotaviruses, including their potential cross-species transmission to humans. As rodents and shrews often live in close contact with humans, as well as with farm and companion animals, they clearly provide an important nexus between wildlife communities and human populations.",
