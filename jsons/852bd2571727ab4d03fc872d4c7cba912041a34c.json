To investigate SCoV S protein, full-length and individual domains of S protein were expressed on the surface of insect cells and were characterized for cleavability and reactivity with serum samples obtained from patients during the convalescent phase of SARS. S protein could be cleaved by exogenous trypsin but not by coexpressed furin, suggesting that the protein is not normally processed during infection. Reactivity was evident by both flow cytometry and Western blot assays, but the pattern of reactivity varied according to assay and sequence of the antigen. The antibody response to SCoV S protein involves antibodies to both linear and conformational epitopes, with linear epitopes associated with the carboxyl domain and conformational epitopes associated with the amino terminal domain. Recombinant SCoV S protein appears to be a suitable antigen for the development of an efficient and sensitive diagnostic test for SARS, but our data suggest that assay format and choice of S antigen are important considerations.",

Of interest, most of the residue changes identified within S protein lie in a region that, in other CoVs, causes significant alteration in tropism [10] , suggesting that drift toward a virus more capable of using a human cell-surface receptor could occur. The structure and function of SCoV S protein is, therefore, an integral part of studies of viral tropism and of the development of a receptor-blocking antibody response. During the convalescent phase of SARS, antibody against the whole virus can be detected at day 10 and increases to a peak titer by day 28 [11] . However, the spectrum of the antibody response, its role in viral clearance, and its use as a correlate of protection has not been described. Because SCoV S protein is such a pivotal viral protein, we have applied a high-throughput expression strategy to the production of recombinant S protein for biochemical and antigenic characterization. Here, we describe high-level expression of 6 overlapping fragments of S protein on the surface of insect cells, a context that allows high-level production and maintains sensitive conformation [12, 13] . Recombinant S protein showed strong serum reactivity in con- valescent-phase serum samples by use of both flow cytometry and Western blotting (WB), suggesting that it could be used in the development of SARS-specific diagnostic techniques. Reactivity was not equivalent between fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) and WB, however, and was not equal on all fragments, providing evidence of a variety of antibodies in the host response.",

Because glycosylation and protein folding are often linked, we focused our expression studies on the use of a highyielding but eukaryotic-based expression system: baculovirusmediated expression in insect cells. We examined a number of biochemical features, to characterize the protein expression before use for antibody binding. The S protein signal peptide and TM domain were substituted for regions known to function well in this expression system-a signal peptide from the major baculovirus glycoprotein gp64 and a TM domain from the VSV G protein already present in pAcVSV G TM [12] . This vector efficiently displays proteins on the surface of insect cells and is a method of expression that maintains the conformational integrity of even problematic proteins [13] . In addition to the full-length S protein, fragments representing the predominantly b-sheet and a-helical domains (residues 18-713 and 714-1193, respectively), a fragment from the N terminus (residues 18-410) predicted to form a distinct folded domain when analyzed by folding predication software [16] , and fragments representing residues 411-1193 and 411-713 were expressed in the same way ( figure 1A) . Abundant expression of all S protein fragments was achieved by use of this strategy, as shown by WB with a VSV G TM domain antibody that showed 2 predominant bands for each construct representing nonglycosylated and glycosylated proteins, with apparent molecular weights consistent with those predicted (figure 1B).",

Compared with expression of S protein only, coexpression of S protein with calnexin led to an increase in the ratio of glycosylated to nonglycosylated product, calculated by use of gel scan to be \u223c20% ( figure 2A) , showing that S protein interacts with calnexin during glycosylation.

The full-length S protein was not cleaved in insect cells, with the fully glycosylated form having an apparent molecular weight of \u223c180 kDa ( figure 1B) . We assessed the potential for S protein to be cleaved by 2 proteases, the subtilisin-like furin (provided by coinfection, as described elsewhere [15] ) and by trypsin (added exogenously). Furin is a classic viral glycoprotein maturation enzyme [21] . The consensus furin cleavage site does not occur in the S protein sequence, but several dibasic sites, which also can be recognized by the enzyme [15] , are present, allowing the possibility of furin cleavage. Recombinant S protein produced in the presence of coexpressed furin showed no evidence of cleavage (figure 2B), suggesting that furin is not associated with SCoV envelope maturation. S protein on the surface of infected insect cells was also treated with trypsin under conditions found to cleave murine CoV S [19] and was reanalyzed after the cleavage reaction, by WB using the VSV G TM domain and patients' antibody. Treatment with trypsin caused the loss of the \u223c180-kDa glycosylated S protein band and concomitant appearance of 2 new bands, the most intense of which was at \u223c70 kDa and whose mobility was indistin-guishable from that shown by S-F3R1 (figures 1B and 2C). The F3/R3 junction, which was chosen wholly on the basis of predicted secondary structure, is at residue 713, and a single Lys residue occurs at position 714. On the basis of these data, we suggest that trypsin can access the S protein under nondenaturing conditions, to cleave at Lys 714 and produce a b-sheetrich S1 domain and a a-helix-rich S2 domain. Interestingly, molecular modeling of the SCoV S protein has also suggested that the S1-S2 junction lies within the amino acid sequence 680-727 [22] . No S protein was found in the nonpellet fraction after the addition of trypsin, suggesting that the 2 S protein domains remain associated even after cleavage (data not shown). When probed with patients' serum samples, the presumed S2 domain at \u223c70 kDa was also highlighted, but there were also a number of smaller breakdown products. No distinct band at the predicted size of the S1 domain was visible, suggesting that it is degraded by trypsin or is not detected efficiently by the available human serum samples (see below). Whether S protein is cleaved before or during SCoV cell entry remains undetermined.",

The abundant, stable, and characterized surface expression of a suite of S protein-related fragments prompted us to use these reagents to investigate the antibody response to S protein in the serum samples from infected individuals. Serum samples used were obtained from several UK patients (for patients' details, see Materials and Methods); in addition, serum samples representing a time course from disease onset were obtained from 1 reference patient. We assessed the reactivity of each serum sample with each fragment by use of flow cytometry and WB, to represent native and denatured sources of antigen, respectively. Cytometry profiles showed the greatest reactivity of patients' serum samples with the protein S-F1R2 and S-F1R1, but all other fragments also reacted, with the exception of S-F2R3 (aa 411-713), which represents the middle section of the S coding region and failed to react significantly with most patients' serum samples, despite high levels of expression ( figure 1B) . The same general pattern of binding was apparent for all the patients' serum samples, although the exact degree of reactivity with each fragment varied somewhat (of the 2 serum samples shown in figure 3 , the data for serum sample 1 were the more typical pattern). When serum reactivity was assessed by use of WB, however, the pattern of binding was substantially different. Reactivity was seen with the full-length protein S-F1R1, but strong binding was also seen with S-F2R1 and S-F3R1 ( figure  3, bottom) . One serum sample (2908, the most broadly reactive of all the samples) showed some reactivity with S-F1R2, S-F1R3, and S-F2R3 but was very weak, compared with fragments spanning the C-terminal half of the S protein, and was wholly absent in other serum samples (typified by the WB using serum sample 1 in figure 3, bottom) . Quantitation of the serum response to S protein by densitometry (WB) and relative fluorescence (FACS) gave the reactivity orders and F3R1 1 F2R1 1 F1R1 111 others , respectively (figure 4). F1R1 p F1R2 1 F1R3 p F2R1 p F3R1 Thus, there was a clear shift in reactivity with the same serum samples, depending on the assay format.",

The possible use of insect cell-displayed S protein for diagnostic application was assessed by examining fragment reactivity with serum samples from patients infected with human CoV 229E and also with serum from a patient with suspected but clinically unconfirmed SARS (serum sample 3118). Preliminary data have indicated that serum samples from some CoV 229E-infected individuals can cross-react with purified SCoV nucleocapsid protein (P.H. and M.Z., unpublished data), so the use of a more specific test for seroconversion, based on S protein, may be valuable. Serum samples from 2 patients with confirmed CoV 229E infection did not react with S-F1R2 by use of FACS (figure 5), whereas the serum sample from a patient with suspected SARS showed a weak but clear shift in fluorescence. WB could also distinguish the serum samples, although the discrimination between the samples was not as good as that achieved by use of FACS (data not shown), suggesting that the most discriminatory test in uncertain cases should use optimized S protein fragments presented in a nondenaturing assay format.",

Serum samples were also used in WB assays to examine the changes of reactivity with each individual S protein fragment over time. The earliest WB-positive serum sample (10 days after onset) gave a pattern of binding similar to that of the other serum samples tested (figures 3 and 6). The 40-day time point provided a much stronger signal, but the pattern of binding was not altered ( figure 6 ). Blots were also probed with isotype-specific conjugates, and the results were compared with blots probed with an IgG-specific conjugate. We found evidence for the development of some IgM response late in the recovery period, but it was weak, compared with IgG (data not shown).

Efficient expression of the S protein as a specific source of antigen was achieved by use of a highly productive expression system, recombinant baculoviruses, combined with the use of signal and TM sequences proven to efficiently direct proteins to the surface of the expressing cell [12] . This format offered assays based on antibody binding to the cell surface, mimicking infected cells but with singularly high levels of expression of S protein, as well as denatured antigen prepared by cell lysis. Characterization of the expressed products provided some evidence for potential interaction with a known glycoprotein chaperone (calnexin), although the stimulation in glycan processing was marginal (20% of the total), and for cleavage of S protein by trypsin-like, but not furin, proteases. Cleavage of surface glycoproteins is a key factor in pathogenesis for some viruses [24, 25] , and it will be interesting to evaluate the role of S protein cleavage, if any, in SCoV infectivity in both animal and human hosts. In the present study, full-length S protein on the surface of insect cells did not bind a variety of species of red blood cells, suggesting that it does not hemagglutinate. S protein released by detergent lysis also failed to bind to any discrete proteins in far-western blot assay of Vero cell membranes (data not shown). Accordingly, our data do not address the nature of the receptor for SCoV, in particular the early suggestion that it may be CD13 [14] . Recent data show angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 to be at least 1 functional SCoV receptor [26] .",

Interestingly, the patterns of S reactivity with available serum samples was similar within each assay format, suggesting that the immune response to S protein varies only quantitatively between individuals. This result would be in keeping with the apparently low immunological pressure suggested from the sequence variation observed in several isolates [7] . Of the 2 assay formats we used, nondenatured S protein present on the cell surface provided the most sensitive detection of antibodies, with clear shifts in fluorescence for serum samples from patients with suspected but clinically unconfirmed SARS. No shift was apparent with human CoV 229E serum samples, suggesting that this format is highly specific. When reactivity of positive serum samples to individual S protein fragments was compared, we observed a strong differential binding, depending on the assay used. Thus, although FACS showed the highest reactivity with fragments, including the amino terminus of S protein, WB with the same serum samples showed preferential reactivity to the carboxyl terminal half of the molecule. Differential antibody binding was not influenced by the high-mannose glycans present on insect-derived glycoproteins, because S protein prepared in Mimic cells (Invitrogen), which add complex glycans to the polypeptide [27] , showed the same pattern of reactivity with the serum samples used (data not shown).",

This class of antibody includes those most useful for diagnosis (see above), suggesting that the most suitable assay format for a final diagnostic will be best configured with authentically folded protein, rather than, for example, peptides. Our preliminary work with purified soluble full-length S protein suggests that sensitivity is maintained with the soluble protein, indicating that assay formats simpler than flow cytometry will be feasible. Confirmation that the class of conformational antibody directed at the globular S1 domain includes neutralizing antibody, and whether it has any bearing on the outcome of infection, will be important if recombinant S protein is also to be considered as part of a possible vaccine for SCoV infection.",
