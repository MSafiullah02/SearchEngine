Therefore, glycyrrhizin and licorice extracts are used as food additives in a variety of foods; such as snacks, instant noodles, and sauces contain licorice extracts. Glycyrrhizin is used in sweet foods such as sweet snacks, ice creams, and sherbets to enhance their sweetness.

The potential gas production and ME have been recorded to range from 65.34 to 72.12 ml/0.200 g of DM and from 10.14 to 12.12 MJ/kg DM, respectively. The effective DM degradability (EDMD) and effective CP degradability (ECPD) have given the values ranging between 58.70 and 70.59% and from 57.32 to 73.72%. Gas production, DM and CP disappearance, and estimated parameters of G. glabra leaves harvested at prebud stage are significantly higher than those harvested at mid and late flower stages. Gas production, DM and CP disappearance, and estimated parameters are negatively correlated with NDF, ADF, and CT, but show a positive correlation with CP. G. glabra harvested at the proper stage of maturity offers considerable potential as a high-quality forage for ruminants during critical periods in the semiarid and arid regions (Kamalak 2006 open dry oak leaf, and dark dry oak leaf colors. These colors are the most used ones in hand weaved carpets and rugs. These are strongly recommended for use in environmentally friendly herbal dyeing of rugs and carpets (Arl\u0131 et al. 2002) . Arl\u0131 et al. (2002) have conducted a study on the colors obtained from G. glabra root and their fastness values. They recommend that mordants should be used singly; moreover, the colors obtained from the liquorice root in terms of lightfastness are usually medium. For this reason, it is therefore suitable to use these in the dyeing of carpets and rugs (Arl\u0131 et al. 2002) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 10, "end": 20, "text": "Gol (1975)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 438, "end": 452, "text": "(Kamalak 2006)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 455, "end": 469, "text": "Kamalak (2006)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1341, "end": 1355, "text": "(Kamalak 2006)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2187, "end": 2200, "text": "(Kamalak 2006", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2420, "end": 2438, "text": "(Arl\u0131 et al. 2002)", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 2441, "end": 2459, "text": "Arl\u0131 et al.

Almost 10,000 tones of liquorice root residues annually accumulate in some countries and must be properly treated, because the untreated residues produce unwanted environmental effects as these are phytotoxic (Medina et al. 2011) . Their direct application to the soil is not suitable. No alternative use has been proposed for this waste in recent evaluations. The burning of this waste is strictly forbidden. Landfilling is costly; currently, nearly 40 dollars per ton are required to solve this problem which includes the transportation cost as well. This type of application is regarded as ecologically unfriendly solution, due to extensive production of greenhouse gases, especially methane, under the anaerobic conditions prevailing in landfills (Lou and Nair 2009; Medina et al. 2011) . Medina et al. (2011) have tried to develop a reliable protocol for management of liquorice root wastes and their composting. They suggest that it is possible to use these wastes as a peat substitute in growing media. They have also looked on their suppressiveness against Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. melonis (FOM)-the causal agent of Fusarium wilt of melon. According to Medina et al. (2011) , these wastes can be cocomposted. For this purpose, temperature-controlled forced aeration system with the coarse fraction of separated cow manure can be used for an enrichment both its nutrient content as well as microbial population. Thermophilic conditions prevailing in the pile for approximately 3 months allow the compost to get stabilized and reach an ambient temperature 110 days from the beginning. The resulting compost shows physical characteristics which are well comparable to the peat, with a high nutrient content and relatively low salinity, and no phytotoxicity is seen in the extract from compost, according to the cress germination test. They have grown tomato plants as well in compost which have shown enhancement in development when compared to the peat. The number of surviving FOM spores incubated in the compost has declined faster than in peat. Fusarium infected melon plants have survived much better if planted in liquorice compost, as compared to peat. It can be said that liquorice compost can serve as a peat substitute with preferable qualities as proposed by Medina et al. (2011) . Latter workers have suggested that the waste can be successfully composted during a reasonable time period, provided enough inoculum and sufficient nutrients are supplied, for example, cattle manure. The composting duration of the chosen mix until full compost maturity (110 days) is reported to be much shorter than that of liquorice waste alone (Hadar and Mandelbaum 1986) and comparable to that of most types of organic matter, in spite of the recalcitrant nature of the waste from these roots (Gagnon et al. 1999; Shi et al. 1999) . Medina et al. (2011) have also proposed that resulting compost has adequate chemical and physical characteristics for its use as a component of growth media, and its performance has been clearly demonstrated. The resulted compost has a potential nutritional effect, especially in terms of N and K. The compost negatively affects the survival rate of FOM spores and shows marked suppression against Fusarium wilt of melon. It therefore has a clear potential as an ingredient of growth media (Medina et al. 2011 ).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 129, "end": 149, "text": "(Medina et al. 2011)", "ref_id": "BIBREF172"}, {"start": 361, "end": 381, "text": "(Medina et al. 2011)", "ref_id": "BIBREF172"}, {"start": 903, "end": 922, "text": "(Lou and Nair 2009;", "ref_id": "BIBREF161"}, {"start": 923, "end": 942, "text": "Medina et al. 2011)", "ref_id": "BIBREF172"}, {"start": 945, "end": 965, "text": "Medina et al.

Such an activity in plant oils and extracts has been recognized since years. It has been indicated that it can be attributed to alkaloids, saponins, flavonoides, tannin, glycosides, and phenols (Shinwari et al. 2009 ). Antimicrobial activity of ethanolic extract of G. glabra has been tested against Bacillus subtilis MTCC (121), Staphylococcus aureus MTCC (96), Pseudomonas aeruginosa MTCC (429), Escherichia coli MTCC (443), and one fungal strain Candida albicans. Candida albicans and Trichophyton rubrum growth have been reported (Patil et al. 2009 ). The inhibition by ethanolic extracts of G. glabra and their fractions has been shown by Meghashri (2009) as well. However, G. glabra methanolic extracts seem to show more fungicidal effect against Arthrinium sacchari and Chaetomium funicola (Hojo and Sato 2002) . Tharkar et al. (2010) too have recorded the antifungal activity of G. glabra extracts. Similarly, Gupta et al. (2008) have published data related to the antimicrobial activity of G. glabra against Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The liquorice extracts with ethanol, chloroform, and acetone show antibacterial activity against Bacillus subtilis, Stapphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Nitalikar et al. 2010) . A high antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, and Propionibacterium acnes has been recorded with G. glabra extracts (Nand et al. 2012) . The antibacterial effect of G. glabra extract against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Shigella flexneri, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus epidermidis, S. aureus, and Baillus subtilis has been enlightened by Varsha et al.

Licoricidin and coumarin derivatives like glycyrol, glycyrin, and glycycoumarin too exhibit high activity against all tested microorganisms. Glabridin derived from root of G. glabra has been found to be active against both yeast and filamentous fungi (Fatima et al. 2009 ). It has shown various biological activities like antimicrobial activity against Helicobacter pylori, Staphylococcus aureus, and inflammation (Hatano et al. 2000; Fukai et al. 2002; Nerya et al. 2003) .

Many reports have indicated antiviral activity of glycyrrhizin and glycyrrhizic acid with the ability to inhibit growth and cytopathology of hepatitis A and C (Crance et al. 1990; Van Rossum et al. 1999) , and immunodeficiency virus (HIV) (Hattori et al. 1989; Plyasunova et al. 1992) . The glycyrrhizin and its derivatives from G. glabra do reduce the hepatocellular damage in chronic hepatitis B and C, and show antiviral activity against HIV-1, SARS-related coronavirus, respiratory syncytial virus, arboviruses, vaccinia virus, and vesicular stomatitis virus (Fiore et al. 2008) . Glycyrrhizin also shows antiviral effect, through an inhibition of viral particle to cell membrane binding, or through cellular signal transduction mechanisms (Crance et al. 2003) . 18b-glycyrrhetinic acid is reported as the promising biological alternative for the topical treatment of persistent vulvovaginal candidiasis (Pellatti et al. 2009 ). In vitro antiviral effects for viruses causing respiratory tract infections like influenza virus and the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) too have been reported (Cinatl et al. 2003) The potential use G. uralensis for treatment of human infection by enterovirus type 71 (EV71) which can cause life-threatening meningoencephalitis has also been investigated (Kuo et al. 2009 ). The treatment of viral hepatitis since the late 1970s with liquorice preparations is a well-known fact. Recently, many papers published depict that liquorice extract has significant antiviral activity against HIV, severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus (SARS), HSV, influenza virus (H3N2), rotavirus, respiratory syncytial virus, varicella zoster virus, coxsackievirus, and enterovirus (Booth et al. 2003; Wang et al. 2013a; Kwon et al. 2010; Shebl et al. 2012) . As against this, as far as a single compound is concerned, many compounds have been isolated from liquorice but only two triterpenoids, glycyrrhizin and 18b-glycyrrhetinic acid, have been reported to possess antiviral activity, with a significant positive impact on HIV, H3N2, HSV, DHV, HCV, PrV, and IAV (Yang et al. 2015) . In addition, other virus types have been worked include the following: H5N1, herpes virus, influenza virus, and rotavirus (Wolkerstorfer et al. 2009; Matsumoto et al. 2013; Huang et al. 2012; Soufy et al. 2012; Michaelis et al. 2010; Sasaki et al. 2002; Kang and Lieberman 2011; Smirnov et al. 2012; Moisy et al. 2012; Sui et al. 2010; Hardy et al. 2012a; Baltina et al. 2012; Yang et al. 2015) . The in vitro experiments with glycyrrhizin have shown that it inhibits HCV by suppressing the release of infectious particles (Matsumoto et al. 2013) , HSV by depressing the cellular adhesion (Huang et al. 2012) , influenza virus by reducing HMGB1 binding to DNA and suppressing interactions between viral macromolecules and host proteins (Moisy et al. 2012) , HIV by preventing the virus from replication (Sasaki et al. 2002) , and H5N1 not by interfering with H5N1 replication, but by controlling H5N1-induced proinflammatory gene expression (Michaelis et al. 2010 ). However, does glycyrrhizin inhibit virus replication still needs more research work. It also interacts with the cell membrane and reduces endocytic activity (Wolkerstorfer et al. 2009 ), and causes deregulation of generating the mature forms of viral mRNA encoding, which is a process important for viral stability (Kang and Lieberman 2011). The glycyrrhetinic acid is reported to show a significant antiviral activity against rotavirus replication by reducing the amounts of viral proteins VP2, VP6, and NSP2 at a step or steps subsequent to virus entry, together with an effective inhibition of HIV-1 by reducing the accumulation of virus antigen p24 and protecting cells from the cytopathogenic action of the virus (Hardy et al. 2012a; Baltina et al. 2012) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 252, "end": 270, "text": "(Wang et al. 2000;", "ref_id": "BIBREF283"}, {"start": 271, "end": 288, "text": "Chen et al. 2004;", "ref_id": "BIBREF38"}, {"start": 289, "end": 308, "text": "Orlent et al. 2006;", "ref_id": "BIBREF197"}, {"start": 309, "end": 328, "text": "Tandon et al. 2002)", "ref_id": "BIBREF262"}, {"start": 490, "end": 510, "text": "(Crance et al. 1990;", "ref_id": "BIBREF54"}, {"start": 511, "end": 534, "text": "Van Rossum et al. 1999)", "ref_id": "BIBREF273"}, {"start": 570, "end": 591, "text": "(Hattori et al. 1989;", "ref_id": "BIBREF100"}, {"start": 592, "end": 615, "text": "Plyasunova et al. 1992)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 894, "end": 913, "text": "(Fiore et al. 2008)", "ref_id": "BIBREF70"}, {"start": 1075, "end": 1095, "text": "(Crance et al. 2003)", "ref_id": "BIBREF55"}, {"start": 1239, "end": 1260, "text": "(Pellatti et al. 2009", "ref_id": "BIBREF208"}, {"start": 1481, "end": 1501, "text": "(Cinatl et al. 2003)", "ref_id": "BIBREF51"}, {"start": 1676, "end": 1692, "text": "(Kuo et al. 2009", "ref_id": "BIBREF137"}, {"start": 2089, "end": 2108, "text": "(Booth et al. 2003;", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 2109, "end": 2127, "text": "Wang et al. 2013a;", "ref_id": "BIBREF287"}, {"start": 2128, "end": 2145, "text": "Kwon et al. 2010;", "ref_id": "BIBREF140"}, {"start": 2146, "end": 2164, "text": "Shebl et al. 2012)", "ref_id": "BIBREF233"}, {"start": 2472, "end": 2490, "text": "(Yang et al. 2015)", "ref_id": "BIBREF303"}, {"start": 2615, "end": 2642, "text": "(Wolkerstorfer et al. 2009;", "ref_id": "BIBREF293"}, {"start": 2643, "end": 2665, "text": "Matsumoto et al. 2013;", "ref_id": "BIBREF170"}, {"start": 2666, "end": 2684, "text": "Huang et al. 2012;", "ref_id": "BIBREF114"}, {"start": 2685, "end": 2703, "text": "Soufy et al. 2012;", "ref_id": "BIBREF255"}, {"start": 2704, "end": 2726, "text": "Michaelis et al. 2010;", "ref_id": "BIBREF177"}, {"start": 2727, "end": 2746, "text": "Sasaki et al. 2002;", "ref_id": "BIBREF224"}, {"start": 2747, "end": 2771, "text": "Kang and Lieberman 2011;", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2772, "end": 2792, "text": "Smirnov et al. 2012;", "ref_id": "BIBREF250"}, {"start": 2793, "end": 2811, "text": "Moisy et al. 2012;", "ref_id": "BIBREF183"}, {"start": 2812, "end": 2828, "text": "Sui et al. 2010;", "ref_id": "BIBREF259"}, {"start": 2829, "end": 2848, "text": "Hardy et al. 2012a;", "ref_id": "BIBREF95"}, {"start": 2849, "end": 2869, "text": "Baltina et al. 2012;", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 2870, "end": 2887, "text": "Yang et al. 2015)", "ref_id": "BIBREF303"}, {"start": 3016, "end": 3039, "text": "(Matsumoto et al. 2013)", "ref_id": "BIBREF170"}, {"start": 3082, "end": 3101, "text": "(Huang et al. 2012)", "ref_id": "BIBREF114"}, {"start": 3229, "end": 3248, "text": "(Moisy et al. 2012)", "ref_id": "BIBREF183"}, {"start": 3296, "end": 3316, "text": "(Sasaki et al. 2002)", "ref_id": "BIBREF224"}, {"start": 3434, "end": 3456, "text": "(Michaelis et al. 2010", "ref_id": "BIBREF177"}, {"start": 3617, "end": 3643, "text": "(Wolkerstorfer et al. 2009", "ref_id": "BIBREF293"}, {"start": 4178, "end": 4198, "text": "(Hardy et al. 2012a;", "ref_id": "BIBREF95"}, {"start": 4199, "end": 4219, "text": "Baltina et al. 2012)", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Antiviral Activity"}, {"text": "In all, 13 new oleanane-type triterpenoid saponins, uralsaponins M-Y (1-13), and 15 known analogues (14-28) have been isolated from the roots of G. uralensis .
