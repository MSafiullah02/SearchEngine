H. capsulatum occurs in soil, especially that contaminated with bird and bat droppings, and infection is usually by inhalation of infective mycelial forms. Histoplasmosis occurs in specific endemic areas, including North, Central and South America, Africa, India and Southeast Asia (Panackal and others 2002). Feline histoplasmosis is considered one of the more common deep mycotic infections in cats and several case reports/series have been published from endemic areas (Clinkenbeard and others 1987, Davis & Troy 1996, Br\u00f6mel & Sykes 2005). Although histoplasmosis has been reported sporadically in human beings and animals (dogs, badger) from several European countries, including Italy, Confalonieri and others 1994, Confalonieri and others 1995 (Antinori and others 1997, Confalonieri and others 1997, Ashbee and others 2008), this is the first case of feline histoplasmosis both in Italy and in Europe to the authors\u2019 knowledge.",

Samples of several tissues, including the abdominal mass, lymph nodes, intestine and lung, were processed for routine histology and special staining for mycotic organisms. Histology of the enlarged retrosternal node revealed only hyperplasia and no signs of fungal infection. Examination of the abdominal mass and the small lung nodule revealed vast areas of necrosis and inflammatory infiltrate. Grocott staining revealed numerous organisms (Fig 4) and immunohistochemistry (IHC) (streptavidin\u2013biotin horseradish peroxidase complex, diaminobenzidine as chromogen; DakoCytomation, Italy) with a specific polyclonal antibody (100601, goat anti\u2010Histoplasma, Meridian Bioscience Europe, Italy; dilution 1:50) was positive (Fig 5).

Interestingly, in one case series, eight cats with disseminated histoplasmosis had no obvious signs of respiratory tract disease, similar to our findings here (Wolf 1987). It has been suggested that even though the initial route of infection is via inhalation of infective particles in soil, it is possible that rapid diffusion takes place within the lymphatic system, leading to disseminated disease. In our case, lung lesions were visible only at necropsy. The most important clinical signs in the case reported here were gastrointestinal, including vomiting and anorexia. Intestinal involvement was severe in our case and subsequent necrosis and perforation of the intestine undoubtedly lead to the worsening of the cat\u2019s condition and the poor response to treatment. Indeed, itraconazole is the therapy of choice for feline histoplasmosis and several authors have reported good/very good results following long\u2010term (4 to 8 months) treatment (Br\u00f6mel & Sykes 2005).",
