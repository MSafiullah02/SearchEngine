            "text": "COVID-19 infodemic has been spreading faster than the pandemic itself. The misinformation riding upon the infodemic wave poses a major threat to people's health and governance systems. Since social Media is the largest source of information, managing the infodemic not only requires mitigating of misinformation but also an early understanding of psychological patterns resulting from it. During the COVID-19 crisis, Twitter alone has seen a sharp 45% increase in the usage of its curated events page, and a 30% increase in its Direct messaging usage, since March 6th 2020. 1 In this study, we analyze the psychometric impact and coupling of the COVID-19 infodemic with the official bulletins related to COVID-19 at the national and state level in India. We look at these two sources with a psycho-linguistic lens of emotions and quantified the extent and coupling between the two. We modified Empath, a deep skip-gram based open sourced lexicon builder for effective capture of health related emotions. We were then able to capture the time-evolution of health-related emotions in social media and official bulletins. An analysis of lead-lag relationships between the time series of extracted emotions from official bulletins and social media using Granger's causality showed that state bulletins were leading the social media for some emotions such as Medical Emergency. Further insights that are potentially relevant for the policymaker and the communicators actively engaged in mitigating misinformation are also discussed. Our paper also introduces Coro-naIndiaDataset 2 , the first social media based COVID-19 dataset at national and state levels from India with over 5.6 million national and 2.6 million state level tweets. Finally, we present our findings as * These authors contributed equally to this research. 1 https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2020/An-update-on-ourcontinuity-strategy-during-COVID-19.html 2",

These words spoken by the WHO Director-General at the Munich Security Conference on 15 February 2020 4 , sums up the challenges faced by our society due to COVID-19. Infodemic comes from the root words information and epidemic. It refers to an excessive amount of information which is made publicly available, consisting of both accurate and not so accurate information, which makes it harder to find reliable, trustworthy and accurate guidance when needed. 5 . Social media is one of the most popular media for the diffusion of information during an infodemic. Twitter, a micro-blogging site, is one of the most widely used social media platforms and it has seen a sharp 45% increase in the usage of its curated events page, and a 30% increase in its Direct messaging usage, since March 6th 2020, during the COVID-19 emergency. 6 . Social media platforms are not only easily accessible and have a global reach, they provide a virtual space to the users distant from their real world. Due to this, they provide a medium to help people discuss many taboo topics which they might not in their real social circles, like mental healthcare, domestic violence, sexual assault etc. This provides an opportunity to use data mining & natural language processing techniques to analyse the web data from the standpoint of psychology.",

Jain et al. [7] used Twitter as a surveillance system to track the spread of 2015 H1N1 pandemic in India as well as the general public awareness towards it. In this paper, we examine the use of social media during this ongoing time of n-CoV2019 pandemic. As the impact of this pandemic is growing at an exponential rate, we try to model this rapidly evolving public sentiment and dig deeper to understand how it changes daily, using time-series based analysis. To this end, we have curated dataset of more than 5.6 million tweets and retweets, specific to India. This dataset was collected using two approaches -Content-Based and Location-Based queries, as explained in Section 3. We model the public sentiment using sentiment analysis and the Empath psycho-linguistic features.",

Multiple queries were built by joining terms related to COVID-19 with the name or common aliases of the region and data was collected from 1st March to 23rd April 2020. Some of the terms used were -'corona', 'covid19', 'coronavirus', 'lockdown', etc. In addition, popular hashtags like #coronavirusin<region>, #coronain<region>, #corona<region>, #<region>fightscorona were used, where '<re-gion>' is replaced by the name or popular alias of India or various states.

Preliminary analysis using the Empath library showed that the current lexicon was inadequate to properly analyse the current situation. A case in point would be that the word 'positive' had a connotation with positive emotion in the Empath categories, however, in the COVID-19 scenario, it was often used in the context of 'tested positive', which by itself was neither a positive nor a negative emotion, and rather hinted at the activity of testing positive for COVID-19",
