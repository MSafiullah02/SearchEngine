Its clinical manifestations vary from mild disease of the upper respiratory tract to severe bronchiolitis or pneumonia. It is the most frequently isolated agent from hospitalised infants (Freymuth et al., 1987). Outbreaks of RSV infection occur in the winter, when the two major groups of RSV (A and B) are both circulating (Freymuth et al., 1991). Some authors have shown that A strains result in more severe infections than B strains (Hall et al., 1990).",

The aim of our study was to quantify RSV genomic RNA by use of real-time PCR using a LightCycler instrument (Wittwer et al., 1997). As for other Paramyxoviridae, RSV particles are mostly cell-associated in infected tissues. As nasal aspirates are non-homogeneous, a method is suggested for the standardisation of samples based on the quantitation of the mRNA of a housekeeping gene, GAPDH (which is probably expressed at a constant rate). This study describes two real-time PCR techniques designed to quantify RSV genomic RNA and GAPDH mRNA. These methods were then used to assess the RSV loads in respiratory specimens from children admitted to hospital with acute respiratory tract disease.",

The RNA concentration was estimated by spectrophotometry and the average of four measurements was used. Aliquots were stored at \u221270 \u00b0C. Once an aliquot had been thawed it was never refrozen. For each quantification, two standard aliquots were subjected to serial 10-fold dilutions in DEPC (diethylpyrocarbonate)-treated water.

Theoretically, the gold standard is the isolation in cell culture. To overcome the problem associated with the relative insensitivity of the culture method with clinical specimens (particularly due to bacterial contamination) we considered samples to be positive if they were found to be positive by at least two of the three technique. Thus 39 (52%) true-positives were obtained. A specimen that was found to be positive by only one technique was considered to be a false-positive. There were eight false positive results: two cases with IFA, three cases with the culture method and three cases with real-time RT-PCR assay for RSV. The latter three cases were probably true-positives because the real-time RT-PCR assay was the most sensitive method tested. The sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values of the three techniques were calculated (Table 4\n).

As RSV particles are cell-associated in cultures and in clinical samples and as the number of copies of the housekeeping gene (GAPDH) is proportional to the number of cells in the sample, these results can be expressed as the ratio of the number of copies of RSV RNA to the number of copies of GAPDH mRNA. This allows the results obtained from the different nasal aspirates to be compared with each other, and ensures that the number of cells in each nasal sample (and thus the quality of the sampling) is not an interfering factor.

The two samples found to be positive only by the IFA method are likely to be false-positives. Three samples were positive only in one of the two types of cell culture (MRC5 or A-549). The presence of some inhibitors of the RT or PCR steps can be ruled out as GAPDH mRNA was amplified in these samples. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that the cell cultures that were inoculated in microplates were cross contaminated. Three nasal aspirates were only found to be positive by real-time RT-PCR (even after checking on another extract). As this technique is the most sensitive of the three tested, and as these three samples had a very low viral load, it is likely that they are actually true-positives, and that conventional techniques were not sensitive enough to detect such low levels of virus in these cases.",

In this paper, we have shown that quantitative real-time RT-PCR is more sensitive than qualitative RT-PCR in infected cell cultures, and than isolation of respiratory samples in cell culture, identifying 6% more cases as being RSV-positive. However, real-time RT-PCR can also be used as a qualitative method. In this application it has many advantages over the conventional qualitative RT-PCR. Real-time RT-PCR is faster and cheaper taking just 45 min on the LightCycler apparatus, and including the detection of the amplification product. It is also a closed system, which prevents cross contamination. We attempted to estimate the detection limit of the real-time RT-PCR. The analytical sensitivity of the real-time RT-PCR was 103 RSV RNA copies/\u03bcl in vitro. However, this value is not absolute as it was obtained from a standard that was quantified by measuring absorbency at 260 nm which is not very accurate. However, as RSV RNA in respiratory samples was always quantitated using the same standard, the results are comparable and reliable.",

In a study on 24 infants with RSV infection, Buckingham et al.

Conversely, Hall et al.

The mean RSV/GAPDH ratio tended to be higher in cases of severe bronchiolitis, which makes it necessary to undertake further investigations to confirm whether there is indeed a link between the severity of RSV infection and the quantity of virus in nasal aspirates. Nevertheless, factors other than intensive viral replication are likely to play a role in the severity of the bronchiolitis. These factors can include inflammatory responses and the genetic susceptibility of the patients.
