At least one parent of each child had a medical diagnosis of eczema, hay fever or asthma; atopy was confirmed by skin prick test (SPT) in one or more parent of 96% of the children. Selection of infants for this sub\u2010study was based on availability of cryo\u2010banked CB cells; preservation and viability of cells has been high and has not been known to alter properties of progenitors (10, 11, 13). Parents were asked to keep a daily diary of their child's health and to notify the study centre within 48 h of their child developing a runny/blocked nose, cough or fever (>38\u00b0C). The presence of fever for at least 24 h was recorded but did not form part of the clinical definition of ARI. Home visits were made to take postnasal aspirate samples of mucous within 72 h. Samples were collected and frozen at \u221285\u00b0C for future polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis. Follow\u2010up telephone calls were made every 2 wk until resolution of all symptoms. Information collected included the presence, as well as duration, of symptoms of fever, runny/blocked nose, cough, and wheeze. This report utilizes data collected during the first year of life.",

Immune responses of these cells were assumed to be intact, as previously demonstrated by several other laboratories, including ours (10, 17). The cells were thawed by immersion in a warm water bath and slow drop\u2010wise application of 10% fetal calf serum (FCS), 1% penicillin/streptomycin, 2% HEPES buffer in RPMI medium 1640 was performed. Following this, they were resuspended in McCoy's 3+ medium and incubated for 2 h in plastic flasks (37\u00b0C, 5% CO2) in order to obtain the non\u2010adherent mononuclear cells (NAMNC). NAMNC were resuspended in Iscove's 2+ after a second cell count was performed. The viability counts for this cohort averaged to 98%. The recovery after incubation averaged to 67%, which is consistent with this procedure performed in other studies (10, 17). CD34+ cells are retained without loss after incubation; flasks are checked regularly under the inverted light microscope and counts performed before and after incubation to verify cell recovery (which is standardly >95%). Progenitor cells are also easily phenotypically distinguished in the hemocytometer.",

CD34+ stained cells were extracted from these CD45 events and denoted region (R2).

The net percentage of cytokine receptor expression on CD34+/CD45+ cells was determined by subtracting the staining achieved by the designated isotype control from the staining of progenitor cells with the specific receptor (10).

To further examine this possibility, ratio analyses were undertaken, re\u2010expressing cytokine\u2010stimulated CFU as GM\u2010CSF: IL\u20105 and/or IL\u20103: IL\u20105. Positive correlations were found between GM\u2010CSF:IL\u20105\u2010responsive CFU and frequency of ARI with fever in the first year of life (p = 0.012), and IL\u20103:IL\u20105 ratios and ARI frequency (p = 0.006). In agreement with the above functional (differentiation) data, phenotypic analyses of cytokine receptor expression on CB progenitors in this cohort revealed ratios of 5.0 each for IL\u20103R\u03b1: IL\u20105R\u03b1 and GM\u2010CSFR\u03b1: IL\u20105R\u03b1; thus, IL\u20105R\u03b1 expression appears to be substantially lower in high\u2010risk cohorts.",

Our laboratory has previously shown that the measurement of cytokine receptor expression on hemopoietic CD34+ progenitors in CB can be used as a marker related to risk and prediction of atopy and in this study, we attempt to demonstrate that progenitors can serve as markers of ARI and symptoms. Specifically, we have observed that there is a significant, inverse correlation between the numbers of undifferentiated progenitors (CD34+/45+ cells overall) and febrile responses to ARI (Fig. 1); this result is totally in agreement with our previous observation of \u2018restoration\u2019 of a normal, high ambient level of undifferentiated progenitors after polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) treatment of the mother, which correlates with improved first year atopic outcomes (12, 21). PUFA has been thought to play in role in the prevention/reversal of allergy. Moreover, we have recently observed that CB CD34+ progenitors of infants at high risk for atopy and asthma (as evidenced by maternal SPT) have an increased expression of IL\u20103R (p = 0.018, R = \u22120.887), and decreased IL\u20105R expression (p = 0.021, R = \u22120.879) (Cyr et al, in preparation). Similarly, in the current study, the absence of IL\u20105 responsiveness, the combined IL\u20103R and GM\u2010CSFR expression on CD34+ CB cells, as well as corresponding functional (CFU) responses to these cytokines, correlated positively and significantly with ARI frequency and accompanying symptoms from three months through the first year of life. This was also reflected as an apparent skewing towards IL\u20103 and GM\u2010CSF responsive myeloid progenitor phenotypes and functions, as shown by ratio analyses comparing CB from infants at high risk for atopy/asthma and those at low risk.",

While IL\u20103, GM\u2010CSF and IL\u20105 are each involved in eosinophil differentiation, IL\u20103\u2010 and GM\u2010CSF\u2010responsive progenitors represent earlier stages in lineage commitment than IL\u20105\u2010responsive progenitors, and thus would be expected to be more \u2018promiscuous\u2019 in the sense that they could contribute to development of multi\u2010cellular (neutrophilic and eosinophilic) inflammatory responses. Situations in which the frequency of these progenitors exceeds a critical threshold results in significant pathological consequences, contrasting with the situation involving a more \u2018mature\u2019 compartment dominated by eosinophil progenitors which have differentiated further towards exclusive IL\u20105\u2010responsiveness, in which eosinophil generation is tightly regulated by the availability of IL\u20105 (22). It is thought that high\u2010risk infants are subject to delayed immune deviation (22). Therefore, initial lack of IL\u20105 in infancy could result in compensation by an overshoot of the IL\u20105 response later in childhood, causing increased deposition of tissue eosinophilia in response to environmental stimuli, deeming the child atopic. Alternatively, decreased IL\u20105R expression may be a consequence of increased maternal T\u2010cell production of IL\u20105, causing downregulation of receptor in utero (23). We do not have CB differential counts to accompany the progenitor data, so these explanations remain speculative.",

However, as the individual progresses from infancy to childhood, viral modulation of the host response could result in modification from a multi\u2010cellular inflammatory profile to a purely eosinophilic response. It is the snapshot of the progenitor phenotype in infancy that captures host progenitor regulation processes and allows us to compare these with the picture of inflammation in childhood, thus serving as an indicator that mirrors deficiencies in all other immune compartments.",

For instance, local generation of IL\u20103 and/or GM\u2010CSF would be an integral component of host defence mechanisms, which in turn may result in fever. The immunological progenitor profiles of infants with ARI accompanied by fever differ from infants who acquired ARI without fever. An imbalance in these profiles is more evident in the symptomatic group, as demonstrated by significant correlations between febrile ARI and IL\u20103 Eo/B CFU and an inverse significant correlation between febrile ARI and CD34+ cells. This indicates that decreased numbers, but increased ratios of undifferentiated CD34+ progenitors to mature immune cells exist during ARI with fever. The profile that occurs with ARI alone may have this imbalance to a lesser degree, as evidenced by significant correlations between IL\u20103R and GM\u2010CSFR phenotypes with ARI in the first year of life. A similar imbalance can also be attributed to ARI with wheeze, as indicated by the findings that GM\u2010CSF\u2010stimulated CFU positively correlated with overall frequency of ARI accompanied by wheeze during the first year of life (p = 0.023). Therefore, imbalances in progenitor phenotypic and functional responses appear to be more evident in symptomatic ARI, as opposed to ARI alone.",

Given the central role of eosinophils and neutrophils in viral wheeze in infancy (22), this finding provides a plausible mechanism for viral induced wheeze, often termed transient, in at\u2010risk children in this age group. Martinez et al. (24) found that the wheeze present in high\u2010risk infants may be transient or remain persistent through childhood, and have suggested that 15% of infants who wheeze progress to chronic asthma, mostly those associated with familial atopic disease . These principles have been extended by other groups to incorporate the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) profile of different subtypes of wheezers, showing that the total number of lymphocytes and eosinophils in the BAL is increased in wheezing infants compared with controls; this may parallel our findings of increased numbers of \u2018immature progenitors\u2019 in CB (25, 26). RSV may also contribute directly and indirectly to the factor of wheeze, given that 80% of infants experience at least one RSV ARI in the first year of life. Whereas severe RSV ARI are thought to be accompanied by high IL\u20104/IFN\u2010\u03b3 production, both Th1 and Th2 type responses occur during this infection (27). Our results showed that RSV ARI at 1 yr of age were not significantly correlated with phenotypic or functional changes in CD34+ cells, with the exception of febrile RSV ARI, which tended towards significance with IL\u20103 Eo/B CFU (p = 0.056), consistent with our positing an earlier, perhaps more \u2018immature\u2019 progenitor in these high\u2010risk infants.",

Nonetheless, it is also likely that many of these high\u2010risk children have parallel defects in other immune and inflammatory pathways that contribute towards enhanced susceptibility to ARI. In particular, we have established that a central element of genetic risk for atopy and asthma is transient developmental deficiency in adaptive immune function, which manifests as attenuated capacity to secrete both Th1 and Th2 cytokines (9), and this at\u2010risk immunophenotype is already discernible in the fetal compartment (17). Comparable atopic risk\u2010related developmental deficiencies have also been reported in the innate compartment in monocytic/dendritic cell lineages (30), and our recent studies (31) indicate that the latter also are associated with increased susceptibility to ARI.",

We postulate that atopic high\u2010risk infants have developmental deficiencies in many compartments, perhaps in conjunction with genetic lung deficiencies and environmental triggers. This has been shown in the Childhood Origins of ASThma (COAST) study: cytokine dysregulation accompanied by environmental insult could predispose high\u2010risk infants to atopic asthma (32) and predict immune and therapeutic profiles later in childhood (33). Current concepts of the immunological basis for risk of asthma/atopy must now include altered functional status of cell populations within the bone marrow as well as the cord blood. The common factor for risk of disease development appears to be postnatal persistence of functionally immature cell phenotypes in several (myeloid and lymphoid) compartments. It is yet to be determined how discrete, or lineage\u2010specific, genetic mechanisms and/or environmental factors are involved.",
