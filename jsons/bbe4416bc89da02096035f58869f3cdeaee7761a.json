First reports in December 2019 described a cluster of patients with pneumonia, linked to a market in Wuhan, China. 1,2 Subsequent testing revealed the presence of a previously unknown coronavirus, now termed SARS-CoV-2, with the associated disease termed COVID- 19. 2 Initial laboratory responses included early characterization and release of the viral whole genome sequence (strain Wuhan-Hu-1) in early January 2020, 2 which enabled rapid development of reversetranscriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) diagnostics. 3 To date, laboratory testing has played a critical role in defining the epidemiology of the disease, informing case and contact management, and reducing viral transmission. 4 In addition to facilitating the development of diagnostic tests, whole genome sequencing (WGS) can be used to detect phylogenetic clusters of SARS-CoV-2, 5 with many laboratories now making genomic data publicly available. 6, 7 For other viral pathogens genomic surveillance has been used to detect and respond to putative transmission clusters, 8, 9 and to provide information on the possible source of individual cases. 10 To ensure maximal public health utility, genomics-informed public health responses require detailed integration of genomic and epidemiological data, which in turn requires close liaison between laboratories and public health agencies. Here, we combined extensive WGS and epidemiologic data to investigate the source of individual cases of COVID-19 in Victoria, Australia. This report describes the key findings from the first 1,333 cases of COVID-19 in our setting, and demonstrates the integration of genomics-based COVID-19 surveillance into public health responses.",

Of note, 22% of travel-associated cases were 'sporadic' (i.e. not in a genomic cluster), providing genomic evidence for the positive effects of widespread public health messaging and selfisolation requirements for returning travelers. Moreover, we identified four genomic clusters that were associated with cruise ship passengers either returning to or disembarking in Melbourne. Throughout the global COVID-19 pandemic, cruise ships have been identified as 'amplification vessels' for COVID-19, with onward seeding into ports. 19 In Victoria, returning cruise ship passengers were differences between epidemiological and genomic modelling may be due to differences in underlying models and the expected lag between demographic processes and their effect on molecular variation, even for rapidly evolving pathogens 22 .",

As reported elsewhere, we found relatively little genetic variation across the genomes, with a maximum of 15 SNPs observed relative to the Wuhan-1 reference (median 7 SNPs, IQR 6-9). Almost all second-level lineages from a recently proposed SARS-CoV-2 genomic nomenclature 15 were identified in the dataset (excluding lineage A.4), suggesting that Victorian samples were representative of the global diversity of published SARS-CoV-2 sequences, consistent with epidemiological findings (Figure 2 and",

The birth-death skyline model suggested a considerable change in Re around 27th March (CI: 23rd -31st March). Prior to 27 th March, the estimated Re was 1.63 (CI: 1.45 -1.8) with a subsequent decrease to 0.48 (CI: 0.27 -0.69) after this time (Figure 4). Our estimated Re prior to the 27th March implied an epidemic doubling time of 11 days (CI: 8.3 -14.4 days) The sampling proportion parameter (the probability of successfully sequencing an infected case) after the identification of the first case in Victoria was estimated at 0.88",

Second, consistent with the impact of COVID-19 in healthcare facilities in other settings, we identified a large genomic cluster of SARS-CoV-2 in a healthcare facility in Melbourne, with cases identified in patients and staff. Although genomics has been used extensively for infection control purposes in other our data highlight the utility of genomics for SARS-CoV-2 infection control, with potential applications in monitoring the effectiveness of local policies for identifying high-risk patients, and in assessing the effectiveness of personal protective equipment (PPE). Applying genomics in healthcare settings is particularly important in the context of high reported rates of nosocomial acquisition of COVID-19 in other settings, with associated fatalities. 20,21 Third, prior to the implementation of enhanced (stage 3) restrictions in Victoria, we identified a large genomic cluster (the largest in our dataset, comprising 75 cases) associated with several social venues in metropolitan Melbourne. This finding demonstrates the propensity for chains of SARS-CoV-2 transmission throughout urban areas associated with leisure activities and provides additional justification for the unprecedented population-level social restrictions in our setting. Further genomic support for the effectiveness of social restrictions is provided by our phylodynamic analysis, which demonstrates a decrease in Re, after the introduction of stage 3 restrictions (including mandatory quarantine in hotels for overseas returnees), from 1.63 to 0.48. The reduction in Re supports a decrease in disease incidence after the introduction of social restrictions, broadly in keeping with recent epidemiological modelling, suggesting a decrease in Re in Victoria around mid-March 17 .
