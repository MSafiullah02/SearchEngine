Therefore, taking into consideration that there are more reports in the literature associating coronavirus and ophthalmic problems, the aim of this narrative review is to summarize, from an ophthalmological perspective, the pathogeny, the portal of entry and implantation of the virus at the conjunctiva, its ophthalmic implications, ocular complications, prevention in the ophthalmology context and possible treatment of the ocular disease. The relationship between COVID-19 and the ocular surface (conjunctiva, corneal epithelium and tear film) as a potencial portal of entry and as a transmission mechanism is currently under discussion due to the high transmission rate of the disease.",

In general, hypercytokinemias consist of a group of disorders that produce an elevation of the pro-inflammatory cytokines. These cytokines are an important cause of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and multiple organ failure [38\u201340]. One analysis of the first 99 cases of SARS-CoV-2 revealed that a cytokine storm occurred in patients with severe COVID-19, of whom 17% had ARDS; among the latter patients, 11% deteriorated very rapidly and died of multiple organ failure [41]. In addition, the number of T cells (CD4 and CD8) are decreased in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, suggesting a decreased immune function that subsequently allows a secondary infection that could worsen the respiratory failure [42].",

Inflammation of the optic nerve was detected as early as 3 days after inoculation, with the peak incidence at 5 days. Axonal loss was highlighted by the significant decrease in axonal staining compared to control optic nerves 30 days after inoculation [60].",

Bleach is typically used at a dilution of 1:100 of 5% sodium hypochlorite, resulting in a final concentration of 0.05% [64]. It has also been suggested that a concentration of 0.1% is effective in 1 min. It therefore seems appropriate to recommend a dilution 1:50 of standard bleach in the coronavirus setting.
