The city has about 7.5 million people and among the highest per capita incomes in the world.1\nNotably, HK people have the highest life expectancy in the world, with male life expectancy being 81.32 years and female life expectancy being 87.34 years in 2017. Unlike other rich economies in the rest of the world, however, air quality in HK is poor and transboundary air pollution is a serious concern. For example, the annual average concentration of particulate matter (PM10) in HK was 45 \u03bcg/m3 from 2000 to 2015, which was more than twice WHO\u2019s recommended level of 20 \u03bcg/m.3 The NO2 concentration was 63 \u03bcg/m3 during this period, roughly 1.5 times higher than the WHO\u2019s corresponding threshold.",

            "text": "This study estimates the causal impact of air pollution on mortality using 16 years\u2019 of micro-level death data from HK. Our identification strategy builds on the fact that transboundary pollution (i.e., pollution transmitted from mainland China) plays an important role in determining HK\u2019s air quality. HK is located near mainland China\u2019s Pearl River Delta Economic Zone (PRDEZ), a major manufacturing center. Emissions from heavy industrial activities in the PRDEZ are brought to HK by wind, creating exogenous variations in local air quality. Using instruments based on the combinations of wind direction, air pollution in the PRDEZ, and distance between the PRDEZ and different districts of HK, we show that air pollution causes more people to die from cardio-respiratory diseases. Specifically, we estimate that a 10-unit increase in the Air Pollution Index (API) can cause a 1.77% increase in monthly cardio-respiratory mortality.2\nThe elderly are particularly vulnerable to air pollution, with a 10-unit change in the API leading to an 8.41% change in mortality. To understand how the air pollution effect changes over time, we split the sample by different sub-periods and find that the effect has been diminishing in the past two decades. Further analyses reveal that the diminishing effect is likely to be driven by medical improvement initiatives and the advancement of community-based healthcare services after the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) epidemic, not by changes in avoidance behaviors or public awareness of air pollution.",

            "text": "This study makes two primary contributions to the existing literature. First, this study is among the first efforts to estimate the causal health effects of air pollution in a high-income and high-pollution context. Existing literature mostly focuses on developed countries with a low level of pollution, such as the U.S. and the E.U., or developing countries with a high level of pollution, such as China and India. The high-income high-pollution setting is important because the air pollution effect can be non-linear and the pollution-mortality relationship may be altered by better institutional, and socio-economic background (Arceo et al., 2016; Burnett et al., 2014). Within the small set of studies that focus on HK, most of them are associational studies that may suffer from endogeneity concerns (e.g., Ko et al., 2007; Qiu et al., 2012; Wong et al., 2001; Wong et al., 2002). The only exception is Colmer et al. (2019), a concurrent study that also emphasizes the importance of investigating Hong Kong. Colmer et al. (2019) focus on how air pollution affects birth weight and infant mortality and find that while air pollution can reduce the birth weight of babies, it does not kill them. We differ from Colmer et al. (2019) in that we focus on different health outcomes (mortality for different age groups vs. infant health), adopt a different identification strategy (transboundary pollution vs. thermal inversion), and try to pin down the exact channels through which the pollution-mortality relationship can be moderated.",

Specifically, we show that the air pollution effect has significantly reduced after the SARS epidemic, during which HK government made massive investments and structural reforms in healthcare systems. We also find that the air pollution effect is larger for districts that do not have a hospital with Accident and Emergency (A&E) services, highlighting the critical role of emergency care in saving vulnerable people from dying from air pollution attacks. Several alternative explanations, including non-linear dose-response between pollution and mortality, smoking, and avoidance behavior, can be ruled out after further analyzing relevant data. Our finding suggests that a well-established medical system can help mitigate the contemporaneous health effect of air pollution, which also partly explains why HK people can have the longest life expectancy in the world despite breathing relatively dirty air.",

            "text": "However, time-series studies often suffer from omitted variable bias because not all confounders can be properly controlled for. To address this issue, researchers often include a large set of fixed effects and include flexible functions of time trends and weather conditions in the model. This introduces several potential problems. First, the estimates from time-series analyses tend to be sensitive to different controls and inclusion of trends, making it difficult to assess which estimates are the most reliable. Second, if air pollution is measured with error, overfitting the time-series model can attenuate the estimates and understate the air pollution effect. As a result, it is difficult to determine whether the poorer health outcomes were actually caused by elevated air pollution levels or by other confounding factors (Chay and Greenstone, 2003a, 2003b; Pope III and Burnett, 2007; He et al., 2016). For HK, we find that most previous studies rely on time-series models (Ko et al., 2007; Qiu et al., 2012; Wong et al., 2001; Wong et al., 2002), and similar critiques also apply to those studies.",

For HK, Qiu et al. (2017) and Qiu et al.

Yet, aside from potential omitted variable bias mentioned above, cohort-based studies are further complicated by potential sorting (Chay and Greenstone, 2003b; Evans et al., 1984). In the end, people choose where to live and these choices may depend on pollution and other factors. For example, the wealthier individuals tend to migrate to areas with lower pollution, while the poorer individuals may remain in the polluted areas. This implies that the observed association between air quality and mortality could be driven by factors related to sorting, instead of pollution itself.",

First, many epidemiological studies have investigated the dynamic impacts of air pollution on health outcomes and a general finding is that air pollution can lead to worse health outcomes at a more aggregated level (e.g., Zeger et al., 1999; Schwartz, 2000; Zanobetti et al., 2000; Zanobetti et al., 2002; Costa et al., 2017; Zanobetti and Schwartz, 2008; Deryugina et al., 2019). The reason is that people will develop more complex cardio-respiratory diseases with prolonged exposure to air pollution and the affected population will increase over time. Monthly data therefore allows us to capture the air pollution effect in the medium run. Second, our instruments are based on transboundary air pollution from one region to another and it takes time for the transmission to take place. If we use daily data, current-day pollution in PRDEZ may not be able to strongly affect current-day air quality in HK, especially when weather conditions are relatively stable. It is thus conceptually unappealing for the instrument to work with high-frequency daily data.",

We follow the literature and estimate the effect of air pollution separately for CVR (Columns 1\u20133) and non-CVR causes (Columns 4\u20136). The dependent variable is the logarithm of the monthly standardized mortality rate per 10,000; the interpretation of the estimated coefficient is therefore percentage change in monthly mortality rate. In all the regressions, district (LTPUG) fixed effects and year-month fixed effects are included. We gradually include precipitation and temperature (and the square of temperature), which are typical confounders in the regressions, to check the robustness of the estimates. We also report the standard errors clustered at different levels to examine the sensitivity of the significance: the LTPUG level, the LTPUG and year level, and the LTPUG and year-quarter level (Cameron et al., 2011).",

Existing evidence on the gender difference in air pollution epidemiology is far from conclusive and the mechanisms are not yet clear (Clougherty, 2009).

We explore the gender heterogeneity in HK and report the results separately for males and females in Table 3\n. We find that the impacts of air pollution on males are generally larger and more statistically significant than females. A 10-point change in the API increases the male mortality rate by 2.22%, which is two times larger than its impact on females. In the literature, several other studies also find stronger air pollution effects on males (e.g., Pope III et al., 1995; Galizia and Kinney, 1999; Tanaka, 2015; Ebenstein et al., 2015; Cohen et al., 2017).",

The pseudo-pollution measure\u2019 adds three components compared to the baseline model. In practice, each district\u2019s \u2018pseudo-pollution measure\u2019 is constructed from the following equation:(6)Pseudo\u2212Pollutioni,t=TruePollutioni,t+PredictedMeanErrori,t+\u03b4\u00d7PredictedErrori,t\u22121+\u03c6(0,1)\u00d7(PredictErrorVariance+\u03b3\u00d7PredictedErrori,t\u221212)where the first term True Pollutioni,t represents the baseline\u2019s matched monitor\u2019s air quality in district i at year-month t. The other items represent the predicted errors which we obtained from the above spline analysis and an additional error component that allows for autocorrelation in errors across time within the monitor. \u03c6(0,1) is a draw from the standard normal distribution. We then replace our \u201ctrue pollution\u201d by the \u201cpseudo-pollution\u201d and estimate the baseline IV regression. We repeat this process 100 times.

Our baseline estimate (without measurement error) is 0.0177. The simulation indicates the mean estimate (with measurement errors) is 0.0174 with a range from 0.0163 to 0.0187. Pollution measurement error only increases the noise of our estimates at a very small magnitude (less than 2% of the true coefficient).

We exclude LTPUGs that are far away from their nearest stations and report the findings in Appendix Table S4. We use samples within 12 km, 10 km, and 8 km radius from monitoring stations and repeat the IV estimations for each subsample. We find that all the estimates are quantitatively similar. In addition, in Appendix Table S5, we use two alternative ways to match LTPUGs with air quality monitors. In Columns 1\u20132, each LTPUG is matched with the HK\u2019s air quality monitoring station nearest to its centroid. In Columns 3\u20134, each LTPUG\u2019s air quality is calculated as a distance-based weighted average from all HK\u2019s air quality monitoring stations. Again, all the findings remain the same.",

Adding controls and fixed effects significantly change the point estimates and the significance level. These findings suggest that associational estimates can suffer from severe omitted variable bias. Second, in the most restrictive model (i.e., Column 6), a 10-unit increase in API is associated with a 0.67% change in CVR mortality rate. This estimate is substantially smaller than the IV estimate (1.77%) in Table 2, suggesting the potential attenuation bias in the fixed-effects models. These findings are consistent with several quasi-experimental studies (e.g., Schlenker and Walker, 2015; He et al., 2016; Deryugina et al., 2019), which also find that estimates of the air pollution effects obtained using a quasi-experimental design were much larger than estimates obtained from associational approaches.",

For example, after reviewing the medical practices at the time, the Hospital Authority (HA) of HK built additional isolation beds, revamped the Intensive Care Units (ICU), rationalized existing beds, adopted a series of infection control practices, and launched massive staff training programs. The HA also worked closely with the HK Government to construct longer-term isolation facilities and set over 200 improvement targets at the beginning of 2004. In addition, the Centre for Health Protection was established to deal with public health issues and to help prevent communicable and non-communicable diseases.

Air pollution also damages the immune system and increases the risk of various respiratory diseases, such as acute upper respiratory tract infections. When one\u2019s life is threatened by such acute diseases, immediate access to emergency care is critical. For example, if a patient is struck by acute ischemic stroke, the treatment modality is highly time-dependent and better outcomes can only be achieved when treatment is administered soon enough. Treatment within 60 min of symptom onset, known as the Golden Hour, can produce desirable health outcomes with significantly lower rates of morbidity and mortality (Ebinger et al., 2015).

In 2014, for example, the total number of ambulance transportations was more than 20,000, with 95% of them arriving in less than 12 min.15\nWhether a patient can receive immediate healthcare thus largely depends on the distance between the patient\u2019s address and the nearby hospital. In light of this, we explore the heterogeneity of the air pollution effect based on whether an LTPUG has immediate access to a hospital with an Accident and Emergency (A&E) service. In HK, 20 hospitals provide A&E services and the locations of these hospitals did not change during our sample period. We generate 2-km buffer zones surrounding all the hospitals with A&E services and compare the air pollution effects for LTPUGs that are located within and outside those buffer zones. We use the 2-km buffer zone because it roughly divides all the LTPUGs into two groups with equal sample sizes (Appendix Fig. S5).16\n",

The estimates are statistically insignificant for both CVR and non-CVR mortality rates in Columns 1 and 2, suggesting that air pollution is less likely to kill people in districts with A&E services. In contrast, air pollution has a statistically significant impact on CVR mortality for people living far away from hospitals with A&E services. These results suggest that easy access to emergency medical services can reduce pollution-related deaths, which are consistent with our argument that the availability of high-quality medical service is important for mitigating the air pollution effect. In addition, we check the robustness by varying the buffer zones of A&E services to 1.5 km and 3 km and report the results in Appendix Table S11. The estimates are quantitatively similar and indicate the same pattern that closer to A&E services is associated with less mortality from air pollution.",

As shown in Appendix Fig. S7, the API in HK was between 40 and 50 during most of the time and there were no dramatic improvements or deteriorations in air quality in Hong Kong during the sample period. Particularly, the API between 2000 and 2002, during which we find the largest air pollution effect, was not very different from the later periods (e.g. 2004 to 2007). This result suggests that the diminishing air pollution effect is not driven by changes in air pollution levels.",

This argument is often used to explain the finding that males are more likely to die from air pollution than females. If this argument were true and if there were fewer and fewer smokers over the years, the air pollution effect could decrease. To examine this hypothesis, we collect data from the HK Government and compare the smoking population over time. We find that, somewhat to our surprise, the percentage of smokers has remained almost unchanged during the entire period (see data in Appendix Table S13 and Appendix Fig. S8). In other words, it is also unlikely that smoking is contributing to the diminishing air pollution effect.",

We also use HK\u2019s search volume for watching films as a way to measure indoor activities and again see no correlation.

Empirically, we show people with immediate access to emergency healthcare are less susceptible to air pollution in comparison to those without, and the diminishing impacts are not driven by several alternative explanations. As pre-mature deaths are considered as the largest social cost of air pollution (other costs include morbidity, reduced productivity, etc.), our findings suggest that better socio-economic conditions and a well-functioning medical system can help reduce the damage of air pollution, at least in the short run. Governments and policymakers should thus consider the role of healthcare when formulating air pollution policies.",

The long-term effects of air pollution on mortality and morbidity remain poorly understood. Second, while the heterogeneity results between districts with and without immediate A&E services suggest quality medical service can be important, this finding does not have a causal interpretation. To what extent the A&E services causally affect the air pollution-mortality relationship requires exogenous changes in the A&E service availability, which is missing in this study. Finally, the API is a comprehensive air quality measure and is determined by the pollutant with the highest concentration level in the standard. Our analyses do not identify which between which pollutants are more health-damaging and tell little about how the interactions of different air pollutants can affect human health. Further studies are needed to investigate these issues.",
