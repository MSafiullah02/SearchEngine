            "text": "Background: The present study aimed to investigate the relationships between arterial lactate levels and outcomes in severe acute pancreatitis. Methods: The study retrospectively analyzed the medical data of 329 patients with severe acute pancreatitis from January 2014 to February 2019. We compared baseline characteristics, laboratory data, severity scores, types of persistent organ failure, and primary and secondary outcomes of patients with and without elevated arterial lactate levels at admission. A multivariate logistic regression analysis model and receiver operating characteristic curve were adopted to evaluate the value of arterial lactate \u22654 mmol/L for identifying high-risk patients. Trends in arterial lactate levels were compared between patients in the survivor and nonsurvivor groups over a period of 7 days. Results: Compared to normal arterial lactate levels, patients with elevated arterial lactate levels show significantly higher incidences of multiple persistent organ failure (3% vs 30%, P < 0.01), death (2% vs 11%, P < 0.01), septic shock (4% vs 24%, P < 0.01), pancreatic infection (12% vs 37%, P < 0.01), abdominal compartment syndrome (3% vs 20%, P < 0.01), pancreatic necrosis (41% vs 63%, P < 0.01), and a need for ventilator support (26% vs 54%, P < 0.01). For predicting mortality, arterial lactate levels \u22654 mmol/L had a high hazard ratio (10, 95% CI; 3.7-27; P < 0.01) and the highest area under the curve (0.78). Conclusions: Our results indicate that initially elevated arterial lactate is independently associated with poor outcomes and death in patients with severe acute pancreatitis and may serve as an early high-risk stratification indicator.",

Considering the morbidity and mortality associated with SAP, the ability to identify highrisk patients in the early stages of the disease is critical because it can help clinicians institute more effective management or quickly transfer the patient to specialist care to improve the clinical prognosis.",

However, as the most serious classification of AP, there are few articles concerning the poor outcomes associated with SAP.

Organ failure included the cardiovascular, and/or pulmonary, and/or renal systems, accompanied by a systolic blood pressure < 90 mmHg after continuous fluid resuscitation, PaO 2 / FiO 2 \u2264 300 or the need for mechanical ventilation, serum creatinine level > 1.9 mg/dl after rehydration or hemodialysis without preexisting renal disease [1] . The patient was classified as having a pancreatic infection based on the presence of gas collections in the pancreatic and/or peripancreatic tissues on contrastenhanced computed tomography or based on a positive Gram stain and culture for bacteria and/or fungi from a fine-needle aspiration biopsy, percutaneous catheter drainage, and endoscopic transluminal drainage [1] . The diagnosis of septic shock was based on Chinese guidelines for management of severe sepsis and septic shock in 2014, meeting the following criteria: hypotension caused by sepsis (systolic blood pressure < 90 mmHg or drops more than 40 mmHg) after fluid therapy [23] . The definition abdominal compartment syndrome (ACS) base on the World Society of the Abdominal Compartment Syndrome. Intra-abdominal pressure. IAP measured by Indirect monitoring urinary bladder pressure via Foley bladder catheter. ACS is defined as a sustained IAP > 20 mmHg that is associated with new organ dysfunction [24] .",

There were 112 SAP patients with normal arterial lactate levels and 217 SAP cases with elevated levels. The average age of the normal group was 51.8 years, and 59% of the patients were male. The mean age of the elevated group was 51.2 years, and 59% of the patients were male. There was not statistically significant difference between the normal and elevated groups in demographics (consisting of age, sex, etiology, body-mass index), partial laboratory data (such as white blood count, serum calcium, serum albumin C-reactive protein), the SIRS scores and the Balthazar grading standard.

            "text": "The present study uses a medical database to investigate the association between arterial lactate levels and clinical outcomes in SAP. In this retrospective cohort study, we demonstrated that an initially elevated arterial lactate level was associated with poor outcomes and may be an effective risk-stratification biomarker in patients with SAP. Second, we found that a high arterial lactate level (\u22654 mmol// L) at admission was independently associated with a risk factor for mortality after controlling for the effect of serum urea, procalcitonin, hematocrit, SIRS and APACHE II. Our study showed that an arterial lactate level \u2265 4 mmol/L on admission for the prediction of mortality in SAP had an AUC of 0.78 (95% CI: 0.68-0.88), a sensitivity of 71% and a specificity of 88% (Table 5) . Furthermore, we revealed that arterial lactate levels increased again 7 days after admission after continuous fluid resuscitation in patients in the nonsurvivor group. By contrast, patients in the survivor group had normal arterial lactate levels. Peery AE et al. reported that AP is an important cause of death and a medical burden in gastrointestinal diseases, and the overall population mortality has been unchanged in the United States [26] . Thus, AP remains a large challenge for clinicians. In 2010, a systematic review involving fourteen studies proved that organ failure and infected pancreatic necrosis were determinants of mortality in patients with AP, especially in cases of critical acute pancreatitis [25] . This implies that the ability to risk-stratify patients during the most proximal phase of SAP is of great importance for determining the need for initial intensive care and other therapeutic strategies. However, current prognostic markers in SAP have some limitations. First, the primary outcomes for most of the previously studied markers and system scores were necrosis or organ failure, rather than mortality, septic shock and pancreatic infection, which are too inconvenient to use in clinical practice to determine system scores [10, 11, 13, 15] . Inflammatory markers such as Creactive protein and procalcitonin may be useful in predicting severity. However, it takes a great deal of time to receive the results [12] . Therefore, it is necessary to further explore new markers. We chose the arterial lactate level as a potential marker of poor prognosis in SAP for several reasons. First, lactate is a routine laboratory marker that can both reflect the degree of tissue hypoxia and the changes in intravascular volume status. Second, as a laboratory test, a lactate measurement can be accomplished quickly with the advantages of low cost and high reproducibility. Third, as we mentioned above, in many studies, high lactate concentration portended a bad outcome in cases of critical illness, including septic shock, severe sepsis, organ failure, trauma, AP and other disease [17, 18, 22, 27] . All of those observations suggest that initially elevated arterial lactate levels may be a simple marker to risk-stratify patients with SAP in the early stages of the disease. An important finding in our study supports the conjecture that an initially elevated arterial lactate level portends a bad outcome in SAP (Tables 2, 3) . There are several possible explanations for this outcome. First, it is well known that an important reason for the worsening of AP is that insufficient blood volume, due to various causes, increases hypoperfusion of the pancreas and other vital organs, leading to pancreatic necrosis and organ dysfunction [28] . We believe that the admission arterial lactate level may reflect the underlying state of intravascular volume scarcity and vital organ perfusion (including kidney, gut, liver and even heart). Conversely, the damage to major organ functions further increases the level of arterial lactate through impaired lactate clearance and excessive production [27, 29] . Second, lactate has been regarded as a marker of tissue hypoxia in critically ill patients [21, 30] . The main function of the lung is to supply oxygen to tissues. Thus, lactate is likely to represent the degree of pulmonary failure. Persistent pulmonary failure is usually the direct cause of death in SAP. Third, lactate is also considered an early biomarker of the response to inflammatory mediators [31] [32] [33] . Lactic acid may indicate the extent of the inflammatory response in SAP. Mofidi R et al. found that persistent SIRS is associated with multiple organ dysfunction syndrome and death in patients with acute pancreatitis and is an early indicator of the likely severity of acute pancreatitis [6] . Fourth, patients with SAP have high energy metabolism [19, 34] , which may be achieved by increasing aerobic glycolysis. If the amount of pyruvic acid produced by aerobic glycolysis exceeds the metabolic capacity of pyruvate dehydrogenase, it will lead to the accumulation of lactate. Levy et al. revealed that elevated lactate may be associated with increasing Na + K + ATPase activity in septic shock patients [21] . Therefore, lactate may also reflect the state of energy metabolism in SAP. Regardless of the specific mechanism involved, our research clearly showed that patients with elevated arterial lactate levels with early-stage SAP have an increased risk of mortality and of both mild and serious complications.",

Second, some patients received repeated measurements of lactate in 24 h based on the condition of the disease, and we took the initial value on the first day and the highest value during the following 6 days. We adopted the approach that the mean value and the lactate value on the next day must be separated by 6 h to reduce this impact. Third, some patients received rehydration therapy before admission. Finally, we followed up 1 month after the patient was discharged from the hospital, which may be too short a timeframe to adequately assess primary and secondary outcomes.",
