The roles of these viral channel forming proteins are in some cases essential for the virus (e.g., p7 from Hepatitis C Virus (HCV)4, M2 from Influenza A) in other cases rather supportive for the viral life cycle as in the case of Vpu from Human Immunodeficiency virus type\u20101 (HIV\u20101) and therefore being classified as accessory protein.5 These proteins are involved in the entry/exit pathway (e.g., M2 from influenza A6, 7), in the formation of vesicles (e.g., 2B from polio virus8) or the amplification of viral release (Vpu from HIV\u201019) to mention just a few of the known roles. Their topologies range from a single transmembrane (TM) domain (e.g., M2 from influenza A,6 Vpu from HIV\u2010110) to two (p7 from HCV,11, 12 2B from Picornavirus13, 14) and even three domains (3a from severe acute respiratory syndrome\u2010associated coronavirus (SARS\u2010CoV)15). The size of most of the proteins is around 100 amino acids, except for 3a with a length of 274 amino acids.15\n",

It has a hydrophobic N\u2010terminus which contains the TM domain and a larger cytoplasmic domain of \u223c54 amino acids. Structural information is available for Vpu measured in parts (reviewed in Ref.18): the spectroscopic methods used reveal a helical motif for the TM domain and 2\u20133 helices in the cytoplasmic domain. Vpu is multi\u2010functional as it induces the degradation of CD419 and enhances particle release at the site of the plasma membrane by forming ion channels.20 Ion channel function has so far only been tested in vitro\n20, 21, 22 and in expression studies with Xenopus oocytes.23 From reconstitution experiments where either peptides representing the TM part of Vpu or full length Vpu are placed into black lipid bilayers it is shown that the peptide behaves almost like the full length protein with respect to Vpu's conductance levels.24, 25 In terms of the duration of the open state, the full Vpu stays longer in the open state than the Vpu peptide.24 These studies indicate that studies on peptides will deliver results attributable to the full length protein. In contrast to M2 for which the mechanism of function is relatively straight forward no studies have yet been done for Vpu in this respect.",

For this reason short peptides corresponding to the TM domain of Vpu and three of its mutants have been synthesized and reconstituted into lipid bilayers. On the basis of the current structural \u2018working\u2019 model of an ion conducting bundle of Vpu18 the following mutations have been investigated (i) a tryptophan at the outside of the bundle has been replaced by leucine, (ii) an arginine by a valine, and (iii) a serine at the C\u2010terminus of the peptide has been replaced by an alanine. Both the arginine and the serine are supposed to point into the lumen of the pore. The mutations have been chosen so that the characteristics of the side chain, for example aromaticity and polarity, are removed but the bulkiness of the side chains is remained.",

The simultaneous occurrence both of the intensification of the flickering and of an increase in \u03c4O with increasing salt concentration leads to the conclusion that the ion pressure of the water phase exerts a non\u2010negligible force on a Vpu channel which tries to keep the channel open.

In the case of Vpu the finding (Table I) that a shift in conductance occurs when changing the anions proves that anions contribute to the overall conductance of the channel. This rejects possibility (i). Equally changing the cations does also lead to a change in conductance, which indicates that cations contribute to the ion conductance as well, which excludes option (ii). Changing the cation (from Na to K) leads to a stretch and shift of the overall conductance pattern rather than generating a splitting of the conductance states. This proves possibility (iii) wrong, since conductance states which can be assigned to an anion flow should remain at their original conductivity. Thus, being left with option (iv), the conclusion can be drawn that the channel conducts cations and anions during the same opening event and the conductance is in advantage of cations (one anion for 20\u201330 cations). In addition, it can also be concluded that the different conductance states originate from different conformational states rather than from conducting different types of ions. Since the shift is larger for changing the cations than for changing the anions the conclusion can be drawn that anions and cations contribute with different conductivities to the overall channel conductance.",
