These viruses caused no detectable cytopathic effect in the duck cells. However, serum from a PDD-affected green-winged macaw (Ara chloroptera) that had been shown to recognize ABV N-protein was available. By performing a Western blot on infected duck cell lysates, these investigators demonstrated a progressive increase in the quantity of this viral antigen when cultured over 5 days. Indirect immunofluorescence assays on these infected cells using this same antiserum showed foci of antigen-positive cells demonstrating characteristic speckled intranuclear fluorescence (see Fig. 1). This speckled pattern is similar to that considered diagnostic of mammalian bornavirus infection: the stained particles are called Joest-Degen bodies and are believed to be complexes of the viral N and P proteins.26, 27 PCR assays conducted on this and other infected tissue cultures confirmed the presence of ABV. Subsequently the authors have isolated ABV by culture in duck embryo fibroblasts using material from the brains of 5 additional birds with necropsy-confirmed PDD (Fig. 2\n).",

These genotypes differed by about 5% to 15% in their gene sequences. Given the huge diversity of species affected by PDD, the presence of diverse genotypes was unsurprising. However, Kistler's data show that specific genotypes do not favor certain avian species and appear to be of roughly equivalent pathogenicity. To date 7 different genotypes have been identified.28, 29 There is also significant genetic variation within these genotypes. Of the authors' 7 isolates, one is genotype 1 (ABV1) while the remainder belong to genotype 4 (ABV4). This predominance of genotype 4 has been observed by other groups.28, 29 This genotype could be an artifact resulting from increased pathogenicity of ABV4 and the fact that tissue from lethal PDD cases is being selectively cultured. It is more likely, however, that it is indeed the predominant circulating genotype. The authors have also found that ABV4 is the predominant genotype in isolates from subclinical carriers of ABV (see later discussion). It is noteworthy that BDV, in contrast to ABV, shows a remarkable lack of genotypic variation. Only 2 genotypes of this virus have been identified. The reasons for this major difference between the 2 bornaviruses are unknown.",

Ouyang and colleagues31 subsequently examined 24 stored avian brain samples, processed for histopathology and retained following their submission for necropsy or histopathology to the Schubot Exotic Bird Center diagnostic laboratory in 1992\u2014a year selected at random. Thirteen of these samples were from PDD-infected birds. The remaining 11 were diagnosed with diseases other than PDD. Immunohistochemistry was performed using the macaw anti\u2013N-protein serum and developed with a peroxidase-labeled anti-macaw serum. Cells containing ABV N-protein were found in the brain and spinal cord of all 13 PDD cases.31 One bird not previously diagnosed with PDD also had ABV N-protein\u2013positive cells in its cerebrum. A review of this bird's necropsy report indicated that it was most probably also suffering from PDD. ABV antigen was located in the cerebrum, cerebellum, and spinal cord. In the cerebrum it was usually found in scattered neurons and glial cells. In the cerebellum viral antigen was expressed in the Purkinje layer of the cerebellum, although Purkinje cells were never observed to contain the antigen. The cells containing the viral antigen were located adjacent to the Purkinje cells. Similar lesions have been observed in mammalian bornavirus infections.32 All levels of affected spinal cord contained the ABV antigen in neurons and glia. Kr\u00e4henb\u00fchl and colleagues33 have also detected ABV in tissues of birds with PDD using in situ hybridization. Ten birds submitted for necropsy after dying for reasons other than PDD had no detectable N-protein in their brains.",

            "text": "Ouyang and colleagues31 noted that ABV was detectable in the optic lobe of many PDD cases. In a single separate case of PDD in an Eclectus parrot (Eclectus roratus), eye fluid (vitreous and aqueous fluid) was collected on necropsy. This fluid contained so much virus that the ABV N-protein band was visible on stained electrophoresis gels. This protein band was excised and sequenced by mass spectroscopy and was confirmed to be the ABV N-protein (see Fig. 2). In addition, particles with a morphology consistent with that of a bornavirus were observed by immunotransmission electron microscopy (Fig. 3\n). Subsequent analysis of multiple additional eye fluid samples from PDD cases, while demonstrating the presence of occasional virus-like particles on electron microscopy, did not show the numbers of particles observed in the first bird and some contained no detectable virus-like particles, so the phenomenon is inconsistent. It is pertinent that eye lesions are a feature of some cases of PDD; choroiditis and optic neuritis predominate. The single article describing blindness in a psittacine as a result of bilateral retinal degeneration suggests that the lesions in the optic lobe may well lead to local retinal destruction or degeneration (see Fig. 3, Fig. 4\n).13\n",

For control purposes they used an extract of brain tissue from a bird that had died of causes other than PDD and which was both seronegative and PCR-negative for ABV. During these studies, occasionally the serum of a seropositive bird would also react with antigens present in the normal bird brain. In one such case, serum from a \u201chealthy\u201d golden conure (Guarouba guarouba) was shown to react very strongly with a brain protein migrating in the 18- to 20-kDa region. Because this is the approximate molecular weight of myelin, this was investigated. This serum was also found to react with a similar-sized protein in normal chicken brain and with purified myelin basic protein (MBP) derived from that chicken brain. This ABV seropositive bird remains clinically healthy after 1 year. Serum evaluated 7 months later reacted weakly with MBP. It is proposed that the bird mounted a transient autoimmune response to myelin. Villanueva and colleagues30 also surveyed 12 ABV-positive parrot sera for reactions with normal macaw brain and found that 3 reacted with an uncharacterized 40-kDa protein. These findings are of significance because it has been suggested that PDD results from an autoimmune response to brain gangliosides following viral infection in a manner similar to the induction of Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome.37 The authors do not believe that PDD is an autoimmune disease per se. However, the results described indicate that transient autoimmune responses do indeed occur in some PDD cases. The results are probably not clinically significant but may contribute to the complex pathogenesis of this disease.",

Four cockatiels were inoculated with ABV-M24 using the same routes and doses as the Patagonian conures described above. Two additional birds were inoculated with uninfected tissue culture and retained as negative controls. The inoculated birds remained in apparent good health until day 92 post infection. On that day, one bird was found dead in its cage. Necropsy revealed gross lesions typical of PDD. The remaining 3 infected birds were apparently healthy but their daily feed intake and activity levels declined. On day 110, 2 birds began showing neurologic signs, ataxia, and inability to walk. All 3 infected birds were euthanized humanely. Histopathology showed that 2 of these birds were suffering from PDD with lesions of unusual severity. The lesions were especially severe in the gastrointestinal tract and adrenal gland. The brain and spinal cord had mild to severe multifocal perivascular cuffing and gliosis randomly scattered throughout. The nerves had mild to moderate multifocal perivascular cuffing. The adrenal gland had a severe infiltration of lymphocytes and plasma cells in the medullary regions. The crop, proventriculus, ventriculus, and intestine had a severe infiltration of lymphocytes and a few plasma cells in the serosal and subserosal nerves and ganglia that also extended between muscle fibers. The bird with mild neurologic signs, but no gastrointestinal signs, had mild lesions compatible with PDD. The control, sham-infected birds remained healthy until euthanized on day 120. Their gross necropsy was unremarkable but on histopathology, they showed the presence of scattered lymphoid nodules throughout the spleen, kidney, and liver. It is important that in this study, the cockatiels were shown to be subclinical carriers of ABV4 prior to challenge. Their susceptibility indicates that they were not immune to the challenge virus despite prior exposure. This finding will be of significance in seeking to vaccinate against this virus and is discussed further below (Fig. 5\n).",

The predominant antigen recognized by these birds was the 38-kDa N-protein. Thirty of these birds were confirmed positive for PDD by biopsy or necropsy, whereas the remaining 87 birds were apparently healthy or were suffering from non-PDD related disease. Sera from 27 of the 30 PDD cases (90%) contained antibodies to ABV N-protein. Seventy-three (84%) of the 87 apparently \u201chealthy\u201d birds were seronegative. In addition, sera from 7 wild macaws and one mealy Amazon parrot trapped in the Peruvian Amazon rainforest were negative. Most of the positive sera recognized only the N-protein in infected DEF cells. These positive sera also reacted strongly with 2 different preparations of recombinant N-protein. One clone was generated in an Escherichia coli vector, the other was generated in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO-K1) cells. A small proportion of the positive sera could also recognize cloned bornaviral P-protein generated in an E coli vector, a finding also reported by Lierz and colleagues.34\n",

It is believed that these birds are infected by ABV but have yet to develop clinical disease. As discussed later in this article, \u201chealthy\u201d or subclinical carriers of ABV are apparently common so the presence of seropositive healthy birds is not unexpected. It is unclear at this time whether these seropositive birds will eventually, inevitably, develop clinical PDD. Villanueva and colleagues35 also demonstrated that many seronegative birds were infected with ABV as detected by fecal PCR. Thus positive serology will be of limited usefulness in any disease eradication programs. The Western blot assay is also a slow and expensive test. A more practical and economic test would be an ELISA that employs purified, cloned ABV N-protein as the test antigen. Such a test is under development.",

As described earlier, the authors succeeded in infecting mallards with ABV4 but no disease resulted within 8 months. The authors have tested serum from a domestic Muscovy duck (Cairina moschata) submitted to a veterinary clinic because of a tumor, whose serum was positive for antibodies to ABV N-protein by Western blotting.

ABV would be expected therefore to show a sensitivity profile similar to that observed in NDV. The authors therefore suggest that NDV can be used as a surrogate and that disinfectants and cleansing agents that are effective for NDV will likely be effective for ABV. Control would include isolation, traffic control, sanitation and thorough cleaning, and the use of disinfectants such as phenols, formaldehyde, or hypochlorites such as bleach. With the availability of a fecal PCR, it should also be possible to control the admittance of ABV-infected birds to aviaries.

Diagnostic tests such as Western blots or fecal PCR can identify many, but not all ABV-infected birds, and should be employed to control the spread of this disease. Such tests may be very useful for diagnosis and in epidemiologic studies.",
