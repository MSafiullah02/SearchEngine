Unlike conventional weapons that confine themselves to a defined and targeted area, WMD\u2019s cross international boundaries and borders and thus threaten global health security. This chapter will focus on the ease of access to WMDs, the impact biological weapons and bioterrorism plays on global health security, United States global policies on public health, and the role actors and non-state actors play in the global health landscape. Chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear, and explosive weapons, also known as weapons of mass destruction (WMD), have the potential to kill thousands of people in a single incident [1]. This fact, in and of itself, is why a thorough understanding of the threat is necessary. In addition, this chapter will focus on global WMD proliferation prevention to include international efforts, treaties, and conventions. The chapter will conclude with a discussion of ongoing research initiatives, identification of emerging threats, and additional recommended readings.",

This added dimension to proliferation makes it even more difficult to mitigate. The potential for non-state actors , which includes both domestic and international terrorists, successfully obtaining access to WMD\u2019s is a very real threat to the safety and security of all people [4]. One should realize that a nexus exists between WMD and terrorism. The driving motivation for terrorism is to inflict fear and create destruction to achieve their goals. The prospect of a terrorist faction successfully obtaining WMD poses one of the gravest risks to civilization. A successful WMD terror attack could potentially kill thousands and result in many more thousand casualties. Likewise, the social, political, and economical impacts of such an attack would threaten the civilized world. The interconnected nature of people, economies, and international infrastructure around the world can infuse seemingly isolated or remote events with global consequences [5].",

In 2003, President George Bush signed the Proliferation Security Initiative (PSI), which was designed to stop the global trafficking of WMD. On 31 May 2003, President Bush unveiled the Proliferation Security Initiative (PSI) in Krakow, Poland, which outlined a new interdiction cooperative agreement outside of treaties and multilateral export control regimes [6]. PSI is not a program housed in only one agency, but instead is a set of activities with participation by multiple U.S. agencies and other countries [7]. In its December 2002 National Strategy to Combat Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) Proliferation, the Bush Administration articulated the importance of countering proliferation once it has occurred and managing the consequences of WMD use. In particular, interdiction of WMD-related goods gained more prominence. U.S. policy sought to \u201cenhance the capabilities of our military, intelligence, technical, and law enforcement communities to prevent the movement of WMD materials, technology, and expertise to hostile states and terrorist organizations [8]. President Bush\u2019s efforts follow a long line of previous efforts to curb the proliferation of WMD (Illustration 1).",

While this was a valiant attempt, the agreement fell short as there was no built-in verification mechanism [10]. In 1993, the landmark Chemical Weapons Convention was held in Paris that resulted in 130 countries agreeing on the elimination of chemical weapons [9]. It also established the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), whose mission is to assure the objectives outlined in the CWC are carried out and for ensuring the implementation the CWC provisions. This includes the verification of compliance of CWC directives (43, 44). The year 2007 marked the tenth anniversary of the CWC, which boasted 182-member states. In the preceding years between 1993 and 2007, approximately 25,000 metric tons of chemical weapons were destroyed, with over 3000 international inspections conducted. Even with the successes of the OPCW, the world witnessed Syria launch a chemical WMD attack on civilians, which we will discuss later in the chapter. According to the Worldwide Threat Assessment of the US Intelligence Community, the Mideast nations of Iraq and Syria have already demonstrated their use of WMD on civilians. In his statement for the record, United States Director of National Intelligence, Daniel R. Coats [11] outlined the following situation status:",

Iran\u2019s implementation of the JCPOA has extended the amount of time Iran would need to produce enough fissile material for a nuclear weapon from a few months to about 1 year, provided Iran continues to adhere to the deal\u2019s major provisions. The JCPOA has also enhanced the transparency of Iran\u2019s nuclear activities, mainly by fostering improved access to Iranian nuclear facilities for the IAEA and its investigative authorities under the Additional Protocol to its Comprehensive Safeguards Agreement. Iran\u2019s ballistic missile programs give it the potential to hold targets at risk across the region, and Tehran already has the largest inventory of ballistic missiles in the Middle East. Tehran\u2019s desire to deter the United States might drive it to field an ICBM. Progress on Iran\u2019s space program, such as the launch of the Simorgh SLV in July 2017, could shorten a pathway to an ICBM because space launch vehicles use similar technologies.",

Category A contains the most lethal agents that pose the greatest threat, as they are easily disseminated and have the highest mortality rates [14].

At a peace conference, the blankets were presented as gifts to the unsuspecting Indians. What the tribes did not realize, was that the blankets came from a smallpox-infected soldiers that were located in the area. The resulting impact was an outbreak of smallpox in the Indian tribes of the area which was estimated to have a case fatality rate of almost 90% [16].",

Readers learned just how dangerous this pathogen was. Although this was a fictional account, an actual Ebola outbreak nearly occurred in Ranson, Virginia in 1989 at a CDC Primate Lab when monkeys became infected with a hemorrhagic fever outbreak. Although the incident was contained, it required the ethnicization of 450 primates by the United States Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID). Fortunately for the primate lab scientists, their strain of Ebola was not harmful to humans. This outbreak gave birth to the new Ebola-Reston strain, which is only one of five Ebola strains not harmful to humans [21]. The world\u2019s attention was again focused on the Ebola virus when in 2014, a Dallas hospital nurse became infected with Ebola after treating an Ebola patient. As the world learned of the Ebola incident, citizens and concerned scientists concerns over laboratory safety began to be heard. The pandemic potential of accidental release of insufficient biosafety presents a danger [22].",

In 1889, an agreement was signed that was a part of The Hague Peace Conference in which countries agreed to abstain from the use of projectiles, the sole object of which is the diffusion of asphyxiating or deleterious gases [9]. As we have read, the first half of the twentieth century witnessed nations putting great resources into the development of chemical weapons. From the Cold War years (1947\u20131991), the United States and the Soviet Union were the two major superpowers still producing and maintaining chemical weapons stockpiles. In 1997, the world\u2019s first multilateral disarmament agreement witnessed 130 signatory nations agree to specifically at eliminating chemical weapons stockpiles, which was known as the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) [9].

Numerous legislative efforts have attempted to halt the proliferation of WMD which works for nations who intend on following the law. The danger exists with non-state actors, rogue nations and terrorists, anyone of whom wouldn\u2019t think twice on using them. It is important for nations and international law enforcement agencies to keep tabs on these rogue nations and terrorists. The threat is too great and the cost is just too high if these weapons fall into the wrong hands. Global proliferation of weapons of mass destruction (WMD) presents a clear and present danger to global health security and unlike conventional weapons that confine themselves to a defined and targeted area, WMD\u2019s cross international boundaries and borders. From the sarin attacks in 1994 and 1995 in Japan and 2001 anthrax attacks to the Syrian chemical attack on innocent civilians and VX nerve agent assignation in Malaysia, weapons of mass destruction are a sad reality in today\u2019s society. As we have learned in this chapter, the driving motivation of terrorism is to strike fear and kill or injure innocent civilians to achieve their twisted goals. WMD\u2019s pose a much larger threat than conventional weapons and could potentially kill thousands and result in many more thousand casualties.",

            "text": "WMD\u2019s include chemical agents, biological pathogens, radiological agents, and nuclear weapons, each of which require special protective measures for responders and decontamination for victims. Chemical agents include Lung Damaging Agents (Chlorine (CL) and Phosgene (CG)), Blood Agents (Cyanogens), Blister Agents (Mustard (H), Lewisite (L), and Phosgene Oxime (CX)), and Nerve Agents (Tabun (GA), Sarin (GB), Soman (GD), and VX). Biological agents are those that contain viruses and/or bacterial pathogens or poisonous substances that have been engineered to cause severe illness or death in human beings, animals and vegetation. In their natural state, these pathogens or substances are not normally fatal to living beings and must be amplified or weaponized to become a threat. In addition, biological weapons also require a delivery mechanism. The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) categorizes biological threats into three distinct categories based on lethality, with each category containing specific biological agents. Category A contains the most lethal agents that pose the greatest threat, as they are easily disseminated and have the highest mortality rates [14]. Category A agents include Anthrax- Bacillus anthracis, Botulism- Clostridium botulinum, Plague- Yersinia pestis, Smallpox- Variola virus, Tularemia- Francisella tularensis, and Viral Hemorrhagic Fever Viruses (which includes the Ebola Virus) [15]. Category B agents have a low to moderate morbidity and are less threatening to the general public. Category B agents include Bacterial, Rickettsial, and Protozoal agents (Brucellosis, Glanders, Melioidosis, Q Fever, Psittacosis, Typhus Fever, Cholera, and Cryptosporidiosi); Toxins (Staphylococcus Enterotoxin B, C. Perfringens Epsilon Toxin, and Ricin Toxin); and, Viral agents (Viral Encephalitides, including Venezuelan, Western, and Eastern Equine Encephalitis) [14, 15]. The final category is Category C, which are those pathogens that can be engineered for mass dissemination because they are readily available, have a general ease of production, and their potential for high mortality rates [14]. These include emerging viral pathogens, including Nipah Virus, Hantavirus, which also includes Hantavirus Pulmonary syndrome and Hantavirus Hemorrhagic Fever Syndrome. These pathogens have a higher mortality than Cat B Agents.",

The nuclear threat is the greatest of all threats The concern the world faces is what happens when a terrorist group obtains a nuclear weapon. One thing is for certain, we are in an age where terrorism is almost common place, with terrorists always seeking different ways to achieve mass casualties. The United States and United Nations have worked hard to eliminate the threat of the spread of WMD, but even with the best intentions, it is difficult to maintain enforcement with rogue states and terrorists.
