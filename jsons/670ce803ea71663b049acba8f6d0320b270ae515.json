Analyzing a 2015 national survey of 1,897 U.S. municipalities, we find municipalities that own their water utilities are more likely to report policies to protect lowincome residents from disconnection and implement water resource management. Respondents from 8% of municipalities report protecting residents from disconnection. State economic regulation of publicly owned utilities and Democrat-majority municipal governments are positively associated with local policies to protect low-income households from shutoffs but bear no association with resource management. Both local public ownership of utilities and state economic regulation may play a role in meeting certain local water policy goals.",

A household affordability benchmark used by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency considers when water bills rise above two percent of the community's median household income (Baird, 2010; Czerwinski et al., 2017) . Many researchers emphasize that a metric based upon a community's median household income may not accurately reflect the burden placed on the poorer residents in a water service area (Raucher et al., 2019) . The affordability challenge can be particularly acute in small and rural communities because large cities can capture economies of scale and spread the burden of subsidizing water for low-income households across a wider ratepayer base (Baird, 2010) . Minorities, in particular, suffer the impacts of poor water and sanitation infrastructure (Gasteyer et al., 2016) .

Falling usage generally is also putting pressure on rates (Beecher and Chesnutt, 2012) . For example, Baltimore, Maryland expects to make capital investments to its water and wastewater system in excess of $1 billion (Colton 2017) . However, many of the city's low-income residents cannot afford to pay higher bills, and the number of households paying more than 2.5% of income for water will increase rapidly as water charges rise (Colton, 2017) . In other cities, such as Boston and Detroit, utilities use shutoffs as an enforcement tool, and confusing billing practices contribute to this problem (Amirhadji et al., 2013) . In Michigan, higher water rates fall disproportionately on people of color, usually in older, depopulated cities that have to spread higher costs across fewer people (Butts and Gasteyer, 2011) . When households cannot pay, shutoffs create a \"moral and public health crisis\" for poor residents and neighborhoods but fail to solve the revenue problem for utilities (Swain et al., 2020, p. 5) .",

Other forms of subsidy can come from either the utility (regardless of ownership) as well as from the municipal government. Some programs are utility-funded but run by other organizations. In St. Petersburg and Cocoa, Florida, the municipal water utilities do not have low-income assistance programs, but the cities do (Forrer et al., 2016) . In St. Petersburg, the funding for municipal programs comes from a variety of sources, such as local charities (e.g. United Way or Catholic Charities), religious organizations, state, and federal agencies, but these may be less secure than a utility-funded program. In a study of 80 larger Midwest utilities, just over ten percent provided discounts for low-income customers; another 10 percent had senior discounts; and only about one-quarter had payment assistance programs available (Beecher and Kalmbach, 2013) . Just under half of California's population is served by a water system with a low-income assistance program and the state has proposed implementing standards that provide for a 20 to 50 percent water bill discount to low-income households below 200 percent of the federal poverty level based on water rates (State Water Resources Control Board, 2019; Walton, 2017a). Raleigh, North Carolina passed the city's first water aid bill in 2016, which allows low-income residents to get an annual credit of $240 on their municipal water and sewer bills (Walton, 2017b) .",

However, as access to new water sources becomes more difficult in some areas, efficiency and water resource management become increasingly important, with pricing strategies recognized as an effective demand-side policy tool for reducing water consumption. Although rarely used, pricing strategies can be more effective at inducing conservation than nonprice approaches (Olmstead and Stavins, 2009 ). There are numerous pricing structures meant to incentivize conservation of water, including excess-use surcharges, seasonal rates, and inclining-block rates, where consumers pay a higher rate as they use more water (Smith and Wang, 2008) . Price effects may be more pronounced for low-income households, which face a disproportionate burden of increased rates (Wichman et al., 2016) .",

Beecher and Kalmbach (2013) found that only about 10 percent of utilities in the U.S. Great Lakes region charged higher rates at higher usage levels, which might be explained by water conditions.

In some areas, pressure to privatize can come from the desire for non-governmental investment in infrastructure (Lieberherr and Fuenfschilling, 2016) . Although cities can access capital markets at lower rates, debt limits and fiscal constraints mean that some local governments have limited capacity to fund desired upgrades (Furlong, 2016a) . Private drinking water companies seek to acquire systems where residents have the means to pay, but without substantial political influence to control rate increases (Lieberherr and Fuenfschilling, 2016; Greiner, 2016) .

For the first set of models (Table 2 a, b, & c), we use a binary dependent variable that indicates whether or not a local government has taken action to \"protect low-income households from water service shutoff. \" This phrasing is used in the 2015 sustainability survey and is understood to mean protection from disconnection due to non-payment of water bills. We are not able to distinguish between different kinds of shutoff protection programs. Only eight percent of municipalities in our sample reported having a program in place to protect low-income households from water shutoffs.",

Fifteen percent of communities were metropolitan principal cities or counties, 54 percent suburbs, and 30 percent rural communities. Urban and suburban jurisdictions are somewhat overrepresented and rural underrepresented. Second, the survey only identified whether the local government owned the utility and does not distinguish among other ownership forms, which include private ownership but also other models. Third, the dependent variables in our models only measure the adoption of policies and not their scope or effectiveness. Fourth, the survey only measured if the local government protected residents from water service shutoffs in a yes or no fashion. Shutoff protection policies may also be imposed by the state and implemented by state agencies (namely, PUCs). There are various ways that local governments provide lowincome assistance separate from utilities and numerous ways that such programs are funded (Forrer et al. 2016 ). We do not have more detailed information on the nature of the applicable programs. Fifth, we grouped the four water resource management policies together and are not able to distinguish them. Finally, our analysis is at the municipal, not the utility level. Policies can be implemented at various levels: federal, state, and local. City administrators may not be fully aware of policies expressed only through the utility. Lack of a local policy does not necessarily indicate a lack of policy or activity in an area as it may come from another level.

However, if the state only provides partial regulation, there appears to be no effect on local shutoff policies (Model 2a). We also ran these dependent variables in models that just included places with public ownership (Models 2b and 3b) and those without public ownership (models Models 2c and 3c). Only in the water shutoff protection model does the state PUC play a significant positive role, and only in the states with comprehensive regulation. In the water resource management models (Models 3a and 3b), we see that comprehensive state regulation has no effect and some regulation is associated with a lower likelihood of implementing water resource management policies. Further analysis should assess the scope of PUC regulation in those states with limited regulation to understand what might explain this negative effect.",

Some scholars argue that public ownership of utilities can align with local government policies that include a broader set of values, beyond just cost efficiency, and can better address equity and environmental concerns (Furlong et al., 2018; McDonald, 2018; Hall et al., 2013) . We see evidence of these values, as we find a higher rate of protection from water shutoff and higher use of water resource management measures among localities with publicly owned utilities. What might explain this? Research on sustainability policies, in general, finds that governments with publicly owned utilities are more likely to implement both social equity and environmental policies . Research on the impact of government ownership of electric utilities finds local governments with municipal-owned power companies were more likely to implement sustainability actions in the community for two main reasons (Homsy, 2016) . First, government ownership allowed the utility to reflect the values of the local community. Second, municipalities with publicly owned utilities had access to more capacity to address environmental issues. Our results suggest the same may hold true for water utilities.",

Profit orientation, despite regulation, may push public and community development goals to secondary status (Mann and Warner, 2019; Lobina, 2017) . As communities struggle to deal with the cost of needed water infrastructure investments, privatization may appeal to many local governments, especially those with low capacity, but this may limit the local government's ability to meet local social equity and environmental goals.

State PUC oversight is positively correlated to shutoff protection only under the most comprehensive regulatory regimes. PUCs protect ratepayers in the context of monopolistic operation while ensuring that utilities have the revenue they need to cover their costs. Some legal scholars maintain that PUCs have broader power (Dworkin et al., 2006) . Our empirical analysis indicates that PUC oversight increases the odds that local governments with publicly owned utilities will protect low-income households from water shutoffs. This finding shows PUC regulation is focused on more than just cost recovery (Beecher 2013b ). However, we find PUC oversight is associated with the adoption of fewer water resource management policies in those states with less comprehensive policies. Although PUCs may consider environmental issues in planning, certification and ratemaking, they consider equity and environmental goals in relation to economic goals.",

We expected metro core cities to be more attuned to social equity concerns regarding water shutoffs. It may be that principal cities are more likely to have government-owned utilities organized on an enterprise (or \"corporatized\") basis, whereas suburban and rural communities may treat the water utility as a department integrated within the rest of the local government. If there is a higher degree of corporatization in principal -city water utilities, then transfers (or cross-subsidies) from the general local government budget may not be possible. Scholars have raised concerns that corporatization of publicly owned services can undermine social and environmental objectives because the focus of attention shifts from community development to financial concerns (Clifton et al., 2016; McDonald, 2014) . Future research might include measures of utility corporatization in its various forms to explore these points.",

In the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, many states and cities have placed moratoriums on water shutoffs. Will this continue after the crisis? Local governments and utilities sometimes face tensions when it comes to promoting conservation and maintaining affordability, including pricing strategies (Homsy, 2016 (Homsy, , 2018 Beecher, 2016) . In the interests of equity, utilities will need to find alternatives to disconnecting customers from such a vital resource as water; these options may come in the form of low-income assistance programs, prepaid metering, and the use of flow restrictors (Beecher, 2016) . Some state policies may limit customer-assistance programs (UNC Environmental Finance Center, 2017; Walton, 2017b ), but our research shows state regulation can play a positive role.",

While we found a positive impact of PUC jurisdiction on protecting low-income households, we found a negative association with local water resource management. However, only six state PUCs regulate publicly owned water utilities to a relevant degree. One area for future research is to examine the impact of different state legislative and regulatory policies on publicly and privately owned utilities. While states regulate privately owned water utilities, policies vary. While we find that public ownership of water utilities is more important in achieving sustainability goals, future research could help us clarify whether state economic regulators might play a greater role for different types of utilities. Our study shows the potential importance of both public ownership and state regulation in promoting local equity and environmental policies going forward.",
