Porous silica has been identified as an effective adjuvant for more than a decade, and we have therefore investigated the take up rate by an immortalized macrophage-like cell line of a number of mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNPs) with differing diameter and pore size. The MSNPs were synthesized using a sol-gel reaction and post-synthesis removal of the template. The MSNPs showed a clear distribution in take up rate peaking at 217 nm, whereas a comparison with solid spherical nanoparticles showed a similar distribution peaking at 377 nm. The MSNPs were investigated before and after loading with antigen. Diphtheria toxoid was used as a proof-of-concept antigen and showed a peak macrophage internalization of 53.42% for loaded LP3 particles which had a diameter of 217.75 \u00b1 5.44 nm and large 16.5 nm pores. Optimal MSNP sizes appeared to be in the 200-400 nm range, and larger pores showed better antigen loading. The mesoporous silica particles were shown to be generally biocompatible, and cell viability was not altered by the loading of particles with or without antigen.",

            "text": "Nanovaccinology involves the use of nanometre sized particles as a means to deliver antigen, in order to enhance antigen processing. A variety of engineered nanoparticles have been developed for vaccine development and while they differ in size, shape and composition, they are typically 25-200 nm in diameter (Zhao et al. 2014) . The large surface area to volume ratio of nanoparticles means that the particles may carry a higher proportion of antigen for immune activation. The size of the nanoparticle systems also increases the likelihood that they will accumulate in lymph nodes. This can both increase their effective concentration and reduce systemic reactivity (Nuhn et al. 2016) . Our previous work compared the antigen loading and unloading capacity of mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNPs), with a variety of different pore sizes, and external diameters (Huang et al. submitted) . Herein, we investigate the ability of the different particles to be internalized by antigen-presenting cells. The uptake of nanoparticles, and subsequent immune response, may be due to their intrinsic resemblance to natural viruses (Chattopadhyay et al. 2017) . Since the immune system is primed to recognize viruses, it is not surprising that nanoparticles which can be similar in terms of size, geometry and antigen display could be effective. Soluble antigens are well known to have low efficacy in inducing good protective immunity. This is largely due to the insufficient uptake of the antigen by antigen-presenting cells (APCs). Attaching soluble vaccine antigens to larger carriers can facilitate recognition and uptake by the APCs (Pobre et al. 2014) .",

For our study, we have chosen to investigate the use of silica nanoparticles as a carrier for antigen molecules due to a number of favourable properties: Silica nanoparticles can be synthesized in a range of sizes and shapes and can be controlled using sol-gel chemistry and is a particularly useful material to work with since nanoscale pores can be easily integrated to generate MSNPs which have a very large surface area for carrying antigen. In addition to the size of the particles, charge is also an important parameter. Some studies have shown that cationic nanoparticles show higher uptake due to the interaction with anionic cell membranes (Foged et al. 2005) . However, cationic particles are more likely to induce haemolysis and platelet aggregation than neutral or anionic particles (McCusker et al. 2004 ). The negatively charged silanol groups found on the surface of silica are also beneficial if further modification with additional functional molecules such as those for cell recognition is needed.",

The light scatter plot ( Fig. 1; panel (i)) shows the changes in the populations of cells before and after treatment with PMA to differentiate the cells. The population of cells in the control and after treatment with PMA for 72 h shows homogeneous cell populations, whereas treatment for 48 h is an intermediate state with two populations of cells. To confirm the differentiation of the THP-1 cells, CD-14 expression (a surface marker normally overexpressed in macrophages) was evaluated. An APC-labelled CD-14 antibody shows emission in the 660 nm (red) region and was used to assess the expression of the glycoprotein ( Fig. 1; panel (ii) ). The median fluorescence intensity increases from 3.95 (control) to 14.73 and 20.98 after incubation with PMA for 48 and 72 h, respectively. Therefore, PMA can be seen to have successfully increased the expression of CD-14 and by implication resulted in the differentiation of the cells into macrophages. As further confirmation, the cells were examined microscopically ( Fig. 1; panel (iii) ). The morphology of the cells can be seen to change over the period of incubation with PMA and to give the appearance of macrophages after 72 h.",

However, when using fluorescence as a marker on the particles, it is important to be able to differentiate between cell surface-associated particles and those which have been genuinely internalized. To control for this factor, all experiments were performed at room temperature, and then replicated at low temperature (Johnstone et al. 2001; Gottstein et al. 2013) . Active transport of the nanoparticles into cells ceases under low temperature conditions, and therefore, any fluorescence seen would be due to surface attachment and so was subtracted. It can be seen that uptake increases from SNP01 to SNP03, i.e. in the order 113.25 nm, 275.78 nm and 377.63 nm (Fig. 2a) . Subsequently, there is no significant increase in the amount of 588.00 nm internalized into the macrophages. Once the size reaches 847.25 nm, there is a significant decrease in the amount internalized compared to the peak uptake for 377.63 nm particles. This implies that there may be an optimal size for macrophage uptake of solid spherical silica nanoparticles peaking in the region of 377 nm. Although the individual SBA-15 is not as large as SNP05, the particles are rod-shaped and often severely aggregated, and therefore may not be taken up as readily.",

We therefore investigated the uptake of a series of mesoporous silica particles (Table 2 ). These particles have been previously characterized in terms of their capacity to carry antigen (Huang et al. submitted as Part 1 of 2). The size of the pores and the zeta potential is also reported in Huang et al. submitted as Part 1 of 2. It can clearly be seen that a similar pattern of uptake is seen with the MSNPs with respect to uptake and their external diameter. There is an increase in uptake from SP2 to LP2, i.e. 138 nm, 202.66 nm and 217.20 nm. There is a significant decrease in uptake between LP2 and LP3, LP1, SP3 and SP1, i.e. 217.20 nm and 217.75 nm, 462.33 nm, 496.96 nm and 1509.73 nm. Here, the rod-shaped SBA-15 particles were taken up to a similar extent to LP1, i.e. 612.75 nm and 462.33 nm, respectively. SP3 is only slightly larger than LP1, i.e. 462.33 nm compared to 496.93 nm, yet there is a very significant decrease in uptake. It is not clear why SP3 has a far lower uptake than SBA-15, although the synthesis method is slightly unusual in that it uses glycerol as the co-surfactant and co-solvent [23] . The zeta potential of the particles is all very similar and so not likely to cause significant differences [3] . SP1 has a very large external diameter (1509.73 nm), and this is most likely the reason why this particle has a very low uptake.",

Zeta potential was determined using a Zetasizer Nano ZS (Malvern UK indicates the expression of CD14 on THP-1 cells. Panel (iii) Microscope images show the morphology of the cells the particle surface charge, surface area or morphology that would explain why these two particles in particular had reduced uptake after loading. We therefore looked at the hydrodynamic diameter of two of the MSNPs before and after loading see (Huang et al. An assessment of mesoporous silica nanoparticle architectures as antigen carriers). LP2 showed a very significant decrease in uptake into macrophages after loading. The size before loading was determined to be 217.20 \u00b1 22.66 nm (Fig. 3a) . After incubation with diphtheria toxoid at a ratio of 1:20 for 24 h at 4\u00b0C, the size was 330.91 \u00b1 4.86 nm, an increase of just over 50%. In terms of size the increase in size would place it nearer to LP1 (462.33 \u00b1 25.03 nm). Unloaded LP1 showed considerably reduced uptake compared to LP2, and so, the size increase could explain the reduction in uptake (Fig. 3b) . In contrast, LP3 which was seen to have a modest increase in macrophage uptake after loading only increased in hydrodynamic diameter from 217.75 \u00b1 5.44 nm before loading to 270.61 \u00b1 1.99 nm after loading.",

Bacterial pathogens can differ greatly in their sizes, shapes and surface features, which can all have an effect on virulence (Cabeen and Jacobs-Wagner 2005). This can give indications to the way in which macrophages would interact with man-made materials such as the MSNPs designed to stimulate the immune system. In order to perform their role in the immune system, macrophages engulf particles by the process of phagocytosis (Burke and Lewis 2002). Phagocytosis involves both structural rearrangements of the cytoskeleton and membrane, and also a complex network of signalling events. The process of phagocytosis is affected by the physical parameters of the particles being engulfed. These can be split into geometric aspects such as the size (Pratten and Lloyd 1986; Ikada 1988a, 1988b; Koval et al. 1998) , shape or aspect ratio of the particles (Lengerova et al. 1957; Champion and Mitragotri 2006; Gratton et al. 2008; Sharma et al. 2010; Lu et al. 2010; Champion and Mitragotri 2009) , surface properties Ikada 1988a, 1988b; Faraasen et al. 2003; Roser et al. 1998; Gilberti et al. 2008; Ahsan et al. 2002) and mechanical aspects (Beningo and Wang 2002) .",

Data is presented as mean \u00b1 standard deviation of triplicate samples and significance was tested using a one-tailed t test (*p < 0.05, **p < 0.01; ***p < 0.005) determined whether particles are attached to the surface of the cells, or have been truly internalized. Since the particles were labelled with FITC, they were to be observed via fluorescence. We therefore originally tried the methods which used the fact that trypan blue can quench green fluorescence from FITC (Avelar-Freitas et al. 2014 ). However, we found that the fluorescence was quenched from both external and internalized particles alike, so could not be used to differentiate uptake. We therefore explored the use of sodium azide, an inhibitor of phagocytosis, as a way to differentiate between particles which were phagocytosed compared to those which were merely surface bound. However, sodium azide has been shown to take up to 3 h of contact with cell culture before they have an effect on phagocytosis (Cifarelli et al. 1979 ) and can also inhibit oxidative phosphorylation. Since we were concerned that sodium azide could affect cell viability, this method was also not chosen. Consequently, we used low temperature to inhibit phagocytosis and subtracted any fluorescence which was detected after such treatment since this would be a result of surface-bound particles. The highly cited silica particle SBA-15 was used as a comparison molecule in all our experiments. This is a rod-shaped particle with an aspect ratio of 3:1. Our results showed uptake in the region of 30% (Fig. 2a) . The low uptake is not unexpected since aspect ratio is known to affect uptake, with very high aspect ratios completely inhibiting phagocytosis (Gratton et al. 2008) .",

            "text": "Size has often been considered the most important factor for uptake, and the optimal size for macrophage internalization has been cited as between 1 and 3 \u03bcm (Pratten and Lloyd 1986; Koval et al. 1998; Ikada 1988a, 1988b; Champion et al. 2008) . This was thought to correspond to the size of a number of large bacteria (Kubitschek 1969) . However, our largest particle (SP1; 1509.73 \u00b1 269.93 nm) showed the lowest uptake, and the optimal uptake was for much smaller particles. Of course, as has been the case with regard to aspect ratio, the shape of the particles is also important. In 2006, Champion and Mitragotri first demonstrated that the local shape at the point of contact with the membrane governs whether phagocytosis will be initiated, whilst the size will determine whether the process is completed. In addition to size and shape, the mesoporosity of silica nanoparticles has also been indicated in their biological interactions (Asefa and Tao 2012) . Compared to solid silica nanoparticles, the mesoporosity of the MSNPs results in lower rigidity which buffers the interaction with biological entities. This also results in lowered interfacial energy between the nanomaterials and the biological surfaces. In our study, the greatest uptake for solid particles was for the SNP03 (377 nm) particles, whereas for the mesoporous particles, LP2 (217 nm) had the greatest uptake. However, the uptake for the mesoporous LP2 was slightly higher than for the solid spherical nanoparticle SNP03. The size of the pores on the MSNPs did not seem to affect the uptake, which was related only to external diameter of the particles (Fig. 1) . Surface charge has also been shown to be an important parameter in the degree of uptake of particles. Thiele et al. (2001) found that positively charged particles showed much greater uptake. For non-metallic nanoparticles, there was also a correlation between positive charge and the ability to elicit an immune response. However, negatively charged non-metallic nanoparticles were associated with antigen-specific tolerance (Fromen et al. 2016) . Despite these studies, there still needs to be further investigation into whether a generalized statement with regard to the charge of the nanoparticle and its influence on the immune response. Silica nanoparticles have an inherent negative charge due to silanol groups on the surface. The solid silica nanoparticles synthesized in this study show increasing negative \u03b6 potential with increasing size (Table 1) . It is therefore difficult to separate charge and size in determining which factor contributes to the degree of uptake. The behaviour of the particles with regard to uptake by the macrophages altered after the MSNPs were loaded with DT. The DT has an isoelectric point of 4.1 (Pappenheimer 1937) and therefore under low pH conditions, the DT would be positively charged. The silica is negatively charged and so the DT would be electrostatically attracted. This means that not only would loading with DT potentially change the hydrodynamic size, but also the apparent charge of the loaded particle.",

The material from which a nanoparticle is made has a direct influence on the functions of the antigen-presenting cells (Marques et al. 2017) . Gold nanoparticles are one of the most studied in vaccinology (see Marques et al. 2017 for summary), but other metals such as iron oxide and nickel have also been investigated. Polymers have also been tested and for example, poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) delivery systems have shown adjuvant activity (Nicolete et al. 2011) , with both humoral and cellular responses (O'Hagan and Singh 2003; Men et al. 1999; Carcaboso et al. 2004) . Other materials that have been explored include emulsifying wax (Cui and Mumper 2002) , lecithin-glyceryl monostearate (Sloat et al. 2010) , albumin, gelatin (Zwiorek et al. 2008) , collage, chitosan and alginate (Sloat et al. 2010) . We have chosen to investigate silica since it has the benefit of being easily manipulated to form mesoporous particles which have a very high surface area. MSNPs have been shown to have intrinsic adjuvant activity and to potentiate antigen-specific T cell immune responses (Kupferschmidt et al. 2014; Mahony et al. 2013) . Furthermore, silica is widely reported to be biocompatible, and the nanoparticles degrade (Coppi et al. 2004 ) to the relatively harmless silicic acid (Diaconu et al. 2010) .",

It was seen with both solid and mesoporous silica nanoparticles that smaller particles were less effectively taken up by macrophages. Optimal sizes appeared to be in the 200-400 nm range.
