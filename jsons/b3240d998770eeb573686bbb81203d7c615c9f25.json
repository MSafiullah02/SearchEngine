Among other potential pathogens, we 55 identified one novel orthobunyavirus, tentatively named Nyangole virus, from the blood of a 56 child diagnosed with malaria and pneumonia, and Bwamba orthobunyavirus in the nasopharynx 57 of a child with rash and sepsis. We also identified two novel human rhinovirus C species. 58 59 Conclusions: This exploratory pilot study demonstrates the utility of mNGS and the IDseq 60 platform for defining the molecular landscape of febrile infectious diseases in resource limited 61 areas. These methods, supported by a robust data analysis and sharing platform, offer a new tool 62 for the surveillance, diagnosis, and ultimately treatment and prevention of infectious diseases. 63 64 bioinformatics platform and service for detection of microbial pathogens from metagenomic 91 next-generation sequencing (mNGS) data.

Some discrepancies were seen compared 266 to blood smear readings, with false positive smears probably due to errors in slide reading, a 267 common problem in African clinics [34] , and false negative smears due to the expected greater 268 sensitivity of mNGS for identification of P. falciparum. In children with only sub-microscopic 269 parasitemia, it is uncertain whether fevers can be ascribed to malaria, and in fact many children of parvovirus B19 were found in association with P. falciparum; this co-infection has been 272 associated with severe anemia with life-threatening consequences [35]- [37] . 273 274 HRV was the most commonly identified virus in NP swab samples, consistent with 275 findings previously reported in sub-Saharan Africa and developed countries [38]- [42] . HRV-C 276 was most frequently encountered (54.1%), followed by HRV-A (43.2%) and HRV-B (2.7%), 277 similar to the distribution of HRVs previously reported in Kenya [38] . We identified two novel 278 HRV-C species; these viruses were about 70% identical to the most closely related previously 279 described HRV-C species [20] . Overall, we detected at least three HRV-A and eight HRV-C 280 types co-circulating in Tororo District. Of note, during the same collection period, a lethal HRV-281 C outbreak was reported in chimpanzees in Kibale National Park, in western Uganda [43] . The 282 HRV-C reported in western Uganda was modestly related to an isolate observed in our study 283 (74% nucleotide identity; 81% amino acid identity) (Figure 4) Clinical information was obtained from interviews with parents or guardians, with 375 specific data entered onto a standardized case record form that included admission diagnosis and 376 physical examination as well as malaria blood smear results. For malaria diagnosis, thick blood 377 smears were Giemsa stained and evaluated by Tororo District Hospital laboratory personnel 378 following routine standard-of-care practices. No efforts were made to improve on routine 379 practice, so malaria smear readings represent routine standard-of-care rather than optimal quality 380 controlled reads. For this study we report species greater than 0 rpM and Z-scores detected in the serum, 424 stool, and NP samples. Consistent with previous studies, low levels of \"index bleed through\" or 425 \"barcode hopping\" (assignment of sequencing reads to the wrong barcode/index) was observed 426 within the non-templated control samples [61] . To prevent mis-assignment, when a microbe 427 found in more than one sample, it was reported only when present at levels at least four times the 428 level of mis-assigned reads observed in the control samples. Given the extremely high levels of 429 rotavirus found in stool samples, these samples were run in duplicate, and only microbes 430 identified in both samples and present at levels at least four times the number of reads mis-431 not species-specific, we reported the corresponding genus.

In the past, 70 febrile illness in children under five years of age in most of Africa was treated empirically as 71 malaria due to the limited availability of diagnostics and the risk of untreated malaria progressing 72 to life-threatening illness. This strategy changed with new guidelines from the World Health 73 Organization (WHO) in 2010, which recommend limiting malaria therapy to those with a 74 confirmed diagnosis [3]. However, standard recommendations for management of febrile 75 children who do not have malaria are lacking. Increased knowledge about the prevalence of non-76 malarial pathogens associated with fever is needed to inform management strategies for febrile 77 children who do not have malaria [2]. 78 79 Advances in genome sequencing hold promise for addressing global infectious disease 80 challenges by enabling unbiased detection of microbial pathogens without requirement for the 81 extensive infrastructure of modern microbiology laboratories [4], [5]. Although sequence-based 82 diagnostics have not yet replaced most traditional microbiological assays, this situation is 83 rapidly changing, as sequence-based strategies are incorporated for clinical care [6]-[10], and 84 costs have declined dramatically over the past decade [11]. A significant roadblock toward 85 implementation of sequence-based diagnostics is the extensive computational requirements and 86 bioinformatics expertise required. In fact, as sequencing costs decline, computational expenses 87 may proportionally increase due to inevitable expansion of existing genomic databases. 88",

IDseq scripts and user instructions are 393 available at https://github.com/chanzuckerberg/idseq-dag and the graphical user interface web 394 application for sample upload is available at https://github.com/chanzuckerberg/idseq-web. 395 IDseq is conceptually based on previously implemented platforms [5], [31], [32], but is 396 optimized for scalable Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud deployment. Bioinformatics data 397 processing jobs are carried out on demand as Docker containers using AWS Batch. Alignments 398 to the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) database are executed on 399 dedicated auto scaling groups (ASG) of Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instances, with 400 the number of server instances varied with job load. Fast downloads of the NCBI database from 401 the Amazon Simple Storage Service to each new server instance are enabled by the open-source 402 tool s3mi (https://github.com/chanzuckerberg/s3mi). Initial alignment and removal of reads 403 derived from the human genome is performed using the Spliced Transcripts Alignment to a 404 Reference (STAR) algorithm [55]. Low-quality reads, duplicates, and low-complexity reads are 405 then removed using the Paired-Read Iterative Contig Extension (PRICE) computational package 406 [56], the CD-HIT-DUP tool [57], and a filter based on the Lempel-Ziv-Welch (LZW) 407 compression score, respectively. A second round of human read filtering is carried out using nucleotide and non-redundant protein databases (updated monthly) using GSNAPL and 410 RAPSearch2 [59], [60], respectively. Reads matching GenBank records in the superphylum 411 Deuterostomia are removed, given the high likelihood that such residual reads are of human 412 origin. The relative abundance of microbial taxa is calculated based on reads per million (rpM) 413 mapped at the genus level. To distinguish potential pathogens from ubiquitous environmental 414 agents including commensal flora, a Z-score is calculated for the value observed for each genus 415 relative to a background of healthy and no-template control samples [31]. An overview of this 416 pipeline is represented in Figure 1. 417 418 IDseq can process 150 samples at a given time. As of this writing, the current version of 419 the IDseq pipeline (IDseqv1.8) processes fastq files with approximately 70 million reads, 420 typically containing >99% host sequence, in 34 minutes. Run times may vary depending on 421 demand, percentage of non-host sequence, and autoscaling parameters. 422 423",

            "text": "[43]. Our results confirm that a 284 wide spectrum of HRVs infects Ugandan children. In addition to HRV, we detected a spectrum 285 of other known respiratory viruses, including RSV, human parainfluenza viruses, human 286 coronaviruses, and adenovirus. 287Diarrheal disease is one of the leading causes of death in children in Africa[44]. 289Approximately 48% of febrile children in our study presented with diarrhea, but due to logistical 290 constraints stool specimens were available for only 10 cases. Rotavirus A, the leading cause of 291 pediatric diarrhea worldwide[45], was the most commonly identified pathogen in this cohort. 292Rotavirus vaccination, known to be highly effective, is yet to be implemented in Uganda, but the 293 B. hominis and several enteroviruses in stool specimens. Enteroviruses, HRV-C, and 295 mamastrovirus were also identified in the serum of three children with clinical diagnoses of 296Unbiased inspection of microbial sequences from sera revealed a novel member of the 299 orthobunyavirus genus, tentatively named Nyangole virus, which was identified as a co-infection 300 with P. falciparum in a child with clinical diagnoses of malaria and pneumonia. The virus was 301 surprisingly divergent from known viruses, with an average amino acid similarity of 51.6% to its 302 nearest known relatives including Calchaqui, Anopheles A and Kaeng Khoi viruses. Mosquitoes 303 have been proposed as a vector for Calchaqui and Anopheles A viruses; Kaeng Khoi virus has 304 been isolated from bedbugs [46]-[48]. Antibodies to these viruses have been detected in human 305 sera, but their role as human pathogens is uncertain [46]-[49]. While the depth of coverage of 306 Nyangole virus sequence in our patient suggests significant viremia, and other orthobunyaviruses 307 are responsible for severe human illnesses (e.g., California encephalitis virus, La Crosse virus, 308 Jamestown Canyon virus, and Cache Valley virus) [50], it is unknown whether the identified 309 virus was responsible for the presenting symptoms. 310 311 NP swab analysis identified another Orthobunyavirus, Bwamba virus, in a child admitted 312 with rash, sepsis and diarrhea. This virus has previously been described to cause fever in Uganda 313 [51]. Our identification of two orthobunyaviruses, including one novel virus, in a small sample 314 of febrile Ugandan children suggests that the landscape of previously unidentified viruses that 315 infect African children and potentially cause febrile illness, is significantly under explored. 316 WHO Essential Medicines List was identified in this study[52]. Three children had genotypic 318 evidence of ESBL producing organisms predicted to be resistant to ceftriaxone, a frontline 319 antibiotic for severe infections in this region[53]. In addition, one of these three children carried 320 IMP-1, which also confers resistance to carbapenems, a class of antibiotics reserved for the most 321Our exploratory pilot study had important limitations. First, our samples were not 324 collected randomly, but rather were a convenience sample due to the logistical constraints of our 325 small clinical study; as such the results should not be seen as broadly representative of pathogens 326infecting Ugandan children. In particular, the lack of identification of bacteremia in study 327 subjects may have been due to a relative paucity of severe illness, compared to that in other 328 studies, in our cohort of admitted children. Second, clinical evaluation of children followed the 329 standards of a rural African hospital, so diagnostic evaluation was limited to physical 330 examination and malaria blood smears. Much more may be learned by linking rigorous clinical 331 evaluation with mNGS results, and thereby more comprehensively assessing associations 332 between clinical syndromes and specific pathogens.333 Despite these limitations, our study demonstrates the utility of the mNGS/IDseq platform, 335 and provides an important cross sectional snapshot of causes of fever in African children. 336 Combining unbiased mNGS and the IDseq platform enabled the identification of likely known 337 and novel causes of pediatric illness, and makes available a powerful new open access tool for 338 the characterization of infectious diseases in resource limited settings This study provides a snapshot of pediatric fever in Tororo District, Uganda. mNGS 341 permits universal pathogen detection using a single assay, and thus avoids the need for multiple 342 independent, and often costly tests to determine disease etiology. Despite the promise and 343 decreasing costs of this technology, the extensive computational and bioinformatic infrastructure 344 needed to perform analysis of sequencing data remains a major barrier to implementation of 345 mNGS in the developing world. Here we address the need for bioinformatic democratization and 346 computational capacity building with IDseq, an open access platform to bring infectious disease 347surveillance to regions where it is needed most. As progress is made toward elimination of 348 malaria in sub-Saharan Africa, it will be increasingly important to understand the landscape of 349 pathogens that account for the remaining burden of morbidity and mortality. The use of mNGS 350can contribute importantly to this understanding, offering unbiased identification of infecting 351We studied children admitted to Tororo District Hospital, Tororo, Uganda, with febrile 357 illnesses. Potential subjects were identified by clinic staff, who notified study personnel, who 358 NP swabs and blood were collected from each enrolled subject within 24 hours of 365 hospital admission. Approximately 5 ml of blood was collected by phlebotomy, the sample was 366 centrifuged at room temperature, and serum was then stored at -80\u00b0C. NP swab samples 367",

Assembled contigs were queried against 440 the NCBI nt database using BLAST to identify the closest related microbes. GenBank annotation 441 files from genome sequence records corresponding to the highest scoring alignments were used 442 to identify potential features within the de novo assembled genomes. Geneious v10.3.2 was used 443 to annotate newly assembled genomes. Reference genomes for multiple sequence alignments and 444 phylogenetic analyses were downloaded from NCBI. Multiple sequence alignments were 445 generated using ClustalW in MEGA v6.0 and the Geneious aligner in Geneious v10.3.2. 446 Neighbor-joining phylogenetic trees were generated using Geneious v10.3.2 and further assessed 447 using FigTree v1.4.3. Annotation of protein domains in the novel orthobunyaviruses was 448 performed using the InterPro webserver [67] as well as direct alignment against previously 449 known orthobunyaviruses. The TOPCONS webserver [68] was used for the identification of 450 transmembrane regions and signal peptides, and the NetNglyc 1.0 Server 451 (http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/NetNGlyc/) for the identification of glycosylation sites. 452 Evaluation of NP microbiome diversity: 454 analysis patients were stratified into two categories based on clinical assignment: respiratory 456 infections (admitting diagnosis of pneumonia, respiratory tract infection, or bronchiolitis; n=52) 457 and all other syndromes (n=39); cases with unknown admitting diagnosis were excluded. SDI 458 was calculated in R using the Veganv2.4.4 package on genus-level reads per million values for 459 all microbes, including bacteria. A Wilcox Rank Sum test was used to evaluate differences in 460 SDI between patients in the two categories. 461Antimicrobial resistance gene identification in nasopharynx and stool: 463The SRST2 computational package was used to identify antimicrobial resistance genes 464 using the Argannot2 database as previously described[21]. We defined extended spectrum \u03b2-465 lactamase (ESBL) as a \u03b2-lactamase conferring resistance to the penicillins, first-, second-, and466 third-generation cephalosporins including the gene classes proposed by Giske et al [69]. 467 Availability of data and code 469 All raw data have been deposited under Bioproject ID: PRJNA483304.
