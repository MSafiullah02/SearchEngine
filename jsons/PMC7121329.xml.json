            "text": "Although the genetic lineages of mice and humans diverged around 75 million years ago, these two species have evolved to live together, particularly since the development of agriculture. For millennia, mice (Mus musculus) were considered to be pests due to their propensity to ravenously consume stored foodstuff (mush in ancient Sanskrit means \u201cto steal\u201d [1]) and their ability to adapt to a wide range of environmental conditions. Since the 1700s, domesticated mice have been bred and kept as companion animals, and in Victorian England, \u201cfancy\u201d mice were prized for their variations in coat color and comportment; these mouse strains were the forerunners to the strains used in the laboratory today. Robert Hooke performed the first recorded inquiry-driven experiments on mice in 1664, when he investigated the effects of changes in air pressure on respiratory function [2]. More recently, with data from the Human Genome Project and sequencing of the Mus musculus genome showing remarkable genetic homology between these species, as well as the advent of biotechnology and the development of myriad knockout and transgenic mouse strains, it is clear why the mouse has become the most ubiquitous model organism used to study human disease. In addition, their small size, rapid breeding, and ease of handling are all important advantages to scientists for practical and financial reasons. However, keeping in mind that mice are fellow vertebrates and mammals, there are ethical issues inherent to using these animals in medical research. This chapter will provide an overview of the important similarities and differences between Mus musculus and Homo sapiens and their relevance to the use of the mouse as a model organism and provide specific examples of the quality of mouse models used to investigate the mechanisms, pathology, and treatment of human lung diseases. We will then conclude with an assessment of the future of mice in medical research considering ethical and technological advances.",

This was achieved using a number of genomic approaches (e.g., RNA-seq, DNase-seq, and ChIP-seq) to assess gene expression in over 100 mouse cell types and tissues; the data were then compared with the human genome.",

In essence, mice and humans demonstrate genetic similarity with regulatory divergence. Specifically, there is a high degree of similarity in transcription factor networks but a great deal of divergence in the cis-regulatory elements that control gene transcription in the mouse and human genomes. Moreover, the chromatin landscape in cell types of similar lineages in mouse and human is both developmentally stable and evolutionarily conserved [3]. Of particular relevance regarding modeling human diseases involving the immune system, in its assessment of transcription factor networks, the Mouse ENCODE Consortium revealed potentially important differences in the activity of ETS1 in the mouse and human genome. Although conserved between the two species, divergence in ETS1 regulation may be responsible for discrepancies in the function of the immune system in mouse and human [4]. Certainly, the biological consequences of these differences in gene expression and regulation between human and mouse invite further investigation.",

Size influences many aspects of biology, particularly the metabolic rate, which is correlated to body size in placental mammals through the relationship BMR = 70 \u00d7 mass (0.75), where BMR is the basal metabolic rate (in kcal/day). Thus, the mouse BMR is roughly seven times faster than that of an average-sized human [6]. This higher BMR has effects on thermoregulation, nutrient demand, and nutrient supply. As such, mice have greater amounts of metabolically active tissues (e.g., liver and kidney) and more extensive deposits of brown fat [6]. Furthermore, mice more readily produce reactive oxygen species than do humans, which is an important consideration when modeling human diseases involving the induction of oxidative stress (i.e., aging, inflammation, and neurodegeneration) [6].",

            "text": "The lung provides an excellent example of the similarities and differences between human and mouse anatomy. Similar to the human organ, the mouse lung is subdivided into lobes of lung parenchyma containing a branching bronchial tree and is vascularized by the pulmonary circulation originating from the right ventricle. There are a number of subtle variations in this general structure between species, i.e., the number of lobes on the right and left, the branching pattern, and the distribution of cartilage rings around the large airways, but the most important differences between the mouse and human lung are related to the organism\u2019s size (airway diameter and alveolar size are naturally much smaller in the mouse) and respiratory rate. Moreover, there are important differences in the blood supply of the large airways in humans versus mice [7]. Specifically, the bronchial circulation (a branch of the high-pressure systemic circulation that arises from the aorta and intercostal arteries) supplies a miniscule proportion of the pulmonary tissue in mice (the trachea and bronchi) compared to humans; the majority of the lung parenchyma is supplied by the low-pressure, high-flow pulmonary circulation. In the mouse, these systemic blood vessels do not penetrate into the intraparenchymal airways, as they do in larger species [8]. This difference, although subtle, has important ramifications regarding the vascular supply of lung tumors which, in humans, is primarily derived from the systemic circulation [9]. These differences may also have profound consequences when modeling human diseases involving the lung vasculature.",

However, the finer details of the mouse and human immune systems differ considerably, which is not surprising since these species diverged 75 million years ago [6].

In humans with allergic asthma, environmental allergen exposure occurs at the airway mucosa; the immune response is coordinated in the bronchopulmonary lymph nodes, and the T cells, macrophages, and eosinophils recruited as part of this response travel to the lung where they mediate the cardinal features of asthma: airway inflammation, structural remodeling of the airway wall, and airway hyperreactivity [38]. Ideally, these features should be found in a physiologically relevant mouse model of asthma. However, for the sake of cost and convenience, early mouse models of asthma used the surrogate protein ovalbumin (OVA) [31] rather than an environmental allergen to induce an immune response, which also requires the use of a powerful TH2-polarizing adjuvant such as alum delivered via the intraperitoneal route, followed by OVA nebulization\u2014a clear divergence from the etiology of human asthma [36]. In terms of disease presentation, mice develop some hallmarks of asthma, including airway eosinophilic inflammation, goblet cell metaplasia, and increased airway smooth muscle density [31]. After the cessation of OVA exposure, most of the remodeling resolves, although some structural alterations remain up to 1 month after the last challenge [39]. Based on these attributes, the OVA model is primarily a model to investigate the initiation of inflammation, rather than the chronic progression and maintenance of inflammation [31].",

In addition, HDM has inherent allergenic properties, likely due to components with protease activity [40], so there is no need to use an adjuvant, thus improving the etiological similarity of these models with the clinical situation [41]. In contrast to OVA, prolonged exposure of HDM (up to 7 weeks) induces asthma-like severe airway inflammation with prominent eosinophilia, severe hyperreactivity to methacholine, and robust remodeling of the airway wall [41], i.e., the presentation of chronic respiratory HDM exposure in mice effectively recapitulates the key features of human allergic asthma. Importantly, the airway structural changes induced by chronic HDM exposure, such as increased collagen deposition, airway smooth muscle thickening, and microvascular alterations, persist for at least 4 weeks after the cessation of HDM exposure [42], another commonality with human asthma in which airway remodeling is currently considered to be irreversible.",

Mice are very tolerant to CS, but eventually (over a period of several weeks), CS induces pulmonary neutrophilic inflammation that is associated with some degree of tissue degradation and destruction [51]. An important advantage of this model is the fact that CS is the actual irritant responsible for disease in humans, and mice develop several features similar to the clinical disease, making this model highly clinically relevant [27]. A significant drawback is the self-limitation of the model\u2014the pathological changes do not progress after the cessation of CS exposure [51]. Furthermore, the exposure time needed for mice to develop COPD-like pathology is extensive, i.e., studies have shown that an exposure protocol of 5 days per week for a minimum of 3 months is needed to generate robust structural changes to the lung [52]. The pathological image in COPD is complex and varies greatly between patients, commonly encompassing chronic bronchitis and bronchiolitis, emphysema, fibrosis, and airway obstruction. Although mice develop some of these symptoms when exposed to CS, they do not develop all the symptoms of human disease; thus, CS has advantages as a model but fails to mimic the complexity of the clinical situation and disease presentation [27].",

This approach mimics the emphysematous changes seen in COPD, but the pathological process underlying tissue destruction is likely very different compared to the clinical situation [51], as very few patients show evidence of elastase dysregulation [27]. However, if the aim of the study is to investigate the general effect of protease-induced tissue destruction and regeneration, then this is a highly relevant method [51]. Some studies on COPD have also used genetically modified animals, such as mice overexpressing collagenase, which results in tissue destruction without inflammation or fibrosis with an end result fairly similar to the type of emphysema observed in COPD [53].",

Furthermore, as it is used throughout the world, studies performed in different labs and by different groups can be compared relatively easily.

Furthermore, fibrosis is heterogeneous\u2014it develops where the bleomycin solution is deposited. The solution usually deposits within the central lung, a localization that is not in agreement with the clinical situation where fibrosis is located in the more distal regions of the lung parenchyma. In addition, the fibrosis that develops as a result of severe tissue damage is self-limiting and reversible, unlike what is observed clinically [58]. The severe degree of tissue damage induced by bleomycin may in fact be more relevant for modeling acute lung injury (ALI) or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).",

In contrast to local administration, this route requires multiple administrations and is thus more labor-intensive [58]. Some studies have described the usage of osmotic mini-pumps, where bleomycin is slowly administered over a short period of time, and then fibrosis continues to develop over subsequent weeks [60]. Irrespective of the route of delivery, systemic administration results in more homogenous fibrosis, affecting the entire lung through the pulmonary endothelium and persisting much longer than following local administration [61]. The main advantages of systemic administration are that inflammation is limited, while the fibrosis is more apparent and displays a more distal pattern, all of which mimics the clinical situation relatively well. The multiple administrations allow for lower doses with each injection; this is less stressful to the animals and results in little to no mortality [61] and is thus more ethically acceptable. A major disadvantage with this model is that it takes time for fibrosis to develop [58], which may be the reason it is used relatively scarcely, and thus the pathological development is less well-understood. In addition, as IPF is a local disease, local administration of the etiologic agent may better mimic the clinical reality [56].",

The benefits of this model are mainly related to the persistent fibrosis that does not appear to be self-limiting, thus reflecting the clinical situation, and it is also very easy to determine which part of the lung has been exposed to FITC, as the molecule is fluorescent [58]. It is also an advantage that both C57BL/6 and BALB/c mice are susceptible and develop fibrosis following FITC administration [56]. The disadvantages of this model include profound variability due to differences between batches of FITC, as well as in the method used to prepare the solution before instillation.

Moreover, adenoviruses display significant tropism for epithelial cells and rarely infect other cell types such as fibroblasts [58], which are the cells meant to be targeted in this model. As TGF-\u03b2 has major effects on fibroblast biology, the main feature of this model is the effect of epithelium-derived TGF-\u03b2 on fibroblasts and myofibroblasts, resulting in the deposition of ECM proteins and areas of dense fibrosis [63].

Following the administration of silica particles, fibrotic nodules develop in mouse lungs, with considerable resemblance to the human lesions that develop after exposure to mineral fibers [56]. The fibrotic response is accompanied by a limited inflammatory response, and different pro-fibrotic cytokines such as TGF-\u03b2, platelet-derived growth factor, and IL-10 are involved in disease development, which is in accordance with the clinical situation [56]. Another advantage is that nodules develop around silica fibers, and these fibers are easy to identify by light microscopy. The response in this model is strain-dependent, with C57BL/6 mice being the most susceptible. The main drawbacks are the time required to establish disease, i.e., 30\u201360 days, and the need for special equipment to aerosolize the silica particles.

An assessment of the procedures used and the effects of the substance on the animal, as well as the degree of handling, restraint, and analgesia, are other important aspects of refinement. This standard of animal care is achieved through strict regulations and controls on how personnel are trained to carry out experiments on live animals. Adequate training is an important aspect of refinement and should be reviewed and improved on an ongoing basis. Moreover, refinement can be achieved by improving animal housing by environmental enrichment, e.g., providing a place for mice to hide in the cage and housing social animals such as mice in appropriate-sized groups. These simple changes can improve the physiological and behavioral status of research animals; this not only increases animal well-being but also contributes to the quality of the experimental results by reducing stress levels.",

            "text": "The 3Rs aspect of reduction focuses on the statistical power of experiments and by following the Animal Research: Reporting of In Vivo Experiments (ARRIVE) guidelines, originally published in PLOS Biology in 2010. These guidelines provide a framework to improve the reporting of research performed on live animals by maximizing the quality of the scientific data and by minimizing unnecessary studies. The ARRIVE guidelines provide a checklist of aspects that must be considered in good quality research using live animals. The guidelines are most appropriate for comparative studies involving two or more groups of experimental animals with at least one control group, but they also apply to studies involving drug dosing in which a single animal is used as its own control (within-subject experiments). The guidelines provide recommendations on what should be considered when preparing to report on the results of experiments involving live animals, i.e., by providing a concise but thorough background on the scientific theory and why and how animals were used to test a hypothesis, a statement on ethical approvals and study design including power and sample size calculations, a clear description of the methods used to ensure repeatability, objective measurements of outcomes and adverse effects, and interpretation of the results in light of the available literature and the limitations of the study. In addition to the positive impact of the ARRIVE guidelines on reducing the number of animals used in experiments, this checklist provides an easy-to-follow roadmap on what is required for good quality reporting of experimental results.",

The benefits of animal research have been vital to the progress of medical science; abandoning these studies would have severe negative consequences on human health. By considering aspects such as the 3Rs and the ARRIVE guidelines in planning experiments involving live animals, the number of animals used and suffering of these animals for the benefit of human health can be minimized. This requires a strong regulatory framework such as that found in the UK and many other countries, as well an ongoing public debate on the advantages and limitations of animal experimentation.",
