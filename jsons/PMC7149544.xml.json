To some extent, this chapter represents all other possible linkages between transportation and public health. In this chapter, we examine two major categories of public health concerns relating to transportation\u2014those that relate to what is carried by transportation systems (people, goods, and pathogens) and those that relate to direct and indirect consequences when transportation systems are disrupted. In the first category, we will examine three major topics, transportation's role in (1) transmitting infectious diseases (e.g., enabling pandemics), (2) the transfer of invasive species in the natural environment, and (3) transporting hazardous materials. The two topics examined in the second category are climate change and disaster response. In each of these cases, the transportation system is either a contributor to public health consequences (a carrier of infected persons or animals) and/or a contributor to mitigating the negative public health outcomes (e.g., evacuation or disaster recovery routes).",

In addition, the social, economic, and environmental conditions today are very different than those of the past. Modern medicines, population monitoring for early onslaught of illness, and a medical establishment prepared to handle emergencies might suggest that the epidemic/pandemic outcomes of the past (where tens of millions died) would not likely occur today. However, at the same time, the more extensive and interconnected global air system (permitting more rapid and dispersed transmittal of communicable diseases) and the ability of small groups of individuals (terrorists) to manufacture and deliver biological weapons are much greater today. These considerations would suggest that such epidemic/pandemic outcomes might be even more serious than those of the past.",

In the course of many types of trips, there are many surfaces that have been touched by other people. Medical science has known for some time that sneezing, coughing, talking, and even breathing can carry pathogens that expose others nearby. Pathogens are also easily transferred from one person to another by the touching of infected surfaces that are used by many different people over the course of a day (e.g., ticket machines, turnstiles, door handles, poles or straps in subway cars that provide support against vehicle acceleration, and toilet facilities). To the extent that pathogens or toxins are transmitted to others on a journey (either through physical contact or airborne), it is the transportation system that permits this to happen. Some research indicates, for example, that very small droplets from a sneeze can in fact travel around 200 feet (Kopman, 2014). On airplanes, a study conducted by the US National Academies found that for people seated within a seat or two to the side of someone who is infected, or within one row forward or backward, the chances of catching a contagious virus were about 80%; outside of that immediate radius; however, the risk was much lower\u2014only about 3%.",

The conventional rationale for the Black Death was that rats carrying infected fleas traveled in ships bringing with them the plague, starting in harbor cities or in major centers of commerce and then spreading as the rats moved inland. Such an explanation is now questioned given the examination of plague-caused death patterns and the rapidity with which it spread (which does not conform with how fast rats could propagate throughout Europe). Sea transportation is still viewed as a major vehicle in the plague's initial spread, but a leading hypothesis is that it was the human, land-based contact that spread the disease so quickly after being introduced in port cities (Tatem et al., 2006). Historians estimate that worldwide about 50 million people died in the initial plague; in Europe, plague-caused deaths represented between 25% and 60% of the population. An estimated 200 million people died over the three major plague outbreaks from the 14th to 17th centuries.",

It resulted in an almost 10-year drop in the calculated average life expectancy of the global population (Palese, 2004). In the United States, over one-third of the population was affected and 500,000 people died. The virus spread around the world due to many reasons, such as the widespread dislocation of large populations due to World War I. However, many explanations focus on the predominant use of crowded intercity and international modes of travel (that is, rail and ocean liners). It is not surprising to note that some of the most severe outbreaks of influenza centered on shipyards and train stations. In Sweden, major outbreaks or cases were reported in large workplaces such as factories, telegraph and telephone stations, and the tram and railway stations (Holmberg, 2017).",

With an estimated case fatality rate in the range of 0.1%\u20130.28%, the outbreak killed about one million people globally.

The disease also spread along trade routes to the west as far as southern Russia. Each successive pandemic increased in extent and severity, reflecting the expanding reach of the global transport system and increased movements of people, particularly on religious pilgrimages.

            "text": "Public health and transportation officials agree that being prepared for possible infectious diseases and having strategies, plans, and protocols in place for dealing with such threats at the first sign of infection is an important first step. This step will vary by level and responsibility of government (see Chapter 3). For example, some of the key observations/conclusions from the first US influenza pandemic plan included the following (Homeland Security Council, 2006).Federal Government Response to a PandemicThe goals of the Federal Government response to a pandemic are to (1) stop, slow, or otherwise limit the spread of a pandemic to the United States; (2) limit the domestic spread of a pandemic, and mitigate disease, suffering and death; and (3) sustain infrastructure and mitigate impact to the economy and the functioning of society.Homeland Security Council. 2006. National Strategy for Pandemic Influenza\n\u2022\u201cThe center of gravity of the pandemic response will be in communities. The distributed nature of a pandemic, as well as the sheer burden of disease across the nation over a period of months or longer, means that the federal government's support will be limited.\u2022The federal government will bear primary responsibility for certain critical functions, including (1) support of containment efforts overseas, and limiting arrivals at ports of entry; (2) guidance on protective measures; (3) modifications to the law and regulations to facilitate the national pandemic response; (4) modifications to monetary policy to mitigate the economic impact of a pandemic on communities and the nation; (5) procurement and distribution of vaccine and antiviral medications; and (6) acceleration of research and development of vaccines and therapies during the outbreak.\u2022The Secretary of Homeland Security is responsible for coordinating federal operations and resources, establishing reporting requirements, and conducting ongoing communications with federal, state, local, and tribal governments, the private sector, and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs).\u2022The Secretary of Health and Human Services will lead federal health and medical response efforts and will be the principal federal spokesperson for public health issues.\u2022Measures at the borders might provide an opportunity to slow the spread of a pandemic to and within the United States but are unlikely to prevent it. Moreover, the sheer volume of traffic and the difficulty of developing screening protocols to detect an influenza-like illness pose significant challenges.\u2022Measures to limit domestic travel may delay the spread of disease. These restrictions could include a range of options, such as reductions in non-essential travel and, as a last resort, mandatory restrictions \u2026. Communities, states, the private sector, and the federal government will need to carefully weigh the costs and benefits of transportation measures when developing their response plans, including the effectiveness of an action in slowing the spread of a pandemic, its social and economic consequences, and its operational feasibility.\u2022In order to ensure that international arrivals undergo proper screening protocols and are subject to isolation and quarantine if appropriate, the number of airports accepting international flights will be limited early in a pandemic.\u2022Managing air passengers who might be infected with an influenza virus having pandemic potential includes isolation of ill persons, quarantine of all non-ill travelers (and crew), and targeted treatment and prophylaxis with antiviral medications.\u2022The risk of influenza transmission by cargo is low (inanimate ship-borne cargo poses low risk, and routine surfaces are easily decontaminated).\u2022State, local, tribal, and private sector entities should assess the systemic effects on freight delivery such as supply chain impact, just-in-time delivery, warehousing, and logistics They should develop contingency plans in the event of loss of critical services such as the delivery of essential commodities (e.g., chlorine for water purification, gasoline, food, and medical supplies).\u2022The federal government recommends that governmental entities and private sector organizations assume that up to 40% of their staff may be absent for periods of about 2 weeks at the height of a pandemic wave, with lower levels of staff absent for a few weeks on either side of the peak.\u2022Due to stresses placed upon the health-care system and other critical functions, civil disturbances and breakdowns in public order may occur. Likewise, emergency call centers may be overwhelmed with calls for assistance, including requests to transport influenza victims. Local law enforcement agencies may be called upon to enforce movement restrictions or quarantines thereby diverting resources from traditional law enforcement duties. To add to these challenges, law enforcement and emergency response agencies can also expect to have their uniform and support ranks reduced significantly as a result of the pandemic. Private sector entities responsible for securing critical infrastructure will face similar challenges.\u201d\n",

Because they grow so fast, large populations of zebra mussels filtering water can severely impact native plankton, which reduces food for fish (Earthrangers, 2014).2.Earthworms: The first earthworms in Minnesota probably arrived with soils and plants brought from Europe when ships using rocks and soil as ballast dumped the soil on shore as they adjusted the ballast weight of the ship. They also were most likely included with imported European plants. The earthworms are causing major damage to hardwood forests in Minnesota (Minnesota Department of Natural Resources, 2019).3.Asian long-horned beetle: Often encased in wooden packaging materials and trees, the larvae of Asian longhorn beetles eat soft sappy bark, which makes it hard for nutrients to reach other parts of a tree. As they grow, the larvae burrow into the middle of the tree leaving large tunnels as they move, making the tree physically weaker. Many trees do not survive once they are infested with Asian longhorn beetles (Earthrangers, 2014).4.Asian tiger mosquito: The Asian tiger mosquito entered the United States in shipments of used tires from northern Asia in the mid-1980s. It is a potential vector of encephalitis, dengue (all four serotypes), yellow fever, and dog heartworm. West Nile virus has been detected in this species in the eastern United States (Center for Invasive Species Research, 2016).5.Northern Pacific seastars: Also brought in ballast water, Northern Pacific seastars have a voracious appetite, eating almost anything they can find. They are believed to be the major reason for the decline of several species of fish (Earthrangers, 2014).\n",

The International Convention for the Control and Management of Ships' Ballast Water and Sediments (2004) and the Convention on Biological Diversity (1992) served as the basis for the guidelines. The Convention requires participating nations to have a ballast water management plan to help avoid disrupting native ecosystems with invasive aquatic species (Wiant, 2017). Two methods can be used to implement such a plan: (1) using a Ballast Water Exchange Standard, which requires ships to exchange a minimum of 95% ballast water volume at least 50 nautical miles from the nearest shore and in waters of 200 m depth or more (helping prevent invasive species spreading in coastal and shallow waters that are one of the most vulnerable to invasive species) and (2) using a Ballast Water Performance Standard, which establishes thresholds for the presence of aquatic organisms in the ballast water. The water quality limits may be achieved through physical and/or chemical treatment methods.",

Once an invasive species is established in the United States, the next strategy is to control and eradicate it with a variety of actions. These include physical removal, introducing natural predators (which as noted earlier can become themselves a problem), affecting the reproduction environment, or ultimately adopting public health strategies for dealing with the diseases or illnesses borne by the species (e.g., protecting vulnerable populations against mosquito-borne disease outbreaks).",

From a public health perspective, the invasive species concern is perhaps not as significant as that represented by infectious diseases being carried by passengers. But with changing climatic conditions, newly introduced diseases following transportation vectors could well represent an increasingly important public health issue.

Although the exact steps to develop such a plan will vary by community, the general steps can be described as follows (the description is generally adopted from the Federal Emergency Management Agency) (FEMA, 2013):1.Identify participantsParticipants should include members with diverse experience in the execution of the plan. The group's collective expertise should include experience in planning; knowledge of the community; experience with the local response forces; and knowledge of hazardous materials, their effects, and appropriate medical treatments.2.Analyze risksThe process should identify the community's potential hazardous materials risks primarily through the use of reports submitted by local industries required by federal law but supplemented by analysis of hazardous materials transport and other potential local hazards identified by community members.3.Identify special populations and areas of concernAreas that are particularly vulnerable to incidents and populations that would require special planning to protect or evacuate in an emergency (such as nursing home residents) should be identified and contingency plans developed.4.Identify available resourcesPolice agencies and fire officials should assess their capabilities to respond to different types of incidents. This should include understanding what resources and help can be anticipated from surrounding communities and state and federal agencies. In addition, the assessment should also include response capabilities of local industry and transporters, specifically those that have the potential to be involved in a hazardous materials incident. Protocols then need to be developed to designate specific responsibilities of all those who will be involved in an incident.5.Develop the operations planA plan is prepared, reviewed, adopted, and periodically updated by relevant agencies.6.Test the plan and practice proceduresRelevant agencies and involved organizations (such as hospitals and large private firms in the area) should conduct exercises (simulations of emergency situations) to determine whether responders are prepared to handle their assigned roles and whether the planned procedures are effective. Ranging in complexity from \u201ctabletop\u201d discussions to the actual deployment of significant resources and personnel (as if in response to an incident), exercises are the best way to find out if the community is ready for a specific type of emergency.\n",

Surprisingly, an example from Washington D.C. suggests that at least for some types of hazards and in at least one region, well-defined roles were not clear (Schulman, 2015). The DHHS in collaboration with the National Association of County and City Health Officials (NACCHO) sought to determine how local health departments (LHDs) could best contribute to a large-scale chemical event response. A focus group of 33 local, state, federal, and nonprofit agency representatives in the National Capital Region met to discuss possible roles. The result of the focus group was that the participants had very different perspectives on the role of LHDs in a chemical response. Though LHDs have responsibility for protecting human health in all hazards, the role of LHDs was perceived to be limited to disease prevention and control and not really in responding to a hazardous material incident. As noted by Schulman (2015), \u201cthe perception of chemical incidents as hazardous material (hazmat) events, and not public health events, may result in LHDs being left out of the loop, even after the incident transitions to a mass casualty or mass fatality event.\u201d She also identified the following roles for LHDs.\u2022\u201cPublic health surveillance activities are crucial to determining that an event has happened, as well as the nature of the event. Routine passive surveillance results can be monitored for unusual symptoms associated with chemical exposures.\u2022LHDs' preexisting community relationships position them to be a trusted source of risk communications. While other responders handle the hazardous materials, LHDs have the ability to calm and inform the populace.\u2022LHDs provide subject matter expertise to healthcare partners on matters such as the toxicity of chemical agents and sampling and screening approaches. If the agent is unknown, LHDs could use epidemiologic investigation methods to help identify it.\u2022Other potential roles based on LHD expertise include: (a) coordinating the provision of mental and behavioral health services to affected communities; and (b) providing guidance to ensure the safety and health of on-the-ground responders.\u2022Public health expertise on the impacts of chemical agents also provides extensive opportunities to support and collaborate with healthcare and environmental health partners.\u2022LHDs may play a role assessing and monitoring the environmental impact of the agent and the pathways by which it travels. With their knowledge of environmental health impacts, LHDs define exclusionary zones and evacuation areas to ensure public safety, as well as to issue advisories related to drinking water and food safety.\u2022Once a response reaches the recovery phase, LHDs may be responsible for long-term monitoring of exposed individuals and environmental health impacts, as well as continued risk communication should environmental contamination linger.\u201d\n",

Many large shippers and carriers also have specially-trained emergency response teams that can assist in the response to a hazardous materials incident. The business plans generally fall under the concept of business continuity plans. The importance of such plans was highlighted by the Great East Japan Earthquake of 2011 where global supply chains were disrupted for months due to the disruption of the critical supply of motor vehicle products centered in the affected area in Japan. One of the outcomes from this experience was that most Japanese firms now have business continuity plans outlining the steps that will be taken for responding to immediate threats associated with such a magnitude of disruption. However, the major focus of business continuity plans is on the business itself and steps that need to be taken to recover service, maintain customer relations, and avoid negative impacts on the market value of the firm. Very few plans devote much attention to the broader picture of how interaction with public agencies, especially for planning ahead of such incidents, should occur.",

Populations experiencing greater health risks include children, older adults, low-income communities, and communities of color.\u2022Proactive adaptation policies and programs reduce the risks and impacts from climate-sensitive health outcomes and from disruptions in healthcare services.\u2022Additional benefits to health arise from explicitly accounting for climate change risks in infrastructure planning and urban design.\u2022Reducing greenhouse gas emissions would benefit the health of Americans in the near and long term. By the end of this century, thousands of American lives could be saved, and hundreds of billions of dollars in health-related economic benefits would be gained each year under a pathway of lower greenhouse gas emissions (U.S. Global Change Research Program, 2018a, U.S. Global Change Research Program, 2018b).\n",

As noted, \u201cprimary prevention corresponds to mitigation\u2014efforts to slow, stabilize, or reverse climate change by reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Secondary and tertiary prevention corresponds to adaptation\u2014efforts to anticipate and prepare for the effects of climate change, and thereby to reduce the associated health burden\u201d (Frumkin et al., 2008).

            "text": "The interface among climate change, public health, and transportation occurs in three major areas, which have been largely covered in other sections of the book.1.Weather-related conditions (e.g., high winds, dust storms, sudden floods, blinding rain, or snow) are factors contributing to fatalities and injuries that were discussed in Chapter 7 as being of concern to both transportation and public health officials. In many cases, the weather-related event itself can result in fatalities. For example, the National Weather Service (NWS) reported 116 people killed in floods, 106 from extreme heat, 43 from hurricanes, and 20 from high winds in 2018 (note: this report did not include updated estimated deaths from Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico). Fifty percent of the 418 flood deaths from 2015 to 2017 occurred in vehicles (NWS, 2018).2.Transportation provides accessibility to all sorts of land uses, including medical and health care facilities. Widespread disruptions due to extreme weather can cut access to such facilities seriously affecting the ability of health caregivers to provide medical help. This also impacts the supply chain of medical supplies and personnel trying to access the affected areas. During the recovery period, transportation facilities and service provide the channel for water and food to reach disaster zones, as well as supporting the social determinants of health that are stressed during times of disruption.3.Roads, and in some cases transit services, helicopters, and airplanes, can provide a means of evacuating either areas that are likely to face a disaster (e.g., hurricane) or those that have experienced one (e.g., earthquake). Having a means of evacuation is especially important when there is only one way to leave. A wildfire in California in 2018, for example, surrounded the only road serving isolated campgrounds and other recreational sites that were later burned as well, resulting in fatalities for those not heeding the advice to evacuate before the fire reached those sites. Hurricane Katrina is partially remembered for large groups of the population stranded in New Orleans with no means to evacuate (the city has since identified bus stops designated for pickups of those without vehicles prior to a hurricane hitting the region).Another (nonclimate change) example is the effort of the Oregon DOT to establish routes into the state that would survive a major earthquake given that the major interstate serving the state (I-5) is expected to be destroyed in many locations (ODOT, 2014). Alternate routes are being hardened; redundant command and control centers have been established; and prepositioning of emergency supplies has occurred to provide access to water, food, and medical supplies assuming that the road network is disrupted.4.In some cases, transportation facilities and services can provide refuge for those seeking shelter. In the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, many people sought higher elevations, that is, bridges, to avoid rising flood waters. In many cities during heat waves, those without air conditioning ride air-conditioned buses to avoid the heat (some transit agencies offer free trips for this purpose); during extreme cold, many likewise ride the transit system seeking heat.5.Transportation agencies are often one of the few agencies with monitoring and public information capabilities in forewarning the population about an impending disaster and to communicate after a disaster occurs. These include communications about emergency routing, roadway closures, wide-area alerts, early warnings, evacuation, re-entry into disaster zones, and disaster travel information. Variable message signs that are common on major highways throughout the world can be used to convey messages concerning the locations of shelters and the most efficient paths through a road network.6.In the aftermath of a major disaster, transportation agencies provide the physical barriers to isolate areas that are targeted for recovery to keep out those who do not belong. In addition, one of the key challenges facing many communities after a disaster is removing levels of debris that far exceed the capacity of a community to remove. State DOTs have the capability to transfer resources from one location to another and thus have become an important source of debris removal (if authorized to do so by the legislature). As an example of one state\u2019s efforts in debris removal, the Georgia DOT has formed \u201cstrike teams\u201d for every segment of the state's freeway system that will respond quickly to system disruptions; staff from the state's forestry service are part of these strike teams in order to bring power saws to remove downed trees, often a major obstacle in reopening a road.\n",

The public health community has many policy, program, and prevention options for dealing with climate change impacts (Watts et al., 2015). For example, Frumkin et al. (2008) suggest public health professionals can \u201cexplain the health rationale for climate change mitigation in terms of reduced morbidity and mortality \u2026. can provide evidence on the health impacts of various approaches to climate change mitigation (including co-benefits and disbenefits) \u2026 and should play a major role in developing plans that address health threats related to climate change.\u201d In many of these actions, transportation service and infrastructure can play a critical role in minimizing the public health consequences of a changing climate.",

For both response and recovery phases of a disaster, preparation is necessary, which is indicated on the left side of the figure. In fact, this preparation is continuous....indicating periodic updates and practicing of response and recover procedures. Also of note in the figure is the immediate response to a disaster which evolves into a recovery operation....in fact, as indicated these phases tend to overlap. The long-term recovery includes rebuilding and making changes during the rebuilding that will provide more protection if another similar disaster strikes. The other important observation from Figure 8.4 is the time frame....immediate response measured in days and perhaps weeks; intermediate response/recovery measured in weeks/months; and long-term recovery measured in months/years. The all-hazards approach to disaster preparation considers each phase of such a disaster cycle.",

The following selected lessons learned in this review provide an excellent overview of the characteristics of an all-hazards approach to incident/disaster response that should be considered by those developing such a strategy.\u2022Legislation and regulations, while necessary, are not sufficient to ensure the prevention of accidents or adequate preparedness. It is therefore important for stakeholders to undertake additional initiatives and learn from the experience of others in different fields of work.\u2022A common issue shared by both the nuclear and nonnuclear industries is that of identifying a wide range of accident scenarios, from design-based to beyond-design\u2013based accidents. Consideration of such a broad range of accident scenarios ensures that planning efforts are robust and provide for adequate protection of public health and safety.\u2022Promoting forward-looking risk governance that takes into account complex risks is important. In evaluating risk exposure, countries may want to not only rely on past disruptive shocks and linear risk modeling, but also consider evolving risk patterns, including demographic, economic, technological and environmental drivers, as well as their interdependencies and potential cascading impacts.\u2022Training and emergency drills have also been identified as essential for successful emergency response both on-site and off-site.\u2022It is very important to select appropriate personnel protection measures such as equipment for emergency responders, as well as the means of improving their awareness of the hazards surrounding the event.\u2022Governments must develop crisis-management capacities to cope with the complexity, novelty, ambiguity, and uncertainty characterizing many modern crises. Emergency response plans are necessary tools for conventional crisis management.\u2022Using social media effectively in crisis communication requires that appropriate resources be devoted to the management of social network messaging during the event. It is important to ensure that the information circulating in various social media platforms is accurate because accurate information leads to public trust in officials (see OECD, 2015 for a good discussion of the use of social media).\u2022Engaging the private sector in crisis-management efforts is crucial, particularly when the scale and complexity of a crisis requires a \u201cwhole-of-society\u201d approach.\u2022Leaders must be identified prior to the crisis, and they along with their teams, organizations, and key partners must be sufficiently prepared to cope with the challenges presented by the crisis.\n\u2022On-site emergency plans for accidents involving hazardous materials should take natural hazard risks into account. Off-site emergency response plans for hazardous industries in natural hazard-prone areas should consider the impact of hazardous material releases on populations and on rescue operations. The vulnerability of emergency response resources to natural events and hazardous material releases should be assessed. Medical services should be involved in the preparation of the external emergency plan.\u2022Health effects from disasters are far more than the sum of their physical or psychological health effects, including posttraumatic stress disorder. Medically unexplained symptoms or syndromes may be the most prominent negative health outcome.\n",
