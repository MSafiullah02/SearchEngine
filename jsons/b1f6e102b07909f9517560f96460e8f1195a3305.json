            "text": "PEDV, belonging to the family Coronaviridae, genus Alphacoronavirus, is an enveloped virus possessing a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA genome of approximately 28 kb (Pensaert and Debouck, 1978; Sun et al., 2012) . The genome is composed of 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 untranslated regions (UTRs) and seven open reading frames, which encode four structural proteins (spike [S], envelope [E], membrane [M], and nucleocapsid [N] ) and three nonstructural proteins Kocherhans et al., 2001) . The PEDV S protein is a type I glycoprotein composed of 1383-1386 amino acids (aa), depending on the strain (Oh et al., 2014) . Although PEDV has an uncleaved S protein because of the lack of a furin cleavage site, the S protein can be divided into S1 and S2 domains based on its homology with S proteins of other coronaviruses (Sturman and Holmes, 1984; Jackwood et al., 2001) . Similar to that in other coronaviruses, the PEDV S protein, primarily S1 protein, plays an important role in regulating interactions with cellular receptor glycoproteins to mediate virus entry and contains neutralizing epitopes (Chang et al., 2002; Bosch et al., 2003; Lee et al., 2011; Oh et al., 2014) . The PEDV S1 gene exhibits frequent variation between PEDV strains Sun et al., 2012; Chen et al., 2014; Sun et al., 2014) . Therefore, the S1 region of the genome is considered to be useful for determining the genetic relationships of different PEDV isolates . In 2014, new variants of PEDV (OH851 and CH/HBQX/10) were reported in the USA and China (Zheng et al., 2013; Wang et al., 2014) . These strains, called S INDEL strains, have three deletions and one insertion in comparison with the sequence of the initially reported prototype strain in the North America (NA prototype strain). S INDEL strains are thought to be associated with reduced severity of clinical disease in pigs under field conditions (Vlasova et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2014) .",

            "text": "In the present study, we collected 11 fecal samples and 14 small intestinal tissue samples from four farms in Japan from March to May 2014. The samples were homogenized with the Eagle's minimum essential medium (EMEM) to make the 20% suspension. We attempted to isolate PEDV field strains in Vero cell cultures, as previously reported (Hofmann and Wyler, 1988; Kusanagi et al., 1992; Shibata et al., 2000) , with a few modifications. At 7 days post inoculation (dpi), cytopathic effects (CPEs) were detected from the first to third passage in three samples inoculated with suspensions of small intestine tissue samples. In other samples, CPEs were not detected within five blind passages. The cells exhibiting CPEs were destroyed with three freeze-thaw cycles and centrifuged, and the supernatants were collected. Viral RNA was extracted from the supernatants using a QIAamp MinElute Virus Spin Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Reverse transcription was performed at 42\u00b0C for 30 min, followed by predenaturation at 99\u00b0C for 5 min with reaction mixtures containing 1 \u03bcL of sample RNA, 1 \u03bcL of a 10\u00d7 PCR Gold Buffer, GeneAmp dNTP mix (0.8 mM of each dNTP), 2.5 mM of MgCl2 solution, 10 U RNase inhibitor, 25 U MuLV Reverse Transcriptase (Applied Biosystems, CT, USA), 2.5 \u03bcM of each specific sense and antisense primer, and up to 10 \u03bcL per sample of RNase-free water. The primers were designed based Table 1 ). The PCR conditions were as follows: 95\u00b0C for 15 min; 40 cycles of 94\u00b0C for 30 s, 42\u00b0C for 30 s, and 72\u00b0C for 2 min; and 72\u00b0C for 10 min with reaction mixtures containing 10 \u03bcL of sample cDNA, 4 \u03bcL of a 10\u00d7 PCR Buffer, 1 mM MgCl 2 solution, 1.25 U of Ampli Taq Gold (Applied Biosystems), and up to 50 \u03bcL per sample of RNase-free water. The supernatants collected from three CPE-positive samples were positive for PEDV by RT-PCR. These three isolated PEDV strains were referred to as ZK-O, ZK-CTK, and ZK-CHR (accession numbers LC053343, LC053344, and LC053345, respectively). In order to determine the sequences of the S1 genes of PEDV isolates, the purified RT-PCR products were sequenced by FASMAC Co., Ltd. (Kanagawa, Japan). S1 domain sequences were compared with genome sequences of several PEDV strains in GenBank. Sequence data were (B) Phylogenetic trees of the S1 domain of PEDV isolates. The dendrograms were reconstructed by the neighbor-joining method using the MEGA 6 program. GenBank accession numbers are also shown. aligned by the CLUSTAL W method using MEGA 6 software (Tamura et al., 2013) . The trees were constructed by the neighbor-joining method with 1000 bootstrap replications using MEGA 6 software (Saitou and Nei, 1987) . Genetic distances were calculated using Kimura's two-parameter correction at the nucleotide level (Kimura, 1980) . Similar to OH-851 (an S INDEL strain), ZK-O had three deletions and one insertion in the S1 region as compared with the USA/Colorado/2013 strain (the NA prototype strain). ZK-CTK and ZK-CHR did not have these mutations (Fig. 1A) . Thus, the ZK-O strain was classified as an S INDEL strain, whereas the other strains (ZK-CTK and ZK-CHR) were the NA prototype strains (Fig. 1B) .",

Ten 1-week-old specific-pathogen-free (SPF) pigs were obtained from a PED-negative farm. The experimental protocol was approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of the Zen-noh Institute of Animal Health. The pigs received care in accordance with the guide for Animal Experimentation of Zen-noh Institute of Animal Health. The pigs were divided into two groups (n = 5) and oral inoculation with 2 mL of isolated ZK-O (1.1 LogTCID 50 /mL) and ZK-CHR (1.6 LogTCID 50 /mL) virus stock was performed for pigs in each group. The virus stock contained 8.34 \u00d7 10 7 and 6.38 \u00d7 10 7 genome copies/mL, respectively, determined using real-time RT-PCR. Real-time RT-PCR was performed using an Ag Path-ID One-Step RT-PCR Kit (Life Technologies, MA, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The sense and antisense primers (0.4 \u03bcM) and FAM-BHQ probe (0.2 \u03bcM) were used as previously reported (University of Minnesota, 2015). At 7 dpi, all pigs were sacrificed by exsanguination under anesthesia (0.03 mg/kg xylazine i.m., 0.5 mg/kg midazolam i.m., and 12.96 mg/kg pentobarbital sodium i.v.).",

In contrast, in the group inoculated with ZK-O, two pigs did not develop diarrhea, while two pigs developed only mild diarrhea ( Fig. 2A) . Although all pigs in the group inoculated with ZK-CHR developed anorexia and exhibited lethargic behavior, no pigs inoculated with ZK-O exhibited these symptoms. Mortality rate is a useful measure of the pathogenicity of PEDV strains because suckling pigs exhibit high mortality rates in the field (Sun et al., 2012) . In our study, no pigs from either group died within the experimental period. The pigs used in this experiment may have been too old to observe this effect. However, by assessing clinical symptoms, we confirmed that the S INDEL strain had a lower pathogenicity than the NA prototype strain, consistent with previous predictions.",

The next day, feces from two other pigs inoculated with ZK-O and one other pig inoculated with ZK-CHR were positive for PEDV in real-time RT-PCR. The other two pigs inoculated with ZK-O began to excrete PEDV at 3 dpi. All pigs excreted PEDV in feces by 7 dpi. The average quantity of virus excreted in the feces generally increased throughout the experimental period in the group inoculated with ZK-O, whereas it peaked at 3 dpi for the group inoculated with ZK-CHR (Fig. 2B, Supplemental Table 2 ).

The remaining intestinal samples and samples from other organs were submitted for histopathological examination. In the small intestines of some pigs, mild villous atrophy was observed. The severities of the lesions were similar between the two groups. No other tissues showed abnormalities.
