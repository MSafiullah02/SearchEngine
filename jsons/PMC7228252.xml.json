The fast pathogen detection may be particularly useful for respiratory tract infections with certain pathogens. Adenovirus infection often cause leucocytosis and increase in CRP23 and hMPV infection clinically presents as pneumonia24 and resembles bacterial infection. In RSV, for which skilled handling already exists due to rapid antigen\u2010based tests, no decrease in antibiotic prescription and hospital length of stay was seen. The development of standard operation procedures (SOP) with therapy guidelines for the handling of viral pathogen detection considering clinical parameters could lead to a decrease in antibiotic treatment, duration of stay in hospital and thus costs.9, 18, 19, 21, 25 Furthermore, the patients\u2019 past medical history and prehospital antimicrobial therapy support specific diagnostics. The development of an algorithm and teaching of the physicians how to use the FA as a POCT system in the clinical context is therefore required.
