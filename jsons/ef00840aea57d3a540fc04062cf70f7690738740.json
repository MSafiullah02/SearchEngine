However, the effect of non-pharmaceutical interventions on the epidemic in Shenzhen, China remains unknown. Individual data of 417 cases were extracted from the epidemiological investigations and the National Infectious Disease Information System between January 1, 2020 and February 29, 2020. On the basis of important interventions, the epidemic was divided into four periods (January 1-15, January 16-22, January 23-February 5 and after February 6). We used a susceptible-exposed-infectious-asymptomatic-recovered model to evaluate the effect of interventions. Results suggested that about 53.7% were imported from Wuhan. The median age was 47 years and 52.8% were women. Severity risk increased with age and associated with male and co-existing disorders. The attack rate peaked in the third period and drastically decreased afterwards across sex, age groups and geographic regions. Children younger than 5 years showed a higher attack rate than those aged of 6~19. The effective reproductive number decreased from 1.44 to 0.05 after the highest level emergency response since January 23. Overall, the non-pharmaceutical interventions have effectively mitigated the COVID-19 outbreak in Shenzhen, China. These findings may facilitate the introduction of public health policies in other countries and regions.",

Most of the cases occurred between January 18 and February 5, accounting for 85.9% of the total number.

The proportion of severe (severe/critical) cases decreased gradually across time, accounting for 66.7%, 11.2%, 5.0% and 0% in the four periods, respectively, while the proportion of mild/moderate cases increased over time. Logistic regression analysis was conducted to figure out risk factors for the severity of COVID-19. As shown in Table 2 , results suggested that males were associated with a higher risk of severity (OR=2.11, 95% CI 1.04 to 4.28). Since there was only one severe case in the patients aged between 1~39 years, so we just compared the disease risk between the patients aged 40~59 and aged 60~86 years, and the results suggested that those older than 60 were more likely to be severe/critical (OR=2.99, 95% CI 1.41 to 6.31). Among the overall cases, 96 (23.0%) had at least one coexisting illness such as cardiovascular diseases, chronic pulmonary diseases or diabetes etc., and 50 (12.0%) .

Different from the previous findings in Wuhan (Li et al., 2020a) , we found the proportion of young patients (20~39 years old) was slightly higher than the elderly (60~86 years), probably because that the average age of people in Shenzhen is relatively younger compared with other cities. The attack rate kept increasing before February 6 and declined afterwards for all age groups. Thirty-three children under 20 years old were infected, and we observed that most of them (94%, 31/33) were affected in the clustering, as warned by WHO report that the infection risk would increase by clustering when the family members were required to stay at home (Report of the WHO-China Joint Mission on Coronavirus Disease 2019). The situation was worse in Wuhan, where the daily confirmed cases per million people kept increasing over time for children less than 20 years, and the infants less than one year old showed the highest attack rate among the children . However, due to the limited sample size, we only compared the attack rates between children of 0~5 and 6~19 years. The children aged 0~5 years showed a higher attack rate compared with those of 6~19 years old, probably because younger children have lower immunity . The attack rate of the elderly was the highest among all age groups, and they were associated with increased risk of severity of COVID-19. Taken together, specific attention should be paid to the vulnerable population including younger children and the elderly people, in order to restrain the transmission of the virus.",

Therefore, figuring out the proportion and the transmission rate of asymptomatic cases is critical for the prevention and control of COVID-19 worldwide. The proportion of asymptomatic cases was estimated to be 34.6% onboard the Princess Cruise ship (Mizumoto et al., 2020) . What is more shocking is that researchers used the reported data in China in conjunction with mobility data and inferred that appropriately 86% of all infections in China were undocumented before the travel restrictions since January 23 (Li et al., 2020b) . As scientists were setting out on estimating the proportion of people with mild or no symptoms (Qiu, 2020) , we estimated the ratio of asymptomatic cases to be about 17% in Shenzhen, by calculating the proportion of all asymptomatic cases among the clustering cases using the field epidemiological investigation data. The ratio is much lower than the previous studies, probably because the cases with mild symptoms were not included for calculating; second, since the medical resources were relatively sufficient in Shenzhen, the medical care-seeking behaviors were more active in the infected people. Moreover, the early public health response and early isolation of asymptomatic patients by Shenzhen government also restrained the spread of the virus. Nevertheless, the proportion of asymptomatic infections needs to be confirmed in the future serologic studies as soon as possible.",

A German-based research showed that some COVID-19 patients had very high levels of virus in throat swabs while their symptoms were mild (Woelfel, 2020) . Another study of China also detected high viral loads in the cases without symptoms, who shed a similar amount of virus to those with symptoms . Shen et al. evaluated 24 asymptomatic patients in Nanjing, China and they found that the communicable period could be as long as three weeks, and the people infected by those asymptomatic could develop severe illness . These findings suggested that some infected people can be highly communicable when they have mild or no symptom. A recent study constructed a networked dynamic meta-population model and Bayesian inference using the data of reported infection in China and the mobility data. They found that the transmission rate of undocumented infections was 55% of the reported infections (Li et al., 2020b) . In the context of that, according to the previous studies, here, in order to simulate the cases in condition of no intervention was implemented on January 23, the transmission rate of asymptomatic patients was set to be 50% of the symptomatic patients conservatively, as we previously reported in a modeling study to simulate the phase-based transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 .",

Hospitalization is critical for disease control, and we observed that the delays between illness onset and first medical visit, hospitalization or diagnosis confirmation all decreased across time, indicating the effectiveness of control measures by Shenzhen government. Increased knowledge of the virus and extensive news coverage among the general population might have already facilitated the seeking behaviors of medical care. In addition, the supply of medical sources, including the viral identification assays, as well as the more active surveillance of close contacts and surveillance at the traffic barriers, further increased the capacity of suspected population identification and disease confirmation. In the context of that, as we observed in the investigation data, the proportion of cases identified by surveillance also showed an increasing trend across time.",
