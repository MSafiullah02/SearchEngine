The Coronavirus Study Group of the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses proposed a new name for this novel betacoronavirus: the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Several Middle Eastern countries have been affected by the emerging MERS-CoV epidemic, including Jordan, Qatar, Oman, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates. Tunisia has reported three confirmed cases of human infection. France, Italy, Germany, the United Kingdom, Greece, the Netherlands, and the USA have also reported cases directly or indirectly connected to the Middle East. Eight hundred and thirty-seven cases of MERS-CoV infection have been confirmed to date, including 291 deaths [3]. The rapid accumulation of information about the sequences [2] of MERS-CoV, its genome structure, and its proteins open exciting possibilities for the development of candidate vaccines.",

Both MERS-CoV spike protein-binding antibodies and virus-neutralizing antibodies have been reported in dromedary camels from different regions, including Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Oman, and Egypt. Moreover, MERS-CoV in dromedary camels from a farm in Qatar were linked to two virologically confirmed human cases of the infection in October 2013 [4] and about one in five human cases have been reported to be caused by exposure to animals [8], [9]. The full MERS-CoV genome isolated from a Qatari dromedary camel is highly similar to the human England/Qatar 1 virus isolated in 2012 and has efficiently been replicated in human cells using human DPP4 as entry receptor, providing further evidence for the zoonotic potential of dromedary MERS-CoV [10]. Although, we cannot conclude whether the people were infected by camels or vice versa or if yet another source was responsible, increasing evidence indicates that camels represent an important link in human infections with MERS-CoV. Intensive vaccine control and risk-reduction targeting dromedary camels might be effective in eliminating the virus from the human population.",

Cellular entry of the virus has been demonstrated to be mediated by the S protein through the receptor binding domain (RBD) in the N-terminal subunit (S1) and the fusion peptide in the C-terminal subunit (S2) [11], [12]. For betacoronaviruses, the S protein has been shown to be the main antigenic component responsible for inducing high titers of neutralizing antibodies and/or protective immunity against infection in patients who had recovered from SARS [13], [14] and response levels correlated well with disease outcomes [15], [16]. The S protein has therefore been selected as an important target for vaccine development [17], [18], [19], [20], [21]. Recent work shows that modified vaccinia virus Ankara expressing the S protein of MERS-CoV elicits high titers of S-specific neutralizing antibodies in mice [22].",

Although a trial of a candidate DNA/rAd5 HIV-1 preventive vaccine showed lack of efficacy [37] and the high prevalence of pre-existing anti-Ad5 immunity may have been a major limitation [38] in humans, replication-defective adenovirus vaccines are among the most attractive vectors for veterinary vaccine development, given the relative speed and low cost of development and production. Most adenoviruses infect their host through the airway epithelium and replicate in the mucosal tissues of the respiratory tracts [39]. Because of their ability of to elicit mucosal immune responses, adenoviruses could be an attractive vector for inducing MERS-CoV-specific immunity in dromedary camels, the putative animal reservoir. Interestingly, sera antibodies against adenovirus type 3 were detected in 1.3% of dromedaries in Nigeria [34] and in 43 of 120 camels in Egypt [35]. The occurrence of adenovirus type 3 respiratory infections in camels was studied in Sudan and a 90% seroprevalence was detected [36].",

Even a single immunization with adenoviral-based MERS vaccines induced detectable levels of MERS-CoV-neutralizing antibodies in all animals tested. After week 3 of booster immunization, animals developed robust levels of neutralizing antibodies, while control animals inoculated with Ad\u03a85 did not (Fig. 4\n). In some mice immunized with Ad5.MERS-S1, the highest neutralizing titers were observed as compared to mice immunized with Ad5.MERS-S, although no significant differences between the groups were noted. This result might suggest that Ad5.MERS-S1 expressing secreted S proteins induced a stronger Th2-polarized response, which led to a better antibody-mediated neutralizing activity when compared with Ad5.MERS-S (Fig. 3A).",

            "text": "Previous studies have shown that RBDs of SARS-CoV presenting in the S1 subunit strongly react with antisera from SARS patients in the convalescent phase, and depletion of RBD-specific antibodies from SARS patients results in significant elimination of the neutralizing activity [43]. The RBD is the main domain that induces neutralizing antibody and T-cell immune responses against SARS-CoV infection [44]. A truncated RBD of MERS-CoV S protein was recently reported to potently inhibit viral infection and induce strong neutralizing antibody responses [45], [46]. SARS-CoV S and S2, but neither S1 nor other structural proteins, can induce apoptosis in Vero E6 cells [47], [48] and no histopathological changes were observed in various tissues of rats immunized with a recombinant adenovirus containing a truncated S1 fragment of the SARS-CoV [49]. In contrast, vaccination with recombinant modified MVA expressing SARS-CoV S protein is associated with enhanced hepatitis after challenge with SARS-CoV [50], [51] and SARS-CoV has been shown to infect hepatocytes and cause hepatitis in some human cases [51], [52], [53], raising concerns about the safety of a vaccine that contains the full-length SARS-CoV S protein. A causal relationship between the induction of hepatitis and the full-length nature of the S protein could not be conclusively demonstrated; it can be presumed that the S1 gene has less risk for spontaneous recombination with wild type virus following the generation of new virus types. Thus, we believe that an S1-expressing MERS-CoV vaccine would be a preferable vaccine candidate format. However, an alternative S antigen format such as the entire S-ectodomain or the S RBD domain could be evaluated for comparison. Since the capacity of our immunization strategy to protect from infection will require challenge tests in clinically relevant MERS-CoV disease animal models such as dromedary camels, establishment of such a model will also be important to exclude the potential for vaccine-induced immunopathology, as seen in the feline infectious peritonitis virus model [54], [55]. To this end, a mouse model for MERS-CoV infection that was generated by prior transduction of the animals with an adenoviral vector expressing the human host-cell receptor dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (hDPP4) was recently reported [56]. This mouse model will also be considered in the future for the evaluation of the protective efficacy of the adenovirus-based vaccines. While further investigations are necessary to evaluate the mucosal immunity and the ultimate protective efficacy of Ad5.MERS-S and Ad5.MERS-S1 in dromedary camels or the proper animal models, our results demonstrate that recombinant adenoviruses encoding MERS-S antigens may be protective vaccine candidates with a safe profile. Moreover, we have also investigated in the present study the infectivity of adenovirus type 5 of dromedary camel cells and the presence of anti-adenovirus type 5 neutralizing antibodies in a limited set of dromedary camel sera. Altogether, the presented studies support further exploration of Ad5.MERS vaccines to target the animal reservoir, reducing the risk of human exposure to MERS-CoV.",
