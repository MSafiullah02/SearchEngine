The number of different species of viruses seems to far exceed the species of eukaryotes, bacteria, and archaea [5], [6].

The evidence suggesting that viruses preceded the appearance of other classes of living organisms is based in part on the observation that some archaeans, bacteria, and eukaryotes have homologous genes that code for capsid proteins, such as would be derived from a class of viruses. The simplest explanation for homology for a viral-type gene, in all extant cellular forms of life, is that an ancient gene came from viral species that lived at a time that preceded the emergence of newer forms of life [10]. Over the aeons, retroviruses have had a chance to insert lots of DNA fragments into eukaryotic species. At least 8% of the human genome is composed of fragments of RNA viruses [11], [12], [13] [Glossary Capsid].",

Oncogenes are highly conserved genes, indicating a beneficial role for the species (otherwise, they would not be conserved). Nonetheless, oncogenes clearly have a deleterious effect on some individuals within the species (i.e., by causing cancer). One particularly striking example occurs in a polycythemia strain of mice carrying the Friend murine leukemia virus. All the mice of this particular strain have polycythemia, a condition characterized by a sustained increase in the number of circulating red blood cells. It seems that the resident virus codes for a nonfunctional Env (viral envelope) gene. The protein coded by the degenerate Env gene serves as a mimic for the normal erythropoietin gene of the mouse, causing an increase in red cell production (i.e., polycythemia) [24], [25].",

Following reassortment, a new species of virus may appear, and this new species will contain segments of two parental species. This poses a serious problem for traditional taxonomists, who labor under the assumption that each new species has one and only one parental species [32]. It is the uniparental ancestry of biological classifications that accounts for their simplicity, and for the concept of lineage, wherein the ancestry of any species can be computed from an uninterrupted line of classes stretching from the species level to the root level. When a species has more than one parent, then its lineage is replaced by an inverted tree.

We have observed as a general rule of biology, that no matter how easy it may be for a class of organisms to speciate, there always seems to be a limited number of general classes into which all the species can be assigned. It is as though the evolutionary process itself confines classes to a smaller and smaller repertoire of available designs.",

For example, in the first two-thirds of the 20th century, the classification of bacteria was considered a hopeless task, insofar as bacteria of different classes were known to exchange DNA among themselves, in a general process known as horizontal gene transfer. If bacteria were constantly exchanging genetic material, then it seemed that every bacteria was an amalgam of other bacteria and could not be sensibly classified. Be that as it may, bacteria were found to have a convincing phylogenetic order, based on the ancestral lineage of highly conserved species of rRNA that distinguished the bacteria from archaeal bacteria and further distinguished the classes and subclasses of bacteria [37], [38].",

For example, despite the sequence variations that occur in rapidly mutating viruses, scientists are finding that the three-dimensional folds of protein molecules are conserved, and that viruses can be grouped into the so-called fold families, which can in turn be grouped into fold super families, that preserve phylogenetic relationships among viral lineages [39].",

Furthermore, within a class of cellular organisms, there are only rare instances of classes of virus that can infect distantly related subclasses. For example, there are virtually no viruses that can infect both Class Animalia and Class Plantae (rare exceptions are claimed [40]). Furthermore, as the host evolves, so must the virus.

Because viruses evolve very rapidly, it is possible to trace the evolution of some viruses, with precision, over intervals as short as centuries or even decades [39], [42], [43], [44]. It should be noted that before the advent of ribosomal sequence analysis, and as recently as the early 1970s, bacterial phylogeny was considered a hopeless field [37].

Consequently, vaccine experts are searching for vaccines that confer immunity, partial or full, for several different pathogens or for several variants of a single pathogen [50]. An interesting development in this field is that the smallpox vaccine may confer limited protection against HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) infection. Both viruses enhance their infectivity by exploiting a receptor, CCR5, on the surface of white blood cells. This shared mode of infection may contribute to the cross-protection against HIV that seems to come from smallpox vaccine. It has been suggested that the emergence of HIV in the 1980s may have resulted, in part, from the cessation of smallpox vaccinations in the late 1970s [51].",

In less than 10 years, the Australian rabbit population was reduced by 95% [54]. Nearly 3 billion rabbits died, a number very close to the number of humans living on the planet in the mid-1950s. This plague on rabbits was unleashed by a committee of humans who decided that it was proper to use a lethal rabbit virus as a biological weapon. Without commenting on the moral implications of animal eradication efforts, it is worth noting that rabbits are not the only mammals that can be exterminated by a pathogenic virus. Humans should take heed.",

The target cells for the parvovirus B19 are the dividing precursor erythroid cells. Another name for parvovirus B19 is erythrovirus B19, indicating the target cell for the virus. In the active stage of infection, huge amounts of virus are produced. Death or dysfunction of the target hematopoietic (blood precursor) cells can lead to a transient pancytopenia (i.e., anemia of all blood cell lineages). In rare cases, aplastic anemia may occur, in which most of the precursor erythroid cells are destroyed, leading to a massive decline in circulating mature forms. When aplastic anemia occurs, it usually occurs in individuals who have a concurrent condition that requires an excessive production of blood cells to maintain the normal blood profile of mature cells. These conditions include: autoimmune hemolytic anemia, sickle cell anemia, and inherited blood dyscrasias that increase the fragility of red blood cells or that decrease the life span of red blood cells. Basically, a coinfection with parvovirus B19 is the last straw for bone marrows that are barely keeping pace with the body's demand for erythrocytes.",

Hepatitis B (acute hepatitis, chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma)\nGlossaryAdaptive immunity Immunity in which the response adapts to the specific chemical properties of foreign antigens. Adaptive immunity is a system wherein somatic T cells and B cells are produced, each with a unique and characteristic immunoglobulin (in the case of B cells) or T-cell receptor (in the case of T cells). Through a complex presentation and selection system, a foreign antigen elicits the replication of a B cell that produces an antibody whose unique immunoglobulin attachment site matches the antigen. Antigen-antibody complexes may deactivate and clear circulating antibodies, or may lead to the destruction of the organism that carries the antigen (e.g., virus or bacteria).The process of producing unique proteins requires that recombination and hypermutation take place within a specific gene region. Recombinations yield on the order of about a billion unique somatic genes, starting with one germinal genome. This process requires the participation of recombination-activating genes (RAGs). The acquisition of an immunologically active recombination-activating gene from a retrovirus is presumed to be the key evolutionary event that led to the development of the adaptive immune system. This event, which occurred in one of the early species of gnathostomes (jawed vertebrates), established the adaptive immune system in all jawed vertebrates and their descendants. As one might expect, inherited mutations in RAG genes cause immune-deficiency syndromes [65], [66].Bat A bat is not a flying mouse and is not a member of Class Rodentia, flying or otherwise. Bats are mammals of Class Chiroptera. With forelimbs that have evolved into wings, they are the only mammals capable of sustained, self-propelled flight. Their relevance in this book stems from their status as viral vectors. Currently, bat populations of many species are being decimated by Geomyces destructans, a fungus in Class Ascomycota, the cause of white-nose syndrome. Apparently, the fungal infection, which grows in cold conditions, awakens bats from their deep hibernation; starvation results.Blood contamination When a blood donor is infected with a pathogenic organism, the disease can be passed to the recipient. Examples of organisms and diseases that can be spread through blood transfused blood or blood components include:\n\nHuman Immunodeficiency Virus\n\nHuman T-Lymphotropic Viruses type I and type II\n\nHepatitis A\n\nHepatitis B\n\nHepatitis C\n\nHepatitis E\n\nCytomegalovirus\n\nEpstein-Barr Virus\n\nHuman Parvovirus B19\n\nHuman Herpesvirus 6\n\nHuman Herpesvirus 8\n\nTT virus or Transfusion Transmitted Virus or Torque teno virus\n[67]\n\nSEN Virus\n[56]\n\nCJD and vCJD\n\nSyphilis\n\nMalaria\n[68]\n\nChagas Disease\n\nAfrican trypanosomiasis\n\nToxoplasmosis\n\nLeishmaniasis\n\nBabesiosis\n\nRocky Mountain Spotted Fever\n\nEhrlichiosis\n\nCapsid The protein shell of a virus that encloses the genetic material of the virus when the virus is outside its host cell. The capsid aids the virus with its attachment to the target host cell, and with the penetration of the viral genome into the host cell.Evolvability Evolution by natural selection is not a physiological process, like respiration or replication. The theory of evolution is little more than a restatement of a probabilistic truism, in biological terms. Namely, organisms that are most likely to survive will be the organisms most likely to reproduce. Biologists speak in terms of evolvability to indicate certain factors that may tip the evolutionary scales in an organism's favor.For the most part, these features all involve mechanisms by which new or modified genetic material that may serve as the source of new genes, is obtained. These would include:\n\u2013Having mechanisms for horizontal gene transfer\u2013Having mechanisms for increasing the rate of mutation under environmentally stressful circumstances (e.g., radiation, heat, cold)\u2013Tendency toward endoduplication of genes\u2013Having large, diverse gene pool\u2013Presence of pseudogenes and junk DNA\nHepatitis viruses Several of the viruses that cause hepatitis are provided with names that are easy to remember but impossible to reconcile as a coherent biological class. These are Hepatitis A, B, C, D, E, F, and G. Pathogenic viruses that attack any particular organ need not all belong to the same biological class, and the named hepatitis viruses are no exception, belonging to Groups IV, V, and VII. In addition, not all pathogenic viruses that infect the liver belong to the named hepatitis viruses. Yellow fever virus, which has killed millions of people throughout history, is a Group IV hepatitis virus.Here is a list of the named hepatitis viruses:\n\u2013Hepatitis A virus is a member of Class Picornaviridae (Group IV).\u2013Hepatitis B virus is a member of Class Hepadnaviridae (Group VII).\u2013Hepatitis C virus is a member of Class Flaviviridae (Group IV), the same class that contains yellow fever virus, which also produces hepatitis.\u2013Hepatitis D is a member of an unassigned class in Group V.\u2013Hepatitis E virus is a member of class Hepeviridae (Group IV).\u2013Hepatitis F virus is a hypothetical organism, supposedly responsible for some cases of hepatitis that cannot be diagnosed under any of the nonimaginary taxa.\u2013Hepatitis G virus is now thought to be the same virus as GB virus C, a virus not known to produce any human disease.\nPhenetics An approach to classification wherein objects are grouped together based on a shared set of physical features. In this book, we make the argument that phenetics is an improper approach for biological classifications insofar as two distantly related species may share a physical similarity (e.g., ability to fly or aquatic life) without having any close ancestral relationship, without having a close genetic relationship, and without sharing many metabolic pathways. As the biologist George Gaylord Simpson put it, \u201cIndividuals do not belong in the same taxon because they are similar, but they are similar because they belong to the same taxon\u201d [69].Transposon Also called transposable element, and informally known as jumping gene. The name \u201ctransposable element\u201d would seem to imply that a fragment of the genome (i.e., the transposable element) physically moves from one point in the genome to another. This is not the case. What actually happens (in the case of Class II transposons) is that a copy of the DNA sequence of the transposon is inserted elsewhere in the genome, resulting in the sequence now occupying two different locations in the genome. In the case of Class II transposons, the DNA sequence of the transposon is translated into RNA, then reverse-transcribed as DNA, and reinserted at another location; likewise resulting in two of the same sequence in two locations in the genome [70]. You can see how transposable elements might bloat the genome with repeated elements. Some transposons are the ancient remnants of retroviruses and other horizontally transferred genes that insinuated their way into the eukaryotic genome. Because transposon DNA is not necessary for cell survival, the sequences of transposons are not conserved, and mutations occurring over time yield degenerate sequences that no longer function as retroviruses. A role for transposons in the altered expression of genes in cancer cells has been suggested [71].Virion The infective form of a virus outside the host cell. Viruses can be thought of as having two alternating forms: the virion and the virocell.Virocell The name given to a host cell that has been commandeered by a virus to devote its cellular machinery to the mass production of virus particles. When we think of viruses a living organisms, it is best to envisage the virocell, which consists of a viral factory built from the wreckage of the host cells; and not the virion, which is simply a vehicle for transporting a virus safely from host to host.\n",
