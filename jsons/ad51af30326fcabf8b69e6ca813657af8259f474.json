Availability indicators primarily examine health service or intervention delivery or offering to target populations and must be tailored to the unique context of each delivery modality. For example, availability of condoms in vending machines, at pharmacies, at community-based organizations, or from outreach workers must be measured differently. Coverage indicators measure the extent to which a target population is actually provided with a particular health service or intervention. These kinds of indicators can prove challenging, since an accurate measure requires a carefully estimated total target population for its denominator. Furthermore, frequency of contact-either successfully reaching a target individual or a target individual successfully accessing a service-is an important factor in assessing coverage for some types of health services. Quality indicators cover a broad range of measures including the scope and completeness of interventions or programs, their effectiveness and efficiency, and their safety profile. Although often challenging to measure, best practice for quality indicators is measurement of performance in these categories against standards set by independent, international organizations.

Achievement of the third of the \"Three Ones\" principles was expected, at the time, to be a significant challenge-countries' HIV M&E systems needed to meet the needs of the global community engaged in fighting HIV/AIDS, national and subnational stakeholders from multiple sectors, public health workers coordinating efforts \"on the ground,\" and funding agencies, both domestic and international, looking to examine the returns on their investments. Furthermore, these M&E systems needed to be built, tested, and launched quickly, yet be robust enough to achieve their purpose, and at the same time be flexible, scalable, and adjustable so that they could meet the needs of the future as well.

One of the primary objectives of the workshop was to get country representatives together with multiple international funding agencies to discuss coordination of the HIV response across the Asia region and to grow M&E capacity through the sharing of experiences, challenges, and plans. Although these workshops had already been held several times in Africa, leaders stressed that M&E systems needed to be tailored to the local context in order to successfully achieve their purpose and that there was no one-size-fits-all set of targets and indicators. Although already halfway through two major initiatives, the China's Mediumand Long-Term Plan for AIDS Prevention and Control (1998-2010; Ministry of Health et al. 1998) Furthermore, several international aid projects were underway already, and more were already on the horizon. Hence, while it was recognized that there was a need for detailed and high-quality information on the HIV response, China's HIV response itself was still in its infancy. As noted in a 2003 assessment of prevention, treatment, and care for HIV/AIDS in China jointly prepared by the Ministry of Health and the United Nations Theme Group on HIV/AIDS in China, there was yet \"no overall plan for the gathering, storage and usage of HIV/AIDS information\" (Ministry of Health and the United Nations Theme Group on HIV/AIDS in China 2003). Thus, a strategy for the development of an HIV M&E system that would standardize data collection, storage, audit, analysis, and exchange and that would simultaneously be tailored to the unique needs of China as well as meet the needs of the international community had become a high priority (see Chap. 20 for more information).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1113, "end": 1127, "text": "Prevention and", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1128, "end": 1147, "text": "Control (1998-2010;", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1148, "end": 1179, "text": "Ministry of Health et al. 1998)", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "China Begins to Develop an M&E System for Its HIV Response"}, {"text": "At the Bangkok workshop, China CDC representatives sought to operationalize an M&E system based on five core principles: (1) the system needed to be practical, realistic, and simple; (2) each province was responsible for quality assurance with higher-level, centralized verification; (3) focus needed to be placed on prioritization of indicators; (4) epidemic areas needed to be identified; and, finally, (5) multiple sectors needed to be involved.

Furthermore, the importance of tying indicators to performance was not mentioned among official China CDC documents, perhaps because China's efforts toward curbing the HIV epidemic were too new to detect change. However, there were subtle hints that China's HIV programs would be judged by their impact and that stakeholders would be held accountable for generating success. For example, in a directive on HIV/AIDS in 2003, Premier Wen Jiabao stated (Shen and Yu 2005) : Furthermore, State Council documents that described national HIV response policy at that time explicitly stated that those leading HIV response efforts would be held accountable for their actions through annual evaluations of their job performance and that those who engaged in irresponsible conduct would be punished (Shen and Yu 2005 ) (see Chap. 18 for more information).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 917, "end": 935, "text": "(Shen and Yu 2005)", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 1256, "end": 1273, "text": "(Shen and Yu 2005", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Draft \"Core\" Indicators"}, {"text": "In 2004, several international agencies launched efforts aimed at increasing the capacity of the Chinese Government's HIV response. Principal among these was the Global Fund, and the China CDC was the largest recipient of grant moneys worldwide in the 2000s. Over a 10-year engagement, from 2004 to 2014, the Global Fund appropriated over 320 million USD to HIV response activities in China. Although the Global Fund was ready to begin deploying funds as early as 2002, China was not ready, both politically and ideologically, to meet the Global Fund's requirements for transparency, inclusiveness, destigmatization, and community (i.e., civil society) participation (Huang and Ping 2014) . Before 2003, China was largely in denial of its HIV epidemic, and societal stigma and discrimination against PLWH and their families was common and severe (Huang 2005) . Participation of civil society in the fight against HIV/AIDS was minimal at this time, and Chinese Government power was substantial and focused on suppressing behaviors deemed undesirable. Not surprisingly, harm reduction was still very controversial in China during this timegiving condoms to sex workers or offering clean needles to drug users was viewed as supporting illegal activity. Thus, China CDC's first application to the Global Fund in 2002, for grants to support HIV prevention programs for drug users, was rejected partly because it lacked a harm reduction component (Huang and Ping 2014) . However, beginning in late 2003, sweeping political changes occurred at the highest levels of China's government, and national HIV response policy took a major turn for the better with the announcement in December of that year of the \"Four Frees and One Care\" policy. Additionally, China tackled the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) virus quickly and effectively in 2003, which gave the international community new confidence in China's public health response capabilities. And finally, China's eagerness to compete for, and win, Global Fund grants to help with the costs associated with implementing and scaling up a range of initiatives also contributed to major changes in the way it was willing to conduct its HIV response efforts (Minghui et al. 2015) . China adapted to global norms and included harm reduction objectives when applying for the fourth round of Global Fund grants in 2004. Hence, the Global Fund's involvement in HIV/AIDS programs in China began in September 2004, with a first phase that boosted the China CARES program, which was just getting off the ground at that time (see Chap. 25 for more information).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 667, "end": 688, "text": "(Huang and Ping 2014)", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 846, "end": 858, "text": "(Huang 2005)", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 1441, "end": 1462, "text": "(Huang and Ping 2014)", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 2220, "end": 2241, "text": "(Minghui et al. 2015)", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "International Donors Influence Performance-Based M&E in China"}, {"text": "This first award of 11 million USD from the Global Fund to finance the China CARES program helped to shape many of China's HIV/AIDS program indicators.
