            "text": "From its inception in the 1950s, AI was primarily concerned with processes by which computers might achieve 'intelligence' comparable to that of humans, and how we might recognize such intelligence (13). Turing's (1950) seminal paper, \"Computing Machinery and Intelligence,\" was concerned more with the latter, but the work sparked a rich diversity of research activities (13, 14) . The field of AI now encompasses a wide variety of methodology, much of which falls into two broad categories: rule-centred and data-centred. Rule-centred methods came from the study of logical reasoning, and are intended to capture intelligence by explicitly writing down the rules that govern it and then deploying that intelligence to carry out different tasks (13). Datacentric methods like machine learning have focused more on learning to perform specific tasks using previously collected data rather than explicitly provided rules (13). Definitions of select AI subfields with examples are provided in Table 1S (Appendix C) and example health applications are presented below.",

            "text": "The first rule-centred AI application for health care, MYCIN, was not in PC. MYCIN is an expert system developed in the 1970s to diagnose blood infections using over 450 rules derived from experts, textbooks, and case reports (13,15). Although met with initial excitement, over time, limitations were identified in rule-centric methods in terms of handling the complexity of real-world decisions. At the same time, increasing amounts of health data promoted a shift towards data-centric methods in machine learning, which were thought to be better able to capture complex relationships between health-relevant features from data than could be represented using rules. Machine learning methods are now used to reveal patterns in data to answer health research questions, such as to facilitate prediction of diabetes or cancer diagnoses (16) (17) (18) (19) . Machine learning methods figure prominently in natural language processing, a subfield of AI, which can be applied to unstructured text data to extract structured information or summarize documents (20) . The use of AI to input or process EMR data into formats for future use or to output meaningful summary information could potentially remove some of the EMRassociated burden from clinicians (21) (22) (23) . Other sources of health data are also processed by AI methods; for example, skin cancer diagnosis using computer vision and machine learning has advanced due to 1) skin lesion imaging data being readily available with easy digitization and image recognition technology, and 2) the suitability of using supervised machine learning for predicting the probability that a lesion is pathological (24, 25) . These types of techniques are purported to diagnose at least as accurately as clinicians; however, the data are mainly from settings past the point of referral from PC, where the distribution and spectrum of lesions is wider, and clinicians are restricted to visual inspection-further evidence is required to assess usefulness of these tools for PC settings (24, 25) . Several commentaries and reports describe these and other applications of AI to health, though not predominantly for PC (1, 2, 5, 6, 17, 23, 26, 27) .",

Final search strategies developed for health sciences, computer science, and interdisciplinary databases included keywords and, where possible, subject headings pertaining to the concepts of 1) AI and 2) PC. Due to subject-area terminology differences, certain terms were used exclusively in health sciences or in computer science databases (e.g. \"knowledge base\"). Search strategies were refined in an iterative fashion to balance comprehensiveness with feasibility; all relevant documents from the initial search were re-identified using a final search strategy in MEDLINE.

Authors were predominantly from TEM disciplines with 214 (52.8%) studies having at least one author with an appointment in a TEM discipline compared to 57 (14.1%) studies having at least one author with an appointment in a PC discipline.

These patterns did not change when unspecified or general medical appointments (i.e. any nonspecialist medical appointment) were counted as PC appointments.

An AI-driven technology needs to be working reliably with good performance, which is accomplished through methods development research, before 'real world' testing, let alone widespread implementation. This is further reflected by the majority of studies having researchers as an intended end user alongside care providers, whereby further refinement seemed to be required before the AI application would be ready for use in a practice setting. For example, methods that are intended to work with many health conditions but have only been tested with a single candidate condition, or methodologically well-performing AI that needs to be incorporated into software and pilot-tested in practice settings to evaluate its impact with endusers. On the other hand, studies which focused on using AI to analyse health data may be considered distinct and are at a later stage of maturity in terms of readiness for use. These AI applications will not be used in everyday clinical practice, so while methodological performance is important, longer-term health or workflow outcomes may not need to be assessed before 'real world' use.",

Expert systems comprise a significant portion of the literature but are now less common (median year of publication 2007 versus 2014 for supervised machine learning), reflecting a general shift in AI research from expert systems and rule-centric AI methods to machine learning and data-centric AI methods (57) . These methods are amendable to providing diagnostic and treatment recommendations as well as making predictions about future health, which supports PC activities such as primary prevention and screening. This also aligns with the focus on physicians as target eventual end users.",
