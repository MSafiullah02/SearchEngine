We recently experienced a case of pneumonia in which HRV was isolated from bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid and confirmed by a multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test (FTD Resp 21 Kit; Fast Track Diagnostics, Silema, Malta), which detects the following respiratory pathogens: influenza A and B viruses; coronaviruses NL63, 229E, OC43, and HKU1; human parainfluenza viruses 1, 2, 3, and 4; human metapneumovirus A/B; rhinovirus; respiratory syncytial virus A/B; adenovirus; enterovirus; human parechovirus; bocavirus; and Mycoplasma pneumoniae. We report this case and review the clinical and radiological features.",

He was a businessman with no significant past medical history. He had never smoked or drunk, and had never been exposed to significant amounts of dust. The patient's daughters had developed rhinorrhea, cough, and fever one week before his initial symptoms. One day before presenting to our hospital, he developed a fever of 40\u00b0C. On presentation, he had a respiratory rate of 32/min, body temperature of 39.5\u00b0C, and his O 2 saturation measured by pulse oximetry was 94% under 10 L/min of O 2 by reservoir O 2 mask. Physical examination revealed coarse crackles in his right lung fields. Chest X-ray showed bilateral ground-glass opacities (GGOs) and consolidations (Fig. 1a) . Chest computed tomography (CT) showed bilateral GGOs and centrilobular nodules ( Fig. 1b and c) without hilar and mediastinal lymphadenopathy. Laboratory tests showed a white blood cell (WBC) count of 10,500/mm 3 (neutrophils, 9400/mm 3 ; lymphocytes, 600/mm 3 ; eosinophils, 0/mm 3 ; and monocytes, 500/mm 3 ); hemoglobin, 14.3 g/dL; platelet count, 22.2 \u00d7 10 4 / mm 3 ; blood urea nitrogen, 6 mg/dL; creatinine, 0.6 mg/dL; C-reactive protein, 26.1 mg/dL, procalcitonin, 2.21 ng/mL, \u03b2-D glucan, < 6 pg/ mL, and Krebs von den Lungen, 131 U/mL. An anti-HIV antibody was negative. Rapid nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal diagnostic tests for influenza virus, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and urinary antigen tests for Streptococcus pneumoniae and Legionella spp. were both negative. We diagnosed him as having community-acquired pneumonia, started antibiotics of piperacillin-tazobactam and azithromycin, and supported his respiratory condition with O 2 delivered at an FiO 2 of 0.90 via highflow nasal canula. However, his body temperature did not improve, and chest CT performed on hospital day 3 showed an increase of bilateral diffuse centrilobular nodules, GGOs, and consolidation. We performed bronchoscopy and BAL in the lateral segment of the right middle lobe bronchus. BAL (78 of 150 mL recovered) showed 24.1 \u00d7 10 5 cells/mL (neutrophils, 72.1%; lymphocytes, 6.8%; macrophages, 21.1%; eosinophils, 0%) but did not yield significant pathogens including M. pneumoniae. We analyzed the BAL fluid with multiplex PCR, which showed positive results only for HRV. We started corticosteroid therapy with methylprednisolone 60 mg daily for 1 week, and antibiotics were switched to levofloxacin 500 mg daily. His fever abated on hospital day 6, O 2 by nasal canula was stopped on hospital day 8, and he was discharged on hospital day 12. Specific antibody titers against M. pneumoniae, C. pneumoniae, C. psittaci, Legionella spp., influenza virus, adenovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, and parainfluenza virus (serotypes 1-4) in paired sera did not increase.",

One report investigated HRV in BAL fluid [6] . Among 20 patients with HRV detected in BAL fluid, 12 had a primary viral infection, and 8 were coinfected with bacteria. In the patients with primary HRV pneumonia, the median WBC count was 11,200/mm 3 , and a procalcitonin level > 1 ng/mL was not rare, which are results compatible with those of our patient. Chest CT showed consolidation in 12, diffuse infiltration in 5, and pleural effusion in 5 patients, but none had diffuse bronchiolitis [6] . However, HRV is known to be a common pathogen of childhood bronchiolitis. The above report included severe cases of HRV pneumonia, and 13 required invasive mandatory ventilation; the mortality rate was 12.5% [6] .",

Further studies are needed to clarify the significance of corticosteroids as a treatment option for primary HRV pneumonia. This report has two limitations. First, our patient received antibiotics before undergoing BAL, which could have affected bacterial culture results. Second, the possibility of detecting viruses from the upper respiratory tract cannot be denied when using the BAL technique. To avoid this concern, a well-designed, prospective study is needed in which samples are obtained only from the lower respiratory tract, e.g., via intubation or use of a protected specimen brush.",
