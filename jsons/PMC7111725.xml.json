This species had been introduced into many areas of China and had become an important economic species of freshwater aquaculture [2]. With the rapid development of crayfish pond culture and rice shrimp comprehensive breeding industry, the white spot disease of crayfish has become increasingly prominent. White spot disease is one of the most disastrous in shrimp culture, having reduced shrimp production extensively worldwide. Mortality rates are usually very high and cumulative mortality can reach 100% within 3\u201310 days from the onset of visible gross signs [3,4]. The clinical symptoms of white spot syndrome include loss of appetite, lethargy, and the appearance of white spots on the exoskeleton [5]. White spot disease had been reported from several Asian countries since the early 1990s, and then from South America and from the south-eastern coast of the USA [[6], [7], [8], [9]].",

All the major species of cultivated penaeid shrimp can be naturally infected by this virus [[6], [7], [8], [9]]. In addition to penaeid species, both natural and experimental infections have also been reported in caridean shrimp (Macrobrachium rosenbergii), crayfish (Orconectes punctimanus), wild crabs (Calappa lophos, Portunus sanguinolentus, P. pelagicus, Charybdis sp., Helice tridens and Scylla serrata), wild lobsters (Panulirus sp.), palaemonidian pest shrimp, krill (Acetes sp.), planktonic copepods and pupae of an ephydridian insect [[12], [13], [14]]. WSSV replicates in the host cells after infecting the host. Virus could not be eliminated by conventional drugs without damaging the host cells, there is no specific treatment for the viral disease. During the breeding process, disease prevention and control measures are mostly based on prevention. Once the white spot disease breaks out, the crayfish's mortality rate is extremely high, which leads to the farmers' blood loss [5]. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop a therapeutic drug that is less harmful to crayfish cells and could effectively reduce the mortality rate after infected WSSV.",

            "text": "By consulting a large amount of literature, we found that hesperetin has multiple effects, such as anti-inflammatory, anti-cancer, anti-virus and so on. Hesperetin is a type of natural flavonoid that occurs mainly in the form of glycoside hesperidin, which is the main flavonoid in lemons and oranges. It is known that hesperetin has an anti-oxidation effect. It was selected as a biological antioxidant to protect osteoblasts and was used as an auxiliary preparation for melanin in the treatment of type I diabetic bone disease [15]. Additional, hesperetin has an anti-inflammatory effect and can reduce the production of sebum, thereby effectively inhibiting the growth of acne. Hesperetin can also be used to protect the cardiovascular, protect the nerves, and reduce triglyceride content in the liver [[16], [17], [18], [19]]. Hesperetin has an anti-cancer effect, and citrus flavonoid hesperetin and naringin have obvious inhibitory effects on the proliferation of human breast cancer cells in vitro [20]. Most importantly, hesperetin has antiviral properties, and has significant antiviral activity against the Chikungunya virus (CHIKV), reducing CHIKV replication efficiency and down-regulating the production of viral proteins involved in replication [21]. Hesperetin can reduce intracellular replication of herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1), polio-virus type 1, parainfluenza virus type 3 (Pf-3), and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) [22]. Hesperetin showed its inhibitory activity on Sindbis virus infection in vitro and were not cytotoxic on Baby Hamster cells 21 clone 15 (BHK-21) [23]. The intake of hesperetin in laying hens diet may exhibit positive effects and increased the ratio of yolk weight/egg weight and the blood serum superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity [24]. Based on this, we would explore whether hesperetin could effectively inhibit viral replication and reduce mortality in crayfish.",

For crustaceans, the innate immunity is an important way to protect them from viral infection. In the present study, the results directly indicated that hesperetin can regulate the innate immune system of crayfish. Although hesperetin had been shown to influence the process of multiple viral infection, such as inhibited cleavage activity of the 3 C-like protease, which is the SARS-coronavirus 3C-like protease that mediates the proteolytic processing of replicase polypeptides 1a and 1b into functional proteins [32], inhibited enterovirus 17 infection [33], inhibited influenza A virus replication and so on [34]. This article firstly explored the possibility of hesperetin to resist WSSV infection, which is the main pathogen for most crustaceans. Based on the results of mortality, the mortality rate of hesperetin treatment groups was significantly lower than that of un-treated group, and the best dosage of hesperetin was 50 mg/kg. This result indicated that hesperetin could effectively reduce the mortality of crayfish after WSSV infection. The results of WSSV copy number showed that hesperetin could effectively inhibit viral replication, maybe by affecting the innate immunity of crayfish. Moreover, after feeding 50 mg/kg hesperetin additive for 24 h, we detected the expression levels of four important immune genes in crayfish, and found that the expression levels of Toll-like receptor and crustin 1 were significantly down-regulated, but the expression levels of NF-kappaB and C-type-lectin were significantly up-regulated. Proteins containing a C-type lectin domain have multiple functions including cell-cell adhesion, immune response to pathogens, and apoptosis [35,36]. C-type lectin plays a central role in host defense, and many members of this family are involved in viral infection, primarily by identifying virions and affecting their entry into host cells. C-type lectin, LvCTL1, in Litopenaeus vannamei has been shown to protect shrimps from WSSV in vitro and in vivo, and protection may be related to the interaction of LvCTL1 with several viral proteins [37]. The knockdown of crustin-like through RNAi inhibits WSSV replication in shrimp, and the mortality, WSSV copy number and expressions of WSSV immediate early genes (IE1, IE2, DNA polymerase, VP28) were both decreased [38]. To discover the effect of hesperetin on the innate immunity of crayfish, the immunological activity of crayfish fed hesperetin before and after WSSV challenge was tested.",

            "text": "THC is the total number of hemocytes in crayfish. Hemocyte is a very important immune tissue in the innate immunity of crustaceans. It is involved in cellular immunity and humoral immunity, and can directly recognize and engulf foreign pathogens. The results showed that hesperetin treatment significantly increased the total hemolymph counts of crayfish after the WSSV challenge. After treatment with hesperetin, PO activity was significantly up-regulated at 48 h, and pathogen challenge experiments showed that PO activity in crayfish treated with hesperetin for 48 h was also increased, indicating that hesperetin treatment promoted the expression of the proPO non-self-identification system. PO is the terminal enzyme of the proPO pathway, which converts tyrosine to dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA) and then to dopaquinone and melanin synthesis [39]. PO activity is very important for crustacean innate immune defense against invading pathogens [40]. In the WSSV challenge experiment, the SOD activity of the 50 mg/kg hesperetin group was higher than the WSSV group, indicated that hesperetin treatment significantly increased the SOD activity, which is very important for the stability and health of crayfish. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) released during the innate immune response can destroy bacteria or viruses; however, large amounts of ROS can also attack host proteins, lipids, and DNA nonspecifically, leading to cell damage [41]. To avoid ROS self-injury, SOD is activated as part of the antioxidant defense to remove superoxide anions and maintain homeostasis during the immune response [42]. The above results indicated that hesperetin seemed to reduce crayfish mortality mainly by enhancing innate immunity, but did not directly act on WSSV, although it was reported to inhibit viral replication.",

            "text": "It is well known that innate immunity plays an essential role in immune responses against viral infection in which apoptosis and phagocytosis are two important components [43]. During viral infection, a series of signaling pathways can be triggered in the host, leading to apoptosis of infected cells [44,45]. Apoptosis is a process of cell death caused by pre-existing death procedures triggered by internal and external factors, and it is also called programmed cell death [46]. NF-kappaB is closely related to apoptosis, which is involved in the transcriptional regulation of a variety of apoptosis-related genes and has a two-way effect of inhibiting and promoting apoptosis [47]. Whether or not infected with WSSV, hesperetin increase a little on the total hemocyte counts, and significantly increase the hemocyte apoptosis rates in crayfish. Due to the complexity of crayfish immune system, hesperetin may promote hemocyte apoptosis but have no cytotoxic to crayfish hemocytes. The apoptosis rate of the WSSV +50 mg/kg hesperetin group was significantly higher than that of the WSSV group, which may be related to the up-regulation of the NF-kappaB gene, and the WSSV copy number during this period is directly and effectively suppressed. These results showed that hesperetin treatment significantly increased apoptosis. This finding revealed that hesperetin may be an enhancer of apoptosis, although it could restrain mortality. In the study of hesperetin against CHIKV virus, hesperetin can effectively inhibit the replication of CHIKV in host cells through elicit the inhibitory effect against the activity of Rluc marker expressed by CHIKV [21]. In this study, according to the virus copy number, hesperetin can effectively inhibit the replication of WSSV in crayfish cells. Iin this study, hesperetin treatment has an impact on some immune parameters, and inhibiting WSSV replication maybe by regulating apoptosis.",
