In northern Europe, low temperature and low UV Indexes were correlated with peaks of influenza virus activity during 2010-2018 5 . Therefore, it is hypothesized that COVID-19 transmission may decrease or even disappear when the temperature and UV radiation increase in the summer. In this study, we aim to determine the association of meteorological factors with transmission of COVID-19 in various Chinese cities.",

We used the cumulative number of confirmed cases from 224 cities (207 outside Hubei, 17 inside Hubei) with no less than 10 cases as of Mar 9, and calculated basic reproduction number (R 0 ) for 62 cities (50 outside Hubei, 12 inside Hubei) with more than 50 cases as of February 10 (COVID-19 peak time in China). R 0 means the expected number of secondary cases generated by an initial infectious individual, in a completely susceptible population. If R 0 < 1, then the disease free equilibrium is locally asymptotically stable; whereas if R 0 > 1, then it is unstable. Thus, R 0 is a threshold parameter.",
