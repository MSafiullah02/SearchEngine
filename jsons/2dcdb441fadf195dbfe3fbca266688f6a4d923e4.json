The massive displacement in and from Syria has garnished the most attention but large scale movements in the context of conflicts in South Sudan, Central African Republic, Ukraine and elsewhere merit consideration as well. Earlier in the decade, the famine and long-term conflict in Somalia sent hundreds of thousands across the border into Kenya and Ethiopia while the crisis in Libya and political instability throughout North Africa caused more than one million to flee across international borders, some seeking asylum while others (mostly contract workers) tried to get to their own home countries as violence erupted in their destination countries. Typhoon Haiyan in the Philippines displaced millions in 2013, leaving many in a situation of protracted upheaval.",

Yet, they have many characteristics in common with refugee movements. For example, they often take place in the context of political instability, countries of origin may not have the capacity or political will to protect their citizens from harm, an international response may be needed because of the scale of the migration, and the need for humanitarian assistance will likely overwhelm local capacities. S.F. Martin (*) School of Foreign Service, Georgetown University, Washington, 37th and O Streets, N.W, Washington, DC 20057 , USA e-mail: Susan. Martin.ISIM@georgetown.edu This chapter focuses on international, regional and national legal norms, policies, organizational roles and relations and good practices that are applicable to the broader range of humanitarian crises that have migration consequences. The chapter examines movements stemming directly and indirectly from: persecution, armed conflict, extreme natural hazards that cause extensive destruction of lives and infrastructure; slower onset environmental degradation, such as drought and desertification, which undermine livelihoods; manmade environmental disasters, such as nuclear accidents, which destroy habitat and livelihoods; communal violence, civil strife and political instability; and global pandemics that cause high levels of mortality and morbidity. These crises lead to many different forms of displacement, including internal and cross border movements of nationals, evacuation of migrant workers, sea-borne departures that often involve unseaworthy vessels, and trafficking of persons. While the majority of those displaced from humanitarian crises move internally, a significant portion migrates cross borders to other countries.",

            "text": "\u2022 Persecution, torture and other serious human rights violations. The precipitator of forced migration that, as we will see, fits best into current legal and policy norms involves persecution of individuals or groups on the basis of such factors as race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group (often used to address gender), and political opinion. Persecution can affect individuals or it can affect groups of people as defined by what are often referred to as immutable characteristics shared by large numbers of people. It often occurs in contexts in which there are no safeguards to protect racial, ethnic, religious, and other minorities who may be targeted by other groups. Persecution can involve serious physical or psychological harm (e.g., rape or torture), deprivation of one's liberty (e.g., imprisonment), forced removal or ethnic cleansing, severe economic deprivation, and other mechanisms that result in serious harm to the individual. \u2022 Armed conflict. One of the principal drivers of forced migration is armed conflict. Although most displacement today occurs in the context of internal armed conflict, significant levels of forced migration accompany international armed conflict as well. Displacement may be a form of collateral damage as civilian populations get out of harm's way but in many conflicts forcing the relocation of civilians is an overt aim of one or another of the warring parties. \u2022 Political instability and violence. The recent events in North Africa and the Middle East fit into this category, with millions fleeing violence perpetrated by the Islamic State (ISIS) and other terrorist and insurgent groups. Violence following contested elections in Kenya (2007) , Zimbabwe (2008) and Cote d'Ivoire (2011) is another example of political instability that has generated violence that has resulted in large-scale displacement. Communal violence that does not rise to the situation of armed conflict, but nevertheless displaced large numbers, has occurred in and from the Karamoja region of Uganda, Bangladesh, Ethiopia and elsewhere. The violence can be between clans, ethnic groups, economic",

Violence can also be the product of drug cartels and gangs that fight each other or government authorities. \u2022 Natural hazards. Recent examples of crises resulting from extreme natural hazards that have had migration impacts include hurricanes/cyclones (e.g., Hurricanes Mitch and Stan in Central America and Cyclone Nargis in Burma/ Myanmar), tsunamis (e.g., Indonesia, Sri Lanka and Somalia in 2004 and Japan in 2011), flooding (e.g., Pakistan in 2010), earthquakes (e.g., Haiti in 2010); and prolonged droughts (Somalia in 2011). Generally, the hazard itself does not cause the crisis; a lack of national and local governance, lack of emergency preparedness, lack of adequate building codes, high levels of poverty and similar weaknesses in local and national capacity lead to crisis conditions. Experiences with mass displacement after Hurricane Katrina show that even very wealthy countries are not immune to such disasters, but stable, more economically advanced countries generally have greater capacity to assist their citizens. The differences in deaths and displacement from earthquakes in Haiti and Chile in 2010 are indicative. Although the seismic level of the Chilean earthquake was much greater than that in Haiti, the level of destruction was much greater in Haiti, which is one of the poorest countries in the world and suffered from decades of political instability. The 2012 earthquake in Mexico is another case in point. An albeit more intense earthquake in 1985 led to tens of thousands of deaths, but the recent experience demonstrated that new building codes, emergency preparations and timely response could reduce casualties to a handful. \u2022 Man-made environmental crises. Man-made crises include nuclear/chemical/ biological accidents and attacks, accidental or deliberate setting of fires, and similar situations that make large areas uninhabitable and cause displacement. The accident at the Chernobyl nuclear plant in 1986, for example, resulted in the evacuation of more than 100,000 people within days. The earthquake and tsunami in Japan led to further crisis when nuclear power plants lost their capacity to cool reactors, forcing the evacuation of thousands. This classification system, though useful in understanding the causes of crises with migration impacts, is not composed of pure types because there are often overlaps among the factors that create disasters. For example, an acute natural hazard and political instability may intersect to drive people from their homes. In fact, as stated above, an absence of good governance is almost always one of the factors that is present when forced displacement occurs. Demographic trends, while not usually directly linked to displacement, also intersect with each of these causes to increase or decrease a population's vulnerability or resilience. The demographic composition of the affected population also helps determine whether specific households or individuals will need to migrate. These may differ, however, depending on the causation. For example, adolescent and young men may be at particular risk of forced recruitment in conflict situations, necessitating flight if they do not wish to participate in the fighting. On the other hand, the elderly and young children may be at higher risk of starvation in the case of protracted drought, as discussed below.",

            "text": "A second dimension of the typology is the intensity of the driving factors. The division is broadly between acute crises and slow-onset emergencies. The former often lead to emergency displacements that are readily defined as \"forced migration\" because conditions in home countries or communities are seen as the primary reasons that people leave. By contrast, the displacement generated by slow-onset situations is often seen as voluntary and often anticipatory migration and may have elements of labor migration. Slower-onset crises arise in a number of different contexts. Prolonged drought is a principal cause of displacement for millions who are reliant on subsistence agriculture and pastoralist activities. Recurrent droughts undermine livelihoods when crops fail and livestock are sold or die because of inadequate rain and depletion of other water sources. When markets do not function in a manner that allows a redistribution of food to drought-affected populations, migration becomes one of the principal ways to cope with losses caused by the environmental change. Since many of the affected populations resemble others who migrate to obtain better economic opportunities, it may be difficult to distinguish those whose loss of livelihood is environmentally-related. In worse case examples, when (for example) drought combines with conflict or other political factors to preclude food distribution in communities of origin, famine may be in the offing. When affected populations have exhausted all of their other coping capacities, they may be forced to migrate or suffer starvation. Often, children, the elderly and those with pre-existing illnesses are among the first to succumb to famine in the absence of alternatives. They are also the least likely to be able to migrate without assistance. The third dimension is geography-where and how the displacement takes place.",

A smaller proportion of the movements are to countries outside of the immediate region of the crisis. Currently, those who cross international borders are designated as 'refugees 1 ' or 'international migrants' whereas those who remain within their national borders are 'internally displaced persons' or 'internal migrants. ' How migrants leave their own countries, pass through transit countries, and enter destination countries also affect designations. Some migrants may have received permission to enter another country while others travel without documentation or otherwise on an \"irregular\" basis. Sea-borne migrants, particularly those in small, unseaworthy boats, face dangers not only from variability in the weather but also from pirates and others who prey on them. Migrants using smugglers may be routed through multiple countries before reaching their final destination. Those crossing difficult land terrains may find themselves endangered as they attempt irregular entry across deserts and mountains. While these irregular means of transit may be common when there is political instability or natural disasters, pandemics present another geographic challenge. Airports and seaports often become the focal point for action, especially when governments establish policies to quarantine those who may be carrying the disease.",

The migration consequences of crises take different forms and must be addressed through different mechanisms depending on the phase of displacement or movement and its duration. Some of the causes discussed above produce protracted crises whereas others lead to more temporary dislocations. For example, some cases of political instability are quickly resolved and new governments put in place but others drag on for years with no resolution in sight. Similarly, reconstruction after some extreme natural hazards moves ahead quickly and people are able to return to their homes with little loss of livelihoods, but in other cases, return is delayed or impossible because governments have too little capacity to implement reconstruction programs, there is such great likelihood of recurrence of the same type of natural hazard, and/or the home community has been damaged beyond repair. In extreme cases, an entire country may become uninhabitable (for example, Montserrat after the volcano and potentially, small island States as a result of climate change). In these cases, return may be impossible. These phases may play out differently for different populations affected by the same triggering event depending on their personal or household circumstances. They are also not necessarily linear; for example, those who return may find themselves engulfed in new crises and experience new displacements.",

The decision as to whether return is possible involves a range of variables, including the extent, for example, to which the causes-either direct or through other channels-are likely to persist. Policies in the receiving communities and countries, depending on whether the migration is internal or international, will also affect the likelihood for return or settlement in the new location.

Under certain conditions-for example, when the smuggled migrants is placed in bondage to pay off his or her smuggling fees-smuggling may turn into trafficking.

Whether there should be a stronger international legal framework to address non-refugee forced migration is a point that would certainly generate debate. There are a number of reasons that such a framework would be difficult to achieve. Trying to identify legal standards for a broad range of potential drivers of forced migration which may have little in common with one another would present challenges, particularly in setting out appropriate criteria for determining who among forced migrants would merit specific forms of protection.

Typically, in non-crisis situations, destination countries admit persons to fill job openings or to reunify with family members. Employment-based admissions are usually based upon the labour market needs of the receiving country, not the situation of the home country. Family admissions are usually restricted to persons with immediate relatives (spouses, children, parents and, sometimes, siblings) in the destination country. At the same time, most overtly humanitarian admissions are generally limited to refugees and asylum seekers. Many, if not most forced migrants, however, will be unlikely to meet the legal definition of a refugee since their lives are endangered for reasons that do not involve persecution on the basis of a protected characteristic such as race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group or political opinion. Despite these limitations, there are both legislative and ad hoc policies that do permit governments to respond when there are crises that provoke migration. They fall into three categories: (1) policies that permit migrants already on the territory of the destination country to remain for at least a temporary period; (2) policies to respond to new movements of people leaving either directly or indirectly as a result of the crisis; and (3) evacuation of citizens and selected others from crisis affected countries.",

They are not considered to be residing under color of law, however, for purposes of receiving social benefits and they are not able to bring family members into the country to join them. Importantly, TPS only applies to persons already in the United States at the time of the designation. It is not meant to be a mechanism to respond to an unfolding crisis in which people seek admission from outside of the country. It also only pertains to situations that are temporary in nature. If an environmental disaster has permanent consequences, for example, a designation of Temporary Protected Status is not available, even for those presently in the United States, or it may be lifted. When the volcano erupted in Montserrat in 1997, TPS was granted to its citizens and was extended six times. In 2005, however, it was ended. US Citizenship and Immigration Services in the Department of Homeland Security explained \"that the termination of the TPS designation of Montserrat is warranted because the volcanic activity caus-ing the environmental disaster in Montserrat is not likely to cease in the foreseeable future. Therefore, it no longer constitutes a temporary disruption of living conditions that temporarily prevents Montserrat from adequately handling the return of its nationals. Similarly, the conditions are no longer \"extraordinary and temporary\" as required by section 244(b)(1)(C) of the Act.\" 6 Another significant factor is that the designation is discretionary, to be made by the Secretary of Homeland Security in consultation with the Secretary of State. Countries or parts of countries are designated, allowing nationals only of those countries (or affected regions within them) to apply. A further issue is the difficulty of ending the status. Although some early proponents of TPS argued that it was temporary in the sense that it would allow time to determine whether those granted the status could return or should be granted legal permanent residence, the legislation makes it difficult for them to remain permanently with full rights of immigrants. If individuals granted TPS otherwise meet the criteria for legal admissions as an immigrant, they are eligible to obtain permanent residence without leaving the United States. If it were determined, however, that as a group they cannot return home, special legislation would be needed to allow them to remain permanently. The legislation specifies that such legislation would require a super-majority (threefifths) of Senators for passage.",

To the extent that institutional arrangements within countries affected by crises fail to provide adequate protection and assistance, cross-border movements may increase. Institutional arrangements to mitigate crises in situ are thus highly relevant to understanding how forced displacement might be mitigated. At present, the international response to humanitarian crises is based on the cluster approach. The UN High Commissioner for Refugees is the cluster lead for protection (focusing on conflict-induced displacement) as well as for the emergency shelter and camp management clusters. The International Organization for Migration has responsibility for camp management in the context of natural disasters. The situation is less clear cut with regard to protection of those displaced by natural disasters. UNHCR, the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) and UNICEF have all been designated as having protection responsibilities in natural disasters (Global Protection Cluster 2017). In practical terms, IOM often takes on this responsibility because of its role in camp management. Cluster leads have relatively little authority over other international organizations during these crises. The Interagency Standing Committee (IASC) Guidance Note on Using the Cluster Approach explains; \"the role of sector leads at the country level is to facilitate a process aimed at ensuring well-coordinated and effective humanitarian responses in the sector or area of activity concerned. Sector leads themselves are not expected to carry out all the necessary activities within the sector or area of activity concerned. They are required, however, to commit to being the 'provider of last resort' where this is necessary and where access, security and availability of resources make this possible\" (IASC 2006) . The Note recognizes that \"The 'provider of last resort' concept is critical to the cluster approach, and without it the element of predictability is lost\" (IASC 2006) . For agencies with technical leads (e.g., health, nutrition, water and sanitation), the ability of the lead agency to take on responsibility is straightforward. However, the Note is more circumspect regarding the leadership for cross-cutting areas such as Protection, Early Recovery and Camp Coordination: \"The concept of 'provider of last resort' will need to be applied in a differentiated manner. In all cases, however, sector leads are responsible for ensuring that wherever there are significant gaps in the humanitarian response they continue advocacy efforts and explain the constraints to stakeholders\" (IASC 2006) .",

The numbers demonstrate a clear increase in UNHCR's involvement with IDPs.

Nevertheless, there are continuing concerns about the nature of the response. For example, a Brookings Institution report concluded: \"While humanitarian reform has improved operational short-term response, it has had little effect on either protecting people from new displacement or in finding solutions for those displaced. Questions of access and staff security continue to be the major limitations in protecting and assisting IDPs\" (Brookings Institution 2014).

Its role has been limited, however, in addressing the situation of those who migrate internationally because of non-persecution or non-conflict reasons.

As stated in its 10 point plan, UNHCR recognizes that situations \"in which people with different objectives move alongside each other, using the same routes and means of transport or engaging the services of the same smugglers, can raise serious protection concerns.\" The concept of mixed migration seems to be rooted in the assumption that the mix is between refugees and economic migrants and deals very little with other forced migrants. The 10 point plan does not address situations in which people are migrating for a mix of reasons that include extreme natural hazards, except for one mention of migrants from Aceh in Malaysia, or political or communal violence, except for one mention of Mexican migrants leaving because of domestic or other violence.

For the population, this means decreasing livelihood prospects and increased migration.

Then Assistant High Commissioner for Protection, Erika Feller, summarized the dilemma before the Executive Committee: \"New terminology is entering the displacement lexicon with some speed. The talk is now of \"ecological refugees\", \"climate change refugees\", the \"natural disaster displaced\".

At the same time, recent events demonstrate that the process of political change taking hold in many parts of the world can be destabilizing, causing new movements of people. Increased mobility also means greater potential for pandemics to spread quickly throughout the world, as was seen in the SARS and H1N1 cases, and for governments to make decisions regarding non-return, as seen in the Ebola crisis in West Africa.

Although many countries have advanced and tested systems to respond to refugees and asylum seekers, responses to migration emanating from other crises-natural disasters, political instability and violence, pandemics, human made disasters-are ad hoc and, in many cases, untested. Most countries have mechanisms to provide temporary suspension of removal if conflicts or natural disasters preclude immediate return. With little underpinning from international and, sometimes, national law, the application of these provisions tends to be uneven and often dependent on factors that have little to do with immigration or humanitarian considerations or the balancing of these two factors. Crises that generate greater visibility, such as the 2010 earthquake in Haiti or Ebola pandemic in West Africa, may result in suspensions of removal whereas less known but potentially equally dangerous situations may not yield this response. When taken into account, immigration issues can work in different directions in determining whether to suspend removals or provide temporary protection. In some cases, concern that temporary protection may spur new movements of people is determinative in not granting suspension or triggering temporary protection, whereas in others, flow of remittances to countries in crisis may push a government towards the decision to grant the status and provide work authorization.",

Some of those leaving may be bonafide refugees deserving of asylum, others may have serious reasons to fear for their safety though they do not meet the refugee criteria, but still others may be leaving to seek better economic opportunities.

For that matter, what term should be used in categorizing this form of migration; this paper has used forced migration and displacement as short hands. In other contexts, the terms crisis migrants and survival migrants have been used to describe those who do not fit current legal categories.

This can play out in two ways-demography as a macro-level factor and demographic composition as a micro-level driver of movement.

Recent experiences with the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), avian flu, and the H1N1 virus indicate that pandemics can pose serious migration consequences. First identified as a disease in 2003, the SARS virus causes a form of pneumonia that results in acute breathing difficulties and may result in death. Highly contagious, SARS infected more than 8000 people in two dozen countries in Asia, Europe, and the Americas within weeks of its discovery (CDC Basic Information about SARS, May 3, 2005). Although avian influenza A viruses usually do not infect humans, since November 2003, according to the Centers for Disease Control, \"nearly 400 cases of human infection with highly pathogenic avian influenza A (H5N1) viruses have been reported by more than a dozen countries in Asia, Africa, the Pacific, Europe and the Near East.\" Although transmission is from poultry to humans, epidemiologists are concerned that the virus may change and allow for human to human infection. Experience with the H1N1 virus demonstrates how quickly a pandemic could spread. In April 2009, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of influenza from the H1N1 virus to be a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. By the end of the month, 11 countries had reported confirmed incidents. One week later, the number had grown to 22 countries and by the end of May, 53 countries officially reported 15,510 cases, including 99 deaths. By the end of the year, more than 200 countries had reported cases and the death rate exceeded 12,000.",
