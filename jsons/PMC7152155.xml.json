They are the smallest of all self-replicating organisms, historically characterised by their ability to pass through filters that retain even the smallest bacteria. In their most basic form, viruses consist solely of a small segment of nucleic acid encased in a simple protein shell. They have no metabolism of their own but rather are obliged to invade cells and parasitize subcellular machinery, subverting it to their own purposes. Many have argued that viruses are not even living, although to a seasoned virologist they exhibit a life as robust as any other creature. (Condit, R. C.

            "text": "This definition naturally covers the NoV and is a good starting point for consideration of viruses in matters of food safety. NoV are human enteric caliciviruses. The family Caliciviridae belongs to the picornavirus-like superfamily; small, RNA viruses without an envelope. The calicivirus particles (virions) measure between 27 and 38 nm and consist of a spherical protein shell and a genome of a single strand of approximately 7.6 kb positive sense RNA. The caliciviruses known to infect humans belong to two genera: the genus Norovirus and the genus Sapovirus (SaV, formerly known as Sapporo Like Viruses, or typical caliciviruses). In addition, the family holds two genera of animal viruses, named Vesivirus and Lagovirus (Green et al., 2001). A recently detected bovine calicivirus may be assigned to a fifth genus (Smiley et al., 2003). The genus NoV is further subdivided into an increasing number of poorly defined genogroups (Karst et al., 2003). Each genogroup can be subdivided in several genotypes, defined by > 80% amino acid homology across the capsid gene, and over 15 genotypes are characterised at the moment (Koopmans et al., 2003). The NoV are officially denoted by the following cryptogram: host species/genus abbreviation/species abbreviation (i.e. genogroup)/strain designation/year of detection/country of origin. For NoVs the strain designation is the location where the strain was first detected, for example: Hu/NV/GGI/Norwalk Virus/1968/US, Hu/NV/GGI/Southampton virus/1991/UK, Hu/NV/GGII/Hawaii virus/1971/US and Hu/NV/GGII/Bristol/1993/UK (Green et al., 2001).",

The NoV genome is organised into a 5\u2032untranslated region (UTR), the open reading frames (ORF) 1, 2, and 3, a 3\u2032UTR and a poly A tail. ORF1 encodes the non-structural proteins necessary for virus replication. The major structural protein (VP1) is coded on ORF2, whereas ORF 3 encodes a minor structural protein (VP2) (Glass et al., 2000; Bertolotti-Ciarlet et al., 2003). Altogether the virion consists of a capsid of 180 copies of VP1 and a small number of VP2, and the single stranded RNA genome which is possibly covalently linked to the capsid by a VPg protein (Green et al., 2001).",

Unlike bacteria, viruses are obligate intracellular parasites. Many viruses, including the human enteric caliciviruses, have a narrow species- and tissue tropism, i.e., efficient replication of the human NoVs occurs only in the gastrointestinal tract of humans. Replication in other human tissues has not been detected, and even though NoV genotypes were found in cattle (e.g. bovine Jenavirus, GGI) and pigs (e.g. porcine enteric calicivirus, GGII), none of these animal genotypes have ever been detected in human patients.",

Pre-existing antibodies do not always correlate with protection from infection, and insight into the correlation between NoV genotypes and serotypes is only just beginning to develop. Serum IgG, IgA and IgM responses are observed after infection with NoV and common epitopes within genogroups and between genogroups have been identified (Erdman et al., 1989a and b; Gray et al., 1994; Treanor et al., 1993; Hale et al., 2000; Yoda et al., 2000; Harrington et al., 2002; Kitamoto et al., 2002). However, there are contradictory data on the level of cross-reactivity after NoV infections in humans. It has been shown that the specificity of the immune response varies greatly within genogroups but nevertheless, other studies have observed cross reactivity between viruses belonging to different GGs (Farkas et al., 2003; Madore et al., 1990; Treanor et al., 1993).",

For example, bloodgroup B, and non-secretor status confer protection to infection by Norwalk virus, bloodgroup A confers protection to infection by Snow Mountain virus, while none of the bloodgroups offers protection to infection with GGII.4 viruses (reviewed by Hutson et al., 2004). These studies also suggest that the susceptibility to NoV infection is related to specific carbohydration of the host receptor, and that NoV binding can be inhibited by the specific carbohydrates in solution. These findings may lead to the development of (strain specific) antiviral treatments. Research into the genetic susceptibility is booming at the moment and insight may develop and change over time.",

Viruses were the most frequently identified causes of community acquired gastroenteritis, with NoV detected in 11% of cases in The Netherlands and 7% in the UK.

Approximately 5% of cases in The Netherlands sought treatment, compared with 4% of cases in Wales and 17% in England. The physician-based patient group was younger, and had more severe symptoms and longer duration of illness (de Wit et al., 2001b). Some 5% of physician-based cases were NoV positive in The Netherlands, and 6.5% in the UK. The lower proportion of NoV disease in this study population compared with the community cases confirms that on average NoV illness is relatively mild. The financial consequences of this mild disease can, however, be serious; cost estimates related to NoV infections for the Netherlands showed that 13% (i.e. 46 million) of costs for gastroenteritis were due to NoV infections alone (van den Brandhof et al., 2004).",

Since the development of molecular detection methods NoV have emerged as the most important cause of outbreaks of gastroenteritis in institutional settings (i.e. hospitals, nursing homes). The majority of NoV gastroenteritis cases results from direct person-to-person transmission. However, NoV-related outbreaks have been shown to be food- or waterborne caused by, for example, contaminated shellfish (Doyle et al., 2004; Kingsley et al., 2002a; Le Guyader et al., 2003), raspberries (Ponka et al., 1999) or drinking water (Carrique-Mas et al., 2003; Kukkula et al., 1999; Parshionikar et al., 2003). Additionally, environmental spread of NoV was found, for instance by contaminated carpets in hotels (Cheesbrough et al., 2000), toilet seats and door handles in a rehabilitation centre (Kuusi et al., 2002), and contaminated fomites on hard surfaces, carpets and soft furnishings in a concert hall (Evans et al., 2002).",

Wherever a NoV carrier comes in contact with food, contamination might occur and due to stability of these pathogens, they are likely to survive many food processes (see Section 4.6; Koopmans and Duizer, 2004). When viral contamination occurs through a person touching food, the contamination will be localised in spots (focally). Infections caused by focally contaminated foodstuffs are most likely to be recognised as foodborne when the contamination has occurred at the end of the food chain. Two reported examples show the characteristics of such outbreaks. One report from Sweden describes the large-scale outbreak detected in 30-day care centres in the Stockholm area in March 1999. All centres obtained their lunch meals from one caterer, and approximately 25% of all customers (n = 1500 customers) fell ill. The early cases had an average incubation time of 34 hours but the outbreak went on for at least 12 days, due to secondary infections. One of the food handlers fell ill in the same time window as the early cases and none of the other food handlers reported symptoms. This implies that the most likely route of food contamination was by a pre- or asymptomatic food handler (Gotz, 2002).",

The high sensitivity of this method (detection limit of 10-100 viral particles per gram stool) is one of its major advantages. Another advantage is that \u2013 theoretically \u2013 it can be applied to all kinds of substrates such as faeces, vomitus, serum, food-matrices and water. A RT-PCR protocol involves, in short, three stages:1.RNA extraction from the matrix: the viral RNA has to be released from the capsid and the resulting RNA suspension should be cleared from RT-PCR inhibitors, (RNases and DNases). The RNA extraction step forms the most crucial difference between methods for virus detection in food, water or environmental samples and clinical specimens. The importance of this step will be discussed in greater detail in section 4.2.3.2.The RT and PCR steps, in which a fragment of the viral RNA genome is transcribed into DNA and then amplified.3.Confirmation of the RT-PCR product to rule out false positive results and to type the amplified fragment.\n",

Additionally, generic tests are optimised for the detection of a broad range of viruses, not for the specific and more sensitive detection of one strain (Vennema et al., 2002).

Sequence data and phylogenetic analysis of the RdRp fragment and a fragment of the gene coding for the capsid protein (ORF2) have revealed that recombinant NoV strains have evolved, and thus that analysis of more than one region of the NoV genome may be important (Vinje et al., 2003; Atmar and Estes, 2001). An interesting method for typing of recombinants is described by Kageyama et al. (2003), who suggest amplification of the ORF1-ORF2 junction region, a fragment overlapping the RdRp and capsid gene. In that way, sequencing of just one fragment should suffice to type the strain and to discriminate between recombinants and \u2018old\u2019 strains. However, this will apply only when the recombination event has occurred in the junction region.

Another new method is the nucleic acid sequence based amplification (NASBA) technique which, in theory, should be simpler to perform and at least as sensitive as the RT-PCR (Jean et al., 2003; Moore et al., 2004). However, validation of these newer tests is still incomplete, rendering the specificity, sensitivity and broadness largely unknown.

After it was discovered that expression of the NoV ORF2 by recombinant baculoviruses in insect cells resulted in the self-assembling of the capsid protein into virus like particles (VLPs, Green et al., 1993), many antigen-based detection methods have been developed. The VLPs were first used to detect antibodies to NoV in serum samples (Green et al., 1993; Parker et al., 1993). Later, sera from animals inoculated with VLPs were used to develop enzyme immunoassays (EIAs) for the detection of NoVs in faeces (Jiang et al., 1995; Herrmann et al., 1995). Currently, several EIAs to detect NoV antigens are commercially available (Richards et al., 2003; Burton-Macleod et al., 2004); they are slightly less sensitive than RT-PCR methods, but since the EIAs can be applied by non-specialised laboratories and results can be obtained within 3-4 hours, these assays will be increasingly used to diagnose gastroenteritis outbreaks. The EIAs do not, however, yield information on virus typing, other than possibly the discrimination between GGI and GGII. Therefore, RT-PCR and sequencing of positive outbreaks will still have to be done to gain the information needed for virus tracking and to pinpoint common-source outbreaks.",

Due to the enormous variety in food matrices a considerable challenge for food microbiologists is found in the first stage of the RT-PCR protocol; the extraction of the viral RNA from the matrix. Many studies have focused on method development to extract viral RNA from shellfish, which has resulted in a variety of methods as reviewed by Lees (2000). Common features of these are dissection of the digestive tract and hepatopancreas (Schwab et al., 1998) and subsequent homogenisation, followed by variable (partial) purification and RNA extraction methods. The methods applied are however laborious and specialised and therefore, in general, not available to most routine labs. Other matrices for which virus detection methods have been developed include fresh produce and fruits (Bidawid et al., 2000; Leggitt and Jaykus, 2000; Dubois et al., 2002; Sair et al., 2002; Le Guyader et al., 2004), and hamburgers, ham, turkey and roast beef (Leggitt and Jaykus, 2000; Schwab et al., 2000; Sair et al., 2002). Since foods are often contaminated by an infected food handler, the contamination of food items may be low level and focal.",

Recently an immunomagnetic capture method was used to capture (concentrate and purify) NoV from a crude food suspension (Kobayashi et al., 2004).

For example, the NoV may be present, or persistent, in water or shellfish whereas the indicator organisms are not (Lees, 2000; Formiga-Cruz et al., 2002; Myrmel et al., 2004; Horman et al., 2004). In conclusion, the detection of NoVs in foods is still difficult, due largely to the low level, and focal way of contamination. Therefore, successful (pre-marketing) screening of foods is unlikely to be implemented soon, with the possible exception of shellfish. The generic RT-PCR protocols can, however, be optimised for sensitivedetection of one strain when sequence data for the contaminating strain is already obtained from patient diagnostics (Fig. 4.1\n). This approach was found to be successful in establishing a contaminated recreational fountain as the source of a gastroenteritis outbreak in schoolchildren by the NoV Birmingham strain (GGI.3) (Hoebe et al., 2004). Thus, for the detection of NoV in suspected foods (foods implicated by epidemiological data), optimised RT-PCR protocols may be used which might help to unambiguously link foods to outbreaks.",

Several authors have reported a poor correlation between conventional RT-PCR detection and virus infectivity in a cell culture assay: Slomka and Appleton (1998) and Duizer et al. (2004b) for FeCV after heat treatment or UV irradiation, Lewis et al. (2000) for poliovirus after UV irradiation, and Nuanualsuwan and Cliver (2002) for HAV, poliovirus and FeCV. On the other hand, for hypochlorite inactivation a good correlation was found between RNA detectability and infectivity (Nuanualsuwan and Cliver, 2002; Duizer et al., 2004b) and pretreatment (prior to RT-PCR) of heat or UV inactivated virus suspensions with RNase and proteinase K resulted in an improved correlation between PCR detectability and infectivity (Nuanualsuwan and Cliver, 2002). Recently it was shown that quantification of detectable RNA, by quantification of the RT-PCR signal or by application of quantitative RT-PCR methods, could improve the correlation too (Bhattacharya et al., 2004; Duizer et al., 2004b).

Additionally, to understand modes of transmission of viruses, or to recognise a common source outbreak, combining molecular virological data with epidemiological data is essential. Key to this approach is the development of two linked and searchable databases (Fig. 4.2\n). One database aggregates harmonised epidemiological data, which can be entered in an outbreak investigation form via the Internet. To obtain that goal, a minimum dataset needs to be identified and agreed upon. Relevant questions were on the symptoms of the illness, route of transmission, setting of the outbreak, involvement of foods, and the extent of diagnostic evaluation. A web-based questionnaire is an efficient way for collection of information during outbreaks of (viral) gastroenteritis (Koopmans et al., 2003).",

These outbreaks were significantly larger than outbreaks attributed to person-to-person transmission. A vehicle was reported in only 37% of outbreaks. In total, 69% of all the NoV outbreaks were associated with just one NoV strain, Grimsby virus. The Grimsby virus belongs to the Genogroup II.4 viruses (GGII.4, reference strain: Hu/NV/GGII/Bristol/1993/UK, other GGII.4 strains are Lordsdale virus and Camberwell virus). The proportion of Grimsby virus was highest in the winter of 2001/2002, when a novel variant Grimsby virus was detected across Europe. The Grimsby viruses were significantly more frequently detected in outbreaks labelled as person-to-person outbreaks than in food- or waterborne outbreaks, and in healthcare settings compared with other settings (FBVE network, unpublished data). In 2002, the emergence of a distinct variant GGII.4 virus made it to the headlines of the public media since this strain caused a tremendous increase in the number of outbreaks in UK hospitals and on international cruises.

Comparing viral genomes, at the sequence level, from samples that appear epidemiologically linked is the only way to conclusively identify common source outbreaks as such. It is clear that the accuracy of this method is dependent on the length of the fragment, the genome region, and the variation present between the virus strains under investigation. Although NoV are highly variable, and finding identical sequences in food or patient samples from different outbreaks indicates that these may be linked, the data need to be interpreted against a background of population-based data, or \u2013 minimally \u2013 data from outbreak surveillance. For instance, in the years 1996 and 2002, an epidemic wave of outbreaks occurred over a wide geographic region, in which a single variant NoV belonging to GGII.4 emerged. In these periods, finding identical sequences within the GGII.4 genogroup in different outbreaks meant nothing, other than that it was apparently an outbreak involved in the epidemic. On the other hand, in the same years, having identical sequences belonging to any of the other genotypes provided strong evidence for an epidemiological link.",

This strain was observed first in August 2000 in association with a large drinking-water related outbreak of gastroenteritis in France, and in the subsequent winter season in six other countries throughout Europe. The initial international outbreak occurred in three countries in association with consumption of imported oysters from France that met all microbiological quality assurance parameters. The GGIIb variant caused between 7 and 71% of all recognised NoV outbreaks detected during that season in different countries. Further characterisation of the new lineage of viruses showed a remarkable finding, namely that the newly recognised ORF1 region was associated with four different capsids. These capsids were similar to previously recognised NoVs. The conclusion was that the detected lineages in these series of outbreaks were in fact new NoV variants, generated through recombination.",

In the oyster-associated outbreaks, multiple variants were detected within the same product. Eating oysters (or other filter-feeding shellfish) contaminated with multiple strains, or ingesting multiple-contaminated products may lead to co-infection of people with related viruses, thereby facilitating the process of virus recombination (Fig. 4.3\n). This example clearly demonstrates that foodborne and waterborne transmission may have serious impact on the spread \u2013 and possibly even the generation \u2013 of emerging viral infections across countries.

Sequence data of the detected viruses showed that the increase coincided with the emergence of a new GGII.4 strain. The new virus which emerged in January 2002 had a distinct sequence in the gene coding for the RdRp, had not been seen previously and was the dominant cause of NoV outbreaks by mid summer in all but one of the countries participating in the FBVE network (Lopman et al., 2004). Further research is needed to understand if and how the observed changes translate to distinct biological properties such as infectivity, antigenicity or (environmental) stability of the new strain. The example does show that the network approach used is suited to detect and investigate the emergence of a new strain. Interestingly, the strain correlated to the increase in NoV outbreaks in 2002 is related to the strains that emerged in the winter of 1995-1996, and again in 2004-2005 In all cases a global epidemic of No V outbreaks was observed. This suggests that viruses of the GGII.4 genotype have properties facilitating transmission or infection, and thereby have the propensity to cause epidemics.",

These sea animals actively accumulate viruses from water contaminated with human excrements.

Moreover, depuration is not an effective method to reduce the viral load as it is for reducing bacterial contamination (Schwab et al., 1998; Muniain-Mujika et al., 2002; Kingsley and Richards, 2003) and the composition of the bodymass (proteins, fat, sugars) of shellfish contributes to increased virus stability in heat processing (Croci et al., 1999). Matters are further complicated by the fact that viral contamination of shellfish is reported for batches that meet bacteriological safety standards and the absence of indicator organisms in growing waters or marketed batches is not always a guarantee for the absence of infectious NoV (Chalmers and McMillan, 1995; Schwab et al., 1998; LeGuyader et al., 2003; Nishida et al., 2003).

For example, airborne spread of NoV and infection by inhalation with subsequent ingestion of virus particles was described for an outbreak in a hotel restaurant (Marks et al., 2000). An outbreak in a school showed evidence of direct infection by aerosolised viruses after a case of vomiting (Marks et al., 2003). In that same study it was found that cleaning with a quaternary ammonium preparation was ineffective. In all cases, viruses were spread by acts of vomiting.",

Whereas information on the swine enteric caliciviruses is still very scarce, recent studies on the bovine enteric caliciviruses (BEC) suggest that most BECs are best classified into a distinct genogroup (GGIII), and some may even be in a distinct genus (Oliver et al., 2003; Smiley et al., 2003; Wise et al., 2004). Nevertheless, genetic distances between animal NoV and human NoV are within the range found for different lineages of human viruses. Additionally, the animal NoV are enteric caliciviruses and possess a similar tissue tropism in their hosts as do the human NoV (Smiley et al., 2002). This suggests that given the right circumstances, interspecies transmission might occur.",

Therefore, knowledge of efficient inactivation methods and effective intervention in transmission pathways is limited and mostly based on studies using model viruses (reviewed in Koopmans and Duizer, 2004) or quantitative RT-PCR methods to asses RNA disintegration of NoV (Nuanualsuwan and Cliver, 2002; Duizer et al., 2004b). The most commonly used model for NoV in inactivation studies is the feline calicivirus (FeCV) and this virus is proposed as surrogate virus for testing of virucidal activity of disinfectants (Steinmann, 2004). In several tests it was found that FeCV was not efficiently inactivated on environmental surfaces or in suspension by, for example, 1% anionic detergents, quaternary ammonium (1:10), hypochlorite solutions with < 300 ppm free chlorine, or less than 50% or more than 80% alcohol preparations (ethanol or 1- and 2-propanol) (Scott, 1980; Gehrke et al., 2004; Duizer et al., 2004a). Varying efficacies of 65 to 75% alcohol preparations are reported, however, short contact times (< 1 min) rarely resulted in more than 4-log inactivation. Moreover, the presence of faecal or other organic material reduces the virucidal efficacy of many chemicals tested. The efficacy of seven commercial disinfectants for the inactivation of FeCV on strawberries and lettuce was tested by Gulati and co-workers and they found that none of the disinfectants was effective (defined as reducing the virus titer by at least 3-log10) when used at the FDA permitted concentration (Gulati et al., 2001). These data were recently confirmed by Alwood and co-workers for sodium bicarbonate, chlorine bleach, peroxyacetic acid and hydrogen peroxide at FDA approved concentrations (Allwood et al., 2004).",

The relative resistance of FeCV to UV radiation is intermediate, i.e., comparable to that for the enteroviruses (Gerba et al., 2002), less effective than for vegetative bacteria, but more effective than for phage MS2 (De Roda Husman et al., 2004) and for adenoviruses 2 and 40 (Gerba et al., 2002; Thurston-Enriquez et al., 2003) and B. subtillis spores (Chang et al., 1985). The inactivation of caliciviruses by ionising (gamma) radiation was found to be ineffective, requiring doses of 300-500 Gy to achieve 3 log reduction, i.e., more than twice as much as for phage MS2. Moreover, the low efficacy was even further reduced by increasing the protein content of the suspension to 3-4 ug/ml (De Roda Husman et al., 2004). Other studies reported no apparent effect of ultrasonic energy (26 kHz) on FeCV (Scherba et al., 1991), but complete inactivation by high hydrostatic pressure after 5-min treatments with 275 MPa or more (Kingsley et al., 2002a). Based on comparative PCR data it was concluded that FeCV was a valuable model for NoV in inactivation experiments. However, the enteric NoV was significantly less sensitive to low pH treatments, indicating the need for a truly enteric virus as model for NoV or for an in vitro method for the detection of NoV viability (Duizer et al., 2004b).",

This combination of high stability and resistance with a low minimal infectious dose has led to several remarkable outbreaks as described above. Awaiting further data on inactivation of NoV by milder disinfectants or treatments it is probably best to apply thorough heating (cooking) for water and food, and high hypochlorite concentrations (> 1%) for disinfection of surfaces when contamination with NoV is suspected.",

The attack rate is high, and the symptoms develop fast, resulting in outbreaks that are easily recognised. The work of the FBVE network has shown that foodborne transmission of viruses contributes significantly to the epidemiology and disease burden of NoV. What does that tell us about food-related risks for other viruses, especially the structurally similar viruses, such as enteroviruses (e.g. poliovirus, coxsackie viruses), hepatitis A virus, and hepatitis E virus? The basic properties that contribute to foodborne transmission, such as asymptomatic carriage and shedding, environmental stability, oral infectivity, and low minimal infectious dose are similar to those of the NoVs. Several examples of food- and water-related outbreaks with these viruses exist. The biggest difference with NoVs is that enteroviruses, hepatitis A and hepatitis E viruses cause illness in a smaller proportion of those exposed, and that these symptoms become noticeable up to ten weeks post infection. As a result, a relation between the illness and a food source will not be made unless it is very obvious, for instance, because a group of cases all participated in the same conference. Otherwise, such outbreaks can be detected only by the use of virus tracking, as described above.",

This is an important message, because the globalisation of the food chain and international travel are contributing factors to the rapid dissemination of emerging diseases. This is illustrated by the example of SARS, which was considered to be a respiratory pathogen, where control efforts have focused on control of droplet transmission in close person-to-person contacts. Epidemiological and laboratory studies have, however, shown that a major proportion of the SARS cases in Hong Kong has been linked to environmental transmission due to a faulty sewage system (WHO, 2003). Moreover, SARS coronavirus is found to infect intestinal epithelial cells in humans and the majority of SARS patients shed high loads of infectious virus in their stools (Leung et al., 2003), SARS coronavirus is relatively stable in the environment (Duan et al., 2003), coronaviruses in animals are known for their dual tissue tropism (respiratory and enteric), and food animal handlers in Guangdong had increased prevalence of antibodies against the SARS virus (CDC, 2003). Thus, with increasing data becoming available, one can question if the droplet-based respiratory transmission is truly the only mode of transmission. All the factors mentioned suggest that the potential of transmission of SARS coronavirus via human faecal waste is there. During the major outbreak in 2003, foodborne transmission has not been documented, but the latest SARS cases in Guangdong that occurred in December/January 2004 were linked to two restaurants. Without being alarmed, these factors should be used as a warning sign. If SARS is transmitted via food, the NoV data show that we do not have sufficient safeguards in place to prevent human disease.",

The expansion should include three areas: (i) a more complete coverage of qualified laboratories per country, (ii) inclusion of more countries in international surveillance networks and (iii) development and implementation of detection methods of more classes of viruses in the surveillance programs.

Increased awareness of food as a vector for viruses, combined with increased laboratory capabilities and the implementation of virus tracking methods and molecular epidemiology might result in detection of foodborne transmission of as yet unforeseen viruses. Hopefully the diagnostic gap in gastrointestinal illnesses such as gastroenteritis and hepatitis will be narrowed down.
