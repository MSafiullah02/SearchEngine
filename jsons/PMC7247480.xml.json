Some of these societies sign up a proportion of their members and become Collective ISN Members at a special annual rate.

Such in-region training ensures relevant clinical experience, minimises language and cultural disparities and has also reduced the concern that fellows going to HIC find attractive career opportunities there and never return home. For example, since 2010, more than 90% of fellows from sub-Saharan Africa, who have trained in centers in South Africa, have returned home. One reason for the change in emphasis towards supporting fellowship training within region is the increasing number of centers in LMIC with the expertise and capacity to provide such training, several of which had graduated from the Sister Renal Center program. From 2016 ISN recognised the best of these, nine throughout the world, as Regional Training Centers (Table 5\n.).",
