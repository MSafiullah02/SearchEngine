At least five bat paramyxoviruses have been identified, which include Hendra virus, Nipah virus, Tioman virus, Menangle virus and Mapuera virus. There is anecdotal evidence suggesting that porcine rubulavirus may also originate from bats [19, 26], and Indian bats may carry a paramyxovirus antigenically related to simian virus 41 and parainfluenza virus 2 [15]. While it is not clear why bats seem to be an ideal reservoir host for many different viruses, one suggested possibility is the direct result of their great species diversity and population abundance. If these are the main drivers for virus distribution and evolution, one would expect to find even more viruses in rodents, since they are the most diverse mammalian animals on earth [1].",

The virus grew in suckling mouse brain and formed syncytia in Vero and BHK cells. NarPV was identified as a member of the family Paramyxoviridae, mainly based the structure of its nucleocapsids (approximately 20 nm in diameter and mean length 1.8 \u03bcm) and its virion morphology, being enveloped, spherical and pleomorphic with surface projections [23]. The virus displayed no serological cross-reactivity with a range of known paramyxoviruses at the time of isolation, including parainfluenza virus types 1-4, mumps virus, Newcastle disease virus and measles virus [8]. NarPV resembles members of the genera Respirovirus and Rubulavirus in that it generates only cytoplasmic inclusion bodies in virus-infected cells [23]. In this respect, it differs from members of the genus Morbillivirus that produce both cytoplasmic and nuclear inclusions in infected cells. However, haemagglutination and cell-binding studies performed on guinea pig and monkey red blood cells suggested that NarPV, like measles virus, does not use sialic acid receptors on red blood cells as do respiroviruses and rubulaviruses [8].",

            "text": "Like other members of the Paramyxovirinae, the NarPV H protein is predicted to be a type II integral membrane protein with a hydrophobic domain located at the N-terminal region (aa 41\u201368) functioning both as the signal sequence and the transmembrane anchor. For certain paramyxoviruses, the attachment protein can be made in a soluble form by using an alternative in-frame ATG codon within the signal/anchor sequence [18]. For NarPV H protein, an in-frame ATG codon was present at aa 56, which has the potential to produce a soluble H protein if translation initiates from this ATG codon. The sequence surrounding this ATG codon (TGCATGT) does not have a strong conservation to the Kozak consensus sequence (ACCATGG). This is also true for the first ATG codon of the predicted H ORF, which has the sequence AAAATGG. It is therefore possible that both ATG codons are used in vivo, albeit probably with different efficiencies. The 6-aa motif (NRKSCS) present in the predicted neuraminidase active site found in respirovirus and rubulavirus HN proteins [14] is absent in the NarPV H protein. It had the sequence AYDGCA at the corresponding site, with only the C residue conserved. The MosPV G protein has the sequence VFDGCS in this region. There are three potential N-linked glycosylation sites predicted for the NarPV H protein at N70, N177 and N575. Although MosPV G protein also has three predicted N-linked glycosylation sites at N155, N175 and N319, only one site at N177 for NarPV and N175 for MosPV is located at the same location in the protein. For NarPV H protein, the N70 site is located very close to the transmembrane domain and is therefore unlikely to be glycosylated in vivo.",

It is obvious that SeV and the rest of rodent viruses characterized to date do not share a common ancestor virus.
