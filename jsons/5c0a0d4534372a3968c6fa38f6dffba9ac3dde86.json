            "text": "Background: Real-time bedside information on regional ventilation and perfusion during mechanical ventilation (MV) may help to elucidate the physiological and pathophysiological effects of MV settings in healthy and injured lungs. We aimed to study the effects of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) and tidal volume (V T ) on the distributions of regional ventilation and perfusion by electrical impedance tomography (EIT) in healthy and injured lungs. Methods: One-hit acute lung injury model was established in 6 piglets by repeated lung lavages (injured group). Four ventilated piglets served as the control group. A randomized sequence of any possible combination of three V T (7, 10, and 15 ml/kg) and four levels of PEEP (5, 8, 10, and 12 cmH 2 O) was performed in all animals. Ventilation and perfusion distributions were computed by EIT within three regionsof-interest (ROIs): nondependent, middle, dependent. A mixed design with one between-subjects factor (group: intervention or control), and two within-subjects factors (PEEP and V T ) was used, with a three-way mixed analysis of variance (ANOVA). Results: Two-way interactions between PEEP and group, and V T and group, were observed for the dependent ROI (p = 0.035 and 0.012, respectively), indicating that the increase in the dependent ROI ventilation was greater at higher PEEP and V T in the injured group than in the control group. A two-way interaction between PEEP and V T was observed for perfusion distribution in each ROI: nondependent (p = 0.030), middle (p = 0.006), and dependent (p = 0.001); no interaction was observed between injured and control groups. Conclusions: Large PEEP and V T levels were associated with greater pulmonary ventilation of the dependent lung region in experimental lung injury, whereas they affected pulmonary perfusion of all lung regions both in the control and in the experimental lung injury groups.",

            "text": "Electrical impedance tomography (EIT) has emerged as a new functional-imaging method potentially meeting many clinical needs. It is a non-invasive, radiation-free tool to monitor, in real-time and at the bedside, the distribution of pulmonary ventilation [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] . Subjecting the patient's chest to minute electrical currents, EIT measures the electric potentials at the chest wall surface to produce two-dimensional (2D) images that reflect the impedance distribution within the thorax. Cyclic variations in pulmonary air and blood content are the major determinants for the changes in thoracic impedance. Because cyclic changes in local impedance mainly correspond to changes in lung aeration, EIT can reliably assess imbalances in the distribution of regional ventilation [3, 4, 11, 12] . Besides other features like portability and the possibility of aroundthe-clock monitoring, the high temporal resolution (modern EIT devices generate up to 50 images per second) is another important aspect of this imaging method, which also allows the study of rapid physiological phenomena, such as the regional perfusion [13] .",

All animals were studied lying in the supine position under general anesthesia with mandatorymode mechanical ventilation provided via tracheostomy. They were pre-medicated with intramuscular xylazine 2 mg/kg, ketamine 20 mg/kg, and midazolam 0.5 mg/kg. An ear vein was cannulated and intravenous ketamine 32 mg/kg/h, fentanyl 4 mcg/kg/h, and midazolam 0.16 mg/kg/h were administered. Adequacy of anesthesia was confirmed by the absence of reaction to painful stimulation between the front hooves and the absence of any signs of sympathetic stimulation after paralysis. Muscle relaxation was achieved using continuous infusion of rocuronium titrated against the spontaneous respiratory effort. Normovolemia was maintained with intravenous infusion of Ringer's lactate solution at 20 ml/kg/h for the first hour followed by 10 ml/kg/h. MV was performed using a Servo-I ventilator (Maquet, Rastatt, Germany). During the instrumentation phase, ventilation was provided in volume-controlled mode, with V T of 10 ml/kg, respiratory rate (RR) 25 breaths/min, PEEP 5 cm H 2 O, inspiratory-toexpiratory (I:E) ratio 1:2, and fraction of inspired oxygen (F I O 2 ) 0.4. ECG, invasive systemic, central venous, and pulmonary artery blood pressures were transduced using a standard clinical monitor (IntelliVue M8004A, Philips Healthcare, Best, Netherlands). Digital outputs from the ventilator and clinical monitor were continuously recorded using the acqIS software (EPiQ Life Science AB, Kista, Sweden). A femoral artery was cannulated for pulse contour cardiac output monitoring (PiCCO, Pulsion Medical Systems, Munich, Germany). Pulmonary artery flotation catheter thermodilution cardiac output measurements and arterial blood gas analyses were performed at the beginning and end of the scanning series for each animal.",

Perfusion maps obtained by injecting a bolus of 10 ml of a hypertonic solution (NaCl 10%) into a central venous catheter during an expiratory breath hold for 20 s. Due to its high conductivity, NaCl 10% acts as an EIT contrast agent [16] , which after injection into the right atrium during apnea passes through the pulmonary circulation, thereby producing a dilution curve that follows typical first-pass kinetics. The resulting regional impedance curves are then analyzed to quantitatively assess regional perfusion [13, 17, 18] , expressed as the percentage of total pulmonary blood flow through each of the three ROIs (total 100%).",

In contrast, pulmonary blood flow of all lung regions was altered by larger PEEP and tidal volume both in control piglets and in piglets with saline lavage-induced lung injury. Our study demonstrates that EIT can measure physiological and supra-physiological levels of pulmonary ventilation and perfusion, and their changes associated with different MV settings such as PEEP and V T , continuously, in real-time, and at the bedside. This information may be critical for a timely evaluation of the precision and efficacy of attempts to minimize some of the main ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI) mechanisms, particularly in the presence of alveolar collapse, common in the lungs of patients with the ARDS [19] . Our data highlight that airspaces collapse in the injured group altered the pulmonary regional ventilation response to different PEEP and V T levels. Notwithstanding, when analyzing the effects of PEEP and V T on regional perfusion, airspaces collapse did not seem to play a major role. Regarding regional perfusion, the mutual interaction between PEEP and tidal volume seemed to be more relevant. Our findings on regional ventilation may be interpreted as predominantly gravity-related, since the ventilation of the more dependent region exhibited a greater increase in its percentage with increasing V T and PEEP in the injured group than in the control one. On the other hand, our findings on regional perfusion, where all regions were altered and the presence or not of lung injury did not have an effect, suggest that V T and PEEP interacted all over the lung parenchyma on the redistribution of regional perfusion to the dependent zones [20, 21] , also in agreement with pulmonary blood volume tidal redistribution [22] .",

The greatest determinant of pulmonary blood perfusion distribution is the difference between alveolar and pulmonary capillary pressures [28] . Perfusion increases down the gravitational gradient in the lung, due to hydrostatic forces and structural factors. Atelectasis is pronounced in the dependent lung regions, where perfusion of non-ventilated lung parenchyma produces a shunt effect of around 8-10% of cardiac output in healthy lungs [24] , and a greater shunt in injured lungs. In addition, nongravitational inhomogeneity of perfusion can reduce arterial blood oxygenation. Elevated airway pressures applied to the lung during mechanical ventilation can compromise venous return and redirect blood flow to dependent lung regions, with the effect being more marked at higher levels of PEEP and/or V T [29] . Our data demonstrate that these effects can be regionally monitored, measured, and tracked in real-time and at the bedside by EIT. Our distributions of regional pulmonary perfusion at different PEEP and V T levels may have been also partly influenced through hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction (HPV) [30] . In conditions of atelectasis, as in the injured group here, HPV could have been greater at low levels of PEEP and V T . Noteworthy, we have shown before that perfusion is similar, whether a region is collapsed is aerated but non-ventilated [13] , findings that fit with observations by Benumof [31] -that HPV is the main mechanism of reduced blood flow in atelectatic regions, not mechanical obstruction.",

            "text": "The main limitation of our study may be in the animal model that is not capable of reproducing all of the key characteristics of lung injury in humans, for example in ARDS patients, where EIT titration of MV may be most helpful. Any animal model is relevant for only limited aspects of ARDS pathophysiology. However, if the specific characteristics of an animal model are carefully taken in account, and its findings are interpreted in the context of the study limitations, animal investigations can provide valid assessments of relevant elements of ARDS in human patients. The surfactant depletion by saline lavage model was developed based on the observation that ARDS is associated with depletion of surfactant from the air spaces and reduced concentrations of surfactant-associated proteins in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid [32] . However, determining precisely the extent to which the lung injury is caused by the saline lavage, by mechanical ventilation, or both remains challenging. Depletion of surfactant may be associated with lung injury via two mechanisms: greater lung collapse and increased likelihood of mechanical injury during repeated cycles of airspaces opening/closure, and impaired alveolar host defenses. Characteristically, saline lavage leads to almost immediate hypoxemia, which may be rapidly reversed by recruitment maneuvers, suggesting that the gas exchange abnormalities reflect collapsed alveoli with otherwise intact alveolar walls. The saline lavage by itself has little consequence in terms of permeability changes or inflammation [33] , although TNF-alpha is detectable in lavage fluid. Despite surfactant depletion being an important feature of ARDS in humans, it usually appears as a consequence rather than the primary cause of lung injury [34] . In ARDS, surfactant abnormalities occur because of injury to the alveolar epithelium and exudation of protein-rich edema fluid into the alveolar spaces. Saline lavage of the lungs results in surfactant depletion in the absence of major alveolar epithelial damage. Epithelial damage occurs only when the saline lavage is followed by an injurious ventilatory strategy. Therefore, surfactant depletion followed by mechanical ventilation simulates established ARDS and provides information about the consequences of surfactant depletion, but it is less useful in modeling the initial pathophysiological mechanisms that lead to ARDS. The major advantage of the saline lavage model is that it provides an ideal way to test the effects of different ventilatory strategies on the development of lung injury [33] .",

The regional time-impedance curves resulting from 10% NaCl injection [16, 35, 36] were fitted on a pixel-by-pixel basis by a gammavariate function to quantitatively assess regional perfusion [17, 18] . The subtraction of the cardiac component of perfusion from mixed pixels while maintaining the net lung component by using an EIT gamma variate algorithm is an essential feature of this method. Such was made possible by the fitting also of the early cardiac component, also on a pixel-by-pixel basis by a corresponding gamma-variate function. However, at the edges of the heart, some challenging overlap between the behavior of lung and heart tissue may have remained, sometimes causing uncertainties in the double-function fitting process applied. Although the location of the cardiac chambers in humans could make this differentiation easier in the clinical setting, more studies on this subject are needed.",

In this situation, the solute that remains in the vessel will leave the lungs through the venous drainage while the diffused solute will tend to stay in the lungs, violating the conservation of mass principle (unless an extravascular compartment is accounted for). For the calculations of the maximal slope; however, the conservation of mass could still be applied correctly, since one of the assumptions is that there is no outflow of hypertonic saline before the peak of the pulmonary artery input function. In this case, the conservation of mass implies that all the solute that reaches the ROI (feeding vessel and extravascular compartment together), irrespective of whether it remains inside the vessels or not, came through the feeding artery.",

Moreover, pulmonary blood flow of all lung regions is affected by larger levels of PEEP and tidal volume, both in control animals and in piglets with saline lavage-induced lung injury. They also suggest that EIT is a promising bedside and noninvasive clinical tool for continuous and real-time monitoring of pulmonary ventilation that can be especially useful in severe mechanically ventilated patients such as those with ARDS. EIT can help to optimize mechanical ventilation settings, detect complications such as derecruitment, and provide estimates of perfusion distribution. More clinical validation studies are awaited to explore the full potential of the technology. ",
