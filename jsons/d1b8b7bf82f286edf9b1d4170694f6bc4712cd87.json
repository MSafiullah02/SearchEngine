We use (a) the stable cumulative infection of various countries and (b) the number of infection versus the tests carried out to evaluate the model. The time-dependent infection rate is set in the model to obtain the best fit with the available data. The model is simulated aiming to project the probable features of the infection in India, various Indian states, and other countries. India imposed an early lockdown to contain the infection that can be treated by its healthcare system. We find that with the current infection rate and containment measures, the total active infection in India would be maximum at the end of June or beginning of July 2020. With proper containment measures in the infected zones and social distancing, the infection is expected to fall considerably from August. If the containment measures are relaxed before the arrival of the peak infection, more people from the susceptible population will fall sick as the infection is expected to see a three-fold rise at the peak. If the relaxation is given a month after the peak infection, a second peak with a moderate infection will follow. However, a gradual relaxation applied well ahead of peak infection, leads to a two-fold increase in the peak infection. The projection of the model is highly sensitive to the choice of the parameters and the available data. Our model provides a semi-quantitative overview of the progression of COVID-19 in India, with model projections reasonably replicating the current progress. However, since the pandemic is an ongoing dynamic phenomenon, the reported results are subjected to regular updates in consonance with the acquired real data.",

            "text": "In the post-WW-2 era, the world probably has not witnessed such catastrophic morbidity and the looming threat of severe economic challenges caused by the worldwide outbreak of the disease COVID-19 caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The detection of the disease in the human host was first reported in Wuhan, China on 31 December 2019 as a cluster of cases of pneumonia. As the highly contagious disease transmitted rapidly all over the globe, the outbreak was declared as a pandemic by the WHO on 11 March 2020. Tackling the outspread of the disease is found to be very challenging across the world for the following reasons: (a) conventional flu-like symptoms in human carriers and (b) human-to-human transmission via asymptomatic human hosts and (c) the absence of a proper clinical doctrine (e.g. vaccine, drugs, concrete ideas about the immunological response, etc.). Extensive testing and imposition of containment measures to maintain social distancing turn out to be the effective remedies to prevent disease transmission at the current stage of the epidemic at several places. To evaluate the impact of these preventive measures on infection spread, recovery, death tolls, and various other associated factors, mathematical models become useful in predicting realistic, quantitative estimates. A preliminary analysis * sspsc6@iacs.res.in \u2020 sspas2@iacs.res.in \u2021 sspsc5@iacs.res.in \u00a7 mcsmk2057@iacs.res.in \u00b6 raja.paul@iacs.res.in suggests that the classic mean-field Susceptible-Infected-Recovery-Death (SIRD) model by Kermack and McKendrick [1, 2] , can be used to obtain a quantitative picture of the epidemic [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] . In this article, implementing the SIRD model, we report the temporal progress of COVID-19 transmission in India, various Indian states and compare it with some other countries around the world. A similar model used by Fernandez-Villaverde et al [5] provides a detailed overview of the pandemic situation in the USA and many other countries.",

On the day of the announcement of nation-wide lockdown India had about 657 corona positive cases while the first COVID-19 positive was detected on January 30, 2020. The socio-economic constraints in the Indian context alludes that: (a) 'too-prolonged' lockdown is difficult to sustain; (b) the sole imposition of containment measures without a manifold increase in testing capacity is a futile endeavor; (c) if the implementation of the lockdown measures is lenient, containment of the spread is highly improbable. Henceforth, the feasible solution for limiting the spread lies in carefully balancing various key epidemiological factors. That is where the importance of the current model predictions becomes relevant.",

The model predicts that, in India, the height of the peak infection decreases with stricter lockdown, but at the cost of 'time' (position of the peak shifts to a later month). Thus, with a large susceptible, the infection will stay for a long time if existing infections are not quarantined immediately or no proper medicine/vaccine is employed. The key is to quarantine the infection in small pockets while in lockdown and prevent inter-pocket transmission. The model further underlines that in the highly contagious zones ('red' zones where COVID-19 positive cases continue to grow), if the present lockdown is extended and reinforced with stricter quarantine measures, the new infections will gradually plummet down flattening the COVID-19 curve at a much faster rate.",

When a susceptible person interacts with an infectious person, the susceptible become infected at a rate \u03b2SI/N . Large variability is observed in the rate \u03b3 that an infected individual is no longer infectious or equivalently has recovered in this simplified model. Literature [9] [10] [11] suggests that, on the average, infectiousness appears to start from 2-3 days before the symptoms are visible. The infectiousness increases to its peak before the arrival of the symptoms and remains for about 7-9 days after the peak infection. Thus an infected individual remains infectious for about 12 days on the average and then recover. In our preliminary analysis, we set the recovery rate \u03b3 \u223c 1/12, which however does not give the best fit for all the cases we studied. In essence, the numerical values of the model parameters are obtained from the best fit.

Nevertheless, the geographical, social, and economical characteristics of a region (and various other demographic factors) can substantially influence this number. We used two different approaches to get an estimate of S 0 . First, we study the data for the large countries where the cumulative positive cases have reached closer to a plateau. Though, the infected population at the plateau can be determined only when the epidemic is over. Dividing this number by the total population of the country gives a fraction that appears to be of the order for 10 \u22123 for Germany, USA, Spain, Italy, and 10 \u22124 and 10 \u22125 for South Korea and China respectively. Thus an estimate of the susceptible may be obtained by multiplying the population of a country by this fraction. The number of susceptible obtained in this way, however, indicates a lower bound as many individuals with mild or no symptoms go unreported. Another possibility to estimate the fraction would be to test the number of positive cases by the number of tests carried out. This number would be an upper bound since there are many regions within a country that remains completely isolated and the populations in such pockets would not be susceptible. The ratio between the number of positive cases and the total number of tests for different countries are given in the following; the fraction is 0.159 for the USA, 0.016 for South Korea (as per data up to May 7), 0.1072 for Spain, 0.063 for Germany (as per data up to May 10). Conventionally, in epidemiological modeling S 0 \u223c N . In our simulation, we have reasonably varied S 0 within this range to obtain the best fit with real data in a case by case manner (i.e for India and other countries).",

In other words, from the deterministic SIRD model, the objective is to assess how fast a human carrier would infect people belonging to the population of susceptible? The quantity that determines the transmission speed of the pandemic is the effective reproduction number or replacement number (R e ) [12] . Often the basic reproduction number R 0 , defined as the average number of secondary infections that occur when an infec- tious person (primary or source of infection) is placed into a susceptible population, is used in the epidemiological models. R 0 can be estimated from the very early stage of the infection when the infectious person mixes freely with the susceptible population. Estimating R 0 is often challenging due to lack of unbiased data as all secondary infections cannot be determined exactly; especially for COVID-19, where asymptomatic cases are hardly identified (Fig. 1B) . The effective reproduction number (R e ), which we used in this study, evaluates the mean number of new infections (infected from the susceptible pool) directly transmitted/induced by a typical infected person and can vary over the entire duration of the infection (Fig. 1C) . In the SIRD model, R e can be represented as \u03b2/(\u03b3 + \u03b4). From the best fit of the data, we find that \u03b3 >> \u03b4, yielding R e \u223c \u03b2/\u03b3. If R e > 1, the disease starts spreading in a population infecting more and more people, but spreading does not occur if R e falls below 1. It is easy to notice that longer a person remains infectious (i.e. 1/\u03b3 days), can give rise to very large R e even if the number of interactions per day (i.e. \u03b2) is small.",

Without lockdown \u03b6=1, referring to rapid infection while \u03b6 = 0 means that infection is contained (e.g no interaction between infected and susceptible population, hence no transmission). \u03b6 \u2208 [0,1] reflects the asymptotic mitigation of the infection rate\u03b2(t), when containment measures are imposed. Lower the value of \u03b6, stricter is the containment measures (or the manifestation of the same) [5, 6] . Here the initially chosen value of \u03b2 ends with \u03b6\u03b2. Essentially, the initial value of \u03b2 determines the characteristic properties of the disease which depends on the effective interaction of people in a region, social behavior, density of population, etc. The terminal value \u03b6\u03b2 reflects the effect of the containment and how the social distancing is being maintained. The functional form of\u03b2(t) is arbitrary and chosen semi-empirically to obtain the best fit with the available data. The model simulation, data analysis, and plotting are carried out in python. The analysis of the COVID-19 data, using the deterministic compartmental SIRD model, sheds light on the primary characteristics of the temporal evolution of the pandemic. Relevant parameter values chosen for the India and few Indian states are listed in Table S1 -S2. The best-fit parameters chosen for foreign countries are listed in Table S3 .",

Detailed results are described in the following and illustrated in Fig. 2 -10, Fig. S1 -S2. In a nutshell, we start with the initial susceptible population (S 0 ) varying in the range \u223c 1-3 million S 0 , keeping the effective reproduction number R e fixed at \u223c 4.0, and show how the model prediction fits with the Indian data without a lockdown, the location of the infection peak and the relative deviation from the real data ( Fig. 2A) . The best fit is obtained by tuning the rates of infection (\u03b2), recovery (\u03b3), and deaths (\u03b4) keeping S 0 constrained in the mentioned range. Then, we incorporate the effect of containment-measures/lockdown in the functional form of \u03b2 and show how the effect of the containmentmeasures has altered the location and the height of the infection peak (Fig. 2B ). Next, we explore how the variability in the effective reproduction number R e influences the infection peak ( Fig. 3-4 ). Furthermore, we analyze the COVID-19 progression in few Indian states e.g Kerala, Maharashtra, Delhi, and West Bengal ( Fig. 5-6 ) and foreign countries e.g South Korea, Germany, USA, Spain ( Fig. 7-8) . Lastly, we explore, in brief, what happens to the outspread, if the lockdown is lifted (in other words, containment measures are relaxed) in the Indian context ( Fig. 9-10 ).",

With susceptible population S 0 varied in the range \u223c 1-3 million (for fixed R e \u223c 4.0), the peak of the infection occurs in the first half of May ( Fig. 2A ). As expected, the peak height (infected population at the peak) increases with increasing S 0 . For an initial susceptible pool of S 0 \u223c 10 6 , the peak reaches a height of 0.4 million, whereas the peak jumps to \u223c 1.2 million for S 0 \u223c 3 million ( Fig. 2A) .

From March 8 onwards, there was a rapid upsurge of infections. However, about two weeks after the national lockdown is imposed, Kerala reached its infection peak. It is evident from Fig. 5A -5B that the downfall of the infection is rapid, as the infection curve moved past its peak. If the lockdown was not enforced, the infection was projected to occur around mid-May. But, Fig. 5B alludes that Kerala implemented the containment measures so well that the infection peak occurred early at a much lower height (Fig. 5A-5B) . The model analysis further projects that due to the effect of lockdown, R e reduces to \u223c 18 % of its initial value during the upsurge of infections before lockdown.

The factor and exponent a and b are similar for all the countries considered in the plots. This finding indicates that there exists an underlying universality in the outspread of the pandemic across various countries. Rapid lifting of the local containment paves the way for inter-mingling between regions with no positive cases (green) and regions with positive cases found lately (red). This, in turn, results in rapid transmission of the disease across zones (all zones becoming red), rendering the purpose of preceding lockdown futile. On the contrary, initially, the partial lifting of local containment only in the green zones bars the import of transmissions from red zones. When a red zone becomes green, the local containment can be lifted from that region. Due to the effect of this gradual lifting, the red zones diminish over time, with 'greens' taking over the 'reds'.",

In the case of seasonal flu, infection mostly occurs when a person has symptoms [13] . However, as we understand from the literature survey, an individual with COVID-19 would be contagious before developing symptoms. The incubation period for COVID-19 is 5 days, and maximum infectiousness appears to be 2-3 days before the symptoms appear. Thus infection spread by an individual is maximum he/she becomes sick [10, 14] . Due to limitations of the testing procedure diagnosis takes about 5 days after symptoms are visible, i.e., 10 days from the day of infection. Clearly, on the average, an infected individual is beyond the peak of maximum infectiousness after this time. Thus, a reduced rate of infection demands early diagnosis and isolation of positive patients. This means that a COVID-19 patient needs to be identified in the pre-symptomatic stage as evidence suggests the infectiousness of the patient before developing symptoms which is extremely challenging (effectively, RT-PCR needs to be carried out for every individual who might have come in contact with the patient). The epidemic becomes even more complex due to a majority of the infected individual who develops mild or no symptoms [14, 15] . Therefore even with isolating/quarantining all the infected COVID-19 would not be eliminated for two reasons: a) normally an individual would be tested after symptoms appear which is when he/she has passed the peak of the contagiousness, b) asymptomatically infected person, in general, are not tested but he/she is also contagious like the symptomatic individual.",

We find if the containment is relaxed before the peak infection is reached at the end of June, the infection would rise rapidly to a great extent (Fig. 9A) . The peak height reduces, if the containment measures are relaxed, when the infection is close to the peak, a time point around the 3rd week of June (Fig. 9B) . However, if the relaxation occurs a month after the peak infection, a second peak arrives which is lower than the first infection-peak (Fig. 9C) . A third possibility is to gradually relax the containment measures after May 17. The model shows that in this case the original peak does not shift its position but becomes two-fold higher than before (Fig. 9D) . A gradual relaxation could be carried out in steps: (a) First, identify all the sensitive (red) and safe (green) zones having positive and no cases respectively. Smaller the size of such zones, easier they can be managed by the administration, and necessary supplies can be arranged. It is important to seal the boundary of the red zones. (b) Test for new cases carrying symptoms and randomly test a few having no symptoms. (c) Dissolve the boundary between red and neighboring green zones once the red zone does not report a case for two weeks. This process will increase the size of the green zone where more and more people can communicate and business can restart. Successively extending the relaxation from the local neighborhood to the cities, districts, states, the containment measures can be relaxed across the country. Nevertheless, social distancing is mandatory even after the containment is officially lifted as there might be many undetected cases that can trigger the spread of the disease again.

The lockdown stringency, characterized by the time-dependent \u03b2, \u03b6, was varied to get an estimate of the infected population. Corresponding data are shown in each figure by the shaded envelope around the mean curves. The model appears to be sensitive to the variation in the value of \u03b6 and S 0 when compared with the real data.
