They can also perform many bed side procedures for critically ill patients14 such as placement of central lines and temporary vascular access. The Society of Vascular 15 Surgery (SVS) recently published new regulations for vascular trainees, which includes 16 accepting 44 weeks of clinical time including any non-voluntary time for 2019-2020 academic 17 year without preapproval, and a 10% decrease of total reported cases. Non-voluntary time off 18 used for clinical or education purpose can be counted as clinical time. Trainees are learning 19 about \"check-ins\" and \"E-visits\" with the newly introduced HCPCS codes G2010, G2012), and 20 about remote patient monitoring services such as a patient's oxygen saturation levels using pulse 21 oximetry (CPT codes 99091, 99457-99458, 99473-99474, 99493-99494).
