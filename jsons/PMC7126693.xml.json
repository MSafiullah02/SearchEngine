            "text": "Recently, pandemic viral infections, such as novel H1N1 swine origin influenza A (SOIV) (Medina and Garcia-Sastre, 2011, Kash et al., 2006, Vijaykrishna et al., 2010, Panning et al., 2009), acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) (Kallings, 2008, Gao et al., 1999), foot-and-mouth disease (Yoon et al., 2011), and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) (Smith, 2006, Marra et al., 2003), caused serious human victims and economic loss over the world. To prevent the pandemic and detect fatal pathogens in the early stage, many diagnostic tools have been developed. Microfluidics-based lab-on-a-chip technology (Whitesides, 2006, Chen et al., 2007) has demonstrated its high performance for genetic analysis to address such problems by utilizing the advantages of rapid analysis (Chen et al., 2010a, Chen et al., 2010b), low reagent consumption (Kim et al., 2010), high integration (Hangan et al., 2011), and portability (Liu et al., 2007). Since polymerase chain reaction (PCR) has been considered as a gold standard method for accurate and sensitive genotyping, several types of microdevices have been presented which incorporate a PCR functional unit (Thaitrong et al., 2010, Liu et al., 2011). Easley et al. have reported an integrated microdevice that consists of a solid-phase extraction column for DNA extraction, PCR and capillary electrophoretic (CE) microchannel on a single device to detect B. pertussis from human nasal aspirate (Easley et al., 2006). However, all the processes of the chip operation and fluorescence detection were carried out in the bulky instrumentation which precluded fast and on-site genetic analysis. Beyor et al. showed a lab-on-a-chip system for pathogen detection by combining the functional micro-unit for cell preconcentration, PCR, and CE separation (Beyor et al., 2009). Although they demonstrated high integration and high sensitivity for Escherichia coli O157 identification, the use of laser-induced fluorescence detection requires high-cost and bulky optical laser, and an expertise in genetic analysis is necessary to interpret the CE data. Donhauser et al. presented the stopped PCR combined with chemiluminescence flow-through DNA microarray assay for detecting Escherichia coli O157:H7, Salmonella enterica, and Campylobacter jejuni (Donhauser et al., 2011). They have shown high sensitivity, quantitative analysis, and multiplex detection of pathogenic bacteria, but the PCR step was performed on the off-chip basis which is not suitable for the on-site pathogen detection. Elsholz et al. have proposed an electrical microarray chip for analyzing multiplex PCR products from biowarfare agents (Elsholz et al., 2009). Despite the ability of high-throughput screening and high sensitivity detection of DNA, they also needed a bulky and expensive electrical sensing system, and suffered from a relatively prolonged reaction time. On the other hand, immunochromatographic strip (ICS) technology has been widely adopted for DNA and protein analysis due to its advantages of a user-friendly format, easy interpretation by detecting a colorimetric signal, a short reaction time, a cheap manufacturing, and less environmental influence on the chromatographic separation (Zhang et al., 2006, Xu et al., 2009, Gervais et al., 2011, Peng et al., 2008). Bla\u017ekov\u00e1 et al. have presented a simple and rapid ICS test for visual detection of PCR products which were obtained by amplifying 16S rRNA templates of Cronobacter spp. (Bla\u017ekov\u00e1 et al., 2011). Glynou et al. developed a dry-reagent strip biosensor to identify hepatitis C virus through DNA hybridization by using gold nanoparticle (Au NP) labeled probes (Glynou et al., 2003). However, in both cases, the PCR reaction was conducted by a conventional off-chip PCR method which limits high potential of the ICS technology as a point-of-care testing tool. Previous reports presented a PCR microdevice integrated with a lateral flow strip for pathogen detection (Chen et al., 2010a, Chen et al., 2010b, Wang et al., 2006). However, they utilized up-converting phosphor particles as a reporter which needs an IR laser and a fluorescence reader to scan the lateral flow strip to detect the phosphorescence emission.",

The Au NP linked amplicons passed through the test line where the streptavidin\u2013biotin interaction occurs, while the excess of Au NP labeled anti-hapten antibody was immobilized with the anti-mouse IgG in the control line (Fig. 1B\u2013D).",

Schematics of the assembled microdevice are shown in Fig. 2B. The pneumatic micropump was used to load the RT-PCR cocktail from the sample reservoir to the PCR chamber through a hole. For thermal cycling, a film heater (Minco, Minnesota, USA) covered the PCR chamber at the bottom for heating and a fan, placed above the microdevice, was used for fast cooling. Electrical circuits for temperature control were similar to the previous method (Lagally et al., 2004, Toriello et al., 2006). A constant 10 mA current was applied to the RTD through the outer electrodes, and the resultant voltage was sensed in the inner electrodes. The signal was processed using an active low-pass filter at 5 Hz and then transferred to the DAQ board. A proportional/integral/differential (PID) module within the in-house LabVIEW program outputs through the DAQ board to control the heater power supply. The PCR chamber was connected with two exits through the PDMS microvalve: one is for the waste outlet and the other is for the product outlet. The ICS was attached on the bottom of the RTD wafer, and the product outlet and buffer inlet were positioned onto the conjugate pad and buffer loading pad, respectively.",

A 1.1 mm thick borofloat glass was coated with 200 nm amorphous silicon on both sides, and was primed with hexamethyldisilazane (HMDS). Photoresist (Shipley 1818, Marlborough, MA) was spin-coated at 2500 rpm and soft-baked at 120 \u00b0C for 90 s. The channel pattern was transferred to the coated substrate via UV exposure and developed using Microposit developer (1:1 with deionized water, Shipley). The developed area of amorphous silicon was removed using SF6 reactive ion etching (RIE) and was immersed in a 49% HF solution for isotropic wet etching. The remaining photoresist was stripped using acetone with sonication, and the amorphous silicon was removed with SF6 RIE. To fabricate a RTD electrode, 20 nm Ti and 200 nm Pt were coated on a borofloat glass wafer, and the RTD pattern was covered with a photoresist. A wet etching with an aqua regia (HCl:HNO3\n = 3:1) removed the background of Ti/Pt, and the RTD electrode was finally obtained after cleaning the remaining photoresist with acetone. The channel wafer and the RTD wafer were thermally bonded in a vacuum furnace at 680 \u00b0C for 6 h. The RTD electrode was positioned close to the PCR chamber for accurate temperature measurement. The glass manifold was fabricated by using the same procedure as above and was diced with an automatic dicing saw machine (Disco Corp.). To form the microvalve, a monolithic PDMS membrane was pretreated in a UV-ozone cleaner for 1 min, and then sandwiched between the bonded wafer and the glass manifold. An ICS was attached to the bottom of the RTD wafer by using a scotch tape. The digital image of the integrated RT-PCR-ICS microdevice is shown in Fig. 3A.",

Control board regulated the constant current, the change of the voltage across the RTD sensor, and the heater (Blazej et al., 2006, Liu et al., 2007). The sampling frequency of the voltage was 2 MHz and every 512 samples were averaged on the control board. The diaphragm pump and solenoid valves supplied pressure (4.3 psi) and vacuum (\u22125.8 psi) through a pneumatic line tube to function the PDMS microvalves. The three serial microvalves operated for pneumatic pulsatile on-chip pumping by a LabVIEW program. An external cooling fan was equipped above the integrated microdevice for rapid cooling ramping rate during the PCR thermal cycling, and the thermal cycling temperature was controlled with a PID module.

Biotin was inserted to the DNA strand during the PCR reaction by using the biotin-labeled dUTP, and Texas Red, serving as a hapten, was labeled at the both ends of the RT-PCR amplicons. The ICS consists of the buffer loading zone, the conjugate area, the nitrocellulose membrane which incorporates a test line with streptavidin proteins and a control line with anti-mouse IgG, and an absorbent pad on the polystyrene plate. Once the PCR products were loaded in the conjugate pad, the running buffer was added in the buffer loading pad to make the product move toward the absorbent pad by capillary force. The RT-PCR product was conjugated with Au NP labeled antibodies through the hapten\u2013antibody interaction, and subsequently the biotin of the product was linked with the streptavidins on the test line. Since Au NPs exhibit higher absorption coefficients and scattering cross-sections than the conventional dyes by several orders of magnitude due to strong surface plasmon resonance, Au NP was widely utilized as a reporter for colorimetric detection of biomolecules (Jian and Huang, 2011, Elghanian et al., 1997). Therefore, the presence of target amplicons can be easily recognized by observing the violet color in the test line without any assistance of optical instruments such as IR laser and laser-induced fluorescence detector. The excess of the Au NP labeled antibodies flowed to the control line to be captured on the immobilized anti-mouse IgG. While the control line always showed a violet color as a positive control due to the interaction between the Au NP labeled anti-hapten antibody and the anti-mouse IgG, the test line revealed the same color only when the Au NP labeled amplicons were present. Therefore, the simple colorimetric detection in the test line enables us to identify the target gene expression of influenza A H1N1 virus.",

The assembled microdevice has three functional units such as a pneumatic microvalve and pulsatile micropump for fluidic control, a RT-PCR reaction, and an ICS based colorimetric detection. The glass channel\u2013PDMS\u2013glass manifold hybrid functions as a pneumatic microvalve, and three serial microvalves work as a pulsatile micropump by opening and closing the valve in consecutive order with 300 ms delay which drives 5 \u03bcL of the RT-PCR cocktail in the sample reservoir to the PCR chamber in 3 min without bubble generation. The volume of the PCR chamber was fixed with 2 \u03bcL since it turned out that such a relatively large volume was necessary to give a strong signal on an ICS. For rapid thermal cycling of the RT-PCR, the cooling fan was equipped over the integrated microdevice, and the thermal cycling proceeded with the cooling and heating ramping rate of 5.7 \u00b0C/s and 4.4 \u00b0C/s, respectively. Measured temperature was matched with the set temperature within \u00b10.5 \u00b0C variation through the PID controller. The generated RT-PCR amplicons were loaded to the ICS through the pneumatic micropump. Upon addition of the running buffer, the color change in the test and control lines was observed in 3 min. The disposable ICS which was adherent to the microdevice by a scotch tape was replaced, and the PCR chamber and microfluidic channels were washed with a piranha solution to remove any residual DNA molecules for the next use. The ICS based colorimetric detection allows us to perform the genetic analysis without need for any complicated analytical instrumentation, to interpret the results with ease, and to generate the genetic information with high speed. For portable genetic analysis, a miniaturized hardware including power supplies, a pneumatic pump, solenoid valves, and a control board was constructed, and all the RT-PCR thermal cycling, microvalve actuation, and cooling fan operation were run automatically through the in-house LabVIEW program.

Therefore, we performed the RT-PCR reaction by tuning the ratio of dTTP:biotin\u2013dUTP as 1:0, 2:1, 4:1 and 8:1. Simultaneously, the number of carbon between the dUTP and the biotin was controlled by 11, 16, and 18 to investigate how the spacer length reduces steric hindrance for streptavidin to capture the biotin-labeled amplicons. The RT-PCR reaction and the ICS based colorimetric detection were performed on the off-chip basis. As the spacer length increased from 11 to 18 (Fig. 4A\u2013C), the band signal more clearly appeared, meaning the longer distance of biotin from the backbone of the amplicons makes the conjugation efficiency higher. In all the cases of Fig. 4A\u2013C, the amplicons synthesized by adding dTTP:biotin\u2013dUTP with 2:1 ratio revealed the most distinct band signal. Although the PCR efficiency would be decreased by the presence of biotin\u2013dUTP and the shorter spacer in the biotin\u2013dUTP would be better substrate for the polymerase mediated incorporation into the growing DNA molecule, the biotin\u2013dUTP with longer spacers and high quantity produced the most improved colorimetric signal by the favorable streptavidin\u2013biotin complex formation. Therefore, we further conducted the on-chip RT-PCR reaction for visual identification of influenza A H1N1 virus on the ICS by using the biotin\u2013dUTP with 18 carbon linker, and 2:1 ratio of dTTP:biotin\u2013dUTP in the RT-PCR cocktail.",

After RT-PCR reaction, 1 \u03bcL of the RT-PCR product was loaded on the ICS (Fig. 5\n, top panel) and agarose gel (Fig. 5, bottom panel). While the ICS revealed the violet color signal in the test line even with 17.2 fg of the viral RNA sample, 1.72 pg of RNA was necessary to produce a dim band in the gel electrophoresis, indicating the 100-fold improved detection sensitivity of ICS than the agarose gel. Moreover, the total analysis time of the ICS was within 10 min without any analytical instruments, but the analysis of agarose gel electrophoresis generally takes more than 1 h from the sample loading to UV illumination.",
