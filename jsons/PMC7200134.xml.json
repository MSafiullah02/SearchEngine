On the other hand, immunosuppression itself may dampen the abnormal immune response that seems to be responsible for the most severe disease complications such as interstitial pneumonia [8]. Indeed, two immune-modulating drugs largely used for immune-mediated disorders, hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and chloroquine, have demonstrated some antiviral activity against SARS\u2013CoV-2 in vitro and in small clinical studies [9]. Similarly, tocilizumab \u2013 an anti-interleukin (IL)-6 receptor antibody approved for different rheumatic diseases \u2013 proved effective in severe SARS-CoV-2 cases [10], although these data warrant confirmation by controlled trials.",

Moreover, the lack of nasopharyngeal swab for all (at least symptomatic) patients, and the still ongoing pandemic, with new cases possibly occurring after our evaluation, represent major limitations of this study. Pending the results of further investigations coming from an ongoing international alliance of SARS-CoV-2 cases with rheumatic diseases [15,16], our experience shows that patients with chronic systemic autoimmune diseases do not seem to be at increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection or complications compared with the general population.",
