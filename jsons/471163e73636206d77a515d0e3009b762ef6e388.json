Firstly, 74.8% samples were collected more than 1 week after the onset of the disease. This phenomenon is similar in patients with SARS that the secretion of virus in tears occurs only during the early phase of the disease [5] . Secondly, ocular surface swab samples collected few exfoliated cells which had a low chance of detecting the virus. Finally, the lack of sensitivity of RT-PCR kits may also lead to a low positive rate, which was also an notorious problem in the detection of SARS-CoV [6] .",

The disparate phenomenon might result from the different target genes used between the two studies. Yu Jun et al. obtained negative results when analyzing tear samples collected from Schirmer's test strip for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR and viral isolation [7] . The Schirmer's test strips collect few conjunctival exfoliated cells and secretions which are also potential infectious sources of ocular surface especially when patients rub their eyes.
