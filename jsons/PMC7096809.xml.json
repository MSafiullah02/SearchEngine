Infection with microorganisms now has international repercussions, as seen in the emergence of AIDS, SARS and avian influenza; the spread of antibiotic-resistant malaria, tuberculosis and nosocomial infections; and bioterrorism concerns. A series of papers in recent issues of Science report the complete genome sequences of five important protozoan parasites: two species of Theileria1,2, which cause East Coast fever and theileriosis in cattle, and three members of the phylum Kinetoplastida\u2014Leishmania major3, which leads to skin lesions (and is related to L. donovani, which causes visceral leishmaniasis); Trypanosoma brucei4, which produces sleeping sickness in humans and wasting disease in cattle; and T. cruzi5, the cause of Chagas disease. Comparative study of the genomes of these and other parasites promises to elucidate the biology of many devastating tropical diseases and help identify parasite-specific targets for drug development.",

From this perspective, eukaryotic pathogens pose a more difficult challenge than prokaryotes, as they share many metabolic pathways with humans. For example, macrolides, tetracylines and many other inhibitors of prokaryotic protein synthesis do not inhibit cytoplasmic protein synthesis in eukaryotic parasites (but see below for a surprising twist on this story), and \u03b2-lactam antibiotics\u2014specific inhibitors of bacterial cell-wall synthesis\u2014are not active against eukaryotic pathogens, which lack a cell wall.",

For example, all parasites are purine auxotrophs, and the consequent dependence on salvage pathways underlies the use of allopurinol as a treatment for leishmaniasis (a toxic purine analog). In contrast, most parasites have lost the ability to salvage pyrimidines, relying on de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis\u2014the target of sulfonamides. (Only Cryptoporidium can salvage pyrimidines, as discussed below.) All apicomplexan and kinetoplastid parasites also lack at least some components of the urea cycle, and several (Theileria, Cryptosporidium, trypanosomes) have lost the ability to synthesize heme. Theileria and Toxoplasma are unable to synthesize polyamines, and Cryptosporidium has even eliminated the TCA cycle.",

Antifungal agents already in the clinic (triazole inhibitors of C14\u03b1 sterol demethylase) provide lead compounds against protozoan parasites. Apicomplexan parasites lack the HMG-CoA reductase pathway, but most are capable of synthesizing isoprenoids through the 1-deoxy-D-xylulose 5-phosphate (DOXP) pathway, which is attractive as the target of known herbicides24. Plasmodium, Toxoplasma and all of the kinetoplastids synthesize fatty acids using a type II fatty acyl synthase (FAS) complex, the target of triclosan and other antibiotics23.

The apicoplast has lost all photosynthetic function but is nevertheless essential for parasite survival29 (except in Cryptosporidium, which has lost this organelle, but has retained several plant-like enzymes that may derive from the algal endosymbiont30). Approximately 15% of the P. falciparum genome encodes proteins destined for the apicoplast6, including those involved in producing isoprenoids and fatty acids through the DOXP and FAS-II pathways; in addition, the apicoplast has a crucial role in compartmentalizing heme biosynthesis31. Housekeeping enzymes associated with this organelle are particularly attractive as drug targets, as apicoplast DNA replication, RNA transcription and protein synthesis are all prokaryotic in nature, providing targets for drugs such as ciprofloxacin, rifamycin and clindamycin (used clinically to treat toxoplasmosis)29,31.",
