Currently, more than 600,000 cases have been diagnosed and over 25,000 infected people have died [3]. Patients usually present with fever (>80%), cough (>60%), and myalgia or fatigue (>40%) [1,4]. Males are more commonly affected (\u223c60% of cases) with a median age of approximately 50 years [1,4,5]. The complete spectrum of presentations and complications associated with COVID-19 is not fully elucidated. Clinical manifestations range from asymptomatic or very mild to severe illness, sepsis and death. While the current state of evidence suggests that most COVID-19 illness is mild, the study by Guan et al. suggests severe illness occurs in 16% of cases [4,6]. As the pandemic is still in progression, with an incomplete picture and potential treatments in preliminary stages only, we sought to review the available literature relevant to coagulation disorders in patients infected by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 1 (SARS-CoV-1) and the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) to raise awareness about these potential complications in patients with COVID-19.",

            "text": "Thrombotic complications seem to emerge as an important issue in patients with COVID-19. Preliminary reports on COVID-19 pandemic outcomes have shown that infected patients commonly develop thrombocytopenia (36.2%) and may have elevated D-dimer (46.4%) [4], while these rates are even higher in patients with severe COVID-19 disease (57.7% and 59.6%, respectively) [4]. Emerging data support that patients infected by this novel coronavirus are at risk of developing disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) [4,7,8]. Increased D-dimer and fibrin degradation products levels, and prolonged prothrombin time have been associated with poor prognosis in patients affected by the novel coronavirus [8]. Tang et al. reported that 15 out of 21 non-survivors (8% of the total cohort) developed overt DIC (\u22655 points) according to the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis diagnostic criteria [8]. A meta-analysis by Lippi and colleagues identified significantly lower platelet count in patients with severe disease (mean difference: \u221231 \u00d7 109/L, 95% CI: \u221235 to \u221229 \u00d7 109/L) and thrombocytopenia was associated with fivefold higher odds of having severe disease (OR: 5.13; 95% CI: 1.81\u201314.58) [9]. Lastly, a recent report investigated the prognostic factors of 28-day mortality of severely affected COVID-19 patients and the association between mortality and the administration of low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) for at least seven days. Elevated D-dimer, prolonged prothrombin time and increased age were associated with higher- while higher platelet count was associated with lower 28-day mortality. The use of anticoagulant therapy resulted in lower mortality in patients with sepsis-induced coagulopathy score \u22654 (LMWH: 40.0% vs No-LMWH: 64.2%, p = 0.029), lower mortality in patients with D-dimer over sixfold the upper limit of normal (LMWH: 32.8% vs No-LMWH: 52.4%, P = 0.017), but there was no overall benefit for patients on LMWH (LMWH: 30.3% vs No-LMWH: 29.7%, respectively, p = 0.910) [10].",

Viral infections elicit the systemic inflammatory response and cause an imbalance between procoagulant and anticoagulant homeostatic mechanisms [11]. Multiple pathogenetic mechanisms are involved, including endothelial dysfunction, von Willebrand factor elevation, Toll-like receptor activation, and tissue-factor pathway activation [[11], [12], [13]]. Platelets, upon antigen recognition, become activated and interact with white blood cells to facilitate pathogen clearance through white blood cell activation and clot formation [14]. Platelets are key mediators of inflammation and sensors of infectious agents through the interaction of cell surface receptors and pathogens (pathogen pattern recognition receptors) or immune system derivatives (immunoglobulin Fc receptors and complement receptors). The activation of and the interactions between macrophages, monocytes, endothelial cells, platelets and lymphocytes play a critical role in the procoagulant effect of viral infections [12,15].",

Similarly to COVID-19, SARS-CoV-1 had been associated with thrombotic complications and hematologic manifestations [[19], [20], [21], [22], [23]]. Nicholls et al. reported histological findings compatible with edema and fibrin thrombi within the pulmonary vasculature in a SARS-CoV-1 infected patient [24]. Additionally, thrombi have been identified in pulmonary, bronchial, and small lung veins of postmortem SARS-CoV-1 infected lung autopsies, suggesting a prothrombotic effect of the SARS-CoV-1 virus, mainly affecting the pulmonary vasculature [19,21,25]. A study from Singapore, involving postmortem autopsies of eight confirmed SARS-CoV-1 cases, identified pulmonary embolism in four patients, deep vein thrombosis in three patients, and widespread multi-organ infarcts due to thrombi in two patients [26]. Multiple organ thrombosis, associated with polyangiitis and microcirculation disturbance was also reported in an autopsy study on a 57-year old SARS-CoV-1 patient [27]. In addition, ischemic strokes have been described in five out of 206 patients infected with SARS-CoV-1 in a study by Umapathi et al., while approximately 30% of critically ill patients had venous thromboembolism [20]. SARS-CoV-1 has also been associated with fetal complications (oligohydramnios, intrauterine growth delay, and small fetal size) due to placental circulation dysfunction, mainly attributed to intervillous and subchorionic fibrin deposition, avascular and fibrotic villi formation, and prothrombotic tendency [28].",

Ng et al. reported a SARS-CoV-1 case complicated by overt pulmonary artery thrombosis and associated with prolonged prothrombin time, prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time, elevated D-dimer, and worsening thrombocytopenia [19]. A retrospective analysis of 157 SARS-CoV-1 infected patients revealed the presence of thrombocytopenia (55%) with lowest platelet count at one week after the onset of symptoms, reactive thrombocytosis (49%) with a peak during the third week (median = 17 days), and prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time (63%) over the first two weeks [22]. Similarly, Yang and colleagues reported increased thrombopoietin levels in SARS-CoV-1 patients in the convalescent phase compared to normal controls (290 \u00b1 53 pg/ml vs 228 \u00b1 17 pg/ml, respectively) with a concomitant increase in platelet count [29]. Lee et al. described a cohort of 156 SARS-CoV-1 infected healthcare workers, medical students, and family members (secondary and tertiary cases), and reported high rates of thrombocytopenia on presentation (44.8%), prolonged activated partial-thromboplastin time (42.8%), and elevated D-dimer (45.0%). However, the aforementioned variables were not associated with the composite outcome of intensive care unit admission or death [30]. The clinical value of low platelet count has been assessed in a diagnostic model, which included thrombocytopenia (in addition to myalgia, fever, diarrhea, rhinorrhea/sore throat, and lymphopenia) and effectively detected SARS-CoV-1 with 100% sensitivity and 86.3% specificity [31]. Lastly, SARS-CoV-1 has been associated with the presence of anticardiolipin antibodies in patients with post-SARS osteonecrosis and with positive lupus anticoagulant test in children [32,33].",

In addition, thromboxane synthase (TBXAS) gene and Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) have also been identified as targets of the SARS-CoV-1 [34]. Increased thromboxane production promotes vasoconstriction, platelet aggregation, and endothelial dysfunction [35,36]. The TLR9 receptor is expressed in platelets and \u2013 upon ligand binding \u2013 promotes platelet activation, degranulation, and aggregation through the Interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase 1 (IRAK1) and protein kinase B (Akt/PKB) pathways [37].",

TFPI2 inactivates the tissue factor-VIIa complex and thrombin generation, but its expression upregulation most probably corresponds to a counteractive mechanism that inhibits overt coagulation cascade activation in response to inflammation [38,39].
