            "text": "Coronaviruses, which are enveloped, single-stranded, positive-sense RNA viruses belonging to the subfamily Coronavirinae in the family Coronaviridae, primarily cause respiratory and enteric diseases in mammals and birds [1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9]. The genus is subdivided into three main groups (alpha, beta, and gamma) based on the genetic and serological properties of each virus [10], [11], [12], [13]. Most coronaviruses in the three groups infect animals or birds only. Of the viruses that infect human hosts, human coronavirus (HCoV)-229E and HCoV-OC43, both alphacoronaviruses, are the best characterized and are responsible for most non-rhinovirus-induced cases of the common cold [14]. Other respiratory pathogens in the coronavirus genera that have recently been characterized include the alpha virus HCoV-NL63 and the beta virus HCoV-HKU1. Those two viruses tend to be isolated from young patients, patients of advanced age, and immunocommpromised hosts [13], [15], [16]. Recently, however, more virulent strains have emerged, including severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV), a betacoronovirus that was responsible for the outbreak of SARS in Asia and other countries in 2002\u20132003, and a novel HCoV, 2c EMC2012, which was identified as the causative agent of rapidly progressive acute respiratory infection in two men from the Middle East in 2012 [17], [18], [19].",

The genome of most coronaviruses encodes two replicases, expressed in the form of two polyproteins, open reading frame (ORF)1a, measuring approximately 450 kDa, and ORF1ab, measuring approximately 750 kDa. These polyproteins are processed into a number of non-structural (NS) proteins and four structural proteins, namely spike (S) protein, envelope (E) protein, membrane (M) protein, and nucleocapsid (N) protein (Fig. 1\n) [3], [27]. ORF1a and ORF1ab are predecessors of NS proteins, being cleaved by papain-like protease (PLpro, nsp3) and 3C-like protease (3CLpro, nsp5) to generate the final NS proteins [28], [29]. Some members of betacoronavirus subgroup A also code for a shorter spike-like protein called hemagglutinin esterase [30], [31], [32]. Studies have shown that, at least in SARS-CoV, a receptor-binding domain on the S protein mediates the attachment of said virus to its cellular receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) [33], [34]. Lin et al found that HCoV-NL63 also makes use of the S protein-ACE2 mechanism for cell entry [35].",

Other phylogenetic trees that have been constructed in our laboratory have revealed that 53% of the ORF1ab sequences, 33% of the envelope protein sequences, 45% of the nucleocapsid protein sequences, 34% of the spike protein sequences, and 41% of the membrane protein sequences in SARS-CoV are conserved in human betacoronavirus 2c EMC2012, indicating that SARS-CoV and betacoronavirus 2c EMC2012 are very similar (Fig. 2\n) [36], [37], [38], [39].",

In addition to causing respiratory symptoms, chills, headache, muscle ache, and fever, infection with SARS-CoV has been shown to result in severe diffuse pneumonia, pulmonary fibrosis, and in the most severe cases, death. Pathological examinations of specimens taken from patients with SARS-related acute lung injury, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and pulmonary fibrosis show bronchial epithelial cell exfoliation, cilia loss, multinucleated syncytia cells, squamous epithelial tissue deformation, and increased levels of immune response cells in lung tissue [49], [50]. In addition, clinical laboratory tests have shown that patients with SARS often present with thrombocytopenia and leukopenia [51], [52] as well as overexpression of serum inflammatory cytokines, including interferon (IFN)-\u03b3, interleukin (IL)-18, transforming growth factor (TGF)-\u03b21, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1, and IL-6 [50], [53].",

For example, the nucleocapsid of the SARS-CoV virion has been shown to induce the expression of plasminogen activator-1 via a Smad3-dependent induction of TGF-\u03b21 expression [70], [71], [72], where Smad3 is an intracellular protein that transduces extracellular signals from TGF-\u03b2 ligands to the nucleus, where they activate downstream TGF-\u03b2 gene transcription. Nuclepcapsid protein was also identified as antagonizing IFN-\u03b2 [73]. Furthermore, baculovirus-synthesized SARS-CoV spike protein has been shown to induce activator protein-1 (AP-1) and IL-8 upregulation by activating mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) in lung cells [74]. Moreover, it was found that spike protein induces innate immune response through the activation of the nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-\u03baB) pathway [75]. In addition, Law et al found that SARS-CoV NSP1 induces CCL5, CXVL10, and CCL3 mRNA expression via the activation of NF-\u03baB [76]. The 3a DNA vaccine is reported to stimulate IFN-\u03b3 production mainly by stimulating the production of CD8+ T cells, and IL-2 mainly by stimulating the production of CD4+ T cells [77]. Overall, structural and NS proteins and also SARS genomes are demonstrated to interfere with cell immunity.",

PLpro recognizes the amino acid fragments of LNGG and cleaves polyprotein replicase 1a at NS1/2, NS2/3, and NS3/4 boundaries, resulting in a mature viral protein [29], [78]. In a cell model of SARS-CoV infection, Speigal et al showed that PLpro de-ubiquitinating/de-ISGylating activity was associated with the inhibition of type I IFN expression [79]. Other studies have demonstrated that PLpro inhibits polyI:C-induced activation of IFN-\u03b2, NF-\u03baB, and IFN-stimulated response element by blocking the export of phosphorylated regulatory factor 3 into the nucleus, thereby preventing the biosynthesis of type I IFN [80], [81]. In addition, Li et al showed that elevated levels of PLpro result in an attenuation of type I IFN-induced activation of the IFN-stimulated response element and AP-1, and that PLpro downregulates ERK1 (MAPK3) by upregulating the ubiquitin\u2013proteasome system and suppressing the interaction between ERK1 and STAT1, resulting in type I IFN antagonism of SARS-CoV PLpro [82]. Furthermore, PLpro has been shown to induce TGF-\u03b21, IL-1\u03b1, and CCL5 expression as well as triggering TGF-\u03b21 production via ubiquitin proteasome-, p38 MAPK-, and ERK1/2-mediated signaling [46]. Therefore, it appears that PLpro plays an important role in the maturation process of SARS-CoV and in avoiding detection by the innate immune response system.",

Moreover, phylogenetic tree analyses have shown that human betacoronavirus 2c EMC2012 and SARS-CoV have a similar ORF1ab subgenome (Fig. 2).

Since the first two HCoVs, HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, were identified and studied extensively from the 1960s to 1980s, SARS-CoV has caused a mortality rate >10% globally in 2003 [14], [45]. HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 were identified in 2004 and 2005 [13], [15], [16]. Since then, a novel coronavirus, human betacoronavirus 2c EMC2012, appeared in Saudi Arabia in April 2012, that has so far infected nine people and resulted in five deaths [92]. In the phylogenetic trees constructed with ORF1ab, E, N, S, and M, human betacoronavirus 2c EMC2012, has shown high similarities with SARS-CoV. All of these facts prove that novel coronaviruses have appeared in recent years and are becoming more severe, causing high mortality in humans.",
