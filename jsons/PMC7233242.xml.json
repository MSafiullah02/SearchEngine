The socioeconomic and health care impacts of this pandemic are unprecedented, with worldwide economic loss, travel restrictions, closure of business activities, social distancing, isolation and quarantine, fear of shortage of basic needs, and rapid spread of mental health problems 1, 2, 3. The unpredictable nature of COVID-19 and its associated individual, societal, and global repercussions not only threaten one's physical health but also affects their mental health. Data from a cross-sectional study in China revealed that more than half of the surveyed participants experienced moderate-to-severe psychological distress secondary to the outbreak 4. The distress stems from the constant fear of contracting the virus, contracting it, losing loved ones to the illness, and being socially isolated or quarantined. These factors can precipitate mental illness in those with no previous psychiatric history or exacerbate symptoms in those with a pre-existing mental illness 5.",

During the severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (SARS) outbreak, which occurred between 2002 and 2004, a mental health toll particularly affected the geriatric population. A case study conducted in Hong Kong in 2003 attributed 22 suicide events to be \u201cSARS-related\u201d, with the mean age of attempters being 74.9 years. Disease burden among the elderly with long-term illness contributed as a significant factor for suicide 8. Another cross-sectional study, also conducted in Hong Kong, showed an increase in suicide rates in older adults during the year of the outbreak; this was particularly significant in females above the age of 65 years 9. A lingering elevation in rates of elderly suicide was observed until 2004 10.",

            "text": "This comes on top of a general lack of services directed towards geriatric mental health in the Arab region. Looking at the status of different countries, one can cluster them into three main categories. Some nations have limited exposure to geriatric psychiatry, such as Algeria, Libya, Sudan, and Syria. For instance, Sudan has no geriatricians or geriatric mental health clinics; most of the limited psychiatric services are restricted to the capital and major cities. Similarly, in Syria, geriatric medicine remains a foreign discipline taught along with the endocrinology and nutritional disorders module of medical schools. Other nations have some resources for geriatric medicine, but minimally available expertise. These include Jordan, Lebanon, Morocco, Oman, KSA, and Tunisia. Jordan and Lebanon each have less than ten geriatricians and Lebanon recently acquired its first geriatric psychiatrist. In Morocco, geriatrics became a field of study for medical school graduates a few years ago and geriatric psychiatry is currently part of the curriculum of trainees. Oman is starting to witness a rise in the field, with newly established geriatric psychiatry clinics in two tertiary hospitals, run by five geriatric psychiatrists. The Oman Al Zahimer Association for dementia has also been providing support for patients with dementia and their caregivers throughout the country. In comparison, while there are no clinics dedicated to psychogeriatrics in Tunisia, except for some specialized units in dementia, a university diploma and a research unit exist at the faculty of medicine of Monastir in the center of the country. Geriatric psychiatry services also remain limited in the UAE. Lastly, very few nations have developed extensive resources and services allocated to geriatric psychiatry. In Egypt, most of the psychiatry departments already have or are currently establishing their psychogeriatric section with outpatient clinics and memory clinics. Geriatric psychiatry is currently one of the requirements in many of those training programs. The Egyptian Alzheimer Society has been leading the field and spreading awareness for years now. Alternatively, geriatric psychiatric services in Qatar are provided through different models, including outpatient clinics, specialized memory clinics, consultations on the medical floors of general hospitals, and via residential and home visits for people who cannot reach out. The service has been growing significantly in recent years, particularly following the launching of Qatar National Dementia Plan 2018-\u200b2022 and plans for \u2018Healthy Ageing\u2019 in the country 30\n,\n31.

These include follow-up on patients via videoconference or phone calls. Most generated educational material in the form of videos, posters, or pamphlets released on social media outlets. Many nations also introduced hotline numbers to provide counseling and support. These measures, mostly directed towards the general population, have failed to cater to the needs of the geriatric population. Targeted interventions have been initiated only in countries with good resources and expertise in the field. In Egypt, the General Secretariat for Mental Health and Addiction Treatment launched social media campaigns tackling stress during the outbreak, with a focus on vulnerable populations, including the older adults. In KSA, alternatively, the National Center for Mental Health Promotion has been providing daily support for older adults and their caregivers, via communication at a hotline number and targeted learning material released on social media outlets. In Qatar, geriatric mental health services have shifted to telepsychiatry. Lastly, Jordan and Oman have initiated a home delivery system of psychotropics for the geriatric population.

In this part of the world, changing family dynamics secondary to labor opportunities have caused a shift in family structures, with grandparents more commonly taking care of grandchildren, while parents work abroad. Should grandparents become infected or succumb to the illness, the implications on their extended families will be profound 11. Second, self-isolation during the COVID-19 outbreak can severely affect older adults, whose only social contact is out-of-the home, such as at community centers and places of worship. Also, increasing numbers of the elderly in the low- and middle-income countries are being cared for in nursing homes, which often are unregulated and have limited services 62. Those who attend nursing homes and lost face-to-face contact with their family members, those who do not have spouses, family, or friends, and those who rely on the support of voluntary services or social care, are all equally affected 63\n,\n64. Since many healthcare systems of the MENA region face severe limitations and are unlikely able to provide the needed care for all COVID-19 patients, a disproportionate number of those are expected to be older. Further marginalization of the geriatric population would ensue 11. Subsequently, self-isolation among the elderly would become associated with considerable morbidity and mortality secondary to cardiovascular and neurocognitive complications 65 and mental health problems 65\n,\n66.",

Similarly, the international dementia experts and Alzheimer's Disease International called for urgent support for people living with dementia and their supporters 67. Besides, the role played by older adults in developing and maintaining strategies for disaster preparedness, response, and recovery has previously shown to be efficacious 68. In the Arab countries of the MENA region, guidance around this issue remains, however, unaddressed. An age perspective should be included in the development of any national or regional planning for COVID-19, with recommendations targeting the needs of older adults. As an attempt to invite healthcare workers, policymakers, and stakeholders to look further into the needs of this population, we provide a comprehensive list of recommendations (Table 3\n) that aim to enhance the general status of geriatric mental health in the Arab region, and particularly during the COVID-19 outbreak. In the short-term, the focus should be on raising awareness about the importance of mental health in the geriatric population and providing appropriate resources for the elderly (whether by giving focused training to primary and mental health physicians or via employing innovative tools such as telepsychiatry and hotlines). Treatment measures should follow a multidisciplinary approach within a collaborative care model. Long-term recommendations should target improving geriatric medical training and allocating funds for the specific needs of older adults.",
