Of the 2 million people who acquire bacterial infections in US hospitals each year, 70% of cases now involve strains that are resistant to at least one drug [1]. A major cause for concern in the UK is methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), which was at low levels a decade ago but now accounts for ca. 50% of all S. aureus isolates [2]. Substantial investment and research in the field of anti-infectives are now desperately needed if a public health crisis is to be averted.",

It is not surprising then, that in response to antimicrobial resistance, major pharmaceutical companies have tended to concentrate their efforts on improving antimicrobial agents in established classes [6]. However, with the portfolio of chemotherapeutics currently available, it has been acknowledged that researchers are getting close to the end game in terms of parent structure alterations. A call has therefore been made for the development of new classes of drug that work on different target sites to those in current use [7], [8].",

In the past, potent enzyme inhibitors have been successfully designed and synthesised but they had only modest antibacterial activity, probably owing to the complex issue of drug uptake by cells. Broad empirical screening of chemical entities for antimicrobial activity represents an alternative strategy for the development of novel drugs. Natural products have been a particularly rich source of anti-infective agents, yielding, for example, the penicillins in 1940, the tetracyclines in 1948 and the glycopeptides in 1955 [9]. The following review will examine the antimicrobial activity of flavonoids, a class of natural products possessing a diverse range of pharmacological properties. Compounds with antifungal, antiviral and antibacterial activity will each be discussed in turn, with particular emphasis on those flavonoids with antibacterial activity.",

Flavonoids can be classified according to biosynthetic origin. Some classes, for example chalcones, flavanones, flavan-3-ols and flavan-3,4-diols, are both intermediates in biosynthesis as well as end products that can accumulate in plant tissues. Other classes are only known as end products of biosynthesis, for example anthocyanidins, proanthocyanidins, flavones and flavonols. Two additional classes of flavonoid are those in which the 2-phenyl side chain of flavanone isomerises to the 3 position, giving rise to isoflavones and related isoflavonoids. The neoflavonoid is formed through further isomerisation to the 4 position [13]. Structures of the major classes of flavonoids are given in Fig. 2\n. The structures of specific compounds within these classes that possess antimicrobial activity and that are discussed in the present review are summarised in Table 1\n.",

For a group of compounds of relatively homogeneous structure, the flavonoids inhibit a perplexing number and variety of eukaryotic enzymes and have a tremendously wide range of activities. In the case of enzyme inhibition, this has been postulated to be due to the interaction of enzymes with different parts of the flavonoid molecule, e.g. carbohydrate, phenyl ring, phenol and benzopyrone ring [10]. Several reviews have been written on the interaction between flavonoids and mammalian cells, including comprehensive articles by Harborne and Williams [15] and Middleton et al. [20].

For example, the plant Tagetes minuta (containing quercetagetin-7-arabinosyl-galactoside) has been used extensively in Argentine folk medicine to treat infectious disease [22]. The healing properties of propolis (or \u2018tzori\u2019 in Hebrew) are referred to throughout the Old Testament [23], and this balm was prescribed by Hippocrates (460\u2013377 BC) in Ancient Greece for the treatment of sores and ulcers [24]. The antimicrobial properties of propolis have been attributed to its high flavonoid content and in particular the presence of the flavonoids galangin and pinocembrin [12], [25], [26], [27]. Huang-chin (Scutellaria baicalensis) is yet another example. This herbal medicine has been used systemically and topically for thousands of years in China for the treatment of periodontal abscesses and infected oral wounds. The flavone baicalein is reported to be largely responsible for this plant's antimicrobial effects [28].",

            "text": "A recent area of research that is of particular interest is the apparent inhibitory activity of some flavonoids against human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). To date, most if not all investigations have involved work with the pandemic HIV-1 strain and its enzymes. In vitro studies have shown that baicalin inhibits HIV-1 infection and replication. Inhibition of HIV-1 entry into cells expressing CD4 and chemokine co-receptors [36], and antagonism of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase [37] by the flavone O-glycoside have been demonstrated by Li and colleagues. Baicalein [38], robustaflavone and hinokiflavone [39] have also been shown to inhibit HIV-1 reverse transcriptase, as have several catechins, but catechins inhibit other DNA polymerases and their interaction with the HIV-1 enzyme is therefore thought to be non-specific in nature [40]. In addition, it has been demonstrated that several flavonoids, including demethylated gardenin A and 3,2\u2032-dihydroxyflavone, inhibit HIV-1 proteinase [41]. Robinetin, myricetin, baicalein, quercetagetin [42] and quercetin 3-O-(2\u2033-galloyl)-\u03b1-l-arabinopyranoside [43] inhibit HIV-1 integrase, although there are concerns that HIV enzyme inhibition by quercetagetin and myricetin is non-specific [44]. It has also been reported that the flavonoids chrysin, acacetin and apigenin prevent HIV-1 activation via a novel mechanism that probably involves inhibition of viral transcription [45]. Interestingly, in a study by Hu and colleagues, chrysin was reported to have the highest therapeutic index of 21 natural and 13 synthetic flavonoids against HIV-1 [46]. Several research groups have investigated the relationship between flavonoid structure and inhibitory activity against HIV-1 and its enzymes [39], [41], [42], [44], [46]. Furthermore, at least two groups have proposed mechanisms of action for HIV-1 enzyme inhibition [41], [42].",

It has also been demonstrated that two of the flavonoids found in propolis, chrysin and kaempferol, inhibit viral replication of HSV, human coronavirus and rotavirus [50]. More recently, the flavonol galangin has been reported to have significant antiviral activity against HSV and coxsackie B virus [51].",

Examples of these include epicatechin gallate [122], [123], [124], [125] and sophoraflavanone G [83], [84]. At least one group has demonstrated synergy between flavonoids with antibacterial activity [126]. Others have synthetically modified natural flavones and analysed them for antibacterial activity [94], [127], [128], [129], [130], [131]. For example, Wang and colleagues have complexed 5-hydroxy-7,4\u2032-dimethoxyflavone with a number of transition metals and shown that this process increases antibacterial activity [130]. Another group reported increased antibacterial activity of 3-methyleneflavanones when the B ring contained bromine or chlorine substituents [131]. Two research groups have described the use of flavonoids in vivo. In a study by Vijaya and Ananthan, oral administration of either 142.9 mg/kg quercetin or 214.3 mg/kg quercetrin protected guinea pigs against an induced Shigella infection that killed untreated control animals [132]. More recently, Dastidar and co-workers reported that intraperitoneal injection of either 1.58 mg/kg sophoraisoflavone A or 3.16 mg/kg 6,8-diprenylgenistein gave significant protection to mice challenged with \u223c9.5 \u00d7 108 colony-forming units (CFUs) of Salmonella typhimurium\n[110].",

        {
            "text": "When reports of the antibacterial activity of flavonoids are compared, the results appear widely conflicting (Table 2\n). For example, it was published that apigenin had no activity against S. aureus at concentrations up to 128 \u03bcg/mL [72]; a separate study in the same year reported that the flavone inhibited the growth of 15 strains of MRSA and 5 sensitive strains of S. aureus at concentrations between 3.9 \u03bcg/mL and 15.6 \u03bcg/mL [73]. From Table 2 it can be seen that such discrepancies could perhaps be attributed on occasion to different assays being used (e.g. [65], [70] and [72], [73]). Many different assays are employed in flavonoid research, including the agar dilution technique [29], the paper disk diffusion assay [115], the hole-plate diffusion method [22], the cylinder diffusion method [60], the broth macrodilution technique [71] and the broth microdilution technique [134]. In particular, assays relying on diffusion of test flavonoids may not give a reliable quantitative measure of antibacterial activity because a potent antibacterial flavonoid may have a low rate of diffusion [32]. However, it is clear from Table 2 that additional factors are involved in causing these discrepancies because even groups using the same assay are obtaining conflicting results (e.g. [67], [96] and [67], [72]). Such inconsistencies may be due to variations within each assay. For example, different groups using the agar dilution technique have used different sizes of bacterial inoculum [81], [86]. In a report by the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS), inoculum size was considered the single most important variable in susceptibility testing [135]. It should be noted that many groups assaying flavonoid antibacterial activity have not quantified the test bacterial suspension [60], [115] and others have not even standardised the size of their unenumerated inocula [35], [56], [76], [90], [97]. From the published work it is clear that, in addition to inoculum size, there are many other variable factors for each type of assay. These include volume of broth or agar [90], [116], type of broth or agar [86], [92], size of wells [56], [60], size of paper disks [57], [65], strains of a particular bacterial species used [69], [72] and incubation period [90], [116]. Recently, a set of guidelines was published for standard agar dilution, broth macrodilution and broth microdilution methods [136]. This may help to reduce the number of conflicting reports of flavonoid antibacterial activity in the future. However, it will remain necessary to consider carefully additional variables such as the solvent used to dissolve test flavonoids [116], [118]. It has previously been shown that precipitation occurs when selected flavonoids are dissolved in organic solvents and diluted with neutral polar solutions [75]. Precipitation of flavonoids in a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) assay is likely to cause diminished contact between bacterial cells and flavonoid molecules and may lead to false negative reports of antibacterial activity. Also, in improperly controlled experiments, flavonoid precipitation could be misinterpreted as bacterial growth and further false negative results may be recorded as a consequence. The structural alteration of flavonoids such as galangin in alkaline solvents is another matter for consideration [75]. If flavonoid salts are formed and these have increased or decreased potency compared with the parent structure, this may lead to false positive/negative reports of antibacterial activity. Other variables worth noting include whether the test flavonoids are obtained from a commercial or natural source [35], [74] and which companies [74], [75]/natural products [71], [72] the compounds are from.",

Although there have been comparatively few studies into the mechanisms underlying flavonoid antibacterial activity, information from published literature indicates that different compounds within this class of phytochemicals may target different components and functions of the bacterial cell [137], [138], [139]. If this is the case, it is surprising that the small number of groups which have investigated the relationship between flavonoid structure and antibacterial activity (summarised below) have been able to identify common structural features among active compounds. However, it may be that individual antibacterial flavonoids have multiple cellular targets, rather than one specific site of action. Alternatively, these common structural features may simply be necessary for flavonoids to gain proximity to or uptake into the bacterial cell.",

It was also reported by Osawa and colleagues that 5-hydroxyflavones and 5-hydroxyisoflavones with additional hydroxyl groups at the 7 and 4\u2032 positions did not exhibit this inhibitory activity [115]. However, when Sato et al. examined two isoflavones with hydroxyl groups at the 5, 2\u2032 and 4\u2032 positions using an agar dilution assay, intensive inhibitory activity was detected against a wide range of streptococcal species [107]. This may suggest that hydroxylation at position 2\u2032 is important for activity. Alternatively, the lack of activity detected by Osawa et al. may simply be due to the poor diffusion of flavones and isoflavones (compared with flavanones and isoflavanones) through the medium.",

The importance of hydroxylation at the 2\u2032 position for antibacterial activity of chalcones is supported by earlier work from Sato and colleagues, who found that 2,4,2\u2032-trihydroxy-5\u2032-methylchalcone and 2,4,2\u2032-trihydroxychalcone inhibited the growth of 15 strains of cariogenic streptococci [140].",

Substitution of the B ring was found to enhance antibacterial activity, with 3\u2032-chloro, 4\u2032-chloro and 4\u2032-bromo analogues each being approximately twice as effective as their parent compound against S. aureus, and four times more active against Enterococcus faecalis. Also, the 2\u2032,4\u2032-dichloro derivative exhibited a four- to eight-fold improvement in activity against S. aureus and a two- to four-fold improvement against E. faecalis. By contrast, 3-methylene-6-bromoflavanone was less potent than the parent compound and the authors suggested that halogenation of the A ring may diminish activity [131]. Clearly, however, it would be necessary to prepare analogues with substitution at other A-ring positions before this could be said with any certainty. In chalcones, neither fluorination nor chlorination at position 4 of the B ring is reported to affect antibacterial potency significantly [104]. Again, however, other structural analogues of this class of flavonoids would need to be synthesised and examined before the effect of halogenation upon antibacterial activity could be properly assessed.",

If this phenomenon is induced by other compounds within the flavonoid class (and liposomal studies suggest that this is the case for epigallocatechin gallate [88]), questions are raised regarding the interpretation of results from time\u2013kill studies.

Enzyme binding was demonstrated by isolating E. coli DNA gyrase and measuring quercetin fluorescence in the presence and absence of the gyrase subunits. The flavonoid-binding site was postulated to overlap with those of ATP and novobiocin, since addition of these compounds interfered with quercetin fluorescence. Inhibition of GyrB ATPase activity by quercetin was also demonstrated in a coupled ATPase assay. This research is in agreement with the earlier findings of Ohemeng et al.

At concentrations corresponding to the MIC values, sophoraflavanone G was shown to increase fluorescence polarisation of the liposomes significantly. These increases indicated an alteration of membrane fluidity in hydrophilic and hydrophobic regions, suggesting that sophoraflavanone G reduced the fluidity of outer and inner layers of membranes. Naringenin also exhibited a membrane effect but at much higher concentrations.

Catechins are a group of flavonoids that appear to have greater activity against Gram-positive than Gram-negative bacteria [88]. In this study, liposomes were again used as model bacterial membranes, and it was shown that epigallocatechin gallate induced leakage of small molecules from the intraliposomal space. Aggregation was also noted in liposomes treated with the compound. The group therefore concluded that catechins primarily act on and damage bacterial membranes. It was not known how this damage occurred but two theories were put forward. First, catechins may perturb the lipid bilayers by directly penetrating them and disrupting the barrier function. Alternatively, catechins may cause membrane fusion, a process that results in leakage of intramembranous materials and aggregation. Interestingly, the group also demonstrated that leakage induced by epigallocatechin gallate was significantly lower when liposome membranes were prepared containing negatively charged lipids. It was therefore suggested that the low catechin susceptibility of Gram-negative bacteria may be at least partially attributable to the presence of lipopolysaccharide acting as a barrier [88].",

The electrochemical gradient of protons across the membrane is essential for bacteria to maintain capacity for ATP synthesis, membrane transport and motility. Mirzoeva et al. suggested that the effect of propolis on membrane permeability and membrane potential may contribute enormously to its overall antibacterial activity and may decrease the resistance of cells to other antibacterial agents. It was thought that this might explain the synergistic effect that occurs between propolis and other antibiotics such as tetracycline [148] and ampicillin [149]. The group also demonstrated that the flavonoids quercetin and naringenin significantly inhibited bacterial motility, providing further evidence that the proton motive force is disrupted. Bacterial motility and chemotaxis are thought to be important in virulence as they guide bacteria to their sites of adherence and invasion. Mirzoeva et al. suggested that the antimotility action of propolis components may have an important role in inhibition of bacterial pathogenesis and the development of infection [148]. The cytoplasmic membrane activity detected for quercetin by Mirzoeva and co-workers may represent one of the additional mechanisms of antibacterial action that was suspected to be present among the seven DNA gyrase-inhibiting flavonoid compounds tested by Ohemeng and colleagues [68].",

Interestingly, the licochalcones were found to inhibit strongly oxygen consumption in M. luteus and S. aureus but not in E. coli, which correlated well with the observed spectrum of antibacterial activity. The group further demonstrated that licochalcones A and C effectively inhibited NADH-cytochrome c reductase, but not cytochrome c oxidase or NADH-CoQ reductase.

However, new classes of antimicrobial drug are urgently required and the flavonoids represent a novel set of leads. Future optimisation of these compounds through structural alteration may allow the development of a pharmacologically acceptable antimicrobial agent or group of agents. Existing structure\u2013activity data suggest that it might be possible, for example, to prepare a potent antibacterial flavanone by synthesising a compound with halogenation of the B ring as well as lavandulyl or geranyl substitution of the A ring. Also, it is worth noting that the rapid progress which is being made toward elucidation of flavonoid biosynthetic pathways [151] may soon allow the production of structural analogues of active flavonoids through genetic manipulation. Screening of these analogues might lead to the identification of compounds that are sufficiently potent to be useful as antifungal, antiviral or antibacterial chemotherapeutics. In addition to the structural alteration of weak and moderately active antimicrobial flavonoids, investigation into the mechanisms of action of these compounds is likely to be a productive area of research. Such information may assist in the optimisation of a lead compound's activity, provide a focus for toxicological attention and aid in the anticipation of resistance. Also, characterisation of the interaction between antimicrobial flavonoids and their target sites could potentially allow the design of second-generation inhibitors.",
