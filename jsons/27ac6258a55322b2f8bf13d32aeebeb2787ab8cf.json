COVID-19 is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2-), and SARS COV2 is now known to be one of the viruses that infect humans and have human-to-human transmission. Furthermore, the virus has a similar mechanism of causing disease as other coronaviruses and has the potential to cause multiorgan damage (i.e., lung, heart, liver, and kidney) and, in particular, to cause pneumonia (Yan et al., 2020) . During the last 20 years, several epidemics have been associated with viruses, including SARS COV, H1N1 influenza and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). All of these epidemics placed a large burden on several countries (Cascella et al., 2020) .",

This committee includes 19 ministries and authorities. It is called the \"COVID-19 follow-up committee\" and is led by the minister of health (SPA, 2020a). 2) The second action was to suspend entry to Saudi Arabia for Umrah and visiting the holy mosque in Makkah or the holy mosque in Almadinah (Al-Tawfiq and Memish, 2020) . 3) The third action involved holding issuing visas to those coming from countries that had already been affected by COVID-19 and in which an epidemic situation existed (SPA, 2020b), as cases began to occur in neighboring countries, especially among the Gulf countries (especially Bahrain and Kuwait) for which a visa is not required to enter Saudi Arabia (SPA, 2020c), 4) The government barred citizens of the Gulf countries from entering the two holy cities (Makkah and Almadinah). Furthermore, due to the increase in the number of COVID-19 cases among Gulf countries and because most of these cases occurred due to travel to Iran, which was an epidemic area with thousands of cases (SPA, 2020d, 2020e), 5) the citizens of these countries were not allowed to enter Saudi Arabia with their national ID but only with their passport to ensure that they had not visited Iran in the previous 2 weeks.",

Since the disease has no treatment, prevention is the best method to stop the spread of the virus (SPA, 2020g); therefore, 9) massive campaigns were conducted by the Ministry of Health (MoH) and other agencies to educate the public on ways to prevent the spread of the virus(SPA, 2020h).

This was one of the advantages of the Saudi health system in fighting the COVID-19 pandemic. The Ministry of Health has also prepared plans to ensure that all medical products, including personal protective equipment, diagnostic agents, ventilators and medications, are available and sufficient for this crisis. All these restrictions and precautions played a major role in limiting the spread of SARS-CoV-2, and as of April 8 th , 2020, there were 2932 cases, 631 cured and 41 dead. The number of deaths was not very high compared to other countries, which might be due to good care in hospitals in Saudi Arabia. However, number of COVID-19 cases has increased because of the active surveillance program that the Saudi MOH has started to test different areas in Saudi Arabia. As of May 11 th , 2020, there were 27,345 active cases, 11,457 cured and 246 death (MOH, 2020e). Nevertheless, the fatality rate is considered from the lowest rate worldwide. All ministries and authorities in Saudi have taken responsibility to fight the virus through a variety of actions. Initially, more than 120 billion Saudi riyal \"SR\" (US $1 = 3.75 SR) was provided by the government to address harm from COVID-19 and to fight the virus (SPA, 2020z). Recently, the MoH received funds of 7 billion SR, and 8 billion SR was provided earlier from the government's 15 billion SR (MOH, 2020f). On April15 th , King Salman has also ordered 47 billion SR for the MoH as additional fund to help them against COVID-19. He also ordered to fund 50 billion SR for private companies to reimburse them (U. A.-Q. News, 2020). On April 26 th , 2020, King Salman ordered the King Salman Humanitarian Aid and Relief Center to sign contracts with Chinas, USA, Switzerland and South Korea to fight COVID1-9. These contracts have several purposes, the Chinese government will send 500 experts to help with the testing and utilize them as consultants.",
