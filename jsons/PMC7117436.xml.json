            "text": "Arteriviruses are a family of animal viruses that includes the prototypic equine arteritis virus (EAV) and porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV). Whereas outbreaks of equine viral arteritis (EVA) are only occasionally reported, infections with PRRSV pose a major threat to swine-farming industries worldwide. Especially the emergence of highly virulent strains of PRRSV in China since 2006 has been a major concern (Zhou and Yang, 2010). Although current vaccine-based control strategies for EAV are considered adequate, some concerns regarding efficacy (i.e. limited cross protection) and safety (i.e. shedding of vaccine virus) provide room for improvement (Balasuriya et al., 2013, McCollum et al., 1987). In contrast, whereas currently available vaccines against PRRSV generally provide protection against clinical disease, they do not consistently prevent replication of field strains and shedding of infectious virus, and especially the limited protection against heterologous field strains is a major issue (Kimman et al., 2009). The design of (novel) PRRSV vaccines that provide improved protection against both homologous and heterologous field strains is therefore of significant importance.",

One of the arterivirus protein domains that have been suggested to be involved in downregulating the innate immune response is papain-like protease 2 (PLP2) (Frias-Staheli et al., 2007, Sun et al., 2010, van Kasteren et al., 2012), which functions both as a deubiquitinase (DUB) and plays an essential role in the autoproteolytic maturation of the viral replicase polyproteins. Importantly, we have recently been able to show that the DUB activity of EAV PLP2 inhibits the innate immune response in infected cells, via the structure-based design of a viable mutant virus lacking this activity (van Kasteren et al., 2013). The aim of the current study was to determine in vivo whether this DUB-negative virus provides better protection against subsequent challenge infection than its parental DUB-competent counterpart. Since to date the separation of DUB and polyprotein processing functions of arterivirus PLP2 has only been successful for EAV, we have used this virus for the present animal study.",

The PLP2-encoding region was subsequently PCR amplified using Pfu DNA polymerase (Fermentas) and sequenced. After vaccination, viral RNA present in the blood of four horses from each of the vaccinated groups at 4 days post vaccination was subjected to sequencing. This was done essentially as described above with the exception that the RT reaction on whole blood total RNA (see below) was performed using a primer that recognizes the EAV genome and thus specifically converts the limited amount of viral RNA present in the samples to cDNA.

In order to assess whether a PLP2 DUB-negative vaccine virus provides better protection than its DUB-competent counterpart against challenge with a virulent EAV strain, we performed a vaccination-challenge trial in horses. The data obtained in this study showed that in contrast to what was previously seen in cell culture experiments (van Kasteren et al., 2013), the PLP2 mutant virus appears to replicate slightly less efficiently than its parental virus in vivo (Fig. 3A). Even though the DUB-negative virus is clearly replication competent, this finding does suggest a role for PLP2 DUB activity in supporting replication in vivo, e.g. by inhibiting the innate immune response. In addition, despite this slight decrease in replication efficiency, the levels of protection against clinical disease (Table 2), the antibody response (Fig. 2B), and the innate immune response (assessed based on the expression of two interferon-stimulated genes; Fig. 3B and C) induced by the PLP2 DUB-negative virus was comparable to that induced by the parental virus. Surprisingly, we did not observe an increase in EAV-neutralizing antibody titres upon challenge infection of vaccinated animals (Fig. 2B). A possible explanation for this finding is that the virus dose used for challenge was too low, resulting in its efficient clearance before (re-)activation of the antibody response. Taken together, the present study could not be used to substantiate (or refute) our hypothesis that a DUB-negative virus provides better protection against challenge than its DUB-positive counterpart. The main reason for this seems to be the fact that the parental virus already provides a very high degree of protection, which as it turned out could not be detectably improved using this experimental set-up. In hindsight, one solution might have been to perform a more severe challenge, for example by using a higher virus dose for inoculation or a more heterologous and/or virulent strain than KY84. As PRRSV vaccines are in general less efficacious than EAV vaccines, another option would be to perform a similar trial with a PRRSV vaccine in pigs, but this will first require the design of viable PRRSV PLP2 DUB-negative mutants.",

            "text": "In contrast to what was previously found in cell culture-based assays (van Kasteren et al., 2013), we did not detect an increased activation of innate immunity by the PLP2 DUB-negative virus compared to its parental virus in vivo. However, it needs to be noted that we have thus far assessed the expression of only two interferon-stimulated genes, whereas many more exist. It therefore remains a possibility that differences do exist in the expression of other interferon-stimulated genes. Similarly, the induction of interferon-stimulated genes is only one of several consequences of the activation of innate immune signalling. It therefore remains possible that the DUB-negative vaccine virus differs from the parental virus in some other respect pertaining to immunity, for example the activation of cell-mediated adaptive immunity. Also, PLP2 DUB activity likely constitutes only one of several innate immune evasion strategies employed by arteriviruses. For example, nonstructural protein 1 (nsp1) of EAV was recently shown to inhibit the induction of interferon beta in a luciferase reporter assay (Go et al., 2014) and the PRRSV nsp4 main protease was recently shown to cleave the innate immune signalling factor NEMO (Huang et al., 2014). Also nsp1\u03b1 (Chen et al., 2010, Han et al., 2013, Kim et al., 2010, Song et al., 2010), nsp1\u03b2 (Beura et al., 2010, Chen et al., 2010, Patel et al., 2010, Wang et al., 2013a), and the nucleocapsid protein (Sagong and Lee, 2011) have been proposed to counteract innate immune activation. Taken together, the PLP2 DUB activity appears to constitute only a part of the total repertoire of arterivirus innate immune evasion strategies. For this reason, its contribution to the inhibition of innate immunity perhaps cannot be readily detected in the in vivo experimental set-up used here. For example, detecting more prominent consequences of its inactivation may depend on the details of the animal study, including specific properties of viruses and horses used. Nevertheless, the apparently limited negative effect on viral replication of PLP2 DUB-mutations does open up possibilities for combining mutations in multiple domains involved in immune evasion, thereby potentially synergistically increasing the overall immunogenicity of the virus.",

For example, coronaviruses (including SARS- and MERS-CoV) encode papain-like proteases that display DUB activity (for a review, see Mielech et al., 2014). The OTU proteases of nairoviruses have also been found to possess DUB activity (Frias-Staheli et al., 2007). Like arterivirus PLP2, these viral DUBs have been implicated in innate immune evasion (Frias-Staheli et al., 2007, Mielech et al., 2014) and are therefore potential targets for the design of novel vaccines. Interestingly, we have recently been able to show that the DUB and polyprotein processing functions of the papain-like protease encoded by MERS-CoV can also be separated by targeted mutagenesis (Bailey-Elkin et al., 2014). Taken together, the data obtained in this study definitely warrant further in vivo examination of the consequences of knocking out arterivirus PLP2 DUB activity as well as other immune-evasive activities to improve vaccine efficacy. The data obtained in such studies could subsequently also be used as preliminary proof of principle for the design of novel vaccines for other viruses, including corona- and nairoviruses.",
