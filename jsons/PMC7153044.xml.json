It can be assumed that the contagion was imported from the Levant, where it had already raged for some time. It died out after a few weeks wherever it raged, only to reach a new climax a few kilometres away. Three years later, it had arrived at Europe\u2019s outermost limits and died away (Fig. 7.1). But during these 3 years 20% of Europe\u2019s population, that is, 20 million people had died.\n",

A few kilometres further on, it found people who were still healthy and ready for contagion and there did its work until in the new place as well the susceptible people had died and others were healed and now immune. The spread of the Black Death in Europe right up to the far north was the typical progress of a diffusion front as described by Fisher when talking about the spread of an advantageous gene, that is, a gene with higher advantage (Chap. 10.1007/978-3-030-04681-1_4). Noble was the first to describe this spread of an epidemic using equations (Noble 1974). His treatment is based on reaction\u2013diffusion, i.e. Noble stands on the shoulders of Fisher, as yet without simulations at that early time of computer applications.",

Therefore, the spread of the Black Death is in fact a classical diffusion process that can be described with equations. It is one step more complicated than the spread of a growing population, as found, for example, in the case of the oak tree, since the spread of the epidemic implies \u2018finding\u2019 and increasing the number of infected people until the point at which these have either died or been healed.",

Fisher\u2019s growth term is now the increase in the percentage of infected people. This means that the interesting factor \u03b1 is not growth by reproduction as for the oak trees or Neolithic farmers (see Chaps. 10.1007/978-3-030-04681-1_4 and 10.1007/978-3-030-04681-1_5), but rather the rate of infection of still healthy but susceptible people (that is, people not immune from the start). The number of infected people cannot increase to infinity, however, since the number of people is limited, and not every one of them is susceptible. Hence, after a certain amount of time, every susceptible person has been infected, and the epidemic has reached its climax. Afterwards, the plague declines because all susceptible people have either died or else have been healed and are now immune. Noble put forward a reaction\u2013diffusion equation for the infected population similar to that proposed by Fisher about 20 years earlier for the spread of an advantageous gene. Noble replaced Fisher\u2019s growth rate \u03b1 of the advantageous gene with the growth rate \u03b1 of the infected population (which he described as the product of the susceptible population and the rate of infection). In addition, Noble had to consider that a proportion of the infected persons would die and that others would recover. Therefore, the epidemic would die out after some time.",

Noble attained a \u2018cross section\u2019 of an infected person for infecting others of about 1 km2 per year.

Now comes one of those drastic simplifications characteristic of and necessary for calculations of historic events because, as emphasized earlier, in the humanities, unlike in the exact sciences, we cannot modify the real parameters, since they were fixed in the past. Noble assumed that people were equally distributed over Europe, thus arriving at an average population density of 20 people per square kilometre. And Noble assumed further, based on historical reports, that rumours and gossip spread in Europe with a speed of 100 miles per year in the manner of a random walk and that the Black Death spread at the same speed, since it also relied on personal contact. With Einstein\u2019s formula for movements on the surface of the earth (Chap. 10.1007/978-3-030-04681-1_3) Noble received a value for the diffusivity.

All the complexity of the real situations is apparent and to deal with them with only simple reaction\u2013diffusion equations would not fulfil the requirements, whereas computer simulations can better deal with the complexities (Prochazka and Vogl 2017). Descriptions of spread problems in the past, on the other hand, can be dealt in this way, since only a few parameters of these processes are known. An educated guess, such as those made by Noble or by Ammerman and Cavalli-Sforza for the demic diffusion in the Neolithic (Chap. 10.1007/978-3-030-04681-1_5), is in order but, of course, yields only rather general information.",

Brockmann (2018) considers the same mechanism for the propagation of infectious diseases. Through air transport of people, the spread of epidemics over long distances appears even more probable than the spread of invasive plants, which in principle could be drastically mitigated. The possibility of transmitting diseases to distant locations can yield new seeds far away that can eventually become the nuclei of new waves of propagation.\n",

From Fig. 7.4, it can be seen that the dispersion of SARS, the severe acute respiratory syndrome, an epidemic caused by a virus, did not progress by means of a geographical wave. It sprang up in China and infected victims in the USA and in Europe earlier than in geographically much closer countries such as Korea or India. To treat traffic and consequently infections spreading across many locations worldwide, a new idea is needed: Brockmann (2018) replaces the diffusion fluxes by the probabilities that susceptible, infected and recovered persons move from one location to another one and back.\n",

If two locations in the air-transportation network exchange a large number of passengers, they should be effectively close because a larger number of passengers imply that the probability of an infectious disease being transmitted between them is comparatively higher than if these two locations were linked only by a small number of travelling passengers. This leads the authors to define the shortest path between each pair of airports. Figure 7.5 depicts the shortest path tree for the Berlin airport Tegel, TXL. You can see that large European airports are effectively close to TXL, as you might expect. However, large Asian and American airports such as Beijing (PEK) and New York (JFK) are also comparatively close to TXL. Because the shortest path tree also represents the most probable routes for spreading, this method can be used to identify airports that are particularly important in terms of distributing an infectious disease throughout the network.\n",

It is evident that the number of infected people at the place of outbreak first increases (here from 500 infected per 1,000 km2 to 2,000 after 1 month and 4,000 after 2 months) and then declines again. After 4 months, the climax of the epidemic is already 500 km away from the place of outbreak and 1,000 km away after 8 months. At the place of outbreak, the epidemic is then already extinct",

In this model, a once infested cell will never recover. Transmission occurs not only to nearest-neighbour sites but also to farther sites, though with a lower probability controlled by a distribution similar to a Gaussian (Richter 2015, Richter et al. 2013a, see also Chap. 10.1007/978-3-030-04681-1_4). Bottom row: model of the spread of a disease. An infected site (red) can transmit an infection to a susceptible (white) neighbouring site. Left, earlier point in time, right, later time. Please note that in this model, infected sites recover and become immune (grey). Also here, in addition to nearest-neighbour transmission, with a small probability, a transmission to a distant site can occur (Brockmann 2018)",
