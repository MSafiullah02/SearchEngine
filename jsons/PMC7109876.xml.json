Although only 1 sample of secretions was available per subject, we summarized cytokine concentrations by the day after the onset of wheezing on which they had been obtained. The quantities of the T lymphocyte cytokines IL-2, IFN-\u03b3, IL-4, and IL-17 declined over this interval, and most were substantially lower in samples obtained on day 5 than in samples obtained on day 1 (table 2). Therefore, there was no evidence of the development of lymphocyte cytokine responses over this interval.",

A comparison of pathological findings was done by one pathologist (L.M.), who was unaware of the identity of the infecting agent. In subjects with fatal cases of influenza virus infection, viral antigen was detectable primarily in the epithelium of larger airways (yet severe bronchiolitis was still evident) and, less frequently, in the airway lumen (figure 2A, upper panels). In contrast, in subjects with fatal cases of RSV infection, viral antigen was primarily found in the material obstructing the lumen of the small airways (figure 2B, upper panels). Viral antigen was also present in multinucleated giant cells lining or in the bronchiolar lumen. Viral antigen was much more extensively present in subjects with RSV infection than in those with influenza virus infection. Damage to the bronchiolar epithelium was judged to be much greater in the subjects with RSV infection than in those with influenza virus infection. Periodic acid\u2014Schiff (PAS)\u2014positive material (mucus) was found in the airway in only 1 subjects with influenza virus infection and was absent in the other 19 subjects with RSV and influenza virus infection. Intralumenal material was also negative by Alcian blue staining, indicating the absence of mucins. Other findings were felt to be similar in all 20 subjects, whether or not underlying heart disease or Down syndrome was present.

Specifically, there was no evidence of T lymphocyte activation in the respiratory secretions from these infants at the time of hospitalization for RSV LRTI; that is, the classical T lymphocyte cytokines IL-2, IL-4, IFN-\u03b3, and IL-17 were nearly undetectable in the secretions (figure 1A and 1B). In contrast, IL-2, IL-4, IFN-\u03b3, and IL-17 were all detected more frequently or at higher concentrations in subjects with influenza virus LRTI. Because infants with RSV infection had more-severe illness (reduced oxygen saturation and more-prolonged hospital stays) than did infants with influenza virus bronchiolitis, these findings therefore challenge the idea that overresponsiveness of cytotoxic lymphocytes plays a critical role in the development of bronchiolitis [3\u201311]. All samples of secretions for cytokine analysis were obtained by the same personnel using the same techniques during the same winter season. Samples were processed and analyzed in an identical fashion. Subjects with RSV infection were similar in age to those with influenza virus infection and had apparently been ill for 1 more day, on average, than had subjects with influenza virus infection (table 1). Therefore, these factors would not seem to account for the reduced cytokine responses observed in subjects with RSV infection.",

In the present study, lymphocytes bearing CD4, CD8, or CD56 antigen were rarely observed in lung autopsy tissues. In contrast, in subjects surviving measles virus pneumonia, CD8 antigen\u2014positive lymphocytes predominate in BAL fluids [31]. In fatal influenza virus infections beyond infancy, lymphocytes predominate in lung tissue [32, 33] and are also present in infections with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus [34]. Although the characterization of the mononuclear cell infiltrate observed in lung tissue from subjects with fatal adenovirus infections is limited, nevertheless, CD4- and CD8-bearing lymphocytes proliferate in peripheral blood and release IFN-\u03b3 [35, 36].

This suggests that activation of apoptotic mechanisms may be critical to clearing RSV-infected epithelial cells when cytotoxic T cell responses are absent. In contrast, caspase 3 staining was more prominent in macrophages and neutrophils in subjects with fatal cases of influenza virus infection. Although definitive conclusions are not possible, one possible explanation of the findings is that the expression of viral antigen was already declining in subjects of influenza virus infection (and bronchiolar epithelium was more intact) and that apoptosis was being induced in macrophages and neutrophils to reduce the inflammatory response. Further study of this critical area is needed. Other models of lung injury demonstrate that apoptotic signals are expressed on damaged epithelium immediately after toxic injury to the lungs. However, after the toxin has been cleared, apoptosis is prominent in inflammatory cells, presumably reflecting an attempt to terminate inflammation [44].",

We attempted to correct for this deficiency by studying the kinetics of mediator responses in samples grouped by day 1\u20135 of illness. Quantities of IFN-\u03b3, IL-4, and IL-17 declined over this interval. Although this suggests that we did not miss the eventual development of lymphocyte cytokine responses, follow-up samples obtained over several days would have been preferable. Another limitation is that samples of secretions for cytokine analysis, viral quantitation, and pathological analysis were not available from the same subjects. Nevertheless, bronchiolitis as a disease entity is thought to be similar in presentation worldwide [45\u201347], so regional differences in pathogenesis are unlikely. More importantly, the findings from the 2 populations in the present study are consistent in suggesting that T lymphocyte responses are reduced or absent in moresevere forms of infantile viral LRTI that result in hypoxia, the need for hospitalization, or death.",

Instead, clearance of the virus apparently depends on inefficient innate immune responses mediated by macrophages and neutrophils. The expression of caspase 3 in the lungs suggests that apoptotic mechanisms are activated in an attempt to clear virus. These mechanisms may eventually lead to the eradication of infection, but at the expense of damage to uninfected neighboring epithelial cells. These findings should encourage the testing of antiviral compounds with activity against RSV and influenza virus in infantile LRTI.",
