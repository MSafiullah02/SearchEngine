So far, the number of infectious cases has increased globally to more than 100 thousand and the outbreak has been defined as a pandemic situation, but there are still no \"specific drug\" available. Relevant reports have pointed out the novel coronavirus has 80% homology with SARS. In the difficulty where new synthesized drug cannot be applied immediately to patients, \"conventional drug in new use\" becomes a feasible solution. The first medication experience of the recovered patients in the US has led remdesivir to be the \"specific drug\". China has also taken immediate action to put remdesivir into clinical trials with the purpose of applying it into clinical therapeutics for Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). We started from the structure, immunogenicity, and pathogenesis of coronavirus infections of the novel coronavirus. Further, we analyzed the pharmacological actions and previous trials of remdesivir to identify the feasibility of conducting experiments on COVID-19.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "The novel coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCoV), officially named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is a newlyemerged human infectious coronavirus. Since December 2019, it has spread rapidly in China in a short period of time. As of March 17, 2020, there have been 81116 confirmed cases and 3231 deaths. It has also outbreak in other countries, such as Korea, Japan, Italy, Singapore, and Iran, with a total of 85296 cases confirmed. Due to it is a newlyemerged virus, researchers have taken quick actions to isolate the virus and perform gene sequencing, making identifying treatments possible. Even so, it takes time to develop new drugs and vaccines, as well as to explore biotherapeutics, thus it is unlikely to be applied to patients with urgent need. Therefore, \"conventional drug in new use\" becomes a viable solution. The SARS-CoV-2 is 80% homologous with the acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV), which also broke out in China in 2002, and some enzymes are even more than 90% homologous [1] . Consequently, we are expecting to find drugs for the treatment of COVID-19 from the experience of SARS-CoV and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV). Some drugs, such as ribavirin, interferon, lopinavir, and corticosteroids, have been used in patients with SARS or MERS [2] , within the selection range of \"conventional drug in new use\". Through clinical treatment of the COVID- 19 , it has been found that neuraminidase inhibitors (oseltamivir, peramivir, zanamivir), ganciclovir, acyclovir, ribavirin are ineffectual and not recommended for clinical application [3] . When we set our sights on the broad-spectrum antiviral drugs, we found that a drug unlisted, remdesivir, has demonstrated strength in trials related to MERS-CoV and Ebola virus infection. In the United States, the first patient with COVID-19 has shown significant improvement in clinical symptoms within 24 h of treatment with remdesivir. This case has convinced the public that remdesivir could become a new \"specific drug\" for COVID-19. This article starts from the structure, immunogenicity, and pathogenesis of infection of the SARS-CoV-2, and then analyzes the feasibility of conducting trials and putting into clinical use of COVID-19 from the pharmacological characteristics and successful cases of remdesivir. different from SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, and becomes the seventh member of the coronavirus family to infect humans [4] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1039, "end": 1042, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 1321, "end": 1324, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 1430, "end": 1432, "text": "19", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 1615, "end": 1618, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2451, "end": 2454, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "SARS-CoV-2 shows the typical beta coronavirus organization: 5\u2032 untranslated region (UTR), replication enzyme coding region, S gene, E gene, M gene, N gene, 3' UTR, and several unidentified nonstructural open reading frames ( Fig. 1 ) [4] . The replication enzyme coding region mainly expresses and encodes two large genes: ORF1a and ORF1b, which encode 16 nonstructural proteins (nsp1~nsp16) that are highly conserved throughout the coronavirus. S gene, M gene, E gene, and N gene respectively encode four main structural proteins: spike (S), membrane (M), envelope (E), and nucleocapsid (N) proteins. The S protein is the receptor binding site, which is on the viral surface; The M protein shapes the virions, promotes membrane curvature, and is responsible for the transport of nutrients across cell membranes; the E protein plays a role in the assembly and release of virus, and is involved in viral pathogenesis; the N protein can bind virus RNA genome and maintain its stability [5] . Among them, S protein plays a key role in virus recognizing and binding to host cell surface receptors, and mediating the fusion of virus envelope and cell membrane [6] . Through the analysis of the whole genome sequence of SARS-CoV-2, it shares 40% sequence similarity with MERS-CoV and 80% sequence similarity with SARS-CoV, indicating that SARS-CoV-2 is more compatible with SARS-CoV [7] . In addition, by performing systematic structural simulations and immunogenicity scans of the S proteins of all coronaviruses, as well as calculating the immunogenic distance between SARS-CoV-2 and other coronavirus subtypes, it can be concluded that the immunogenicity of the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 is closer to that of SARS-CoV [8] . It is known that SARS-CoV enters target cells by binding the S protein to the ACE2 receptor on the cell surface, which is triggered by the cell serine protease TMPRSS2 [9] .

At present, it has been proved that the binding affinity between the extracellular domain of the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 and ACE2 receptors is about 10-20 times higher than that of SARS-CoV, which may facilitate human-to-human transmission of SARS-CoV-2 [12] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 341, "end": 345, "text": "[10]", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 538, "end": 542, "text": "[11]", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 799, "end": 803, "text": "[12]", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "COVID-19 is a respiratory syndrome caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Through transcription and replication, the complex forms RNA negative strands that will be translated for the structural proteins of the virus later. Then the structural proteins and RNA in the cytoplasm assemble into new viral particles, which are released from infected cells by exocytosis to infect other cells (Fig. 2 ). Each infected cell produces thousands of novel viral particles that spread to bronchi, eventually reach the alveoli, and extrapulmonary organs, causing pneumonia and targeted organic infections. However, the ACE2 receptor is not only expressed in the respiratory organs. It has been reported that, by using the RNA-seq method to express ACE2 receptors in human tissues, the number of ACE2 receptors expressed in the gastrointestinal tract (high in esophagus, small intestine, and colon, but low in stomach), kidneys, and testes is nearly 100 times higher than that in the lung [15] , suggesting that these tissues may also be the target organs for SARS-CoV-2 invasion. It may explain why some patients with COVID-19 developed other system injuries clinically besides respiratory system injuries.

And it has been reported that the MERS-CoV infection induced elevated proinflammatory cytokine concentrations (such as IFN-\u03b3, TNF-\u03b1, IL-15, and IL-17) in serum [18] . We note that patients with COVID-19 also have high levels of IL-1\u03b2, IFN-\u03b3, IP-10, and MCP-1 in their serum, leading to activation of the Th1 cell responses. Furthermore, the concentrations of GCSF, IP-10, MCP-1, MIP-1A, and TNF-\u03b1 in ICU patients were higher than those in non-ICU patients, indicating that cytokine storms were associated with disease severity. Apart from this, SARS-CoV-2 infection also activates the secretion of cytokines (such as IL-4 and IL-10) in Th2 cell responses that suppress inflammation, which is different from SARS-CoV infection [17] .

Flow cytometry signified that the number of CD4 + and CD8 + T lymphocytes in peripheral blood was greatly reduced, but their state was overactivated. Other than this, CCR4 + and CCR6 + Th17 lymphocytes with highly proinflammatory effects increased in CD4 + T lymphocytes; CD8 + T lymphocytes had a high concentration of cytotoxic granules, of which 31.6% were perforin positive, 64.2% were particle lysin positive, and 30.5% were both particle lysin and perforin positive.

Furthermore, Peripheral T lymphocytes are in an over-activated state, manifested by increase of Th17 and high cytotoxicity of CD8 + T lymphocytes, accounting for to a certain degree of immune injury in patients. This over activation not only failed to establish an immune response, but also caused tissue injuries, mostly manifested as severe injury in the lungs, and some patients died of multiple organ failure. This situation further accelerates the deterioration and shortens the course of the disease, hampering the establishment of fully adaptive immune response. The immunopathological injuries caused by the over activation also provides us with an idea for treating COVID-19, for example, we can probably apply the IL-17 inhibitor (secukinwmab) directed against Th17 cell activation, but it still need more exploration.

This study implied that when the pulmonary injuries reach the maximum, simply reducing the virus titer can no longer suppress the strong immune responses in mice, also showing that administering before the peak of virus replication can significantly improve symptoms of the infected mice [23] . In a rhesus monkey model infected with MERS-CoV, treating with remdesivir 24 h before infection can completely prevent symptoms caused by MERS-CoV, strongly inhibit viral replications in the respiratory tract, and prevent the formation of pulmonary lesions. Administering remdesivir 12 h after infection provides clear clinical benefits, reducing clinical symptoms, lung virus replication, and lung lesions [24] . Pharmacokinetic experiments in cynomolgus monkeys showed the first-pass effect of oral remdesivir resulted in a low bioavailability of the drug. Intramuscular injection of 3 mg/kg had a 50% survival rate compared with the control group. Administering intravenously at a dose of 10 mg/kg, remdesivir rapidly decomposed into the original drug (nucleoside phosphate) in rhesus monkeys. Within 2 h, remdesivir quickly distributed in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), and soon afterwards activated to nucleoside triphosphate to reach a peak, with a survival rate of 100% [25] . As for pharmacokinetic studies in vivo, after the intravenous infusion of the remdesivir solution formulation at a single dose of 3-225 mg for 2 h, it showed dose-linear pharmacokinetics. Intravenous infusion of 150 mg of a remdesivir solution repeated 1 h per day showed a linear pharmacokinetics over a period of 14 days. After intravenously injecting 75 and 150 mg of remdesivir solution formulations over 2 h, the pharmacokinetic profile was similar to that of a lyophilized formulation. Intravenous infusion of 75 mg of drug over 30 min provides similar levels of parent drug exposure to the same dose over 2 h (Table 1) . After the intravenous infusion, remdesivir will enter the cellular metabolism to form active GS-443902 (Fig. 3C) , but the frequencies of PBMCs exposure of GS-443902 is higher than those of intravenous infusion of remdesivir 150 mg within 2 h. Studies in PBMCs show that the half-life of GS-443902 is more than 35 h [26] . In the case of daily administration, the active substance of the drug GS-443902 will accumulate in vivo.

The 53% fatality rate was not significantly different from the average 50% fatality rate of Ebola virus infection, and as a result, phase II clinical trials were stopped.

As public attach more attention on prevention and treatment, fewer patients meet stringent inclusion criteria, resulting in a slow recruitment process. Another reason is that there are plenty of drugs in the clinical trials, speeding up the patients' leaving hospital. Nevertheless, it has been reported that more severe patients have been recruited, which provides favorable conditions for the trial of the severe group, and as a result, at least, it can be rapidly applied to the clinical treatment of severe patients in the near future. The need of treatment on COVID-19 is urgent, so if the results of clinical trials prove it has the potential to benefit the treatment, according to China's \"Compassionate Use\", remdesivir will be more immediately used in patients with severe illness. Meanwhile, the opening of green channels under special circumstances to speed up the review and approval process of the drug approval center will undoubtedly help save the lives of critical patients and promote the developing of \"specific drugs\". In the absence of clinical trial results, it is still difficult to put remdesivir into large scale clinical use [33] . With the political support, the rapid development of clinical trials on remdesivir is imperative.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1164, "end": 1168, "text": "[32]", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}, {"start": 2540, "end": 2544, "text": "[33]", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Feasibility of trials on remdesivir on COVID-19"}, {"text": "A drug, GS-441524 (compound A, Fig. 3A ) for treating feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) caused by coronavirus infection in cats has been tested in cats.

It can be seen from the structure that remdesivir is phosphorylated from GS-441524, with identical target RdRp (Fig. 2) . It is noteworthy that though coronavirus reproduces more than 20 generations in GS-441524 yields resistance, the resistant virus is still sensitive to high concentrations of remdesivir and the fitness of the resistant virus has reduced to the same level as wild-type MERS-CoV [35] , which avoids resistant mutant coronaviruses from producing resistant supervirus. At the beginning of developing remdesivir, Gilead Science selected a large number of nucleosides or their prodrugs to conduct in vitro growth inhibition experiments on Ebola-infected human microvascular endothelial cells in the laboratory and found compound A showed inhibitory activity (EC 50 = 0.78 \u03bcM), and the compound A was GS-441524. Thereafter, on the basis of Compound A, after examining the activity and toxicity of compounds surrounding Compound A, modifying the prodrug, and optimizing amino acids and acyl groups, the cynomolgus monkey performs a pharmacokinetic test to select a structure such as GS-5734 (Fig. 3B) [25] . Although in phase II it was not as effective as competitive drugs and clinical trials were terminated, remdesivir showed good safety and pharmacokinetics in both phases I and II clinical trials.

The focal injection site reactions only showed in immediate pain with vocalization, occasional growling, and postural changes lasting for 30-60s.

Related studies have found that it plays a role in the final stage of entering the cell, which is consistent with its expected mode of action. Wuhan Virus Research Institute carried out a vitro inhibition test and found that remdesivir can block virus infection at very low micromolar concentration of Vero E6 cells infected with virus, and the cell selectivity is high (EC 50 = 0.77 \u03bcM, CC 50 > 100 \u03bcM, SI > 129.87) [2] .
