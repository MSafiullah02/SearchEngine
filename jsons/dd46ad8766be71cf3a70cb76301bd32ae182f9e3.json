MARs are thought to play an important role in higher-order structure and chromatin organization within the nucleus. MARs are also thought to act as boundaries of chromosomal domains that act to separate regions of gene-rich, decondensed euchromatin from highly repetitive, condensed heterochromatin. Herein I will present evidence that MARs do indeed act as domain boundaries and can prevent the spread of silencing into active genes. Many fundamental questions remain unanswered about how MARs function in the nucleus. New findings in epigenetics indicate that MARs may also play an important role in the organization of genes and the eventual transport of their mRNAs through the nuclear pore.",

            "text": "For many years it has been known that the expression of a transgene in eukaryotic organisms can vary widely between independent transformants (Allen et al. 1988 ) . The unpredictable, varied expression found in transgenic plants has been called \"chromosomal position effects,\" and is attributed to the characteristics of the site of integration (Alberts and Sternglanz 1990 ; Dean et al. 1988 ; Nagy et al. 1985) . Chromosomal position effects are primarily due to transgene integration events that can occur within euchromatin, which contains the majority of expressed genes, or condensed chromatin, such as heterochromatin (reviewed in Taddei et al. 2004 ) . The pre-existing chromatin structure at the site of integration ultimately determines the transgene expression level, either negatively (silenced) or positively (enhanced). Transgene expression can be highly variable since transgene integration cannot yet be easily targeted to a specific genomic location with a favorable chromatin structure.",

Variability due to silencing and related processes requires the evaluation of many transformation \"events,\" or independent transformants, in order to interpret the phenotypic effects of transgenes. This, in turn, increases the cost of labor and cause for regulatory concern. Because silencing can occur spontaneously in later generations of lines initially showing good expression, selecting stably expressing lines from a population of independent transformants, or even from the T1 generation, does not guarantee stability of expression over subsequent generations (Bourdon et al. 2002 ; Bregitzer and Tonks 2003 ; Chareonpornwattana et al. 1999 ; Levin et al. 2005 ; Vain et al. 2002) .

A detailed description of the nucleoskeleton is provided in an accompanying chapter in this book by Moreno Diaz de la Espina. It is thought that the effect of MARs on gene expression is achieved through their impact on chromatin structure. I briefly describe the role of histone modifications with particular emphasis upon the replacement histone H2A.Z. Increasingly, such histone variants are being recognized as mediators that can act in concert with boundary elements to separate active from inactive chromatin. The reader is also referred to accompanying chapters in this book that describe work on nuclear pores (A. Rose) and on chromatin domains (P. Fransz). 1 It is important to note that during the past twenty 20 plus years various nomenclature have been used for MARs which include Scaffold Attachment Region (SAR) (Allen et al. 1996 ; Bode and Maass 1988) , Boundary Elements (Cuvier et al. 2002 ; Mlynarova et al. 2003 ; Pathak et al. 2007 ) , certain types of Chromatin Insulators (Istomina et al. 2003 ; Valenzuela and Kamakaka 2006) , or a combination of both (S/MAR) (Goetze et al. 2005 ; Heng et al. 2004 ) .

When applied to transgenic plants, this model would effectively make the transgene domain independent. A major prediction of the loop domain model is that a transgene, flanked by the \"protecting\" MARs, remains active independently of the local chromatin state. A corollary prediction is that transgenes lacking MARs are susceptible to the impact of the surrounding chromatin structure and their expression level is dependent upon the local chromatin state. By acting independently, each transgene domain would contribute equally to transgene expression, which would increase in proportion to the number of transgenes. Thus, if more copies of a MAR-flanked transgene are integrated, a proportional increase in the expression of the transgene will result. Such predictions made from the loop 2 MARs also called SARs (Scaffold Attachments Regions) or S/MARs. 3 Nuclear matrix is also called nucleoskeleton or nuclear scaffold.

The packaging of chromatin is accomplished at several levels starting with the interaction of double-stranded DNA with two molecules of each of the core histones H2A, H2B, H3, and H4 to form the 11-nm chromatin fiber. The 11-nm fiber is further packaged by interacting with H1, the linker histone, to form the condensed 30-nm nucleosome. The details of the subsequent packaging steps to form the higher-order condensed structures are still largely unknown. It is generally thought that chromatin loops of up to 300 nm are bound at their base by MARs to a non-histone protein-RNA core, which is believed to be the nuclear matrix as shown in Fig. 2 . When the core histones are removed, the ~300-nm loops are unpackaged. Measurements by Paulson and Laemmli (1997) estimated that these histone-free loops averaged 10-12 \u00b5 m in length in Drosophila metaphase chromosomes, which represents an increase in length of 30-40-fold.

            "text": "It is now well recognized that gene-coding sequences alone do not provide answers to how the genome is regulated. A new effort to understand the function of the epigenome (Crawford et al. 2006 ) has been initiated with the goal of understanding the function of the non-coding regions of the human genome, which includes mapping the DNase I hypersensitive sites using tiled microarrays (Giresi and Lieb 2006 ; Sabo et al. 2006) . Because of the size of the human genome, researchers are limited to focusing on selected regions, which only encompass approximately 1% of the entire genome (Greally 2007) . In contrast, Arabidopsis , with such a small genome, offers tremendous advantages for such studies. In principle, either entire chromosomes or even the entire genome could be studied in detail. Unfortunately, while the analytical capability does exist, the mapping of DNase I hypersensitive sites in Arabidopsis has to date been limited to relatively small regions. Kodama et al. (2007) mapped DNase I hypersensitive sites in an 80-kb region from Chromosome 5 of Arabidopsis thaliana that contains 30 genes with expression levels that vary greatly . A total of 40 DNase I hypersensitive sites were found and all were located at the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 ends of 28 of the 30 genes. These data suggest that the average size of a DNase I \"hypersensitive domain\" within the 80-kb region is ~2 kb. If such DNase I hypersensitive sites found by Kodama et al. (2007) represent true chromosomal domains, then the size is much smaller than the DNase I hypersensitive domains found in either animal studies or even the 25-kb estimate for Arabidopsis by Paul and Ferl (1998) . It is important to note that the apparent difference in DNase domain size may simply be due to the use of an 80-kb region (Kodama et al. 2007 ) versus a 130,000-kb region (Paul and Ferl 1998) . Furthermore, the Kodama et al. (2007) result seems to differ from previous studies that show that DNase I hypersensitivity varies depending upon the expression of the gene. For example, Vega-Palas and Ferl (1995) note that DNase I-hypersensitive sites in the 5\u2032 flanking region of transcriptionally active genes are associated with the presence of transcriptional regulatory factors, which also reflects a de-condensation of the chromatin. Although more studies will certainly follow, the Kodama et al. study suggests that DNase I hypersensitivity does not reflect transcriptional activity, which is likely to be controversial.",

The Grey lab has dissected the chromatin structure of the pea PET gene and the initial studies identified a downstream MAR region (Slatter et al. 1991) . Further studies identified an A/Trich region in the promoter that bound to High Mobility Group I/Y (HMG) proteins (Pwee et al. 1994) . Transgenic plant studies showed that the A/T-rich region enhanced the expression of a b -glucuronidase ( GUS ) reporter gene and that when the 31-bp A/T core was included, the reporter gene expression also increased (Sandhu et al. 1998 ) . Chua et al. (2001) then tested the pea PetE locus for changes in nuclease sensitivity and H3 and H4 acetylation during three different transcriptional states (roots, etiolated shoots, and green shoots). As expected, the DNase I sensitivity increased during activation, and H3 and H4 from PetE were hyperacetylated in the green shoots, and were particularly enriched in the promoter/enhancer region.",

In the popular press the genome sequence and how it is regulated has been compared to a computer; with the primary sequence referred to as the hardware and the epigenome referred to as the software. While changes in genomic sequence are generally thought to occur slowly, changes to the epigenome can occur rapidly, which may help the organism to readily adapt to environmental change.",

The same, or a closely related mechanism is also responsible for forming (Martienssen 2003 ; Zilberman et al. 2004) or maintaining (Gendrel et al. 2002 ; May et al. 2005) heterochromatin in higher eukaryotes (reviewed by Henderson and Jacobsen 2007 ; Lippman and Martienssen 2004 ; Martienssen et al. 2005 ; Zaratiegui et al. 2007 ) .

In addition, the organization of a transgene locus also is known to play a major role, particularly when multiple copies integrate at a single site (Jorgensen et al. 1996 ; Stam et al. 1997 ; and reviewed in Allen et al. 2000 and Thompson et al. 2006) . For instance, most transgene integrations that result in an inverted repeat structure become silenced and form condensed chromatin (Martienssen 2003 ; Muller et al. 2002 ; Pecinka et al. 2005) . Condensed chromatin is thought to be able to spread by a self-propagated RNAi-mediated process, unless it is physically blocked by either a bound protein or a change in the chromatin structure (Bi et al. 2004 ; and reviewed in Richards and Elgin 2002 ; Talbert and Henikoff (2006) ; and Gaszner and Felsenfeld 2006) .",

To date, the only studies to demonstrate the H2A.Z-insulator block have been done in S. cerevisiae .

This raises the possibility that Arabidopsis H2A.Z may have retained similar functions, to bind to boundary elements and block the spread of heterochromatin. In yeast, H2A.Z (H1Z) is a replacement histone for H2A. The replacement is catalyzed by SWR1C, a member of the SWI2/SNF2 superfamily with orthologs in Arabidopsis . In Arabidopsis , flowering in long day conditions is contingent upon the successful establishment of epigenetic silencing of FLC , a repressor of the transition to flowering. This is achieved by histone trimethylation at H3 lysine 27 and deacetylation and is maintained by proteins that establish a Polycomb-like chromatin regulation (Greb et al. 2007 ) . Mutations in FLC cause early flowering, the same phenotype as various mutants of Arabidopsis thaliana with defective SWR1C (Choi et al. 2007 ) . Deal et al. (2005) showed that mutations in SUF3 ( ARP6 in yeast), which is a nuclear actin-related protein and also part of the SWR1 chromatin remodeling complex, also result in an early flowering phenotype, similar to the FLC mutations. Finally, studies by Deal et al. (2007) showed that Arabidopsis thaliana H2A.Z is required to suppress flowering by activating FLC . Such observations that H2A.Z potentiates transcription are similar to the proposed role of H1Z in the yeast.",

            "text": "The nuclear pore allows communication between the interior of the interphase nucleus and the exterior cytoplasm, as described in detail in a separate chapter in this book (A. Rose). It is generally assumed that mRNA must be exported in order to be transcribed but given the packaging constraints of nuclear DNA, mRNA export is unlikely to occur by simple diffusion or stochastic interactions. Here I briefly describe a possible role for the nuclear pore in the localization of active genes (Aguilera 2005 ; Cabal et al. 2006 ; Casolari et al. 2004 ; Ishii et al. 2002 ; Taddei et al. 2006) . In yeast, mRNA transport from an actively transcribing gene has been shown to \"track\" from the nuclear interior to the nuclear pore. However, data from recent studies with both yeast and Drosophila have also shown that chromatin redistribution or movement may contribute to the transport process. H2A.Z has been proposed to facilitate this process providing active genes access to the nuclear pore. The molecular intermediates that control this process could interact with MARs or use MARs as a type of DNA tether to shuffle parts of the chromosome into territories with access to a nuclear pore. Data from a recent study by Brickner et al. (2007) indicate that H2A.Z can interact with promoter regions of an active gene, thereby localizing the genes to the nuclear pore. Interestingly, even recently repressed genes retain bound H2A.Z and remained associated with the nuclear pore complex (NPC). Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) experiments have been used to show that transcriptionally active genes can occur in a complex that includes components of the nuclear pore complex, such as Nup2. Brickner et al. (2007) suggest that Nup2 may recruit or \"tether\" H2A.Z and its associated genes, to the nuclear pore to enable rapid reactivation (Dilworth et al. 2005 ; Ishii et al. 2002) . Such \"tethering\" may promote boundary activity, thus preventing the spread of condensed chromatin into transcriptionally poised regions. Brickner et al. (2007) also note that previous data with mutants lacking either H2A.Z, or Nup2 show an increase in the spread of silent chromatin (Dilworth et al. 2005 ; Meneghini et al. 2003) . Boundary elements are thought to associate with the NPC, allowing active genes to be correctly positioned for either active transcription or to be poised for transcription. Thus, H2A.Z binding allows for both proper localization of a gene to the NPC, and proper demarcation of heterochromatic silencing by its interaction with boundary elements. Furthermore, by remaining associated with recently active chromatin, H2A.Z confers epigenetic memory (Brickner et al. 2007) .",

While most of the cellular processes that are found in S. cerevisiae also occur in higher eukaryotes, there are a few important exceptions. In addition to the small size of its genome and nucleus, post-transcriptional gene silencing appears to be lacking in S. cerevisiae while some form of this silencing occurs in almost all other eukaryotes, including quelling in fungi (Valenzuela and Kamakaka 2006) . Additionally, homologous recombination readily occurs in S. cerevisiae . Although many questions remain from the S. cerevisiae studies, the process is thought to be highly conserved across eukaryotes (Cole and Scarcelli 2006 ; Ragoczy et al. 2006) . Taken together as a general model, tethering of active or recently active gene regulatory regions by MAR-bound proteins, such as H2A.Z, to the NPC may both block the spread of condensed chromatin and facilitate the transport of mRNA from the nucleus. However, questions will remain until experiments are done in plants to directly test this model.",

When a plant MAR from the RB7 gene was used, there was nearly 60-fold greater expression. An important result from both of these experiments was that transgene expression levels were not generally proportional to the transgene copy number. When the yeast MAR ARS-1 was used, expression appeared to be proportional to copy number until a \"threshold\" of 20 copies was reached (Allen et al. 1993 ) and transgene expression drastically decreased. The results were similar when the Rb7 MAR was used; lines with greater than ten copies (Allen et al. 1996) had greatly reduced expression. In contrast, when either the human \u03b2 -globin MAR (Breyne et al. 1992) or the chicken lysozyme A-element MAR (Mlynarova et al. 1994 ) was used, a modest increase GUS expression was seen but the expression between transformants was less variable. In apparent contrast to the results of both groups, Schoffl et al. (1993) found that including flanking Gmhspl 7.6-L MARs resulted in expression levels that were both proportional to transgene copy number and five-to ninefold higher in expression following heat shock induction.",

In the following sections, I try to add some understanding for why such apparent variation can be explained by RNAi, which is not measured when transgene mRNA abundance or protein levels are used to assess the effect of MARs. Thus, if the RNAi-mediated reduction in transgene expression were to be taken into account an entirely different interpretation may result. Increasingly it is being recognized that MARs seem to prevent gene silencing in cis , but do not appear to be effective on gene silencing in trans . With this knowledge, new strategies are being developed that combine the use of MARs for preventing or reducing RNA-mediated cissilencing with new methods for reducing RNA-mediated trans -silencing.",

(1998) crossed a variety of transgenic plants transformed by MAR-flanked transgenes with V271, a \"super-silencer\" plant that transcriptionally silences any \"target\" transgene that is driven by a CaMV 35S promoter (Vaucheret 1993) . V271-mediated silencing occurred in trans , irrespective of the different target locations or the presence of MARs, suggesting that siRNAs corresponding to the 35S promoter may have been actively recruiting transcriptional silencing machinery to the transgene loci. Ascenzi et al. (2003) used a similar strategy and crossed lines with additional dominant (or trans -based) silencer loci with lines expressing \"target\" 35S transgene loci at various genomic locations (Ulker et al. 1999) . In all of the crosses, the target loci were silenced, regardless of whether or not the Rb7 MAR flanked the target locus. Nuclear run-on assays, which test transcriptional activity, showed that two of the dominant silencer loci, with transgenes lacking MARs (control lines), appeared to be transcriptionally inactive, even though they were able to silence other 35S genes in trans . Since siRNAs are needed to maintain heterochromatic areas at centromeres and other regions (Dunoyer et al. 2007 ; Howell et al. 2007 ; Kavi et al. 2005) , which are not known to be transcribed at detectable levels, a similar mechanism may be in place for the dominant silencing loci. Perhaps during cell division siRNAs are transcribed to help re-establish heterochromatin after DNA replication.",

            "text": "In a separate experiment, Ascenzi et al. crossed the F1 progeny of the dominant silencing line x 35S gene (now silenced) line with a plant expressing P1-HCPro, a viral suppressor of silencing. P1-HCPro is known to reverse RNA-silencing of transgenes (Anandalakshmi et al. 1998 and reviewed in Allen et al. 2000) and is thought to reverse Post-transcriptional Gene Silencing (PTGS) but not Transcriptional Gene Silencing (TGS) . In the presence of P1-HCPro, silencing was eliminated in the 35S target genes if they were flanked with MARs. In contrast, silencing could not be reversed in the lines transformed with transgenes lacking the MARs (control lines). These data provide strong evidence that MARs protect against transcriptional gene silencing, perhaps by impeding the formation of heterochromatin. Thus, when MAR-flanked transgenes are silenced, the silencing is likely due to RNAi that targets the transgene mRNA, or a portion of the promoter. In contrast a transgene that lacks MARs is susceptible to a different form of RNAi that is targeted to the transgene promoter (Park et al. 1996) and results in transcriptional silencing. Transgenes that are located in large DNA loops away from the matrix may be more accessible to heterochromatin machinery, and both the gene and the promoter may become silenced. In both cases, silencing requires the presence of RNA that is homologous to either the promoter or the transcribed region. One possibility for the difference in silencing response is that MARs may have prevented RNA polymerase read-through into the promoters of adjacent genes (reviewed in Allen et al. 2000 and in Thompson et al. 2006 ) .",

Several Arabidopsis thaliana mutants have been found that are altered in the RNAi response (Dalmay et al. 2000 ; Elmayan et al. 1998 ) . Butaye et al. (2004) transformed mutant A. thaliana sgs2 5 and sgs3 6 plants ( Mourrain et al. 2000) with 35S: GUS transgenes either flanked, or not flanked by the chicken lysozyme A element MAR (Phi- Van et al. 1990 ; Stief et al. 1989 ) . The MAR-flanked transgenes increased GUS expression by fivefold in sgs2 and 12-fold in sgs3 plants. Transgene protein levels reached nearly 10% of the total soluble protein in some of the plants. Butaye et al. (2005 ) also found that transgene expression in wild-type plants transformed with the MAR-flanked transgene was only 60% of the expression seen in plants transformed with the transgene lacking MARs. While the majority of studies in plants have reported a positive effect on transgene expression when MARs are included in the transgene (reviewed in Allen et al. 2000 ; and Thompson et al. 2006) , an increase in transgene expression is not always seen. In fact, a decrease in transgene protein or mRNA would be expected if transcription rates drastically increased due to the flanking MARs and RNAi-mediated silencing was triggered. However, when RNAi cannot occur due to a mutation, the full stimulatory effect on expression due to the flanking MARs is revealed (Butaye et al. 2004) .",

However, if a gene is inducible or tissue/cell-specific, the target RNA may not be present at the same time or in the same cell as the silencing signal. If transcriptional activity causes silencing, then transgenes with inducible promoters, such as the tetracycline-inducible 3X promoter (Gatz et al. 1992) , may be less susceptible to silencing. In order for RNAi to continue, the process must be actively maintained. To test this hypothesis, Abranches et al. (2005) used an inducible luciferase ( LUC ) reporter transgene with or without flanking Rb7 MARs. The LUC transgene was transformed into NT1 tobacco suspension cells using microprojectile bombardment (Allen et al. 1996) . The transformed lines were grown either under conditions for continuous transcription of LUC , or conditions where LUC transcription was initially inactive but induced after approximately 50 cell generations 7 (Gao et al. 1991) . Delaying the induction resulted in an initial \"burst\" in LUC expression in the lines with the MAR-flanked LUC transgene, which was then followed by a decrease in expression to levels that were similar to the levels seen in the lines with the continually transcribed 3X: LUC . Expression results from the continually expressed transgene were similar to earlier experiments when a 35S: GUS transgene was used. Regardless of transcriptional activity, expression of the 3X: LUC was higher in lines with MARflanking transgenes than in the lines with either a \u03bb DNA-flanked spacer control or the control lacking spacer DNA. These data confirmed that the process of transcription increases silencing, as previously noted (Baulcombe 1996 ; English and Baulcombe 1997 ; Que et al. 1997 ; Vaistij et al. 2002 ; van Blokland et al. 1997 ; Vaucheret et al. 1997) , especially in the absence of the flanking Rb7 MAR. In addition, the MAR-flanked transgenes could be transcriptionally activated following prolonged inactivity, suggesting that MARs can prevent a transgene from being transcriptionally silenced by the spread of condensed chromatin or from siRNAs produced by readthrough from adjacent genes.",

            "text": "One of the original studies on the use of MARs in plants was by Schoffel et al. (1993) , who demonstrated one of the clearest examples of position-independent transgene expression in plants with up to six transgene copies. Schoffl et al. (1993) also used Agrobacterium transformation and found a strong effect from a MAR from the soybean heat shock gene Gmhspl 7.6-L . With some exceptions, reports of strong MAR effects (~3-fold or greater) on plant transgene expression are less frequent when Agrobacterium transformation is used (Annadana et al. 2002 ; Breyne et al. 1992 ; Butaye et al. 2004 ; De Bolle et al. 2003 ; Halweg et al. 2005 ; Holmes-Davis and Comai 2002 ; Kim et al. 2005 ; Levee et al. 1999 ; Maximova et al. 2003 ; Mlynarova et al. 1995 Mlynarova et al. , 1994 Mlynarova et al. , 2002 Oh et al. 2005 ; Sidorenko et al. 2003 ; Van der Geest et al. 1994 ; Van Leeuwen et al. 2001 ) . In principle, use of induction following several rounds of cell division is similar to the approach used by Abranches et al. (2005) . Schoffl et al. (1993) excised tobacco leaves, which were treated with a 2-h heat shock at 40\u00b0C. In contrast to genes that are constantly being transcribed and therefore more susceptible to RNAi, the use of induction results in a transgene being transcribed in the absence of RNAi targeted towards the transgene. The flanking MARs act to prevent the spread of silencing through the transgene, thus keeping it poised for transcription following induction.",

            "text": "The model presented for how MARs improve transgene expression can best be described as minimizing gene silencing (reviewed by Allen et al. 2000) . Until recently, the only data available for how MARs function has been circumstantial. For example, silencing can be reversed in lines that contain MARs flanking their transgene when crossed with plants expressing the viral suppressor of RNA VIGS, P1-HCPro (Anandalakshmi et al. 1998 ) . In addition, MAR-flanked transgenes are expressed at a higher level than the same transgenes lacking MARs when transformed into A. thaliana with mutations in some of the key components of the RNAi pathway for sense-transgene silencing (Butaye et al. 2004) . Additional data that support the model include findings that MARs do not protect against trans -silencing ) and that MAR-flanked transgenes are silenced when the transgene copy number reaches a threshold value (Allen et al. 1996 ; Allen et al. 1993) . While these data are suggestive, they still only correlate MARs with protection against transgene silencing. Conclusive data would require being able to examine a transgene with and without MARs at a defined position within the genome to avoid the possible variation due to differences in the chromatin structure at the site of integration. Regardless of how many transgenic lines are tested, it has not been possible to test MARs at specific locations in the genome due largely to the extremely low efficiency of gene targeting in higher plants (Britt and May 2003 ; Hanin and Paszkowski 2003 ; Kumar et al. 2006 ) . However, it is possible to excise DNA with the use of site-specific recombination. Fiering et al. (1993) used the site-specific Flp recombinase that can excise DNA when the Flp Target Recognition (FRT) sites flank the DNA in direct repeats. This strategy allowed Fiering et al. (1993) to compare the effect of various regulatory regions from the b -globin Locus Control Region on the expression of a transgene. Initially, the transgene and regulatory region flanked by FRT was transformed into the genome. The transgene expression levels and other characteristics, such as DNase I sensitivity, can then be tested. The Flp recombinase is then expressed in the cell by transient expression, to excise the particular regulatory element being tested. Transgene expression and the other characteristics can then again be analyzed at the same location. The difference in expression can then be directly attributed to the presence or absence of the regulatory element. Mlynarova et al. (2003) transformed tobacco with a 35S: GUS reporter gene with the chicken lysozyme A element MAR. The MARs flanked both the 35S: GUS reporter and the selection gene, nos promoter: nptII . One flanking MAR was flanked by the wild-type loxP and the second MAR was flanked by a mutated form of loxP ( lox511 ). In principle the wild-type loxP can only recombine with wild-type loxP and the lox511 can only recombine with lox511 . In the presence of Cre recombinase, which had been introduced by re-transformation with 35S: Cre , either loxP or lox511 self-recombination would result in the excision of the specific MAR flanking each transgene, GUS and nptII. It was anticipated that the resulting progeny would be missing a MAR from either flank of the reporter gene-selection gene domain. In many of the progeny the mutated lox511 and wild-type loxP had recombined, however, it was possible to find one progeny line was missing a single MAR, line AGCNA-61 (see Fig. 3 ) .",

However, AGCNA-61 plants in which the MAR had been excised showed several characteristics that are typically found in plants silenced by RNAi. For example, a comparison of GUS expression at different times showed that after 3 months the AGCNA-61 plants lacking the MAR showed a strong loss in GUS activity, and the silencing was intensified in homozygous plants. Nuclear run-on assays confirmed that the 35S: GUS transgene in AGCNA-61 plants remained transcriptionally active even when by arrows a , b , and c . The A element chicken lysozyme MAR at the 3\u2032 end of the transgene cassette blocks readthrough transcript a from continuing into the highly condensed plant DNA ( W ) flanking the transgene. The mutant loxP511 sites ( wide arrows ) are organized as direct repeats to flank the MAR. ( Bottom ) In the presence of Cre recombinase the directly repeated loxP511 sites recombine and the MAR is excised from the genome. Transcript a readthrough continues into the highly condensed plant flanking DNA. Small RNAs ( small arrows ) produced within the flanking DNA form doublestranded RNA with homology to readthrough the 3\u2032 end of transcript a and RNAi ( grey oval ) is initiated, which spreads into and silences the 35S: GUS transgene the MAR was absent. When the same plants were tested by Real Time-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR), the AGCNA-61 plants lacking the MAR had a greatly reduced level of GUS mRNA. Importantly, when the same plants were compared for the presence of siRNAs for GUS , only the AGCNA-61 plants lacking the MAR showed 21 -24-bp RNAs. The presence of the 21 -24-bp RNAs is found in plants that have active RNAi (Hamilton and Baulcombe 1999 ; Hamilton et al. 2002) , which in this case was targeted against the GUS mRNA. This finding supports the hypothesis that MARs protect transgenes from cis -silencing by RNAi. As noted earlier, RNAi has been shown to be key for the initiation and maintenance of heterochromatin.",

However, differences in the method of transformation may also play an important role. The greatest increases in transgene expression seen in experiments have resulted from transformants produced by direct DNA transformation, such as microprojectile bombardment. It is generally thought that the use of direct DNA transformation results in a higher transgene copy number than when Agrobacterium transformation is used. It is well known that higher transgene copy numbers have an increased probability of being silenced, or have greater expression variation (Hobbs et al. 1990 (Hobbs et al. , 1993 Koprek et al. 2001) .",

By unlinking the selection and the reporter genes, the transformation process for each is independent, and there is no selection bias for strong or against weak gene expression . In practice, transformants are first identified by resistance to the selective agent and then are measured for reporter gene activity.

A typical Agrobacterium transformation involves infection of the competent plant tissue, killing of the Agrobacterium , and selecting for cells that can survive the antibiotic or herbicide due to the presence of the selection transgene. It is critical that the selectable marker transgene be expressed in order for the cells to survive and proliferate. Cells that are \"transformed\" but do not express the selectable marker are routinely discarded. The use of selection therefore creates a bias by selecting only for transformants with active transgenes which must be integrated into regions of the genome that are transcriptionally active at the time of selection, such as euchromatin. Of course, the linked reporter transgene integrates into the same active genomic region and thus the integration sites cannot be random.",

If a method of identifying transformed cells that does not rely on selection is used it then becomes possible to achieve more random integration. A recent study by Francis and Spiker (2005) demonstrated how selection bias may impact our interpretation by using a PCR method to identify transgenic plants with integrated nptII selection and GUS reporter genes. When transformants that had been identified by PCR were tested for kanamycin resistance, which requires nptII expression, approximately 30% were sensitive indicating that the selection and linked reporter gene had integrated into a region of the genome that was prone to gene silencing. These results were confirmed recently by Kim et al. (2007) who transformed A. thaliana Col-0 suspension cells in the absence of selection. Transformants were identified with T-DNA integration events that had a higher probability of occurring in heterochromatic regions, such as centromeres, telomeres, and rDNA repeat regions.",

            "text": "Selection requires active expression of the selection gene. When selection is used, transgene integration is highly likely to occur in transcriptionally poised or active genomic regions. If MARs are associated with regions of active transcription, would a higher percentage of the selection-derived transformants integrate in close proximity to endogenous MARs, especially when the transgene construct used lacks flanking MARs? Second, if transformants could be identified without the use of selection, would such transgenes be found in genomic regions lacking local endogenous MARs? Of course, for truly random integration to occur, it would be necessary to assume that the endogenous MARs do not enhance integration site preference. Interestingly, several studies have found either predicted (Makarevitch et al. 2003) , or experimentally tested MARs (Dietz et al. 1994 ; Iglesias et al. 1997 ; Sawasaki et al. 1998 ; Takano et al. 1997) in close proximity to the site of transgene integration, but selection has typically been used to identify these transformants. The interpretation from such results is that transgenes integrate near endogenous MARs, but to truly address these questions, it is necessary to study integration sites from transformants identified without selection bias. Koprek et al. (2001) described a novel approach that may provide some of the answers to this question. The Agrobacterium transformation included a selection step to identify the primary transformants with the transgene integrated at the \"launchpad\" integration site. However, an AC/DS transposon system was then used to generate novel genomic integration sites, resulting from transposition, without using selection. This procedure allows the DS element, carrying a Bar gene ( Ba sta r esistance), to randomly integrate into new genomic positions during the transposition process. Initially the Bar transgene, flanked by inverted-repeat DS ends (Bar-DS), was transformed into barley using Agrobacterium and transformants were selected on the herbicide Basta. The Basta-resistant transformants were then crossed with a plant expressing the AC transposase gene and the F 1 progeny were then self-pollinated. The F 2 plants were then re-tested for Basta resistance. When transposition occurred, 25% of the new integration sites were unlinked from the original site, indicating that Bar had integrated into different chromosomes.",

Sequence analysis of the initial T-DNA integration sites, which were selected for by Basta, found a sevenfold greater preference for integration into non-redundant, gene-rich regions of the barley genome versus non-gene regions. In contrast, when the new sites resulting from DS elements were mapped, a preference for regions containing endogenous MARs was found. It is possible that the DS transposon prefers more accessible chromatin with MARs, or that regions containing MARs are generally favored sites for the integration of new DNA. This could occur, for example, if DNA repair enzymes were more likely to be found in active parts of the genome. Petersen et al. (2002) transformed barley with 35S: GUS transgenes flanked by either the P1 MAR from soybean (Breyne et al. 1992) or the Transformation Booster Sequence (TBS) MAR from petunia (Buising and Benbow 1994 ; Galliano et al. 1995 ; Meyer et al. 1988 ) . In vitro MAR binding assays using nuclear matrix isolated from barley leaves showed that the P1 MAR bound strongly whereas the TBS MAR binding was insignificant. Interestingly, both MARs increased the transformation efficiency by approximately twofold, but only the P1 MAR increased expression (12-to 13-fold). The mechanism for how both the P1MAR and the TBS MAR stimulate transformation is unknown but not completely unexpected. Because, as Zhao et al. (2006) noted, though DS elements integrate preferentially near endogenous MARs, the converse may also be true: MARs that are associated with transgenes may facilitate integration.",

MARs can be used in combination with other strategies such as plants with mutations in silencing components (Butaye et al. 2004) or plants transformed with viral suppressors of silencing (Anandalakshmi et al. 1998 ; Marathe et al. 2000 ) that block, in trans , RNA silencing and achieve high levels of transgene expression. Several examples have been published that have used MARs in combination with a gene of interest for practical applications such as reducing photorespiration to improve photosynthesis and biomass production Khan 2007 ; Leegood 2007 ; Niessen et al. 2007 ) , increasing expression of a starch-branching enzyme , or increasing stilbene synthase expression (Jin et al. 2004) . While MARs can be used for increasing the level of expression of a useful gene product, very high expression levels may also show an increased likelihood of initiating RNA silencing. It is highly likely that reports from various labs in which MARs have little or even negative effects in certain transformation experiments are due to post-transcriptional gene silencing (Baulcombe 1999 ) .",

            "text": "Ironically, according to the model, including MARs in a transgene construct may be one of the best ways to stabilize trans -silencing through post-transcriptional gene silencing, or RNAi. Gene knockdown through RNAi is increasingly becoming important as a method for understanding gene function (McGinnis et al. 2007 ; Waterhouse and Helliwell 2003) and for metabolic pathway engineering (Chen et al. 2005 ; Kotting et al. 2005 ; Kusaba 2004 ; Tang and Galili 2004) . Many recent applications use RNAi constructs to knockdown the expression of an endogenous gene through the use of hairpin constructs (Waterhouse and Helliwell 2003) . In order for RNAi to continue to function it is necessary for the hairpin construct to continue to be transcriptionally active. In some cases the RNAi vector becomes transcriptionally silenced, leading to loss of the knockdown phenotype (Fojtova et al. 2003 ; Kerschen et al. 2004) . MARs work well for preventing cis -silencing of the promoter and have been shown to stabilize the transcriptional activity of cassettes containing viral genes for silencing incoming viral sequences vectors for producing virus-resistant plants (Robertson 2004) . One specific example of the benefit of using MARs to stabilize silencing comes from work in tobacco, testing resistance to the tospovirus Tomato Spotted Wilt Virus (TSWV) (Levin et al. 2005) . A transgene cassette designed for constitutive expression of the TSWV 35S: nucleocapsid protein gene, TSWV-N with and without flanking Rb7 MARs was used to transform tobacco. When a total of 79 MAR and 66 non-MAR events were tested in the field over four generations, the MARcontaining plants showed significantly higher levels of resistance to TSWV, which is transmitted throughout the field season by thrips. These findings validate the prediction that PTGS plays an active role in the final expression levels of MARflanked genes and that before concluding that MARs themselves have a negative effect on gene expression, silencing must be tested or eliminated as a variable. Levin et al. (2005) showed that resistant lines produced small RNAs of 21 -25 bp and that they maintained transcriptional activity as demonstrated by nuclear run-on assays. The Levin et al. experiment clearly demonstrates the value of MARs for preserving transcriptional activity and maintaining virus resistance.",

While understanding whether MARs improve transgene expression is important, MARs are also thought to be important for other basic nuclear processes such as DNA replication and nuclear organization.

A computer algorithm has been developed to predict MARs (Rudd et al. 2004 ; Tetko et al. 2006 ) and it has been used to predict the MARs in the Arabidopsis thaliana genome. However, when the algorithm was used to predict known plant MARs only 60% were \"found.\" In contrast, an earlier algorithm, called MAR-finder (Singh et al. 1997 ) was able to predict nearly 80% of the known plant MARs. A major limitation for both algorithms is the lack of experimental data. New genomic approaches that allow the identification and mapping of large numbers of sequences that bind to the matrix may eventually provide such data (Linnemann et al. 2007 ) .",

What is the role of nuclear actin? What role does RNA play in the nuclear matrix? How are MARs recognized, and what is the biological significance of MARs with different binding affinities? New methods will be needed to examine large-scale protein-protein interactions in living cells, and to begin to unravel the role of RNA both as a catalyst and as a structural component (Rozowsky et al. 2007 ; Washietl et al. 2007 ) .
