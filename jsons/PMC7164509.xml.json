However, the situations in which they provide these diagnoses may not enable them to have a full complement of diagnostic tools available. As a result, they may diagnose a specific condition without the resources to correctly diagnose underlying causes or conditions due to multivector disease factors or comorbidities. For example, the PEEK VISION device may diagnose Glaucoma, but practitioners may not be able to measure persistently high blood pressure which may be the root cause [25]. Therefore, it is important that diagnostic devices become embedded in a system that can provide a more complete diagnosis, one that creates a medical record from each image or patient consultation. This medical record must become available for professional review, one that contains tests and records of interrelated symptoms, comorbidities, and even contraindications.",

That is, through automated diagnosis via an intelligent system and low-cost consumables attached to diagnostic devices, the proposed system can achieve a cost per diagnosis at the clinic level that would likely be acceptable to most government entities. Although the availability of diagnosis would grow significantly, since the services would mostly be performed in low cost settings, the total cost to the health system would be offset by some incremental reductions in services in higher cost settings.

For example, the WHO Infectious Disease Target Testing List (shown on Appendix B) lists 37 communicable diseases. In fact, many of the diseases listed on the WHO Infectious Disease Target Testing List can be treated locally (in small clinics, upon confirmed diagnosis) because specific and highly effective drugs have been developed for these conditions.
