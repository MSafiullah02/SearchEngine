HCoV\u2010229E, HCoV\u2010OC43, HCoV\u2010NL63, and HKU1 are coronaviruses (CoVs) that normally cause only mild upper respiratory disease with rare severe infections occurring in infants, young children, and elderly people [1]. More dangerous ones are SARS\u2010CoV and MERS\u2010CoV, which can infect lower respiratory tract and trigger a severe respiratory condition in humans [2]. It is widely known that some CoVs affect birds, bats, mice, giraffe, whales, and many other wild animals, but they can also infect livestock, causing great economic loss [3,4]. Domestic animals can also play a role as intermediate hosts that enable virus transmission from the natural, wild animal hosts to humans [5,6]. In addition, domestic animals themselves can also contract bat-borne or closely related coronavirus diseases [4]. Genomic sequences that are very similar to porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus (PEDV) have been detected in bats. In 2016, a large\u2010scale outbreak of a disease in pigs in southern China that killed 24,000 piglets were caused by an HKU2\u2010related Bat-CoV, swine acute diarrhoea syndrome CoV [7,8]. This incident was the first documented case where a Bat-CoV caused a severe disease in livestock [8].",

The coronavirus (CoV) has a single-stranded, nonsegmented RNA genome of positive polarity, and its virion contains 4 major structural proteins: the nucleocapsid (N) protein, the transmembrane (M) protein, the envelope (E) protein, and the spike (S) protein (Figure 1). However, with some coronaviruses, the full ensemble of structural proteins is not necessary for the forming of a complete, infectious virion; additional proteins may be encoded with overlapping compensatory functions [10,11,12].",

The endoplasmic reticulum localization of N protein carries a function for this in assembly and budding.

Generally speaking, the S glycoprotein facilitates viral binding to susceptible cells, causes cell fusion, and induces neutralizing antibodies. Of the 2 functional subunits containing several antigenic sites, S1 and S2, the S1 monoclonal antibody appears to occur most efficiently because it has a higher level of neutralizing activity [14,15,16].",

Reverse genetic studies and virus-like protein (VLP) assembly studies suggest that the M protein encourages assembly by interacting with the viral ribonucleoprotein (RNP) and S glycoproteins at the budding site and by creating a network of M-M interactions capable of excluding some host membrane proteins from the viral envelope [17].",

While the E protein is plentifully expressed inside the infected cell during the replication cycle, only a small portion is incorporated into the virion envelope [11]. Most of the protein is localized at the ER, Golgi, and ER-Golgi intermediate compartment, the site of intracellular trafficking, where it takes part in CoV assembly and budding. According to published studies, 3 roles have been proposed for the CoV E protein: a) the interaction between the cytoplasmic tails of the M and E proteins which suggests that E participates in viral assembly; b) its hydrophobic transmembrane domain is essential for the release of virions; and c) it is implicated in the virus\u2019s pathogenesis [11,18].",

The receptor binding domains (RBD) sites within the S1 region of a coronavirus S protein vary depending on the virus; some have the RBD at the N-terminus of S1 (MHV), and others (SARS- CoV and SARS- CoV-2) have the RBD at the C-terminus of S1 [16]. To gain entry into human cells, many \u03b1 coronaviruses (HCoV-229E, TGEV, PEDV, FIPV, CCoV) employ aminopeptidase N (APN) as their receptor, HCoV-NL63, SARS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 utilize angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as their receptor, MHV enters through CEACAM1, and MERS-CoV binds to dipeptidyl-peptidase 4 (DPP4) [18]. After the receptor binding, the virus must next gain access to the host cell cytosol. This is usually accomplished by acid-dependent proteolytic cleavage of the S protein by a cathepsin, TMPRRS2, or another protease, followed by fusion of the viral and cellular membranes (16).",

Transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) and PEDV, for example, cause severe gastroenteritis in young piglets that lead to significant morbidity and mortality and results in economic losses [22]. The feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV) results in the development of a lethal disease called feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) [23]. FIP has wet and dry forms and is similar to the human disease sarcoidosis. FIPV is macrophage tropic and may cause aberrant cytokine and/or chemokine expression and lymphocyte depletion, which results in a lethal disease [23]. The cattle industry has experienced significant losses from bovine coronaviruses (BCoV) that caused significant losses in the cattle industry, and its infection spread a variety of ruminants including elk, giraffe, deer, and camels [3,15,24]. Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) affects the urogenital tract of chickens, causing renal disease. Egg production is significantly reduced by the infection of the reproductive tract with IBV, causing substantial industrial losses every year [20]. The most intensely studied animal coronavirus is murine hepatitis virus (MHV) which causes a variety of conditions in mice, including respiratory, enteric, hepatic, and neurologic infections. Thus, MHV is an excellent model for studying the basics of viral replication in tissue culture cells as well as for studying the pathogenesis and immune response to coronaviruses [22].",

The murine and hepatitis viruses (MHV), another group of animal\u2019s viruses, were first identified by Cheever at al. in 1949 [1]. In 1946, transmissible gastroenteritis in swine was first recognized. However, it was not until after the human coronaviruses (HCoVs) were discovered in the 1960s and the coronavirus genus was defined that these 3 animal diseases were found to be related [1]. An organ culture of human embryonic trachea taken from a schoolboy with a cold was described by Tyrrell & Bynoe as the first human coronavirus (B814) in 1965 [25]. When examined by an electron microscope, the virus was found to resemble avian IBV. Hamre & Procknow recovered 5 virus strains in tissue culture taken from medical students with colds around the same time [26]. Almeida & Tyrrell examined the prototype strain HCoV 229E, and its morphology was found to be identical to that of B814 and IBV [27]. Using the organ culture technique, 6 further strains were subsequently recovered including the prototype strains HCoV OC43 as well as 3 strains considered antigenically unrelated to either OC43 or 229E [1].

This disease spread to Hong Kong in late February, and, within days, international air travel spread the virus over a wide area, seeding outbreaks in Vietnam, Singapore, Canada, and elsewhere. In July 2003, at the end of this outbreak, 8422 cases had been recorded, 916 (10.8 %) of them fatal, in 29 country across 6 continents [28]. The point of initial emergence of SARS-CoV an animal reservoir were the live animal markets in Guangdong, where diverse animal species are held, traded and sold to restaurants in response to the demand for exotic food [28]. Small mammals, such as civet cats, sold in these markets were found to harbour viruses closely related to SARS-CoV, and the initial interspecies transmission to humans probably came from these markets [29,30]. MERS-CoV was first isolated in 2012 from the lung of a 60-year-old patient who developed acute pneumonia and renal failure in Saudi Arabia. Live MERS-CoV identical to the virus found in humans was isolated from the nasal swabs of dromedary camels, further indicating that camels serve as the bona fide reservoir host of MERS-CoV. As of February 14, 2020, over 2500 laboratory confirmed cases were reported with a high case fatality of 34.4%, making MERS-CoV one of the most devastating viruses known to humans [28].",

For this reason, the new virus was called SARS-CoV-2, its single-stranded RNA genome containing 29,903 nucleotides encoding for 9860 amino acids (Figure 2) [9]. While its origins are not completely understood, these genomic analyses suggest that SARS-CoV-2 probably evolved from a strain found in bats. However, the possible intermediate between bats and humans, the potential amplifying mammalian is not known.
