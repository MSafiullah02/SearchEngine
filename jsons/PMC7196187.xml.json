At present, the COVID-19 pandemic has entered a dangerous new phase. The spread of COVID-19 is more severe than that of the previous Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), because of the increased industrialization, which led to virus evolution (2). This is the third coronavirus epidemic after the SARS and MERS coronavirus outbreaks. Structural studies revealed that there is a close relationship between the receptor-binding domains of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV. SARS-CoV-2, which causes COVID-19, is spherical, and the viral envelope entails a bilipid layer, which has the membrane (M), envelope (E), spike (S) proteins, and positive-sense RNA as genome, with an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase sequence. SARS-CoV-2 can be viewed as a self-assembled nanostructure in which the most vulnerable and weakest part is the lipid bilayer envelope composed of phospholipid molecules. In addition, SARS-CoV-2 infects host cells through ACE2 receptors, leading to COVID-19 related pneumonia, while also causing acute myocardial injury and chronic damage to the cardiovascular system (3). The transmission of COVID-19 is primarily caused by human coming into contact with the viral droplets, which suggests that keeping a one-meter distance from an infected person will be beneficial.",

Many countries have taken precautionary measures against the virus, and government officials in all countries continue to try to minimize human contact by facilitating countrywide shutdowns of public places, and various steps have been started to safeguard the people, like social distancing and self-quarantine, which limits our social interactions (4). This will decrease the risk of spreading COVID-19 to people, by breaking the transmission chain and the influx of new COVID-19 cases in a given time period. Further, the COVID-19 pandemic has forced scientists to rework strategies to combat infectious diseases through drugs, treatment, and control measures. The entire world is taking necessary steps to develop a vaccine for this dreadful virus, and for this kind of research governments are providing copious funds for scientists and institutions. The South Korean government and the Korean Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) have announced urgent research projects for the development of vaccines and drugs against COVID-19. In the Republic of Korea, since the first confirmed case of SARS-CoV-2 on January 20, 2020, as per the KCDC report on April 21, 2020, the confirmed cases are 10,683, released from isolation 8213, isolated 2233, and deceased 237. The KCDC is rapidly taking the necessary steps to minimize the infection. The Republic of Korea has implemented several measures to effectively flatten the curve and provide timely medical care to the infected patient. India\u2019s first case of COVID-19 was reported on January 30, 2020, in Kerala. As per WHO\u2019s report on April 21, 2020, in India 18,601 were confirmed cases, 3252 had recovered, and 590 had died. The Indian government is using compulsory measures to ensure that people are well prepared to conquer this deadly infection of COVID-19.",

This promotes the new areas of Science and Technology with special emphasis on emerging needs by providing funds for the development of vaccines and drugs in this pandemic situation. In light of this, it will become increasingly necessary to maintain systemic and coordinated efforts between the public, clinical, commercial, and industrial sectors to establish a cohesive body of knowledge and ensure robust diagnostics and treatment supply lines in the midst of this pandemic. Hence, clinical laboratories play a major role in this crisis, contributing to patient screening, diagnosis, monitoring, and treatment. Hence, cooperation with various institutions, academics, governments, and pharmaceutical companies is inevitably necessary to control the virus, combat the situation, and provide solutions for any future pandemic outbreaks. In this review, we aim to discuss the updates of current diagnostics and therapeutic approaches to COVID-19 patients. As rapid diagnostics and development of vaccines and drugs for this dreadful virus are important interventions in the management of the COVID-19 outbreak, the updates on this topic are essential in the current scenario for the betterment of patients. In addition, we discuss the types of sample/specimens collected and rapid diagnostics methods for accurate results to guide treatment options. Currently, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are the most-used drugs, which have been discussed along with their mechanism of action on the virus. In addition, Convalescent plasma therapy, which is promising as a way to improve the clinical outcomes of COVID-19 patients, is also discussed.",

Particularly, COVID-19 seems to be transmitted mostly during the incubation period, when most of the patients either lack the symptoms or have very mild non-specific symptoms (6). The common symptoms associated with this disease are high fever, cough, difficulty in breathing, and lesions in the lungs; in the worst cases, it can cause severe pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and risk for life (7). Individuals affected with such symptoms or who have had any International travel history or contact with a person who is ill or been quarantine should approach the government and health-care officials to monitor and check their health status for the safety of their family as well as society. The Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) (8), the World Health Organization (WHO) (9), and the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) (10) has recommended a few guidelines for the collection of the specimens from the affected or suspected COVID-19 patients. It is mandatory that the affected or suspected individuals should co-operate with the state or local health-care departments for the collection, the further process like storage, and shipment of the specimens appropriately. It is highly mandatory and recommended that the specimens should be collected only in a BSL-3 laboratory for the safety of the clinicians and researchers. Based on the recommended guidelines of WHO, the sample will be isolated from two major sources, which are the lower respiratory tract and the upper respiratory tract. The specimens, such as a nasopharyngeal swab (NP) or the oropharyngeal swab (OP), will be collected from the upper respiratory tract, whereas the bronchoalveolar lavage, tracheal aspirate, or sputum will be collected from the lower respiratory tract (Table 1).",

            "text": "With the number of COVID-19 infections flying off the charts, accurate and rapid diagnosis has evolved as a tool to detect and control the virus (Fig. 1). Currently, various diagnostic tools have been approved by the WHO, which has recommended the collection of upper respiratory specimens using NP swabs. If unavailable, the CDC and WHO recommend the collection of OP specimens, sputum, endotracheal aspirate, bronchoalveolar lavage, blood, stool, and autopsy material and tissue from lungs (8). Recently, the WHO has approved the emergency use of qSARS-CoV-2 IgG/IgM rapid serological tests, in which venipuncture blood collected by medical professionals can be used. However, the use of this test is limited to authorized laboratories alone. This test identifies the IgM and IgG antibodies produced by the patient in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection (9). Likewise, ICMR has also issued some guidelines for the diagnosis of COVID-19. The ICMR has recommended the use of RT-PCR probes from the USA that are distributed to laboratories in the country. In addition, commercial kits and US FDA EUA/CE IVD-approved kits may be used for diagnostic purposes in India. Further, kits with 100% concordance will also be fast-tracked for use in India; 20 non-US/FDA/EUA/CE/IVD kits have completed evaluation in this regard (10). Moreover, the tests available predominantly check for the presence of viral nucleic acid in the specimen through RT-PCR. In order to confirm the diagnosis, a minimum of two targets must be chosen on the SARS-CoV-2 genome, with one being specific for SARS-CoV-2. Otherwise, the test can include a primer specific for beta coronavirus, and the presence of SARS-CoV-2 must be confirmed by sequencing of the genome. Various viral proteins like orf1ab, N, RdRp, S, E, ORF1b, and nsp14, have been targeted for diagnosis in laboratories worldwide. At this point, it is essential to point out that a negative result does not exclude the probability of COVID-19, because such a result can be caused by poor-quality specimens, late or very early collection, improper handling of the sample, and inaccurate testing methods. The commonly available RT-PCR tests that are widely used for detection of COVID-19 take a significant amount of time to give the results and also require trained personnel and well-equipped laboratories for their use. As rapid detection tests appear to be a break-through in COVID-19 diagnosis, fine-tuning of this technique is required to use them as regular diagnostic kits. Although these tests are quick and relatively inexpensive, their accuracy has not been established yet. Another drawback is that antibodies develop only a few weeks after infection, and the levels may be more pronounced in severe cases, increasing the chances of a false negative in patients with mild or asymptomatic COVID-19. For now, we recommend the use of RT-PCR as diagnostic tools for the detection of COVID-19. In addition to these methods, CT scans may aid in the diagnosis of COVID-19, but this method is not recommended for routine screening, because it may not be precise in all patients (11). It is also possible that biochemical assays and blood counts, including lymphocyte levels and C\u2010reactive protein (CRP) proteins, may serve as useful biomarkers for COVID-19, and these tests can be used as preliminary screening for COVID-19. More research is required to ascertain the value of these tests in this domain. As the global demand for diagnostic tools continues to rise, it is essential to rapidly develop diagnostic kits using various algorithms to successfully identify and contain the virus.",

On viral entry into the body, the virus attacks the throat, causing the initial symptoms of COVID-19, further progresses to the lungs, and causes distress, following which it reaches the bloodstream (13), resulting in the progression of the condition. In healthy individuals, white blood cells (WBCs) circulate in the blood and are attacked by foreign particles, such as bacteria and viruses. Leukocytosis occurs when there is an abnormal increase in WBCs above the normal range (3,400 to 9,600 cells/\u03bcL). This is a common sign of inflammation induced by viral entry. Similarly, leukopenia is the anomalous decrease of WBCs (less than 4,000 cells/\u03bcL) in the blood and can also result from various viral infections in which the WBCs are used more quickly than they are made. Likewise, lymphocytes are cells produced by the bone marrow involved with immunity; a dynamic balance is maintained in the number of lymphocytes in healthy individuals. Lymphopenia or reduction of lymphocytes (less than 1,000 lymphocytes/\u03bcL) is another abnormality commonly observed in COVID-19 patients. Lymphopenia is a factor that is positively correlated with disease severity (14) and may be caused by the surge in cytokines mediated by COVID-19 or by direct inactivation by SARS-CoV-2. Correspondingly, the inflammatory response triggered by SARS-CoV-2 results in the modification of levels of CRP and ESR in the blood. In COVID-19, CRP concentration rises following IL-6 secretion caused by the cytokine storm after infection. It binds to markers present on dying cells and consequently activates the complement system to mediate phagocytosis of the dead cells. As a result, CRP (normal 3.0 mg/L) is increased in patients with COVID-19. Likewise, after infection, the cytokine storm increases the fibrinogen levels in the blood; this makes the erythrocytes adhere together, increasing the ESR during times of infection. Aside from the changes in the blood portfolio, LDH, a common component of cells of various organs, is increased in COVID-19. The normal blood LDH level is 140-280 units/L, but when the cells or tissues are damaged, LDH is released into the serum, increasing its levels. Hence LDH is used as a test to detect cell or tissue injury. Like LDH, procalcitonin is normally negligible in the blood (0.01 \u03bcg/L) but increases once stimulated by cytokines. The lungs and liver also produce procalcitonin as a response to inflammatory cytokines. These processes increase the levels of procalcitonin in the blood upon infection or injury. This is concomitant with increased levels of AST and ALT, indicating liver damage. Since many reports have observed kidney and liver injury in patients with COVID-19, these markers could thus be elevated (Supplementary Table 2). The changes in the levels of these components suggest that COVID-19 may be involved with damage to various tissues and cells in the body. It is imperative to closely monitor the changes in these parameters to uncover early biomarkers of COVID-19. Changes in levels of these cells and molecules may happen well in advance of the onset of typical COVID-19 symptoms. Moreover, a deeper understanding of the changes in these parameters will aid in the development of therapies for COVID-19. Further investigation is needed in this area for a better understanding of these abnormalities in blood parameters to provide accurate therapeutic drugs for COVID-19.",

According to a recent study, an inflammatory drug, baricitinib, when used in combination with anti-viral drugs like Remidesivir, increases the potential of the drug to reduce viral infection (16). The Lopinavir/Ritonavir drug is currently provided to treat HIV infection; from the laboratory experiments, it is evident that these combinational drugs could be used to treat the COVID-19 infections. According to the (15), the interferon beta-1a, which is used to treat multiple sclerosis, can also be used as a remedial approach for COVID-19 disease.

Chloroquine and its derivative, hydroxychloroquine, are very closely related and used to treat malaria and rheumatologic conditions, respectively. Hydroxychloroquine is a disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug, and it regulates the activity of the immune system, which may be overactive in some conditions including rheumatoid arthritis, discoid and systemic lupus erythematosus, and juvenile idiopathic arthritis. Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine have been repurposed for the treatment of several disease conditions, including HIV, Systemic lupus erythematosus, and rheumatoid arthritis (18). Chloroquine is classified as an anti-malarial drug and has shown potential in the treatment of avian influenza A (19). Chloroquine has been indicated to treat infections caused by P. vivax, P. malariae, P. ovale, and P. falciparum. It can also be used to treat extraintestinal amebiosis (FDA; Approved Drug Products: Chloroquine Phosphate Oral tablets) and prophylaxis caused by Zika virus (20, 21).",

Chloroquine and its combination of drugs used in the treatment of COVID-19 has been listed in Table 4. Hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine are currently undergoing clinical trials to ensure their preventive action for SARS-CoV-2 infected patients (8). Chloroquine diffuses to the cell passively through the cell membranes and to the endosomes, lysosomes, and Golgi vesicles, where it becomes protonated, trapping the chloroquine in the organelle and raising the surrounding pH (25, 26). The raised pH in the endosomes prevent virus particles from using their activity for fusion and entry into the cell. Chloroquine does not affect the expression of ACE2 on cell surfaces but inhibits terminal glycosylation of the ACE2 receptor for cell entry targeted by SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 (26-28). The chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine have various way to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 action. Also, because of chloroquine, there is a change in the pH of lysosomes that leads to inhibition of the cathepsins, which is mandatory for the formation of autophagosomes to cleave the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein and blocks the viral attachment to the human host receptors. Additionally, the chloroquine can constrain the quinone reductase-2, which is an essential agent required for the biosynthesis of sialic acid, which is generally used as the receptor moieties by the SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, the chloroquine obstructs the MAP-kinase, which results in SARS-CoV-2 virus molecular crosstalk, further alters the viral assembly, and intrudes into the proteolytic process of the M protein of the virus (26). Savarino et al. (29) hypothesized that chloroquine might block the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines like interleukin-6 by blocking the pathway leading to ARDS.",

            "text": "Although a definitive treatment or specific vaccine for this deadly viral infection is still a question to be answered, an experimental study related to convalescent plasma (CP) therapy appears as a shaft of light to combat the SARS-CoV-2 infection. Doctors and scientists are claiming that CP therapy was effective during the past epidemics; it could be a potential treatment option in this current scenario as well. Even the ICMR has given approval for the state hospitals to register for a CP trail protocol, to initiate the clinical trials of CP therapy for the COVID-19 patients. The CP therapy is a common adaptive immunotherapy, where the patients recovered from a viral disease with high neutralising antibody titer against the virus and would be used as plasma donors to treat the affected individuals. In this therapy, when our body gets infected with the SARS-CoV-2, our immune system produces antibodies against it. These antibodies reach out to identify and mark the invading virus as the intruding foreign body inside the human system (Fig. 3). This, in future, triggers the white blood cells to attack the identified intruders (SARS-CoV-2), which leads to the deactivation of the viral infection. The CP therapy has been used to treat several infectious diseases, including Spanish flu (1917-1918) (32), the Ebola epidemic in West Africa (33), human coronaviruses (34), influenza A (H1N1) and A(H5N1) (35). During the H1N1 viral infection, the CP therapy gave positive results, where the respiratory tract viral load, serum cytokine levels, and mortality levels were significantly reduced in the infected groups compared to their control group (36).",

In a meta-analysis from 32 studies conducted on SARS-CoV infection, the mortality rate was significantly decreased when compared to their placebo group (35). Since there is a high sequence as well as virological homology between the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, the CP therapy could be a promising therapy to treat the severely affected COVID-19 patients (39, 40). In CP therapy the antibody-rich plasma will be isolated from the COVID-19 recovered patients using an apheresis machine; the plasma-rich antibody against the SARS-CoV-2 would be injected, which could neutralise the viral load in the severely affected COVID-19 patients. For this procedure, around one litre of plasma will be collected, where approximately only 250 mL of plasma is required for one patient (41). According to a recent study in China, the researchers found that CP therapy could rescue COVID-19 patients from disease severity. During this experimental assay, one dose of 200 ml CP transfusion was readily accepted, which also reduced several symptomatic conditions of the COVID-19 patients. The researchers found that after the introduction of CP therapy, the patients showed negative for the SARS-CoV-2 nucleic-acid test, increased the oxygen saturation levels and lymphocyte counts, and also improved the functions of organs (42). These studies demonstrate that CP therapy could be a promising therapy to improve the clinical outcomes of COVID-19 patients. Since this therapy is in its pipeline stage, more investigations are required in larger cohorts to make it a global and standardised therapy to treat COVID-19 infection.",

It is clear that the clinical laboratory plays a major role in this crisis, contributing to patient screening. As COVID-19 has triggered human casualties and a serious economic crisis posing a global threat, an understanding of the current scenario and developing a plan of action to contain the spread of the virus are urgently needed. Rapid diagnostics, vaccines, and therapeutics are important interventions for the management of the COVID-19 outbreak. It is essential to move forward with all the information necessary to be more prepared for a pandemic of its kind in the future.

(3) The drug also targets the virus through increasing the endosomal pH and hinders the glycosylation process of the cellular receptors of SARS-CoV-2, which eventually blocks the viral attachment to the ACE2 receptors and inhibits the viral infection.
