            "text": "Among the justifi cation grounds pleaded in the gambling cases, the protection of consumers from gambling-related harm is an important, if not the central concern. There can be no doubt that protecting consumers from gambling addiction is a highly legitimate motive that can justify restrictions to cross-border trade in gambling services. Until recently, the pan-European discussion in the legislative branch was very limited, and the Internal Market Courts consequently became the main 'fora of discussion' of gambling issues. In line with the adversarial setting of court proceedings and the fi nancial consequences that are at stake, 1 private operators and public monopolies have usually continued their quarrel outside the courtroom immediately after the release of a new ruling. The aim has been to gain the high ground regarding the 'correct interpretation' of the judgment and to highlight alleged points of victory. 2 According to prevalent views, gambling and gambling addiction appear to be fundamentally different from other risks and therefore need a different, separate regulatory approach. Both the EU legislator and EU judiciary have repeatedly emphasised a peculiar or special nature of gambling. The Services Directive states \" [g] ambling activities [\u2026] should be excluded from the scope of this Directive in view of the specifi c nature of these activities.\" 3 Counsels of governments have repeatedly argued this specifi c nature, be it in court hearings or public presentations. 4 This could for instance be observed in Anomar where the Portuguese government pointed at the 'special nature' of gaming. 5 Similarly, from the beginning the Court of Justice accepted the idea of gambling being a special case, referring in its fi rst gambling case to \"the peculiar nature of lotteries, which has been stressed by many Member States.\" 6 The following observations shall 1 The Gross Gaming Revenues (i.e., stakes less prizes but including bonuses) during 2008 were estimated to be around 75.9 billion Euros in the EU. The online gambling services accounted for 6.16 billion Euros, i.e., 8 % of the overall gambling market. In Malta, the gambling revenues amounted to 8 % of the national Gross Domestic Product (GDP). For many Member States, the gambling revenues amounted to around 1 % of the GDP. This seemingly small part is taxed at a much higher level (licensees) than other goods and services or is directly provided by an exclusive right holder: Commission Staff Working Paper: Accompanying Document to the Green Paper on On-line Gambling in the Internal Market, COM (2011) 128, SEC (2011) 321, at 8-9. 2 For obvious procedural reasons, these post-judgment quarrels can be noted in particular in cases that follow the preliminary ruling procedure as the case is referred back to the national court to decide on the merits: Planzer patient's life to the detriment of social, occupational, material, and family values and commitments.\" 12 As opposed to the ICD, the DSM offers diagnostic criteria . This manual is the standard classifi cation of mental disorders in the US 13 and is used globally by mental health professionals. Its most recent revision, DSM -5 , incorporated important changes and will also shape the forthcoming ICD-11. DSM-IV used to classify 'pathological gambling' as an 'impulse-control disorder not elsewhere classifi ed', next to disorders like kleptomania or pyromania for too little was known about pathological gambling at the time of its initial classifi cation. DSM-5 reclassifi ed the disorder and renamed it to ' gambling disorder '. This term is very likely to be used by ICD-11 as well. Therefore, it is the most frequently used term in this chapter, except where other terms seem to be more appropriate. 14 DSM-5 offers nine diagnostic criteria in relation to the diagnosis 'gambling disorder ': 15 A. Persistent and recurrent problematic gambling behavior leading to clinically signifi cant impairment or distress, as indicated by the individual exhibiting four (or more) of the following in a 12-month period:",

            "text": "accuracy. 31 As these screens consist of different questions, they may lead to varying prevalence rates of gambling disorder. 32 While the data situation regarding the prevalence of gambling disorder is poor in most countries, it is well established in the US and Canada. 33 Studies conducted in various countries around the globe indicate similar prevalence rates as in North America. 34 The life-time prevalence rates of gambling disorder range from about 0.5 % to 2.0 % in the general population. 35 The range is largely due to differences in samples, instruments, methodology and the actual availability of gambling. 36 Petry found the estimates to be relatively consistent globally and concluded that prevalence rates of life-time Level 3 Gambling (gambling disorder) most often range from about 1 % to 2 % and life-time rates of Level 2 Gambling (problem gambling) from 2 % to 5 %. She also found past-year prevalence rates to be about 40-60 % lower than life-time rates, 37 that is, 0.25-1 % of the general population experienced gambling disorder within the past year. These fi ndings were also confi rmed by other studies. A review of over 100 prevalence studies spanning more than 20 years of research showed a gambling disorder rate of approximately 1 %. 38 Among the jurisdictions included, only the rates in Hong Kong, Macao and Singapore were substantially higher with approximately 2 %. 39 In North America, several studies of high quality and large sample sizes have addressed the prevalence in the general population nationally. 40 The fi rst national prevalence study was already published in 1979 by Kallick et al., one year before 'pathological gambling' (now: 'gambling disorder') was included in DSM-III. The study had been commissioned in view of the increasing appearance of new forms of legalised gambling, 41 which mainly concerned the booming casino industry in Nevada, in particular along 'the strip' in Las Vegas. Kallick et al. indicated life-time rates of 0.7 % for 'probable compulsive gambling', which comes closest to 'gambling disorder', and 2.3 % for the less severe form of 'potential compulsive gambling'. About 61 % of the people had gambled within the last year and 68 % at least once in their life. 42 The next estimate was delivered by Shaffer et al. 43 who conducted a meta-analysis of all prevalence studies in Canada and the US between 1975 and 1997 that met minimum requirements regarding methodology and data samples. According to the 120 identifi ed studies, 4 % qualifi ed as life-time and 2.8 % as past-year Level 2 Gamblers (problem gambling), and 1.5 % as life-time and 1.1 % as past-year Level 3 Gamblers (gambling disorder). A committee of the National Research Council reanalysed these fi ndings and found very similar rates. 44 The third national study was conducted by Gerstein et al. and commissioned by the National Gambling Impact Study Commission. 45 Its results are seen as being of limited utility due to methodological and data sample reasons. 46 Only a few years later, Welte et al. found a rate of 2.0 % for life-time gambling disorder and 1.35 % for past-year gambling disorder. 47 The study thus confi rmed the fi ndings from the such as probable pathological (SOGS), pathological (NODS), severe problem gambling (PGSI) and compulsive gambling (GA-20), regardless of the instrument used. Arguably, 'severe' in this study comes close to the clinical term 'pathological gambling' but is not identical. The report focused on past year prevalence rates exclusively. meta-analysis by Shaffer et al. 48 In sum, these studies showed a trend of increasing prevalence rates.",

Until the beginning of the new millennium, a trend could be identifi ed. The participation in some form of gambling had clearly increased over time and so had the prevalence rates of gambling disorder. The rates from the fi rst US national study in 1979 (0.7 % for life-time 'compulsive gambling', 2.3 % for 'probable compulsive gambling ', 1979) had more than doubled to reach those in 2002 (2.0 % for life-time gambling disorder). However, subsequent studies with large samples found signifi cantly lower rates. Petry et al.'s analysis of a large sample from the National Epidemiological Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions (NESARC) found a life-time prevalence rate for gambling disorder of only 0.4 % and a life-time prevalence rate for problem gambling of 0.9 %. 52 Kessler et al. analysed data from the National Comorbidity Survey Replication (NCS-R) and found a life-time prevalence rate for gambling disorder of 0.6 % and life-time problem gambling rate of 2.3 %. 53",

This can be noticed in a social setting such as a reception or a dinner. It may lower inhibitions and increase the willingness to engage in conversations with other guests. Yet, the same substance is unlikely to result in an energising effect when consumed home alone: the same person may feel relaxed (positive), tired (neutral) or even melancholic or depressed (negative). If the two situations involve the very same person and the very same amount and kind of substance, why do they lead to different emotional experiences? Why do some people manage to handle their alcohol consumption while others do not? These considerations already show that alcohol, a substance associated both with recreational and addictive consumption, does not have the same effect on every person and in every situation.",

Similarly, if drug using was the only cause of addiction, addictive behaviors would be absent every time drug using was missing. 64 Research over several decades has established that the focus on the object fails to explain the nature and mechanisms of addiction. Various factors have been identifi ed that contribute to the development of addiction. These factors relate to the host (subject), the agent (object) and the environment and interrelate in complex ways. Empirical evidence on substance-related disorders is older than on gambling disorder. The fi ndings from the former can provide valuable information in situations where gaps of research regarding gambling disorder occur. 65 The public health model of disease transmission illustrates the interplay of the various factors relating to host, agent and environment. In this model, gambling regulation can be seen as an environmental factor that impacts people's behaviour ( Fig. 9 .2 ). 66 64 Shaffer, H.J., \"What is Addiction?: A Perspective\". 65 During a presentation in Vienna in 2007, Professor Howard Shaffer estimated that about half of the research publications on gambling disorders dated from 1999 onwards. 66 Planzer, S., and Wardle, H., The Comparative Effectiveness of Regulatory Approaches and the Impact of Advertising on Propensity for Problem Gambling , Report prepared for the Responsible Gambling Fund 2011.

Even prior to the most recent revision towards DSM-5, the close relationship of substance-related addiction and gambling addiction was already evident from the diagnostic criteria. 68 Table 9 .1 shows the striking similarity of the diagnostic criteria of gambling disorder and substance use disorders. In order to facilitate the comparison, the commonalities are highlighted in the table. Alcohol use disorder and tobacco use disorder are used as examples. It should be noted that any other substance-related disorder could be used as well (opioids, cannabis, inhalents, etc.) since the diagnostic criteria are largely identical. 69 As Table 9 .1 illustrates, most diagnostic criteria of the substance use disorders fi nd similar equivalents in the diagnostic criteria of gambling disorder. Notably, only two (of eleven) criteria must be fulfi lled to meet the diagnosis for a mild alcohol or tobacco use disorder and only four (of nine) criteria to meet the diagnosis for a mild gambling disorder. As a result, in a situation where one patient is diagnosed for 'alcohol use disorder', another patient for 'tobacco use disorder' and yet another one for 'gambling disorder', all three patients are likely to meet similar diagnostic criteria . Even though the agents (objects of addiction) are different, the diagnosed signs and symptoms are very similar (Table 9 .1 ).",

This is to refl ect the wide range of addictive disorders that exist in a continuum from mild forms to severe forms. DSM-IV-TR used to distinguish between 'abuse' (mild) and 'dependence' (severe); DSM-5 now specifi es the severity as mild (2-3 symptoms for substance-related disorders; 4-5 symptoms for gambling disorder), moderate (4-5 symptoms; 6-7 symptoms) and severe (6 or more symptoms; 8-9 symptoms).

Brain imaging is a particularly good way of documenting similar craving-related brain activity for different expressions of addiction. Investigations in the neural correlates of craving states in gambling disorder compared to those in cocaine-use disorder confi rmed the general literature on gambling addiction and substance-related addiction. 76 Dependence differs signifi cantly from the nature of addiction. Not every person who experiences signs and symptoms of dependence is addicted. Patients treated over a certain time with the pain killer methadone, a synthetic opioid that impacts the opioid receptors similar to heroin, may experience neuroadaptive phenomena like tolerance and withdrawal. In the case of tolerance , the same amount of methadone, over time, no longer produces the same positive effect as it initially did. In the case of withdrawal , the patient reacts restlessly and irritably when trying to reduce methadone intake. The tolerance and withdrawal symptoms in these situations are normal responses to prescribed medication and a mere expression of physiological dependence . These responses do not turn patients into methadone addicts. The physiological dependence will fade over time . 77 In stark contrast, an addict has to overcome addiction, that is, a mental health disorder that comes with massive mental and physical challenges as well as very high rates of relapse. Correctly, DSM-5 no longer counts tolerance and withdrawal for those taking medications under medical supervision. 78 The work group concluded that the confusion of dependence and addiction had resulted in withholding adequate doses of opioids from patients with severe pain because of the fear of ' producing addiction '. 79",

            "text": "Research has established that both substances and behaviour can stimulate neurobiological systems. This has been particularly shown in relation to the dopamine reward system. 81 The neurotransmitter dopamine is largely seen as a key player in the development and maintenance of drug and behavioural addiction, and the neurobiological circuitry of the central nervous system as the common pathway for addiction. 82 People suffering from different addictive disorders show a similar preuse thrill . Different objects of addiction stimulate similar neurobiological pathways: the biochemical reactions in the brain are similar. 83 Research with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has demonstrated an anticipation or pre-use thrill for different objects. Pathological gamblers show the same kind of excitement when shown pictures of casino tables comparable to the effect on cannabis addicts when shown a joint. Former pathological gamblers who had not played for fi ve years show only weak reactions. 84 This shows that the pre-use thrill experience is not chronic and that, with successful recovery , neurobiological reactions fade out over time . It was further shown that beauty and money can stimulate the dopamine reward system in similar ways as the anticipation of cocaine use in the case of cocaine users. 85 88 Up to DSM-IV-TR, substance use disorder used to be categorised as substance \u201aabuse' (mild forms) and substance \u201adependence' (more severe forms). DSM-5 uses the overarching term substance use disorder, with the severity ranging from mild to moderate and severe. The DSM-IV-TR severity level dependence corresponds to the DSM-5 levels moderate (4-5 diagnostic criteria) and severe (6 or diagnostic criteria). See also Sect. 9.1.3.4. 89 Conway, K.P., Compton, W., Stinson, F.S. et al. ( 2006 ) . \"Lifetime Comorbidity of DSM-IV Mood and Anxiety Disorders and Specifi c Drug Use Disorders: Results From the National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions\", Journal of Clinical Psychiatry, 67 (2), 247-257. 90 ( 2007 ) . \"The Prevalence and Correlates of Eating Disorders in the National Comorbidity Survey Replication\", Biological Psychiatry, 61 (3), 348-358. 96 Ibid. European studies too confi rm that gambling disorder is one mental disorder among many other mental disorders. As noted earlier, the past-year prevalence of gambling disorder varies in Europe between 0.25 % and 1 % (see Sect. 9.1.2.2 i . f .). Wittchen et al. measured the size and burden of mental disorders in Europe . They identifi ed past-year prevalence rates for alcohol ' dependence ' 97 (3.4 %), cannabis dependence (1.05 %) and opioid dependence (0.25 %). Prevalence rates similar to those of gambling disorder related to Borderline Personality Disorder (0.7 %) and Eating Disorders (0.85 %). By far the most prevalent mental disorders were anxiety disorders (14 %) and major depression (6.9 %). 98 How do various mental disorders relate to each other? Scholarship has established the so-called phenomenon of comorbidity , that is, the occurrence of one or several disorders in addition to a primary disorder. High rates of comorbidity between psychiatric and substance use disorders have been found in studies relating to the general population 99 as well as to specifi c sub-groups. 100 People suffering from substance use disorders show increased levels of psychopathology, including the aforementioned highly prevalent depressions and anxiety disorders. 101 Other studies 97 Up to DSM-IV-TR, substance use disorders used to be categorised as substance \u201aabuse' (mild forms) and substance \u201adependence' (more severe forms). DSM-5 uses the overarching term substance use disorder, with the severity ranging from mild to moderate and severe. The DSM-IV-TR severity level dependence corresponds to the DSM-5 levels moderate (4 or more diagnostic criteria) and severe. See also Sect. 9.1.3.4. 98 Wittchen, H.U., Jacobi, F., Rehm, J. et al. ( 2011 ) have confi rmed that people engaging in substance abuse 102 have higher rates of psychopathological disorders such as anxiety and depression, 103 and vice versa. 104 Comorbidity was also demonstrated in relation to gambling disorder. Petry found in the national epidemiologic survey on alcohol and related conditions that most pathological gamblers suffered from cooccurring disorders . Of the pathological gamblers, 75 % had an alcohol use disorder, 60 % had nicotine use disorder and 38 % had a drug use disorder. 105 Other studies on gambling disorder have found clearly increased rates of substance use disorders too. 106 Similarly, people with psychoactive substance abuse as the primary disorder have clearly increased rates of gambling disorder. 107 102 Up to DSM-IV-TR, the term 'abuse' was used up to describe mild forms of substance-related disorders; severe forms were described as 'dependence. DSM-5 uses the term 'disorder' with the possibility of specifying severity levels ranging from mild over moderate to severe. Pathological gamblers also have increased levels of psychopathology. Petry found that around 61 % of the pathological gamblers experienced a personality disorder (for example, schizoid, antisocial), almost 50 % a mood disorder (for example, depression) and around 41 % an anxiety disorder (for example, social phobia). 108 Comorbidity was also present among compulsive shoppers where increased levels of substance disorders and psychiatric disorders were identifi ed. 109 The conclusion is that people suffering from a substance-related or behavioural disorder are much more likely to exhibit (an) additional disorder(s). 110 While the co-existence is well established, the chronological order between psychopathology, substance-related and behavioural disorders has only been partly discovered. 111 Comorbidity is a well-established phenomenon in relation to gambling disorder. The National Comorbidity Study Revised discovered important fi ndings with regard to the order of gambling disorder and co-morbid diseases. In this study, participants reported in 75 % of cases that the 'other' disorder preceded gambling disorder. The study further showed that many people did seek and received treatment for their various disorders, except for their gambling problems for which no formal treatment was received. 112 This may attest to a low awareness of specialised programmes or to their limited existence.",

No evidence was found for a heritability of problematic use of only one specifi c substance. 130 Shared genetic vulnerability has been expressly demonstrated between alcohol disorder and gambling disorder 131 but also as widespread as the range from drug addiction to compulsive running. 132 This suggests that the presence of a general addictive tendency in persons is not object-specifi c. 133 Genetic risk factors are therefore responsible for an increased risk to develop some form of addiction . 134 There is ample brain, behavioural and genetic evidence pointing to shared vulnerabilities that underlie the pathological pursuit of substance and non-substance rewards. 135 Risks Linked to the Environment The environment has been shown to infl uence the probability of developing substance-related or behavioural disorders. Increased vulnerability has been demonstrated in relation to substance abuse for college students. 136 Many heroin addicted Vietnam veterans recovered surprisingly quickly once they found themselves in a different social setting. 137 Beside risk factors, the social environment too offers protective factors such as social support and religiosity . 138 There are also factors beyond social environmental ones. Laws and other norms may impact people's behaviour as well. An increasingly important function of law in the welfare state is the regulation of risks . Gambling regulation constitutes an environmental factor. 139 Yet, gambling regulation may not be the decisive environmental factor as often assumed in calls for regulation; at least, that is what the results of a pan-European study cautiously suggest. 140 Addicts Experience Neuroadaptation, Psychosocial Sequelae and Deviant Behaviour Zinberg stated, \"the experience of addiction diminishes personality differences and makes all compulsive users seem very much alike.\" 141 Addicts share similar experiences. Neuroadaptive processes (tolerance and withdrawal) have been shown for substance-related and behavioural addiction. Tolerance is the experience of the diminution of the sought after effect due to changes of biochemical brain processes. Besides many substance-related forms of addiction, this has been evidenced in the case of gambling disorder too. 142 Pathological gamblers regularly show a need to gamble at increased frequency or dose (higher amounts), and the activity increasingly dominates their schedule. 143 Withdrawal is known in the context of a sudden abstinence from an addictive behavioural pattern. Pathological gamblers show similar withdrawal symptoms as people addicted to substances. 144 Addicts also share common psychosocial sequelae . 145 They experience negative feelings of guilt and shame or mood disorders like dysthymia. Such sequelae have been demonstrated for gambling disorder. Deviant behaviour, social drift and delinquency can regularly be found among addicts. The compulsive nature of addiction is the dominating element in their lives. 146 Delinquency is only a consequence of the addiction since the maintenance of many forms of addictive consumptions or behaviours demands fi nancial means.",

No addict is seeking addiction, but every addict is longing for the positive experience that he initially discovered. 147 Scholarship refers to this experience as the 'desirable subjective shift'. 148 Each addict fi nds something in the addictive behavioural pattern that he engages in and is longing to re-experience this positive effect over and over again. He wishes to capture the bliss of the high that he initially experienced. 149 Khantzian and Albanese concluded that addiction can be described as a form of selfmedication . Human distress and psychological suffering are at the root of addictive disorders. The interaction with objects of addiction can offer relief, sooth, calm and change distress. This emotional effect -not the object as such (sic!) -gives objects of addiction, in a given psychosocial environment, an enormous power to dominate a person's life. Akin to substance use disorders, the authors see behavioural disorders as serving to offer relief from enduring painful feelings. 150 The motives of addicts are all too often neglected. They can be manifold: an adolescent suffering from social exclusion may by engaging in alcohol abuse to seek recognition by his peer group. 151 Elder people may suffer from boredom, and by visiting gambling venues the may experience a decrease in loneliness. These strategies are of course not sustainable and based on the distorted perception that the chosen behaviour only produces positive effects. In this sense, addiction is an undesired side effect of selfmedication .",

A more recent example includes SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome). The view of separate and independent 'addictions' is reminiscent of the view espoused in the early days of AIDS diagnosis. Only an increase of independent, separate diseases was initially noted (for instance, pneumonia and herpes). 190 AIDS was originally associated exclusively with homosexuals before it became known that the disease also affects heterosexuals. AIDS was described as a syndrome with characteristic signs and symptoms -and a yet unknown causality.

While it has reviewed the latter criterion, 195 its reference to the proportionality criterion until recently remained rhetoric . It barely reviewed whether the protection level was high in practice and whether an exclusive right system was necessary to reach the practised protection level. More recently, the Court signifi cantly adjusted its stance; this development could be noted since Carmen Media where it found the monopoly in question no longer suitable to achieve the objective. 196 In Zeturf , it further held that a monopoly could only be justifi ed in order to ensure a particularly high level of protection. It asked the referring court to determine whether the national authorities genuinely sought, at the material time, to ensure a particularly high level of protection and whether -having regard to the level of protection sought -the establishment of a monopoly could actually be considered necessary. 197 The Court of Justice also took a stance in regard to the effectiveness of monopolistic regulatory models in general. It found that an exclusive right holder was \"given the risk of crime and fraud, [.] certainly more effective in ensuring that strict limits are set to the lucrative nature of such activities.\" 198 This is not an isolated statement but refl ects a general tendency of the Court to assume that a monopolistic structure protects consumers more effectively . This view has been reconfi rmed in several judgments. In Markus Stoss , the Court highlighted that the Member States were entitled to take the view, within the margin of discretion which they have in that respect, that granting exclusive rights to a public body whose management is subject to direct State supervision or to a private operator over whose activities the public authorities are able to exercise tight control is likely to enable them to tackle the risks connected with the gambling sector and pursue the legitimate objective of preventing incitement to squander money on gambling and combating addiction to gambling more effectively than would be the case with a system authorising the business of operators which would be permitted to carry on their business in the context of a non-exclusive legislative framework. 199 With regard to the review of monopolistic gambling regimes, the Court of Justice has therefore applied far-reaching self-restraint. 200 It is noteworthy that, according to the Court, it is not necessary that the monopoly is run or owned by public authorities. It may as well be a private monopolist under strict control . 201 In the aforementioned paragraph, the Court expressly recognised that authorities could tackle gambling addiction risks more effectively under a monopolistic structure.",

            "text": "While the Court more recently started to question whether the protection level and controls were in practice truly as high as argued by the Member State, it has abided by the assumption that monopolistic operators protected consumers more effectively. 202 The EFTA Court took a somehow different position than the Court of Justice. In ESA v Norway , it distinguished between crime concerns and gambling addiction concerns. The EFTA Court did not seem convinced of the necessity of a monopoly in relation to crime concerns. While it shared the view of the Court of Justice that a monopoly protects more effectively against gambling addiction, it argued the point differently. It started its argument by referring to the Court of Justice's opinion that public interest objectives had to be 'considered as a whole' 203 and found that it was reasonable to assume that a monopoly operator in the fi eld of gaming machines subject to effective control by the competent public authorities will tend to accommodate legitimate concerns of fi ghting gambling addiction better than a commercial operator or organisations whose humanitarian or socially benefi cial activities partly rely on revenues from gaming machines. Furthermore, it is plausible to assume that in principle the State can more easily control and direct a wholly State-owned operator than private operators. Through its ownership role, the State has additional ways of infl uencing the behaviour of the operator besides public law regulations and surveillance. 204 The Court of Justice accepted it as a reality of life that a monopolistic structure serves consumer protection better. The EFTA Court openly declared that it was taking an assumption ; it further emphasised that \"the effectiveness of public control and enforcement of a genuinely restrictive approach to machine gaming are the focal point of the proportionality assessment in this case.\" 205 The EFTA Court rightly held that -since the legislative reform had not yet taken effect -it could not assume that public control and policy enforcement would not satisfy these requirements. The EFTA Court left the door open in case the assumption should not prove accurate upon the implementation of the Norwegian legislation. In that sense, the ruling takes a Solange character. 206 The standard of review defi ned by the EFTA Court in ESA v Norway has over all been signifi cantly stricter than that applied by the Court of Justice. As seen earlier, the latter originally did not review -nor did it ask the referring court to review -the necessity of gambling monopolies. It only recently started to raise questions in this regard. The EFTA Court prominently underlined the necessity test and the burden of proof : the necessity test consists in an assessment of whether the monopoly option is functionally needed in order to reduce the problems to the level opted for, or whether this reduction could equally well be obtained through other, less restrictive means such as admitting private operators under a stricter licensing regime. The necessity of the contested legislation thus requires that the introduction of a monopoly leads to a more effective achievement of the aims set than other less restrictive measures [\u2026] [T]he Defendant has failed to demonstrate that a licensing scheme allowing private operators, if necessary with more restrictive rules on who may qualify, will not be equally effective as an exclusive right for Norsk Tipping in preventing money-laundering and embezzlement. 207",

It would also be for the national court to evaluate whether effective control could and was in fact exercised by Norwegian authorities over the state monopolist Norsk Tipping. Again, the EFTA Court underlined in this context the principle of the less restrictive measure as the referring court was asked to verify whether private operators under a licensing system could not be subject to the same kind of control. 209 The Court of Justice originally chose not to review the necessity of monopolies.

It remains to be assessed whether this assumption is supported by empirical evidence. A literature review in 2011 established the available empirical evidence regarding the comparative effectiveness of regulatory approaches to gambling . Upon an extent review of the literature relating to this question, the report concluded that there was currently no published empirical evidence available, which would directly address this issue. Consequently, the report also discussed literature that deals with this question only indirectly or that refl ects opinions of scholars. 212 LaBrie and Shaffer for instance argued that effective regulatory approaches must include primary intervention such as public awareness programmes, advertising restrictions and similar preventive measures. They analysed regulation from eleven states in the US and found that only fi ve states addressed primary intervention efforts, including the State of Nevada. 213 Chambers and Wilcox reviewed the level of compliance of online operators with the UK Gambling Act. They assessed the fi fteen most popular UK licensed online gambling operators. All companies complied with the age restrictions and showed careful practices regarding the age limits of their users. 214 A Swiss study compared prevalence levels prior and posterior to the introduction of land-based casino gambling in Switzerland. The regulatory approach changed from an almost full prohibition of casino games to a system with a number of licensees. By this regulatory shift, Switzerland reached one of the highest densities of casinos per capita in Europe. The prevalence rates remained stable upon the introduction of casinos. 215 In general, the discussion about monopolies versus licensing system has received surprisingly little attention in the scientifi c literature on gambling addiction . Empirical scholars have not delivered direct evidence regarding the effectiveness of monopolies or licensing systems. Some publications nevertheless argued approaches that emphasise either more 'informed individual choice' or more 'restrictive state intervention'. It is noteworthy that the authors' preferences correlate with the authors ' views on gambling more broadly . Adams, Orford and Light consider gambling as inherently dangerous, as an 'addictive consumption industry'. They advocate a strict limitation of gambling offers . By contrast, Blaszczynski, Ladouceur, Shaffer and Korn do not perceive gambling as inherently addictive and observe that the majority of people do not develop disordered gambling. They advocate an informed choice approach . 216 The example illustrates that one should not confuse opinions of scholars with conclusive empirical evidence.",

In recent years, the prevalence rates in several countries were stable or decreasing in spite of an increasing exposure to games of chance, including over the Internet.

Scholars from other fi elds may have additional and different arguments to offer. Economists for instance may argue that it is generally accepted that state monopolies perform signifi cantly worse than private operators (including private monopolies) with regard to output (quantity as well as quality, for instance innovation). In this logic, the legislator may wish to install a state monopoly system with the intention to cripple the gambling market. While an economic perspective falls outside the scope of this book, it can be noted that this logic rests at least on two assumptions: fi rst, lower output of gambling offers leads to lower prevalence of gambling addiction, and second, less innovation regarding games of chance leads to lower prevalence of gambling addiction. For some answers from public health and epidemiological research, see Sects. 9.2.4.2 juxtaposition has received little attention among addiction scholars.

The research investigated correlations between different regulatory gambling policies and prevalence rates of disordered gambling . The collected data covered a time frame from 1997 until 2010 in 30 European jurisdictions. Beside other aspects, correlational analyses were run regarding different licensing models (prohibition, public monopoly, closed licensing system, open licensing system, no licence required). No statistically relevant correlations could be identifi ed. In other words, the prevalence rates associated with public monopolies were similar to those associated with other regulatory models. As in other studies, there are limitations to be considered. For instance, sample size was rather small due to the fact that only 22 prevalence studies in twelve jurisdictions were available. The law on the books may not be properly enforced in practice (for instance, prohibition policies), and regulation is only one environmental factor among others that may impact people's behaviour. Most importantly, even if correlations can be found, that does not necessarily mean causation. 218 From an empirical perspective, hardly any research has directly addressed the question of the comparative effectiveness of exclusive right holders versus licensees with regard to gambling addiction. From a legal perspective, the burden of proof in the general law on the fundamental freedoms is with the Member States (see Sect. 3.3 ). However, in the absence of conclusive empirical evidence, the Court of Justice assumed that exclusive right holders were per se more effective in combating gambling addiction. Thus, the Court effectively shifted the burden of proof to the private operators.",

The Court of Justice in turn quoted the Advocate General's position and did not reject it. The Court found it important to distinguish the effects of competition in the market for games of chance, the detrimental nature of which may justify a restriction on the activity of economic operators, from the effects of a call for tenders for the award of the contract in question. The detrimental nature of competition in the market, that is to say, between several operators authorised to operate the same game of chance, arises from the fact that those operators would be led to compete with each other in inventiveness in making what they offer more attractive and, in that way, increasing consumers' expenditure on gaming and the risks of their addiction.",

The aforementioned literature review inquired the comparative effectiveness of regulatory approaches, including that of licensing systems where operators compete for market shares. At that time, no study had directly examined potential detrimental effects of competition in the gambling sector. 231 The results of a subsequent pan-European study could not fi nd statistically relevant differences with regard to the prevalence of disordered gambling associated with state monopolies on the one hand and private licensees on the other. 232 If the assumption regarding competition were accurate, every country with a gambling licensing system should clearly show higher prevalence rates of gambling disorder. The discussion of the epidemiology of gambling disorder in Sect. 9.1.2.2 noted that the data situation of prevalence studies in many European countries is poor. In many jurisdictions either no prevalence study or only one is available. 233 The situation in the UK is better with three national surveys from 1999 to 2010, involving large samples. Globally, North America has the most solid epidemiological data situation to offer. Both the US 234 and the UK 235 have widespread gambling offers. While exclusive right holders operate some games of chance in these countries (mostly, lotteries), competitive licensing systems are prevalent both in the UK and the US for the majority 230 of games of chance . 236 The most recent epidemiological data from these countries do not support the view that a competitive licensing system necessarily leads to increased prevalence of gambling disorder. Petry et al.'s analysis of a large sample from the National Epidemiological Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions (NESARC) found a life-time prevalence rate for gambling disorder of only 0.4 %. 237 Kessler et al.'s analysis found a life-time prevalence rate for gambling disorder of 0.6 %. 238 Competition between operators for market shares and the number of States permitting gambling offers increased over time.

Later on, in Ladbrokes , the Court of Justice also approved this argument in relation to gambling addiction . The authorised operator had to represent an attractive alternative to the black market.

Such inconsistencies may lead to the legislation at issue being unsuitable for achieving the intended objectives. It is for the State to demonstrate that its measures in the fi eld of games of chance fulfi l these requirements. 258 The EFTA Court further addressed the relationship of suitability, advertising and gambling addiction. It found the marketing activities and the development of new games by Norsk Tipping [.] relevant for the assessment of the consistency of the gaming policy. A system of exclusive rights can only be suitable as a means of fi ghting gambling addiction if it is required to operate in a way which serves to limit gaming activities in a consistent and systematic manner [\u2026] . In this context, the development and marketing of addictive games by the monopoly provider are relevant. This may be at odds with the aim of fi ghting gambling addiction. 259 In more recent decisions, the Court of Justice started to review the proportionality of advertising measures more closely. Its approach appears to be infl uenced by some of the aforementioned elements in the jurisprudence of the EFTA Court. The ajustead approach could be noted since Markus Stoss and Carmen Media . In these cases, the referring courts had raised doubts as to the consistency of the policy since the state monopolist on sports betting was engaging in intensive advertising campaigns. 260 In Markus Stoss , the Court alluded to some of the statements of the EFTA Court and found it important that any advertising issued by the holder of a public monopoly remain measured and strictly limited to what is necessary in order thus to channel consumers towards authorised gaming networks. Such advertising cannot, however, in particular, aim to encourage consumers' natural propensity to gamble by stimulating their active participation in it, such as by trivialising gambling or giving it a positive image due to the fact that revenues derived from it are used for activities in the public interest, or by increasing the attractiveness of gambling by means of enticing advertising messages depicting major winnings in glowing colours. 261 According to the Court of Justice, if the national courts noted such developments, the public monopoly could no longer be justifi ed with the objectives of preventing incitement to squander money on gambling and combating gambling addiction. 262 The imcompatible national legislation, establishing the public monopoly, could not continue to apply during a transitional period. 263 This stricter review was mostly reconfi rmed in subsequent decisions 264 -but partly not 265 -and somehow further intensifi ed in Dickinger & \u00d6mer where the referring court expressed doubts regarding the advertising policy of the Austrian lottery monopolist. There were allegations of a continual increase in the advertising expenditure directed to new targets, particularly of young people. The Court of Justice therefore asked the referring court to consider in its proportionality review in particular the scale of advertising and the creation of new games. 266 Importantly, the Court drew a new distinction that should guide the assessment whether the monopolist was going beyond a mere (permitted) channelling of consumers:",

If exposure to gambling was inherently toxic, then increased exposure should lead inevitably to increased levels of morbidity, as would be the case for instance with radiation. 269 In the exposure model , increased gambling exposure should therefore lead to proportionately increased levels of gambling disorder. 270 This model would thus support the theory that an increase of gambling services necessarily leads to higher prevalence rates of gambling disorder.",

A few years later, the pace of the increase had slowed down but was at 2.0 % for life-time gambling disorder (1.35 % past-year). 272 It was already mentioned that the rates found in Canada were very similar to those in the US. 273 Until the beginning of the third millennium, the fi gures suggested two things. Higher exposure to gambling leads to higher participation and gambling disorder rates. The rates had increased . 274 The fast expansion of legalised gambling seemed to be accompanied by an increase in disordered gambling. 275 Considering the massive increase of exposure to games of chance in the US, the increase of disordered gambling could however hardly be proportionate.",

            "text": "Studies at state level also seemed to support this view. In Kallick's 1979 study, the State of Nevada showed a higher rate of gambling disorder than the rest of the US. 276 Today, it appears that there are only two States left that do not allow legalised forms of gambling (Utah, Hawaii). 282 The nationwide spread of casinos starting in the 1990s and the (unlicensed) spread of Internet gambling in more recent years have led to much higher exposure to gambling offers. Kessler's and Petry's nationwide studies show prevalence rates similar to those of Kallick three decades ago when most US states still had anti-gambling legislation in place. The latter had been enacted during the early 1900s. Only in 1964, state lotteries were inaugurated. The nationwide spread of casinos took place starting in the early 1990s, with the State of Nevada (1931) and State of New Jersey (1976) being the exceptions. Already around 1999, casinos were operated in 27 states. 283 The example of the UK is also instructive. It had been suggested that increased access to gambling offers in the UK would cause more disordered gamblers; 284 however, the epidemiological studies do not support this prediction. The 2005 Gambling Act liberalised the UK market and signifi cantly increased the exposure to gambling offers to UK residents. Additional land-based venues opened and private operators were licensed to offer their services via the Internet. The prevalence rates of disordered gambling have remained quite stable . 285 The 1999 study found a rate of 0.7 % (average of two screens) 286 and the 2007 study a rate of 0.55 (average of two screens). 287 In 2010, a rate of 0.8 % (average of two screens) was found and the authors noted that this slight increase was at the margins of statistical signifi cance. 288 Another interesting case study is the State of Nevada . It is by far the most important gambling state in the US. Despite the fact that Macao surpassed Las Vegas in recent years, the latter is still referred to as the gambling capital of the world. 289 . 285 The studies refer to 'problem gambling', but according to the aforementioned defi nitions, this equates to 'disordered gambling'. The three surveys used a threshold of 3 out of 10 DSM-IV criteria (instead of 5 of 10 criteria) or instruments that are similar to this threshold (SOGS). Moreover, their samples included people as of the age of 16 years. As disordered gambling is particularly high around adolescents, the inclusion of minors may impact the prevalence rates. (RIGE), a tool to measure the exposure to gambling for a population in a given region. It takes into account the dose (total number of gambling establishments and employees), potency (number of different types of games) and duration (length of time) of exposure. 290 The exposure to gambling offers in Nevada is around eight times higher than in the second most exposed State of New Jersey. 291 According to the exposure model, Nevadans should have uniquely high prevalence rates of disordered gambling.",

Staff that had been employed for a shorter period showed higher disordered gambling rates than staff that had been employed for a longer period. 295 The aforementioned more recent national, regional and profession-related epidemiological results made it impossible to uphold the exposure model without adjustments. A recent literature review further confi rmed this stance. Living close to gambling venues may increase likelihood to play games of chance, but a relationship with disordered gambling was not consistently found. 296 Therefore, it was necessary to complement the exposure model with a second model: the adaptation model . The adaptation model integrates the aforementioned more recent empirical fi nding. People are capable of adjusting their behaviour over time. 297 The empirical evidence is growing that the two models need to be read in conjunction (see Fig. 9 .4 below). The combined exposure and adaptation models 290 Shaffer, LaBrie, and LaPlante, \"Laying the Foundation for Quantifying Regional Exposure to Social Phenomena: Considering the Case of Legalized Gambling as a Public Health Toxin\". 291 Ibid. 292 Ibid. suggest that an initial infection (by gambling offers) results in increased levels of disordered gambling. Adaptation mechanisms fi rst slow down the increase of infections and subsequently stabilise and lower the prevalence of disordered gambling. Hence, populations unfamiliar with gambling offers (immature markets) may fi rst experience a substantial infection before recovering from the exposure. By contrast, populations that are already familiar with gambling offers or certain types of gambling, may have eventually adapted to this environmental factor ( Fig. 9.4 ) .",

A recent literature review assessed the empirical evidence regarding the extent to which advertising impacts the propensity of gambling disorder . 310 A discussion on this topic should start by acknowledging the complexity of measuring this relationship. There are classic problems such as measuring the counterfactual or the difference between self-assessment (questionnaire) and actual behaviour. In addition, the endeavour is further complicated by the fact that advertising may impact both conscious and sub-conscious levels. Bass noted in the 1960s, \"there is no more diffi cult, complex, or controversial problem in marketing than measuring the infl uence of advertising on sales.\" 311 While it is complex to show associations between advertising and sales, it is even more complex to show associations between advertising and gambling disorder . Binde accurately described these problems. 312 Upon recognition of the complexity of the exercise, Binde concluded that there was no reliable evidence regarding the impact of gambling advertising on gambling disorder. He also concluded that the overall impact on the general population was likely to be rather small. He argued that a differentiation between different markets was necessary. In a competitive licensing market, advertising is likely to affect the size of market share of competitors. In a monopolistic market by contrast, advertising is likely to affect the total sales in that market. The impact of advertising in mature markets is likely to be different from young markets. In the latter, advertising efforts for games of chance may increase the overall participation rate of a population; by contrast, advertising effects in a mature market may fade out. It may mainly lead to shifts between different operators or products (substitution effect). 313 Recent prevalence data from the UK provide some support for this view. As a consequence of a liberalisation of the gambling sector by the 2005 Gambling Act, gambling advertising has arguably expanded significantly in recent years. If the impact of advertising upon gambling behaviour of the general population were indeed big, a significant increase in gambling participation should take place. If advertising led to increased levels of gambling disorder, a signifi cant increase of those rates should also be noted. The participation rates in games of chance in 2010 were a return to those observed in 1999, and prevalence rates of gambling disorder remained quite stable over the last decade. 314 Binde noted more generally that countries with a sudden advertising increase or decrease did not report signifi cant changes in disordered gambling rates. 315",

Relying on the North American situation, they also argue that gambling is regularly portrayed and perceived by adolescents as a harmless and credible activity and as an alternative to hard work . Studies conducted in the 1990s found that a big share of the gambling advertising in the US and Canada was misleading. 325 Further content analysis studies confi rmed that gambling advertising in North America aired at times or in programmes attractive to youth. Messages often inter alia related to taking shortcuts to success and quick fi xes to problems (escape). While responsible gambling messages often accompanied the adverts, they could only get marginal attention as they were often shown only in very small print. 326 Distorted personal imagination can therefore be reinforced by deliberate deception. 327",

It considered the scale of advertising and -by way of quoting parties to the case -the (young) age of consumers targeted by the advertising. It differentiated between (restrained) informative versus (expensionist) encouraging advertising. 330 The empirical evidence provides support for at least some of the Court of Justice's considerations. It was shown that advertising has a signifi cant effect on certain population groups . It can create or reinforce distorted views on gambling among adolescents. Therefore, inciting advertising can have different effects than informative messaging on the perception of gambling among adolescents. Studies further suggest that advertising functions as a trigger to gamble that is hard to resist for some disordered gamblers.

Until recently, the Court of Justice focused on the encouragement/ incitement component of advertising. Only in Dickinger & \u00d6mer the Court started to contrast these forms with policies seeking to inform consumers. The available empirical evidence suggests that this aspect is central, namely that people exposed to advertising -particularly adolescents -get informed about the chances and risks of gambling. Advertising that invites people to gamble or the fact that people hold positive views towards gambling is not per se something that will necessarily lead to higher prevalence of gambling disorder. An advertising policy becomes detrimental where it fails to strengthen the awareness of harmful effects of gambling. 331 What seems to matter is the overall perception of gambling , namely whether consumers of a given jurisdiction receive a balanced picture of gambling. They must also be aware of the risks that gambling involves. 332 Regulators can opt for different ways to achieve effective information of consumers and specifi cally vulnerable groups on gambling-related risks: counter-advertising messages can be included in advertising, authorities may run public education programmes or advertising possibilities may be restricted or prohibited. In this author's view, it makes little sense to allow for unrestricted advertising in terms of volume and message content followed by an attempt to counter-balance it with (costly) public education programmes . Where the legislator allows the advertising of activities that involve signifi cant risks for consumers, it also takes up a certain responsibility 333 -irrespective of the actual regulatory model that it chooses (monopoly, limited or liberal licensing system).",

First, more addictive games may justify stricter limitations of fundamental freedoms. Government counsels would accordingly have an interest in pleading this point. Secondly, the criterion of a 'consistent and systematic' policy may require that the operation of addictive games is regulated more strictly than that of less or non-addictive games. Questions may arise where an addictive game is strongly advertised or substantially expanded, and at the same time, market access is also denied in relation to non-addictive games. Depending on the constellation, counsels for private operators may have an interest in making this point.

In Gambelli , the Court of Justice had started to review the proportionality of national measures. Noting this shift of the review practice, the EFTA Court reviewed the Norwegian gambling regime closely. The direct action ESA v Norway concerned exclusively the sector of slot machines (gaming machines). The new legislation intended to nationalise the sector that was formerly run under a licensing system with charities. The agents for the Norwegian government pointed to gaming machines as the single most addictive game. The EFTA Court followed that argumentation and found gaming machines to be more addictive than other games. 336 [S]tudies in the fi eld of gambling presented to the Court point at gaming machines as the single most potentially addictive form of gambling. These studies refer, inter alia, to the structural characteristics of the machines, such as rapid event frequency, the near miss, and light and sound effects. 337 According to the interpretation of these studies, gambling disorder had occurred in Norway simultaneously with the increase of gambling on gaming machines. The large majority of an addiction helpline had reported problems with gaming machines. 338 These fi ndings served to justify the nationalisation of the slot machine sector.",

A recent lawsuit against Loto Qu\u00e9bec was based on the 337 Ibid., para. 45. 338 Ibid., para. 45. 339 E-3/06 Ladbrokes Ltd. v the Government of Norway, Ministry of Culture and Church Affairs and the Government of Norway, Ministry of Agriculture and Food [2007] EFTA Court Report 86, para. 54. 340 Ibid., para. 57. argument that manufacturers and operators composed gaming machines in a way to make people addicted. 343 Features like rapid visual and sound effects may indeed have a potential to entice and stimulate a continuation to play on the machine. 344 It is also possible that many at-risk gamblers fi nd more reward in EGM gaming than in other types of games. Several prevalence studies suggest that EGM's are amongst the preferred gambling activities of pathological gamblers. 345 It should be noted that a high correlation was found where EGM's were located outside of casinos such as in bars. 346 The social environment , including drinking habits, may signifi cantly differ between bars and casinos and thus impact differently on people's behaviour. Recently, Disley et al. provided an extent literature review of research into structural features of gaming machines. The authors concluded that the available evidence was very limited; it was not clear whether electronic gaming machines contributed to the development and maintenance of disordered gambling. 347 Section 9.1.3 described the interplay of different factors in the development of addiction. It showed that there is ample evidence for object non-specifi city of addiction, that is, the role of the object is not as important as often assumed in the past. The aetiology of gambling addiction is indeed complex. The public health model of disease transmission in Sect. 9.1.3.2 illustrated that addiction develops in a complex interplay of host (gambler), agent (games) and environmental factors (for example, socio-economic factors). The EFTA Court alluded to this interplay of various factors in its ruling in ESA v Norway :",

The aetiology of addiction, however, is so complex that not even the leading experts of the fi eld have fi nal answers as to the causation in the emergence of addiction. 350 Operators certainly have an economic interest in offering games that are attractive to gamblers. Very different, however, is the assumption that operators can create machines that make people addicted.",

The topic of Internet gambling was not expressly dealt with until Liga Portuguesa . 354 In that case, the Court of Justice held that games of chance accessible via the Internet involved different and more substantial risks of fraud. 355 The Court of Justice reaffi rmed that statement in Sporting Exchange . 356 It also applied a very lenient proportionality review in relation to questions concerning the Internet. In Markus Stoss , the Court added that diffi culties in ensuring compliance with the strict limitations of a monopoly due to the transnational nature of the Internet could not as such call into question the conformity of measures with EU law. 357 The statement that online gambling involves different and more substantial risks of fraud does not necessarily lead to the conclusion that this is also the case for risks of gambling disorder. It was in Carmen Media that the Court of Justice extended its critical opinion about the medium Internet also to health risks: the characteristics specifi c to the offer of games of chance by the internet may prove to be a source of risks of a different kind and a greater order in the area of consumer protection, particularly in relation to young persons and those with a propensity for gambling or likely to develop such a propensity, in comparison with traditional markets for such games. Apart from the lack of direct contact between the consumer and the operator, previously referred to, the particular ease and the permanence of access to games offered over the internet and the potentially high volume and frequency of such an international offer, in an environment which is moreover characterised by isolation of the player, anonymity and an absence of social control, constitute so many factors likely to foster the development of gambling addiction and the related squandering of money, and thus likely to increase the negative social and moral consequences attaching thereto, as underlined by consistent case-law. 358 Before the Court of Justice's decision in Carmen Media , the EFTA Court had expressed concerns in relation to online gambling in its judgment in EFTA-Ladbrokes . It had held that channelling measures could be suitable if they were envisaged to draw players away from addictive games via the Internet or other hard to suppress channels. 359 The Court of Justice left a very wide margin of appreciation to national authorities in relation to online games and did de facto not review the proportionality of the measures in this regard. The German ban on online gambling, even though with certain temporary exceptions, was found suitable to pursue the objective of combating gambling addiction and in particular of protecting young persons. 360 Notably, the Court of Justice has not altered its view on Internet gambling in recent judgments. 361 Finally, it should be noted that the ECtHR adopted the Court of Justice's critical stance on Internet gambling. The ECtHR quoted from the case law regarding the compatibility of the State Treaty of the German L\u00e4nder with EU law. After a lengthy quote from the Carmen Media judgment, the ECtHR almost literally adopted the wording in relation to the 'different and more substantial' dangers of Internet gambling. 362",

Internet gambling is a recent phenomenon , with the biggest growth only taking place in the last decade. 363 In the early days of online gambling, most websites based their operations in Caribbean and Central American jurisdictions. Certain autonomous tribal jurisdictions became key players in the online gambling business: in 2007 for instance, the Kahnawake Mohawk Territory in Quebec hosted the highest number of online gambling websites (377 websites). 364 This new phenomenon has raised signifi cant concerns that Internet gambling will lead to sharply increased levels of gambling disorder. The fears are not surprising as a couple of factors explain their presence. First, games of chance over the Internet have only been professionally commercialised for slightly more than a decade . Empirical research is much younger than on land-based gambling, and their impact on the prevalence of disordered gambling still needs to be followed up in long-term studies. Second, though the online share of the gambling industry is still clearly smaller, it is rapidly growing and at much higher rates than land-based gambling. Third, online gambling aliments concerns in a double manner: the services not only relate to gambling but in addition to the medium Internet . The latter in itself aliments disputes over the opportunities and risks of this new technology, in particular for youth. 365 Popular media may report about 'Internet addicts' who spend several days in front of the Internet. The combination of those factors unsurprisingly nourishes fears about an uncontrollable spread of gambling addiction.",

Until recently, there were no empirical results available from studies comparing the effectiveness of different regulatory approaches towards online gambling. 366 Most recently, a study could not fi nd statistically signifi cant differences of prevalence rates between prohibitive and permissive regulatory approaches towards online gambling. 367 In the absence of further studies that analyse the comparative effectiveness of regulatory approaches, a series of national prevalence rates from one country can also offer helpful indications. In the UK, the 2005 Gambling Act introduced an open licensing system for online operators . The Act also allows under certain conditions foreign operators to operate gambling offers to UK residents. While the effective exposure to online games has not been measured, many authors argued that exposure to games of chance increased in the UK with the liberalisation of the gambling market and predicted signifi cantly increased levels of gambling disorder. 368 Recent epidemiological research from the UK does not support such signifi cant increase. 369 In fact, the three prevalence studies from the UK 370 show quite stable prevalence rates of gambling disorder over several years.",

Regarding some limitations of the study, see also Sect. 9.2.2.2 i.f. estimated that the global market share of US residents was one quarter to one third in 2008, corresponding to about $5-6 billion. Moreover, the US is home to more online gambling websites than any other country. Only the domain ownership is American while the servers are generally located off-shore. 371 Sparrow even argued that the addition of US licensed operators would hardly alter the already present ubiquity of online games of chance and that regulation would bring clear advantages such as increased control. 372 In a survey conducted by the American Gaming Association, only 19 % indicated that they were aware that online gambling was currently illegal in the US. 373 Even before the new millennium, it was predicted that Internet gambling would be impossible to stop by regulation. 374 Upon analysing various regulatory approaches, other authors also concluded that regulating online gambling might be a more effective way than a prohibitionist approach. 375 The widespread popularity of online gambling in the US has not translated into an increase of rates of gambling disorder . The development of the prevalence of gambling disorder in the US was described in Sect. 9.2.5.2 . The most recent nation-wide epidemiological studies found decreasing levels of gambling disorder. Petry et al. found life-time gambling disorder at a rate of 0.4% 376 and Kessler et al. at a level of 0.6 %. 377 This was at a time when online gambling services had been available already for several years and the volume of offers rapidly growing. 378",

Popular media often refer to the term 'addiction' in relation to the Internet rather easily; anecdotal reports may leave the layperson with the impression that Internet addiction is a mass phenomenon. There have been efforts to defi ne diagnostic criteria for Internet addiction. 381 Young suggested an eight-item screen whose diagnostic criteria were adapted from those of gambling disorder; Young sees gambling disorder as most akin to the pathological nature of Internet use. 382 Popular media sometimes report fi gures on the prevalence of Internet and similar 'addictions'. 383 In the absence of commonly accepted diagnostic criteria these fi gures need to be dealt with very carefully. It is not surprising that many reports do not appear in peer-reviewed journals. Different reports may measure different things with some reports looking into addiction to computers, 384 the Internet, 385 video games 386 or online games. 387 What is more, certain publications simply include under the term Internet addiction online and offl ine computer usage. 388 The term is unclear as it may refer to being addicted to the medium as such (generalised addictive use) or to certain content like pornography or gambling (specifi c addictive use). 389 Other publications suggest a three-fold distinction into gaming, sexual preoccupations and e-mail/text messaging. 390 Upon a review of the available literature, scholars have identifi ed signifi cant methodological defi cits in many studies that intended to provide evidence for the harmfulness of the Internet. The defi cits include for instance inconsistent criteria or inadequate recruiting methods of participants. 391 384 Cf. hereto e.g. suggested criteria that simply merge 'computer and Internet addiction' into one category:",

According to the work group on substance-related disorders, other behavioural forms of addiction will be considered for integration in the DSM as research data accumulate ; 394 the evidence is currently not considered solid enough. 395 The DSM-5 task force decided, however, to include 'Internet gaming disorder' in the separate Section III among 'conditions for further studies'. These conditions are not recognised mental health disorders and the provisionally suggested diagnostic criteria are not intended for clinical use.

Other expressions of excessive Internet use, such as relating to sex websites, are not included either. The proposed disorder typically involves individuals who devote eight to ten hours or more per day to Internet gaming and often go for long periods without food or sleep. Contrary to Internet gambling, no money is being wagered in relation to Internet gaming. 398 In the absence of solid evidence on Internet-related disorders and the proposed Internet gaming disorder only being of provisional nature, it is advisable to resort to the general knowledge that the scientifi c literature has gathered on addiction . Section 9.1.5 showed that an extent review of the literature led scientists to describe addiction as a syndrome with some object-specifi c expressions, various shared manifestations and common aetiology. Studies regarding the behaviour of disordered Internet users seem to confi rm shared manifestations. Sun et al. found that their ability of decision-making was diminished; the subjects experienced diffi culties in balancing immediate rewards versus long-term detrimental consequences. 399 This is reminiscent of pathological gamblers 400 and people engaging in substance use disorders. 401 Research generally shows that the preference for a smaller-sooner over a larger-later reward is an important component of impulsivity. This phenomenon is called 'discounting': the value of the larger-later reward is subjectively discounted because there is a delay until its delivery. 402 According to the syndrome model, disordered Internet use may be yet another expression of the same underlying pathological condition. However, the evidence base fi rst needs to become more solid. Not every excessive Internet use should immediately be labelled 'addiction'. 397 Ibid., at 795.

            "text": "Following these considerations on 'Internet addiction', the focus of the inquiry can come back to online gambling and the risks of gambling disorder that it involves. The impact of online gambling can be studied in different approaches. One way is to analyse the development of prevalence rates of disordered gambling . The examples of the UK and the US were briefl y discussed as both these countries offer a series of epidemiological studies. Another way is to study actual online gambling behaviour of players . It was argued in the literature that certain factors associated with online gambling would lead to a greater risk of developing gambling addiction: permanent and convenient ease of access, the interactivity of the game or the asocial component of online gambling, that is, the anonymity and isolation of the player. 403 While the fi eld of study of online gambling is still young, several publications have analysed actual gambling behaviour of consumers playing on online gambling websites. Cunningham et al. correctly noted that it was a challenge but also a necessity to determine the demographic characteristics of online gamblers without invading their privacy. 404 Researchers at the Division on Addiction have studied large data samples of ten thousands of online players while respecting their privacy. 405 These studies are a shift of paradigm in that analysis has moved from self-reporting to observing actual gambling behaviour . 406 However, self-reporting may still be needed to establish the actual existence and extent of disordered gambling. 407 According to these publications, the large majority of the studied online gamblers played very moderately , both in terms of wagered money and time spent gambling. A prospective longitudinal study of sports betting during 8 months analysed the betting behaviour of around 25,000 live-action bettors and 40,000 fi xed-odds bettors. 408 The median betting behaviour for the two types of betting was to place 2.5 bets (fi xed-odds) and 2.8 bets respectively (life-action) of 4 Euros every fourth day. 409 The authors concluded that the empirical data from this study did not support the speculation that gambling over the Internet had an inherent propensity to encourage excessive gambling. 410 The large sample further showed that only a small percentage demonstrated discontinuously high values regarding several measures. This was the case for around 1 % of the players in relation to the following measures: number of bets, bets per day, Euros per bet, total wagered and net loss. Interestingly, the top 1 % heavily involved of one measure were not necessarily among the top 1 % of another measure. In other words, somebody who may be among the top 1 % in terms of Euros per bet was not necessarily among the top 1 % of number of bets. This means that even among the heavily involved, players found strategies to moderate their behaviour. 411 Subsequent studies on other types of games confi rmed that even among the most heavily involved players, many moderated their gambling behaviour over time. For Internet poker, the heavily involved sub-group was 5 %. After a while, both the most involved and the rest of the sample reduced Euros per poker session as well as Euros wagered in total as losses increased. 412 These facts show that even among the top 5 % poker players, moderation strategies were applied. Another study with sports bettors found a lesser developed capacity to moderate behaviour among the heavily involved bettors, in particular in relation to live-action bets. 413 While potential online-specifi c risks need to be addressed, the medium Internet can also be used to offer safeguards , which land-based gambling cannot provide to the same extent. As any new technology, the Internet brings both challenges and opportunities . 414 It is fairly normal that fears over challenges and risks are fi rst being voiced before opportunities and safeguards are discovered. If the opportunities of the Internet are adequately implemented, they hold the potential to lead to true shifts 409 Ibid. 410 Ibid., at 358. 411 of paradigm, including in the legal fi eld. 415 If regulators rely on sound research, additional safeguards may soon be available. 416 Deposit limits or temporary account closures could prove to be effective social responsibility instruments. 417 If, in the future, such tools are combined with early identifying behavioural markers for disordered gambling, they could prove to be more effective. 418 Recent publications have identifi ed such early markers; 419 they hold the potential to indicate how self-limitations or account closures 420 may be most effectively used. 421 Online gamblers need to be further studied. They may differ from land-based gamblers in relation to their motivation to gamble. Considering the advantages and disadvantages, which the Internet brings, it is hardly surprising that online and land-based gamblers can be motivated by different aspects of the game. They can also have different socioeconomic backgrounds. In an Australian study, land-based gamblers and online gamblers indicated overall different motivations for gambling. Land-based gamblers were more likely to gamble for charity, the atmosphere and excitement. They indicated that it was their favourite activity or simply saw it as a social activity. They also showed greater belief in luck. By contrast, online gamblers were more likely to see online gambling as more exciting and convenient than land-based gambling. It could be played anytime and in a private setting. They estimated the changes of winning to be better, saw it as less dangerous and could choose to stop gambling any time. Online gamblers saw greater benefi ts from gambling online than off-line. 422",

            "text": "The gambling sector has not been harmonised at the European level. The question arises to which extent there is an obligation for the host state to recognise regulatory standards of the home state. Alternatively, the question may also be to which extent authorities have to take into account controls that have already been exercised by other authorities. This question arose in Placanica . When assessing the necessity of the national restrictions, Advocate General Colomer advocated that the principles of mutual recognition should apply in the case. In his view, national authorities should recognise the requirements imposed and controlled by another Member State as suffi cient. There was no reason to apply double checks. 423 The Court of Justice, however, did not follow his opinion. 424 The question re-emerged in Liga Portuguesa , Sporting Exchange and Markus Stoss . In the former two cases, the Court of Justice made it clear that there was no obligation to mutually recognise authorisations in the area of gambling. The motivation was that games of chance via the Internet had not been harmonised in the Union and involved different and more substantial risks than land-based games of chance. 425 In relation to the land-based forms of games of chance, the Court's argumentation was similar. While it also noted the lack of harmonisation, it expressly referred to the margin of appreciation that Member States enjoyed in this area. 426 According to the Court, mutual recognition could only play a role in one situation: only if the monopolies at issue in the main proceedings were held incompatible with Article [49 TFEU] or Article [56 TFEU] would the question as to the possible existence of such an obligation of mutual recognition of authorisations issued in other Member States be capable of having any relevance for the purposes of resolving the disputes in the main proceedings. 427 Considering the wide margin of appreciation that the Court of Justice has applied in relation to gambling services, the non-applicability of the principle of mutual recognition is not surprising. Since the Court of Justice had conceded that it was up to each Member State to defi ne the objectives of its gambling policy as well as the protection level, (unlimited) mutual recognition would indeed be a far-reaching step. There are benefi ts and costs to consider for governments. 428 Some Member States may primarily profi t from the benefi ts of online gambling (tax revenues) while others may end up with the social costs , namely gambling-related harm . Eventually, this point will need to be discussed. 429 Surprising was the rationale that the Court of Justice used to argue its conclusion. The Court chose in Liga Portuguesa an unconventional approach. The Portuguese government argued that it did not have the same means of control in relation to a foreign operator, such as Bwin, as it had in relation to its own operator Santa Casa. 430 From a Member State's perspective, this is a valid point to argue. The Court's reply to this concern was unexpected since it did not address the pleaded diffi culties of the host state (Portugal) but the diffi culties of the state of establishment (sic!) to control its licensees. According to the Court, the Portuguese government could take the view that the quality assessment by the authorities of another Member State did not suffi ciently assure consumer protection in the light of the diffi culties liable to be encountered in such a context by the authorities of the Member State of establishment in assessing the professional qualities and integrity of operators [such as Bwin]. 431 The unconventional phrasing of the Court's argument leaves two options: either it was a mistake or an obiter dictum . A mistake can be argued with a systematic reading of the decision. The Court's reply does not address the concerns that were argued by the Portuguese government. Indeed, the Court of Justice started its 'reply' to the argument of the Portuguese government with \" in that regard , it should be noted that the sector involving games of chance offered via the internet has not been 427 the subject of Community harmonisation.\" 432 Consequently, the question would logically be whether the Portuguese authorities could validly rely on the alleged diffi culties of assessment on the Portuguese side .",

            "text": "The second option is that of an obiter dictum . In that case, the question pertains to the rationale behind the statement. The Court's remark is far-reaching as it alludes to severe diffi culties that the authorities of the states of establishment face in assessing their licensees. Was the Court of Justice trying to tell national authorities (for example, in Malta and the UK) that they were facing almost insurmountable diffi culties in assessing their licensees? 433 The Court of Justice has occasionally acted as 'national legislator' in favour of the Single Market. 434 The opposite is unheard of. An additional element to argue the obiter dictum alternative is the fact that the Court of Justice repeated the same statement in subsequent cases. 435 The approach of the Court of Justice to mutual recognition in the gambling sector can be summarised as follows. If the national monopoly or licensing model is found to be compatible with EU law, there is no space to apply the principle of mutual recognition , both in relation to land-based and online games. In the negative case, this still does not automatically mean that national authorities could not require a foreign operator to seek a national licence nor does it mean that a Member State has to liberalise its gambling market. Due to the primacy of EU law, a transitional period cannot apply, but the Member State is free to reform its monopoly to make it compatible with EU law. The Court of Justice refrained from offering further indications for this latter situation. 436 ",

If the national court found the restrictions to be lawful, the host state had the right to preclude foreign operators. If by contrast the restrictions were not justifi ed, \"national authorities may still require foreign operators to seek a national licence under the same conditions that apply to domestic operators.\" 437 Due to the lack of harmonisation \"different levels of protection may exist throughout the EEA.

The Court found that the failure to invite competing bids infringed the general principle of transparency, in particular the obligation to ensure a suffi cient degree of advertising towards potential tenderers. Since this case was a direct action against an evident infringement , the judgment did not reveil much about the Court's proportionality review practice. The measure was not even suitable: the Italian government could not explain how the simple renewal of the existing licences served the public interest objective of preventing clandestine betting activities. 456 As noted earlier, the Court's remarks in the subsequent Sporting Exchange decision were highly ambiguous. 457 It was only in the later German and Austrian cases that the review practice became clearer. According to the facts in Carmen Media , the competent German authorities had discretion as to whether they would grant an administrative authorisation or not. Even though there was a de facto monopolistic system in place, the authorities enjoyed discretion to provide for additional authorisations. As a consequence, the Court held: if a prior administrative authorisation scheme is to be justifi ed, even though it derogates from a fundamental freedom, it must be based on objective, non-discriminatory criteria known in advance, in such a way as to circumscribe the exercise of the authorities' discretion so that it is not used arbitrarily. Furthermore, any person affected by a restrictive measure based on such a derogation must have an effective judicial remedy available to them. 458 In the Austrian case Engelmann , the Court had to address the question whether it was compatible with EU law to oblige potential licensees to adopt the legal form of a public limited company and to have their company seat in Austria.

It raised doubts that public policy could serve as justifi cation ground since this concept needed to be narrowly construed and required a genuine and suffi ciently serious threat to a fundamental interest of society. It asked the referring court to ascertain whether there were other less restrictive means to ensure the supervision of operators. The Court noted that national law, which awards concessions based on the criterion of maximising public revenue , systematically works to the disadvantage of foreign operators and could not be regarded as compatible with EU law. It also held that no public interest objective was pleaded to justify the requirement that the holder of the concession was not allowed to set up branches outside Austria. 461 In relation to the mandatory legal form of a capital company the Court reconfi rmed its position from the Engelmann judgment that such requirement could be justifi ed by the objectives of preventing money laundering and fraud. In relation to the requirement of a paid-up nominal or share capital of EUR 109,000,000, the Court of Justice reminded that restrictions could not go beyond what was necessary for achieving the aim pursued.

            "text": "A major aspect on which the Court of Justice has insisted in relation to licensing tenders is the obligation of transparency . In Engelmann , it stated that, in spite of the lack of applicable secondary law, the obligation of transparency fully applied in relation to gambling licenses or concessions: the public authorities which grant such concessions are none the less bound to comply with the fundamental rules of the Treaties, in particular Articles [49 TFEU] and [56 TFEU], and with the consequent obligation of transparency [\u2026] . Without necessarily implying an obligation to call for tenders, that obligation of transparency, which applies when the service concession in question may be of interest to an undertaking located in a Member State other than that in which the concession is granted, requires the concession-granting authority to ensure, for the benefi t of any potential tenderer, a degree of publicity suffi cient to enable the service concession to be opened up to competition and the impartiality of the award procedures to be reviewed [\u2026] . The grant of a concession, in the absence of any transparency, to an operator located in the Member State of the awarding authority constitutes a difference in treatment to the detriment of operators located in other Member States, who have no real possibility of manifesting their interest in obtaining the concession in question. Such a difference in treatment is contrary to the principle of equal treatment and the prohibition of discrimination on grounds of nationality, and constitutes indirect discrimination on grounds of nationality prohibited by Articles [49 TFEU] and [56 TFEU], unless it is justifi ed by objective circumstances [\u2026] . The fact that the issue of licences to operate gaming establishments may not be the same as a service concession contract does not, in itself, justify any failure to have regard to the requirements arising from Article [56 TFEU], in particular the principle of equal treatment and the obligation of transparency [\u2026] . Indeed, the obligation of transparency amounts to a condition which must be met before a Member State can exercise its right to award licences to operate gaming establishments, irrespective of the method of selecting operators, because the effects of the award of such licences on undertakings which are established in other Member States and potentially interested in engaging in that activity are the same as those of a service concession contract. 463 These statements clarifi ed earlier remarks of the Court. In Sporting Exchange , it had fi rst given the impression that these requirements would apply to any licensing procedure, because the detrimental nature of competition in the gambling market needed to be distinguished from the positive nature of a competitive call for tenders. 464 Despite this statement about the positive effects of a competitive tender procedure, the Court found in the next sentence that the requirements of equal treatment and transparency did not apply if the Member State concerned decides to grant a licence to, or renew the licence of, a public operator whose management is subject to direct State supervision or a private operator whose activities are subject to strict control by the public authorities. 465 This interpretation left the question unanswered whether the Dutch licensees satisfi ed those conditions. It was left to the referring Raad van State to decide upon this issue. That court subsequently found that the relationship between De Lotto (sports-betting licensee) and Scientifi c Games Racing (horseracing licensee) and the Dutch state did not meet the requirement of a relationship characterised by a suffi ciently strict control. Therefore, the obligation of transparency had not been respected. The Raad van State found the relevant licensing procedure incompatible with EU law. 466 The Services Directive does not apply to gambling services (see Sect. 4.2.9 ). Nonetheless, the Court of Justice has insisted in relation to licensing procedures on elements, namely transparency and non-discrimination, which can be found in the Services Directive. The Court derives those obligations from the fundamental Treaty rules. Similar to the Directive, which does not apply to exclusive right holders, the Court does not impose the aforementioned obligations on gambling (public or private) monopolies under direct state supervision or subject to strict control by the state.",

            "text": "The judgment in Costa & Cifone reconfi rmed the aforementioned obligations imposed by the case law. 467 The case related to the re-distribution of betting licenses in Italy. The formerly applicable licensing system had been found in breach of EU law and had excluded a category of operators from the award of licences. The Italian government sought to remedy that breach by putting out to tender a signifi cant number of new licences. Meanwhile, it protected the market positions acquired by the existing operators, as it required new licensees to observe a minimum distance to establishments of existing operators. Restating its case law, the Court reminded the principles of equivalence, effectiveness, equal treatment, non-discrimination and the obligation of transparency . In the cases at hand, the principle of equal treatment required that all potential tenderers be afforded equality of opportunity and accordingly implies that all tenderers must be subject to the same conditions. This is especially the case in a situation such as that in the cases before the referring court, in which a breach of EU law on the part of the licensing authority concerned has already resulted in unequal treatment for some operators. 468 In fact, the existing operators had already been able to establish themselves on the market with a certain reputation and a measure of customer loyalty. Imposing a minimum distance on new licensees would offer existing operators an even greater competitive advantage. This would result in a new breach of EU law, namely of the principle of effectiveness and the principle of non-discrimination. 469 In sum, the Court of Justice has distinguished in its case law two situations between which the standard of review differs. First, the state provides one operator with the exclusive right to provide (certain types of) gambling services and exercises strict control on this single (state or private) operator. In such situation, the usual requirements of non-discrimination and transparency, as laid down in the case law on services concessions, do not apply and the Court hardly practises a proportionality review. Second, the aforementioned conditions are not fulfi lled , that is, the law allows for several licensees or the control over the exclusive right holder is not suffi ciently strict. In this latter case, the procedural requirements of non-discrimination and transparency apply and the Court of Justice is inclined to closely review the proportionality of the national gambling regime. The requirements applying in the two distinct situations must not be confused. 470",

Gambling is not a core case of public morality. With regard to crime as justifi cation ground, it will be for other authors to verify whether fraud, embezzlement and money laundering in relation to gambling activities are somehow peculiar. 471 The approach of the EFTA Court did at least not seem to support such view. 472 The idea of gambling or gambling addiction being of peculiar nature has been refuted. The detailed empirical views on the case law showed that gambling addiction is not of peculiar nature. The wide margin of appreciation and the lenient proportionality review practised by the Court of Justice are special. The analysis showed that the Court's review practice deviated from the general criteria of the doctrine on the margin of appreciation. Its early case law also signifi cantly differed from that of the EFTA Court, but the Court of Justice has adjusted its approach in recent decisions. The lenient review of the Court of Justice prompted Lein to rhetorically ask whether the Court's review in the fi eld of gambling constituted a gamble. 473 Other scholars concluded that the Court of Justice's use of the margin of appreciation and its review practice led to a virtual dismantling of the Internal Market requirements in the fi eld of gambling. 474 This section compares the approach chosen by the Court of Justice in the gambling cases with closely related fi elds (Sect. 9.3.1 ). It discusses cases that involved concerns in relation to addiction and to the Internet since the Court has applied a particularly lenient proportionality review in relation to these two dimensions of gambling.

The Court of Justice has dealt with restrictions that are based on policies aiming at preventing addiction. The fi ght against alcohol addiction was at the heart of several cases. The Swedish case Rosengren is used here to illustrate the Court's approach. This case is particularly suitable for comparative purposes since it involved concerns in relation to adolescents . As it was shown, this population group has a higher vulnerability to addictive disorders. The case regarded 'Systembolaget', the Swedish alcohol retailing system. In Sweden, the law ('alkohollagen') confers a state monopoly over retail sales of wine, strong beer and spirits to a company constituted for that purpose. 475 The appellants in the main proceedings had ordered cases of Spanish wine by way of correspondence. The cases were confi scated by the Swedish customs as the alcohol order should have been processed through Systembolaget.

( 2007 ) . Prior to the Rosengren decision, the Court had already held that Member States could themselves decide what degree of protection they wished to ensure within the limits of the Treaties, 477 and recognised that legislation aiming to control the consumption of alcohol in order to prevent detrimental effects refl ected health and public policy concerns in Article 36 TFEU. 478 Similar to the gambling case law, the Court referred to the national restrictions as 'channelling' measures.

People placing orders through Systembolaget had to be at least 20 years of age. Under this age, alcohol could also not be imported by individuals. The protection of the health of adolescents constitutes a particularly legitimate argument and fi nds support in empirical evidence. It was shown that this age group features increased vulnerability to gambling disorder and substance use disorders (see Sect. 9.1.3.5 ). 480 The Court approved the aim of preventing younger persons from purchasing alcohol; this aim ultimately served to reduce the health risk in relation to alcohol consumption. Nevertheless, the Court reminded that it was for the state to show that 477 the measures were proportionate. This would not be the case if the objective could be achieved by less restrictive measures. The general Swedish prohibition to import alcohol by way of correspondence, irrespective of the age of the purchaser, went beyond what was necessary to achieve the objective.",

The restrictions were based on public health grounds, namely that medicine may be incorrectly used and services of online pharmacies abused. In Ker-Optika , the Court of Justice referred on several occasions to its DocMorris decision and confi rmed the approach chosen in the earlier case. The Court distinguished between two kinds of medicine: the fi rst requiring prescription and the second not requiring prescription. It held that an absolute, undifferentiated prohibition of this distribution channel, that is, mail order via the Internet, could not be justifi ed. The need to advise customers could also be satisfi ed via the Internet . In fact, internet buying may have certain advantages, such as the ability to place the order from home or the offi ce, without the need to go out, and to have time to think about the questions to ask the pharmacists, and these advantages must be taken into account. 496 Besides expressly underlining these advantages of the medium, the Court of Justice also addressed the risks by which the restrictions had been justifi ed, namely that medicine could be incorrectly used and that medicine could be abused.",

These ambitious efforts culminated in the signing of the Maastricht Treaty on 7 February 1992. 508 The population in certain Member States was not necessarily supportive of such big steps. The drafters of the Maastricht Treaty included elements aimed at increasing the popularity of the move. ' Subsidiarity ' as a general principle of Union law with general applicability was introduced. 509 'European citizenship' served also as a promotional tool since it constituted a rather easy and non-consequential conglomerate of new rights. 510 Despite these goodies, the referendum on the Maastricht Treaty in the founding Member State France passed by mere luck with a 51 % approval rate, and few months later Denmark rejected the Treaty. 511 These results came as a wakeup call for many European political leaders.",

            "text": "Following the Danish 'nej' on 2 June 1992, the European Council met at the end of June 1992 in Lisbon. In the conclusions of the presidency, the European Council elaborated on \"a Union close to its citizens.\" It was \"convinced that harmonious development of the Union [\u2026] depends [\u2026] on the strict application [\u2026] of the principle of subsidiarity by all the institutions.\" 513 This would \"ensure a direction [\u2026] in conformity with the common wish of Member States and of their citizens.\" 514 The Commission and the Council of Ministers were invited to \"undertake urgent work on the procedural and practical steps to implement the principle and to report to the European Council in Edinburgh.\" 515 The tone was further intensifi ed following a second shock, the near-failure in the French referendum on 20 September 1992. In a three page declaration entitled 'A Community close to its Citizens', 516 the conclusions of the presidency discussed the question of how to bring the Community closer to its citizens and the importance of the principle of subsidiarity. \"Making the principle of subsidiarity work should be a priority for all the Community institutions.\" 517 Moreover, the report of the Commission, requested by the European Council in Birmingham, 518 stated that the Commission \"following consultations with interested parties, [\u2026] intends to abandon certain initiatives that had been planned.\" This included inter alia proposals on the harmonisation of the regulation of gambling. 519 The next summit of the European Council took place in Edinburgh in December 1992, when the Swiss voters had just rejected the ratifi cation of the EEA Agreement. 520 Referring to the conclusions of the presidency, the outcomes of the summit were 2. The European Council shall consist of the Heads of State or Government of the Member States, together with its President and the President of the Commission. The High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy shall take part in its work.\" As opposed to the aforementioned post-Lisbon version, in the 1990s, the European Council was not led by its President but by a rotating presidency among Member States that changed every half a year. Its political purpose, however, was similar. 513 Conclusions of the Presidency at the Lisbon European Council, at 9. 514 Ibid., at 9. 515 Ibid., at 9. 516 It should also be noted that between the two summits the wording of the title changed from a 'Union' to a 'Community' close to its citizens, thus returning to the pre-Maastricht language. 517 Conclusions of the Presidency at the Birmingham European Council, Annex 1, at 6. 518 supposed to \"pave the way for a return to confi dence by its citizens in European construction.\" 521 An annex outlined in detail how the principle of subsidiarity was to be implemented: \"This principle contributes to the respect for the national identities of Member States and safeguards their powers. It aims at decisions within the European Union being taken as closely as possible to the citizen.\" 522 A close analysis of the conclusions of the presidencies makes it clear that the aforementioned rhetoric merely served to accommodate political concerns . The principle of subsidiarity had historical antecedents in the Treaties and the case law; it was not a new invention. 523 It was even expressly held that \"[t]he application of the principle shall respect [\u2026] the maintaining in full of the acquis communautaire.\" 524 Also, the principle of subsidiarity should not have direct effect. 525 The political discourse prior to the referenda on the Maastricht Treaty illustrates the signifi cant shift of language . At the time when Germany's reunifi cation was successfully negotiated, 526 the European Council discussed the \"extension and strengthening of Community action\" in December 1990. It noted \"a wide recognition of the need to extend or redefi ne the Community's competence in specifi c areas [\u2026] inter alia [\u2026] the health sector and in particular the combating of major diseases .\" 527 In this context, it is almost impossible not to contemplate the possibility that gambling addiction and other related disorders could be part of a holistic EU public health policy today if the discourse had not signifi cantly changed at that time. It is not insensible to consider that gambling addiction could have been much earlier on the table of DG Internal Market or DG SANCO -arguably not to the detriment of the health of consumers.",

Member States regulated \"this sector in an intensive and fairly restrictive manner.\" 536 Overall, the regulation aimed at restricting the supply of gambling offers to protect consumers from \" gambling fever .\" 537 The Advocate General took express reference to the political discourse at the Edinburgh summit and reminded that the Commission had \"informed the European Council that in view of the principle of subsidiarity [\u2026], it has decided not to submit proposals for Community rules in [the] fi eld [of gambling].\" 538 He then noted a lack of relevant secondary law and, combined with the principle of subsidiarity, concluded that it could be \"presumed\" that Member States can \"require revenue to be used solely for public or public-interest purposes; and restrict the supply of lotteries.\" 539 The Advocate General also discussed a point that would be reactivated later by Advocate General Bot: the detrimental nature of competition in the gambling sector. According to Gulmann, the supply of lottery offers needed to be limited; otherwise, the different national lotteries would unduly compete with each other. Large lotteries would have signifi cant competitive advantages compared to smaller lotteries 540 because they could offer the biggest prizes, with consumers being attracted by big prizes. He further combined this point with the importance of the revenues for the public purse. A different outcome was not wishful in the eyes of the Advocate General as it would result in competition \"between public funds and public-interest purposes in the various Member States.\" 541 It was only after these broad political considerations, which contrasted wishful with non-wishful political outcomes, that the Advocate General approached the legal assessment of the case. He identifi ed three grounds that could each justify the limitations: the fi ght against crime (fraud, money laundering), the limitation of the supply of lottery services to protect consumers from detrimental social and health consequences, and the allocation of the revenues for public interest purposes with the latter being emphasised throughout the opinion. 542 In this context, he suggested a further approach that was also adopted by the Court of Justice. According to some of the pleadings, he suggested that the aforementioned justifi cations \"cannot be taken in isolation one from another.\" The second part of the paragraph shows the ambiguity of this peculiar approach.",

The Court's reference to the principle of proportionality remained rhetoric until the Gambelli 566 decision. The Court kept repeating the formula that \"it is not possible to disregard the moral, religious or cultural aspects of lotteries, like other types of gambling.\" 567 The peculiar nature of gambling was substantially argued by \"moral, cultural and religious factors.\" 568 Chapter 7 concluded that gambling-related risks, in particular gambling disorder, were not primarily an issue for public morality but should be made subject of a scientifi c perspective. According to the argued two-category model, moral concerns fall in core cases of morality and non-core cases (see Sect. 7.3 ). In the fi rst category, the behaviour as such is seen as morally reprehensible as was seen for instance in Omega . 569 In the second category, the moral disapproval is not aimed at the behaviour as such but at potentially detrimental consequences of that behaviour. Society wishes to minimise risks associated with the behaviour. Gambling activities fall in this latter category. Gambling-related risks, namely gambling disorder, are about risk assessment and the discussion about how to minimise gambling-related harm can be objectivised. Risks can be described in epidemiological studies and addressed with policies informed by empirical evidence. 570 The Court of Justice dealt with gambling as an issue of public morality and not of risk assessment, science and empirical evidence. Therefore, it granted a very wide margin of appreciation without substantially reviewing the proportionality of the measures. On the axis of the universality-diversity dichotomy , the Court chose to accommodate alleged moral concerns even though the issue could be predominantly assessed on other justifi cation grounds . In gambling issues, these are consumer protection (addiction and fraud) as well as public order (other forms of crime).",

            "text": "As Collins noted, moral and ideological agendas regularly corrupt addiction policies. A value-loaded discussion makes it extremely hard to achieve a rational and humane discussion on addiction policy . 572 Addiction problems, such as gambling disorder, are dramatised and reduced to an easily identifi able cause. This in turn lays the ground for the call of a restrictive public policy that is aimed at protecting citizens from the 'social evil'. 573 A scientifi c perspective on gambling disorder is far less dramatic and offers a more complex picture of causality as it was described in Sects. 9.1 and 9.2 . Ross 570 Regarding the problem of causality of information, cf. Gasser 573 Cf. wording of the CJEU in C-447/08 and C-448/08 (Joined Cases) Criminal Proceedings against Otto Sj\u00f6berg (C-447/08) and Anders Gerdin (C-448/08) [2010] ECR I-6921. and Kinbaid noted correctly that scientifi c knowledge tended to undermine dramatic purity. 574 By relying on a moral perspective, the Court of Justice did not steer the discussion towards the necessity of informing gambling policies by scientifi c research. Neither did the Court of Justice itself engage in such discussion nor did it ask national courts to assess the risks from this angle. Similarly, the constructive role that international best practice could play was neglected. 575 There were opportunities where the Court of Justice made allusions that it may wish to rely on empirical evidence in future cases. 576 In Gambelli , the Court initiated its demand for a \"consistent and systematic\" policy for national measures to qualify as suitable. 577 One week later, the Court noted in an obiter dictum in Lindman that the case fi le disclosed no \"statistical or other evidence\" that would enable conclusions as regards the gravity of the risks of games of chance. 578 The fact that the Court handed down these criteria within one week raised expectations that the scientifi c perspective on gambling would gain importance in future cases. While the decisions in Gambelli and Lindman could have served as a basis on which to build a science-informed case law, the Court of Justice pursued its moral views on games of chance from the early case law . 579 An element from more recent case law may illustrate the minimal role that actual empirical evidence plays. The Portuguese government argued in Liga Portuguesa that the existence of the national state monopolist Santa Casa over more than fi ve centuries was evidence of its reliability. 580 The Court's conclusions suggest that it was persuaded by this argument. It seems daring to argue the reliability and thus quality of an institution by its long existence. If this were a suffi cient criterion, the presence of monopolies that existed for many decades, for instance in the energy sector, would have also been evidence of their reliability and quality. 581 Likewise, the Court of Justice did not underline the role of science in subsequent cases. In Markus Stoss , the referring court had asked whether the absence of any study on the proportionality of public monopolies before establishing such regime was compatible with EU law and referred to the criterion raised in Lindman regarding evidence. Yet, the Court found that the requirement to base that decision on evidence relied on a misreading of its case law. 582 In more recent decisions, however, the Court of Justice occasionally emphasised the burden of proof of Member States. It needed to be shown whether the risks that are claimed did in fact exist in the market at the material time and whether the expensionist gambling policy could have solved the problem. The Court recalled this element in Dickinger & \u00d6mer that it had originally introduced in Ladbrokes . 583 It must be noted that a scientifi c perspective does not necessarily mean that the Court of Justice itself would need to get involved in the assessment and weighing of empirical evidence on gambling addiction. The ECtHR gives in this context helpful guidance. A certain margin of appreciation can be granted to national authorities as so-called 'medical discretion'. When a diffi cult weighing of complex medical or scientifi c data is at hand, specialised staff and local authorities are in a better position to accomplish that task. Judges cannot be expected to possess or acquire specialised medical expertise. The Court of Justice and the national courts could focus in their reviews on a limited number of issues. Have the domestic authorities relied on best international science and empirical evidence ? Have they shown professionalism and pursued standards of best practice in implementing the gambling policy?",

            "text": "Following the Placanica decision, the Court of Justice remained, until recently, reluctant in reviewing the proportionality of gambling measures. This proved to be particularly true when health concerns were pleaded. The Court did not substantially elaborate on the criterion of a 'consistent and systematic' policy. It would not appear that this reluctance was coincidental; several decisions were taken with the Court sitting as Grand Chamber. There is also another indicator: Contrary to some Advocates General, 584 the Court of Justice did not refer to the gambling judgments handed down by the EFTA Court in ESA versus Norway and EFTA-Ladbrokes . 585 The EFTA Court had applied a stricter standard of review and had given more substantial guidance regarding the meaning of 'consistent and systematic'. 586 Baudenbacher observed that the Court of Justice seems to be reluctant to enter a debate where it disagrees with the reasoning of its sister court. 587 The Court of Justice, at that time, chose to go a different way in its gambling jurisprudence. However, its signifi cantly stricter review in the cases Markus Stoss and Zeturf indicates an adjustment of the Court's practice and thus an implicit reference to its sister court. 588 The Commission's Green Paper on online gambling lists the interests that stakeholders have in the gambling sector. Legal security takes the central role. 589 The lack of legal security is evident in the gambling sector. Arguably, this is due to a combination of the lack of EU secondary law and the reluctance of the Court of Justice to offer substantial guidance to national courts. The legal insecurity can be identifi ed in the abundance of proceedings before national courts that concern the compatibility of national gambling laws with EU law. According to a pan-European report composed by the Swiss Institute of Comparative Law, the number of proceedings amounted already in early 2006 to almost 600 cases. 590 The number was particularly high in Germany where differences in outcomes have often been quite substantial between different courts. As a result, national courts kept referring preliminary questions to the Court of Justice -an unsatisfactory situation that was also noted by Advocate General Colomer. 591 Some authors referred to a chaotic state of gambling law that public and private operators experienced. 592 Eventually, it seemed to be clear that the Court of Justice did not wish to change its approach and offer substantial guidance. 593 In its post-Placanica decisions, it did not refer to the more detailed rulings of the EFTA Court. Several judgments showed that the Court of Justice wishes a more active role of the national courts, because it repeatedly emphasised their role in the review process. The decisions in Sporting Exchange and Ladbrokes (and subsequent judgments) made this quite clear. The Court kept emphasising the role of national courts in reviewing the objective and the proportionality of national measures. 594 This path is not unproblematic. First, the rationale of the preliminary ruling procedure needs to be considered. Under the preliminary ruling procedure of Article 267 TFEU, the Court is required to offer guidance to the referring court. Advocate General Colomer provided a witty formula to describe this requirement. 595 And Advocate General La Pergola concisely noted in L\u00e4\u00e4r\u00e4 that the Court is required to reach an interpretation of [Union] law which gives the national court as complete and useful guidance as possible. 596 In related fi elds, the Court of Justice showed the willingness to offer useful guidance that informs the proportionality review of the referring court. 597 There is also a frustrating time factor for national courts. In spite of signifi cant improvements, a reference to the Court of Justice still results in a delay of the procedure of a couple of years. If referring judges did not expect substantial guidance from the Court of Justice, they would hardly opt for a reference.",

As the Court of Justice leaves a wide margin of appreciation to national authorities, it is for the national courts to use this space of manoeuvre. 598 For the following considerations, it is necessary to distinguish direct actions from preliminary rulings. In the former procedure, 599 if discretion is granted to national authorities, it is granted to the sole national power involved -the executive power. By contrast, the preliminary ruling procedure 600 constitutes an institutionalised judicial dialogue between the national courts and the Court of Justice. The equivalent procedure before the EFTA Court is the advisory opinion procedure. The margin of appreciation granted by the Court of Justice in preliminary rulings is to be shared between the national judicial branch and the executive branch . The Court of Justice sends the case back to the national court, which has to decide on the merits of the case. Therefore, it is ultimately left to the national court to which extent it passes the granted margin of appreciation on to the executive branch. This does not exempt national courts from reviewing the proportionality of the measures.",

            "text": "The study found that even in cases where justifi cation grounds were given, both national legislatures and the jurisprudence did regularly not refer to precise criteria to evaluate the proportionality of national measures. In any case, if at all, proportionality tests were mainly conducted by courts but not legislatures. 601 Especially in cases where measures were held to be justifi ed, the tendency of the courts was to simply refer to the notion of 'proportionality' in very broad terms . Courts may thus limit their review to the mere statement that a \"measure is proportionate\" or that it is \"in accordance with the criteria set out in the Gambelli judgment.\" 602 Even though a slightly increased attention to the proportionality review could be noted since the Gambelli decision, the report concluded that the review remained rather superfi cial in most cases. 603 National courts, however, mostly refer rather globally to the principle of proportionality, simply stating that a measure is \"proportionate\" or \"proportionate in the light of EC law\" or of \"the Gambelli criteria\", without engaging in any detailed analysis. 604 In a situation where the guidance by the Court of Justice is limited to very broadly phrased criteria, national courts may fi nd it diffi cult to proceed to a meaningful proportionality review. The consequence of such joint lenient review practice is a 'judicial vacuum': an area of law empty of meaningful judicial scrutiny . 605 Gambling laws and administrative decisions are hardly scrutinised. The functioning of the judicial dialogue between interpreting court (Court of Justice) and applying courts (national courts) is weakened. The outcome is that the Court of Justice is reluctant in giving meaningful, substantial guidance because it wants the national courts to solve the issues while the latter limit their scrutiny to an exercise restricted to referring to the recurring formula of the Court of Justice . Hence, no court applies a meaningful scrutiny, resulting in a judicial vacuum. This is substantially different in other countries. The signifi cant difference of the proportionality review practice in Scandinavia relates to differences in judicial culture. While the scope of this book does not permit an account of these factors in great detail, a brief overview of some aspects is given in the following.",

            "text": "The Danish situation may serve to illustrate some broad considerations of judicial culture. Courts in that country assumed the power to review laws from 'Folketinget' (the Danish parliament) as well as acts of the government. However, there is strong reluctance to review laws , not to mention to overturn them. This includes the 'H\u00f8jesteret' (the Danish Supreme Court). The reluctance is more a phenomenon of judicial culture rather than one of judicial powers. By law, any Danish court can review laws on their constitutionality. Yet, only one real case is known in which H\u00f8jesteret found a law unconstitutional, that is, not simply for formal reasons. 611 Beside these broad considerations, a concrete difference in legal instruments should also be considered. 612 As noted earlier, when reviewing administrative measures, Scandinavian courts were traditionally not familiar with the principle of proportionality but rather limited their review to a mere reasonableness test (see Sects. 3.4.1 and 9.3.3.3 i.f. ). Based on considerations relating to the supremacy of EU law and the principle of homogeneity in EEA law, it can be argued that the EU/ EEA principle of proportionality must also be applied by the EU/EEA national courtswithin the sphere of EU/EEA law . 613 One cannot help to be reminded in this context of the well-known Factortame case. According to the doctrine of sovereignty of Parliament, UK courts could traditionally not disapply acts of Parliament by a temporary injunction. Notwithstanding this considerable difference in legal traditions, the Court of Justice held that UK courts must set aside such national rule and grant interim relief to market actors in a situation such as in Factortame . 614 Similar to UK courts that are bound to apply a legal instrument traditionally alien to their legal measures. 619 It was suggested that a misconception on the part of the Oslo District Court led to the lenient review: the discretion granted by the EFTA Court in the advisory opinion was seen as automatically justifying an essentially unlimited margin of appreciation for the Norwegian government as regards the necessity of the measures. 620 This was arguably not what the EFTA Court's decision implied. 621 In the gaming machines case, the Norwegian Supreme Court expressly relied on the aforementioned logic. It argued that the EFTA Court had interpreted leniently the necessity criterion in ESA v Norway and that this approach harmonised well with the Norwegian tradition of judicial review of distinctly political measures . 622 As a consequence, it largely refrained from reviewing the measures as to their necessity. 623",

Only judges at the ECtHR are permitted to draft dissenting or concurring opinions . Judges at the Court of Justice and the EFTA Court are bound by the secrecy of deliberations and are not allowed to unveil the individual voting behaviour. Their opinions could be deducted from speeches and publications, but judges generally refrain from being too outspoken to avoid recusal in future cases. Different of course is the situation of Advocates General . Their view on the case is known in detail as opinions are associated with specifi c Advocates General. In addition, opinions tend to be much more detailed than judgments, at least in the case of the Court of Justice. 624 Nonetheless, it may be interesting to assess whether certain patterns can be identifi ed in the gambling cases. In the case of the EFTA Court, the exercise is superfl uous from the outset since this court generally sits in the identical composition of the three judges composing the EFTA Court. This was not different in the two gambling cases, because no ad hoc judge was sitting in those cases.",

It was partly the referring courts that were guiding the Court of Justice. There is a recognisable pattern: Where the Court of Justice chose to review national measures more strictly, the respective referring court had pointed at the facts of the case in quite critical language . This was the case for references from Austria, Germany and Italy. It may be more than a coincidence that those countries are also among those that host courts, which show a higher willingness to review national laws on their conformity with constitutional and EU law. These courts infl uenced the Court of Justice by phrasing their references in critical terms. In particular, they emphasised inconsistencies in the national gambling regime and often suggested themselves that the pleaded objectives were not coherently pursued. After such a reference, it was hard for the judges at the Court of Justice to ignore the highlighted inconsistencies. The Court of Justice made it clear that the suitability of the measures presupposed that they were coherent and consistent. 628 A few examples shall illustrate this point.",

It also underlined moral aspects and the special nature of gambling and applied a virtually unlimited margin of appreciation. These perspectives were proven to have impacted the choices of the Court of Justice in its early case law, with the Court expressly referring to the \"moral, religious or cultural aspects\" as well as the \"peculiar nature\" of gambling. As the Court does not like to depart from its precedent, formula from the early case law kept re-emerging in subsequent decisions. Section 9.3 then discussed the consequences of the Court of Justice's approach. It was found that the Court dealt with gambling issues as a matter for public morality rather than for scientifi c risk regulation. The moral perspective led to a lack of a science-informed approach towards games of chance and gambling addiction. Some of the Court of Justice's remarks in Gambelli and Lindman could have served as a basis for developing a science-oriented jurisprudence but remained rather isolated statements as further case law showed.",

Underlining the wide margin of appreciation, the Court of Justice demonstrated reluctance in offering substantial guidance to national courts and emphasised the role of national courts in the judicial review of national gambling policies. A study had found that national courts often did not review the proportionality of restrictive measures in gambling, regularly limiting their 'assessment' to a mere reference to formula of the Court of Justice . The outcome can be referred to as a 'judicial vacuum': an area of law empty of a meaningful judicial scrutiny .",

While numerous courts in Austria and Germany assessed measures that would be less restrictive to intra-Union trade, courts in Scandinavian countries regularly made simply a global reference to the principle of proportionality or formula of the Court of Justice. As illustrated along the examples of Denmark and Norway, the reluctance may often not be due to a lack of judicial powers but rather due to judicial traditions. It was for instance shown that the Danish Supreme Court ('H\u00f8jesteret') hardly ever struck down a national law based on unconstitutionality and that the Norwegian courts traditionally only applied a reasonableness test rather than a proportionality test.",

Since the EFTA Court sat in identical composition in the two gambling cases, it was superfl uous to do such an assessment. At the Court of Justice, certain cautiously suggested patterns of decision-makers were identifi ed. A practice of lenient review was associated with Advocates General Gulmann and Bot as well as 'juge rapporteur' Puissochet. By contrast, a stricter review was associated with Advocates General Alber, Colomer, Maz\u00e1k and Mengozzi as well as 'juge rapporteur' Edward.",

New Jersey was second in line with the adoption of casino legislation in 1976 and the fi rst casino opening in 1978. The nationwide spread of casinos only started in the early 1990s. 277 With the spread of gambling offers all over the country, other States such as Iowa or Missouri experienced increased problems too. 278 Adaptation A changing trend became evident during the last decade . More recent prevalence rates refuted the direct and proportionate link between exposure and infection. This trend suggests that a population adapts over time to the exposure to games of chance. Petry et al. identifi ed a prevalence rate of life-time gambling disorder at 0.4% 279 and Kessler et al. at a rate of 0.6 %. Despite an ever-increasing exposure, in particular as of the 1990s, life-time gambling participation had also dropped to 78 %. 280 Around three decades after the fi rst prevalence study conducted by Kallick et al., the rates for gambling disorder were back down at the same level or even slightly under them. 281 274 Volberg, R.A.

            "text": "The extent to which national courts review legal acts and government decisions is subject to the powers that these courts are granted by national law. Yet, it is also subject to different judicial cultures , which may strongly vary from country to country. The self-perception of judges, that is, the interpretation of their role in the bigger societal system, may differ from one Member State to another. It can also vary individually from judge to judge. The Study of Gambling Services supports this view. Among those countries that were identifi ed as jurisdictions where a number of courts only made a global reference to the principle of proportionality were inter alia Denmark, Finland and Sweden . By contrast, there were also a few jurisdictions in which a number of courts referred to concrete criteria in their proportionality analysis: Austria, Belgium, Germany, Italy, Luxembourg and the Netherlands. 606 In particular, only Austrian and German courts found it important to inquire into alternative measures that would be less restrictive to intra-Union trade while still being equally effective. 607 Not least because of their historical experience with totalitarian regimes, the German and Austrian legal systems provide for courts that are expected to closely review government decisions. The central role attributed to courts also affects the self-perception of judges to ensure the rule of law. It can hardly be disputed that German courts are generally not hesitant in reviewing laws and acts. 608 The German Constitutional Court demonstrated the willingness to closely review the proportionality of restrictive gambling measures in its well-known judgment regarding the gambling monopoly in Bavaria . 609 Ennuschat observed that this court applied a stricter review than the Court of Justice. 610 heritage, Scandinavian courts -as other EU/EEA national courts -are bound to review the proportionality of national measures at the level required by the European case law. It was suggested in the literature that Norwegian courts proceed to a proportionality review when dealing with EEA law (and ECHR law) but may often incorrectly apply the proportionality test, that is, not in line with the review criteria of the European High Courts. 615 The earlier mentioned empirical study seems to support the view of a very lenient judicial review. 616 It was further argued that UK courts effectively apply a proportionality review on substance -in spite of also using language reminiscent of common law, particularly relating to the Wednesbury test. 617 However, fi nal conclusions on this topic would require a close analysis of a signifi cant number of cases from these jurisdictions.A more lenient proportionality review by Scandinavian courts may not be specifi c to the gambling cases. However, another aspect must be considered in this context too. It was previously noted that the Court of Justice generally leaves it to the referring court to assess the proportionality stricto sensu of a measure (see Sect. 3.3 i . f .). Due to the aforementioned factors, the third subtest of proportionality may rarely be judicially reviewed. Yet, the leniency of proportionality review in the area of gambling goes far beyond that situation. It was shown that the gambling jurisprudence of the Court of Justice additionally left large aspects relating to the subtests of suitability and necessity to the discretion of the referring courts (see Sect. 9.2 ). If national courts refrain from meaningfully assessing not only the proportionality stricto sensu but also the suitability and necessity of national restrictions, there is little judicial review of proportionality left.The case law shows that even the more substantial proportionality review of the EFTA Court did not trigger a full scrutiny of the proportionality of the measures by the Norwegian courts. A Norwegian scholar noted that the Oslo District Court 618 assessed the suitability of the measures, but that court's discussion of necessity was more formal rather than on substance. The necessity review was largely limited to references to the EFTA Court's criteria in the advisory opinion, without effectively applying the criteria to the concrete facts of the case or inquiring into less restrictive 615 ",
