VLPs fall in the size range of viruses (22\u2013200 nm or more in some cases), with their exact size and morphology depending on the particular viral proteins being incorporated. VLPs offer a promising approach to the production of vaccines against many diseases, because their repetitive, high density display of epitopes is potentially highly effective in eliciting strong immune responses (Bachmann et al., 2004). VLPs therefore constitute a safe and effective approach for the induction of neutralizing antibodies to surface proteins, where soluble forms of their protein subunits have failed. VLPs can also be exploited as \u201cplatforms\u201d for the presentation of foreign epitopes and/or targeting molecules on chimeric VLPs. This can be achieved through modification of the VLP gene sequence(s), such that fusion VLP proteins and foreign vaccine proteins are assembled into VLPs during de novo synthesis. VLP chimeras have been extensively explored as vaccine candidates over the last 20 years (Pumpens and Grens, 2001).",

Envisaging the same success, there is currently a large number of other VLP-based vaccine candidates, including VLPs composed of multiple different proteins (especially when different viral structural proteins are needed for a stable VLP), either in clinical trials or undergoing preclinical evaluation; examples include influenza virus, parvovirus, Norwalk and various chimeric VLPs (Clinicaltrials.gov, 2010). Adding more viral proteins brings nevertheless extra challenges for setting up optimal processing parameters up- and downstream; furthermore, the required quality control methods are inevitably more complex because a mixture of both assembled and non-assembled proteins co-exist. These issues are addressed in more depth in the following sections.",

With such a long track record on recombinant protein production and large-scale suspension cultures established in either stirred or rocked bioreactors, the BEVS/IC has been shown to be one of the best cell culture systems for this purpose. The only potential disadvantage of BEVS/IC resides in its pattern of post-translational modifications (Davis and Wood, 1995). Insect cells perform simpler post-translational glycosylation based on enriched mannose in comparison to mammalian cells, which can be a shortcoming for certain applications (Wu et al., 2010). Nevertheless, improved insect cells lines \u2013 \u201chumanized\u201d cells that perform mammalian-like post-translation modifications \u2013 are becoming available (Hang et al., 2003) (see also van Oers, this volume). Thus, when the insect cell glycosylation pattern and biological functionality of the desired VLP match, BEVS/IC is most likely the strongest candidate tool for VLP-based vaccine development.",

This USP technology presents many benefits, including: (i) single- or campaign-use, thus eliminating cross-contamination; (ii) no cleaning and sterilization costs; (iii) residual validation costs; (iv) increased flexibility for process scale adjustments; (v) lower upfront investment than stainless-steel reactors; (vi) short turnaround time; and (vii) ease of installation and little facility space utilization. Still, there are some drawbacks when going fully disposable, for example: (i) limited extractable and/or leachable substance quality control data from disposable materials and disposable manufacturers; (ii) disposable bag systems are difficult to handle for scales over 1000 L; (iii) pressure limitation; (iv) high temperature limitation. Nonetheless, with the current improvements in USP yields and in some cases early proof-of-concept stages, small to medium scales are sufficient, which make disposable bioreactors extremely appealing. In addition, a given lead biopharmaceutical has generally a much smoother technology transfer to any contract manufacturing organization (CMO) when relying on disposable manufacturing than with stainless-steel equipment due to the flexibility allowed by the former.",

As a follow-up, our team developed a thermodynamic equilibrium-based model describing, for the first time, the assembly of a triple-layered VLP (Rold\u00e3o et al., 2010). Simulations suggested that the concentration of correctly assembled particles is maximized if the structural proteins are provided at the exact stoichiometric ratio and with high concentration. Such insights lead to the conclusion that the amount of unassembled/malformed VLPs typically observed in many systems is most likely due to a non-optimal ratio of proteins at the moment of assembly inside the cell host.",

Tangential flow microfiltration, using membrane cassettes or hollow fiber units (Saha et al., 1994) with 0.2 \u03bcm retention pore is also possible. The use of depth filters makes the sieving and particulate retention process much more efficient because of the depth-dependent size separation factor; moreover, due to the charged nature of some depth-filter materials (non-propylene) and their three-dimensional arrangement (Prashad and Tarrach, 2006), a higher degree of cell and cell debris retention is achieved while VLPs still permeate. A careful selection of the depth-filter materials is critical as the use of non-inert materials may bind efficiently not only the debris but also the VLPs being sieved (Table 2).",

As BEVS/IC is used for the production of VLPs, one needs to devise a suitable strategy to remove, at least, most of the recombinant baculoviruses.

It is typical that a good percentage of the VLP proteins, perhaps even over 80%, are not properly assembled into the desired VLP (Rold\u00e3o et al., 2010); therefore, it is critical that both qualitative and quantitative analytical methods are developed. This is critical so that process developers can design less \u201cblindly\u201d USP optimization (e.g., by changing the strategy of infection) or selecting the right chromatographic matrix/operating conditions (e.g., for removing a specific/resilient impurity). Moreover, for a cGMP process, product identity, quality, titer, purity and consistency/reproducibility need to be carefully documented. Table 3\nshows the basic set of methods that are needed to ensure this manufacturing quality and consistency; in particular, for in-process control, in vitro potency and identity assays as well as methods for estimating the major process-derived impurities such as host-cell protein, host cell DNA and residual baculoviruses are fundamental.
