The best results were shown by the MySQL + Redis suite, which was chosen by us to store data in the corpus management system. To build the system based on the selected components, additional elements must be included. So, to bind the PHP interpreter and the Redis data warehouse, we use the PhpRedis extension. In order for the PHP interpreter and MySQL DBMS to work in tandem, we use the php-mysql package, namely the mysqlnd driver, which allows working with the DBMS using its own low-level protocol.",
