Difficulties in securing visas for permanent residency in the United States, perception of a limited job market, and the explosive growth in the number of hospitalist positions may be important contributing factors.

Indeed, the current decline is most striking for the subspecialties of infectious diseases and nephrology, whereas the other subspecialities remain highly competitive. As nephrology and infectious diseases are both hospital-based and nonprocedural in nature, the factors underlying the decline may be somewhat similar. A recent American Society of Nephrology survey identified 3 reasons for the declining interest: perceived suboptimal lifestyle of a nephrologist; relatively inadequate compensation; and the perception that the specialty is too difficult to master (personal communication, Noreen Rossi, MD, Fellowship Program Director, Nephrology, Wayne State University).",

The match process is the second step. The match results, until recently, were announced by the NRMP in the spring for candidates starting fellowship the following year, ie. 13-14 months before the beginning of fellowship.

The NRMP mandates that 75% of all programs with available positions in a given year register for the match and that 75% of available positions within the specialty be registered with the NRMP [3] . The pressure to fill openings has now caused some program directors to offer positions outside the match. This practice forces programs remaining in the match to draw from a smaller group of applicants; therefore, they have a higher chance of not filling. Programs that do not fill are often subject to administrative scrutiny for possible reduction in positions, creating significant pressure to fill the program.

            "text": "The creation of a new physician specialty, the \"hospitalist,\" and the increasing difficulty to obtain permanent visas for non-US physicians have, in our opinion, significantly swayed international medical graduates away from the field of infectious diseases. The increasing number of hospitalists in US hospitals has created new opportunities for internal medicine graduates. In 2010, it was estimated that there were >30 000 hospitalists in the United States; many graduates are choosing this field, attracted by both the financial and lifestyle benefits afforded to those choosing this subspeciality [4] . From a recent survey of 40 000 new physicians conducted in September 2011, the median starting salary for hospitalists was $165 000 compared with $158 000 for infectious diseases physicians [5] . Hospitalists are not required to have additional years of subspecialty training and often are paid higher wages than a board-certified infectious diseases physician, work in shifts with extended periods of time off, and have no outpatient overhead or responsibilities. This is appealing to many young physicians who are frequently burdened with large debt and growing families, especially at a time of uncertainty over the effects of healthcare payment reform. The effect of the rapid growth of the hospitalist on candidates applying for the infectious diseases match has not been formally evaluated. However, there is a temporal association between the increase in this field and the reduction in the number of international graduates applying to adult infectious diseases programs. A recent survey of internal medicine resident graduates from 2009 to 2011 demonstrated that international graduates had a decreased interest in all subspecialty medicine and an increased interest in hospitalist medicine as a career plan from the first to the third postgraduate year [6] .",

            "text": "An additional factor that may affect international medical residents' decision to pursue a career in infectious diseases is the US visa (J-1 or H-1) requirement when deciding postresidency career plans. In recent years, federal regulations have been tightened for non-US physicians to obtain the H-1 visa that leads to permanent residency in the United States. Fellowship training programs are increasingly reluctant to incur the costs associated with visa sponsorship, thus limiting residents' opportunities for fellowship positions. Trainees with H-1 visas have a 6-year window to complete their training and apply for permanent residency (green card) status; completing 5 years of training (3 years of residency and 2 years of fellowship) restricts the time available to apply for a green card. For internal medicine residents with a J-1 visa, because few J-1sponsored jobs exist for subspecialists, most enter the field of general internal medicine. Moreover, the recent change in dates of the match (from June of second year of residency to December of third year) leaves unmatched candidates little time to secure a J-1-sponsored job. Hence, visa-related issues are likely a large factor in the decreasing number of fellowship applicants among international graduates. This trend has disproportionately affected the infectious diseases subspecialty-the percentage of decline, from 2010 to 2014, among the international students applying for an infectious diseases match was 38%, compared with an overall decline of only 3.7% to all internal medicine fellowships. The exact reasons for this disproportionate decrease are unclear.",

This issue was previously addressed in 2 editorials from another era [7, 8] . In a 1987 editorial, saturation of the job market was felt to be \"imminent\" and would likely \"last much longer in the field of infectious diseases than in subspecialties that are older\" [8] . Hence, the trainees may feel that job opportunities in infectious diseases are decreasing, particularly with improved control and relatively straightforward management of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/AIDS. In 2 more recent articles, the expanding roles of infectious diseases physicians were summarized [9, 10] . Infection control/hospital epidemiology, antibiotic stewardship, treatment of sepsis, and outpatient antibiotic therapy have been cited as additional areas of responsibilities that help avoid saturating the infectious diseases job market. Certainly, the expanding population of HIV-infected individuals due to the advances in anti-HIV therapy has contributed to the steady growth of infectious diseases jobs over the last 2 decades. Importantly, with the newer anti-hepatitis C drugs and the increase in the immunosuppressed population, the role of infectious diseases physicians in the prevention/management of infections will likely increase while we witness decreasing national trends in hospitalization rates and length of stay as well as decrease in reimbursement for consultants.",

Among 83 respondents, program directors felt that availability of a mentor in the field of infectious diseases, exposure to ambulatory management of HIV, and clinical experience abroad were the strongest drivers for residents to seek fellowship training. IDSA is currently funding a formal study to better understand those factors that influence Internal Medicine residents' subspecialty career choices in general, and specifically for Infectious Diseases. The results may provide some insight into ways to enhance interest in the specialty among trainees. Some possible solutions provided by the authors are summarized in Table 1 . As the main target for potential fellowship applicants will increasingly be US graduates, the process of promoting our field needs to begin in preclinical years of medical school. This will be particularly important as the number of US medical school graduates is expected to grow. It is time to review, update, and expand the syllabi for infectious diseases in medical school curricula. Given the issue of the urgency of global antimicrobial resistance, the medical school deans may be convinced to give increased time for infectious diseases. Increasing knowledge and experience among medical students in areas of global health, HIV infection, antibiotic stewardship, and diagnostic microbiology would hopefully increase the pool of future applicants. Opportunities for students to spend time at medical schools in developing countries is likely to further their interest in the field of infectious diseases and global health. Mentorship for student research among medical school faculty through programs such as the Medical Scholars Program (sponsored by the IDSA) is critical.",

Forty percent of the infectious diseases subspecialists earned $150 000-$200 000 per year, while another 40% earned >$200 000 per year. Infectious diseases physicians ranked 25th out of the 25 specialties surveyed. ACGME currently permits up to 25% of infectious diseases fellowship positions over a 5-year period to be filled by United States Medical Licensing Examination-certified graduates from approved non-US residency programs. This allowance gives the fellowship program directors a unique opportunity to bring superior candidates from overseas to be trained, then return to their country to serve as role models in the practice of infectious diseases. A small number of US-based fellowship positions are funded by other countries so that their candidates return to practice clinical/academic infectious diseases. Although there is no established mechanism to develop these academic and financial relationships, further work to grow the US infectious diseases fellowships as a \"global resource\" should be pursued in the common interest of developing a well-trained global infectious diseases community with good practice standards. Existing infectious diseases fellowship positions can also be used to train physicians for work overseas. Whereas traditionally, UStrained physicians who sought international jobs worked in resource-limited countries, the economic growth of many countries has resulted in substantial improvements in healthcare in countries where subspecialty training is sparse. Thus, US infectious diseases fellowships may also prove to be helpful for training a global workforce.",
