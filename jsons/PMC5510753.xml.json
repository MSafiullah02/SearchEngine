Encephalomyelitis induced by infection with alphaviruses can be severe, with outcome dependent on the virus species (Babi et al., 2014, Baig et al., 2014, Bruyn and Lennette, 1953, Ethier and Rogg, 2012, Harvala et al., 2009, Lury and Castillo, 2004, Mancao et al., 2009, Przelomski et al., 1988, Reddy et al., 2008, Rivas et al., 1997, Rozdilsky et al., 1968, Schultz et al., 1977, Vilcarromero et al., 2010). Eastern equine encephalitis virus is most neurovirulent with fatalities most commonly in infants and children and frequent neurologic sequelae in those that survive (Deresiewicz et al., 1997, Finley et al., 1955). Currently, no treatments beyond supportive care are available, and no licensed vaccines for alphavirus encephalomyelitis are approved for non-military human use, so there is a need to identify new approaches to treatment (Go et al., 2014).",

Weanling C57BL/6 mice infected with the neurovirulent NSV strain of SINV develop fatal encephalomyelitis while mice infected with the less virulent TE strain recover with persistent hippocampal-dependent memory deficits as measured by fear conditioning (Jackson et al., 1988, Potter et al., 2015).",

After infection with the neurovirulent NSV strain of SINV, fatal encephalomyelitis coincides with infiltration of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells into the brain (Kulcsar et al., 2014), and in studies of mice lacking components of the immune response, particularly T cell deficits, mortality and severity of disease are decreased (Rowell and Griffin, 2002, Kimura and Griffin, 2003). Furthermore, previous studies have shown that inhibition of the immune response and glutamate excitotoxicity with 2-amino-3-(5-methyl-3-oxo-1,2-oxazol-4-yl) propranoic acid (AMPA) receptor antagonists can protect NSV-infected mice from fatal encephalomyelitis (Greene et al., 2008, Nargi-Aizenman et al., 2004).",

            "text": "DON is a diazo-containing glutamine analog that acts as a broad irreversible competitive inhibitor of several glutamine-utilizing enzymes (Thangavelu et al., 2014). During growth and proliferation, T cells preferentially use glutamine instead of glucose as an energy source, and rapidly dividing activated T cells show increased glutamine uptake and metabolism (Carr et al., 2010, Maciolek et al., 2014). Therefore, glutamine antagonism can inhibit lymphocyte proliferation (Wang et al., 2011). In the CNS, the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate is synthesized from glutamine by the amidohydrolase enzyme glutaminase. Excess production of glutamate leads to neuronal death through glutamate excitotoxicity, so inhibition of glutaminase via DON might abrogate this process (Sattler and Tymianski, 2001). In support of this approach, mice infected with the fatal NSV strain of SINV show reduced mortality with DON treatment (Manivannan et al., 2016), and in the less virulent TE strain of SINV, DON reduces the development of clinical disease and hippocampus-dependent memory deficits (Potter et al., 2015). To determine the mechanism(s) by which DON improves outcome from nonfatal alphavirus encephalomyelitis, we have examined the effect of treatment on both pathological changes and virus clearance in the CNS.",

While inflammation and pathological changes were present throughout the brain, the hippocampus was chosen for closer evaluation due to the predilection of SINV for those neurons (Kimura and Griffin, 2003). In the hippocampi and spinal cords of untreated, SINV-infected mice, perivascular cuffs of mononuclear cells and increased parenchymal cellularity were appreciable by 7 DPI (Figs. 2A and 3A). At 7 and 9 DPI, there was disruption of neuronal architecture in the hippocampus, with multifocal areas of granule cell loss and immune cell infiltration in the dentate gyrus (Fig. 2A), and at 9 DPI, tissue necrosis was noted in the lateral ventral horn of the spinal cord (Fig. 3A). Increased inflammation and pathological changes had resolved by 11 DPI. Compared to mock-infected controls (data not shown), there was no evidence of increased inflammation or pathological changes in the brains or spinal cords of SINV-infected mice treated with low or high dose DON during the period of drug administration. Following cessation of treatment, perivascular cuffs of mononuclear cells became apparent at 9 and 11 DPI in the hippocampi and spinal cords of SINV-infected mice previously treated with DON.

Because glutamine antagonism suppresses lymphocyte proliferation (Colombo et al., 2010, Newsholme et al., 1985, Wang et al., 2011) (Fig. 1), the antiviral effector function of these cells was evaluated during and following DON treatment of SINV infection.

This impaired immune response resulted in a decrease in pathological changes and fewer TUNEL- positive cells in the CNS but also reduced production of SINV-specific antibody and IFN-\u03b3, resulting in delayed virus clearance. DON affected the immune response mostly during the period of treatment, so the effects on CNS pathology and virus clearance were transient and, upon cessation of treatment, the immune response was activated, CNS pathology appeared, and virus clearance initiated more quickly in low dose-treated than high dose-treated animals. DON had a variable effect on SINV-induced glial markers of glutamate excitotoxicity, suggesting that the primary mechanism for decreasing pathology is through modulation of the immune response.",

Second, the neuron may be damaged or die through a secondary process, such as effects of inflammation or glutamate excitotoxicity (Conrady et al., 2010, Greene et al., 2008). Activation of nearby microglia and astrocytes that release reactive oxygen and nitrogen species and infiltration of monocytes, neutrophils, and lymphocytes that release cytokines may all facilitate neuronal damage (Tilleux and Hermans, 2007). And lastly, virus infection of the neuron may be controlled through noncytolytic immune mechanisms so the cell survives.

This is in contrast to peak infectious virus titers, which occurred at 5 DPI (and possibly earlier) in the brain.

While macrophages can sometimes be a source of IFN-\u03b3 (Darwich et al., 2009), natural killer (NK) cells are more likely to be the non-T cell source of IFN-\u03b3 in this situation (Trinchieri et al., 1984). NK cells can be quickly activated to produce IFN-\u03b3 (Sun and Lanier, 2011) and proliferate in response to virus infection (Biron et al., 1983, Dokun et al., 2001, Sun et al., 2009, Lopez-Verges et al., 2011). However, the metabolic requirements for NK cell proliferation have not been extensively studied (Gardiner and Finlay, 2017), so the requirement for glutamine may be less than that of T cells. Therefore, we speculate that NK cells account for the early increase in Ifng mRNA and IFN-\u03b3 protein in the brains of DON-treated mice and contribute to the increases in untreated infected mice (Figs. 7E and F), but more investigation into this question is required.",

Glutamate is a major excitatory neurotransmitter that binds to glutamate receptors on recipient neurons (Sattler and Tymianski, 2001) and can result in an influx of excess calcium into the post-synaptic neuron, which in turn triggers a cascade resulting in free radical production and mitochondrial dysfunction, and ultimately, cell death (J. M. Lee et al., 1999; Nicotera and Orrenius, 1998). Hippocampal neurons in the brain and motor neurons in the spinal cord are especially sensitive to glutamate excitotoxicity (Carriedo et al., 2000, Nadler et al., 1978, Olney et al., 1979, Rothstein et al., 1993), and the process plays a role in SINV-induced pathology (Darman et al., 2004, Nargi-Aizenman et al., 2004). Furthermore, treatment with an AMPA receptor antagonist protects mice from NSV-induced death (Nargi-Aizenman et al., 2004; Greene et al., 2008).",

Expression of GFAP, an astrocyte protein up-regulated in response to neuronal damage and local cytokine production, was not affected by DON treatment, consistent with induction of an innate response to SINV infection. GLT1/EAAT2, which is primarily expressed by astrocytes but also found on microglia, is responsible for the majority of glutamate uptake from the synaptic cleft and thus an important player in the prevention of excitotoxicity (Danbolt, 2001). Several CNS virus infections, including NSV, human coronavirus (HCoV)-OC43, human T-lymphotropic virus, and human cytomegalovirus, downregulate GLT1 expression (Akaoka et al., 2001, Brison et al., 2011, Darman et al., 2004, Prow and Irani, 2008, Prow and Irani, 2007, Zhang et al., 2014), but others, including herpes simplex virus and Japanese encephalitis virus infection, induce upregulation (Mishra et al., 2007, Mishra et al., 2008, Persson et al., 2007). In our study, SINV infection reduced GLT1 expression in the brain as determined by both IHC and immunoblot at 7 DPI compared to mock-infected control mice. However, DON treatment inconsistently restored expression of GLT1 in the brain at 7 DPI, with comparable expression of GFAP compared to untreated, SINV-infected mice.",

Expression of IBA1, a marker of activated microglia, was increased in untreated, SINV-infected mouse brains compared to uninfected controls, and DON treatment decreased IBA1 expression at 7 DPI. However, macrophages also express IBA1 and infiltrate the brain during NSV infection (Kulcsar et al., 2014, Kulcsar et al., 2015), so these cells could also be contributing to increased IBA1 expression during SINV infection. Further studies that directly measure glutamate and evaluate excitotoxicity, which are difficult to perform in vivo, would help elucidate the role glutamine antagonists play in preventing excitotoxicity.",

During SINV infection, approximately 50% of mice treated with DON develop clinical signs of encephalomyelitis by 7 DPI, compared to almost 100% of untreated, SINV-infected mice (Potter et al., 2015). Because the immune response is almost completely absent in CNS during the period of DON treatment, this suggests another mechanism, such as glutamate excitotoxicity, is contributing to clinical disease development. Therefore, while we can conclude that DON treatment suppresses immune cell proliferation in the periphery, leading to decreased cell death but delayed virus clearance in the CNS, it likely has less of an effect on glutamate excitotoxicity due to its poor ability to cross the BBB, resulting in residual clinical disease development. However, a prodrug version of DON containing a methyl-POM on the amine and isopropyl ester on the carboxylate that achieves a ten-fold higher cerebrospinal fluid to plasma ratio compared to the parent DON in rhesus macaques has been recently developed (Rais et al., 2016).",

DON is effective against several tumors (Magill et al., 1957, Rais et al., 2016, Shelton et al., 2010, Sullivan et al., 1988), and its immune suppressive properties prevent allograft rejection and attenuate clinical signs associated with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis and Plasmodium infection (Gordon et al., 2015; Lee et al., 2015; Plaimas et al., 2013; Shijie et al., 2009). However, gastrointestinal toxicity observed both in mice (Potter et al., 2015, Rais et al., 2016) and in human trials (Earhart et al., 1990, Earhart et al., 1982, Sklaroff et al., 1980) has limited use of DON as a therapeutic agent, and DON prodrugs with reduced toxicity are in development. Regardless, because the immune system plays a role in both CNS pathology and virus clearance, thoughtful consideration should be employed when evaluating drugs that suppress the immune system as potential therapeutics for alphavirus encephalomyelitis.",
