Because the impact of any intervention depends not only on its efficacy, but on the proportion of targets reached, knowledgeable public health practitioners might have cautioned against overestimating the ease of identifying asymptomatic people in whom pathogens were replicating. Where published observations permit assessment, only about 5% of infected contacts of SARS patients (i.e., susceptible people associating with infectious ones intimately enough for infection) were in fact isolated before symptom onset. In Singapore, for example, only 11 of the 238 people ultimately diagnosed as probable cases (Tan 2005) and in Taiwan only 24 of 480 (Hsieh et al. 2005) had been quarantined. Other contacts were identified in Singapore, but evidently their perceived risk did not warrant movement restriction.",

In Beijing, 30,178 close contacts of 2,521 probable cases were quarantined over the course of the epidemic (Pang et al. 2003). Analysis of a subset of those individuals with good records (covering 2,195 contacts of 582 patients from 5 districts) revealed a range in the probability of diagnosed illness among quarantined individuals from 0% to 15.4%, depending on their relationship to the patient. Transmission was relatively high among spouses, other relatives, friends, and other household members, and low among co-workers, schoolmates, and healthcare workers. Separately, Ou et al. (2003) studied geographically representative precincts throughout Haidian District, where 1,210 contacts of 171 patients were quarantined. The probability of infection among a subset of 383 quarantined people ranged from 0% to 31.1%, also depending on the nature of their contact with patients. Consistent with the findings of Pang et al. (2003), caring for ill household members imposed the greatest risk, followed by visiting and residing in the same household. In sharp contrast to the situation in Hong Kong, where a faulty sewage system at the Amoy Gardens apartment complex may have facilitated fecal-oral transmission (Hong Kong DOH, 2003), no risk was associated with sharing an apartment building or workplace. In Singapore, 73.5% of cases were infected in healthcare institutions (overall, 49.3% were healthcare workers, 37.4% friends or visitors, and 13% other patients), 17.2% at home, and 3.4% in the community or workplace (Goh et al. 2006).",

Interventions to reduce the average number of secondary infections (typically denoted \u211c) most expeditiously are preferable, provided all else (including, e.g., compliance and cost) is equal. The impact of such interventions depends crucially on pathogen life cycles and host contact patterns. Thus, in some environments, with some infectious agents, certain interventions may reduce disease transmission, whereas in other environments, or with other agents, the same interventions may not, despite being applied with equal diligence. As will be apparent, the natural history of SARS readily explains why encouraging people with compatible prodromal symptoms to seek care (and ensuring that clinicians and hospital infection control personnel had the wherewithal to diagnose and isolate them effectively) was only marginally less effective than quarantine. Because infected people are more easily identified when symptomatic, the greater efficiency of this intervention more than compensated for any deficit in its efficacy.",

Because \u211c\n = \n\u211c\n0(1 \u2212 \np), where \u211c\n0 is the basic reproduction number and p is the product of any intervention's efficiency and efficacy, we solve for the \u211c\n0 at which \u211c\n = 1, below which threshold outbreaks subside. With the aforementioned 5% efficiency observed in Singapore and Taiwan, and assuming 100% efficacy (i.e., quarantined people infected no one), evidently quarantine could not control any disease whose \u211c\n0\n > 1.05. Thus, while implementing this measure may have communicated authorities\u2019 concern about the situation \u2013 possibly increasing compliance with recommended hand washing, mask wearing, and social distancing practices \u2013 evidently quarantine per se contributed little to SARS control.",

Identifying only 11 probable cases among 7,863 contacts restricted to their homes in Singapore and 47 among 4,331 telephoned daily (Tan 2005) imposed significant (if unquantified) costs, apparently for minimal gains. We have dates of symptom onset and isolation for clinically diagnosed cases in Singapore, but do not know which had been quarantined or telephoned daily, so cannot determine if identified contacts were isolated any more quickly than others, as Tan's (2006) juxtaposition of weekly proportions of probable cases who had been identified as contacts and mean onset-isolation intervals suggests. Similarly, in Taiwan, only 24 probable cases were identified by quarantining 55,632 contacts and none by quarantining 95,828 travelers from SARS-affected areas (Hsieh et al. 2005). We do not know how many probable cases were quarantined in Beijing, but the ratio of contacts to patients reported by Pang et al. (2003) was 12; in Taiwan, this factor was 116 (316 including travelers), and in Singapore, it was 33 (51 including those telephoned).",

If we make the simplifying assumptions that probabilities of transmission on contact reflect infectiousness, which is proportional to viral load (successive logarithms of which can, in turn, be represented via a continuous statistical distribution), and that contact rates do not change substantially during illnesses, we can determine from the appropriate cumulative distribution function when isolation would have prevented \u211c\n0\n \u2212 1 infections.",

(2007) analyzed 614 serological samples, 96 throat washes, and 224 fecal samples from SARS patients to determine viral loads at successive times after symptom onset. As the causal agent was transmitted primarily via respiratory secretions (except possibly among residents of the Amoy Gardens apartment complex), it seems prudent to base our estimate on results from the throat washes. Given the assumptions outlined above, together with a gamma distribution, these results suggest that for a disease with \u211c\n0\n = 3, isolation that was 100% effective in blocking transmission could prevent \u211c\n0\n \u2212 1 infections (and thus lead to epidemic control) if implemented up to 5.2 days after symptom onset, on average (Fig. 1\n). The operational requirements can be calculated for any efficacy. For example, isolation that was only 80% effective should suffice to effect disease containment if implemented up to 4.4 days after symptom onset under the given assumptions, and so on. Analyses of the earlier studies of Peiris et al., 2003, Cheng et al., 2004 yield similar results. That said, we must emphasize that these simple calculations are intended to be heuristic. If contact rates declined sharply after symptom onset, for example, the time available for isolation would be overestimated. Day et al., 2006, Fraser et al., 2004, Lloyd-Smith et al., 2003 have developed frameworks for evaluating such questions more rigorously in future outbreaks of newly-emerging infectious diseases.",

The remarkable similarity of these observations in societies valuing different aspects of human nature suggests a common behavioral mechanism for the control progressively attained globally (Wallinga and Teunis 2004): As patients were not very infectious until acutely ill, evidently SARS was controlled by their earlier and probably progressively more effective isolation after symptom onset (Feng et al. 2009, Table 2), phenomena that authorities facilitated mainly (recall that only 58 of 238 probable cases in Singapore and 24/480 in Taiwan were traced) via effective health communications (Menon 2006) with healthcare providers as well as the general population (Chen et al. 2006). Others have noted that these times to event were not stationary (e.g., Anderson et al. 2004), which precludes fitting the otherwise appropriate gamma distribution (Donnelly et al., 2003, Riley et al., 2003), even by epoch (Leung et al. 2005).",

Even the best modeling is limited by inaccurate or incomplete information. And during health crises, humanitarian needs trump record-keeping. Nonetheless, to ensure that interventions are modeled realistically, epidemiologists must scrutinize all available information lest observations that seem invaluable in hindsight be underappreciated or even overlooked. For example, Lipsitch et al. (2003; Fig. 1d) observed that the mean number of secondary infections per case in Singapore climbed dramatically when time from onset to isolation exceeded four days. To our knowledge, however, the implication of this observation vis-\u00e0-vis the potential impact of case versus contact management has not heretofore been articulated. Nonetheless, the inference that infected people were not particularly infectious until acutely ill was subsequently substantiated by the isolation of the SARS coronavirus and assessment of viral loads and shedding as functions of time from symptom onset. Shortening the period between such observations and deductions will ensure that timely public health decisions are based on credible science in future.",

By their own account, the epidemiologists who performed the latter study would not have known what patterns to seek in historical records without the guidance provided by modeling. But do the apparently beneficial effects of historical school closures reliably translate into similar contemporary effects, given secular changes in family and workforce structure?

Thus, while endeavoring to \u201cstockpile enough [smallpox] vaccine for every man, woman, and child\u201d (Thompson 2002) may have reassured an electorate whose homeland had recently been violated, it also may have generated an expectation that will haunt us in future (when, e.g., production problems lead to shortages of influenza vaccine).

Knowledgeable public health practitioners might have cautioned against overestimating the potential impact of managing contacts of SARS patients, and interpreted observations suggesting that infected people were not particularly infectious until acutely ill as an indication for managing cases instead. In retrospect, we might encourage policymakers to interpret the progressive shortening of intervals between symptom onset and isolation characterizing most if not all SARS outbreaks as tangible evidence of the potential of effective health communications, which could be invaluable in future crises. Absent such observations, conveying complex and occasionally nonintuitive results supporting policy decisions to public health and medical professionals is challenging. Lay audiences are even more difficult. By virtue of age variation in vaccine efficacy, for example, modelers know that people at risk of influenza complications may be better protected by vaccinating those who might otherwise infect them than by being vaccinated themselves (Bansal et al. 2006). But do health policymakers? Nonetheless, where infectious diseases are concerned, citizens likely will act in ways they perceive as congruent with their own survival or self-interest, and that of their loved ones.
