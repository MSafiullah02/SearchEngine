This figure corresponds to 4% of the cases reported worldwide over the same period. Communicable diseases in the European Region account for 9% of the disease burden measured in disability-adjusted life years. This is largely attributable to high rates of tuberculosis and growing rates of HIV infection, particularly in central and eastern European countries and in central Asia, and to emerging and reemerging epidemic-prone diseases. Some of the most prominent public health programs currently being undertaken are the eradication of smallpox, the ongoing efforts to eradicate poliomyelitis and to eliminate measles, the Expanded Programme on Immunization, the Stop TB Partnership, the coordination of the global epidemic response to control SARS, and the ongoing efforts to contain the spread of influenza A/H5N1 virus (avian influenza) and to prepare for pandemic influenza.",

The ability of syndromic surveillance to detect outbreaks earlier than conventional surveillance methods depends on such factors as the size of the outbreak, the population dispersion of those affected, the data sources and syndrome definitions used, the criteria for investigating threshold alerts, and health-care providers' ability to detect and report unusual cases [36] .",

The IHR aim to limit interference with international traffic and trade, ensuring public health through the prevention of disease spread. The IHR require countries to report certain disease outbreaks and public health events to WHO [5, 6, 40] . Building on the unique experience of WHO in global disease surveillance, alert, and response, the IHR define the rights and obligations of countries to report public health events and establish a number of procedures that WHO must follow in its work to uphold global public health security. Within the framework of the IHR [4] , seven areas of work have been identified to achieve the goals described above. The first area of work aims to strengthen global partnerships; the second and third address countries' capacities to meet IHR requirements; the fourth and fifth areas of work focus on surveillance, prevention, control, and response systems at the international level; and the sixth and seventh address awareness of rules and legal aspects and measuring progress ( Table 2) .

Because it is a serious and uncommon syndrome, each individual case reported is an alert and triggers an action. For other diseases, such as influenza, targeted by acute respiratory illness, the alert for action is a rise in reported syndrome cases, indicating the onset of the influenza season. ALERT was able to detect this increase during the 2008 season. However, other categories of syndromes have not been sensitive or specific enough to detect outbreaks in a timely fashion. Timely detection of public health threats relies on proper analysis of early-warning data at each level. ALERT software produces automated tables, charts, and maps highlighting increases. Epidemiologists should use those resources to trigger actions when individual confirmed cases are reported.",

The final goal is, by comparing the advantages and disadvantages of both systems, to enable the creation (establishment) of a new, combined system that would be more functional, safer, and more economically sustainable. On the basis of our experiences, the obligation for syndromic reporting through EWARS will be laid down in our national law.
