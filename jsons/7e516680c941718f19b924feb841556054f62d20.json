            "text": "The assignment of structure in general by NMR in highly condensed heterocyclic aromatic compounds is complicated because of the difficulty in defining the correct regioisomer from among many possibilities. However, these problems can be solved by employing new powerful multipulse NMR techniques like HMQC, HMBC, INADEQUATE, INAPT. J CH Coupling constant analysis has been helpful in the resolution of ambiguous structural assignments. When suitable crystals of the compound are available, single crystal X-ray diffraction analysis has given definitive structures. Because the ring system (1) is highly conserved, some general features in the appearance of the 1 H NMR spectra are common to most of these alkaloids and useful in identifying a member of this class of compounds. The disubstituted benzo ring A gives rise to a distinctive linear four proton coupled spin network (H 1 -H 4 , 7.0-9.0 ppm, J = 8-9 Hz) with H 1 resonating at lowest field due to the deshielding acridine nitrogen. A second AB spin system (8.5, 9.0 ppm, J = 5.6 Hz) is assignable to H 5 -H 6 , the protons of a trisubstituted pyridine ring. A strong NOE (ca. 20%) is seen between the two \" bay region\" protons, H 4 -H 5 , thus, linking these two nonscalar-coupled substructures.",

It is often found that pyridoacridines isolated from such tunicates are the pigments (zoochromes) responsible for their coloration. Pyridoacridines act as a pH indicator. The indicator properties is correlated with the presence of at least two basic pyridine like nitrogen and is probably associated with electronic perturbations of an extended chromophore with charge-transfer properties.

Colored tunicate (900 g, wet weight) was collected and kept frozen until used. The methanol-toluene (3:1) extract of C. dellechiajei was partitioned with toluene and water. It was observed that toluene soluble portion exhibited potent cytotoxicity against L1210 murine leukemia cells. The toluene soluble portion was chromatographed by using CHCl 3 /CH 3 OH (98.5:1.5) as an eluant followed by a Sephadex LH-20 column (CHCl 3 /CH 3 OH, 1:l) to yielded yellow crystals of cystodytins A (2) and B (6) in 0.022% yield. Separation of (2), and (6) was very difficult as both of the compounds had the same retention times on HPLC, silica gel or ODs under different solvent systems. The aqueous layer also exhibited modest cytotoxicity against L1210 and was purified by the same procedure and afforded cystodytin C (7) in 0.0003% yield as yellow crystals in addition to 38 mg of mixture of cystodytin A and B. Both of the compounds were separated, and EIMS of free base (2) showed the molecular ion at m/z 357 (M + ). Molecular formula for compound (2) was determined to be C 22 H 19 N 3 O 2 by FAB-HRMS (m/z 357.1707). The UV spectrum of (2) exhibited absorptions at 225 (\u03b5 35000), 272 (\u03b5 25000), and 380 (\u03b5 14300) nm. Absorption at 1640 and 1660 cm -1 in IR and the resonances at \u03b4 167.8-170.3 and 183.2 in the 13 C NMR indicated the presence of an amide and a conjugated ketone carbonyl group, respectively in compound (2) . The RCT-COSY spectrum of (2) revealed cross peaks of H-5 to H-6, H-9 to H2-12 and H2-13, H2-12 to H2-13, H-16 to H3-18 and H3-19, H3-18 to H3-19, and among H-1-H-4, respectively. The final structure of compound (2) was determined with the help of l H-13 C COSY experiments. The bright red tunicate Lissoclinum vareau (Monniot and Monniot, 1987), was collected from Yasawa Island chain, in the Fiji Island. Crude methanol extract of the tunicate exhibited potent antifungal and cytotoxicity against the L1210 murine leukemia cell line. The chloroform soluble fraction of the extract yielded two bright red pigments, varamine A (16) and varamine B (17) . The spectral data of (16) and (17) revealed that the two compounds (16, 17) were related as homologues, and structure elucidation was carried out primarily on the trifluoroacetate salt of 16. Molecular formula of varamine A (16) was determined to be C 22 H 23 N 3 O 2 S by FABMS data (m/z 394.1589 M + ). The ultraviolet spectrum of the free base of (16) revealed strong bands from 232 to 494 nm. In particular, the striking color change from yellow to intense red upon acidification of the freebase of (16) was correlated with a reversible bathochromic shift 464 nm (\u03b5 5170) to 527 nm (\u03b5 5670 nm). In the 1 H NMR of TFA salt of (16) six proton signals found between \u03b4 7.20 and 8.30 ppm were assigned to deshielded protons of the heteroaromatic ring. The resonance at \u03b4 7.52 (d, J = 6.5 Hz) and 8.21 (d, J = 6.5 Hz) were assigned to H-5 and H-6, respectively, in a trisubstituted pyridine ring.",

            "text": "The pentacyclic pyridoacridine alkaloids could be classified into two groups: (a) those having one additional angular-fused ring at C9, 10 of the acridine system at C8, C9 of ring C and (b) those having linear-ring fusion at C8, C9 of ring C. Typical ring appendages include pyridine, tetrahydropyridine, pyridone, thiazine, or even a thiazole heterocycle. In some cases, a substituted 2-ethylamino side chain is also attached to the acridine C ring. The bright yellow zoochrome calliactine isolated from the mediterranean anemone, Calliactis parasitica, has a long history and is probably the first marine pyridoacridine alkaloid isolated from marine organisms. Calliactine attracted the attention of Lederer et al 28 in 1940 and later by Barbier 29 however, the structure determination work was hampered by low solubility of the compound and the difficulties in purification. In 1987, Cimino et al 30 reported their studies on the degradation and NMR spectroscopy of calliactine and its derivatives. Calliactine is readily aromatized (presumably autoxidation elimination with concomitant hydrolytic loss of ammonia) by boiling with dilute HCl to give \" chlorocalliactine\" or with water to give \" neocalliactine\" A strong nuclear overhauser effect from H-5 to H-4 indicates the close proximity of the respective ring residues. Stretches around 1650 and at 3200, 3280, and 3450 cm -l confirmed the presence of amide, and NH functionalities. A thiomethyl group (SCH 3 ) appeared as singlet of three proton at \u03b4 2.66. Additional evidence comes from 1 J CH values for the methyl groups; these were most easily obtained by measuring the separation of the inner peaks of the methyl 13 C satellites in the proton spectrum of (16) or (17) . The moderately large one bond coupling constant ( 1 J CH = 141 Hz) for the methyl carbon at 18.7 ppm is similar to that measured for the electronegative methoxy group. Finally structure (16) , and (17) were confirmed by 2D NMR spectroscopy. Ring C of varamine-A (16) isoelectronic with hydroquinone, was readily oxidized by aqueous ceric ammonium nitrate to the iminoquinone (18) in quantitative yield. 25 The corresponding oxidation product (3) of varamine-B (17) was found identical with diplamine from the Fijian tunicate, Diplosoma sp. 27 Another homologue in this series, isobutyramide (19) , 18, 27 has been characterized from an unidentified Australian tunicate. which in turn yielded neocallicatine acetate when treated with acetic anhydride in pyridine. The molecular formula C 18 H 21 N 4 O was established for calliactine, and several possible structures (20a-20d) were advanced. Four possible structures (21a-21d) for neocalliactine acetate were also proposed. However, definitive assignments have not yet been reported on either of these compounds. The amphimedine (22) is the first pyridoacridine alkaloid to be fully characterized. 31 Schmitz et al 31 isolated amphimedine (22) , a sparingly soluble yellow solid (m.p. 360\u00b0C) sponge Amphimedon sp. was collected from Guam Island. Ambient temperature extraction with CH 2 Cl 2 , CHCl 3 -MeOH, MeOH followed by hot Soxhlet extraction with CHCl 3 and finally purification by coloumn chromatography yielded pure compound. Molecular formula of (22) was established as C 19 H 11 N 3 O 2 by high-resolution mass spectral analysis (m/z 313.08547, M + ). In the mass spectrum few fragments were observed which indicated that the compound is highly stable. The electronic absorption Further since the absorption was observed at lower frequency so these peaks were attributed to \u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated ketone and amide functionalities, respectively. The 13 C NMR data reconfirmed the presence of an amide carbonyl (C-11 , \u03b4 165.9) and a cross-conjugated ketone (C-8, \u03b4 175.0). The 2D NMR 13 C-13 C INADEQUATE NMR techniques were used for the structural elucidation of amphimedine (22) . [32] [33] [34] Amphimedine (22) is selectively brominated (Br 2 , acetic acid) to give the mono bromo derivative (23) . Neoamphimedine (24) , 23 along with amphimedine (22) and debromopetrosamine (25a), have been isolated from the Micronesian sponge Xestospongia carbonaria. 9 Neoamphimedine (24) is a regioisomer of amphimedine (22) . Kobayashi et al 35 have isolated ascididemin (26) 6,17,36 from a species of Didemnum collected in Okinawa. The structural proof relied on extensive use of long-range 1 H-13 C correlation (COLOC) data and comparison, with the properties of amphimedine (22) . It is noteworthy that ascididemin (26), like related pyridoacridine alkaloids which have a 1,10-phenanthroline ring system, does not form a bright red complex with Fe 2+ that is characteristically observed with 1,10-phenanthroline itself.",

Samples were immersed in methanol imparted a deep green-blue color to the solvent. This extract when diluted with water, the color changed to purple. The brominated pigment petrosamine (31a and 31b) along with tryptamine have been (29) isolated from this extract. 41 Faulkner et al 41 isolated petrosamine (31) , from marine sponge Petrosia sp. while attempting to purify an antimicrobial constituent amphimedine (22) . Petrosamine is remarkable compound since color of the solution containing (31) changes by the addition of dilute organic or aqueous solutions. It was observed that blue colored methanol extracts of Petrosia sp. exhibited antimicrobial activity against Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus subtilis. The marine sponge Petrosia sp. was collected from Carrie Bow Cay, Belize and methanol soluble material portion was partitioned to ethyl acetate, n-butanol, and aqueous extracts. A blue band and pale yellow band from n-butanol soluble material was separated on Sephadex LH-20 (MeOH) column. The blue compound was repurified on Sephadex LH-20 column and yielded petrosamine (0.1% dry weight) as dark green crystals, m.p. >330\u00b0C. Molecular formula of petrosamine was established as C 21 H 17 BrN 3 O 2 by high resolution mass spectrum. Both the 1 H and 13 C NMR spectra indicated the presence of three N-methyl signals, two of which were equivalent. The remaining signals were all in the aromatic region of the The deep-water sponge Dercitus sp. has yielded the dark violet pigment named dercitin (32) together with dimethylindolinium chloride. 42 The structure of (32) was assigned on the basis of spectroscopic data including 2D INADEQUATE.

In the revised structure, the nitrogen and sulphur of the thiazole ring are in correct position relative to other acridine substituents. The thiazole ring proton exhibits different J CH to each of the two ring junction quaternary carbons, thus providing unambiguous assignment of the respective 13 C signals. 43 The ease with which a partially reduced pyridoacridine system can be aromatized was demonstrated when the dihydropyridoacridine (34), obtained spectra, except for a 13 C NMR signal at \u03b4 187.4 (s) that could be assigned to a single quinone-type carbonyl group. X-ray crystallography in the solid state of petrosamine revealed that the pigment exists as the chloride salt of a quaternized pyridone-acridine ring system (31a). Correlation of the solventdependent changes in the UV and NMR spectra suggested that the remarkable color change observed by varying solvent polarity, was associated with shifts in the position of a keto enol equilibrium, favoring the enol form (31b). 44 have reported the isolation of four minor congeners from Dercitus sp. Of these, nordercitin (35) and dercitamine (36) are related to dercitin (33) . Reductive methylation of dercitamine (HCO 2 H, HCHO) gave nordercitin (35) . Dercitamicle (37) contains a propionamide side chain and cyclodercitin (38) is a hexacyclic quaternary salt.",

Molecular formula of segoline A (47) was established as C 23 H 19 N 3 O 3 . Intensive 1D and 2D NMR experiments such as COSY, NOE, short-and long-range CH correlations, COLOC, and HETCOSY studies were conducted on (47) . The proton NMR data revealed a trisubstituted benzo-3,6-diazaphenanthroline ring system for segoline A. The pyridine ring of the diazaphenanthroline ring was characterized by the H-2 and H-3 signals. The pyridine moiety was hydrogenated easly to the 1,2,3,3a-tetrahydro derivative indicated that it was part of a quinoline ring. The heterocyclic ring system was confirmed by the NOEs between H-2 and H-3, H-3 and H-4, H-5 and H-6, and H-6 and H-7. Unequivocal structure of (47) was determined by single X-ray analysis. The structure of isosegoline A (48) is determined by NMR spectroscopic techniques. Segoline B (49) is a diastereoisomer of segoline A (47) . In segoline B (49), the bridge across the cyclic imide ring is inverted. This is supported by the strongly bisignated CD curves for (48) and (49) , which are almost exactly opposite in sign. The structure of eilatin (50) and unusual pyridoacridine \" pseudo-dimer\" , has been solved by X-ray diffraction. Eilatin (50) 51 is the only known heptacyclic pyridoacridine alkaloid.",

            "text": "The alkaloids of this group are mostly cytotoxic. Pyrroloacridines have similar ring construction to the pyridoacridine alkaloids. However, they contain a fused pyrrole ring rather than the familiar trisubstituted pyridine ring. The first example of this class are plakinidine 53-55 A (53) and B (54) which have been isolated from the sponge Plakortis sp. 53 Ireland et al 56 reported the isolation of plakinidine-A (53), B (54) and C (55) from Plakortis sp. collected in Fiji. Bioassay-guided isolation of red sponge Plakortis has afforded two novel alkaloids named plakinidine-A (53) and B (54) . Both of the compounds showed in vitro activity against the parasite Nippostrongylus brasiliensis (at 50 pg/mL). A pyrrolo[2,3,4-kl]acridine fused-ring skeleton in (53) and (54), represents a new structural variation within polycyclic aromatic alkaloids carbon of the acridine system. The relative stereochemistry of the carbon skeleton was determined by comparison of NMR coupling constants with values predicted from molecular modeling. The two compounds were correlated by autoxidation. Eudistone (51) aromatized to (52) when air is bubbled in a solution of (51) in DMSO. 52 The circular dichroism spectrum of eudistone-B (52) exhibited a strong bisignate cotton effect. However, the absolute configuration of the two compounds remains unknown. from marine organisms. The organism was collected by scuba at 10 m off Hideaway island, Port Vila, Vanuatu. Red viscous oil (3.87 g) was obtained from aqueous methanol extracts of the preserved organism (0.2 kg, wet). The crude oil after partitioned between aqueous MeOH and the solvent series of hexanes, CCl 4 , CH 2 Cl 2 were separated by column chromatography (reversed phase and Sephadex LH-20/methanol). Plakinidine A (53) was isolated as deep purple solid from methanol (52 mg, 0.026% wet weight, mp. 248-250\u00b0C) along with 24 mg (0.012%) of a purple oil identified as plakinidine B (54) . The molecular formula of (53) was determined as C l8 H 14 N 4 O, from EI-HRMS (m/z 302.1169, M + ) and an APT 13 C NMR spectrum. Four separate proton spin systems were confirmed by COSY experiments in DMSO-d 6 and CDC1 3 -TFA-d 4 (1:1). Protons on N-8 to C-10 were assigned to a CH 2 CH 2 N(H) group, and protons on C-3 to C-6 were confirmed to be a part of orthodisubstituted benzene ring. Other protons H-2, was a low-field singlet (\u03b4 8.84) with a large 1 J CH coupling constant (200.4 Hz in CDCl 3 -TFA-d 4 ), indicating a nitrogen was adjacent to C-2. 57 Based on the 13 C chemical shifts remaining fragment consisting C 9 N atoms were assumed to have five double bonds. Long-range 1 H-13 C COSY experiments were done to confirm the structure of the compounds. Three bond correlations to H-4 and H-5 revealed the location of quaternary carbons in the molecule. The existence of a sixmembered ring \u03b2-enamino ketone was confirmed by the IR (1624 cm -1 ) and COSY NMR correlations from H 2 -9 to C-7b and from H 2 -10 to C-11 and C-1la. Finally, two dimensional 13 C-13 C INADEQUATE was used to verify most of the structural elements of plakinidine A. 57 Bioassay guided purification of the methanol-toluene extract of the tropical green sponge Prianos melanos from Okinawa gave a cytotoxic pigment, prianosin A (56), prianosin B (57), prianosin C (58) and prianosin D (59). 58, 59 Several independent reports described the identification of discorhabdins, compounds similar to prianosins. [60] [61] [62] [63] [64] The first report described the isolation and structure elucidation of discorhabdin-C (60) an achiral spiro-alkaloid. Discorhabdin-A identical to prianosin-A, (56) 65 Each discorhabdin or prianosin contains an unsaturated cyclohexenone and spiro-fused to a tetracyclic ring system. Each ring system, with exception of discorhabdin C (60) is also bridged with tetrahydrothiophene ring. A deep-water collection of Batzella sp. from Bahamas has furnished three pyrroloquinolines, batzellines A-C (63-65). 66 Each alkaloid has tetrahydroquinoline nucleus further, bridged across both rings by a trisubstituted pyrrole ring. An unusual chlorine atom is present in all the alkaloids. Sources and cytotoxities of many marine pyridoacridines that have been reviewed recently 74 are summarized in Table 1 . Total synthesis of many of the alkaloids have been achieved. Synthesis of cystodytin-A and B have been published by Cinfolini et al 103 using an efficient intramolecular photochemical nitrene insertion into an aryl substituted dihydroisoquinoline. Three total synthesis of amphimedine have been reported. [104] [105] [106] Synthesis of bromoleptoclinidone and ascidemin have also been published. 107, 108 Total synthesis of most of the pyridoacridines given in Table 1 have also been achieved. New pyridoacridine structures provide fertile area for the design and execution of biologically active heterocyclic molecules. 109 Newer synthetic strategies are emerging for efficient assembly of tetracyclic and pentacyclic ring system.",

            "text": "Mostly all of the pyridoacridines discovered so far have shown strong in vitro cytotoxic activity. The activity has been related to the ability of pyridoacridines to intercalate DNA, so inhibit DNA metabolizing enzymes. Pyridoacridines also exhibited antiviral, antimicrobial, insecticidal, fungicidal, and other activities. Some pyridoacridines have also shown excellent antitumor activity in various models, while others have proven too toxic to be useful for clinical purposes. Pyridoacridine alkaloids show in vitro cytotoxicity against cultured tumor cells (L 1210 murine leukemia, P 388 , etc.) or antineoplastic activity in whole animal experiments. Dercitin (33) inhibits a variety of cultured cell clones at nanomolar concentrations and shows antitumor activity in mice and modest antiviral activity against Herpes simplex and A-58 murine corona virus at micromolar concentration. 42 Dercitin (33) exhibited strong inhibition of HSV-1 at 5 \u03b4g mL -1 with moderate cytotoxicity. It also completely inhibited murine A59 coronavirus at 1 \u00b5g mL -1 with no cytotoxicity. 17 A thorough study by Burres et al 110 has shown that dercitin (33) inhibits both DNA and RNA synthesis upto 83% at 400 nM, but protein synthesis is effected to a lesser extent. Dercitin also binds to calf thymus DNA and relaxed supercoiled \u03c6 \u00d7 174 DNA at 36 nM and inhibited DNA polymerase and DNase nick translation at 1 nM. Collectively these results suggest that inhibition of enzyme activity by dercitin is of secondary importance, and its activity is entirely consistent with potent intercalation of nucleic acids. The activities of dercitin (33) and its analogues have been compared, and the nature of pharmacophores in dercitin responsible for antiviral and antitumor activities has been identified. In contrast to dercitin (33), neoamphimedine (24) is found to be a potent inhibitor of purified mammalian topoisomerase II (IC 50 1.3 \u00b5M), but not of topoisomerase I. Neoamphimedine (24) is also shown to intercalate DNA with a K m of 2.8 \u00d7 10 5 M -1 and a binding site size of 1.8 base pairs per molecule of 24. Interestingly, the isomeric base amphimedine (22) , petrosamine (4) and debromopetrosamine (25) , had little effect on topoisomerase I or II activity, despite displaying comparable cytoxicity. It is postulated that the cytotoxicity of (24) towards mammalian cells can be explained by DNA damage resulting from native topoisomerase II inhibition. However, the other pyridoacridin alkaloids may elicit cytotoxicity through as yet unidentified mechanisms associated with DNA processing. Ascididemin (26) and shermilamine B (40) also inhibited topoisomerase II, albeit at higher concentration (75 and 30 \u00b5M, respectively), while shermilamine A (39) and meridine (29) are found inactive. 14 Benzo [4, 5] sampangin and ascididemin possess potent antiviral activity while kuanoniamine A appeared inactive. Benzo [4, 5] sampangin showed complete inhibition of HSV-1 at 80 \u00b5g mL -1 with no host cell toxicity (BSC-1 green monkey cells). It also displayed activity against polio virus type 1 (partial inhibition at 80 \u00b5g mL -1 with no detectable cytotoxicity to the Pfizer vaccine strain) and HIV-1 (46% protection at 0.7 \u00b5M with host cell toxicity at 10 \u00b5M). 111 Hollow fiber assay and tumor implant assays have been developed for antitumor activity assays to assess the antitumor activity of pyridoacridines. [112] [113] [114] [115] Mainly two of types of the tumor models have been used to assess pyridoacridines. In the first, mouse leukemia cells (P338 cells) are injected into the peritoneum of DBA/2 mice. These mice live for approximately 10 days. The tumor bearing mice are then treated with the test drug, which is administered i.p. and response is measured as increased life span (%ILS). 2-Bromoleptoclinidinone had an excellent in vitro cytotoxicity, but when tested in xenograft models, proved too toxic to yield significant antitumor responses. 116 Ascididemin was also tested in vivo at the National Cancer Institute, USA against twelve human tumor cell lines by hollow fiber assay and was shown to exhibited significant activity (%T/C < 50) against six of the cell lines. 117 In vitro activity of several pyridoacridines on markers of leukemia and tumor growth have been assessed. Dercitin (33) and Kuanoniamine have been evaluated for the cytotoxic acitvity and observed that they are approximately equally potent against a solid human lung cancer line and a mouse leukemia line. 118 Although wakayin (70) exhibits marginal inhibitory activity toward topoisomerase II (250 \u00b5M), it showed an interestingly differential cytotoxicity against mammalian cell clones that is indicative of DNA damage or interference with DNA procesisng. 68 It has been demonstrated that the fluorescence spectrum of kuanoniamine D (44) is quenched upon addition of calf thymus DNA, and the emission wavelength of 534 nm (excitation at 350 nm) changed to 593 nm. Both of these findings are suggestive of alkaloid binding to DNA. The two \" bay region\" nitrogen's in 2-bromoleptoclinidone ( 27) is ideally disposed to present two donor nitrogen atoms of a bidentate ligand to metals. Alkaloid (27) forms an octahedral complex with Ru (II) salts that induces photo activated single strand cleavage of supercoiled PBR 322 DNA under visible light irradiation. 119 It is interesting to note that cytotoxic cystodytins-A (2) and B (6) are found to be potent Ca 2+ release agents, and stimulated calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) at 36 and 13 times the potency of caffeine, respectively. 16 Ascididemin, benzo [4, 5] sampangine, deazaascididemin were found activity against Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis, Candida albicans, and Cladisporium resinae, with an MIC of 0.39 \u00b5g mL -1 against C. albicans. 120 Cystodytin was found active against E. coli and Staphylococcus aureus. 110 Sampangine and several analogues exhibited potent antimicrobial activity against the opportunistic infection organisms C. albicans, Cryptococcus neoformans, Aspergillus fumigatus, and Mycobacterium intracellulare. 121 Limited information is available in the literature regarding the insecticidal activity of pyridoacridine. 122 Kuanoniamines were studied extensively using neonatal Spodoptera littoralis larvae and the 50% lethal concentration (LC 50 ) was determined.",

The major alkaloid (72) (m.p. 239-240\u00b0C) is responsible for the antiinflammatory effect. 127 Sponges have yielded brominated tryptamines, 5,6-dibromotryptamine (73) and N b -methyl-5,6-dibrmotryptamine (74) are obtained from the sponge Polyfibro spongia australis. The bromoindole derivatives showed in vitro Gram-negative, Gram-positive antibacterial activity, and platelet aggregation inhibitory activity. 128 Carboline Alkaloids Rinehart and others have searched systematically pharmaceutically useful compounds from marine species. [129] [130] [131] [132] [133] Initial efforts have been involved surveying of antibacterial and antifungal organisms, with bioassays carried out on shipboard. Later on, focus was shifted to antiviral and cytotoxic compounds. The most active antiviral extract in shipboard testing was obtained from a tunicate subsequently identified as Eudistoma olivaceum, but the extract was surprisingly found inactive in the secondary assay. When the tunicate was recollected, its extracts proved very active in both primary and secondary assay against Herpes simplex and other viruses. The Eudistoma extract yielded eudistomins variously substituted \u03b2-carbolines. All the compounds isolated had antimicrobial or antiviral activity, but the most potent are the tetracyclic eudistomins with the unique oxathiazepine ring (eudistomins C, E, K, L). [130] [131] [132] [133] Their structures are assigned by spectroscopic techniques (high resolution, FABMS, high resolution EIMS, 13 C NMR, UV) and by partial synthesis. Eudistomins C, E, K, and L have been assigned the structure (75), (76), (77) and (78), respectively. 129, 134 The stereochemistry of eudistomins (76) (77) (78) has been determined by NMR, 135 and the absolute stereochemistry of eudistomin K (77) was determined by single crystal Xray structural, analysis of its 4-bromobenzyl derivative. 136, 137 A new manzamine related tetrahydro-\u03b2-carboline alkaloid with a methylene bridge between N-2 and N-27 and named eghedin-A was isolated from an Okinawan marine sponge Amphimedon sp. Its structure was determined on the basis of spectroscopic data. The compound exhibited antibacterial activity against Sarcina lutea (MIC = 2.8 g/mL), and Corynobacterium xerosis (5.7 g/mL) and showed cytotoxicity against murine leukemia L 1210 cells (IC 50 Fascaplysin (81), 140-143 a blood red pigment obtained from a Fijian sponge Fascaplysinopsis sp. Fascaplysin (81) , exhibits antimicrobial and cytotoxic properties. 144 Chartelline A (82) a unique \u03b2-lactam indole alkaloid, which exhibits cytotoxicity in vitro against KB, and PS cell lines, has been isolated from a marine bryozoan Chartella papyracea collected in North Britanny waters. 145 The biosynthesis of this new class of alkaloid appears quite interesting. It will be worth to know whether chartelline-A (82) is a true bryozoan metabolite or produced by some microorganism. ",

However, it was found inactive in vivo. It also displayed antitumor activity. The alkaloid (87) has been synthesized. 153 The purple colored bacterium of the genus Alteromonas 154 yielded a tetrabromo pyrrole (88) 13 C NMR data were in agreement with the proposed molecular formula. The NMR spectra of the base was compared with a oroidin and it was found that it has one less NH signal than oroidin and an additional methyl signal at 3.89 ppm which was assigned as an N-methyl group. The presence of HMBC correlations from the N-methyl group to C-2 and C-5, and absence of the pyrrole NH established the structure of sventrin as N(pyrrole)-methyl oroidin = sventrin). Dibromo pyrrole carboxylic acid showed in vitro immunosuppressive activity. 161 The Caribbean colonial tunicate Eudistoma olivaceum has afforded a number of \u03b2-carboline alkaloids. Of these, eudistomin-A (90) has a pyrrole-\u03b2-carboline and eudistomin-G (91) has pyrrolinyl-\u03b2-carboline structures. Several other eudistomins have also been isolated from this source. 162, 163 An Okinawan tunicate Eudistoma glaucus has yielded eudistomidin A derivative (92) . 164 The compound (92) exhibits strong calmodulin antagonistic activity, and is the first calmodulin antagonist of marine origin.

Repetitive reversed phase HPLC of active fractions afforded ageladine-A (97) as yellow powder. The structure of this novel marine natural product was determined by the use of spectral techniques such as LR, HR-FABMASS, 1D/2D-NMR, 13 C NMR. The FABMS spectra showed (MH) + clusture at m/z 356/358/360 in the 1:2:1 ratio. Presence of clusture of peaks in the ratio of 1:2:1 is typical for the presence of two bromine atoms. On the basis of FAB-HRMS and 13 C NMR spectral data molecular formula of ageladine-A (97) was established as C 10 H 7 N 5 Br 2 indicating the presence of nine double bonds in the compound. The final structure of this compound was established by using 2D NMR and 13 C NMR spectral data. Ageladine-A (97) showed antiangiogenic activity. 170",

Of these, renierone (98) exhibits high order of antibacterial activity. 172, 173 Since the sponge contained relatively small quantities of the alkaloids, the possibility of a symbiotic microorganism origin cannot be ruled out. All the alkaloids isolated from the sponge Reniera sp. exhibit antimicrobial activity against selected terrestrial and marine microorganisms. Renierone (98) and N-formyl-1,2-dihydrorenierones (99 and 100) both inhibit cell division in the fertilized sea urchin egg assay. 174 New dimeric isoquinoline alkaloid Juromycin has been isolated from the skin and mucus of the pacific nudibranch Jorunna funebris. The compound exhibited potent cytotoxicity against various cancer cell lines. 175 An usual isoquinoline alkaloid imbricatine (101) has been isolated from the starfish Dermasterias imbricata. 176 The alkaloid (101) displays significant antineoplastic activity.",

The tunicate Molgula manhattensis has yielded two tunichromes (108 and 109) which are reported to accumulate the metal. 187 The sea anemone Sagartia troglodytes 188 has afforded 1-iminomethyl-3methyl-6-aminomethyl-9H-purine (110) which inhibits the growth of tumors viruses of plant or bacteria. However, its activity is less than 1,2-diaminopurine. The North East Pacific bryozoan Phidolopora pacifica [189] [190] [191] [192] contained desmethylphidolopin (111) which exhibits antimicrobial activity. The Astroides calucularis 193 A Pyrrolopyrimidine alkaloid rigidin (113) 194, 195 has been obtained from the Okinawan tunicate Eudistoma cf. rigida. 194 Rigidin (113) displays calmodulin antagonistic activity. 194 The tunicate Cystodytes sp. (1.6 kg, wet weight) was collected from Ie Island, Okinawa, and was extracted with MeOH which gave EtOAc soluble materials. Ethyl acetate soluable portion was purified on silica gel coloumn and C18 column chromatography and C18 HPLC to afford known compounds rigidin (113, 12 mg, 0.00075%), iejimalides A-D 196, 197 and dytesinins A and B 198 along with unknown alkaloids rigidins B (114, 4.9 mg, 0.00031%, wet weight), C (115, 1.3 mg, 0.00008%), and D (115, R 1 = R 2 = OMe, 0.6 mg, 0.00004%). Molecular formula of rigidin B (114) was established as C 20 H 16 N 3 O 6 by HR-FABMS [m/z 394.1029 (M+H) + ] which was larger than that of rigidin (113) by a OCH 2 unit. Absorption bands at 3420 and 1666 cm -1 in the IR spectrum indicated the presence of OH, NH and carbonyl group(s), respectively. Presence of conjugated phenol chromophore was confirmed by the UV absorptions at 364 (\u03b5 9400), 319 (\u03b5 9600), 304 (sh), 278 (\u03b5 13200), 236 (sh), and 206 nm (\u03b5 31400). Out of 13 proton signals in the 1 H NMR spectrum of (114), five of were D 2 Oexchangeable, and the others were due to seven methines and one methoxy group. In the 13 1 H-13 C HMBC correlations for H-9 and H-13 to C-11, H-10 and H-12 to C-8, and OH-11 to C-10, C-11, and C-12 indicated the presence of an 11-hydroxyphenyl group (C-8-C-13). On the other hand, the existence of an 18-hydroxy-17-methoxybenzoyl moiety (C14-C20) was inferred by 1 H-13 C HMBC correlations for H-16 to C-14, C-18, and C-20, H-19 to C-15 and C-17, H-20 to C-18, 17-OCH3 to C-17, and 18-OH to C-17, C-18, and C-19. A pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidine-2,4-dione core of (114) was assigned by detailed analysis of the 1 H- 13 205 and zoanthaminone 206 a new class of alkaloids have been isolated from a new species of colonial zoanthial of the genus Zoanthus collected from the Bay of Bengal. The structure of zoanthamine (116) has been determined by X-ray crystallographic analysis. 200 The alkaloids (116-119) display inhibitory activity in the phorbol acetate (PMA)-induced mouse ear inflammatory assay as well as analgesic activity. The biosynthesis of these alkaloid is very fascinating and the studies will be rewarding. The marine worm Cephalodiscus gilchristi collected in the Indian Ocean has afforded cephalostatins which were powerful cell growth inhibitory substances against PS cell lines. [207] [208] [209] [210] [211] [212] [213] The structure of cephalostatin I (120) has been determined by X-ray analysis. It is suggested that cephalostatins could be formed in nature by condensation of 2-amino-3-oxo-steroid units. The two steroidal units are connected by a pyrazine ring. Extract of the Okinawan tunicate Pseudodistoma kanoko yielded the anti neoplastic piperine alkaloids pseudodistomin A (121) and B (122) which displayed calmodulin antagonistic activity. 214 Pseudodistomins are the first piperidine alkaloids found in marine organisms. The Fijian sponge Niphates sp. has afforded the pyridine alkaloids, niphatynes A and B. 215 Aplysepine (123) 216 the first 1,4-benzo-diazepine alkaloid of marine origin was isolated from the sea hare Aplysia kurodi. The structure of aplysepine was elucidated on the basis of the spectral data. The new Guinea shell-less mollusk Dolabella auricularia was found to contain a series of green-blue Hamacanthin was isolated from a new deep water sponge, Hamacantha sp. The hamacanthins were found to be the growth inhibitors of Candida albicans and Cryptococcus neobormans. [219] [220] [221] [222] The major metabolite of the Philippine sponge Oceanapia sp. was the antimicrobial alkaloid oceanapamine (125) which was isolated a a trifluoroacetate salt. The structure and absolute configuration of oceanapamine were determined by the spectroscopic data. The compound showed antimicrobial activity, it inhibited B. subtitis and E. coli at 25 g/disk, S. aureus and C. albicans at 50 g/disk and P. aeruginosa at 100 g/disk. 223 Pyrrolo[4,3,2-de]quinolines and pyrido[4,3,2-mn]acridine were of major interest as metabolites in sponge and ascidians. Many of these compounds had generated interest both as challenging problems for structural elucidation and synthesis as well as for their cytotoxicity. The principal structural feature of these alkaloids was the core of a planar iminoquinone moiety which tercalate into DNA and cleave the DNA double helix or inhibit chlorins. One of these compounds was found to be the nickel chelat tunichlorin (124) which was isolated previously only from the caribbean tunicate Trididemnum solidum. Discovery of tunichlorin (124) in sea hare suggested that its occurrence is algae consuming marine animals may be more common than earlier realized. It is suggested that it may have a role in electron transfer or other metabolic process in mullusc. 217 Three imidazole alkaloids, leucettamines A and B, and leucettramidine were isolated from the Palawan sponge Leucetta microraphis and their structures were elucidated on the basis of extensive spectral analyses. Leucettamine A showed potent leukotriene B4 receptor binding activity (K i = 1.3 M). 218 ",

The methanolic extract of the ingenamine G displayed cytotoxic activity against HCT-8 (colon), B16 (leukemia), and MCF-7 (breast) cancer cell lines, antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 25923), Escherichia coli (ATCC 25922), and four oxacilin-resistant S. aureus strains, and antimycobacterial activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv. The sponge, (2.0 kg) was extracted with EtOH. Both EtOH and MeOH extracts were subjected to solvent partition with EtOAc and with n-BuOH. EtOAc extract after evaporation was dissolved in MeOH-H 2 O (9:1) and partitioned with hexane. The 90% of the solvent was evaporated, and the residue thus obtained was dissolved in CH 2 Cl 2 -0.5 N HCl. Compound (129) was isolated as an optically active glassy solid after repeated chromatographic separations. Molecular formula of the compound was determined as C 32 NMR, and 13 C NMR data it was concluded that this compound must have five rings. Additionally, NMR analysis indicated the presence of three sp3 methines (\u03b4 62.1, 40.4, and 37.6), one sp3 (\u03b4 44.6) and one sp2 (\u03b4 144.5) quaternary carbons, and five typical nitrogen-substituted methylene resonances (\u03b4 50.6, 51.2, 56.3, 58.0, 59.4), which suggested an ingenamine-type skeleton for (129) . Comparison of the 13 C NMR data of (129) with related alkaloids indicated the presence of a tricyclic central core. Extensive analysis of NMR spectra including HSQC, HMBC, 1 H-1 H COSY, HSQCTOCSY, and NOESY confirmed the structure of these mairne alkaloids. Similarly, structure of other alkaloids (130) (131) (132) (133) (134) have been confirmed.",

Over 75 pyridoacridine alkaloids have been isolated from marine sponges, tunicates and molluscs and characterized. There is little doubt that their number will increase in future. Marine alkaloids, particularly brominated or chlorinated ones, do have distinct features as compared to alkaloids from terrestrial sources. There are ample circumstantial evidences which suggest that some of the marine alkaloids are metabolites of an associated flora. Since the origin of a number of alkaloids is uncertain, the attempts of construction of chemotaxonomical system based on secondary metabolites analysis must be viewed with caution. Although quite a number of marine alkaloids display high order of antineoplastic and antiviral activity, a drug from this source is still very far. However, studies conducted on marine alkaloids have enriched basic organic chemistry and the biological activities have widened the vision of chemists and biologists. The biological effects of bioactive marine alkaloids have expanded greatly our knowledge of several basic phenomena in biology. The new structures have provided fertile area for design and synthesis. The biosynthesis of bioactive marine alkaloids is fascinating and remains unexplored.",

Autoxidation of isobatzellin A(66) to D(69) is facile and could be observed within a few hours during thin layer chromatography or treatment with DDQ.Isobatzelline A (66) can be converted into bratzelline A (63) by diazotization substitution in aqueous nitrous acid. The Fijian tunicate Clavelina sp.68,69 has yielded wakayin (70) a unique alkaloid. Ireland et al68,69 isolated a new pyrroloiminoquinone based alkaloid, wakayin (70) from the ascidian Clavelina sponge. Wakayin (70) exhibited potent in vitro cytotoxicity against the human colon tumor cell line (HCT116 IC 50 0.5 \u00b5g/mL). Wakayin was found to inhibit topoisomerase II enzyme (250 \u00b5M) and based on related biological data it was concluded that wakayin exhibit its biological activity by damaging the DNA. This compound also exhibited antimicrobial activity against Bacillus subtilis (MIC = 0.3 \u00b5g/mL). The crude methanol-chloroform extract was partitioned by reversed phase flash chromatography using methanol-aqueous trifluoroacetic acid solvent systems. Purification of combined biologically active fractions by repeated elution through Sephadex LH-20 yielded 15 mg (0.005% wet weight) of wakayin(70)as a triflouroacetate salt. Molecular formula of this compound was established as C 20 H 15 N 4 O by the use of FAB-HRMS (MH + 327.1262, calculated 327.1246). Several features of the 1 H and 13 C NMR spectra of (70) were matches with discorhabdins and isobatzellines, The sponge Bratzella sp. has also furnished four additional pyrroloacridine alkaloids named isobatzellines A-suggesting the presence of a pyrroloiminoquinone moiety. The spin system comprising \u03b4 13.04 (br s, NH1), 7.11 (d, J = 2.5 Hz, H2), 2.93 (t, J = 8.0 Hz, H24), 3.78 (br t, J = 8.0 Hz, H25), and 10.32 (br s, NH6) was established by DQCOSYD and 1-D lH difference NOE 70 NMR experiments. This spin system was assigned to part of a pyrrolodihydropyridine moiety by HMQC 71 and HMBC 72 NMR experiments. IR absorption at 1662 and 1447 cm -1 indicated the presence of an iminoquinone ring which was reconfirmed by 13 C NMR signals at \u03b4 166.28 (CO) and 156.72 (C7). The connectivities between the pyrrolodihydropyridine system and C7, C8, and C9 of the iminoquinone ring was established by long range 1 H-13 C NMR correlations observed for H2 (\u03b4 120.74). The l H NMR signals at \u03b4 13.41 (br s), 7.28 (d, J = 2.5 Hz) and 13 C NMR signals at \u03b4 134.25 (s), 120.44 (s), 114.15 (s), 125.14 (d, l J CH = 190 Hz) confirmed the presence of another 2,3,4 trisubstituted pyrrole ring. Long range l H-13 C NMR correlations experiment also confirmed this and proved that the pyrrole ring was bound to C11 and C15 of the iminoquinone ring. 1 H and 13 C NMR data were also suggested the presence of a 3-substituted indole moiety [\u03b4 11.54 (br d, J = 2.0 Hz), 7.73 (d, J = 2.0 Hz), 7.52 (d, J = 8.0 Hz), 7.49 (d, J = 8.0 Hz), 7.19 (dd, J = 8.0, 8.0 Hz), 7.09 (dd, J = 8.0, 8.0 Hz); 13 C [\u03b4 105.90 (s), 112.07 (d, J = 161 Hz), 118.86 (d, J = 161 Hz), 119.66 (d, J = 161 Hz), 121.85 (d, J = 161 Hz), 124.94 (d, J = 183 Hz), 125.49 (s), 136.76 (s)]. This was further confirmed by HMQC and HMBC NMR experiments and by comparison with the 13 C NMR data reported for the indole-imidazole moiety of topsentin. 73 Long-range l H-13 C correlations by HMBC and selective INEPT NMR experiments between H13 and C16 established connectivity between the bipyrroloiminoquinone moiety and the 3-substituted indole, and confirmed the structure wakayin.",
