            "text": "Porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV) is a newly emerging enteropathogenic swine coronavirus that can cause acute diarrhoea and vomiting in pigs, leading to dehydration and death in newborn piglets (Chen et al., 2015b; Jung et al., 2015; Ma et al., 2015). The clinical infection symptoms caused by PDCoV are similar to but milder than those of porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus (PEDV) (Hu et al., 2015). PDCoV is an enveloped, single-stranded, positive-sense RNA virus that belongs to the genus Deltacoronavirus within the family Coronaviridae of the order Nidovirales. PDCoV was first discovered in Hong Kong, China, in 2012 in a territory-wide molecular epidemiology study in mammals and birds (Woo et al., 2012). PDCoV was subsequently reported in the United States in 2014 (Castro et al., 2012; Wang et al., 2014) and then in South Korea, mainland China, Japan, Thailand, Viet Nam and Lao People's Democratic Republic (Lao PDR) (Lee and Lee, 2014; Lorsirigool et al., 2016; Saeng-Chuto et al., 2017a; Song et al., 2015). The coinfection of PDCoV with other enteric viral pathogens such as PEDV, rotavirus or kobuvirus are commonly reported (Mai et al., 2018; Marthaler et al., 2014a; Marthaler et al., 2014b).",

            "text": "The genome of PDCoV is composed of approximately 25.4 kb nucleotides and has a genomic organization similar to other coronaviruses: a 5\u2032 untranslated region (UTR), open reading frame 1a (ORF1a) and ORF1b encoding two overlapping polyprotein precursors; four structural protein genes encoding spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N); three accessory protein genes encoding NS6, NS7, and NS7a; and a 3\u2019 UTR and poly (A) tail (Chen et al., 2015a; Fang et al., 2017; Fang et al., 2016; Li et al., 2014; Woo et al., 2012). For coronaviruses, the function of the S protein is to recognize receptors and mediate viral entry into host cells. The S protein is composed of an N-terminal S1 subunit for receptor binding and a C-terminal S2 subunit for the fusion of host and viral membranes. The cryo-electron microscopy structure of PDCoV S protein ectodomain (S-e) without the transmembrane anchor or intracellular tail in the prefusion state (Shang et al., 2018) showed that the S1 subunit contained an N-terminal domain (S1-NTD), a C-terminal domain (S1-CTD) and connecting subdomains (SDs). The S2 subunit contained two central helices (CH-N and CH-C), a hydrophobic fusion peptide (FP), two heptad repeat (HR-N and HR-C) regions and connecting loops. Between S1 and S2 are connecting SDs and a long loop. Because the S protein of the coronavirus is the major surface protein and the main target of the host humoural immune response, it is considered to be evolutionarily related and a focus of vaccine design (Graham et al., 2013).",

In the present study, to further investigate the epidemiology and phylogenetics of PDCoV in China, a total of 719 porcine samples from 18 provinces in China from 2016 to 2018 were simultaneously tested for PDCoV and PEDV. The S gene sequences of 11 PDCoV strains from PDCoV-positive samples were sequenced and analysed. Phylogenetic, sequence and recombination analyses were also performed. The results from this study will help to understand the prevalence of PDCoV strains in China and further provide more insights into the evolution and diversity of PDCoVs.",

All of the samples were placed into separate clean containers with phosphate buffered saline, frozen, thawed three times, and then centrifuged for 10 min at 845 \u00d7g. The supernatants from the 719 samples were mixed with TRIzol for viral RNA extraction. Total RNA was dissolved in RNase-free water and carefully preserved at \u221270 \u00b0C before further use. Synthesis of cDNA for each sample was carried out using a RevertAid First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Thermo Scientific, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The cDNAs were screened for the presence of PDCoV and PEDV. The detection of PDCoV by using real-time reverse transcription PCR (rRT-PCR) targeting the membrane (M) gene was performed as reported previously (Marthaler et al., 2014b), using AceQ qPCR Probe Master Mix (Vazyme, China) and performed on Light Cycler96, the specific procedure was as followed: 5 min at 95 \u00b0C, followed by 40 cycles of 15 s at 95 \u00b0C and 30 s at 60 \u00b0C.

Three sequenced strains (CH-HA1, CH-HA2 and CH-HA3), which formed a new monophyletic branch, were most closely related to the Viet Nam/Laos/Thailand lineage strains. This is the first report of China PDCoV strains having such a close relationship with the Viet Nam/Laos/Thailand lineage and separated from the China lineage, strains collected from China normally clustered to the China lineage(Dong et al., 2016; Liu et al., 2018). Do these strains clustered in this new monophyletic branch originate from recombination or evolution? The recombination analysis showed that the strain CH-HA2-2017 in this special branch indeed had a possible recombinant event. The minor parent HKU15-155 was from the China lineage, and the major parent CH-HA3-2017 was from this same new branch but not the Viet Nam/Laos/Thailand lineage. Is there any possibility that the major parent is recombinant also? It needs to be further studied until enough PDCoV sequences are available. However, the global genetic divergence analysis of PDCoV showed that the relationship between the China and Viet Nam/Laos/Thailand lineages (0.037 \u00b1 0.003) was farther than that of the China and USA/Japan/South Korea lineages (0.017 \u00b1 0.001), this result makes the close relationship between China's new branch and the Viet Nam/Laos/Thailand lineage incomprehensible, as these three lineages originated from the same or different ancestors and need to be intensely analysed with more sequences. Furthermore, the greater genetic divergence (0.036 and 0.037) of the Viet Nam/Laos/Thailand lineage among three lineages suggesting that the Viet Nam/Laos/Thailand strains may diverged from other early lineages.",

The S protein of the coronavirus is the main determinant of viral host range and tissue tropism; thus, substitutions in the S protein are critical for analysing the evolution, infectivity and pathogenicity of PDCoV. In the present study, significant amino acid substitutions of the S protein between global PDCoV strains were analysed. Although the significance of these substitutions is almost obscured currently, the three-dimensional cartoon diagram displaying gave a visual spatial location and made it possible to deduce their potential functions. The substitutions mapped on the surface loops of S1-NTD and SDs may be associated with the connection of different S1 and S2 subunits to form the crown-like structure, the residue 307 located on a \u03b2-sheet of S1-CTD was exposed on the surface of the S trimer and may be responsible for the antigenicity of the S protein. Thus, all of the substitutions of S1 were located on the surface of the \u201ccrown\u201d and may be associated with receptor binding capacity and antigenicity. Similarly, substitutions of S2 may be responsible for the viral characteristics of membrane fusion. A previous study revealed that the non-synonymous substitutions L107Q, A698S, A551V, L670I, and I111V, which were also analysed in this study, were shared by the branches leading to Korean PDCoV isolates in 2014 and 2015 in the reconstruction of ancestral amino acid changes (Lee et al., 2016), further implying the significance of substitutions related to the ongoing potential adaptation to the natural host.",

A new monophyletic branch of China strains closely related to the Viet Nam/Laos/Thailand lineage was detected in this study, although the ancestor or source has not been elucidated due to the limitation of available PDCoV sequences. The sites and locations of significant amino acid substitutions in the PDCoV S protein were analysed, but the exact biological functions need more experiments to be elucidated. Our study provides useful insights into the molecular characteristics of prevalent China PDCoV strains and provides references for further biological research on potential functional sites of the S protein and pathogenicity studies. Moreover, further analysis of molecular epidemiology based on the complete genome sequence is urgently needed.",
