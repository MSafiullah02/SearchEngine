This change is reflected in China's effective control of H1N1, H5N1, and H7N9 influenza outbreaks; response to imported cases of Zika virus infection, Rift Valley fever, and Yellow fever; and China's active involvement in the fight against Ebola virus disease in west Africa in 2014. After the SARS outbreak, intensified actions have been taken in China to reduce the burden of infectious diseases, such as substantial investment in public health, capacity building for laboratory testing, surveillance system enhancement, national intervention programmes for specific diseases, and maintenance of a close collaboration with international partners.1 Since the implementation of these efforts, how has the situation developed regarding infectious disease epidemics in China? What can the world learn from China's approach to infectious disease control? What role can China play in global public health?",

Since 2004, three emerging diseases have been added as mandatory report diseases: hand, foot, and mouth disease in 2008; influenza A H1N1 pdm09 in 2009; and human infection with the avian influenza A H7N9 virus in 2013. Excluding these three new diseases, the overall incidence of the remaining consistently reported diseases, estimated by a joinpoint regression model,3 showed a two-stage feature of opposite changes. In the first stage, the overall rate of reported infectious diseases rose rapidly in 2004\u201306, with an annual percentage change of 8\u00b79%, which is probably attributable to the improved sensitivity of the surveillance system by the adoption of a new web-based reporting approach since the SARS outbreak.1 In the second stage, the overall trend showed a slight reduction with an annual percentage change of \u22120\u00b77% in 2007\u201313. Whether or not the three newly added diseases are considered, the pattern of the overall trend of infectious disease occurrence showed significant differences between the two stages (figure\n).

The elimination of filariasis throughout China was certified in 2007 by WHO. Furthermore, the goal of nationwide malaria elimination by 2020 was established, and schistosomiasis is close to being eliminated.",
