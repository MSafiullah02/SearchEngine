As you likely have heard more times than you care to count by now, the viral agent causing this disease is related to the virus that causes severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), and for that reason the virus is officially called SARS-CoV-2. The CoV indicates that the virus is a member of the Coronaviridae family, whose name is derived from the spike- or crown-like appearance of the surface proteins that are visible under an electron microscope.",

Given that this vaccine represents a determined worldwide endeavor with billions of dollars being poured into the effort, like me, you may have been curious about the reason for this extended time frame for the vaccine development process. In tracking down the answer to this question, I was struck by the similarities between the history and process of vaccine development and that of the development of neurologic physical therapy interventions.",

In these earliest, whole-pathogen vaccines, injection of small amounts of attenuated or inactivated virus activates the immune system, triggering the development of antibodies that protect us against infection. Second-generation, subunit vaccines, rather than being based on whole viruses, involve only the antigens that activate the immune system. Finally, third-generation, nucleic acid vaccines involve injection of plasmid with the encoding gene of the desired antigen to induce the immune system to express antibodies.1,2 Each of the 3 forms of vaccines is of value, and their utility depends on the viral target.",

One might consider conventional interventions that target compensation to be our first-generation approaches. The more contemporary, task-specific training interventions intended to promote restoration through use-dependent plasticity would be our second-generation approaches. Lastly, emergent interventions that combine neuromodulation with training interventions designed to promote use-dependent plasticity could be thought of as our third-generation approaches.",

Vaccines undergo the stepwise process used with almost all other pharmacologic and biologic interventions. In the vast majority of cases, prior to being made available on a broad scale, they progress from basic mechanistic studies through small phase 1 safety studies to moderately sized phase 2 dose-response studies to large phase 3 randomized clinical trials.",

Our conventional, first-generation physical therapy treatments primarily arose from a trial-and-error approach in the clinical setting and were passed along as part of our academic and clinical training. Second-generation physical therapy treatments had a foundation in basic science studies of neuroplasticity and use-dependent neural reorganization.3,4 Emerging, third-generation treatments build on second-generation treatments, adding various forms of neural stimulation to augment the electrical changes that underlie neural activation and thereby enhance neuroplastic effects of training. The progression of neurologic physical therapy approaches has lacked a stepwise approach. Progress has mostly been based on small studies that often lack conclusive evidence; issues of dose-response relationships have been largely unexplored.",

Beginning with basic mechanistic studies (Stage 0) and progressing next to intervention refinement (Stage I; which may include dose-response assessment). The model emphasizes that the development of an intervention has been accomplished only when it can be implemented in a way that maximally meets the needs of the group for which it is intended (Stage V).",

With this common language, stakeholders, clinicians, investigators, reviewers, and funding agencies can have meaningful conversations about the appropriate next steps that are needed before an intervention is ready to be applied in the clinical setting. Abiding by this model also ensures the research evidence exists to justify reimbursement when that time comes. Our patients and profession will surely benefit if we join with our behavioral research colleagues and embrace the NIH Stage Model as we pursue the development of neurologic physical therapy interventions.",
