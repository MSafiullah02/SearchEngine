During the outbreak of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) in Korea, pharmacies in South Korea sold many times more N95 FFRs than usual. However, these FFRs are sometimes reused, especially during a shortage or when their distribution is delayed.5 Economic considerations may also apply.6 The price of certified FFRs, such as National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH)\u2010approved N95 FFRs, typically exceeds those of non\u2010certified masks.

The respirator is stored between encounters to be put on again (\u201cdonned\u201d) before the next encounter with a patient. To prevent tuberculosis, the CDC recommends that a disposable respirator can be reused by the same worker as long as it maintains its physical integrity and its proper use provides protection (exposure reduction) consistent with the assigned protection factor for respirator of its class.1 Furthermore, NIOSH requires that, between uses, used respirators should be hung in a designated storage area or kept in a clean, breathable container such as a paper bag. To minimize potential cross\u2010contamination, respirators are stored without touching each other and the use of the respirator is clearly identified. Storage containers should be disposed of or cleaned regularly.1 The FDA defines three kinds of reuse: between patients with adequate reprocessing, reuse by the same person with adequate reprocessing/decontamination, and repeated use by the same person over a period with or without reprocessing.7, 8\n",

Physical damage varied with treatment method. Further research is needed before any particular decontamination methods can be recommended. Other chemical and energetic methods also have potential for decontaminating FFRs,11, 12, 16 but few studies have addressed the elimination of viable microorganisms from FFRs. UVGI had been reported effectively to eliminate H5N117 or MS2 coliphages18 from FFRs and was found not to affect drastically the filtration efficiency of FFRs. Related studies have not evaluated the efficiency with which decontamination methods destroy bacteria. Therefore, objective experimentally obtained information concerning the destruction of bacteria using various decontamination methods is required to support the reuse of FFRs.",
