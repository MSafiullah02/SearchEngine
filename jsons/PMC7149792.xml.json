The fleas have a predilection for the ears, where they can be found in clusters along the edges of the pinnae. The fleas are mobile and move between the environment and the host. Wild rabbit fleas are not usually found on pet rabbits. Spilopsyllus cuniculi is a small flea whose life cycle is influenced by the reproductive status of the host. Egg maturation is dependent on female reproductive hormones. Successful reproduction of the rabbit flea requires contact with a rabbit in late pregnancy or with a newborn nestling. Increased blood corticosteroid concentrations in late pregnancy attract fleas, which attach firmly to the doe to feed. Within a few hours of parturition, fleas move from the doe to the newborn babies to feed, copulate and lay eggs in the nest. The eggs hatch and the larvae feed on flea dirt deposited in the nest by the adult fleas feeding on the pregnant doe. In this way, fleas are spread from one generation to the next and are an important vector of disease, especially myxomatosis.",

            "text": "In addition to rabbits, E. cuniculi can cause severe disease in blue (Arctic) foxes, Alopex lagopus, and financial losses to the fur industry. This disease has therefore been extensively studied in this species. Adult blue foxes are asymptomatic carriers but can pass on infection transplacentally and the resultant puppies can have various clinical signs, depending on what body system is primarily involved. These range from acute renal failure to cardiac signs to widespread non-suppurative meningoencephalitis. Akerstedt (2003) demonstrated the humoral response of adult blue foxes in Norway persists for at least one year. Disease in blue foxes has prompted serological surveys of farmed Arctic foxes in Finland (Akerstedt et al., 2002), wild Arctic foxes in Greenland (Akerstedt and Kapel, 2003) and other species of fox, Dusicyon culpaeus and Dusicyon griseus, in Argentina (Martino et al., 2004). These studies have shown that wild foxes in both Greenland and Argentina demonstrated no evidence of encephalitozoonosis within their populations. However, in farmed foxes the disease is endemic. This mirrors the situation in rabbits in the United Kingdom (Cox and Ross, 1980; Blevins, unpublished data; R. Saunders, personal communication), where exposure is common in rabbit colonies and within the pet population but not in the wild rabbits, but contrasts with the situation in both the United States (Jungherr, 1955) and Australia (Thomas et al., 1997), where exposure has been documented in wild rabbits. In the case of Australian rabbits the seroprevalence in the wild is suggested to have changed in recent years. A study in 1980 found no evidence of exposure to E. cuniculi in wild rabbits in Victoria (Cox et al., 1980), whereas a study in 1997 showed a seroprevalence of 25% in wild rabbits in Western Australia (Thomas et al., 1997). The mechanism for the shift in prevalence in the wild populations in both America and Australia is unknown. In the case of Australia it is possible that E. cuniculi was always present in wild rabbits in Western Australia, and is still not present in those in Victoria.",

Refractory diarrhoea, bronchitis, pneumonia and sinusitis are other possible manifestations. Hollister et al. (1991) found that there was serological evidence of widespread human exposure to E. cuniculi. It is interesting to note that in the USA the prevalent strain of E. cuniculi found in humans was strain III, which is usually associated with dogs, whereas in Europe strain I (the rabbit strain) was more commonly found (Didier et al., 1995). With the discovery of HIV in the 1980s and the ever-increasing number of people undergoing chemotherapy and organ transplantation the relevance of E. cuniculi within the pet population as a potential zoonosis cannot be overstated.",

Affected animals showed muscular weakness, emaciation, polydipsia, polyuria and occasional neurological signs. Other texts describe encephalitozoonosis as a chronic, latent disease of rabbits that is significant because of its effects on experimental results. Infection with E. cuniculi in laboratory rabbits has caused many problems to scientific studies. Subclinical infection has vitiated experimental results and lesions caused by the parasite have been wrongly attributed to a number of other ailments (Wilson, 1979). Encephalitozoonosis can interfere with test results. Blood samples of rabbits with spontaneous encephalitozoonosis have been shown to have significantly lower levels of catecholamines than healthy rabbits (Levkut et al., 1997). Nowadays, laboratory rabbits are screened for E. cuniculi and seropositive animals eliminated. In the laboratory setting a \u2018test and remove\u2019 policy in conjunction with strict hygiene is frequently employed because infection with E. cuniculi can result in erroneous results during research trials (Ansbacher et al., 1988). This is due to the fact that E. cuniculi modifies the way the central nervous system reacts to challenge.",

A survey of 97 clinically healthy UK rabbits in 2006 showed that 52% were seropositive (Keeble and Shaw, 2006). Samples were taken as part of a routine health screen or preanaesthetic screening at veterinary practices in England, Wales and Scotland.

Recent work has shown the seroprevalence of E. cuniculi in UK pet rabbits to be 52% (Keeble and Shaw, 2006). The infection is common; however, the rate of disease is unknown. Historically E. cuniculi has been found frequently in mammals, but its relevance has been misinterpreted. The use of infected rabbits as models for human disease has led to the clinical and histological signs of E. cuniculi being mistaken for syphilis and poliomyelitis (Bull, 1917). It has also been implicated at various times as the causative agent of rabies, scrub typhus, psittacosis and chemical carcinogenesis (Wasson and Peper, 2000).",

These are equally suitable for use on pet rabbits as well as in the laboratory setting. The majority of research into this disease has been carried out on laboratory rabbits. With an increase in the popularity of rabbits as pets and the number presented to veterinary surgeons for treatment, it is important to consider this disease from the pet rabbit perspective. In the domestic setting it is often not enough to be able to say a rabbit is infected; it is necessary to decide whether this is relevant to the health status of the individual concerned. A positive titre only reflects exposure but gives no indication of whether the disease is active. This is important in the treatment of the individual animal, but also has relevance to the human owners, since E. cuniculi is a potential zoonosis (Deplazes et al., 1996, Weber et al., 1997, Weitzel et al., 2001).",

In laboratory rabbits, serum antibodies develop after 3 weeks and excretion of the parasite occurs 6 weeks after experimental infection with E. cuniculi (Cox et al., 1979). Passive immunity is transferred from infected dams to their offspring, which can have titres of 1:25 to 1:800 that last until they are about 4 weeks old. After a seronegative period, young rabbits seroconvert at 8\u201310 weeks of age in response to natural infection (Lyngset, 1980).

This increases the likelihood that concurrent clinical disease may occur (Harcourt-Brown and Holloway, 2003). Similarly, infection with E. cuniculi can affect the way the central nervous system reacts to outside challenge. Ansbacher et al. (1988) showed that seropositive rabbits displayed an inconsistent inflammatory response both between individual rabbits and between sites within the same rabbit when coated platinum wires were implanted into four sites within the cerebral cortex.

Two indirect immunofluorescence assays (IIF), two enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) and carbon immunoassay were compared.

This is proposed to be due to the less quantitative nature of the ELISA assay and not due to any reduction in sensitivity relative to the other methodologies.

As encephalitozoonosis is a disease related to granuloma formation, clinical pathological evidence of this may be used to distinguish it from the possible alternate diagnoses. Of the above list only toxoplasmosis is likely to produce granulomatous lesions at the time of clinical signs becoming relevant. This disease is rarely diagnosed in UK rabbits and its significance can be eliminated by looking at paired titres for this organism. Similarly, the differential diagnoses for chronic renal failure are intrinsic renal failure, benign tumours, such as embryonal nephroma, renal cysts and malignant tumours, such as lymphoma and renal carcinoma. The defining feature of encephalitozoonosis is granulomatous change in the target organs, unlike the alternate causes of similar clinical symptoms. There are two challenges in determining the cause of many of these clinical signs. First is the reliance necessarily placed on invasive or post-mortem testing to achieve definitive diagnoses. Secondly, increases in absolute titres to E. cuniculi cannot be used diagnostically due to the difficulties in interpretation. Many workers doubt E. cuniculi as a cause of disease by itself (it does not in fact fulfil Koch\u2019s postulates), feeling that in many cases, signs attributed to the parasite are in fact caused by one of the differential diagnoses. Successful treatment of the alternative disease can bring about a clinical cure.

            "text": "Potential treatments include:1.Benzimidazoles: this class of drugs (including fenbendazole and albendazole) are microtubule inhibitors. In this instance they stop the host cells becoming infected by preventing the extrusion of the polar filament. Thus, they limit spore formation. Albendazole has been the treatment of choice in human microsporidial infections; however, its use in rabbits is extrapolated from this and therefore anecdotal. Adverse reactions such as bone marrow disease, pyrexia and liver failure have been attributed to albendazole in rabbits. Albendazole is available as an oral preparation for cattle and sheep. It has been used to eliminate the Encephalitozoon spp. from human AIDS patients, sometimes with dramatic success (De Groote et al., 1995). Elimination of the parasite is accompanied by relief of clinical symptoms in humans. Eradication of the parasite has been confirmed at autopsy (Joste et al., 1996, Sobottka et al., 1995). Albendazole has also been used to treat clinical cases of E. cuniculi in pet rabbits, with no reports of adverse effects and apparent improvement in clinical symptoms. The pharmacokinetic effects of the agent have been tested on rabbits (Li et al., 1995). An empirical course of 3\u201310 days\u2019 treatment appears to be beneficial. In-contact rabbits should be treated as a precaution, although albendazole is potentially teratogenic and is not advisable in breeding females. While it is difficult to support the use of this drug in the face of other proven less toxic compounds, its penetration into ocular tissues and its success in treating ocular manifestations of encephalitozoonosis should not be ignored. Fenbendazole has been tested clinically in experimentally infected rabbits (Suter et al., 2001) and been found to be effective in clearing the parasite from the brain, thereby reducing clinical signs in advanced cases. It is also effective in preventing the establishment of infection in exposed rabbits. Fenbendazole appears to be safer than albendazole in rabbits; however, it has been linked with bone marrow suppression, so rabbits undergoing treatment should be monitored appropriately.2.Glucocorticoids: the use of glucocorticoids has been advocated in the acute phase of encephalitozoonosis, in order to suppress the inflammatory response. However, rabbits are very sensitive to the immunosuppressive effects of steroids and their use in this species is always controversial. Treated individuals should be monitored closely.3.Fluoroquinolones: for example, enrofloxacin, an antibiotic known to be safe for and licensed for use in rabbits, has been shown to have some antimicrosporidial action in vitro. The use of fluoroquinolones in the vestibular form of encephalitozoonosis is sensible, particularly as they are also effective in treating some of the main differential diagnoses such as pasteurellosis.4.Other antibiotics: oxytetracyclines and potentiated sulphonamides have also been recommended for use in treating encephalitozoonosis. While potentiated sulphonamides have been shown to be ineffective in vitro against E. cuniculi, oxytetracyclines do appear to inhibit microsporidial growth in vitro.5.Antifungal drugs: as E. cuniculi has been shown to share characteristics with fungi, antifungal medications such as fumagillin have been evaluated as potential treatments. This drug is not well tolerated by rabbits and is not advocated as a treatment at this time.6.Interferon-gamma: having been shown to be a potentially effective treatment in immunosuppressed humans, in the future interferon-gamma may become a clinically available treatment for rabbits.7.Chitin synthesis inhibitors: e.g., lufenuron, polyoxin D and nikkomycin Z may also be effective. To date, little information has been gathered about the clinical use of these compounds, either in humans or in rabbits. Some workers in the UK are advocating the use of lufenuron (Program Suspension Cat, Novartis Animal Health), as it has shown to be safe in rabbits. Its efficacy is unproven.Some cases appear to improve spontaneously without treatment, presumably due to the host\u2019s immune response. In the absence of a simple diagnostic test for the presence of the antigen in the live animal, it is difficult to monitor the efficacy of therapeutic agents in eliminating the parasite.",

All of these factors make control and prevention of this disease more difficult. Ideally, rabbits should be tested for encephalitozoon exposure before planning housing and management strategies. Even with this strategy, rabbits that have been recently infected will be missed and therefore wrongly categorized. Two tests, 4 weeks apart, would eliminate most of this risk. Negative animals should be housed separately from and without contact with positive animals. If this is impractical, other measures may reduce the likelihood of infection. Regular short prophylactic courses of fenbendazole (with appropriate monitoring) have been shown to prevent infection in exposed rabbits. Strategies to reduce contact with potentially contaminated urine such as regular cleaning and disinfection of the rabbit's environment (including water/food bowls and litter trays), elevation of food and water bowls off the floor to reduce the risk of urine contamination, the use of hay nets rather than blanketing the floor in hay and control of rodent vermin may all be helpful.",

Sporozoites invade neighbouring cells and are dispersed throughout the body via the blood and lymphatics. Once the host immune responses are established, the organisms can be found as cysts in various tissues where they can remain for years (Owen, 1992). The source of infection for rabbits is feed contaminated by cat faeces and symptoms have been described in rabbits that grazed an area frequented by cats. Clinical signs are most common in the acute phase in young rabbits. Sudden anorexia, pyrexia and death are the usual signs, although CNS symptoms such as posterior paralysis or seizures can also occur (Leland et al., 1992). Outbreaks have been described in commercial rabbits (Harcourt, 1967, Okerman, 1988). High antibody titres have been found in wild rabbits collected from sewerage farms in Australia (Cox et al., 1981). Ashmawy et al. (2011) examined the seroprevalence of exposure to toxoplasmosis in several rabbit farms in Egypt. Eleven per cent of rabbits had been exposed, which presented a public health risk for eating rabbit meat. Positive serology only indicates exposure to infection. Gustaffson et al. (1997) compared the difference in susceptibility to toxoplasmosis between two lagomorphs, the mountain hare (Lepus timidus) and the domestic rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus). Domestic rabbits were found to be resistant to toxoplasmosis in comparison with the mountain hare. In the mountain hare, toxoplasmosis is acutely fatal and characterized by necrosis and tissue damage in the small intestine, mesenteric lymph nodes and liver. In the domestic rabbit, lesions are mild, consisting of focal accumulations of mononuclear cells, mainly in the liver and heart. Histopathology is diagnostic. Antibodies are detected early as 7\u20138 days post-infection (Gustaffson et al., 1997).",

Poor husbandry, overcrowding, poor ventilation, dust conditions and ammonia build-up exacerbate the disease. Investigations of rhinitis in laboratory rabbits have shown that some rabbits can have rhinitis for up to 2 weeks before P. multocida is isolated from nasal swabs. Clinical signs wax and wane but symptoms often persist despite treatment.",

Surviving rabbits are bred from, and after 3 years the colony is considered to be disease free. Other methods of producing disease-free rabbits involve Caesarean derivation with hand-rearing (Manning et al., 1989) or the transfer of fertilized ova to Pasteurella-free does. Early weaning and the use of antibiotics can increase the number of disease-free individuals. To ensure an uninfected status, periodic serological testing for antibodies to Pasteurella is necessary.

The bacterium cannot be grown in vitro but can be grown in tissue culture. The bacterial genome is closely related to Clostridium species and, in recent years, the organism has been reclassified as Clostridium piliforme rather than Bacillus piliformis (Besch-Williford, 1997). Tyzzer\u2019s disease can affect a wide range of animals, including rodents, cats and monkeys (Delong and Manning, 1994). The disease affects the caecum, intestine and liver, causing acute diarrhoea and sudden death in the acute stage and intestinal fibrosis, stenosis and liver necrosis in chronic cases. The myocardium can also be affected. The disease usually occurs in weanling rabbits 6\u201312 weeks old but can occur at any age and is often predisposed by stress. It is a major differential in outbreaks of diarrhoea in rabbit colonies. Recent advances in tissue culture have led to development of diagnostic tests and serological testing is now possible in some countries. A PCR for detecting ribosomal DNA sequences has also been developed; however, the agreement between serology and PCR is not close. The presence of antibody in apparently healthy animals suggests latent infection of the intestinal tract; however, false-positive results can occur due to cross-reaction with non-pathogenic bacteria (Pritt et al., 2010). Stress or immunosuppression can precipitate overt disease (Delong and Manning, 1994). Transmission occurs by ingestion of spores that can survive in the environment for some time after an infected animal has been removed. Overcrowding, stress, low dietary fibre and transport predispose to clinical disease. Supportive treatment and antibiotic therapy are generally unrewarding.",

Rabbits were frequently kept as pets and there was outcry at the sight of blind, sick rabbits stumbling along roads or on commons and other public places.

In the UK, disease outbreaks tend to remain localized with isolated pockets of infection and the disease is only sporadically encountered in pet rabbits. The difference in epidemiology is attributed to the difference in the life cycle of insect vectors. In the UK, the European rabbit flea, S. cuniculi, is the major insect vector rather than mosquito species Aedes and Anopheles spp. Even in the absence of the host, fleas can maintain infectivity throughout the winter and act as a reservoir of infection for the following year.

The disease starts with a skin lesion, which typically develops 4\u20135 days after inoculation of the virus and enlarges to become about 3 cm in diameter 9\u201310 days after infection.

Infected rabbits mount an immune response that can be detected by in vitro tests about 7 days after infection and reach peak levels by about 28 days (Fenner and Ross, 1994). Antibodies persist for prolonged periods and give absolute immunity for many months. Maternal transfer of antibodies takes place and immunity lasts for 4\u20135 weeks in baby rabbits. Some rabbits have a genetic resistance to infection, which has limited mortality rates in outbreaks in wild rabbits. Genetic resistance to infection varies between rabbit populations and countries. British rabbits were slow to develop resistance in comparison with Australian rabbits (Fenner and Ross, 1994). A phenomenon known as \u2018paternal resistance\u2019 is also described. It has been discovered that bucks mating within 7 months of infection sometimes confer partial resistance to progeny born to the mated doe within the following 7 months. Speculation about some immunogenic factor in semen has been made (Fenner and Ross, 1994).",

Live attenuated strains of myxoma virus have been used for vaccination, but problems have occurred with virulence and possible immunosuppression (Fenner and Fantani, 1999). The discovery of Shope fibroma virus and its cross-immunity with myxomatosis led to the development of a live vaccine containing Shope fibroma virus. Until recently the only vaccine available in the UK (Nobivac Myxo, Intervet) was a live, attenuated freeze-dried virus vaccine containing Shope fibroma virus grown in cell-line tissue culture. In 2012 a new vaccine (Nobivac Myxo-RHD) based on an attenuated myxomatosis strain with a rabbit haemorrhagic disease (RHD) capsid protein added was introduced (Spibey et al., 2012). This new vaccine gives one year\u2019s duration of immunity.Key points 14.5Myxomatosis\n\u2022Myxomatosis is characterized by subcutaneous swellings that exude a mucoid secretion when sectioned. Lesions occur around body orifices and on the face, especially the eyelids.\u2022The disease is mainly spread by arthropods, especially the European rabbit flea, Spilopsyllus cuniculi. Mosquitoes are vectors in many parts of the world.\u2022In wild rabbits, outbreaks of myxomatosis wax and wane according to the virulence of the strain and the immune status of the native rabbit population.\u2022Myxomatosisis can occur in hares but is rare and usually mild.\u2022Environmental temperature has an effect on mortality rates, with the disease being more lethal at low temperatures.\u2022Myxomatosis starts with a skin lesion at the site of inoculation. The rabbit becomes viraemic, with virus replication taking place throughout the lymphoid system. Secondary lesions develop throughout the body, typically on the nares, lips, eyelids and base of the ears and on the external genitalia and anus.\u2022Aerosol infection can result in pneumonic signs, which may be a feature of outbreaks in intensive farmed rabbits.\u2022Myxomatosis is accompanied by sterility and abandonment of litters.\u2022It is possible, on rare occasions, for rabbits to recover from myxomatosis. Ambient temperature affects the course of the disease, with high environmental temperature increasing recovery rate (85\u00b0F).\u2022Antibiotics, a warm environment, good nursing and non-steroidal analgesics can be used to treat myxomatosis. Corticosteroids are contraindicated due to their immunosuppressive effects. Opioid analgesics are ineffective in ameliorating signs of pain.\n\n",

Treated rabbits refused food and water a day earlier than untreated rabbits and had lower rectal temperatures immediately prior to death (Robinson et al., 1999).

Insects mechanically transmit the virus in viraemic blood from one animal to another. VHD virus can survive for several weeks in carcasses and skin. Fleas, blowflies and mosquitoes are known to spread the disease (Fenner and Fantani, 1999). PCR techniques have shown that virus can be retained in the body of blowflies for up to 9 days and bushflies for 7 days. Fly \u2018spots\u2019 (faeces) are also infective and can contaminate pasture. Flies can travel long distances and be carried along by the wind and spread the disease far and wide. It has also been demonstrated that domestic and wild carnivores can play an important role in the epidemiology of VHD since virulent material can be collected from faecal material after experimental oral inoculation. The virus is very stable in carcasses even after freezing and thawing (Lumeij, 1997). Up until October 1996, VHD was a notifiable disease in Great Britain. It is now endemic and poses a real threat to the pet rabbit due to its resistance and ease of transmission.

A feature of the disease is a dramatic drop in blood pressure that makes it difficult to find a vein to take blood samples or set up intravenous fluids. Dying rabbits are pallid, shocked and collapsed. Haematuria, haemorrhagic vaginal discharges or foamy/bloody exudate from the nostrils may be seen. Vascular infarcts can occur within the brain and occasionally convulsions or other neurological signs are seen just before death. Agonal vocalizing and cyanosis have been described (Donnelly, 1995).

The disease can be peracute, with animals being found dead within a few hours of eating and behaving normally.\u2022The \u2018classic\u2019 picture is a dead rabbit in opisthotonus with a haemorrhagic nasal discharge.\u2022Haematuria, haemorrhagic vaginal discharges or foamy exudate from the nostrils may be seen.\u2022Vascular infarcts can occur within the brain and occasionally convulsions or other neurological signs are seen just before death.\u2022There is no specific treatment for affected rabbits.\u2022Young rabbits, less than 4 weeks of age, remain unaffected and develop a lifelong immunity if they are exposed to the disease. Unexposed rabbits become increasingly susceptible until 6\u201310 weeks of age when physiological resistance to the virus disappears.\u2022The typical histopathological changes in the liver are usually diagnostic.\u2022An effective vaccine against VHD is available in the UK.\n\n",

The virus is transmitted in oral secretions containing sloughed cells from the warts. Young rabbits are most susceptible and the papillomas grow slowly over a period of 6\u20139 months. The animals become immune, at which point the base of the papilloma becomes inflamed, causing sloughing of the tumour, ulcer formation and finally re-epithelialization.
