The SARS outbreak was a timely reminder of the importance of education on virus infected communicable diseases. In Sept 2003, a one-year permanent exhibition-Convergence of Art, Science and Technology (CAST) was open to the public in the Singapore Art Museum. At the Gallery #10, a 3D Protein Roller-coaster was designed by the first author and his students [1, 2] aiming to have an innovative, intuitive, and interesting way for the public to understand SARS-related viruses and their protein structures ( Fig. 1.1a) . The exhibition received good response. Based on the same concept, a Bio X-game was designed and exhibited in Oct 2005 at the China Science and Technology Museum in Beijing ( Fig. 1.1b) . In this game, the protein ribbon structure was Interactive and Immersive 3D Visualization: a a protein roller coaster; and b a protein X-game 1 Introduction to 3D Immersive and Interactive Learning modeled following the Chinese Great Wall.

Since then, the school has organized various learning activities with their 3D learning environment. Mr Chow Ban Hoe from RVH will share his experience in Chap. 4 on 3D In-depth Learning in his school.

Rigid or deformable geometric Meshed geometry is a popular representation widely used today in animation and games. On the other hand, objects' physical behaviors should be modeled as well for the purpose of illustrating their physical properties and dynamic change processes. The particle system is commonly used to simulate various physical phenomena like fluid, fire, etc. Any objects in Immersive and Interactive Environments can be 3D modeled. The process of 3D modeling sometimes can be complicated. For instance, to model a protein molecule, one needs to deal with hundreds or even thousands of amino acids. Fidelity modeling, therefore, requires intensive domain knowledge about the context. It is highly important to create scientifically accurate models when describing and modeling learning content.",

Visualization, however, is traditionally 2D based. Objects or models in the 3D world of learning context are usually projected to 2D flat surfaces of printed textbook pages, blackboards, or projection screens. This projection could cause difficulty for students to figure out (or reconstruct) the disappeared third dimension of the original objects. Often, students are asked to use their imagination when dealing with 3D objects, or dynamic processes. This certainly poses challenges to many students (especially visual learners) when learning 3D based concepts using traditional 2D based learning paradigms. Human beings live in the 3D world. Stereopsis is a human visual function. By processing a pair of images from the left and right eyes, the depth information can be perceived by viewers [5] . Based on the principles of human stereopsis, different types of 3D stereoscopic vision techniques ( Fig. 1.8 ) are developed. Most of them synthesize the 3D perception by providing a pair of computer-generated images (one for the left eye and another for the right eye) with parallax information to produce the illusion of depth. While 3D modeling is a necessary task to develop Immersive and Interactive Environments, 3D visualization of 3D models is absolutely imperative in In-depth Learning.

Since 2007, a five day 3D sabbatical program is being conducted in HCI, thrice a year, which is open to all secondary students as an elective module. Based on the constructivism theory, the sabbatical is designed to allow students learning STEM in an active learning approach. Students are teamed up to do their project work. The learning topics covered so far in the sabbatical program ( Fig. 1.15 ) include Star Warship, Formula One, Unmanned Aerial Vehicle, Domini Chain, 3D Avatar, etc. Students pick up basic skills of 3D Modeling and Simulation and 3D Visualization. Also, they develop innovative ideas related to STEM throughout their team projects. Instructors of the sabbatical serve as facilitators providing students necessary helps during the program.",
