The aim of this review was to gather fragmented literature on ethnomedicinal plants used against bronchitis in the Himalayan region and their in-vitro validation against bronchitis causing viral pathogens. Key findings Present review contains ethnomedicines of total 55 plants from different countries of the Himalayas. Most of the literature reported was from India followed by Pakistan, China and Nepal. Familiarly used plant families for bronchitis treatment in the Himalayan region were Leguminosae (six plants) and Lamiaceae (five plants). Leaves and roots were the most common parts used in ethnomedicines against bronchitis. Of these 55 plants, only six plants have been studied in vitro against viral pathogens causing bronchitis. Different compounds like monoterpenoids, flavonoids, triterpenoids, iridoid glycosides, sesquiterpenes, benzoic and phenolic compounds were reportedly isolated from these plant extracts having strong antiviral potential. Summary The Himalayan regions possess variety of ethnomedicinal plants used against respiratory diseases, but still there are only few studies related with their in-vitro validation. We invite the attention of researchers for detailed ethnopharmacological and phytochemical studies on unexplored plants used to treat bronchitis for the development of novel antiviral drugs. Antiviral activity of Himalayan medicinal plants Rahila Amber et al.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "Bronchitis is a respiratory disease of humans, in which mucous membrane of the bronchial tubes become inflamed that carry oxygen from trachea to lungs. The main aetiological agents for this disease are viruses including influenza, rhinoviruses, adenoviruses, coronavirus and respiratory syncytial virus [1, 2] while some bacteria including Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydophila pneumoniae and Bordetella pertussis account for about 10% of cases. [3] Cigarette smoking, air pollution, occupational exposure to dust particles, irritants, fumes, polluted air particles and biomass fuels may also cause bronchitis. [4] Bronchitis is slowly progressive and largely irreversible disease with clinical signs and symptoms like sore throat, runny nose, airway obstruction, tiredness, sensation of tightness, burning or dull pain in the chest under the breast bone, shortness of breath, fever, sputum production and sputum tenacity. [5] According to World Health Organization report, respiratory tract infections are foremost cause of deaths among all contagious disease. [6] Viral diseases are life-threatening diseases with high degree of complications to the humans because of its rapid outbreak throughout the developing world. [7] [8] [9] Treatment of viral diseases is great challenge for the peoples even today because of different reasons like easily adaptations of virus, emergence of resistant viral pathogens, development of new viral strains, high cost and side effects of medicine, and host resistance to antiviral drugs. [10, 11] Antibiotics are ineffective against viral infections because viral envelope and set of replicating machinery are completely different than that of bacteria. [3] The common treatment for viral diseases includes antiviral drugs that do not destroy their target pathogen; instead, they inhibit their development, shorten infection and help prevent complications. [12] Bacteria involved in causing bronchitis have also shown resistance against commonly used antibiotics (azithromycin, clarithromycin, tosufloxacin, minocycline, rifamycins and telithromycin) against respiratory tract infections. [13, 14] In recent years, emergence of resistant potential of viral and bacterial pathogens against commonly used drugs particularly for respiratory tract infections has increased, which is a major public health problem and great hurdle in the treatment of these diseases. [12, 15] Generally, resistance of viral pathogens to chemotherapy has been shown in immune-compromised individuals. [16, 17] The pathogenic resistance patterns and high cost of antiviral drugs encourage the use of medicinal plants all over the world. [18] In Asia, the medicinal plant species are abundantly found in the Himalayan forests that play a key role in the rural livelihood, by supplying diversity of valuable products for food and medicine. [19] The Himalayan region is the largest mountain system blessed with large number of valuable medicinal plants because of its unique topographical, ecological, geographical, climatic and physiographical conditions. [20] The Himalayan medicinal plants have very immense historical background, earliest evidences and records of using plants as medicines originated from the Himalayas and can found in old texts of 'Rigveda' written 6500 year ago. [21] Local healers of the region have tremendous skills and knowledge of preparing traditional medicines for treating different kind of ailments. There is no exact figure about the number of the Himalayan medicinal plants being use for primary health care and livelihood, but most of the researchers documented that more than 10 000 Himalayan medicinal plants are supporting about 600 million people in the region. [22] Approximately 70-80% people worldwide depend on medicinal plants to cure various human ailments including viral diseases. [12] Herbal drugs have gained much importance due to their easily adaptability, low cost and fewer side reactions on patients. [23] Various traditional medicine systems like Ayurveda and Chinese medicine have gained popularity and used in various parts of the world. [24] Most of the people in the Himalayan region used medicinal plants traditionally to treat various diseases including bronchitis. Medicinal plants are considered as an important source of various bioactive compounds having antiviral properties, yet fewer studies have been done on antiviral potential of medicinal plants. [15] Literature is limited regarding the Himalayan medicinal plants used against viral diseases especially bronchitis. Main objectives of the present review were to gather utmost fragmented literature on the ethnomedicinal plants used to treat bronchitis in the Himalayan region and their in-vitro activity against viral pathogens and phytochemistry. This review will provide baseline information to the researchers about potential antiviral medicinal plants and will also disclose the scientific gaps in current knowledge that could lead towards the development of novel drugs for the welfare of human beings.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 303, "end": 306, "text": "[1,", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 307, "end": 309, "text": "2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 445, "end": 448, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 610, "end": 613, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 922, "end": 925, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 1061, "end": 1064, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 1221, "end": 1224, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 1225, "end": 1228, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 1229, "end": 1232, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 1524, "end": 1528, "text": "[10,", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 1529, "end": 1532, "text": "11]", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 1690, "end": 1693, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 1893, "end": 1897, "text": "[12]", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 2125, "end": 2129, "text": "[13,", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 2130, "end": 2133, "text": "14]", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 2398, "end": 2402, "text": "[12,", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 2403, "end": 2406, "text": "15]", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 2514, "end": 2518, "text": "[16,", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 2519, "end": 2522, "text": "17]", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 2649, "end": 2653, "text": "[18]", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 2850, "end": 2854, "text": "[19]", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 3066, "end": 3070, "text": "[20]", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 3296, "end": 3300, "text": "[21]", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 3711, "end": 3715, "text": "[22]", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 3838, "end": 3842, "text": "[12]", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 3965, "end": 3969, "text": "[23]", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 4105, "end": 4109, "text": "[24]", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 4429, "end": 4433, "text": "[15]", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "Published data on traditionally used medicinal plants for bronchitis and their antiviral activity were collected from the online bibliographical databases: PubMed, Scopus, Google Scholar, Web of Science and floras of the Himalayan countries.

[26] The most widely used plant families for the treatment of bronchitis in the Himalayan region are Leguminosae (six plants), Lamiaceae (five plants) and Asteraceae (four plants). High number of medicinal plants in these families might be due to their higher abundance in the study area, presence of most active secondary metabolites like flavonoids in the Leguminosae [27] ; monoterpenoids, flavonoids and triterpenoids of Lamiaceae [28] ; and sesquiterpene lactones in the Asteraceae. [29] Plants belonging to these families are not only used to treat bronchitis but also for many other human diseases in the Himalayan region. [30] [31] [32] These families are not only preferred in the Himalayan region but in other countries as well for medicinal purposes due to antimicrobial activity of their plants. [33, 34] Medicinal plants used to treat bronchitis in the Himalayan region are mostly herbs (58%) as compared to shrubs (24%) and trees (18%) because they are easily collected, their higher abundance and efficacy against different human pathogens and popularity in traditional medicine system. [35, 36] Mostly whole plants are used traditionally in recipe formation to treat bronchitis, which is major threat to the conservation status of these medicinal plants. Almost all plant parts are found to have antiviral activity but most preferred plant parts used are leaves, roots, bark and flowers (Table 1) . Different additives like water, sugar and honey are used in the recipe formation in order to reduce the bitter taste of plants as well as to reduce their toxic effects. [37, 38] Mixture of some plants is also used for recipes formulation in order to increase their efficacy due to synergistic effect of various compounds in these plants. [39, 40] As an example, leaves and seed extract of Cannabis sativa with pepper, cumin seeds and cardamom are given orally to treat bronchitis (Table 1) . Powder, infusion, decoction and extract are common techniques for recipe formation in the Himalayan region. The most preferred techniques are decoction and extract in the study area that might be due to their easy administration or efficacy of dissolved bioactive compounds in extract.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 48, "end": 52, "text": "[76]", "ref_id": "BIBREF76"}, {"start": 159, "end": 163, "text": "[59]", "ref_id": "BIBREF59"}, {"start": 174, "end": 178, "text": "[26]", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 363, "end": 367, "text": "[26]", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 733, "end": 737, "text": "[27]", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 798, "end": 802, "text": "[28]", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 851, "end": 855, "text": "[29]", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 993, "end": 997, "text": "[30]", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 998, "end": 1002, "text": "[31]", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 1003, "end": 1007, "text": "[32]", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}, {"start": 1171, "end": 1175, "text": "[33,", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}, {"start": 1176, "end": 1179, "text": "34]", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 1465, "end": 1469, "text": "[35,", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}, {"start": 1470, "end": 1473, "text": "36]", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}, {"start": 1947, "end": 1951, "text": "[37,", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}, {"start": 1952, "end": 1955, "text": "38]", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}, {"start": 2116, "end": 2120, "text": "[39,", "ref_id": "BIBREF38"}, {"start": 2121, "end": 2124, "text": "40]", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1766, "end": 1775, "text": "(Table 1)", "ref_id": "TABREF1"}, {"start": 2258, "end": 2267, "text": "(Table 1)", "ref_id": "TABREF1"}], "section": "Herb/Flowers Volatile oil of flower is used"}, {"text": "Data available on the Himalayan plants show that of 55 ethnomedicinally used plants, only six plants have been reportedly studied for their in-vitro activity against viral pathogens causing bronchitis. Whole plant and its different parts like leaves, flowers, aerial parts and rhizomes have been used for the preparation of extracts. Different solvents like aqueous, ethanol and methanol have been reportedly used for the extract preparation (Table 2) . Methanol and ethanol are most preferable solvents for plant extraction due to their polar nature that ensures the release of wide variety of bioactive compounds from plants. Plants extracted with these solvents have been reported for their good antimicrobial activity. [41, 42] The plant extracts have been taken in different concentrations ranging from 6.25 lg/ml to 10 000 lg/ml, which showed strong inhibition ranges from 16.67% to 100% against adenovirus and influenza virus.

[43] studied the anti-infective potential of natural product and defined the criteria for good activity as 100 lg/ml for extracts and essential oils while 10 lg/ml for pure compounds and drugs.

These techniques are also used in other countries for in-vitro antiviral study. [44, 45] Zingiber officinale has been investigated using plaque reduction test. In plaque reduction assay, crude fractions (pg per plate) were derived from the dose-response curve and from this the specific activity in units lg, where one unit of activity (1 u) was defined as the activity that reduced the number of plaques by 50% as compared to the virus controls. Flavan 5 was used as the positive control in the plaque reduction test. [30] Medicinal plants are the good source of various chemical compounds that provide basis for the development of new chemotherapeutic agents against various human pathogens. [10, 46] The mechanism of antiviral potential of plants extract or compounds varies among different viruses. Some phytochemical compounds of plants target viral envelope or membrane protein; others inhibit the formation of viral genome or stop attachment of virus to the host cellular machinery for reproduction while some destroy enzymes necessary for viral encoding. [15, 47] Acute respiratory infections (ARI) remain serious problem and leading cause of death in young children throughout the world especially in developing countries. Most frequently reported viruses include rhinovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, influenza virus A and bocavirus. Anders et al. [48] demonstrated a high burden of ARI during the first year of life in southern Vietnam. Emerging drug-resistant potential of influenza virus led towards identification of novel antiviral agents. First-generation influenza antiviral agents such as amantadine and rimantadine act on viral M2 protein and stated as ion channel blockers. However, their side effects are associated with patient nervous system and gastrointestinal tract. Moreover, rapid emergence of viral resistance limited the benefits and usefulness of adamantanes in the prevention and treatment of influenza. Complementary and alternative medicines with ethnopharmacological background suggest novel platform for the development of antiviral drugs. Antiviral potential compounds present in medicinal plants work either alone or in synergistic manner. Effectiveness of several medicinal plants extracts is directly associated with synergistic properties of therapeutically active compounds and their derivatives. However, slight cytotoxicity observed in plant extracts investigated might be due to the presence of cytoprotective components. These phytocompounds and extracts could serve as potential source for the development of innovative antiviral drugs. Present review reported plant extracts likely to be promising candidates in the race of developing thirdgeneration anti-influenza drugs, thus challenging the neuraminidase drug-resistant viruses in an effort to protect human health and the global economy. [49] Present review showed that the Himalayan plants contain several bioactive substances like monoterpenoids, flavonoids, triterpenoids, iridoid glycosides, sesquiterpenes, benzoic and phenolic compounds having strong antiviral activity. Among traditionally used medicinal plants of the Himalayan region, phytochemicals of only four plants (Justicia adhatoda, Ocimum basilicum, Plantago major and Zingiber officinale) have been directly checked against viral pathogens ( Table 2) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 102, "end": 106, "text": "[60]", "ref_id": "BIBREF60"}, {"start": 317, "end": 321, "text": "[44,", "ref_id": "BIBREF44"}, {"start": 322, "end": 325, "text": "45]", "ref_id": "BIBREF45"}, {"start": 756, "end": 760, "text": "[30]", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 931, "end": 935, "text": "[10,", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 936, "end": 939, "text": "46]", "ref_id": "BIBREF46"}, {"start": 1300, "end": 1304, "text": "[15,", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 1305, "end": 1308, "text": "47]", "ref_id": "BIBREF47"}, {"start": 1598, "end": 1602, "text": "[48]", "ref_id": "BIBREF48"}, {"start": 3080, "end": 3084, "text": "[49]", "ref_id": "BIBREF49"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 226, "end": 233, "text": "Table 2", "ref_id": "TABREF5"}, {"start": 3552, "end": 3560, "text": "Table 2)", "ref_id": "TABREF5"}], "section": "Herb/Leaves, Flowers"}, {"text": "Justicia adhatoda is a well-known plant in Ayurvedic and Unani medicine, a shrub which is widespread throughout the tropical regions of south-east Asia. Leaves of this plant have been used extensively for the treatment of respiratory disorders. Simultaneous assay of leaves showed 33% reduction at a concentration of 10 000 lg/ml in aqueous extract and 16.67% reduction was observed from 1000 lg/ml to 5000 lg/ml, whereas 100% reduction was observed in methanolic extract at a concentration of 10 000 lg/ml. As the concentration decreased, inhibition also found to be decreased from 33.34% at 1 mg/ml to 16.67% at 5000 lg/ ml. These data suggest that aqueous and methanolic extracts may directly interfere with protein envelope of viruses and not with sialic acid receptor at the cell surface. Only methanolic extract inhibited influenza virus infection by blocking viral attachment and inhibiting viral hemagglutinin (HA) protein. Vasicine alkaloids have been isolated from leaves, with percentage composition of 0.026% in methanol and 0.023% in aqueous extract which may be responsible for activity. [50] Ocimum basilicum L Sesquiterpenoid compounds like farnesol, caryophyllene, flavonoids such as apigenin (Figure 1 ), monoterpenes like linalool (Figure 2) , cineole, fenchone, carvone, myrcene, geraniol and thujone, and triterpenoids such as ursolic acid ( Figure 3 ) have been reportedly isolated from Ocimum basilicum. These compounds have been reported to inhibit various viral infections of DNA and RNA viruses. [28, 51] Only three types of secondary metabolites apigenin, linalool and ursolic acid have been checked directly against different types of human adenovirus involved in bronchitis. Among these ursolic acid showed maximum inhibition (50%) against adenovirus (ADV-8) at minimum concentration (4.2 lg/ml). Composition of all the isolated compounds is >95%. 2 0 ,3 0 -Dideoxycytidine is used as positive control and similar activity of ursolic acid ( Table 2) . Triterpenoid saponins of oleanane group inhibited the viral activity by inhibiting DNA synthesis, while urasane group inhibited viral protein capsid. [52] Other compounds need further investigation against viral pathogens involved in bronchitis. Toxicological studies showed that higher doses of plant cause stomach irritation. [53] Plantago major L Phytochemicals isolated from Plantago major contain five classes of biologically active compounds: aucubin O O OH HO OH Figure 1 Apigenin. [79] H 3 C CH 2 CH 3 OH H 3 C Figure 2 Linalool. [80] H HO H COOH Figure 3 Ursolic acid. [81] ( Figure 4 ) belongs to class iridoid glycoside, baicalein, baicalin and luteolin are derivatives of flavons ( Figure 5 ), and vanillic acid ( Figure 6 ) belongs to benzoic compounds and derivatives of cinnamic acid ( Figure 7 ) like caffeic acid, chlorogenic acid, ferulic acid, p-coumaric acid, triterpenes ursolic acid ( Figure 3 ) and oleanolic acid ( Figure 8 ). Invitro antiviral activity of these compounds has been checked against three types of human adenovirus at different concentrations. Although all compounds showed similar inhibition against adenovirus, but chlorogenic acid and caffeic acid had shown 50% inhibition against adenovirus at minimum concentration of about 13.3 and 14.2 lg/ml, respectively ( Table 2 ). The strong antiviral activity of phenolic compounds might be correlated with the presence of two hydroxyl groups on chlorogenic acid and caffeic acid than ferulic acid and p-coumaric acid with only one hydroxyl group. Phenolic compounds found effective for their antiviral activity not only against adenoviruses but also against many other viral pathogens. [10, 46] Many bioactive chemical classes like flavonoids, triterpenes, sesquiterpenes, phenolic and benzoic compounds isolated from many other plants have been investigated for their antiviral activity. [10, 15, 28, 47, 51] Toxicological studies showed no toxicity of methanolic extract with doses up 2 g/kg body weight in an acute toxicity assay. Contrary to this result, another study suggested that oral administration of an aqueous extract (1000 mg/kg body weight) of leaves had shown highest reduction in the total acidity of gastric fluid in rats. [54] Another study reported that oral administration of aqueous extract (2000 mg/kg) of Plantago major for total 40 days did result in mortality of model organism. [52] Zingiber officinale Roscoe Figure 5 Derivatives of flavons. [83] COOH OH OCH 3 Figure 6 Vanillic acid. [84] 4, 6-dichloroflavan have been isolated from Z. officinale and investigated for their antiviral activity. All these compounds showed 50% inhibition against viral pathogens at different concentrations. 4, 6-Dichloroflavan was considered to be the most effective compound as it showed 50% inhibition against rhinovirus at very lowest concentration about 0.02 lg/ml ( Table 2 ). The lipophilic nature of 4, 6-dichloroflavan has been attributed to its antirhinoviral activity as Z. officinale is known to contain various lipophilic secondary metabolites. [30] Dichloroflavan isolated from other natural products has also been investigated against rhinovirus and showed its strongest ability to bind with most sensitive rhinovirus IB at their receptor sites. Many bioactive compounds isolated from higher plants have been checked for their antiviral activity particularly for their antirhinoviral activity. Available data showed that most of the antirhinoviral activity of plants attributed to the presence of flavonoids compounds. [55, 56] Administration of aqueous extracts either individually or in combination altered the relative weights of the heart, liver and kidney of the animals which is an indication of a toxic effect. [57, 58] Verbascum thapsus L Methanolic extract of Verbascum thapsus showed strong efficacy about 50% at minimum concentration of 6.25 lg/ ml against influenza A virus. Phenylethanoid and lignan glycosides have been isolated from methanolic extract of V. thapsus. Phytoconstituents responsible for anti-influenza viral activity depend on the amount of active compounds present in the plants which alternatively depends on the geographical distribution, collected season, climatic and ecological condition at the site of plant collection. Further fractionation and separation of extract(s) may reveal potent antiviral activity from this plant. No toxicity has been observed for higher doses. [ Figure 7 Derivatives of cinnamic acid.
