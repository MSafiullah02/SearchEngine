It is shown that depending on the distribution of the extrinsic noise, the master equation yields quantitatively different results compared to using the expectation of the distribution for the stochastic parameter. This difference is incident to the nonlinear terms in the master equation, and we show that the deviation away from the expectation of the extrinsic noise scales nonlinearly with the variance of the distribution. The method presented here converges linearly with respect to the number of particles in the system and exponentially with respect to the order of the polynomials used in the stochastic collocation calculation. This makes the method presented here more accurate than standard Monte Carlo methods, which suffer from slow, nonmonotonic convergence. In epidemiological terms, the results show that extrinsic fluctuations should be taken into account since they effect the speed of disease breakouts and that the gamma distribution should be used to model the basic reproductive number.",

An important example is stochastic chemical kinetics, which describes the time evolution of chemically reacting systems by taking into account the fact that molecules are discrete entities that exhibit randomness in their dynamical behavior. A master equation [3, 4] can be used to model this probabilistic process. The number of variables in this equation is large for all but the simplest systems, so analytical or direct numerical integration methods are usually impractical. Alternatively, Monte Carlo samples of the stochastic process can be numerically generated via stochastic simulation algorithms (SSAs) [5] .",

Here we examine the role of extrinsic noise on the master equation. We couple a high-order expansion of the master equation with a stochastic collocation method and analyze various sources of uncertainty modeled with uniform, beta, and gamma distributions. We show that depending on the distribution of the extrinsic noise, the master equation yields quantitatively different results compared to using the expectation of the distribution for the parameter. The use of a gamma distribution is based on an empirical study on the basic reproductive number in severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) [18] .

We note that there are restrictions on the applicability of the method as well as assumptions in the underlying model. Restrictions on the applicability of the method are (1) the stochastic process must be a so-called L 2 random variable, meaning that it must have a finite second moment [22] and (2) the error term incident to the expansion of the master equation is inversely proportional to the system size and therefore may be inaccurate for small systems. For example, a process with extrinsic noise from a Cauchy distribution would violate the L 2 assumption. We also make assumptions on the validity of the underlying model. Since the underlying equations rely on a compartmental model for the species, we assume that the system is well mixed such that mass action kinetics are valid.

The propensities (unscaled probabilities for each reaction) are defined as follows: a 1 = \u03b2 n SI and a 2 = \u03baI for Eqs. (1) and (2) . At each time step in the stochastic simulation algorithm, two random variables govern the evolution of the system, namely, a reaction index and a time step. The reaction index is sampled from a pointwise distribution for the propensities, i.e., P (j = l) = a l /(a 1 + a 2 ), and a time step \u03c4 is sampled from an exponential distribution with a mean of 1/(a 1 + a 2 ). The system is updated by executing the reaction with index j and incrementing the system time by \u03c4 . Figure 4 shows the fraction of infectious individuals for 100 trajectories of a stochastic simulation along with the mean over time using a total of N = 2 \u00d7 10 4 samples.

To analyze the role of extrinsic noise in a susceptible-infectious-recovered model, we used the uniform, beta, and gamma distributions. While the difference was small in the case of a uniform or beta distribution, the gamma distribution caused the infection to peak earlier in time and therefore caused the infectious individuals to go zero earlier than the continuum model and stochastic models without noise. This is of importance to the public health community since a faster disease progression observed in empirical data may lead to an erroneous estimation of the reproductive number in a continuum model without extrinsic noise. We showed that the deviation away from the expectation of the extrinsic noise scaled nonlinearly with the variance of the input distribution. In epidemiological terms, the results imply that both intrinsic and extrinsic fluctuations should be taken into account since they may affect the speed of disease breakouts.",

Efficient numerical methods, such as the Smolyak sparse-grid construction [27, 28] , could be used for a stochastic collocation method.",
