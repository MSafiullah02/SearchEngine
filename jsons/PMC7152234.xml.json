Inhibition of pyrimidine synthesis was proposed to be an important mechanism of action and was molecularly confirmed by showing a direct leflunomide-mediated inhibition of the enzyme dihydroorotate dehydrogenase.306 Lymphocytes rely entirely on the de novo pathway of pyrimidine biosynthesis and cannot use another, so-called pyrimidine salvage, pathway. Dihydroorotate dehydrogenase inhibition leads to depletion of the nucleotide precursors uridine triphosphate and cytidine triphosphate, which are necessary for the synthesis of RNA and DNA, and hence strongly suppresses DNA and RNA synthesis.",

Phosphorylation of the epidermal growth factor receptor of human fibroblasts has been shown to be inhibited by leflunomide.168 It also was shown that leflunomide directly inhibited the interleukin (IL)-2\u2013stimulated protein tyrosine kinase activity of p56lck168 and of p59fyn, which is associated with activation through the T cell receptor/CD3 complex. At higher concentrations, A771726 also inhibited IL-2\u2013induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Janus kinase 1 (JAK1) and JAK3 protein tyrosine kinases, which initiate signaling by the IL-2 receptor.70 In studies attempting to design inhibitors of the antiapoptotic tyrosine kinase Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK), leflunomide analogues were shown to exhibit strong inhibitory activities.154 Because BTK is a key factor for T cell\u2013independent antibody formation, this effect of leflunomide may explain its high potency in the suppression of T cell\u2013independent IgM xenoantibody formation (see later).",

In the animal model of autoimmune diabetes in the NOD mouse, upregulation of regulator cells and a shift away from Th1 toward Th2 could be observed in 1,25(OH)2D3-treated mice locally in the pancreas and in the peripheral immune system.186 A restoration of the defective sensitivity to apoptosis characteristic for NOD T lymphocytes was observed, resulting in a better elimination of autoreactive effector cells.39,\n41,\n64,\n65 This increased sensitivity to apoptosis has been described for different apoptosis-inducing signals. This mechanism may explain why an early and short-term 1,25(OH)2D3 treatment before the clinical onset of autoimmunity can lead to long-term protection and restoration of self-tolerance.42 This arrest in the progression of autoimmune diabetes in NOD mice treated with an analogue of 1,25(OH)2D3 was shown to be associated with an enhanced frequency of regulatory T cells in the pancreatic lymph nodes.92 A clear additive and even synergistic effect was observed between 1,25(OH)2D3 or its analogues and other, more classic immunosuppressants, such as cyclosporine, sirolimus, or mycophenolate mofetil, in vitro and in different in vivo autoimmune disease models, such as autoimmune diabetes40,\n42,\n95 and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis.31,\n32,\n288\n",

The overall conclusion that can be drawn from these studies is that as monotherapy, 1,25(OH)2D3 and its analogues provoke only a modest prolongation of graft function. This is not surprising in view of the weak intrinsic effects of 1,25(OH)2D3 and its analogues on T cells. In conjunction with other immunosuppressants, strong synergistic effects often can be observed, however.91,\n96,\n114,\n118,\n187,\n207, 208, 209\n295 In addition, in view of its effect on antigen presentation and on directing the immune system in the Th2 direction, 1,25(OH)2D3 may help to induce tolerance.91 A major concern remains, however, the side effects of 1,25(OH)2D3 on calcium and bone metabolism. The use of 1,25(OH)2D3 analogues, which have maintained or amplified immunomodulatory effects in combination with reduced effects on calcium and bone, already partially conquer this problem.30,\n289 The additional use of calcium-lowering methods, such as limited nutrient calcium intake, and bone resorption inhibitors, such as bisphosphonates, aid in further bypassing the negative side effects of hypercalcemia and excessive bone resorption,287 facilitating the step toward the clinical applicability of 1,25(OH)2D3 and its analogues for their potent immunomodulatory properties.",

This possibility is suggested further by the report of Yadav and colleagues,316 who showed that in living related transplant recipients who were given cyclophosphamide instead of azathioprine because of hepatic dysfunction or because of the high cost and unavailability of azathioprine, complications attributed directly to cyclophosphamide were minimal.

Long-term (8-year) follow-up revealed that rejection episodes were more frequent and patient and graft survivals were significantly inferior in the TLI-treated group. The excess mortality in the TLI-treated patients was due to sepsis, resulting from high-dose steroid therapy needed to treat rejection crises.

The safety and efficacy of photopheresis in the prevention of acute rejection of cardiac allografts have been evaluated in primary cardiac allograft recipients randomly assigned to standard triple-drug immunosuppressive therapy (cyclosporine, azathioprine, and prednisone) alone or in conjunction with 24 photopheresis sessions performed during the first 6 months after transplantation. After 6 months of follow-up, photopheresis-treated patients developed significantly fewer rejections, and there were no significant differences in the rates or types of infection. Although there was no significant effect on graft survival rates at 6 or 12 months, this study indicated that photopheresis may be an effective new immunosuppressive regimen in transplant recipients.15 In patients with refractory bronchiolitis obliterans after lung transplantation, photopheresis resulted in a stabilization of graft function, and in some of these patients it resulted in histological reversal of rejection.181,\n221\n",

Encouraging early results of this approach have been reported, although they were associated with considerable morbidity.268 Immunoadsorption has been applied as an alternative to plasmapheresis and was found to be an equally efficient method.190,\n282,\n283 Studies of this approach in highly sensitized candidate transplant recipients are continuing, in particular, the search for drugs that selectively prevent synthesis of antibodies but perhaps may be less toxic than cyclophosphamide.",
