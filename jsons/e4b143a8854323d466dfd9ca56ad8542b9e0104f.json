By advancing capabilities of artificial intelligence (AI) and leveraging the largescale and real-time data generated from heterogeneous sources (e.g., disease related data from official public health organizations, demographic data, mobility data, and user geneated data from social media), in this work, we propose and develop an AI-driven system (named \u03b1-Satellite), as an initial offering, to provide hierarchical community-level risk assessment to assist with the development of strategies for combating the fast evolving COVID-19 pandemic. More specifically, given a specific location (either user input or automatic positioning), the developed system will automatically provide risk indexes associated with it in a hierarchical manner (e.g., state, county, city, specific location) to enable individuals to select appropriate actions for protection while minimizing disruptions to daily life to the extent possible. The developed system and the generated benchmark datasets have been made publicly accessible through our website 1 . The system description and disclaimer are also available in our website.",

The novel coronavirus and its deadly outbreak have posed grand challenges to human society. As of March 26, 2020 , there have been 85,377 confirmed cases and 1,293 reported deaths in the U.S. (Figure 1 ); and the WHO characterized COVID-19 -which has infected more than 531,000 people with more than 24,000 deaths in at least 171 countries -a global pandemic. It is believed that the novel virus which causes COVID-19 emerged from an animal source, but it is now rapidly spreading from personto-person through various forms of contact. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) [4] , the coronavirus seems to be spreading easily and sustainably in the community -i.e., community transmission which means people have been infected with the virus in an area, including some who are not sure how or where they became infected. An example of community transmission that caused the outbreak of COVID-19 in King County at Washington State (WA) is shown in Figure 2 . The challenge with community transmission is that carriers are often asymptomatic and unaware that they are infected and through their movements within the community they spread the disease. According to the CDC, before a vaccine or drug becomes widely available (i.e., this is the case for COVID-19 by far), community mitigation, which is a set of actions that persons and communities can take to help slow the spread of respiratory virus infections, is the most readily available interventions to help slow transmission of the virus in communities [5] . A growing number of areas reporting local sub-national community transmission would represent a significant turn for the worse in the battle against the novel coronavirus, which points to an urgent need for expanded surveillance so we can better understand the spread of COVID-19 and thus better respond with actionable strategies for community mitigation. Unlike the 1918 influenza pandemic [2] where the global scope and devastating impacts were only determined well after the fact, COVID-19 history is being written daily, if not hourly, and if the right types of data can be acquired and analyzed there is the potential to improve self awareness of the risk to the population and develop proactive (rather than reactive) interventions that can halt the exponential growth in the disease that is currently being observed. Realizing the true potential of real-time surveillance, with this opportunity comes the challenge: the available data are uncertain and incomplete while we need to provide mitigation strategies objectively with caution and rigor (i.e., enable people to select appropriate actions to protect themselves at increased risk of COVID-19 while minimize disruptions to daily life to the extent possible).",

Another research direction is to utilize public accessible data to help the estimation of infection cases or forecast the COVID-19 outbreak [14, 17, 18, 22, 25, 27, 46] . However, most of these existing works mainly focus on Wuhan China; the studies of using computational models to combat COVID-19 in the U.S. are scarce and there has no work on community-level risk assessment to assist with community mitigation by far. To meet this urgent need and to bridge the research gap, in this work, by advancing capabilities of AI and leveraging the large-scale and real-time data generated from heterogeneous sources, we propose and develop an AI-driven system, named \u03b1-Satellite, to provide hierarchical community-level risk assessment at the first attempt to help combat the deadly and fast evolving COVID-19 pandemic.",

The collected up-to-date countybased COVID-19 related statistical data can be an important element for risk assessment of an associated area. \u2022 Demographic data. The United States Census Bureau 3 provides the demographic data including basic population, business, and geography statistics for all states and counties, and for cities and towns with more than 5,000 people. The demographic information will contribute to the risk assessment of an associated area: for example, as older adults may be at higher risk for more serious complications from COVID-19 [3, 30] , the age distribution of a given area can be considered as an important input. In this work, given a specific area, we mainly consider the associated demographic data including the estimated population, population density (e.g., number of people per square mile), age and gender distributions. \u2022 Mobility data. Given a specific area (either user input or automatic positioning), a mobility measure that estimates how busy the area is in terms of traffic density will be retained from location service providers (i.e., Google maps). \u2022 User generated data from social media. As users in social media are likely to discuss and share their experiences of COVID-19, the data from social media may contribute complementary knowledge such as public perceptions towards COVID-19 in the area they associate with. In this work, we initialize our efforts with the focus on Reddit, as it provides the platform for scientific discussion of dynamic policies, announcements, symptoms and events of COVID-19. In particular, we consider i) three subreddits with general discussion (i.e., r/Coronavirus 4 , r/COVID19 5 and r/CoronavirusUS 6 ); ii) four region-based subreddits, which are r/CoronavirusMidwest, r/CoronavirusSouth, r/CoronavirusSouthEast and r/CoronavirusWest; and iii) 48 statebased subreddits (i.e., Washington, D.C. and 47 states). To analyze public perceptions towards COVID-19 for a given area (note that all users are anonymized for analysis using hash values of usernames), we first exploit Stanford Named Entity Recognizer [12] to extract the location-based information (e.g., county, city), and then utilize tools such as NLTK [1] to conduct sentiment analysis (i.e., positive, neutral or negative). More specifically, positive denotes well aware of COVID-19, while negative indicates less aware of COVID-19. For example, with the analysis of the post by a user (with hash value of \"CF***6\") in subreddit of r/CoronaVirusPA on March 14, 2020: \"I live in Montgomery County, PA and everyone here is acting like there's nothing going on.\", the location-related information of Montgomery county and Pennsylvania state (i.e., PA) can be extracted, and a user's perception towards COVID-19 in Montgomery county at PA can be learned (i.e., negative indicating less aware of COVID-19). Such automatically extracted knowledge will be incorporated into the risk assessment of the related area; meanwhile, it can also provide important information to help inform and educate about the science of coronavirus transmission and prevention.",

For the previous example of the Reddit post of \"I live in Montgomery County, PA and everyone here is acting like there's nothing going on. \", a related perception towards COVID-19 in Montgomery County at PA will be formulated as a numeric vale of 0.220, denoting people in this area were less aware of COVID-19 on March 14, 2020.

Heterogeneous Graph Auto-encoder. Given a node (i.e., area) in the constructed AHIN, guided by its corresponding meta-path scheme (i.e., city level guided by P1, county level guided by P2, and state level guided by P3), to aggregate the information propagated from its neighborhood nodes, we propose a heterogeneous graph auto-encoder (GAE) model to achieve this goal. The designed heterogeneous GAE model consists of an encoder and a decoder: the encoder aims at encoding meta-path based propagation to a latent representation, and the decoder will reconstruct the topological information from the representation. Encoder. We here exploit attentive mechanism [9, 31, 33] to devise the encoder: it will first search the meta-path based neighbors N (v) for each node v, and then each node will attentively aggregate information from its neighbors. To learn the importance of the information from neighborhood nodes, we first present each relation type r \u2208 R in the constructed AHIN by R r \u2208 R d a \u00d7d a , where d a denotes the dimension of the attributed feature vector; and then the attentive weight \u03b2 of node u (the neighbor of v) indicate the relevance of these two nodes measured in terms of the space R r , that is,",

We have developed a set of crawling and preprocessing tools to collect and parse the largescale and real-time pandemic related data from multiple sources, including disease related data from official public health organizations and digital media, demographic data, mobility data, and user generated data from social media (i.e., Reddit). We have made our collected and proprocessed data available for public use through the above link. We describe each publicly accessible benchmark dataset (i.e., DB 1 -DB 4 ) in detail below. DB 1 : disease related dataset. According to simplemaps 9 , the U.S. includes 50 states, Washington, D.C. and Puerto Rico as well as 3,203 counties and 28,889 cities. We have collected the up-to-date countybased coronavirus related data including the numbers of confirmed cases, new cases, deaths and the fatality rate, from official public health organizations (e.g., WHO, CDC, and county government websites) and digital media with real-time updates of COVID-19 (e.g., 1point3acres).

In this work, we initialize our efforts on social media data with the focus of public perception analysis on Reddit, as it provides the platform for scientific discussion of dynamic policies, announcements, symptoms and events of COVID-19.

Figure 7 .(a) shows an example: given the location of Euclid Ave, Cleveland, OH 44106, the risk index provided by the system was 0.662 (with public perception of 0.529, demographic density of 1,389, and traffic status of 3) at 3:58pm EDT on March 24, 2020. At the same time, the risk indexes and public perceptions of corresponding county (i.e., Cuyahoga county with risk index of 0.665 and public perception of 0.585) and state (i.e., OH state with risk index of 0.554 and public perception of 0.557) will also be shown in a hierarchical manner to enable people to select appropriate actions for protection while minimizing disruptions to daily life.

When a user inputs the areas he/she are interested in (e.g., grocery stores near me) in the search bar, the system will display the nearby grocery stores using Google maps application programming interface (API) and automatically provide the associated indexes.

From Figure 8 , we can observe that the indexes of nearby areas might vary due to the factors of different public perceptions towards COVID-19 and different traffic statuses in specific areas.

Heterogeneous Graph Auto-encoder. Given a node (i.e., area) in the constructed AHIN, guided by its corresponding meta-path scheme (i.e., city level guided by P1, county level guided by P2, and state level guided by P3), to aggregate the information propagated from its neighborhood nodes, we propose a heterogeneous graph auto-encoder (GAE) model to achieve this goal. The designed heterogeneous GAE model consists of an encoder and a decoder: the encoder aims at encoding meta-path based propagation to a latent representation, and the decoder will reconstruct the topological information from the representation. Encoder. We here exploit attentive mechanism [9, 31, 33] to devise the encoder: it will first search the meta-path based neighbors N (v) for each node v, and then each node will attentively aggregate information from its neighbors. To learn the importance of the information from neighborhood nodes, we first present each relation type r \u2208 R in the constructed AHIN by R r \u2208 R d a \u00d7d a , where d a denotes the dimension of the attributed feature vector; and then the attentive weight \u03b2 of node u (the neighbor of v) indicate the relevance of these two nodes measured in terms of the space R r , that is,",
