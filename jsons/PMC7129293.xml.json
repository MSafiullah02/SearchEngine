The severe respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) is mainly transmitted via respiratory droplets and can be transmitted between humans [1], [2], [3]. Common symptoms include fever, cough, dyspnoea, and myalgia/fatigue while less common symptoms include sputum production, headache, haemoptysis, and diarrhoea [4]. By 13 March 2020, the reported incidence of COVID-19 cases exceeded 80,000 in China of which more than 60% was in Wuhan city, and more than 80% was in Hubei province [5,6]. Globally, Thailand, Japan, South Korea, Singapore, Malaysia, France, Canada, Australia, Germany, the United Kingdom, the United States, and 111 other countries have reported COVID-19 cases.[7] Most of the confirmed cases were locally transmitted cases outside of China [7].",

Normally, China can produce about 20 million facemasks per day while the productivity during the Chinese New Year holiday was lower (12 million facemasks per day) [12]. However, even if full productivity could be achieved, 20 million facemasks per day do not seem to meet the needs of a population of 1\u00b74 billion in China under a universal facemask wearing policy. Therefore, to control the COVID-19 outbreak, the Chinese government imported more than 2\u00b70 billion facemasks between 24 Jan 2020 and 29 Feb 2020 and extended the Chinese New Year holiday to allow for home quarantine in order to reduce the need for facemasks and other medical resources [13]. A number of factories also resumed partial productivity during the holiday by paying extra wages to their workers [14].",

The numbers of infected inpatient, suspected, and observational cases between 20 Jan 2020 and 14 March 2020 were obtained from the NHC. Based on the clinical experience of chief physicians in China, we assumed the need for facemasks of each healthcare worker in Hubei province (\u03b11(d)) and in other regions (\u03b12(d)) on day d during our prediction period. We also assumed each infected inpatient, suspected, and observational case, and the general population would need five, two, two, and one facemask per day, respectively. We assumed that 50% of facemask consumption (\u03c31) consisted of N95 facemasks among healthcare workers in Hubei province and 10% (\u03c32) in other regions. We assumed that the percentages of general population wearing facemasks in Hubei province (Pg.h(d)) and in other regions of mainland China (Pg.o(d)) changed as the outbreak entered different stages.

Panic-buying and facemask price surges were reported on 20 Jan 2020 right after the confirmation of human-to-human transmission [21]. The Chinese government introduced price controls for facemasks on 25 Jan 2020 [22]. This observation indicated a facemask shortage starting as early as 20 Jan 2020, and there is no clear evidence showing the shortage has been relieved at the time of this analysis (14 Mar 2020). Our prediction model estimated the severity of the shortage between 20 Jan 2020 and 30 Jun 2020. In all of the facemask wearing policy scenarios, the shortage of N95 facemasks would occur on day 4 (24 Jan 2020) and last until the end of our prediction period (with a 2\u00b72 million shortage), except for the period from 12 Feb 2020 to 5 Mar 2020. Specifically, in Scenario 1, assuming the universal facemask wearing policy was implemented in the whole of China, 392\u00b76 million facemasks would have been in short supply on day 1 (21 Jan 2020), and the shortage would end on day 132 (31 May 2020). In Scenario 2, assuming a universal facemask wearing policy was implemented in Hubei province (the epicenter), 5\u00b73 million facemasks would have been in short supply on day 4 (24 Jan 2020), and the shortage would end on day 10 (30 Jan 2020). In Scenario 3, assuming a universal facemask wearing policy was not implemented at all, 34\u00b76 million facemasks were in short supply on day 7 (27 Jan 2020), and the shortage would end on day 10 (30 Jan 2020). During the prediction period, the maximum daily shortages of facemasks were 589\u00b75, 49\u00b73, and 37\u00b75 million in each of the three scenarios, respectively.",

Our findings suggest that a facemask shortage, particularly for N95 facemasks, would occur regardless of the implementation of a universal facemask wearing policy. However, the facemask shortage could be much more severe if a universal facemask wearing policy was implemented in the whole of China rather than the most severely affected areas. In addition, the shortage of N95 facemask were not alleviated under the existing public health measures.",

Confirmed infected and suspected cases are also recommended to wear a facemask to minimize virus transmission [10]. Numerous studies have reported the effects of wearing facemasks on restricting virus transmission, such as a 3\u20134-fold decrease in aerosol-associated viruses and lower transmission rate among their close contacts [23,24]. Thus, maintaining a stable supply of facemasks (especially N95 facemasks) with a priority given to healthcare workers and infected people is crucial for outbreak control [25,26]. In some East Asian regions, wearing a facemask in public during flu seasons and disease outbreaks is considered a measure to constrain asymptomatic transmission in the community settings and a social responsibility norm for outbreak control, particularly after the experience of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2003 [27]. However, universal facemask wearing was not recommended by WHO [28]. Previous studies found that wearing facemasks may be effective only when combined with hand hygiene, and this combined measure could reduce exposure to aerosolized influenza virus by 6-fold [18,28,29]. Therefore, to reduce transmission of respiratory viruses, a combination of public health measures is needed, for example, frequent hand-washing, wearing masks and gloves, and isolation for infected and suspected cases [9].",

However, implementation of these responses was not always timely, and the virus eventually spread throughout the entire country. As soon as the general population began to realize the severity of the outbreak, facemask consumption surged in only a few days, partly due to the lack of information concerning the novel virus and panic buying [18]. Under these circumstances, the Chinese government made several attempts at various efforts with respect to public communication, including updating data concerning the latest facemask productivity, release of guidelines on facemask usage, stabilizing facemask prices on the market, and offering a facemask lottery in official pathways. NHC classified each province unit into different risk levels (high-, middle-, and low-risk) and implemented corresponding strategies for outbreak control on 27 Feb 2020 [33]. This strategy was similar to Scenario 2 in our analysis (universal facemask wearing policy implemented in the epicenter/high-risk region). The experience in China during the COVID-19 outbreak shows that a universal facemask wearing policy should be introduced with caution. In addition, both Hong Kong (with universal facemask wearing) and Singapore (without universal facemask wearing) experienced a slow increase in the number of new cases, indicating that a universal facemask wearing policy may not be necessary for outbreak control [34]. Given that the demand for facemasks can increase dramatically due to panic-buying, a universal facemask wearing policy in high-risk regions may be more appropriate to prevent massive asymptomatic infection. However, without effective public communication, a universal facemask wearing policy, even in specific regions, can result in panic throughout society and subsequently, increase the nationwide and worldwide demands for facemasks. These increased demands could cause a facemask shortage for healthcare workers and reduce the effectiveness of outbreak control in the affected regions, eventually leading to a pandemic.",

We provided a detailed summary of the public health measures introduced by the Chinese government concerning facemasks and considered three facemask wearing policy scenarios. Nevertheless, there are some limitations in this study. First, our estimation relied on the assumptions of facemask productivity, import, storage, and need. Relevant information was limited at the time that the analyses were performed (during the epidemic). Second, we did not consider logistics cost that could restrict facemask supplies on the markets. Thus, our analysis is likely to underestimate the severity of the facemask shortage experienced by the healthcare workers and other user groups. Third, our prediction ended in late June considering the epidemic has been predicted to fade out by that time [17]. However, if imported infected cases cannot be controlled, the end of the epidemic will be delayed; thus, the daily incidence and facemask demand will also increase. Nevertheless, the anxiety in the population may result in constant demands for facemasks even when the epidemic is under controlled.",
