During a pandemic, health care workers would be at tremendous risk for exposure to the virus as they care for a surge of infected patients. To implement effective infection control measures in health care facilities, the pathways by which the disease spreads from person to person need to be identified so that transmission can be interrupted. Although influenza is known to infect people through contact with respiratory secretions containing the virus, it is possible to transfer this infectious material between people in many different ways, and the importance of different routes of infection is not yet known.(1)",

If influenza is disseminated to a significant degree by airborne transmission, this would suggest that interventions in health care facilities such as improved ventilation and filtration, air disinfection, patient isolation and cohorting, and the use of respirators or other personal protective equipment might be required to reduce its spread, especially during a pandemic. However, the role of aerosol particles in the dispersion of influenza has not been clearly determined. Some investigators have concluded that transmission by airborne particles accounts for a significant fraction of influenza cases,(2\u20134) while others believe that it rarely, if ever, occurs.(5)",

Only four studies have reported detecting viable influenza virus in airborne particles, and these results were limited. Lindsley et al.(16) were able to culture influenza virus from aerosol samples collected from 2 out of 20 influenza patients during voluntary coughs. Similarly, Milton et al.(17) detected viable influenza in the fine particle fraction (<5 \u03bcm) from 2 of their 37 patients. Lednicky and Loeb (11) detected viable airborne influenza virus in particles from 1 \u03bcm to <0.25 \u03bcm up to 3.7 m from their patients. Hatagishi et al.(19) detected viable influenza in droplets and aerosol particles collected on dry gelatin filters from 3 of 56 influenza patients. These studies demonstrate that at least some influenza patients do eject aerosol particles containing viable influenza virus into the environment, but because of the limited sample numbers, many questions remain. It is not clear what fraction of influenza patients release infectious virus in aerosols, how much infectious virus is released, or how much this varies depending upon the stage or severity of the illness or the strain of the virus.",

A stainless steel tray was attached to the piston of the mechanical spirometer to collect any large ballistic cough spray droplets that impacted the piston. Cough aerosol particles were collected using an SKC BioSampler with a 5 ml vessel (#225-9593, SKC, Eighty Four, PA) containing 5 ml of viral transport media (VTM) consisting of Hank's Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS, Invitrogen, Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY) supplemented with 0.1% bovine serum albumin (BSA, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO), 100 units/ml penicillin G and 100 units/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen). The SKC BioSampler collects particles with aerodynamic diameters of approximately 0.3 \u03bcm to 8 \u03bcm into the collection media, although the upper cut-off diameter is not sharp.(20\u201322) The SKC BioSampler has an elbow at its inlet. Based on studies of particle collection in bends,(23) particles approximately 10 to 15 \u03bcm and larger in diameter would be expected to accumulate in the elbow.\n",

The subject's oral temperature was measured and a brief health questionnaire was administered. The subject was then asked to sit in front of the cough aerosol collection system. The subject was instructed to inhale as deeply as possible, seal his or her mouth around the mouthpiece, and cough into the machine using as much of the air in his or her lungs as possible. After each cough, the cough-generated aerosol was collected using the aerosol sampler. This procedure was repeated for a total of six coughs from each subject.",

The largest amount of viable influenza A was detected in the media of the aerosol sampler, which collects the smallest particles (0.3 to 8 \u03bcm). These results are consistent with previous studies.(11,16,17) Since the collection efficiencies of the sampler elbow and droplet tray have not been measured, it is not clear if the differences in the amount of virus detected occurred because no viable virus was present in the larger particles, virus collected on the dry surfaces of the elbow and tray but then lost its viability, or if these particles were not collected. However, the fact that viable influenza A was detected in the smallest particles is quite important, because the smallest aerosol particles are also the ones that remain airborne the longest (an 8 \u03bcm particle takes about 13 min to fall 1.5 m in still air, and the settling time rapidly increases as particle size decreases).(26) Small particles also are easiest to inhale, and can deposit most deeply in the respiratory tract. Thus, airborne influenza A virus was detected in the small particles that are most likely to cause airborne transmission.",

More studies with larger numbers of patients and with a broader range of medical conditions will be needed to fully understand the amount of viable airborne virus that is projected into the environment by patients. Second, our experiments focused on viable virus released during coughing. However, this does not mean that infectious virus is not released during other respiratory maneuvers such as breathing and speaking. Third, we asked the study participants to inhale deeply and cough using as much of the air in their lungs as possible. This produced a deeper and more forceful cough than would be seen during natural coughs, which may have increased aerosol production. Lastly, although our results show that patients with influenza A expel small airborne particles carrying viable influenza A virus into the environment, they do not show that transmission actually occurs by the airborne route, nor do they indicate what the relative risk is that the virus could be spread by the airborne pathway compared to other means. More work will be needed to determine the likelihood of airborne transmission in real-world environments and the necessity of interventions to prevent it.",

            "text": "The purpose of this study was to gain insight into production of potentially infectious aerosol particles by influenza patients during coughing. Our results suggest that a significant proportion of patients with influenza A release airborne particles containing viable virus into the environment. Although the amount of airborne influenza A virus found in our study was low, the infectious dose for aerosol transmission is also reported to be low, and higher emission levels could be seen from patients in a severe pandemic. Our findings support the idea that airborne transmission could play an important role in the spread of influenza, but more information is needed to determine the relative importance of this pathway.",
