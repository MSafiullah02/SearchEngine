The displacement of 125I-ET-1 by ET-I was biphasic. A very high affinity site (ICs0: 35fM) and a high affinity site (IC5o: 0.18 nM) were observed. They represented 75% and 25% respectively, of the total population of ET receptors. Using ET-3 as the cold ligand, a biphasic displacement was also observed (IC50:0.10 nM and 70 nM, each representing about 50% of total binding). Using SX6c, a monophasic curve was observed with one site of low affinity (IC50:>70 nM).

The underlying mechanism is not known but may involve the abnormal immune responses observed in these patients. Chloride (CI) secretion by the human colon epithelium provides the osmotic driving force for fluid secretion into the colon lumen. Under 'normal' conditions this fluid is readily reabsorbed. In secretory states the volume of fluid secreted secondary to CI secretion may exceed the absorptive capacity of the epithelium and diarrhoea results (secretory diarrhoea). Increase in secretion by the colon epithelium is also thought to play a role in the diarrhoeas which occur in inflammatory disease of the colon. In this study we examined tile pathways for CIsecretion in human colon and some aspects of their cellular control.",

Gastric carcinoma is the most common malignancy in China, the fourth most common in Western.Europe and a major cause of cancer morbidity and mortality worldwide. It is well known that metastases, especially distant organ metastases through the blood vascular system, have been the most important cause of patients' death. So far, markers valuable in predicting the metastatic potential of gastric carcinoma have not been identified and the mechanism of metastasis has been unclear. The aim of this study was to determine whether DNA ploidy analysis had any objective value in predicting the metastatic potential of gastric carcinoma to distant organs. DNA ploidy of 57 gastric carcinomas with metastases (12 liver, 1 adrenal, 4 ovary and 48 lymph node) was measured by flow cytometry. DNA aneuploidy was significantly related to liver metastases: 9 out of 12 gastric carcinomas with liver metastases were aneuploid (75%) compared with 13 out of 45 (28.8%) cases without liver metastases (p<0.01); the one gastric carcinoma with adrenal metastasis was also aneuploid. DNA ploidy was not related to ovarian or lymph node metastases. The results suggest that an aneuploid DNA pattern is a predictor of high risk potential for metastases to the liver and may be a useful tool in the \"followup\" of patients with gastric carcinoma in detecting those at high risk of developing metastases following surgical resection. Liver transplantation (OLT) is complicated by acute cellular rejection (ACR) in up to 80% of patients with a peak incidence in the first two weeks following surgery. A diagnosis of ACR is suspected on the basis of an acute deterioration in biochemical liver function, confirmed histologically with liver biopsy and associated with recipient T cell activation. To examine a component of the immunological events associated with ACR we have assessed the changes in T cell surface molecules and T cell activation status following OLT.",

High oestrogen states (pregnancy, the use of the oral contraceptive pill, phases of the menstrual cycle) are associated with hypertension and oedema secondary to salt and water retention. The natriferic steroid aldosterone promotes salt and water retention by activation of the ATP regulated potassium channel (KArp) via a membrane-bound, protein kinase C dependant mechanism and a slower genomic pathway. We investigated whether oestrogens have similar effects.",

The apical membrane was rendered electrically silent by treatment of the mucosal surface with the ionophore nystatin and a mucosa to serosal potassium gradient was established. Under these conditions the S.C.C. is a measure of potassium ion transport across the basolateral KAa. P channel. Subequent addition of the oestrogen B-oestradiol produced a 7.2 + 0.8% increase in S.C.C. (n=5) within 30 min. 17-a-oestradiol was more effective, it produced a 10.2 + 1.2% increase within 30 min (n=4). Addition of chloride ions to the apical membrane of the nystatin treated colon causes cell swelling, this activates a calcium regulated potassium channel (Kc,) and inhibits the KAr r channel. Under these conditions addition of 17-a-oestradiol caused a 7.1 + 1% decrease in S.C.C. after 30 min (n=4). These effects on the KA~ v and the Kca channels were abolished by treating the basolateral membrane with the diuretic amiloride (P< 0.01) or with sodium free Krebs (P<0.01), this suggests that these effects occur due to alkanization of the cell by stimulation of the Na+/H \u00a7 exchanger.",

Apoptosis (a form of programmed cell death) of lymphocytes is an important mode of immune regulation in the mucosal immune system. Apopt0sis also has a critical role in pathologic states including tumour-derived immune suppression, inflammation and acquired immune deficiency syndrome. The only physiological, receptor-mediated mechanism for lymphocyte apoptosis that has been characterized is the Apo-l/ FAS (FAS) receptor-ligand pathway. We have used a partially purified oesophageal tumour-derived factor to demonstrate the presence of a hitherto unrecognised, non-FAS mechanism of apoptosis in mucosal and systemic lymphocytes.

Our study demonstrates a very long delay in diagnosis in some patients and particularly in women of child bearing years with anaemia. _oc.e.j _j_astroen_erO_Ooj July, August, September, 1995 Despite early optimism alpha gliaden antibodies have poor specificity and sensitivity in adult patients with coeliac disease in our area and it appears that endomysial antibody may not be any great improvement. Activated MOs produce 0 2-and TNF, known tumouricidal mediators. TIMs have been reported to demonstrate impaired production of these mediators suggesting that these effector cells are supressed. We postulated that TIM cytotoxicity is not dependent on the release of these cytotoxic agents but is mediated via the release of the enzyme-arginase. Currie et al have demonstrated that arginase is cytotoxic to tumour cells by depletion of the essential amino acid L-arginine, therefore the aim of this study was to determine the role of this enzyme in colorectal tumour-derived MOs. Human peripheral blood monocytes (PBM) were isolated from aged-matched controls (CON) and from blood pre-operatively obtained from patients undergoing surgery for colorectal cancer. Colorectal tumour specimens (5-10gm) were freshly procured and digested. The percentage of TIMS was then assesse d flow cytometrically, and both PBMs and TIMs were seeded at a concentration of 2 x 105/ well. Cytotoxicity was assessed using a standard 51Cr release assay against the SW707 colorectal cell line. TNF, 0 2-generation and cytosolic arginase were also assessed. These results indicate that both PBM and TIMs have impaired production of TNF and O2-, however, cytotoxicity is enhanced above CON and is associated ~,th a paralleled increase in arginase activity. The arginase-dependent nature of this cytotoxicity was confirmed by addition of the inhibitor L-lysine which significantly abrogated cytotoxicity in all groups. These results suggest caution in the use of the arginase substrate Larginine in the management of colorectal cancers.",

Donor derived lymphocytes may exert beneficial immunomodulatory effects in OLT recipients. The highest reported prevalence of coeliac disease is found in the West of Ireland. In this population, an extended major histocompatibility complex relating to coeliac disease has been determined, which includes human leucocyte antigens HLA-A 1 and B8, determined by a single gene on chromosome 6. Secretion of blood group antigens including ABO and Lewis blood groups is determined by a single gene on chromosome 19. A possible increased prevalence of non-secretors amongst the coeliac population has recently been described. Using Lewis (Le) antigen,'phenotype, secretor status can be inferred. Of 112 coeliacs who had either Le(a) or Le(b) antigens, 36 (32%) were non-secretors Le(a+,b-), compared with 27% of 103 disease free controls (p=0.313, odds ratio = 0.703. 95% CI 0.388-1.267). 9% of coeliacs had the recessive Lewis phenotype Le(a-,b-) versus 2% of controls. HLA-A1, B8 and non-secretion of Lewis antigens were unrelated. An increased prevalence of complications and associated autoimmune disease was found in the non-secreting and recessive coeliac groups. The relationship between the non-secretor state and coeliac disease is not confirmed in this study, nor has an increased prevalence of class 1 HLA markers been demonstrated in non-secretors. The finding of an increased prevalence of complications and auto-immune conditions in the recessive and non-secretor groups may prove useful as a predictor of disease severity in coeliac disease.

Several recent reports from other countries suggest that open access upper gastrointestinal endoscopy (O.G.D.) reduces the burden on hospital out patient departments, offers the opportunity of earlier, accurate diagnosis and treatment and allows the family doctor to retain control of patient management. Despite the apparent advantages, a 1992 paper reported that only 10% of U.K. Units offered completely uncensored open access gastroscopy. Suggested factors discouraging the provision of this service included fear of excessive or inappropriate referrals, inadequate referral data and blurring of G.P./Consultant responsibilities. We established an uncensored open access service in 1994 and examined the data for the first year of operation with particular reference to the advantages and disadvantages outlined above. Data was recorded on all patients attending for open access O.G.D. from 1/2/94 to 31/1/95. A comparator group of patients who attended for gastroscopy after consultant out patient assessment during the year immediately prior to the establishment of the open service were also studied.. In the first year of the open access service, the total number of O.G.D.s performed increased by 16% (729 -846). Of the total 244 (29%) were open access. During the year open access as a percentage of total O.G.D.s increased from 22% in the first three months to 33% in the second six months. The mean delay time from referral to open access O.G.D. was 36 days versus 45 days in the comparator group. In the open access group, 64% (157) were referred directly back to the G.P.s versus 28% in the comparator group, 9% (22) of the open access group received O.P.D. appointments versus 57% of the comparators.

Heating resulted in the expression of HSP 72. The PMN were then further divided into two groups, one incubated with medium alone and the other E.Coli (1:25 PMN:E.coli) for 12 hr. Apop was then assessed by Prodidium Iodide DNA staining and Fc~/RIII receptor.These results demonstrate that E.coli induces PMN apop, as indicated by an increase in apop and decrease in Fc'~RIII receptor expression. On pre-exposure to LPS there was a significant reduction in the rate of spontaneous apop. However on heat shocking the PMN there was a significant increase in spontaneous and inducable apop. This indicates that a heat shock response as can occur with pyrexia increases the rate of PMN apop. Therefore, the presence of a pyrexia during the septic state may play an important role in the removal of PMN by apop, thus avoiding tissue injury.",
