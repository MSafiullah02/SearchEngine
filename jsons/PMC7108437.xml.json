Traditionally, its root and rhizome have been used for the treatment of inflammation, cough, tonsillitis and pharyngitis [2]. Recently, it has been used to fight against severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). Many studies found that a variety of compounds such as isoflavonoids [3], [4], [5], quinones [6] and triterpenoids [7], [8], [9] existing in the I. tectorum. Tectoridin, iristectorin B, iristectorin A, tectorigenin and iristectorigenin A (shown in Fig. 1\n), the major isoflavonoid components in I. tectorum, are believed to be responsible for the biological activities of anti-atherosclerosis [10], anti-oxidant [11] and anti-tumor [12].",

It is obvious that medical interest in plants derived drugs has led to an increased need for ideal extraction methods, which could obtain the maximum of the bioactive constituents in a shortest processing time with a low cost. The conventional extraction methods, such as maceration extraction (ME) and soxhlet extraction (SE), which have been employed for decades, need long extraction times and require relatively large quantities of solvent. Ultrasound-assisted extraction (UAE) has been proved to possess abilities of significantly decreasing extraction time and increasing extraction yields in many natural products [13], [14], [15].",

In this study, six different temperatures (15, 25, 35, 45, 55 and 65 \u00b0C) with 70% methanol, were selected to evaluate the influence of temperature on the extraction efficiency and quality of isoflavones from I. tectorum. Other conditions were of 0.5 g sample, solvent to solid ratio: 50 ml/g, ultrasound power: 175 W, extraction time: 30 min, particle size: 40\u201360 mesh. Fig. 4\nshowed the extraction yields of the five isoflavonoids increased with the increase of extraction temperature. The extraction yields of T, ITB, ITA, TN and INA at 45 \u00b0C were 33.12, 3.34, 5.44, 13.59 and 3.31 mg/g, respectively. But the increasing extraction temperature from 45 to 65 \u00b0C, the extraction yields of the dominant components T and TN, TIF in the herb, were not significant (p\n > 0.05). The results are probably because that high temperature can increase the solubility and mass transfer rate of target compounds, which was favorable to extraction. However, some degradation processes may occur at high temperature, and then lower recoveries can be obtained. Finally, 45 \u00b0C was used as the extraction temperature.",

However the differences of the yields of five isoflavones and TIF were not significant (p\n > 0.05) when the time of UAE increased from 45 to 60 min. Because the diffusion front moved towards the interior of the tissues, the diffusion area reduced, diffusion distance increased and the diffusion rate would decrease accordingly [24]. Therefore, there was no obviously observed yields change in the prolonged time periods. Hence, 45 min was chosen as the optimum extraction time.",

The results indicated that the particle size of powder has both positive and negative influence on the yield of extraction. The extraction yields of the isoflavonoids were increased with the particle size decrease. It is because that the higher amount of iso\ufb02avonoids was released as milling destroyed the plant cells, and this amount of iso\ufb02avonoids was extracted easily for direct exposure to the solvent. However, if the particle size were too small, diffusion would be a difficult step in the extraction, which was not valuable for the extraction of bioactive compounds from natural products [25], [26]. Based on these results, the optimum particle size was set at 60\u201380 mesh.",
