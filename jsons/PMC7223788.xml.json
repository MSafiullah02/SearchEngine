Infants with gastroschisis commonly require prolonged parenteral nutrition (PN) due to intestinal ileus and dysmotility, resulting in variable degrees of feeding intolerance [5]. A diagnosis of gastroschisis necessitates surgery and often prolonged postoperative hospital stays. Given the complexity of care and the rising prevalence of gastroschisis, it is imperative to identify interventions that can decrease length of stay (LOS) in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU).",

Exclusive MOM feedings are recommended for all infants for the first 6 months of life, but formula is generally used when MOM is not available [6]. Numerous studies have shown health benefits of MOM over formula for neonates, including improved nutrient absorption, immunological defenses, and maternal-infant bonding [7\u201311]. The association between MOM use and decreased incidence of necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is particularly important in preterm infants, in whom NEC is associated with significant morbidity and mortality [12\u201314]. However, only a limited literature exists investigating the effect of MOM and/or donor human milk feedings on clinical outcomes in infants with gastroschisis. These studies have demonstrated shorter times to full enteral feedings [15] and shorter time to discharge from initiation of enteral feedings [16] with human milk feedings. Reductions in gastroschisis-related NEC have also been associated with exclusive MOM feedings [17].",

The sole inclusion criterion was admission to the Rush NICU with a diagnosis of gastroschisis during the study years. Forty-nine neonates with gastroschisis met these criteria and were evaluated for inclusion in the study. Five of these 49 were excluded (see Fig. 1). Three infants were excluded due to incomplete database as there was inadequate documentation in the paper medical record regarding composition of daily feedings. One infant was excluded due to concern for perinatal asphyxia resulting in transfer of care soon after birth for selective head cooling. Six infants had complex gastroschisis. One of these infants had intestinal obstruction, underwent multiple surgeries, and was ultimately transferred to the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit with liver failure/cholestasis for evaluation for small bowel/liver transplant. This patient was excluded due to complexity of illness. Due to our relatively small cohort, we chose to include the other five infants with complex gastroschisis, although these complex cases exhibit different clinical courses independent of enteral feeding strategy [18, 19]. The study protocol was reviewed and approved by the Institutional Review Board of Rush University Medical Center and requirement for parental consent was waived.",

            "text": "Previous studies have examined the relationship between feeding type and clinical outcomes in infants with gastroschisis and other abdominal wall defects and have reported similar outcomes, although the methodology has varied among studies [15, 16, 22]. Kohler et al. studied 79 infants with simple gastroschisis admitted prior to the institution\u2019s use of donor human milk [23] and divided them into four groups: exclusive MOM, 50\u201399% MOM, 1\u201349% MOM, and all cow\u2019s milk based formula. The investigators found that exclusively MOM-fed infants had a shorter time from initiation of feedings to hospital discharge compared with the other groups [15]. They also reported a significant association between MOM dose as a continuous variable and time from the initiation of feedings to hospital discharge and LOS; however, they did not report hazard ratios.",

Human milk intake (defined as MOM or donor human milk) was determined based on the proportion of days infants received human milk of the days they received any enteral feedings. Gulack et al. found a clear benefit from being fed human milk on 100% of fed days or on 51\u201399% of fed days with a shorter time from initiation of feedings to hospital discharge compared with receiving no human milk. Interestingly, they found that receiving human milk on 1\u201350% of feeding days was associated with a longer time from initiation of feeds to discharge than being fed 0% human milk, which the authors attributed to incomplete adjustment for severity of illness. Specifically, they were unable to adjust for complexity of gastroschisis, which has been shown to impact outcomes in infants with gastroschisis [21].",

Given that the infants with gastroschisis do not receive enteral feedings immediately after birth and are often maintained nil per os for several weeks, their mothers must rely on breast pumps to initiate and maintain lactation. Recent qualitative research demonstrates that these mothers report suboptimal lactation education and support [24]. Many NICUs have developed strategies to improve lactation care for mothers of premature infants. It is equally important to address the unique needs of mothers of infants with surgical conditions.",
