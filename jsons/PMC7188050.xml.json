The high infection rates and the mental stress of trying to stay healthy while providing health care to infected and possibly infected patients pose a challenge to the health workers across the world. Ensuring staff safety and operability is essential to ultimately providing optimal health care to any patients, if afflicted with COVID-19 or not. A bottle neck to overcome in times of such crises is shortages in staffing and possible staff burnout in the face of ever-increasing stresses to the health care system by a pandemic situation such as COVID-19. The need for a coordinated multidisciplinary approach across all medical specialties implicated and essential stake holders is of highest importance to address staffing issues in a pandemic setting as the here discussed article very elegantly demonstrates.3,4",
