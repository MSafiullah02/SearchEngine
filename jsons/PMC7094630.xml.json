            "text": "Bioinorganic chemistry is an interdisciplinary field that draws on disciplines such as biochemistry, inorganic and theoretical chemistry, molecular biology, biophysics and spectroscopy to address the key questions of how metals complement and mediate key biological processes [1]. About 24 elements are currently thought to be essential for mammalian life: H, C, N, O, F, Na, Mg, Si, P, S, Cl, K, Ca, V, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Se, Mo, Sn, I [2], and 14 of them are metals or metalloids. However, this list may not be complete. For example, boron [3] and chromium may turn out to be essential, and it has been suggested that silicon is essential only to prevent aluminum from being toxic [4]. The biological roles of Cr are surrounded by controversy [5]. Currently, Cr(VI) compounds are among 88 recognized (class I) human carcinogens. By contrast, many nutritionists regard Cr(III) as an essential micronutrient, acting as an insulin-mimetic, although this opinion has been disputed. No Cr(III)-dependent biomolecules, such as enzymes or cofactors, have yet been unambiguously described.",

            "text": "Inorganic elements play crucial roles in biological processes, and amongst them, metal ions are essential components in all aspects of the chemistry of living organisms. In biological systems, metal ions exist as electron-deficient cations and, hence, are attracted by electron-rich biomolecules, such as proteins and DNA, thus providing innumerable examples of \u201cnatural ligands\u201d that bind metal ions to perform important biological functions. Metals play diverse roles in almost all biological processes: as catalytic groups at the active sites of enzymes, stabilizing the tertiary structures of proteins and polynucleotides, and as second messengers interacting with a variety of different small molecules and receptors [6]. Although our understanding of the functions and mechanisms of action of metals has increased in the last decades, the mammalian biochemistry of several essential elements is poorly understood. For example, chromium, nickel and tin seem to be essential for life, but we do not know whether there are human genomic codes for them, or how to use them effectively in medicine, yet. For some elements the genetic code involves proteins which recognize specific metal complexes. For example, only one specific cobalt compound, the coenzyme vitamin B12, appears to be essential [7], and in Escherichia coli the molybdate-dependent transcriptional regulator ModE acts as a sensor of intracellular molybdate ([MoO4]2\u2212) concentration and as a regulator for the transcription of several operons that control the uptake and utilization of molybdenum [8]. Zinc is essential for life, and is the second most abundant d-block metal ion in living organisms after iron. It has essentially two possible roles: catalytic or structural. Zinc may also modulate signaling events, as it occurs in processes maintaining zinc homeostasis. An attempt to compile a catalogue of proteins encoded by the human genome, which may require zinc for their physiological functions has been recently reported [9]. Some 10% of the proteins coded by the human genome (the proteome) potentially have zinc-binding sequences. Selenium provides a good example of the importance of speciation: it is an essential element and, yet, some of its compounds are highly toxic (e.g. H2Se). Genes which code for selenium incorporation into amino acids have been characterized [10].",

As indicated in Fig. 1\n, key areas in the design of active compounds are the control of toxicity (side-effects) and targeting of the metal to specific tissues, organs, or cells where activity is needed. Metal ions can be introduced into a biological system either for therapeutic effect or as diagnostic aids. Alternatively, metal ions can be removed from a biological system by judicious use of metal-binding molecules (ligands) [11]. Thus, biomedical inorganic chemistry offers the potential for the design of novel therapeutic and diagnostic agents and for the treatment and understanding of diseases which are currently intractable [12].",

Therefore, the growing interest in understanding the coordination chemistry of biometals, and the development of structure-based drug design of inorganic pharmaceuticals, requires suitable and reliable analytical tools to study the speciation of metal ions in biological systems. In this context, NMR spectroscopy is a powerful and versatile technique that can provide site-specific information about chemical bonding, structure and dynamics in molecular systems. Moreover, NMR spectroscopy is one of the two techniques, the other being X-ray crystallography, that can provide atomic level descriptions of the intermolecular receptor\u2013metal ion interactions responsible for molecular recognition [13]. NMR spectroscopy is being applied to the study of an ever-increasing diversity of biological macromolecules. Advances in the field are allowing detailed structural investigations of proteins, nucleic acids and carbohydrates, including investigations of cells and perfused organs under living conditions, which allows quantification of the dynamic properties of metabolites as well as kinetics of enzymatic reactions at steady state or through real time monitoring [14].",

Unfortunately, for a large number of biologically relevant elements, the only NMR-active isotopes are those with nuclear spins greater than one half.

But as the technology evolves, more nuclei and bond types, and also the solid state, are being brought into the spectroscopist's net. The NMR properties of the nuclei with biological and/or medicinal interest are collected in Table 2\n. Favorable properties for high-resolution NMR spectroscopy are spin quantum number I\n = 1/2 or, for I\n > 1/2, a relatively small value of the nuclear electric quadrupole moment (eQ) and a large value of I, to minimize quadrupolar broadening. Also necessary are a sufficiently large natural abundance (A) and magnetogyric ratio (\u03b3, effectively the ratio of the magnetic moment to the spin quantum number), to which the NMR frequency is proportional. The intrinsic NMR receptivity, which is a measure of the intensity of signal, increases as |\u03b3\n3|AI(I\n + 1). Thus, larger values of I are more favorable, by a factor of 33 from I\n = 1/2 to 9/2. Transition metal nuclei with natural abundance below 5% that may be usefully studied with enrichment are 57Fe, 61Ni, 67Zn and 187Os.",

Therefore, the nuclear energy levels depend on both the EFG and the magnetic field. In the liquid phase, rapid and isotropic molecular tumbling averages the quadrupolar (as well as the dipolar) interactions; but the relaxation of the electric quadrupole with fluctuations of the EFG (e.g. in molecular collisions) relaxes the nuclear spin as well, and fast relaxation leads to uncertainty over the line position, i.e. quadrupolar broadening. The quadrupolar relaxation rate and the line-width are proportional to \u03c7\n2(1 + \n\u03b7\n2/3)(2I\n + 3)/I\n2(2I\n \u2212 1) (where \u03b7 is the asymmetry parameter of the EFG, maximally equal to 1, and 0 for axial symmetry) and also to the rotational correlation time for isotropic tumbling (\u03c4\nc\n = 4\u03c0\u03b7\n0\nr\n3/3k\nB\nT, where \u03b7\n0 is the viscosity of the medium and r is the molecular radius). Thus, the quadrupolar broadening increases sharply with increase in Q and in the EFG q.

This is particularly true in environments where ionic motion is restricted, such as in biological systems. In general, quadrupolar nuclei display broad resonances in NMR spectra, unless they are in highly symmetric electrical environments, which reduce the magnitude of the electric field gradients at the nuclei (extreme narrowing conditions). Biological macromolecules which introduce high electric field gradients, in conjunction with non-averaging motional characteristics, can make quadrupolar interaction effective. However, the binding of quadrupolar metal ions can be studied by NMR spectroscopy, potentially even in cells. This is possible because the binding of metal ions to a biomolecule can cause a substantial increase in the effective correlation time (\u03c4\nc), thus leading to a measurable change in relaxation behavior of the ions.",

As brain Li cannot be monitored readily at present, it is a common practice to measure the concentration of the ions in the serum where repeated measurements can be made inexpensively. Moreover, because of the sedative and possible neurotoxic side-effects of lithium, it is important to monitor and maintain the lithium concentration within the safe therapeutic range by measuring Li+ concentrations in serum or plasma. Although plasma lithium values are used to monitor the therapy, the lithium in red blood cells may be a better predictor of Li+ concentrations in the brain than serum levels [28]. 7Li NMR spectroscopy is a valuable analytical tool to quantify Li in whole blood, plasma, or RBCs. In a recent study [29], male Sprague\u2013Dawley rats were treated with different amounts of Li2CO3; 24 h after drug administration, blood was drawn from the rats via cardiac puncture, and aliquots, mixed with a known amount of anticoagulant (citrate phosphate dextrose) and 20 mg of a shift reagent ([Tm(DOTP)]5\u2212, thulium(III)-1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-1,4,7,10-tetrakis(methylenephosphonate)), 7Li NMR provided a clear discrimination between plasma and RBC lithium signals. The 7Li spectrum (obtained in 30 min) in Fig. 2\nshows two peaks \u223c13 ppm apart corresponding to plasma (extracellular) and RBC (intracellular) lithium. Quantification of lithium was achieved by comparing peak intensities with standards prepared using blood from untreated rats, and the results showed excellent agreement (less than 0.1% average difference) with other commonly employed techniques, confirming that 7Li NMR spectroscopy has the potential to become routine for lithium analysis. Moreover, this technique has the advantage of reduced pre-analytical preparation time and small blood samples with lithium concentration in the neighborhood of 0.08 mequiv. L\u22121 can be measured with high accuracy and reproducibility needed for clinical purposes.",

In several diseases or pathological states (hypertension, cystic fibrosis, oncogenesis, infected cells) a change in this equilibrium occurs due to abnormalities in ion-binding sites or in transport processes across the membrane. Sodium relaxation studies can provide qualitative information on the interaction of Na+ ions with molecules [32]. NMR relaxation techniques are able to discriminate between different adjacent sodium ion compartments, whether or not they are physically separated, as long as they display different molecular motions and, thus, induce different relaxation characteristics. The use of multiple echoes to provide relaxation information has greatly increased the usefulness of 23Na NMR spectroscopy, and the use of paramagnetic shift reagents or contrast reagents allows the differentiation of intra- and extracellular sodium pools, but toxicity of the currently available shift reagents may be problematic. In instances where toxicity is not a severe problem, shift reagents have been used to monitor fluid dynamics as well as to distinguish different sodium pools, and this method has been mostly applied to cell suspensions, kidney tubules, glands and small organs [33]. For example, the shift reagent dysprosium(III)-tripolyphosphate ([Dy(PPP)2]7\u2212) was used in experiments with sequential frequency-selective radiofrequency pulses to excite selectively the well-resolved resonances of shifted and unshifted sodium and produce separate images of the different sodium pools. This technique depends on the complete resolution of the sodium resonances and requires separate experiments for each sodium species. The less toxic shift reagents dysprosium(III)-triethylenetetraminehexaacetate ([Dy(TTHA)]3\u2212) and [Tm(DOTP)]5\u2212 have also been employed, but they do not produce fully resolved intracellular and extracellular sodium resonances. Nonetheless, these experiments allowed the simultaneous generation of separate images of the intracellular and extracellular sodium pools, and, therefore, the direct monitoring of the movement of sodium on a regional basis.",

Fig. 3a shows 23Na NMR spectra for 0.80 M Na2(5\u2032-GMP) in an aqueous solution at pH 8. The signal centered at 0 ppm exhibits a bi-Lorentzian line-shape, which is due to a slow exchange of Na+ cations between phosphate-bound and free states. The small peak at \u221217 ppm is due to the Na+ cations residing inside the 5\u2032-GMP channel. The signal intensity for the channel Na+ cations decreases as the sample temperature is increased from 278 to 308 K, an indication of \u201cmelting\u201d of the 5\u2032-GMP aggregates. Analogously (b), 23Na NMR spectra of d(TG4T) show the channel Na+ signal at \u221217 ppm but, in this case, the total integrated area for this signal remains approximately unchanged between 278 and 293 K, indicating that the G-quadruplex structure of d(TG4T) does not melt at 293 K. These findings open up many new possibilities in the study of cation binding and transport dynamics in G-quadruplex DNA. For example, it might now be possible not only to monitor cation transport through a G-quadruplex channel, but also to measure cation-binding affinity for the channel site in a direct and site-specific manner.",

It is known that the kinetic properties of K+ and Rb+ with respect to Na+/K+-ATPase are similar for cardiac and skeletal muscles, nerves, RBCs, human erythrocytes, cardiomyocytes and other tissues, and the equilibrium transmembrane Rb+ gradient is similar to that of K+\n[45]. This implies similar ion selectivity of the systems transferring these ions inside and outside cells, thus supporting the role of Rb+ as a mimic for K+. Rb+ uptake rates determined by 87Rb NMR spectroscopy (Fig. 6\n) are similar to those measured with atomic emission spectroscopy (AES), allowing estimates of K+ influx rates, which are comparable to those obtained with radioisotope tracers. The method does not require shift reagents because of the 8.5 times faster kinetics of Rb+ equilibration in the extracellular space compared with the intracellular space and the much higher concentration of Rb+ in the latter. Under normal physiological conditions, Rb+ influx occurs mainly through Na+/K+-ATPase, whereas the contribution of the Na+/K+/2Cl\u2212 cotransporter and K+ channels to Rb+ influx is small.

As a congener of K+, it accumulates in the intracellular space, primarily through the action of Na+/K+-ATPase. A unique observation on the NMR behavior of Cs+ is the resolution of intra- and extracellular 133Cs NMR resonances in Cs+-loaded cell suspensions in the absence of shift reagents. The NMR chemical shift range of 133Cs is much larger than that of other alkali metal nuclei, and it is extremely sensitive to changes in chemical environment, solvents, temperature, and counter-ions present [50]. 133Cs has a nuclear spin I\n = 7/2, a small quadrupole moment (giving rise to narrow NMR lines), and a relaxation rate approximately 200 times smaller than those of the other NMR detectable alkali metal nuclei.

This compartmental resolution applies not only to the intra- and extracellular spaces, but to subcellular compartments as well.

Investigations of Cs+ binding for RBCs using spin\u2013lattice (T\n1) and spin\u2013spin (T\n2) 133Cs NMR relaxation measurements have shown that Cs+ binds more strongly to 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate (BPG) and RBC membranes than to any other intracellular component in RBCs at physiological concentrations.",

The NMR properties of 43Ca are unfavorable due to its low resonance frequency, low natural abundance (0.145%), and the fact that magnetic relaxation is dominated by the quadrupole relaxation, thus explaining the paucity of data available. Nevertheless, 43Ca NMR has provided a few insights into the structural and motional characteristics of calcium-binding sites in a number of calcium-binding proteins [65]. In general it is extremely difficult to observe directly NMR signals from quadrupolar ions bound to proteins. If there is a reasonably fast chemical exchange of ions between the bulk solution and the protein-binding sites valuable information about the ion binding can be obtained. For example, the 43Ca NMR signals from Ca2+ ions bound to the Ca-binding proteins parvalbumin, troponin-c and calmodulin have been observed [66]. The observation was made possible through the use of isotopically enriched 43Ca2+. The chemical shift of 43Ca2+ ion bound to the three proteins is ca. +60 ppm (relative to free Ca2+ ions in aqueous solution), and all have a similar magnitude of the quadrupole coupling constant. This observation supports the argument that the Ca2+-binding sites in these proteins have the same arrangements of oxygen ligands coordinated to the Ca2+ ion. A similar study has been carried out to evaluate the exchange rates and the binding constants of Ca2+ ions to the high-affinity and low-affinity binding sites on calmodulin [67]. The temperature dependence of the 43Ca NMR signals showed that the two classes of sites have exchange rates differing by a factor of about 40 at room temperature. At temperatures \u226430 \u00b0C, only the two sites with fast exchange (i.e. the low-affinity sites) were probed by 43Ca NMR.",

This resonance corresponds to calcium bound to the single high-affinity calcium site in this protein. In the presence of excess metal ion, a sharp signal (\u0394\u03bd\n1/2\n = 10 Hz) is also observed at l ppm, in the vicinity of free calcium. All proteins were found to contain one high-affinity calcium-binding site. The chemical shifts, line-widths, relaxation times, and quadrupolar coupling constants for the respective 43Ca NMR signals were quite similar; this is indicative of a high degree of homology between the strong calcium-binding sites of these four proteins. The measured chemical shifts (\u03b4\n = \u22123 to \u22127 ppm) and quadrupolar coupling constants (\u03c7\n = 0.7\u20130.8 MHz) are quite distinct from those observed for typical EF-hand calcium-binding proteins, suggesting a different geometry for the calcium-binding loops. The correlation times for bound calcium ions in these proteins are in the range of 4\u20138 ns, indicating that the flexibilities of these binding sites are limited.

The main medicinal application of boron is the tumor-targeted delivery of boron derivatives for boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT) [69]. This therapy is based on the nuclear reaction that occurs when 10B, a stable isotope, is irradiated with neutrons of the appropriate energy to produce 11B in an unstable form, which then undergoes instantaneous nuclear fission to produce high-energy alpha particles and recoiling 7Li nuclei (10B + nth\n \u2192 [11B] \u2192 \u03b1 + \n7Li). These heavy charged particles have pathlengths of approximately one cell diameter (10\u201314 \u03bcm) and deposit most of their energy within the boron-containing cells. If enough low-energy thermal neutrons (nth) reach the treatment volume, and 10B is selectively delivered to tumor cells in amounts higher than in the surrounding normal tissues, then they can be destroyed as a result of the 10B(n,\u03b1)7Li capture reaction that causes local tumor cell necrosis. In theory, BNCT provides a means for the specific molecular and cellular targeting of high linear energy transfer radiation to tumor cells with the concomitant sparing of normal cells. BNCT has been used clinically to treat patients with brain cancers, such as glioblastoma multiforme, with high-grade gliomas, and a much smaller number with primary and metastatic melanoma. Delivery vehicles synthesized for this application include sodium borocaptate (BSH, Na2B12H11SH), boranophosphonates and boranobis(phosphonates), and boranophosphate-oligodeoxynucleotides, in which BH3 is linked to the phosphate backbone of antisense oligodeoxynucleotides [70].",

An 11B NMR study on this MeOSuc-Ala-Ala-Pro-boroPhe-histidine adduct complex and on two other complexes known to be serine adducts (namely \u03b1-lytic protease with MeOSuc-Ala-Ala-Pro-boroVal and chymotrypsin with MeOSucAla-Ala-Pro-boroPh) showed, in all cases, resonances at ca. \u221216.6 ppm, demonstrating that the boron atom is tetrahedral in both the histidine and serine adduct (trigonal boron species are reported to resonate at around 0 ppm) [72].",

The 12 boron nuclei of BSH can be classified into four groups, each showing a well-defined chemical shift (Fig. 9\n). Covalent binding of BSH to a large protein changes the chemical environment around the 11B nuclei causing changes in both the chemical shifts (the formation of a disulfide bridge between BSH and serum albumin moves the 11B chemical shift of the S-attached boron atom, labeled as B1 in Fig. 9, ca. 3 ppm downfield) and the relaxation rates of the quadrupolar nuclei. However, the observation of no chemical shift change under the employed experimental conditions, the measured values of relaxation rates, and the calculated binding parameters indicated a non-covalent binding between BSH and serum albumin (bovine, human or dog). The nature of this interaction may, in part, be electrostatic. Bound and free BSH are in fast exchange at temperatures between 295 and 310 K, and the number of BSH-binding sites on these proteins is about 3\u20135.",

Ionic interactions with the surface of the cytochrome are believed to play a significant role in the direction of the interaction between the cytochrome and the enzymatic aggregates, cytochrome reductase and oxidase, thus influencing the efficiency of electron transfer [74]. Cytochrome-c is known to bind small anions, including metabolites such as phosphate ions and ATP. This interaction affects the mobility of the electron carrier protein and has been interpreted as an extra role for the protein as an ion carrier. The binding of borate ion to cytochrome's surface has been studied by 11B NMR [75]. Fig. 10a shows the 11B spectrum at 11.4 T of a 100 mM borate solution with 4 mM ferricytochrome-c at pH 9.7 and 5 \u00b0C. The large peak at 7.1 ppm (peak z) has the same shift as that of the weighted average of 70% B(OH)4\n\u2212 exchanging with 30% of B(OH)3. The peaks at 2.1 (peak y) and 1.8 (peak x) ppm are assigned to B(OH)4\n\u2212 specifically bound to two conformations of ferricytochrome-c that are present at pH 9.7 [76]. The assignment is based on the chemical shift which is similar to that of free B(OH)4\n\u2212 (2.0 ppm), and the narrow line-width of 14 Hz which is consistent with the tetrahedral symmetry of this species [76]. The peak at around 6 ppm (peak w) in Fig. 10a is presently unassigned. A multiple quantum filtered (MQF) NMR experiment yields a spectrum with three peaks (b), two at the specific binding site at around 2 ppm and one at the chemical shift of the borate/boric acid bulk peak at 7.1 ppm, suggesting two different types of binding sites designated as I (for slowly exchanging borate ion) and II (for fast exchanging borate ion and boric acid), respectively. Thus, detection of binding by MQF NMR experiments proved to be sensitive to fast exchanging ligands as well as to very weak binding that could not be detected using conventional single-quantum methods.",

It is a non-essential element that during the last three decades has been recognized as a potentially toxic element linked to neurological problems, especially dialysis encephalopathy, and possibly Alzheimer's disease, and also to some bone disorders and problems in the hematopoietic system, muscles and joints [77]. The normal blood plasma aluminum concentration is about 0.005 mg L\u22121. Blood contains less than 1% of the aluminum body burden, of which about 80% is bound to proteins. It accumulates mainly in the liver, bones and spleen of humans and animals. Because of its low solubility in solution under neutral conditions, Al was regarded as a non-toxic element and its environmental and biological effects were not investigated until recently. But due to the increasing acidity of the environment and concomitant dissolution of aluminum minerals, the concentration of this element in fresh waters can increase considerably. On the other hand, aluminum-based drugs are sold as antacids ([Al(OH)3], [Al2(CO3)3]) and in the treatment of malaria ([Al(OH)3]). Three aluminum salts (alum, [Al(OH)3], [Al(PO4)]) have been also added to many vaccines, including widely used formulations for diphtheria, hepatitis B and tetanus, as adjuvant (\u201cvaccine boosters\u201d) [78]. Moreover, the magnetic resonance characteristics of this nuclide also make it suitable for medical applications (27Al-based MRI is feasible) [79].",

Another attractive feature of this nucleus is the relatively small quadrupole moment associated with its high nuclear spin (I\n = 5/2). These two favorable factors result in a much higher relative peak height (by one order of magnitude or more compared to the other elements of Group 13). This means that sufficient signal-to-noise ratios can be obtained even with dilute (\u223c0.01 M) solutions of aluminum compounds. 27Al line-widths may vary from 3 Hz to several kHz, and the signal may even completely vanish into the baseline noise in some instances. This negative aspect of quadrupolar relaxation is counterbalanced by the additional information obtained concerning molecular symmetries from the magnitude of quadrupolar line-broadenings.

            "text": "The major metal transport protein in blood plasma is the bilobal glycoprotein transferrin. Transferrin is too big for complete structural determination in solution by current multidimensional NMR techniques (1H NMR signals are intrinsically broad due to slow molecular tumbling), but 27Al NMR can be used to investigate directly the metals in their specific binding sites and to reveal subtle inter-site differences [80]. Human serum transferrin (Fig. 11\n) is the protein that transports Fe3+ ions and it is a member of a small group of monomeric non-heme proteins (MW \u223c76\u201381 kDa), which includes lactoferrin, ovotransferrin and melanotransferrin. It has two binding sites for ferric ions (these are found in a six-coordinate, distorted octahedral coordination geometry) which are identified as C-terminal and N-terminal sites. Two tyrosines, one histidine and one aspartate constitute four protein ligands for the metal ion, which requires a synergistic anion for the formation of stable transferrin complexes. In vivo bidentate CO3\n2\u2212 serves this purpose by coordinating directly to the metal in the fifth and sixth coordination positions. Since serum transferrin is normally only about 30% saturated with iron, it retains a relatively high capacity for binding to other metal ions. Vogel and Aramini demonstrated the feasibility of using 27Al NMR to probe the binding of Al3+ to ovotransferrin and its half-molecules in the presence of carbonate or oxalate as synergistic anions [81]. The ovotransferrin-bound 27Al NMR signals have some rather unusual properties characteristic of quadrupolar nuclei bound in slow exchange to large macromolecules far from extreme narrowing conditions. First, the maximum intensity of the protein-bound 27Al signal is substantially lower than that observed for equimolar solutions of the free metal ion. Second, the signals exhibit a unique pulse angle dependence where a maximum in peak intensity is attained at pulse lengths that are less than half the 90\u00b0 pulse for an aqueous Al3+ solution. Third, 27Al signals for Al3+ bound to the half-molecules of ovotransferrin are much broader than those for the intact protein, reflecting the importance of molecular motion on the detectability of quadrupolar nuclei. Fourth, an increase in the external magnetic field strength causes line narrowing and a 2\u20134 ppm downfield dynamic frequency shift (Fig. 12\n) [82]. These data are all consistent with the idea that only the central (1/2 \u2192 \u22121/2) transition of the 27Al nucleus is observed. The chemical shifts of the 27Al signals from Al2-ovotransferrin were found to be within the range +40 to \u221246 ppm, which is in accordance with a six-coordinate (octahedral) Al complex. From these assignments and titration experiments it was found that in the presence of carbonate the N-terminal site of ovotransferrin binds Al3+ with a higher affinity than does the C-site. However, changing the synergistic anion to oxalate alters the specificity (Fig. 13\n) [81].",

It is soluble in water, and tris complexes of Al3+ with this ligand are toxic and cause brain disease.

It has two naturally occurring isotopes (69Ga, 60.4%; 71Ga, 39.6%) and 13 radioactive nuclides. 67Ga (\u03b3, t\n1/2\n = 3.25 days) and 68Ga (\u03b2+, t\n1/2\n = 68 min) are two radioisotopes with appropriate energies and half-lives for \u03b3-scintigraphy and positron emission tomography (PET), respectively. As well as imaging applications, the Auger electrons emitted by 67Ga possess potent cytotoxicity pointing towards potential therapeutic applications of the radionuclide, while the positrons emitted by 68Ga may also have therapeutic applications in the prevention of restenosis by intracoronary radiation therapy [86]. Although most reports of gallium pharmaceutical chemistry concern applications of its radioisotopes, the tumor-seeking and antineoplastic properties of Ga3+ were recognized 30 years ago. The safety and activity of simple gallium salts, mainly intravenous gallium nitrate, have been extensively studied in clinical trials since 1975 [87]. Development of anticancer gallium complexes has been pursued as a strategy to circumvent the limitations faced with simple gallium salts. In particular, efforts to improve the bioavailability of gallium via the oral route have recently led to the selection of the complexes tris(8-quinolinolato)gallium(III) (KP46) [88] and tris(3-hydroxy-2-methyl-4H-pyran-4-onato)gallium(III) (gallium maltolate) [89] for clinical studies.",

Because of its similarity to the alkali metal ions, Tl+ has potential as a probe for Na+ and K+ in biological systems. Like 27Al, 205Tl NMR can be used to investigate directly the specific binding sites of transferrins. Due to its high receptivity, 205Tl NMR signals of protein-bound Tl ions can be observed even at mM concentrations. The first 205Tl NMR study of human serum transferrin was reported over 20 years ago by Bertini et al. [93]. These authors showed that 205Tl NMR is a convenient probe to monitor the occupancy of the two available transferrins and characterized the dithallium(III)-transferrin and the monothallium derivatives with bicarbonate as synergistic ion. The high affinity of the protein for trivalent metal ions was thought to be responsible for the stabilization of the 3+ oxidation state of the metal. Two distinct 205Tl NMR signals (at +2075 and +2055 ppm downfield from an aqueous solution of Tl+ at infinite dilution) of similar shape were found for the (Tl(III))2-transferrin derivative at physiological pH. The two signals are relatively broad (\u0394\u03bd\n1/2\n \u2248 100 Hz) and show a different pH dependence (the signal at +2055 ppm was shown to be more resistant to acidification). At physiological pH the Tl3+ ion was shown to bind sequentially to the two sites; the signal at +2055 ppm appeared first and was assigned to Tl3+ bound to the acid-resistant C-terminal site. The signal at +2075 ppm was assigned to Tl3+ bound to the N-terminal site. Using 13C NMR spectroscopy to study the 205Tl\u2013transferrin\u201313CO3 derivative, the same group showed that the 13C nucleus of the synergistic anion is strongly magnetically coupled to the 205Tl nucleus so that its 13C signal is split into a doublet. So, the 13C NMR spectrum of 205Tl2\u2013transferrin\u2013(13CO3)2 would originate from the superposition of two doublets, the extent of the coupling constants (290 and 265 Hz) being typical of a 2\nJ(205Tl\u201313C) coupling. This result constituted evidence of carbonate coordination to the metal [94]. Similar experiments were carried out by Aramini and Vogel to investigate the binding of 205Tl to chicken ovotransferrin in the presence of carbonate as the synergistic anion [95]. Two 205Tl NMR signals due to the bound metal ion in the two high-affinity iron-binding sites of the protein where detected, and, from titration studies, it was demonstrated that Tl3+ shows no site preference in ovotransferrin. Again, when 13C-labelled carbonate was used, two closely spaced doublets in the carbonyl region of the 13C NMR spectrum of ovotransferrin were recorded due to spin\u2013spin coupling between the bound metal ion and carbonate (ranging from 2\nJ(205Tl\u201313C) = 270 to 290 Hz).",

Pyruvate kinase from almost all sources requires monovalent and divalent metal ions. Potassium is the physiologically important cation, but numerous 1+ cations, including Tl+, can activate this enzyme. TlNO3 activates pyruvate kinase to 80\u201390% activity compared to KCl in the presence of Mn(NO3)2 as the activating 2+ cation. At higher concentrations of Tl+, enzyme inhibition is observed, and the extent of this inhibition is dependent on the nature and concentration of the divalent cation. The effect of Mn2+ on the 1/T\n1 and 1/T\n2 values of 205Tl+ in the presence of yeast pyruvate kinase was determined by 205Tl NMR spectroscopy. The temperature dependence of the relaxation rates indicates that fast exchange conditions prevail for 205Tl+ longitudinal relaxation rates. The distance between Tl+ and Mn2+ at the active site of yeast pyruvate kinase was calculated from the paramagnetic contribution of Mn2+ to the longitudinal relaxation rates of Tl+ bound to yeast pyruvate kinase. 205Tl+ NMR spectroscopy has been also used to monitor possible structural alterations introduced at the active site of yeast pyruvate kinase by mutation of Thr298 [97]. The Tl+\u2013Mn2+ distances at the active site of yeast pyruvate kinase have been calculated from the paramagnetic contribution of Mn2+ to the longitudinal relaxation rates of 205Tl+ bound to several complexes of the Thr298 mutants and to wild type yeast pyruvate kinase. The primary results of these studies demonstrated that mutations of Thr298 in yeast pyruvate kinase result in changes in the interactions between the monovalent cation and the divalent cation. These cations interact with the phosphoryl group of the substrate at the active site of the enzyme.",

            "text": "The merits of tin NMR in assessing structural characteristics of organotin compounds (e.g. substitution pattern on tin, coordination number, influence of solvent) were recognized in the early 1970s. This is because of the reasonably favorable magnetic properties of tin nuclei. Tin has no less than 10 natural isotopes, among which three have non-zero spin, all I\n = 1/2. Among these, 115Sn is the least NMR favorable isotope, because of its extremely low natural abundance (0.35%). As a result, it has only rarely been studied, e.g. to overcome difficulties in unraveling strongly coupled homonuclear n\nJ(119Sn\u2013119Sn) scalar coupling satellites in ditin compounds [105]. The \u201ctwins\u201d 117Sn and 119Sn nuclei have rather similar properties, but 119Sn NMR spectroscopy is, nevertheless, by far the most widely used in tin chemistry because of both its slightly higher magnetic moment and natural abundance. Thus, not surprisingly, the use of NMR in tin chemistry has been abundantly reviewed (e.g.\n[106]). The use of 117/119Sn NMR spectroscopy to investigate the interaction between organotin complexes and biomolecules such as amino acids, peptides, carbohydrates, nucleic acids, and DNA, has been recently and extensively reviewed, including equilibrium, structural and biological studies [107], and will not be further discussed in this paper.",

            "text": "The toxicological properties of lead have spurred a number of investigations into the interactions of this metal ion with various proteins [113]. For example, Pb2+ can bind very tightly to, and even displace Ca2+ from, calmodulin, calbindin and troponin-c. Moreover, Pb2+ can substitute Ca2+ in the activation of several enzymes, including protein kinase-c, phosphodiesterase, and myosin light chain kinase, the latter two in a calmodulin-dependent manner. Therefore, model systems are needed for lead bound to Ca-binding sites in proteins, as these interactions are thought to account for lead's toxicity. For example, the high-affinity Ca2+-binding sites of carp (pI 4.25) and pike (pI 5.0) parvalbumins, as well as those of mammalian calmodulin and its C-terminal tryptic half-molecule (TR2C), have been investigated by 207Pb NMR spectroscopy [114]. For the parvalbumins, two 207Pb signals are observed ranging in chemical shift from +750 to +1260 ppm downfield of aqueous [Pb(NO3)2], corresponding to 207Pb2+ bound to the two high-affinity helix\u2013loop\u2013helix Ca2+-binding sites in each of these proteins. Four 207Pb signals, which fall in the same chemical shift window, can be discerned for calmodulin (Fig. 14\n). Experiments on TR2C allowed the assignment of each signal as due to 207Pb2+ occupying a helix\u2013loop\u2013helix site in either the N- or the C-lobe of the intact protein (Fig. 14). 207Pb and 1H NMR titration studies on calmodulin have provided evidence that Pb2+ binding to all four sites occurs simultaneously, in contrast to the behavior of this protein in the presence of Ca2+. The large chemical shift dispersion observed for the 207Pb signals of the three investigated proteins illustrates the remarkable sensitivity of this parameter to subtle differences in the chemical environment of the protein-bound 207Pb nucleus.",

Despite these desirable qualities, 45Sc NMR spectroscopy has scarcely been employed in biological studies of scandium complexes to date. As already shown for 27Al (see Section 3.3.2), 45Sc NMR can be used to probe the metal-binding sites in large proteins. The solution chemistry of scandium is based entirely on Sc3+, which almost exclusively forms six-coordinate complexes. This makes Sc3+, whose ionic radius is slightly larger than that of Fe3+ (0.75 \u00c5 vs. 0.65 \u00c5), a suitable probe for the Fe3+-binding sites of transferrins in which the metal ion is coordinated by six donor atoms, four from the side-chains of four protein residues and two from the synergistic anion (i.e. carbonate), in a distorted octahedral geometry. For example, the binding of Sc3+ to chicken ovotransferrin has been investigated by 45Sc and 13C NMR spectroscopy [82c]. In the presence of carbonate, two 45Sc and 13C signals were detected which were assigned using the proteolytic half-molecules of ovotransferrin to bound Sc3+ and 13CO3\n2\u2212 in both metal ion-binding sites of the protein (Fig. 16\n). Several properties of the transferrin-bound 45Sc signals, such as their dependence on pulse length, magnetic field, protein size, and temperature, are consistent with the detection of only the central (m\n = 1/2 \u2192 \u22121/2) transition of the quadrupolar nucleus under far from extreme narrowing conditions. From 45Sc chemical shift and line-width data for the Sc3+/carbonate form of ovotransferrin at four magnetic fields, the values of the quadrupolar coupling constant (\u03c7) and rotational correlation time (\u03c4\nc) have been calculated for the bound metal ion in each site of the protein. This work represented the first 45Sc NMR study of a metalloprotein and is another example of the feasibility of quadrupolar metal ion NMR spectroscopy to investigate metal ion-binding sites in large proteins.",

Two Ti(IV) derivatives (budotitane and titanocene dichloride) have been investigated as potential metallotherapeutic drugs [128]. In particular, titanocene dichloride, [TiCl2Cp2], entered phase I clinical trials in 1993. In contrast to the pre-clinical studies, where hepatic or liver toxicity was the dose-limiting side-effect, nephrotoxicity was identified as the dose-limiting side-effect along with hypoglycemia, nausea, reversible metallic taste immediately after administration and pain during infusion. However, the absence of any effect on proliferative activity of the bone marrow, which is the usual dose-limiting side-effect of organic drugs, was a very promising result that suggested titanocene dichloride may have significant potential for possible use in combination therapy. Two phase II clinical trials involving patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma and breast metastatic carcinoma have been reported. However, the results using titanocene dichloride as a single agent in chemotherapy were not sufficiently promising against other treatment regimes to warrant further studies, and titanocene dichloride has been discontinued from further clinical trials [129].",

Vanadium complexes readily undergo redox reactions under physiological conditions, and forms both cationic and anionic complexes in the pH range likely to be encountered physiologically (pH 2\u20138).

Several vanadium salts and their complexes have shown insulin-mimetic pharmacological properties, including stimulation of glucose transport into cells and its oxidation via glycolysis, glycogen synthesis and lipogenesis, as well as inhibition of gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis. These antidiabetic properties of vanadium compounds, which have been demonstrated by in vitro, in vivo and clinical studies, have attracted much interest as potential therapeutic agents for diabetes mellitus.

Several vanadium complexes with organic ligands were found to be more potent and less toxic than vanadium salts, likely owing to an increase in selectivity. Peroxovanadium compounds were found to increase effectiveness, possibly because these compounds can inhibit PTPases irreversibly by oxidation. Additionally, the oxidative ability of peroxovanadate complexes strongly depends on the ligand. Most peroxovanadates are hydrolytically unstable; thus, an appropriate ligand should minimize hydrogen peroxide decomposition in aqueous solution while improving selectivity, such that potency is high and toxicity is low. Speciation studies of vanadium with hydrogen peroxide and a variety of ligands are required to gain information about the insulin-enhancing character of vanadium and to find the most suitable ligand for the treatment of diabetes [135].

An example of the suitability of this technique is illustrated in Fig. 17\n, in which the variable pH 51V NMR spectra of a solution of [VIVO(maltolato)2] and of genuine [VVO2(maltolate)2]\u2212 are reported. As shown in Fig. 17a, in basic solution only one peak (V1, \u2212537 ppm) assigned to mixed protonation states of vanadate was recorded. As the pH was lowered, peaks V2 ([VVO2(maltolate)2]\u2212) and V3 ([VVO2(maltolate)(OH)(H2O)]\u2212) appeared at \u2212496 and \u2212510 ppm, respectively. As the acidity of the solution was increased, peak V1 shifted to \u2212560 ppm and disappeared below pH 5.5. No spectra could be observed below pH 2. By comparison with the variable pH 51V NMR spectra of NH4[VVO2(maltolate)2] (Fig. 17b), these results proved that some V(V) complexes form in a solution of [VIVO(maltolato)2], even under relatively acidic conditions. The mechanism for the formation of these vanadate complexes is by oxidation of [VIVO(maltolato)2] with O2 to form ([VVO2(maltolate)2]\u2212 and subsequently vanadate oligomers [136].",

Even mild dietary deficiency of chromium is sometimes associated with a medical condition known as Syndrome X, a constellation of symptoms, including hyperinsulinemia, high blood pressure, high triglyceride levels, high blood sugar levels, and low HDL cholesterol levels, that increase the risk of heart disease. Recent research has revealed that the chromium-binding oligopeptide chromodulin may play a role in the autoamplification of insulin signaling. Attempts to develop chromium-containing nutritional supplements and therapeutics have been made [142]. In anything other than trace amounts, chromium compounds should be regarded as highly toxic. The health effects of chromium are at least partially related to the oxidation state of the metal at the time of exposure. Cr(III) and Cr(VI) compounds are thought to be the most biologically significant. Cr(VI) is generally considered much more toxic than Cr(III), and prolonged exposure to Cr(VI) has been associated with increased incidence of lung cancer.",

Manganese can exist in 11 oxidation states (from +7 to \u22123), more than any other element, but the aqueous chemistry of manganese is dominated by Mn(II) complexes. Both Mn(II) and Mn(III) are found in enzymes. The ionic radius of 0.9 \u00c5 places Mn2+ in between that of Mg2+ and Ca2+, so it is not surprising that there is overlap in function with these two ions in providing structural charge stabilization of enzymes and, in some cases, substrates such as Mn-ATP. In this regard, manganese has been useful in substitutions of Mg2+ and Ca2+ as a handle for NMR and EPR spectroscopic probes of active site architecture and catalysis [148]. Manganese also acts as a superacid catalyst in several hydrolytic enzyme-catalyzed reactions [149]. The classes of enzymes that have manganese cofactors are very broad and include oxidoreductases, transferases, hydrolases, lyases, isomerases, ligases, lectins, and integrins. The Mn-superoxide dismutase enzyme is probably one of the most ancient, as nearly all organisms living in the presence of oxygen use it to deal with the toxic effects of superoxide, formed by the one-electron reduction of dioxygen [150]. In addition to its important biological role, manganese may have several therapeutic uses, including the treatment of arthritis, cancer, cardiovascular diseases, and HIV [151].",

The 99Tc nuclide is extremely convenient for NMR spectroscopy due to its high receptivity and natural abundance.

            "text": "Iron is the fourth most abundant element in the Earth's crust, but only a trace element in biological systems, making up only 0.004% of the body's mass. Yet, it is an essential component or cofactor of numerous metabolic reactions. Every living cell in both plants and animals contains iron. Approximately two thirds of this iron (70%) in man is contained in hemoglobin; the other third is stored in the bone marrow, spleen, liver and muscles. Myoglobin and enzymes contain about 15% of the iron, and ferritin almost as much (14%). Only about 1% is in transit in serum. In animals, plants and fungi, iron is often incorporated into heme. Heme is an essential component of cytochrome proteins, which mediate redox reactions, and of oxygen carrier proteins such as hemoglobin (carries oxygen in the blood from the lungs to tissues throughout the body) and myoglobin (stores oxygen for the muscles to use when they contract). Iron also contributes to redox reactions in the iron\u2013sulfur clusters of many enzymes, such as nitrogenase (involved in the synthesis of ammonia from nitrogen) and hydrogenase. Non-heme iron proteins include the enzymes methane monooxygenase (oxidizes methane to methanol), ribonucleotide reductase (reduces ribose to deoxyribose), hemerythrins (oxygen transport and fixation in marine invertebrates) and purple acid phosphatase (hydrolysis of phosphate esters). Iron distribution is heavily regulated in mammals, and in cells iron is generally stored in the centre of metalloproteins (ferritins), partly because iron has a high potential for biological toxicity; in fact, free Fe2+ ions are efficient catalysts that can rapidly generate toxic oxygen free radicals within cells. Iron distribution is regulated, so restricting its availability to bacteria can help to prevent or limit infections. A major component of this regulation is the protein transferrin, which binds iron absorbed from the duodenum and carries it in the blood to cells. If an individual has an iron deficiency, the iron stores are depleted first, followed by a reduction in hemoglobin. As a result, red blood cells are small in size and diminished in number and the direct consequence is the occurrence of anemia. On the other hand, excessive iron can be toxic, because free ferrous iron reacts with peroxides to produce free radicals, which are highly reactive and can damage DNA, proteins, lipids and other cellular components. Thus, iron toxicity occurs when iron levels exceed the capacity of transferrin to bind the iron [6b]. Biologically relevant iron typically exists in Fe(II) and Fe(III) oxidation states. Both exist in low- and high-spin configurations and the facile interconversion between the low- and high-spin forms has important biochemical implications, as discussed in detail by Brady et al. [155]. The energy difference between low- and high-spin configurations for given oxidation state can be very small. Thus the modulation of spin state by ligand charges and differences in geometry can be important in catalytic mechanisms.

High spin Fe(II) and Fe(III) centers are paramagnetic, so the diamagnetic, low-spin ferrous ion 57Fe2+ is the only NMR-observable iron isotope. However, use of 57Fe-enriched material and high fields combined with the very large chemical shift range (>11000 ppm) has yielded useful information especially about heme proteins. Ferrocenes and porphyrins have been used as model compounds to obtain chemical shift data and to gain insight on the relaxation mechanisms [157]. 57Fe NMR spectra are available for myoglobins and cytochrome-c (Fig. 18\n) [158], and it has been established that this technique is a powerful probe for iron\u2013ligand interactions in these proteins, particularly for porphyrin geometry [157], [159].",

However, in the last 15 years ruthenium and osmium complexes have aroused great interest for their potential use as therapeutic anticancer agents [160]. Two Ru(III) complexes, namely trans-[RuCl4(Im)(DMSO)]ImH (NAMI-A) [161] and trans-[RuCl4(Ind)2]IndH (KP1019) [162] are undergoing clinical trials. Whilst KP1019 is cytotoxic to cancer cells, NAMI-A is relatively non-toxic but has antimetastatic activity. It has been proposed that the activity of Ru(III) complexes, which are usually relatively inert towards ligand substitution, is dependent on in vivo reduction to more labile Ru(II) analogues. Thus, the activity of Ru(II) complexes is currently being explored. In particular, since arenes are known to stabilize ruthenium in its 2+ oxidation state, the potential of Ru(II)\u2013(\u03b76-arene) complexes as anticancer agents is under investigation [163]. In addition, a variety of ruthenium derivatives have been reported with activity against bacteria, HIV, and parasitic infection. Radical scavenging properties have been identified for Ru(II) complexes that might offer therapeutic benefits in inflammatory diseases involving reactive oxygen species or NO [86]. Given the strict similarity with Ru(II), the possible design of Os(II)-(\u03b76-arene) anticancer complexes has been recently taken into account [164].",

Therefore, the 99Ru nucleus is favored for NMR spectroscopy, despite the slightly lower natural abundance (12.72% vs. 17.07% for 101Ru). Another problem encountered in 99Ru NMR is the low resonance frequency, resulting in acoustic ringing that causes distorted baselines. Very little is known about the dependence of \u03b4(99Ru) on structure and temperature, thus it is not surprising that relatively few 99Ru NMR spectroscopic studies have been performed [165]. In addition, due to the presence of unpaired electrons, Ru(III) compounds cannot be directly detected by 99Ru NMR spectroscopy, so 99Ru(II) is the only NMR-observable ruthenium isotope.

            "text": "Copper is the third most abundant transition metal element in biological systems after iron and zinc. The bioinorganic chemistry of copper is dominated by 1+ and 2+ oxidation states. Almost all of the copper in humans is bound to either transport proteins (ceruloplasmin and copper-albumin), storage proteins (metallothioneins), or copper-containing enzymes, whereas unbound, free copper is not found in large quantities in the human body. A substantial number of copper metalloenzymes are found in the human body. Copper is essential for the proper functioning of these copper-dependent enzymes, including cytochrome-c oxidase (energy production), superoxide dismutase (antioxidant protection), tyrosinase (pigmentation), dopamine hydroxylase (catecholamine production), lysyl oxidase (collagen and elastin formation), clotting factor V (blood clotting), and ceruloplasmin (antioxidant protection, iron metabolism and copper transport). In addition to its enzymatic roles, copper is used for biological electron transport. The \u201cblue copper\u201d proteins (named after their intense blue color arising from a ligand-to-metal charge-transfer absorption band at \u223c600 nm) that participate in electron transport include azurin and plastocyanin [6]. Most features of severe copper deficiency can be explained by a failure of one or more of these copper-dependent enzymes. For instance, depigmentation can be explained by a tyrosinase deficiency, and the defects of collagen and elastin causing abnormalities in the connective tissue and vascular system can be explained by a lysyl oxidase deficiency. Copper complexes are currently being investigated for their potential anticancer activity. Moreover, coordination with copper, either prior to administration or in vivo, often enhances the activity of various types of drugs such as antitumor and antiinflammatory agents [86].",

Although 107Ag has a slightly higher natural abundance (51.82% vs. 48.18% for 109Ag), the preferred isotope for NMR spectroscopic observation is 109Ag, due to its slightly higher receptivity. The two most serious difficulties encountered when performing silver NMR experiments are poor sensitivity and extremely long spin\u2013lattice relaxation times. These properties stem from the very low gyromagnetic ratios for both 107Ag and 109Ag. NMR spectroscopy occupies a position of preeminence in probing metal-binding sites where the native metal ions, e.g. Zn(II), Ca(II), Fe(II), Mg(II), Cu(II) and Cu(I), can be substituted with spin I\n = 1/2 metal isotopes. In spite of the attractiveness of Ag(I) as a redox stable analogue for Cu(I), 109Ag NMR has so far found limited applications in biological systems, owing mostly to the insensitivity of the investigated nucleus, making direct detection impractical for most biological systems [188]. Relatively few examples of Ag(I) complexes have been characterized by 109Ag NMR [189], and the only known metalloprotein studied by 2D [1H,109Ag] HMQC spectroscopy to date is the 109Ag-substituted yeast metallothionein (Fig. 21\n) [190].",

Among other things, these enzymes are involved in nucleic acid and protein metabolism and the production of energy. It is estimated that around 3000 proteins in the human body contain zinc prosthetic groups; in particular, zinc plays a structural role in the formation of the so-called zinc fingers. Zinc fingers are exploited by transcription factors for interacting with DNA and regulating the activity of genes. Another structural role of zinc is in the maintenance of the integrity of biological membranes resulting in their protection against oxidative injury. In addition, there are over a dozen types of cells in the human body that secrete zinc ions, and the roles of these secreted zinc signals in medicine and health are now being actively studied. Intriguingly, brain cells in the mammalian forebrain are one type of cell that secretes zinc, along with its other neuronal messenger substances [193]. Zinc exists under physiological conditions in the 2+ oxidation state. Over 95% of total body zinc is bound to proteins within cells and cell membranes. Plasma contains only 0.1% of total body zinc. Most of the zinc (75\u201388%) in blood is found in the red blood cell zinc metalloenzyme carbonic anhydrase. In the plasma, approximately 18% of zinc is bound to \u03b12-macroglobulin, 80% to albumin and 2% to such proteins as transferrin and ceruloplasmin. As a metallotherapeutic agent, zinc has putative antiviral, fertility-enhancing and retino-protective activities.

In recent years, however, dramatic improvements in the solid-state NMR of quadrupolar nuclides have ocurred. A general strategy for the observation of low \u03b3 half-integer quadrupolar nuclides has been developed. The methodology combines low-temperature (4\u2013100 K) techniques with cross-polarization experiments while employing a Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill spin\u2013echo sequence, a strategy that affords sufficient sensitivity to examine Zn2+-binding sites in metalloproteins by solid-state 67Zn NMR spectroscopy [196].",

At natural abundance, the sensitivity of 113Cd is 7.6 times that of 13C, putting it on the fringe of accessibility for biological applications using modern high-field spectrometers. However, an approximate eightfold enhancement can be obtained by substitution with 96% isotopically enriched 113Cd, allowing reasonable quality spectra to be acquired on as little as 0.5 mL of 0.5 mM of a 113Cd-substituted protein sample in a few hours of data accumulation.",

The adaptable ligand coordination number and geometry of Cd(II), which is quite similar to Zn(II), and factors such as its similar ionic radius (0.97 \u00c5) to that of Ca(II) (0.99 \u00c5) are the most commonly cited reasons why cadmium substitutes for such an extensive range of metal ions. Of even greater importance is the fact that, in a variety of cases where Zn(II) has been replaced by Cd(II) in native Zn(II) metalloenzymes and DNA-binding proteins, the wild-type activity has, at least to some extent, been retained, albeit at an altered pH maximum [199].",

These supply sulfhydryl ligands that in vivo bind with high affinity to a number of metal ions of differing size and chemical properties, such as the essential metal ions Zn2+ and Cu+, and the toxic metal ion Cd2+. The 20 cysteines bind seven Cd2+ or Zn2+ ions or combinations of them in two metal-thiolate clusters. Cu+ forms substantially different complexes with MTs, the structures of which are not yet well characterized [200]. 113Cd, has frequently been used to probe the ligand environment of metal-binding sites. 113Cd chemical shifts are very sensitive to the nature, number, and geometric arrangement of the coordinating ligands. This is reflected by the almost 900 ppm range of chemical shifts observed in 113Cd-substituted metalloproteins (Fig. 22\n) [201]. The broad chemical shift dispersion of 113Cd resonances is useful not only in providing information about the ligand type(s) at a particular metal site, but also because systems containing multiple metal sites with identical ligand coordination environments have a high probability of yielding resolved 113Cd resonances (Fig. 23\n). The consistent correlation that exists between the 113Cd chemical shift in solution and the identity of the coordinating metal ligands (Fig. 22) is derived solely from Cd-substituted, structurally-defined metalloproteins.",

Much of these data are a result of the recent efforts of O\u2019Halloran and co-workers aimed at defining the metal coordination environments in proteins involved in bacterial mercury resistance, and have revealed 199Hg chemical shifts indicative of certain coordination environments [208b]. {HgS3} centers have chemical shifts of ca. \u2212100 ppm and {HgS4} centers at approximately \u2212250 ppm, with {HgN4} sites at the other extreme of chemical shift at about \u22121200 ppm (relative to [Hg(CH3)2]). In addition, 199Hg exhibits scalar couplings to 1H, 13C and 15N that are slightly larger than those observed with 113Cd, permitting heteronuclear correlation experiments to be carried out, which are often able to confirm the ligand type(s) and stoichiometry.

Further development of MRI contrast agents focuses mainly on gadolinium chelated by polydentate aminocarboxylate and related ligands. Gadolinium also has potential for use in neutron capture therapy with the advantage that its uptake can be monitored by MRI [210]. There are two main goals for future development. One is to control biological behavior (cellular uptake and retention, tissue targeting, in vivo stability) by incorporating Gd into bioconjugates, such as lipids with acid labile bonds (dota-palmitic acid micelles, hydroxymethyl dota derivatives, enhanced stability dtpa derivatives, and polymers/dendrimers). The other is to improve the efficiency with which the complexes induce spin relaxation in protons of water molecules, by designing chelators to control exchange rates of coordinated, or hydrogen-bonded water molecules, and by controlling the mobility and rotation (e.g. through molecular size) of complexes. These two goals can be combined by designing agents whose spin relaxation properties are dependent on the physiological environment, so that MRI scans can provide biochemical/physiological as well as structural information. \u03b2-Emitting radionuclides of lanthanide elements, and bifunctional chelators for attaching them to carrier molecules have been also reviewed.

Indeed, oxygen controls or participates in nearly every biological process, especially those involving aerobic metabolism. Oxygen occupies a key position both at structural and physiological levels. In all macromolecules, including peptides, proteins, DNA and RNA (especially ribosomes) and carbohydrates, oxygen has a major role in the molecular conformation observed, such as the secondary, tertiary and quaternary structure. In proteins that are stabilized through multiple hydrogen bonds, changes which occur between ground and transition states can also induce an important effect on enzyme catalysis [214]. It is therefore not surprising that oxygen atoms are involved in triggering, signaling and activation mechanisms.",

In vivo\n17O NMR has two major applications for studying brain function and cerebral bioenergetics [220]. The first application is to measure the cerebral blood flow (CBF) through monitoring the washout of inert H2\n17O tracer in brain tissue following an intravascular bolus injection of the 17O-labelled water. The second application, perhaps the most important one, is to determine the cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen utilization (CMRO2) through monitoring the dynamic changes of metabolically generated H2\n17O from inhaled 17O-labeled oxygen gas in the brain tissue. Unlike the CBF measurements, the amount of the metabolically generated H2\n17O during an inhalation of 17O2 is small. This could affect the reliability of CMRO2 measurement using in vivo\n17O approaches. With the dramatic 17O sensitivity gain realized at high fields, it was possible to obtain a three-dimensional 17O chemical shift imaging from the natural abundance H2\n17O in a rat brain with excellent signal-to-noise ratio as well as good temporal and spatial resolutions (11 s of data acquisition and \u223c0.1 ml chemical shift imaging voxel size) at 9.4 T [220a]. Fig. 24\nshows one example of three adjacent slices of 17O chemical shift imaging of the natural abundance H2\n17O from a representative rat brain acquired by an 17O surface coil and the 3D Fourier series window spectroscopic imaging technique at 9.4 T. One great merit of in vivo\n17O NMR for the determination of CMRO2 is that only the metabolic H2\n17O is detectable. This merit dramatically simplifies both CMRO2 measurement and quantification compared to other established methods. There are two major NMR approaches for monitoring H2\n17O in vivo, namely a direct approach by using 17O NMR detection and an indirect approach by using 1H NMR detection for measuring the changes in T\n2- or T\n1-weighted proton NMR signals caused by the 17O\u20131H scalar coupling and proton chemical exchange. Both approaches are suitable for CBF measurements. However, recent studies indicate that the direct in vivo\n17O NMR approach at high/ultrahigh fields appears to offer significant advantages for quantifying and imaging CMRO2 [220b].",

Homocysteine and taurine are other sulfur-containing acids which are similar in structure, but which are not coded for by DNA, and are not part of the primary structure of proteins. Glutathione (\u03b3-Glu-Cys-Gly) is an important sulfur-containing tripeptide which plays a role in cells as a source of chemical reduction potential in the cell, through its sulfhydryl group. Many important cellular enzymes use prosthetic groups ending with sulfhydryl groups to handle reactions involving acyl-containing biochemicals: two common examples from basic metabolism are coenzyme A and alpha-lipoic acid. Disulfide bonds (S\u2013S bonds) formed between cysteine residues in peptide chains are very important in protein assembly and structure.

Since 33S has a large quadrupole moment, nuclear relaxation is dominated by the quadrupolar mechanism and, consequently, 33S NMR signals are very broad unless the electronic surrounding of sulfur is highly symmetric.

There has been considerable interest in the application of NMR probes to the study of the conformation of proteins. The NMR halide probe method [241] detects changes in the halide nuclear transverse relaxation time (T\n2) as a result of halide exchange between symmetrically solvated free halide ion (long T\n2) and a probe site where the quadrupolar halide nucleus is bound tightly to a specific region within a protein (short T\n2). The resulting relaxation time is dependent on the relative concentrations of free and bound sites, and the physical environment of the bound halide. In its most common application, a solution of protein is prepared in aqueous sodium halide, and specific binding sites on the protein may be titrated with a metal such as mercury which binds only to these sites and which subsequently complexes halide from the solution. The application of the bromide ion as an NMR probe has been investigated, as it has some advantages over the more commonly used chloride ion, the most important being its ability to yield values for the free-to-bound exchange rate constant of the probe itself, in addition to the correlation time for reorientation of the bound probe. The exchange rates are fast, near the diffusion limit, and are sensitive to protein conformational effects near the binding site [242].",

The nature of the species will determine their biological activity. Our review has illustrated the challenges involved in making NMR studies of many elements of interest. Although a few have readily observable spin I\n = 1/2 nuclei available for study (e.g. Cd, Ag, Pt), their sensitivity is not sufficient for investigations at biologically relevant concentration (micromolar or below), and signal broadening via relaxation mechanisms such as chemical shift anisotropy can be a problem. Nevertheless, in favorable circumstances, NMR spectroscopy can provide valuable insight into the biological chemistry of these elements. The problem of line-broadening of resonances from quadrupolar nuclei in low-symmetry environments greatly hinders NMR studies of a range of biologically important elements, but again under favorable conditions, NMR can also provide insight into both the thermodynamics and kinetics of their bonding sites. There is a need for the continued development of new NMR methods to study a wide range of nuclei, especially to decrease the line-widths of peaks from quadrupolar nuclei and increase the effective sensitivity of detection. Such advances could potentially be of direct benefit to the design of new medicines.",
