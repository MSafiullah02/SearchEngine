COVID-19 was classified as a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) on March 11, 2020. The disease has reached nearly every country. As of April 16, 2020 there were 2,090,110 confirmed cases worldwide, with 139,469 deaths [7]. The death and disability from COVID-19, combined with the lack of approved treatments, have created an unmet need for efficacious therapies.",

Therapeutic repurposing (i.e., repositioning) is an expedited drug-development strategy to reuse currently FDA-approved therapeutics for new medical indications. On March 28, the FDA granted emergency authorization for the use of chloroquine phosphate and hydroxychloroquine sulfate to treat COVID-19 [14]. The European Medicines Agency recommended restricting their use pending the outcome of clinical trials [15]. The American Academy of Clinical Toxicology (AACT), the American Association of Poison Control Centers (AAPCC), and the American College of Medical Toxicology (ACMT) recommended in a joint press release that use of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine should occur only under the direction of a medical provider, for an FDA-approved indication, or as part of a trial for the treatment of COVID-19 or as part of an approved hospital protocol [16].",

In a retrospective study of 191 patients with chloroquine toxicity, a serum potassium lower than 3.0 mmol/L was correlated with mortality, and the serum potassium decreased as serum chloroquine levels increased [39]. The linear relationship between serum potassium and chloroquine concentrations suggests that hypokalemia reflects an effect of chloroquine itself, although the severely ill patients also received epinephrine infusions (beta-adrenergic agonists can cause intracellular potassium shifts). Total body potassium stores are not expected to be depleted in the setting of chloroquine toxicity, raising concern for rebound hyperkalemia as toxicity resolves. As such, some clinicians recommend less aggressive potassium repletion, supplementing normal daily potassium with 80 mEq per 24 h [39], though if severe hypokalemia is present, it would be reasonable to replete, while observing for rebound hyperkalemia. The treatment for acute toxicity from hydroxychloroquine is thought to be the same as for acute toxicity from chloroquine.",

It does so by acting as a soluble molecular decoy for SARS-CoV-2, preventing the virus from binding to cellular ACE2 in a dose-dependent fashion [50]. ACE2, in vitro, is the essential receptor for the SARS-CoV-2 entry [51] and also serves to maintain normal lung physiology. When the virion binds to cell surface ACE2 this lung protective signalingis lost. By preventing ACE2-mediated SARS-CoV-2 interaction, and therefore restoring physiologic ACE2 signaling, APN01 may reduce acute lung injury [52]. A randomized unblinded clinical trial is underway in China to investigate the efficacy of APN01 to reduce viral load and the duration of COVID-19 symptoms [53].",

Toxicity from recombinant proteins, in general, arises from inadvertent activation of the immune system (unintentional immunogenicity) and binding of the recombinant proteins to other cell surface receptors triggering cellular signal transduction cascades that were not consciously targeted (off-target binding). Unintentional immunogenicity can lead to the formation of anti-drug antibodies that can deposit in tissues as immune complexes. For example, immune complexes can deposit in the kidney impairing the kidney's ability to filter out toxins and recover electrolytes. If the immune system treats the recombinant protein as an antigen, treatment may precipitate serum sickness. Off-target binding of APN01 could modulate renin-angiotensin signaling, altering blood pressure and organ perfusion. One abstract provides evidence that up to 1.2 mg/kg per day caused no immunogenicity or cardiovascular toxicity in three healthy human volunteers [54].",

Chemokine receptor 5 (CCR5) was first characterized for its role as a co-receptor in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) viral entry into white blood cells [55]. We now recognize that other pathogens, such as Dengue [56] or Staphylococcus aureus [57] also use the CCR5 signaling pathway for entry or as a virulence factor. Leronlimab is being repurposed and investigated as a treatment option for patients with COVID-19 who experience respiratory complications as a result of COVID-19. A single-arm, open-label, multi-center clinical study is set to take place to investigate the clinical improvement in total symptom score (i.e., fever, myalgia, dyspnea, and cough). Currently, leronlimab has a \u201cfast-track\u201d designation from the FDA for HIV and metastatic triple-negative breast cancer [58]. There are no serious side effects or adverse events reported so far. Leronlimab has successfully completed nine phase 1, 2, and 3 clinical trials in about 800 patients for other indications and achieved primary efficacy endpoints [59].",

Severe metabolic acidosis with elevated lactate is a toxicity of nucleoside analogs that has a high mortality. Peripheral neuropathy is a dose-related, subacute phenomenon seen with stavudine, 2\u2032,3\u2032-didehydro-2\u2032,3\u2032-dideoxythymidine (d4T), didanosine (ddI), and zalcitabine (ddC) [64].

Pancreatitis and myopathy have been observed with several medications in this class [66]. Each of these toxicities are thought to reflect mitochondrial dysfunction. In addition to inhibiting viral polymerase, nucleoside analogs also inhibit mitochondrial DNA polymerase-gamma, leading to decreased mitochondrial DNA and synthesis of mitochondrial proteins [64]. If severe toxicity occurs, the offending agent should be stopped. There is no specific antidote, though some suggest that treatment with mitochondrial cofactors, such as thiamine, riboflavin, l-carnitine, and vitamin C, may help patients recover [63]. Additional idiosyncratic toxicities may also occur, for example, tenofovir inducing crystalluria [67].",

However, ACE inhibitors have been shown to reduce viral entry by competitive inhibition of spike protein binding to ACE2 in vitro [102]. Lastly, alveolar cells infected with coronavirus express less ACE2 on their cell surface than normal cells in vitro.

Other less common risks include (1) transmission of infections, (2) febrile non-hemolytic transfusion reactions, (3) RBC alloimmunization, and (4) hemolytic transfusion reactions [109]. A meta-analysis of studies that used convalescent plasma to treat SARS and influenza A (H1N1) reported no adverse effects beyond minor infusion reactions such as chills and fevers [110]. Four critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 had no significant adverse events when treated with convalescent plasma and supportive care [111].",

Frontline providers may be unfamiliar with the usage of older therapeutics, such as chloroquine, or medicines typically used by subspecialists, like DNA vaccines, protease inhibitors, or convalescent plasma therapy. In conjunction with effective infection control policies, a combination of measured and reasoned repurposing of existing therapies, development and vetting of novel drugs, and guidance by medical toxicologists may reduce morbidity and mortality from COVID-19 and avoid cases where the cure is worse than the disease.",
