Of particular interest is the theoretical understanding of epidemic models in scale-free (SF) networks [5], in which the probability P(k) (degree distribution) that a node is connected to k others (has degree k) exhibits heavy tails of the form P(k)\u223ck\u2212\u03b3. This interest is motivated by the possible effects that a heterogeneous topology might have on the location of the epidemic threshold \u03bbc, for some control parameter \u03bb, signaling a phase transition separating a healthy, disease-free phase, from an infected phase, in which the epidemics can thrive [1].",

            "text": "For epidemics leading to a steady (endemic) state, the main object of interest has been the susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) model, which is defined as follows [6]: Individuals, represented as nodes in the network, can assume two different states, susceptible (S) or healthy, and infected (I), and capable of transmitting the disease. Infected individuals recover and become spontaneously susceptible again with a rate \u03b2 that can be taken equal to 1. Transmission of the disease is effected by a rate to transmit the disease through an edge connecting an infected to a susceptible node equal to a constant \u03bb. After a considerable theoretical effort, it has been shown that the behavior of the SIS model in uncorrelated [2] SF networks is far from trivial [7\u201316]. Two competing theories were initially proposed to account for the SIS epidemic threshold. Heterogeneous mean-field (HMF) theories [1], neglecting both dynamical and topological correlations, provide a threshold \u03bbcHMF=\u2329k\u232a/\u2329k2\u232a\n[8,17], which tends to zero in the thermodynamic limit for \u03b3\u22643, and is finite for \u03b3>3. Quenched mean-field (QMF) theory [9], including the full network structure through its adjacency matrix Aij\n[2], but still neglecting dynamical correlations, predicts instead a threshold \u03bbcQMF\u22431/\u039bm, where \u039bm is the largest eigenvalue of the adjacency matrix. The scaling form of this threshold is given by [11,18]\n\u03bbcQMF\u22431/kmax for \u03b3>5/2, where kmax is the maximum degree in the network, while for \u03b3<5/2 it yields \u03bbcQMF\u2243\u2329k\u232a/\u2329k2\u232a in agreement with HMF theory. Numerical simulations [11,12,14] indicate that QMF is qualitatively correct in SF networks, implying that the epidemic threshold vanishes in the thermodynamic limit when kmax diverges, irrespective of the degree exponent \u03b3.",

The fact that the lifetime \u03c4krec is diverging with degree k faster than \u03c4k,k\u2032inf for any value of \u03bb is the ultimate cause of the null epidemic threshold in the SIS model [10,14,15]. However, other epidemic and dynamical models on SF networks, in particular the contact process (CP) [19], defined by an infection rate inversely proportional to the degree of the infected node, \u03bb/k, possess a finite threshold which can be better captured in terms of a HMF theory [20,21]. This observation claims an understanding of the mechanisms ruling epidemic transitions, regarding in particular the conditions under which the threshold is either constant or vanishing.",

Here we determine the recovery \u03c4rec and infection \u03c4inf time scales of hubs for generic epidemic models including waning immunity and arbitrary edge-dependent infection rates and, building on these results, we propose a classification of endemic epidemic transitions on networks: When \u03c4rec\u226b\u03c4inf, a scenario of local hub activation with mutual hub reinfection is at work [14], leading to \u03bbc\u21920 when the recovery times diverge in the thermodynamic limit. In such scenario, QMF theories are expected to be qualitatively correct. On the other hand, for \u03c4rec\u2264\u03c4inf, mutual hub reinfection cannot take place, and an endemic state is possible only through a collective activation of the whole network in a standard phase transition occurring at a finite threshold. In this second scenario, HMF theories should be correct.",

For sake of generality, the theory is also applied to other epidemic models without immunity, namely, the CP [19] and the generalized SIS model proposed by Karsai, Juh\u00e1sz, and Igl\u00f3i (KJI) [23] with weighted infection rates.",

To estimate this quantity, we approximate the dynamics of a hub of degree k by that of a star-like graph, composed by a center connected to k nodes (leaves) of arbitrary degree, the red nodes in Fig. 1(c), where we neglect infection coming from outside the star. For analytical tractability, we consider a simplified generic epidemic process with two states (S, I) in the leaves and three states (S, I, R) in the center. The rate of infection along an edge from a leaf to the center is approximated by \u03bbkin and from the center to a leaf by \u03bbkout, see Eq. (1); that is, we consider the effect of the leaves as an average over their possible degree values k\u2032, weighted with the probability P(k\u2032|k). The transitions I\u2192S (leaves), I\u2192R and R\u2192S (center) have constant rates \u03b2, \u03b2, and \u03b1, respectively. The lifespan for this dynamics is larger than in the real model, where leaves can also assume the R state, and so it provides an upper bound for the true \u03c4krec.",

Thus, in the case \u03b3>3, where HMF and QMF predictions disagree markedly for \u03b8<1/2, we obtain that, for \u03b8<1/2, the transition should be driven by a hub activation mechanism, since in this region \u03c4rec\u226b\u03c4inf, and thus should correspond to a vanishing threshold, qualitatively in agreement with QMF, which indeed predicts a threshold \u03bbcQMF,KJI\u223ckmax\u03b8\u22121/2; see Appendix A. For \u03b8>1/2, on the other hand, the hub lifetime is finite, compatible with a collectively activated transition, and corresponding to a finite threshold, in agreement with both HMF and QMF theories. These predictions are verified in Fig. 2(b) by means of numerical simulations of the KJI model on SF networks using the quasistationary (QS) method [20,31], estimating the effective threshold for each network size as the position of the main peak shown by the susceptibility \u03c7=N(\u2329\u03c12\u232a\u2212\u2329\u03c1\u232a)/\u2329\u03c1\u232a (see Appendix C for simulation details). For values of \u03b8 close to 1/2, however, long crossovers are found in the threshold, in analogy with the behavior observed in the lifespan of stars. Indeed, after a crossover that can be very long as \u03b8 approaches 1/2, the epidemic lifetime of the KJI model on star graphs of increasing size reaches the asymptotic regime of a stretched exponential; see Fig. 2. These crossovers, also observed in the numerical estimate of the QMF threshold (see Appendix A), explain the apparently constant threshold observed in Fig. 2 for \u03b8=0.4. Equivalent scenarios can be drawn for \u03b3<3 with critical values of \u03b8 smaller than 1/2.",

We consider in particular the location-based social network Gowalla [33] and the product copurchasing network in the Amazon website [34], possessing degree exponents smaller and larger than 3, respectively; Fig. 5(c). According to QMF theory, the thresholds for these networks are equal to the inverse of the largest eigenvalue of their adjacency matrix. By means of a numerical diagonalization, we obtain the values \u03bbcQMF,Gowalla=0.0059 and \u03bbcQMF,Amazon=0.042. Our simulations show, in the case of the Gowalla network, with a degree exponent \u03b3\u22432.4<3, that numerically estimated thresholds are essentially independent of \u03b1 and very close to the QMF prediction. This behavior is consistent with the theoretical expectation of a hub activated dynamics, to be observed in the regime \u03b3<3; see Fig. 5(a).

The criterion is based on the comparison of the time scales of hub recovery (lifespan) and hub reinfection. When the lifespan is larger than the infection time, dynamics is triggered by a hub activation process, akin to the SIS dynamics: Hubs survive for very long times, and are able to reinfect each other, in such a way as to establish a long-lived endemic state. This hub activation scenario leads to a vanishing threshold when the lifespan is diverging faster than the reinfection time in the thermodynamic limit. In this case, QMF theories are expected to be qualitatively correct. The reason underlying the effectiveness of QMF theories lies in the fact that they take into account the full topological structure of the network, and are dominated by the effects of the largest hubs. On the other hand, for a lifespan smaller than the infection time scale, hub activation cannot be sustained and possible epidemic phase transitions should be the result of a collective activation process, leading to a standard phase transition at a finite threshold, as in the case of the CP. In this second scenario, HMF theories should be qualitatively correct, due to the fact that they work on the annealed network approximation, in which every node can interact with every other with a degree dependent probability [35].",

The model has as particular cases the fundamental epidemic models, as the SIS, SIRS, and CP as well as more complex ones as the generalized SIS model of Ref. [23], which we have considered. After exemplifying our framework with the known cases of the SIS and CP models, we present an extended discussion of the SIRS model, an extension of the SIS model with waning immunity. While previous analytic approaches (HMF and QMF theories) predict for the SIRS model the same behavior as the SIS model, the main result from our criterion is that we are able to show that, instead, the effect of even a small amount of waning immunity is able to restore a finite threshold (albeit affected by possible strong finite-size effects) in scale-free networks with degree exponent \u03b3>3, at odds with the QMF theory valid for SIS in this regime, and in agreement with HMF theory. Our predictions are corroborated by means of numerical simulation on synthetic uncorrelated scale-free networks, as well as on real correlated networks.",
