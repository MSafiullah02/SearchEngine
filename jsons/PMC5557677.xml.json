This high rate of evolution is attributable, in part, to the virus\u2019s very high mutation rate (2\u20135). Influenza A virus rapidly acquires antigenic changes and antiviral resistance, which limit the effectiveness of vaccines and antiviral drugs (6, 7). As in many RNA viruses, influenza A virus\u2019s low fidelity is due to the absence of proofreading and repair mechanisms during genome replication (8\u201310). We have previously estimated the IAV mutation rate to be greater than 1 \u00d7 10\u22124 mutations per nucleotide per RNA strand replicated, which suggests that approximately 2 new mutations are introduced into every newly synthesized genome (2\u20134, 11\u201313). As a result, IAVs exist as swarms of distinct genetic variants, which provide a rich substrate for natural selection of adaptive mutations.",

In IAV, we have found that 30% of single nucleotide changes are lethal and 70% decrease replicative fitness (15). Lethal mutagenesis is an antiviral strategy that utilizes nucleoside analogues to increase a virus\u2019s mutation rate and the frequency of deleterious or lethal mutations (16, 17). The effectiveness of lethal mutagenesis has been demonstrated in many viral systems, including poliovirus, human immunodeficiency virus, foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV), lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus, and IAV (18\u201324). A hallmark of lethal mutagenesis is a reduction in virus specific infectivity due to the increased genesis of genomes that do not encode a functional complement of viral proteins. In addition to their mutagenic effects, many nucleoside analogs also inhibit the activity of viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRp) (25\u201328).",

Interestingly, a mutation in the polymerase-associated 2C protein of FMDV also appears to alter mutagen-induced mutational bias (37). The DNA bacteriophage \u03c6X174 mitigates the impact of mutagenesis by delaying lysis and increasing its burst size, a mechanism of genetic robustness that paradoxically maintains unmutagenized progeny (38, 39). Finally, a virus\u2019s primary sequence also affects mutagen sensitivity through its genetic robustness or ability to buffer the fitness effects of mutations (40, 41).

In contrast to this large group of viruses, IAV replicates its genome using a heterotrimeric replicase complex. This complex consists of the PB2, PA, and PB1 proteins, which have 5\u2032-cap binding, 5\u2032-cap stealing, and RdRp activities, respectively (42). The constraints of this polymerase complex may alter the genetic barrier to mutagen resistance or its potential mechanisms. Two polymerase variants with reduced sensitivity to the mutagen ribavirin {1-[(2R,3R,4S,5R)-3,4-dihydroxy-5-(hydroxymethyl)oxolan-2-yl]-1H-1,2,4-triazole-3-carboxamide} have been reported for IAV. The PB1 V43I mutation was identified as a minority variant upon serial passage of A/Wuhan/35/95 (H3N2) in low concentrations of ribavirin and appears to have altered fidelity in that genetic background (22). A second mutation, PB1 D27N, was recovered in a screen for PB1 mutants in A/WSN/33 (H1N1) that maintained RNA synthesis during ribavirin treatment (43, 44).",

In the absence of mutagenic drug, we identified a range of fitness effects among the polymerase mutants (Fig. 2A). The PB1 T123A virus was more fit than the WT, even out of the drug, and released more genomes into the supernatant early in replication than either WT or the other mutants (Fig. 2B). Both PB1 M645I and PA T97I were essentially neutral. The PB1 T123A PA T97I double mutant, which was highly resistant to 5FU, exhibited reciprocal sign epistasis, as it had a marked decrease in fitness while each single mutant mutation was beneficial or neutral. Consistent with the lower fitness of this mutant, it produced fewer genomes than the wild type (Fig. 2B). The rate of genomic RNA production in cells for each of the mutants largely mirrored the rate of release into the cell-free fraction, suggesting that our measurements of viral RNA in supernatants reflect the kinetics of RNA synthesis (Fig. 2C).

We also evaluated PB1 V43I, which has been reported to be a fidelity variant (22, 45). We used this novel fluctuation test to interrogate four of the most common mutational classes (A to G, C to U, G to A, and U to C), for which the assay has the greatest discriminatory power. These same mutational classes are also those most affected by 5FU treatment. Both PA T97I and the PB1 T123A PA T97I double mutant had mutation rates that were very similar to those of the WT. Unexpectedly, PB1 T123A made significantly more C-to-U and G-to-A mutations than the WT. While we cannot rule out differences in the rates of transversion mutations, these less common mutation classes would be unlikely to affect overall polymerase fidelity. The PB1 V43I mutant had no evident resistance to nucleoside analogs or altered mutation rate in the PR8 genetic background. As the fidelity and resistance phenotypes of this mutation were demonstrated in the A/Wuhan/359/95 H3N2 strain, we suggest that its effects could be modulated by epistatic interactions within the PR8 polymerase complex.",

The increase in transition mutations in the PA T97I mutant with 5FU treatment was similar to that of the WT. In contrast, the PB1 T123A mutant, which has an increased baseline rate of C-to-U and G-to-A mutations, selectively buffers against further drug-induced increases in the same classes. This phenotype is most pronounced for C-to-U mutations. While 15 \u03bcM 5FU increased all transition mutations approximately 5-fold in PR8, we observed almost no change in C-to-U mutations in the PB1 T123A mutant. The PB1 T123A PA T97I double mutant also buffers against C-to-U mutations induced by 5FU, albeit not as dramatically as the PB1 T123A single mutant.

The PB1 T123A PA T97I double mutant maintained its generally lower level of genome production across multiple time points, consistent with epistatic interactions between these mutations and their impact on 5FU resistance.",

We therefore investigated the mechanisms through which influenza virus can resist the antiviral effects of nucleoside analog drugs. We identified PB1 T123A and PA T97I as two 5-fluorouracil resistance mutations that interact epistatically. We also found evidence for epistasis in the previously identified ribavirin resistance mutants PB1 D27N and PB1 V43I, as they remain sensitive to the drug in the PR8 genetic background. The three mutagen-resistant viruses reported here are not high-fidelity variants, and the PB1 T123A variant paradoxically exhibits a higher baseline mutation rate for certain mutational classes. We identified maintained genome output as the main mechanism of 5-fluroruracil resistance for PB1 T123A and resistance to drug-mediated RdRp inhibition as the mechanism for the PB1 T123A PA T97I double mutant.",

Mutations that alter the fidelity of RNA virus replication have rarely been observed within the active site of the RdRp (48\u201350). The PB1 T123 mutation is located within the fingers\u2019 domain, near where the RNA template enters the RdRp active site, while PA T97 is located far from the RdRp active site in the endonuclease domain of this PB1-associated protein.

While mutagen selection has been used to identify high-fidelity variants in a number of viral systems, the PB1 T123A virus actually has a marginally elevated mutation rate. This reduced fidelity is class specific, with the largest increase in C-to-U transitions. Despite its higher mutation rate, this virus had higher replicative fitness than the WT and released more genomes into the supernatant at the early stages of replication. Furthermore, its baseline specific infectivity was similar to that of the WT. We also found that while the baseline C-to-U mutation rate is higher for this mutant, the mutagenic effect of 5FU on this mutational class is dramatically reduced. This phenotype is similar to that of the ribavirin-resistant FMDV mutant 3D M296I (34, 51) and may reflect increased selectivity against misincorporation of 5FU. Our finding of reduced mutagenesis, however, seems inconsistent with the specific infectivity decrease we observe upon drug treatment. This may indicate that 5FU-mediated increases in the two most common mutation classes (A to G and U to C) are the main contributor to the observed decrease in specific infectivity with drug treatment. The most likely mechanism of resistance appears to be through its increase in replicative fitness in the absence of drug (Fig. 2). Importantly, the mutant also maintained its genomic output in the presence of 5FU, a phenotype augmented by PA T97I (Fig. 6 [see below]). The fact that PB1 T123A did not counter the detrimental effects of ribavirin and 5-azacytidine suggests that the resistance phenotype mediated by PB1 T123A is not broadly applicable to other nucleoside analogs.",

This mutant, PA T97I, exhibited fitness and genome production phenotypes that were very similar to those of the wild type. Interestingly, this mutant was selected during ribavirin treatment but was resistant to 5FU and not ribavirin. This mutant closely mirrored PB1 T123A in terms of its smaller decreases in infectious titer upon treatment with 5FU. Unlike PB1 T123A, the baseline and 5FU-induced mutation rates of PA T97I are similar to those of the wild-type virus for all transition mutation classes. This mutant also exhibited decreases in genome production and release during 5FU treatment that were similar to those of the WT. It is currently unclear how PA T97I mediates its resistance to 5FU. Since its resistance was more pronounced at higher concentrations of 5FU, it is possible that the technical limitations in the amount of 5FU we could use for accurate mutation rate measurements prevented us from observing a subtle phenotype.",

Serendipitously, we found that this double mutant exhibited the most dramatic 5FU resistance phenotype of any of the mutants we tested. These two mutations led to a reduced fitness phenotype characteristic of reciprocal sign epistasis; the combination of a mutant with increased fitness (PB1 T123A) with a neutral mutant (PA T97I) led to a double mutant with very low fitness and significantly reduced genomic RNA output. At the concentrations of 5FU used for selection of resistant variants, this double mutant has a fitness lower than that of the wild type, even though it is highly resistant to the drug. This finding likely explains why it did not arise within our experimentally evolved populations. The double mutant virus had a nearly identical spectrum of transition mutation rates to the wild-type virus, and the double mutation only slightly mitigated the mutagenic effect of 5FU on C-to-U mutations. Drug resistance seems to be driven primarily by maintaining high genomic output during 5FU treatment, an effect that appears to be more pronounced than that of the PB1 T123A single mutant (Fig. 6). Treatment with a nucleoside analog led to almost no reduction in the number of genome segments that are released from infected cells. This mechanism allows for more infectious viral particles to be produced than in the wild type despite similar levels of mutagenesis and specific infectivity decreases.",

We find that this mutant is not resistant to ribavirin or other mutagenic nucleoside analogs in a replication-competent PR8 virus. Additionally, we found that the mutagen resistance and fidelity phenotype of PB1 V43I is strain dependent. This mutation, which mediates ribavirin resistance in the A/Wuhan/359/95 H3N2 and A/Vietnam/1203/1204 H5N1 strains, is sensitive to drug in the PR8 genetic background (22). The PB1 V43I mutant, which has been suggested to be a fidelity variant even in the PR8 background (45), shows no difference in the rate of transition mutations in PR8. These findings suggest that there are likely to be epistatic interactions governing polymerase activity and fidelity in influenza virus and that the ability of one virus to evolve resistance to a mutagen may not be reflective of how another strain evolves in the face of the same selective pressure.",

The identification of resistant variants that maintain genome output with little impact on specific infectivity suggests that inhibition of RdRp activity is the main mechanism of action for 5FU.

This \u201csafety in numbers\u201d phenomenon leads to population-level mutational robustness, even in the setting of individual-level hypersensitivity.

The null class model for fluctuation tests is most precise when the fraction of cultures lacking a new revertant\u2014the null class (P0)\u2014is between 0.1 and 0.7. These data points are indicated with solid symbols. In some cases, the amount of replicated virus was sufficiently low and the mutations were sufficiently rare that we were not able to obtain replicate fluctuation tests in which the null class lay within this ideal range. Those outside that range, with P0 values between 0.7 and 0.9, are shown as open symbols. Arithmetic means are shown for at least three replicate measurements. The statistical significance of the differences in mutation rates for each mutation class of each mutant relative to WT PR8 was determined by one-way ANOVA with Dunnett\u2019s multiple-comparison test. *, P < 0.05; **, P < 0.01.",
