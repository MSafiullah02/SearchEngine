            "text": "Traditionally, diagnosis of CCoV infection was made using virus isolation or electron microscopy, but these methods have been demonstrated to be poorly sensitive or specific. Recently, the establishment of reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays has led to an increase of both sensitivity and specificity, so that PCR has become the \u201cgold standard\u201d technique for the CCoV diagnosis (Pratelli et al., 1999, Pratelli et al., 2000). Several RT-PCR based methods have been developed for detecting CCoV RNA in the faeces of dogs, but none of these were designed to be quantitative (Bandai et al., 1999, Naylor et al., 2001, Pratelli et al., 1999, Pratelli et al., 2002c). Moreover, conventional RT-PCR assays are time consuming and contain a certain risk of carryover contamination due to the post-PCR manipulations and a second amplification step in nested PCR systems, especially when a high sample throughput is required. Finally, those methods are limited in sensitivity and allow only relatively few samples to be processed at one time. Conversely, it is well-known that real-time TaqMan RT-PCR enables a reproducible, sensitive and specific quantitation of viral RNA (Budevi and Weinstock, 2001, Gut et al., 1999, Martell et al., 1999, Callahan et al., 2001, Balasuriya et al., 2002, Reid et al., 2002, Smith et al., 2002, Spackman et al., 2002).",

The analytical performance of the CCoV fluorogenic RT-PCR was evaluated in comparison to that of a conventional qualitative RT-PCR assay. The fluorogenic assay was then applied to detect and quantify viral load in CCoV naturally infected dogs and to trace the course of CCoV infection in the faeces of a dog experimentally infected with a field CCoV strain.",

In addition to its greater sensitivity, this technique is rapid, allowing several samples to be processed in few hours, with a large increase in throughput. The assay is a closed system in which the tube is never opened post-amplification, and this eliminates the possibility of cross-contamination of new samples with products amplified previously. A limited carryover may occur due to the separation between RT and fluorogenic PCR, but we preferred a two-step assay, since one-tube methods are less cheap and sensitive than a two-step RT-PCR procedure (Nakamura et al., 1993). In order to reduce the risk of contamination, we have separated strictly the different working steps and carried out pipetting in different laminar flow hoods.",

Quantitative gel-based PCR assays have been established for measuring several cellular and viral RNAs, but they required time-consuming and potentially contaminating post-amplification steps and showed a lower precision (Wang et al., 1989, Kinoshita et al., 1992, Nagano and Kelly, 1994, Hua et al., 1999, Martell et al., 1999). Nevertheless, quantitation of CCoV in the faeces is essential to trace the course of natural as well as experimental infection in dogs. Among the faecal samples collected from the CCoV experimentally infected dog, four were only found to be positive by the fluorogenic assay, probably due to their low viral load combined with the higher sensitivity of the TaqMan assay. Conversely, one of the faecal samples of dogs infected naturally were only found to be positive by conventional RT-PCR. A possible explanation for this ambiguous result may be that the M gene, which is the target for both the conventional and fluorogenic assay, presents a certain degree of variability, so that mismatches in the binding site of primers and probe may reduce and, eventually, prevent an efficient amplification (Pratelli et al., 2001a, Pratelli et al., 2002b).",

Thus, the efficacy of CCoV vaccines may be evaluated, as described previously (Pratelli et al., 2003b, Pratelli et al., 2004), by monitoring viral shedding in the faeces of vaccinated dogs after CCoV challenge, using virus isolation and conventional RT-PCR. Theoretically, CCoV amounts in the faeces could be assessed by virus titration on cell cultures. However, the low sensitivity of CCoV isolation and, mainly, the appearance of CCoV specific antibodies in the faeces after the challenge may affect this virological assay (personal observation).
