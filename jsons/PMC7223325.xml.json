We developed an interview guide to ensure standardization across units and interviewers. The guide followed a chronological order starting with the content of the change and the main initial motive, or driver, for introducing it; the planning, dissemination and implementation phases; compliance and perceived benefits of the innovation. Pilot interviews carried out in Italy, France, Portugal and UK and discussions within the study team were used to finalize the guide.

To our knowledge, this is the first study providing an overview of the factors that trigger change and promote the introduction of clinical and organizational innovation in NICUs. The study benefited from the EPICE mixed-method design as we based our research hypothesis on quantitative data showing variable uptake of a range of evidence-based interventions by region.14 However, our decision to focus on the process of change allowed any unit to participate, as the interview contents were not contingent on use of a specific intervention. We did not provide a pre-set definition of innovation, allowing a better understanding of what constitutes innovation for the medical and nursing professionals. The choice of discussing a real experience, identified as the most recent, aimed to avoid theoretical discussions and prevent the selection of the most successful event. The inclusion of a maximum of eight interviews per country inhibited a full analysis of country-level specificities. Nonetheless, many of the themes emerged in multiple contexts, suggesting broader application.",

Whether the change originates within the NICU or from outside, it is advisable to involve all the staff concerned in its uptake, including listening to objections and criticisms and proposals for local adaptation. In case of innovation promoted by official agencies, early partnering with professional associations may be important. Clinical audits represent a powerful opportunity for change, particularly when carried out with a nonjudgemental, pragmatic attitude. Regular literature review meetings can promote the transfer of scientific findings into clinical practice. Actual participation in research studies can be an effective way to test innovations before adoption and monitor the outcomes. Overall, these strategies may represent interesting research hypotheses to be tested in future studies.",
