            "text": "It has been well recognized that many pathogens, mainly viruses and some bacteria, cause URTIs but present with almost indistinguishable clinical symptoms [1\u20133]. Differentiation of viral URTIs versus bacterial URTIs has the direct implication of antibiotics use. However, a lack of timely diagnosis by using rapid and accurate tests had contributed to overuse and abuse of antibiotics around the world [4]. In China, antibiotics abuse is very common due to a culture of self-medication (antibiotics are largely available over the counter) and over-prescription by clinicians [5, 6]. Antibiotics are mainly prescribed empirically, not based on microbiological investigation [6, 7]. This is particularly problematic for patients with URTIs, for which most clinics and many hospitals in China only offer limited routine tests for the influenza viruses (Flu). Common upper respiratory tract pathogens other than Flu, such as human rhinovirus (hRV), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), parainfluenza viruses (PIVs), adenovirus (ADV), human metapneumovirus (hMPV) and bacterial pathogens that are difficult to culture including Mycoplasma penumoniae, Chlamydophila pneumoniae and Bordetella pertussis are generally not tested in China, except for a few high-ranking academic medical centers (facts based on personal observations and communication with colleagues in China). Therefore, improving the accurate diagnosis of pathogens causing the URTIs (abbreviated as URTI pathogens in this article) is of great significance for rational selection of antibiotics and reduction of antibiotics abuse in China.",

            "text": "As one of the most densely populated provinces in China, Zhejiang has been the center of attention for emerging infectious diseases since the H7N9 bird flu outbreak first started there in early 2013 [8]. Since then, Chinese state and local government had implemented surveillance programs to actively monitor the circulating flu viruses. In one of such programs, hospitals and clinics routinely submit nasopharyngeal swabs of patients with fever and flu-like symptoms to the local public health laboratories for flu viruses testing by PCR and then genotyping by Sanger sequencing if positive. However, even during the peak of flu season, there are still many patients with fever and flu-like symptoms but tested negative for flu viruses. The question remains as what other respiratory pathogens are circulating and causing the similar flu-like symptoms, and what pathogens co-infect with flu virus in the Chinese community. Another important question is about the frequencies of bacterial pathogens such as M. pneumoniae, C. pneumoniae and B. pertussis that do require antibiotics treatment and how often they co-infect with viral pathogens. In addition, upper respiratory tract colonization of Streptococcus pneumoniae, the most common cause of bacterial pneumonia, was considered prerequisite for its infections in the lower respiratory tract [9]. Both the density and frequency of S. pneumoniae in the upper respiratory tract had been shown to increase during viral infections [10], but very limited data exist regarding the prevalence and density of S. pneumoniae colonization in patients with flu-like symptoms. A better understanding of the epidemiology of S. pneumoniae colonization and its relationship with the pathogens causing URTIs may help solve the controversy over using antibiotic prophylaxis to prevent possible secondary lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs) caused by S. pneumoniae, which is considered to be another inappropriate antibiotic prescription practice that could contribute to antibiotic resistance [11, 12].",

We found significantly increased S. pneumoniae colonization frequencies in both young children < 5 years old (21.6%) and the elderly > 65 years old (12.5%) compared to other age groups (4.2\u20137.3%) (Table 3). To investigate the relationship between S. pneumoniae colonization and URTI pathogens, we found there is a dose-dependent relationship between how many URTI pathogens were detected and the S. pneumoniae colonization frequency (Fig. 3 A). In cases without URTI pathogen detected, the S. pneumoniae colonization frequency was 6.8%, which increased to 10.1% when only one URTI pathogen was detected. This difference was with only borderline statistical significance (p = 0.061). However, in cases when more than one URTI pathogens were detected, the S. pneumoniae colonization frequency increased to 15.6% with a statistical significance (p = 0.028) (Fig. 3A). The increase of S. pneumoniae colonization frequency was found to be unrelated to the classification of the URTI pathogens since no statistically significant differences of S. pneumoniae colonization frequency were found among the case groups with viral-only, bacterial-only or bacterial + viral infections (Fig. 3B). To single out which URTI pathogen may contribute to this increase, we found although most URTI pathogens (except FluB, B. pertussis and C. pneumoniae) seem to be associated with higher S. pneumoniae colonization, the only statistically significant contributor was RSV infection (p = 0.026) (Fig. 3C). Without RSV infection, the S. pneumoniae colonization frequency was only 7.6%. With RSV infection, the frequency increased to 18.2%, more than 2 folds compared to the average S. pneumoniae colonization frequency (8.0%).",

The majority (81.7%) of the URTIs were of exclusive viral etiology, and only 18.3% were of bacterial etiology (bacteria alone or bacteria + viral co-infections). These findings added to a large body of evidence supporting the guidelines that recommend against antibiotics prescription to treat URTIs without accurate diagnosis [3]. The seasonality pattern of most high-prevalence pathogens including FluA, FluB, RSV, and M. pneumoniae largely overlapped, with much higher prevalence in winter and spring (January \u2013 April). The mechanisms for the seasonality of the respiratory pathogens remain unclear but a few possible driven factors have been suspected such as enhanced wintertime survival of pathogens due to lower temperature and lower humidity, increased travel and social gathering due to more holidays in winter, as well as weakened immunity associated with a lack of vitamin D [19]. Interestingly, the prevalence of the overall URTI pathogens and the S. pneumoniae colonization frequency both peaked in the months of January and February, suggesting a possible positive correlation between URTI infections and S. pneumoniae colonization frequency.",

Mixed infections with more than one URTI pathogens seemed to be associated with a significant increase of S. pneumoniae colonization frequency (from 6.8 to 15.6%). In addition, we identified RSV infection as the most significant contributor to the increased S. pneumoniae colonization frequency. The relationship between RSV infection and S. pneumoniae colonization have been recognized before. Studies have shown that RSV could enhance both the infectivity and virulence of S. pneumoniae [20, 21]. On the other hand, S. pneumoniae was found to enhance RSV infection both in vivo and in vitro [22]. S. pneumoniae colonization has also been linked to increased severity in children with RSV infections [23]. It should be noted that in our study, RSV is also associated with a higher percentage of co-infections (36.4%) compared to other URTI pathogens, which might be a confounding factor since we have demonstrated mixed infections itself could be associated with increased S. pneumoniae colonization frequency. Notably, our findings are novel as most other studies about the relationship between S. pneumoniae colonization and URTIs were limited to pediatric patients and viral infections, while our study included both viral and bacterial pathogens in patients of all ages. The biological mechanisms for the positive correlation between the S. pneumoniae colonization frequency and URTI pathogens require further investigation, which may help better understand the disease progression of URTIs and provide useful information for developing proactive monitoring protocols for high-risk patients.",

This is consistent with other studies showing that heavy S. pneumoniae colonization density is usually associated with more advanced lower respiratory streptococcal infections [10, 24]. However, we did find heavier density of S. pneumoniae colonization among elderly patients (> 65 years) regardless of detectable URTI pathogens, which combined with our finding that the S. pneumoniae frequency was also increased in this age group, provided consistent evidence to help explain why elderly patients are at higher risk of developing streptococcal pneumonia.",

            "text": "Importantly, we detected B. pertussis in 2 samples, both of which were also positive for other URTI viruses. This is particularly interesting because we only included patients with fever, which is not typically associated with B. pertussis infection [14]. Therefore, we might detect only a small fraction of B. pertussis cases with viral co-infections that presented with fever. The true prevalence of B. pertussis infection in this Chinese community is most likely underestimated. This is alarming since both B. pertussis positive cases were young adults in their childbearing age, who might transmit to their newborns. Although the vaccination coverage rate in China is estimated to be as high as 99%, surprisingly, 9% of the 24.1 million pertussis cases globally in 2014 were from China [25]. This is probably attributed to the shorter duration of protection by the acellular pertussis vaccines, which were introduced to China in 1995 [26] and had largely replaced the whole-cell pertussis vaccines since 2008 [27]. Recent studies have shown that the pertussis toxin IgG (a marker for the immunity) seropositive rate among the Chinese populations was as low as only 33% [28] and the misdiagnosis rate for pertussis in some areas was as high as 94.7% [29], highlighting the underrecognized severity of pertussis infections in China, and an urgency for improved diagnostic capacity, better surveillance system and vaccination strategies [30]. We plan to expand our molecular epidemiological study by using more appropriate criteria to include afebrile patients with prolonged non-productive cough [31, 32].",

            "text": "Our studies have several limitations. First, we did not detect coronaviruses, which are an important group of URTI pathogens and their prevalence can be as high as 5% in China [16]. However, this is not expected to change the conclusions that viral etiology dominated the URTIs, and S. pneumoniae colonization frequency increased in patients with detectable URTI pathogens. Second, we only included patients with fever, which may not be presented in many URTIs. The exclusion of afebrile patients could potentially lead to an underestimation of the true prevalence. Third, we did not test other pathogens including enterovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, cytomegalovirus and Group A Streptococcus that could also present with fever and flu-like symptoms [3, 33], which may partially explain the low positive rate during summer and fall. Fourth, we did not acquire the information about patient\u2019s antibiotic usage, which may impact the prevalence of bacterial pathogens as well as the density of S. pneumoniae in the upper respiratory tract. Last, we did not include a control group of healthy people as a comparison. It has been shown that asymptomatic carriage of respiratory viruses and M. pneumoniae are not uncommon, especially in children [34\u201336]. We plan to expand our study to survey more people in the community including both symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals.",

Co-infections were common and mainly involved the high frequency pathogens (FluA, RSV, hRV and M. pneumoniae). The seasonal patterns of the four most frequent pathogens (FluA, FluB, RSV and M. pneumoniae) overlapped and peaked during winter and spring (January to April), which also overlapped with the seasonal pattern of S. pneumoniae colonization in the upper respiratory tract. We also found a positive correlation between the S. pneumoniae colonization frequency (but not the density) and the number of URTI pathogens detected, in a pathogen variety-dependent manner. We observed higher S. pneumoniae colonization frequency in both the young children and the elderly, and higher S. pneumoniae colonization density in the elderly, regardless of whether URTI pathogens were detected or not. In addition, we found the majority of patients with URTIs had low S. pneumoniae colonization frequency and density, which is not indicative of Streptococcal lower respiratory infections.",

Alarmingly we found 2 cases of pertussis in two young adults both of which had viral co-infections. Our fever criteria could potentially lead to a serious underestimation of the true pertussis prevalence in the studied community. A better pertussis epidemiological study aiming at afebrile patient with prolonged non-productive cough should be taken to assess the true prevalence of pertussis, which have been shown to be on the rise in China and requires immediately attention. The diversity and complexity of the URTI pathogens detected in this Chinese community also highlighted the need to improve the diagnostic capacity for URTIs, particularly by using more molecular testing, to encourage a more evidence-based antibiotics prescription practice and to alleviate the drug resistance burden caused by a massive scale of antibiotic abuse and misuse in China.",
