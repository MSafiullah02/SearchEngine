A batch of final product can include several fractionation pools. Donor screening and testing of donations and fractionation pools are the first steps in product safety, followed by pathogen inactivation and/or removal (i.e., reduction) during manufacturing. Source plasma from apheresis commonly comes from compensated donors, while recovered plasma is from whole blood donors not compensated in cash.11, 12 The manufacturing process of clotting factor concentrates from both starting materials and their safety records are virtually identical.11, 12\n",

These measures include selection of donors, screening of donations and plasma pools for markers of infection with known viruses, and a manufacturing process with a high capacity to inactivate and/or remove viruses by selected steps validated for their virus reduction capacity. The guidelines state that \u201ceffective steps for the inactivation/removal of a wide range of viruses of diverse physicochemical characteristics\u201d are required during manufacture. Both the EMA and the World Health Organization (WHO) recommend that two distinct steps with complementary modes of action be used,10, 13 helping to ensure that any virus surviving Step 1 is inactivated and/or removed in Step 2. At least one step should inactivate or remove nonenveloped viruses. The EMA guideline further states that if a manufacturing process contains a step that reliably inactivates and/or removes a wide range of enveloped and nonenveloped viruses and additional manufacturing steps reliably contribute to inactivation and/or removal of viruses, the second step might not be required.10 In the United States, the manufacture of plasma\u2010derived products must include at least one effective step for removal and/or inactivation of viruses.14 Further, careful validation is required for each inactivation or removal step.

However, screening does not sufficiently ensure the safety of products, as tests have limits of detection and are target specific.13 In addition, the size of the minipool for NAT impacts its effectiveness.",

This has been highly effective in reducing the risk of donations from infected donors who are nonreactive in serology (and NAT) at the time of donation from entering a manufacturing pool.42 The inventory hold is not a quarantine, as it would not interdict an infectious unit in the NAT window period if the donor did not return. The effectiveness of the hold is related to the large number of donors who donate frequently. All source plasma donations used for manufacturing are equivalent to donations for transfusion in terms of pathogen safety. In addition to manufacturing standards, QSEAL includes qualified donor and virus marker standards identical to those in International Quality Plasma Program.41\n",

Additionally, manufacturing steps for plasma fractionation and virus removal, including precipitation, chromatography, and filtration (Table 4), have also proven efficacy in evaluation studies.6, 34, 75 Inactivation of prions in plasma\u2010derived clotting factor concentrates is not possible, as the needed techniques denature coagulation factors.33 Appropriate cleaning and sanitization methods for material and equipment used in the production of plasma\u2010derived products inactivate and remove prion proteins; thus, batch\u2010to\u2010batch segregation can be achieved and batch\u2010to\u2010batch contamination excluded.76, 77, 78, 79\n",

New emerging viruses may be novel, zoonotic viruses that are encountered as humans enter new geographic areas with previously undiscovered animal viruses that cross the species barrier to enter the human disease chain (e.g., HIV, yellow fever virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, Menangle virus, Hendra virus, Nipah virus, hantaviruses, monkeypox virus). Hepatitis E virus has been detected in different regions of the world and is considered a zoonosis; in particular, Genotype 3, mainly detected in domestic and wild pigs, has been found in humans in developed countries.80, 81 Human parvovirus 4 (PARV4) and related parvoviruses have been identified in cows, pigs, primates, and humans.82, 83, 84, 85, 86 Furthermore, a \u201cnew\u201d virus can emerge and/or reemerge in new geographic regions; for example, WNV was known in Africa and the Middle East but emerged in North America in 1999.87 Improved diagnostic methods have resulted in detection of previously unknown viruses (which should not be considered as emerging), such as B19V in 1975,88 HCV in 1989,89 human herpesvirus Type 8 in 1996,90 and TT virus in 1997.91 To meet this challenge, the epidemiology of emerging pathogens in the donor population and the potential infectious virus load in a donation during asymptomatic incubation must be addressed.

As shown in validation studies, a strategy involving different steps for inactivation and removal is optimal for targeting viruses with different physicochemical properties. For instance, although S/D is highly effective against enveloped viruses, it is ineffective against nonenveloped viruses (e.g., HAV and B19V); thus, a second step, often dry heating of the lyophilized product, is implemented. Procedures for purification and concentration of the desired protein are usually less effective in virus removal than dedicated reduction steps, such as inactivation by heat and S/D treatment or removal by virus filtration. As diagnostic techniques advance, emerging pathogens may be identified,92 and their genomes may be detected in the final product (e.g., PARV4), depending on the manufacturing process.96, 98 The methods employed make it extremely likely that any new pathogen would be inactivated or removed to a high degree, but diligence must be maintained.",
