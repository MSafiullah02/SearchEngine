There is no clear consensus sequence for protein palmitoylation that would allow the identification of potential addition sites by simple examination of the protein primary structure. The most practical approach is to determine if mutagenesis of the cysteine residues at or near the protein membrane anchor affects protein palmitoylation (Drisdel et al., 2006). Another distinctive feature of protein palmitoylation is that it is a reversible process. Indeed, specific enzymes that catalyze protein palmitoylation or depalmitoylation have been identified and characterized in yeast and human cells (see references in Drisdel et al., 2006).",

It has been shown that palmitoylation targets proteins to lipid rafts, specific membrane microdomains that are enriched in cholesterol and glycosphingolipids. This is the case of the influenza virus hemagglutinin which requires three palmitoylated cysteines for efficient association with lipid rafts (Melkonian et al., 1999) and of the luteinizing hormone receptor which localizes to lipid rafts only after palmitate addition to its C-terminus (Lei et al., 2005). Moreover, the reversibility of palmitate attachment to proteins has led to the proposal that this modification plays a critical role in the regulation of protein function and cell signaling, as it has been shown for cell surface receptors and ion channels (Chien et al., 1996, Drisdel et al., 2004).",

With respect to SIV, palmitic acid has been found to be attached to cysteine 787 in the cytoplasmic domain of the SIVmac239 Env glycoprotein (Yang et al., 1995). Cysteine 787 is at a distance of 71 residues from the C-terminus of the membrane anchor. The fact that HIV-1 and SIV Env proteins are palmitoylated at sites distantly located from the TM membrane-spanning domain may reflect that these primate lentiviral glycoproteins exhibit unusually long cytoplasmic tails, the structure of which has not as yet been resolved. HIV-1 possesses a TM cytoplasmic domain of 150 residues whereas that of SIV is 164 amino acids long.",

            "text": "For HIV-1, partially contradictory results have been reported regarding the effect on Env functions of eliminating the TM palmitoylation sites. Rousso et al. (2000) have shown that removal of both palmitoylation sites in the HIV-1 Env cytoplasmic domain results in decreased Env association with lipid rafts, inhibition of Env incorporation into virions and a 60-fold reduction in viral infectivity. Based on the fact that several infectious HIV-1 molecular clones do not contain cysteines in their Env cytoplasmic domains, two other groups further examined whether Env palmitoylation plays any role in viral infectivity. Using the HIV-1 NL4-3 strain, which conserves the cysteine residue at position 764 but exhibits a tyrosine at position 837, Bhattacharya et al. (2004) have shown that substitution of cysteine 764 and tyrosine 837 by serines or alanines inhibits Env localization in lipid rafts and reduces both Env incorporation and viral infectivity. However, HIV-1 Env mutants carrying at positions 764 and 837 amino acids with bulky hydrophobic side chains, such as phenylalanine and tyrosine, exhibit an infectivity capacity representing approximately 80% of that of wild-type viruses (Bhattacharya et al., 2004). In this regard, it should be emphasized that those HIV-1 isolates lacking cysteines in their Env cytoplasmic tails bear hydrophobic amino acids with bulky side chains at positions 764 and 837. Surprisingly, Chan et al. (2005) have reported that Cys-to-Ser mutations at HIV-1 Env positions 764 and 837 do not affect either Env cell surface expression or Env incorporation into virions. Moreover, this Env mutant virus efficiently replicates in CD4+ T cells (Chan et al., 2005).",

To examine the relevance of these membrane-proximal cysteines for Env biological properties, we performed a site-directed mutagenesis study in which we first replaced, alone or in combination, the conserved cysteine residues by serines and then analyzed the effect of these amino acid changes on Env-mediated viral functions.

Quantitation of the SU levels in the culture supernatants of cells expressing wild-type Env or mutant C815S and C804S/C811S glycoproteins showed an increase of 1.9\u00b10.1 and 2.4\u00b10.2 for the C815S and C804S/C811S mutants, respectively, when compared to wild-type Env (mean\u00b1SD, three independent assays).

This cell\u2013cell fusion assay is based on the facts that the FIV Petaluma isolate is independent of the CD134 primary receptor for cell entry (Shimojima et al., 2004) and that FIV can efficiently use human CXCR4 (Poeschla and Looney, 1998, Willett et al., 1997).",

When we examined the fusion ability of the mutant Env glycoproteins we found that mutations C804S and C811S significantly impaired Env fusogenicity. Indeed, mutant Env proteins C804S and C811S exhibited fusogenic capacities representing only 16% and 7.6%, respectively, of the wild-type value (\nTable 1). By contrast, mutation C815S allowed substantial Env fusion activity; mutant C815S retained 50% fusogenic capacity when compared to wild-type Env (Table 1). The most drastic effect on cell\u2013cell fusion was observed for the double (C804S/C811S and C811S/C815S) and triple (C804S/C811S/C815S) mutants. These amino acid substitutions almost abrogated Env fusogenicity (Table 1). It should be mentioned that the fusion assay used in these experiments is specific for the Env-CXCR4 interaction since addition of the CXCR4 antagonist AMD3100 (50 \u03bcg/ml) almost completely inhibits wild-type Env fusion activity (Table 1). Our results therefore demonstrate that, although mutation of any of the TM cysteines at positions 804, 811 and 815 reduces Env-mediated membrane fusion, replacement of cysteines 804 and 811 by serine is highly detrimental to this Env property.",

This technique is highly sensitive and specific for the quantitative analysis of molecules expressed on the cell surface (J\u00f3zefowski et al., 2011, Louren\u00e7o and Roque-Barreira, 2010). 293T cells expressing the wild-type or mutant Env glycoproteins were incubated first with the anti-SU monoclonal antibody (MAb) and then with a horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-coupled secondary antibody as described in \u201cMaterials and methods\u201d.

To this end, we applied a recently developed method that, based on the Click chemistry technology, allows the detection of palmitoylated proteins with high sensitivity and specificity (Charron et al., 2009, Martin and Cravatt, 2009). CrFK cells were transfected with the wild-type FIV proviral DNA and metabolically labeled with azide-conjugated palmitic acid. Cells were lysed and the FIV proteins were immunoprecipitated, eluted from the immunocomplexes and reacted with biotin-alkyne. As negative control, a sample of immunoprecipitated FIV proteins derived from metabolically labeled cells was not incubated with biotin-alkyne. The viral proteins were then resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane.\nFig. 5 shows that the FIV TM is modified by palmitoylation as inferred from its detection using HRP-conjugated streptavidin. The specificity of the reaction is demonstrated by the fact that the TM is visualized only in the protein sample that was incubated with biotin-alkyne (Fig. 5). Moreover, treatment of metabolically labeled samples with hydroxylamine (1 M; pH 7.5) before the immunoprecipitation step abrogates TM detection with streptavidin (data not shown).",

Cells were first lysed in Triton X-100 at 4 \u00b0C and then centrifuged so as to obtain the Triton-soluble material in the supernatant. The pellet was resuspended in \u03b2-octylglucoside, a detergent that disrupts lipid rafts, and centrifuged to recover the Triton-insoluble material in the supernatant. We found that the wild-type and mutant Env glycoproteins were mostly detected in the Triton X-100 insoluble fractions (\nFig. 7A). By contrast, when the Triton X-100 extraction was performed a 37 \u00b0C instead of 4 \u00b0C, the wild-type and mutant glycoproteins shifted from the insoluble to the soluble fraction (Fig. 7A). Of note, when using the same two-step detergent extraction method, we observed that the lipid raft marker flotillin-1 was recovered in the insoluble fraction, whereas the rough endoplasmic reticulum integral membrane glycoprotein rotavirus VP7 was solubilized by treatment with Triton X-100 at 4 \u00b0C (Fig. 7B). Interestingly, most of the FIV Gag protein was detected in the insoluble fraction (Fig. 7C). However, a nonmyristoylated FIV Gag, which we have previously shown to be incapable of plasma membrane binding (Manrique et al., 2001b), was found in the soluble fraction (Fig. 7C).

To this end, we constructed a series of single, double and triple mutants in which cysteines 804, 811 and 815 were replaced, alone or in combination, by serines. When these FIV Env mutants were phenotypically characterized, we found that they were all expressed and processed into the SU and TM subunits in a wild-type manner. By contrast, when we tested the fusogenic capacity of the TM cysteine mutants, we observed that substitution for serine of cysteines 804 or 811 drastically reduced the ability of these glycoproteins to mediate cell-to-cell fusion when compared with wild-type Env. A highly defective fusion phenotype was also demonstrated for the double mutant C804S/C811S and the triple mutant C804S/C811S/C815S. Interestingly, replacement of cysteine 815 by serine allowed Env fusion to proceed with an efficiency representing approximately 50% of that of wild-type Env. Taken together, our results clearly indicate that cysteines 804 and 811 are critical for FIV Env fusogenicity. It should be stressed that the defect in Env fusion imposed by the C804S and C811S mutations cannot be attributed to an impairment in Env transport to the plasma membrane since these mutant Env glycoproteins are readily detected at the cell surface at levels comparable to those of wild-type Env.",

            "text": "A crucial step in lentiviral morphogenesis is the incorporation of Env into the Gag-made budding virions. In the case of SIV, we have demonstrated by means of genetic, biochemical and pull-down experiments that Env packaging into viral particles results from a specific interaction between the Env cytoplasmic tail and the matrix domain of the Gag protein (Celma et al., 2001, Gonz\u00e1lez et al., 1996, Manrique et al., 2001a, Manrique et al., 2003, Manrique et al., 2008). The same mechanism operates in HIV-1 (Freed and Martin, 1996, Murakami and Freed, 2000). When we examined the ability of the most relevant FIV Env cysteine mutants generated in this study to associate with viral particles, we found that the substitution of cysteines 804, 811 or 815 by serine do not affect Env incorporation into virions. However, the double C804S/C811S and the triple C804S/C811S/C815S mutations abrogate Env packaging into particles. There are at least two possible explanations for the Env incorporation defect exhibited by the double and triple Env mutants. These amino acid substitutions may modify the structure of the FIV TM thereby impairing its association with Gag. Alternatively, the double C804S/C811S and the triple C804S/C811S/C815S mutations may alter the distribution of Env on the plasma membrane which in turn may prevent its recruitment into budding particles. However, the mutant Env glycoprotein lacking the three most membrane-proximal cytoplasmic cysteines is resistant to Triton X-100 extraction at low temperature, suggesting that this protein is associated with lipid rafts. The same behavior is exhibited by both wild-type Env and Gag. It is therefore likely that the triple mutant Env glycoprotein is not excluded from the virus assembly sites at the plasma membrane. The fact that removal of three of the four palmitoylation sites from the FIV Env glycoprotein does not appear to affect its cell surface distribution is in line with the results of Yang et al. (2010) showing that the two cytoplasmic palmitoylated cysteines in the HIV-1 Env protein are not involved in its association with lipid rafts. Instead, HIV-1 Env localization to detergent-resistant membrane domains is promoted by molecular determinants present within the C-terminal \u03b1-helix of the cytoplasmic tail (Yang et al., 2010).",

Therefore, mutations C804S/C811S and C804S/C811S/C815S are the first amino acid substitutions to be described for the FIV TM cytoplasmic domain that abrogate Env incorporation without affecting Env processing or cell surface expression.",

Namely, CrFK cells (grown in 35-mm-diameter dishes) were transfected in duplicate with wild-type or mutant proviral DNAs. At 48 h post-transfection, cells were incubated during 1 h in FBS-free DMEM after which cells were metabolically labeled with 100 \u03bcM palmitic acid-azide (Invitrogen) for 6 h in DMEM supplemented with 2.5% (v/v) FBS. Cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS and lysed as described above. Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with pooled sera from FIV-infected cats and immunocomplexes were eluted from the protein A-Sepharose beads by incubation at 80 \u00b0C during 15 min in buffer containing 50 mM Tris\u2013HCl (pH 8.0), 1% SDS, 1 mM PMSF and 10 \u03bcg/ml aprotinin. The eluates containing the FIV proteins were subjected to Click chemistry using the Click-iT Metabolic Labeling Reagents for Proteins (Invitrogen). The viral proteins obtained from one set of transfections were incubated with 20 \u03bcM biotin-alkyne (Invitrogen) in the presence of 2 mM CuSO4 as catalyst during 20 min at room temperature. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 3 volumes methanol, 0.75 volumes chloroform and 2 volumes water and centrifuged at 16,000g during 5 min. Proteins present in the interface layer were precipitated by the addition of methanol, centrifuged at 16,000g during 5 min. The protein pellets were air-dried and resuspended in non-reducing loading buffer. The other set of protein samples was treated likewise except that the biotin-alkyne reaction step was omitted. All samples were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes were first incubated with HRP-conjugated streptavidin to visualize the palmitoylated proteins and then reprobed with the mouse polyclonal anti-TM serum.",

(2008) but with several modifications. 293T cells were transfected with the wild-type, C804S or C804S/C811S/C815S proviral DNAs, and 48 h post-transfection cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS and lysed on ice for 5 min in a solution containing 0.2% Triton X-100, 50 mM Tris\u2013HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mM NaCl, 50 mM KCl, 10 mM MgCl2, 10 mM EGTA, 5 mM dithiothreitol and protease inhibitors. Cell lysates were then centrifuged at 16,000g for 60 min at 4 \u00b0C. The supernatants containing the detergent-soluble fractions were separated from the pellets corresponding to the Triton X-100 insoluble material. The pellets were resuspended in a lysis solution with a composition similar to that described above but containing 60 mM \u03b2-octylglucoside instead of Triton X-100. The samples were incubated on ice for 10 min and centrifuged as described above. The two sets of supernatants resulting from the two-step detergent extraction method were immunoprecipitated with pooled sera from FIV-infected cats, subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. FIV Env proteins were detected by Western blotting using the anti-SU MAb whereas FIV Gag was visualized with the MAb directed to the CA domain. Non-transfected 293T cells were subjected to the same two-step detergent extraction assay described above and the lipid raft-associated protein flotillin-1 was visualized in the resulting supernatants with a MAb (BD Biosciences) kindly provided by Eduardo Casta\u00f1o (Leloir Institute, Argentina). Rotavirus VP7 (SA11 strain) was expressed in 293T cells using a recombinant vaccinia virus as we have previously described (Celma et al., 2001) and detected by means of an anti-SA11 polyclonal rabbit serum. To express nonmyristoylated FIV Gag, we transfected 293T cells with a proviral DNA in which the codon for the glycine residue at position 2 in the gag open reading frame was mutated to alanine (Manrique et al., 2001b).",
