As a result, tissue damage, inflammation, repair and remodeling are constant. These processes, from the induction of apoptosis and necrosis in acute injury to the defense mechanisms of inflammatory cells, coagulation and fibrinolysis, to extracellular matrix degradation and cell migration, are all peptidase driven. Peptidase inhibitors are required to regulate these processes and neutralize peptidases upon completion of their intended roles. Most pulmonary diseases are associated with an imbalance between peptidase and peptidase inhibitor activity (Table 1). This holds true in the neonate at risk for a specific set of dysfunctional lung pathologies, including meconium aspiration syndrome (MAS), respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) and bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). The balance between peptidase and antipeptidase activities appears critical in the development and progression of these diseases of premature and full-term newborns. Serpins (serine peptidase inhibitors) make up the major source of peptidase inhibitors in the lung. Others peptidase inhibitors include Kunitz, Kazal and Bowman-Birk protein families. Unlike the other peptidase inhibitors, serpin inhibition occurs at a 1:1 stoichiometry. Importantly, peptidase inhibition by serpins is irreversible. The purpose of this review is to describe the general mechanism and regulation of serpin function in the lung. Critical roles in the normal and pathological lung, and serpins as potential therapeutic agents are examined.",

They are distinguished from other peptidase inhibitors because their unique suicide substrate-like mechanism of inhibition (reviewed in Gettins1, 2). A total of 37 serpin genes in humans are distributed within 9 clades (A\u2013I). Clade A has 13 members including SERPINA1 (\u03b11-antitrypsin, \u03b11AT) and SERPINA5 (protein C inhibitor, PCI) that are secreted into the circulation. Clade B is made up of 13 serpins that are primarily intracellular. The remaining eleven serpins are dispersed across clades C\u2013I and are secreted into the fluid phase. The tertiary structure of serpins is highly conserved and consists of three \u03b2-sheets (A\u2013B), 7 to 9 \u03b1-helices (A\u2013I) and extended reactive site loop (RSL) that acts as the bait for peptidase targets. The structure is critical to the unique suicide-substrate-like mechanism of peptidase inhibition.3 Inhibitory serpins exist in a metastable state resembling a loaded mousetrap. Upon peptidase binding to the RSL, hydrolysis of the P1\u2013P1\u2032 peptide bond releases the RSL and allows the serpin to undergo a rapid conformational transition. With the peptidase covalently bound to the P1 residue, the RSL is inserted into \u03b2-sheet A as strand 4 and the peptidase is trapped in an inactive complex with the serpin.",

Amino-acid residues Met-Ser at the P1\u2013P1\u2032 position within the RSL make \u03b11AT a potent inhibitor of neutrophil elastase (NE), cathepsin G (catG) and proteinase-3 (Table 1).9 In the lung, NE is capable of causing extensive damage because of its proteolytic activity against structural components collagen and elastin. During inflammation large amounts of this peptidase are delivered to the lung. Infiltrating neutrophils express catG on the cell surface and release peptidases including NE into the airway space. The primary role of \u03b11AT is to maintain a local balance between peptidase activities required for inflammatory cell function and to protect the lung against peptidase-mediated tissue damage.10",

It has been proposed that the P1-Met residue in the RSL renders \u03b11AT sensitive to inactivation by oxidation from tobacco smoke exposure and the reactive oxygen burst released by neutrophils (reviewed in Carrell10). Accordingly, \u03b11AT*ZZ individuals who smoke exhibit a rapid onset of emphysema, often by 30 years of age, and death by the age of 50.15 However, most \u03b11AT*ZZ individuals who avoid smoking live normal length lives with minimal complications. Replacement therapy for \u03b11AT deficiency, with intravenous \u03b11AT from pooled human plasma, results in longer survival. Data compiled by the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute indicate that \u03b11AT serum levels and lung function are improved with \u03b11AT replacement therapy.16 However, plasma is limited and therapy expensive. Gene therapy is an alternative toward which much progress been made in animal models.17, 18 Synthetic small molecule peptidase inhibitors are also being developed as a tool to counteract imbalances in peptidase activity (reviewed in Chughtai and O'Riordan19). On the basis of nature of \u03b11AT deficit caused by polymerization, another therapeutic strategy is to prevent polymerization and facilitate \u03b11AT secretion from the liver. This may be accomplished using small molecules interacting with \u03b11AT directly or by enhanced chaperone function.20, 21, 22",

In a second study, 4 weeks of treatment with recombinant \u03b11AT (r\u03b11AT) made in sheep produced significant decreases in neutrophil infiltration, and reduced complexes between NE and endogenous \u03b11AT, suggesting that r\u03b11AT was effective in neutralizing endogenous NE.27 Favorable results have also been collected from nebulized \u03b11AT therapy studies in animal models.28 Together these results suggested that \u03b11AT aerosol treatment would benefit CF patients. However, it will be important to examine in detail the mechanism by which \u03b11AT inhibited inflammation and cytokine production.",

A direct result of underdeveloped lungs and respiratory system, therapy includes oxygen and mechanical ventilation, and surfactant replacement. Even with improved oxygen saturation monitoring and ventilation, unavoidable acute lung injury (ALI) adds to the severity of RDS. Infants born prematurely frequently go on to develop BPD. Prematurity is the primary risk factor for BPD, followed by oxygen toxicity and ventilation induced lung damage (reviewed in Jobe and Ikegami29 and Chess et al.30). The \u2018new\u2019 BPD pathology consists of arrested alveolar development, resulting in decreased total alveoli, and abnormal vasculature localization observed in the lung periphery. Inflammatory cytokines have been associated with accelerated lung maturation.29 Serine peptidases, released from inflammatory cells, caused epithelial cell injury and lung remodeling that is associated with RDS and BPD.31 In the neonate the balance between elastase and elastase inhibitor activity has been associated with lung injury and progression to BPD.32 In addition to \u03b11AT, low molecular mass inhibitor secretory leukocyte peptidase inhibitor (SLPI) was found to be important in neutralizing NE in tracheal aspirates of infants born prematurely.33 Watterberg et al.34 found that SLPI increases in the tracheal lavage of RDS, whereas neonates going on to develop BPD had a significantly higher elastase to elastase-inhibitor ratio. Sveger et al.35 also reported significant correlations with BPD development and low levels of inhibitors \u03b11AT and ACT (SERPINA3) in tracheobronchial aspirate of preterm infants at 3 to 4 days of age, and low SLPI at 7 to 8 days of age. Two trials assessed the effect of \u03b11AT therapy in preterm infants on recovery from RDS and development of BPD.36, 37 A meta-analysis of the two trials found that although a trend for reduced risk of oxygen dependency after 28 days existed, no significant difference was observed between groups receiving \u03b11AT therapy and placebo for risk of BPD or long-term neurodevelopmental abnormalities.38",

Zagariya et al.43 hypothesized that \u03b11AT in the lungs of neonates may attenuate meconium aspiration-induced lung injury. As has been observed in \u03b11AT deficiency and CF patients, the absence of adequate anti-elastase activity associated with \u03b11AT resulted in extensive pulmonary damage.

The balance between PA and PAI-1 activities determines local fibrinolysis (Table 1). Diseases of acute inflammation, such as ALI and acute respiratory distress (ARDS) (reviewed in Ware and Matthay44), and fibrotic diseases like idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF)45 share a common pathology of fibrin deposition in the alveolar compartment. To determine the best approach for treatment and prevention of these related diseases, it is important to identify the source of imbalanced fibrinolysis resulting in fibrin deposition. As the main inhibitor of fibrinolysis, PAI-1 is expressed by several cell types found in the lung and is modulated by inflammatory cytokines and tissue damage. Elevated levels of PAI-1 were observed in alveolar macrophages from patients with ARDS46 and IPF.45 An investigation of PAI-1, uPA and tPA levels in preterm infants with RDS also identified elevated ratios of PAI-1 to uPA protein in tracheal aspirate fluid.47 Elevated PAI-1 in BAL fluid occurred in bacterial pneumonia.48, 49 Excessive PAI-1 levels were observed in ARDS and severe pneumonia cases requiring mechanical ventilation.50 These findings supported the hypothesis that PAI-1 is a critical regulator of fibrin deposition in the alveolar space in response to ALI. Further support for this theory was gained from animal models of lung injury, including bacterial endotoxin,51 and bleomycin52 models of ALI. These studies established PAI-1, its activity and its regulation, as a critical target for therapies treating the family of diseases displaying poor lung function associated with fibrin deposition including ALI, ARDS and COPD.",

This induces a conformational switch putting the RSL in a more favorable position for serine peptidase binding.57 Heparin molecules longer than 26 residues further accelerate peptidase inhibition through interactions with the peptidase. Defects in ATIII function primarily result in complications relating to thrombosis. However, a protective role of ATIII has been experimentally demonstrated in animal models of sepsis58 and ischemia reperfusion of grafted lungs.59 Recombinant ATIII (rATIII) at elevated levels resulted in reduced to complete inhibition of pulmonary vascular permeability associated with endotoxin treatment.58 In a lung transplant model, lungs were stored for 28 h with normal saline, then transplanted into dogs receiving ATIII or vehicle alone. Transplant animals treated with ATIII exhibited no change in O2 partial pressure, alveolar\u2013arterial O2 difference or pulmonary vascular resistance for up to 3 h.59 These encouraging results suggested that ATIII might be used to treat sepsis-related lung dysfunction, ARDS and ALI resulting from ischemia.",

However, Waydas et al.63 found no difference in the duration of organ failure. A single large trial of 2314 patients with severe sepsis produced inconsistent results.65 One group in this trial, receiving ATIII but not heparin, exhibited an increased 90-day survival rate compared with placebo. It was also observed that new pulmonary dysfunction was decreased in the group receiving rATIII therapy. Unfortunately, no critical trials have been performed to date specifically with ALI or ARDS patients to test ATIII or heparin therapy. Overall, improvement in fibrin deposition and lung function observed with ATIII in animal models of sepsis and ALI is promising but is unconfirmed in humans.",

In humans, PCI is a plasma protein, present at a concentration of \u223c100 nM and a half-life of \u223c23 h.71 PCI is found in many other body fluids and secretions, and in a wide range of tissues.

Expression of mouse PCI was limited to the male and female reproductive systems.72 Homozygous-null PCI-knockout mouse appeared normal except male sterility was observed.72 Limited endogenous PCI in the mouse allowed a unique approach to model human PCI pulmonary function. Hayashi et al.73 expressed hPCI in mice from a transgene consisting of the human PCI gene contained within 25 kb of human genomic DNA. hPCI protein in these transgenic (Tg) animals was found to be an active inhibitor of APC, and expressed in a pattern similar to humans. This hPCI Tg animal system may be used as a tool to further explore PCI function in the lung under physiological and pathological conditions, as well as to test the therapeutic effect of human APC in vivo. Nishi et al.74 used the hPCI Tg mouse to identify a role for PCI in pulmonary hypertension. Monocrotaline treatment was used to specifically induce pulmonary hypertension. A significant increase in right ventricular pressure was observed in treated wild-type (WT) control mice compared to hPCI Tg animals. BAL fluid levels of thrombin\u2013antithrombin complex, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, platelet-derived growth factor and IL-13, and the plasma level of TNF\u03b1 were significantly increased in treated WT mice compared to hPCI Tg animals.74 This study established that PCI in the lung is protective against monocrotaline-induce hypertension. Furthermore, it suggested that PCI fulfills both anti-inflammatory and anticoagulant activities in the lung.74, 75 To take advantage of PCI therapeutically it will be important to determine which activities as a serine peptidase inhibitor are protective in specific physiological conditions.",

Cells exposed to reactive oxygen succumb to necrosis or apoptosis following lysosomal damage and release of its cysteine peptidases into the cytosol (reviewed in Lockshin and Zakeri101 and Guicciardi et al.102).

Their localization within the lung makes them primary targets for the development of therapeutic agents, from simple replacement by inhalation, to recombinant gene transfer and development of small molecule inhibitors that mimic their activity. In the case of \u03b11AT, this serpin inhibits a limited number of elastolytic peptidases. In diseases associated with excess elastase activity (empysema, CF), replacement therapy appears very promising. In contrast, ATIII and PCI are multi-peptidase inhibitors and their local active concentration in vivo is likely critical to properly balancing the function of specific peptidase targets. To modulate the activity of these serpins therapeutically, we may take advantage of the endogenous mechanisms regulating their activity, interactions with glycosaminoglycans and conformational changes in structure. Alternatively, extensive success has been met using recombinant APC, a PCI target peptidase, in the treatment of sepsis and ALI.",

In their absence, cellular injury would lead to cellular stress and death. SERPINB9, the only inhibitor of GzmB in humans, is required for CTL survival, and therefore host defense against some viral infections. SERPINB3 and SERPINB4, expressed in BEC, are poised to protect the bronchial airways against both exogenous and endogenous serine and lysosomal cysteine peptidases. In lung epithelium, this antipeptidase shield is very important due to repeated exposure to neutrophil-derived serine peptidases and oxidative stress accompanying inflammation in response to pulmonary injury or infection.
