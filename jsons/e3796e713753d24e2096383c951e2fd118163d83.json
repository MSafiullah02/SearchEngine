One of the important goals in facing outbreaks of COVID-19 is to reduce the case fatality rate. We reported here that the fatality rate of COVID-19 in other provinces of mainland China was 0.82% (121/14708), significantly lower than 6.62% (4512/68128) in Hubei province (p<0.0001). The main reason for the lower fatality rate was likely due to the timely management of the patients in other provinces, highlighting the importance of timely management of patients in reducing the fatality rate of COVID-19.",

Since then, COVID-19 has spread in whole China as well as other countries. Although World Health Organization (WHO) declared the outbreak of COVID-19 as Public Health Emergency of International Concern on January 30, 2020 [3] [4] [5] , COVID-19 has spread to more than 200 other countries and territories in the world, leading to nearly 2.88 million confirmed cases and an overall fatality rate 6.9% by April 27, 2020 [6] , whereas as of February 1, 2020, just 24 countries had 11953 confirmed patients (11821 in China) [7] . Since COVID-19 is still being spread, the most critical task now is to control the transmission. Another important goal in facing COVID-19 is to reduce the fatality rate.",
