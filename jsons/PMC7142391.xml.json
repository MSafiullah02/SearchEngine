DO NOT ADMIT COVID-19 positive patients and suspected cases to the outpatient department or the oncology floor. Refer suspected and infected cases to COVID-19 specialized departments and services for management.2.Prioritization of patients by favoring curative therapies versus palliative, application of therapy pause when justified and limiting chemotherapy and immunotherapy for patients with poor prognosis. We are recommending discussions with all patients with advanced disease regarding additional risks versus benefits of further lines of therapy.3.Avoid overcrowded clinics (by deferring regular routine follow-up to over-the phone consultations) and chemotherapy units by decreasing the number of patients receiving weekly chemotherapy versus more spaced regimens where possible, consider switch to oral chemotherapy to be taken at home when possible versus intravenous treatment.4.Separation or \u2018sanctuarization\u2019 of the oncology department: withhold any immunosuppressive treatment of patients diagnosed to have COVID-19/high risk for development of disease until full recovery. Admission of COVID-19 positive should be done in specialized departments.5.Manage patients in need of supportive care and palliation through phone calls to keep them safe at home.",
