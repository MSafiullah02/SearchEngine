They have never been reported in Senegal until recently during a study in arbovirus emergence with the detection of a new species of MESOV named Dianke virus (DKV) from common mosquitoes from eastern Senegal. Actually, their vector competence for this newly described DKV is unknown. We, therefore, estimated the vector competence of Culex tritaeniorhynchus, Culex quinquefasciatus, Aedes aegypti, and Anopheles gambiae mosquitoes collected in Senegal for DKV using oral infection. Whole bodies, legs/wings, and saliva samples were tested for DKV by RT-PCR to estimate infection, dissemination, and transmission rates. The infectivity of virus particles in the saliva was confirmed by infecting C6/36 cells. Virus transmission rates were up to 95.45% in Culex tritaeniorhynchus, 28% in Cx. quinquefasciatus and 9.09% in Aedes aegypti. Viral particles in the saliva were confirmed infectious by C6/36 cell culture. An. gambiae was able to disseminate DKV only at 20 days post-infection. This study shows that Culex mosquitoes are more competent than Ae. aegypti for DKV, while Anopheles gambiae is not likely a competent vector.",

The discovery of Nam Dinh [1] and Cavally [2] viruses in Vietnam and C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, respectively, resulted in the addition of a fourth family named the Mesoniviridae, in reference to their medium-sized genomes (about 20 kb) [3] . The viral particles are enveloped, 60-80 nm diameter spheres with club-shaped surface spikes [4] . Their 20 kb genome is generally organized as ORF1a-ORF1b-ORF2a-ORF2b-ORF3a-ORF3b-ORF4 [5] . ORF1a and ORF1b are predicted to encode two polymerase polyproteins (pp), while the ORFs in the 3'-end encode structural proteins such as the spike (S) glycoprotein (ORF2a), the nucleocapsid (N) protein (ORF2b), and two proteins with membrane-spanning regions (ORF3a and -3b) [1, 2] .",

ISVs were also found in sandflies [7] and chironomids, indicating that they can also infect other dipterans. An increasing number of arthropod-specific viruses (ASVs) are being discovered in haematophagous arthropods over the world [8] , and there is a growing interest on mesoniviruses interactions with viruses of public health concern to develop strategies that could curb arbovirus transmission through dual infection and competition, as implemented with the Wolbachia mediated strategy [9] . Some studies suggested for instance that ISVs negatively affect the fitness of West Nile (WNV) [10] [11] [12] and dengue (DENV) [13, 14] viruses in the mosquito, while other studies demonstrated that there is no effect [15] or even an enhancing effect [11] . However, there are still few studies on mesoniviruses phenotypic behaviour in mosquito vectors.",

Briefly, Continuous cells lines, initially provided by the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC), were cultured in Leibovitz-15 (L-15) medium (GibcoBRL, Grand Island, NY, USA) supplemented with 10% foetal bovine serum (FBS) (Gibco BRL, Grand Island, NY, USA) and penicillin-streptomycin (Sigma, GmBh, Germany) and 10% of Bacto\u2122 Tryptose Phosphate Broth (Becton, USA) and maintained in 25-cm 2 tissue culture flasks. The medium was removed from the flasks before adding of 150 \u00b5l of the supernatant of the virus directly into monolayers C6/36 cells. After 1 h of incubation at room temperature, infected cells were recovered by 5 ml of L-15 medium supplemented with 5% FBS and incubated at 28\u00b0C until cytopathic effect (CPE). After harvesting, infected cells supernatants were aliquoted, frozen at \u221280\u00b0C, and used as viral stocks for mosquito infection. The virus stock was prepared and titrated using C6/36 cell lines.

The low sample sizes of engorged females of Culex mosquitoes led us to test Cx. tritaeniorhynchus at 7, 10, and 15 dpi and Cx. quinquefasciatus only at 15 dpi. Mosquitoes were cold-anaesthetized, and their legs and wings removed and transferred individually into separate tubes. Saliva was collected by inserting the proboscis of each mosquito into a capillary tube containing 1-2 \u03bcl of FBS for 30 min. After salivation, each mosquito body (whole body except legs and wings) and saliva sample was placed in a separate tube. Detection of DKV in the mosquito body without infection of the legs, which contain haemolymph, is an indication of a non-disseminated infection limited to the midgut, whereas the presence of virus in both the mosquito body and legs indicates a disseminated infection with virus in the haemocoel. The mosquito bodies, legs/wings, and saliva were stored separately at \u221280\u00b0C until real-time RT-PCR could be performed. The infectiousness of positive saliva samples was tested with C6/36 cell cultures. The samples were crushed and homogenized in 500 \u03bcl of L-15 cell culture medium (GibcoBRL, Grand Island, NY, USA) containing 20% FBS and were then centrifuged for 10 min at 7500 rpm at 4\u00b0C to separate virus supernatant and debris. For realtime PCR, 100 \u03bcl of supernatant was used for RNA extraction using the QIAamp Viral RNA Extraction Kit (QIAgen, Heiden, Germany), according to the manufacturer's protocol. The RNA was amplified using ABI Prism 7000 SDS Real-Time apparatus (Applied BioSystems, Foster City, CA, USA) with the QuantiTect kit (QIAgen) and the pan Mesonivirus system as previously described [16] . The reaction mixture consisted of 5 \u03bcl of extracted RNA, 10 \u03bcl of buffer (2 X QuantiTect Probe), 6.8 \u03bcl of RNase free water, 1.25 \u03bcl of each primer, forward and reverse, 0.5 \u03bcl of probe, and 0.2 \u03bcl of enzymes to a total volume of 25 \u03bcl.

One should note that DKV transmission to human or another vertebrate could occur during feeding, even if ISVs are characterized by their incapacity to replicate in vertebrate cells. The ISVs host range restriction could occur at different steps of the viral cycle, as Junglen et al. [37] showed a blocking at both attachment/ entry as well as at the assembly /release level in vertebrate cells. The restriction mechanisms are still not very well understood even if it was reported that ISVs are more sensitive to high-temperature effects than the arboviruses [38] . It was then observed for DKV in vitro replication, which was impacted by thermal conditions [16] . It is also pointed out that the innate immune system in vertebrate cells can strongly restrict ISVs replication as described by Tree et al. [39] . In this study, knockdown of some pattern recognition receptors led to the replication of the ISV Kamiti River virus in both Vero and A549 cells, suggesting to that several of these receptors are important in the detection and control of ISVs in vertebrate cells. Some studies showed evolutionary relationship between ISVs and arboviruses, suggesting that arboviruses could have been ISVs that later acquired the ability to expand their host-range to also include vertebrates [40] . Mesoniviruses share structural and genetic similarities to other vertebrates replicating Nidovirales [6] . Previous phylogenetic studies suggested that the coronaviruses and other viruses of the order may have evolved in arthropods [1, 4] . The evolutionary process from ISVs to, at least, dual host viruses probably require a long period of time for adaptation before the occurrence of an ancestral host switching.",

            "text": "Our work highlights the potential transmission of DKV to vertebrate through anthropophilic mosquito biting. Only the main arboviruses vectors were DKV competent while the malaria vector An. gambiae was not. The possibility of horizontal DKV transmission proved in this study highlights that DKV crosses all compartments within mosquito-like arboviruses. This shows potential interaction between DKV and arboviruses that can lead to different issues. For instance, it has been shown that dual viral infections in mosquito can alter viral infectivity [47] and ISVs are more and more considered as potential disease control agents in vector populations [40, 48] . Virus restriction phenotypic could be more complex as Parry and Asgari [49] highlighted that restriction of Dengue virus replication in Ae.aegypti mosquitoes could be hindered by interactions between Aedes anphevirus (AeAV) a novel ISV and the endosymbiotic bacterium Wolbachia pipientis. In contrast, Zhang et al. [50] pointed out that Cell fusing agent virus, another ISV, favour Dengue virus replication in Ae.aegypti cell lines. Based on these considerations, the issue of DKV interactions with arboviruses circulating in our subregion requires further studies. Ae. aegypti could be a good target for co-infection studies involving mesonivirus and arboviruses with real impact on public health due to the important role that the species is playing as a vector of major arboviruses of public health interest. Moreover, DKV could be a good model to study host switching from naturally infected mosquitoes to vertebrate organisms.",
