This type of network has the property that the basic reproductive ratio, which is found to be proportional to the second moment of the degree distribution \u2329k2\u232a, diverges in the limit of infinite populations, leading to the absence of an epidemic threshold.

There have, to our knowledge, been no directly comparable studies of this kind. Perhaps those closest have been, first the study of finite-size scaling of the SIS model near the critical point to produce a phenomenological one-dimensional SDE [24], second, the derivation of a one-dimensional SDE for the SIS model from first principles, but using an adiabatic approximation that would only be expected to hold near the critical point [25], and finally the study of a four-dimensional SDE for the SIR model on a static network that is much more complex than ours and less amenable to analysis [26].",

In order to determine these in the general heterogeneous case, we look first at the homogeneous case, where K=1. If we set an initial condition with only a few infective individuals in an almost completely susceptible population, we will have i(\u03c4=0)=i0\u226a1 and s(\u03c4=0)=s0\u223c1, where s=s1 and i=i1; with this, the N\u2192\u221e limit of Eq.

While the new variables \u03b8 and \u03bb are justified mathematically through the fact that they simplify the equations, they also have a physical interpretation. For the case of \u03b8, this is related to the recently introduced concept of a test node [12,37], which plays an analogous role in epidemic dynamics to the concept of a test charge in electrostatics. If we introduce a single initially susceptible individual with one link into the system, and assume that the population is so large that this individual has negligible influence on the epidemic dynamics, then \u03b8(\u03c4) is the probability that such a \u201ctest node\u201d has avoided infection at time \u03c4. The quantity \u03bb is related to the force of infection that is defined in epidemiology as the per-capita rate at which susceptible individuals become infective [10]. Our \u03bb(\u03c4) is the network generalization of this, being instead the per-link rate at which susceptible individuals become infective at time \u03c4. We therefore argue that where a nonnetwork SIR epidemic can have its dynamics represented in phase space with coordinates (s(\u03c4),i(\u03c4)), for the network model the physically relevant coordinates, designed to account for link heterogeneity, are (\u03b8(\u03c4),\u03bb(\u03c4)).",

Before starting the actual treatment of the model, we visualize its dynamics to find whether the system evolves toward a lower-dimensional subspace, as it does in the deterministic case. Figure 2 also shows three-dimensional projections of stochastic trajectories from Eqs. (31) and (8), for a total population of N=105. The behavior is found indeed to be similar to that of the deterministic case: the dynamics seems to quickly reach, and then fluctuate around, the deterministic slow subspace, with the early behavior dominated by the deterministic dynamics. Therefore, we expect that we should be able to effectively reduce the stochastic system from (K+1) dimensions to two dimensions, by neglecting the fast initial behavior of the epidemic.",

First, the existence of a (K\u22121)-fold degenerate eigenvalue equal to \u2212\u03b3 throughout the time evolution also means that stochastic trajectories, as well as deterministic ones, which venture out of the slow subspace will tend to be pushed back into the plane. Thus, we would expect the reduced set of SDEs to be a good approximation throughout the motion, and not just at late times. This may be the reason why the approximation works well even if \u03b5 is not particularly small. Second, in retrospect, the elimination of the fast variables in the stochastic system is not strictly necessary, since the SDEs previously obtained in Sec. III are recovered, and \u03c3\u00af3 could be found in terms of \u03b8 and \u03bb using Eq. (43) obtained from the elimination of fast variables in the deterministic system. One can compare the value of \u03c3\u00af3 in terms of the ik to the one in terms of \u03bb in the deterministic limit and see that, indeed, the approximation is not very good for moderate to large values of \u03b5.

In this case, if \u03c1>1, so that an epidemic starts to grow, the dynamics is pushed away from the line (\u03b8,0,...,0) in its early stages, as can be seen from Fig. 2, where the trajectories leave the vicinity of the absorbing state after reaching the slow subspace.",

For each pair of individuals in the population, we pick whether infection will be spread between them if one becomes infective and draw a link between them if it will. This forms a static graph, and if we pick a node of the graph to be initially infective, then the size of the epidemic will be the size of the network component that the initial pick is part of. This means that the size of the giant component of the graph is equal to the final size of the epidemic if it is large, and the probability of early extinction is equal to the proportion of the population in the small components of this graph. Therefore, we can conclude that we have already calculated the probability of early extinction of the epidemic starting with an individual picked uniformly at random from a very large population; it will be equal to \u2211ksk*=G(\u03b8*).",

The first of these is the size of the population, N, which is proportional to the dimensionality of the microscopic description. For large populations, this motivates the derivation of a mesoscopic model based on a diffusion approximation whose errors are controlled by inverse powers of N, and which we have formulated in this paper. The second of these is the maximum degree K, which is proportional to the dimensionality of the full mesoscopic model. We have been able to use fast-mode elimination techniques to derive two-dimensional approximations to this scheme: the reduced mesoscopic model, which involves three white-noise processes; and the semideterministic mesoscopic model, which involves only one white-noise process.",
