            "text": "Infection with the novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, leads to development of the syndrome COVID-19 [2]. The clinical manifestations of infection range from entirely asymptomatic to severe respiratory failure and death [3]. The SARS-CoV-2 virus infects the host using the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor [4]. The ACE2 receptor is a membrane-bound aminopeptidase expressed in numerous organs such as the lung, brain, intestines, and heart [5,6]. Published reports of histopathological examination of lung tissue describe alveolar and interstitial exudative inflammation with macrophage and monocyte predominance, as well as focal respiratory epithelial desquamation, hemorrhage, and type 2 pneumocyte proliferation [7,8]. Patients may develop a hyperinflammatory syndrome with a cytokine profile similar to secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis [9]. An unusual clinical picture has emerged in some patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection: the development of hypoxia that is out of proportion to the patient's symptoms. This has been called silent or apathetic hypoxia [10,11]. Gattinoni et al. proposed that this clinical picture may represent a phenotype of COVID pneumonia (Type L), where there is low elastance and near normal compliance. The alternative phenotype, Type H, is similar to what is seen in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) [12]. In contrast, Ziehr et al. described a cohort of patients intubated early in the disease process. This cohort had low compliance and a uniform presentation consistent with the Berlin definition for ARDS [13]. Undoubtedly, our understanding of the respiratory mechanics found in COVID-19 will continue to evolve as additional research is reported. In the following case summary, we describe a patient who presented with minimal symptoms but was found to have a dramatic decrease in oxygen saturation.",

Three weeks prior to presentation the patient was diagnosed with influenza based on clinical symptoms and treated with oseltamivir. The patient reports that his symptoms continued to be mild with cough productive of minimal blood-tinged sputum. He denied having fevers, myalgias, headache, diarrhea, or loss of taste or smell. On the day of presentation, the patient was visited by his daughter who felt that he was having difficulty breathing. On arrival to the patient's house, paramedics found him to have an oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 85% with normal respiratory rate and effort. The patient was given supplemental oxygen and brought to the emergency department (ED). On arrival to the ED, his vital signs were as follows: blood pressure, 118/77 mm Hg; heart rate, 80 beats/min; respiratory rate, 14 breaths/min; SpO2 88% on room air, and temperature, 38.8 \u00b0C. On examination, he was in no acute distress and conversant with unlabored speech. His breath sounds were unremarkable. The remainder of his examination was absent of any acute abnormality. Supplemental oxygen via non-rebreather mask at 15 L/min was administered as well as albuterol via metered dose inhaler. His oxygen saturation improved to 97% after these interventions.",
