            "text": "The Coxsackieviruses group B consist of six serotypes are members of the genus Enterovirus within the Picornaviridae viral family (Hyypi et al., 1997, Reetoo et al., 2000, Oberste et al., 2004, Knipe and Howley, 2007) that are associated with a wide spectrum of human illness ranging in severity from subclinical infection to rapidly fatal disease, with symptoms as diverse as acute myocarditis, bornholm disease (epidemic pleurodynia), aseptic meningitis, encephalitis, and febrile illness (Reetoo et al., 2000). Coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) has been recognized as the predominant cause of viral myocarditis in humans, which accounts for more than fifty percent viral myocarditis cases (Shen et al., 2009). The mechanisms of viral myocarditis include direct myocyte injury and subsequent immune-mediated damage of the heart (Yuan et al., 2010). The CVB3 genome is 7400 nucleotides in length and consist a positive single stranded RNA flanked by non-translated regions that encodes 11 proteins within a single open reading frame (Michable et al., 1987, Tracy et al., 1995, Tracy et al., 1997, Dunn et al., 2000). The positive genomic RNA of Enterovirus can be employed directly as an mRNA template for translation of a single polyprotein that processed into 11 mature proteins. Also genomic RNA is employed as a template for viral RNA transcription and synthesizes more copies of genomic RNA by a negative-strand intermediate RNA (Bedard and Semler, 2004, Yuan et al., 2005, Van Ooij et al., 2006, Chang et al., 2010). The viral genome is packaged in a naked capsid approximately 29 nm in diameter (Drescher et al., 2004). The capsid of CVB3, like that of other Enteroviruses, is composed 60 copies each of four viral polypeptides known as VP1 to VP4 (Knowlton et al., 1996, Wu et al., 2013, Jiang et al., 2014). Between all capsid proteins, VP1 is the most external capsid proteins and is the main part in structural of the canyon on the surfaces of Picornavirus, and potentially implicated for pathogenicity of these viruses (De Jesus, 2007, Wu et al., 2013). Moreover, genetic diversity at VP1 is closely associated with the difference in viral serotypes (Wu et al., 2013) and often used as a target for molecular detection of Picornavirus viral family (Yaqing et al., 2012, Nie et al., 2012, Wang et al., 2014, Chen et al., 2014, Ding et al., 2014).",

One advantage of RT-PCR is the usage of this method in comparative studies and diagnosis that could be increase the yield of Enteroviruses detection in tissue culture (Dierssen et al., 2008). But RT-PCR based nucleic acid detection can be time-consuming and requires highly pure RNA extracted which is difficult and impurity in sample can cause effects of inhibitors on PCR sensitivity (Opel et al., 2010, Pan et al., 2011, Ghosh et al., 2015). Loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) is an alternative isothermal nucleic acid amplification method that has developed by Notomi et al. (2000). Also, reverse transcription LAMP (RT-LAMP) assay which is carried out in a single tube is a simple, high specific, rapid, and cost-effectiveness method (Zhang et al., 2012). Less time-consuming of RT-LAMP than conventional PCR-based methods has been used successfully for rapid detection of pathogenic RNA viruses such as Enteroviruses (Arita et al., 2009, Jaianand et al., 2010, Jaianand et al., 2011, Shi et al., 2011, Nie et al., 2012, Yaqing et al., 2012, Zhang et al., 2012, Zhao et al., 2013, Chen et al., 2014, Ding et al., 2014, Jiang et al., 2014, Zhao et al., 2014, Wang et al., 2014) and less prone to inhibit from impurity of template sample (Caipang et al., 2004, Kaneko et al., 2007, Tomita et al., 2008, Mori and Notomi, 2009, Ghosh et al., 2015). The RT-LAMP assay is very specific in compared to other molecular detection methods, because in this method four primers are used to recognize six specific regions of the target gene for amplification (Zhang et al., 2012).",

We demonstrated in the normal and infected animal samples, RT-LAMP could be used for infected tissue detection. The identification of enteroviral-specific RNA sequences in myocardial patients is very important. CVB3 as a membrane from Enteroviruse is a major etiological agent in human myocarditis and idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (Shen et al., 2009). Several serological methods were used for Enteroviruses detection (Gao et al., 2016), but because of the disadvantages of these methods, the use of molecular techniques is more important. The LAMP method is an isothermal amplification technique for molecular detection of target DNA that was developed by Notomi et al. (2000). Advantages of LAMP method are amplification takes place at one temperature so it does not require thermal cycler, and also in this assay four primers used that recognizes 6 specific regions on the target DNA, therefore amplification is more specific. The RT-LAMP assay has been developed for simple and fast detection of various RNA viruses such as pandemic influenza A H1N1 Virus (Ma et al., 2010), coronavirus (Shirato et al., 2014), Ebola Virus (Kurosaki et al., 2016) and some of other viruses. In recent years, several publications have been reported using the LAMP method for detection of bacterial pathogens or fungal contaminants (Niessen et al., 2013).",

The sensitivity of the conventional RT-PCR has been established at approximately 1 to100 PFU of virus per gram of tissue (Shen et al., 2009), the sensitivity of NASBA similar to RT-PCR (Saeedinia et al., 2008), and the sensitivity of the real-time PCR assay have been reported 100 copies per reaction for CVB3 (Dierssen et al., 2008). Most researchers that have developed RT-LAMP method for detection of Enteroviruses have shown that sensitivity of the RT-LAMP was approximately 10 copies per reaction that was 10-fold higher sensitive than RT-PCR (Jaianand et al., 2010, Yaqing et al., 2012, Zhao et al., 2014).The RT-LAMP assay developed in this work and comparative analysis of RT-LAMP and RT-PCR sensitivity suggested that RT-LAMP was 100-fold higher sensitive than RT-PCR. Also due to the designing four primers that recognize six specific areas in target sequence, RT-LAMP assay has a high specificity, therefore cross- reactivity with other Enterovirus were not observed.",
