SARS\u2010CoV came from the Paguma larvata,\n16\n and the intermediate host for MERS\u2010CoV is Camelus dromedaries.\n17\n The new coronavirus SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 has recently caused a serious pandemic in China and other countries.

We found that the ACE2 of turtles and snake lost the capability to associate with S protein (Table 1 and Figure 1D,E). These reptiles should be ruled out from the potential host list for SARS\u2010CoV\u20102. Aves ACE2 was unlikely to associate with SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 RBD because they lost the critical K corresponding to K31 in human ACE2 (Table 1). Pangolin ACE2 was predicted to recognize SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 RBD less efficiently because it only preserved 14 of 20 critical AAs (Table 1). Interestingly, we found that ACE2 proteins from Primates, Bovidae, Cricetidae, and Cetacea were capable to recognize RBD of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 by maintaining the majority of key residues in ACE2 for associating with SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 RBD.

On the basis of human ACE2 and SARS\u2010CoV\u2010spike complex structure model (PDB ID: 2AJF), we and others recently predicted that hamster ACE2 could associate with SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 and hamster might be a candidate small animal model for SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection.\n18\n, \n19\n Indeed, golden Syrian hamster (Mesocricetus auratus) has been established as a model to study the pathogenesis and transmission of COVID\u201019.\n19\n One of Cetacea, Neophocaena asiaeorientalis asiaeorientalis (Yangtze finless porpoise), lives in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River and its lakes, where Wuhan located nearby.\n20\n It will be interesting to investigate whether Yangtze finless porpoise could be infected with SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 or related coronavirus.",
