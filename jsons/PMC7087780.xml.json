            "text": "There are many challenges in the design of information technology for crisis management (CM), including how to create an interface that provides an efficient overview of the crisis situation and other information needed by the crisis managers. In this work, we focus on information technology used by local and regional government when coordinating response activities during a crisis, that is, during an extraordinary event as defined in Swedish crisis preparedness law (Justitiedepartementet 2006). Among the difficulties in presenting an overview of a crisis is the fact that crises are dynamic events that change over time. Response activities with different time frames can go on concurrently, and the continuous information flow into the CM centre can be difficult to take in, as observed by Militello in his study of county level CM exercises (Militello et al. 2007). Because of this, we have chosen to investigate time and temporality with the help of group interviews to explore how time and temporality can be presented in information systems for CM. Additional reasons for focusing on this specific topic are: that human cognition has difficulties in processing temporal relationships (D\u00f6rner 1997) and consequently might benefit from support in this area, and because time is an important dimension of situation awareness (SA) (Endsley et al. 2003, Sect. 2.2).",

The problems with processing temporal relationships are discussed by D\u00f6rmer (1997), who presents various illustrations of limitations concerning, for example, assessing processes that grow exponentially, extrapolating the moment when trying to make predictions about the future and, in particular, guessing at missing pieces of information. One point D\u00f6rner makes is that when we observe spatial relationships, the full picture can be available to us at once, and we have many opportunities to take another look at the parts of the picture we need to investigate further, but when we try to assess temporal configurations, we have the challenge to do it as they unfold, or afterwards in retrospect.",

Continium is a timeline visualisation tool proposed by Andr\u00e9. It can be used to represent large amounts of hierarchically structured temporal data and has features that help keeping the presentation clear when zooming in or out. The user can also select which dimensions should be shown. Li, on the other hand, has combined time-wheel presentation and timeline presentation to create time-waves. The time-waves are mainly intended for exploring spatio-temporal data and can be connected to location space and attribute space to offer more query possibilities. Finally, we have Chronos by Luz, which is a temporal mosaic with similarities to gant-diagrams and is used for project planning. In the temporal mosaic, space is allocated proportionally to the number of allocated tasks. Based on the descriptions in the above works, several observations can be made concerning the usefulness of the visualisations for a CM context. Continium appears to be able to handle large amounts of data, but requires the information to have clear hierarchies, while information related to crises can be unstructured. Continium is also not directly designed for handling dynamic real-time information, as might be needed during a crisis, but instead is more focused on visualising historical data. Time-waves can visualise certain aspects of a crisis, such as in Li\u2019s example of a time-wave for earthquakes, but is limited (in the same way as regular timelines are) when it comes to visualising large amounts of data that are close in time. Chronos is designed for project visualisations and is not meant to summarise single events or generic information that is not connected to task planning.",

The model is based on \u201ctemporal coordination\u201d (Bardram 2009), which is a concept based on activity theory within the computer-supported collaborative work (CSCW) field. The issue that Franke is addressing is not only a technical one, but arises in any information sharing between actors in CM. Conflicts can arise when different actors have a different understanding of the duration of activities or how events are casually related to each other. Franke uses collaboration between the fire brigade, the police and the military during a flood as an example (Franke et al. 2011). Temporal relations become important in this case, because the fire fighters depend on the military to bring sand bags in order to be able to build a dam protecting the residential area. The police\u2019s activities depend on the other actors\u2019 activities because they might have to evacuate the residential area. Franke is here addressing temporal relationships from a technical perspective in order to make them more visible to the user, so that conflicts can be avoided or quickly resolved.",

He summarises several different ways to represent time (including: date-based representation, representation of fully ordered events and other logical representations) that can be used in order to make the temporal information accessible to for processing in information systems. Among the problems that arise are, for example, missing information about the specific time for when an event occurred or missing information about the duration of events or activities. Furthermore, persistence assumptions arise when people assume that something has not changed since the last time they obtained information about the status of an event or activity.",

Since crisis situations are dynamic and changing, the individual\u2019s SA also has to constantly change to stay up-to-date. An example of the difficulties with staying up-to-date is that it might not be known beforehand which information sources will be available during a crisis event. In some cases, there might be completely new information systems or information sources emerging. Two examples of emerging information sources are: when a new information system was developed to support the large-scale contact tracing and data management during the SARS outbreak in Singapore 2003, and when the Singapore Regional Coordination Center (SRCC) developed a web-based Crisis Case Management System (CCMS) for monitoring the availability and demand of aid supplies and assessing how these supplies could be distributed during the Asian tsunami disaster in 2004 (Leidner et al. 2009).",

Some of the problems that can be encountered when trying to consider SA in CM system design are: (1) difficulties in ensuring or even knowing data quality, (2) the fact that the actors\u2019 different backgrounds cause them to interpret information differently and (3) that the same information is interpreted differently because different actors will have diverse requirements and needs for future action. The main idea from Harrald and Jefferson\u2019s discussion about designing for CM is that it is insufficient, and might even be impossible, to gather information requirements in the same way as done in less complex operator environments. Salmon, on the other hand, has evaluated different SA measurement techniques\u2019 suitability for a command, control, communication, computers and intelligence (C4i) context (Salmon et al. 2006). Salmon\u2019s evaluation is relevant for CM since C4i includes emergency services such as police and fire brigade. His conclusion is that none of the 17 tested SA measurement techniques would be sufficient for a C4i context and also suggests that further research needs to be done in order to investigate whether it is possible to combine several of the existing techniques into a measurement tool that can give a more complete assessment.",

Three interviews were conducted with participants from three different authorities, one county council and two municipalities. The reason to do three separate interviews was to ensure that the result found in one of the group interviews would not be unique for the specific organisation. This leads to triangulation, since the set-up allows us to identify potentially conflicting statements between the groups, and more confidence can be put into that the result can be applicable to CM at local and regional level overall. Advantages of group interviews are that they may reveal dynamics through interaction and issues not apparent in individual interaction (Gillham 2005). Additionally, according to Gillham, they can provide an early indication of a range of views. The choice of group interviews instead of individual interviews allowed us to talk to people with different CM roles at the same time. Talking to several interviewees at the same time can provide a more nuanced picture of the CM context and reveal, for example, variations in perspective and attitude between the interviewees as discussed by Frey and Fontana (Frey and Fontana 1991).",

There are differences between authorities and caution should be taken to generalise result to most Swedish authorities. As participant C in the county council group pointed out during the discussions, the county council has slightly different working conditions since it operates in a big city area, where the rescue service has a large emergency management centre that is capable of managing parts of the coordination work that otherwise would have fallen on the county council. By operating in a coast area, the county council can also collaborate with the coast guard or sear rescue service, which might not be the case in other counties. Nevertheless, the regulations and CM system are the same for all local and regional authorities in Sweden. This means that the conditions for CM work in general are comparable between the authorities participating in the study and other municipalities and county councils. Furthermore, all participants in the study were active in various collaboration networks, training and exercises, with actors outside their own specific authority or area. The systems and tools that are used to support CM work might vary from organisation to organisation, but two commonly used systems by municipalities and county councils are Web-based Information System (WIS) (MSB 2009) and Samverkanswebben (SOS Alarm Sverige AB, 2010). WIS is used for sharing information\u2014for example, operational pictures\u2014between local, regional and national authorities and other organisations that take part in CM work. Samverkanswebben collects information from SOS Alarm and numerous other sources to provide regional and local crisis managers with a map-based overview of accidents, fires, police activities, the traffic situation, disturbances in the electricity supply, weather alerts and other emergency- or crisis-related information. The fact that these systems are commonly used further supports the assumption that there are similarities in the CM work between authorities.",

It was this input in combination with several of Endsley\u2019s SA principles (see Table 2) that was the foundation for the prototype.

The timeline is intended to provide overview, and the objective is that the timeline not only presents events and their temporal qualities (time when they occur, their duration, and so on) but also enables quick access to information by providing links to related meeting minutes, status reports or other documents directly from the timeline. In order to support the crisis manager in navigating through the information available during a crisis, the timeline needs functionality for filtering information, zooming and linking to documents and other information sources. The purpose of the checklist is to present activities and deadlines, to help the crisis manager to keep track of important tasks. A tab can also include other functionality, such as contact lists, search features or connection to GIS systems, to help the crisis manger get access to further information when needed.",

To support the user in asking for updates or clarification of information, the interface can, for example, provide linking to the original information source, linking to further information, commenting opportunities (as illustrated in the work area in Fig. 1) and contact lists.",

The scenario was based on a case in Lilla Edet in 2008 (Gryszkiewicz and Chen 2010) in order to use a realistic event as the basis for the scenario. It has been estimated (based on questionnaires sent out after the outbreak) that the outbreak of Calici virus in Lilla Edet caused 2400 sick cases, affecting one-fifth of the population in the municipality (Ekvall 2010). The groups were given a scenario where a waterborne infection had affected their municipality or county and lead to several hundred sick cases. The source of infection was not known at the beginning of the event, but all signs would be indicating that the infection was waterborne. The specific sequence of events or response activities was not specified beforehand, because the objective was to allow the participants to describe how an outbreak of waterborne infection would be handled by their specific authority. This includes which response actions would be taken by the CM group and what other actors (both organisations and individuals) the participants would be exchanging information with. The scenario was chosen because providing a drinking water supply is a central societal function and especially important for municipal CM, since municipalities are responsible for monitoring the quality of the water (National Food Administration 2010). To sum up, the participants have not been directly involved in a real event as in the scenario, but are likely to be familiar with routines for how their organisation would respond, since possible risks to the drinking water supply is a common concern from a local or regional CM perspective. Municipalities and county councils do, however, have slightly different perspectives on water borne infections. Municipalities are more directly involved in the response work, while county councils have a more high-level role. County councils can, for example, help with expertise or coordinating contacts to national authorities and organisations such as the Swedish National Food Administration or the National Water Catastrophe Group (which is a support group of experts who can provide advice on crises that affect the water supply).",

This could reduce the time it takes to inform a colleague who is taking over the work tasks and also reduces the risk for later problems if the person leaving a shift has forgotten to share a specific piece of information that the successor later needs to know about. The participants meant that, by and large, there is a need to know what has been done earlier in the CM.

Since the different actors, nevertheless, have the common goal to respond to and mitigate the effects of a crisis, they all need information about temporal aspects of the event and of each other\u2019s work. CM systems can help the crisis managers to understand the situation by presenting temporal relationships between events and activities. Temporal relationships can be, for example, simultaneity, succession, recurrence, frequency, length, time shifts, as suggested in (Corn\u00e9lis 2005). However, Franke observes that it is difficult to define dependencies between different actors\u2019 activities beforehand. (Franke et al. 2010). Temporal dependencies in CM during an outbreak of waterborne disease could be when municipal crisis managers are waiting for water analysis test results from a laboratory before cancelling water boiling recommendations. Other dependencies might be how events are connected to each other in time, like for instance the time between when a response action is taken until there is a decrease in the number of new sick cases.",

Turoff\u2019s design principle 2 points to any marking that makes information traceable to the source, and the specific point we want to add is that create/last update time-stamps especially can help the crisis manager to understand what the situation looks like right now.

Endsley also mentions displays that \u201callow operators to anticipate possible occurrences\u201d to be helpful for the operators ability to create accurate projections. Projecting future events is a part of level 3 SA. For the design of CM systems, visualising temporal parameters could mean illustrating how a flood would spread as a function of rainfall or presenting how many and what kind of phone calls the switchboard is getting concerning a crisis over time. Furthermore, by presenting worst-case scenarios, showing alternative outcomes, or visualising constraints for how an event can develop, the crisis managers can start discussing and preparing response activities. For example, if a worst-case scenario is presented for a flood, then it can be used as a foundation for discussions regarding potential damage to infrastructure, what resources might be needed, and evacuation plans, even when the actual consequences of the flood are not yet known.",

One reason alternative temporal scaling is needed is that crises and CM activities can last for different durations. A chemical industry incident might only be in focus during a few days, while a flooding prevention project might go on for several years. Since the timescale of CM work varies, CM systems need to support shift changes and transferring of tasks between teams and individuals in CM when the duration or timing of activities makes it necessary for more than one individual to be involved in a specific task. This is, for example, discussed in the DERMIS framework design premise number 5, summarised in (Van de Walle and Turoff, 2008) based on (Turoff et al. 2004a, b). Premise number 5 is about the scope and nature of a crisis and specifically focuses on that different actors might be active in different phases of a crisis and that tasks might be transferred between different teams or actors. Tasks can also be transferred between individuals when crisis managers work in shifts or need breaks. To summarise, this means both that the system should be able to present information on alternate timescales, but also that it can support, for example, shift changes that occur when different people are responsible for the same activities over time.",

Furthermore, Leidner provides examples of how new systems are developed on demand during crisis events to solve information gathering needs during crises (Leidner et al. 2009). It is consequently necessary to consider the handling of emerging information sources in the design of CM systems. A CM system needs to be able to collect information from sources that might not have been known beforehand or that might not even have existed before the crisis event. This principle is connected to temporality since information sources can change over time, the information technology support needs to allow for that kind of flexibility.",

            "text": "This work has explored temporality in the design of information technology for CM support. From a research perspective, it contributes with a better understanding of how temporality can affect SA in a CM context. It is a challenging task to assess and design for SA in a complex environment such as CM, and we have therefore used group interviews to gain insights on possible obstacles that might hinder crisis managers from obtaining SA. We have specifically addressed how different aspects of CM work might influence both the CM group\u2019s and the individual\u2019s SA. Obstacles elicited from the interviews are: information overflow, fast changes of SA due to incoming information, difficulties to share SA with actors outside the CM centre, forgetting things that need attention and that SA depends on the quality of incoming information. This work also contributes to practice, through the collected end-user input on the usefulness of timelines as a visualisation tool for crisis-related information. According to the participants, timelines should present: deadlines, information sent to the public, incoming and outgoing information, an overview of where the current activities belong in the CM process and what has been going on since the last shift during shift changes. Timelines should not only display the listed information, but also provide functionality for adjusting the timescale so that information can be presented in different temporal perspectives. The main contribution of this paper is the design principles that are based on all the findings mentioned above.",

We intend to do this by comparing the findings to the designs of two CM information systems that are in use in Sweden. The evaluation will be done through interviews with crisis managers, since this allows us to study information from real crisis events and to take advantage of the users\u2019 knowledge about how and why the system has been used. The result will be used to assess whether the design principles are useful in practical evaluations of CM information system interfaces and to refine them where appropriate. Temporality in CM is a broad topic that can and should be investigated in more ways than has been possible in this work. It would, for example, be interesting to make a more thorough comparison between timelines and other alternatives for visualising temporality to further explore how they can contribute in a CM context.",
