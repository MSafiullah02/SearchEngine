The emergency doctor had been dispatched to the home of the patient due to an emergency call. The patient suffered from dyspnea for approximately 7 days. A short episode of an upper airway infection and a contact to a confirmed SARS-Cov2 positive individual was reported. The emergency physician found the patient in acute and severe distress because of dyspnea and thoracic pain. The patient was conscious (Glasgow Coma Scale 15), hypotensive (RR 80/60 mmHg) and tachycardic (120 bpm). Oxygen saturation (SaO2) was 70% despite oxygen insufflation via a nasal canula which prompted immediate intubation on the scene. During transport, repetitive boli of norepinephrine were required to maintain blood pressure. The chest X-ray on admission showed confluent infiltrations in the right and left lung suggestive of a viral pneumonia (Fig. 1).",

Apart from leukocytosis (19.6/nl), sepsis markers (CRP, Procalcitonin) were in the normal range. An echocardiogram performed by the emergency room staff was reported as \u201cnormal\u201d. The ECG on admission showed sinus rhythm without ST-elevation (Fig. 3).
