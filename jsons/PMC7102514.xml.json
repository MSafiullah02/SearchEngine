            "text": "Chronic severe hepatitis (CSH) can cause irreversible hepatic failure resulting from severe impairment of liver function. It is associated with a mortality rate of >70% if liver transplantation (LT) is not available [1]. The main causes of CSH are alcoholic cirrhosis and viral hepatitis C in Western countries [2], whereas it is viral hepatitis B in China. The current policy for determining priority for organ allocation is based on the model for end-stage liver disease (MELD). Patients with the highest MELD score, which predicts the greatest risk for dying without LT, would be given the highest priority [3]. However, the correlation between either the preoperative MELD or the Child-Turcotte-Pugh (CTP) score and outcome after LT using donors after cardiac death (DCDs) for chronic severe hepatitis B (CSHB) in mainland China has not yet been evaluated adequately [4]. The primary objective of this study was to test the hypothesis that the severity of liver disease based on the MELD or CTP score is important for predicting outcome after LT for CSHB. The secondary objective was to reexamine other potential factors that may be associated with poor patient survival.",

We calculated for each patient the MELD score based on serum bilirubin and creatinine levels and the INR (prothrombin) [6]. From the outset, the INR was included in the reporting of the prothrombin time for all patients. We also retrospectively determined the CTP score, which is based on five variables: hepatic encephalopathy (HE), ascites, bilirubin, albumin levels, and the INR [7]. HE was present if the patient received medical treatment including l-ornithine, l-aspartate, or lactulose or had clinical manifestations of at least stage 2 HE based on the criteria by Gitlin [8]. The presence and degree of ascites were assessed by diuretic requirements as well as by abdominal imaging studies including ultrasonography (US) or computed tomography (CT) scans.",

Interestingly, the survival curve declined sharply during the first month after OLT and became consistently stable thereafter (Fig. 1), indicating that most patients died during the peroperative period. As expected, those patients who died had significantly higher MELD (35.17 \u00b1 11.00 vs. 26.76 \u00b1 6.76, p < 0.001) and CTP (13.12 \u00b1 0.65 vs. 12.59 \u00b1 0.78, p = 0.001) scores than those of survivors. This was supported by Yao et al. [19], who found patients with a MELD score \u2265 25 or a CTP score \u2265 10 had poorer prognosis after re-OLT. Recently, Wang et al. [4] found the MELD and CTP scores for the patients who died were significantly higher than those for the survivors. In their study, all patients demonstrated clinical features of chronic type B hepatitis; patients with fulminant hepatic failure or subacute fulminant hepatitis as a result of acute hepatitis B infection were not included. The ROC analysis identified the best cutoff point for them to be 25.67 (AUC 0.841; sensitivity 85.7%; specificity 60.0%) and 11.5 (AUC 0.747; sensitivity 85.7%; specificity 54.3%), respectively, to predict postoperative short-term survival and 3-month morbidity among patients with acute-on-chronic hepatitis B liver failure (which is defined as a syndrome with severe liver dysfunction and at least grade II encephalopathy for patients with chronic liver disease) undergoing OLT.",

Certainly, there are complex technical and medical factors, in addition to disease severity alone, that may be associated with early mortality after OLT. For example, the potential bias and subjectivity in retrospectively determining individual CTP scores, primarily with respect to the degree of ascites and hepatic encephalopathy [20]. However, the MELD score seemed to be more preferable in our current study. First, MELD gives a continuous liver disease severity score that can be easily applied to rank patients on the waiting list according to their risk of dying over a defined period of time. It also ranks patients more specifically according to the severity of their disease [3]. In our study, the patients with a MELD score \u2265 33.8 had significantly lower short-term (1-month and 6-month) survival rates than did patients with a CTP score \u2265 12.5, which indicated that a high MELD score had a more compacted correlation with early death after OLT [6, 21].",

In their study, primary nonfunction/delayed graft function (PNF/DGF) and BC cumulatively accounted for 67% of early graft failures, and recurrent disease (30%) and BC (20%) mainly caused late (> 1 year after OLT) graft failure. However, the incidence of BC in our study was significantly lower than that of theirs (14.6% vs. 25%), and it caused only 13% (6/46) graft loss during the early stage after OLT. This was probably due to the fact that most DCDs in our study enjoyed shorter DWIT and CIT, which were considered to be the risk factors for BC and graft failure [30\u201332]. However, the lack of a standard definition of the DWIT has been problematic [33], making studies that utilize UNOS data difficult to interpret, confounding comparisons of individual DCD studies, and preventing valid recommendations of a DWIT ceiling above which would predict poor outcomes. Our definition of DWIT was unambiguous\u2014from the time of cardiac arrest of the donor to perfusion of the abdominal aorta. We did not use a blood pressure threshold below which would define the beginning of the DWIT as others have [34, 35], as tissues are still hypoxic in DCDs who maintain a blood pressure but cease to ventilate. However, further reducing both DWIT and CITas well as possibly reducing the donor age might improve results [28].",

This is probably caused by inadequate clearance of the small peribiliary capillaries, a phenomenon to which liver grafts from NHBDs may be particularly vulnerable because of the stagnation of blood during warm ischemia [38].
