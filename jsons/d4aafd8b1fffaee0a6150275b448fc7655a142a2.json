The indoor environments of multi-zone and multi-story buildings are affected differently by outdoor particles compared with single-family houses, because of the buildings' more complicated airflow characteristics. The objective of this study is to analyze outdoor particle penetration and transport, and their impact on indoor air, in a multi-zone and multi-story building using a CONTAMW simulation. For the airflow and particle transport analysis, the building leakage, penetration coefficients, and deposition rates were determined by on-site experiments. The results of airflow simulations for cold winters show that outdoor air infiltrates through the lower part of building and exfiltrates from the upper part. The results of the particle simulation also indicated that the airflow characteristics, combined with deposition rates, cause the lower floors of a multi-story building to be exposed to higher fine particle concentrations compared with the upper floors of the building. The study demonstrated that the CONTAMW simulation can be useful in analyzing the impact of outdoor particles on indoor environments through the identification of key particle transport parameters and validated airflow simulations.",

In particular, there has been an exponential increase in urbanization and industrialization over the last few decades in several East Asian countries, including China and Korea, leading to increases in air pollutant emissions (Lee et al. 1999) . During Asian dust storm episodes, the outdoor PM 10 concentrations in Korea can increase more than four-fold compared with the concentrations before the storm episodes (Chun et al. 2001) . According to the Seoul Air Quality Information, the outdoor daily peak in PM 10 concentrations in 2015 reached above 700 \u03bcg/m 3 . Especially in cold winters, high daily average PM 10 concentrations of above 560 \u03bcg/m 3 were observed in Seoul; these high concentrations are attributed to the use of combustion devices for heating. Governments and research institutes have made various efforts to reduce the risk of outdoor PM pollution in recent years.",

(Alzona et al. 1979; Ligocki et al. 1993; Ozlaynnak et al. 1996; Abt et al. 2000; Lee and Chang 2000; Long et al. 2001; Liu et al. 2003; Wallace et al. 2003; Cao et al. 2005; Kuo and Shen 2010; Chatoutsidou et al. 2015) . These studies mainly focused on single family houses, and the investigations have suggested a strong relationship between outdoor and indoor particle concentrations. Unlike single family houses where a single zone assumption is usually made, multi-zone and multi-story buildings involve more complicated airflow characteristics, meaning that outdoor particles have a different effect on the indoor air quality. For example, in winter, when the outdoor particle concentration is generally high, outdoor air infiltrates through the building envelop at the lower floors of the building, and exfiltrates from the upper floors owing to the stack effect. Air pollutants can also spread from lower floors to upper floors due to the inter-floor airflow caused by the buoyancy force (Zhou and Deng 2014) . This phenomenon results in a distinctive indoor particle concentration distribution within a building. Moreover, deposition loss in multi-zone buildings may lead to different outdoor particle effects on the indoor air depending on the building zone.",

However, a full understanding of the impact of outdoor particles within the multi-zone and multi-story building is still lacking because of the limited number of air sampling locations. In practice, using a large number of particle sampling devices simultaneously is expensive and time-consuming (Ma et al. 2012) . A careful computer simulation study with reliable inputs for key simulation parameters, such as the particle penetration coefficient and deposition rate, may be capable of providing comprehensive insights for understanding particle transport in multi-story buildings. The objective of this study is to analyze outdoor particle penetration and transport in a multizone and multi-story building, and their impact on indoor air. To this end, CONTAMW, a multi-zone airflow and contaminant transport analysis program, was used to predict size-resolved particle concentrations in each zone and on each floor. Two key simulation parameters, the penetration coefficient and the deposition rate of size-resolved particles, were determined by field measurements for the reference building, and used for the simulation.",

As particle transport is affected by a building's airflow, both the airflow and particle transport analyses were simultaneously considered in the simulation for a reference building. For the airflow simulation, the leakage data for the building components were measured using the typical blower door pressurization and depressurization method in compliance with ISO 9972 (ISO 2015a). To validate the airflow simulation, the pressure prediction results were compared with the measured pressure distribution in the reference building. For the particle transport analysis, the two key parameters, the penetration coefficients and deposition rates, were determined by field experiments. CONTAMW is capable of considering particle deposition loss in the inbuilt model, but does not provide a model for particle penetration. A modification to consider particle penetration, which is a function of airflow rates and penetration coefficients, was made in the CONTAMW model. A conceptual diagram of the simulation approach is illustrated in Fig. 1 .",

As shown in Fig. 4 (a) , the highest penetration coefficient was 0.85 at 0.3 \u03bcm and the lowest penetration coefficient was 0.04 at 10 \u03bcm. It was observed that particles with larger diameters (>1.0 \u03bcm) tended to have lower penetration coefficients. Figure 4 (b) presents the deposition rate of size-resolved particles. Deposition rates ranged from 0.05 h \u22121 to 0.55 h \u22121 , and the highest deposition rate was found to be 0.55 h \u22121 at 10 \u03bcm. The coarse particles (3.0 \u03bcm, 5.0 \u03bcm, 10 \u03bcm) generally showed higher deposition rates than the fine particles. These penetration coefficients and deposition rates fall within similar ranges to values suggested by other researchers (Long et al. 2001; Williams et al. 2003; Chao et al. 2003) . In their studies, penetration coefficients ranged from 0.72 to 0.79 for fine particles and from 0.58 to 0.48 for coarse particles, while deposition rates ranged from 0.12 h \u22121 to 0.42 h \u22121 for fine particles and from 0.37 h \u22121 to 0.55 h \u22121 for coarse particles.

The simulation results for the pressure distribution were compared with the measured pressure difference between the inside Fig. 4 Size-resolved penetration coefficients and deposition rates of particles, estimated in the test room: (a) penetration coefficients; (b) deposition rates and outside of the building.

The pressure difference gradually decreased on the upper floors, as demonstrated by a pressure difference on the top floor of \u22125 Pa. In the simulated building, the neutral pressure level (\u0394P = 0) was approximately located at the 3rd floor. These pressure simulation results indicate that the outdoor air infiltrates into the lower level of building and exfiltrates from the upper level of the building, which is commonly known as the stack effect. Generally, it is known that the pressure difference between indoors and outdoors is ranged from 0 to 5 Pa normally applied to single family houses. The higher pressure difference of 10 Pa predicted on the first floor suggests that particle penetration, which is dependent on the pressure Figure 6 shows the airflow rate of three representative zones (\"exterior,\" \"corridor,\" and \"interior\") in the reference building. The three zones were set to examine the differences in airflow and particle transport in the multi-zone building. The exact representative locations can be found in Fig. 2(a) . The airflow rate for \"exterior (Z1)\" indicates air exchange rates with the outdoors, while the airflow rates for \"corridor (Z2)\" and \"interior (Z3)\" indicate the airflow rates between adjacent zones. The \"+\" and \"\u2212\" sign in Fig. 6 represent the airflow direction, in that \"+\" indicates that the airflow travels from the outside to the inside and \"\u2212\" indicates the opposite direction of travel. At the building exterior, the outdoor The results clearly suggest that the infiltration of air on each floor is significantly different in terms of the amount of air as well as the airflow direction. Also, they indicate that the outdoor particles' impact on the indoor environment differs significantly from floor to floor. Figure 7 illustrates the amount of size-resolved particle penetration (penetration coefficient \u00d7 airflow rate) through the building envelope zone of the reference building. The \"+\" and \"\u2212\" signs in Fig. 7 represent the direction of particle penetration: \"+\" indicates particle penetration from the outside to inside, and \"\u2212\" indicates the opposite direction. The amounts of particle penetration ranged from 0.12 h \u22121 to 2.17 h \u22121 on the lower floors and from \u22120.49 h \u22121 to \u22120.06 h \u22121 on the upper floors. The particle transport trends through the building envelope are generally similar to the airflow results. The results show that the outdoor particles penetrate into the lower floors of the building. This particle penetration was prominent for fine particles (0.3 \u03bcm, 0.5 \u03bcm, 1.0 \u03bcm), while the amount of penetration from coarse particles (3 \u03bcm, 5 \u03bcm, 10 \u03bcm) not significant owing to the low penetration coefficients. The result does not indicate that the outdoor particles only affect the lower floors of multi-story buildings, because the outdoor particles that penetrate into the building can be transported through vertical spaces such as elevator shafts and stairwells, resulting in the influence of outdoor particles on the upper floors of the building. Figure 8 shows the size-resolved particle I/O ratio in each zone and for each floor of the reference building. As no indoor particle generation or resuspension was assumed, the simulated I/O ratio indicates the influence of particles originating outdoors on the indoor particle concentrations, considering the particle penetration, deposition, and transport within a building.",

This is attributed to the low penetration coefficients and high deposition rates of coarse particles. As indicated above, it was found that the I/O ratios for the lower floors were higher than for the upper floors. For fine particles, the maximum I/O ratio for the lower floors was 0.71, while that for the upper floors was 0.13. These findings were true for both fine and coarse particles. The simulated I/O ratio strongly suggests that the impact of outdoor particles would be significant for the lower floors of a multi-story building. From the results, the upper floors were marginally affected by coarse particles owing to the higher deposition loss rate (0.11 h \u22121 -0.52 h \u22121 ), but significantly affected by the fine outdoor particles. In terms of the zone location, the exterior zone is more affected by outdoor particles than other zones. The average I/O ratio of exterior zone was 0.15, and those of corridor and interior zones were 0.08 and 0.06, respectively. For fine particles, the I/O ratios of the exterior zone ranged from 0.08 to 0.71 and those of the interior zone ranged from 0 to 0.45.

In cold winters, the stack effect occurs frequently, affecting the building airflow characteristics. The results of this study suggest that the lower part of a multi-story building will experience higher particle concentrations than the higher part of the building.

To examine the actual impact of fine outdoor particles on the indoor environment, an additional analysis was conducted that considered the mass fraction of outdoor particles, using a winter smog episode as an example. Figure 9 shows the size-resolved particle mass concentrations outdoors and indoors during a winter smog episode. The outdoor mass concentration shows that the amount of fine Fig. 9 Size-resolved particle mass concentrations outdoors and indoors particles is similar to that of coarse particles, and that the indoor fine particle mass concentration is much higher than that for the coarse particles.
