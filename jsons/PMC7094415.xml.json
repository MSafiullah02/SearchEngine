            "text": "Respiratory infections constitute some of the most important diseases of growing pigs and result in substantial economic losses and reduced welfare (S\u00f8rensen et al., 2006). Porcine respiratory disease complex (PRDC) is a multifactorial disease of finishing pigs from 14 to 22 weeks of age (Thacker, 2001, Kim et al., 2003). Morbidity ranges from 10% to 40% and mortality from 2% to 20% (Harding and Halbur, 2002, Harms et al., 2002). Lesions are primarily located in the cranioventral parts of the lung, where consolidation, discoloration and failure of the lung tissue to collapse may be observed (Harms et al., 2002). Histopathology may vary according to the pathogens involved, but bronchopneumonia, sometimes in combination with interstitial pneumonia, is often reported (Harms et al., 2002, Kim et al., 2003). In the USA, the most commonly isolated pathogens are porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), swine influenza virus (SIV), porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2), Pasteurella multocida and Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae. Other important pathogens associated with PRDC are Streptococcus suis, Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae and [Haemophilus] parasuis (Thacker, 2001, Harms et al., 2002, Choi et al., 2003). A study from 1999 showed that 25% of Danish finishing pigs had cranioventral bronchopneumonia (CBP) at slaughter (Christensen and Enoe, 1999). Concurrent abattoir surveys in Switzerland and Belgium showed a similar prevalence (Grest et al., 1997, Maes et al., 2001), whereas earlier surveys revealed a higher prevalence, from 37% in Canada (Osborne et al., 1981), 45% in Australia (Davies et al., 1992) to 78% in another Canadian study (Wilson et al., 1986). Abattoir surveys of porcine bronchopneumonia usually focus on the gross pathology and/or the microbiology, whereas the histopathology and microbiology are seldom linked. A survey of the pathogens involved in CBP in Danish pigs has not been performed for decades and since new respiratory viruses (i.e. PCV2, porcine respiratory coronavirus [PRCV], PRRSV and new strains of SIV) have been identified in recent years, a survey of respiratory pathogens in this species has become relevant.",

Cases of CBP were defined as those with lesions affecting a minimum of three cranioventral lung lobes (i.e. the apical, cardiac and intermediate lobes; S\u00f8rensen et al., 2006). The gross lesions were of acute and chronic inflammation and included consolidation, swelling, hyperaemia, failure to collapse and/or fibrosis. The samples were cooled and processed (see below) within 5 h of sampling. Tracheobronchial lymph nodes were not obtained from two animals with CBP and five control animals.",

Acute lesions were oedematous, hyperaemic and swollen. Subacute lesions were those in which swelling and hyperaemia were no longer present, but in these cases there may still have been mild oedema and often marked exudation into the bronchi. Chronic lesions were characterized by atelectic, fibrotic and grey-red lung tissue with dilation of exudate-filled bronchi. Lymph nodes were scored according to their size as normal (0), moderate enlargement (1) or marked enlargement (2).",

BALT hyperplasia was graded as follows (Ross, 1999): (0) absent; (+) mild diffuse infiltration of lymphocytes in the peribronchial, peribronchiolar and perivascular tissues including the lamina propria of the airways; (++) moderate increased diffuse infiltration of lymphocytes and/or presence of a few lymphoid nodules; (+++) marked number of lymphoid nodules; or (++++) extensive number of lymphoid nodules affecting most of the lung section (Fig. 1\na\u2013d). Alveolar exudates were classified according to Bochsler and Slauson (2002) as suppurative (neutrophils dominated), non-suppurative (mononuclear inflammatory cells dominated) or mixed (intermediate grades between suppurative and non-suppurative; Fig. 1e\u2013g). Hyperplasia of type II pneumocytes was present when these cells lined more than 3% of the alveolar surface area (Plopper and Adams, 2006) (Fig. 1h). Crowding of type II pneumocytes in close proximity to the interlobular connective tissue was not considered a significant lesion. Acute lesions were defined as those with neutrophils as the dominant inflammatory cell type, extensive oedema and/or fibrin exudation and absence of chronic signs. Chronic lesions were characterized by fibroplasias, BALT hyperplasia (of grade ++ to ++++), hyperplasia of bronchial or bronchiolar epithelium, presence of bronchiolar polyps and alveolar polyp-like structures with a fibrous core, hypertrophy of the smooth muscle layer around bronchioles and alveolar ducts, and cellular infiltrates primarily consisting of lymphocytes and plasma cells. Lesions that were not strictly acute or chronic (e.g. cellular infiltration dominated by neutrophils, combined with moderate BALT hyperplasia as the only chronic lesion) were regarded as subacute. Thus, the extent of acute versus chronic signs determined the duration of the inflammatory response. The histopathological diagnosis was regarded as the definitive diagnosis.",

Thickened alveolar septa were observed in pigs from both control and case groups, indicating that this finding is not entirely related to bronchopneumonia. This lesion may therefore be regarded as a pulmonary response to environmental factors associated with swine production (e.g. dust and ammonia). Furthermore, thickening of alveolar septa was not associated with the presence of specific pathogens. Type II pneumocyte hyperplasia occurred more frequently in pigs with CBP compared with controls; however, the lesion did not appear to be associated with the duration of disease, since it was present in all diagnosis groups. In addition to the bronchiolar polyps in the pigs with pneumonic lesions, there were also structures that resembled alveolar polyps, (i.e. they protruded from the epithelial surface in the alveoli and were covered by epithelium). Three different forms of alveolar polyp-like structures were identified (fibrinous, cell-infiltrated fibrinous and collagenous) and these probably represented different stages of the same initial lesion. Alveolar polyp-like structures have not been described previously in pigs and their significance is undetermined.",

Except for 14 animals, Mycoplasma spp., bacteria and respiratory viruses were identified in all cases of CBP in the present study. This pathogen profile, combined with the pathological findings, is in accordance with the diagnosis of PRDC, although it is not possible to determine the order of infection. Based on the pathogen combination, \u2018classical\u2019 enzootic pneumonia was only present in five animals with CBP, which indicates that PRDC is more prevalent in Danish finishing pigs compared with enzootic pneumonia. This probably corresponds to the findings in other countries, where a mixture of Mycoplasma spp., bacteria and viruses are identified in the majority of porcine pneumonias (Harms et al., 2002, Kim et al., 2003, Palzer et al., 2007).",

Therefore, these agents might represent more aggressive pathogens in cases of PRDC, although the difference in frequency between cases and controls was not significant. The diversity and number of pathogens were higher among the diseased animals compared with the control group, supporting the definition of PRDC as a multifactorial disease (Harms et al., 2002), which should be considered when diagnosing and treating cases of PRDC and in prophylactic strategies. The observed tendency towards a lower number of pathogens in the chronic cases of CBP (Fig. 3), compared with the acute and subacute cases, could be explained by regression of the infection and elimination of pathogens.",

The mere identification of PCV2 by PCR is not regarded as diagnostic for PCV2-associated disease (i.e. porcine circovirus disease), therefore the animals in the present study may have been subclinically infected (Opriessnig et al., 2007). PCV2 has the potential to reduce acquired immunity to other pathogens (Opriessnig et al., 2006) and vaccination against PCV2 reduced co-infections by secondary pathogens and lowered the incidence of pulmonary coinfections (Fachinger et al., 2008). In recent years it has been speculated that PCV2 plays a part in PRDC and this is now widely accepted (Harms et al., 2002, Thacker, 2006). In the present study, PCV2 was part of the majority of significant associations between pairs of pathogens in the cases of CBP (Table 3). Except for M. hyopneumoniae, PCV2 and the associated pathogens had a positive influence on each other (i.e. the presence of one increased the chance of finding the other). Although PCV2 was also detected in samples from most control animals, there was only a single significant association between PCV2 and other pathogens in this group. These findings indicate that PCV2 could be involved in PRDC in Danish finishing pigs, preparing the way for other respiratory pathogens or occurring as a secondary invader.",

Although not significant, S. suis was isolated from a higher proportion of PRDC affected animals (45%) than controls (13%), suggesting that S. suis is involved in PRDC. S. suis was isolated from significantly fewer acute cases (ASBP) compared with subacute and chronic cases, suggesting that it is a secondary invading pathogen. Furthermore, co-occurrence was detected between S. suis and M. hyopneumoniae or PCV2, which supports the role of S. suis as an opportunistic pathogen.",

In the present study, PCMV was the only pathogen isolated at a higher frequency from the control animals (43%) compared with the PRDC affected animals (24%), but a significant association between PCMV and PCV2 was only found in the cases of PRDC. Among the pathogen combinations, combination number 3 (P. multocida, PCMV, PCV2, M. hyopneumoniae and M. hyorhinis) was seen more frequently in acute cases of CBP than in subacute and chronic cases. This combination only differed from combination numbers 1 and 4 by the presence of PCMV, thus it can be speculated that presence of PCMV causes exacerbation of the disease. To our knowledge PCMV has not been associated with PRDC before, but the role of PCMV in PRDC is controversial and needs to be elucidated.",
