            "text": "Proteins recognized to have multiple functions have been termed \u2018moonlighting proteins\u2019 [1]. Ectoenzymes are perfect examples because the number of functions in which they are implicated is rapidly growing [2]. Here, a variety of functions of one member of this family, aminopeptidase N (APN, also known as CD13; EC.3.4.11.2), will be discussed, demonstrating that this protein can be considered a moonlighting ectoenzyme. Importantly, many of the functions attributed to CD13 have been observed after crosslinking with monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) 3, 4, overexpressing or silencing the protein in various cell lines [5] or blocking its enzymatic activity with chemical inhibitors [6], but a CD13-deficient animal has only recently been described [7]. Therefore, although the in vivo relevance of many of these functions has not yet been determined, the interest in CD13 as a therapeutic target has been progressively increasing 8, 9. Surprisingly, one aspect that is rarely considered is the fact that CD13 is a multifunctional protein and thus its ligation or the inhibition of its enzymatic activity might result in complex and systemic effects. This is a common limitation of enzyme inhibition therapy, but it was not anticipated for CD13-targeting drugs because of a lack of knowledge of some functions of CD13. This problem might be exacerbated by the also unrecognized fact that enzymatic activity-dependent and -independent functions appear to act in concert. For these reasons, it is important to review the data on all putative and established functions of CD13 and to discuss the possible molecular mechanisms involved so that further investigation aimed towards the clarification of some of these aspects is stimulated.",

This phenomenon could explain some of the functions that are triggered by antibodies that do not block the enzymatic activity but that could reduce the membrane levels of CD13 [4] and, therefore, the aminopeptidase activity. Several molecules known to be associated with CD13 appear to regulate its trafficking as a mechanism to regulate its function 12, 13. The potential importance of endocytosis in the regulation of the functions of CD13 is underscored by the reported mutations, single site polymorphisms and differences in the splicing frequencies of the human CD13 gene in patients with hematological malignancies. Some of these mutations lead to altered trafficking of CD13 14, 15, which could have pathophysiological implications.",

            "text": "Signal transduction has been proposed to account for some of the functions of CD13 that are independent of its enzymatic activity [4]. However, CD13 has been predicted to have a very short cytoplasmic domain that does not contain any known signaling motif (Figure 2\nand Box 1\n). For this reason, it is believed that its signaling capacity depends on its association with an \u2018auxiliary\u2019 protein of unknown identity [16]. Several proteins recently reported to associate with CD13, such as galectin-3 [4], galectin-4 [13], RECK (reversion-inducing cysteine-rich protein with Kazal motifs) [12] and the tumor-associated antigen L6 [17], might constitute auxiliary molecules contributing to its signaling capabilities.Box 1Structure, expression and their functional implicationsCD13 is a heavily glycosylated, \u223c160 kDa, type-II membrane protein. The coding part of the human gene (ANPEP) is located in chromosome 15 (q25-q26) [87]. It is expressed in the renal and intestinal epithelia, in the nervous system (synaptic membranes and pericytes), in myeloid cells (monocytes, macrophages and DCs) and in fibroblast-like cells, such as synoviocytes 88, 89. Its expression in endothelial cells (ECs) has also been reported [90], although others have claimed that in vivo, it is only expressed by activated or angiogenic ECs 68, 74. These contradictory reports might be explained by the sensitivity of the detection techniques used (immunohistochemistry and binding of peptides) or by the presence of discrete glycoforms or conformations of the protein, which might not be recognized by certain reagents 20, 72. Indeed, via substractive proteomics, it has been found that CD13 is expressed in normal rat microvascular ECs and is upregulated in tumor vessels [91]. Additionally, by sequential immunoprecipitation and deglycosilation techniques, five different forms of CD13, corresponding to differences in oligosacharide composition, were found on ECs and monocytes [20].Structurally, a seven domain organization of CD13 has been classically recognized (Figure 2a) [16]. Three-dimensional models of human APN/CD13 (hCD13) and the crystal structure of APN from E. coli have been published 92, 93, 94, 95. In the latter, a four domain organization was described in which the catalytic domain interacts with all other domains and the active site is inside a cavity covered by the C-terminal \u03b1-domain. This structure might not be shared by hCD13 because their sequence identity is low and hCD13 is a membrane-bound dimer. However, epitope mapping studies and mutations of the catalytic site of hCD13, as well as similar structures in other metallopeptidases of the M1 family, support an interaction between domains and a buried active site 93, 96. A small entrance to the catalytic site would explain the restricted activity of hCD13 to short peptides (Figure 2b). With regard to the conformations that might distinguish CD13 in tumors from normal vasculature [72], distinct conformations depending on the relative positions of the monomers and their mode of interaction have been reported for rabbit and pig CD13, which are both dimeric, membrane-bound proteins [97]. Conformational changes associated with substrate binding might correspond to changes in the inter-monomeric spacing rather than on the intramolecular conformation of each monomer, and mAb crosslinking might trigger signaling because of the shortening in distance between monomers during oligomerization.A soluble form of CD13 (sCD13) has long been recognized [98]. At a concentration of \u223c4.6 nM in human serum, it constitutes one of various N-terminal derivatives of its membrane-bound counterpart, processed by an unknown enzyme [99]. sCD13 blocks anti-CD13 mAb-induced adhesion [79], suggesting its potential regulatory role in membrane-bound CD13 functions. However, sCD13 is fully active enzymatically and thus its main role in vivo might be related to the cleavage of peptides at tumor or inflammation sites, where it has been repeatedly reported to be upregulated [100].",

The region of hCD13 between amino acids 288 and 295 has been identified as essential for HCoV-229E infection 24, 25. Enzymatic activity inhibitors or mutations of the active site do not affect virus binding to CD13. In most cases, CoVs of the serogroup 1 use CD13 as a receptor in a species-specific manner. However, feline CD13 serves as a receptor for all group 1 CoVs [26]. Differences in glycosylation between CD13 from the different species constitute one of the most important determinants for the species specificity of its receptor function [25].",

First, CD13 is differentially expressed in discrete states of differentiation of normal and neoplastic myeloid cells. This phenomenon accounts for its well-recognized utilization as a diagnostic marker of certain types of leukemia and lymphoma. For instance, CD13 is expressed on the majority of leukemic myeloblasts in acute myeloid leukemia, and although it is expressed by lymphocytes at their earliest stages of differentiation, it becomes negative as these cells mature [35]. Second, CD13 expression is regulated by differentiation agents, such as phorbol esters, transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2), interleukin (IL)-4 and IL-10 [36]. Finally, chemical inhibitors, such as bestatin and leuhistin, are known to modulate cellular differentiation in vitro. Although the specificity for CD13 has not always been demonstrated, in many cases blockade of the binding of bestatin by anti-CD13 antibodies results in a complete abrogation of its effect on differentiation. The phenomenon depends on the induction of the expression or secretion of growth factor or cytokine receptors, probably by inhibition of the enzymatic processing of peptides involved in their regulation [37].",

In this regard, it has also been reported that high levels of hCD13 correlate with leukemic-cell resistance to apoptosis. This resistance is overcome by treatment with bestatin, suggesting an involvement of the enzymatic activity [42]. However, the intracellular concentrations of bestatin appear to be important for its effect on cell proliferation, suggesting a mechanism different from inhibition of membrane-bound CD13 [43]. Furthermore, bestatin appears to exert its effect on proliferation even in cells that do not express detectable levels of CD13. Therefore, further work is necessary to clarify the role of CD13 in cell proliferation because inhibitors of its enzymatic activity might act through CD13-independent mechanisms. However, the effect of mAbs and the reported regulation of CD13 expression by cell-cycle-related transcription factors [44] support a direct participation of CD13 in this process. Regardless of the mechanism, the clinical use of these chemical inhibitors might be hindered by their effect in cell proliferation and therefore this is an aspect that requires further investigation. Additionally, it has recently been shown that bestatin enhaces the sensitivity of cervical cancer cells to radiation, underscoring the potential importance of the regulation of proliferation and death-related phenomena by CD13 inhibitors [45].",

Stable expression of membrane-bound CD13 on CL1-0 tumor cells or incubation with sCD13 greatly increases their migratory capacity. Cells expressing an enzymatically inactive mutant of CD13 also show increased migration, although they show less migration than cells expressing the enzymatically active form. CD13-targeting siRNA and highly specific chemical inhibitors block both the migration of endothelial cells (ECs) through matrigel and their motility during wound healing assays [5].

Similarly, CD13 participates in lymphocytic alveolitis after thoracic irradiation in rats, as well as in lymphocytic infiltration into the synovial fluid of patients with rheumatoid arthritis [52]. Importantly, CD13 degrades the chemokine CXCL11, downregulates CXCR4 and modulates stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1, also known as CXCL12)-induced migration 53, 54.

It has been reported that CD13 is a target for Ezetimibe (Merck/Schering-Plough Pharmaceuticals), an inhibitor of cholesterol intestinal absorption [62]. Although another protein, Niemann-Pick C1-like 1 (NPC1L1), was proposed to be the main target for the drug [63], it has recently been reported that Ezetimibe is equally capable of reducing cholesterol uptake in NPC1L1-deficient and wild-type mice [64]. Binding of photoreactive Ezetimibe to a 145 kDa protein on enterocyte membranes was shown to be sufficient for the effect of the drug, and purification of this protein identified it as CD13. Inhibition of cholesterol absorption by binding of Ezetimibe analogs to CD13 does not affect its enzymatic activity. Instead, it has been proposed that CD13 participates in the endocytosis of cholesterol by enterocytes and that binding of Ezetimibe to CD13 could: (i) affect its association with lipid rafts, inducing its internalization; (ii) downregulate the expression of raft-associated proteins implicated in cholesterol uptake (e.g. Fc\u03b3 receptors and CD36); and/or (iii) interrupt the association of CD13 with Fc\u03b3 receptors or CD36 by inducing a conformational change [65]. Because a functional cooperation between CD13 and Fc receptors has been reported [18], a link between the role of CD13 on cholesterol uptake and Fc\u03b3 receptor function can be proposed. It is known that lipoproteins regulate Fc\u03b3 receptor expression and Fc\u03b3-receptor-mediated phagocytosis. Thus, given the importance of cholesterol uptake by phagocytes in atherosclerosis and the fact that Ezetimibe blocks low-density lipoprotein (LDL) uptake in macrophages, determining whether CD13 is a target for Ezetimibe in these cells is an interesting question, which is currently being addressed.",

CD13 is not an exception. Its role in the process of capillary tube formation and as a marker of angiogenic vessels has been extensively investigated. Studies using phage display technologies to identify tumor-homing peptides resulted in the discovery of the asparagine-glycine-arginine (NGR) peptide, which resembles the integrin-binding peptide arginine-glycine-aspartic acid (RGD) [67]. Coupling antitumor drugs to the peptides RGD-4C or CNGRC (Cys-Asn-Gly-Arg-Cys) resulted in increased efficacy and lower toxicity. RGD peptides bind to \u03b1v-integrins. However, the RGD-4C peptide does not compete for integrin binding with phages displaying the NGR motif, which suggested the existence of a different receptor for NGR. The sequence WN/DDGWL was identified as a peptide mimic of the binding site of the RGD peptide on integrins. The fact that this sequence is present in the extracellular domain of CD13 (amino acid 404) led to the discovery that CD13 functions as a receptor for NGR in tumor blood vessels and other vessels undergoing angiogenesis 67, 68. Several studies have demonstrated the dramatically improved capacity of various drugs to target tumor angiogenic vessels in vivo when coupled to NGR or NGR-peptide liposomes 69, 70, 71.",

However, it was demonstrated that NGR\u2013tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and certain CD13-specific antibodies bind exclusively to CD13 expressed in tumors and not to CD13 expressed in normal tissues. This suggested that a different isoform of CD13 is expressed in tumors, further underscoring the potential of the NGR peptide for tumor targeting [72]. Others have shown that although NGR\u2013TNF does have some cytolytic activity towards CD13-expressing myeloid cell lines, this activity might depend on its binding to TNF receptors and not to CD13. However, the dose of peptide is critical. Thus, low doses of the drug permit efficient targeting without TNF-receptor-dependent toxicity [69]. Finally, the usefulness of NGR peptides as tools for detecting cardiac angiogenesis provides further evidence of the specificity of NGR peptides for angiogenic vasculature and expands their use to diagnostic applications [73].",

However, high doses of bestatin and antibodies were required, raising concerns over the potential therapeutic use of these tools. A recent publication addresses this concern, showing that continuous treatment with therapeutic doses of bestatin, but not other aminopeptidase inhibitors, results in abrogation of capillary tube formation, suggesting that the effect of bestatin is not specific for CD13 [6]. Nevertheless, many other studies have demonstrated the capacity of both bestatin and anti-CD13 antibodies to block angiogenesis in vivo, as well as the potential prognostic significance of CD13 in relation to angiogenic properties in some types of cancer [46]. Finally, CD13-null mice have unequivocally proven the importance of this molecule in angiogenesis [7]. These mice have dramatically decreased retinal neovascularization under hypoxic conditions, as well as reduced angiogenic responses to growth factors. One of the mechanisms involved appears to relate to the association of CD13 with galectin-3 in ECs [75]. Galectin-3 has been proposed as a therapeutic target for tumors originating from malignant endothelia. Therefore, the functional association between CD13 and galectin-3 underlines their importance for antiangiogenic therapies.",

The expanding list of autoimmune diseases in which anti-CD13 autoantibodies and/or high levels of aminopeptidase activity are present 29, 81, 82 suggests their participation in the pathogenesis of these diseases. IBD and rheumatoid arthritis, for instance, could be interesting models in which to test the efficacy of anti-CD13 targeting tools, especially in view of the recent reports on anti-inflammatory effects of combined CD13/CD26 blockade in vivo\n9, 83.",

The NGR peptide, when coupled to TNF-\u03b1, melphalan, doxorubicin, interferon-\u03b1 and endothelial-monocyte-activating polypeptide II, has already been demonstrated to improve their efficacy in vivo\n84, 85. However, although the current reports are promising both with regard to the low antigenicity of the peptide and to its specificity for tumor vessels, the potential of targeting other cell types, such as myeloid cells, has not been completely ruled out. New insights into these issues will hopefully result from basic research and clinical trials currently under development, in which understanding the mechanism of action of the drug will be a major goal.",

Therefore, given the importance of some of the functions discussed and the dramatic effect of CD13 manipulation in vitro, the next challenge for translational progress in the field will be to take these studies into in vivo systems to allow a better understanding of their real pathophysiological relevance, as well as more rational design of CD13-targeting drugs.

Each of these mechanisms result in the biological phenomena listed on the right side of part (b). Some complex phenomena, such as angiogenesis, invasion and chemotaxis, must occur as a result of the interplay between enzymatic activity and signaling functions. Similarly, upon virus or maybe even cholesterol and NGR-peptide binding (especially NGR-targeted liposomal drugs), the receptor functions could mediate signal transduction required for endocytosis.

Amino acids (aa) forming each domain are indicated on the left. Modified from Ref. [16], with kind permission of Springer Science and Business Media.

(b) Schematic hypothetical four-domain model of human CD13, as proposed in Box 1. The possible conformational changes occurring upon substrate binding and the available data on the structure of other human enzymes were taken into account to modify the previous model. The active site (domain III) would be covered by the C-terminal domain (IV), and a conformational change would expose the catalytic site to allow the entrance of substrates. This process could be explained by the utilization, by substrates, of an initial recognition site such as the exopeptidase GXMEN motif, as has already been proposed for CD13 and other M1 family members. Monomers are closely apposed to allow the predicted rollover mechanism occurring during the dynamic opening and closing of the active site, as proposed by Lendeckel et al. [92].",

(b) Substrate or inhibitor binding to the initial contact site induces a conformational change that exposes the cryptic active site as well as other cryptic epitopes that lie close to it, resulting in activation or inhibition of the enzymatic activity [22]. This conformational change might also involve the release of galectins and, consequently, the concomitant unmasking of the carbohydrate moieties involved in ligand binding, which could explain the potentiation of signaling functions by substrates [78]. Upon the exposure of cryptic epitopes, anti-CD13 autoantibodies or ligands (c,d) bind to and crosslink CD13, resulting in oligomerization and signaling. In the absence of a pre-bound substrate, oligomerization by multivalent ligands, such as antibodies and viruses, might be sufficient to trigger signaling or internalization 3, 4. (e) Additionally, substrate, antibody or virus-associated proteins regulate the endocytosis of CD13 4, 11, 12, which might constitute a mechanism of signaling and inhibition of its enzymatic activity and could be responsible for its dissociation from galectins and adaptor molecules. This would explain some of the functions modulated by mAbs that do not block the enzymatic activity.",
