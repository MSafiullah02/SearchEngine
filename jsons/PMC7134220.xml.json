Digital entrepreneurship, on the other hand, diverges from this definition seeing as it involves entrepreneurial pursuits which occur on a digital platform [2]. Digital entrepreneurs have a reliance on digital media tools and Information Technology (IT) in the pursuit of entrepreneurial prospects [2]. Digital entrepreneurship ensues when an asset owned by a business, a service performed by a business or a fundamental element of a business has been digitised [3]. Digital entrepreneurship expands on the traditional notion of entrepreneurship in the sense that it includes a set of participants which is constantly evolving and is highly diverse [4]. This moves away from the traditional, established participant to a more ever-changing assemblage of participants who possess their own, and differing, competencies, aspirations, and, ultimately, purposes [3, 4].",

The rate of technological development is at an all-time, ever-increasing high, and digital entrepreneurs are mindful of the opportunities that this growth is creating [5, 6]. To capitalise on these opportunities, entrepreneurs are looking towards digital transformation. Digital transformation can be defined as companies who alter their operations, and, in broader terms, it can also refer to the persistent change of our civilization through the use of technology [6, 7]. Digital transformation involves the redesign of business practices to incorporate digital technology within all facets of the business [7]. Digital entrepreneurs are offered significant opportunity through the use of digital networking capabilities. These opportunities present themselves through users of digital mediums who can now be offered support, can respond to messages and can offer constructive criticism and suggestions which organisations can utilize [3].",

Using business processes and capabilities to achieve the wants of customers is of paramount importance to up-and-coming companies and their digital entrepreneurs [3, 8]. Digitisation spanning all functions and operations of a business can be considered more and more difficult the larger the organisation [3, 8]. The practice of large companies updating obsolete and outdated business systems to modernized, digital systems can be problematic owing to the irregularities found within these systems [9]. Other challenges related to digital transformation point to occurrences where existing business models generate sufficient profit to ward off the need for establishing new, digitised products and services for clients to purchase [10].",

Business entrepreneurship is a form of entrepreneurship which is most commonly heard-of and discussed. It explains the practice of seeking out or identifying business opportunities which can be exploited [17]. These practices include new product or service creation, raw material identification and use, new industry creation, new forms of business and more [18]. Knowledge entrepreneurship is categorised by the identification and quest for information or knowledge-based prospects and encompasses the expansion of existing knowledge-bases as well as the development of new ones [19]. Institutional entrepreneurship characterises the actions of entrepreneurs who make use of resources in the pursuit of creating new organisations or upgrading old ones [20]. Digital entrepreneurship is subsequently a combination of the above three entrepreneurial practices. Digital entrepreneurs synergistically combine business, institutional and knowledge entrepreneurship and this combination forms the basis of being able to take traditional practices, such as the business categories listed above, and alter them digitally [14, 21].",

Gale and Aarons [22] studied companies which had undergone digital transformation and found that they are able to gain competitive advantages by simultaneously lowering their expenses, innovating and becoming more organized and competent. Additionally, true mastery of an organisation\u2019s supply-chain activities will arise from digital transformation [23]. As a result of this digital transformation necessity, companies need to design and create strategies in order to make digital transformation possible [6, 7]. A digital business strategy can be described as a corporate strategy designed, created and implemented making use of digital resources to create new and unexploited worth [24].",

It is less complicated and more cost-effective to attract customers who are purchasing nothing than it is to poach or sway customers who are loyal to existing companies or competitors.

An SLR process comprises of 3 consecutive stages: (1) planning, (2) execution and (3) result analysis [30]. Planning involves defining the research objectives and the manner in which the review will be carried out. Execution points to the study selection and the data collection, while result analysis encompasses the data synthesis and results discussion [29, 30]. The planning phase was guided by the aim of the research study, namely, to propose a digital entrepreneurship framework enabled by digital transformation. Technical reports, academic books and specific scientific databases were chosen for the SLR process. The sources considered are shown in Table 1 in the database column as they hold the most important and highest impact full-text journals and conference proceedings in the digital technologies field.\n",

Critical to the success of almost all organisations globally is their ability to create, maintain and prioritise relationships, and even more so for entrepreneurs. These are relationships between the entrepreneur and other organisations within and outside of their market, their suppliers, their employees and, most importantly, with their customers; prioritising communication channels with their customer base have significant competitive advantages over their competitors. Digitisation facilitates communication, making it pivotal to the continuing success of an entrepreneur therefore, understanding digitisation is critical. Digitisation, however, does not mean success is automatically and easily attainable. While digitisation offers a range of opportunities to entrepreneurs, enacting it is not a guarantee of success to entrepreneurs. There is also an array of other issues which need to be carefully considered, managed and mitigated. There are resource issues, social issues, network requirements, market availability and competitors which will constantly keep entrepreneurs vigilant, regardless of how digitised their organisation has become. Employee involvement is also important as having the best technology, processes, strategies, operations, partners and opportunities in a market cannot add any value if the company has no one to endorse all of these aforementioned strengths. The benefits of any technology can only be realised when it is being truly accepted and utilised. User acceptance of technologies and the influences on user attitudes, customer engagement and business operations have been widely researched, and is a key characteristic enabling digital entrepreneurship.",

This is knowledge of systems, customers, employees, strategies, threats, opportunities, and any other form of information which an organisation can be sustained and improved using. Managing and effectively distributing knowledge throughout an organisation is crucial to both maintaining success as well as pioneering expansion. Traditional organisations are heavily structured, rigid bodies which possess a great deal of hierarchy. Upper management and associated strategists decide on the direction of the organisation and dictate that direction to subordinates. This may slow down progress drastically compared to fast-paced, new-age companies. E-strategies bolster competitive advantage. As we move further and further into the digital age, e-business strategies are becoming cardinal to successful operations, sustenance and development of all organisations, especially those which primarily operate within the digital realm. Organisations which employ e-strategies are experiencing advantages over competitors who are not engaging in strategies of a similar nature. Adoption can be increased or reduced based on a number of factors. There is a broad spectrum of reasons organisations are either excited or reluctant to adopt new technologies and practices. These reasons include cost, competitive advantage, learning curves, training, revenue potential and all other factors which are relevant to adoption. Entrepreneurship can also come from within. While entrepreneurship is primarily associated with private, self-employed individuals starting companies, it is important to note that entrepreneurship can arise from within an existing organisation. Emerging markets allow for entrepreneurs to go from being employees within an organisation to becoming self-sufficient entrepreneurs, creating new businesses within those markets.",

Business intelligence offers information on technology, applications, processes, dashboards and other key tools entrepreneurs require to be successful and organisations require to successfully transform themselves. Disruption comes from new market creation. The creation of a new market is a common occurrence when investigating disruptive companies. Creating a new market, which solves the needs of customers across a variety of existing markets, can be crucial to incumbent organisations sustaining their success. Organisations creating new markets and obtaining a large share of that market, while negatively impacting on the performance of organisations in other, related markets, can cause a great deal of disruption. Disruption comes from existing markets. Disruption from within already-established markets is an alternative, but equally common, approach to causing disruption for organisations which are incumbent to that market. When there is a number of organisations operating within and profiting from the same market, competitor activity may disrupt the market they know and capitalize off of, could be fundamentally changed. Production competence comes from technology. The ability of an organisation to produce competently is based on a variety of mechanisms. And technology is at the centre of these mechanisms. Maintaining production competence in industries where competitors are constantly improving their technology can be harmful to organisations who are not improving their technology. There are a number of barriers to the initial adoption of technology as well as to improving existing technology, but the challenges of these changes could be outweighed by the negative effects that the failure to change carries.",

            "text": "Costs of adoption are a primary negative. There is a multitude of possible reasons why organisations do not want to adopt new technologies, techniques or operating methods. Chief among these reasons is that of cost. The inordinate costs associated with both adopting new technologies or operational methods, as well as improving on existing technology or operational methods, is the principal reason organisations are reluctant to digitally transform. Technology improves compatibility and working between organisations. Communication, mutual operation and successful interactions between organisations is facilitated and improved by technology. Traditional channels of business are supplemented with technology, where organisations which rely on each other have superior means of communication and operational efficiency stemming from their use of supporting technology. Digitisation allows for virtual teamwork. Traditionally, employees would have face-to-face interactions with one another at a physical workplace. However, owing to digitisation, organisations are now able to create virtual teams, which have the potential to span a city, a country, or the globe. As a result, teams can cooperate with one another at anytime from anywhere in the world without having to physically meet. This allows for new perspective, ways of working, problem solving and round-the-clock working on the same projects as well as more flexibility and employee freedom.",

Characteristics pertinent to sensing and shaping opportunity includes the creation of self-employment through prospects based on an entrepreneurs\u2019 drive to succeed. Digital transformation in this instance provides opportunities to create new markets or to optimise existing collaborations and the understanding of digitisation may shape additional prospects. Digitisation enables digital entrepreneurship and digital transformation. The management, and the successful implementation thereof, is what allows for lucrative digital entrepreneurship and digital transformation to take place. Characteristics relevant to seizing opportunity are based on an entrepreneurs\u2019 ability to exploit prospects that may be derived from existing market- or digital transformation strategies. The potential of technology in improving productivity also presents opportunity. Technology is employed, in some form or another, by incumbent organisations which dominate markets, start-ups, entrepreneurs and by those who are transforming organisations. The fact that traditional organisations may slow down progress is highlighted as a characteristic to be aware of in a digital entrepreneurship endevour. Characteristics applicable to maintaining competitiveness include features pertaining to an entrepreneur profile such as traits, work satisfaction, relationships, collaboration, technology adoption and the management of knowledge. The facilitative role of data and business intelligence on entrepreneurship and transformation, must be considered and the cost of adoption is a characteristic highlighting potential drawbacks to be cognisant of.",
