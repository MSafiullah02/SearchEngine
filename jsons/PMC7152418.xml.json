Rotaviruses invade and destroy the villus epithelial cells of the small intestine. This results in malabsorption of nutrients. Asymptomatic infections may occur in older calves and in adult cows. In cows, excretion of virus is particularly common around the time of calving. This is one method by which infection persists on a farm. Once an outbreak has started, diarrheic calves are the major source of contagion.",

At least three strains of bovine coronavirus are responsible for respiratory infection, neonatal diarrhea, and winter dysentery. However, the winter dysentery and neonatal calf strains can infect both calves and adults. In calves, coronaviruses invade and destroy villous epithelial cells of the small intestine, causing villous atrophy. They also invade the epithelium of the large intestine. Because coronaviruses affect the large intestine, they may be associated with signs of colitis such as straining. Like rotavirus, excretion of coronavirus by asymptomatic adults may be an initial source of infection for calves. Clinically affected calves are the major source of virus once an outbreak is established.3., 8., 9., 10., 11., 12., 13., 14.\n",

A second fimbrial attachment factor, the F41 antigen, has also been identified, but it is generally found together with F5 fimbria. Other attachment factors may exist. Enterotoxigenic E. coli produces enterotoxin (a heat stable form, ST) that stimulates secretion of sodium together with water and chloride ions by the mucosal cells. Enterotoxigenic E. coli also causes some villous atrophy.20., 21., 22., 23., 24., 25. In general, enterotoxigenic E. coli causes diarrhea in calves 1 to 4 days of age; in some cases this is profuse and watery and can rapidly result in hypovolemic shock and death. Enterotoxigenic E. coli can also secondarily infect older calves in which the mucosal cell type has been altered by prior infection with another pathogen.",

Other eae-carrying E. coli can be pathogenic as the result of the presence of other cytotoxic genes. In general, AEEC produce diarrhea in calves from 2 days to about 6 weeks of age. The bacteria adhere to the surface of the colon and sometimes the small intestine. Some are also internalized. The bacteria efface the surface microvilli and cause patchy mucosal stunting, erosion, and sloughing. At gross postmortem examination, changes vary from minimal to ileitis with mucohemorrhagic colitis.

Hyponatremia and whole-body potassium depletion are the result of loss of electrolytes with the diarrhea.52., 53., 54., 55. However, calves presented to veterinarians for treatment may be either hyponatremic or hypernatremic, presumably because oral electrolyte use by farmers is now widespread. Diarrheic calves may be hyperkalemic, normokalemic, or hypokalemic despite whole-body potassium depletion secondary to increased fecal loss. Hyperkalemia is the result of several factors; acidemia and hypoglycemia favor movement of potassium from the intracellular to the extracellular space, as does hypothermia, which slows cellular metabolism.

In calves with mild acidemia and base deficits less than 10 mmol/L, rehydrating the calf with lactated or acetated Ringer's solution is often sufficient to correct acidosis. More severe acidemia responds best to sodium bicarbonate solution, a fact that has been empirically proven in randomized, controlled, blinded trials in diarrheic calves.61., 72., 73. Typically, correction of acidosis requires 1 to 4 L (25 to 100 mL/kg) of isotonic 1.3% sodium bicarbonate administered over about 4 to 8 hours. The remaining fluid deficits are met with isotonic saline solution.",

Avoid running cows or heifers through a small calving area (e.g., one particular corral or a barn). These rapidly become contaminated and a source of neonatal infection. Small herds, fewer than 40 cows, have a lower incidence of scour problems. Large herds may be best split into groups of 50 to 75 head and managed separately. Stocking density is important; cattle managed at pasture with large amounts of space have less diarrhea than those managed more intensively in corrals at calving time. However, if the weather is adverse, cattle managed at pasture will crowd together into a small space if adequate shelter is not available. There should be a minimum of 100 m2 and ideally 200 m2 (1000 to 2000 ft2) of area per cow. This area must be clean and sheltered from adverse weather. Damp conditions and standing water are a major risk factor for scours, particularly if more than 5% of the nursing area is affected. Contaminated water can be ingested and directly infect calves. Damp or muddy conditions favor the accumulation of dirt on the flanks, udder, and teats of the cow, where it will be ingested during nursing or grooming. The calving and nursing areas should be well drained, and any standing water should be fenced off. Drinking water should be provided from a clean source. Separating cows and heifers before calving is critically important. This allows the heifers to receive better nutrition. Calves born to heifers are much more likely to develop diarrhea; by separating these high-risk calves, spread to the rest of the herd is reduced. The diet fed to the cows should be complete and balanced. A high percentage of heifers, more than 20%, indicates herd expansion. However, it is also a risk factor for scours. When herds are being expanded it is particularly important to ensure that all other aspects of management are optimized. Another practice that may be beneficial is having an isolation area to treat diarrheic calves. This is likely to be of particular benefit for early cases, before contagion spreads throughout the facilities. Producers should be discouraged from buying in calves to replace a calf lost to dystocia or disease\u2014this is an easy way to import disease.",

The next most important factor is cleanliness; at calving both cows and calving area should be clean. The calf-rearing facility must be clean, the feeding utensils must be clean at every feeding, and the feed must be clean. Cleanliness requires constant attention. A variety of factors have been implicated in increasing the risk of calf diarrhea or fecal excretion of cryptosporidia (Table 21-3\n).
