            "text": "A one-step reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) assay for the detection of norovirus (NV) was developed. In order to design primer sets for the detection of a wide range of NVs, NVs were categorized into three groups, that is, genogroup I (GI), prevalent GII, and minor GII; three sets of primers were developed for each group. Clinical specimens of patients suffering from enteric RNA viruses, such as NV, group A and C rotavirus, and sapovirus were examined using these primer sets. Various genotypes of NVs were detected in clinical specimens from patients infected with NV where no false positive reaction was observed with other enteric RNA viruses. Additionally, 88 samples of acute gastroenteritis outbreaks were analyzed by an RT-LAMP assay and compared with the results of routine RT-PCR. The results of the RT-LAMP assay corresponded well to that of RT-PCR. These findings suggest the practical application of the RT-LAMP assay for the detection of NVs in clinical specimens. Consequently, the RT-LAMP system and conventional detection kits (NVGI and NVGII detection kits; Eiken Chemical Co., Ltd., Japan) were compared. The detection rate of the prevalent and minor GII primer sets was similar to that of the conventional NVGII kit, while the detection rate of the GI primer set is different because it can detect several genotypes better than the conventional NVGI kit. This is an initial report that the RT-LAMP system is able to detect NVs in clinical specimens within a wide range.",

However, five genogroups (G) including animal NVs (in pigs, cows, and mice) have been tentatively reported using the molecular characterization of complete capsid gene sequences [Green et al., 1995; Vinje et al., 2000; Fankhauser et al., 2002; Karst et al., 2003; Oliver et al., 2003; Zheng et al., 2006] . Three of these five Gs contain human strains (genogroup I (GI), GII, and GIV) [Zheng et al., 2006] . The National Institute of Infectious Diseases (NIID, Tokyo, Japan) group proposed slightly different NV genotyping using a precise scheme based on variability of the capsid N-terminal/shell (N/S) domain gene [Kageyama et al., 2004] . They identified a total of 31 genotypes (14 genotypes in GI and 17 genotypes in GII). Frequently detected GII genotypes such as GII.2, 3, 4, 6, and 12 (prevalent GII) are classified as the same genotypes in GII for both classifications [Kageyama et al., 2004; Zheng et al., 2006] , whereas infrequently detected GII genotypes (minor GII) are classified mainly into different genotypes in GII according to both classifications. Zheng et al. [2006] categorized GII.17 of Kageyama's classification in GIV. All genotypes used in this report follow Kageyama's classification [Kageyama et al., 2004] .",

The LAMP assay is also very effective for RNA template detection using reverse transcriptase (RTase) together with DNA polymerase. Detection of RNA viruses are reported as such, West Nile virus , Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus [Hong et al., 2004] , and Dengue virus [Parida et al., 2005] using a reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) assay.

Ninety-four samples had been analyzed previously for bacterial incubation and enteric virus (such as NV, group A and C rotavirus, sapovirus, astrovirus, and enteric adenovirus). These 94 samples were used to evaluate both of the RT-LAMP systems (OPIPH system and the conventional RT-LAMP kit) and the results were compared with routine RT-PCR assays (Table II) . Subsequently, the newly developed RT-LAMP assay was used as one of the methods for investigating 8 acute outbreaks of gastroenteritis composed of 88 clinical specimens. Five of those outbreak incidents were suspected as cases of personto-person transmission and one incident was a foodborne illness. Before the investigation, the causes of the other two cases were not clear (Table IV) . The specimens had been stored as 10% suspensions in saline at 48C.",

            "text": "NV-specific RT-LAMP primers were designed in the relatively conserved region (RNA polymerase region to N-terminal capsid region, ORF1 to ORF2). Due to their diversity, the NVs were categorized into three categories, that is, GI (GI.1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, and 12) , prevalent GII (GII.2, 3, 4, 6, and 12), and minor GII (GII.1, 5, 7, 8, 14, 16, and 17) . The nucleotide sequences of strains including prototypes based on published sequences were aligned with the available sequences of other strains* (Genbank accession numbers are described at the end of this paragraph) using DNASIS software (Hitachi Software, Tokyo, Japan). A set of six primers was designed as shown in Figure 1 ; outer primers (F3 and B3), a forward inner primer (FIP), a backward inner primer (BIP), and loop primers (FLP and BLP). The FIP primer consisted of the F1c sequence, a TTTT spacer, and the F2 sequence. In the same way, BIP contained the B1c sequence, a TTTT spacer, and the B2 sequence. Two additional loop primers were designed to accelerate the amplification reaction. The primers recognized eight distinct regions on the target sequence ( Fig. 1 ) and were designed by employing the LAMP primer design support software program version 2 (Net Laboratory, Japan: http://venns.netlaboratory.com). In addition to the general criteria described [Notomi et al., 2000] , terminal dimer formation, 3 0 hairpin formation, and self-complementary were avoided. Special attention was given to adjust the melting temperature (Tms) of the primers in such a way that the Tms were in the following order: F1c and B1c > F2 and B2 > F3 and B3. All 3 primer sets were composed of more than 6 primers (12-15 primers) in order to address the variations of the NV sequences. Table I lists the details of the oligonucleotide primers used for the LAMP assay. All primers were OPC cartridge purified grade and synthesized by Nihon Gene Research Laboratories, Inc. (NGR, Inc., Sendai, Japan).",

The mixture was incubated at 628C for 60 min in a Loopamp real-time turbidimeter (LA-320; Teramecs, Kyoto City, Japan). Real-time measurement of turbidity is available using an inexpensive photometer [Mori et al., 2001] since the amplification of DNA is directly correlated with the production of magnesium pyrophosphate leading to turbidity. The reaction was considered to be positive when the turbidity became 0.1 within 60 min. To facilitate the field application of the RT-LAMP assay, the results of amplification by the RT-LAMP assay were obtained through naked-eye inspection using Fluorescent Detection Reagent (FDR) (Eiken Chemical Co., Ltd.). Briefly, the RT-LAMP assay was performed in the same way as described above except with the addition of 1.5 ml of FDR to the mixture before the reaction. The reaction mixture was incubated at 628C for 60 min and then heated at 808C for 2 min to terminate the reaction using heat blocks and observed with the naked eye. FDR (calcein) binds with the manganese ion and remains quenched. When the LAMP amplification reaction occurs, a by-product, pyrophosphate, deprives FDR (calcein) of the manganese ion, which results in the emission of fluorescence. When the free calcein binds to the magnesium ion in the reaction mixture, the fluorescence emission becomes stronger.",

The third incident consisted of patients and asymptomatic persons who were responsible for cooking and serving food. The results of RT-LAMP and RT-PCR indicated that this incident appeared to be a case of person-to-person infection rather than being foodborne. Based on an epidemiological study, the fourth incident was thought to be a foodborne outbreak. As a result of RT-PCR (including sequence analysis), it was judged to be a case of foodborne transmission, as shown in Table IV . The sixth case was an NV outbreak in an elementary school, and all five samples came from patients. In the seventh case, all the primer sets of the RT-LAMP assay showed no non-specific reaction because this case was caused by group C rotavirus.

The RT-PCR method usually requires 2 days to confirm that a RT-PCR product is NV, while only 1 hr is required for an RT-LAMP assay. In this study, NVs were categorized initially into three groups for designing the appropriate primer sets. GI occupies about 10% of NV infection. Among GII NVs, genotypes GII.2, 3, 4, 6, and 12 are frequently detected, so this group was categorized as prevalent GII. In contrast, genotypes such as GII.1, 5, and 7 are not often detected; GII.8, 9, 10, 11, 13, 14, 15, 16, and 17 were not detected in OPIPH during 2004-2005 . Therefore, these GII genotypes were categorized as minor GII. To separate the target genotypes into three groups, well-designed primer sets were developed, as shown in Table I . The detection rates of various genotype NVs between the OPIPH system and the conventional kit were compared using 79 clinical specimens from patients infected with NVs. The specificity of the OPIPH system were examined using 15 other enteric RNA viruses in outbreaks and/or sporadic cases. The results showed that the OPIPH system and the conventional kit indicated similar detection rates for GII NVs. The striking difference between the two systems was that the detection rate of GI NVs was much greater in the OPIPH system than in the conventional kit (Table II) . Regarding the specificity of the OPIPH system, no non-specific reactions were observed against other enteric RNA viruses (Table II) . The reaction of the new primer set showed good reproducibility within the sensitivity range, as indicated in Figure 2a ,b.

The sensitivity obtained by Fukuda et al.

When the sensitivities of the RT-LAMP system, the OPIPH system, and the conventional kit were compared using clinical specimens, the OPIPH system showed better sensitivity than that of the conventional kit. One hundred and 1,000 times greater sensitivity for GII.3 and GI.3, respectively, was observed for OPIPH system than for the conventional kit, where similar sensitivities were observed for other NVs in both systems (Table III) . In other features, the conventional kit from Eiken Chemical Co. requires a heat treatment before 60 min incubation at 638C to avoid non-specific reactions. In contrast, the RT-LAMP assay in the OPIPH system showed no non-specific reactions without heat treatment. The advantages of using OPIPH RT-LAMP systems compared with conventional NV detection kits are: (1) sensitivity is higher in some NV genotypes (GI.3 and GII.3); (2) specific GI genotypes (GI.3, 11, and 12) that cannot be detected by a conventional GI kit can be detected by the GI primer set developed in this study; and (3) additional treatment, that is, heating at 958C for 5 min and being kept on ice for 5 min, is not required in the OPIPH system.",

In addition to the above advantages, the availability of the results without opening the lid by either using FDR or a real-time turbidimeter reduces contamination. In this regard, it will be a valuable assay method for the accurate and rapid detection of NVs in laboratories under all sorts of conditions including use in developing countries. An automated RNA extractor was used in this study, but a conventional RNA extraction kit such as a QIAamp viral RNA mini kit (QIAGEN) could be used for RNA extraction. The RT-LAMP assay will be the first candidate to be recommended for laboratories whose needs are the diagnosis or detection of NVs. RT-PCR assay should be used for subsequent molecular epidemiological analysis after the RT-LAMP assay. This RT-LAMP system was developed to meet the growing demand for detection of NVs. Although a conventional RT-LAMP kit for the detection of NVs has become available, the quality of this kit is unsatisfactory, especially for the detection of NV GI. Comparison of the OPIPH system with the conventional kit proved that the OPIPH system has advantages in diagnosing outbreaks of acute gastroenteritis, especially those caused by GI. Nevertheless, the RT-LAMP assay method for NV detection has just been developed and there is great diversity among NVs. Based on these factors, further studies are needed to evaluate the true value of the RT-LAMP assay for detecting NVs compared with routine RT-PCR system.",
