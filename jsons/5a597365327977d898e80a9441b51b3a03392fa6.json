Rotavirus is a double stranded RNA virus with a genome comprising 11 linear segments, each encoding one or two virus proteins (VPs 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7). VP4 and VP7, the outer capsid proteins encoded by respectively genome segments 4 and 9 are both involved in attachment to and entry into enterocytes and are the major rotavirus-neutralizing antigens. Epitopes on VP7 define the G (for glycoprotein) types whereas those on VP4 define the P (for proteasesensitive) types. Currently 14 G and 20 P types have been described. Globally, G1-G4 are the most common G types although there is a tremendous diversity as, for example, while G8 has caused 30% of gastro-enteritis in Malawi [Cunliffe et al., 2001a] , G5 was the G type most often isolated in South America [Gouvea et al., 1994] , and other novel serotypes (e.g., G9) have been reported worldwide recently [Ramachandran et al., 2000; Cunliffe et al., 2002b] .",

After informed consent, participants were interviewed to ascertain their demographic and social background and clinical history.

EM was performed using a Philip 301 electron microscope (Philips Electron optics UK Division, PYE Unicam, Ltd, Cambridge, UK) [Madeley, 1997] at a screen magnification of 45,000\u00c2. Grids were scanned horizontally along the rows of the grid squares from end to end at three different locations. Rotavirus antigens were detected using the Rotaclone EIA kit (Meridian Diagnostics, Cincinnati, OH) as described by the manufacturer. EIA positive samples were suspended in phosphate buffered saline at a concentration of 10% for dsRNA extraction. Suspensions were clarified by centrifugation and dsRNA was extracted using a guanidine isothiocyanate/silica method developed by Boom et al. and modified by Gentsch et al. [1992] . Extracted RNA was eluted in 70 ml of RNase free water and used directly for polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and RT-PCR. For PAGE, 30 ml of purified dsRNA was heated at 658C for 10 min and electrophoresed for 120 min at 150 V on 10% polyacrylamide gel. Controls of known long and short electropherotypes were included on each gel. After silver nitrate staining [Herring et al., 1982] , the gels were photographed to determine the electropherotypes. Rotavirus G-and P-genotypes were determined using a multiplex RT-PCR as described by Gouvea et al. [1990] and Gentsch et al. [1992] .",

Rotavirus infection had a similar pattern in outpatient children as most cases were detected from February to March (the cold winter season) and was rare during the hot summer months between June and August. Rotavirus, however, was responsible for a lower proportion of cases of diarrhoea in the health centres where other viruses (mainly calicivirus and coronavirus) were also identified frequently. Most asymptomatic rotavirus infections identified in surgical controls occurred at the peak of the rotavirus season.

            "text": "Rotavirus has a marked seasonal variation in this region and was isolated most frequently from November to February with 50% of rotaviruses recovered in these months. These results are in agreement with studies reporting a peak of rotavirus in winter months in temperate regions. The peak incidence, however, is different to a previous study from Tehran [Amini et al., 1990 ], which reported a higher incidence in the spring. Although the peak incidence occurred in the winter, the incidence of rotavirus was still high in the spring. We would need to continue surveillance for rotavirus to elucidate whether the two studies have demonstrated a different seasonal pattern in two towns, or variations in the annual incidence with a higher rotavirus incidence in the year when our study took place. The frequency of detection of other viruses, besides rotavirus, was higher in outpatient children. This is likely to result from the milder diarrhoea caused by these viruses. Similar to rotavirus, astrovirus and adenovirus were identified mostly in the cooler semester of the year. This is the most frequent season for these viruses in temperate climates and varies from tropical areas, when these viruses often occur during the rainy season [Sethi et al., 1989] . The data, however, did not demonstrate a clear pattern, as the calicivirus and coronavirus frequencies were too small to find statistical differences. In addition, although coronavirus have been reported as a cause of diarrhoeal disease, their role is unclear [Zhang et al., 1994] . Adenoviruses however seemed to coincide with the rotavirus season and calicivirus appeared after this season from May to June. However it is stressed that the prevalence of calicivirus reported here is likely to be an underestimate as EM is not the most sensitive method for detecting the virus [Kirkwood and Bishop, 2001] . Viruses other than rotavirus however did not seem to cluster around any specific month.",

It is noteworthy that a large number of rotaviruses could not be G or P typed with the conventional primers described by Gouvea et al. [1990] and Gentsch et al. [1992] and additional primers were required that substantially increased the number of typable strains in our collection. The monthly distribution of the G and P types shows that the G2 and P[4] and non-typeable G and P were most often seen at the last and first months of the year and other P-G combinations were seen during the year, reflecting that there is a large diversity of rotavirus strains during the year. G1, G2, P[8], and P[4] are among the most common global rotavirus serotypes and should be covered by existing rotavirus vaccines [Hoshino and Kapikian, 2000] .",
