            "text": "The specificity of influenza C-virus binding to sialoglycoconjugates was tested with various naturally. O-acetylated gangliosides or synthetically O-acetylated sialic acid thioketosides, which revealed binding to 9-O-acetylated Nacetylneuraminic acid. Binding was also observed with a sample of Neu5,TAc2-GD3, however at a lower degree. Sialic acids with two or three O-acetyl groups in the side chain of synthetic sialic acid derivatives are not recognized by the virus. In these experiments, bound viruses were detected with esterase substrates. Influenza Cvirus was also used for the histological identification of mono-O-acetylated sialic acids in combination with an immunological visualization of the virus bound to thin-sections. The occurrence of these sialic acids was demonstrated in bovine submandibular gland, rat liver, human normal adult and fetal colon and diseased colon, as well as in human sweat gland. Submandibular gland and colon also contain significant amounts of glycoconjugates with two or three acetyl esters in the sialic acid side chain, demonstrating the value of the virus in discriminating between mono-and higher O-acetylation at the same site. The patterns of staining showed differences between healthy persons and patients with colon carcinoma, ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease. Remarkably, some human colon samples did not show O-acetyl sialic acid-specific staining. The histochemical observations were controlled by chemical analysis of tissue sialic acids.",

During the last few years there has been a growing interest in the occurrence, metabolism and especially function o f O-acetylated sialic acids o f glycoproteins and gangliosides. So far, O-acetylated sialic acids have been found to render complex carbohydrates more resistant to sialidase action and are thus believed to extend the lifetime of, for example, serum glycoproteins, blood cells [4] , or colon mucin [5, 6] . They also hinder the invasion of mouse erythrocytes by malaria parasites [7] and inhibit the recognition of sialic acids by sialoadhesin of mouse macrophages [8] or by the lymphocyte receptor CD22 [9] . An antirecognition effect of 9-O-acetylated sialic acids is also exerted on the interaction of cells with influenza A and B viruses, which bind only to non-Oacetylated sialic acids [10] . O-Acetylated sialic acids appear to play significant roles in the function of neuronal tissues, such as in the development of rat brain [11, 12] .",

Problems generally observed with these methods include incomplete release of sialic acids, de-Oacetylation [2] and migration of O-acetyl groups [28] . Thus, new methods, which allow the detection of Oacetylated sialic acids on glycoconjugates without previous liberation, are of great interest. The receptor determinant for influenza C-virus has been shown to be Neu5,9Ac2 and the virus has been used to detect glycoconjugates containing this sialic acid in a solid phase assay and overlay techniques [29, 30] . Since a direct demonstration of binding to 7-mono-O-acetyl sialic acid and oligo-acetyl sialic acids has not been presented, further studies were carried out to clarify this specificity using gangliosides and synthetic sialyl glycosides.",

When both gangliosides were immobilized on microtitre plates at different concentrations, Neu5,9Ac2-GD3 exhibited approximately two-fold stronger receptor activity towards influenza C-virus than the 7-O-acetylated compound (Fig.  2) . In contrast to gangliosides with sialic acids mono-Oacetylated at the side-chain, Neu5,7,9Ac3-GD3 did not interact with the receptor in the HPTLC overlay assay Fig. 3) . Alkaline treatment of the gangliosides resulted in loss of receptor activity in the HPTLC overlay assay for all compounds. For the soluble sialic acid thioketosides (Fig. 4a ) that do not bind to the wells of the microtitre plates, a different test had to be developed in which binding of the virus to immobilized BSM was tested after preincubation of virus and soluble sialoside. In this assay, a significant inhibition of binding of influenza C-virus to BSM was found in the presence of Neu5,9Ac2-thioketoside, whereas the Neu5,7,8,9Ac4-thioketoside inhibited binding to a much lower extent, similar to the non-O-acetylated Neu5Ac-thioketoside (Fig. 4b) .",

The lectin from the marine crab Cancer antennarius has been used to detect Neu5,9Ac2-GD3 isolated from melanoma in a haemagglutination assay [42] , but its use for the visualization of Neu5,9Ac 2 in tissue sections has not been described. This lectin together with that from the snail Achatinafulica [43] has a binding preference for Neu5,9Ac2. However, both lectins can also bind to oligosaccharide structures without O-acetylation of sialic acids, which limits their suitability as specific tools for the analysis of O-acetylated sialic acids. An immunoglobulin isolated from human placenta has also been shown to recognize Neu5,9Ac2 and to a lesser extent also Neu5Ac and Neu4,5Aca [44, 45] . This interaction with Neu5,gAc2 was confirmed by NMR-spectroscopic studies (Siebert et al., unpublished) . It is not known whether these lectins or the immunoglobulin also recognize Neu5,7Ac2 or sialic acids with several O-acetyl groups in the glycerol side chain. Although a number o f monoclonal antibodies for Neu5,gAcz-GD3 have been described [19, 20, 46] , there is to our knowledge no antibody available for the general and specific detection o f Neu5,9Ac2 in glycoproteins.",

In the present study, the microtitre and HPTLC overlay assays described in this reference [29, 30] were slightly modified, especially in order to reduce background staining. It is further demonstrated that influenza Cvirus-binding is relatively independent of the molecule to which Neu5,9Ac2 is linked, since the virus binds well to synthetic sialosides such as Neu5,9Aez-thioketoside but not to the corresponding non-O-acetylated compound. A similar observation was also made with a polyacrylamide bearing Neu5,9Ac2 [47] described earlier. However, additional O-acetyl groups in the sialic acid side chain inhibit virus binding as revealed by the Neu5,7,8,9Ac4thioketoside and Neu5,7,9Ac3-GD3 from bovine buttermilk. Interestingly, the virus also binds to the mono-Oacetylated Neu5,7Acz-GD3 isolated from hamster melanoma, although at a lower degree when compared with the 9-O-acetyl isomer. One has to take into consideration that this binding may be due to the migration of some of the O-acetyl groups to C-9. However, O-acetylation of the original material exclusively in position 7 was shown by 1H-NMR spectroscopy [35] and the stability of this residue in dry state at room temperature confirmed by these authors. It can furthermore be assumed that this position was retained under the experimental conditions, since the overlay assay was carried out at pH 6.8 instead of 7.2 where the rate of migration of the O-acetyl group from the 7-to the 9-position is slow [28] . Since 8-0acetylated sialic acids have so far only been detected in trace amounts in sialic acid mixtures [2, 38] , possibly as intermediates during the migration of an acetyl group from 7 to 9 [28] , corresponding sialoglycoconjugates could not be analysed in the new test.",

It can be used more generally than antibodies made against highly specific structures, because the reactivity with the viral haemagglutinin is not significantly influenced by the nature of the molecule to which the O-acetylated sialic acid is bound. Furthermore, the test enables quantification as shown for e.g. O-acetylated gangliosides in the microtitre plate assay.

Instead, anti-viral antibodies were used to identify bound viruses. With this modified test the specific detection of 9-O-acetylated sialic acids was possible, since virus-binding was abolished not only after saponification but also by previous treatment with sialidase. Binding to higher O-acetylated sialic acids in this tissue can be excluded on the basis of the specificity studies made with corresponding isolated or synthesized sialic acid-containing substances. It would be conceivable that the haemagglutination-active, soluble HEF-glycoprotein isolated from influenza C-virus [50] may interact more easily with its Neu5,9Acz-ligand due to higher mobility and reduced size when compared with the whole virus. However, we failed to stain tissue slices with this glycoprotein and corresponding antibodies. This is in accordance with a report by Formanowsky and Meier-Ewert [51] using chicken erythrocytes, who did not observe binding or haemagglutination with this receptor. These difficulties were overcome by the binding of the esterase-haemagglutinin moiety of HEF to the Fc-portion of IgG. The corresponding chimeric molecule has been used for tissue staining of 9-O-acetyl sialic acids [9, 34] , although a detailed comparison of the value of this new reagent with influenza C-virus staining has not been reported. Staining with intact virus particles has the advantage of a relatively easy access to this virus and the handling of this test, particularly because it does not require DFP for esterase inhibition.",

The presence of Oacetylated sialic acids in colonic tissue sections prevents the binding of antibodies recognising sialylated structures and in particular the sialyl-Tn antigen [53] . Mild saponification reveals these sialylated epitopes in normal tissue where sialyl-Tn was previously thought to be absent. The loss of O-acetylation observed in colon cancer [15] [16] [17] [18] resulted in unhindered binding of antisialyl-Tn antibodies and led to the interpretation that this was an exclusively cancer-associated antigen in the colon. Whether this block in binding is due to mono-or higher O-acetylation of sialic acids has not been determined.",

In consequence, the reduction in sialic acid-Oacetylation observed by chemical means in diseased colon seems to affect mainly sialic acids carrying several O-acetyl groups in the side chain and not significantly the amount of the mono-O-acetylated species. These results agree with those of other authors [13, 15, 17] who also found no difference in the content of Neu5,9Ac2 in the case of colon carcinoma using other detection assays.",

It is tempting to speculate that the frequent occurrence of O-acetylated sialic acids on endothelia of blood vessels, which in the latter publication was also observed in other tissues, e.g. kidney glomerula, represents a mechanism to protect the endothelial cells against aggressive agents in the blood stream such as enzymes, antibodies, or white blood cells.
