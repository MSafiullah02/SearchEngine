            "text": "Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) is the etiological agent that causes infectious bronchitis (IB), which is an acute and highly contagious disease that affects chickens of all ages and leads to severe economic losses to the poultry industry, especially in terms of decrease in egg production, poor eggshell quality, reduced hatchability, increased feed conversion, and carcass condemnation at slaughter houses (Cavanagh, 2007), particularly when nephropathogenic strains or secondary infection is involved (Jackwood, 2012). Vaccines against IB are often used to reduce economic losses due to infection with field strains. However, the IB virus exists in a wide range of antigenically and genetically distinct types, and the continuous emergence of new genotypes, lineages, serotypes, and variants of IBV makes the prevention and control of this pathogen both complex and challenging.",

            "text": "Recently, a classification scheme based on the complete S1 sequence phylogenetic analysis categorized IBV strains into 36 lineages grouped in seven genotypes: GI-1\u223cGI-29, GII-1, GII-2, and GIII-1\u223cGVII-1 (Valastro et al., 2016; Chen et al., 2017; Jiang et al., 2017; Ma et al., 2019; Molenaar et al., 2020). GI-19 is the most widely distributed lineage worldwide. To date, the largest number of IBV strains in poultry producing countries originates from the GI-19 lineage (Valastro et al., 2016). The GI-19 strain, so-called QXIBV strain, was detected in China in 1996 when it was temporarily termed as glandular stomach-type IB strain due to the characteristic lesions in the glandular stomach of the infected chickens (Wang et al., 1998). Since then, several strains belonging to this lineage have been isolated and molecularly characterized from many cases of infection and designated as a new genotype, LX4 type; in China, these strains have been identified as nephropathogenic as they cause clinical nephritis and gross kidney lesions in infected specific-pathogen-free (SPF) chickens (Liu and Kong, 2004). According to a retrospective study, the first isolated GI-19 strain is the ck/CH/LHLJ/95I strain, which was isolated in 1995 from China (Zhao et al., 2017). However, a recently submitted sequence of an IBV strain 58HeN-93II (i.e., this strain was recently reported with accession number KC577395) shows that the lineage had originated in China in 1993. The GI-19 strain was shown to be the dominant IBV lineage in chicken flocks in China since it was detected (Liu and Kong, 2004; Zou et al., 2010; Han et al., 2011; Zhao et al., 2017; Xu et al., 2018; Fan et al., 2019).",

In Europe, the first detection of GI-19 can be traced back to Russia (Far East and the European part) in 2001 (Bochkov et al., 2006), although some reports believed that the first detection was in the Netherlands between 2003 and 2004 (Worthington et al., 2008; Irvine et al., 2010). GI-19 viruses were also detected in France (Worthington et al., 2008; de Wit et al., 2018) and Germany in 2004 (Worthington et al., 2008); in Italy (Beato et al., 2005), the Netherlands (Worthington et al., 2008), and Slovenia in 2005 (Krapez et al., 2010); in Belgium (Worthington et al., 2008) and Poland in 2006 (Domanska-Blicharz et al., 2006); in UK in 2007 (Gough et al., 2008; Irvine et al., 2010; Valastro et al., 2010); in Sweden and Denmark in 2009 (Abro et al., 2012); in Switzerland (Sigrist et al., 2012) and Finland in 2011 (Pohjola et al., 2014); and in Hungary in 2014 (Kiss et al., 2015). Genetically related viruses were also detected in Poland (de Wit et al., 2018; Legnardi et al., 2019), Spain, Portugal (de Wit et al., 2018), and Greece (Andreopoulou et al., 2019) in recent years. Since the first detection in Europe, the incidence of infection with GI-19 has increased in many European countries, and GI-19 has become the predominant genotype (Worthington et al., 2008; Krapez et al., 2011; Ovchinnikova et al., 2011; de Wit et al., 2018).",

Viral titers were expressed as an EID50. At least five eggs were used for each dilution, and the EID50 values were calculated using the method of Reed and Muench (1938). Blood samples were collected on 4, 8, 12, 16, and 20 days post-inoculation (dpi) from the remaining birds in the two groups and used for antibody detection (ELISA; IDEXX Corporation) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions.

A phylogenetic analysis using the complete genomes of 87 IBV strains was performed to investigate the genetic relationship with the sequence of isolate I0305/19 (Fig. 2\n). The isolate I0305/19 showed a close relationship with IBV GI-19 lineage strains, especially the strains LJS/111210 (94.0%) and SAIBK2 (92.9%). The complete genomic sequence-based MAFFT alignment of the isolate I0305/19 and those of the 4/91, H120 and 17 GI-19 linage strains selected based on the phylogenetic trees provided five fragments of I0305/19 that were changing identity with the reference strains 4/91 and LJS/120848 (Fig. 3\nA).

All birds showed clinical signs at 3 dpi (100% morbidity), although the signs were still very mild. Some birds began to die at 4 dpi, and the mortality was up to 80% (Fig. 4\nA). Gross lesions were detected in the kidneys of the dead birds, which showed swollen and pale kidneys with urate deposition in the organ and ureters (Supplemental Fig. 1). Mild catarrhal exudate in the nasal cavity were detected in two-thirds of the dead birds. The mild clinical signs lasted approximately 8 days. No clinical signs were found in the negative control group. No birds were positive for antibody against IBV at 4 dpi, and nearly half of the birds and all the birds were positive for antibody against IBV at 8 and 12 dpi onward, respectively. All the birds were negative for antibody against IBV in the negative control group.",

First, the viral titers were tested in 11 tissues, including tracheas, lungs, bursa of Fabricius, spleen, liver, kidneys, proventriculus, small intestines, large intestines, cecum, and cecal tonsils, by using 9-day-old SPF chickens, and the total amount of infectious viruses recovered from the entire organ were calculated. As shown in Fig. 4B, the log10 titers of infectious virus were below 2.0 only in the spleens and livers of the infected chickens. In contrast, the log10 titers of the challenge virus in the remaining nine organs were 3.0 or greater. No virus was recovered in the tissues of negative control chickens. Second, the 11 tissues of the dead chickens were subjected to IHC for detecting the presence of IBV antigen using a monoclonal antibody directed against the N protein. As shown in Fig. 5\n, the IBV antigen was positive in seven of the 11 selected tissues, including trachea, the secondary bronchus in the lung, bursa of Fabricius, spleen, kidneys, small intestines, large intestines, and cecal tonsils.

The results showed that the sequence of the S1 gene of the challenge I0305/19 virus had not changed in the kidneys and cecal tonsils of all the 10 infected chickens after replication of virus. However, there were five differences between the S1 nucleotide sequences of the challenge I0305/19 strain and the virus isolated from tissues of some infected chickens (Fig. 6\n). Of these five changes, one major nucleotide peak was found at position 278 in the S1 gene of the virus from the bursa of Fabricius and small and large intestines of two infected birds (the first and sixth birds), which resulted in a change of Phe93 to Ser93. Another major nucleotide peak was observed at position 353 in the virus from proventriculi and lungs of two infected birds (the fourth and eighth birds), which led to a change of Gly118 to Asp118. The sequences of the S1 gene had not changed in the remaining nine tissues of most of the infected chickens.

The GI-19 lineage is believed to be originated from China (Franzo et al., 2017), extensively spread to different regions of the country, and rapidly became the predominant IBV genotype in China since its first report (Wang et al., 1998; Liu and Kong, 2004; Zou et al., 2010; Han et al., 2011; Zhao et al., 2017; Xu et al., 2018; Fan et al., 2019), possibly because of the unavailability of antigenically matched vaccine that could likely prevent the occurrence of outbreaks. In the present study, we found multiple substitutions at the N terminal of the S1 subunit in the isolate I0305/19 compared to those of other GI-19 viruses.

GI-19 field strains showed different levels of virulence to SPF chickens in experimental infections. Some strains isolated in China were nonpathogenic to SPF chicken (Yan et al., 2017), while others showed low to high pathogenicity to SPF chickens, with morbidity ranging from 40% to 100% and mortality ranging between 10% and 80% (Table 1\n) (Liu and Kong, 2004; Zhong et al., 2016; Yan et al., 2017; Xu et al., 2018; Li et al., 2019; Ren et al., 2019a,2019b). The GI-19 virus strain isolated in Malaysia was also highly virulent to SPF chickens with 100% morbidity and 41.3% mortality (Khanh et al., 2018). Comparatively, GI-19 viruses isolated in South Korea, France, Slovakia, Greece, and Hungary induced only clinical signs in some or all the infected birds with 70% to 100% morbidity (Benyeda et al., 2009; Choi et al., 2009). The isolate I0305/19 caused relevant pathological alterations in commercial broilers that resulted in a high mortality of these birds in the field. The experimental infection of SPF chickens confirmed this results and suggested that the isolate I0305/19 was a highly pathogenic IBV strain that was more virulent than other GI-19 strains isolated thus far. However, these results should be taken with caution because birds with different ages and numbers, and challenge viruses with different doses and routes were used in different studies.",

Coincidently, no obvious gross lesions were observed and viral antigens were not detected by IHC in the proventriculi of chickens infected with the isolate I0305/19, although the isolate I0305/19 can replicate efficiently in the proventriculi by viral titration using 9-day-old SPF chicken eggs. In addition, only very mild respiratory signs were observed in both the commercial broilers and the SPF chickens infected with isolate I0305/19; however, other reports demonstrated that the GI-19 viruses could induce obvious respiratory signs (Liu and Kong et al., 2004; Benyeda et al., 2009; Choi et al., 2009; Zhong et al., 2016; Khanh et al., 2018; Xu et al., 2018; Li et al., 2019; Ren et al., 2019; Yan et al., 2019). The isolate I0305/19 can replicate efficiently in both the trachea and lungs in the infected SPF chickens, which was demonstrated by viral titration in SPF chicken eggs and viral antigen detection by IHC. A previous study also showed that some of the nephropathogenic IBV strains are less pathogenic for tracheal tissues (Fernando et al., 2013, 2017) despite the epithelium of the trachea being the initial and principal site of viral replication (Ignjatovi\u0107 and Sapats, 2000). Indeed, the isolate I0305/19 was a nephropathogenic strain, as shown by nephritis of the infected chickens, viral titration in kidneys using chicken eggs, and results of IHC of the kidneys. Pathogenicity of IBV strains for the oviduct of layers varies greatly. Several IBV GI-19 strains can replicate in the epithelial cells of the oviduct, thereby causing pathological changes (Crinion and Hofstad, 1972; Benyeda et al., 2009; de Wit et al., 2011; Khanh et al., 2018). In the present study, only four birds survived in the challenge test and two of them were layers. Both the layers showed no gross oviduct lesions at 30 dpi when compared with the control birds. Because of the small number of layers in the present study, it remains unclear whether the isolate I0305/19 can induce pathogenic changes in the oviducts. Further investigation using a defined group of female chickens is needed to confirm this observation. In addition, virus was also detected at high titration in the bursa of Fabricius, cecal tonsils, and gastrointestinal tissues, and at low titration in the spleen and liver at 4 dpi; the rapid replication and broader tissue tropism of the virus during the early stage of infection are important factors to consider that this isolate is highly pathogenic to chickens.",

Binding to host tissues is the first step in the viral life cycle of IBV and is therefore critical in determining tissue tropism and pathogenicity. Tissue tropism differs depending on the amino acid composition of the S1 protein (Casais et al., 2003; Promkuntod et al., 2014; Leyson et al., 2016; Parsons et al., 2019); therefore, S1 is considered to be responsible for host receptor binding (Wickramasinghe et al., 2011). It was demonstrated that the RBD of GI-19 virus binding to the trachea and kidney is dependent on a different sialylated glycan ligand compared to M41-RBD (Promkuntod et al., 2014); furthermore, three amino acids (KIP at positions 110\u2013112) have been identified in an GI-19 lineage strain CK/SWE/0658946/10 that enable binding to the kidney of infected chickens (Bouwman et al., 2020). Interestingly, we found that isolate I0305/19 and other GI-19 viruses isolated in China have the amino acid sequence MIA at positions 110 -112 in the S protein. It is unknown whether these amino acid changes affected the RBD of the S1 protein of these IBV isolates, in particular for interaction with alpha-2,3-sialic acid or other putative IBV receptors on the surface of the host cells. However, we found that Chinese GI-19 viruses with different tissue tropism and pathogenicity shared the same RBD-MIA. Thus, mutations in this region, even in the S1 protein, of these IBV isolates did not seem to be the only factor responsible for viral tissue tropism and pathogenicity. Coincidentally, a previous study also indicated that genetic alterations in the S1 gene of IBV strains could not change their tissue tropism and pathogenicity (Fernando et al., 2017). One of the potential parental viruses of the recombinant I0305/19, a 4/91-like strain, is a vaccine strain that attenuated the pathogenicity. Hence, it remains unknown whether or to what extent the swapped genes influenced the viral pathogenicity. More studies based on the reverse genetic techniques are needed to elucidate the mechanisms contributing to the altered tissue tropism and pathogenicity of the isolate I0305/19.",

This introduction could hamper the occurrence of disease outbreaks caused by other invading viruses; however, it could also facilitate the occurrence of infection by highly virulent strains that were not well matched with the established viruses. This may be the case for the introduction of the isolate I0305/19 in the diseased chicken flock; the isolate caused high mortality in the vaccinated chickens. The high poultry farm density and high chicken concentrations in a farm, as commonly observed in Chinese poultry, surely create favorable conditions for viral replication, maintenance, and circulation of such viral infection, thus resulting in the emergence of novel viruses and genesis of viral population. Therefore, in addition to the regular vaccination, improved management and biosecurity practices may help to reduce viral emergence and control the disease outbreaks. Presently, little information is available on the population dynamics of the isolate I0305/19-like viruses in China. Surveillance based on properly planned sampling in different regions may be needed for better understanding the epidemiology and evolution of the isolate.",

            "text": "Coronaviruses including IBV have been shown to exist in biological samples as a group of closely related subpopulations (quasi-species) that are generated through mutations and recombination events that occur when the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, which lacks proofreading capabilities, replicates the viral genome (McKinley et al., 2011). The genetic changes allow rapid adaption to the host by selection of more fit viral subpopulation(s); this, however, can possibly lead to changes in pathogenesis and emergence of new pathogens. In the present study, we sequenced the S1 gene from nine tissues of isolate I0305/19-infected chickens by the Sanger method, because it was reported that most genetic changes occur in the S1 gene during adaption and infection in the host (Cavanagh et al., 2005; Huang and Wang, 2007; Liu et al., 2007). We sequenced the RT-PCR products because that data represented all the possible genetic diversities within the population of viruses in a given tissue sample. Our data showed differences in S1 sequences between the challenge I0305/19 virus and the virus from tissues of some infected chickens; this was most likely due to the induction of mutations through replication of the genome. It needs to be further evaluated whether these mutations can lead to phenotypic changes in the virus by reverse genetic techniques and animal challenge tests. However, recognizing the presence of subpopulations in tissues of infected chickens is important for our understanding of how the virulent IBV strains can potentially replicate and evolve to cause disease; this information will also contribute to our further understanding of the replication and evolution of virus in the host and pathogenesis with regard to other coronaviruses such as the newly emerged SARS-CoV-2 (Ji et al., 2020).",
