Considering that the contagious disease has led to an enormous impact globally, there is an urgent need to identify the risk populations with poor prognosis. Aging is associated with certain changes in pulmonary physiology, pathology and function, during the period of lung infection. Therefore, the age-related differences in responsiveness and tolerance become obvious and lead to the worse clinical outcome in elderly individuals [3]. Previous studies mentioned that older COVID-19 patients are at an increased risk of death [4\u20137]. However, the ages related clinical characteristics, diseases courses and outcomes other than death in COVID-19 patients remain unclear.",

The age distribution for all patients was shown in figure 1a. 136 cases (61.5%) were under 60 years old (<60), and other cases were over 60 years old (\u226560). In total, 176 patients (79.6%) had fever, other common symptoms included cough (48.0%), sputum (25.8%), sore throat (8.6%), and diarrhea (5.4%), among which only sore throat showed a significant difference between two groups (11.8% versus 3.5%, p=0.034). The significant negative correlations between ages of patients and lymphocyte counts (r=\u22120.432, p<0.001) as well as albumin levels (r=\u22120.569, p<0.001) were observed in our study (fig. 1b and c). Compared with the young, patients over 60 presented with higher levels of blood urea nitrogen (5.83 versus 4.42, p<0.001), LDH (272.8 versus 249.0, p=0.004) and inflammatory indicators (fig. 1d, all p<0.01), more lobes involved (4.15 versus 3.34; p<0.001) in bilateral lesions (89.4% versus 74.3%, p=0.006) (fig. 1e) and higher proportion of bacteria co-infection (12.9% versus 4.4%, p=0.021). The severity of COVID-19 was milder in those under 60, showing lower proportion of severe and critical patients (fig. 1f). In turn, the utilisation of antibiotic therapy, intravenous corticosteroids, and assisted ventilation were more common in those over 60 (fig. 1g). Longer disease courses and higher proportion of cases with respiratory failure in patients over 60 were observed (fig. 1h). The median time of disease courses was significantly longer in patients over 60 years (24.0 versus 21.5 days, p=0.026) (fig. 1i). Interestingly, this difference was markedly significant in male patients (25.0 versus 21.0 days, p=0.036) but not in female patients (fig. 1i). Big difference of courses was observed in cases with respiratory failure in two ages groups, although it showed no statistical significance (38.0 versus 30.0 days, p=0.100) (fig. 1i).\n",

Sporadic studies mentioned that the elderly people may tend to die after infection [5, 7, 9], calling on the public to pay more attention to protecting the elder from the virus. In this study, we demonstrated that the clinical characteristics and outcomes of 221 COVID-19 patients were closely related to the different ages. This study provided clear evidence of relationship between disease severity and the age, which other studies did not refer to. Comprehensive analysis of these indicators provided physicians worldwide with important information for the disease perception, the condition assessment and the effective treatments for COVID-19.",

Besides, older patients showed more serious illness, leading to higher frequency of adjuvant therapies including corticosteroids and assisted ventilation in this group of patients. Contrastive analysis with recent reports [10, 11], older patients presented significantly lower level of lymphocyte than young patients. Lymphocytes are generally elevated in response to common viral infections, while abnormally decreased in SARS and COVID-19 [12\u201314]. Although the underlying mechanism is still unclear, the low level of lymphocyte could be a key indicator of disease severity in COVID-19. Furthermore, other serological indexes, such as albumin level, blood urea nitrogen, lactate dehydrogenase and inflammatory indicators also showed a progressive trend with age. The phenomenon is obvious, however, we cannot identify whether these indicators changed result in or result from the differences of the diseases severity with age.",

Age was one of the risk factors in disease severity and mortality of viral infections studies [5, 9], while the data about age in those studies are rough. Our study found that COVID-19 patients over 60 years had a higher rate of respiratory failure and needed prolonged treatment than those at age below 60 years, demonstrating that elderly COVID-19 patients were much more severe and showed poorer response to treatments than the younger. The cure rate of patients over 60 years old (89.4%) was relatively lower than that of patients under 60 years old (95.6%), especially in male and those with respiratory failure. Previous study had indicated that there might be a sex predisposition to COVID-19, with men more prone to be affected, but no evidence of an association between the severity of COVID-19 and the male sex [15]. More attention needs to be paid on these old patients with respiratory failure, and aggressive early intervention should be made to improve their prognosis. With more cases being examined from different ethnic and genetic backgrounds, the findings related to the age in this study may be approved by physicians worldwide.",
