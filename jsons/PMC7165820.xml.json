            "text": "Canine adenovirus type 1 (CAV\u20101) is the causal agent of infectious canine hepatitis (ICH). The disease is characterized by fever, often above 40\u00b0C, apathy, anorexia, abdominal pain or tenderness, vomiting and diarrhoea. Dogs may develop bronchopneumonia, conjunctivitis, photophobia and a transient corneal opacity, \u2018blue eye\u2019, which may occur after clinical recovery as result of anterior uveitis and corneal oedema (Appel, 1987a; Green, 1990). ICH is now uncommon in vaccinated populations. However, it is observed more frequently in unvaccinated populations, especially in puppies less than 1 year old. Clinical signs of uncomplicated CAV\u20101 infection usually lasts 5\u20137 days, with rapid recovery; however, they may last longer in dogs with concurrent infections, such as canine distemper virus (CDV) or, rarely, in animals that develop chronic active hepatitis (Green, 1990; Kobayashi et al., 1993). Although ICH occurs sporadically, the disease has been well controlled since the 1950s when attenuated viral vaccines became available (Appel, 1987a). Serological surveys conducted in various parts of the world prior to the widespread use of vaccines indicated that the seroprevalence of CAV\u20101 antibodies ranged from 30 to 60% in the dogs tested (Rubarth, 1947; Brunner et al., 1951; Cabasso, 1953; Sasaki et al., 1956).",

Madin\u2013Darby canine kidney (MDCK) and the A\u201072 dog cell lines were used for virus isolation attempts. Cells were propagated in Dulbecco minimal essential medium (D\u2010MEM) that contained 10% (v/v) foetal bovine serum. Swab and tissue samples were homogenized (10% w/v) in D\u2010MEM and centrifuged at 4000 g for 20 min at 4\u00b0C. The supernatant portion of each sample was then treated with antibiotics (5000 IU/ml penicillin, 2500 \u03bcg/ml streptomycin, 10 \u03bcg/ml amphotericin) for 30 min at 37\u00b0C, and inoculated onto partially confluent monolayers of A\u201072 and MDCK cells. The inoculated cell cultures were then incubated at 37\u00b0C in a 5% CO2 incubator and observed daily for cytopathic effects. If cytopathic effects were absent after 4 days of incubation, cell cultures were frozen and thawed three times and four additional passages were made. Inoculated A\u201072 cells were also examined at 2\u2010day intervals by indirect immunofluorescence tests using CCV monoclonal antibodies (generously supplied by Dr Gilles Chappuis, Merial, France) and a canine parvovirus (CPV\u20102) antiserum.

Endonuclease analysis of CAV DNA was carried out as previously reported (Buonavoglia et al., 1993). Briefly, DNA was extracted from MDCK cells with 80% cytopathic effects using phenol/chloroform and isoamyl alcohol mixture. The digestion was performed with HpaII and PstI endonucleases (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Milan, Italy). A typical reaction, containing 2\u20133 \u03bcl of DNA in a 25\u2010\u03bcl reaction, and 8\u201310 units of enzyme per microgram of DNA, was applied.

The prominent microscopic changes in the liver were hydropic degeneration of the hepatocytes, areas of centrolobular necrosis and the presence of occasional basophilic intranuclear inclusion bodies (Fig. 1).

The outbreak described in the present report provides evidence that CAV\u20101 is still circulating in the canine population and that serious health problems may result where CCV is endemic, management is poor and systematic vaccination is not carried out. The investigated kennels, an animal shelter, was very poorly managed with respect to record keeping and sanitation; moreover, vaccinations had not been methodically carried out. The above factors very likely contributed to the severity of the outbreak of CAV\u20101 in the kennels.

Dual infections by both CCV and CPV\u20102 have been reported previously (Appel et al., 1979; Yasoshima et al., 1983; Martin and Zeidner, 1992), and it has been shown that CCV enhances the severity of a sequential CPV\u20102 infection. Recently, a severe CCV infection was reported in three puppies that recovered from a CPV\u20102b infection (Pratelli et al., 1999b).
