The World Health Organization (WHO) and the World Bank are two dominant actors in health and development. Each espouses a different ideal of health as it relates to the process of development. The WHO defines health as a human right, and focuses on health outcomes as inputs to and the result of development. The World Bank's approach to development focuses largely on macro-economic growth as input to human capabilities. The World Bank became a leading actor in international health policy in the 1990s when it operationalized health as an outcome of financial and health care systems. This chapter looks at programming efforts by the WHO and the World Bank to foster development via investment in health or through macro-economic adjustment. Results are mixed. Efforts to improve primary care were successful in improving health outcomes of children under five, but made little impact on maternal mortality. Structural adjustment programs achieved moderate success with medium-to long-term economic growth but increased health inequities. These mixed achievements resulted in an effort by the United Nations to foster a multi-sectoral approach to development espoused in the Millennium Development Goals and Sustainable Development Goals.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "Health and development are central concerns for national and international governance because the preservation and improvement of health and the improvement of economies and capabilities that define development contribute to stability and prosperity of nation-states as well as to the regional and global communities of which they are a part. Investment in health and development is predicated upon the assumption that the constituents of the nation-state, that is its territory, people, culture and way of life, are to be maintained and preserved as they contribute to the bodies politic and economic. Competing priorities and strategies that address economic growth, state security, human security and population health suggest that the relative import of health or development, and the impact each has on the other, remains contentious and forms what can best be described as the 'chicken or the egg' debate: Is development a necessary precursor to improvements in human health, or is human health necessary to achieve development? The position an institution or nation-state takes in this debate will dictate its policy approach. The implications are clear. If one believes that development is a precursor to health, then one accepts that resources should be put into growing the economy, alleviating poverty, and building institutions and structures that further political stability from which human development will follow. If, on the other hand, one adheres to the latter ideal, then investment in improving the human condition would be at the forefront. Once a critical threshold in population health is achieved, then economic and other forms of development will follow.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "How one defines and understands health or development will have significant bearing on programmatic operations. The conceptualization of health varies across institutions, actors and time, but is broadly interpreted in one of three ways. One such understanding of health is that it has intrinsic or independent value. Health is an inalienable right of human beings. A second understanding of health defines its value based on it being a contributing factor to other goals, such as economic development or state security. Within this framework, population health directly impacts economic growth by producing healthy workers who perform effectively and efficiently without creating a financial drain on the health care system. A healthy population further contributes to economic well-being by creating opportunities for children to be educated. If children are likely to live into adulthood, parents are more likely to invest in education. The education in turn translates into increased future earning potential for the children, their households, and broader society because better educated populations can command higher salary and can attract greater investment. A healthy population contributes to state security because it is able to attend to its basic needs. If a population can work (assuming there are employment opportunities), then citizens can provide for basic needs such as housing, food, and other material goods and/or reductions in absolute poverty. Where famine, malnutrition, or gross inequalities in other health aspects of a population do not exist there may be less probability of social cleavage, discontent, political and social instability. Thus, internal threats to state security decrease. When states function rather than fail, there is regional and global stability and peace. A healthy population produces young men and women who are physically able to serve in the military, thereby contributing to military preparedness and strength.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Health and Development as Concepts in the International System"}, {"text": "A third notion of health views health as an outcome of physical, social and institutional factors.

The dominant understanding of health within an institution may shift over time as we will see in this chapter. Given the variability of goals within both the health and development communities, such change in definition and utility is not surprising. Neither the project of improving population health nor engaging in development is stagnant. As agendas are set and policies implemented, knowledge continues to grow through information gathering, program and policy assessment. Such assessment entails learning from what has and has not been successful. Both failures and achievements are utilized to craft new approaches to the continuing goal of betterment of society, options and capabilities.

At its most basic understanding, development means economic growth and poverty alleviation. Actors who used this definition focus policy on finances and economic growth. Health, thereby, may flow out of economic growth, the rationale being that increased national income translates into increased fiscal resources to invest in health inputs such as sanitation, improved food, health systems and so forth. However, a more holistic understanding of development sees human development as \"the process of enlarging people's choices, by expanding human functionings and capabilities.\" (UNDP 2000:17) . The publication of the first Human Development Report by the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) in 1990 was an international call to more broadly acknowledge the ideal of human development and human capacities. This more holistic interpretation suggests economic growth is only one foci and that other sectors such as education, health, and environment are equally important. Sustainability of these sectors, and indeed the ability to offer equal options to current and future generations, continues to be an important factor in sustainable human development.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 643, "end": 657, "text": "(UNDP 2000:17)", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Health and Development as Concepts in the International System"}, {"text": "At the macro-and meso-level of nation-states and global governance there are competing views as to whether economic growth or human well being is of higher priority.

Yersinia pestis, plague, presented one of the early challenges to international health. Plague is believed to have originated in Asia. It ravaged Asia, the Middle East, and Europe between the 1300s and 1844 and remains endemic to parts of Asia, Africa, Europe and the Americas even today. The worst recorded epidemic, the Black Death, peaked in Europe between 1347 and 1351 and killed between one quarter to one third of the population in Europe and the Middle East (Watts 1997) . The disease spread along trade routes over land and sea. In addition to being one of the earliest recorded pandemics, plague was also one of the earliest documented agents of biological warfare. In 1346, the Tartars laid siege to the city of Caffa. The Tartar community had suffered from the plague. They engaged in battle against the Genoese, who were secured in the walled city of Caffa. The Tartars reportedly catapulted plague-ridden bodies over the city walls hoping to disable their enemy with disease (Wheelis 2002) .

Isolation refers to physically separating people who develop a specific disease from contact with others. The city-states of Italy established Public Health Councils to address the health threat posed by plague (Gomez-Dantes 2001; Watts 1997) . The City of Venice instituted a formal quarantine system to control the plague epidemic. Under the quarantine law, incoming ships had to remain at anchor for forty days before they would be allowed to dock. Health regulations in Italy included sanitation (disposal of bodies), limiting movement of infected and exposed individuals, financing of medical care, and economic support for those impacted by market closure (Watts 1997) .

Quarantine and isolation were used against such diseases as cholera and yellow fever in the 1800s. The growth of interstate commerce and travel during the Industrial Revolution along with the coalescence of modern nation-states, contributed to a growing call for international coordination of health responses. The European cholera epidemic (1830-1847) led to the first International Sanitary Conference in 1851. Representatives from 11 European nations developed transnational quarantine policy (Stern and Markel 2004) .

Additionally, the OIHP had the authority to convene meetings, draw up international conventions, and administer quarantines (Gomez-Dantes 2001; Stern and Markel 2004) .

Social insurance was more than state-sponsored insurance, which had been gaining adherents at the turn of the century. State insurance provided for government-funded medical care of the poor and sick through municipal clinics, free hospitals and convalescent homes. Countries such as Germany, France and Russia were early innovators in such practice. Despite such efforts, however, care was fragmentary. State efforts were frequently small compared to private care provided by charitable or religious organizations or private fee-for-service care that precluded the poor. Social insurance, or social welfare, expanded the notion of state insurance to include other social aspects. It is a social safety net which includes income support, nutritional support, provision of housing and access to medical care for highly vulnerable populations such as the elderly (who no longer earn income), women, children and the poor whose physical or social circumstances prevent equal ability to access essential goods. Deficiencies in these goods make people more susceptible to death and disease; those highly vulnerable groups have fewer resources with which to mitigate harmful outcomes. In some cases, they are less able to respond to risks because of physical reasons. For example, women of childbearing age may be particularly vulnerable to physical conditions associated with childbearing, such as nutritional deficiencies, which can compromise their immune systems and make them susceptible to other diseases. These populations may be more vulnerable because of social or institutional structures as well. Consider the legal status of women in some areas following World War II where women were not allowed to enter the work force either because of formal rules or informal social norms. Those women who had engaged in work as part of the war effort were expected to return home at war's end. Their means of economic support was tied to spousal income or family wealth. In some regions, women were not allowed to own property. With no independent means of support, women were dependent upon the largess of men or upon social policies which would provide access to material support.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 325, "end": 341, "text": "(Gillespie 2002;", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 342, "end": 354, "text": "Kunitz 2007)", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "International Health Before WWII"}, {"text": "Progressives argued that societal obligations include the provision of social safety nets for these populations and for broader society.

Although full agreement as to the inclusion of social insurance within the health policy domain and purview of LNHO was never fully accepted, the debate about the appropriate catchment area for health had begun. The LNHO, the International Labor Organization (ILO) and a number of nation-states entered the fray. Support for social insurance was especially strong in a number of European states.

The UN has proven to be the pre-eminent institution for cohesive global governance despite the challenges it faces. The UN was founded as the successor to the League of Nations in 1945. At the time of its founding, the global community was recovering from two bloody conflicts and a global depression. The international community had to address rebuilding regional and global economic and social structures. In addition, the global community had to address its own complicity in creating the conditions which led to war. It would do this by creating a system with universal membership for nation-states to work together to ensure global security. Collective action would be used to mitigate social and economic conditions which could lead to regional or global conflict. Internationally accepted norms were created which included the primacy of sovereignty in domestic affairs, the responsibility of collective action, and the duty of nation-states to strive to protect peace. At the end of the Second World War, the global community engaged in institution building with the intent of creating global prosperity and limiting the potential for another global conflict. The foci of these endeavors included peace-building, conflict mitigation, economic growth, state and international security, and human prosperity. The global community faced the short-term challenge of rebuilding vast regions that were physically and economically devastated. Such reconstruction entailed addressing the immediate needs of people and states as well as the longer term needs for political, economic and social stability. Defeated nations could not be subject to punitive or solely extractive economic and social policy, nor could they be left to attempt redevelopment on their own without risking a recreation of the desperate conditions which led to the Second World War. Development and reconstruction required short term responses, emergency aid, as well as long term planning for global security which would be predicated upon state and human security.

Representatives of regional, national, and international health organizations were invited to participate, but the process itself was dominated by the United States and European powers as these nations had both experience in issues of international public health and had established health offices around the world. Because ratification by 26 states was necessary to establish a specialized agency within the UN system, the Interim Commission for the World Health Organization was careful to define the scope of the agency in a manner which would attract both socially liberal and more conservative signatories. Ratification by the U.S. was critical to ensure financial support of the WHO and make the agency viable immediately and into the future (Gillespie 2002) . The United States thus became one of the most influential powers in shaping policy, programs and actions. The WHO Constitution was adopted by 61 states on July 22, 1946 and entered into force on April 7, 1948.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1010, "end": 1026, "text": "(Gillespie 2002)", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 1777, "end": 1793, "text": "(Gillespie 2002)", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "The World Health Organization"}, {"text": "The writing of the WHO constitution was littered with controversy as to the scope of both the agency's power and the scope of understanding as to what makes for good health.

Rajchman and his adherents' reconceptualization of health to include the political economy challenged national sovereignty and market liberalism. Critics saw social insurance as an unwelcome tool of state intervention in markets in areas where free-market capitalism was embraced (Gillespie 2002) . The opponents of social insurance argued that it related to politics, the market, and labor more directly than to health. The question became whether or not the new international health agency should be given a charter which may permit clear authority in sectors not traditionally considered part of public health. The strongest opposition to including social insurance within the scope of the WHO came from the United States and Britain (Brunton 2004; Gillespie 2002; Kunitz 2007; Weindling 2004; Worboys 2004) . Given the political brinksmanship necessary to obtain the U.S. vote, the focus on social medicine and social insurance was attenuated (Gillespie 2002) . But the U.S. was not the only vote needed to ensure longevity of the WHO. Language that defined health as a confluence of the physical, social and mental spoke to a number of the European powers' concern for social medicine. Concessionary provisions in the articles of the constitution left room for reinterpreting the agency's focus and definition of 'health' in the ensuing decades. 1 The definition of health contained within the WHO charter represents both a challenge to medical imperialism rooted in a Western biomedical basis and as mandate for the WHO to work on a social agenda which included social constituents of health.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 400, "end": 416, "text": "(Gillespie 2002)", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 699, "end": 715, "text": "(Gillespie 2002)", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 1156, "end": 1170, "text": "(Brunton 2004;", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 1171, "end": 1186, "text": "Gillespie 2002;", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 1187, "end": 1199, "text": "Kunitz 2007;", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 1200, "end": 1215, "text": "Weindling 2004;", "ref_id": "BIBREF47"}, {"start": 1216, "end": 1229, "text": "Worboys 2004)", "ref_id": "BIBREF50"}, {"start": 1366, "end": 1382, "text": "(Gillespie 2002)", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 1770, "end": 1771, "text": "1", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "The World Health Organization"}, {"text": "Health is a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity.

It was also a period in which the inequities-in economic status and population health -between the 'haves' and the 'have nots' of the world became a focus for international political rhetoric. These concerns also came at a time when public dialogue reengaged with ideas of social determinant of health. A revolution in thought about how to improve health inequalities between the developed and developing world was called for, one which included social determinants and well as an understanding of historical context and power structures. Such concerns were reflected in the 1970s with a refocusing of health as a right and as a component of economic and social development. On September 12, 1978, attendees at the International Conference on Primary Health Care signed the Declaration of Alma Ata.

The logic of the program was manifold. First, immunization would increase the likelihood of childhood survival and was thus an investment in the future. Second, decreases in infant mortality are associated with declining total fertility and movement along the demographic transition. This in turn relates to lower dependency ratios and improved standard of living and improved human development within the broader population (WHO 2001 (WHO , 2009a .

The Bretton-Woods institutions are the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD or the World Bank) and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) which are distinct yet complementary organizations. The World Bank's mission was to rebuild the shattered infrastructure of Europe and Asia and provide technical and financial assistance to create the conditions of economic and political stability, growth in trade, and improvement in living standards. The IMF's role was to manage and promote international monetary cooperation and trade. Its initial focus was to provide short-term loans to nation-states for investment in capital expenses and structures deemed necessary for economic growth, and also provide countries with assistance in overcoming balance of trade problems. Such issues were initially viewed as being short-term necessities of economic growth. The role of the IMF evolved partially due to the Debt Crisis of the 1980s, the financial crises of the 1990s, and the global recession. Its role is no longer limited to monetary policy and short-term balance of payments issues. Rather, the IMF is engaged in macro-economic management of monetary and fiscal policy, longer term debt negotiation and restructuring, and global financial stability.

The IDA was created in 1960 to provide interest-free loans and technical assistance to only the poorest nations. In 1966, the ICSID was created as a forum to settle disputes arising between investors and national governments. MIGA is the most recent addition to the World Bank Group.

The achievements of the SAPs may best be measured by looking at long-term economic trends. Over the course of ten to twenty years, some countries which implemented these programs achieved economic growth and modest improvement in GDP/capita (see Table 2 .1). Living standards increased in conjunction with rising national income (Kunitz 2007 ). However, the question as to whether or not such growth was worth the price paid, especially by the poor, remains subject to debate. The SAPs have been widely criticized for causing social strife and failing to achieve their stated goals. The SAPs did not reduce the debt burden of the nations the programs were intended to help. In fact, by 1997, in numerous cases debt had grown (Gershman and Irwin 2000) . The programs removed the public safety nets for the poor and created 'health shocks' in which health indicators actually got worse, albeit for a brief period of time (Armada et al. 2001; Kim et al. 2000b; Oppong 2001; World Bank 2004) . The programs undermined investment in growth and in some cases, by undermining human development and removing the human benefits of a welfare state, set countries back in terms of development (Farmer and Bertrand 2000; Gershman and Irwin 2000) . The programs also resulted in unequal growth, rising inequality and exacerbated poverty (Armada et al. 2001; Farmer and Bertrand 2000; Oppong 2001; World Bank 2004) . Further, it is argued that the programs violated the international principle of sovereignty in that the national governments had little leeway in negotiating the SAP conditions. Critics argue that such conditions were set to further hegemonic interests of the United States and other large economic powers which control IMF and World Bank policy through an unequal voting structure (Armada et al. 2001) . Data source World Bank (2009b) The World Bank responded to the criticism as evidenced by the shift to targeted interventions for the poor which occurred in the 1990s. The bank continues to work with issues of macro-economic stability but its strategies evolved to incorporate lessons learned from the failures of the SAPs, and to provide supports for vulnerable populations. The more recent Poverty Reduction Strategy (PRS) places a premium on protecting social supports for the vulnerable, targeting programs to benefit the poor, and includes a participatory process in which national and community stake-holders are represented in policy debate and roll-out. PRS have been praised for allowing nation-states greater flexibility in agenda setting, allowing greater ownership of development policy, in safeguarding public safety nets, in protecting health outcomes (generally maternal and child health), and in providing for greater participation across political and geographic scales. At the same time, evidence suggests that participation in PRS process is varied and dependent upon existence of a strong civil society; although input may be sought from different sectors of society, decision-making is not jointly undertaken; the parameters of PRS are not flexible enough to manage external shocks such as the global economic contraction of the current debt crisis; continue to be heavily biased by donor preferences; and do not allow enough for context specific factors to alter policy prescriptions (Booth et al. 2006; Braathen 2006; Gottschalk 2005) .

In El Salvador, for instance, despite overall increases in public funding of health care, the funds which were allocated to the rural sectors decreased in part because the government, following a model of increased competition, contracted with NGOs to provide health care (Smith-Nonini 2000) . In African, Latin American and Asian nations, decreases in public spending and resultant low levels of salaries for health care professionals created a 'brain drain' with medical staff either concentrating in urban areas or relocating to other countries which offered higher wages (Oppong 2001; World Bank 2004) .

Increased user fees were shown to decrease health care utilization by the poor, to delay health seeking behavior such that treatment costs escalated and health impacts worsened because the disease progressed to a more severe state; people turned to traditional healers, informal consultants, non-Western medicine and/or self treated because of lower costs (Farmer and Bertrand 2000; Oppong 2001; Shaw and Ainsworth 1995; World Bank 2004) .

It would be difficult to get a single private enterprise to provide services, let alone allow for competition. 3 With the lack of private entrants in the high cost, high risk areas, provision falls to the public sector.

For many of them, security symbolized protection from the threat of disease, hunger, unemployment, crime, social conflict, political repression and environmental hazards.

State security is concerned with external threats to the borders, institutions, and governance of nation-states. It emphasized maintaining military defense, state territories and protecting national interests. But at its inception, the UN Charter promised freedom from fear and freedom from want; state security would provide freedom from fear but human security would speak to freedom from want. Human security spoke to security of individuals in their home, in their work, in living their lives. It spoke to the UN Charter's promise to harness economic and social progress as a means to foster human well-being and dignity from which peace would follow.
