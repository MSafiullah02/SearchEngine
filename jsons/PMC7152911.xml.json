They include microorganisms, such as fungi, protozoans, and bacteria, and molecular-scale infectious agents, including viruses and prions. Foodborne, waterborne, and airborne pathogens enter the body through various modes of infection and are responsible for over 15 million deaths annually worldwide (Dye, 2014). Some of the most common pathogens include viruses, such as norovirus and influenza virus, and bacteria, such as E. coli and S. aureus. Pathogens vary in many regards, such as virulence, contagiousness, mode of transmission, and infectious dose. For example, the world is currently facing a global pandemic associated with the COVID-19 virus, for which virulence and infectious dose data are still emerging. Techniques for sensitive and rapid detection of pathogens in complex matrices, such as body fluids and aerosols, and on surfaces are critical to the treatment of infectious diseases and controlling the spread of disease.",

            "text": "The techniques used to identify and quantify pathogens can be broadly distinguished as immunoassays or DNA-based assays. The use of immunoassays versus DNA-based assays depends on various factors, including the stage of an infection and the availability of antibodies and DNA sequence data, such as viral DNA, toxin-producing genes, as well as species- and strain-selective genes. Immunoassays are ubiquitous across medical diagnostics and food safety applications. Pathogens can be identified through the presence of generated antibodies in an organism, which may be present both during and after an infection (i.e., after the pathogen is no longer present). In such assays, both the biorecognition element and the target are antibodies. If antibodies are available for the pathogen (e.g., anti-E. coli O157:H7), one can also directly detect the pathogen using immunoassays. The ability to indirectly and directly detect pathogens via generated antibodies and pathogen epitopes, respectively, makes immunoassays flexible techniques for pathogen detection. In cases of limited antibody availability, need for highly sensitive results, or infections that do not generate a significant level of antibody production in the organism although the pathogen is present, DNA-based assays are commonly employed. DNA-based assays require the pathogen to be present in the sample or to have been recently present. In addition to detection of pathogens using antibodies or toxin-producing genes, pathogens can also be detected based on their expression of toxins. Thus, targets associated with pathogen detection include toxins, nucleic acids, viruses, cells, and oocysts. As a result, biorecognition elements widely vary, including antibodies, aptamers, and imprinted polymers. Several comprehensive reviews have been written on pathogen detection using high-throughput, well plate-based bioanalytical techniques (Alahi and Mukhopadhyay, 2017; Lazcka et al. 2007; Zourob et al. 2008), such as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) (Law et al. 2015) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (Klein, 2002; Malorny et al. 2003), which remain the gold standards for pathogen detection. Few reviews, however, have focused on emerging label-free biosensors for pathogen detection, which provide useful characteristics for applications in process monitoring (e.g., of biomanufacturing processes), environmental monitoring, and precision agriculture.",

While capable of being highly sensitive and robust, they are destructive testing methods and require the addition of reagents to the sample and extensive sample preparation steps, which increase the time-to-results (TTR). Bioanalytical techniques, such as PCR, may also encounter inhibition effects caused by background species in the sample (Justino et al. 2017; Scognamiglio et al. 2016; Sin et al. 2014), which introduce measurement bias and increase measurement uncertainty (Clark et al. 2016; Silverman et al. 2019). Considering such limitations of traditional plate-based bioanalytical techniques and the need for real-time continuous monitoring capabilities among various applications, there is a need to examine alternative bioanalytical techniques.",

            "text": "Over the past twenty-five years, biosensors have emerged to complement PCR and ELISA for pathogen detection. Biosensors are based on the direct integration of a selective biorecognition element and a sensitive transducer element and provide complementary platforms to PCR and ELISA for pathogen identification and quantification. According to the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC), a biosensor must contain a biorecognition element in direct spatial contact with a transduction element (Th\u00e9venot et al. 2001). In addition, a biosensor should provide quantitative or semi-quantitative analytical information and measurement without the requirement of additional processing steps or reagents. While a biosensor should also be a self-contained, integrated device, the measurement approach can vary from droplet formats to continuous flow formats that require associated fluid handling systems. Biosensors have achieved sensitive and selective real-time detection of pathogens in various environments without the need for sample preparation. For example, biosensors have enabled the detection of an abundance of pathogens in various matrices and environments, including foods, body fluids, and object surfaces. In addition to sample preparation-free protocols, biosensors are compatible with label-free protocols (Daniels and Pourmand, 2007; Rapp et al. 2010; Sang et al. 2016; Vestergaard et al. 2007). Labels, often referred to as reporters, are molecular species, such as organic dyes or quantum dots (Resch-Genger et al. 2008), that are attached to the target, either directly or through a biorecognition element, using a series of sample preparation steps or secondary binding steps to facilitate detection through the properties of the label. Thus, label-free biosensors avoid the use of a reporter species to detect the target species (Cooper, 2009; Syahir et al. 2015). Label-free assays often have fewer sample preparation steps due to the elimination of procedures associated with target labeling and lower cost than label-based assays, which are important considerations for applications in which preparation facilities or trained personnel are either limited or unavailable (Cooper, 2009; Syahir et al. 2015).",

Electrochemical biosensors for pathogen detection utilize conducting and semiconducting materials as the transducer, which is commonly referred to as an electrode. The chemical energy associated with binding between target pathogens and electrode-immobilized biorecognition elements is converted into electrical energy through an electrochemical method that involves the electrode and a pathogen-containing electrolyte solution. To date, electrochemical biosensors have enabled sample preparation-free detection of pathogens in various matrices, in situ detection of pathogens on surfaces, rapid pathogen detection using low-cost platforms, multiplexed detection of pathogens in practical matrices, and detection of pathogens via wireless actuation and data acquisition formats. As a result, electrochemical biosensors for pathogen detection have been widely examined for food and water safety, medical diagnostic, environmental monitoring, and bio-threat applications (Amiri et al. 2018; Duffy and Moore, 2017; Felix and Angnes, 2018; Furst and Francis, 2019; Mishra et al. 2018; Monz\u00f3 et al. 2015; Rastogi and Singh, 2019).",

To gain insight into the trajectory of the field, electrochemical biosensors for pathogen detection reported since 2005 are critically reviewed and classified with respect to IUPAC-recommended definitions and classifications (Th\u00e9venot et al. 2001). Applications of electrochemical biosensors for pathogen detection are critically reviewed with respect to the target pathogen, sample matrix, biosensor design, fabrication method, measurement format, and biosensor performance. We also discuss future directions of electrochemical biosensors for pathogen detection, which includes a discussion of present technological and methodological challenges and emerging application areas.",

Thick metal electrodes are commonly fabricated from bulk structures via cutting processes. Thin-film metal electrodes are often fabricated by deposition of metals on insulating substrates through traditional microfabrication approaches, including physical vapor deposition (Hierlemann et al. 2003) and screen printing (Taleat et al. 2014). Resultant conductive components are often embedded in insulating polymer or ceramic substrates, including Teflon, polyetherkeytone (PEK), and glass, to complete fabrication of the transducer element. While not yet applied to pathogen detection applications, three-dimensional (3D) printing processes, including inkjet printing (Bhat et al. 2018; Medina-S\u00e1nchez et al. 2014; Pavinatto et al. 2015), selective laser melting (Ambrosi et al. 2016; Loo et al. 2017), and microextrusion printing (Foo et al. 2018), have also been used for the fabrication of electrochemical sensors and electrodes using a variety of metals. As shown in Table 1\n, unstructured metal electrodes exhibit a range of detection limits. For example, the detection limits of electrochemical biosensors for bacteria that employ unstructured metal electrodes range from 1 to 104 CFU/mL (see Table 1).",

For example, free-standing film electrodes and polymer electrodes on flexible substrates, such as paper, are now being examined for biosensing applications (Xu et al. 2019). Given conjugated polymers and polymer composites are compatible with 3D printing processes (Kong et al. 2014), polymer electrodes are also emerging as attractive candidates for wearable conformal (i.e., form-fitting) biosensors. While polymer electrodes typically exhibit planar form factors, such as thin films, they can also be constructed as nanowires and nanofibers, as discussed in the following section. A comprehensive discussion of biosensor LOD and dynamic range for all electrode materials is provided in Table 1, Table 2\n.",

The use of complex masks and programmable tool paths with lithographic and 3D printing processes, respectively, also enable the fabrication of complex electrode geometries (Cesewski et al. 2018; Xu et al. 2017). In addition to complex form factor, lithographic processes, 3D printing processes, and assembly operations also enable the fabrication of electrode arrays through electrode patterning (Hintsche et al. 1994). Electrode arrays, including interdigitated microelectrodes and other patterned electrodes, have been developed in an attempt to enhance the sensitivity and multiplexing capability of biosensors. Interdigitated array microelectrodes (IDAMs) consist of alternating, parallel-electrode fingers organized in an interdigitated pattern. IDAMs have been shown to exhibit rapid response and high signal-to-noise ratio (Varshney and Li, 2009). As shown in Table 1, Au interdigitated microelectrode arrays are one of the most common electrode configurations for pathogen detection. For example, Dastider et al. usedinterdigitated Au microelectrode arrays for detection of S. typhimurium via EIS (see Fig. 4a) (Dastider et al. 2015). Ceramic electrodes, such as ITO, with interdigitated array designs have also been examined for the detection of S. typhimurium (Yang and Li, 2006). Mannoor et al. also examined interdigitated carbon-based electrodes for pathogen detection (Mannoor et al. 2012). The aforementioned emerging manufacturing processes are also used to construct electrode arrays that exhibit geometries other than interdigitated designs for electrochemical sensing applications. For example, Yang et al. used aerosol jet additive manufacturing to fabricate silver (Ag) microelectrode arrays (Yang et al. 2016a).",

Thus, electrodes ranging from micrometers to nanometers have been investigated for pathogen detection. While nanoscale planar electrodes are among the most commonly examined for pathogen detection (Hong et al. 2015; Peh and Li, 2013), the fabrication of nanoscale structures of conducting and semiconducting materials using a wide range of bottom-up and top-down nanomanufacturing processes, such as nanowires, has led to the investigation of nanostructured electrodes for pathogen detection (Patolsky and Lieber, 2005). Nanostructuring can be performed simultaneously with bottom-up electrode fabrication processes or as a post-processing step with top-down electrode fabrication processes.",

For example, electrochemical-colorimetric (EC-C) biosensing combines an electrochemical method and a colorimetric, fluorescent, or luminescent detection method. The electrode detects the presence of a target species, while the colorimetric transduction pathway enables quantification of the products associated with the reaction between the target and an active species (Hou et al. 2018). For example, Hou et al. used an EC-C approach based on a monoclonal antibody-functionalized AuNP-modified ITO electrode and dual-labeled magnetic beads for the detection of human enterovirus 71 (Hou et al. 2018). In that study, antibody- and horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-labeled magnetic nanobeads were introduced as a secondary binding step following exposure of the electrode to enterovirus-containing samples. Following the secondary binding step, the HRP-nanobead conjugates enabled colorimetric detection via monitoring of oxidative products produced by HRP-catalyzed redox reactions, while the functionalized electrode enabled electrochemical detection via chronoamperometry. Various techniques often rely on the use of optically-active labels for colorimetric, fluorescent, or luminescent sensing. The optical labels used in pathogen detection applications commonly include biological fluorophores, such as green fluorescent protein, non-protein organic fluorophores, such as fluorescein and rhodamine, and nanoparticles, such as quantum dots, including CdS, CdSe, and GaAs, among others (Mungroo and Neethirajan 2016; Pires et al. 2014).

Biosensors employing antibody-based biorecognition elements are commonly referred to as immunosensors. Given antibodies exhibit high selectivity and binding affinity for target species and can be generated for a wide range of infectious agents, antibodies are the gold-standard biorecognition element for pathogen detection. Antibodies contain recognition sites that selectively bind to antigens through a specific region of the antigen, referred to as an epitope (Patris et al. 2016). Antibodies can be labeled with fluorescent or enzymatic tags, which leads to the designation of the approach as label-based. While label-based approaches present measurement constraints associated with the use of additional reagents and processing steps (Cooper, 2009; Sang et al. 2016), antibody labeling may also alter the binding affinity to the antigen, which could affect the biosensor's selectivity. A detailed discussion of label-based biosensing approaches for pathogen detection has been reported elsewhere (Ahmed et al. 2014; Alahi and Mukhopadhyay, 2017; Bozal-Palabiyik et al. 2018; Leonard et al. 2003).

            "text": "While both monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies enable the selective detection of pathogens (Patris et al. 2016), they vary in terms of production method, selectivity, and binding affinity. Monoclonal antibodies are produced by hybridoma technology (Birch and Racher, 2006; James and Bell, 1987). Thus, monoclonal antibodies are highly selective and bind to a single epitope, making them less vulnerable to cross-reactivity. While monoclonal antibodies tend to have a higher degree of selectivity, they are more expensive and take longer to develop than polyclonal antibodies. Polyclonal antibodies are produced by separation of immunoglobulin proteins from the blood of an infected host (Birch and Racher, 2006). Polyclonal antibodies target different epitopes on a single antigen. While polyclonal antibodies exhibit increased variability between batches, they are relatively less expensive to produce than monoclonal antibodies and facilitate robust measurements in various settings (Byrne et al. 2009). Drawbacks to antibody use include high cost and stability challenges, such as the need for low-temperature storage. As shown in Table 1, Table 2, both monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies are used as biorecognition elements for pathogen detection. For assays involving secondary binding steps, monoclonal antibodies typically serve as the primary biorecognition element and are immobilized on the electrode, while polyclonal antibodies serve as the secondary biorecognition element and often facilitate target labeling. For assays that do not require secondary binding steps, polyclonal antibodies are also commonly used as immobilized biorecognition elements for pathogen detection. For example, Pandey et al. immobilized monoclonal anti-E. coli on a composite nanostructured electrode to detect E. coli across a wide dynamic range of 10 to 108 CFU/mL with a LOD of 3.8 CFU/mL (Pandey et al. 2017). Wu et al. used polyclonal anti-E. coli for detection of E. coli via amperometry that exhibited a LOD of 5 \u00d7 103 CFU/mL (Wu et al. 2016). Lin et al. used monoclonal antibodies for detection of avian influenza virus H5N1 in chicken swabs across a dynamic range of 2-\n1 to 24 hemagglutination units (HAU)/50 \u03bcL using EIS and the ferri/ferrocyanide (Fe(CN)6\n3\n-\n/4-) couple as a redox probe (Lin et al. 2015). Luka et al. detected Cryptosporidium parvum (C. parvum) with a LOD of 40 cells/mm2 via capacitive sensing and Fe(CN)6\n3\n-\n/4- (Luka et al. 2019).",

While ssDNA is commonly used as a biorecognition element for DNA-based assays, ssDNA aptamers are commonly used for pathogen detection using electrochemical biosensors. Aptamers are single-stranded oligonucleotides capable of binding various molecules with high affinity and selectivity (Lakhin et al. 2013; Reverdatto et al. 2015). Aptamers are isolated from a large random sequence pool through a selection process that utilizes systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment, also known as SELEX (Stoltenburg et al. 2007). Suitable binding sequences can be isolated from a large random oligonucleotide sequence pool and subsequently amplified for use. Thus, aptamers can exhibit high selectivity to target species (Stoltenburg et al. 2007). Aptamers can also be produced at a lower cost than alternative biorecognition elements, such as antibodies. Giamberardino et al. used SELEX to discover an aptamer for norovirus detection, which showed a million-fold higher binding affinity for the target than a random DNA strand that served as a negative control (Giamberardino et al. 2013). Iqbal et al. performed 10 rounds of SELEX to discover 14 aptamer clones with high affinities for C. parvum for detection in fruit samples (Iqbal et al. 2015). However, the use of aptamers as biorecognition elements has not yet replaced traditional biorecognition elements, such as antibodies, because of several challenges, such as aptamer stability, degradation, cross-reactivity, and reproducibility using alternative processing approaches (Lakhin et al. 2013).",

Thus, they have been examined as biorecognition elements for pathogen detection using electrochemical biosensors (Kutter and Sulakvelidze, 2004). Bacteriophages exhibit varying morphologies and are thus classified by selectivity and structure. A variety of bacteriophage-based electrochemical biosensors for pathogen detection can be found in Table 1. For example, Shabani et al. used E. coli-specific T4 bacteriophages for selective impedimetric detection studies (Shabani et al. 2008). Mejri et al. compared the use of bacteriophages to antibodies as biorecognition elements for E. coli detection (Mejri et al. 2010). In that study, they found that bacteriophages improved the water stability of the biosensor and increased the sensitivity by approximately a factor of four relative to the response obtained with antibodies based on EIS measurements (Mejri et al. 2010). In another study, Tolba et al. utilized immobilized bacteriophage-encoded peptidoglycan hydrolases on Au screen-printed electrodes for detection of L. innocua in pure milk with a LOD of 105 CFU/mL (Tolba et al. 2012). These results suggest that bacteriophages are potentially attractive biorecognition elements for water safety and environmental monitoring applications that require chronic monitoring of liquids.",

Similarly, Golabi et al. used imprinted poly(3-aminophenylboronic acid) films for detection of Staphylococcus epidermidis (S. epidermidis) (Golabi et al. 2017). Despite the absence of a highly selective molecular biorecognition element, CIPs and MIPs exhibit selectivity when exposed to samples that contain multiple analytes (i.e., non-target species) (Golabi et al. 2017; Jafari et al. 2019; Qi et al. 2013). MIPs and CIPs are also of interest with regard to opportunities in biosensor regeneration. Common adverse effects of regeneration on biosensors that employ molecular biorecognition elements, such as irreversible changes in structure, are less likely to affect MIPs and CIPs. However, it is generally accepted that current CIPs and MIPs exhibit lower selectivity to target species than antibodies and aptamers due to reduction of available chemical selectivity (Cheong et al. 2013; Kryscio and Peppas, 2012; Y\u00e1\u00f1ez-Sede\u00f1o et al. 2017).",

The binding affinity between a biorecognition element and target species, such as an antibody and antigen, is often reported in terms of a dissociation constant (K\nD), which has units of M. While the value of K\nD, solution = 1 nM provides a reasonable estimate for biosensor design considerations, such as understanding the mass transfer limitations associated with biosensor response (Squires et al. 2008), the binding affinity of antibodies can vary by orders of magnitude depending on the pathogen of interest and the clonality of the antibody. One important consideration when immobilizing biorecognition elements is potential effects of immobilization on binding affinity to the target. Traditionally, K\nD is obtained from a kinetic or thermodynamic analysis. Kinetic analyses measure association and dissociation rate constants (k\na and k\nd, respectively) and enable calculation of K\nD as k\nd/k\na. Thermodynamic analyses, such as calorimetric techniques, measure the binding enthalpy and entropy, which in turn provides the standard Gibbs free energy of the reaction (\u0394G\u00b0), and thus, K\nA = K\nD\n\u22121 though the expression K\nA = exp(-\u0394G\u00b0/RT), where R is the gas constant and T is the temperature.

Membranes, fibers, and channels have been used in size-selective sample filtration processes for biosensing applications. Biorecognition elements are commonly used to assist the separation process when the target species exhibits similar properties to background species or the matrix. For example, biorecognition elements that exhibit affinity to a broad group of pathogens, such as lectins, have been used in pre-concentration steps for pathogen detection (Zourob et al. 2008). Bacteria typically exhibit a net negative charge at physiological pH (7.4) because of an abundance of lipopolysaccharides or teichoic acids on the cell membrane (Gram-negative bacteria and Gram-positive bacteria, respectively) (Silhavy et al. 2010). This physical property of cell-based pathogens is leveraged in biofiltration processes, for example, using electropositive filters (Altintas et al. 2015). While the majority of the aforementioned separation processes involve manual handling steps, sample filtration processes are now being integrated with microfluidic-based biosensing platforms (Song et al. 2013). For example, Chand and Neethirajan incorporated an integrated sample filtration technique using silica microbeads for the detection of norovirus in spiked blood samples (Chand and Neethirajan 2017).",

The technique is commonly used in food safety applications. For example, Liebana et al. enriched S. typhimurium-spiked milk samples in Luria broth (LB) for 8 h to improve the assay LOD from 7.5 \u00d7 103 CFU/mL for the 50-min enriched sample to 0.108 CFU/mL (Liebana et al. 2009). Salam et al. enriched fresh chicken samples in enrichment buffer peptone for 18\u201324 h to recover injured S. typhimurium cells for detection via chronoamperometry (Salam and Tothill, 2009). While enrichment can be a useful sample preparation step when the target concentration is below the biosensor's LOD, it is inherently limited to viable and cultural organisms. Further, analysis of the results obtained from multiple samples should consider potential differences in the growth rate of bacteria across different samples. It is important to note that the need for sample enrichment significantly increases the TTR and impedes rapid and real-time detection.",

Target pre-concentration via magnetic bead-based separation processes typically involves the binding of antibody-functionalized magnetic beads to the target species. The bead-target complexes are subsequently separated from the solution by externally-applied magnetic fields. Magnetic-assisted separation processes are useful when the target species exhibits similar properties to other analytes or background species in the sample, such as those with similar size, density, or chemical properties (Chen et al. 2017). The bead-target complexes are then introduced directly to the biosensor to enable quantification of the target pathogen that was present in the initial sample. As shown in Table 2, magnetic bead-based separation processes have been extensively used for pathogen detection as well as general substrates for traditional immunoassays. Such assays have been used to detect a variety of pathogens, including bacteria, such as E. coli (Chan et al. 2013\n) and Bacillus anthracis (B. anthracis) (Pal and Alocilja, 2009), and viruses, such as bovine viral diarrhea virus (Luo et al. 2010) and human influenza A virus (Shen et al. 2012).

For example, the rationale that the bioanalytical characteristics of a droplet represent that of the bulk system is sound only in a well-mixed system, specifically, a system that exhibits a uniform spatial distribution of species (i.e., concentration profile). We note that while this is typically the case for samples acquired from closed, convective systems, such as body fluids, it should be challenged when considering open systems that exhibit complex flow profiles or regions of static fluid. For example, groundwater systems (e.g., aquifers), rivers, and lakes have been reported to have complex flow profiles (Ji, 2017; Zhang et al. 1996). Thus, the sampling approach should be considered when examining droplet formats for food and water safety applications. In addition to a consideration of system mixing, one should also consider the potential measurement pitfalls when analyzing samples that contain dilute levels of highly infectious pathogens, such as the potential for false-negative results.",

Flow formats include continuously-stirred systems (e.g., continuously-stirred tank bioreactors), flow cells, and microfluidics. Flow formats have the advantage of exposing the biosensor to target-containing samples in a controlled and repeatable fashion and the benefit of driving exposure of the functionalized biosensor to target species via convective mass transfer mechanisms. Flow formatsare also typically compatible with large sample volumes (liters). Flow cells are typically fabricated via milling and extrusion processes using materials such as Teflon or Plexiglas. They have the advantage of accommodating a variety of biosensor form factors, such as rigid three-dimensional biosensors. In addition to flow cells, flow formats are commonly achieved using microfluidic devices. While microfluidic devices are typically used with biosensors that exhibit thin two-dimensional form factors, such as planar electrodes, they offer various measurement advantages. Unlike flow cells, which are typically fabricated from machinable polymers, microfluidics are typically fabricated using polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) and polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) given their low cost and compatibility with microfabrication approaches. One advantage of microfluidic devices is their ability to perform integrated sample preparation steps, which eliminates the need for additional steps in the sample-to-result process (Sin et al. 2014). For example, microfluidic formats for pathogen detection using electrochemical biosensors have demonstrated fluid pumping, valving, and mixing of small sample volumes (Rivet et al. 2011). An example of a microfluidic format created by Dastider et al. for detection of S. typhimurium is shown in Fig. 4a (Dastider et al. 2015).",

The technique has the advantage of improved speed and sensitivity relative to traditional voltammetric techniques (Bard and Faulkner, 2000; Molina and Gonz\u00e1lez, 2016). In staircase voltammetry, the electrical potential is pulsed in a series of stair steps and the current is measured following each step change, which reduces the effect of capacitive charging on the current signal. Square wave voltammetry (SWV) is a type of staircase voltammetry that applies a symmetric square-wave pulse superimposed on a staircase potential waveform. The forward pulse of the waveform coincides with the staircase step. In differential pulse voltammetry (DPV), the electrical potential is scanned with a series of fixed amplitude pulses and superimposed on a changing base potential. The current is measured before the pulse application and again at the end of the pulse, which allows for the decay of the nonfaradaic current (Scott, 2016).",

EIS is a diverse electrochemical method, which can be done as a faradaic or non-faradaic process, and enables the study of intrinsic material properties, experiment-specific processes, or biorecognition events at the electrode surface. EIS is often performed using an applied low-amplitude sinusoidal electrical potential and a three-electrode configuration. Equivalent circuit models are commonly fit to experimental impedance and phase angle data to interpret the electrochemical process in terms of passive circuit elements, such as resistors and capacitors. For example, the electric double layer is typically modeled as a capacitive element, while the resistance to faradaic charge transfer at the electrode-electrolyte interface is represented as a resistor, often referred to as the charge transfer resistance. Additional circuit elements, such as constant-phase or Warburg elements, can also be included to represent other features of the electrochemical cell and process, such transport characteristics of the species at the electrode-electrolyte interface. The Randles model is a commonly used equivalent circuit for interpretation of biosensor EIS data. The circuit consists of an electrolyte resistance in series with a parallel combination of the double-layer capacitance with the charge transfer resistance and the Warburg impedance element (Randles, 1947). Variations of this model have been formulated for a variety of biosensing studies. For example, the equivalent circuit model and associated Nyquist plot for electrochemical detection of S. typhimurium using EIS with a poly(pyrrole-co-3-carboxyl-pyrrole) copolymer supported aptamer can be found in Fig. 5c (Sheikhzadeh et al. 2016).

Owing to its high reversibility, the Fe(CN)6\n3\n-\n/4- redox couple has been widely investigated as an electrochemical probe for biosensing applications and is regarded as a standard model for highly reversible electrochemical reactions (Daum and Enke, 1969). While useful electrochemical probes, redox reactions may also affect the electrode and immobilized biorecognition elements. For example, redox reactions associated with the Fe(CN)6\n3\n-\n/4- probe can cause etching of Au electrodes due to the presence of CN\u2212 ions when using the redox couple for EIS measurements (Vogt et al. 2016). This observation warrants further investigation, particularly in the context of establishing the effects on biosensor repeatability and reusability. The use of alternative redox probes or electrode materials may mitigate such effects. For example, ferrocene and ferrocenemethanol have also been used as redox probes for pathogen detection. Ruthenium(III)/ruthenium(II) (Schrattenecker et al. 2019) and immobilized quinone pairs (Piro et al. 2013) are also potentially useful alternatives.",

The double-layer capacitance is recognized to be sensitive to the structure of the electrode, the characteristics and concentration of analytes at the electrode surface and in the electrolyte, and the characteristics of the electrolyte (Lisdat and Sch\u00e4fer, 2008). As a capacitor, the double-layer is not only dependent on the dielectric material but also the thickness of the dielectric layer. Importantly, both characteristics could be affected by molecular binding events on an electrode. For example, when a target analyte binds to an immobilized biorecognition element, counter ions around the electrode surface are displaced, leading to a change in the capacitance (Berggren et al. 2001). The capacitance can be determined from the reactive component of the impedance or by fitting of an equivalent circuit model (Barsoukov and Macdonald, 2018).",

The measurement has the advantage of not requiring a reference electrode and can be used to detect both electroactive and electroinactive analytes (Jaffrezic-Renault and Dzyadevych, 2008; Narayan, 2016). Given the method can be performed using a two-electrode configuration, conductometric biosensors can be easily miniaturized.

Labels often include a biorecognition element-enzyme or -nanoparticle conjugate. In electrochemical biosensing applications, such labels often serve the purpose of altering the material properties or transport processes of the electrode-electrolyte interface, often by inducing a secondary reaction. Secondary binding of optically-active nanomaterials to captured targets can also enable the use of optical transducers for simultaneous detection or bioanalysis. Enzymes are among the most commonly used secondary binding species for label-based pathogen detection. As shown in Table 2, electrochemical biosensors for pathogen detection that employ enzymes are commonly performed as a sandwich assay format. A schematic of secondary binding steps for biosensor amplification based on the binding of HRP-antibody conjugates is shown in Fig. 6\na (Kokkinos et al. 2016). Hong et al. used HRP-labeled secondary antibodies to amplify the CV and EIS responses of a concanavalin A-functionalized nanostructured Au electrode to detect norovirus (Hong et al. 2015).

Xu et al. used glucose oxidase and monoclonal anti-S. typhimurium to functionalize magnetic bead labels for separation and detection of S. typhimurium on an Au IDAM using EIS and glucose to catalyze the reaction that exhibited a linear working range of 102 to 106 CFU/mL (Xu et al. 2016b).",

For example, malaria was reported to cause an estimated 435,000 deaths in 2017 (WHO, 2018b). Environmental pathogens are microorganisms that typically spend a substantial part of their lifecycle outside human hosts, but when introduced to humans through contact or inhalation cause disease with measurable frequency. Thus, environmental pathogens are often targets in medical diagnostics applications. However, here, we choose to distinguish environmental monitoring applications, which require pathogen detection in the environment (e.g., in air or on surfaces), from medical diagnostics applications, which require detection in body fluids. Thus, the distinction is based on the matrix in which the pathogen is present. Similar to food and water safety applications, which require biosensors capable of analyzing pathogen-containing complex matrices, such as a water or food matrix, environmental pathogens are present in multiple types of matrices. While environmental pathogens can enter the body through direct physical contact, they can also be transmitted through aerosols or interaction with organisms that serve as vectors for the infectious agent, such as mosquitos in the case of Plasmodium falciparum (the infectious agent associated with malaria). Thus, the detection of environmental pathogens often requires analysis of matrices, such as air, and objects, such as the surfaces of biomedical devices or objects within healthcare facilities, that are present in the human environment (Lai et al. 2009).",

However, they also require measurement formats for the detection of aerosolized pathogens. In addition to airborne transmission, environmental pathogens are transmitted by direct surface contact (similar to many foodborne pathogens), which is a significant mode of transmission in healthcare settings (e.g., of healthcare-acquired infections). Standardized guidelines for disinfecting and sterilizing the surfaces of medical equipment, assistive technologies, counters, and doors, among other surfaces, have emerged as an important aspect of infection control in modern healthcare facilities (Fraise et al. 2008). Thus, the detection of pathogens on the surfaces of biomedical devices and objects present in healthcare facilities is an important research area (Kramer et al. 2006; Weber et al. 2010). For example, bacterial contamination of inanimate surfaces and equipment has been examined as a source of intensive care unit-acquired infections, a global healthcare challenge, especially when caused by MDR pathogens (Russotto et al. 2015). Hospital-acquired infections are prevalent causes of morbidity in patients (Orsi et al. 2002). This problem has only been exasperated by the rise of MDR CD, as well as drug-resistant strains of Campylobacter, Enterococcus, Salmonella, S. aureus, and S. dysenteriae (Ventola, 2015). In addition to clinical pathogens, it is also of interest to detect pathogens in non-clinical settings (Faucher and Charette, 2015). Toxin-producing algae, such as cyanobacteria and sulphate-reducing bacteria, are also important targets for electrochemical biosensors associated with the prevention of water-based diseases.",

Diagnostic assays based on traditional bioanalytical techniques for detection of pathogens in body fluids are the gold standard and serve an essential role in healthcare by enabling the diagnosis and treatment of various diseases. Biosensors offer a complementary diagnostic platform that enable rapid and cost-effective measurements, high sensitivity, and the ability to make measurements in complex matrices that pose challenges to traditional bioanalytical techniques. Studies suggest that rapid diagnostic testing can potentially reduce the chance of hospitalization, duration of hospitalization and antimicrobial use, and mortality rates (Barenfanger et al. 2000; Beekmann et al. 2003; Dierkes et al. 2009; Rappo et al. 2016). For example, repeated rapid screening programs for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) detection is recommended as a means of increasing quality-adjusted life years of health for citizens in the United States (Paltiel et al. 2006). Additionally, the need for rapid antibody screening has been identified as an important aspect of mitigating the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.",

Wearable biomedical devices have emerged as promising tools for point-of-care (POC) diagnostics and health monitoring. The application constraints of wearable devices require them to be lightweight and simple to operate. Wearable devices can provide continuous monitoring of body fluids, such as blood and sweat, allowing patients to obtain real-time bioanalytical information without the inconvenience of facility-based screening. To date, biosensors have been incorporated into a variety of wearable devices, including contact lenses, clothing, bandages, rings, and tattoos (Bandodkar and Wang, 2014). This is a rapidly emerging area linked to smartphone technology for biosensor actuation and monitoring. The rise of flexible electronics has also contributed to the success of incorporating electrochemical biosensors into flexible textiles, which has enhanced their wearability (Rim et al. 2016). Although most wearable electrochemical biosensors are used to detect small molecules, such as lactate, glucose, or electrolytes, there is increasing interest in their application to pathogen detection. Challenges include biocompatibility (e.g., reduction of skin irritation), device power consumption, and biosensor-tissue mechanical and geometric matching. Because of the small sample size of body fluid secretions and the need to transport the sample to the electrode surface, microfluidic formats are now emerging for wearable bioanalytical systems (Singh et al. 2017a).",

Electrochemical biosensors for the detection of protozoa-based pathogens is an area requiring further attention. Protozoa, as large pathogens, achieve relatively less coverage of the electrode than small pathogens, thereby having a relatively smaller effect on charge transfer at the electrode-electrolyte interface. C. parvum is at present the most commonly detected protozoa using electrochemical biosensors (see Table 1) (Iqbal et al. 2015) (Luka et al. 2019).",

While various biosensors must be disposed of after a single use, the regeneration of biosensor surfaces using chemical approaches has been leveraged as an approach for creating multiple-use biosensors. Biosensor regeneration approaches typically involve chemically-mediated dissociation of the target from the immobilized biorecognition element or removal of the biorecognition element altogether. This can be accomplished through acid-base mediated regeneration, detergents, glycine, and urea as well as achieved by thermal regeneration, plasma cleaning, or even direct electrochemical desorption (Goode et al. 2015; Huang et al. 2010; Zelada-Guillen et al. 2010). For example, Dweik et al. used a combination of organic (acetone) and plasma cleaning protocols to regenerate an Au interdigitated microelectrode array after detection of E. coli to use devices five times each (Dweik et al. 2012). Johnson and Mutharasan used a liquid-phase hydrogen peroxide-mediated UV-photooxidation process for regeneration of biosensor surfaces as an alternative to aggressive chemical treatments, such as those based on the use of high- or low-pH solutions (Johnson and Mutharasan, 2013b). We note that an ideal biosensor regeneration (i.e., cleaning) approach for process monitoring applications would remove the captured target in situ using a chemical-free approach and preserve the biorecognition layer for subsequent measurements.",

Paper-based substrates have recently emerged as attractive alternatives to costlier ceramic substrates (Martinez et al. 2009). Paper-based substrates can also eliminate the need for supporting fluid handling components through capillary effects. For example, paper substrates can be patterned with hydrophobic and hydrophilic regions to direct fluid flow (Carrilho et al. 2009). Paper-based devices are also relatively environmentally friendly in terms of material sourcing, disposal, and degradation. However, the potential toxicity of materials that may have been deposited on paper substrates, such as nanomaterials, should still be considered when assessing the environmental impact of a disposable single-use biosensing platform. For example, the long-term environmental and health impacts of nanomaterials remain active areas of research (Colvin, 2003; Klaine et al. 2008; Lead et al. 2018). Although paper-based devices have historically been most commonly used with colorimetric sensing techniques, they have been increasingly investigated for electrochemical biosensing (Ahmed et al. 2016; Meredith et al. 2016).

Wireless biosensing platforms are also essential to the creation of implantable and integrated biosensors for pathogen detection, including those for medical diagnostics. For example, as previously referenced, Mannoor et al. fabricated a conformal biosensor for bacteria detection on tooth enamel based on a radiofrequency (RF) link approach (Mannoor et al. 2012) (see Fig. 7d). Wireless transduction approaches remains an emerging area for pathogen detection. An example of smartphone-enabled wireless signal processing for detection of E. coli can be found in Fig. 7e (Jiang et al. 2014).",

Biosensor transduction elements and biorecognition elements for electrochemical pathogen detection were reviewed. Bacteria remain the most commonly detected pathogens using electrochemical biosensors, though the detection of viruses and protozoa have been increasingly examined over the past five years. Electrochemical biosensors now exhibit LODs as low as a single plaque-forming unit (PFU)/mL and colony-forming unit (CFU)/mL and dynamic ranges that span multiple orders of magnitude. While planar Au electrodes remain the most commonly utilized working electrode, nanostructured electrodes derived from a variety of engineering materials, including polymers and composites, have been increasingly examined. Present challenges and future directions in the field were discussed, including a need for further low-cost, reusable, and wearable biosensors. Electrochemical biosensors offer great potential as resources for improving global healthcare, such as preventing the spread of highly contagious diseases.",
