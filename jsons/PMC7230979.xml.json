            "text": "The development of new point-of-care (POC) diagnostic technologies requires low-cost, fully integrated sensing platforms capable of providing quantitative results in situ. At the same time, POC diagnostic platforms have a tremendous potential that is yet to be fully exploited. Telemedicine, for instance, aims to monitor the health of patients remotely through on-site sensing using personal devices, holding a global market of ca. $20 billion USD (United States dollars) [1]. A trendy and increasingly demanded approach to in situ sensing is the use of lab-on-a-chip platforms enabled by cell phones to record, analyze, and transmit the results [2,3,4]. With the recent emergence of new pathogens, such as the Coronavirus and the Yaravirus, an on-site analysis will limit their health impact with a rapid sensing test, quantifying the severity of the infection, and assisting with the quarantine measures [5,6]. Periodic arrays of subwavelength structures fabricated in metal films enable surface plasmon resonance (SPR), which motivated their use as biosensors for several applications in different fields [7,8,9,10,11,12]. Ordered arrays of metallic nanoholes are optofludic structures that enable transport of both fluid and analyte via nanofluidic confinement and nanoplasmonic sensor. The plasmonic resonance signature obtained from nanohole arrays (NHAs) allows the detection of biologically relevant analytes in label-free fashion and real time. Toward the development of POC biosensing platforms, these optofluidic nanostructures are integrated into microfluidic environments in order to create fully integrated sensors compatible with portable electronics [13]. NHA-based sensors are ideal for field applications due to their small footprint and integration abilities as evidenced by recent demonstrations for the detection of bacteria, such as Chlamydia trachomatis [14], viruses, such as Ebola [15], cancer biomarkers [16] and uropathogenic bacteria [17]. Flow-through optofluidic structures also enable the enrichment of analytes in liquids by an electrohydrodynamic effect occurring around the NHAs when an electric potential and a pressure bias are applied to the fluid in a closed system [18]. Despite their demonstrated potential in sensing, most applications involving nanohole arrays focus on exploiting the conventional optical capacities of these nanostructures. The mechanical stability of the nanohole membranes is an overlooked aspect of their properties that are key when functioning as nanofluidic structures. In analogy to porous silicon-based membranes, where permeability increases significantly as membrane thickness decreases, the volumetric flow across nanostructured optofluidic sensors increases with the open pore fraction. However, plasmonic nanostructures with built-in thin membranes may suffer from low mechanical stability which could limit, critically, their use as optofluidic flow-through sensors [19,20,21]. The membrane\u2019s mechanical properties change due to the change in the structural morphology of the porous membrane as it deflects under pressure. The stability decreases by a correction factor (1 \u2212 P), where P is related to the porosity of the membrane [22].",

The mechanical properties of the organized nanohole arrays are not completely understood due to their sensitivity, brittleness, and nano-sized structures.

The general steps of the fabrication procedure are briefly described next. A mask with the microfluidic pattern was generated using SolidWorks CAD software (Dassault Systems Solidworks Corp., Waltham, MA, USA). The design included one inlet and one outlet of 1.5 mm, and a 5-mm-wide channel with 100 \u03bcm in height. A master was fabricated by spin-coating SU-8 100 photoresist (MicroChem Corp., Newton, MA, USA) on a clean three-inch silicon wafer (Silicon Quest International Inc., Santa Clara, CA, USA). The coated wafer was then prebaked for one minute at 65 \u00b0C and for 10 min at 95 \u00b0C. The mask with the channel pattern was then placed over the coated wafer and exposed to ultraviolet (UV) light for 90 s. Next, the exposed wafer was hard-baked at 65 \u00b0C for 1 min and at 95 \u00b0C for 10 min. The master was subsequently developed using a SU-8 developer (MicroChem Corp., Newton, MA, USA). A 12:1 mixture of Sylgard 184 elastomer to curing agent (Dow Corning, Midland, MI, USA) was mixed, degassed in a vacuum, and poured onto the master. After baking at 85 \u00b0C for 20 min, the replica was removed from the mold. Inlets and outlets were provided 1-mm punched holes for fluidic access. Microfluidic connections were achieved using polyether ether ketone (PEEK) tubing (Upchurch Scientific, Oak Harbor, WA, USA). A schematic representation of the set-up is shown in Figure 1.",

COMSOL Multiphysics (COMSOL, Stockholm, Sweden) was used to simulate a simplified model of the optofluidic sensor under a prescribed unidirectional and orthogonal pressure on one of the faces of the suspended membrane. The simulations were used firstly to estimate the order of magnitude of applied pressures that would result on the deflection of the substrate containing the optofluidic structures. This first model involved a stationary elastic model with default Lagrange\u2013quadratic element type. The finite element analysis solves for the displacement field at a specific point on the membrane for every input force. For the linear model, the system is governed by three tensor partial differential equations: \u2207\u00b7\u03c3+Fv=0, \u03b5=12[(\u2207u)T+\u2207u+(\u2207u)T\u2207u], and C=C(E,v), where \u03c3 is the Cauchy stress tensor, Fv is the body force per unit, u is the displacement vector, \u03b5 is the infinitesimal strain tensor, C is the fourth-order stiffness tensor, E is the Young\u2019s modulus, and v is the Poisson\u2019s ratio. A second static, nonlinear stress\u2013strain model was used to compare the experimental data and to validate the deflection values obtained for the prescribed pressure range. The nonlinear stress\u2013strain behavior was achieved by using a power-law nonlinear elastic material model, accounting for geometric nonlinearities, which is governed by Ludwik\u2019s law, \u03c4=\u03c40+k\u03b31/n, where \u03c4 is the shear stress, \u03b3 is the shear strain, and n is an integer [26,27]. A user-controlled mesh with Lagrange\u2013quadratic element type was used for this nonlinear model, to guarantee an acceptable mesh size along the thickness of the modeled substrate. The finite element analysis solves for the displacement field at a specific point on the membrane for every input force. In both models, linear and nonlinear, the parameters of Si3N4 were mainly used, as the values for the mechanical properties for this material supersede those of the metal components in the sensor, namely, a Young\u2019s modulus of 250\u00d7109 Pa, a density of 3.1\u00d7103 kg/m3, and a Poisson\u2019s ratio of 0.23. The surrounding surfaces around the membrane that correspond to the areas that define the thickness of the substrate were set as fixed boundaries. The transmembrane pressures were varied from 1 to 20 psi, as this range corresponds to flow rates on the order of nL/min, which are commonly used in biosensing applications. The deflection of the substrate and the stress (von Mises criterion) were recorded.",

Figure 3b shows an image of the CAD model used for the nonlinear simulations, a square 100-nm-thick membrane with side length of 500 \u03bcm and a 20 \u03bcm \u00d7 20 \u03bcm array of 230-nm-diameter holes with pitch-to-diameter ratio of 2. In both cases, linear and nonlinear models, the mesh curvature factor was 0.6, the maximum element scaling factor was 1.9, the resolution of narrow regions was 0.3, and the optimize quality feature was set to on. The linear model had a maximum element size at all boundaries of 30\u00d710\u22129. The resulting mesh had ~210\u00d7103 domain elements with ~40\u00d7103 boundary elements and ~1.4\u00d7103 edge elements. The nonlinear model had ~1.4\u00d7104 domain elements, ~900\u00d7103 boundary elements, and ~6\u00d7103 edge elements. The models were solved for pressures applied to the bottom surface of the substrate, for 1 psi, and then using the sweep parameter feature for a pressure range of 2\u201320 psi with 2-psi pressure increments.",

The trend from the linear simulation model was linear, as expected, with corresponding minimum and maximum deflections of 1.209 and 24.08 \u03bcm. In contrast, the deflection results from the nonlinear model decreased with the applied pressure, with minimum and maximum values of 2.584 and 19.39 \u03bcm. The same trend was found for experimental values, with the magnitude of the maximum deflection at the apex decreasing with the applied pressure. This can be explained by considering the physical restriction along the frame of the free-standing membrane and due to the mechanical properties of the material. The figure also shows the results from three analytical models that were used to obtain theoretical values, i.e., the Rijn et al. [22], Ugural [28], and Kovacs et al. [29] models, as well as an adjusted Kovacs model fit with the experimental values. These models are similar to each other, whereby they all consider the perforation in a membrane as an error factor affecting the Young\u2019s modulus of the membrane. The deflection of a membrane is given by Equation (1) [30].\n(1)wmax=k0L P0 LEeff h3,\nwhere w is the z-axis displacement, L and h are the size and the thickness of the membrane, and P0 is the applied pressure. The constant k0 is equal to 0.318, 0.325, and 0.319 within Rijn\u2019s, Ugural\u2019s, and Kovacs\u2019 models, respectively [30]. Eeff is the effective Young\u2019s modulus, calculated as Eeff=(1\u2212P)Eclosed, where Eclosed is the Young\u2019s modulus of unperforated membrane, and P is the correction factor. P is dependent on the perforation and is defined as the fraction of the open areas over the total area of the membrane. As the models are similar, there is negligible difference between the deflection values obtained using the three different models [30]. In the case of the optofluidic sensor, the deformable section of the membrane is smaller than the 500 \u03bcm by 500 \u03bcm of the free-standing substrate, as observed in Figure 5. The theoretical models do not consider the frame around the deformable area. Therefore, there is an offset between the deflection values obtained using the models and those obtained experimentally, as shown in Figure 6.",

            "text": "The experimental results have a similar trend compared to the theoretical models. Over the non-linear region (<7 psi), the experimental values are on average ~32% below the theoretical maximum, and ~12% below the theoretical maximum within the linear region (>7 psi). The slopes for the experimental and theoretical (Kovacs) values were 0.4831 and 0.4826 \u03bcm/psi, respectively within the linear region, with R2 (coefficient of determination (COD)) values of 0.937 and 0.993, respectively. The slopes indicate that the models do not quantify the actual deflection of the membrane. However, they accurately represent the trend of the membrane\u2019s deflection. As such, the unperforated area around the nanohole arrays is influential on the mechanical stability of the membrane. With the assumption that some length of area around the unperforated area does not deflect, then the deflection of the membrane can be rewritten as follows:(2)wmax,=k0Leff P0 LeffEeff h3,\nwhere Leff, is the effective length of the membrane based on the experimental values, calculated as Leff=Area of holes/Peff. Peff is the effective correction factor based on the experimental values, where it is assumed that some length around the unperforated area does not deflect. Eeff is adjusted to the experimental values and calculated as Eeff=(1\u2212Peff)Eclosed. The model found a range of Peff values based on each experimental deflection point from 2.138 \u00d7 10\u22123 to 5.09 \u00d7 10\u22124, corresponding to effective membrane lengths of 225 \u00b5m to 460 \u00b5m, respectively. Figure 6 illustrates that the model is incapable of fitting all the experimental values with one value of Peff. The initial deflection value of the experimental values has an Leff of 225 \u00b5m, where the Leff non-linearly increases until it plateaus to a constant value of 460 \u00b5m within the linear region of the experimental values. The effective length paints a clear image of the membrane\u2019s behavior under pressure. Initially, at low pressures, only the center area of the membrane deflects, while the majority of the membrane is not affected by the applied pressures. As the applied pressure increases, the deflected area grows until it reaches a maximum constant value (460 \u00b5m). Even at the maximum value of effective lengths, some outer areas of the membrane do not deflect, reassuring the limitations of deflection model. The experiment was not designed to bring the substrate to mechanical failure; however, the pressure value for the breaking point can be extrapolated from the theoretical model based on the material\u2019s properties. The inflection point of the membrane is not at the edges of the membrane but limited to the effective length of the membrane (i.e.,  Leff). Based on the Rijn et al. and Timoshenko et al. models, the maximum pressure applied can be found based on the total stress of the material as shown in Equation (3) [22,31].\n(3)\u03c3total=\u03c3tensile+\u03c3bend=0.2971\u2212v(1+1.4390.358 )P02 Leff2 Eeff(1\u2212v2) h23,\nwhere \u03c3total is the total stress of the membrane, and \u03c3tensile and \u03c3bend are the tensile stress due to stretching and the maximum bending stress near the middle of the membrane\u2019s deflection edges, respectively. The model is valid when the substrate is under a substantial load that results in large deflections (i.e., wmax/h\u226b1). Considering that the reported ultimate stress, \u03c3ultimate, is on the order of 109 Pa, and the intrinsic tensile stress is 108 Pa for a silicon nitride membrane, then the internal stresses can be neglected since they are an order of magnitude lower than the total stress [22]. For a nonductile inorganic material, the \u03c3ultimate is equivalent to its yield stress. Taking 2.5 GPa as \u03c3total, based on the mechanical properties of the material, a pressure of 33.91 psi and deflection of 23.87 \u03bcm are obtained, corresponding to the maximum possible values at the verge of mechanical failure [32]. This theoretical maximum deflection value at the verge of failure, which adequately follows the trend of the adjusted theoretical curve, is shown in Figure 6.",

            "text": "This work presented an investigation of the deflection and structural stability of optofluidic nanohole array-based sensors operating in flow-through mode. The study was approached using experiments, theoretical models, and FEA via computer simulations through FEM. Linear and nonlinear material models were simulated using COMSOL Multiphysics software. The simplified linear model had an expected discrepancy with experimental values, but these were useful to obtain an estimation of the order of magnitude of transmembrane pressures that would allow studying the deflection of the substrate when used in flow-through operation, while avoiding mechanical failure. The discrepancies were up to ~20%. In contrast, the nonlinear model, accounting for a complete nanohole array, accurately described the deflection values obtained experimentally. The stresses corresponding to these deflections can be used to predict maximum operation values that could prevent failure of the optofluidic nanostructures. Three analytical models were used to analyze the deformation of the sensor. The models depicted the behavior of the deflected substrate under pressure but did not intrinsically fit the experimental results since only a fraction of the surface deflects due to the attachment of the free-standing substrate to the silicon frame. Even when the entire 500-\u00b5m membrane is under pressure, only a reduced square area, ranging from 225 \u00b5m to a maximum of 460 \u00b5m per side, deflects. Once adjusted, the theoretical model better fit the experimental deflection values. Based on the models, the fracture point was extrapolated from the maximum yield stress of silicon nitride membranes. As the membranes are composed of nonductile, inorganic material, their yield stress is equivalent their ultimate stress, which resulted with a maximum possible deflection of 23.9 \u03bcm, with the applied pressure of 33.9 psi. Although the optofluidic structures are limited by their fragile mechanical stability in flow-through operation, these results show that they are capable of withstanding transmembrane pressures compatible with sensing applications, where the analyte is required to be brought into the apertures. Simulations that could predict the deflection of the structures would greatly benefit the design needs of flow-through optofluidic platforms for specific applications in the context of biosensing.",
