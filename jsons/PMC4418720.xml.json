Similar approaches will be useful in assessing the health of Australian flying-foxes in order to understand and meaningfully interpret population health in ecological and epidemiological contexts. Establishing hematologic and biochemical reference ranges for wild Australian flying-foxes may help to identify indicators of poor nutritional status, disease and the effect of environmental stressors.",

Each bat was immediately removed from the net, placed in a cotton bag and allowed to hang calmly prior to processing. Animals were anaesthetised (under veterinary supervision) using the inhalation agent Isoflurane and medical oxygen [20]. A basic physical examination was conducted, identifying any obvious lesions or abnormalities of the skin, bones, abdomen, thorax, mouth and nervous system. Age class was estimated by morphometric measurements of forearm length (mm), weight (g), and presence of secondary sexual characteristics [21]. Adult males were distinguished from sub-adult males on the basis of fully developed penis and testes. Adult females were distinguished from sub-adult females on the basis of worn, elongated nipples, indicating that they had suckled at least once in their lifetime. Juveniles (< 12 months old) were classified on their smaller size and rudimentary development of sexual characteristics. Sex and body condition (assessed primarily through palpation of the pectoral muscle mass and associated prominence of sternal carinum), were recorded for each bat. Pregnancy was determined by gentle abdominal palpation and lactation status by expression of milk from the teats. All bats were marked by painting hind limb claws with coloured acrylic lacquer to avoid short-term resampling. All blood samples were collected within 6 hours of capture. Two mL of blood was collected from the propatagial (cephalic) vein and dispensed into a 1.3 mL Lithium Heparin blood tube (Sarstedt 2269201) and a 0.5 ml EDTA tube (Microtainer 5974). Blood glucose concentration was measured at the time of bleeding using an ACCU-CHEK Performa glucometer (Roche Diagnostics GmbH). After anaesthesia, each bat was monitored until conscious, and haemostasis at the venepuncture site confirmed prior to being placed into a bag and allowed to recover for at least 30 minutes before release at the capture site.",

Therefore, the sample size for adult animals for reference range calculation varied for different parameters, ranging from 253\u2013293 animals (Table 1). A total of 385 total blood samples were submitted for haematology and 364 plasma samples submitted for plasma biochemistry.

Data that proved to be positively skewed with heterogeneous variance, were transformed using the natural log (ln). Each hematologic or biochemical variable were subjected to an unbalanced generalised linear model [24], under the normal or log normal distribution as appropriate for continuous variables and the binomial distribution and logit link for binary variables, using GenStat [25]. Adjusted means and standard errors were estimated for each variable (standardised for age + sex + month + body condition + pregnancy + lactation). The residual plots for most variables proved to be approximately normal. The quoted mean levels were directly back-transformed from the ln-scale, and reported as geometric means. Adjusted means and 95% confidence intervals are reported for each variable where groups showed significant differences. Post-hoc t-tests between means were conducted for specific contrasts of the mating male cohort, using the individual standard errors for each mean.",

Values from 9 animals with recent minor or healing injuries, including abrasions, lesions, abscesses, and in one case a missing eye, showed little or no deviation from either hematologic or biochemistry reference values. An adult female with a torn anal sphincter returned an elevated neutrophil count (8.9 x109/L), while all other variables were within the normal ranges. The most severe injury observed was in a sub-adult female, which had extensive abscessation extending 7 cm along the dorsum of her spine, including deep 3 cm pockets in the axilla and ventral neck region, likely resulting from a raptor attack. Chest X-rays revealed significant opacity over the left lung field, and thoracocentesis confirmed the presence of a serosanguinous effusion, suggesting lung abscessation. This animal showed decreased haemoglobin concentration (132 g/L), red cell count (7 x1012/L) and haematocrit (0.38), consistent with mild anaemia, while platelets (887 x109/L), white blood cells (19.5 x109/L), neutrophils (7.2 x109/L), lymphocytes (10.7 x109/L) and monocytes (1.6 x109/L) were all elevated.

The glucose measurements are considered to be putative fasting measurements as bleeding routinely occurred at least 2 hours post capture.

Whilst elevated AST can be an indicator of capture myopathy [14] a concomitant elevation in creatine kinase (CK) is also expected in such situations and was not seen in this study. The magnitude of difference between age cohort levels of AST was relatively modest, wherein situations of tissue insult, this enzyme would be expected to elevate several-fold, and hence it is most likely that the higher AST and ALT values in the juvenile cohort were representative of physiologic status and altered enzyme activity related to growth.",

The lower leukocyte counts observed in adult flying-foxes is not unexpected given the mature status of their immune system. Higher absolute lymphocyte numbers observed in juveniles are a common finding in mammals of many species [31]. Absolute lymphocytosis can occasionally be significant in young animals due to excitement or immune stimulation which would be a natural response to the capture process [23], and are also reflective that the young animal is still adapting immune responses to its environment.

Although sex differences in red cell counts are common in animals, with males usually having higher values [14], we found no significant differences between sexes, apart from lower values in mating males which may indicate the high demand of mating. Total protein, albumin and globulin levels for lactating females tended to be low-normal, consistent with the expected higher physiological demand during reproductive life cycles. Higher albumin levels, often reported in lactating females as a function of hydration status [14] were not observed in the study. Lower levels of glucose were reported for males which also had high normal levels of both creatinine and urea during peak mating, possibly associated with dehydration or catabolism of muscle protein [14]. Females also had high normal levels of urea during pregnancy and lactation, also likely to be associated with these physiologically demanding life cycles.",

Conversely cholesterol levels were found to decrease with improving body condition. This raises questions on the importance of lipid metabolism in flying-foxes that consume a predominantly low fat diet. Decreased levels of total protein, albumin and globulin levels were reported for animals in poor condition which is consistent with other studies of Pteropus species [24, 39] and may be due to a lower proteinaceous plane of nutrition. The erythrocyte panel demonstrated significant increases with improving body condition, consistent with previously reported findings that haemoglobin and red cell count are positively associated with general body condition and survival [13].",

While sample collection occurred at a single roost in southeast Queensland, observational, telemetry and genetic studies demonstrate the connectivity of P. alecto across their mainland Australian range, and thus the relevance of our findings to the species as a whole. Temporal analyses of changes in hematologic and biochemical parameters are necessary to investigate if there are seasonal changes or environmental stressor effects. Further investigations into correlation of parameters and disease prevalence may be important in establishing the parameters for monitoring disease and risk of disease in P. alecto populations.",
