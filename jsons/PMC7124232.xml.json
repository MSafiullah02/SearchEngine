The following recommendations will assist in reducing and controlling the level of contamination:1.Avoid confining the herd as much as possible during the winter feeding period. Rotate feeding and bedding areas so that cows and heifers are not forced to remain in a contaminated environment. This will help to reduce the number of infected \u201ccarrier\u201d cows, which shed enteropathogens in their manure. Udders and underbellies will also be less contaminated, thus reducing the risk that cows and heifers will be a primary source of contamination when they are moved into the calving area.2.Do not calve cows and heifers in the same location in which they were held during the winter months.3.Move cows and heifers into the calving area one to two weeks prior to the onset of calving. This will prevent the excessive accumulation of manure and contaminated bedding in the calving area.4.Do not allow cows and heifers to become \u201coverconfined\u201d during calving. The herd, particularly the heifers, must be observed during calving. However, they should not be restricted to small areas, particularly muddy corrals or small paddocks. Even animals calved on large areas can become confined by excessive snow or by restricting the placement of feed or bedding to the same area.5.Allow animals plenty of space at calving. If the ground surface is muddy or wet, allow more square feet per cow-calf pair. If the calving herd cannot be turned out because of excessive snow, plow, or bulldozed strips on sidehills and hilltops so they have room to disperse. This technique was used successfully to control outbreaks in several herds when record high snowfalls occurred in western Canada in 1974. Change the location of feeding and bedding grounds every few days to encourage the herd to migrate within the calving area.6.Do not calve in the same location year after year, particularly if diarrhea has been a problem in that area previously. Attempt to rotate calving grounds from year to year.7.Locate calving grounds to take advantage of natural shelter and where the type of soil and the contour of the land allow natural drainage away of surface water.8.Calving areas should be cleaned up and left vacant through the hot, dry summer months. All manure and excess bedding should be removed so fresh, underlying soil is exposed.\n",

If movement away from a contaminated calving area is not possible, provide as much clean, dry bedding as possible and attempt to disperse animals by spreading out bedding and loafing areas.

A shelter and handling facility may be included for difficult calvings. Nursery pastures each contain two calf shelters (calf-huts) with windbreak fence at each end. The calf-huts at Lacombe are 24 ft long, 10 ft deep, and 8 ft high in front and are easily movable on skids. They are used primarily as creep areas and are bedded for use of calves only. Calves may spend several hours each day sleeping in them.2.The calf-huts are moved as necessary when the build-up of manure becomes excessive.3.The water supply to the calving and nursing areas is provided by a winter water line and tank with an electric heater. If necessary, water troughs may be kept open by using propane or coal heaters, or water may be hauled by truck for short periods.4.It is preferable to have an extra area (corral, bam) for chronically sick animals, weak calves that are sure to be a problem, and cows with no milk.5.Move pregnant cows to the calving area approximately two weeks before calving. The bedding should be as clean and dry as possible, especially when calving starts.6.Within one day after calving, when the bond between the dam and calf is established, move the cow and calf to one of the nursing areas. Do not leave the dam and the calf in the calving area for more than 24 hours unless necessary.7.Fill the nursing areas to a maximum density of 35 to 40 cows and their calves for each 10- to 12-acre area. Then start in a new nursing area.8.Do not leave cow and calf in smaller nursing pastures longer than four weeks. If weather permits, move each group out into larger summer pastures when the youngest is three weeks old. Otherwise, problems with parasites and coccidiosis may occur.9.In small herds it may be possible to calve in a corral, but it is not recommended. Again, cows and calves should be dispersed as soon as possible.10.For herds larger than 150 cows the system can be duplicated. Alternatively, older cows may be allowed to calve on the range and heifers and other cows of particular concern (exotics, purebreds, known problem-calvers) managed as described.11.Clean and harrow pastures thoroughly two or three times after use, and leave vacant until grass is reestablished. Graze over summer as required, harrow again in fall, and leave vacant for as long as possible over winter.\n",

As a general rule, provide as much space per cow as possible. The Lacombe system was originally designed so that 70 cows would calve in 16-acre pastures; however, the entire area was not always available to the cows because of heavy snowfall. Following calving, 35 cow-calf pairs were dispersed onto 12-acre nursing areas. At the University of Saskatchewan Termeunde farm near Lanigan, Saskatchewan, use of a similar system successfully minimized scours when cows were allowed 1000 sq ft (50 cows in 50,000 sq ft), but not when allowed 250 sq ft (50 cows in 12,500 sq ft) in the calving area.

Cows that are close to calving will not be claiming another cow\u2019s calf. In large herds this will help to minimize the problem of mismothering, particularly in first-calf heifers.3.There is a more relaxed environment for the calf, less movement in the herd, and less likelihood of being trampled.4.Calves of approximately the same age are grouped together, thereby facilitating movement to large pastures according to age, and scheduling for branding and castration.5.The herd is already divided if an outbreak of diarrhea develops.\n",

In order to break the cycle of infection, it may be necessary for livestockmen to take special precautions to avoid contaminating their hands, clothing, and boots. In some cases it may be beneficial to wear disposable rubber gloves and clean coveralls if it is necessary to handle newborn calves when moving them from the calving grounds to holding areas or postcalving areas.

            "text": "The amount of colostrum ingested by the calf in the first six hours is dependent upon three factors:1.\nThe amount of colostrum available from the dam. The amount of colostrum available will depend on the maturity of the cow and adequacy of the nutrition throughout the winter. Based on a survey on one Hereford ranch, 50 per cent of the two-year-old heifers had only 500 ml or less of colostrum immediately after calving, 75 per cent had only 750 ml or less, and only 6 per cent had between 1000 and 2000 ml. This suggests that under some conditions heifers may not have sufficient colostrum. This shortage of colostrum is due to a combination of inheritance, lack of maturity, and inadequate nutrition.Calves that are born weak and cannot or do not want to suck should be offered one to two pints of warm colostrum by nipple bottle or should be force-fed the colostrum with a stomach tube. There is more than adequate absorption of immunoglobulins when colostrum is given by tube within minutes after birth.12\n2.\nThe maternal behavior of the dam and whether or not she lets the calf suck. Mismothering occurs commonly in two-year-old heifers (they make no effort to establish a dam-calf relationship), and they abandon their calves or do not allow them to suck. Some of these heifers can be encouraged to accept their calves. The heifer is restrained in a head gate and her hindlimbs are hobbled so that she cannot kick. The calf is held up to the teats and encouraged to suck. Confinement of the heifer with the calf in a small pen for a few days will often result in acceptance of the calf.When the dam-calf relationship has been established (when the calf is sucking and is encouraged by the mother to suck), the cow and calf should be moved out of the main calving area to a nursery area or pasture. This will prevent overcrowding, which is a common predisposing cause of calf diarrhea.3.\nThe vigor of the calf and its ability to suck the cow. The vigor of the calf and its desire and ability to stand, \u201cseek the teat,\u201d and suck the necessary amount of colostrum will depend on the health of the calf and the environment. Newborn calves may be weak at birth because of congenital defects and infection or because of a difficult and prolonged birth. The cause of the \u201cweak calf syndrome\u201d is still uncertain, but in utero infection of the fetus late in gestation is a possibility. Prolonged difficult dystocia may cause intrapartum hypoxia, edema of the soft tissue of the head including the tongue, and inability of the calf to suck early enough. All of these calves must be given colostrum as soon as possible either by nipple bottle or force-feeding with a stomach tube. Calves that are born in deep snow or are exposed to very cold and windy weather may become hypothermic, weak, and unable to stand or suck within one hour. These calves must be detected early and fed adequate quantities of colostrum and placed in a dry, weather-protected area until they have regained their strength.\n",

In a survey of ten cows from each of 20 herds, 146 cows (73 per cent) and 19 of 20 (95 per cent) herds were positive for rotavirus antibody.11 Therefore, over 70 per cent of beef cows appear to have colostral levels of rotavirus antibody high enough to prevent diarrhea during the first five to seven days of life. However, colostral antibody levels decline rapidly after calving and many calves probably become susceptible to rotavirus diarrhea by one week of age because antibody levels in the milk reaching the lumen of the small intestine are not high enough to prevent infection and multiplication of the virus. Also, because of this decline in antibody levels, outbreaks of rotavirus diarrhea can occur year after year in spite of the presence of colostral antibody in most of the cows at calving.2., 16. When herd immunity is low, outbreaks of rotavirus diarrhea can occur in younger calves, but this appears to be the exception rather than the rule. Sporadic cases will also occur in younger calves if they do not ingest colostrum, or when the volume of colostrum ingested is low, as in heifers. Serum antibody to rotavirus does not prevent diarrhea.16 A similar situation applies for the coronavirus.",

By vaccinating the dam, the intent is to delay the normal rapid decline in colostral antibody levels so that antibody persists in the milk for longer than normal. However, sufficient evidence is not yet available to allow a critical evaluation of the vaccine when administered to the dam. Alternatively, the same vaccine, previously marketed as Scourvax II, can be administered orally to newborn calves at birth. To be effective, the manufacturer recommends that all newborn calves in the herd be vaccinated. This procedure is supposed to reduce environmental contamination resulting from passage of the viruses through clinically normal calves. In nursing calves, there is a danger that the vaccine virus will be neutralized in the intestine by colostral antibody, thereby making it ineffective. Because of this problem, it could be counterproductive to administer the vaccine to both the dam and the calf. Initiation of oral calf vaccination in the face of an outbreak may not be effective.",

Such strains have not yet been identified. There is also increasing evidence that there are different strains of bovine rotavirus that could be immunologically distinct. If so, a viral vaccine prepared from one strain of virus might not protect against all other strains of the virus that occur in the field. Also, in herds in which animals are crowded within the calving area or where the level of environmental contamination is high, the protective level of colostrum may be overwhelmed by infection pressure.

Is there sufficient area per calving animal; is the ground surface well drained; is there adequate protection from cold winds, and is it easy to move animals from one place to another?4.What is the nutritional status of the pregnant animals? Will they have a sufficient amount of colostrum? A major factor in the efficacy of the vaccine is the amount of colostrum ingested by the calf.5.What is the level of management? Vaccination is not a replacement for inadequate management. The recommendation to use any of the available vaccines for the control of diarrhea in calves in herds that are poorly managed may give the owner a false sense of hope; the results may be poor and the reputation of the vaccine is unjustifiably questioned.\n",

The ability of newborn animals to adapt to changes in the environment is limited, and conditions that appear to have no effect on mature animals may be detrimental to the newborn calf. It has been recognized for many years that stress is a contributing factor in many individual cases and in outbreaks of calf diarrhea. However, because many different environmental conditions can cause stress and because stress is difficult to measure, it has not been possible to identify all of the factors that contribute to the problem. Also, some conditions such as \u201covercrowding\u201d which cause psychological and physical stress also lead to increased levels of contamination and exposure to infectious agents. The results of the epidemiologic survey of beef cattle ranches in Alberta and Saskatchewan have helped to identify some of the factors that contribute to stress.1.\nInclement weather: Many outbreaks occurred within 48 hours following snow storms when the weather was classified as cold and changeable. Later in the spring, rain will also precipitate epidemics.2.\nPoor ground surface conditions: Ground surface conditions preceding outbreaks were classified as \u201cwet\u201d by 81 per cent of ranchers. Excess surface water and cold, wet bedding make it difficult for calves to find a comfortable place to sleep and leads to the build-up and spread of contamination. Locate calving areas to take advantage of natural drainage away of surface water. Use clean, dry straw for bedding. Increase the amount and depth of bedding as ground surface conditions become wet or muddy.3.\nCrowding: Crowding can cause stress and increase exposure to infectious agents. These two effects are difficult to separate, because as the number of square feet per cow-calf pair decreases, the incidence of diarrhea increases.\n",
