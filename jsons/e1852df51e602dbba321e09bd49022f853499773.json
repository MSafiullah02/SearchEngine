The anti-class I immunoreactivity was distributed diffusely, probably involving most types of cells in the brain, whereas anti-class I1 immunoreactivity occurred mostly on cells around intracerebral vessels and in small foci in the brain parenchyma. The distribution of class I antigen was not limited to inflammatory cells or areas of the brain where viral antigens were demonstrated. This may suggest induction by some soluble signal substance released during the early phases of the viral infection. In 14-day-old rats with nonfatal infection, there was marked infiltration of T lymphocytes of cytotoxic/suppressor phenotype in the brain parenchyma, whereas T helper cell phenotypes were mainly located perivascularly.
