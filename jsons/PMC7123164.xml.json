However, the number of complications directly attributed to the procedure and leading to inadequate or poor hepatic functional status in the postoperative period remains a matter of concern. There has always been a problem of arriving at a consensus in the definition of the term: postoperative liver failure (PLF). The burgeoning rate of living donor liver transplants, with lives of perfectly healthy donors involved, has mandated a consensual definition, uniform diagnosis and protocol for management of PLF. The absence of a uniform definition has led to poor comparison among various trials. PLF remains a dreaded complication in resection of the liver, with a reported incidence of up to 8 % [1], and mortality rates of up to 30\u201370 % have been quoted [2]. Several studies have quoted a lower incidence of PLF in eastern countries, but when it occurs the mortality is as high as in the West [3].",

They focussed on serum bilirubin (SB) and prothrombin time (PT) as important prognostic markers of postoperative liver functional status and proposed the \u201850\u201350\u2019 criteria for the definition of PLF, i.e. the combination of PT >50 % of baseline normal and SB >50 \u03bcmol/L on postoperative day (POD) 5 (the \u201850\u201350\u2019 criteria) was found to be strongly predictive of mortality. The fact that this \u2018criteria\u2019 was a precursor of clinical complications 3\u20138 days before they appeared lent it a strong base for life-saving interventions. The criticism of this simple calculation has been that it relies only on two laboratory tests and does not factor in the existing clinical status of the patient. The \u201850\u201350\u2019 rule is limited by the fact that it cannot be applied before POD 5, does not stratify patients and though it predicts death in up to 70 % of patients, it is not based on the clinical severity of the patient.",

The relationship between infection and PLF has not been fully explained [8]. Patients with ALF are particularly prone to developing sepsis. It has been shown that 73 % of patients with PLF develop postoperative sepsis compared with 18 % of patients without [9]. Sepsis has a triad of detrimental effects on liver synthetic function, hepatocyte regeneration and apoptosis by inducing a relative hepatic ischaemia due to systemic hypotension. It induces Kupffer cell dysfunction, releases proinflammatory cytokines, and diminishes detoxification of liver endotoxins thereby leading to diminished hepatocyte proliferation and regeneration [10]. Liver surgery by itself may increase the incidence of infection [8] as major resections are associated with enteric bacterial translocation, which is enhanced by the prolonged inflow clamping and duration of surgery. A major liver resection involving multiple segments significantly impedes the function of the reticuloendothelial system, which is crucial in immune defence against sepsis.",

Over 20 % of patients undergoing a major liver resection have some degree of steatosis, significant enough to alter postoperative recovery [19]. Patients with biopsy-proven hepatic steatosis have a higher incidence of PLF (14 %) than patients with healthy livers (4 %) [20] even though the steatosis was of moderate grade. Belghiti et al. [21], reported a series of 478 patients who underwent liver resections, of which 37 patients had steatosis. Steatosis was an independent risk factor for postoperative complications (8 % of patients with steatosis), while only 2 % of patients with a normal histology developed complications. The increasing incidence of CASH, NASH and SOS has sparked interest in the use of preoperative liver biopsy as an assessment of the liver function and structure. Screening of high-risk patients (obese, high body mass index or those on chemotherapy) has been proposed. If a moderate degree of steatosis is established, these patients could benefit from manipulation of the volume, or surgery could be deferred till the acute changes subside either by treating the underlying aetiology or withdrawing the inciting agent.",

It has been suggested that patients needing liver resections be referred to centres that perform 10\u201317 liver resections per year [28]. Massive estimated blood loss (EBL) remains a key prognostic factor for a safe resection. EBL correlates with the extent of resection and the number of segments resected [29] and this correlates with the incidence of PLF. Massive EBL during a major liver resection should be anticipated in tumours abutting the inferior vena cava or major hepatic veins, or if there is injury to the middle hepatic vein during resection, and not by patient age, tumour size alone, or type of hepatectomy. Cirrhosis creates a hyperdynamic milieu with increased cardiac output and decreased systemic vascular resistance. The hepatic buffer response of the cirrhotic liver is altered: portal blood flow is reduced/shunted as a result of collaterals in portal hypertension, and arterial blood flow is impeded because of hepatic fibrosis and sinusoidal resistance. This altered flow renders the cirrhotic liver relatively anoxic and less tolerant to hypotension and hypoxia.",

Coagulopathy following blood loss with the inability of the liver to catch up, seems to increase the potential for intra-abdominal collections and bacterial infections. Avoiding prolonged hypotension and hypothermia by using judicious and timely transfusion, rapid infusion devices and safe surgical techniques is the key to salvage these patients. In fact, even major blood loss may be tolerated, if adequate efforts have been made to maintain euthermia, perfusion, avoid metabolic acidosis and provide an adequate and timely buffer against the dangerous triad of acidosis, hypothermia and coagulopathy resulting from EBL [30].

Direct bilirubin does not differentiate between extra- and intrahepatic cholestasis. However, it is an important factor of scores such as CTP and MELD for prognostication. Miyagawa et al. [37] found no significant differences in morbidity and mortality after major hepatectomies in spite of a raised SB. Postoperatively, SB is often increased; however this does not always indicate impending PLF.Serum bile acids evaluate excretion and shunting. Elevated bile acids are a good marker for portosystemic shunting with a sensitivity of over 90 % in detecting cirrhosis in patients with normal transaminases [38].Alkaline phosphatise (ALP) evaluates cholestasis. It is also synthesized in the bone and placenta and is elevated in metastasis and thus is not a specific hepatic marker. ALP also has a lag curve in acute obstruction. High preoperative alkaline phosphatase level is indicative of metastatic disease and may be associated with increased mortality after major resections [39]. Concomitant with a raised carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) level, it should raise a strong suspicion of liver metastasis.Gamma glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) evaluates cholestasis, enzyme induction, alcohol abuse, renal failure, myocardial infarction, diabetes and pancreatic diseases, and intake of enzyme inducing agents. Elevation of both GGT and ALP indicates a hepatic origin for ALP elevation.Transaminases evaluate necrosis and parenchymal damage. Raised serum levels do not correlate with the extent of parenchymal necrosis and have no prognostic value. Both enzymes are evaluated together as ALT is more liver specific and AST more sensitive to changes. After full course chemotherapy, transaminases can be elevated up to 2.5 times of normal. Partial hepatectomy induces only a mild-to-moderate increase in serum enzymes [40].Coagulation factors and PT evaluate synthetic functions. PT is a routine investigation and is used in prognostic scores. As its half-life is shorter, it is a better index of the synthetic function than serum albumin, which has a half-life of 20 days. Fibrinogen levels in mild liver disease are normal/slightly elevated but markedly decreased in massive hepatocellular damage. If the prothrombin time is prolonged, a detailed evaluation of the coagulation system is warranted. Massive hepatectomy invariable leads to a fall in platelet counts and a depression of coagulation factors such as factors I, II, V, VII, X and plasminogen [40] with resultant disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).Albumin evaluates synthesis. It is not only a part of the CTP score but is associated with many non-hepatic diseases such as renal disease, and nutritional entities such as protein malnutrition, protein-losing enteropathy and burns. Patients with preoperative albumin <3.0 g/dl are at risk of increased operative morbidity [41].\n",

When a hepatectomy is done in a patient with a high ICG15 retention, the volume of non-tumorous liver resected must be minimized. Hepatic function is estimated by ICG15 or of its maximal removal rate (ICG-Rmax). The ICG15 should be approximately 10 % in normal persons. The threshold value for a safe major hepatectomy is set at 14 %, although the cut-off of ICG clearance has shown significant reduction in cirrhotic patients who underwent resection and died subsequently. This was most accurate on day 3 following surgery. When ICGR15 exceeds 20 %, a major hepatectomy should be deferred [43]. Patients with ICGR15 between 14 and 20 % benefit from volume manipulation to achieve a viable FLR.",

Any change in hepatic flow or systemic perfusion causes variances in ICG rates. Therefore, they correlated liver stiffness with ICGR15 and liver biochemistry, to determine its reliability in predicting postoperative outcomes. Liver stiffness correlated well with ICGR15 in liver resection patients, and predicted early postoperative complications and was recommended, to provide \u2018better prognostic information for patients undergoing resection.\u20193.MEGX test: evaluates microsomal function and is a measure of the formation of the metabolite monoethylglycinexylidide (MEGX) after injection of a bolus of lidocaine and is evidence of the conversion rate of lidocaine by hepatic cytochrome P450.

However, imaging at present over estimates the FLR, and different formulae are in use, in an attempt to account for this error. The crux of any imaging or formula used is to ensure that the FLR is compatible with a smooth recovery and it is vital to assess the functional status of the FLR. Addition of preoperative hepatobiliary scintigraphy and CT volumetric measurement were performed by Dinant et al. in preoperative patients [48] to assess the accuracy of risk assessment for postoperative morbidity, liver failure and mortality.

It increases tolerance to the subsequent prolonged ischaemia and adenosine 5-triphosphate (ATP) depletion by exposing the parenchyma to brief intervals of anoxia and reperfusion before the final resection. It acts by presumably controlling IRI and retards the complement cascade. This reduces reperfusion injury particularly in steatotic patients. Clavien et al. [53, 54] did the initial trials and demonstrated a two-fold reduction in the postoperative serum transaminase levels. A reduced mass of apoptotic cells was noted on histopathology. A randomized trial by Chouker et al. [55] comparing ischaemic preconditioning and continuous clamping, showed stable cardiovascular haemodynamics, lowering the need for adrenaline/noradrenaline after liver reperfusion. Additionally, a recent Cochrane analysis observed no statistically significant difference in the mortality, liver failure, blood loss or haemodynamic changes [56]. However, length of hospital stay was significantly lower in the ischaemic preconditioning group.Intermittent vascular clamping: consists of repeated periods of 15 min of inflow clamping followed by 5-min reperfusion phases. Belghiti et al. [57] reported that in contrast to the presumption, blood loss was significantly more in the intermittent clamping group. Acute phase liver enzymes and transaminase levels were significantly higher in the continuous portal triad clamping group than in the intermittent portal inflow clamping group when livers with chronic liver disease were included. Postoperative SB levels in cirrhotics were also significantly higher in the continuous inflow clamping group compared to the intermittent portal inflow cohort. They concluded that livers with chronic disease do not tolerate continuous vascular clamping as well as normal livers.Avoiding inflow clamping: The Cochrane meta-analysis published in 2009 [56], based on three randomized trials, revealed statistically insignificant decreased blood loss with vascular clamping, when compared with no clamping. Total vascular occlusion is to be avoided unless resection is required at the cavohepatic junction when it cannot be avoided.Hypothermic liver preservation: Interest in decreasing warm ischaemia of transported livers has spawned experiments into isolating the inflow and perfusing cold preservative into the future liver remnant, which is immersed in crushed ice to maintain the core temperature of the liver at 4 \u00b0C. Hypothermic liver preservation when combined with total vascular exclusion attenuates IRI. In situ cold isolation techniques are still in their infancy and remain isolated case reports used in special situations with total vascular exclusion/cardiopulmonary bypass [58].Pharmacological preconditioning: It has been reported in a clinical study that the use of isoflurane before clamping the inflow protected the liver from IRI [59]. Preconditioning with sevoflurane also significantly reduced postoperative transaminase levels and the overall incidence of postoperative complications was reduced especially in patients with fatty livers. Inhaled nitric oxide has also been cited to \u2018significantly decreasing the length of hospital stay, improving serum transaminase levels and coagulation times, and reducing the number of apoptotic hepatocytes.\u2019 A similar effect has been demonstrated with preoperative administration of 500 mg of methylprednisolone [59]. During major resections, intraoperative preconditioning with 600 mg of alpha-lipoic acid also reduced markers of hepatic damage by inflow occlusion.\n",

The ALPPS approach is proposed to induce rapid hypertrophy of the FLR in patients with HCC and whose preoperative volume does not allow a safe resection. The procedure entails the combination of in situ splitting of the liver along the Cantlie\u2019s line and ligating the portal vein on the side of the tumour. Subsequently the second stage hepatectomy is done. The median FLR volume increase was 18.7 % within 1 week after the first phase and 38.6 % after the second [64, 65]. Recently, a number of trials comparing ALLPS and post-PVE liver resections have been published [66\u201368]. ALPPS has shown higher hypertrophy rates compared to PVE/PVL (40\u201380 % within a week compared to 8\u201327 %). However, ALPPS has higher sepsis rates (16\u201364 % of patients) and mortality rates (12\u201323 %).",

Two of these (the 50\u201350 criteria and the International Study Group of Liver Surgery [ISGLS] criteria) have been mentioned by the authors [2, 5]. The latter not only diagnoses the condition, it stratifies the severity into 3 categories. Grade A does not need any change in management strategy, Grade B may be managed without any invasive intervention while Grade C needs alteration in management including invasive intervention. The ISGLS criteria have been validated by one study [87]. The study detected post-hepatectomy liver failure using this criteria in 11 % of patients\u20138 % had Grade A, 72 % Grade B and 20 % Grade C. The mortality in these patients was 0 % in grade A, 12 % in grade B and 54 % in grade C. Thus, the grading has been shown to correlate with mortality.

            "text": "Various risk factors have been indentified and have been discussed elaborately by the authors. This should allow surgeons to select proper patients for extensive resection to avoid post-hepatectomy liver failure. The main issue is the adequacy of the residual liver volume and presence of cirrhosis. While 30 % of residual volume is adequate for extended resections in a normal liver, it is grossly inadequate for a cirrhotic patient in whom at least 40 % of liver volume is required. This brings us to the question of increasing future liver remnant by various strategies. Both portal vein embolization (PVE) and liver partition with portal vein ligation are effective. However, the simplicity of PVE makes it the most used approach. It has the advantage of the tumour biology being assessed during the waiting period of 4\u20136 weeks. If the tumour progresses especially with chemotherapy the patient should not undergo liver resection. On the question of properly selecting patients for major resection in cirrhosis the prevailing guidelines should be followed. These are Child\u2019s A status, platelet count above 100,000/cm, absence of clinically significant portal hypertension, a future liver remnant of 40 %, and the 15 min indocyanine green (ICG) clearance of no more than 15 %. A number of tests are available to assess various functional aspects of the liver but they are cumbersome, not available at most centres and more importantly are not accurate with the exception of 15 min ICG clearance. Even this is not done routinely in the West.",

Coagulapathy too is seen commonly. Altered kidney function usually occurs due to hepatorenal syndrome or acute tubular necrosis because of sustained hypotension causing compromised renal perfusion. With worsening renal function, fluid accumulates in the periphery or pulmonary bed. This often necessitates renal replacement therapy. With improvement in renal function the liver function also improves. Hepatic encephalopathy is seen more commonly in patients with renal failure because serum ammonia cannot be cleared by either the kidney or the liver. The presence of sepsis is another problem. Hypotension resulting from sepsis is detrimental to liver regeneration essentially due to ischaemia. Endotoxins produced in sepsis interfere with Kupffer cell activation and its function. One should not forget that following hepatic resection there is a depletion of Kupffer cells in the liver. Thus following hepatectomy there is a higher incidence of sepsis, and sepsis interferes with hepatic regeneration [91]. Therefore, every attempt must be made to avoid sepsis. Execution of the surgical procedure with utmost care avoiding excess blood loss, tissue necrosis, haematoma formation, prolonged ischaemia, etc. should minimize infection.",

Following hepatectomy the urine output may be low but it is expected. It is not necessary to give bolus fluid therapy in these patients unless they are grossly oliguric. Cirrhotic patients should probably be given parenteral nutrition in place of dextrose solutions because parenteral preparations have branch chain amino acids, dextrose, medium chain triglycerides, phosphates and vitamins. Usually up to 2 l of such fluid is necessary. If volume deficit exists, it should be managed with additional fluids. Parenteral nutrition in post-hepatectomy liver failure helps liver regeneration and decreases septic complications. The addition of phosphate is extremely important because it is necessary for both energy production and liver regeneration. Moreover the phosphate level goes down considerably after major liver resection [92]. Since the available phosphate solutions contain potassium, these may need to be stopped if the serum potassium level is high. The phosphate will then need to be replaced orally and the oral forms have sodium. Hence, the serum sodium would need to be monitored.",
