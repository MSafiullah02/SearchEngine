The area under the ROC curve (AUROC) of TyG for predicting severe COVID-19 patients was 0.664 (95% CI 0.576-0.751) (P = 0.001).

Our data also observed a high prevalence of diabetes in COVID-19 patients. Notably, we found that the TyG index, a reliable surrogate marker of IR, were predictive of severe cases and mortality of COVID-19 patients. Previous studies have shown that the TyG index may predict the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus [12] and metabolic syndrome [13] . It has been reported that the TyG index is positively associated with the higher prevalence of subclinical coronary artery disease (CAD) [14] , symptomatic CAD and metabolic and behavioral risk factors [15] , and arterial stiffness and nephric microvascular damage [16] . Moreover, higher TyG index correlated with increased risk of main adverse cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events (MACCE) in acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) patients, and the TyG index might be a valuable predictor of clinical outcomes in STEMI patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention [17] . Moreover, an elevated TyG index was significantly associated with a higher risk of arterial stiffness and nephric microvascular damage. The positive association of TyG index with increased risk of developing severe cases and the risk of mortality in confirmed COVID-19 patients, could be attributed to the roles of IR in metabolic disorder, an altered inflammation profile, and cardiovascular disease risk factors. These findings support the significance of TyG index as a valuable predictor of poorer outcomes for COVID-19 patients, and remind physicians that more intensive attention should be paid to patients with high level of TyG index.",

Yet, the fundamental pathophysiology of COVID-19 remains unknown. Previous studies have shown that increased concentrations of proinflammatory cytokines in serum (e.g., IL1B, IL6, IL12, IFN\u03b3, IL10, and TNF\u03b1) were induced in patients with SARS [21] and MERS [22] . Considering the large amount of cytokines induced by SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, a cytokine storm in the body might play a crucial role in pulmonary inflammation and extensive lung damage of patients with COVID-19. In early studies, COVID-19 was also reported to induce increased secretion of T-helper-2 (Th2) cytokines (e.g., IL4 and IL10) that suppress inflammation [4] . We noted that severe patients of COVID-19 had high amounts of inflammatory indicators (Ferritin and TNF\u03b1) in severe patients than mild ones, suggesting that the cytokine storm was associated with disease severity.",
