            "text": "Anti-microbial drug resistance (AMR) currently presents one of the most significant challenges to public health worldwide (Levy and Marshall, 2004). The incidence of cases infected with non-wild-type variants of pathogenic diseases continues to rise with endemic levels already witnessed in several regions (McKenna, 2013, Laxminarayan, Duse, Wattal, Zaidi, Wertheim, Sumpradit, 2013). Exacerbating the problem is the growing misuse and overuse of antimicrobial agents which, rather than suppressing pathogen strain diversity, often acts to accelerate the spread and diversification of mutant variants (Barbosa, Levy, 2000, Neu, 1992). More broadly, the emergence of new pathogen strains that have evolved to escape natural immunity within a population pose substantial risks to public health. Alarmingly, in many settings, direct transmission of these mutant pathogens is believed to have become the primary source of incident cases (Luciani, Sisson, Jiang, Francis, Tanaka, 2009, others, 2018) suggesting that intervention strategies targeting the transmission and treatment of wild-type strains alone will likely fail. Even with recent increases in funding (Simpkin et al., 2017), the ongoing arms race between pathogen evolution and the development of novel antibiotics is still being won by the former. Consequently, we are now faced with a rapidly diminishing arsenal of effective therapies \u2014 one which may soon prove inadequate (Hancock, 2007).",

Not only do mutant strains arise as a result of random microbiological processes (Alekshun and Levy, 2007), but phenotypically distinct variants initially appear in small numbers of hosts and must therefore escape a treacherous stochastic regime (i.e., avoid extinction) in order to establish themselves within the community. Often furthering this challenge is the presence of a resident endemic (possibly ancestral) strain that deprives the newly-emergent mutant of susceptible hosts (e.g., through cross-immunity). In spite of these challenges, countless mutant pathogens \u2014 often exhibiting varying levels of drug-resistance \u2014 have flourished and been able to firmly entrench themselves among host populations (Chang et al., 2015).",

The goal of this paper is to analyze the early-time dynamics of novel strain emergence in a stochastic setting whilst accounting for the background population dynamics associated with endemic infection. In particular, we investigate the conditions under which invasion by a novel strain is possible and calculate the probability of this event occurring, depending on the relative fitness (i.e., reproductive capacity) of the two strains, and the relevant characteristics of the host population (i.e., the heterogeneity in individual reproductive capacity). We then analyze the effects of control strategies and timing on the emergence of novel strains and discuss the implications of differential control efficacy when the invading strain boasts some level of resistance to treatment. The results of this investigation will extend analogous findings in single-strain settings and elucidate the consequences of different control mechanisms/timings in multi-strain systems \u2014 particularly the impact of differential control. Moreover the analytical framework that we develop will provide a flexible and robust theoretical basis for future modelling work.",

In this case the depletion of susceptible individuals due to infection is negligible such that (in an infection-na\u00efve population) the susceptible fraction remains approximately equal to one. Thus, to determine the epidemic trajectory we need only track the number of infected individuals and the rate at which they produce secondary cases, or offspring.

(Lloyd-Smith et al., 2005) in which the authors highlighted the importance of heterogeneity in individual infectiousness among members of the host population and its role in determining the fate of an infectious disease outbreak. By analyzing secondary case counts from several historical infectious disease outbreaks, including the 2003 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in Singapore, the authors demonstrated that in order to accurately reconstruct observed epidemics, models must account for individual heterogeneity in reproductive potential. In particular, they found that observed secondary case counts follow highly skewed distributions where outbreaks are driven by a small subset of so-called \u2018super-spreaders\u2019: individuals that generate a disproportionately large number of secondary cases, and that the large majority of infected individuals lead to no, or few, secondary infections. As a consequence of this disparity, the probability of extinction increases and epidemics become rarer (but more explosive), as heterogeneity increases. Importantly, their findings show that previous analyses that rely solely on population mean parameters \u2014 such as the basic reproduction number R\n0 \u2014 to model outbreak dynamics inadequately capture the true stochastic nature of disease spread, because the prospects of an epidemic outbreak depend critically on the distribution of infection potential within the host population. This work has since been extended in Yates et al. (2006) using a multi-type branching process framework to incorporate other forms of heterogeneity including susceptibility and assortative mixing leading to similar conclusions.",

We apply a branching process approximation to calculate the probability that strain i establishes itself within the community, i.e., avoids extinction, but note that the approximation used must necessarily account for the impact of the resident strain on the capacity of the invader to infect individuals. We note that Leventhal et al. (2015) take a similar branching process-based approach, but consider network structure explicitly, rather than allowing contact between any pairs of individuals as is the case here, i.e., we consider a well-mixed population. For simplicity, we assume that the background infection is in some quasi-stationary distribution (sensu\nBartlett (1957)). We also assume that the population is large, so that given the presence of the resident strain r, there remain sufficient susceptible individuals that the introduction of the invading strain i can be approximated by a branching process, and that early in the outbreak of i, the fraction of the population that are susceptible does not change substantially. Analysis is possible when these assumptions are broken, with results similar to those presented here; however these scenarios are often substantially more complex, and do not cover the full range of intervention scenarios considered here. For example, Hartfield and Alizon (2014) consider a scenario in which the resident strain is not in equilibrium, resulting in a more complex branching process approximation, and Humplik et al. (2014) evaluate establishment probability in a simple SIS model, but with finite N explicitly without a branching process approximation. More broadly, we emphasise that invasion of a second disease against an endemic strain in a fully-mixed population is a setting that has been considered several times previously, with early results in deterministic systems producing similar outcomes to those presented here (see e.g., Levin and Pimentel, 1981).",

Specifically, in our multi-strain scenario, infectious individuals come into contact with (other) individuals according to a Poisson process in the normal way, but rather than those individuals necessarily being susceptible (as in the na\u00efve case), they are only susceptible with probability (approximately) S\u00af/(N\u22121), where S\u00af is the mean endemic susceptible population, i.e., S\u00af=N/R0r, and N is the population size. (For convenience, we note that N\u2248(N\u22121) when N is large, and thus discard the \u22121 hereafter. Thus, S\u00af/N is the susceptible fraction of the population.) Consequently, given the presence of the endemic strain, we find that the effective reproduction number, Reffi, of the invading strain i at the time of its introduction is rescaled accordingly:(4)R0i\u2192Reffi=R0iS\u00afN=R0iR0r.\nR0i and R0r are the mean basic reproduction numbers of the invader and resident strain, respectively, as measured in the absence of the other. Note that this does not rely on a specific formulation around other disease dynamics, e.g., the presence of a recovered class and how waning immunity or replenishment of susceptibles occurs. To calculate the extinction probability of the invading strain in this case we need only replace R\n0 in Eq. (3) with Reffi=R0i/R0r, and solve numerically. The results are shown in Fig. 1\nwhere we effectively reproduce Fig. 2\nb) of Lloyd-Smith et al. (2005) with the x-axis rescaled from R0\u2192Reffi. Accordingly we now find that the epidemic threshold condition becomes Reffi>1 such that extinction of the invading strain is guaranteed for R0i<R0r. Once again, we observe that the extinction probability decreases monotonically with increasing Reffi and, as in Lloyd-Smith et al. (2005), that increasing individual heterogeneity (decreasing k) favours extinction.",

Conversely, polarized control is always effective for c > 0, and becomes increasingly so for c>1\u22121/R0r. We note that differences in the impact of uniform partial versus polarised control observed here resemble those observed for a single strain being introduced into an infection-naive population, for which polarised control is also known to be more effective (Gomes et al., 2014).",

We also demonstrated that the time at which control measures are implemented has a substantial impact on the effectiveness of control for preventing the emergence of new strains, and that this varied by the chosen means of control. Additionally, in the case of differential control, where the invading strain shows some level of resistance to the applied control measure, we found regions of parameter space for which control was detrimental and increasing c increased the invasion probability of the new strain.

That is, random, polarized control provides greater protection against potential strain invasions. This is again consistent with results around invasion in na\u00efve populations (Lloyd-Smith et al., 2005). This could provide an important consideration for managers choosing control strategies when concerns exist around AMR.

We note that the latter case, where control exists prior to the introduction of the invading strain, is likely to be more realistic, given the desire to control existing outbreaks. The difference between these two cases is the number of susceptible individuals made available to the newly introduced invading strain. In the simultaneous case, the susceptible pool remains depleted by the presence of the resident strain such that the invading strain is inhibited by both a reduced S(t=0)=N/R0r and the added burden of control. In the prior scenario, the susceptible population has been replenished by control measures applied to the resident strain, S(t=0)=N/((1\u2212c)R0r). In this latter case, the effects of uniform partial control on the invading strain are negated by the increase in available susceptibles: Reff,ci=Reff. Only once the level of control is sufficient to eradicate the resident strain, i.e., c>1\u22121/R0r (and the susceptible population then becomes the whole population, N) does uniform partial control start to impede the invasion prospects of the invading strain.

For example, given that both infection potential and susceptibility are functions of the number of contacts an individual experiences, these quantities may be naturally correlated. Leventhal et al. (2015) approach this problem by imposing an explicit contact-network structure on the study population, such that heterogeneity in susceptibility was directly linked to the heterogeneity in infectiousness through the (fixed) number of contacts shared by each individual. In this context, invasion events were found to be less likely because potential \u2018super-spreading\u2019 hosts (or hubs in the network) were often already infected with the resident strain meaning they were unable to perpetuate the spread of the invading strain, whilst simultaneously providing protection to susceptible satellite nodes.

In particular, accuracy varied when heterogeneity in individual reproductive capacity was high, and when parameter choices caused the endemic disease to be at risk of natural extinction (even without the influence of the invader). We also emphasize that the branching process approximation is limited in that it can only quantify the probability of initial strain extinction: There is likely some additional probability of subsequent fade-out due to depletion of susceptibles (e.g., sensu\nBallard et al. (2016)). A separate analysis would be necessary to investigate this phenomenon.",

If instead there was a possible ancestral relationship between the resident strain and the invader, where the resident effectively fuels the invading cohort with continual reinforcements, invasion dynamics would likely be different. It would be interesting then to re-evaluate our results with a coupling between the two strains: our expectation is that with a perpetual supply of reinforcements, replacement with any fitter (i.e., R0i>R0r) variants is guaranteed \u2014 it just a question of when. Further, assuming an ancestral relationship between the competing strains we could also model multiple epochs (i.e., we would not terminate the simulation after a single replacement event has occurred) and follow the evolution of the pathogen (see also (Yates et al., 2006)). These considerations are left as avenues for future research.",

In addition to population-wide effects, this has important implications at the individual level, where the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics can inadvertently eliminate colonizing bacterial infections (e.g., Staphylococcus aureus), and thus further highlights the importance of antibiotic stewardship. Perhaps the most critical outcome of this work is the potential for the invading strain to become established even when it is less transmissible than the resident due to differential control. The emergence of mutant strains in the presence of endemic backgrounds is of substantial concern in many disease settings (particularly e.g., Tuberculosis), and the impact of differential control highlighted here should be considered in any future control efforts as well as efforts to model multi-strain dynamics in these systems.",
