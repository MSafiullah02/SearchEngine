Routine vaccination of health workers in areas where Ebola infection is known to be a risk within west and central Africa, could be a major intervention to prevent Ebola outbreaks. The majority of outbreaks, including the most recent outbreak in DR Congo in 2014, occurred after health workers became infected.1, 2, 3, 4 Infected heath workers inadvertently serve as a conduit of infection to their own family members or caretakers, and from these initial infections, transmission is sustained in the community by direct contact with patients or dead bodies. Some evidence indicates that if Ebola emerges and its transmission is not amplified by infection of health workers, outbreaks do not occur.5, 6 More widespread preventive vaccination in general populations living in high-risk areas would depend on cost-benefit analysis, operational feasibility, and acceptance.",

Although the Board of GAVI, the vaccine alliance, has approved plans of up to US$300 million for vaccine procurement and up to $90 million for the strengthening of infrastructure to provide vaccines, a long-term market will depend on the WHO recommendations7 for vaccine use, once the vaccines have been shown to be safe and effective, and the ability of countries and the donor community to provide funding for procurement.",

Research consortia are now setting up logistical support platforms, training research assistants for clinical trial conduct, ensuring community engagement, and obtaining national ethical and regulatory clearance and other permissions required so that trials can begin.

A logical conclusion would be that trials would need to rapidly reassume when and where the next Ebola outbreak occurs. Because emergence that leads to an outbreak is a random and unpredictable event, this emergence might not occur in the countries that are working to prepare for the trials at present. Lessons from the multicentre Mechanisms of Severe Acute Influenza Consortium (MOSAIC) project in the UK might be of use. Designed and funded to improve the understanding of clinical and immunological progression of H1N1 virus while it was circulating among UK populations, the MOSAIC project faced many delays in start-up. The conclusions were that expedited ethical approval, a single pre-existing template for any material transfer agreements, and research and development approvals in advance of the expected influenza season of high transmission were crucial to the efficient management of an outbreak.",

Large community-based trials would be far easier to do with a vaccine that was already registered and stockpiled, and for which policy recommendations for use were in place. With this approach in place, industry might be more inclined to scale up and dedicate manufacturing capacity for a vaccine that could be registered in the near term than it would be for a vaccine approved under traditional approaches. But it must be clear to all, including pharmaceutical companies, that accelerated licensure does not equate to accelerated marketing, but rather, that registration of an Ebola vaccine in advance would make it much simpler to introduce the vaccine for study in the event of a new outbreak.",

If WHO's Strategic Advisory Group of Experts (SAGE) on Immunization were to provide a recommendation for GAVI to support purchase of stockpile vaccine for efficacy studies, there might be a way to decrease the risk of broken post-licensure promises. The vaccine stockpile would require periodic renewal as the vaccines are used up in trials or expire, and a contract to replenish or renew the stockpile could be made conditional on compliance with efficacy trials. An even stronger mechanism could be for a regulatory agency to block sales of vaccine to non-government purchasers or to put an expiration clause into the approval letter that would require the manufacturer to repeat safety tests. Post-approval safety monitoring also requires national pharmacovigilance systems, but such systems are fledgling or non-existent in most developing countries, and there is an urgent need to implement these systems. Even so, any commitment for post-approval efficacy studies will always be conditional upon there being another outbreak.",
