WHO named the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 as COVID-19 (CoronaVirus Disease-2019). It is very intriguing to see a mild trend of infection in some countries which could be attributed to mitigation efforts, lockdown strategies, health infrastructure, demographics and cultural habits. However, the lower rate of infection and death rates in mostly developing countries, which are not placed at higher levels in terms of healthcare facilities, is a very surprising observation. To address this issue, we hypothesize that this lower rate of infection is majorly been observed in countries which have a higher transmission/prevalence of protozoan parasite borne disease, malaria. We compared the COVID-19 spread and malaria endemicity of 108 countries which have shown at least 200 cases of COVID-19 till 18 th April 2020. We found that the number of COVID-19 cases per million population correlates negatively with the malaria endemicity of respective countries.",

However, there are striking differences in the behavior of COVID-19 spread in different countries of different continents. For example, United States of America is been shown to have highest number of cases and the spread is pretty fast with high mortality rates (www.cdc.gov). On the other hand South Korea and Taiwan, despite having initial cases have been reported too early, show a slower spread of infection and less mortality rate. Medical infrastructure and correct timing of restrictions on public gatherings and movement can be listed as factors which has led to such differences in the menace created by this virus [1] .",

            "text": "We propose an alternate hypothesis regarding the spread of COVID-19, which is that there is limited spread of the disease in malaria endemic countries as compared to malaria free countries. Malaria is a vector borne disease caused by apicomplexan parasite i.e. Plasmodium sp. Malaria is a deadly disease that causes about 228 million cases and more than 405,000 deaths per year globally as per WHO report 2019. Malaria distribution across the world can be divided as endemic regions and non-endemic regions as per the number of cases reported per million of the population (WHO malaria report 2019). In endemic areas, malaria is being reported to occur repeatedly throughout the year and hence the population in these areas get infection at regular intervals [2] . Malaria cases have also been governed by presence of vector, Anopheles mosquitoes in that region as they are the prime carriers of the parasite. Some countries are free of malaria due to the climate conditions, lack of vector and successful malaria eradication efforts which include North America and Europe along with others [3] . Population in malaria endemic countries are been reported to achieve a natural protection against future infection by generating combination of Th1 and Th2 response against the pathogen. This anti-malaria immunity can stay for longer durations, upto 3 years in some cases [4] . Lower number of COVID-19 cases are being reported from Malaria endemic countries (WHO COVID-19 status report). In the light of the fact that immunity against one pathogen can be effective in controlling infection by another pathogen, as also suggested by various studies including BCG vaccination [5] , [6] ; we hypothesize that antimalaria immunity may play a role in slowing down the spread of COVID -19 viral infection.",

However, these countries still have reported roughly 40-60 COVID-19 cases/million of the population. China is surprisingly seen among this group having lower COVID-19 burden at 57.43 cases/million, which could be because of many reasons. Firstly, the SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans originated in Wuhan city of China's Hubei province, so it was very easy for Chinese administration to contain the disease in local area and directing the mitigation efforts to one particular area rather than at scattered hotspots as in case of other countries. In addition to this, the vast landscape of China along with largest population in the world (>1.4 billion) has brought down COVID-19 cases/million despite having ~82,000 cases of COVID-19 placed at 7 th position in the world in terms of total number of cases. Sri Lanka is another outlier in this group having only 11.6 COVID-19 cases/million which could be explained by the fact that it has become malaria-free just 3-4 years back and had significant malaria burden earlier, along with this, the local government's well-articulated and timely mitigation efforts further helped in halting the SARS-CoV-2 spread.",

All of these countries showed less than 1000 total cases of COVID-19 thereby, suggesting the negligible or no spread of this disease among its population ( figure 3) .

In such situations, case fatality rate (CFR) will be a better assessment tool to understand the fatality of COVID-19 infection in malaria endemic as well as malaria free countries. For this, we analyzed the case fatality rate (expressed as percentage of COVID-19 positive cases who succumbed to the disease) for the four groups of countries divided on the basis of malaria burden as described in the previous sections. In total population of malaria free seventy six countries the COVID-19 case fatality rate is 6.63% and is highest among all the groups (Figure 4 ). In the second group having mild malaria burden of 1 to 1000 cases/million, the COVID-19 case fatality rate of 3.88% is observed. Similarly, for the group with moderate malaria burden of 1000 to 100 thousand cases/million, the COVID-19 case fatality rate of 4.63% is observed. Whereas, in the group having severe burden of malaria >100 thousand cases/million, the COVID-19 case fatality rate is just 2.58% which is the lowest among four groups and also significantly lower than that of malaria free countries ( Figure 4) . These case fatality statistics further support that along with lesser spread, the fatality of SARS-CoV-2 is also mild in populations having higher malaria burden.",

Based on our analyses we hypothesize that there is natural resistance against the spread of this viral disease in malaria endemic countries, which can be partially explained by immunity generated against recurrent malaria infections in these endemic regions [7, 8] . The countries of African and Asian regions where malaria is prevalent, have shown considerably fewer cases of COVID-19 infections as well as mortalities. Whereas, majority of the European countries, which haven't seen much of malaria infection due to Plasmodium, have reported much higher number of COVID-19 cases and associated mortalities. Hence, the population that has always remained unexposed to malaria antigens thereby lacking anti-malarial immunity, showed a significantly higher burden of COVID-19 in comparison to populations which are exposed to malaria infections.",

In this antagonistic phenomenon, pathogen of certain species can inhibit the infection by another one through inhibiting the invasion, survival and/or reproduction of another pathogen [9] . Different parasites are been reported to reduce the severity of viral infections, one of such example comes from Giardia which can reduce the severity and infection of rotavirus if concurrent infection takes place [10] . Plasmodium infection also can influence the infection caused by Chiukungnya virus [11] where the protection is attributed to the inhibition of CD8+ cell migration due to Plasmodium infection [11] .

It is a common assumption that immunity against malaria parasite is shortlived and that a continuous exposure to parasite antigens is needed to keep it alive. However, several studies came up which differ from such observations and have pointed out that in endemic areas anti-malarial immunity survive for longer durations [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] . It has been observed that immigrants from endemic areas maintain some clinical immunity against clinical malaria [24] [25] [26].

Countries with malaria burden of 1-1000 cases/million showed a mixed kind of response to COVID-19 with burden ranging from 2.8 and 9.6 cases/million for Vietnam and Bangladesh respectively, to 452 and 883 cases/million in Ecuador and Panama respectively (Figure 3). High density of COVID-19 cases in Ecuador and Panama could be due to significantly lower malaria burden (95.1 and 185 cases/million, respectively). Among these, Republic of Korea has the highest total number of COVID-19 cases (10,613 cases) but its well praised mitigation efforts and medical interventions have helped it to significantly curtail the spread of SARS-COV-2. Also, it has a negligible malaria burden of only 9.8 cases/million. Countries with yearly malaria infections between 1,000 to 100 thousand cases/million showed a very low numbers of COVID-19 burden ranging from ~4.3 to 446.8 cases/million. Out of these 10 countries, Djibouti, Peru and Brazil have highest density of COVID-19 at nearly 447, 352 and 137 cases/million respectively. Djibouti surprisingly has very high COVID-19 cases/million despite having high malaria burden of ~26,000 cases/million but it could be explained by looking at the number of actual COVID-19 cases and its population. It has reported only 435 cases of COVID-19 but due to its smaller population of only ~973,000, the COVID-19 burden expressed as cases per million, become high enough to create delusion. Peru on the other hand despite having malaria burden of 1798",
