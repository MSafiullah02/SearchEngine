Coronavirus infection in humans mainly affects the upper respiratory tract and to a lesser extent the gastrointestinal tract. Clinical symptoms of coronavirus infections can range from relatively mild (similar to the common cold) to severe (bronchitis, pneumonia, and renal involvement). The disease caused by the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) was called Covid-19 by the World Health Organization in February 2020. Face-to-face communication and consistent exposure to body fluids such as blood and saliva predispose dental care workers at serious risk for 2019-nCoV infection. As demonstrated by the recent coronavirus outbreak, information is not enough. During dental practice, blood and saliva can be scattered. Accordingly, dental practice can be a potential risk for dental staff, and there is a high risk of cross-infection. This article addresses all information collected to date on the virus, in accordance with the guidelines of international health care institutions, and provides a comprehensive protocol for managing possible exposure to patients or those suspected of having coronavirus.",

Their helical symmetry nucleocapsid is approximately 26-32 kb in size, making it the largest investigated genome among RNA viruses [2, 3] . Coronaviruses have a fundamental resemblance in their organization and genome expression [4] . Previously, it was thought that coronaviruses only cause enzootic infections in a number of animals, including certain birds and mammals, but recent findings indicate that a variety of these viruses, including antigenic groups 1 (229E and NL63), antigenic groups 2 (OC43), and HKU1, can infect humans [5, 6] . These viruses often lead to upper respiratory tract infection, frequently resulting in common cold symptoms. Three specific strains of these viruses that are of zoonotic origin, including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), have recently caused lethal infections in humans [4, 6, 7] .",

The incubation period of 2019-nCov has been estimated to be 1-14 days, and it has been shown that asymptomatic individuals may also be involved in the spread of this virus [26] [27] [28] . Since the possibility of the transmission from asymptomatic carriers has been raised currently, checking body temperature only may not be enough to screen asymptomatic carriers. According to a recent report, temperature-based screening in the airport can detect only 46% of 2019-nCoV carriers and the others were found during the self-isolation period after immigration [29] . To suppress the disease spread, a wide range of laboratory tests for immigrants and general population seems to be necessary. However, the infection rate from asymptomatic carriers has not been clarified until now. The primary non-specific reported symptoms of 2019-nCoV infection at the prodromal phase are malaise, fever, and dry cough. The most commonly reported signs and symptoms are fever (98%), cough (76%), dyspnea (55%), and myalgia or fatigue (44%) [25, 26] . Unlike patients with other human coronavirus infections (such as SARS-CoV), upper respiratory tract and intestinal manifestations such as sore throat, rhinorrhea, and diarrhea in those with 2019-nCoV infection are infrequent [15, 25, 26] (Fig. 1 ).",

Typical clinical manifestations of Covid-2019 do not comprise ocular symptoms. However, conjunctival sample analysis has revealed that the transmission of 2019-nCoV is not limited to the respiratory tract route [26] , but ocular exposure is also an effective method of virus transmission [44] . Moreover, studies have revealed that via direct/indirect contact or course and/or droplets, respiratory viruses such as 2019-nCoV may be transmitted from human to human. Studies have also shown direct and indirect transmission of 2019-nCoV through saliva [45] . For a comprehensive understanding of the transmission dynamics of 2019-nCoV, it is also important to know that this virus is also transmissible through asymptomatic patients [34] . The remarkable feature of 2019-nCoV is that its RNA is detectable via quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) in stool samples after the first week of infection [46] . However, the aerosol and fecal-oral transmission routes, which carry more public concern, still need further investigation and confirmation [47] (Fig. 3) .",

Since 2019-nCoV effectively uses ACE2 receptor for cell invasion, it can promote human-tohuman transmission [50] . ACE2+ cells are abundantly present all over the respiratory tract. ACE2+ epithelial cells present in the salivary glands were considered one of the main targets of SARS coronavirus infection. Similarly, 2019-nCoV may also use the same mechanism to induce infection, although definitive judgment regarding this issue needs further study [51] . Due to close face-to-face contact with patients and frequent utilization of sharp devices, dental personnel are repeatedly exposed to respiratory tract secretions, blood, saliva, and other contaminated body fluids and are always at risk for 2019-nCoV infection. 2019-nCoV transmission in dental settings occurs through four major routes: (1) direct exposure to respiratory secretions containing droplets, blood, saliva, or other patient materials;",
