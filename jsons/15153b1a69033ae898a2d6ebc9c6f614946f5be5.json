Trying to understand the disease mechanisms and fi nding the remedial measures have been the quest of humankind. The susceptibility to disease of an individual in a given population is determined by ones genetic buildup. Response to treatment and the disease prognosis also depends upon individual's genetic predisposition. The environmental stress induces mutations and is leading to the emergence of ever-increasing more dreaded infectious pathogens, and now we are in the era of increasing antibiotic resistance that has thrown up a challenge to fi nd new treatment regimes. Discoveries in the science of high-throughput sequencing and array technologies have shown new hope and are bringing a revolution in human health. The information gained from sequencing of both human and pathogen genomes is a way forward in deciphering host-pathogen interactions. Deciphering the pathogen virulence factors, host susceptibility genes, and the molecular programs involved in the pathogenesis of disease has paved the way for discovery of new molecular targets for drugs, diagnostic markers, and vaccines. The genomic diversity in the human population leads to differences in host responses to drugs and vaccines and is the cause of poor response to treatment as well as adverse reactions. The study of pharmacogenomics of infectious diseases is still at an early stage of development, and many intricacies of the host-pathogen interaction are yet to be understood in full measure.

The lifespan of the human has increased considerably with the advent of vaccines against several diseases which has eradicated small pox, and now we are embarking on the global campaign to eradicate poliomyelitis and have controlled the disease in most parts of the world. The treatment of infectious diseases got a boost with the discovery of penicillin by Alexander Fleming in the earlier part of the twentieth century. As a range of antibiotics were later discovered, infectious diseases such as meningitis, bacterial pneumonia, sepsis, and other lifethreatening bacterial infection were treatable. Also the survivability of patients undergoing operative procedures and aggressive chemotherapy was feasible and their recovery high. The last 50 years of the twentieth century have been eventful with the discovery of antimicrobials that had given us the hope that we shall eradicate all infectious diseases. Despite all the efforts and progress we have made in medical science, infectious disease remained a major health problem. But the golden era of the antibiotics will not be long if we go on unregulated administering and promoting rampant use of antibiotics, as is evident from the rise of antibiotic resistance (Caramia and Ruffi ni 2012 ) , and the new emerging diseases have posed major challenge (Table 27 .1 ). In the last few decades with the advent of fi eld of genomics, there is a new hope in prevention, diagnostics, and treatment of infectious diseases. We will explore in this chapter The table highlights the organisms that are of public health importance and their year of discovery Source : World Health Organization: Newly discovered organisms of public health importance: Page 6. From WHO Regional Offi ce East-Asia: Combating Emerging Infectious Diseases in South East Asia Region (2005) how the host genetic polymorphisms of drug-metabolizing enzymes and transporters affect the bioavailability of the drugs which further determine the effi cacy and toxicology of the drugs used for treatment. Further, the fi eld of structural biology and chemistry has intertwined to give rise to medical structural genomics leading the way to the discovery of new drug targets against infectious diseases. This chapter explores how the advent of \"omics\" technologies is making a beginning in bringing about a change in the prevention, diagnosis, and treatments of the infectious diseases and hence paving way for personalized medicine.",

The major fi ndings of these studies have shown how the pathogen virulence factors modify host cell factor expression (Roy and Mocarski 2007 ) . The role of pathogen recognition receptors (PRR) affecting hostpathogen interaction has been studied. These studies have shown that the host cell responses have an alarm signal (Jenner and Young 2005 ) . Studies have also shown that gene cluster signals are responsible for generating the alarm signals that are the target of attack by the invading pathogens (Hamon and Cossart 2008 ) .

            "text": "Functional genomics have also led to the development of tools to decipher infectious diseases by manipulating the cellular mechanisms. The technology of the RNA interference (RNAi) has undergone tremendous development in the last decade which has led to the large-scale reverse genetic screens in human cells and model organisms (Boutros and Ahringer 2008 ) . RNAi technology uses double-stranded ribonucleic acid (dsRNA) with having complementary sequence to the target mRNA sequence and is used to silence or downregulate the gene expression of its target. Long dsRNA induces interferons or other unspecifi c responses in mammalian cells which is avoided by the use of small interfering dsRNA (siRNA) directly or small hairpin RNA (shRNA). RNAi screening using RNA probes, which induces loss of function of host genes, leads to discovery of host resistance factors (HRF). It is made possible when silencing this restrictive factors leads to invading pathogen replication enhancement and may also identify host susceptibility factors (HSF) and also identify permissive factors, that when silenced will decrease the pathogen replication. The RNAi screens still have some limitations due to offtarget siRNA effect (Echeverri et al. 2006 ) . Thus, the primary screening validation is made by using additional siRNA screens. From the several RNAi screenings in human and in fruit fl y cells, only 300 host factors were validated from about 10,000 and 20,000 targets identifi ed in the initial screen (Agaisse et al. 2005 ; Brass et al. 2008 ; Konig et al. 2008 ; Krishnan et al. 2008 ; Zhou et al. 2008 ) . To make the system biological tools like RNAi more effective in fi nding mechanisms in host-pathogen interaction and thus fi nding cure for the microbial infections, there is a need for integrations of all data obtained from the omics technologies. In addition several rounds of biological experimentations are required by using mutant pathogens, cellular RNAi knockdowns, or humanized animal models using mice or primate infection model. The resulting inferences from the validated data would help us build predictive models which could lead us to the better understanding of pathogen interactions with the host.",

            "text": "It is evident from human history of infectious diseases that not everybody in a given population is affected by an infective disease. For an infective organism to cause an infection, both the virulence of the pathogen and the host susceptibility are important. The identifi cation of genetic factors of host innate and adaptive immunity that determine the protection from pathogen is an important endeavor of scientists. Animal models of infectious diseases especially mouse models have been used to fi nd the genetic factors and biochemical mechanism of disease susceptibility (Marquet and Schurr 2001 ) . The identifi cation of candidate genes responsible for disease susceptibility or resistance and the occurrence of genetic polymorphism in them give us the best possible biological scenario of the disease. Researchers have found that in bacterial diseases, tuberculosis and leprosy seem to have similar genetic susceptibility determinants in the host as exemplifi ed from the fi nding that higher incidence of these diseases was found in the monozygotic twins than in dizygotic twins and siblings (Abel et al. 1995 ; Vidal et al. 1995 ) . Mouse model of infections has revealed that gene encoding the natural resistance-associated macrophage protein 1 ( Nramp1 ) confers natural resistance to infections caused by Mycobacterium , Salmonella , and Leishmania . Nramp1 is found in the membrane of the phagosome of the macrophages where it seems to be probably affecting the replication of the infecting intracellular bacterium (Gruenheid et al. 1997 ) . The genomic analysis in humans has found a similar gene to that of mice which is also having similar pattern of expression. Hence, it has been inferred that humans too carry similar susceptibility gene. There have been further studies which have shown that polymorphisms found in the Nramp1 gene are related to the infectivity of leprosy and tuberculosis (Abel et al. 1998 ). In one of the studies, it was found that persons who carry an Nramp1 heterozygous variant will be four times more likely to be infected by tuberculosis than persons who are carrying more common variants of the Nramp1 (Bellamy et al. 1998 ). Cell-mediated immunity plays an important role in the context of tuberculosis and is well studied. Research has further gone ahead to fi nd links between tuberculosis susceptibility and polymorphism in the gene coding for receptors of interferon-\u03b3 and interleukin-12, which are cytokines belonging to T-helper cell type 1 (Th 1). The absence of functional copies of either of these genes in families and of isolated patients leads to high susceptibility to M. tuberculosis infection (Jouanguy et al. 1996 (Jouanguy et al. , 1997 Newport et al. 1996 ; Altare et al. 1998 ) .",

The HLA class I glycoproteins are highly expressed on the surface of every nucleated human cell, and they present endogenous peptides derived from the cell to the cytotoxic T cells. HLA class I glycoprotein plays a major role during the viral infection as it presents intracellular viral peptides on the surface which leads to cellmediated immune response, which further leads to the destruction of virus-infected cells. HLA class II glycoproteins which are present on the surface of antigen-presenting cells (APCs) on the other hand present 9-14 amino acids long peptides that are derived from the engulfed pathogen and displayed on the surface which then are recognized by T cell as foreign antigens, and it will elicit an immune response to the antigen. The length of antigen as well as composition are important in deciding if the antigenic peptide will bind to the antigenic peptide-binding cleft. Polymorphisms occur almost solely in the peptide-binding cleft of HLA class I and II in the glycoproteins. The diversity of HLA-binding region ensures that some pathogenic peptides will be preferentially presented compared to the others. Thus, in a given population, the HLA diversity ensures the advantage that some of the HLA glycoprotein peptide-binding clefts will be able to bind and present the pathogenic antigen peptide which will lead to an immune response to any invading pathogen. This ensures the survivability of the species against an infection.",

Neisseria meningitidis serogroup B is responsible for causing about one third of infection. The genome sequence of N. meningitidis has opened a new way for disease management (Pizza et al. 2000 ; Tettelin et al. 2000 ) . The vaccine that was used only contained capsular polysaccharides from the serogroups A, C, Y, and W135 only. Serogroup B polysaccharide contained elements that resemble human polysialic acid and hence is poorly immunogenic and might generate autoantibodies (Hayrinen et al. 1995 ) . In this scenario the N. meningitidis serogroup B was sequenced, and 350 potential antigens from the serogroup B were expressed in Escherichia coli to fi nd the potential vaccine candidate. The expressed proteins are injected into mice to fi nd immunogenic antigens that can developed into a vaccine. Similar strategies are being used to fi nd vaccine candidates for other serotypes of Neisseria species and for other pathogenic organisms. Pathogen genomic information is also being used to fi nd the immunologically important peptides for cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) epitopes. The response of CTLs is to seek out virally infected cells by recognizing the peptides presented by human leukocyte antigen (HLA) glycoproteins on the cell surface and killing the infected cells. CTL epitopes are the viral peptide that is presented by the HLA and recognized by CTLs. The peptides are of the length of 10 amino acids, and genome sequence is used to fi nd out and synthesize these peptides for immunogenic evaluation. Amino acids are divided into segments of peptide, measuring 10 amino acids in length and overlapping the previous peptides 9 amino acids, for example, West Nile virus genome translates into 3,433 amino acids which can be segmented into 3,424 peptides that are 10 amino acids in length.",

Thus, the time and effort to screen for the CTL epitopes have been reduced drastically. CTL epitopes may be used for making subunit-based vaccines and diagnostic tests.

First is by direct detection where the pathogens can be detected directly by imaging technologies of microscopy and cell culture. Second method of diagnosis is by the detection of proteins produced by pathogens by the use of specifi c antibodies, like that used in enzymelinked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Third method is by detection of the specifi c antibodies IgA, IgM, and IgG against the pathogens and the changes in their titers using antibody capture assay. Fourth method uses detection of nucleic acid of the pathogens and amplifying their signal using techniques like polymerase chain reaction. Latest diagnostic technologies have been developed on these basic four biotechnological technologies (Speers 2006 ) . Pathogen genome can also be used to identify the infecting organism itself. Microbial DNA in the clinical specimen can be used to identify the disease-causing pathogens. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis virus, Borrelia burgdorferi (causative agent of Lyme disease), and mycobacteria are few examples of pathogens that can be identifi ed by their genomic sequences. Mycobacterium tuberculosis antimicrobial resistance strain-caused infections are becoming quite common, and genomic information has deciphered few potential candidates like katG gene mutations in resistant strains (Siqueira et al. 2009a , b ; Marahatta et al. 2011 ) . The traditional culture test for mycobacterium which is time-consuming and less sensitive is giving way to restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP), a specifi c technique used in DNA fi ngerprinting (Van Soolingen 2001 ). The technology uses restriction enzymes that cut DNA at the places having certain particular nucleotide sequences. The nucleotide pattern that is obtained is then compared to the previously identifi ed specifi c nucleotide pattern of the genome of the pathogen DNA. DNA patterns can be separated on the basis of length, and the pattern of DNA fragments in the DNA fi ngerprint is characteristic of particular isolate, and each particular pathogen has a unique pattern. DNA fi ngerprint technology is faster and reliable than culturing of the mycobacteria, ideal for discovering new drug-resistant strains from unique genomic sequences of each mycobacterium. The technology is very useful for identification of strains during the time of outbreaks and further epidemiological studies.",

For example, HIV viral loads are detected by enzymatic amplifi cation of the viral nucleic acid and detection of the signal from the labeled probes that hybridizes with them. The signal usually is either a color signal conjugated to the probe or a chemiluminescent probe, and the intensity of the signal corresponds to the number of copies of the nucleic acid RNA.

Genomic mutations allow the certain bacterial strains to overcome the effects of antimicrobials and are able to propagate in spite of the presence of antibiotics. Fluoroquinolones are drugs that act on the bacterial DNA replication by binding to bacterial enzymes involved in bacterial DNA replication, that is, DNA gyrase and topoisomerase. The bacterial resistance to quinolone occurs due to mutation in the quinolone-binding site in the enzymes mentioned above. The mutation leads to change in the amino acid at the site of binding of fl uoroquinolones to the enzymes. If both the bacterial enzymes are mutated, then high-level resistance occurs to the quinolone drug affecting the treatment of infection as compared to when either of the enzymes is mutated (Hooper 2001 ) . Now genetic test is available to detect antimicrobial resistance in the infecting pathogens. The information is important because it would lead to a better treatment management of the infection. The methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus phenotype is detected when cultured in the presence of oxacillin after a period of 24 h. Before the era of omics technology, the only means of resistance detection was by culture test which is a very time-consuming test. Methicillin resistance in S . aureus is controlled by alternations of penicillin-binding protein PBP2a. Gene mecA controls the production of PBP2a. Polymerase chain reaction test is used to detect the presence of mecA in reference laboratories, while commercially developed kit can detect the same using a fl uorescein-labeled mecA probe. Both DNA probe and PCR technology when used for analysis can detect mecA -resistant gene in a given sample in less than 3 h.

Vaccines are used to mimic the infective disease conditions that induce immunological memory to protect the individual against subsequent exposure to the pathogen and lead to prevention of disease. The phenomenon to gain protective immunity against a pathogen upon being vaccinated for the particular pathogen depends on individual genetic build. As studies have shown, not all healthy individuals are able to generate a protective immune response upon vaccination. It has been observed in the case of measles vaccination that only 10 % of the population was seronegative and clustered in family (Poland 1999a , b ; Poland et al. 1999c ). Both HLA I and HLA II class alleles have been responsible for the measles vaccine response, while HLA-B7, HLA-B51, HLA-DRB1*13, and HLA-DQA1*01 are associated with positive measles vaccine response, and HLA-B, HLA-DR, and HLA-DQA1 have been responsible for the vaccine being noneffective (Hayney et al. 1996 (Hayney et al. , 1998 Poland et al. 1998 ).",

The infection is caused by intracellular protozoan parasites of Leishmania genus. There are more than 20 species of Leishmania . The type of infective species, virulence factors, and host immune responses and depending on the clinical symptoms, the disease is categorized into cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) and visceral leishmaniasis (VL). VL is also known as kala-azar; the origin of the name is from the eastern and northeastern part of the Indian subcontinent where the disease is endemic. Depending upon the place where one has acquired the infection, CL is further categorized into \"New World\" from Central America and South America and \"Old World\" if from Asia, Middle East, Africa, or southern Europe. More than 1-1.5 million cases of leishmaniasis occur worldwide (about 80 countries are affected) with major countries being the developing nations of Asia, Africa, and Latin America ( www.who.int/topics/leishmaniasis/en/ ) . Species of Leishmania are several causing different clinical manifestations of the infectious disease. L . donovani produces primary cutaneous disease as well as gives rise to visceral leishmaniasis (VL) and also post-kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis (PKDL) that is manifest after the treatment of the initial visceral disease. Visceral leishmaniasis main causative pathogen is the L. donovani complex with Old World VL disease being caused by the species L. donovani and L. infantum, and New World disease is mainly caused by different species of L. chagasi In the cases of infection caused by L. braziliensis complex, there is always a chance that the infection dissemination to mucosal region can occur to give rise to mucocutaneous leishmaniasis (MCL) (Herwaldt 1999 ) .",

Other reasons for Leishmania disease susceptibility are malnutrition, immunodefi ciency with HIV coinfection, and young age. The protection against invading pathogenic Leishmania protozoa and even the curative resolution of the disease is provided by Th1 cytokine response involving cytokine interferon gamma (IFN-\u03b3), interleukin (IL)-12, and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u03b1), whereas Th2 response cytokines IL-10, transforming (TGF)-\u03b2, and IL-4 have been implicated in increasing susceptibility to the disease in the experimental animals (Reed and Scott 1993 ; Sacks and Noben-Trauth 2002 ) . Nonhealing lesions and diffused lesions in CL have been implicated to Th2 response, while self-healing lesion has been associated with Th1 response (Melby et al. 1994 ) . However, in some situation IL-4 (a Th2 cytokine) has been implicated to induce IL-12 production and lead to Th1 cytokine response, and it has also been found in some cases that Th2 response occurs independent of IL-4 (Alexander and Bryson 2005 ; Mansueto et al. 2007 ). Leishmania infection is a complex infection depending on host factors as well as strain polymorphism. Leishmania mexicana cysteine proteases which target IL-12 that prevents Th1 protective response (Buxbaum et al. 2003 ) , while the Leishmania analogue of activated C kinase (LACK) from the Leishmania major induces Th2 response that leads to host parasitization (Kelly et al. 2003 ) . Polymorphism of L. braziliensis also affects disease outcomes (Cupolillo et al. 2003 ; Schriefer et al. 2004 ). PKDL is a complication arising after treatment of VL, affecting 50 % of VL patients in Sudan (study carried out in United Sudan) and also 5-10 % patients in India. PKDL has been found to be associated with increased levels of IL-10 (Zijlstra et al. 2003 ; Ganguly et al. 2008 ).",

            "text": "To deduce the genetic susceptibility of the Leishmania disease, experimental murine animal models along with clonal parasite line (to control environmental variable) have been used to fi nd the genes responsible for disease progression along with their human homologues of disease susceptibility (Handman et al. 2005 ) . First genes that were used to deduce from such analysis in murine model were NRAMP 1 and the H-2 locus had been implicated in L. donovani infection (Blackwell et al. 1980 ) . HLA class II antigen HLA-PQ3 is found to be associated with CL in Venezuela (Lara et al. 1991 ) and MCL in Brazil caused by L. braziliensis (Petzl-Erler et al. 1991 ) . PCR genotyping studies in Mexico on Leishmania patients has found an association with HLA class II genes with Cutaneous Leishmaniasis (CL) (Olivo-Diaz et al. 2004 ) . High blood TNF has been found to be associated with MCL (Castes et al. 1993 ) and acute VL (Barral-Netto et al. 1991a , b ) . A Venezuelan study has implicated that allele 2 of TNF-\u03b2 polymorphism with high risk of developing MCL caused L. braziliensis and higher frequency of allele 2 of TNF-\u03b1 polymorphism was also associated with MCL (Cabrera et al. 1995 ) . In Brazil by using family-based disequilibrium test analysis (TDT), investigation has shown that TNF polymorphism has been linked to L. chagasi infection (Karplus et al. 2002 ) . In asymptomatic patients having positive skin test, L. chagasi has been associated with TNF-1 allele of TNF-\u03b1 gene, while in case of symptomatic L. chagasi VL patients, TNF-2 allele is implicated. Due to parasite heterogeneity, this TNF polymorphism association has not been correlated to infection by other Leishmania species such as in L. infantum VL (Meddeb-Garnaoui et al. 2001 ) and L. major CL (Kamali-Sarvestani et al. 2006 ) . Variation in promoter of IL-4 and IFN-\u03b3 gene polymorphism has been found to be linked to L. major CL disease susceptibility and progression respectively in an Iranian study, while in a Sudanese VL patient study, IL-4 polymorphism has been shown to increase disease susceptibility (Mohamed et al. 2003 ) . Polymorphism in promoter region of IL-10 gene leads to higher IL-10 production which has been shown to increase the risk of having skin lesions during an infection of L. braziliensis (Salhi et al. 2008 ). IL-6 can diminish the high Th1 proinfl ammatory response that occurs when L. braziliensis CL progresses to MCL (Hatzigeorgiou et al. 1993 ; Bacellar et al. 2002 ) . IL-6 polymorphism plays an important role in the progression of L. braziliensis CL to MCL, and this fi nding is important since their genetic markers have high prognostic value (Castellucci et al. 2006 ) .",

            "text": "Drug treatments are not very effi cient in the treatment of leishmaniasis disease; more effective treatment regimes can be developed by thoroughly knowing the genetic factors that lead to disease progression. Thus, unnecessary drug use and adverse reaction can be avoided. As various genetic susceptibility studies have shown, cytokine response determines the disease progression in leishmaniasis. Role of IL-10 in pathogenesis of leishmaniasis is known and is well established, and IL-10 polymorphisms have shown to increase risk of lesions in L. braziliensis infection. In a study with L. guyanensis infected CL patients from French Guiana, high level of mRNA IL-10 within lesions leads to poor chemotherapy response and treatment failure (Bourreau et al. 2001 ) . It is hypothesized that IL-10 might be regulating the response to chemotherapy by blocking the Th1 response. The increased level of IL-10 has been linked to the active VL (Nylen and Sacks 2007 ) and PKDL (Saha et al. 2007 ) and also associated with persistent CL infection occurring from L. major (Melby et al. 1996 ) and L. mexicana (Louzir et al. 1998 ). Success of VL treatment with amphotericin B and the complete elimination of IL-10 are associated with one another (Saha et al. 2007 ). On the other hand, MCL is associated with low IL-10 receptor expression and low IL-10 secretion that decrease the ability for modulation of proinfl ammatory response (Faria et al. 2005 ) .",

Three billion people are at risk with 1-2 million deaths attributed to malaria each year ( www.who.int/topics/malaria/en/ ). Four species of protozoan parasite are involved from genus Plasmodium, i.e., P. falciparum , P. vivax , P. malariae, and P. ovale . These malaria-causing combination parasitic species occur in human population and occur in infected individuals (Gurarie et al. 2006 ) . In respect to prevalence, virulence, and multidrug resistance, P. falciparum has been a major cause of mortality and morbidity. P. falciparum accounts for about 80 % cases of malaria in Africa (Roca-Feltrer et al. 2008 ). Next to it is P. vivax which causes 100-300 million cases annually (Price et al. 2007 ).",

The drug regime is highly effi cacious and has reduced development to resistance. In cases of uncomplicated malaria, the ACT is being used in 88 countries by 2009. In the coming years, a number of patients including women and children will be brought under ACT therapy regime as per World Health Organization. Like the treatment of HIV and tuberculosis, combination therapy is now being used for malaria treatment too, which reduces resistance among the highly effi cacious drug the artemisinins which rapidly eliminate the parasite from blood and thus limit the number of parasites so that the other more bioavailable drugs given in combination act on the parasite. Unrelated mode of action of two or more combination drugs also reduces the chances of resistance (Yeung et al. 2004 ).",

Individuals with CYP2C8*3 genotype have no CYP2C8 enzymatic activity in vitro (Parikh et al. 2007 ).

The study from Burkina Faso and Ghana could not clearly establish the relation between drug efficacy and CYP2C8 genotype (Adjei et al. 2008 ) . Though the inactivated gene of CYP2C8 is not very high in population, estimates have shown that CYP2C8*2 and CYP2C8*3 occur in about 2.1 % of the population in Zanzibar, United Republic of Tanzania, which was about 30,000 patients of the total malarial patients ~100,000 (Cavaco et al. 2005 ) . In Ghana it was found that 1.5 % of the population has been estimated to have metabolic variants of CYP2C8.

Identifi cation of genes and mechanism is important for controlling the infection. Research has yielded the information regarding the gene responsible and underlying mechanism of action resistance of some drugs against P. falciparum and P. vivax . Chloroquine resistance (CQR) in P. falciparum has been linked to point mutation CQ resistance transporter gene (Pfcrt chromosome 7). The mutation Pfcrt -K76T is a reliable marker for CQR. While CQ-sensitive strain carries wild-type allele CVMNK , the variant CQR alleles are S agt VMNT (Asia, South America, Africa), S tct VMNT (South America), CVMNT (South America, Philippines), CVIET (Southeast Asia, Africa), and CVMET (Colombia). Another multidrug resistance gene ( pfmdr1 chromosome 5) is a parasite transporter gene. Polymorphism, point mutation, and copy number variation have been implicated in multi drug resistance. In different geographic regions, the pfmdr1 two mutant alleles have been reported, namely, 86Y_184Y_1034S_104N_1246D found mostly in Asia and Africa and 86N_184F_1034C_1042D_1246Y predominantly from South America (Valderramos and Fidock 2006 ) . The pfcrt-76 and pfmdr1-86Y mutations have been related jointly to contribute in giving rise to CQR phenotype in addition to other likely parasite genes (Hayton and Su 2004 ) .",

The aim to achieve global cooperation will go a long way to personalized malarial treatment as per population needs.

This has to be followed up by the next 4 months with isoniazid and rifampicin treatment. If the treatment is taken up with diligence and patient completes the whole drug course, then it has been reported that effi ciency of the treatment is very high with more than >95 % patients getting cured and relapse is in less than 5 % of patients (Menzies et al. 2009 ). Another advantage of multidrug treatment is that the treatment regime helps in treating different population of tubercle bacilli. For the last 20 years, knowledge from the fi eld of genetic molecular basis of drug treatment outcomes has helped us in the better management of and understanding of treatment effi ciency and of drug. The difference in drug response is found among different individuals of the population. The individual person tends to show similar type of response to tuberculosis drugs that do not change over time. Thus, in light of above observations, we say that there is a huge variation in drug response among individuals due to variation in genes involved in drug metabolism, drug transporters, and drug targets compared to minimal within-subject variation as found from studies. Further studies on drug response revealed that 20-95 % of variation in drug pharmacokinetics is due to genetic factors (Kalow et al. 1998 ). The sequence variation in drug-metabolizing enzymes, drug transporters, or drug targets leads to the variation in drug response among individuals (Evans and Relling 1999 ; Evans and Johnson 2001 ) . Some nongenetic factors such as nutrition organ function, age and other concomitant therapies, nature of disease, and drug interaction can also effect in drug response, but genetic determinant remains constant throughout the lifetime of the individual. Pharmacogenomics have played an important role in deciphering therapeutic effi cacy of drug metabolism and occurrence of adverse events. Though research is still being pursued to decipher the intricacies of how genetic differences play an important role in regard to clinical application of the drug however, through research we have gained information on the role of genetic polymorphism with respect to drug effi cacy for the treatment of tuberculosis. In this section we will discuss the knowledge we have gained through newer technologies in regard to different drugs being used for tuberculosis.",

This is formed by the transfer of acetyl group from the acetyl coenzyme A to acceptor amine leading to formation of an amide. Acetyl isoniazid combines with several other cellular compounds to give a variety of metabolites which do not have any antituberculosis activity. The level of acetylating isoniazid that will be subjected to during metabolism in the body determines the disease outcome. The level of bioavailability of the drugs determines whether the drug would be effective for elimination of the invading pathogen or toxic to the human body. Acetylation of isoniazid varies from individual to individual depending as per his or her genetic predisposition. Genetics determines the amount of active NAT2 enzyme that an individual expresses. The metabolism of isoniazid is catalyzed by NAT2 enzyme which takes place in liver or gut mucosa. Thus, the level of NAT2 gene expression is controlled by the type of polymorphism in NAT2 that particular individual carries. Thus, for the pharmacogenomic and personal medicine in effect to succeed, the dosage for the drugs that are metabolized by NAT2 should be tailor made as per the enzymatic activity depending upon the polymorphic variant (Roy et al. 2008 ) .",

The categorization has been based on the measure of capacity of NAT2 enzyme to acetylate isoniazid to acetyl isoniazid thus inactivating it. Here the rapid inactivators are those who have more concentration of active NAT2 enzymes than slow inactivators. Based on the new technologies, genotypic studies have led to further classifi cation depending upon enzymatic activity NAT2 variant as rapid acetylators, that is, the wild type gene which codes for the completely active enzyme. Rapid acetylators are highly active forms of the enzyme denoted by NAT2 * 4 allele. Patients harboring these alleles can tolerate conventional dosage of drug that is rapidly metabolized by NAT2 enzyme. Individuals who carry NAT2 heterozygous alleles where only one of the allele is active/functional should be administered lower than average drug (those are NAT2 metabolized) dosage to get an optimum effective drug response without adverse drug response. Mutations in NAT2 enzyme in human individuals designated as NAT2*5A , NAT2 * 5B , NAT2*6A, and several others which lead to rendering the NAT2 gene activity are termed as slow acetylators which can lead to diminished drug clearance and toxicity.",

In mongoloid populations like the Eskimos, Japanese, and the Chinese, slow acetylators are found in only 10 % of study subjects. In another study carried out in a population of 18 healthy Caucasian, there is variability in isoniazid clearance. While isoniazid preparation is responsible for only 2 % variation and body weight accounted for only 3 % variation in isoniazid clearance, the majority variation of 88 % in isoniazid clearance was due to NAT2 genotypes (Kinzig-Schippers et al. 2005 ) . Highactivity NAT2 allele-carrying individuals have higher isoniazid clearance. Other studies have shown that 4-6 times more isoniazid concentration in individual is carrying slow acetylator NAT2 genotype (Parkin et al. 1997 ) .

Peak isoniazid concentration to minimum inhibitory concentration ratio has been proposed to serve as a means to outcome tuberculosis treatment (Mitchison 1984 ) . Mean early bactericidal activity of isoniazid depends on its level in the plasma which in turn depends upon the variant NAT2 genotype carried by an individual. Comparatively the mean bacterial activity is lower in rapid acetylators than in the slow acetylators (Donald et al. 2004 ) . Therapeutic failure or relapse of infection is thus attributed to the lower plasma level due to rapid metabolism of isoniazid in rapid acetylator genotypes, while on other hand high level of isoniazid in slow acetylators may lead to the high level of toxicity (Weiner et al. 2003 ) . NAT2 allele genotyping of tuberculosis patients prior to the treatment with isoniazid is the way forward. Dosage adjustment of isoniazid could be carried out depending upon if the patient is harboring none, one, or two alleles NAT2 rapid acetylators.

The study compared isoniazid response between NAT2 slow and fast acetylators, and the study revealed that there is association with treatment response and bacteriological negativity (Selkon et al. 1961 ) . Tuberculosis treatment trials used dosage regimes of daily, twice weekly (Tuberculosis Research Centre Madras, study 1970 , 1973 , or three times weekly drug regimes (Ellard and Gammon 1976 ) . By means of controlled clinical trials, it was observed that using once a week uptake of isoniazid showed better clinical response to treatment compared to rapid acetylators, with cure rate of 20-35 %. It was postulated that metabolic status of isoniazid may have lesser clinical signifi cance for daily isoniazid treatment regime as compared to thrice weekly or twice weekly treatments. In slow acetylator individuals, the peak concentration of isoniazid was higher than rapid acetylators, and the level of isoniazid decreased more gradually. The effectiveness of a drug in tuberculosis treatment is determined in terms of coverage and the exposure. Coverage has been defi ned as the number of hours for which bacteriostatic concentration of isoniazid is (0.2 \u00b5g/ml) maintained in the blood, while exposure is defi ned as area under concentration time curve. Both parameters have been found to be signifi cantly greater in slow acetylators. Hence, in rapid acetylator individuals, there is a suboptimal concentration of isoniazid which leads to failure of once-weekly regime of isoniazid (Sarma et al. 1975 ) . Other studies using onceweekly isoniazid-rifapentine were compared with twice-weekly isoniazid-rifampicin; treatment also showed that in case of once-weekly treatment regimes, treatment outcome was poor and was associated with isoniazid acetylator status of the patients (Weiner et al. 2003 ) .",

Studies have shown that slow acetylators have higher peak isoniazid concentration, exposure, and half-life compared to rapid acetylators and healthy subjects ( Gurumurthy et al. 1992 ) . Hence, in the case of pulmonary tuberculosis patient also suffering from chronic renal failure, the isoniazid dosage should be administered based on their NAT2 genotypes status. In adult pulmonary patients, studies were carried out to determine correlation between isoniazid dosage and NAT2 genotypic and phenotypic status. Determination of isoniazid therapeutic dosage has shown that the fast acetylators need higher drug dosage to have an optimum positive treatment response. Fast acetylators tuberculosis patients when administered with 6 mg/kg isoniazid had similar exposure level as 3 mg/kg isoniazid administered to slow acetylators does (Donald et al. 2007 ).",

It has been deduced that level of mitochondrial oxygen species is reduced by the action of manganese superoxide dismutase (MSD). As the name suggests, MSD catalyzes the dismutation of superoxide into oxygen and hydrogen peroxide and is the fi rst line of defense against reactive oxygen species. Polymorphism in the MSD enzyme has been found in a study in the population in Taiwan, where genotypes having T > C polymorphism in codon 47 lead to variant amino acid valine in place of alanine which increases in risk associated with antituberculosis druginduced hepatotoxicity (Huang et al. 2007 ) . The presence of valine at codon 47 causes the increased activity in the enzyme manganese superoxide dismutase which leads to the accumulation of the toxic byproduct hydrogen peroxide which can cause hepatotoxicity.",

            "text": "Rifampicin has been proven to show concentration-dependent activity against M. tuberculosis and is a very important fi rst-line drug against tuberculosis (Ji et al. 1993 ; Jayaram et al. 2003 ) . Drug transporters P-glycoprotein and OATP1B transporters uptake rifampicin as a substrate and hence play an important role in distributing the drug throughout the body. The drug transporters are transcriptionally regulated by the nuclear receptors, i.e., pregnane X receptor and constitutive androstane receptor. The phenomenon variation in bioavailability of rifampicin among individuals in a population on administration of standard dosage has been subjected to investigation by the scientists. The pharmacokinetics of rifampicin depends upon the uptake of machinery of the cells in the body. It has been found that there is a relation between pharmacokinetics and polymorphisms of genes that is responsible for drug effl ux and infl ux. A study group of individuals suffering from tuberculosis who were categorize as per place of origin Africans versus non-Africans, it was observed that in drug transporter gene, SLCO1B1 463 C > A polymorphism leads to reduced rifampicin exposure and bioavailability (Weiner et al. 2010 ) . The people of African origin (black subjects) that carry SLCO1B1 463 C > A gene polymorphisms have been associated with more pronounced reduced rifampicin exposure compared to people from other races. The study thus showed for the very fi rst time that marked interindividual variation in rifampicin exposure can be attributed to SLCO1B1 polymorphism. Another study in South Africa has also highlighted that the variant allele of SLCO1B1 rs 4149032 polymorphism reduced the bioavailability of rifampicin in the body of the patients when present both in the homozygous and heterozygous states (Chigutsa et al. 2011 ). This fi nding has been attributed to the observation that there is about 21 % variability in drug clearance among the patients. Polymorphisms in the ABCB1 , PXR, and CAR genes have not been found to affect the pharmacokinetics of rifampicin in the patients in any signifi cant manner. Researchers have further predicted by means of stimulation that increasing the dosage of rifampicin in patients carrying SLCO1B1 rs 4149032 would increase the plasma availability of the drug and thus would have a positive impact on the treatment outcome. However, more studies needed to be carried out to know the exact association of SLCO1B1 gene polymorphisms between rifampicin bioavailability to provide an effective treatment regime.",

The discovery of induction of proinfl ammatory cytokine production was able to explain the infusion-related toxicity effect like nausea, fever, chills, and hypotension that are characteristics of this cytokine release.

Some of the shortcoming and the remedial measures have already been discovered in the previous sections. It has been found that even with high-throughput screening of number of drug, candidates have not been successful always (Payne et al. 2007 ). The fi eld of scientifi c research which has become all encompassing and interdisciplinary has added strength along the way and opened new avenues. The fi eld of biology is intertwined with structural biology and chemistry has given rise to the fi eld of medical structural genomics. The exact causes of failure of high-throughput screens have not been well defi ned. The fi eld of structure-based drug discovery has tried to overcome these limitations in the availability of chemical libraries and absence of structural information of many of the targets. The fi eld of structure-based drug discovery has its origin from the fi eld of X-ray crystallography and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) technology. With the availability of human genome sequences and pathogen genome sequence databases, the fi eld of structural genomics has gained importance, and hence over the past decade, more than 20 such projects have been taken up. The fi eld of structural biology has got a boost with the coming together of robotics and informatics in the biological research sphere (Haquin et al. 2008 ) . For the synthesis of an effective drug, by means of medical structural genomics, the protein which drug will affect should be well defi ned experimentally in both structure and functional aspects as the potential target. The protein should not only be well characterized structurally but also should be well defi ned as essential for the survival of the pathogen. Once drug and its protein target in a microorganism is identifi ed, the fi eld of medical structural genomics provides rapid mechanisms using high-throughput X-ray crystallography and NMR assay system to fi nd the ligand-bound structures. To identify such drug targets, it is very essential to know the complex host and pathogen interaction. The mode the pathogen uses to cause the infections is very diffi cult to elucidate and is a long process. The technologies of RNA interference and other gene knockout techniques should be complimented with experimental chemical biology approaches as microorganisms adopt multiple mechanisms for survival.",

Such efforts have already been carried out in the fi eld of protozoan pathogens. The program of Medical Structural Genomics of Protozoan Pathogens ( http://msgpp.org/description.shtml ) has been initiated to screen for drugs for ten protozoan diseases. The initiative has screening of thousands of potential antimalarial drugs against about 67 putative Plasmodium falciparum protein targets by expressing them in bacterial expression system in the laboratory and deciphering their 3D structures. Further, the com-pounds are assayed for their effectiveness in live organisms and further validated in appropriate disease model. The terms chemical validation and drugability are often used in conjunction in such cases. Drugability is meant to be used how tractable a given drug target is for the development of a drug candidate, while chemical validation means that drugs have been found to be active in live organism. Drugs which fulfi ll the abovementioned criteria are worth the effort, time, and resources.

In silico docking analysis from a small molecule library helped in selecting suitable compounds and molecules that had more affi nity for docking PBGS allosteric site and thus were subjected to testing in vitro . In one compound whose inhibition mechanism is species specifi c, conversion of PBGS octamers to hexamers was thus identifi ed (Lawrence et al. 2008 ) . The above fi ndings have led the way of targeting of oligomeric enzymes in pathogenic organism bacteria. Prime example is bacterial inorganic pyrophosphatases, which function as hexamer (Kankare et al. 1996 ) . On the other hand, the eukaryotic, cytosolic, and mitochondrial pyrophosphatases function as homodimers (Oksanen et al. 2007 ) and hence have different interfaces than its bacterial counterparts as evident from the study of evolutionary aspects of inorganic phosphatases. In this context the strategy has been to target the oligomeric state of the bacterial inorganic pyrophosphatase enzymes to inhibit their activity rather than their conserved active site (Sivula et al. 1999 ) . The technology has opened a novel pathway where more antibiotics can be developed.",

Structural genomic projects the world over have solved the structures of many proteins and have made the knowledge available for world community by submitting the structures to Protein Data Bank {PDB; http://www.wwpdb.org/ }. Worldwide Protein Data Bank is the site whose mission is to maintain a single protein structural public database which can be accessed by the global community (Berman et al. 2007 ) .",

The economic incentives of drug discovery are driving force for this secrecy, but in this process there are a lot of valuable data that are duplicated and lots of valuable resources and energy efforts. The learning process from failures and successes in pharmaceutical corporate sectors is never known to the scientifi c community, and a major loss is of most valuable time. Hence, as we can see, the drug discovery resources are not being adequately utilized across the academia and industry, so there is suggestion to have open-access industry-academia partnerships as possible mechanisms to overcome the problem. A frame work is need where both fi nancial and intellectual properties of the innovators are safeguarded when there structural data are deposited in the databases like PDB. A simple proposition would delay the release date of such structural data so that protection of intellectual property is feasible. Policies which can bring into the public domain structural data from the corporate world could only be possible by the concerted efforts of all stakeholders from industry, national, and international research funding agencies from all nations (Edwards et al. 2009 ).",

When the diseases are not controlled, then it would take a considerable toll of human health both in terms of mortality and morbidity. The life would be affected by emerging microbial disease-causing pathogen whatever the region, ethnicity, lifestyle, socioeconomic status, and ethnic background. Hence, the threat from infectious diseases is real and the situation is overtly challenging. The great advances in the genetics, genomics, and proteomics have the potential to take up the challenge in the coming decades. It is evident that these technologies have the potential to change the fi eld of diagnostics, treatment, and discovery of drugs and vaccines. The need of the hour is to strengthen the public health programs at both the national and the international levels to strengthen research in the fi eld of omics to fully realize the potential of scientifi c technologies that would usher in the era of pharmacogenomicbased personalized medicine.",
