Abdominal ultrasonography performed 2 months earlier by the referring veterinarian revealed abnormalities interpreted as intestinal inflammation and pancreatitis without peritoneal effusion. The ferret was treated symptomatically for diarrhoea and with glucocorticoids (Prednisolone 1 mg/day) for the suspected inflammation. After a transient improvement, the ferret showed an acute deterioration of body condition and neurological signs. On clinical presentation, the ferret was cachectic and was presented in lateral recumbency. Neurological status examination revealed postural reaction deficits in all four limbs. Spinal reflexes were intact. Pain sensation was present. The ferret had a depressed mental status and responded to noxious and auditory stimuli. There was no seizure activity. Cranial nerves were not altered: palpebral reflexes and pupillary light reflexes were both normal. These findings were consistent with a forebrain lesion.",

The ferret was placed in sternal recumbency and 0\u00b75-mm slices were acquired (120 kV, 100 mA) then reconstruction in a low spatial resolution (soft tissue) algorithm and high spatial resolution (bone) algorithm, before and after IV administration of iodine (Telebrix 35, Sodium Ioxithalamate, corresponding to 700 mg Iodine/kg). Post-contrast CT revealed a well-delimited ovoid plaque-like mass, with homogeneous contrast enhancement, extending from the rostral aspect of the olfactory bulb to the caudal aspect of the frontal lobe. The lesion appeared to be extraparenchymal, with a broad base against the bone, though an intraparenchymal location could not be excluded. The differential diagnosis included: extraparenchymal neoplasms (meningioma, lymphoma) and, less likely, intraparenchymal neoplasms (gliomas), inflammatory or infectious granuloma. Cisternal cerebrospinal fluid analysis was performed, although the ferret was given glucocorticoids for 2 months; it revealed no pleocytosis (266 RBC/mm 3 , 2 lymphocytes/mm 3 ). This result was more consistent with a neoplastic process, although an infectious disease (such as cryptococcosis) or an abscess could not be ruled out.",

Anaesthesia was induced intravenously with propofol (1\u00b75 mg/kg). The ferret was orally intubated and anaesthesia was maintained with isoflurane in oxygen diluted. A transfrontal craniectomy was performed, following the same procedure reported for dogs (Greco et al. 2006) . This allowed an incomplete excision of an ill-defined granular mass that appeared infiltrative within the cerebral parenchyma. Because the mass was not macroscopically consistent with a well-delimited tumour as expected, and because the remainder of the cerebral parenchyma appeared abnormal and the ferret had stopped responding to medical treatment, the owners were informed of the poor prognosis and elected for The clinicopathological characteristics of FSCD are remarkably similar to FIP in cats. The mean age at the time of diagnosis is 11 months (range 2-36 months) with most younger than 18 months (Garner et al. 2008) . No sex predilection is observed. All affected ferrets are from indoor environments with or without exposure to dogs and cats or other ferrets. Clinical signs reported in FSCD are non-specific, including diarrhoea, weight loss, lethargy, hyporexia (Garner et al. 2008 , Murray et al. 2010 , Dominguez et al. 2011 .

Only Murray (2010) and Garner (2008) described 12 ferrets with neurological signs including hind limb paresis, ataxia, tremors and seizures.

It is not clear whether the FSCV is derived Cerebral coronavirus granuloma in a ferret in ferrets with FSCD is still questionable. A new sensitive RT-PCR method was recently established by Terada (2014) to detect ferret coronaviruses in ferrets in Japan. The authors characterised genetically two genotypes of coronaviruses: type 1 causing FIP-like disease and type 2 causing epizootic catarrhal enteritis. Recently, the use of immunohistochemistry for detection of feline coronavirus within CSF macrophages permitted diagnosis of FIP in a cat (Ives et al. 2013) .
