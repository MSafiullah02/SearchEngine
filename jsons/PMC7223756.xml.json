            "text": "Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is a prevalent and zoonotic viral disease, caused by Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV) which is a tick-borne virus belongs to the Nairovirus genus of Bunyaviridae family. CCHF is widespread over a range of geographical area including Middle East, Asia, Africa and South-Eastern Europe with the mortality rate of 40% (Appannanavar and Mishra 2011; Zivcec et al. 2016). After Dengue, CCHFV is the second most prevalent arbovirus with significant medical importance (Ergonul 2006; Ergonul 2012; Bente et al. 2013). The CCHFV causes severe viral haemorrhagic fever outbreaks, with a case fatality rate of 10\u201340% (WHO reports 2013). In Pakistan, since 2000, 50\u201360 cases are reported annually (WHO reports 2013; Begum et al. 1970). CCHFV spread through Hyalomma tick, a vector responsible for viral transmission. CCHFV do not show symptoms in animals, while cause mild to highly fatal disease in humans (Bente et al. 2013). The infection is usually initiated by the skin lesions produced by the infected tick. After short-term incubation period (usually \u2264 7 days) non-specific symptoms of CCHFV are initiated, including high fever, faintness, chills, irritability, limb, head and spinal pains, which can last for 5\u201312 days. Moreover diarrhoea, vomiting, abdominal pain, thrombocytopenia, bradycardia and elevation of circulating enzymes of liver are some other recurrent side effects of CCHF. The hemorrhages like ecchymosis, epistaxis, cerebral, gingival, and gastrointestinal haemorrhages usually begin on the fourth day of infection. The liver turns to be swollen and painful. In current infections, aspiratory hemorrhages, neurological entanglements and blood loss leads to death. Distribution of intravascular coagulopathy, multi-organ failure and shock typically results in the fatal outcome (Burt et al. 1997; Saijo et al. 2010; Bente et al. 2013). Moreover, endothelial cells, mononuclear phagocytes and hepatocytes are the main cellular targets of infection. Ribavirin is the only available antiviral drug used for the treatment of CCHF which inhibit CCHFV replication cycle, however may cause neurological and hematological anomalies (Ergonul et al. 2006; Ergonul 2008). The viral load is prominent in blood during the initial stage of CCHF, thus it is expected that the transfer of antibodies against CCHFV can be an effective therapy (W\u00f6lfel et al. 2007), however use of monoclonal antibodies against CCHFV is still in its infancy.",

            "text": "CCHFV is pleomorphic virus (~ 90\u2013100 nm in diameter), consists of tripartite single-stranded negative-sense RNA genome (vRNA) which is composed of small (S), medium (M) and large (L) segments (Guo et al. 2012; Shtanko et al. 2014; Goedhals et al. 2015). This virion contains cell-membrane derived envelope (coated by mature glycoproteins) which contains genomic ribonucleoprotein complexes (RNPs) formed by vRNA, nucleoprotein and RdRp (Zivcec et al. 2016). The viral capsid is enveloped by 5 nm thick lipid bilayer and small projections (~ 5\u201310 nm long) are formed by the envelope proteins (Sanchez et al. 2002; Bergeron et al. 2007). The L segment is 11\u201314.4 kilobases in length which encodes RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and the nucleoprotein (NP). RdRp is required for mRNA and cRNA synthesis, necessary for translation and genome replication, respectively (Honig et al. 2004). The M segment is 4.4\u20136.3Kbs long which encodes envelope glycoproteins precursor (Zivcec et al. 2016) which is cleaved co-translationally by signal peptidase and then post-translationally modified into two structural trans-membrane glycoproteins (Gc and Gn), non-structural M protein (NSM), and secreted non-structural proteins (GP160, GP85 and GP38). These structural proteins form complexes on the surface of virion and assist in attachment to the host cell surface receptors, thus leads to fusion of viral envelope with the host membrane (Sanchez et al. 2002; Bergeron et al. 2007). The S segment is 1.7\u20132.1 kb in size, and encodes nucleocapsid protein which serves in the encapsidation of viral RNA (vRNA) and complimentary RNA (cRNA) during transcription and replication of genome. The mutation rates for the three parts of the genome were estimated to be: 1.09 \u00d7 10\u2212 4, 1.52 \u00d7 10\u2212 4 and 0.58 \u00d7 10\u2212 4 substitutions/site/year for the S, M, and L segments, respectively (Carter et al. 2012).",

Gn binds with ribonucleoproteins in vitro through its cytoplasmic tail that contains a zinc finger domain, implying that Gn may involve in genome packaging and has important role in viral assembly (Erickson et al. 2007). The Gn glycoprotein contains a 176 residue ectodomain followed by a 24 residues transmembrane region and terminates in a long cytoplasmic tail consisting of ~ 100 residues (Estrada and Guzman 2011; Strandin et al. 2013). Because of significant importance of Gn segment, designing a small molecule inhibitor against Gn segment could be a better approach to inhibit CCHFV. Due to lack of complete structure of Gn segment, we carried out its structural elucidation by in silico homology modeling. The generated model was used to identify novel drug like compounds against CCHFV by targeting Gn protein. Subsequently we performed ADMET profiling of the selected hits. This study has resulted in the discovery of novel scaffolds against CCHFV Gn protein.",

Therefore modeling of Gn segment was performed by threading based approach. For this purpose, I-TASSER server was used in which proteins models are developed based on the structural alignment of the selected templates, instead of sequence alignment and homology (percent identity). The best model (obtained by I-TASSER) was validated by Procheck Ramachandran plot to predict the stereochemical properties of the protein. The results were not accurate thus RaptorX server was used to predict the reliable structure. RaptorX use multiple templates threading protocol to build 3D model from single target sequence and the quality of the final model is improved by its ability to correct the errors partially in pairwise alignments and alignment coverage is also increased. The RaptorX generated model was again evaluated by Procheck, which showed good results. However RaptorX generated model possess several disordered loops, therefore, two loops starting from residues 38\u201396 and 274\u2013323 were separately modeled. After several attempts on these three servers, we obtained best model of region 38\u201396 and 274\u2013323 from ModBase and RaptorX, respectively. The structural properties of the predicted loops were evaluated and replaced in the 3D-model of Gn by Chimera. The binding site of Gn segment was predicted by COACH server (Yang et al. 2013) and by aligning the binding site with the 2L7X.",

            "text": "The 3D-structure of Gn protein was initially elucidated through I-TASSER, however the stereochemical properties of the obtained model was not good, thus we use RaptorX server for modeling. RaptorX built secondary and tertiary structures of query sequence by aligning it with the sequences of multiple templates and the quality of the predicted model is evaluated by p-value, Score, uGDT and GDT (Peng and Xu 2011; Ma et al. 2013). The 323 amino acid sequence of Gn glycoprotein of CCHFV was submitted to RaptorX to model the structure of Gn. The Gn model retrieved from RaptorX contains three domains, each domain was deduced by aligning one or more top matched template sequences present in the template library. The model is composed of an ectodomain (residue Ser1-Pro168), a transmembrane domain (residues Lys169-Leu206), a zinc finger cytoplasmic domain (residues Lys207-Glu278), and a cytoplasmic tail (residues Arg279-Ile323). The templates used to construct the model are 2L7X (Chain A) (Estrada and Guzman 2011), 5M87 (Chain A) (Ehrnstorfer et al. 2017), 2A65 (Chain A) (Yamashita et al. 2005) and 5G47 (Chain A) (Halldorsson et al. 2016). Alignment of the templates and the query sequence is depicted in Fig. 2. Properties of the templates are shown in Table 1. GDT and uGDT are the global distance test and unnormalized global distance test, respectively. The absolute model quality is measured by uGDT (GDT). If uGDT is > 50 then it is a good indicator for the protein having residues more than 100. GDT > 50 is a good indicator for the protein having residues < 100. Thus, if a good uGDT (> 50) is shown by a model but at the same time it has bad GDT (< 50) then it means that only a small portion of the protein model is good. The score indicate the alignment score that range from 0 to the domain sequence length while \u201c0\u201d score shows the results to be worst. Relative quality of the model is predicted by the p-value that should be < 10\u2212 3 and 10\u2212 4 for mainly \u03b1 and \u03b2 proteins, respectively. The majority of the domains consist of \u03b1 helix and none of the domains has p-value > 10\u2212 3 that shows the quality of model is good. The predicted structure of model is shown in Fig. 3. The structure of the model is composed of three domains and the best template was 5G47 (chain A). Overall uGDT (GDT) value of the predicted structure is 126 (39) in which the GDT value is 39 which is < 50 and uGDT value is 126 i.e., > 50. This indicates that the small portion of the whole model is good. The complete sequence was (100% residues) modeled by RaptorX, out of which only 17% residues were predicted as disorder, suggesting that the rest 87% residues are in ordered position. The ordered and disordered positions are depicted as blue and red bars in Fig. 4.",

The Ramachandran plot is shown in supporting information Fig. S1. The 3D-model predicted by RaptorX was composed of several loops (Fig. 3) hence two loops were modeled separately by different programs. Therefore, regions that contain > 50 residues were modeled again. Thus Gn (38\u201396) region was modeled by Modbase server using 5B0U (Chain A) as template with 53% identity with region 38\u201396. The model (38\u201396) showed that this loop is not composed of coils, but three anti-parallel \u03b2-sheets.

The region Gn (274\u2013323) was also modelled by RaptorX using 5UAK (Chain A), 5UAR (Chain A) and 4WAT (Chain A) as templates, and the resultant model shows that this region (274\u2013323) is composed of 68% helical part.

Among thirty seven hits, twelve compounds (22\u201325, 28\u201334 and 36) displayed high intestinal absorption in humans. The predicted acute toxicity in rat models showed that the compounds do not show lethality upto the concentration of 2 mol/Kg, hence we can say that these compounds are not lethal in lower doses and fall in the good range of median lethal dose (LD50). The ADMETsar server predicted the acute oral toxicity of all the compounds. According to the results, compound 31 fall in category II (50 mg/kg > LD50 < 500 mg/kg) and compound 13 and 19 fall in category IV (LD50 = \u2265 5000 mg/kg). However the rest of the compounds fall in class III (LD50 = > 500 mg/kg, \u2264 5000 mg/kg). The results indicate that the compounds do not show oral toxicity on doses up to 5000 mg/kg, thus the compounds are not orally toxic. The predicted metabolic profile of the compounds shows that which cytochrome p450 will act as substrate and non-substrate for the compound and which will be inhibited by the compound. The molecules with high AMES toxicity and high BBB permeability were excluded from selection. The final selected compounds with their respective ADMET properties are tabulated in Table 4.",

Though CCHFV belongs to Bunyaviridae family however comparing to other genera of this family, it shows some uncommon properties; for instance the length of the M-segment of CCHFV is a large precursor, comprised of 1684 amino acids and a remarkably large glycoprotein is encoded by this precursor protein. Another feature which distinguishes CCHFV from other genera is that its M-segment encoded glycoprotein precursor undergoes complex series of proteolysis before maturation while other viral glycoprotein undergoes proteolysis in a single step. Cysteine residues present in CCHFV glycoproteins indicate the complexity of its secondary structure due to presence of disulfide bonds (Bertolotti-Ciarlet et al. 2005; Altamura et al. 2007; Carter et al. 2012). Because of important role of Gn protein in viral assembly and localization, several researches have targeted this glycoprotein as a potent immunogen for vaccine development by using various expression systems (Saijo et al. 2010; Strandin et al. 2013; Buttigieg et al. 2014; Dowall et al. 2017; Wu et al. 2017).",

I-TASSER uses structural fragments of multiple templates to build the model as a result the generated model can have lower quality due to the presence of more torsion angles in their backbone. The complex and challenging proteins with less close homologous templates show such type of results (Ul-Haq et al. 2015). Since our target protein is complex, we tested RaptorX for its modeling. RaptorX server is usually used to construct models of those targets which have few close homologs by employing multiple template structure.

Nairoviruses possess dual CCHC type zinc fingers that form a globular domain by tightly associating with each other. The role of ZF\u2019s domain is the regulation of DNA and viral RNA (Strandin et al. 2013). Andes virus (ANDV) and CCHFV contains dual zinc fingers with similar structure. The only difference is that ANDV does not have the ability to bind with viral RNA while CCHFV binds with viral RNA (Altamura et al. 2007). The glycoproteins Gn and Gc belongs to type I membrane integral proteins and extend viral membrane, its N-terminal domain contact with outer environment and act as ectodomain while C-terminal points toward intraviral space. Bunyaviruses are different from other single stranded anti-sense RNA viruses because they lack protein which acts as scaffold between viral envelope and RNP components (matrix protein). However, viral Gn-CTs are large enough that they can accommodate domains and performs function like matrix protein. So, they can be assumed as substitutes of viral matrix protein (Strandin et al. 2013). The thrombocytopenia syndrome virus and Rift Valley fever virus belongs to the Phleboviruses genus of the bunyaviridae family, their Gn is also type-I integral membrane protein and its N-terminal act as ectodomain while C-terminal domain is transmembrane helical portion that is inserted in viral membrane (Wu et al. 2017). The CCHFV Gn model also depicts that its C-terminal is helical.",

The developed model is composed of an ectodomain (residue Ser1-Pro168), a transmembrane domain (residues Lys169-Leu206), a zinc finger cytoplasmic domain (residues Lys207-Glu278), and a cytoplasmic tail (residues Arg279-Ile323.) Several studies revealed that Gn of protein of virus from bunyaviridae family is involved in viral assembly. For example, alanine mutagenesis of the cytoplasmic tails of Uukuniemi virus and Bunyamwera virus affect the ability of virus-like particles to effectively incorporate ribonucleoproteins, thus intimating a role for Gn tails in genome packaging. More recently, the Gn tail of Puumala virus was shown to co-immunoprecipitate with the Puumala nucleocapsid protein.

            "text": "Drug designing is a complex process where computational tools help to foster this process in less time and automatic procedures. Due to high mutation rate of viral proteins, it is increasingly demanding to expedite the drug delivery against viral diseases. Computational medicinal chemistry is not only applied against human disease but also delivered several novel fungicides against plants diseases (Iftikhar et al. 2017). It is important to predict toxicity, ADME properties and potential activity of a drug like molecules prior to their biological testing in order to avoid drug failure. In the present study, these properties are identified by SwissADMET and ADMETsar. Virtual screening is computational searching of huge chemical space against targets. Previously structure based virtual screening was applied to identify the novel immunomodulators against human immune disorders (Halim et al. 2013) and several drugs like molecules were suggested against dengue virus to establish effective therapeutics (Halim et al. 2017). We believe that the predicted hits will be a valuable starting point to deliver drugs against congo virus.",

This study was conducted to explore computational resources to get insights into the inhibitory mechanism of CCHFV. Glycoprotein Gn of CCHFV has been exploited as an important drug target in this study because of its role in viral envelop binding. The zinc finger domain of this protein is available however complete three dimensional structure of this protein is not available. Thus threading based in silico modeling was employed to elucidate its complete structure which was used for the development of new drugs by structure based virtual screening of antiviral compounds. The computational analysis revealed that out of > 1300 compounds, thirty seven compounds were compatible with the binding site and are anticipated to block the activity of Gn in silico. The in silico predicted ADMET profile suggests that thirty compounds has safer pharmacokinetic properties and could be exploited as potential hits. The results need in vitro and in vivo experimental validation to confirm these results.",
