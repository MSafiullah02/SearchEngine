The observed mutation rate, strain variability, genetic selection during its interaction with the host population and transmission across the countries creates a challenging clinical scenario. As the virus race around the world, clues to how it is spreading and evolving can be inferred from analysis of available 1455 genomes (as on date 26.03.2020) on the GISAID (Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data) platform [3]. Phylogenetic inferences substantially suggest that SARS-CoV-2, originating in China, has now evolved into various variants which are specific to regions [3].",

Initially, substantial evidence to state the mutation rate in the novel SARS-CoV-2 from Wuhan city was lacking. However, a recent study from Iceland has highlighted that the virus has acquired more than 40 mutations, and the strains grouped into three different clusters [4]. The initial studies identified two major types of virulent SARS-CoV-2 circulating among the Chinese population and the prevalence of the aggressive form decreased after early January 2020, and the milder type has become common owing to selective pressure due to human intervention [5]. Thus, it is crucial to understand the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 across different temperate countries and populations. Interestingly, the spread of SARS-CoV-2 is limited, so far, in the countries which have a high rate of malaria incidences.",

The genomic epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 suggests that there is a molecular evolution of the variants which are supposedly endemic, making this pandemic more challenging to tackle. There is an urgent and prompt need to collect, collate and analyse data of every traveller reaching India from different parts of the world. Moreover, based on SARS-CoV-2 infected/carrier cases so far, the inferences should be drawn to develop the template for the massive epidemiological profiling of SARS-CoV-2 strain across the pan-India. Still, the question remains that once the strains find different host genotype does it remain the same genetically from where it has originated. GISAID analysis suggests that there are variation and influence of host on the primary sequence of the virus. Till date, two genomes available from India showed clustering closer to the strains prevalent in China [6]. However, a unique mutation (A930V (24351C > T)) in the spike surface glycoprotein of Indian SARS-CoV-2 genome which is absent in other strains from Wuhan, Italy, USA, and Nepal is reported [7], highlighting the possible host-dependent modification and the endemic evolution of SARS-CoV-2.",

Identifying the location-specific strain and along with its specific mutation would help in developing a cocktail of vaccine and the region-specific diagnostic tool for covering the demographic genetic diversity of SARS-CoV-2. Linking this data with the extent of human interaction and epidemiological parameter would be important to tackle the mass scale transmission. The gut microbiome has a role in immunomodulation and maintaining health status; hence, a plausible prophylactic treatment option based on a probiotic-based diet could be envisaged through comparative genomics and microbiome studies [8]. The genomics data suggests that a specific variant of a virus gets enriched within the specific demographic region. Hence, the experiences from the clinical intervention for that region should be considered in control and treatment strategies.",

Hence, a drug which delays the progression of infection would be an essential option for treatment for this pandemic while real cure emerges. Recently as a breakthrough treatment of the SARS-CoV-2 infected patients, chloroquine has tested as the potent preventive drug [9]. Chloroquine, an antimalaria agent, has been a widely used drug for decades [10] and has recently shown the apparent efficacy for treating the SARS-COV-2 associated pneumonia in clinical studies [11]. In some cases, other available antiviral drugs also have been tried in combination with chloroquine [12, 13]. With the challenges posed by this virus to address the pathogenesis and to intervene its multiplication cycles in a patient, the alternative medicine [14, 15] could suggest new bio-molecules.",

Is there any correlation between the mutation and virulence of the strain? Simultaneously, a comparative analysis could provide a clue to identify the sub-sequences related to the virulence and its evolutionary selection. In conclusion, the key points emerge from diversity and approach described in Fig. 1 that the generic tools and intervention measures for such eventualities need to be envisaged and planned at a global level.
