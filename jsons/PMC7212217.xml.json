Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) 2 is a homologue of ACE, but also a receptor for the coronaviruses [2]. ACE2 is highly expressed in the lungs, heart, gastrointestinal (GI) tract and kidney, thus affecting the cardiovascular system (CV) and the immune system [3]. The overexpression of ACE2 was reported to enhance viral entry and replication intracellularly [4]. COVID-19, also called SARS-CoV-2, may also use ACE2 as a receptor to initiate infection, leading to severe complications from the heart (acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and fulminant myocarditis), lungs (pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)) and GI tract (diarrhoea syndrome) [5].",

There are only a few animal studies available showing that statins may also increase ACE2 activity [8, 9]. In the era of the COVID-19 pandemic, such a drug effect may be considered as potentially worrying [10]. In this context, it was recently even suggested that ARBs could be replaced with ACE inhibitors and that statin treatment may be discontinued during the pandemic, particularly in primary prevention settings [11].",

Firstly, as the COVID-19 infection progresses, ACE2 is downregulated, thus potentially generating an inflammatory response leading to impaired cardiac contractility and acute lung injury [5, 7, 12]. Therefore, reduced ACE2 expression is linked to worse outcomes. On the other hand, ACE2 overexpression has been associated with several beneficial effects, i.e. prevention of adverse cardiac remodelling and fibrosis, improvement of vascular endothelial dysfunction, reduction of blood pressure, and protection from ARDS [7, 12]. Both statins and ARBs were reported to exert these benefits.",

Therefore, as well as immunomodulation, COVID-19 treatment should also target reduction of inflammation. In this context, statins have been consistently reported to exert immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory properties [20\u201330]. Also, it was previously suggested that statins could enhance host defence and suppress inflammation, thus representing a practical and inexpensive adjunctive or alternative host-directed treatment for infections by viruses, fungi, protozoa, and bacteria [31]. Similarly, there are data supporting an anti-inflammatory role for ARBs [32\u201334].",

It was show that for infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) coronavirus, drug-related cholesterol reduction disrupts lipid rafts (an important element for the cellular entry of coronavirus) that enable the binding of the coronavirus with the host cells and, consequently, further infection [42]. It was also observed, in the studies with porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV), that cholesterol present in the cell membrane and viral envelope (coronaviruses are positive-sense enveloped RNA viruses) contributes to PDCoV replication by acting as a key component in viral entry. Thus, the pharmacological sequestration of cellular or viral cholesterol with effective LLT significantly blocked both virus attachment and internalisation [43]. All these mechanisms might suggest a critical role of statins and LLTs in the inhibition of coronavirus infection.",

Indeed, we should do our best to maximally improve therapy adherence and thus have a better prognosis for the infected CVD patients [44, 45]. In this context, there are no premises that PCSK9 inhibitors, because they are monoclonal antibodies (in relation to the above-mentioned high cytokine storm during infection), should be discontinued. In contrast, PCSK9 inhibitors should be continued to achieve further low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) lowering (based on \u201cthe lower, the better\u201d principle), because then we might significantly stabilise atheroma plaque, reduce the risk of CVD events, and reduce inflammation [46\u201348]. Recent available data have confirmed the role of PCSK9 inhibition in reducing the process of inflammation via decreasing main vascular inflammatory markers, reducing infiltration of monocytes into the subendothelial layer, and inhibiting monocyte migration. Apart from the reduction of pro-inflammatory mediators, PCSK9 inhibitors could ameliorate vascular inflammation [47]. Finally, a direct local anti-inflammatory action of PCSK9 inhibitors, independent of LDL-C reduction, has been shown in animal models; however, it still merits further investigation [47, 48].",

In this context, simvastatin and lovastatin are contraindicated in patients on lopinavir/ritonavir therapy due to an increased risk of rhabdomyolysis [57]. Atorvastatin, rosuvastatin and other statins can be used at the lowest possible dose, based on the instructions included in the summary of product characteristics (spc) [58]. Taking this into account, we should be careful while treating COVID-19 disease patients with statins being on antiviral drugs and some antibiotics (including macrolides), because they might increase the risk of statin-associated muscle symptoms (SAMS) [59, 60]. Therefore, their careful monitoring is highly recommended to avoid unnecessary drug-related side effects, and at the same time optimising LLT therapy to achieve the individual\u2019s LDL-C goal. In this context, in patients at very high CVD risk, requiring intensive LLT, it is reasonable to initiate therapy with polypills/fixed combinations of statins (at lower doses) and ezetimibe, with or without PCSK9 inhibitors (as available), aimed at reducing the risk of SAMS [59, 60].",
