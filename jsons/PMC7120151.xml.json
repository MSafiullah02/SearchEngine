Aerosol transmission is unlikely as sneezing and coughing were not features of the syndrome and the spatial distribution of cases in the stables was not consistent with this form of spread (Baldock et al. 1996; Field et al. 2010).",

In the 1994 outbreak in Hendra, seven out of twenty horses apparently survived a lethal infection, and seroconverted before being euthanized (Murray et al. 1995) [refer to clarification]. In the 2008 Redlands outbreak, one horse survived for 42 days after clinical signs abated before being euthanized (Field et al. 2010).",

It most likely had close contact with HeV laden material from an infected horse, but was clinically well and remained so until it was euthanized in accordance with national policy2. Since this time, experimental infections in dogs have been conducted at the Australian Animal Health Laboratory, to better understand the role that dogs might play in the epidemiology of the disease. In these studies dogs could be reliably infected with HeV. Consistent with the field observation, few if any clinical signs were noted during the acute stage of infection. Viral shedding from the oral cavity occurred for a relatively short period of time, and oral secretions collected from dogs during this period were capable of transmitting infection to na\u00efve ferrets (Middleton 2013). Neutralising antibody titres generated in these dogs were similar to that observed in the single recorded canine field case of HeV infection. In dogs, the key site of virus replication within the oral cavity was the tonsil. Middleton (2013) concludes that it is feasible for Hendra virus to be transmitted to people from acutely infected dogs. Further studies are planned to test the repeatability of these observations as well as to assess the duration of the period of maximum transmission risk.",

Luckily for horses, these bat samples rarely contain high titres of virus. The risk of transmission to horses was found to be increased during pteropus bat reproductive periods (especially late pregnancy) and at times when the colonies were undergoing nutritional stress (such as during lactation), presumably leading to higher viral loads (Plowright et al. 2008; Breed et al. 2011). The reproductive cycle in other bat species has been linked to seropositivity and viral activity of other viruses including filoviruses, coronaviruses , lyssaviruses and astroviruses (Pourrut et al. 2007; Drexler et al. 2011; Turmelle et al. 2010).",

The virus spreads quite easily amongst bats, with the HeV seroprevalence in bat colonies fluctuating over time and geographical spread. In one bat colony, seroprevalence steadily increased from 45 to 69 % over a 2 year period supporting a model of endemic infection in the population (Breed et al. 2011). Absence of disease attributable to HeV infection is supported by experimental observations (Halpin et al. 2011). This is consistent with the observation that many viruses do not cause disease in their reservoir host. The long-term coexistence of viruses and their reservoir hosts has given co-evolution a good chance to reach a relative equilibrium (Domingo 2010). The theory of viral co-evolution with chiropteran hosts has been previously suggested, and all field observations and experimental evidence to date supports this (Halpin et al. 2007).",

Neutralizing antibodies to NiV were detected in Pteropus hypomenalus and Pteropus vampyrus during wildlife surveillance following the initial NiV outbreak in Malaysia in 1999, but NiV was not isolated at this time (Yob et al. 2001). The first NiV isolates from bats were obtained from colonies of Pteropus hypomenalus on Tioman Island, Malaysia (Chua et al. 2002). Since then, antibodies to NiV have been detected in other Pteropus species (Pteropus lylei, Pteropus giganteus) and less frequently in other species of bats including Hipposideros larvatus and Scotophiilus kuhli from Cambodia, Thailand, Indonesia, and Bangladesh (Hsu et al. 2004; Reynes et al. 2005; Sendow et al. 2006; Wacharapluesadee et al. 2005). In 2000, NiV was isolated from a urine sample collected underneath the roost of Pteropus lylei bats in Cambodia (Reynes et al. 2005). More recently, Nipah virus was isolated from Pteropus vampyrus in Malaysia (Sohayati et al. 2011). Serologic evidence of Nipah infection was also obtained from Rousettus leschen and Cynoptera sphinx in Vietnam (Hasebe et al. 2012). Several species of Chinese bats also contained antibodies to Nipah or Nipah-like viruses (Li et al. 2008). A very thorough study of the presence of henipaviruses in Australasia indicated that NiV was present in East Timor and that non-NiV, non-HeV henipaviruses were present in Sumba, Sulawesi, and possibly Papua New Guinea (Breed et al. 2013). The authors suggested that NiV can be detected in areas where Pteropus vampyrus is present. In Madagascar, seropositive Pteropus rufus and Eidolon dupreahum bats have been found, and 39 % of Eidolon helvum from Ghana had NiV reactive antibodies (Hayman et al. 2008; Iehle et al. 2007). Henipavirus-like sequences were obtained from Eidolon helvum in Ghana (Drexler et al. 2009). The detection of antibodies to and sequences of henipaviruses in African bats suggests that the range of potential NiV infections may be wider than previously thought, though no human cases of NiV have been reported from any region other than Southeast Asia.",

At the time, colic-like symptoms had never been associated with HeV infection in horses. The veterinarian came down with a flu-like illness, but recovered and to this day has neutralizing antibodies to the virus (Taylor et al. 2012). The next two people to become infected were a male veterinarian who had performed a nasal lavage on a horse which had respiratory symptoms, and the veterinary nurse who had assisted with the procedure (Playford et al. 2010). The veterinarian went on to die. The last person to become infected with Hendra virus was a male veterinarian who cared for a horse which was also diagnosed with Hendra virus (Field et al. 2010).",

However at this early stage of infection, the amount of viral genome detected was very low and it is unlikely that this would be enough to infect another host. The findings also supported the observation in experimentally infected pteropus bats that a local mucosal infection, from days two to approximately six post exposure precedes a systemic infection (Halpin et al. 2011). Only after the systemic infection has been established does it become possible to isolate infectious virus from urine and blood.",

Several routes of transmission of NiV from bats to humans have been identified by studying the nearly annual outbreaks in Bangladesh and the single outbreak in India. Consumption of contaminated date palm sap or contaminated fruit has been linked to a number of cases and outbreaks in Bangladesh (Rahman et al. 2012). Case-patients reported no history of physical contact with bats, though community members often reported seeing bats. Infrared camera photographs have shown that Pteropus bats frequently visited date palm trees in those communities where sap was collected for human consumption. This provided an opportunity for intervention in an attempt to prevent NiV spillover to humans. It has been shown that skirts (made from bamboo, dhoincha, jute stick and/or polythene) covering the sap producing areas of a tree effectively prevented bat-sap contact (Khan et al. 2012).",

Genotypes can be assigned based on the sequence of a 729 nucleotide window in the N-terminal region of the N gene ORF. Levels of nucleotide variation among full-length ORFs between genotypes M and B ranged from 6 to 9 % and between the complete genomes nucleotide variation is approximately 8 % (Lo et al. 2012).

Ephrin-B3 serves as an alternative receptor for NiV, but not HeV (Negrete et al. 2006). After receptor binding by the attachment protein, G, the fusion protein (F) which is cleaved to create two linked polypeptides, F1 and F2, fuses to the host cell membrane, initiating endocytosis (Wang et al. 2001). Following fusion between the viral envelope and the host cell membrane, the viral ribonucleocapsid is released into the cytoplasm (Lamb and Parks 2007). The polymerase complex composed of the polymerase (L) and phosphoprotein (P) initiates transcription of viral mRNAs. As translation of viral mRNA occurs, viral proteins accumulate in the cell, and the polymerase switches from transcription to genome replication.",

In a subset of 14 secondary patients who had well defined exposure to another case, the incubation period was 6\u201311 days (Luby et al. 2009b). In humans, NiV causes acute febrile encephalitis including fever, headache, drowsiness, dizziness, myalgia, and vomiting with reduced consciousness and evidence of brainstem involvement being a poor prognostic factor. Some patients with NiV initially present with pulmonary symptoms such as cough, atypical pneumonia and acute respiratory distress. The percentage of NiV patients presenting with respiratory disease was higher in Bangladesh (69 %) than in Malaysia (25 %) (Luby et al. 2009b; Tee et al. 2009). Some NiV cases experienced relapse of disease or late onset encephalitis after initial infection, which occurred on average approximately 8 months after initial infection (range: 9 days\u201422 months) and both syndromes have similar clinical manifestations (Goh et al. 2000; Tan et al. 2002; Tyler 2009). Upon post mortem examination viral antigen was found in the brains of patients with relapse and late onset encephalitis indicating viral replication took place in these tissues. Unlike acute NiV encephalitis cases, relapse and late onset encephalitis cases did not show vasculitis in the CNS (Tan and Chua 2008; Tan et al. 2002; Tyler 2009). A number of NiV infected individuals also experienced residual neurological symptoms that ranged from mild cognitive or cerebellar disabilities to more severe cognitive impairment, with some remaining in a vegetative state (Goh et al. 2000).",

However, any horse which is infected with Hendra virus poses a serious threat to all who come in contact with the animal, and this includes dogs , cats, ferrets and possibly other animals. This situation prompted the development of a vaccine for horses which was released at the end of 2012 (Broder et al. 2013). It remains to be seen what the uptake of this vaccine will be like, and how it will impact the epidemiology of the disease. A successful equine vaccination program has the potential to reverse the current trend of veterinarians exiting equine practice in HeV-endemic regions due to the perceived personal risk and workplace liability (Mendez et al. 2012).",

Additional studies are needed to determine the ecologic, environmental and epidemiologic circumstances that favor transmission of NiV and HeV from their natural reservoir host to humans and other domestic species.
