The prospective Observational Research in Childhood Infectious Diseases birth cohort study intensively evaluated the community-based epidemiology of respiratory viruses and bacteria during the first 2-years of life. Here we report the bacteriologic findings. Methods: Pregnant women in Brisbane, Australia were recruited between September 2010 and October 2012, and their healthy newborn children were followed for the first 2-years of life. Parents kept a daily symptom diary for the study child, collected a weekly anterior nose swab and completed an illness burden diary when their child met pre-defined illness criteria. Specimens were tested for respiratory bacteria by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays and those containing human genomic DNA, deemed as high-quality, were analyzed. Results: Altogether 8100 high-quality nasal swab specimens from 158 enrolled children were analyzed. Streptococcus pneumoniae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and Haemophilus influenzae were detected in 42.4%, 38.9%, and 14.8% of these samples, respectively. Concomitant detection of bacteria was common.

However, colonization is a highly dynamic process and most respiratory carriage studies in children are based upon cross-sectional samples in various patient populations or longitudinal studies of healthy children with infrequent sampling points.

Acquisition rate per child-year was estimated based on the definition of BDE using Poisson regression with the logarithm of individual study follow-up time as an offset. The time periods of consecutive positive swabs where the participant was not at risk of a new BDE were removed from the denominator when calculating acquisition rates. The univariable association between potential risk factors and bacterial detection was examined using mixed-effects logistic regression, taking into account the repeated measurements of the subjects through the use of an autoregressive model with lag one, that is, the previous sample result was included as a covariable.

A final multivariable model was constructed with age (in 4 categories), sex and the variables with consistent differences in univariable analysis (smoking, siblings, maternal education, childcare, season) included as covariables.

Nevertheless, the concomitant carriage was especially striking for H. influenzae, which was detected alone in only a very small proportion of samples. Meanwhile, B. pertussis and B. parapertussis are reported uncommonly in infants with ARI symptoms. 29 The incidence of B. pertussis and B. parapertussis infections in children aged <3-years in a large pertussis vaccine trial with active follow-up was 29 and 2.1 per 1000 personyears, respectively. 30,31 This was higher than the estimated national Australian incidence of 4 per 1000 person-years identified through passive surveillance, despite considerably increased reported cases since 2010 and adopting PCR for diagnosis. 32 Thus, having only 1-2 children with positive B. pertussis and B. parapertussis swabs, respectively, was not unexpected. Additionally, M. pneumoniae, C. pneumoniae, and S. negevensis occur more commonly in older children, 33,34 and large numbers of positive children in this age group were not anticipated.
