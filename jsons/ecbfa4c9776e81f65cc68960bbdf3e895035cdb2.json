A definitive diagnosis of vasculitis invariably requires histologic confirmation since there are no diagnostic clinical, imaging, or laboratory findings. A skin biopsy would provide information regarding the size of the involved vessels and the nature of the inflammatory infiltrate (neutrophils, lymphocytes, or histiocytes). The optimal time frame would be 24-48 hours after lesion onset. Vasculitis can be primary or secondary to drugs, infection, underlying systemic disease, or trauma.

The initial classification scheme was proposed by the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) in 1990 based mainly on clinical symptoms [1] . The subcommittee on Classification of Vasculitides analyzed 1000 consecutive patients with definitive vasculitis and proposed classification criteria for hypersensitivity vasculitis, Henoch-Schonlein purpura, Churg-Strauss syndrome, polyarteritis nodosa, Wegener granulomatosis, Takayasu arteritis, and giant cell arteritis (Table 7 .1) [1] [2] [3] . The criteria present in one type of vasculitis but absent or infrequent in the other types were excluded; thus, sensitivity and specificity were low for hypersensitivity vasculitis. In a recent series of 1095 patients with primary vasculitis and 415 with comparable diseases, using ACR criteria the sensitivity of each type of vasculitis has decreased although specificity remains high [4] . In 2010 the European League Against Rheumatism and Pediatric Rheumatology European Society have outlined consensus criteria for the classification of childhood vasculitis [5] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 243, "end": 246, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 586, "end": 589, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 590, "end": 593, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 594, "end": 597, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 986, "end": 989, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 1163, "end": 1166, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 573, "end": 581, "text": "(Table 7", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "The most widely adopted vasculitis classification is the Chapel Hill Consensus Conference (CHCC) nomenclature of systemic vasculitis which integrated clinical symptoms, histopathologic features, and laboratory findings [2] . This classification allows differentiation of immune complex-mediated vasculitis such as Henoch-Schonlein purpura and essential cryoglobuline-mic vasculitis from nonimmune complex ones. It also classifies vasculitides based on the size of the involved vessels: small vessel (<50 um), medium vessel (50-100 um) , and large vessel (>150 um) ( Fig. 7.1 ). However, classification by vessel size is imperfect due to overlapping vessel sizes. There is an overlap with arterial involvement since all three major categories of vasculitis can affect any artery size. While microscopic polyangiitis affects mainly the small vessels, polyarteritis nodosa involves medium-sized arteries. The criteria have been modified by the CHCC in 2012 (Table 7. 2) [1] [2] [3] . These criteria are for classification and they are not for diagnostic purposes. Recently several entities have been proposed to be included under the category of cutaneous single-organ vasculitis.

There is no gender predilection. They are located on the fingers, hands, elbows, ankles, and knees. EED often follows a chronic clinical course.

Early histopathologic changes of EED include leukocytoclastic vasculitis and a mixed dermal infiltrate containing neutrophils, histiocytes, lymphocytes, and eosinophils.
