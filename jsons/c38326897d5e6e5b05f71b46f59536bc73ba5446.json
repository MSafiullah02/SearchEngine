In the UK, the annual cost of the adverse effects of air pollution on human health is estimated to be about \u00a315 billion (Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA), 2010). Children and young people are particularly vulnerable to the effects of air pollution (Currie et al., 2013) because of its impact on physical and mental development which can cause health implications across the lifespan (Guerreiro et al., 2016) . Detrimental impacts from exposure to air pollution have been reported for early life health outcomes such as pregnancy outcomes (Rogers and Dunlop, 2006) , lung development and function (Portnov et al., 2009) , the central nervous system (Block and Calder\u00f3n-Garcidue\u00f1as, 2009) , life expectancy at birth, and infant mortality (Fotourehchi, 2016) . Furthermore, air pollution has also been reported to have adverse effects on mental development (Guxens and Sunyer, 2012) , language development (Calder\u00f3n-Garcidue\u00f1as et al., 2008) , attention and sensory perception (Wang et al., 2009) . Higher concentrations of NO 2 and PM 2.5 at the home location are thought to have both acute and irreversible effects on childhood cognition (Currie et al., 2014) . These early life health outcomes are also related to long-term outcomes including; labour force participation, productivity (Hanna and Oliva, 2015) , earnings (Currie et al., 2013) and poorer wellbeing and mental health.",

A plausible mechanism includes, interruption to learning/cognition due to asthma/hayfever related illness, resulting in a detrimental effect on educational outcomes. Air pollution has a negative impact on cognitive ability, including forgetfulness, inattentiveness and careless errors (Sunyer et al., 2017) which are important skills used in academic learning and examinations. Furthermore, exposure to air pollution has been negatively associated with school absences (Currie et al., 2009) . In Israel, a longitudinal study of 71,383 students reported that high levels of PM 2.5 were negatively associated with exam results (Lavy and Roth, 2014) . Children with asthma (Ruijsbroek et al., 2015) and/or hay fever (Bensnes, 2016) have been found to have poorer educational outcomes. To our knowledge, the combined effect of the modification of air pollution on school performance by asthma or SAR, has not been investigated previously, possibly due to a lack of data linkage across these different domains.",

We have linked air pollution estimates with temporally adjacent routinely collected health and education outcomes for each student. Routinely collected data are those that are collected for purposes other than research or without a specific research question (Benchimol et al., 2015) . We used these data in a temporal investigation to explore whether acute exposure to air pollution had an impact on educational outcomes, and if children treated for Asthma/SAR were impacted to a greater or lesser extent. Previous studies have investigated the effect of air pollution on cognition by collecting data from participants enrolled in small studies (Freire et al., 2010) ; however, these studies have been restricted to small numbers of participants. Another study used repeated outcome measures from a birth cohort and linked these to a census tract averaged air pollution risk measure at a single time point (Grineski et al., 2020) . Our study used a city-wide cohort of all students who sat General Certificate of Secondary Education (GCSE) examinations as a proxy for cognition. These examinations are taken by most students at the end of compulsory schooling in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland.",

Furthermore, our results do not necessarily support the assertion that air pollution impacts on cognition, because it is not clear how CPS is associated with cognition measured by standard instruments. However, poorer examination results have implications for future education and economic work life benefits (Bensnes, 2016) . It was not possible to adjust for curriculum changes, such as changes to the proportional contribution of coursework grades to final subject grades, or temporal changes associated with coursework deadlines. Similarly, it was not possible to identify if students had taken some exams early such as during the November or January examination series. We recommend education results are available on a per subject basis, to allow the examination of the effects of air pollution on specific learning outcome areas in future.",

The high spatial and temporal resolution of the data used in this study has allowed us to accurately represent the spatial and temporal patterns of pollution exposure variation to students and their outcome data. We also did not include noise pollution data or a proxy thereof. Noise data for Wales are currently modelled using traffic, railway and industrial area data for select regions of the study area at ad-hoc timepoints (Review of strategic noise maps in Wales, 2015) . The lack of consistent temporal or spatial coverage of these data meant we were not able to control for the effects of noise pollution from the perspective of the household/individual unit of analysis as used in our study.",

Our results highlight that the degree of residential area deprivation has a major and consistent impact on educational attainment across all models. Current UK policies to reduce air pollution are focused on economic and overall health improvement (DEFRA, 2020). Our results suggest that future analyses should be based on deprivation levels to improve our insights into the effects of air pollution. This would provide evidence to inform policies that improve air quality for the most deprived populations to reduce health inequalities (Chief Medical Officer, 2017) . The postponement of the introduction of the Clean Air Zones in the UK due to the COVID-19 pandemic (The Guardian, 2020) could be an opportunity to include a health inequality assessment in future policy (Whitehead, 2014 distribution. The effect of pollution on cognition by sex should be explored as males may be more affected by air pollution (Chen et al., 2017) .",

Alternatively, because are no equivalent cognition outcome data for the whole population at earlier ages, we instead recommend developmental and cognition outcome measures are collected from a representative sample using survey instruments following air pollution modelling (Gulliver et al., 2018) . High spatial and temporal modelled pollution data are not available routinely for all urban areas, however, we anticipate that these results will prove to be valuable, thereby encouraging additional urban area modelling. We recommend future work include data on emergency hospital admissions and attendances for respiratory conditions, which occurred too infrequently in the current single city study sample. These outcomes are not subject to treatment seeking behaviour. Utilising secondary healthcare data can be used as a measure of condition severity but also highlight temporal flares of conditions and associated temporal changes in air pollutant concentrations. Ultimately, current traffic reductions from the COVID-19 social isolation measures are likely to have improved air quality in many cities, although simultaneous disruptions to education means using attainment as an outcome is unfeasible.",

An indication of model accuracy is provided by comparison of modelled annual average NO 2 concentrations with measurements over a five-year period from around 50 diffusion tubes located across Cardiff. For each year these typically showed a fractional bias over all sites of about 0.05 corresponding to an underestimation of less than 2 \u00b5g/m 3 . Comparisons with measurements from one automatic reference monitor on Cardiff for NO 2 and PM showed a similar level of performance. We would expect the model predictions for O 3 to be similarly accurate given the model predictions of O 3 are based on measured rural values and the variations in O 3 across cities are strongly anti-correlated with NO 2 concentrations.",
