The polymerase domain of the NS5 protein has been targeted in other viral infections and is recognized as a suitable target in ZIKV infection. Different novel modified compounds against ZIKV NS5 have been tested in silico. A few structures have been solved for ZIKV polymerase and deposited in the protein data bank website. Two of these solved structures (with a resolution of less than 1.9 A) are used in this study to test the binding of 74 novel compounds in silico. Molecular docking is used to quantify the binding affinities of ZIKV polymerase and compare it to the hepatitis C virus NS5B. A total of 19 novel compounds revealed results that are either similar to or better than the physiological molecule, guanosine triphosphate. Water molecules are found to facilitate the binding of the compounds to ZIKV RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) structures. The presented 19 novel compounds represent good binders to ZIKV RdRp and could be suitable candidates for developing a new and effective anti-ZIKV polymerase nucleotide inhibitor.

            "text": "Seventy years ago, in Uganda, the Zika virus (ZIKV) was reported for the first time. 1, 2 About six decades later, newer incidents of emergence recorded in Nigeria, Senegal, and Gabon. [3] [4] [5] Despite its spread, the reported ZIKV infections were not like the latest emerging outbreak in the year 2015 in Latin America. 6 ZIKV is transmitted through body fluids and sexually. A direct link between newborn microcephaly and pregnant women infection was confirmed in the year 2016. [7] [8] [9] [10] Mosquito bites are the main route of spread of ZIKV infections along with sexual intercourse. 11, 12 The mild symptomatic ZIKV infection can be easily detected in body fluids like blood urine and saliva. 10, 13 Severe neurological diseases and sterility are reported in some patients as the virus targets all cells of the nervous system. 14 The ZIKV genome is a single-stranded RNA that encodes a 3400 amino acid polyprotein, which is processed by viral and host proteases to ten functional proteins. 15 The nonstructural 5 (NS5) protein is the most widely conserved protein and has been targeted in previous viral infections like hepatitis C virus (HCV). [16] [17] [18] The ZIKV RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) domain of the NS5 protein has been targeted by anti-HCV drugs (repurposing). 19 19, 23 Nucleotide inhibitors mimic the native nucleotides in their ability to selectively target the active site of NS5 to be added into the primer RNA strand. Once bound to the protein, nucleotide inhibitors block the polymerization process and cause protein inhibition. [24] [25] [26] Guanosine derivatives were studied against HCV polymerase and a candidate, IDX-184, was under the clinical trials phase IIb before this was halted due to a side effect in the year 2013. 18 This gave better results compared with the uridine derivative (sofosbuvir), adenine derivative (MK-0608), and the wide-range antiviral ribavirin against HCV and human coronaviruses in silico. 16, 18 Molecular modeling represents a successful method used to predict the drug/target binding potency and mode of interaction. Based on a suitable model, it can differentiate between active and inactive inhibitors and suggest new compounds (in silico screening). [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] A few solved structures have been deposited in the protein data bank recently for the ZIKV NS5 protein. [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] In this study, the author used two structures with PDB codes 5U04 and 5WZ3 as a drug target due to their appropriate resolution (1.9 and 1.8 \u00c5, respectively) compared with other solved structures of ZIKV NS5.",

These compounds have a better chance to bind to the active site of the polymerase upon its presence in solution with GTP, the parent, and physiological molecule.The amino acids involved in the binding of the top-ranked ligands to ZIKV polymerases are listed inTable 1. We can notice that the active site aspartates (D665 and D666) mediate the interaction in almost all binding trials. This supports the conservation of these residues in viral and even human polymerases.The ZIKV solved structure has water molecules surrounding the binding pocket. The author decided to perform the docking experiment without removing the water molecules as water may affect the binding of the hydrophilic ligands to the hydrophilic active site aspartates. Surprisingly, the number of water molecules that interact with the ligands varies from five (GTP, compound 5 in group II and compounds 3 and 4 of group III) up to 14 (compound 39 in group II). It has been reported that water mediates the dynamics of biomolecules.49 Figure 2 shows how the water molecule interacts in a network facilitating and supporting the binding of GTP into ZIKV NS5 RdRp.
