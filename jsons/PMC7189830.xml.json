While we all can be exposed to SARS-CoV-2, there are distinct subsets of the population who face a disproportionate burden of exposure to the virus. As with many other agents, occupational exposures are significantly higher than nonoccupational exposures [1]. Health-care workers, grocery/pharmacy/retail workers, sanitation workers, janitorial/cleaning staff, and delivery workers have increased likelihood of exposure. The built environment also plays an important role, as people who live in more crowded homes or buildings or more densely populated communities have an increased likelihood of exposure. Lower-income and minority populations are more likely to be both occupationally exposed and to live in higher-risk residential settings so are of heightened concern.",

For example, evaluating critical windows of exposure across the life course matters, and with this virus it is the elderly with the highest risk, a fact compounded by the fact that many are living in high-density senior housing. In addition, evaluation of co-exposures and mixtures have direct relevance. For example, air pollution influences many of the same health outcomes as SARS-CoV-2 and has been associated with higher COVID-19 mortality rates in recent studies [2, 3]. A history of exposures to cardiopulmonary toxicants in the environment or workplace may also increase severity of health outcomes. Evaluating the combined exposures to SARS-CoV-2, other respiratory toxicants, and socioeconomic vulnerabilities (e.g., food deserts, limited access to medical care) can help understand the relative contributions of different risk factors and direct mitigation efforts.",

Many of the recommendations for individual actions we can take to protect ourselves from SARS-CoV-2 are fundamentally grounded in basic principles of exposure science. Physical distancing is based on concepts of particle fate and transport. Decisions about using face masks and gloves hinge on the degree to which viruses can penetrate various materials, proper fit of personal protective equipment (PPE), and how PPE usage influences personal behaviors. Issues around ventilation of occupied areas and dermal contact of contaminated surfaces in conjunction with hand-to-face behavior are also informing discussions around exposure reduction.",

Exposure scientists can communicate to the public the potential benefits of control strategies by placing them in context of the hierarchy of controls (Fig. 1). Elimination of the virus is challenging, and until we have a vaccine, this can only be achieved by isolating oneself; substitution of usual behaviors with different ones will reduce exposures. Engineering controls, which aim to reduce or remove the hazard, can be achieved by inactivating SARS-CoV-2 with disinfectants like soap and alcohol. Administrative controls, like social distancing in the workplace and limiting building occupancy, can also be used to minimize risk. PPE is the \u201clast resort\u201d\u2014the option we use when the exposure cannot be managed from an engineering, technological, or administrative approach, and contact with the agent cannot be avoided. Hence, recommendations to wear a mask when one cannot remain 6 feet from others, such as at a grocery store, is highly advisable.",

People do not need to hear what the 95% confidence interval is for a viral exposure dropping by a given percentage as a function of distance. They need to be told to stay 6 feet apart. They do not need data on dominant exposure pathways given frequency of hand-to-face activity. They need to be told not to touch their faces. In addition, when communicating with the public, explaining the \u201chow\u201d of each control strategy is just as important as the \u201cwhy\u201d.
