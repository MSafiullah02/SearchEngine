            "text": "Chest radiography is generally the most important test for establishing the diagnosis of pneumonia. Although it is clear that many chest radiographs are performed unnecessarily on patients with upper respiratory tract infections or bronchitis, it is difficult to identify a set of specific criteria to direct test ordering that is better than the clinical judgment of an experienced physician [5]. Routine chest radiography for all patients who present with cough is not necessary but may be reserved for patients without a history of asthma who have other suggestive findings (eg, fever, tachycardia, decreased oxygen saturation, or focal abnormality on lung examination) [6]. Among patients who are suspected of having pneumonia, these clinical findings have been prospectively validated and are better predictors of a radiographic infiltrate than physician judgment [7]. Patients with serious underlying disease or severe sepsis/septic shock in whom hospitalization is considered should have a chest radiograph performed. CT of the chest seems to be more sensitive than plain radiography for detecting the presence of pulmonary consolidation, although the natural history and clinical significance of CT-positive, plain radiograph-negative pneumonia are not clear [8]. CT may play a role in evaluating for other pulmonary diagnoses that may mimic pneumonia, such as pulmonary emboli, and may further delineate the nature of the pneumonia, such as in the case of necrotizing infection associated with community-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (CA-MRSA).",

Chest radiography should be performed subsequently if there is a poor initial response to treatment. Routine performance of chest radiography for patients with exacerbation of chronic bronchitis or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is of low yield and may be limited to patients with other signs of infection or congestive failure [9]. Studies of infants with fever show that routine chest radiography is of low yield in the absence of other symptoms or signs of lower respiratory tract infection (eg, cough, rales, or elevated respiratory rate) [10], [11]. One study found that leukocytosis was associated with occult pneumonia in children [12], but it is not clear whether identifying these cases has any clinical significance [13].",

Although the finding of a white blood cell (WBC) count of more than 15,000/mm3 increases the probability of the patient having a pyogenic bacterial origin rather than a viral or atypical origin, this finding depends on the stage of the illness and is neither sensitive nor specific enough to aid decisions regarding therapy in an individual patient. A WBC count may be helpful if it reveals evidence of immunosuppression, such as neutropenia or lymphopenia, which may indicate immunosuppression from AIDS. Serum lactate dehydrogenase may be helpful in evaluating possible Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) in patients known or suspected to have HIV infection. Several rapid HIV tests are available that may be helpful in this situation [17]. Although CD4 counts usually cannot be obtained within the time frame of an ED visit, total lymphocyte count of less than 1000/mm3 predicts a higher likelihood of CD4 count less than 200/mm3\n[18]. When suspicion exists for severe sepsis/septic shock, serum chemistry and coagulation studies may be helpful in evaluating patients for metabolic acidosis, renal and hepatic dysfunction, and disseminated intravascular coagulation. In the absence fluid-unresponsive hypotension, elevated arterial and central venous lactic acid levels also may indicate the need for early and aggressive hemodynamic resuscitation and broader empirical antibiotic therapy.",

Although it is preferred to obtain pleural fluid specimen as early as possible, because of time constraints it is not always possible to perform diagnostic thoracentesis in every patient with pleural effusion in the ED. For most patients, thoracentesis can be deferred until after hospital admission. Patients in significant respiratory distress or with evidence of tension and mediastinal shift require emergent diagnostic and therapeutic thoracentesis, however. Assessment of respiratory function with pulse oximetry is important in the evaluation of patients with pneumonia. Because clinical assessment of oxygenation can be inaccurate [3], a pulse oximetry reading should be obtained in any patient suspected of having pneumonia in the ED\u2014and ideally upon ED triage.

This differentiation is somewhat artificial; a clear differentiation between these two types of pneumonia on clinical grounds alone is impossible, and coinfection can occur. Factors studied prospectively and found not to be more frequent with atypical pneumonias than with pyogenic bacterial etiologies include gradual onset, viral prodrome, absence of rigors, nonproductive cough, lower degree of fever, absence of pleurisy, absence of consolidation, low leukocyte count, and an ill-defined infiltrate on chest radiograph [19].",

A patient with a history of intravenous drug use and plain chest radiograph with multiple focal infiltrates consistent with septic emboli should be suspected of having endocarditis, which is usually caused by S aureus (including MRSA).

Induction of sputum without adequate isolation facilities can put patients and staff at risk if sputum is induced from persons with unrecognized TB. Correlation between identification of pneumococcus on Gram stain and sputum culture results is poor, even when commonly used criteria for an adequate sputum specimen (less than five squamous epithelial cells and >25 WBC/high power field) are applied.

With a high proportion of S pneumoniae strains resistant to penicillin, most physicians would not choose to treat a patient with penicillin even if a well-done sputum Gram stain revealed a predominance of gram-positive diplococci. The most recent Infectious Disease Society of America/American Thoracic Society (IDSA/ATS) consensus guidelines suggest that more aggressive diagnostic testing can be reserved for the more seriously ill patients. If sputum Gram stain and culture are considered, they should be reserved for the subset of patients with more serious illness (eg, admitted to the intensive care unit [ICU]), in whom the bacteriologic diagnosis is highly uncertain and for whom it is felt that the outcome may depend on optimal antimicrobial therapy.

In one prospective study of 760 patients with CAP, a change of antibiotic therapy based on blood cultures may have improved clinical outcome in only three cases (0.4%) [26]. Blood cultures should be obtained in seriously ill patients; if drawn, they should be obtained before the initiation of antibiotics (although antibiotics should not be delayed for this reason). When results are positive, blood cultures reflect the etiologic agent more accurately than sputum cultures but still only uncommonly lead to a rational change in antimicrobial therapy. Bacteremia occurs in approximately 25% to 30% of hospitalized pneumococcal pneumonia cases, but the diagnosis and therapy are usually well established before blood culture results are available.",

The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services still include a quality measure for obtaining blood cultures for patients admitted or transferred to the ICU within 24 hours of hospital arrival [30]. Unfortunately, it is often not possible to predict later transfer to ICU when a patient is admitted from the ED. Infectious disease consultants who see the minority of patients who deteriorate after initial treatment in the hospital may criticize the lack of blood cultures obtained on admission. Perspective from these occasional cases should not lead to a conclusion that all patients admitted with pneumonia need blood cultures. Blood cultures obtained from patients who do not show signs of serious infection at the time of ED evaluation are of lower yield and often give false-positive results (ie, contaminants). The follow-up of false-positive blood culture results can be costly and labor intensive and may lead to unnecessary use of agents such as vancomycin or linezolid when results are initially reported as gram-positive cocci in clusters.",

It is more difficult to identify patients who do not require these interventions initially but may be at greater risk for deterioration and require a level of monitoring that may be beyond what is available on the typical hospital ward. Up to 45% of patients with CAP who ultimately require ICU admission are initially admitted to a non-ICU setting [41]. Transfer to the ICU for delayed onset of respiratory failure or septic shock is associated with increased mortality [42]. Defining \u201csevere\u201d pneumonia also has implications for empiric antimicrobial selection. Most studies of \u201csevere\u201d pneumonia have simply defined it as pneumonia in a patient admitted to the ICU. Objective criteria using the PSI (class V) and CURB-65 have been proposed but have not been prospectively validated for the ICU admission decision. When these criteria were retrospectively studied in a cohort of CAP patients, they did not perform better than actual physician decisions [43]. The 2007 IDSA/ATS guidelines include criteria for defining severe CAP that are based on ATS minor criteria and CURB variables (\nTable 3) [1]. They recommend that either of the two major criteria is an indication for ICU admission and that presence of at least three minor criteria would indicate a need for ICU admission. They also acknowledge that prospective validation of these criteria is needed.",

It is important to recognize that this practice comes with a cost that may put other patients at higher risk for morbidity and mortality, however. Many ICUs in US hospitals are operating at capacity or near capacity, and seriously ill patients are spending more time boarding in EDs when no beds are available. ED overcrowding has adverse impacts that include ambulance diversions and longer transport times, longer waiting times for patients (some of whom have serious illness that cannot be recognized until they are evaluated by a physician), and lower overall quality of care [44]. Transfer of a deteriorating patient to the ICU from the hospital ward is not necessarily a failure.

This policy was largely based on a 2004 study that showed that administration of antimicrobial agents within 4 hours of hospital arrival was associated with lower mortality and reduced length of stay for Medicare patients over age 65 [57]. For various reasons, many facilities have had difficulty meeting this standard in a high proportion of patients. EDs in many US cities face critical overcrowding issues, and patients with pneumonia who do not appear seriously ill at triage may spend hours in the waiting room before evaluation. Because the \u201cclock starts ticking\u201d when the patient arrives at triage, the 4-hour time limit may pass by the time a patient is evaluated by a physician. The diagnosis of pneumonia is not always straightforward, and even minimal diagnostic testing in the ED may put a patient beyond the 4-hour window. Much like the problem of retrospective judgment, case reviews based on the final hospital diagnosis of pneumonia are biased toward overestimating therapeutic delays of patients who initially appear to have other conditions, such as congestive heart failure [58], [59]. Some facilities have even resorted to a policy of giving antibiotics upon arrival for any patient with respiratory complaints that might be possibly caused by pneumonia. This strategy may improve compliance with the standard but obviously leads to many patients receiving unnecessary antibiotics [60], [61].",

            "text": "CA-MRSA has rapidly emerged as the most common pathogen isolated in community-acquired skin and soft-tissue infections [63] and is increasingly recognized as a cause of CAP. CA-MRSA pneumonia typically presents as a severe, rapidly progressing pneumonia with sepsis, often in children or healthy young adults [20]. Antimicrobial agents with consistent in vitro activity against CA-MRSA isolates include vancomycin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, daptomycin, tigecycline, and linezolid. Optimal therapy for MRSA is a subject of current debate in light of increasing minimum inhibitory concentrations for vancomycin [64], [65]. Post hoc subgroup analysis of clinical trials for health care\u2013associated pneumonia found that linezolid treatment in the subgroups found to have MRSA was associated with improved survival compared with vancomycin [66]. Prospective trials are ongoing to determine whether a difference truly exists. Daptomycin is inactivated by pulmonary surfactant, so it would not be appropriate for empiric therapy of pneumonia. Although it is not necessary to provide empiric coverage of MRSA for all pneumonia cases, it should be strongly considered for patients with severe pneumonia associated with sepsis, especially persons with concurrent influenza, contact with someone infected with MRSA, or radiographic evidence of necrotizing pneumonia.",

Depending on their level of activity, comorbid conditions, history of prior antibiotic use, and hospitalization, these patients are at increased risk for infection with resistant organisms such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, K pneumoniae (including strains producing extended spectrum \u03b2-lactamases), Acinetobacter species, and hospital-associated strains of MRSA. Other risk factors for infection with multidrug-resistant pathogens include (1) hospitalization for 2 or more days in an acute care facility within 90 days of infection, (2) attending a hemodialysis clinic, and (3) receiving intravenous antibiotic therapy, chemotherapy, or wound care within 30 days of infection. Any patient with pneumonia that fulfills any of these historical features, including patients from a nursing home or long-term care facility, is designated as having health care\u2013associated pneumonia, which is associated with a greater likelihood of resistant pathogens, such as Pseudomonas and MRSA. Mortality is also higher than with CAP [67]. It is appropriate to give broader spectrum empiric therapy to patients with health care\u2013associated pneumonia, usually with a combination of antimicrobial agents to increase the chance that at least one antibiotic is active against the causative pathogen. Appropriate combinations include an antipseudomonal \u03b2-lactam agent, such as piperacillin/tazobactam, cefepime, imipenem or meropenem, combined with either an aminoglycoside or a fluoroquinolone and vancomycin or linezolid to cover for MRSA [68].",

Because of the potential toxicity of sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim (TMP/SMX), empiric treatment with this agent for well-appearing outpatients with a low probability of PCP is generally not recommended. An empiric trial of a macrolide may be indicated for treatment of mild CAP in a patient at low risk for PCP (eg, recent CD4 count >350/mm3). Any deterioration on outpatient oral antibiotics should prompt admission for a more extensive evaluation. Some emergency physicians initiate oral outpatient therapy with TMP/SMX or an alternate drug for patients with a high probability of PCP and favorable clinical parameters, but this should only be done if a patient can be followed closely for continued diagnostic evaluation and observation for toxicity. It is best done in consultation with the patient's continuing care physician.",

Certain patients also might be brought back to the ED for follow-up in 24 hours, either in person or by telephone. An outpatient regimen of an oral respiratory fluoroquinolone is another option that may be advantageous for moderately ill patients who are considered borderline for hospitalization.

Most patients who have pneumonia and present to the ED can be safely discharged home on empiric oral antimicrobial agents with minimal diagnostic testing. Emergency physicians must be skilled at identifying patients who may require more extensive diagnostic testing, have severe sepsis/septic shock, are at risk for opportunistic infections such as PCP, and for whom empiric therapy should be expanded to cover less common organisms, such as CA-MRSA. Empiric antibiotics should be initiated in the ED, but using arbitrary time cutoffs for initiating antibiotics as a quality measure for patients ultimately diagnosed as having pneumonia is problematic. Decisions regarding hospital admission and level of care are central to emergency medicine practice and can be aided with prognostic models. It is also important to initiate infection control measures in the ED when appropriate.",
