Although not unique in this respect, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a recent example. Within a matter of weeks in early 2003, SARS spread from the Guangdong province of China to rapidly infect individuals in some 37 countries around the world (Wang & Jolly, 2004). The first case of SARS outside China was reported on 26 February 2003. By 31 May the number of probable cases reached 8359, with the mortality rate outside China climbing to around 14%. However, from June this increase slowed sharply, and by July the number of probable cases had climbed by just 89 cases, to 8448, with a total of 774 deaths (http://sarsreference.com).",

However, although SARS eventually infected some 10,000 individuals, killing around 1000, it did not lead to the devastating health impact that many feared. Rather, what was unique about SARS was the disproportionate economic impact.",

These costs were distributed across a wide range of sectors\u2014although principally travel and tourism\u2014and countries, leading to a far higher economic shock than expected given the health impact (Barreto, 2003; Blendon & Benson, 2004). The rather disproportionate scale and nature of this economic shock has caused concern that outbreaks of more serious disease\u2014such as a flu pandemic\u2014could have a catastrophic effect on the global economy (Nesmith, 2003). Understanding the factors that led to this impact of SARS might help deal with the possible repercussions and management of other infectious disease outbreaks.",

            "text": "Perhaps most significant of these factors is the perception, communication and management of the risk presented by SARS, which is the subject of this paper. In considering this, it is important to locate the analysis with respect to the two broad models of risk used in the social sciences. The first is the \u2018realist\u2019 approach, where risk is seen as an objective threat or danger that can be measured independently of the social context within which it occurs (Kahneman, Slovic, & Tversky, 1982). The second is the \u2018social constructionist\u2019 approach, which sees risk as a threat or danger that is constructed through social and cultural processes, and cannot be demonstrated to be independent of such processes (Joffe, 2003; Lupton, 1999; Washer, 2006). The latter is increasingly seen as a key conceptualisation; indeed, the term \u2018risk society\u2019 has been coined to describe the apparent perception of the post-industrial post-modern society as being at constant \u2018risk\u2019 of something, from credit-card fraud to terrorist attack (Beck, 1992). Although this has been challenged in some cases (e.g. Kitzinger & Reilly, 1997), what is important in this conceptualisation is not necessarily that populations are in permanently heightened states of anxiety, but how populations develop defence mechanisms to control their anxiety (Joffe, 1999). In this paper a more \u2018material-discursive\u2019 position is adopted that views both conceptualisations as having some validity; that a \u2018risk\u2019 contains both a materially measurable element of the probability of an event, and a socially constructed element of how that probability/event is perceived by the individual and society (Yardley, 1997). In this way a contrast can be seen through the examination of the impact of SARS between what is understood from a realist perspective (the materially measurable probability of, for instance, infection with SARS, various outcomes of infection and the effectiveness of different strategies to prevent infection) versus the social constructed perception of those probabilities as \u2018risk\u2019.",

            "text": "Although the direct costs of an epidemic on the health service can be substantial, the indirect costs on other sectors of the economy may be more significant (Smith, Yago, Millar, & Coast, 2005). SARS certainly demonstrated this (Chou et al., 2004; Fan, 2003; Hanna & Huang, 2004; Lee & McKibbin, 2004; Smith & Sommers, 2003; Wen et al., 2004). The indirect costs of an epidemic are driven almost solely by the public's perception of the risk of becoming infected, and the risks associated with the different consequences of that infection. A disease that is thought to be spread by direct contact with infectious cases is likely to lead to reductions in unnecessary contact (Lau et al., 2005). Where individuals feel some \u2018control\u2019 over their exposure to infection, such as HIV, this reduction may be more limited (Blendon & Benson, 2004). However, in cases where perceived control is less, such as with SARS, there is likely to be a fall in demand, particularly for tourism, transport, retail sales and leisure activities, as individuals avoid contact with others. Countries in which these sectors of the economy are relatively important are going to be most affected. The fear of the disease spreading through international travel can also lead to an additional reduction in economic activities in unaffected countries. Uncertainty over the future course of the epidemic, and its impact on demand, reduces confidence in the affected economies, leading to further possible reductions in investment (Edmunds & Gay, 2006).",

Second, there was considerable uncertainty about the degree of effectiveness of specific interventions or measures to reduce the likelihood or consequences of infection (Lau et al., 2005). These are consistent with the \u2018dread\u2019 factors highlighted in discussions of risk perception (Slovic, 1987). Although as time progressed levels of \u2018dread\u2019 were reduced, initially all that was known about SARS was that it was transmissible directly via the airborne route, infection had a high case-fatality ratio of around 10% and there were no vaccines or specific therapeutics. This created widespread public anxiety that then translated in to a severe economic impact (Lau et al., 2005).",

This includes the mode of transmission, incubation period, timing, duration and degree of infectiousness, age group most affected and age structure and contact behaviour of the population. Uncertainties surround these factors, especially at the beginning of an outbreak. In retrospect, although SARS was transmitted primarily through the respiratory route it usually did not behave as a highly infectious agent and certain parameters facilitated its containment through traditional public health interventions. These parameters included the lack of pre-symptomatic transmission, a low level of infectivity at the onset of illness, and that transmission was primarily through respiratory droplets and occurred primarily in healthcare or household settings involving close person to person contact (with the important exceptions of Hotel M. and Amoy Gardens in Hong Kong (Tomlinson & Cockram, 2003)). In addition, although the reproductive number for cases was approximately three its serial interval was relatively long at 8\u201310 days between onset of symptoms in one person and onset of symptoms in the next person in the chain of transmission. These factors made it relatively easy to reduce transmission by promptly isolating cases, quarantining close contacts, and introducing and enforcing infection control and hygiene measures (Lipsitch, Cohen, & Cooper, 2003; Lipsitch et al., 2003; Pang, Zhu, & Xu, 2003; Riley, Fraser, & Donnelly, 2003; Svoboda, Henry, & Shulman, 2004; WHO (2003a), WHO (2003b)). However, it is also the case that for these public health measures to be effective, the acceptance of, and compliance with, them by the public was critical which may not always be the case. For example, there has been some research on the H7N7 avian influenza outbreak in the Netherlands in 2003 that suggests that compliance with preventive measures in that context was very low (Stegeman et al., 2004).",

Knowledge of how a certain behaviour change might affect the course of the epidemic, and what its possible economic impact would be, would help decision-makers give appropriate advice. Thus, quantifying the behavioural changes that might be expected in the face of different threats would significantly help improve both epidemiological and economic forecasting (Blendon & Benson, 2004). Similarly, understanding the relative importance of risk perception in influencing behavioural change, compared with other factors, such as knowledge, attitude and perceived effectiveness of protection measures, would also help in the management of infectious disease outbreaks.",

Recently, this debate has included work related to SARS. Muzzatti (2005), for instance, demonstrates how such threats to public health are manufactured by the media and how these threats draw upon past and present cultural myths of dangerous \u2018others\u2019, and in so doing contribute to unwarranted public fear, intolerance, and distrust. Wallis & Nerlich (2005) explore the metaphorical framing of infectious disease reporting, finding that SARS was unusual as militaristic language was largely absent. Bergeron & Sanchez (2005), in a survey of Canadian undergraduate students, conclude that the Canadian media communicated conflicting messages and confusion to the public. Overall, the general consensus is that the media coverage of SARS was excessive, sometimes inaccurate, and sensationalist (Rezza, Marino, Farchi, & Taranto, 2004).",

Indeed, Razum, Becher, Kapaun, and Junghanss (2003) predicted that within two years every citizen of Hong Kong would be infected with SARS. However, phase two soon occurs, which stresses that this, still relatively abstract, threat is happening in a geographically and/or culturally distant population, that containment of the threat will therefore occur through \u2018othering\u2019, and that the promise of medical progress will soon diminish the threat (Douglas, 1992).",

Washer (2004) found that the media represented SARS as a dangerous threat to the UK, whilst simultaneously suggesting that this threat had been \u2018contained\u2019\u2014that SARS was unlikely to affect the British as it had the Chinese, as the Chinese are so \u2018different\u2019. In this sense, the media can contribute to stigmatisation and discrimination, which in the case of SARS was evident against those with an Asian appearance (Chang, 2003; Person et al., 2004). This resonates with the presentation by the media of outbreaks of other infectious disease in previous years, such as Ebola (Joffe & Haarhoff, 2002). Important, however, is Washer's view that the combination of infectious diseases, and re-emerging infections, in recent years has reduced the confidence of the British populace in the ability of Western medicine to successfully \u2018conquer\u2019 infectious disease. If Washer is correct, this reduction in faith in modern medicine may heighten the perception of risk in future years, and thus emerge as an increasingly significant factor in the management of future infectious disease outbreaks. However, it is worth noting that at present the impact of this is a moot point, as the success of traditional public health measures in the case of SARS may, alternatively, contribute to a strengthening of the confidence in Western medicine.",

More specifically, the war in Iraq had only just commenced when SARS began to make an impact. Second was the rapid geographic spread of an unclassified disease; SARS was a \u2018mystery\u2019 disease, with the aura of being able to strike anyone, anywhere, anytime. The relatively high case-fatality rate, methods of transmission, novelty of the disease and uncertainty over identification and control of the disease all contributed to public alarm, whether they were directly affected by SARS or not.

The WHO deserves credit for initiating and coordinating this international response, through the GOARN, as do those involved in this network (Heymann & Rodier, 2004). In the future it is to be expected that this network will be strengthened, in the light of the SARS experience, but also recent concerns over bioterrorism, and have the capacity to respond to outbreaks of a greater magnitude than SARS. Further, the recent upturn in efforts to prepare for possible bioterror attacks should encompass and enrich strategies for dealing with infectious disease. Afterall, one does not generally know at the outset of an outbreak whether it is one that is natural or manmade and, in either case, a robust and prepared system will be required to rapidly and effectively respond to contain disease spread and impact (McFee, Leikin, & Kiernan, 2004).",

First, a change in attitude from emergency responsiveness to preventive preparedness is needed, as part of a more holistic and strategic approach to planning for infectious disease outbreaks. By definition, emergencies offer a limited timeframe for taking action, and would thus benefit from a clear chain of command, strong coordination among relevant institutions, and strong political leadership. Clarity of responsibility, authority and accountability during outbreaks, from local to the global levels, is imperative for effective action. This includes institutions beyond the health sector, such as transportation, immigration, communications, finance, water and sanitation, defence, housing and education. When multiple sectors are involved, when there is scientific uncertainty, and when the timeframe is urgent, political leadership becomes especially important.",

Given the nature of public health emergencies, in terms of timeframe, potential unknowns and geographic reach, this decision making process can be complex and highly challenging. Yet the effectiveness of the emergency response can ultimately hinge on the quality of decision-making. For example, during the SARS outbreak there were different ways of organising health controls for incoming passengers in the EU which had a negative effect on the trust placed by the public on the responsible official bodies. Such reductions in trust \u2018make a suspicious public sceptical of official health warnings\u2019 (Pickles & Goodwin, 2006; p. 11). Effective decision-making is characterised by such features as timeliness, accuracy, appropriateness, feasibility and clarity of purpose and message. It is therefore essential to reflect on how decision-making can best be carried out during public health emergencies.",

A fuller and wider account of macroeconomic costs will underpin a more strategic approach to decision making, and contribute to more informed decisions that are taken proactively, rather than reactively, prior to and during emergencies. Although macroeconomic modelling of health issues is very novel, with only a few applications (e.g. Lee & McKibbin, 2004; Smith et al., 2005), a current European Union Framework 6 project is developing this approach, using the case of SARS (http://icadc.cordis.lu/fep-cgi/srchidadb?CALLER=FP6_PROJ&ACTION=D&RCN=73835&DOC=5&CAT=PROJ&QUERY=1).

For example, taking isolation and quarantine, there needs to be consideration of the level of transparency with which such policies are enacted and enforced, proportionality in the imposition of these policies compared with the benefits they offer and the assurance of a safe and habitable environment for persons subject to these measures (Gostin, Bayer, & Fairchild, 2003).",

However, the constant coverage by the press, and the manner with which some of the travel advisories were handled, were linked by some to \u2018over reaction\u2019 (Gatehouse, 2003; Hurst, 2003; Lam & Hong, 2003).

In this respect, a concrete development could be to invest in epidemiological and economic modelling. Indeed, there has been a recent call for the development of such an integrated epidemiological and economic modelling approach, stemming directly from the SARS outbreak (Smith, Drager, & Hardimann, 2006). Key in this development will be the integration of the impact of risk perception upon actions by actors (population, government, nations and so forth), and the effect of different strategies on this perception, and hence action. At present little is known about how uncertainty concerning the outbreak in question, or its level of risk, affects behavioural response. For instance, how do people determine their own risk of exposure? How does this perceived risk affect behaviour?

Research shows that some hazards or events deemed by experts as presenting a low risk become the focus of social and political concern, or amplification (Department of Health, 2003). In other cases, where experts perceive there to be a high risk, there can sometimes be insufficient social or political concern, or attenuation (Sandman 2004). An understanding of what drives the perception of risk is therefore sorely needed.",
