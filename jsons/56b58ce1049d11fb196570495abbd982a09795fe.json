This satellite complex has a separate access and separate dressing rooms and 3 independent surgical rooms. Each room has an anteroom, usually used for anesthesia induction, which, in this case, will be used as a scrub room, and an exit room, leading to an outside corridor. This is usually designated as a dirty corridor, from which waste, biological materials, and surgical instruments are taken out of the OR but, in this situation, will be used as an exit room for the surgical staff.",

However, ORs are usually designed to have positive pressure to reduce intraoperative contamination, and it is not easy to reverse-engineer it. Given that coronaviruses are approximately 0.125 mm (125 nm) in diameter 7 and that a very high proportion of particles (up to 100%) in this size range are captured by high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters 8 , it is reasonable to assume that placing a portable HEPA filtration system with a high frequency of air changes rapidly reduces the viral load within the OR without increasing the risk of disseminating the virus.",

The respirator should be placed at this time. As recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and by the U.S. National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases (NCIRD), Division of Viral Diseases, on March 14, 2020, an FFP2 or N95 respirator should be used. These have been shown to be effective for particles within the size range of bacteria and viruses including the coronavirus 4, 9 . Although some centers may want to use surgical OR diagram and workflow. 2020 helmets (popular among arthroplasty surgeons), their efficiency for the filtration of submicrometer-sized particles is inadequate to use them as respirators and they should not be used alone for protection as they do not eliminate the need for a respirator. This is unlike powered air-purifying respirators (PAPRs), which draw ambient air through a HEPA filter 10 . After correct adjustment and sealing of the respirator, protective glasses (or a face shield) and a surgeon's hood should be placed. 1. Sterile procedure (surgeon or scrub nurse): When appropriate, the first act should be to place a lead garment (apron, thyroid shield). Then either surgical space suits and helmets or a second layer of sterile protective garments can be used. In the latter case, a disposable surgical cap should be placed (over the hood), as well as a surgical mask with a shield. The surgical mask with a shield is an alternative to the face shield, which is not readily available at our institution. After this step, surgical hand scrubbing with an aqueous alcohol solution should be performed, and the first pair of surgical gloves should be put on. Finally, a sterile, disposable, reinforced surgical gown, followed by the second pair of gloves and by surgical sleeve protectors, should be put on. Figures 3-A and   3 -B illustrate how the surgeon or scrub nurse should be dressed when exiting the anteroom to the OR. 2. Nonsterile procedure (e.g., for patient positioning or fracture traction and reduction): Most often, in trauma or orthopaedic surgical procedures, there is a need to position the patient prior to the surgical procedure and to place traction to reduce fractures (e.g., proximal hip fractures). For these procedures (as for the circulating nurse and other nonsurgical staff in the OR), wearing proper PPE is also required, but the PPE does not need to be sterile. As such, after entering the anteroom, a lead garment should be donned (when required), followed by a disposable surgical cap and nonsterile gloves. Although long-sleeved gloves may be worn, this is not currently recommended by the CDC 11 . Figures 4-A and 4 12 ) should be donned and the staff can then enter the OR. After a procedure such as helping to position the patient or reducing the fracture, if the surgeon needs to scrub in to a surgical procedure, he or she has to complete the exit process: remove the nonsterile surgical cap, gown, and gloves in the OR; and then exit through the exit room and return to the anteroom to complete the hand scrubbing and to put on sterile protective garments, as described previously for the sterile procedure.",
