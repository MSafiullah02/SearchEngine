It is unclear from the current literature if patients with ARDS have increased risk of physical, mental or cognitive disability as a result of the use of ECMO for refractory hypoxaemia [18]. Given the worldwide expansion in the use of ECMO since the H1N1 influenza A pandemic in 2009, there is an urgent need to determine the long-term outcomes in survivors [19]. Decreased long-term quality of life after ECMO could potentially be due to the severity of the disease, the ECMO complications or both. In a recent study of ARDS survivors from France, survivors who received ECMO as a rescue therapy had lower HRQoL compared to a French age- and sex-matched general population at one year but not lower than age- and sex-matched survivors of severe ARDS who were not treated with ECMO [18].",

Normative individual age- and sex-matched Australian population data were used for comparison with transformed domain and component summary scores [27].

They also displayed reduced mental wellbeing with their SF-36 mental component score 27% lower than normal. This was more pronounced in the patients with ARDS resulting from H1N1, compared to patients with ARDS pneumonia, and may be caused by the systemic effects of H1N1 virus, rather than differences in ICU management, such as the use of sedatives. This indicates frequent psychological distress and social and role disability due to emotional problems. ARDS survivors have been previously described as having considerable challenges, including reduced exercise capacity, cognitive dysfunction and depression or post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) [31-33].",

It is unclear why our cohort would have reduced energy or inability to maintain social relationships compared to other survivors of ARDS. Importantly, only half of this young cohort had returned to work and a quarter of them had returned to previous work levels. Previous studies have reported an important functional association with survivors of ARDS that have moderate-severe depression symptoms and are less likely to have returned to work compared to those with less severe symptoms [34]. Depression has been reported in up to 50% of ICU survivors 12 months after discharge [35]. Psychiatric screening is also very important to assess depression and PTSD, which is prevalent in ICU survivors [2,29]. However, compared with the French H1N1 cohort who received ECMO [18], our patients who received ECMO had reduced HRQoL in both domains of vitality and social function at a median of 8 months follow-up. The study by Luyt et al. (2012)[18] found no difference between survivors of severe H1N1 who received ECMO and those who did not when assessed at 12 months after the stay in ICU. This important question needs to be further addressed in an Australian population comparing survivors of ARDS who do or do not receive ECMO at the same time point.",

When compared with the UK ECMO study [17] this difference was not accounted for by illness severity (Apache II, lowest PaO2/FiO2 ratio on day 1), nor patient age, which were similar in both series (Table 4). It may have been accounted for by the much higher incidence of influenza A pneumonia in our cohort but when the 56 patients with H1N1 pneumonia from the UK ECMO study were separately analysed, the mortality was still significantly higher than in our cohort (27.5 versus 14.0%) [36]. Several factors that may have accounted for better outcomes included increased management of viral pneumonitis due to the H1N1 epidemic, improved ambulance retrieval service, the ECMO technology, including ultrasound-guided percutaneous ECMO cannulation, intensivist-driven care from retrieval to decannulation and extensive ECMO experience (10 years) at the center.",

In particular, most of this cohort did not return to previous work, which may contribute to their poor social function and is different to other reports of ECMO survivors [18]. ICU outpatient review of these patients may be required to address functional limitations in survivors. While ECMO survivors had reduced HRQoL, it remains unclear whether the complications of ECMO played a role in this outcome. Future prospective studies are required to confirm these findings and are planned as part of a multi-center trial investigating outcomes of survival of ARDS patients receiving ECMO.",

First, our major limitation is the small number of included patients, despite collection during a viral pandemic, which limits the external validity of the results. Second, owing to the nature of the pandemic, there were no injury-matched controls (young, previously well patients without co-morbidities all received ECMO as a rescue therapy if they were severely hypoxemic). Third, the data set was examined retrospectively, and therefore the follow-up period for HRQoL was variable, which limits the comparison to other studies. Fourth, there is limited information on the issues contributing to a decrease in HRQoL as a result of the telephone interview process, with no in-person follow-up, although previous work examining telephone interviews has shown that the response rate is improved but patients may report more favourable health ratings [40]. Finally, we aimed to compare our results to international data that have inherent differences in the structure and provision of the ECMO service, or the management of ARDS, which may confound the results. Future work in this area, where possible, should include larger numbers with a comparator group without ECMO from the same population.",
