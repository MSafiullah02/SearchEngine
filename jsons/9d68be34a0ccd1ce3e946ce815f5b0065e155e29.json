Thirty-six day-old female Holstein calves with a birth weight of 43.4 \u00b1 5.5 kg were randomly assigned to a treatment group and a control group. On day 1, all calves received one portion (3 kg) of colostrum within 2 h after birth. Between the second feeding and the age of 5 days, control calves received only transition milk that had been collected from dams shortly before feeding, and the treatment group received 1.5 kg of colostrum collected from dams on day 1 and 1.5 kg of transition milk from subsequent milkings. Monthly body weight and average daily gain were used to measure growth performance. Blood samples were collected from the jugular vein at multiple time points to evaluate the biochemical and immune status of calves. Colostrum-supplemented transition milk increased the concentrations of serum immunoglobulins, triacylglycerols, cholesterol and total protein. The activity of lactate-dehydrogenase and ceruloplasmin decreased, whereas lysozyme activity increased with time in the control group. It can be concluded that additional five days of colostrum feeding positively influences non-specific humoral immunity indicators and serum biochemical parameters in dairy calves.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "High morbidity and mortality rates of calves can cause significant economic loss and reduce the profitability of milk production (Raboisson et al., 2016) . Thus, proper calf management and rearing are important considerations in livestock production. Newborn calves are agammaglobulinemic and susceptible to infection. To prevent health problems, calves acquire immunity from colostrum which is a natural source of immune factors and nutrients (Godden, 2008; Raboisson et al., 2016; Torsein et al., 2011) . In this paper, colostrum will be defined as a secretion collected from the first milking, while milk from subsequent milkings is referred to as \"transition milk\".", "cite_spans": [{"start": 129, "end": 153, "text": "(Raboisson et al., 2016)", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}, {"start": 444, "end": 458, "text": "(Godden, 2008;", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 459, "end": 482, "text": "Raboisson et al., 2016;", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}, {"start": 483, "end": 504, "text": "Torsein et al., 2011)", "ref_id": "BIBREF48"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "It has been suggested that calves should be fed only high-quality colostrum containing at least 50 g/L of immunoglobulins (IgG) (McGuirk and Collins, 2004) . However, IgG concentrations in bovine colostrum can vary. Several factors have been shown to affect IgG concentrations in colostrum, including parity, breed, age, the metabolic status of dam, and the length of the dry period (Gomez and Chamorro, 2017; Morin et al., 2010; Quigley et al., 2013; Weaver et al., 2000) . Inadequate colostrum intake and its poor quality can result in the failure of passive transfer (FPT) which is a commonly encountered problem whose causes and consequences have been well documented (Beam et al., 2009; Chigerwe et al., 2008; Furman-Fr\u0105tczak et al., 2011) . FPT is diagnosed when IgG serum concentrations drop below 10 g/L during the first 24 h after birth. Serum IgG levels higher than 10 g/L point to successful passive transfer of immunity. In calves, morbidity and mortality are minimized when IgG serum levels exceed 16 g/L (Godden, 2008; G\u00fcng\u00f6r et al., 2004) . Immunoglobulins are absorbed most effectively during the first 24 h postpartum; therefore, calves should receive 2 to 4 L of colostrum during the first feeding within the first 6 h postpartum. Importantly, the volume offered to the calf should depend on the quality of colostrum. Ideally, the portion should provide at least 200 g of IgG, which is regarded as sufficient for reaching IgG serum concentration higher than 10 g/L (Raboisson et al., 2016; Vasseur et al., 2010) . Additionally, colostrum contains more vital ingredients such as maternal leukocytes, growth factors, hormones, cytokines and nonspecific antimicrobial factors (Ontsouka et al., 2016) . These immunological and biochemical components also protect agammaglobulinemic calves and support the establishment and development of the gut microbiome (Barrington and Parrish, 2001; Godden, 2008; Gomez and Chamorro, 2017) . Despite the benefits of colostrum, artificial feeding (for example, with the use of an oroesophageal tube) is the method of choice in calves that experience problems with colostrum drinking to prevent FPT (Godden, 2008) . Therefore, in this study, we hypothesized that the supplementation of transition milk with colostrum could improve the immune status and blood biochemical parameters of calves and, consequently, their growth performance.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 128, "end": 155, "text": "(McGuirk and Collins, 2004)", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 383, "end": 409, "text": "(Gomez and Chamorro, 2017;", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 410, "end": 429, "text": "Morin et al., 2010;", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 430, "end": 451, "text": "Quigley et al., 2013;", "ref_id": "BIBREF38"}, {"start": 452, "end": 472, "text": "Weaver et al., 2000)", "ref_id": "BIBREF51"}, {"start": 672, "end": 691, "text": "(Beam et al., 2009;", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 692, "end": 714, "text": "Chigerwe et al., 2008;", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 715, "end": 744, "text": "Furman-Fr\u0105tczak et al., 2011)", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 1018, "end": 1032, "text": "(Godden, 2008;", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 1033, "end": 1053, "text": "G\u00fcng\u00f6r et al., 2004)", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 1483, "end": 1507, "text": "(Raboisson et al., 2016;", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}, {"start": 1508, "end": 1529, "text": "Vasseur et al., 2010)", "ref_id": "BIBREF49"}, {"start": 1691, "end": 1714, "text": "(Ontsouka et al., 2016)", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}, {"start": 1871, "end": 1901, "text": "(Barrington and Parrish, 2001;", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1902, "end": 1915, "text": "Godden, 2008;", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 1916, "end": 1941, "text": "Gomez and Chamorro, 2017)", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 2149, "end": 2163, "text": "(Godden, 2008)", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "The study was conducted on a commercial free-stall dairy farm located in the north-eastern region of Poland (Warmian-Masurian Voivodeship), where approximately 370 Polish Holstein-Fresian lactating cows were housed and fed according to the recommendations of the German Agricultural Society (Deutsche Landwirtschafts-Gesellschaft, DLG).

The absence of clinical disease symptoms and improved growth in the TRT group point to reduced absorption of lys from colostrum, but are not indicative of subclinical infections (Piantedosi et al., 2010) . Previous research (Li et al., 1995) indicates that glycation, a posttranslational protein modification which requires the presence of proteins and sugars in the same matrix, significantly decreases lys activity.

According to Calamari et al. (1982) , an increase in cp activity during the first days of life is linked with liver function after birth. Thus, our observations of changes in cp activity, accompanied by higher IgG concentrations and lower lys activity, indicate that alterations in cp levels are associated with Cu release from the liver (Abeni et al., 2012) . The above phenomenon as well as the lower incidence of clinical symptoms of infection and a fast growth rate of calves can be attributed to the healthy development of the gastrointestinal tract (Zwierzchowski et al., 2016) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 148, "end": 170, "text": "Calamari et al.

The effect of aging on changes in biochemical parameters has been widely discussed (Knowles et al., 2000; Mohri et al., 2007; Pavlik et al., 2010; Zwierzchowski et al., 2016) . However, the aim of this study was to determine alterations in selected parameters associated with gastrointestinal function as a natural consequence of experimental diet manipulation. ALT, AST, and AP are non-specific enzymatic disease markers associated with liver function, growth and development of skeletal muscles and bone mineralization (Mohri et al., 2007) . In our study, Table 2 The effect of the applied treatment on the serum concentrations of selected blood variables 1 in Holstein calves. colostrum-supplemented transition milk had no effect on ALT and AST activity (Table 2) , which can be considered desirable. Any changes in the activity of those enzymes should be treated with caution and approached as a potential marker of liver dysfunction. It should be noted that increased AST activity in ruminants was associated with liver damage caused by high-grain diets (Castillo et al., 2012) . According to Egli and Blum (1998) , increased AP and LDH activity in the first stage of life is related to colostrum ingestion. Our findings confirm this hypothesis. The average activity of AP and LDH was higher in TRT calves that gained weight at a faster rate. Rapid weight gain requires better bone mineralization which stimulates AP release. LDH is also considered as a non-specific marker of disease since there are many factors contributing to its activity variations. Additionally, LDH activity differ between tissues, cells, fluids and those differences can be enhanced depending on the disease the animal is suffering from (Mohri et al., 2007; Nagy et al., 2013) . For instance, some authors (\u017barczy\u0144ska et al., 2012) link increased LDH activity with muscular dystrophy, but it was not the case in our study since we did not observe any symptoms of this disease. On the contrary, there are reports suggesting LDH fluctuations during respiratory diseases (Nagy et al., 2013) . However, we did not analyze each isoform separately, therefore any conclusion coming from our study should be drawn with caution. Calves from the TRT group were characterized by higher values of Glu, chol, TAG, and TP. According to Reynolds et al. (2003) , in the first stage of life, glu levels are associated with colostrum intake, whereas in later stages, an increase in glu concentrations is linked with up-regulated corticosteroid secretion due to intensified growth. The latter increases chol and TAG levels (Cavestany et al., 2005) . The concentrations of glu, chol, and TAG can be altered by infection or diet (Bozukluhan et al., 2017) . This observation is consistent with our results because the incidence of diarrhea was higher in the CR group than in the TRT group (10 vs. 6 diarrhea cases, respectively). Calloway et al. (2002) suggested that TP is a potential FPT diagnostic tool. In the proposed approach, serum TP levels should not decrease below 52 g/L 72 h postpartum. In our study, the average TP concentration in CR calves at 3 d of age was 51.3 g/L, which indicates that the suggested safety threshold was not reached. Indeed TP was correlated with IgG concentration (P < 0.001), however correlation coefficient indicated moderate link between both parameters (r = 0.437; Figure S1 ). In 8 out of 17 calves in the CR group TP was below the recommended level of 52 g/L. In contrast, only one TRT calf failed to reach the TP concentration of 52 g/L. These results corroborate previous research findings (Cuttance et al., 2017; Je\u017eek et al., 2006; Knowles et al., 2000; Mohri et al., 2007; Zwierzchowski et al., 2016) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 145, "end": 167, "text": "(Knowles et al., 2000;", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 168, "end": 187, "text": "Mohri et al., 2007;", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 188, "end": 208, "text": "Pavlik et al., 2010;", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 209, "end": 236, "text": "Zwierzchowski et al., 2016)", "ref_id": "BIBREF53"}, {"start": 583, "end": 603, "text": "(Mohri et al., 2007)", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 1121, "end": 1144, "text": "(Castillo et al., 2012)", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 1160, "end": 1180, "text": "Egli and Blum (1998)", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 1779, "end": 1799, "text": "(Mohri et al., 2007;", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 1800, "end": 1818, "text": "Nagy et al., 2013)", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 1848, "end": 1873, "text": "(\u017barczy\u0144ska et al., 2012)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2110, "end": 2129, "text": "(Nagy et al., 2013)", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 2364, "end": 2386, "text": "Reynolds et al.
