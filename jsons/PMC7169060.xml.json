Here, we report eight patients (9%) who had a positive NP PCR test who also had additional pathogens isolated from BAL samples (Table 4). These findings suggest bronchoscopy should be considered even in patients with positive RVP\u2010PCR from NP sampling. Our data also support the use of bronchoscopy in patients with negative NP RVP\u2010PCR testing as additional pathogens were identified in BAL fluid.",

We had no way to standardize the timing of when samples were collected relative to symptom onset or why patients underwent repeat testing, as there was no protocol at our institution for timing or work\u2010up of immunosuppressed patients with pulmonary infiltrates. There is the possibility that NP sample collection was not adequate, which could have contributed to the false negative rate. Lastly, BAL return was highly variable which also may have affected viral PCR positivity.",

            "text": "In conclusion, viral PCR testing performed on samples obtained from the nasopharynx has a high concordance with viral PCR testing performed on BAL samples with a low false negative rate. However, NP testing is heavily reliant on proper collection technique and has variability in the detection of certain viruses. Non\u2010invasive testing using NP RVP\u2010PCR should be used if bronchoscopy is unable to be performed and is a reliable test both for diagnosing and excluding viral infections. Relying on the negative predictive value of NP viral PCR in patients with low clinical suspicion of infection could lead to cost savings by avoiding duplicate RVP testing. However, BAL remains an important tool in the evaluation of infiltrates in immunosuppressed patients, particularly during the winter and spring months because of discordance in testing and the high rates of co\u2010infection. Ultimately, accurate and timely diagnosis (or exclusion) of viral infections via RVP\u2010PCR testing of either NP or BAL samples will likely have an important clinical impact on immunosuppressed patients both through the rapid initiation of antiviral therapy and careful antibiotic stewardship.",
