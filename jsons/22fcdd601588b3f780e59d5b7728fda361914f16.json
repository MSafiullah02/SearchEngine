            "text": "The immune system of newborns is not fully developed. In humans and rodents IgG is transferred through the placenta, whereas in ruminants the immunity (mainly IgG) is transferred with colostrum and milk. The bird's immune system consists mainly of primary and secondary lymphoid organs. Functionally, it may be divided into innate, nonspecific and adaptive, specific. The noncellular branch includes 3 immunoglobulin classes: IgA, IgM, and IgY. The IgA and IgM are similar in molecular weight, structure, and electrophoretic mobility to their mammalian counterparts. The major avian immunoglobulin class IgY present in the serum and egg yolk shows fundamental structural differences in comparison with IgG molecule (e.g., higher molecular weight than that of mammalian IgG, the presence of an additional C H domain and 2 carbohydrate side-chains, a lower content of \u03b2-sheet structure, and more disordered structure compared with mammalian IgG). It also differs in proteolysis, temperature, pressure, and freezing stability (Chalghoumi et al., 2009) . The IgY binds neither to proteins A and G, nor to the mammalian complement, and does not cross-react with mammalian immunoglobulins (Jensenius et al., 1981; Larsson et al., 1991) .",

            "text": "In mammals, the transfer of maternal antibodies can take place after birth. However, in the chicken, the maternal antibodies must be transferred to the developing embryo to give acquired immunity to the chick. The IgA and IgM are incorporated into the egg white during egg formation (Rose and Orlans, 1981; Warr et al., 1995; Aveskogh and Hellman, 1998) . Serum IgY is selectively transferred to the yolk via a receptor on the surface of the yolk membrane that is specific for IgY translocation. Hen's eggs are very convenient tool for antibody production. The serum concentration of IgY have been reported to be 5.0 mg/mL. Antigenic stimulation can yield more than 100 mg of IgY from one egg. A laying hen produces approximately 20 eggs per month; therefore, more than 2 g of IgY per month can ABSTRACT Immunity transfer from a mother to the newborn does not depend exclusively on immunoglobulins. Peptides, which are characterized by immunoregulatory properties that accompany IgG 2 , known as proline-rich polypeptide complex (PRP), have been discovered for the first time in ovine colostrum. In this report we present new data showing that some immunoregulatory peptides associated with the main immunoglobulin class, IgY, are also present in the avian immune system. Cytokine-inducing activity of particular fractions obtained from ovine colostrum, IgG+ (IgG 2 containing PRP), IgG\u2212 (IgG 2 free of PRP), and purified PRP, was compared with that of crude egg yolk IgY (IgY+), additionally purified egg yolk IgY (IgY\u2212), and polypeptides accompanying IgY named Yolkin (Y), using an ex vivo model of whole human blood cells. It was shown that both IgG+ fraction and PRP, but not IgG\u2212, stimulated the whole blood cells to release tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 and interleukin-1\u03b2 cytokines. Similar experiments performed with hen's egg IgY preparations showed that IgY+ and Y samples showed higher cytokine-inducing activity than samples additionally purified with the use of size exclusion chromatography (IgY\u2212). The IgY+ at a dose of 100 \u00b5g was even more active than the positive lipopolysaccharide control. It was also found that Y is able to stimulate macrophage cell line J774.2 to release nitric oxide. The results obtained suggest that IgY, the main chicken immunoglobulin fraction, is accompanied by additional polypeptides and plays a role of a transporter of biologically active substances, which was observed in the case of colostral IgG.",

Stimulation of the hens results in the formation of eggs containing high level of antibodies, predominantly the IgY class (Warr et al., 1995; Aveskogh and Hellman, 1998; Schade et al., 2005; Nilsson et al., 2007; Dias da Silva and Tambourgi, 2010) . Passive immunization by oral administration of specific antibodies has been an attractive approach against gastrointestinal pathogens in both humans and animals. Immunoglobulin Y is an alternative to antibiotics in the treatment of various infections with antibiotic-resistant pathogens [e.g., Escherichia coli, Salmonella, Staphylococcus, Coronavirus, and Rotavirus (Mine and Kovacs-Nolan, 2002; Liou et al., 2011) ]. The immunity transfer from a mother to the newborn does not only depend on immunoglobulin. Colostrum and milk are rich in proteins and peptides, which play a regulatory role and may stimulate the neonate immune system. Peptides, which are characterized by immunoregulatory properties that accompany IgG 2 , have been discovered for the first time in ovine colostrum (Janusz et al., 1974) . Because of high proline residue content, they are referred to as proline-rich polypeptide complex (PRP), subsequently named Colostrinin. The complexes similar to PRP were also found in human, bovine, and caprine colostra (Piasecki et al., 1997; Soko\u0142owska et al., 2008) .",

It was interesting to study if the IgY, the main chicken immunoglobulin, shows some immunoregulatory properties, similarly to ovine IgG 2 . For this reason, we compared the cytokineinducing activity of a particular fraction obtained after isolation and purification of PRP from ovine colostrum: IgG 2 containing PRP (named IgG+), PRP deprived IgG 2 (named IgG\u2212) and isolated PRP with that of crude and additionally purified IgY fraction (IgY+ and IgY\u2212, respectively), and low molecular fraction after SEC (Y). The cytokine induction was determined in ex vivo stimulated human whole blood cell cultures. The use of unseparated whole blood cultures mimicked the natural microenvironment in which the different leukocyte populations can cooperate. This concept was validated by the use of LPS-stimulated cultures as positive Figure 2\ufffd Interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2 inducing activity: a) IgY, b) ovine IgG 2 (control, untreated cells; LPS, lipopolysaccharide from Escherichia coli as positive control; IgY+, isolated IgY; IgY\u2212, purified IgY; IgG\u2212, IgG 2 fraction; IgG+, IgG 2 + PRP complex; PRP, proline-rich polypeptide complex).

It is worth noting that the cytokine-inducing activity of IgG+ is higher than purified IgG (IgG\u2212; Figure 1b, Figure 2b ). This confirms that immunoglobulin plays a role of a transporter of PRP, a biologically active substance important for the modulation of cellular signaling pathways. To find the presence of IgYassociated peptides with biological activities similar to PRP, we compared the cytokine inducing activity of IgY isolated from hen's eggs (IgY+), IgY purified using SEC chromatography (IgY\u2212), and IgY-associated peptides (Y) with the activities observed in PRP.",
