In order to request an interpreter, the Emergency Services Representative or triage nurse places a request in the patient's chart for the specific language needed in order to use the interpreter services within the hospital. The hospital provides an in-person Spanish interpreter 20 hours every day. If an in-person interpreter is unavailable, providers are able to request a video or phone interpreter.

Respiratory PCRs are able to detect for viruses including Adenovirus, Coronavirus, Human metapneumovirus, Parainfluenza, Parapertussis, Pertussis, Chlamydia pneumoniae, and Mycoplasma pneumoniae.

We found that children from Spanish-speaking families were more likely to have chest x-rays, CBCs, and blood cultures ordered compared to children from English-speaking families. Although the mean maximum temperature and heart rates recorded were slightly higher among children from Spanish-speaking families, this small difference neither appears to be clinically significant nor should these vital sign differences prompt increased diagnostic testing. Furthermore, these results were found after controlling for patient age, triage acuity, and prior visit to account for possible differences in disease severity. We did not find significant differences in other diagnostic laboratory testing, such as viral assays. A possible reason for this finding could be that certain tests would not lead to significant changes in the acute management of a nonmedically complex patient. However, if providers were unsure of their diagnosis of bronchiolitis, obtaining a chest x-ray, CBC, or blood culture may prompt change in management such as the consideration of an inpatient admission or the prescription of (or omission of) antibiotics. Given there were no statistically significant differences in the results from the sensitivity analyses, or in admission rates and antibiotic administration, the results suggest there is still diagnostic uncertainty among patients with bronchiolitis when language barriers are present, leading to increased testing without differences in interventions.",

However, in a recent study involving pediatric patients with asthma, there was no difference in pulmonary function testing or rates of asthma exacerbation in patients with limited English proficiency compared to patients who only spoke English.13 The investigators concluded that the lack of differences found in patients with limited English proficiency may be due to the widespread availability of interpreters.13 In our study, we still found differences among families who requested an interpreter. Although there has been a robust body of research that indicates that medical interpreters improve patient satisfaction and understanding,14, 15, 16, 17 exactly how the use of medical interpreters impacts the disparities in patient management in the emergency department is unknown.",

Very few studies have looked at specific differences in management.

In a study conducted by Payne and Puumala, no racial or ethnic disparities were found among pediatric patients who presented with head injuries, for which a head injury algorithm was used.5 Even though differences were not observed, there is insufficient evidence to show that evidence-based guidelines actually reduce disparities among children. Adherence to guidelines may not produce any change (if all patients benefit irrespective of racial, ethnic, or language background) or may even worsen disparities, as shown in some adult studies.30\n",

However, there is some rationale that focusing on the development and implementation of comprehensive equity-focused guidelines may be a way to facilitate the reduction of disparities among diagnostic testing, interventions, and health outcomes. Welch et al discussed the necessity of explicitly considering health equity in the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation methodology, and developed an approach for how guideline panels can assess the influence of equity factors on the direction and strength of recommendations.31, 32, 33 For instance, openly asking questions about biases and researching the evidence regarding which populations are potentially disadvantaged in relation to a clinical problem and why (because of race, gender, culture, language, etc.) can help directly inform clinical practice guidelines. Although other frameworks (such as the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guidelines used in the United Kingdom) explicitly identify certain patient characteristics that must be considered in guideline development, only recently has health equity been included in the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation framework as a consideration for clinical recommendations from an individual perspective. Thus, clinical practice guidelines may contribute to promoting health equity especially when the etiologies of the clinically relevant disparities are thoroughly explored.31\n",

Although we used a standardized method to identify patients with the diagnosis code of bronchiolitis, the diagnosis is determined by physicians\u2019 documentation and expertise in making their diagnosis. Furthermore, diagnostic codes may be changed after the chart is reviewed for billing, which may not always be in accord with the physician diagnosis codes. Second, we determined the independent variables (by using preferred language and interpreter requested) from the documented fields in the EMR. Although we attempted to remove potential sources of bias by excluding the encounters with discordant language data, we still could not verify that even if an interpreter was requested, that they were used for the entire visit, when they were used, and to what extent. Third, we developed covariates a priori, and other covariates, such as the diagnosis of reactive airway disease, were difficult to control for given inconsistencies in documentation. These diagnoses may have prompted physicians to use bronchodilators more often. However, we did not see differences in bronchodilator use among the 2 groups of patients, and the history of reactive airway disease should not affect the need for CBCs, blood cultures, and chest x-rays, which were the only significant differences in this study. Last, this was a single-center study and may not be generalizable to other institutions. However, because our study did include 2 emergency departments within a large catchment area, results may be similar at other large children's hospitals.",
