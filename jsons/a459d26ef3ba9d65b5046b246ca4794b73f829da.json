The mean duration from self-reported symptoms to death was 15 (IQR: 10-19) days. Table 2 summarizes the clinical and biochemical characteristics of all SARS patients. The median age of the deceased patients was much higher than that of the patients who survived (57 vs. 32, P < 0.001). The rate of the concomitant diseases in the deceased patients was also higher than that of the patients who survived (57.0% vs. 17.9%, P < 0.001). While the deceased patients were significantly older than the patients who survived (Figure 3A) , ages were comparable between men and women in both patients who deceased and survived with SARS ( Figure 3B) . The proportion of men was higher in the deceased group (53.2%) than in the group who survived (42.3%) (\u03c7 2 test, P = 0.027) (Figure 3C) .

This is the first preliminary study investigating the role of gender in morbidity and mortality of SARS-CoV-2 infection. One study of 425 patients with COVID-19 indicated that 56% were males (5) . Another study of 140 patients found that 50.7% were males (9) . In the present study, similar susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 between males and females was observed in 1,019 patients who survived the disease (50.0% males), collected from a public data set and in a case series of 43 hospitalized patients (51.2% males). Although the deceased patients were significantly older than the patients who survived COVID-19, ages were comparable between males and females in both the deceased and the patients who survived. Therefore, gender is a risk factor for higher severity and mortality in patients with COVID-19, independent of age and susceptibility. This gender factor, as well as higher incidences in men for most of the diseases, could correlate with a general demographic fact of a shorter life expectancy in men compared to women in China and in the world in general. Although there is no significant difference in median age between male and female groups, the maximum of the range of IQR is lower in males in the case series.",
