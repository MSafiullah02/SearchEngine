About 15% of the patients have developed severe pneumonia, and about 6% need noninvasive or invasive ventilatory support. Currently, there are about 1000 patients who need ventilatory support and another 120 new patients daily who require noninvasive or invasive ventilation support in Wuhan city; however, there are only about 600 ICU beds [4] . To address this shortfall, 70 ICU beds were created from general beds and the government quickly transformed three general hospitals to critical care hospitals with a total of about 2500 beds that specialize in patients with severe SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia (equipped with monitors and high-flow nasal cannula, noninvasive ventilator or invasive ventilators).",

About 30 to 50% of COVID-19 patients have chronic comorbidities. The duration from the initial symptom to respiratory failure in most patients is > 7 days, which is longer than H1N1 [7, 8] . Additionally, many patients that go on to develop respiratory failure had hypoxemia but without signs of respiratory distress, especially in the elderly patients (\"silent hypoxemia\"). Moreover, only a very small proportion of patients have other organ dysfunction (e.g., shock, acute kidney injury) prior to developing respiratory failure. These characteristics suggest that traditional methods such as quick sequential organ failure assessment (qSOFA) score and the new early warning score (NEWS) may not help predict those patients who will go on to develop respiratory failure. Therefore, it is urgent to establish a prediction or early recognition model of patients likely to fail.",
