            "text": "A wide spectrum of viruses can directly cause human disease, ranging in severity from asymptomatic to life threatening. Host survival is dependent upon key factors including cellular mechanisms of innate antiviral immune response, intended to counter virus replication until virus-specific lymphocytes can eliminate the infection. Therefore, the development of therapeutic intervention strategies that augment these intrinsic, early broad-spectrum antiviral mechanisms is desirable. Although the biology, life cycle, and pathogenesis of different viruses are widely divergent, IFNs activate protective mechanisms aimed at both virus control and elimination. Administration of IFNs can be used for prophylaxis as well as early therapy, predicated on the principle of supplementing to compensate for insufficient IFN production or activity that might be actively blocked by the virus.",

            "text": "For decades, type I IFNs (IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2) have been explored as mediators of rapid, innate antiviral protection. In 2003, a novel group of three cytokines, now known as type III IFNs (IFN-\u03bbs), was discovered that act independently of type I IFNs to establish antiviral resistance in cells (Kotenko et al., 2003; Sheppard et al., 2003). An additional member of this family (IFN-\u03bb4) was discovered in 2013 (Prokunina-Olsson et al., 2013). Most of the information on the function of IFN-\u03bbs has been generated using mouse models and thus has to be critically evaluated in relation to human disease (Ye et al., 2019). The distinctive actions of type I and type III IFNs are achieved through the engagement of separate nonoverlapping heteromeric receptor complexes: IFNAR complex (with IFNAR1/IFNAR2 subunits) for all type I IFNs and IFNL complex (with IFNLR1/IL10R2 subunits) for all type III IFNs (Fig. 1). Signaling pathways and sets of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) induced by these IFNs are remarkably similar but not redundant (Crotta et al., 2013; Galani et al., 2017). IFNAR is expressed on all cells, while IFNLR, limited by IFNLR1 expression, is restricted to epithelial cells and a subset of immune cells, including neutrophils. Due to these specific expression patterns, type I IFNs provide a systemic response, and IFN-\u03bbs guard epithelial surfaces (Broggi et al., 2020; Fig. 1).",

However, these treatments have significant systemic side effects due to the ubiquitous expression of IFNAR. In mice, IFN-\u03bb was found to be more effective than IFN-\u03b1 in preventing and treating influenza virus infection, with no increase in inflammation and tissue damage as compared with IFN-\u03b1 (Davidson et al., 2016; Galani et al., 2017). IFN-\u03bb was also more potent than IFN-\u03b1 in restricting viral dissemination from nasal epithelium to the upper respiratory tract (Klinkhammer et al., 2018). Clinical trials of IFN-\u03bb for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C virus infection documented fewer and milder side effects, but equal efficacy, when compared with IFN-\u03b1\u2013based therapies (Muir et al., 2014). These studies suggest specific advantages for IFN-\u03bbs as antiviral therapeutics at epithelial surfaces.",

            "text": "With no time to spare for new pharmaceutical developments, the race is on for the repurposing of existing drugs. A compelling case can be made for IFN-\u03bb\u2013based therapeutics. Pegylated IFN-\u03bb1 (peg-IFN-\u03bb1) is the only IFN-\u03bb currently available as a therapeutic agent. In vitro, treatment with IFN-\u03bb showed potency against a variety of viruses, including SARS-CoV1 and MERS-CoV. The main function of IFN-\u03bb is to prevent viral infection by establishing an antiviral state and, if infected, to slow viral replication and dissemination. In contrast to IFNAR, the IFNLR is largely absent on resting immune cells in humans and mice (with the notable exception of neutrophils [Blazek et al., 2015; Broggi et al., 2017; Espinosa et al., 2017] and human B cells [Goel et al., 2020]), allowing to avoid or minimize systemic inflammation caused by treatment with type I IFNs (Broggi et al., 2020; Fig. 1). Severe lung inflammation and tissue damage are hallmarks of COVID-19, significantly contributing to mortality from this infection (Mehta et al., 2020); thus, enhancement of inflammation and cytokine storm must be avoided. However, it remains to be elucidated whether IFNLR can be up-regulated upon stimulation or in a highly inflamed environment, increasing the risk of possible adverse effects of IFN-\u03bb on human cells (Espinosa et al., 2017; Goel et al., 2020). The absence of pro-inflammatory effects in the lungs (Davidson et al., 2016; Forero et al., 2019; Galani et al., 2017) is one of the most important arguments for the specific advantage of IFN-\u03bb over type I IFNs as a treatment option for COVID-19. However, it is very important to establish if immune cells are responsive to IFN-\u03bb in COVID-19, as their activation exacerbates inflammation. It also remains to be seen whether IFN-\u03bb shares the known antiproliferative effect of type I IFNs and whether this could impede repair processes during recovery or sensitize epithelial cells to virus-induced cell death.",

Type I IFNs are known to be detrimental in select bacterial infection models (Davidson et al., 2015). For example, Ifnlr\u2212/\u2212 mice show improved bacterial control in virus\u2013bacteria superinfection models (Planet et al., 2016), and ectopic induction of IFN-\u03bb production proved to be detrimental in mice previously infected with influenza (Rich et al., 2019). While type I IFNs often suppress antibacterial action of immune cells, IFN-\u03bb may employ other routes to facilitate bacterial superinfection, such as reduction in neutrophil recruitment (Blazek et al., 2015; Rich et al., 2019) and/or neutrophil bactericidal activities (Broggi et al., 2017). Although mouse models do not fully recapitulate human diseases with respect to IFN-\u03bb activities, animal studies give a mandate to carefully evaluate the use of IFN-\u03bb as a therapeutic agent against COVID-19.",

For SARS-CoV-2, it is still debated whether alveolar macrophages or endothelial cells are productively infected and could serve as a virus reservoir not accessible to IFN-\u03bb antiviral action for lack of IFNLR1. While IFN-\u03bb may be better suited than type I IFNs as host-directed anti\u2013SARS-CoV-2 therapy, studies are needed immediately to assess possible detrimental effects that should be factored into further use of IFN-\u03bb.",

Potential adverse effects might also be minimized by the shorter duration of treatment. For example, the proposed Phase III clinical trial for chronic hepatitis D virus will be dosed once weekly for 48 wk, as it was in the preceding Phase II study (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02765802). However, in the case of acute COVID-19, one or two doses of peg-IFN-\u03bb1 are deemed sufficient in the currently designed randomized clinical trials. This approach could provide immediate protection to healthcare workers and other persons at high risk of being infected or during early stages of infection, while patients show no sign of an inflammatory reaction, especially in the lungs.",

We need to understand whether the virus induces the endogenous expression of IFN-\u03bb and/or blocks IFN-\u03bb responses. Is there an age difference in the expression of IFN-\u03bb or its receptors that can explain the more severe disease in older patients? What are the effects of IFN-\u03bb on inflammatory responses and mechanisms of tissue damage and repair and how these activities should be measured in the clinical trials with peg-IFN-\u03bb1 in development for COVID-19? We also advocate for open access for the scientific community to the results of clinical trials to ensure their expert interpretation that can inform further measures. The COVID-19 pandemic illustrates the unmet need for prophylactic and rapid-response measures to boost the antiviral host response. IFNs, and IFN-\u03bb specifically, might address this need for broad-spectrum antiviral biologicals that could help not just this pandemic outbreak, but also future viral threats.",

IFNAR activation induces expression of ISGs and triggers pro-inflammatory responses via the recruitment and activation of immune cells. This promotes an antiviral state in the host, but as IFNAR is expressed on all cells, the administration of type I IFN can have serious systemic side effects. In contrast, type III IFNs (IFN-\u03bb1-4) signal through a distinct receptor complex, IFNLR, which consists of IL10R2 and IFNLR1 subunits. IFNLR1 expression is restricted to epithelial cells and a subset of immune cells, including neutrophils. Therefore, type III IFN administration as a prophylactic treatment or at an early stage of COVID-19 would result in ISG expression and antiviral response localized to epithelial cells, reducing side effects and inflammation associated with the systemic action of type I IFNs.",
