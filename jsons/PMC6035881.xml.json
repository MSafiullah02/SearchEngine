            "text": "Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV; family Phenuiviridae, genus Phlebovirus) is a mosquito-borne pathogen that causes severe disease in humans and livestock and is endemic in sub-Saharan Africa and the Arabian Peninsula (Bird et al., 2009). Infection in humans occurs via mosquito bite or exposure to animal tissues during the processing or handling of infected animals, and typically results in a relatively mild febrile illness. However, a small percentage of cases result in severe and often fatal hemorrhagic fever that can be accompanied by retinitis, fulminant hepatitis, and encephalitis (Ikegami and Makino, 2011; McElroy and Nichol, 2012). Currently there are no approved vaccines or antivirals to prevent or treat RVFV infection (Kortekaas, 2014). The virus is also transmissible to humans via aerosolization, which underlines concerns regarding its potential use as a bioterror agent and its classification as a Category A priority pathogen (NIAID, 2016). In addition, the World Health Organization has listed RVF as a high priority disease of public health interest (WHO, 2018).",

The potential also exists for RVFV to spread outside of established endemic areas due to the capacity of more than 40 species of mosquitoes, in 8 genera throughout the world, to serve as vectors (Turell et al., 2008). Introduction of the virus into na\u00efve animal and human populations poses a significant risk to susceptible species of agricultural importance, as well as public health. Thus, there is an urgent need for the development of effective therapeutics and vaccines to treat and prevent RVFV infections.",

            "text": "Galidesivir is an adenosine analog that has a substitution of carbon for nitrogen at position 7 on the base and a substitution of nitrogen for oxygen at position 1 on the ribose ring (Warren et al., 2014). When the viral RNA polymerase substitutes the natural nucleotide with galidesivir triphosphate, the structural change alters its electrostatic interaction, resulting in premature termination of the elongating RNA strand. Galidesivir has demonstrated broad-spectrum antiviral activity against a wide range of viruses, including filoviruses, togaviruses, bunyaviruses, arenaviruses, paramyxoviruses, coronaviruses, flaviviruses, one orthomyxovirus and one picornavirus (Warren et al., 2014), and is currently in clinical development as an antiviral therapy for Ebola virus disease (Taylor et al., 2016). In a pilot study, galidesivir was also shown to confer partial protection in a mouse model of RVFV infection (Warren et al., 2014). More recently, efficacy in Zika and tick-borne flavivirus infection models has been reported (Eyer et al., 2017; Julander et al., 2017). The first in-human Phase 1 study to evaluate the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of intramuscular administration of galidesivir versus placebo in healthy subjects recently concluded with promising pharmacokinetics properties and good tolerability (Taylor et al., 2016).",

As shown by the experiment design in Table 2\n, three animals from each dosage group were designated for whole blood collection by retro-orbital bleed at 15 min (right eye; 500 \u03bcl using lithium heparinized capillary tubes and lithium heparinized gel plasma tubes) and 2 h (left eye), with a terminal bleed (cardiac puncture) at 8 h post-treatment. Whole blood was collected from the second set of 3 animals in each treatment group at 30 min (right eye), 4 h (left eye), and 12 h post-treatment (cardiac puncture). The 3 animals treated with the LRS vehicle placebo were bled at the 15 min, 2 h, and 8 h time points. Plasma samples were processed by centrifugation and stored at \u221280 \u00b0C prior to shipment to Alturas Analytics, Inc. (Moscow, ID) for bioanalysis. For PK analysis of the data, the individual data from all animals in a dosage group were pooled at each time point. A surrogate mean plasma profile was compiled from the 6 time points for each dose. The mean plasma concentrations were analyzed by noncompartmental analysis in Phoenix WinNonlin v 7.0 (Certara, USA) to determine the mean PK parameters for each dose group.",

            "text": "Here, we have expanded the preclinical characterization of in vivo antiviral activity of galidesivir through evaluation in a lethal hamster model of RVFV infection for which no antiviral has proven to be 100% protective. Hamsters are exquisitely sensitive to the ZH501 strain of RVFV as reflected by the rapid, uniform lethality (within 2\u20133 days of challenge) with as little as 10 PFU of virus, high titer viremia, and substantial viral loads in most tissues examined (Scharton et al., 2015). Our findings show that galidesivir is able to significantly delay disease progression in all animals and protect up to 70% from mortality due to the rapidly progressing, highly lethal peracute nature of the RVFV-induced disease in hamsters. This high level of efficacy is comparable to that observed with another RdRP inhibitor, favipiravir, which was able to protect 70\u201380% of hamsters from lethal RVFV challenge when treatment was initiated 1 h p.i. (Scharton et al., 2014). Our results are highly encouraging and support the continued development of galidesivir through further studies in well-characterized nonhuman primate models (Hartman et al., 2013; Smith et al., 2012).",
