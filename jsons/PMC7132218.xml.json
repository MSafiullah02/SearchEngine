The effect of the pandemic on patients with cancer and the professionals involved in their care remains unclear at present; however, rapid and difficult decisions have had to be made. The response to the pandemic is a major priority that is straining already fragile health-care systems, although many patients with cancer cannot put their treatment on hold. According to studies of patients receiving treatment for COVID-19 in Chinese hospitals, those with cancer seem to have a higher risk of COVID-19 (refs1,2) and less favourable outcomes from this disease1. We eagerly await data from additional studies addressing how COVID-19 affects patients with cancer, which will need to be carefully interpreted.",

With precaution as a driving principle, these investigators propose a framework to minimize exposure while providing optimal care in three scenarios defined according to the severity of the crisis at a given health-care facility3. In this framework, prioritization is a key concept \u2014 indeed, in the near future we expect to read more articles discussing changes in priorities to improve delivery of care to important populations, including elderly patients, individuals awaiting test results, those with social and financial difficulties as well as cancer survivors, among others.",

Preclinical research is another fundamental determinant of how patients with cancer will be treated in the future. With researchers having to close their laboratories to comply with confinement regulations, a vast number of potentially relevant studies are now on hold.",
