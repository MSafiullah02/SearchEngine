            "text": "Avian infectious bronchitis is a highly contagious disease caused by infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) that affects poultry production worldwide (Cavanagh, 2007). IBV belongs to the Gammacoronavirus genus, in the Coronavirinae subfamily, of the Coronaviridae family, in the order Nidovirales. The IBV genome is approximately 27.6 kb in size. All coronaviruses share a similar genome organization with Gene 1 located at the 5\u02b9 end of the genome. As the replicase gene, it has been proved to be a determinant of pathogenicity of IBV (Armesto et al., 2009). The structural genes cluster at the 3\u02b9 end and encode the spike (S), membrane (M), envelope (E), and nucleocapsid (N) proteins (Cavanagh, 2005). IBV also possesses two accessory genes, Gene 3 and Gene 5, which have been shown to be dispensable for virus replication in cell culture (Casais et al., 2005; Youn et al., 2005; Hodgson et al., 2006; Bentley et al., 2013). However, it seems that the deletion of accessory genes 3a, 3b, 5a or 5b from IBV could induce an attenuated phenotype both in vitro and in vivo (Laconi et al., 2018; van Beurden et al., 2018).",

The high evolution and recombination rates of IBV result in new serotype viruses emerging in the field and often causing great losses since current vaccines only provide partial protection against new strains (Cavanagh et al., 1992; de Wit et al., 2011). Specifically, a new IBV variant has been circulating in China since 1998. This virus has been identified as the QX strain and has been primarily associated with various renal pathologies (Wang et al., 1998). Phylogenetic analyses showed that the IBV isolates that clustered with QX were mainly Chinese isolates (Zhao et al., 2016). These results further indicated that IBV isolates prevalent in China were evolutionarily distant from Massachusetts (Mass)-type strains (Terregino et al., 2008; Abro et al., 2012; Yan et al., 2017). Understanding the pathogenic mechanism and molecular characteristics of circulating strains could significantly facilitate the development of vaccines that provide efficient protection against the highly variable IBV.",

            "text": "Since the initial development of a reverse genetic system for RNA viruses (Taniguchi et al., 1978), this technique has proven to be a powerful method for investigating the molecular biology of RNA viruses and for studying the role of individual genes in pathogenesis. However, despite these successes, not all reverse-genetic systems of positive-stranded RNA viruses can be easily established. The large genome of the coronavirus poses a great obstacle to the construction of reverse genetic systems based on full-length cDNA. Cloning techniques using traditional plasmid DNA cloning vectors cannot guarantee stability of large fragments of coronavirus cDNA, and many studies have found that certain coronavirus gene sequences can have toxic effects in E. coli or cannot be cloned into conventional plasmid vectors or passaged in prokaryotic systems (Gonzalez et al., 2001). Therefore, infectious full-length clones of coronaviruses have only been established at the beginning of the 21 st century (Casais et al., 2001). Subsequently, reverse genetics was successfully applied to study the role of accessory genes in viral replication (Casais et al., 2005; Youn et al., 2005; Laconi et al., 2018), the potential of IBV as a vaccine vector (Britton et al., 2012; Bentley et al., 2013), the virulence determinants of the Beaudette and M41 strains (Fang et al., 2007; Maria et al., 2009; Keep et al., 2018), and the relationship between the S gene and tissue tropism of the virus (Casais et al., 2003; Britton et al., 2005; Promkuntod et al., 2013; Shan et al., 2018). However, to the best of our knowledge, all existing reverse genetics systems for IBV were either based on Vero cell-adapted Beaudette strain, which is non-pathogenic in chickens (Geilhausen et al., 1973), or the Mass-type strains, which are genetic quite distant from the prevalent QX-type strains. Neither of these systems therefore served as an ideal virus model to study the replication and pathogenic features of QX-type strains. Therefore, the application of reverse genetics techniques to QX-type strains may allow for modification of the viral genome and may provide a powerful tool for novel vaccine development.",

This isolate is genetically similar to most of the prevalent QX-type IBV strains found in China, albeit with increased pathogenicity compared with previously characterized strains (Feng et al., 2012). In this study, we describe the establishment of a reverse genetic system of the virulent YN strain. We also developed a modified rescue strategy, which combines full length RNA electroporation with in ovo virus amplification, thus avoiding cell-culture adaption and providing improved rescue efficiency of IBV. These advances will enable us to modify specific gene regions and investigate their influence on gamma coronavirus replication and pathogenicity.",

            "text": "In order to construct the recombinant Vaccinia virus containing complete IBV genome through vaccinia virus-mediated homologous recombination, the first step was to construct flanking region belonging to the vaccinia virus genome into the pGPT-1 plasmid. The left flank vvT7 was 557 bp in size, an XbaI and an BamHI restriction site were added at the 5\u02b9and 3\u02b9 end for the ligation into pGPT-1, and an additional type IIs restriction site BamBI and five nucleotides \u2018ACTTA\u2019 (shown in red in Table 1) from IBV 5\u2032UTR beginning was added at the 3\u02b9 end of vvT7 for the further ligation with IBV fragements. Between the vaccinia DNA sequence and BsmBI site was a bacteriophage T7 RNA polymerase promotor and an additional G nucleotide for the initiation of the in vitro transcription reaction. The PCR product vvT7 was digested with XbaI and BamHI to ligated into pGPT-1 plasmid, Next, we constructed the IBV segment 1 F (corresponding to nt 1 to 3285 in the YN genome) by RT-PCR. Upstream of the segment 1 F 5\u2032-end was a BsmBI restriction site, downstream of the segment 1 F 3\u2032-end was a BamHI site, thus to allow insertion of the 1 F cDNA downstream of vvT7 in pGPT-1 by restriction endonuclease digestion and T4-ligation. On the other side of pGPT-1, a 362 bp vaccinia virus flanking region vv-3\u2032 was cloned into the plasmid following digestion with XhoI and EcoRI, and an additional NotI restriction site was added before the EcoRI site to stop in vitro transcription after the poly(A) tail. The obtained plasmid, pGPT-1 F, was integrated into the vaccinia virus genome by homologous recombination under the positive selection pressure of mycophenolic acid (MPA) in the presence of xanthine and hypoxanthine, to which only recombinant vaccinia viruses with the Ecogpt gene show resistance (Falkner and Moss, 1990). Ecogpt-selected viruses were purified and sequenced to ensure that IBV segment 1 F and the Ecogpt gene had been inserted into the correct position in the vaccinia genome, and verified virus was termed vv-YN-1 F. Next, to generate a complete 3\u02b9 untranslated region (UTR) with a 25-bp poly(A) tail in strain YN, a DNA was synthesized and cloned in the pUC57 plasmid containing a 500 bp fragment 1 F (IBV-YN nts 2785\u20133285) plus 304 nts of the IBV-YN 3\u02b9UTR sequence (27,378\u201327,657) followed by a 25-bp poly(A) tail and 508 bp of vaccinia virus flanking sequence. We also incorporated several restriction sites for further modification in the order: 5\u02b9-SacI-1 F (2785\u20133285)-BamHI-SalI-3\u02b9UTR (27,378\u201327,657)-poly(A) (25 bp)- NotI-vv (508 bp)-XhoI-3\u02b9. This fragment was digested with SacI and XhoI and ligated into the digested pGPT-1 plasmid to replace the Ecogpt gene. Next fragment 1R corresponding to the IBV-YN genomic region from nt 3286 to 6559 containing BamHI and SalI sites was amplified and inserted between 1 F (2785\u20133285) and the 3\u02b9UTR (27,378\u201327,657) in pGPT-1 (Fig. 1\nA). The homologous recombination between pGPT-1R-3\u02b9UTR and vv-YN-1 F was performed by exerting negative selection pressure on D980R cells due to the presence of 6-thioguanine (Hertzig et al., 2004). After successful construction of the IBV-YN fragment 1 F1R containing the 5\u02b9-T7 promoter and the 3\u02b9-synthetic poly(A) tail in the vaccinia virus genome, the other eight remaining fragments (2 F, 2R, 3, 4 F, 4R, 5 F, 5R, 6) were inserted into the vaccinia virus genome by vaccinia virus-mediated homologous recombination using the method described above. The individual recombination steps are summarized in Fig. 1B. The final recombinant vaccinia virus was purified and sequenced by deep sequencing. The vaccinia virus possessing the complete IBV-YN genome was amplified on a large scale in BHK-21 cells and designated vvIBV-rYN.",

The construction procedure is shown in Fig. 2\n. Briefly, the complete N gene of IBV-YN was amplified by RT-PCR. The primers used were as follows: IBV-N- BamHI-F: TTAAGGATC CGCCACCATG GCAAGCAGTAAGGCAT; IBV-N-Not I-R: AAA AGC GGC CGC TCA AAG TTC ATT TTC ACC AAG TG. Two restriction sites, BamHI and NotI, were introduced into the PCR product to digest and insert it into a plasmid with the HSV-TK promoter just upstream of the insertion site, and the obtained N gene plus TK promoter plasmid was designated pTK-N. Then, the N gene plus TK promoter was amplified using the pTK-N plasmid as template with primers: TK-N-F-EcoRI: AACATACGCTCTCCATCAAAACAAAA; TK-N-R-BamHI: GATGCAATTTCCT CATTTTATTAGGAAAG G. The pSMPUW-SV40-Puro plasmid was cut with enzymes EcoRI and BamHI and the fragment containing the N gene plus the TK promoter was inserted by an in-fusion reaction. After the N gene and TK promoter were inserted into the plasmid expression system pSMPUW-SV40-Puro (Cell Biolabs, San Diego, CA, USA) (Fig. 2A), the plasmid was cotransfected along with pCMV-dR8.74 and pMD2G-VSVG (Cell Biolabs, San Diego, CA, USA)into 293 T cell lines to package the lentiviral particles. Lentiviral vector production was performed according to standard protocols. Briefly, subconfluent 293 T cells in a T25 flask were cotransfected with 5 \u03bcg of pSMPUW-SV40-Puro-N, 2 \u03bcg of pCMV-DR8.74, and 2 \u03bcg of pMD2G-VSVG using the transfection reagent XtremeGene 9 (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA).

Stable transduction of the lentiviruses was carried out as follows: 106 of BHK-21 cells were seeded in a 6-well plate and transduced at day 2 with 106 of the lentiviral vector. Selection was performed from day 3 using 2 \u03bcg/ml puromycin until the parental cells from a parallel experiment died (Fig. 2B).",

The fragment corresponding to the IBV-YN 5\u2032-end was engineered to contain a promoter for the T7 RNA polymerase that was placed immediately upstream of the IBV-YN 5\u2032-terminal A nucleotide. The fragment corresponding to the IBV-YN 3\u2032-end contained a polyA sequence of 25 nts followed by a NotI restriction endonuclease recognition site. This strategy has been successful for other full-length coronavirus cDNA clones (Casais et al., 2001; van den Worm et al., 2012; Tekes, 2016). It allows to generate an in vitro transcribed RNA containing one additional G nucleotide at the 5\u2032-end (required as transcription start site for the T7 RNA polymerase) and a polyA tail at the 3\u2032-end (Fig. 1A). The full-length cDNA was sequentially assembled into the vaccinia virus genome by six rounds of homogenous recombination using the E. coli guanine phosphoribosyltransferase as selection marker for positive or negative selection as appropriate (Fig. 1B). The integrity of the resulting vaccinia viruses was assessed by RT-PCR and sequencing analysis of the recombined regions after each recombination step. The final recombinant vaccinia virus, vvIBV-rYN, containing the complete IBV-YN genome was deep sequenced and the result showed 100% identity with the parental virus genome, with the exception of three silent nucleotide substitutions, T3281A, A3284C, and T6557C, which are diagnostic for the recombinant IBV genomic cDNA (Fig. 1A).",

Briefly, vvIBV-rYN DNA purified from virus particles was cleaved with NotI and used as a template for in vitro transcription with the T7 RNA polymerase in the presence of a cap analog. The RNA transcripts (10 \u03bcg) of the IBV cDNA were electroporated into 107 BHK-21/N cells, and the BHK-21/N cell supernatant was harvested after incubation at 37 \u2103 in 5% CO2 for 48 h. The supernatant was subsequently inoculated into the allantoic cavities of ECE for replication of the rescued virus. This strategy was chosen to facilitate the rescue procedure and to ensure that the recombinant IBV-rYN replicate efficiently in ovo. After 48 h incubation in the allantoic cavities, the recovery of IBV-rYN was confirmed by RT-PCR amplifying and sequencing the genomic region that contained the molecular markers to distinguish IBV-rYN from IBV-YN. As shown in Fig. 4\nA, B, the presence of a silent mutation that gave rise to a SalI restriction site at position T6557C was verified by restriction enzyme digestion as well as sequence analysis. This analysis showed that the PCR product of IBV-rYN can be digested into two segments corresponding to the mutation introduced into the genome, whereas the PCR product of parental YN strain was resistant to cleavage by SalI (Fig. 4A). Accordingly, the T6557C mutation was confirmed by sequencing analysis (Fig. 4B). Collectively, these results demonstrate the successful rescue of the pathogenic IBV strain YN from cloned cDNA by using electroporation of full-length IBV in vitro transcripts into N-protein expressing cells and subsequent virus amplification in the allantoic cavities of ECE.",

A similar phenotype was also observed when ECE were inoculated with wild-type IBV-YN. To compare replication of IBV-rYN with the parental strain IBV-YN in ECE, we first produced virus stocks that reproducibly induced embryo curling by passaging the viruses 10 times in ECE. 100 \u03bcl of collected P10 IBV-rYN allantoic fluid stock or wild-type IBV-YN stock that has been proven to be positive for IBV has been serially diluted (10\u22121\u201310-8) and inoculated into 10-day-old SPF ECE. Five eggs were used for each dilution. After 144 h incubation at 37 \u2103, inoculated eggs were evaluated for classical embryo curling caused by IBV and the EID50 titer was calculated according to the Reed and Muench method (Reed and Muench, 1938). IBV-YN and IBV-rYN were pathogenic to chicken embryos up to a dilution of 106, and the EID50 titer of IBV-rYN (107.17/100 \u03bcl) was comparable to that of its parental virus IBV-YN, (106.83/100 \u03bcl). We also assessed the virus titers of the same virus stocks in CEK cells to determine the TCID50. 100 \u03bcl of collected P10 IBV-rYN allantoic fluid stock or wild-type IBV-YN stock that has been proven to be positive for IBV has been serially diluted (10\u22121\u201310-6) and added onto 80% confluent CEK cells. Four replicate wells on 24-well plates were used for each dilution. After 48 h incubation at 37\u2103, 5% CO2, the 24-well plates were assessed for IBV infection by an IFA assay as described above. Titers were determined by observing infected cells under a fluorescence microscope and calculating the TCID50 per 0.1 ml.

            "text": "In 2000, the first full-length infectious clone of coronavirus was successfully rescued using the BAC system (Almaz\u00e1n et al., 2000). The advantage of the BAC system is that it can accommodate larger foreign genes or DNA fragments, and methods for modification and screening are well established (Almaz\u00e1n et al., 2015). Nevertheless, for certain coronaviruses stability of full-length BAC clones remained a problem. An alternative system was described in the same year by Yount and colleagues (Yount et al., 2000). They assembled a series of smaller subclones into an intact full-length TGEV cDNA by in vitro ligation (Yount et al., 2000). Viral mRNA was obtained by in vitro transcription, and then electroporated into BHK21 cells to successfully rescue recombinant TGEV. Notably this study also revealed that expression of the N protein facilitates the rescue of recombinant coronaviruses. One year later a third reverse genetic system for coronaviruses was described (Thiel et al., 2001) that is based on the use of vaccinia virus as eukaryotic cloning vector. This system has been first described for the generation of recombinant HCoV-229E and was subsequently applied to the generation of recombinant Mouse hepatitis virus (MHV; Coley et al., 2005), IBV (Casais et al., 2001), feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV; Tekes et al., 2008), and SARS coronavirus (van den Worm et al., 2012). As a large DNA virus, vaccinia virus has the following advantages: 1) Vaccinia virus itself can accommodate large fragments of foreign genes (at least the size of coronavirus genomes), and the virus' own infectivity and replication ability are not affected. 2) The inserted foreign DNA can be stably maintained and amplified in the vaccnia virus genome without the need to rely on prokaryotic cloning systems. 3) Vaccinia virus can be modified by homologous recombination, making it simple and easy to introduce mutations, insertions or deletions into cloned coronavirus genomes.",

However, to the best of our knowledge, all existing reverse genetics systems for IBV were either based on the non-pathogenic Beaudette strain (Casais et al., 2001) or the Mass-type attenuated vaccine strains (Zhou et al., 2013; Beurden et al., 2017). While according to previous researches, the prevalent serotype of IBV circulating in China and many other countries is QX type (Monne et al., 2008; Zhao et al., 2016), and the QX-type strains typically share <80% nucleotide identity with Mass-type strains. Therefore, the application of currently available Mass-type IBV reverse genetics systems cannot provide full insight into the immunogenicity and pathogenicity of QX-type strains. In this study, we successfully established a reverse genetic system based on a highly virulent QX-type (GI-19) strain YN isolated in China. We could show that the recombinant IBV-rYN replicates with the same kinetics, reaches the same peak titers, and displays comparable pathogenicity as the parental IBV-YN in ECEs. This indicates that this system will be a powerful tool to elucidate crucial viral and host factors that impact the high pathogenicity of QX-type IBV strains, and it may also serve as a starting point for the generation of novel vaccine candidates directed against IBV-QX-type strains.",

This strategy was highly efficient for the rescue of field strains. By introduction of reporter gene eGFP into the IBV-rYN genome, we could easily compare the rescue efficiency of BHK-21 and BHK-21/N cell lines. After electroporation with same amount rYN-EGFP/5a full-length RNA, bigger numbers of green fluorescent cells were observed in the BHK-21/N cell line than BHK-21 cell line, indicating the higher rescue efficiency of it. Also, in our study, a remarkable difference of virus infectivity in ECE (EID50 could reach 106.0-107.0 per 0.1 ml) was observed compared to CEK cells (TCID50 could only reach 103.0 per 0.1 ml) for IBV-YN, suggesting that ECE are more susceptible to IBV infection and thus greatly facilitate the rescue of recombinant viruses. By combining electroporation of IBV RNA into BHK-21/N cells and subsequent virus amplification in ECE we could indeed reach a rescue efficiency of 100% and only one passage in ECE was required for virus recovery, which makes the procedure for generating recombinant IBV field strains feasible and less labor intensive.",
