The peak wavelength of the light reflected by the tapetum is thought to be tailored to that particular species' biological niche\u25aaThe cellular tapetum\u2013All carnivores have a cellular tapetum made up of regularly arranged cells. Each tapetal cell contains precisely oriented organelles (rodlets) that reflect light in the visible spectrum\u25cbThe canine tapetum, in common with that of all carnivores except cats, has a highly variable thickness and the reflective rodlets are composed of a zinc-cysteine complex. The canine tapetum can be so thin that it may not be apparent by light microscopy and one must rely on identification of the non-pigmented RPE to determine the location of the superior fundus\u25cbThe feline tapetum is distinct from that of the dog, in that it is consistently thicker and the reflective rods, which are more precisely oriented, are made up of a riboflavin-zinc complex. This type of tapetum is strongly autofluorescent\n\n\u25aaThe fibrous tapetum\u2013Domestic herbivores generally have a tapetum made up of cell-poor, regularly oriented layers of collagen\n\n\u2022The overlying retinal pigment epithelium lacks pigment in the area of the tapetum\u2022Penetrating vessels can be seen in cross-section to pass from the medium-sized vessel layer through the tapetum at right angles, then terminate in the choriocapillaris.\nComparative CommentsWhile in general terms the anatomy of the human uvea conforms to that described for other species, differences exist \u2013 some subtle and some profound. Often, when confronted with an eye from a non-human species, an ophthalmic pathologist can find distinctive clues to the identity of that species from the appearance of the iris, ciliary body, or choroid and tapetum lucidum. Although a broad class of retinal diseases in humans is referred to as tapeto-retinal degeneration, the human does not have a reflective, cellular, or fibrous tapetum lucidum positioned between the choriocapillaris and the choroidal stroma. The presence of the tapetum lucidum is always intriguing when seen by pathologists accustomed mainly to human eyes.\n",

            "text": "\n\u2022In the absence of pigment within the iris stroma, the iris color will appear blue because of the diffraction of incident light within the iris stroma. The absence of pigment is due to a genetic color diluting effect, e.g. associated with the merle gene in dogs, on melanocytes of the body that are derived from the neural crest, including those of the hair coat and the stromal tissues of the uveal tract. The lack of pigment is not always uniform. For example, in some animals only one eye is blue while the other is brown (heterochromia irides), or in some eyes only a portion of the iris is blue (heterochromia iridis)\u2022The iris epithelium and the retinal pigment epithelium have a distinct neuroepithelial embryological origin, and are normally pigmented\u2022Iris stroma is devoid of pigment but not usually significantly hypoplastic. In contrast, the choroid of affected eyes is not only devoid of melanin, but variably hypoplastic. Likewise, the tapetum is often hypoplastic or absent\u2022The canine blue eye contains no identifiable melanocytes in the iris stroma when stained, by immunohistochemistry, for melanocytic markers. However, premelanosomes have been described in the cytoplasm of cells presumed to be melanocytes when examined with transmission electron microscopy. Feline and human blue irides have stromal melanocytes, but their cytoplasm lacks melanosomes.\n",

They may affect any breed, being particularly common in Labrador and Golden retrievers, but are seldom of clinical significance\u25aaThe pigmented epithelium of the iris or, less frequently, the inner epithelium of the ciliary body, undergoes spontaneous cystic hyperplasia, in the absence of inflammation or any other apparent predisposing factors\u2013\nSimilar cystic changes may affect the iris epithelium associated with the corpora nigra in horses, and if sufficiently large, can impact vision\u2013Acquired iris cysts, in cats, are a consistent morphological feature seen in eyes with a history of blunt trauma, or with other morphologic features suggestive of blunt trauma\u2013Spontaneous iris cysts are more likely to be bilateral and multiple in cats than in dogs and horses\n\u25aaClinical appearance and complications of iris cysts\u2013Cysts can break off and float free in the anterior chamber, although in cats they generally remain attached to the iris epithelium. Very rarely, they can move into the vitreous\u2013In dogs and horses, these cysts are typically spherical or ovoid and often darkly pigmented although they may vary in their degree of pigmentation. Feline iris cysts tend to be black, or very darkly pigmented, and are often more elongated and ovoid in appearance than canine iris cysts\u2013Cysts can masquerade as pigmented masses and careful clinical evaluation is essential to avoid inappropriate removal of the eye. As they are thin-walled, iris cysts can be distinguished from other pigmented masses (neoplasms) by trans-illumination using a bright light source\u2013\nCysts can make contact with the lens, resulting in focal capsular opacity, and may even initiate posterior synechiae\u2013Cysts can adhere to the endothelial surface of the cornea, and if they rupture or collapse, may be a source for endothelial pigmentation or atrophy\u2013The presence of multiple uveal cysts in the posterior chamber can lead to collapse of the ciliary cleft and anterior displacement of the iris with closure of the irido-corneal angle, but secondary glaucoma is not common.\n\n\u2022Pars plana cysts in cats and horses (Fig. 9.9\n)\u25aaCystic hyperplasia of the non-pigmented epithelium of the pars plana is a common finding in aged cats\u25aaThe cysts are filled with Alcian blue-staining hyaluronic acid, which is digested by treatment with hyaluronidase\u25aaThese cysts have no known clinical significance\u25aaCysts of the pars plana epithelium also occur in aged horses (see Ch. 11)\n\u2022Multiple irido-ciliary cysts in Golden Retriever dogs, \u2018pigmentary uveitis\u2019 (Figs 9.10\n, 9.11\n)\u25aaThe occurrence of multiple, thin-walled, irido-ciliary cysts is an important cause of glaucoma in Golden Retrievers. Within the COPLOW collection, there are 134 cases, representing 20% of glaucomas diagnosed in Golden Retrievers\u25aaBased entirely on submissions to the COPLOW collection, this condition was most prevalent in the Golden Retriever population in the North-eastern United States in the 1990s, which may reflect the common ancestry of this population\u25aaThe condition is seldom diagnosed in Golden Retrievers in Europe, although a very similar condition has been reported in Great Danes. There is one case in a Great Dane in the COPLOW collection, and occasional cases with similar morphology in other breeds have been diagnosed at COPLOW\u25aaThere are significant differences between the clinical presenting features and the histopathological features of this disease:\u2013\nClinically, the disease presents as uveitis with aqueous flare, and proteinaceous and cellular debris and pigment recognized in the anterior chamber. Typically there is also pigment adherent to the lens capsule, often in a radial pattern, and to the posterior cornea, hence the clinical term \u2018pigmentary uveitis\u2019. The condition often affects both eyes, although disease involvement is not generally symmetrical\u2013Histologically, the main defining characteristic of this disease is the presence of thin-walled epithelial cysts filling the posterior chamber and draped against the lens capsule and anterior face of the vitreous body. Inflammation is variable, and not consistently seen\u2013Affected globes are often heavily pigmented and free melanin pigment in the irido-corneal angle might play an important role in the pathogenesis of inflammation or glaucoma. Reduction in aqueous outflow by viscous material liberated from ruptured cysts, or simply anterior displacement of the iris by multiple cysts in the posterior chamber, could also contribute to the development of secondary glaucoma in affected dogs\u2013It should be acknowledged that, in a pathology collection, only severely affected globes, often with secondary glaucoma, are available for histopathological evaluation\n\u25aaMorphologic features of multiple irido-ciliary cysts in Golden Retrievers\u2013Thin-walled epithelial cysts, that may be either pigmented or non-pigmented, extending across the posterior chamber\u25cbCyst epithelium is thin, almost squamous in appearance\u25cbA PAS stain often reveals a magenta-staining basal lamina along with the epithelial cells\u25cbA cell-poor collagenous matrix may also be identified, adjacent to the cyst epithelium or attached to the lens capsule\n\u2013Cyst walls or portions of cyst walls are adherent to the anterior face of the vitreous body or the equatorial lens capsule\u25cbWhen present on the lens capsule, the cyst epithelium often extends anteriorly, towards the anterior pole of the lens. These pigmented thin epithelial fragments are probably what is recognized as pigment adherent to the lens clinically\n\u2013Posterior synechiae or iris bomb\u00e9 are frequently seen in globes removed because of secondary glaucoma\u2013\nPreiridal fibrovascular membranes are commonly encountered, often with concurrent peripheral anterior synechiae\u2013Focal retro-corneal membranes are often seen, frequently with pigment entrapment\u25cbFragments of thin-walled cysts are seldom, if ever, recognized in the anterior chamber\n\u2013Intraocular hemorrhage is often seen\u2013Free pigment in the irido-corneal angle may play a role in the development of glaucoma, just as it might in glaucoma associated with goniodysgenesis.\n\n\u2022Multiple irido-ciliary cysts are a characteristic finding in Rocky Mountain horses with an inherited complex of congenital ocular anomalies (see Ch. 3)\u25aaThe cysts are thin-walled and translucent and are generally present in both eyes of affected horses.\n\nComparative CommentsThe major congenital and developmental abnormalities of the human uveal tract are colobomas, aniridia, persistent pupillary membrane, persistence of the tunica vasculosa lentis, and iris cysts.\n",

Key to establishing a diagnosis is the recognition of the interplay of multiple different morphologic patterns, each of which adds an increment of credence to the diagnosis of ocular FIP. However, the pathologist's best effort often leads to only a tentative diagnosis of FIP.\u2022Gross lesions\u25aaOne of the most important lesions indicative of FIP is the observation of highly proteinaceous, cell-poor exudates in the aqueous and vitreous body.

However, the diagnosis is made based on clinical appearance, rather than by demonstrating the presence of the organism within ocular tissues\u25aaIn humans, disseminated mycoses with ocular involvement may be encountered in immunocompromised individuals\n\u2022Blastomycosis, Blastomyces dermatitidis (Figs 9.25\n, 9.26\n)\u25aaThere are 140 cases of Blastomycosis in dogs and eight cases in cats in the COPLOW collection\u2013Blastomycosis is the most commonly reported disseminated mycotic infection in dogs\n\u25aaBlastomycosis is a systemic mycotic infection, most common in the Mississippi River valley. The disease is also endemic in the Ohio and Missouri River valleys and the mid-Atlantic and southern states of the United States\u25aaThe disease occurs in very localized \u2018hot beds\u2019 of infection related to \u2018point source\u2019 exposure. Many cases live in close proximity to water courses\u25aaThe disease is considerably more prevalent in dogs than it is in humans and more prevalent in humans than it is in cats\u2013In humans, the disease seldom affects ocular structures other than the eyelid but can be associated with endophthalmitis\n\u25aaThis dimorphic fungus is found in acidic soils, particularly those with decaying wood, and is infective only by inhalation of spores from infectious soil or by direct implantation into a penetrating wound. While transmission to humans from dogs is theoretically possible by this latter route, the zoonotic potential of blastomycosis is very low\u25aaThe disease in dogs:\u2013Blastomycosis is typically a disease of young adult dogs who spend a lot of time outdoors, particularly hunting or working breeds\u2013The primary site of infection is the lung, which is the most commonly affected, and earliest, organ to develop lesions\u2013Other organs commonly affected include the eye, skin, lymph nodes, and bone. Any other tissue may be involved occasionally\n\u25aaMorphologic features of ocular involvement in blastomycosis include:\u2013Most commonly, a chorioretinitis is identified, that may be nodular or multifocal. Posterior segment involvement is most common, although the location of lesions in the globe or orbit is highly variable\u2013The inflammation is pyogranulomatous in all cases, although \u2018classical\u2019 nodular granulomas are not typical\u2013The diagnosis is dependent on finding the yeast form of the organism in histological sections or cytological preparations\u2013Morphologic features of the Blastomyces dermatitidis organism in tissue include:\u25cbExquisitely round, typically 10\u201315 \u00b5m diameter yeast form\u25cbOne micron refractile cell wall\u25cbBroad-based, budding forms\u25cbLive organisms have an amphophilic central body and dead organisms have only an empty cell wall\u25cbFree organisms are often surrounded by Splendore\u2013Hoeppli reaction\u25cbHistopathological findings in eyes with endophthalmitis related to blastomycosis do not appear to be significantly affected by anti-fungal treatment compared to untreated eyes, e.g. in their degree and type of inflammation and identification of budding yeast forms\n\n\u25aa\nBlastomycosis in cats:\u2013The disease in cats differs only minimally from that in dogs, although it is much rarer and feline blastomycosis is more likely to involve the central nervous system than canine blastomycosis\n\n\u2022Cryptococcosis, Cryptococcus neoformans (Figs 9.27\n, 9.28\n)\u25aaThere are 12 cases in dogs and 23 cases in cats in the COPLOW collection\u2013Cryptococcosis is considered to be the most common disseminated mycotic infection in cats\n\u25aaCryptococcosis affects many species as a systemic yeast infection, but only dogs and cats with ocular involvement are represented in the COPLOW collection\u25aaImmunosuppression plays a role in the establishment of disseminated infection, especially in humans\u25aaCats are more commonly affected than dogs but the clinical syndromes are similar in these species\u25aaCryptococcosis has a worldwide distribution and is acquired by the inhalation of spores from infectious soil. The infectious stage is often a contaminant in pigeon droppings\u25aaThe nasal cavity is the earliest and most likely site to become infected\u25aaThe tissues of the upper respiratory tract, CNS, lymph nodes, skin, and eyes are most commonly affected by cryptococcosis\u25aaThe definitive diagnosis of ocular cryptococcosis is dependent on identification of the organism in affected tissues or cytological preparations. Serological testing to detect cryptococcal antigen is also useful, particularly in monitoring response to therapy\u25aaMorphologic features of ocular cryptococcosis include:\u2013Most commonly, a multifocal, granulomatous chorioretinitis, although the infection can involve any part of the eye or orbit\u2013Pyogranulomatous inflammation is the most frequently observed type of inflammatory reaction. However, in some cases there is minimal cellular infiltrate\u25cbThe degree of inflammation appears to be inversely related to the thickness of the mucoid capsule on the infecting organism\u25cbIn cases with minimal or no inflammatory cellular component, the organisms are often found in blood vessel lumina\n\u2013Morphologic features of the Cryptococcus neoformans organism in tissue include:\u25cbThe yeast cell body ranges from 5 to 8 \u00b5m in diameter, and stains poorly with H&E, which reveals no visible internal structure\u25cbThe central yeast is surrounded by a thick polysaccharide capsule which does not stain with H&E. The capsule is between 3 and 10 \u00b5m thick\u25cb\nThe central yeast organism stains magenta with PAS, and the mucoid capsule stains blue with Alcian blue, or bright red with mucicarmine stain\u25cbIn contrast to blastomycosis, budding forms will not be found in Cryptococcosis\u25cbVery rarely, short pseudohyphae are seen.\n\n\n\u2022Histoplasmosis, Histoplasma capsulatum (Fig. 9.29\n)\u25aaThere are two cases in dogs and 16 cases in cats in the COPLOW collection. However, the organism is often hard to find in cats, and there may be many more cases that go undiagnosed\u25aaHistoplasmosis is a systemic disease, occurring worldwide, that affects many species, but only dogs and cats with ocular involvement are represented in the COPLOW collection\u25aaThe dimorphic fungus, Histoplasma capsulatum exists as infective hardy spores in the soil, particularly in soil rich in bird or bat droppings\u25aaIn the USA, the disease is most common in the Mississippi and Ohio River valleys\u25aaThe primary site of infection is in the lungs, following the inhalation of infective spores\u25aaDisseminated histoplasmosis commonly affects the lungs, intestine, lymph nodes, skeleton, skin and eyes, although involvement of any part of the body may be seen\u25aaMorphologic features of ocular histoplasmosis include:\u2013Pyogranulomatous uveitis, although there is a highly variable distribution of inflammation in the globe or in orbital tissues\u2013In cats there is often a thick spindle cell layer internal to the choroid as well as proliferation of the RPE. This is similar in many ways to the reaction seen in humans in the \u2018Presumed ocular histoplasmosis syndrome\u2019 (Fig. 9.30\n)\u2013The diagnosis depends on demonstrating the organism within tissues, which requires PAS or a silver stain for fungus\u25cbThe organism is always intracellular, within macrophage cells, and may be numerous or there may be only a few organisms. Furthermore there may be cases in which the organisms are too few to find, or nonexistent in the eye, as is often the case in humans\n\u2013Morphologic features of Histoplasma capsulatum in tissue include:\u25cbThe organism is small, only 3\u20135 \u00b5m in diameter, and is always located within macrophage cells\u25cbThe organism has a \u2018target\u2019 appearance with H&E, but stains uniformly black with silver stains\u25cbBudding is not seen\n\n\n\u2022Coccidioidomycosis, Coccidioides immitis (Fig. 9.31\n)\u25aaThere are 21 cases in dogs and seven cases in cats in the COPLOW collection\u25aaCoccidioidomycosis is a systemic disease endemic in the southwestern desert regions of the USA, as well as other low-lying deserts in Central and South America. The disease is acquired by inhalation of spores from the desert soil and animals that have prolonged outdoor exposure show enhanced risk of infection\u25aa\nImmunosuppressed animals are at particular risk of disseminated infection but the disease is also seen in otherwise healthy individuals\u25aaMany species are susceptible to infection but only dogs and cats with ocular involvement are represented in the COPLOW collection\u25aaThe disease commonly affects the lungs, bones, and eyes, however any tissue may be affected\u25aaMorphologic features of ocular involvement include:\u2013Pyogranulomatous inflammation in the tissues affected. In the eye, the pattern of disease is variable, although chorioretinitis is a common feature. Ocular involvement is often unilateral\u2013Coccidioidomycosis is diagnosed by demonstration of the organism in tissue sections or cytological preparations\u2013The organism exists in small numbers in tissues, but it is large and easily recognized\u2013The organism is more numerous, therefore more easily identified, in cat eyes than in dog eyes\u2013Morphologic features of Coccidioides immitis in tissues include:\u25cb\nThe spores from the soil, upon establishing infection in the tissues, transform into large spherules ranging from 20 to 85 \u00b5m in diameter\u25cbThe spherules consist of a thick, refractile, outer cell wall, containing small, 2\u20134 \u00b5m subunits called endospores\u25cbBudding is not seen, but the mature spherule bursts releasing numerous endospores\n\n\n\u2022Canine systemic (disseminated) aspergillosis (Fig. 9.32\n)\u25aaIn cases where the eye is submitted to COPLOW, ocular disease often precedes signs of systemic illness\u25aaThere are 21 cases of canine systemic aspergillosis in the COPLOW collection and of these, nine are in German Shepherd dogs, a breed that appears to be predisposed to opportunistic fungal infections\u25aaAffected dogs have widely disseminated infection and the diagnosis carries a poor prognosis\u25aaWidespread vasculitis is a prominent feature of the systemic disease\u25aaImmune deficiency, or aberrant immune response, is thought to be important in the pathogenesis of systemic aspergillosis. The disseminated disease in humans almost exclusively affects immunocompromised individuals and patients with a history of intravenous drug abuse\u25aaMorphologic features of ocular disease in canine systemic aspergillosis include:\u2013Panophthalmitis, often with the most severe exudate being identified, grossly and histologically in the vitreous body\u2013Fungal organisms are most likely to be found in the vitreous body adjacent to the inner retina\u2013Organisms are sometimes found within the lens capsule and capsular rupture may be a feature\u25cbThe hyphae may be found directly within the lens capsule, which should therefore be carefully scrutinized, because the organisms are very apparent in this location, even with H&E stain.\n\u2013Morphologic features of Aspergillus sp. in tissue include:\u25cbFilamentous fungi that have septate hyphae, with parallel cell walls and dichotomous branching\u25cbSilver stains are usually required to facilitate recognition of the hyphae\n\n\n\u2022Aspergillosis in birds\u25aaAlthough aspergillosis is a common cause of death in birds, there are only two cases of endophthalmitis and two cases of keratitis associated with aspergillus infection in avian eyes in the COPLOW collection.\n\n",

A major focus of the histopathologic study of specimens with uveitis is the determination of the cause. Uveitis may result from non-infectious stimuli, such as surgical or non-surgical trauma, and endogenous agents, including tissue necrosis and reactions to allergens. Other non-infectious causes include inflammation associated with systemic diseases and predisposing genetic factors, such as HLA antigens and allergic predispositions. Important categories of non-infectious uveitis in humans include sarcoidosis, Beh\u00e7et's disease, Vogt\u2013Koyanagi\u2013Harada syndrome, and phacoantigenic uveitis. A fascinating and important disease in this category that occurs only in man is sympathetic ophthalmia. This is a diffuse granulomatous inflammation of the uvea, occurring in the uninvolved eye following injury to the contralateral eye. The onset is usually a few days or weeks after a perforating injury to the exciting eye, or originally damaged eye, but there are well-documented cases of the onset being many years after the initial injury.In infectious uveitis with a bacterial etiology, there are a number of Gram-positive organisms that have a propensity to invade the choroid from the bloodstream. Granulomatous uveitis is seen with tuberculosis, leprosy, syphilis, Pneumocystis carinii choroidopathy, nocardiosis, and Lyme disease. Major viral causes of uveitis in humans include herpes simplex and herpes zoster viruses, Epstein\u2013Barr virus infection, cytomegalovirus infection, and congenital rubella syndrome. Major fungal causes of uveitis include Candida albicans infection, histoplasmosis and presumed ocular histoplasmosis, cryptococcal infection and Aspergillus infection. Causes of parasitic uveitis in humans include toxoplasmosis, toxocariasis, and onchocerciasis.\n",

Although uveal melanocytic neoplasia is generally benign in this species and this form of treatment is considered relatively non-invasive, its application in the absence of a definitive, histopathological diagnosis remains somewhat controversial. As malignant melanoma may arise in eyes with melanocytoma (see below), diligent follow-up and monitoring for signs of progression is warranted following laser therapy\n\u25aaMorphologic features of canine uveal melanocytoma) include (Fig. 9.38\n):\u2013Melanocytoma is usually made up of heavily pigmented large round cells and heavily pigmented spindle cells in variable proportions\u2013As the tumor takes on a more and more malignant cellular profile, more spindle-shaped, less pigmented cells begin to predominate over a smaller proportion of heavily pigmented round cells\u2013The mitotic index is a valuable means of distinguishing between melanocytoma and malignant melanoma\u25cbMore than four mitotic figures per 10 high power fields is indicative of malignant melanoma (see below) but is not necessarily predictive of malignant behavior\n\n\n\u2022Malignant ocular melanoma in dogs\u25aaThis is less common than benign uveal melanocytoma in dogs.\u2013There are 334 cases of malignant ocular melanoma in the COPLOW (Figs 9.39\n, 9.40\n)\u25cb323 are in the anterior uvea\u25cb11 are in the choroid\n\n\u25aaThe signalment of affected dogs may be summarized as follows:\u2013The average age of affected dogs is 10.3 years\u25cbIn contrast to melanocytoma, there is no spike in incidence in the 0 to 2 year age group\n\u2013Affected dogs by gender (where known)\u25cbMales: 37\u25cbNeutered males: 109\u25cbFemales: 21\u25cbSpayed females: 142\n\n\u25aaFrequently, malignant melanoma occurs in eyes with melanocytoma\u25aaEven though malignant ocular melanoma is characterized by histopathological features of malignancy, few metastasize and the prognosis is therefore only slightly guarded\u25aaMorphologic features of malignant uveal melanoma include (Fig. 9.41\n):\u2013Malignant melanoma is usually less pigmented than melanocytoma, or is amelanotic\u2013Anaplastic nuclear features including anisokaryosis, karyomegaly, folded nuclei, and large nucleoli are characteristic\u2013A mitotic index greater than four mitotic figures per 10 high power fields is indicative of malignant melanoma\n\n\u2022Feline diffuse iris melanoma (FDIM) (Figs 9.42\n, 9.43\n)\u25aaFDIM is a common clinical presentation and pathologic diagnosis in cats\u2013There are 1358 cases of diffuse iris melanoma in the COPLOW collection\u2013Diffuse iris melanoma accounts for 26% of total feline submissions and 50% of feline neoplasms submitted to COPLOW\n\u25aaThe signalment of affected cats may be summarized as follows:\u2013The average age of affected cats is 9.4 years old\u2013Affected cats by gender\u25cbMales: 55\u25cbNeutered males: 643\u25cbFemales: 65\u25cbSpayed females: 541\n\n\u25aaClinical histories indicate that FDIM begins as focal or multifocal areas of iridal pigmentation that are gradually progressive (Fig. 9.44\n)\u2013In the earliest stage, the pigmentation is strictly confined to the iridal surface. Lesions sampled at this stage are diagnosed as iris melanosis\u2013\nThe extent of the pigmented lesions increases either by enlargement of individual spots, or by increase in the number of pigmented spots\u2013The disease is designated as early FDIM when the pigment cells extend into the iridal stroma but the extent of involvement is still entirely within the iris\n\u25aaThe progression of disease is highly variable\u2013Cases have been documented where the disease has slowly progressed over a 10-year period with little or no apparent effect on the health of the eye, or where FDIM has gradually led to glaucoma\u2013Other cases progress rapidly, developing glaucoma and metastases over a short timescale (Fig. 9.45\n)\u2013At this time, there is no good way to predict the likely progression of disease in individual cats\n\u25aaThis unpredictable progression makes it hard to offer advice on when to enucleate:\u2013Some clinicians will remove a globe when they document any evidence of continued growth and progression of pigmented lesions, while others will wait until glaucoma develops\u2013Cats with early FDIM at the time of enucleation, that generally have not yet developed glaucoma, survive at the same rate as unaffected cats\u2013It is very difficult to accurately estimate the rate of metastatic disease in affected cats. Obtaining documented evidence of metastatic disease may be confounded by long periods of latency in many cases\u25cbMost cats with documented metastatic disease had advanced disease, i.e., Extension of the neoplasm beyond the iris and/or neoplastic cells within the scleral venous plexus, at the time of enucleation\n\u2013Metastasis occurs more often to the abdominal cavity/abdominal organs than to the lungs\u2013Recurrence in the orbit may also occur\n\u25aaFDIM demonstrates a tremendous degree of variation in cellular morphology. Within this spectrum of disease, a number of histopathological variants are recognized (Fig. 9.46\n):\u2013Round cell or polygonal cell\u25cbMost common\n\u2013Spindle cell\u2013Balloon cell\u25cbLarge melanocytes with vacuolated cytoplasm and round, central nuclei\n\u2013Anaplastic variants\u2013Giant cells\n\u25aa\nAmelanotic variants are often clinically mistaken for inflammatory disease\u25aaNot all cases are strictly diffuse in the iris. Variations in tumor distribution occur where the neoplasm exists as solid localized masses or other cases which are primarily in the ciliary body or even the choroid\u25aaAlthough uveal melanomas have been experimentally induced in cats by feline sarcoma virus infection, there is no compelling evidence to support an important role for retrovirus infection in the spontaneous development of feline anterior uveal melanoma\n\u2022Feline atypical melanoma (Fig. 9.47\n)\u25aaThis is an uncommon variant of uveal melanoma in cats:\u2013There are only 23 cases in the COPLOW collection, representing only 1% of feline neoplasms in the collection\n\u25aaThese are multifocal masses composed entirely of very heavily pigmented round cells, with bland small round nuclei only visible on bleached sections\u2013The tumors are distributed throughout the uvea and may involve the iris but, in contrast to FDIM, they are not centered on the iris\u2013A characteristic feature, seen in most cases, is the appearance of aggregates of tumor cells on the retinal pigment epithelium, filling the sub-retinal space and extending into the retina\n\u25aaDespite the bland cellular features, several of these neoplasms have metastasized\n\u2022Equine anterior uveal melanocytic neoplasms\u25aaThere are 17 cases of equine intraocular melanocytic neoplasia in the COPLOW collection\u25aaAlthough dermal melanocytic neoplasia is common in horses, equine ocular melanocytic neoplasms are rare, with few reports in the veterinary literature\u25aaReported cases have generally shown benign histological characteristics.\n\nComparative CommentsUveal malignant melanoma is the most common primary intraocular tumor in adult humans, with an incidence in the United States of approximately six cases per million. These occur predominantly in the choroid (85%) with about 10% in the ciliary body and 5% in the iris.Except in the iris, uveal malignant melanoma is a highly aggressive tumor, and about half of patients with this type die with metastatic disease within 10\u201315 years of diagnosis.In 1931, Colonel George R. Callender at the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology classified these tumors into six types, based on the morphology of the tumor cells. A modified Callender classification continues to be used for the cytologic classification of these tumors.\u2022The major categories are spindle cell nevus; spindle cell melanoma; epithelioid melanoma; and mixed-cell type (mixture of spindle and epithelioid cells). This classification has proved less useful in tumors in other species.\n\n",

However, reports are too sparse to allow an estimate of the prevalence of this neoplasm\n\u2022Medulloepithelioma often occurs in young animals but there are many exceptions:\u25aaFor example, only 7 of the 24 canine in cases in the COPLOW archive are from dogs less then 5 years old\n\u2022In dogs, the tumors usually originate in the ciliary body and can extend to involve the retina, whereas in horses some of the tumors originate in the optic nerve\u2022Morphologic features of medulloepithelioma:\u25aaThe tumors are delicate, often multiple white masses, often within the posterior chamber, and they can be locally infiltrative\u25aaTumors often have papillary or botryoid extensions within the aqueous humor and, in some cases, can seed the anterior chamber with miliary, small nodular metastatic foci\u25aaTumors tend to show a pattern of survival around blood vessels with extensive necrosis away from vessels\u25aaThe hallmark histological feature is the formation of rosettes\u2013Flexner\u2013Wintersteiner rosettes and Homer\u2013Wright rosettes are also seen in retinoblastoma and other PNET Tumors and are not specific for medulloepitheliomas\u2013\nLarger, more complex multi-layered rosettes or tube structures lined by columnar neuroblastic cells are the defining feature of medulloepithelioma\n\u25aaAlthough medulloepithelioma is locally invasive it is only rarely metastatic.\n\nComparative Comments\n\u2022Tumors of the retinal pigment epithelium and the epithelium of the ciliary body and iris are uncommon in humans and, in general, parallel the description given for other species. These may take the form of adenomas or adenocarcinomas\u2022Medulloepitheliomas (dictyomas) are congenital neuroepithelial tumors arising from primitive medullary epithelium and are usually located in the ciliary body. Although some of these tumors appear histologically malignant, most have a relatively benign course if confined to the eye\u2022Fuchs adenomas are benign proliferations of the nonpigmented ciliary epithelium. These are usually an incidental finding at autopsy or enucleation and rarely have clinical significance.\n\n",

The round cell variant of FPTOS is distinguished from feline uveal lymphoma unrelated to trauma by its wide distribution in the globe, presence of lens capsule rupture, extent of necrosis and history. This tumor, which is also a form of lymphoma, is discussed in greater detail in Chapter 5 and later in this chapter.\n\u2022The average age of affected cats is 9.8 years and there is no breed predilection. The FeLV/FIV status of affected cats is not often recorded in the COPLOW archive, however, there is no reason to believe that cats with uveal lymphoma are commonly infected by either retrovirus\u2022Approximately half of feline uveal lymphomas are seen in combination with lympho-plasmacytic uveitis:\u25aaThe relationship between lymphoma and inflammation is not clear\u25aaLymphoma in association with uveitis is less likely to clearly express markers of T-cell or B-cell differentiation. However, these neoplasms are just as likely to impact lifespan/survival\n\u2022Based on limited follow-up information available, uveal lymphoma generally represents a systemic rather than localized disease process. However, ocular disease is frequently the presenting complaint and may precede signs of systemic involvement\u25aaThis experience suggests that chemotherapy may be warranted in cats following enucleation of a globe that appears to be affected in isolation\n\u2022\nThe most common ocular tissue to be involved is the anterior uvea (iris and ciliary body). Uveal involvement may be nodular or diffuse. However, the retina, choroid, cornea (particularly the limbal region), adnexa, peripheral nerve tissue or optic nerve may also be affected\u2022The ciliary body epithelium is often distorted by an infiltrate of neoplastic cells, a feature which may prove useful in making the distinction between lymphoma and melanoma, as melanoma is unlikely to specifically affect the ciliary body epithelium\u2022Immunohistochemical labeling of leukocyte differentiation antigens and/or melanocytic markers can also help to distinguish between lymphoma and amelanotic melanoma\u25aaThere is not enough information to draw conclusions regarding the significance of immunophenotyping of feline ocular lymphoma.
