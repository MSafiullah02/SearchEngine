This randomized sequence was then substituted into the corresponding position of the target sequence by overlap PCR using mutagenic primers harboring the randomized sequences. The target and false target sequences used in this study are detailed in Supplementary Table T2. Plasmid preparation. Target sequences for MERS1B, HF183 and FN1868 were purchased as gene blocks from IDT. A T7 RNA polymerase promoter was included upstream of the FN1868 target to enable RNA transcription. The target sequences for NRP2 and BRAF were built by overlap PCR using Phusion DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs (NEB), Ipswich, MA, USA). The gene blocks and agarose gel-purified PCR products were cloned into pCR2.1TOPO plasmid (Thermo Fisher, Waltham, MA, USA) by Gibson assembly using the 2X Gibson master mix from NEB and the manufacturer's protocol.

Briefly, use of a forward PCR primer termed 'HF183' along with a relatively flexible set of reverse primers, such as BacR287, BFDRev, BthetR1 25,26 , has been standardized for monitoring human fecal contamination of environmental water.

Briefly, each qPCR reaction contained 3.5 \u03bcl of Primer/Probe mix (0.093 \u03bcM TaqMan probe, 1.2 \u03bcM BthetR1 primer and 1.2 \u03bcM HF183-1 primer), 6 \u03bcl water and 12.5 \u03bcl 2\u00d7FastStart Essential DNA Probes Master (Roche, NC, U.S.A.). To this mixture 3 \u03bcl of water, or pure plasmid templates or sewage-contaminated water samples were added. The qPCR amplification and analysis was performed using the LightCycler 96 real-time PCR machine (Roche). The cycling conditions included 2 min of pre-heating at 50 \u00b0C followed by 10 min of preheating at 95 \u00b0C, and then 50 cycles of 15 sec at 95 \u00b0C followed by 1 min at 60 \u00b0C. All experiments were performed at least in triplicate for statistical analysis. a Sequences in green represent OSD-binding sites in true targets. Sequences shown in red represent the corresponding randomized region in false targets that lack complementarity to OSD reporters. Figure S1 . Effect of OSD concentration on the HF183 LAMP reaction. A) Realtime fluorescence accumulation in HF183 LAMP reactions with different amounts of OSD reporters. All other reaction conditions remained constant. B) Effect of HF183 OSD concentration on endpoint fluorescence of LAMP. Background-subtracted endpoint fluorescence values from plot A are depicted. C) Influence of OSD concentration on the time-to-signal (Ct) of HF183 LAMP-OSD reaction.",
