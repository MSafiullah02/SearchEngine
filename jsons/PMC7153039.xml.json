TracheitisTracheitis is defined as an acute infection or inflammation of the trachea. Bacterial tracheitis is an acute croup-like bacterial infection of the upper airway in children, with coughing and high fever, while viral tracheitis is often part of an acute viral infection that typically involves the larynx as well as the upper and lower respiratory tract. EpiglottitisEpiglottitis is an acute bacterial infection of the epiglottis and surrounding supraglottic tissues. Most cases of pediatric epiglottitis were once caused by Haemophilus influenzae serotype B, an infection nearly eliminated from all areas of the world where H. influenzae serotype B vaccination programs are in place. Currently, epiglottitis still occurs sporadically across all age groups with Staphylococcus aureus accounting for most disease beyond the age of 5 years.\n",

Most cases of acute laryngitis are caused by viruses (\u25d8 Fig. 7.1). Adenoviruses and influenza viruses are most commonly implicated, but infection with any of the common respiratory viruses can manifest as laryngitis. Acute bacterial laryngitis is rare in the era of vaccination, but one may encounter cases of acute diphtheria in unimmunized populations, particularly with growing vaccine hesitancy in the United States and Europe. When laryngitis presents as a chronic condition, an underlying viral etiology is possible, but a noninfectious etiology is far more likely. The differential diagnosis for chronic laryngitis includes trauma, allergic or chemical inflammation, tumor infiltration, and congenital anomalies.\n",

Nonspecific features of an upper respiratory infection are commonly present including nasal congestion, sore throat, and cough. Patients may complain that it hurts to speak. Viruses that cause laryngitis can also cause croup as the infection spreads to the more distal, adjacent airway structures. A more insidious presentation of laryngitis occurs following the vertical transmission of human papillomaviruses (HPV) from mother to child. The presence of a maternal infection with a low-oncogenic-risk HPV type (most commonly HPV type 6) at the time of birth puts the newborn at risk for infection whether the mother has visible genital condylomata or not. Exposed infants may develop HPV infection in or around their vocal cords with subsequent growth of papillomas. Presenting signs and symptoms mimic viral croup, but do not completely resolve. Direct visualization using nasopharyngeal laryngoscopy is diagnostic. Surgical ablation using laser energy reduces the size of the lesions, but recurrences are expected. Recurrent respiratory papillomatosis mimics croup, and is caused by a virus, but it is a unique entity that can be very challenging to manage.",

Anatomically, the subglottic diameter and circumference correlate with the age and size of the child. The smaller diameters make very young children prone to the obstructive process caused by infection-associated edema. The incidence of croup is highest among children between 3 months and 3 years of age. Outbreaks of croup typically occur in the fall and early winter just preceding the onset of RSV and influenza disease (\u25d8 Fig. 7.2). Parainfluenza viruses types 1, 2, and 3 account for nearly 80% of all cases (\u25d8 Fig. 7.3). Influenza A and B viruses can cause severe LTB and are more commonly associated with the development of secondary bacterial tracheitis and pneumonia caused by Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis [1]. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and other common respiratory viruses, such as adenoviruses, rhinoviruses, human metapneumoviruses, human bocaviruses, and human coronaviruses (NL63 in particular), are less common causes of acute viral croup.\n\n",

Varying degrees of inspiratory stridor become apparent, sometimes associated with tachypnea. These symptoms generally start abruptly and are typically worse at night (see \u25ba Box 7.2). Most children with croup have low-grade fever (generally \u2264101 \u00b0F) and do not appear toxic, but some of the viral causes, particularly parainfluenza virus type 3, have the potential to cause higher fever. The progression of disease is variable among children. Most gradually recover over the course of 3\u20137 days. Severe disease requiring endotracheal intubation is unusual, occurring in fewer than 2% of cases.

Despite its widespread use, no clinical benefit was noted from studies of children seen in acute care settings. In contrast, a recent Cochrane review [3] concluded that a single dose of corticosteroids should be used to treat most children with croup. Corticosteroid treatment is associated with a shorter duration of stay in the emergency department or in the hospital, if admitted, fewer hospitalizations, and fewer return visits to emergency departments. Most experts currently recommend the use of dexamethasone which can be administered orally, intravenously, or intramuscularly. Nebulized budesonide has also been used. Nebulized racemic epinephrine is also effective at achieving temporary symptomatic improvement in children with moderate to severe croup [4]. While the treatment is safe, there may be transient side adverse effects such as pallor and tachycardia. Many institutions have developed their own algorithms for the management of pediatric croup in the acute outpatient setting. One excellent algorithm for the assessment and management of croup can be found at \u25ba www.topalbertadoctors.org/download/252/croup_guideline.pdf (Appendix A, accessed June 27, 2017).",

Her 3-year-old child had a runny nose and cough yesterday but woke up a few minutes ago from coughing so hard and is now making a scary sound when he is trying to breathe in, like he cannot get any air. You ask several questions to assess the severity of his illness, which you suspect to be croup. She says he is awake and is not \u201cblue,\u201d but he is making a whistling sound when he breathes in. His chest is \u201csucking inward.\u201d Based on these features, you conclude that he probably has moderate croup and would benefit from an evaluation in the local emergency department (ED). On arrival to the local ED, the boy\u2019s respiratory rate is 40 breaths per minute, and his oxygen saturation in room air is 94%. He has inspiratory stridor that worsens when he becomes agitated during the physical examination. He has some intercostal and supraclavicular retractions. A dose of dexamethasone is administered followed by a respiratory treatment with aerosolized racemic epinephrine. After the respiratory treatment is done, his symptoms are improved. His respiratory rate is now normal at 25 breaths per minute, and his oxygen saturation in room air is 98%. His retractions are improved, and stridor is absent. After 4 h of observation, his symptoms did not recur, so he is discharged home with specific guidance on reasons to return to the ED.",

The early signs and symptoms of cough, congestion, and rhinorrhea, with or without fever, persist as the infant or child begins to wheeze and exhibit varying degrees of respiratory distress. The onset of wheezing and tachypnea heralds the development of lower respiratory tract involvement. Young children are particularly prone to bronchiolitis with wheezing because smaller airways are more prone to partial or complete obstruction when they become inflamed and filled with mucous. Shifting areas of local obstruction and mucous plugging results in air trapping that can usually be appreciated on chest radiography as hyperinflation and atelectasis (\u25d8 Fig. 7.6) and is, at least in part, responsible for the diffuse wheezing heard on chest auscultation. Tachypnea, with respiratory rates of 100 breaths per minute or more, is not uncommon and will eventually impede the infant\u2019s ability to adequately feed. Oxygen saturation, as measured by pulse oximetry, can vary minute to minute due to shifting areas of mucous plugging and atelectasis that lead to varying degrees of ventilation to perfusion mismatch [7]. On clinical grounds, viral bronchiolitis and viral pneumonia are difficult to distinguish from one another since they represent a spectrum of lower respiratory tract illness that exist on a continuum. Accurately distinguishing between the two is not clinically important since the approach to patient management is the same.\n",
