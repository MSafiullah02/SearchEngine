The positive rate of CK-MB had no difference between the mild, severe, and critical groups. While the positive rate of MYO, ultra-TnI, and NT-proBNP is higher in severe cases and critical cases as compared with mild cases, the differences among the groups were statistically significant (P < .05). After a pairwise comparison by Bonferroni correction, it was observed that the levels of NT-proBNP and MYO were significant increased in severe cases and critical cases compared with mild cases (P < .0167), but no difference between severe cases and critical cases (P > .0167). The increase of ultra-TnI only showed a significant difference between the mild cases and severe cases (P < .0167), while there was no difference between mild and critical cases and severe and critical cases (P > .0167). Thus, the increased concentration in venous blood of MYO, ultra-TnI, and NT-proBNP were associated with the severity of COVID-19. Then, we analyzed these four heart injury parameters between the death (n = 24) and alive (246 recovered and 3 still in hospital at severe situation). All four parameters were significantly higher in the death than in the alive group (P < .001) ( Figure 2 ).",
