Infectious diseases pose major risks to the human life and social development. In recent years, various infectious diseases such as H1N1 and SARS have caused thousands of deaths and severe economic loss. Most of the infectious diseases can be transmitted from one person to another through personal contacts. With rapidly growing global transportations, infectious diseases that formerly die out in isolated areas may now spread worldwide. In order to stop infectious diseases from spreading, a number of interventions are available with distinct benefits or drawbacks. They either directly impact the transmission of diseases so that the viruses/germs cannot easily spread through the population, or immunize segments of a population. Considering the time that interventions are applied, strategies for controlling epidemic diseases can be classified into two categories: 1) preventive disease control that takes place before a disease occurs in a population; and 2) reactive disease control that stops a disease from spreading out after the disease outbreak is detected in a population. Reactive strategies focus on individuals who are already infected and their close friends to protect healthy people from being infected. Preventive strategies, on the other hand, identify people at high infection risks to take vaccines, so that the disease can be prevented from spreading out or even happening in a population.",

In particular, we attempt to immunize a small number of people who are in danger in advance, so that we can prevent them from developing deadly infections and spreading to others. Such preventive vaccination strategies are widely used to prevent diseases, i.e., people are encouraged to take flu shot before the flu season starts. However, current preventive disease control mainly relies on mass vaccination strategy, which intends to immunize a major fraction of a population, leading to a high economic expense and adverse side effects. Moreover, due to production cycle and population growth, vaccines are often in short supply, making the mass vaccination ineligible for a number of occasions. In light of the problems above, we aim to select individuals to receive vaccines in advance based on information extracted from people's daily life data stream, so that the number of people infected will be minimized if the population is exposed to a disease later.",

The latter has been widely adopted in many recent works due to the rising of the idea of viral marketing, where commercial messages are sent to people who are socially important in order to achieve marketing objectives. In this paper, on the contrary, we try to minimize the diffusion of disease, rather than maximizing the spreading of a piece of information. In particular, we show that our minimization problem is NP-hard, and can be solved by an approximation algorithm following the information cascade model. Our approach is evaluated over real world data set. The results demonstrate that the proposed target immunization outperforms other strategies in providing protection over the population.",

In this section, we review the most related work along these directions. Disease propagation has been studied for a long time in human contact networks [1] [2] [3] , where human beings are interpreted as nodes and their interactions are edges connecting nodes. Various mathematical models have been developed to characterize the disease transmission in a contact network. Most of the existing models [4] , [5] describe the spread of disease in a homogeneously mixed network, where an infected individual infects each of his/her neighbors in a uniformly random and independent way. Under the constraint of fixed network size, differential equations can be written down to represent the movement of disease in a network, from which the number of infected people can be estimated. However, in real world, an infected person does not infect his contacts with an equal probability, as the length and the nature of the interactions among people can vary greatly from one to another. In recent years, a few investigations have been made to study the impact of variations in degree, infectiousness, and closeness of interactions. For instance, different network topologies such as sparse networks [6] , clustered networks [2] , and power-law networks [7] , have been examined for their effect on disease propagation process. In this research, we construct a contact network based on social communications, and model the spread of disease as a function of the social relationship between individuals.",

Among them, a large body of research has addressed the problem of viral marketing [11, 12] , where the social connections are used to spread the product information to achieve business objectives. The work by [13] studies the information propagation in social networks using two information diffusion models: independent cascade (IC) and linear threshold. The paper proves the NP-hardness of the problem of finding a small number of influential nodes as initial information adopters to maximize the expected number of nodes that would adopt the information. In contrast to influence maximization (i.e., recent research on viral marketing mentioned above) that attracts attention from finance and social network communities, influence minimization has relatively been less investigated. Misinformation such as scams, false twitter or facebook posts, have led to enormous social and economic issues. In order to minimize the impact of misinformation, researchers have considered to block critical nodes to prevent the false message from spreading out. Such an idea has been applied in a number of contexts. In this work, we consider a similar minimization problem which we prove it to be NP-hard.",

The initial infection ratio is defined as the total number of infected persons on the first day divided by the size of the population. The initial infected persons are chosen randomly in our simulations. We report our experimental results by an average of 50 runs. Fig. 1 reports the final infection ratio vs. the number of available vaccines, where we fix q to be 0.003, and the infection probability p to be 0.05. From the results, we observe that the final infection ratio declines as the number of available vaccines increases. When the number of people who receive vaccines is growing, more people are protected, and therefore the number of infected nodes is decreasing. Overall, the target vaccination strategies (degree and the proposed strategy) achieve a lower number of infected nodes than the random strategy, which is consistent with the previous work [15] , [16] , [3] whose strategies have resulted in less number of infections than the random strategy with the same cost of vaccines. The proposed strategy achieves the lowest final infection ratio when the number of available vaccines is less than 1000, and has almost the same final infection ratio as the degree strategy when the number of vaccines is larger than 1000. The results demonstrate that compared to the other two strategies, the proposed method protects more people with the same number of vaccines when there is a limited supply of vaccines.",

In general, target vaccination strategies perform better than the random strategy, which is consistent with the results in Fig. 1 .

This is reasonable because for a single infected node, the number of nodes that might be infected by this node is a monotonically increasing function of the infection probability. Since AV G(A \u2212 ) is the sum of the expected number of nodes infected by each node in A \u2212 , it is also increasing as the infection probability ones. Our proposed strategy outperforms the other two under different p, again confirming the superiority of the proposed strategy to existing strategies. However, as the infection probability rises up, the superiority of the proposed strategy becomes less apparent. It can be observed that the performance differences among all the three strategies decline when the infection probability goes up.

Then our goal is to find A of K nodes for vaccination, so that AV G(A \u2212 ) is minimized. Notice here AV G(A \u2212 )measures the sum of the expected number of nodes infected by each node in A \u2212 , not the sum of the union of the expected number of nodes infected, in case that the nodes infected/influenced by i \u2208 A \u2212 and the nodes infected/influenced by j \u2208 A \u2212 overlap. The definition of AV G(A \u2212 ) is based on the consideration that we attempt to minimize the impact of disease no matter which node the disease starts with. Then the problem can be mathematically described as: min A\u2286V AV G(A \u2212 ) s.t |A| = K",
