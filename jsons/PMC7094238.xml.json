Bioterrorism represents another risk of exposure to emerging diseases through the intentional use of biological agents\u2014military grade and adapted naturally found pathogens.1, 4 As such, there are numerous emerging infectious threats that are suitable for an entire edition of Disease-a-Month to address. Global travel, immigration into the U.S. from countries with endemic illnesses not commonly found in North America, and societal factors (domestic and international) that include poverty, homelessness, institutionalization, overcrowding, and lack of access to health care set the stage to create conditions that facilitate the emergence and spread of previously unknown, little recognized, or emerging illnesses that are endemic to or novel strains in foreign lands that can become very quickly clinical realities to the United States.1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7\n",

Evidence from subsequent outbreaks of H5N1 in Vietnam suggest changes in the virus consistent with this possibility. Of the latter two, the FDA recently approved an H5N1 vaccine, and H5N1 remains at the present inefficient at person-to-person transmission, albeit it is likely to acquire that ability given the adaptability of this virus. During that year, several persons became infected with an avian influenza strain that resulted in significant illness in chickens and resulted in the almost total destruction of Hong Kong poultry flocks in an attempt to contain the disease. It was a successful strategy, for the moment.",

A new Euro-African lineage of H5N1 has resulted in several fatal human infections in Egypt by 2007.11, 12 Genetically the virus is becoming more antigenically diverse and forming distinguishable groupings.

SARS CoV is believed to be an animal virus that crossed the species barrier to humans, perhaps as a result of ecological changes or human behaviors that placed people in greater proximity to coronavirus that lead to viral adaptation and subsequent human to human transmission. By July 2003, SARS CoV spread internationally and resulted in over 8000 cases in 26 countries with 774 deaths reported.13 Although WHO considers the world to be in an inter-epidemic period, it remains difficult to predict when or if another SARS will emerge, let alone cause another outbreak, especially given that the natural reservoir of SARS CoV has not been identified or contained.",
