In actual practice not all countries introduce a new ICD revision at the same time: as a consequence in international studies endpoints such as causes of deaths need to be classified, for the sake of comparability, by the oldest ICD version in use among participating countries, underusing the more detailed and updated information available from countries employing more recent ICD versions. For instance pleural mesothelioma, a critical endpoint in occupational or environmental studies on asbestos and mineral fibers, was not precisely identified as such until the tenth ICD revision (1990) [3]. Mostly affected by reclassification is the interpretation of long-term time trends of diseases incidence and mortality. A by now classic example [4] is the delayed recognition, met with surprise, of the downturn in the ischemic heart disease mortality occurring in the USA in the 1960s. An obscuring effect had been introduced by the change from the seventh to the new (eight) ICD revision, deaths previously and separately assigned to arteriosclerotic heart disease by the seventh revision being merged into the ischemic heart disease category by the eight.",

A clear example is given by tuberculosis (TB), still today causing 1.6 million deaths worldwide. The contagious nature of \u201cphtisis\u201d had been recognized at least since the sixteen century by Gerolamo Fracastoro [5], but it took until the end of the nineteen century to grasp the relation between its various organ-specific manifestations (lung, lymphatic glands, spine, meninges, or the whole body in miliary TB). At the turn of the century Strumpell\u2019s authoritative textbook [6] affirmatively stated: [my italic]: \u201ctoday the definition of TB is not based on anatomic grounds. TB is every affection produced by the pathogenic action of a specific bacterial variety, namely by the TB bacilli discovered by Koch\u201d. On that ground the variety of clinical presentations could be etiologically lumped together, paving the way to treatments directly attacking the Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Yet in recent years the need for a new, therapy dependent, split has emerged leading to the disease category of a MDR/RR-TB, multi-drug or rifampicin resistant variant of TB [7], estimated to involve about 5% of previously untreated TB cases and some 20% of TBs previously treated, and originating from de novo bacterial chromosome mutations [8]. Similar splitting-and-lumping patterns, already elegantly discussed in a 1969 paper by Victor McKusick [9] in the context of genetic diseases, can be found within all broad nosological classes. In its most recent edition the WHO/IARC Classification of Tumours [10] explicitly includes genetic information to identify distinct categories of cancers. For example some varieties of acute myeloid leukemia are defined by recurrent chromosomal aberrations and others by specific somatic gene mutations. With the availability of effective treatments response to treatment becomes a key criterion to categorize disease types. It also inspires the search for new, hopefully effective, treatments in \u201cbasket trials\u201d [11]: in oncology patients with cancers originating in different organs but sharing some common genetic alterations receive pharmacological agents specifically targeted on those alterations, potentially opening the way to lumping together these cancers as different manifestations of a common disease, defined by a somatic genetic profile responsive to specific agents.",
