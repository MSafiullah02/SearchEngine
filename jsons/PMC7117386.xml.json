            "text": "Porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV), a member of the genus Deltacoronavirus in the family Coronaviridae of the order Nidovirales, causes acute diarrhea, vomiting, dehydration and mortality in nursing pigs (Jung et al., 2015b; Lau et al., 2012). PDCoV has been successfully isolated and propagated in two epithelial cell lines of swine origin, LLC porcine kidney (LLC-PK) and swine testicular (ST) cells (Hu et al., 2015). The optimal cell culture conditions to isolate and propagate PDCoV in LLC-PK and ST cells required supplementation of 10 \u03bcg/ml of trypsin and 1% pancreatin in the cell culture maintenance medium, respectively (Hu et al., 2015). The addition of trypsin and pancreatin in the PDCoV-inoculated LLC-PK and ST cells, respectively, resulted in similar cytopathic effects (CPE) that consisted of enlarged, rounded, and densely granular cells that occurred singly or in clusters, followed by cell shrinkage and detachment as a result of apoptotic cell death (Jung et al., 2016). On the other hand, infected enterocytes in vivo appeared to acutely undergo vacuolar degeneration and exfoliated extensively from the villous epithelium, followed by villous atrophy (Chen et al., 2015; Jung et al., 2015b). This process might be associated with necrosis of the infected enterocytes (Jung et al., 2016).",

The cells were originally isolated from the mid-jejunal epithelium of a neonatal unsuckled piglet in 1989 at the University of North Carolina (Brosnahan and Brown, 2012; Vergauwen, 2015). Because of the significant physiologic and morphologic similarities to enterocytes in vivo, this primary cell line has been used increasingly to characterize the interactions of intestinal epithelial cells with enteric bacteria and viruses in vitro. IPEC-J2 cells have been infected with porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) and transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) (Lin et al., 2017; Shi et al., 2017; Xia et al., 2017; Zhao et al., 2014). Compared with PEDV-infected Vero (African green monkey kidney) cells (Guo et al., 2016), the proteomic data from PEDV-infected IPEC-J2 cells appeared to better coincide with the physiologic and pathologic outcomes in PEDV-infected enterocytes in vivo (Lin et al., 2017).",

However, IPEC-J2 cells failed to efficiently support the isolation and propagation of PDCoV, despite the fact that IPEC-J2 cells originate from villous enterocytes in the small intestine that are the main site of PDCoV infection in vivo. We hypothesized that the lower susceptibility of IPEC-J2 cells to initial infection with PDCoV, compared with LLC-PK or ST cells, could have been increased if virus of higher titer, than that contained in the original fecal samples (Hu et al., 2015), was used as inoculum in IPEC-J2 cells. Therefore, we used the cell culture-adapted PDCoV to investigate: i) whether porcine IPEC-J2 cells are susceptible to infection with cell culture-adapted PDCoV; ii) the cell death mechanism, necrosis or apoptosis, by which PDCoV causes death of infected IPEC-J2 cells in vitro; iii) if the cell death of PDCoV-infected IPEC-J2 cells in vitro resembles necrosis of infected enterocytes in vivo; and iv) whether PDCoV infection induces altered or increased pro-inflammatory or innate cytokine responses in supernatants of IPEC-J2 cells in vitro and in the serum of infected gnotobiotic (Gn) pigs in vivo. For the in vivo study, we inoculated Gn piglets with the IPEC-J2 cell culture-passaged PDCoV to examine the enteropathogenicity and the induction of innate and pro-inflammatory cytokines in the sera during the acute PDCoV infection.",

The SPF herd was seronegative for antibodies to porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus, porcine respiratory coronavirus, transmissible gastroenteritis virus and porcine circovirus type 2. Six 10-day-old Gn piglets were randomly assigned to one of two groups: PDCoV-inoculated (n = 2; pigs 1 and 2) and mock-inoculated (n = 4; pigs 3\u20136). Pigs were inoculated orally with 2 ml [8.7 log10 genomic equivalents (GE) per pig] of the IPEC-J2 cell culture-passaged PDCoV OH-FD22-P8-I-P4 [passage 4 in IPEC-J2 cells (P4); 8.4 log10 GE/ml], or mock inoculated with MEM. After PDCoV inoculation, the pigs were monitored frequently for clinical signs. PDCoV-inoculated and the negative control pigs were monitored for fecal virus shedding and viremia by qRT-PCR at post-inoculation days (PID) 1 to 5 and then euthanized for pathological examination at PID 5. However, the negative control pigs 4\u20136 were euthanized at PID 3 to establish other immunologic assays using mononuclear cells isolated from the small intestine.

After trypsinization, the detached IPEC-J2 cells were spin down by centrifugation; however, the pelleted cells appeared more adhesive and clumped, relative to immortalized cell lines of epithelial cell origin. Therefore, prior to the infection assays using the cells, we attempted to confirm that no other types of cells were present, such as spindle-shaped (or fusiform) smooth muscle cells constituting connective tissue, the mucus-secreting goblet cells, or the neutrotransmitter serotonin-secreting enterochromaffin cells in the IPEC-J2 cell monolayers by light microscopy (or PAS staining) or IF staining at PIH 24, 48, and 72 (different stages of cell differentiation). These types of cells are anatomically located in the lamina propria (smooth muscle cell), or villous (goblet cell) or crypt (enterochromaffin cell) epithelium of the mid-jejunum, from which the IPEC-J2 cells were isolated (Brosnahan and Brown, 2012; Vergauwen, 2015). By light microscopic examination, there were no fusiform (or fibrous) cells, but only polygonal, homogenous cells at PIH 24\u201372. By IF, there were also neither goblet cells positive for Periodic-Acid-Schiff staining, nor enterochromaffin cells positive for serotonin in the IPEC-J2 cell monolayers at PIH 24\u201372. Consistent with the previous reports (Brosnahan and Brown, 2012; Vergauwen, 2015), the IPEC-J2 cells appeared to consist mostly of intestinal absorptive (non-secretory) villous enterocytes. However, a recent study reported that the non-homogeneity of the IPEC-J2 cells that they observed might be associated with little or no susceptibility of the cells to PEDV infection, and that only the subcloned IPEC-J2 cells became susceptible to PEDV infection (Zhang et al., 2018). Nevertheless, it is critical to note that IPEC-J2 cells have been infected successfully with PEDV, as reported previously (Lin et al., 2017; Shi et al., 2017; Zhao et al., 2014). The IPEC-J2 cells also showed the ability to continuously differentiate into daughter cells, as also was supported by IF staining, showing large numbers of IPEC-J2 cells positive for the intestinal stem cell (or crypt cell) marker, LGR5 at PIH 24\u201372 (Supplemental Fig. S1).",

Furthermore, supplemental trypsin (5 \u03bcg/ml) in the cell culture medium also led to the successful growth of PEDV in IPEC-J2 cells (Shi et al., 2017). Based on these observations, prior to the supplementation of trypsin in the IPEC-J2 cell culture medium, we investigated if virus titers differ between PDCoV-inoculated IPEC-J2 cells supplemented with lower vs. higher concentrations of trypsin. An MOI of 2.5 of PDCoV OH-FD22-P8 was used for inoculation of IPEC-J2 cell monolayers in 6-well plates supplemented with two different concentrations of trypsin (2.5 vs. 10 \u03bcg/ml) in the cell culture medium. Negative controls included cells treated with no virus but trypsin. Washing was done after virus adsorption for 1 h, as described previously (Hu et al., 2015), and 2 ml of maintenance medium supplemented with trypsin was added. Cell culture supernatants were collected to analyze PDCoV RNA titers by qRT-PCR at PIH 20, 42, and 72. PDCoV RNA titers in trypsin (10 \u03bcg/ml)-treated, PDCoV-inoculated IPEC-J2 cells were 9.5 log10 GE/ml, 9.6 log10 GE/ml, and 9.8 log10 GE/ml at PIH 20, 42, and 72, respectively, whereas viral RNA titers in the lower trypsin (2.5 \u03bcg/ml)-treated, PDCoV-inoculated IPEC-J2 cells were lower (8.5 log10 GE/ml, 9.1 log10 GE/ml, and 9.3 log10 GE/ml at PIH 20, 42, and 72, respectively). However, neither of the PDCoV-inoculated, trypsin-treated groups showed CPE at PIH 20-72. None of the cell culture supernatants from the PDCoV-uninoculated, trypsin-treated negative controls were positive for PDCoV RNA at PIH 20-72. Based on these observations, the supplemental trypsin in the cell culture medium appeared to be beneficial for the growth of PDCoV in the IPEC-J2 cells. Therefore, maintenance medium was supplemented consistently with 10 \u03bcg/ml of trypsin during further serial passages of PDCoV in the IPEC-J2 cells. However, our study did not define either the optimal concentration of trypsin for growth of PDCoV in the IPEC-J2 cells, or the maximum concentration of trypsin tolerated by the IPEC-J2 cells.",

For the 2nd passage, like the 1st passage, no CPE was observed by 4\u20135 days after virus inoculation. Therefore, for the 3rd passage of the virus, the following modifications in the procedure were tested to improve PDCoV growth and observe CPE: i) omitting washing of the cells after virus adsorption or ii) omitting removal of the inoculum. When the wash step was omitted, inoculated cells showed no CPE until PIH 24, but at PIH 48, most of cells were detached (> 90%) and most of the detached cells appeared rounded and shrunken. The PDCoV RNA titer of the cell culture supernatant was 10.5 log10 GE/ml at PIH 48. On the other hand, when the removal of the inoculum was omitted, no CPE was found for 4 days after inoculation. However, a high PDCoV RNA titer of 9.0 log10 GE/ml was still observed in the cell culture supernatant at PIH 48. These observations support the necessity for optimal trypsin concentrations in the MMT for PDCoV-induced CPE in IPEC-J2 cells. For continuous serial passages, the wash step was also omitted.",

            "text": "Based on our data, IPEC-J2 cells are susceptible to infection with PDCoV, like for the other enteric CoVs, PEDV and TGEV (Guo et al., 2016; Lin et al., 2017; Shi et al., 2017; Xia et al., 2017; Zhao et al., 2014). Compared with LLC-PK or ST cells, our previous study revealed no or less susceptibility of IPEC-J2 cells to PDCoV infection using feces or intestinal contents or tissues of PDCoV-infected pigs (Hu et al., 2015). However, our current study verified that PDCoV previously grown in other swine cell cultures such as LLC-PK cells can be propagated and passaged in IPEC-J2 cells. Recently, porcine aminopeptidase N (pAPN) was identified as a major cell entry receptor for PDCoV (Li et al., 2018; Wang et al., 2018; Zhu et al., 2018). Therefore, possible differences in pAPN expression levels among the LLC-PK, ST, and IPEC-J2 cells of swine origin could influence their susceptibility to infection with PDCoV. Supplementation of 10 \u03bcg/ml of trypsin and 1% pancreatin in the cell culture maintenance medium for LLC-PK and ST cells, respectively, was essential for both growth and CPE of PDCoV in these two cell lines. Similarly, we found that addition of trypsin to the cell culture maintenance medium also contributed to both growth and CPE of PDCoV in IPEC-J2 cells. It is also noteworthy that of the two modifications in the virus inoculation procedure, i) omitting washing of the cells after virus adsorption or ii) omitting removal of the inoculum, the former method was likely more efficient to improve PDCoV growth and observe CPE in our experimental conditions, compared with the latter and initial (washing of the cells after virus adsorption) methods. The approach of omitting removal of the inoculum was used to isolate PEDV from clinical samples in Vero cells (Hofmann and Wyler, 1988; Oka et al., 2014). The sensitivity of virus isolation was higher than that by the method of washing the cells after virus adsorption (Oka et al., 2014). Even after the virus adsorption procedure ended, the two modifications might have allowed cell-unbound viruses to continue to bind to the cell surface. The cell-unbound viruses might have also underwent proteolysis of the spike protein in the presence of trypsin in the cell culture maintenance medium, resulting in cell entry of PDCoV via the cellular receptor, pAPN, although optimal trypsin concentrations might be needed in the maintenance medium, as mentioned in the Results section 3.3.",

In infected LLC-PK or ST cells, CPE might be a result of apoptotic cell death, as reported previously (Jung et al., 2016). Interestingly, however, our current study revealed no positive correlation of PDCoV antigen or CPE with TUNEL signals, unlike PDCoV infection in LLC-PK or ST cells. Our double IF and TUNEL staining demonstrated that most or large numbers of the PDCoV antigen- and CPE-positive IPEC-J2 cells failed to show TUNEL-positive signals. The few TUNEL-positive signals found in the few PDCoV antigen-positive IPEC-J2 cells might be associated with increased IL-6 in PDCoV-infected IPEC-J2 cells or other undefined intrinsic apoptosis pathway inducers (Grunnet et al., 2009; Salguero et al., 2005). Based on these observations, the cell death observed in PDCoV-infected IPEC-J2 cells may not be due to apoptosis, but possibly, necrosis as a result of the cytolytic action(s) of the virus, similar to necrotic cell death observed in PDCoV-infected intestinal villous epithelial cells in vivo (Jung et al., 2016).",

Compared with the PDCoV-uninoculated, trypsin-treated negative control, IL-6 levels in the infected IPEC-J2 cells increased by 6.2- to 129-fold at PIH 48\u201396, indicating that PDCoV induces this pro-inflammatory cytokine and that IPEC-J2 cells are capable of producing IL-6.

Therefore, in our study, we inoculated Gn piglets orally with the IPEC-J2 cell culture-passaged PDCoV to define innate and pro-inflammatory cytokine profiles in the sera during the acute stage of infection as well as to confirm the enteropathogenicity in pigs. Our study verified the enteropathogenicity of the IPEC-J2 cell culture-passaged PDCoV (OH-FD22-P8-I-P4) in the inoculated Gn pigs 1 and 2, similar to that of the original (wild-type) or LLC-PK cell culture-grown OH-FD22 strain in Gn pigs (Hu et al., 2016; Jung et al., 2015b). The inoculated pigs exhibited watery diarrhea and moderate to high viral RNA titers in the feces (6.7\u201310.0 log10 GE/ml) at PID 1\u20135 and severe atrophic enteritis (jejunal VH:CD ratio of 1.3\u20131.4) at PID 5. Our current study also clearly demonstrated that predominantly innate (IFN\u03b1 and IL-22) and to a lesser extent, pro-inflammatory (TNF\u03b1, IL-6, and IL-12) cytokine levels in the sera of infected Gn pigs during acute PDCoV infection (PID 1) were increased by 33- to 390-fold and 3- to 4-fold, respectively, compared with the corresponding negative control pigs. This observation is similar to increased serum innate (IFN\u03b1 and IL-22) and pro-inflammatory (IL-6, TNF\u03b1, and IL-12) cytokine responses of 9-10-day old, Gn or conventional pigs to acute PEDV infection (Annamalai et al., 2015; Jung, Miyazaki, and Saif, unpublished). In particular, 3- to 4-fold increases in the pro-inflammatory cytokines observed in the PDCoV-infected Gn pigs 1 and 2 coincided with the decreased or loss of appetite following acute PDCoV infection in young suckling piglets (Langhans, 2000). However, the potentially beneficial or detrimental effects or roles of these innate and pro-inflammatory cytokines in PDCoV-infected piglets need to be studied further.",

Our findings also indicate the potential usefulness of IPEC-J2 cells: i) to better mimic in vivo conditions of PDCoV infection in the small intestine of pigs; ii) to study possible differences in the interactions of enterocytes with distinct swine enteric coronaviruses, PDCoV, PEDV, or TGEV; and iii) to investigate the virus-virus interactions between the viruses when co-infected in IPEC-J2 cells.

After virus adsorption, the wash step was omitted, and 15 ml of trypsin supplemented cell culture medium was added. The cell culture supernatants (1 ml per time-point) were harvested at PIHs 7, 24, 31, 48, 72, and 96. The cell culture supernatants harvested were centrifuged (1000 \u00d7 g for 10 min at 4 \u00b0C) and stored at \u221270 \u00b0C until virus quantification by a TCID50 assay (A) and cytokine quantification by ELISA (B). The samples were tested in duplicate, and cytokine levels or infectious virus titers were expressed as the mean values.",

(A) Intestine of PDCoV-inoculated pig 1 at post-inoculation day (PID) 5, showing thin and transparent intestinal walls and luminal accumulation of large amounts of watery liquid in the small [but with lack of lesions in the duodenum to proximal jejunum close to the pylorus (arrowheads)] and large intestine. (B) Hematoxylin and eosin-stained mid-jejunum of PDCoV-inoculated pig 1 at (PID) 5, showing severe atrophic enteritis. (C) Hematoxylin and eosin-stained mid-jejunum of mock-inoculated pig 3 at PID 5, showing normal villous epithelium. (D) IF-stained mid-jejunum of PDCoV-inoculated pig 1 at PID 5, showing moderate numbers of PDCoV antigen-positive cells (green color) in the villous epithelium. (E) IF-stained ileum of PDCoV-inoculated pig 1 at PID 5, showing low numbers of PDCoV antigen-positive cells (green color) in the villous epithelium.
