            "text": "Vasculitis is defined as an inflammatory process of blood vessels. It can be secondary to other conditions or constitute a primary, in most cases idiopathic disorder. Underlying conditions in the secondary vasculitides are infectious diseases [1], connective tissue diseases, and hypersensitivity disorders. Immune complexes, supposedly composed of microbial antigens in case of underlying infectious diseases, autoantigens in the connective tissue diseases, and non-microbial exogenous antigens in the hypersensitivity disorders, are involved, in many cases, in the pathophysiology of the secondary vasculitides (Table 1\n). Besides, infectious agents may directly invade the blood vessel wall leading to vasculitis [1]. The primary vasculitides, classified according to the size of the vessels involved, the histopathology of the lesions, and certain clinical symptoms (Table 2\n), are, as mentioned, considered idiopathic conditions in most of the cases. There is, however, increasing evidence that microbial agents/infections play a role in the pathogenesis of primary vasculitides as well. In this review, the role of infectious agents in the primary vasculitides will be discussed. Special attention will be given to Wegener\u2019s Granulomatosis.",

Depending on the geographical area, in particular the prevalence of HBV infection in that area, different percentages are given, but around 30% of patients with PAN are carriers of HBV [8]. Testing for HBV in patients with PAN is important as HBV infection determines clinical presentation, treatment and outcome. In patients with HBV-PAN, glomerulonephritis, ANCA-positivity, and relapsing disease are almost never found [8]. Treatment now consists of corticosteroids together with antiviral agents and plasma exchange. Treatment should be aimed at attaining seroconversion and stopping viral replication which, generally, results in complete remission of the disease without occurrence of relapses and in prevention of long-term hepatic complications [8]. PAN-like syndromes have also been reported in patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Different vasculitic syndromes can be encountered in these patients, including PAN, Kawasaki-like syndromes, primary angiitis of the central nervous system, and small vessel vasculitis [9], [10]. In many cases symptoms are not very specific and may suggest manifestations of HIV-disease itself, resulting in delay in diagnosis and treatment of the associated vasculitis.",

It has been suggested that the disease results from an abnormal immunological response to, possibly, various microbial agents in genetically susceptible infants. Viruses have been suggested to be involved, such as the New Haven Corona Virus, HIV, adenovirus, etc. [11]. Also superantigens derived from Staphylococcus aureus have been implicated [12]. Superantigens are proteins that bind to MHC class II molecules on antigen presenting cells and interact simultaneously with specific V\u03b2 segments of the T-cell receptor (TCR). As such, they are able to stimulate, in an antigen-independent way, all T-cells that utilize a particular group of TCR V\u03b2 segments. In Kawasaki disease, S. aureus strains have been isolated expressing various superantigens, in particular the toxic-shock-syndrome toxin-1 (TSST-1) superantigen, and analysis of the V\u03b2 repertoire on the TCR of circulating T-cells showed T-cell expansion compatible with superantigen driven T-cell proliferation [12].

There are striking differences in these percentages between patients from Northern Europe and those from Southern Europe, in particular Italy. Whereas only a minority of patients with mixed cryoglobulinemic vasculitis in Northern Europe is positive for HCV, the majority of patients with this disorder from Italy tests positive. The reason for this difference is not known. The clinical spectrum of this form of vasculitis is variable ranging from purpura to severe proliferative glomerulonephritis [13]. How HCV induces B-cell activation and proliferation, resulting in the production of monoclonal rheumatoid factor, an essential component of mixed cryoglobulins, is presently not clear. However, the detection of HCV in patients with essential cryoglobulinemic vasculitis is of utmost importance as it has therapeutic consequences. A combination of antiviral treatment (interferon alpha with ribavirin) and immunosuppressive treatment (rituximab alone or with steroids, cyclophosphamide and even plasma exchange in very severe cases) has now been suggested [13].",

Chronic nasal carriage of S. aureus occurs in around 63% of patients with WG in contrast to around 25% in healthy controls. Furthermore, chronic nasal carriage concurs with a strongly increased risk (relative risk of 7.2) for disease relapse [18] (Fig. 1\n). The mechanisms underlying this increased risk for relapse have not been clarified, but several hypotheses have been formulated [19]. First, superantigens from S. aureus may stimulate B- and/or T-cells. Indeed, in a second study, 82% (51 out of 62) of WG patients were chronic or intermittent carrier of S. aureus of whom 72.5% (37 out of 51) carried at least one strain positive for superantigens [20]. The presence of the toxic-shock-syndrome toxin-1 (TSST-1) superantigen was particularly associated with a strong risk for relapse (relative risk 13.3) [20]. Furthermore, T-cell activation was observed in patients with WG, even during quiescent phases of the disease [21]. However, the V\u03b2 repertoire of expanded T-cells was not associated with carriage of specific S. aureus superantigens [22]. Mechanisms other than superantigen stimulation may be operative as well. S. aureus may activate B-cells polyclonally by cell-wall components of the bacterium. Such polyclonal stimulation may result in persistence of ANCA. Indeed, persistence of ANCA after induction of remission of WG, a strong risk factor for relapse, was related to chronic nasal carriage of S. aureus\n[18]. S. aureus may also directly prime neutrophils leading, amongst other, to surface expression of proteinase 3 (PR3), the target antigen of ANCA in WG. These primed neutrophils expressing PR3 can be fully activated by PR3-ANCA resulting in damage to tissues, especially vessel walls [16].",

Indeed, the phosphatase was detected in 3 out of 19 renal biopsies from patients with WG. Furthermore, renal perfusion with the phosphatase in rats immunized with this enzyme resulted in severe necrotizing crescentic glomerulonephritis, the histopathological equivalent of renal lesions in WG [24].",

In this study antibodies were described in patients with WG directed against complementary PR3, which is the protein translated from the antisense DNA strand encoding for PR3. In addition, the authors showed that immunization of mice with complementary PR3 not only induced antibodies to this protein but also to PR3 itself. Interestingly, peptides from complementary PR3 show strong homology with peptides from S. aureus. So, peptides from S. aureus could, by molecular mimicry, induce antibodies to complementary PR3, which, in turn via idiotypic\u2013anti-idiotypic interactions, could induce antibodies to PR3, the characteristic autoantibodies in WG. These data should be confirmed and extended.",

In a double-blind, placebo-controlled study patients received maintenance treatment with co-trimoxazole, 960 mg b.i.d., in order to test the hypothesis that this approach could reduce the occurrence of relapses in patients with WG. This treatment led to a strong decrease in the incidence of, mostly respiratory, infections. However, more importantly, the incidence of relapses decreased by 60% (relative risk 0.40) [26]. In a second study, patients with active limited WG, that is disease limited to the upper airways, received treatment with co-trimoxazole, 960 mg b.i.d., only without corticosteroids or immunosuppressives. Out of 31 patients, 18 reached complete remission and 9 patients partial remission after a median period of 3 months. However, 11 patients relapsed, at a median time of 14 months, particularly those patients not carrying S. aureus or with disease extending outside the ENT region (unpublished observation). These data also support a role for microbial agents in WG.",
