Hemorrhagic fevers caused by Ebola and Marburg viruses\u2014also collectively known as filoviral hemorrhagic fever (FHF)\u2014previously caused dramatic, albeit limited, outbreaks in central Africa. Their impact on global health was rather small (except in the realm of biological warfare research) because of the high mortality rate, lack of effective antiviral therapies and vaccines, and potential for person-to-person transmission.1 The 2014 West African outbreak of EVD proved that these filoviruses should no longer be considered as merely regional problems. A short review of EVD and its clinical relevance to the nonendemic countries is presented. The current epidemic is caused by Za\u00efre ebolavirus; however, references will also be made to the related Marburgvirus, which shares many virological, clinical, and epidemiological characteristics.",

            "text": "In recent years, the pathogenesis of FHF has been better elucidated.18 Filoviruses are pantropic with the ability to infect different host cell types. The initial cells in which the viruses replicate are likely dendritic cells, macrophages, monocytes, and Kupffer cells at the site of entry. A large number of lectins (e.g., DC-SIGN and L-SIGN) and immunorecognition receptors [i.e., triggering receptors expressed in myeloid cells (TREM)] can serve as receptors for the viruses.19 After the initial multiplication in the aforementioned cell types, the viruses are transported to the reticuloendothelial system (e.g., lymph nodes, spleen, liver) and other organs where infection of other cell types occur. The resulting massive necrosis and end organ damage are reflected in the histopathology of human and primate infection models with necrosis in the liver, kidneys, lungs, lymphoid tissues, and other organs.20, 21 In addition, various mechanisms contribute to the development of coagulopathy and disseminated intravascular coagulation, which is a hallmark of viral hemorrhagic fevers. Patients with FHF develop significant platelet dysfunction (which is not merely accountable for by thrombocytopenia), and this is contributed to by platelet activation and decreased vascular endothelium production of prostacyclin.22 Another important target in the pathogenesis of FHF is the endothelium. Human and primate endothelial cells are susceptible to infection by EBOV, although direct cyopathic effects are not an important factor in the development of vasculopathy and coagulopathy.23 The release of vasoactive factors (e.g., nitric oxide) or cytokines and chemokines from monocytes and macrophages (e.g., tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interferons, monocyte chemoattactant protein-1, interleukin-8) could be important in the genesis of vascular damage.23 The combined effects of increased secretions of proinflammatory cytokines, activation of the coagulation cascade, consumption and/or reduced production of protein C, thrombocytopenia and platelet dysfunction, hepatic damage with impaired production of coagulation factors, and vascular damage contribute to the development of coagulopathy in FHF.24\n",

Inhabitants of endemic areas, especially individuals dwelling in forests with occupational exposure to wild animals (e.g., hunters and people handling bushmeat), may develop symptomatic or subclinical infections, presumably because of the exposure to animal reservoirs of the virus. In some cases of human infection, a history of direct exposure to animal carcasses (such as primates, bats, duiker antelopes, and porcupines) or indirect exposure to bats in caves has occurred.44, 45, 46, 54, 55 These single or multiple introductions to human populations may result in short chains of human transmission. When FHF patients are admitted to healthcare facilities where infection control measures are inadequate, a large outbreak may occur with transmission to other patients and healthcare workers. Hospitals have been a major amplifying and disseminating factor in many previous outbreaks of FHF in Africa.",

In October 2014, the World Health Organization declared the epidemic over in Senegal and Nigeria.66, 67 Further epidemiological investigations suggested the index case was probably a 2-year-old child who died on December 6, 2013 in southern Guinea.60 The infection was subsequently transmitted from the child to family members, a village midwife, and a healthcare worker; some of these patients later caused outbreaks in different areas of Guinea. Ebola virus disease has caused infection in 838 local healthcare workers of whom 495 (59%) workers died (as of January 7, 2015); four of these infected healthcare workers were citizens of the United States of America, Spain, and the United Kingdom who returned to their respective countries for further management.68 As of September 14, 2014, the basic reproduction number in this epidemic ranged from 1.71 to 2.02, which is similar to previous estimates of 1.34 to 2.70.69, 70, 71 The virus strain causing the current outbreak is ZEBOV, which shows 97% identity to the EBOV strains that caused outbreaks in Gabon and the Democratic Republic of the Congo in 2002.60, 72 A concurrent but unrelated outbreak of EVD occurred in the Democratic Republic of the Congo from August 2014 to November 2014; it involved 66 cases and 49 deaths.

A diffuse erythematous rash (14\u201316%) appears towards the end of the 1st week which will later desquamate. The non-pruritic rash appears first on the trunk, and then spreads to the entire body with sparing of the face. Three early symptoms of bilateral conjunctival injection, rash, and sore throat are suggestive of EVD in the differential diagnosis.82 After the appearance of the rash, patients may either gradually recover or, in severe cases, progress over 7\u201314 days to the full-blown hemorrhagic fever syndrome with petechiae (8%), gum bleeding (0\u201315%), melaena (8\u201316%), hemoptysis (0\u201311%), hematemesis (0\u201313%), epistaxis (0\u20132%), hematuria (7\u201316%), menorrhagia, bleeding at venipuncture sites (5\u20138%), and show features of disseminated intravascular coagulation.82, 83 The typical hemorrhagic fever picture, however, occurs only in approximately 40% of the patients (range, 17\u201371%).82, 84 Other manifestations in the late stage include evidence of multiorgan failure such as circulatory shock, obtundation, tachypnea, renal shutdown, convulsion, delirium, and coma. Fever is often absent at this stage. Death often occurs between Days 6 and 16, whereas patients who survive will show improvement around Days 6 to 11.6 Intrauterine death is common in pregnant patients. Mortality among pregnant women is substantial but may not be significantly higher than for nonpregnant patients; and pregnant women do not have an increased susceptibility to the infection.85, 86 Survivors tend to improve from the 2nd week of illness. They make a slow recovery during which arthralgia (which could be asymmetric and migratory and often involves the large joints), uveitis, conjunctivitis, orchitis, parotitis, hearing loss, and tinnitus may occur.80, 82 Chronic infection by filoviruses has not been documented, but male patients may shed the virus in the semen for 40\u201391 days after the onset of illness, and the transmission of MARV has occurred via sexual intercourse.58, 59, 87, 88\n",

When the viral load is determined by quantitative assays, prognostic information can also be obtained. The most commonly used test is RT-PCR. A reverse transcription\u2013loop-mediated isothermal amplification assay has also been developed for EBOV and MARV.102, 103 All diagnostic nucleic acid amplification tests must be adequately validated before being used clinically. If appropriately validated, the use of multiplex PCR/RT-PCR allows simultaneous detection of multiple pathogens that cause hemorrhagic fever.104, 105 The provision of nucleic acid amplification tests should preferably be centralized in national or regional reference laboratories to ensure adequate biosafety containment and quality of results. The RNA of EBOV can be detected in the sera by RT-PCR 24\u201348 hours earlier than by antigen capture; in some studies, it is detectable on Day 1 of the illness.6, 90 However, the viral load gradually reaches its peak at approximately 3 \u20137 days after the onset of the disease.90 Retesting is therefore necessary if RT-PCR is initially negative but clinical suspicion is high, especially when the first sample was obtained within 3 days of the onset of disease. Blood is the most commonly used sample for RT-PCR. Oral fluid specimens can be a viable alternative to blood samples for RT-PCR in situations in which blood taking may be difficult or infeasible.106 Common targets for nucleic acid amplification include the L, GP, and NP genes.89, 90, 95, 107, 108\n",

Significant international assistance is usually needed to contain major outbreaks. The discussion on these public health issues is beyond the scope of this article. For health authorities in nonendemic countries, a preparedness plan for emerging infections is an indispensable component of the public health system. The development and adoption of preparedness and response plans for emerging infectious diseases are first fostered in anticipation of pandemic influenza. The outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), pandemic influenza A (i.e., H1N1), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and, more recently, avian influenza A (i.e., H7N9) and EVD underscore the importance of such pre-emptive plans in preventing or mitigating the effects of disease transmission.159, 160 The details may vary, depending on the nature of the pathogens; however, key components in public health response include risk assessment; communication and education; establishing a rapid response team and management team to coordinate responses between different government ministries; monitoring and surveillance; providing adequate facilities and supplies for quarantine and infection control; developing laboratory diagnostics; and where appropriate, antimicrobial and vaccination policies, and/or stockpiling.159, 161\n",

However, it is prudent to issue health warnings to potential visitors to affected countries. Pretravel education on transmission routes, precautionary measures, self-monitoring of signs and symptoms, and availability of medical care in destination countries should be provided. As in other subspecialties of travel medicine, the visiting friends and relatives (VFRs) are at particularly high risk of contracting travel-related infections.166 Despite the fact that publicity and health alerts are often announced to the general public, VFRs do not always receive the necessary information on the risks because of cultural differences, language barriers, or different perceptions. Hence, efforts must be targeted to VFRs (especially African communities in this context) to reduce the risk of disease importation.",

The practice first gained popularity during the 2003 SARS epidemic, and was subsequently evaluated in the 2009 influenza A (H1N1) pandemic.167, 168, 169, 170 To a lesser extent, this method has also been used for the screening of other febrile illness such as dengue fever.171 Infrared thermal scanning is relatively popular in Asian countries such as Taiwan, Japan, Korea, and Hong Kong, and it is usually used in conjunction with health questionnaires for self-reported symptoms such as fever and travel history. The tympanic temperature would be measured for suspected cases. The sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value of thermal scanning are affected by a variety of factors such as the instruments used, the threshold temperature, the part of the body being measured, the distance of the instruments from the individual, and the previous use of antipyretic agents. Patients in the incubation period of an infection obviously will not be detected by this screening method. Despite the relatively low sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive values of infrared thermal scanning, some investigators consider it a useful adjunctive measure for border screening, although it cannot be relied on as the sole method for screening.167, 168, 169, 170\n",

These include (depending on the itinerary and exposure history) other causes of fever with or without hemorrhagic presentations such as meningococcal infections, severe sepsis due to other bacterial infections (including rare infections such as anthrax and plague as guided by the clinical picture and exposure history), leptospirosis, typhoid and other causes of enteric fever, rickettsioses, malaria, trypanosomiasis, visceral leishmaniasis, dengue fever, and yellow fever. In particular, malaria (which is a very common treatable cause of fever in returned travelers and is endemic in sub-Saharan Africa) must be excluded by appropriate testing. Depending on the travel destination, other causes of viral hemorrhagic fever have to be considered such as Lassa fever, Hantavirus infection, Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever, and Rift Valley fever. The travel history should also include human contacts with sick individuals in the community (e.g., attending local funerals) or in healthcare facilities (as in the case of volunteer workers).84\n",

The routes of transmission of filoviruses are well documented. Transmission can be interrupted, provided that proper infection control and public health measures are implemented. Detailed infection control guidelines on caring for patients with FHF have been published.57, 179, 180, 181, 182 In essence, the principles of isolation and use of personal protective equipment are not significantly different from standard precautions and transmission-based precautions (i.e., contact, droplet, and airborne) that are universally practiced in healthcare facilities. However, numerous studies and reviews have confirmed that the compliance with the choice and use of personal protective equipment among healthcare workers are almost always suboptimal.183, 184, 185 Essential factors that ensure the optimal implementation of infection control protocols are adequate training of healthcare workers on isolation procedures and on the appropriate use of personal protective equipment, preferably by interactive training with clear instructions; adequate manpower and organizational support; and the availability of timely and adequate guidance and support.186, 187, 188 Such training should not be limited to staff working in clinical areas; it must also include other healthcare workers such as laboratory workers and paramedical personnel. The key elements of infection control consist of patient placement (e.g., isolation facilities), strict adherence to hand hygiene (e.g., the WHO's \u201cfive moments for hand hygiene\u201d), proper use of personal protective equipment such as gloves (e.g., double gloves in special circumstances), waterproof gowns, respiratory protection (e.g., surgical masks, respirators during aerosol-generating procedures), eye protection, rubber boots, and safe handling of sharp objects.55 Support staff engaged in environmental disinfection, funerals, and burial services must also be adequately trained on the proper use of personal protective equipment and chemical disinfectants, and on the handling of human remains to ensure adequate disinfection and minimize the risk of accidental exposure to the virus.55, 189, 190\n",
