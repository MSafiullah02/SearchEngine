A large outbreak brings about deaths, health losses and economic losses. Research on preventing an epidemic or mitigating its consequences is thus of high priority. Vaccination is one of the most effective ways to control the spread of a sudden epidemic. However, the vaccine stockpile is hardly ever sufficient to vaccinate the entire population (e.g., for influenza: Berkman 2009, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 2016, Monto 2006, Roos 2009).",

For such a sudden outbreak, vaccination is one of the most effective ways to control the spread. However, the available vaccine stockpile is insufficient to vaccinate the entire population and the development of additional vaccines may take months (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 2016). Thus, the policy maker must solve an allocation problem: How should the doses of vaccine be allocated? During the 2009 H1N1 pandemic the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) used a pro rata allocation (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 2009a) in which vaccines were allocated among states relative to their population size. However, the spread of the outbreak differed substantially per state, which motivates the study of alternative allocations of vaccines over multiple regions, also referred to as \u201cpopulations\u201d (see also Teytelman and Larson 2013).",

Such approaches may use detailed models and thus yield sophisticated allocations, but they do not give a high\u2010level explanation of why certain allocations yield a higher health benefit. This is especially problematic because the resulting allocations are often inequitable and behave counterintuitively, as illustrated in Table 1. For example, Population 1 has priority over Population 2 when 2000 doses are available, but this priority switches at 8000 doses and again at 20,000 doses. Similar outcomes have been observed in various models (Keeling and Shattock 2012, Klepac et al. 2011, Rowthorn et al. 2009, Yuan et al. 2015), but remain poorly understood.",

We initially focus on the classical SIR model, which consists of three compartments that respectively contain susceptible (S), infected (I), and removed (R) individuals. People can be in the removed compartment because of recovery and immunity, successful vaccination or death. Health benefits in this model are defined in terms of the total number of people that escape infection. Vaccination affects health benefit in two ways: directly for people that are vaccinated, and indirectly for people that are not vaccinated by reducing their disease exposure throughout the epidemic.",

We derive an implicit relation that extends the final size equation (Diekmann et al. 2012) and that forms the basis of our subsequent analysis. We contribute to the extant literature by proving that the health benefits are in general convex\u2010concave and increasing\u2010decreasing in the vaccination fraction, and that the convex part arises only in populations where the disease has made limited progression yet. The insight that the health benefit has a convex\u2010concave response to the vaccination fraction has crucial consequences for allocation. We provide an intuitive explanation for convexity\u2010concavity to arise that is based on the effect that vaccination has on the peak of the proportion of infected.",

A single dose of vaccination may be like a drop in the ocean, but multiple doses together can have a substantial effect. To conceptualize this idea, we define our dose\u2010optimal vaccination fraction, a unique fraction that maximizes the health benefits per dose of vaccine in a population. Health benefits per dose of vaccine decrease when moving away from this fraction in either direction. This leads to a crucial implication for policy makers: in order to effectively use the limited vaccine stockpile available after an outbreak, they should focus exclusively on a few populations where dose\u2010optimal coverage is (closely) attainable.",

These epidemic characteristics are measures to quantify the severity of an outbreak. The final size, also referred to as the infection attack rate, is broadly used (e.g., Arino et al. 2006, Keeling and Shattock 2012, Matrajt and Longini Jr 2010). It measures the total number of people infected during an epidemic. An implicit analytical expression for the final size can be derived from the Kermack and McKendrick model (cf. Diekmann et al. 2012). This final size equation may be shown to hold for a broad range of model specifications (Keeling and Shattock 2012, Ma and Earn 2006). Our objective also corresponds to minimizing the final size: an extension of the final size equation serves as the starting point of our analysis. In contrast, Cairns (1989) and Goldstein et al. (2009) investigate how to minimize another epidemic characteristic: the basic reproduction ratio R\n0 (cf. Wallinga et al. 2010). R\n0 is defined as the number of new infections caused by a single infectious individual in a completely susceptible population. In the initial phase of an epidemic there are very few infected individuals, so the population is almost completely susceptible. R\n0 is therefore related to the exponential initial growth rate of an epidemic (cf. Wallinga and Lipsitch 2007). Other studies analyze vaccine allocations that result in the threshold R\n0 = 1 (e.g., Becker and Starczak 1997, Tanner et al. 2008). Duijzer et al. (2016) consider vaccination before an outbreak in an age structured population and minimize the required vaccine stockpile to achieve R\n0 = 1. R\n0 is a myopic criterion, because it corresponds to the initial growth rate, whereas the more traditional final size criterion considers the entire time course of the epidemic. While the former criterion leads to a much more tractable model, the latter approach may be more appropriate in many cases.",

They show that these heuristic algorithms outperform a pro rata strategy by taking into account regional differences in the flu wave that can be the result of differences in school holidays and school openings. They use a dynamic approach in which vaccination decisions are updated over time to incorporate incoming information about the epidemic. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to use an analytical approach to provide structural insights explaining why certain interventions are eventually most effective. Our main technical contribution is providing a detailed mathematical analysis of the final size in the seminal SIR model. We show the convex\u2010concave structure and prove that there is a unique vaccination fraction that yields the highest health benefits per dose of vaccine in a population: the dose\u2010optimal vaccination fraction. The term dose\u2010optimal is also used by Ball and Lyne (2002) for a vaccine allocation that minimizes R\n0 under different model specifications.

Just prior to vaccination the system is in state (s\nj(\u03c4), i\nj(\u03c4)). Assume that the used vaccine is completely effective after a single dose and that vaccination takes no time, meaning that vaccination results in complete immunity immediately. Assume also that it is possible to identify the susceptible people. We refer to section 6 for a discussion of these assumptions. Under our assumptions vaccination causes a shift at time \u03c4 from state (s\nj(\u03c4), i\nj(\u03c4)) to state (s\nj(\u03c4) \u2212 f\nj, i\nj(\u03c4)).

This secondary effect is non\u2010monotonic, because it consists of two competing phenomena: (i) Vaccination lowers s(\u03c4), thus reducing the further reduction in susceptibles needed until s(t) reaches 1/\u03c3 and (ii) Vaccination reduces the rate of initial exponential growth of infected people, thus inhibiting the speed of reduction of s(t). For small f the second effect dominates, resulting in a delayed peak as can be seen in Figure 2. For larger vaccination fractions, when s(\u03c4) comes close to 1/\u03c3, the first effect dominates rendering the peak to be advanced. A delayed peak is beneficial, since more time allows for more recoveries and consequently results in fewer infections at the peak. Small vaccination fractions benefit from the delayed peak, in addition to the primary effect, which results in the convex and increasing herd effect.

The structure of the optimal allocation thus clearly brings about complex decisions for policy makers, who also have to take equity considerations into account.

Up to an interaction factor of 0.02 the switching pattern is still clearly visible up to vaccine stockpiles of around 30% of the total population size. For a factor 0.05 switching priorities occur only for relatively small stockpiles and for a factor 0.1 the optimal allocation does no longer display any switching behaviour. Yet for all compared levels of interaction (0.01, 0.02, 0.05, and 0.1) the optimal allocation of small vaccine stockpiles remains unequitable, prioritizing initially only one population.

Our results continue to hold when several assumptions are relaxed as will be discussed here. We assume that the vaccine is completely effective and results in immunity directly. The effectiveness of a vaccine can be incorporated with an efficacy parameter that rescales the vaccination fraction (cf. Hill and Longini Jr 2003, Mylius et al. 2008). A delay in immunity can be approximated by using a slightly lower value for s(\u03c4) than at the vaccination moment. We also assume that it is possible to identify susceptible individuals. If this is not the case, some of the vaccines would be administered to infected or immune people. Under the condition that the vaccines are only effective for susceptible people, this implies that the proportion of people effectively vaccinated equals fs(\u03c4). That is, we can simply rescale a parameter to account for situations where susceptible people cannot be identified. All these small adjustments in the parameters do not change the structure of the herd effect and the optimal vaccine allocation. Thus the structure described in the theorems and lemmas continues to hold. Finally, we assume that a single dose of vaccine is sufficient to achieve immunity. Our results cannot be directly applied to the situation where multiple doses of vaccine are given to an individual, particularly because there often needs to be a minimum time in between administering consecutive doses. As the epidemic continues to spread in the meantime, this brings extra complexity to the problem (cf., Duijzer et al. 2017a).",

Although prioritizing based on geography might seem unfair, geography might play a role in outbreaks of influenza, measles or in bioterror attacks. In the past, there have been outbreaks with large regional differences such as the 2009 H1N1 pandemic (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 2009b). In situations with a large asymmetry between the regions, a geographic assymetric approach is perhaps more easily accepted. However, our results also show that sometimes asymmetric choices should be made in symmetric cases (e.g., two regions with the same parameters and disease progression).

These ethical guidelines are the result of an ethical debate on finding good vaccine allocations. The results derived in this study can be a valuable contribution to this ethical debate. Our optimal allocations can be used as a benchmark to determine the effects on the final size of an epidemic if a suboptimal policy is selected motivated by fairness. Next to that, policy makers can use strategies in which they balance between efficiency and equity. For example, they can reserve part of the vaccine stockpile for pro rata allocation and allocate the remaining vaccines optimally (cf., Kaplan and Merson 2002, Wu et al. 2007). Another possibility is to add equity constraints that either set minimum levels for vaccination in each region or restrict the relative difference between populations (Teytelman and Larson 2013). Our relatively simple model, and the analytical results we obtained for it, could be a valuable starting point to test ideas on balancing equity, political viability, and effectiveness of vaccine allocations.",
