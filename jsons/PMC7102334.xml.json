In a cohort of 1000 APS patients (36% with systemic lupus erythematosus [SLE]), pulmonary hemorrhage, adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and pulmonary artery thrombosis had a combined prevalence of only 0.7% [4]. One institution reported a 2% frequency of aPL-associated DAH among 483 primary APS patients followed over 16 years [5\u2022\u2022]. In catastrophic APS (CAPS), DAH is identified in 12% of patients [6]. The nonspecific clinical and radiographic findings and inconsistent hemoptysis in DAH, as well as the requirement for an invasive diagnostic procedure, i.e., bronchoscopy, contribute to DAH being underdiagnosed [7]. Thus, the true frequency is likely higher than what is reported in the literature [8, 9].",

A vicious cycle of neutrophilic apoptosis, proteolytic enzyme disbursement, fibrin deposition, and recruitment of inflammatory cells culminates in fibrinoid necrosis of the alveolar and capillary walls. Once a critical mass of neutrophils and aforementioned debris disrupt the alveolar-capillary basement membrane, RBCs extravagate into the alveoli and interstitium. Hemosiderin-filled macrophages begin to accumulate 24\u201348 h after the initial vessel injury [10\u2022\u2022, 11, 12]. Bland alveolar hemorrhage is characterized by intra-alveolar RBCs without adjacent capillary inflammation or destruction. Diffuse alveolar damage, the primary lesion in ARDS, is defined by intra-alveolar edema and hyaline membranes filled with debris lining the alveoli with sparse inflammation [10\u2022\u2022, 13, 14].",

The most frequently proposed theory is antibody-mediated pulmonary capillaritis, possibly caused by aPL-induced endothelial cell activation and upregulation of adhesion molecules [15\u2022\u2022]. Another postulated mechanism is in situ microvascular thrombosis generating alveoli hemorrhage [16]. The detailed discussion of mechanisms of aPL-mediated DAH and micro-thrombosis can be found elsewhere [7, 15\u2022\u2022, 17]; however, recent data suggest (a) aPL activation of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) kinase leads to endothelium proliferation and consequent vasculopathy, which is evident in aPL-associated nephropathy, and (b) complement activation is an important contributor to aPL-mediated thrombosis; however, complement deposition is rarely seen on lung biopsy [18\u201320].",

Of note, increasing bloody returns may precede the hemosiderin-laden macrophages during acute hemorrhage. Yet these macrophages may persist in BAL fluid weeks to months after alveolar erythrocytes have vanished [31].

            "text": "Diffuse alveolar hemorrhage was the first presentation of APS in 9/79 (11%) patients [15\u2022\u2022, 21, 49\u201352]; three out of 17 patients in one case series were diagnosed with APS only after they presented with DAH [5\u2022\u2022]. Yet, two other reviews of 18 and 13 patients noted a median DAH onset of 5.9 and 5.8 years, respectively, after the diagnosis of APS [25, 46]. Furthermore, many patients have a delay in diagnosis [53, 54], e.g., a 26-year-old female visited her primary care doctor and emergency room for multiple episodes of hemoptysis throughout 1 year before the eventual diagnosis of APS [49].",
