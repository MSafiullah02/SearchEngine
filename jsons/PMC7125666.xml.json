            "text": "Porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED) is a highly contagious disease with typical symptoms in piglets that include severe diarrhea, vomiting and intestinal dehydration (Ko et al., 2017). The morbidity and mortality rates of suckling piglets caused by PEDV are more than 50%, and it is the primary cause of death in piglets and weight loss in fattening pigs (Choi et al., 2009). This viral disease was first reported in Britain in 1971 and then became an epidemic in other European countries (Yu et al., 2017). In 1976, PEDV was detected for the first time in China, and since October 2010, PEDV outbreaks worldwide have become more frequent (Song et al., 2015). For instance, PED broke out in Minnesota and Iowa in the United States in 2013, resulting in huge losses to the pig industry (Diep et al., 2017; Lee, 2015). As a coronavirus, PEDV has a typical structure that consists of four structural proteins, including the nucleocapsid protein (N), a membrane protein (M), a glycosylated spike protein (S) and a envelope protein (E) (Kocherhans et al., 2001). The PEDV spike protein-encoding gene is an immune dominant gene that encodes a protein with a very dense hydrophobic region of amino acids that harbors multiple glycosylation sites and has a high antigenic index (Li et al., 2017a). Several studies have reported that the S protein is a structural surface protein of PEDV, containing both the receptor binding domain, which mediates invasion of the virus into the host cell, and the antigenic epitope, which mediates production of the neutralizing virus antibody (Zhang et al., 2016). Thus, the S-glycoprotein plays a crucial role in viral infection, pathogenicity and adsorption. It has been shown that the S-glycoprotein is immunogenic and has the potential to be a good vaccine candidate (Fan et al., 2015).",

LAB, which are generally recognized as safe bacteria, colonize the intestines of humans or animals and have potentially beneficial effects (Landete et al., 2015). The study of LAB has many advantages, including that they are easy to culture, convenient to manipulate and highly safe, which is why LAB can be regarded as a heterologous antigen protein delivery system (Wanker et al., 1995). L. plantarum has been manipulated to deliver a number of viral antigens in previous studies (Li et al., 2017b; Yang et al., 2017c). The L. plantarum strain NC8 was isolated from ensilages and has a better antireversion characteristic compared with LAB isolated from healthy animal intestines (Caggianiello et al., 2016; Park et al., 2017). Thus, L. plantarum NC8 is more suitable to act as a mucosal delivery shuttle vector to express protective antigens.",

PgsA can stably anchor \u03b3-PGA synthetase on the cell membrane, acting as a transport carrier of \u03b3-PGA and playing a crucial role in the formation of \u03b3-PGA (Sung et al., 2005). The pgsA protein has a transmembrane region near its N-terminus (26\u201342 amino acid residues), providing the necessary characteristics for the establishment of a pgsA transmembrane expression system. The pgsA gene was combined with the target gene for fusion expression, after which L. plantarum was used as a mucosal vehicle to deliver an exogenous antigen. This experiment provided a theoretical basis for the construction of a novel, orally administered, genetic engineered vaccine to immobilize exogenous medicinal proteins on the cell wall surface of L. plantarum (Cai et al., 2016; Narita et al., 2006).",

DCs can elicit T cell polarization and differentiation in T cells subsets, which also trigger secretion of IFN-\u03b3 (Subramaniam et al., 2017). DCs are involved in regulating the function of B cells and promoting the differentiation of B cells into plasma cells to produce IgG (Wang et al., 2016). In the germinal center, DCs can boost B cell antibody affinity maturation and help to form and maintain memory B cells. In addition, sIgA can play an important role in maintaining intestinal integrity and intestinal symbioses (Shaw et al., 2000). DCs can restrict penetration of microorganisms into the mucosa and promote uptake of antigens in the intestinal mucosal system (Owen et al., 2013). It has been reported that NC8-pSIP409-pgsA'-S-DCpep can specifically conjugate dendritic cell-targeting peptide (DCpep) and induce an immune response (Apostolico et al., 2017). To make DCs recognize the S-antigen more effectively in the intestinal mucosa, recombinant NC8-pSIP409-pgsA'-S-DCpep was constructed using standard molecular biology techniques, and its immunogenicity was further investigated. After BALB/c mice were immunized by lavage administration of our recombinant L. plantarum, the results indicated that the in vivo antibody levels were greatly improved.",

Kolandaswamy (Madurai Kamaraj University, India). The pM18-T-S-DCpep (DC peptide, FYPSYHSTPQRP) was stored at Jilin Provincial Engineering Research Center of Animal Probiotics in Jilin Agricultural University. The pM18-T-S-DCpep plasmid was cut at XbaI and HindIII sites within the primers using the appropriate restriction enzymes at 37 \u00b0C for 3\u20134 h. Next, the digested 2240 bp S gene fragment (Spike Protein Gene GenBank: JQ257007.1 (source: 75\u20132313)/Spike Protein GenBank: AEW24858.1 (source: 26\u2013771)) and DCpep (S-DCpep) were ligated into pSIP409-pgsA' using T4 DNA ligase at 16 \u00b0C overnight. The recombinant pSIP409-pgsA'-S-DCpep plasmid was detected and purified using a gel extraction kit (Axygen). The recombinant plasmid was introduced into the L. plantarum NC8 strain by electroporation and erythromycin-resistant bacteria were selected for, after which the plasmid was sequenced. In addition, to meet the rigorous nature of the experimental study, a NC8-pSIP409-pgsA'-S-Ctrlpep (control peptide, EPIHPETTFTNN) was constructed similar to NC8-pSIP409-pgsA'-S-DCpep and used as the experimental control group.",

Contemporary strategies in vaccination primarily focus on using different vectors to express the identified antigenic regions. Antigens delivered by different routes might stimulate the intestinal mucosal immune system to achieve immunoprophylaxis effect.

SIgA agglutinates and incapacitates pathogens by which it inhibits pathogen adhesion to the mucosal surface and easily cleared in the secretions. Therefore, sIgA disenables pathogens interact with epithelial cell receptors and inhibits the assembly of viral particles within the host cell cytoplasm (Kurashima and Kiyono, 2017; Motegi et al., 2000). Our study suggesting that the anti-S mucosal sIgA responses of recombinant Lactobacillus NC8-pSIP409-pgsA'-S-Dcpep group significantly increased. Following four indicators are used to evaluate the effectiveness of a vaccine in mucosal system: connecting closely with lymphoid tissue in mucous membrane; the existence of scattered lymphoid tissues and lymphoid organs with a certain structure; DCs use a special mechanism to uptake antigen; and the presence of many activated and memory lymphocytes in the absence of an infection (Chung et al., 2017; Faria and Reis, 2017). Currently, many investigators are focused on the development of mucosal vaccines. Our study demonstrated that the recombinant L. plantarum NC8-pSIP409-pgsA'-S-DCpep could increase the activation of B cells and further improve the level of humoral immunity (Fig. 3). Orally administration of recombinant NC8-pSIP409-pgsA'-S-DCpep in mice boosted the number and frequency of IgA+B220+ B cells compared with the NC8-pSIP409-pgsA' and NC8-pSIP409-pgsA'-S-Ctrlpep groups. Similarly, we also detected anti-S systemic IgG in the blood, The results showed that S-DCpep could effectively initiate a mucosal immune response and humoral immunity. Subsequently, L. plantarum expressed S-DCpep fusion protein could enhance the secretion of mucosal antibodies against pathogens (Mohamadzadeh et al., 2009; Shi et al., 2016; Yang et al., 2017a, Yang et al., 2017b, Yang et al., 2016). In the construction of the recombinant strain NC8-pSIP409-pgsA'-S-Dcpep, pgsA has been used as an anchorin for its stability and safety in clinical use. Besides, pgsA has a wide range of applications for surface expression on some types of Lactobacillus compared with other anchorins. Therefore, we used pgsA as a surface display element for applying to surfaced of L. plantarum. A recombinant vaccine constructed by S-protein expressed on the surface of L. plantarum and DCpep fusion protein can provide protection since PEDV is primarily replicated in the small intestine. The results of western blot, FACS and confocal microscopy analyses suggested that S protein was expressed on the surface of L. plantarum.",

Several genetically engineered bacteria (Salmonella, Escherichia coli, Lactobacillus) could colonize in the intestines after inoculation that were regarded as promising oral vaccine vectors (Garcia-Fruitos, 2012). In addition, peptidoglycan expressed on the surface of L. plantarum, could function as a natural immune adjuvant and be utilized to design a novel vaccine (Dieye et al., 2001). Previous studies have demonstrated that L. plantarum could act as a mucosal delivery system to induce immune response and tolerance (Tauer et al., 2014). The distinctive feature of the immune response triggered by oral mucosal immunization is the production of specific secretory IgA. Antigens were taken up by M cells after oral inoculation, then dendritic cells and T cell subsets were activated, cytokines and chemokine were released and MHCI and MHCII were expressed (Kurashima and Kiyono, 2017). Finally the activation of B cells, the expression of specific integrin, phenotype transformation (especially to IgA type conversion) are observed (Perdigon et al., 2002).",

Th1 cell response can helpcytotoxic T cell differentiation mediate cellular immune responses, secrete IFN-\u03b3 and activate macrophages, which enhance the ability of cells to kill phagocytized pathogens (Maldonado-Lopez and Moser, 2001). Besides, the primary function of Th2 cells is to stimulate B cell proliferation and produce antibodies, which is related to humoral immunity (Mosmann and Coffman, 1989). Secretion of IL-4 increased the ability of monocytes differentiate into macrophages (Lee et al., 2009). IL-17 can increase the ability of costimulatory molecules, MHC, antigens and T lymphocytes to stimulate antigen peptide delivery and promote DC maturation (Lee et al., 2009). Therefore, we analyzed cytokine system IFN-\u03b3, IL-4, and IL-17 of Th1/Th2/Th17 cells secreted by the MLN of the immunized animals after treatment with recombinant bacteria. Our results showed that NC8-pSIP409-pgsA'-S-DCpep could significantly increase cytokine secretion and stimulate Th1 and Th2 cells and Th17 cell response, maintain the balance of Th1, Th2 immune response. The focus of our study was Th1 and Th2 immune responses induced by NC8-pSIP409-pgsA'-S-DCpep, which also stimulated the activation of Th17 cells (Fig. 6). Taken together, recombinant L. plantarum expressed S-DCpep could improve Th1/Th2/Th17 immune response in BALB/c mice and induce immune responses, such as the differentiation of B cells and DCs maturation.",
