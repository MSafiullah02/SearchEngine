Two circovirus species have been reported in pigs: PCV type 1 (PCV1) (Tischer, Rasch, & Tochtermann, 1974) and PCV type 2 (PCV2) (Allan et al., 1998). PCV1 is non\u2010pathogenic to pigs (Tischer et al., 1986). PCV2 is the primary causative agent of PCV\u2010associated diseases, which cause significant economic losses to the swine industry worldwide (Rose, Opriessnig, Grasland, & Jestin, 2012). The capsid in the proteins of circoviruses is the major structural protein and antigenic characteristics that determine proteins (Nawagitgul et al., 2000).",

In 2016, a novel circovirus, called PCV type 3 (PCV3), was reported to exist in the USA (Palinski et al., 2016). PCV3 is associated with porcine dermatitis, nephropathy syndrome and reproductive failure (Palinski et al., 2016) and cardiac and multisystemic inflammation (Phan et al., 2016). In 2016, a total of 356 sows at three farms in the Liaoning and Jiangxi Provinces and Chongqin City suffered from reproductive failure and acute loss of neonatal piglets. General pig pathogens, such as porcine pseudorabies virus (PRV), PCV2, porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus (PEDV), porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), porcine rotavirus (RV) and classical swine fever virus (CSFV), were not detected in these cases. PCV3 was the only detected pathogen. The geographical distribution, prevalence, tissue tropism, role in diseases and origin of PCV3 in China are unknown. This study reports on the first identification, widely epidemic, wide tissue tropism, different phylogenetic clusters, potential role in sow reproductive failure and possible origins of PCV3 in China.",

The stillborn rate of the delivery sows ranged from 5.2% to 20.1% at these three farms, while sow mortality ranged from 5.4% to 10.5%. The general pig pathogens, such as PRV, PCV2, PRRSV, PEDV, TGEV, RV and HCV, were excluded by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or simple PCR methods (Li, Li, Yan, Chen, & He, 2009; Yu et al., 2016; Zhang & He, 2010). PCV3 was the only detected pathogen in these cases. To better understand the infection status, epidemic status, geographical distribution, potential pathogenicity and genetic characteristics of PCV3 in China, a total of 222 samples (i.e., stillborn, tissues, semen and serum) were collected from 35 farms in 11 provinces or districts (i.e., Anhui, Chongqing, Fujian, Hebei, Henan, Hunan, Jiangsu, Jiangxi, Liaoning, Shenyang and Zhejiang) in China. These samples were subjected to pathogen detection in the Diagnostic Center of Animal Epidemic Diseases of Huazhong Agricultural University. The aforementioned samples were individually collected, stored, distilled in 2\u2010 or 5\u2010ml EP tubes or clear package bags and then transported utilizing ice boxes. The stillborn and tissues samples were homogenized and diluted 10\u2010fold with phosphate\u2010buffered saline (PBS; 0.1 M, pH 7.4). The semen and serum samples were diluted 10\u2010fold with PBS (0.1 M, pH 7.4). All the samples were frozen and thawed twice to release, further subjected to a vortex for 5 min, and centrifuged at 11,000 rpm (Eppendorf, Germany) for 8 min at 4\u00b0C. The supernatants were utilized for DNA and RNA extraction immediately or stored at \u221280\u00b0C refrigerator for further usage. A pair of primers was designed to detect PCV3 (Table 1). The detection limit of this method was 20.5 pg nuclear acid. The primers have no cross\u2010reactions with the PR, PCV2, TGEV, TGEV, RV, PRRSV, porcine parvovirus and deltacoronavirus temples stored in our laboratory. Two pairs of primers were utilized for the entire genome sequencing (Table 1).",

The co\u2010infection rate of PCV3 with PCV2 was 15.8% (35/222). The co\u2010infection of PCV2 with other pathogens has been widely reported (Ellis, 2014). The co\u2010infection rate of PCV3 and PCV2 was 15.8% (35/222) in the above detection results. The emergence of PCV2 is believed to be an important reason for the failure of PCV2 vaccination in several farms (Reiner, Hofmeister, & Willems, 2015; Seo et al., 2014; Xiao, Halbur, & Opriessnig, 2012). Whether co\u2010infection with PCV3 also plays a role in these cases must be further researched. The singular infection rate of PCV3 in the samples was 18.9% (42/222). PCV3 can be detected in the samples collected from all 11 provinces or districts. Results show that PCV3 has spread widely in China. PCV3 can be detected in the samples: brain [73.5% (25/34); including 57.1% (8/14) in the brain of stillbirth samples], lung [4/7; including 66.7% (2/3) in the lungs of stillbirth samples], lymph node [36.6% (15/41)], tonsil [66.7% (4/6)], semen [8.5%(4/47)] and serum [28.7%(25/87)]. These results suggest that PCV3 can be detected from different porcine tissues. PCV3 detection in the stillbirth and semen samples suggests the risk of a vertical transmission of PCV3.",

In the complete genome and partial capsid gene\u2010based phylogenetic tree analysis in Figures 1a and b, the Chinese PCV3 isolates were divided into two clusters, designed as 3a and 3b (Figure 1). This process shows the divergence of the PCV3 isolates in China. The USA PCV3 isolates (i.e., PCV3\u2010USA\u2010MO2015 [KX778720.1]) belonged to cluster 3a. The sequence similarity of these CV isolates is plotted in Figure 2 to study the genetic relationship of the Chinese PCV3 isolates with the Chinese Bat CVs. Two recombination regions were identified between the bat CVs and PCV3 isolates in 264\u2010564nt and 714\u20101148nt (Figure 2).

This paper reports on the first identification, widely epidemic, different phylogenetic clusters, potential role in sow reproductive failure and possible origins of PCV3 in China. We hypothesize that PCV3 is a potential zoonotic agent that can be vertically transmitted based on the above results. It can be detected from different tissues, such as brain, lung, lymph node and tonsil tissues. The above results are crucial to better understand PCV3 in China. Further studies are required to isolate PCV3, explore its biological and pathogenic characteristics and monitor its singular and co\u2010infection status.",
