Bovine coronavirus is an enveloped, positive-stranded RNA virus classified as an antigenic group II member of the family Coronaviridae (Spaan et al., 1988) and is implicated in both respiratory and enteric disease, including calf diarrhoea, winter dysentery in adult dairy cows, and respiratory infections in cattle of all ages (Alenius et al., 1991, Saif, 2004). BRSV, like its human counterpart, human respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV), is an enveloped, negative-stranded RNA virus classified in the Pneumovirus genus of the Paramyxoviridae family (Stott and Taylor, 1985). Although it is a major cause of respiratory disease in young calves and has a considerable economic impact (Van der Poel et al., 1994, Valarcher and Taylor, 2007), cattle of all ages can be infected with BRSV, and severe morbidity and mortality has been described in adult animals (Elvander, 1996).",

One of the aims of organic farming is to reduce the use of antibiotics through the provision of optimal husbandry, nutrition and biosecurity but it is currently unclear whether organic management is more successful than conventional management in reducing the risk or prevalence of herd infection with these viruses. This study set out to compare the serological prevalence of BCV and BRSV infection in dairy cows managed under organic and conventional management systems and to investigate potential risk factors associated with these infections.",

No herds were seronegative to BCV and no conventional herds were completely seronegative to BRSV. However, in two organic herds all sampled animals were seronegative to BRSV (Table 2). In organic herds 32% of the youngest cows (1\u20133 years old) were seropositive to both BCV and BRSV, whereas this figure was 70% in conventional herds (P\n < 0.001) (Fig. 1\n). In 10 of the conventional herds, but only 1 of the organic herds, all sampled cows were seropositive to both viruses.",

The trading of animals between organic farms is closely regulated so that such premises can only purchase cows from other organic farms and the quarantine of such animals prior to their introduction is also recommended (KRAV, 2007). Such practices could reduce the risk of direct transmission (Wellemans, 1990, Saif, 2004).

However, the results of our study did not indicate such a link and, in contrast, herds using AIF had a higher seroprevalence than herds using professional AI technicians. A similar lack of association between seroprevalence and the total number of visitors on-farm was reported by H\u00e4gglund et al. (2006). It is likely that biosecurity measures undertaken by visiting AI technicians, including disinfection and changes of clothing and footwear between herds, and farmer education on the importance of biosecurity all contributed to the lower seroprevalence. Interestingly, one herd had a high number of visits by members of the public, including groups of school children. This organic herd had a low seroprevalence to BRSV, only one positive 5-year-old cow out of 15 animals sampled, suggesting that contacts unrelated to the cattle industry were not a transmission risk.",

The repeated sampling of as few as three calves per herd has been used to monitor the herd incidence of BCV and BRSV infection (H\u00e4gglund et al., 2006). Of the cows born on the farms in our study, younger animals were typically seronegative and older animals seropositive, confirming the existence of long-lasting antibody responses to these infections. Thus serological status of the two or three youngest cows corresponded to the herd seroprevalence to these viral infections over the 2-year period preceding the sampling. Such a sampling strategy may form the basis of a rapid, economic, and non-labour intensive method of determining if herds are potentially susceptible to these infections.",

Conventional herds had a significantly higher mean antibody prevalence to BCV and BRSV than organically managed herds, and increased animal age was significantly associated with increased antibody prevalence. The findings suggest that organic farm management may be effective in reducing the seroprevalence of these viruses relative to conventional farming methods.",
