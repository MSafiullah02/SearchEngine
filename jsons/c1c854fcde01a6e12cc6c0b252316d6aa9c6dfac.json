The conduct of clinical research in accordance with the principles of GCP is necessary to ensure that clinical research participants are not exposed to undue risk, and that data generated from the research are valid and accurate. The safety and efficacy of pharmaceuticals, medical devices, and other healthcare products depend upon the application of GCP. The World Health Organization has been providing a global face-to-face GCP Inspection course in Indonesia for a decade, but budget constraints only allow this course to be offered once a year to 15 participants. This paper describes how the move from a face-to-face course to an online authentic learning environment was accomplished through EDR and concludes with a discussion of design principles derived from the research. The results of a beta test of the new online course with 12 participants are also described in the paper.",

The conduct of clinical research in accordance with the principles of GCP helps to ensure that clinical research participants are not exposed to undue risk, and that data generated from the research are valid and accurate (Institute of Medicine 1999; Bhatt 2011; Garattini et al. 2016) . By providing a basis both for the scientific and ethical integrity of research involving human subjects and for generating valid observations and sound documentation of the findings, GCP not only serves the interests of the parties actively involved in the research process, but also protects the safety and wellbeing of people who will be prescribed the tested drugs in the future. Traditionally, the system of quality assurance has relied on audits and inspection of the clinical trial sites by relevant regulatory authorities. Developing the knowledge, skills, and attitudes of inspectors so they can perform their jobs competently-safely, effectively, and efficiently-is important in any endeavor. When it comes to clinical trials involving human subjects, ensuring that international ethical principles are observed, that the rights, integrity and confidentiality of trial subjects are respected and protected, and that clinical trial data are collected in a reliable and valid manner, the competency of professional staff responsible with oversight of good clinical practices is exceptionally critical because failures can have devastating effects (Clark et al. 2019; Eichler and Sweeney 2018) .",

In doing so, the online course introduces a \"risk-based\" approach to inspections. The analysis of the objectives of the two versions of the GCP inspection course presented in Table 1 reveals important differences. For example, the face-to-face course has 68% lowerlevel cognitive skills objectives and 32% higher-level cognitive skills objectives whereas the online course has 44% lower-level cognitive skills objectives and 56% higher-level cognitive skills objectives.",

Nonetheless, some activities were possible to be integrated into both course modalities. For example, in the 'Introduction to GCP Principles,' a card game requires participants to match a total of 14 GCP principles with 14 corresponding applications of these GCP principles. In the face-toface course, the game is played with cards attached to the wall and participants matched 14 cards in small groups. Then, each group is visited by the other groups and facilitators, and the results were discussed. In the online version, we added more challenge in that anytime the participant made a mistake in matching, he/she lost everything that have been correctly done before, thus forcing them to start again. This matching activity in the face-to-face course takes 30 min, however, in the online course, the time is not prespecified although learners must complete it within 2 days.

Naturally, individual tasks required less time compared to group tasks. For example, case studies with similar weight had to be completed within 2-3 days for individual tasks, but participants were given 6 days for group work. Group work was always a challenge for participants being in different time zones and having different cultural backgrounds. Some groups were more successful in coming together than others. For example, one group came up with an additional means of communication among the group members by using WhatsApp. It was critical to watch how participants were collaborating to scaffold their interactions when needed. This was mainly done by the course manager.

The experience of this project and other efforts to develop truly innovative authentic e-learning courses carried out by the World Health Organization over the past decade demonstrates the value of employing EDR rather than traditional instructional design techniques alone. EDR evolves through three main phases, each of which may be repeated multiple times: analysis/exploration, design/construction, and evaluation/reflection. In the first phase of EDR, researchers, designers, and practitioners collaborate closely with one another to learn about the root causes of the problem being tackled.
