With the spread of coronavirus, people have faced extreme uncertainty due to evolving information, calls for behavior change, and economic shocks. As states move through different stages of the response and plan a path back to normalcy, it is important to develop ways to gather and measure insights into how Americans are responding to the challenges and uncertainties posed by the pandemic. 1 This will help policy-makers know what to focus on as we continue to navigate the COVID-19 outbreak. In particular, is it important to understand the changes and patterns in Americans' information-seeking over the course of the pandemic, both as a window into key concerns as they emerge and as potential signals of actual behavior change.",

[11] [12] [13] [14] Initial research on COVID-19 in the US using Google Trends data has shown increases in general virus information seeking, but to date most studies explore a singular issue over time or in a specific geography, without examining comprehensive search pattern correlations or geographical heterogeneity, and their potential implications. [15] [16] [17] Google Trends offers immense potential for generating temporally and geographically specific insights into the beliefs, behaviors, and actions of various communities in their response to the coronavirus.",

Specifically, what is the relationship between the coronavirus outbreak and internet searches related to healthcare seeking, government support programs, media sources of different ideologies, planning around social activities, travel, and food, and new coronavirus-specific behaviors and concerns? We would expect certain types of searches (e.g. healthcare related inquiries, government safety net programs, online food delivery) to become more popular, while others fall in popularity (e.g. nearby bars, travel plans). These time trends provide clear contextual information on the changing interests and concerns of Americans as the pandemic progresses, and we can also compare the timing of these changes with real-world actions and events like policy announcements.",

Notably, there is high search interest in coronavirus symptoms and behaviors but declining interest in other health issues. The news media is critical to information seeking, and during the month of March 2020, Americans made some big shifts in informationseeking indicative of socio-behavioral changes even before government policy began. However, we also observed the relative increase in popularity of searches on financial concerns. While there is geographical variation in information-seeking patterns, we were also able to identify search patterns for specific states, pointing to potential public health vulnerabilities that should be addressed.",

For example, RSVs for \"social distancing\" and \"bar/restaurant nearby\" were quickly increasing and decreasing, respectively, by March 8th -3 days before the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic, 5 days before the US federal government's national emergency declaration, and 8 days before the government released official social distancing guidelines. Furthermore, \"how to make a coronavirus mask\" was already relatively popular (RSV> 50) by March 23, exactly 12 days before the CDC advisory promoting masks for the general public. On the other hand, the RSV trend for news on coronavirus and RSV trend for coronavirus symptoms were in sync, matching each other regardless of the ideological leaning of the news source. This suggests that searches for disease characteristics were highly correlated with searches for news coverage of the disease. Google Trends also preceded important real-life events -weekly unemployment claims and new Medicaid monthly applications Google Trends also showed potential value as a sentinel indicator for tracking and anticipating big shifts before they happen. We found high correlation between specific Google Trends queries and corresponding phenomena in the real world both before the epidemic (for unemployment and Medicaid) and during the epidemic (for unemployment). Two examples were selected -initial weekly unemployment claims and new monthly Medicaid applications. There was an extremely high correlation of 0.96 between the previous week's Google Trends RSV for unemployment applications and the actual weekly initial unemployment claims normalized to 0-100 (seasonally adjusted).

RSVs for coronavirus and ideologically left-leaning news sources were highly correlated with RSVs for fake news, but it is not possible to conclude whether this indicates curiosity or an earnest belief in the existence of fake news. Regardless, this finding underscores the critical and timely role that news sources play in providing information during a pandemic and why this information must be correct and trusted.",

In fact, increases in informationseeking for social distancing and drops in search for nearby bars/restaurants were already significantly declining a full 8 days before the government released official social distancing guidelines. Similarly, Americans were already searching for how to make masks 12 days before the CDC recommended wearing them. This suggests that while there are political, logistical, and other considerations, Google Trends can provide an indication of new and emerging behavioral issues to inform public health policy, by showing what people are already aware of and what interventions may be acceptable. Monitoring Google Trends can provide insights into an optimal approach to action, especially for fast-evolving situations. The right interventions, poorly timed, could be too early to be acceptable, or, as occurred with the coronavirus pandemic case, too late to be optimally effective. This also highlights the importance of local authorities in the fight against coronavirus. It is likely that shifts in search interests were more closely related to early local government announcements that preceded the national and global announcements used in our analysis.",

This is consistent with the decline in health seeking that occurs during pandemics: prospective patients for other diseases have higher risk perception of hospital-based transmission of COVID-19, which reduces their health-seeking behavior. 25 This is especially true in the US, where providers were instructed to prioritize coronavirus and relegate other services. 26 This finding has potential value as an early-warning sign of reduced health-seeking behavior. It could be of particular use in especially vulnerable communities with underlying health risks, allowing authorities to prioritize and precisely target these areas with messages about the continued importance of health care for non-coronavirus related conditions and symptoms.",

For example, in New York and New Jersey, two states with a more mature pandemic and, coincidentally, state-run (rather than federally run) health insurance marketplaces, people were searching for urgent care and for health insurance. Southern states tended to search for several potentially worrying factors in the fight against coronavirus, including searches for urgent care as the virus arrived (Louisiana, Georgia, and North Carolina), searching for Medicaid (Louisiana and Mississippi), and searches for stimulus checks indicating a needed financial safety net (most Southern states). The search for \"hoarding\" was popular in states with either large land areas (and less dense populations) or with especially extreme weather conditions -Alaska, New Mexico, Minnesota, Arizona, and Montana. This may reflect their populations' heightened expectations of scarcity during a pandemic, as these factors likely make these states hard to reach in the case of disrupted supply chains. However, it was not clear why Washington, D.C. had several queries, both positive and negative, as top concerns during March and April 2020. One hypothesis is that this is a product of D.C.'s role as the national capital, home to prominent government and news agencies providing and consuming coronavirus information.",

While correlation analysis and PCA are not new methods, this study expands the methodological approaches by applying both to a unique dataset. When combined, richer and more specific insights emerge -with both analyses identifying economic/financial factors, access to information, and/or interest in social distancing as key variables in describing states' information-seeking patterns on coronavirus. With PCA we identify Mississippi, Louisiana, Alabama, Arkansas, and Kentucky as Low-Information, Non-Compliant, and Economically Vulnerable states during the time window of analysis March/April 2020. This search pattern suggests that the states most vulnerable economically or in terms of the social safety net are also the least informed and show the least search-related interest in social distancing, a key intervention against coronavirus. This information can be combined with real-world data to increase awareness of social distancing and its benefits, while targeting and prioritizing resources to support these states -including increased testing, health system capacity supports, and economic relief measures for the population.",

Analytically, we worked at the higher levels of aggregation to capture the most comprehensive units of analysis. When investigating trends over long periods of time, beyond one month, we used weekly, as opposed to daily, RSVs. We also chose to work with the state as our main unit of analysis. We found that analysis at more granular Designated Market Area (DMA) or city level as provided by Google Trends was not robust enough for our purposes, because the coronavirus response is organized and determined at the state level in many cases. Furthermore, many DMAs span multiple states which introduces complicating effects, and the city level often has data missing, leaving the state level as the best option. Even at state level, there were a few missing values which were included in the trend and geographical analyses but removed for pairwise correlation and PCA analysis.",
