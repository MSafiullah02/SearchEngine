Because of its well-known historical geology in terms of plate tectonics, the social wasp fauna in the Indian subcontinent is of special interest from the view point of the biogeography of social wasps, especially for the groups occurring in Madagascar, the Indian subcontinent and Australia -that is, eastern elements of the Gondwana. The paper wasp genus Ropalidia Gu\u00e9rin-M\u00e9neville, 1831, is one of the two such vespid genera; the other is the cosmopolitan genus Polistes Latreille, 1802. made an extensive taxonomic study on the social wasps in the Indian subcontinent and recognized 22 species in Ropalidia. Gusenleitner (2001) added R. sculpturata from Nepal and R. tamila from Tamil Nadu in India (Gusenleitner 2004) to the Indian subcontinent fauna of Ropalidia. Recently, Lambert et al. (2005a,b) described six species from India, mainly referring to keys in . Unfortunately, the key to Ropalidia species in is at least in part barely workable, because those authors adopted the subgeneric concepts applied by van der Vecht (1941 van der Vecht ( , 1962 and , which often prevents correct identification at the species level (Kojima 1997 ). In the present paper, we give taxonomic notes on the Ropalidia species occurring in the Indian subcontinent, together with a key to species.",

They can be divided into the following five groups in terms of their distribution patterns: 1) Species endemic to the Indian subcontinent.The following ten species may be categorized in this group with regards to their distribution patterns, and they could be further divided into three subgroups with reference both to the mode of colony foundation (independent founding, in which a colony is founded by inseminated female(s) without aid of workers; swarm founding, in which a colony is founded by workers and associated queens) and phylogentic relationships with the species categorized into other distribution-pattern-based groups. 1-1) Independent founding, phylogenetically related to the species with wide distribution ranges. This subgroup includes three species: R. brevita, R. spatulata and R. colorata. The first two species are closely related to each other and to R. marginata, the related species with a wide distribution range; and R. colorata is closely related to R. fasciata, which has a wide distribution range. 1-2) Independent-founding species, phylogenetically related to the species that occur from the Indian subcontinent to the northen part of Indochina along the eastern slope of Himalaya. This subgroup consists of four species: one is R. tamila, which is undoubtedly closely related to R. magnanima; and the remaining three species are R. santoshae, R. sculpturata and R. kasaragodensis, all of which are in the R. stigma group and are closely related to each other and to R. birmanica, which is related to R. taiwana distributed from North Myanmar through Vietnam and South China to Taiwan. 1-3) Swarm-founding species.Ropalidia montana, R. scitula and R. sericea may belong to this subgroup. The former species is distributed in the southern part of India, where the species make large colonies consisting of 5000-60 000 adult female wasps (Yamane et al. 1983; Jeanne & Hunt 1992) . The species may possibly be closely related to an Australian swarm-founding species, R. romandi Le Guillou, 1841. Swarm founding, or even any biology, of R. scitula and R. sericea is not known, but these species may be swarm-founders judging from their morphologi-",
