The initial development of predictors such as PSORT I (Nakai and Kanehisa, 1991) has resulted in a wide array of methods to predict protein sub-cellular compartment localization on the basis of sequence information (Emanuelsson, 2002; Gardy and Brinkman, 2006; Schneider and Fechner, 2004). Although the usefulness of general localization predictors is without doubt, fine-grained models of cellular processes require insight into sub-compartmental localization of proteins, e.g. in plasma membrane microdomains (Buist et al., 2006) or sub-nuclear compartments (Lei and Dai, 2005).",

Sub-Golgi localization is important for various processes. In particular, N-glycans influence protein conformation, stability and biological activity (Lehle et al., 2006) and the sequence of additions and trimmings of N-glycans to and from glycoproteins is governed by the sub-Golgi location of glycosyltransferases and glycosidases (Colley, 1997). Most of these enzymes are type II transmembrane proteins, which contain a single pass transmembrane domain (TMD); in addition, they consist of a cytoplasmic N-terminus and a luminal stem domain which links the TMD to the luminal C-terminal catalytic domain (Breton et al., 2006). Various regions have been implicated specifically as localization signal sequence, depending on the enzyme being investigated: the length of the TMD (Saint-Jore-Dupas et al., 2006), the cytoplasmic N-terminal domain (Zerfaoui et al., 2002), and the combined cytoplasmic, transmembrane and stem (CTS) regions (Grabenhorst and Conradt, 1999). Experimental exchange of the CTS domains has been shown to result in altered enzyme locations with which the glycosidase assembly line could be redesigned for the production of specific glycan structures (Czlapinski and Bertozzi, 2006).",

Experimental localization of these and other proteins in the Golgi is relatively easy but sub-Golgi localization requires complicated experimental approaches and consequently, many proteins are annotated as Golgi-localized without known sub-Golgi localization.",

A predictor has been previously developed for Golgi versus post-Golgi localization, based on hydrophobicity and frequency of different residues within the TMD of type II membrane proteins (Yuan and Teasdale, 2002). Here we develop a predictor specifically for the sub-compartments within the Golgi part of the secretion pathway: cis-, medial- and trans-Golgi and the TGN. It is known that the composition of ER, Golgi and plasma-membranes differs (Mitra et al., 2004; van Meer et al., 2008) and likewise the membrane composition of the different sub-Golgi compartments may vary; we therefore reasoned that the TMD of type II membrane proteins may contain signatures that help identify their preferred location, even though these TMD characteristics themselves may not be the single driving force that targets these proteins to their location.",

Because the available amount of type II transmembrane proteins with known sub-Golgi localization is small, we followed an innovative approach where we use additional homologous sequences in the training set of our predictor. As prediction algorithm we chose the support vector machine (SVM) algorithm which can incorporate sequence information via the kernel function. A variety of string-based kernel functions exist, ranging from bag-of-words kernels (mainly useful for document classification) to dedicated kernels for protein sequence analysis, most notably substring spectrum kernels (which count the occurrence of substrings) and variations e.g. including gaps (Lodhi et al., 2002). We tailor the definition of the kernel such that it fits the nature of our biological problem, i.e. prediction based on TMD sequence. Since the TMD has a well-defined alpha-helical structure it is rational to take this into account when defining a kernel. This approach is an example of applying structure-based features in kernel functions, which to our knowledge has not previously been explored in depth. Our results show that this approach indeed can be used to predict sub-Golgi localization, and we provide several examples of valuable applications of our predictions.",

Because our main interest for sub-Golgi localization prediction is related to type II transmembrane proteins, a first filtering step was to apply transmembrane (TM) helix prediction to these sequences using TMHMM (Krogh et al., 2001). Only sequences predicted to be of the type II transmembrane signature (i.e. with exactly one TM helix predicted and of \u2018N-term in / TM / C-term out\u2019 topology) were retained. Since the number of type II transmembrane proteins with experimentally verified sub-Golgi localization information is rather small, no distinction was made between different species. Subsequently, these sequences were aligned with Muscle (Edgar, 2004) and clustered based on sequence identity, in order to prepare a non-redundant dataset for training and testing. Clustering was performed using the minimum variance method implemented in the R function hclust (Murtagh, 1983). The number of clusters was selected by assessing the inter-cluster sequence identity, which was found to rise sharply above 31 clusters.",

We took as a starting point the conjoint triad string kernel, as recently proposed in the context of protein interaction prediction (Shen et al., 2007). To adapt this to the biological problem at hand, we reasoned that in addition to sequential triplets, triplets consisting of residues with a fixed linear spacing between one another might be important, because this determines alignment of such triplets to specific sides of the transmembrane helix. Thus, we redefined triads to accommodate a fixed spacing of either 0 (the original triad definition) or 1, 2 or 3 (non-sequential triads).",

These models were obtained by carrying out structure calculations in CNS (Brunger et al., 1998). CNS topologies were generated with the CNS script generate_seq.inp. Dihedral angle restraints were defined for backbone angles phi, \u221265\u25cb \u00b1 20\u25cb and psi \u221240\u25cb \u00b1 20\u25cb, respectively, and hydrogen bond restraints were defined between each O(i)\u2212N(i+4) pair (lower and upper bound 2.3 and 3.5 \u00c5, respectively) and O(i)\u2212HN(i+4) pair (lower and upper bound 1.7 and 2.5 \u00c5, respectively). The anneal.inp CNS-script was used, which applies a high-temperature torsion-angle dynamics phase (1000 steps of 15 fs integration time step at 50 000K) followed by a torsion angle dynamics cooling phase from 50 000K to 0K (1000 steps of 15 fs) and a second cartesian dynamics cooling phase from 2000K to 0K (3000 steps of 5 fs). Ten structures were calculated for each TMD and sorted according to the total energy, and the lowest energy structure was used to obtain the kernel-features. Side-chain\u2013side-chain contacts were counted using a distance cutoff of 3.5 \u00c5 and each triplet of amino acids within this distance cutoff was counted as one occurrence of a triad, again using the amino acid grouping defined above.

In addition, it requires only three separate predictors, in contrast to the approach of testing each location separately versus the other locations. The cis/medial versus trans/TGN predictor was used to test the performance of the various string kernels. Importantly, the error estimates that we provide are based on a nested cross-validation for the SVM parameter optimization, which precludes over-optimistic estimates based on a \u2018single\u2019 cross-validation-based optimization.

Importantly, we tested that this spatial structure-based kernel captures more than only linear sequence similarity by analyzing a simple predictor based on sequence identity between the TMD regions. This predictor uses the localization of the protein whose TMD has the highest sequence identity to the TMD of the test protein, after removing all sequences that are in the same cluster as the test protein (an approach similar to the cross-validation procedure applied to the SVM-predictor). When applying this simple sequence-based predictor to the cis/medial versus trans/TGN prediction, the performance is only 42% (13 out of 31), and especially \u2018medial\u2019 turns out to be difficult to predict based on sequence identity.

In that case our predictor should function equally well for type II and type I proteins. Of the 14 type I transmembrane proteins for which we could find an experimentally verified sub-Golgi localization, 7 were correctly placed by our predictor, giving 50% accuracy. In only one of the 7 mispredicted cases cis-Golgi and TGN were swapped by the predictor.

Importantly, comparison with a simple sequence-similarity-based predictor again showed that this is not trivial: when for each mouse sequence a prediction is obtained by looking for the human TMD with the highest sequence identity, in only 23% of the cases this is identical to the prediction for the real human ortholog of that mouse sequence.
