            "text": "The emergence of the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in late 2012 caused a significant global public and clinical concern due to the disease high case fatality rate and the inability to distinguish cases of MERS-CoV from other severe respiratory tract infections caused by other pathogens [[1], [2], [3], [4]]. One study found that monocytosis with normal WBC and lower C-reactive protein (CRP) are useful predictors of MERS-CoV infection [4]. The clinical presentation of MERS varied from asymptomatic to severe bilateral pneumonia, depending on the case definition and surveillance strategies [[5], [6], [7]]. The case fatality rate of MERS-CoV has changed over the last 6 years, depending on the outbreak and its timing, comprehensiveness of the surveillance program (to include mild and asymptomatic cases) and the country of the report from 28.6% to 63.6% [8]. A lower case fatality rates were reported from a MERS-CoV reference center in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia [9] and from the South Korea's outbreak [10,11]. When compared to severe respiratory infections caused by non-MER-CoV, the case fatality rate was higher in MERS than non-MERS cases [1,9]. Six years into the MERS-CoV epidemic, there are few studies addressing the clinical predictors of mortality in MERS-CoV cases [11,12]. MERS-CoV had caused concern among travelers, however, MERS-CoV infection was reported infrequently among pilgrims performing Umrah [13,14]. There were reports of more than 20 travel-related MERS-CoV cases [13]. A single case of travel associated MERS-CoV infections caused the largest outbreak outside the Arabian Peninsula in South Korea [13,[15], [16], [17]]. In a systematic review of pilgrims, acquisition of MERS-CoV was very limited and systematic screening of pilgrims showed no infections [18]. There had been no asymptomatic MERS-CoV cases among travelers despite a high proportion in non-travelers [19]. A recent study included confirmed cases who were admitted to this hospital in 2014\u20132015 and found independent predictors of survival as younger age, not being transferred to the ICU and not receiving renal replacement therapy [20]. Here, we evaluate a larger number of cases over a longer period of time.",

In previous studies, mild or asymptomatic disease was observed in secondary cases, in young patients, and in previously healthy individuals [23]. It was described that as the percentage of asymptomatic patients increased to 29%, the case fatality rate decreased to 30% [7,12,[23], [24], [25], [26]]. Of the 314 symptomatic MERS patients, 24.8% died. This rate is lower than the previously published range of 28.6%\u201363.6% [[8], [9], [10], [11]].

Increasing age was a predictor and this is in agreement with a previous study where age \u226565 years was associated with increased mortality with an OR of 4.39 [12]. However, in that study age was the only predictor of mortality. Older age may be associated with concurrent comorbidities and thus increasing case fatality rate. In one study, predictors of 30-day mortality included older age, non-healthcare workers, pre-existing illness, severity of illness, and hospital-acquired infections [27]. We found that corticosteroid was associated with increased mortality. In one study, patients who received corticosteroids had a higher 90-day crude mortality of 74.2% compared to 57.6% among the comparator group [28]. In that study, authors compared 151 MERS patients in the corticosteroid group derived from 14 different healthcare facilities and patients who received corticosteroid therapy had delayed clearance of viral RNA [28]. It is probably the practice to use corticosteroid for patients who were not showing clinical improvements and thus might be at a higher rate of mortality to begin with.",
