            "text": "Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by SARS-CoV-2 and is currently pandemic. COVID-19 appears to have a mild course in most people but individuals over 50 years of age and those with pre-existing conditions may fare worse with relatively high rates of need for ventilatory assistance and subsequent death. As a novel disease entity without herd immunity, an available vaccine, or proven therapy, COVID-19 presents additional challenges for patients taking immunosuppressant drugs, including some multiple sclerosis (MS) disease modifying therapies (DMTs). Immunosuppressed patients are plausibly at higher risk for a more severe COVID-19 course although this is not established. Guidance for management of MS DMTs during the pandemic have been issued by national professional societies and patient organizations but is largely speculative as little has yet been reported on COVID-19 course and outcomes in MS patients with or without use of DMTs (Brownlee et al., 2020).",

She was advised to self-isolate at home and take acetaminophen. She returned 5 days later with worsening dyspnea, and chest x-ray showed multifocal pneumonia. Chest computed tomography showed multiple bilateral peripheral bilateral ground glass opacities. Absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) was 0.33 \u00d7 109/L (figure 1\n), similar to five months prior to hospitalization (0.3 \u00d7 109/L) and the range since treatment onset (0.19-0.39 \u00d7 109/L). She had elevated C-reactive protein (CRP), ferritin and lactate dehydrogenase, and D-dimer was normal (figure 2\n). The patient was admitted and hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin were initiated. Fingolimod was discontinued. Two days after admission, IL-6 was elevated at 23.6 pg/mL (normal <1.8), and inflammatory markers were higher (figures 2 and 3\n). Three days later, the patient developed increasing oxygen needs and chest X-ray revealed worsening airspace opacities in both lungs. She required intubation due to respiratory failure and was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU). She received one dose of intravenous tocilizumab 600 mg. She did not receive corticosteroids. One day after tocilizumab, IL-6 peaked to >400 pg/mL. Her lymphocyte count normalized 9-12 days after fingolimod discontinuation. While in the ICU, she also required hemodynamic support with vasopressors. After 10 days, she was extubated. Over the following four days, she continued to improve clinically, CRP level normalized and IL-6 improved. She was discharged 4 days post-extubation. Fingolimod was reinitiated prior to discharge, 18 days after discontinuation. At the follow up video visit one week after discharge, the patient continued self-isolation, and she reported hyposmia and dysgeusia.",

Fingolimod was discontinued upon hospital admission owing to concern that immunosuppression may worsen COVID-19. (Brownlee et al., 2020; Giovannoni et al., 2020). Fingolimod is a sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor modulator that reduces the egress of lymphocytes from secondary lymphoid organs into the circulation and is associated with increased risk of infections, especially herpes viruses, in patients with MS. Our patient's ALC was low since initiation of fingolimod (0.25-0.39 \u00d7 109/L); although this may have increased her risk of COVID-19 infection or its complications, this degree of lymphopenia is characteristic of fingolimod effect and neither efficacy nor adverse events, including viral infections, are significantly correlated with peripheral lymphocyte count. It is also possible that suspension of fingolimod actually increased her risk of later developing CRS and ARDS, though this would require loss of immunosuppression over just a few days, shorter than typically seen with fingolimod discontinuation. The patient's ALC normalized earlier than expected with lymphocyte reconstitution seen after fingolimod discontinuation (usually 4-8 weeks), which might have been related to the active infection (Ghadiri et al., 2017). Interestingly, fingolimod is currently under investigation as a potential treatment for COVID-19-associated ARDS (clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT04280588).",

Following administration of tocilizumab in the setting of CAR-T therapy, serum IL\u20116 levels may increase (Chen et al., 2016), presumably by prevention of the IL\u20116 receptor-mediated uptake of IL\u20116 into peripheral tissue (Nishimoto et al., 2008). Nishimoto et al found that as long as free tocilizumab was detectable, IL-6 receptors were saturated by tocilizumab and IL-6 signal was completely inhibited. A similar post-tocilizumab increase in serum IL-6, also observed in our patient, has been reported in other cases of COVID-19 (Luo et al., 2020) and may be associated with worse outcome but confirmatory data are needed.",

Evidence from the experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis model shows conflicting data regarding effects of anti-IL-6 monoclonal antibodies (Serada et al., 2016). Human data is limited to case reports with repeated treatment; one patient with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) developed MS during treatment with tocilizumab (Beauchemin et al., 2016), whereas another patient with RA and MS was treated with anti-IL-6 therapy for more than 5 years without experiencing a MS exacerbation (Sato et al., 2014). Although these reports suggest that IL-6 inhibition could cause or trigger CNS inflammatory demyelination, a report describes an adolescent with a tumefactive cervical demyelinating lesion who was successfully treated with tocilizumab (Hoshino et al., 2020).
