However, population immunity to influenza is complex and incompletely understood, raising the possibility of unintended consequences from UIVs. It is important to anticipate these effects and determine how they might be mitigated. Here, using a simple mathematical model capturing some essential features of influenza transmission and immunity, we present two theoretical examples of how a UIV programme could exacerbate a population's vulnerability to influenza. In the face of uncertainties surrounding influenza immunity, we discuss key areas that future work should address in order to develop robust quantitative estimates for the impact of future vaccines.",

Building on earlier work [18], we develop a simple model of influenza immunity and transmission dynamics in the USA (see electronic supplementary information for technical details). The model incorporates two types of immunity, as follows. (i) HA-specific immunity, which reduces susceptibility to infection and is acquired either through past infection or through effective strain-matched vaccination. This immunity is strain-specific and does not protect against novel pandemic viruses. (ii) Cross-protective immunity, which is assumed to be independent of HA-specific immunity and is likewise acquired either through past infection or through a UIV. This immunity is heterosubtypic: that is, it offers protection across different subtypes. Moreover, we assume that cross-protective immunity does not affect susceptibility to infection, but rather limits viral load during the course of infection, thus reducing infectiousness. This would be consistent, for example, with a UIV targeting T-cell antigens [19]; however, we note that HA-stem antibodies would be expected to offer some protection against infection [20,21] (table 1).",

Figure 1 shows one illustrative scenario, where the test population is exposed to a pandemic virus (to begin, we assume there is no supplementary UIV programme mounted in direct response to the pandemic). At low levels of UIV coverage, a seasonal UIV programme may in fact increase the pandemic size. Figure 1b illustrates reasons for this behaviour. By bringing down seasonal incidence, the UIV programme reduces opportunities for individuals to acquire infection-induced immunity. As a result, there is an expanded pool of individuals who have been neither vaccinated nor infected, and who are thus vulnerable to the emergence of a pandemic virus. However, the figure also illustrates that it is possible to overcome this population effect if a seasonal UIV programme has sufficient coverage. In particular, a UIV with 80% efficacy and 75% coverage would not only interrupt transmission for the 2012/13-like season, but would also result in a mitigated pandemic, relative to the absence of vaccination. Electronic supplementary material, figure S2 shows results disaggregated by age, illustrating similar dynamics in each of the age groups.\n",

The figure shows two scenarios: where routine vaccination is conducted using strain-matched vaccines (figure 2a) and where it is instead conducted using a UIV (figure 2b). Under the first scenario, the two epidemics are of comparable size. Under the second scenario, although the UIV succeeds in controlling the initial epidemic, it does so at the expense of strain-specific immunity. As a result the subsequent season, associated with a UIV escape mutant, is considerably larger than it otherwise would have been (the latter indicated by the dashed horizontal lines for comparison).

Figure 1b suggests a minimum coverage of 75%, a substantially higher threshold than the standard \u2018critical vaccination threshold\u2019 required to interrupt transmission of seasonal influenza (roughly 66% needing to be effectively vaccinated for a virus with R0 = 1.5) [26]. Likewise in the case of compromising strain-specific immunity, an approach that deploys conventional, strain-matched vaccines in parallel with UIVs, together with multiple UIV targets, could mitigate strongly against the risk of vaccine escape.",
