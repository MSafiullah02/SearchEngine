            "text": "Does the development of commercial nuclear power contribute to the spread of nuclear weapons? Proliferation policy is more complicated than superpower strategic weapons policy, since nuclear power supplies commercial energy to 30 nations, which could grow to 50. The START/SORT/New-START and ABM treaties involve only two nations (United States and Russia) and they do not impact commercial energy supplies. In 2012, 30 nations produced 16 % of the world\u2019s electricity with nuclear power for a total capacity of 374 GWe. The United States had 101 GWe of nuclear power in 2012, producing 14 % of its electricity. The US load factor rose to 90 %, as the new fuels remain longer in reactors, giving less frequent shutdowns. Many nations depend heavily on nuclear energy; these include France (63 GWe, 78 % nuclear), Japan (44 GWe, 18 %), Russia (24 GWe, 17 %), South Korea (21 GWe, 35 %), Germany (18 GWe, 12 %), United Kingdom (10 GWe, 18 %), and Belgium (6 GWe, 54 %). Some of these states have their spent fuel reprocessed (France, UK, Japan, Belgium) in France, UK, and Russia, but the foreign contracts are coming to an end. Most countries plan to use deep burial, but with few specifics. Japan has almost completed its 800-tonne, Rokkasho reprocessing plant, capable of producing 8 Pu tonne/year, while the Monju breeder reactor is shut down since 2010. Japan\u2019s fall-back position is to use MOX fuel in at least 15 light water reactors, but much is uncertain after the Fukushima accident. Other East-Asian nations (China, South Korea and Taiwan) are thinking about reprocessing, while they store spent fuel, waiting for a geological repository.",

            "text": "Nations obtain nuclear weapons more out of mutual mistrust with a neighboring state than fear of a distant superpower. Such a nearest neighbor interaction is exemplified by the (first/second) nation duos: US/USSR, USSR/China, China/India, India/Pakistan, North Korea/South Korea, Israel/Arab states, Argentina/Brazil, and China/Taiwan. Proliferation started with Klaus Fuchs and Ted Hall passing American nuclear secrets to help Soviet designers. Friendly cooperation in the US Manhattan Project helped Britain on its way, and it has been stated that the United States gave indirect assistance to the French. The Soviets gave major assistance to China to help it become a nuclear weapons state. The French helped Israel with the sale of the Dimona reactor and associated reprocessing technology. Canada assisted India with the sale of the Cirus reactor, to which the United States supplied heavy water and reprocessing technology. China helped Pakistan with designs, materials, and missiles. Pakistan\u2019s A.Q. Kahn sold centrifuges & weapon designs to North Korea, Iran and Libya. And so the story goes. Such events prompted Tom Lehrer to write his song, \u201cWho\u2019s Next.\u201dFirst we got the Bomb, and that was good,Cause we love Peace and motherhood.Then Russia got the bomb, but that\u2019s OK.The balance of power\u2019s maintained that way.Who\u2019s next?

            "text": "Nuclear weapon programs usually grow out of dedicated national programs, rather than civil nuclear power programs. But there often is a connection between the peaceful and military fuel cycles that pass through reactors, making plutonium, or centrifuges that make highly enriched uranium (HEU). India, Pakistan, Israel, Iraq, Iran, and other countries used research programs to hide military programs. Proliferation watchers are rightly concerned when nations with small electrical power grids move toward nuclear power. If a nation risks destabilizing its small grid by connecting it to large nuclear power stations, there could be another reason. Similarly, small nations that plan to build an enrichment or reprocessing plant could establish a weapons program since it is not cost effective to enrich or reprocess on a small scale. As we discuss later, reactor-grade plutonium (RgPu) from civil power plants could be used, but in most cases these would be of a lesser quality. Still, reactor-grade Pu can be made into weapons of, perhaps, 0.5 kton, which is why commercial production and storage is monitored by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). And nations that practice work with civil-use plutonium gain knowledge that will help in future weapon programs. Thus far, the eight nuclear weapon states with plutonium weapons have used only weapons-grade plutonium (WgPu) from dedicated, non-power reactors.",

Hans Kristensen and Stan Norris of the Federation of American Scientists compile estimates of the global stockpile of nuclear weapons. Their results are published in the Nuclear Notebook in the Bulletin of Atomic Scientists and as an appendix in the SIPRI Yearbook.

Eisenhower claimed that nuclear fuel could be \u201cproliferation-proof\u201d: \u201cThe ingenuity of our scientists will provide special safe conditions under which such a bank of fissionable material can be made essentially immune to surprise seizure.\u201d Did Eisenhower mean plutonium would be immune to surprise attack because of excellent physical protection and safeguards? Or did he mean that ample amounts of the spontaneous neutron-emitter240Pu would prevent the use of plutonium in bombs? At that time, scientists incorrectly believed that 20 %240Pu gave enough early neutrons to preinitiate a chain reaction and greatly reduce the yield for all weapons designs. This belief has been proven false, but with qualifications.",

I agree whole-heartedly with Len Weiss: \u201cDid the 50-year-old Atoms for Peace program accelerate nuclear weapons proliferation? The jury has been in for some time on this question, and the answer is yes.2 \u201d There is no simple answer, to the broader question of \u201cwas the Atoms for Peace program wise?\u201d This author takes a long-range point of view. Eisenhower did the right thing because his policies fostered the establishment of the IAEA in 1957 and the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty in 1970. Alone, the United States has never had the leverage to dictate its wishes to all nations. With all nations agreeing on a common framework of rules and inspections, the world can act in concert. Without the IAEA and NPT, which are the international nuclear regime, the world community would not have an effective way to exercise control over NNWS weapons programs and plutonium/uranium stockpiles. With the passage of time, the technical barriers to make nuclear weapons become smaller as secrets leak and technologies improve. Without a global, political commitment to nonproliferation, the march of technology would be unstoppable.",

The Indian scientists who reprocessed plutonium at Argonne and Oak Ridge went home to help India produce its bombs. The NPT also gave cover to weapons programs that might not have existed otherwise. The Iraqi and North Korea violations took place, however, at undeclared locations that were not inspected. If IAEA members had allowed the organization to act more vigorously, it could have taken stronger actions, such as challenge inspections. South Africa developed its gaseous nozzles and nuclear weapons essentially, but not entirely, alone. They succeeded with an expenditure of hundreds of millions of dollars, much less than what Saddam Hussein spent on his covert unsuccessful program. There is no doubt that openness on nuclear matters contributed to proliferation.",

            "text": "The world had 438 nuclear reactors with 351 GWe of power in 2000 and 33 additional reactors under construction. The accumulations of military HEU and plutonium are shown in Fig. 5.2. The IAEA mission of promoting nuclear power and control of nuclear materials has grown substantially as its membership has grown to 140 states (Table 5.2). The 2000 safeguards budget of $80 million covered 902 facilities containing 642.8 tons of plutonium in spent fuel rods, 72.2 tons separated Pu, 10.7 tons in mixed oxide (MOX) rods in reactors, and 21.8 tons of HEU. The 10,264 person-days of inspections on 2,467 inspections applied 25,484 encrypted seals to containers, reviewed 5,226 videotapes and analyzed 626 samples. The IAEA appears to have a good record on declared sites with no major mistakes, as the famous Iraqi and North Korea violations involved undeclared locations. After the Gulf War the IAEA changed its procedures (1) to increase the use of intelligence information from large nations, (2) to take environmental samples in search of clandestine enrichment and reprocessing, and (3) to establish special inspection procedures for undeclared sites. It is not clear how effective these additional measures will turn out to be since they require more funding, but it is clear that a multilateral approach is essential for managing proliferation in a world of 185 nations. The 1977 Office of Technology Assessment report on proliferation concluded the following:\n\nIn the long run two general rules apply: (a) Solutions to the proliferation problem will have to be found primarily, though not exclusively, through multilateral actions, and (b) the extent of US influence will vary from country to country.(Nuclear Proliferation and Safeguards, OTA, Washington, DC, 1977)\n",

            "text": "A complete discussion of nonproliferation contains many elements beyond oversight by the NPT and IAEA:\nPlutonium economy. The U.S. abandoned plutonium recycling with the 1978 cancellation of the breeder reactor and reprocessing. This course has been adopted by many other nations.\nReduction in excess weapons-grade materials. The United States and Russia agreed to each dispose of 34 tons of WgPu, as well as 500 tons of Russian and 174 tons of US HEU.\nAn assured supply of uranium. To reduce interest in recycling reactor fuel is for the U.S. to be an assured supplier of less\u2013costly LEU. It is for this reason that the United States maintains control over reprocessing rights on spent fuel that has been enriched in the US or irradiated in US\u2013supplied reactors. Uranium supplies have been helped by a dramatically slowed growth in nuclear power, increased uranium efficiency of reactors, and conversion of weapons-grade uranium of the Cold War into reactor fuel.\nFuel Bank. This was first proposed in the Eisenhower regime and continues to resurface as the world looks for difficult solutions. $150 million has been committed to help nations with their peaceful fuel supplies if they are threatened for other reasons. The existence of the fuel bank removes the main argument for a nation to want enrichment and reprocessing.\nNuclear suppliers group. The supplier nations agreed to constrain exports of sensitive nuclear fuel facilities (enrichment and reprocessing) and require that all the importer\u2019s nuclear facilities be under safeguards.\nExport Criteria. The Indian bomb of 1974 created the climate for the passage of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Act of 1977, which requires safeguards on all nuclear facilities before exports are allowed. It also established criteria for U.S. when processing requests for reprocessing US-origin spent fuel by other nations.\nSanctions. When an NNWS moves toward the bomb, it will be denied nuclear power exports, military equipment, and other items of commerce. These enhanced sanctions were removed 2 years after the Indian and Pakistani 1998 nuclear tests.\nRussian weapons usable materials. It is imperative that Russian warheads and weapons-grade nuclear materials remain under firm Russian accounting and control. The US Cooperative Threat Reduction programs have significantly improved this situation, but more needs to be done.\nSpent fuel storage. The 35,000 tons of US-origin spent fuel at storage sites around the world do not have a final destination. The U.S. does not want to accept these materials nor does it want it reprocessed. Russia passed a law in 2001 that allows it to establish a large storage site, which could be a useful constraint on the plutonium in the event that it is not reprocessed. As of 2009, global spent fuel was distributed as follows: Canada (38,400 tonnes), Finland (1,600), France (13,500), Germany (5,850), Japan (19,000), Russia (13,000), South Korea (10,900), Sweden (5,400), UK (5,850), U.S. (61,000).\nFissile Material Cutoff Treaty. France, Russia, UK and US have declared a halt to the production of HEU and Pu, primarily because they have much more than they need. The fifth nuclear weapon state, China, is believed to have halted production, and does not have large stocks of these materials. But its rivals, India and Pakistan, continue to produce these materials. A global ban on the production of weapons usable materials would lessen this regional proliferation concern. The IAEA Additional Protocol requires declarations on the production and stockpiling of these materials. It allows inspections to confirm their declarations. Brazil and Argentina have not signed the advanced protocol, but yet manage monitoring without it. FMCT verification is not yet agreed, but if did not include the monitoring of all existing P\u20135 weapons materials it would be less expensive. It would be very difficult to establish the IAEA base-line levels for these materials. The U.S. uses about 2 tons of HEU a year for its fleet, a conversion to 20 % enriched might be a requirement. If FMCT verification was constrained to new production it would be a manageable assignment.\nAnti Ballistic Missiles: After $100 billion, missile defenses have faltered, but has the Israeli Iron Dome system changed the scene for tactical missiles?\nMilitary Preemption. Case by case? Iran?\nVertical AND Horizontal Proliferation: Ratified CTBT and START treaties at 1,000 total warheads would lower the political reach of nuclear weapons and assist non-proliferation efforts.\nZero Nuclear Weapons. In the near-term, it would seem that ratifying the CTBT and going from 2,200, to 1,550, to 1,000 nuclear weapons would not diminish the ability to deter an attack on the U.S. All have admitted we don\u2019t know how to get to zero nuclear weapons in a stable, verifiable manner as we climb the mountain through the clouds. Domestic and international politics are often fed more by perception than locked-in policy. Does discussion of zero nuclear weapons feed the angst of nations under the nuclear umbrella? Will it be necessary to have numerous B-2 fly-overs to reduce this angst?\n",

The June 1981 Israeli destruction of Iraq\u2019s Osirak reactor was decried by most members of the UN and the IAEA since Iraq was a member \u201cin good standing.\u201d Today there is little hand wringing over the unilateral attack on Osirak, since it could have produced plutonium for Iraqi weapons. This preemptive attack rolled back proliferation (counterproliferation), and such attacks may become more likely. As with all policies, there are upsides and downsides. Preemptive rollbacks get the job done quickly, while international diplomats argue and postpone. But preemptive attacks shake the foundations of international processes and due process, unless international organizations are part of the process. An examination of motives for preemptive attacks points to inconsistencies, but these have to be balanced against the degree of threat from proliferation. The military has long defined threats in terms of both capabilities and intentions. Preemptive counterproliferation appears to be driven more by perceptions of the intentions of nations, since many states certainly have capabilities. The 2002 US National Security Strategy states it clearly: \u201cWe will not hesitate to act alone, if necessary, to exercise our right of self-defense by acting preemptively.\u201d But in soured relationships it is often difficult to separate worst-case interpretations from lesser interpretations. Ultimately, counterproliferation can lead to assassinations of leaders. This outcome is constrained by Presidential Executive Order 12333, which, nonetheless, can be quickly nullified without the approval of congress. One might ask if less stringent criteria for assassinations could rebound to put leaders in harm\u2019s way. As the third millennium begins, there are ominous signs from North Korea, which withdrew from NPT (January 11, 2002) and from Iran, which was charged by the IAEA with violating the NPT for building clandestine centrifuges (June 6, 2003).

The U.S. dismantled 11,751 warheads at Pantex between 1990 and 1999, and it presently has about 5,000 warheads. In order to gain experience, DOE technical teams carried out monitoring experiments on 30 warheads and their pits and secondaries. Two basic approaches are as follows:\nAttributes: This approach measures basic attributes of warheads such as the following:Is plutonium present?Is it weapons\u2013grade plutonium?What is the age of plutonium since separation?Is plutonium mass greater than half a kilogram?What is the symmetry of the plutonium mass?Is the plutonium in the form of plutonium oxide?\nThe attribute approach can be spoofed if one uses 0.5 kg sphere of plutonium that has nothing to do with the warhead, but there is really no great incentive to do it this way.\nTemplates: Each primary and secondary of a weapon gives off unique gamma radiation. Reverse engineering of the gamma-ray data can lead to design information, but this information can be protected with information barriers and a closed process. Templates are accurate in terms of determining a warhead type from another warhead type. Arms-control advocates seem generally to prefer templates, while those concerned with national security secrets seem to favor attributes.\nInformation barriers: It is imperative that sensitive weapon design information, obtained in the measurements, be kept secret. Information barriers should prevent electromagnetic transmissions through the barrier. The information inside the barrier must not have memory when the power is removed.\n",

During 1976\u201377, Presidents Ford and Carter called for an indefinite deferral of spent-fuel commercial reprocessing, which was largely in response to India\u2019s 1974 nuclear test with a Pu bomb. For decades, European nations and Japan have had large plutonium programs for MOX fuels and breeders. The end of commercial reprocessing precluded the use of plutonium in MOX fuels for thermal and breeder reactors. The Ford/Carter decision was prompted by events in several smaller countries, where governments tried to obtain reprocessing plants.",

The Carter policy of a once-through fuel cycle without reprocessing gained adherents over time, as nations readjusted their views on the plutonium economy, but reprocessing continues in UK, France, Japan, Russia, India and it will soon begin in China. In the past, reprocessing plants had Pu losses of about 1 %, but they hope to reduce this to 0.1\u20130.2 %. The Japanese Rokkasho plant can reprocess 800-ton/year. This is enough for 1,000 warheads made with reactor-grade plutonium. A 1 % loss of Pu is (0.01 loss)(0.9 % Pu)(8 \u00d7 105 kg spent fuel) = 70 kg/year and a 0.1 % loss is 7 kg/year.

This approach had the advantage that the heat load in a repository would be greatly reduced, allowing more storage if underground storage was implemented. But, the U.S. stopped reprocessing in 1976, while other countries spent considerable funds with little progress. The U.S. was content not to return to any form of reprocessing. Politically, enhanced relations with India followed on nuclear issues, as India then received almost nuclear weapons state status, supported by most of the rest of the nations. The rationale was to cement Indian good behavior on nonproliferation matters, but it did create a large exception in NPT matters.",

My favorite reference for the technical details on nuclear technology transfer is the book, by Joe Cirincioni, Jon Wolfsthal and Miriam Rajkumar, entitled Deadly Arsenals: Nuclear, Biological and Chemical Threats (2nd Edition, 2005) published by the Carnegie Endowment Press. Each of these stories make fascinating reading. How did A.Q. Kahn take secrets from the Urenco centrifuge plant in the Netherlands to Pakistan? Why was the West so slow to take action on their intelligence that he was taking secrets? How was Kahn protected by the Pakistani government while he took trips to Lybia, Iran, Iraq and North Korea, hree said yes and Saddam Hussain said no. Why was the U.S. so slow to react? Why did Pakistan\u2019s Prime Minister Pervez Musharraf give Kahn a light sentence of house arrest. Any why did he make his statement in English and not Urdu. And so on. An excellent reference of the broader history of global proliferation is Stephanie Cooke\u2019s In Mortal Hands: A Cautionary History of the Nuclear Age (Bloomsbury 2009). Our purpose is Physics of Societal Issues is primarily to confine us to the technical issues, which must be mastered if nuclear proliferation is to be controlled. We need both right and left brains, but in this case, the left brain holds both history and physics. Since Physics of Societal Issues is a technical book, let us not repeat much of the proliferation history, rather let us refer you to Cirincioni, Wolfstahl and Rajkumar and to Cooke. Let the professor assign you these topics for the seminar part of the course. These books are excellent!",

In general the U.S. constrained itself on sensitive nuclear exports, but, nonetheless, these technologies managed to escape their secret bondage. Our wartime partners, UK and Canada of course were folded into the initial plans, but then separated later on. There is no doubt that nuclear exports played some role in proliferation, by increasing the competency of the new nuclear nations. This took place by coupling export contracts for nuclear fuel with reactor orders. When Germany and France made progress on their reactor designs, this monopoly was broken. The Germans developed the Becker nozzle enrichment process, which aided South Africa. Urenco (UK, Germany, Netherlands) developed centrifuges which found their way, first of all, to Pakistan, and later to North Korea, Iran and Libya. To counter US guarantees of nuclear fuel supplies, German worked with Brazil, selling enrichment technology to get reactor orders, while France worked with Taiwain, Pakistan, South Korea and Japan to market reprocessing plants in conjunction to nuclear reactor orders. In 1995, Argentina agreed to the NPT, and joined Brazil in mutual inspections, an example for other nations. Israel managed to get various materials from the West and has stated it would not the first to introduce nuclear weapons to the Middle-East, but, of course, a screw-driver turn away from that. The US fulfills its obligations to the NPT on Israeli matters, but it is involved in other ways to support them with aircraft and missile defense, which undercuts the spirit of the NPT.",

The terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon killed 3,000 and caused a partial paradigm shift from fear of nations to fear of terrorists. It is often argued that sub-national terrorists will more likely use conventional explosives and biochemical weapons than nuclear weapons. It is far easier to use trucks full of fertilizer, divert airplanes, or drop aerosol bombs in subways than it is to obtain nuclear materials and assemble a viable nuclear weapon. But there are reports of Al Qaeda attempting to obtain nuclear materials. Terrorists could steal Pu/HEU to sell to proliferating nations. Terrorism involves many possible paths and responses. How can the world really know the contents in 15 million shipping canisters on the high seas each day? Plutonium and HEU can be identified at airports, but only reliably with high-tech, pulsed neutron sources.

            "text": "It is more difficult to detect small quantities of bio-weapon materials than their radioactive counterparts. This realization has shifted the response from detection and mitigation to prevention and protection. Both the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) and Biological Weapons Convention (BWC) ban the production, acquisition, stockpiling, transfer, and use of these materials. The CWC has a verification protocol, while the BWC does not. After the anthrax attack in 2002 in the US mail, the concern about BW and CW increased. In general, chemical weapons are considered about as lethal per unit mass as conventional explosives and much less lethal than nuclear weapons. (Dirty radioactive bombs are discussed in Sect. 10.1007/978-1-4614-9272-6_7#Sec19.) However, biological weapons could be as lethal as nuclear weapons if they are dispersed effectively and widely.",

            "text": "Experts generally agree that BW production is not technically difficult, but effective dissemination is much more difficult. A dose of 10,000 anthrax spores can be lethal, while plague needs only 100\u2013500 organisms. Smallpox may exist in only a few places, but it is much to be feared as it can be transmitted from one person to another, regenerating its population. And smallpox needs only 10\u2013100 organisms for a fatality. Pre-vaccination can help to some degree. Antibiotics will have limited value for those infected within the target area. Sophisticated devices, such as the Handheld Advanced Nucleic Acid Analyzer, can detect pathogens in the field by examining DNA of samples and comparing to known DNA sequences of various pathogens. Gas chromatographs and acoustical sensors can identify many of the materials. Unfortunately, current defensive research exacerbated matters with development of a mutant anthrax that is resistant to antibiotics, and mouse pox that could circumvent the lack of smallpox samples. In response, the National Academy of Sciences recommended criteria that must be fulfilled before dangerous research can begin. It is interesting to point out that the NPT, the BWC and the Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR) all allow exceptions for peaceful research in the respective areas of nuclear power, bio-weapons and missile technology. Article X of the BWC gives the States Partiesthe right to participate in, the fullest possible exchange of equipment, materials and scientific and technological information for use of bacteriological agents and toxins for peaceful purposes\u2026. This convention shall be implemented in a manner designed to avoid hampering the economic or technological development of States Parties to the Convention or international cooperation in the field of peaceful bacteriological activities\u2026.\n",

What were its advantages and disadvantages?5.2\nEisenhower\u2019s Atoms for Peace speech. What were the advantages and disadvantages of the actions that resulted from President Eisenhower\u2019s speech and policies? How is this affected by advances in technology? In what ways did it promote civil nuclear power, proliferation and nonproliferation?5.3\nNuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. What are the trade-offs and responsibilities for the NWS and the NNWS in NPT Articles 1\u20136? Under what conditions do you think the NWS are committed to be assured suppliers of nuclear fuel?5.4\nSoviet Pu production. The Soviets placed 410,000 tons of natural uranium in reactors to produce plutonium. (a) How much Pu is produced if natural uranium\u2019s235U content of 0.711 % is reduced in the reactor to 0.677 %, and 0.8239Pu nuclei are created for every235U fissioned? (b) Why is Pu found on the ground near US enrichment plants?5.5\nSoviet HEU production. The U from Pu production reactors was reprocessed and used as feedstock for enrichment. How much 90 % enriched HEU was produced from 380,000 tons of U obtained from 0.677 %235U with 0.3 % tails?5.6\n1 tonne\n235\nU = 1 GW\ne\n-year. Starting with energy of 200 MeV per fission, show that a power plant producing 1 GWe at 33 % thermal efficiency consumes 1 tonne235U/year. (Some power is gained from Pu made in the reactor from238U. This is offset by the235U and236U remaining in spent fuel.)5.7\nU/GW\ne\n-life. How much natural uranium does a 1-GWe plant consume using 3.2 % fuel over a 30-year life? Assume efficiency of 1/3 and 0.2 % tails.5.8\nMining tails. Russia is using quality centrifuges to lower tails to 0.05 %. If Russia mines 350,000 tons of 0.3 % uranium tails, how many tons of 4.4 % fuel can be produced? How many GWe-years of fuel can be obtained?5.9\nMass difference and mass ratio. What is the one-stage separation factor for separating6Li from7Li with (a) thermal-diffusion, (b) gaseous-diffusion, and (c) centrifuges, using text parameters?5.10\nLi laser isotope separation. (a) Show that the isotope shift frequency is proportional to the difference of the root mean square of the nuclear radii of235U and238U. (b) What is the isotope shift between6Li and7Li?

(a) Show that it takes 11 kg of natural uranium and 7 kg to make 1 kg of 4.4 % fuel, with 0.2 % tails. (b) What does it cost to make 1 kg ifSWUs cost $100 and natural uranium costs $30/kg. (c) How many SWUs, in kilograms of natural uranium and dollars does it take to make 1 kg of 93.3 % enriched? (d) How many SWUs are needed to operate a 1-GWe plant for a year? How many weapons could be made with this SWU amount? (e) What fraction of separative work is saved by making 90 % HEU from 4.4 % enriched starting material?5.14\nResearch reactor fuel. (a) By what factor should uranium density be increased to maintain power if enrichment is dropped from 90 % to 20 %? (b) What is the fractional savings in SWU, in kilograms of natural uranium and in dollars, by shifting from 90 % to 20 % at 0.2 % tails?5.15\nBreeder capital cost versus uranium price. Breeder reactor capital costs are perhaps 50 % higher than capital costs for an LWR. However, LWRs use more natural uranium and enrichment services than do breeders. If an LWR uses 22 tonnes per year of 4.4 % fuel, what is the cost per year if natural uranium costs $33/kg and a kg-SWU costs $100? On a breakeven basis, how much can the breeder capital cost exceed the capital cost of the LWR if the carrying cost is 10 %/year? (This ignores reprocessing and MOX fabrication costs. See Sect. 10.1007/978-1-4614-9272-6_16#Sec25.)5.16\nMonitoring spent fuel rods. A country removed 250 of its 1,000 fuel assemblies that are under IAEA safeguards. (a) What is the probability that an inspection of one assembly discovers a violation? (b) Show that the probability of a violation being discovered with n inspections is P = 1 \u2212 (1 \u2212 f)n with fraction of violations f = V/N, where V is number of violations and N is number of declared fuel assemblies. (c) What is the probability of detection for 1, 3, and 5 inspections?5.17\nMton to MW. The text assumed Russia mixed natural uranium with the 500 tons of 90 % HEU, but they use 1.5 % enriched to avoid health problems from excess234U. (a) How many tons of 4.4 % fuel result from a 1.5 % feed? (b) How many GWe-year of fuel will this provide?5.18\nUSEC problems for HEU-Russia. The privatization of the US Enrichment Corporation complicates funds for Russia since USEC wants to return an equivalent amount of natural uranium. Using the values given in the text, what fraction of the $12 billion is for uranium, and what fraction is for the enrichment services?5.19\nSuper burn-up fuel. Scientists hope to create robust fuels that can sustain a burn-up of 60,000 MWt-day/tonne. (a) How much natural uranium would be saved compared to 30,000 and 45,000 MWt-day/tonne fuels for the US\u2019s 100 GWe? (b) What is the fractional reduction in spent fuel?5.20\nWorld Trade Center (9-11-2001). Building structures are constructed to carry twice the weight that is above each floor. If flames weaken the columns until they collapse, dropping the material above 3.5 m, what force is needed to stop the falling material in 5 cm? How does that compare to the maximum support force? What is the deceleration? How do you explain the fact that WTC Building Seven had an acceleration of g for two seconds?5.21\nOctober 2001 anthrax. Five people died and 22 were sickened with anthraxladen letters. The United States purchased several 10-MeV, 18-kW electron accelerators that can sanitize mail at 570 kg/h.
