This understanding has prompted the pursuit of microbiological methods to diagnose, prevent and treat dental infections.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Bacteria in saliva"}, {"text": "The periodontopathic microbiota has been studied for the purpose of developing more effective diagnostic tests and treatments (12, 165) . As periodontopathic bacteria also colonize the tongue dorsum and other nondental sites (43, 131) , and can be transferred via saliva to close family members (17) , periodontitis therapeutic measures ought to target periodontal pathogens in the whole mouth, not only in dental biofilms, and may even include entire family units in order to prevent cross-infection. Umeda et al. (193) compared the presence of six species of periodontopathic bacteria in whole saliva and subgingival plaque from 202 subjects. Each study subject contributed a whole saliva sample and a paper point sample pooled from the deepest perio-dontal pocket in each quadrant of the dentition, and the test bacteria were identified using a 16S ribosomal RNA-based PCR assay (15) . A statistical relationship was found between the presence of Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, Prevotella nigrescens and Treponema denticola in whole saliva and in periodontal pocket samples, and in the event of disagreement, the organisms were more frequently present in whole saliva than in periodontal pockets (P < 0.01). The oral presence of Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and Tannerella forsythia was not reliably detected by sampling either whole saliva or periodontal pockets. Other studies also found that a salivary sample alone did not identify all individuals infected with A. actinomycetemcomitans (176, 200) . Taken together, a sample of whole saliva seems to be superior to a pooled periodontal pocket sample for detecting oral P. gingivalis, P. intermedia, P. nigrescens and T. denticola, but samples of both whole saliva and periodontal pockets may be needed in order to detect oral A. actinomycetemcomitans and T. forsythia with reasonably good accuracy. The reason for this is that A. actinomycetemcomitans and T. forsythia can persist in nondental sites, as best demonstrated in fully edentulous individuals (55, 194) . Umeda et al. (192) also investigated risk factors for harboring A. actinomycetemcomitans, P. gingivalis, T. forsythia, P. intermedia, P. nigrescens and T. denticola in periodontal pockets, in whole saliva, or in both sites (i.e. orally). The study subjects included 49 African-Americans, 48 Asian-Americans, 50 Hispanics and 52 Caucasians living in Los Angeles. Periodontal probing depth was positively associated with all six study bacteria. African-Americans were at increased risk (compared with Caucasians) for harboring P. gingivalis in saliva [odds ratio (OR) 2.95] and orally (OR 2.66), and at reduced risk for harboring T. denticola orally (OR 0.34). Asian-Americans showed an increased risk for harboring A. actinomycetemcomitans in periodontal pockets (OR 6.63) and for harboring P. gingivalis in periodontal pockets (OR 5.39), in saliva (OR 5.74) and orally (OR 5.81). Hispanics demonstrated an increased risk for harboring A. actinomycetemcomitans in periodontal pockets (OR 12.27) , and for harboring P. gingivalis in periodontal pockets (OR 6.07), in saliva (OR 8.72) and orally (OR 7.98). Age was positively associated with the prevalence of A. actinomycetemcomitans orally (OR 1.18), and with P. gingivalis in saliva (OR 1.20) and orally (OR 1.20). The male gender was a risk factor for harboring P. intermedia in periodontal pockets (OR 2.40), in saliva (OR 3.31) and orally (OR 4.25) , and for harboring P. nigrescens in saliva (OR 2.85). The longer the subjects had resided in the USA, the greater the decrease in detection of A. actinomycetemcomitans orally (OR 0.82). Former smokers demonstrated a decreased risk for harboring A. actinomycetemcomitans in saliva (OR 0.23), and current smokers displayed an increased risk for harboring T. denticola in periodontal pockets (OR 4.61) . Current and passive smokers revealed less salivary P. nigrescens than nonsmokers (127) . In sum, the study found a relationship between the presence of periodontopathic bacteria in whole saliva and in periodontal pockets, and pointed to the importance of genetic or environmental factors in the colonization of these pathogens. Salivary tests for periodontitis may show increased accuracy if supplementing infectious disease variables with ethnic and social factors and with smoking habits (177) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 126, "end": 130, "text": "(12,", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 131, "end": 135, "text": "165)", "ref_id": "BIBREF166"}, {"start": 225, "end": 229, "text": "(43,", "ref_id": "BIBREF41"}, {"start": 230, "end": 234, "text": "131)", "ref_id": "BIBREF131"}, {"start": 295, "end": 299, "text": "(17)", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 502, "end": 520, "text": "Umeda et al.

A high incidence of hepatitis A and hepatitis E viral infections occurs in countries with poor sanitary standards.

A study in cynomolgus monkeys found that the tonsils and salivary glands acted as extrahepatic sites for early hepatitis A virus replication and constituted potential sources for saliva-transmitted infection (10) .

Hepatitis B virus DNA was found at concentrations of >10 5 copies \u2044 ml of saliva in 15% of patients with chronic hepatitis B (195) . That concentration may be sufficient to permit horizontal transmission of the virus, and perhaps some of the 20% of hepatitis B patients, who contract the disease without a known origin of the infection, may have acquired the hepatitis B virus by salivary transfer (195) .
