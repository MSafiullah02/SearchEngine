One intriguing aspect of the 2003 SARS epidemic was the occurrence of super-spreading events, which accounted for 71\u00b71% and 74\u00b78% of SARS cases in Hong Kong and Singapore, respectively.8 During the SARS outbreak in 2003, SARS-coronavirus (CoV) was moderately transmissible, with 2\u00b77 secondary infections for every index case.8 However, infectivity was substantially increased when coupled with environmental factors: 138 patients, many of whom were health-care workers, were infected within 2 weeks as a result of exposure to one patient with community-acquired pneumonia who was admitted to a general medical ward.9 This super-spreading event seemed to be related to overcrowding and poor ventilation in the dry air-conditioned hospital ward, together with some contribution by the use of a jet nebuliser for the index case.10 Evidence of airborne transmission of SARS-CoV was also supported by positive air samples of the virus obtained from a hospital room occupied by a patient with SARS in Toronto, Canada.11\n",

Contact precautions and eye protection should be added when caring for probable or confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection. Airborne precautions should be applied when performing aerosol-generating procedures.3, 6, 7, 15 To reduce room contamination in the hospital setting, major health organisations have recommended the application of a minimum room ventilation rate of six air changes per hour in existing facility, whereas a higher ventilation rate of 12 air changes per hour is recommended for new or renovated construction, especially when caring for patients receiving mechanical ventilation and during aerosol-generating procedures.16, 17 Infection source and engineering control, including avoidance of aerosol generation with appropriate airborne precautions, and improvement of ventilation design in hospital wards warrant serious consideration for the prevention of nosocomial outbreaks. The MERS-CoV outbreak in Jeddah, and the increasing number of health-care workers acquiring the infection as a result of poor infection control measures, remind us of the need to go back to the basics of infection control to help prevent MERS-CoV infection in health-care workers.",
