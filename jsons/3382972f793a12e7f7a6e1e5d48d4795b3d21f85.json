The viral infections have been reported in more than 1700 humans, ranging from asymptomatic or mild cases to severe pneumonia with a mortality rate of 40%. It is well documented now that dromedary camels contract the infection and shed the virus without notable symptoms, and such animals had been infected by at least the early 1980s. The mechanism of camel to human transmission is still not clear, but several primary cases have been associated with camel contact. There is no approved antiviral drug or vaccine against MERS-CoV despite the active research in this area. Vaccine candidates have been developed using various platforms and regimens and have been tested in several animal models. Here, this article reviews the published studies on MERS-CoV vaccines with more focus on vaccines tested in large animals, including camels. It is foreseeable that the 1-health approach could be the best way of tackling the MERS-CoV endemic in the Arabian Peninsula, by using the mass vaccination of camels in the affected areas to block camel to human transmission. Camel vaccines can be to 40% mortality rate, mainly in countries of the Arabian Peninsula. 3 Dromedary camels are strongly believed to be an intermediate host and an important source of infection although the exact transmission mechanism is still unclear. [2] [3] [4] Human-to-human transmission has been documented, although this requires a very close and lengthy contact with patients. 4 In the most part, cases are mild or asymptomatic, and most fatal cases are the result of comorbidities, such as diabetes mellitus type 2, which is again very prevalent in the Arabian Peninsula. 4 Asymptomatic cases are estimated to be 2.1 times higher than the reported cases 5 and together with mild cases may serve to spread the virus from camels to humans. Primary cases that had no contact with infected patients are more likely to have contacted camels directly or indirectly. 6 However, camels are believed to be an intermediate with speculation that bats could be the primary host. 4 Dromedary camels were 80% to 90% seropositive, from samples dated back to as early as 1983, in African countries, 7 Arabian Peninsula countries, 8 and the Spanish Canary Islands, 9 but 0% in Australian dromedary camels or Bactrian camels, 10, 11 and several groups reported viral shedding from infected camels. [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] Nevertheless, despite the impressive and quick elucidation of many issues about MERS-CoV, there are gaps in our understanding of this emerging virus, such as the precise route of transmission of camel-to-human infections, the risk factors for contracting the virus, and the protective level of neutralizing antibodies (nAb). More importantly, to date, there is no specific antiviral or vaccine for treatment or prevention of MERS-CoV infection.

However, the virus does not infect most small experimental animals such as mice, ferrets, rats, and hamsters, mainly because of the different DPP4 in these animals therefore posing a challenge for developing a vaccine by delaying scientific investigation on the virus infection, pathogenicity, and transmission. A rabbit model was reported to support MERS-CoV, 19 but more small animal models were required to accelerate MERS-CoV research; therefore, susceptible mouse models were developed by different methods. The first model was developed by transducing mice with adenoviral vector encoding human DPP4 (AdV-hDPP4) delivered intranasally to enable mouse cells in the respiratory tract to express hDPP4, allowing viral entry and infection. 20 This model is easy to use and can be readily applied to a broad range of mouse strains, especially in laboratories with no transgenic animal facility available. Other models were developed by generating transgenic mice that are either expressing human DPP4 globally 20 or replacing murine DPP4 with the human ortholog. 21 subjects is yet to be investigated and determined. MERS-CoV replicates in the upper respiratory tract in camels, unlike humans where MERS-CoV infection affects mainly lungs and lower respiratory tract, and results in mild clinical manifestation with rhinorrhea. In experimental camel models, infectious viruses were detected in nasal and oropharyngeal swabs and in tissues up to 5 days postinfection, whereas viral RNA persisted in these samples for over a month. 18 All these developments and studies of animal models were conducted in less than 3 years and have accelerated our understanding of and responses to MERS-CoV. Some vaccines have already been tested in mouse, NHP, and camel models, as discussed in this section and in Figure 1 and Table 1 , although there seems a long way to go before establishing a robust animal model for assessing immunogenicity and efficacy of MERS-CoV vaccine candidates. FIGURE 1 Development of MERS-CoV vaccines for humans and camels. Three vaccines based on different vectors have been developed and tested (or planned for testing) in camels and in humans. Camel vaccination could block MERS-CoV transmission and prevent any potential outbreaks in humans, applying the one-health concept. Vaccinating humans, especially health care workers or individuals with comorbidity, could then further prevent MERS-CoV infections and outbreaks. Bats are included as a suspected primary host of MERS-CoV although this is not confirmed. MERS-CoV can spread from infected camels to (i) naive camels or (ii) humans who may or may not show symptoms but are able to spread the virus to more susceptible individuals, causing an outbreak Rhesus macaques (n = 6).

[28] [29] [30] This was attributed to the presence of N-specific antibodies rather than S-specific antibodies 31 ; therefore, using the whole S antigen in a vaccine could be as safe as using minimum RBD. In fact, some studies reported that nAb titers were directed against other parts of the S, outside the RBD boundaries. 32 A linear synthesized peptide, corresponding to 736 to 761 residues of the S protein (in the S2 subunit away from the RBD), induced nAb titers in mice.

Large animals such as nonhuman primates (NHPs) supported MERS with common marmosets showing moderate to severe infection as compared with mild infection in rhesus macaques (reviewed by van Doremalen and Munster. 22 ) Dromedary camels are strongly believed to be intermediate hosts and one of the sources of infection, although the mechanism of transmitting the virus to human", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF2": {"text": "CURRENT MERS-COV VACCINE CANDIDATES UNDER DEVELOPMENT 3.1 | Recombinant DNA and protein based vaccines Soon after the identification of MERS-CoV, several groups developed vaccines for preclinical testing.

Yet the Saudi Ministry of Health has shown interest in vaccines from early stages of development and held a special workshop in Riyadh (November 2015), inviting WHO officials, major funding bodies, and vaccinologists who are interested in MERS-CoV vaccines, aimed at helping and accelerating such process. It discussed the science, the funds, and the plans to set up a blueprint on the subject. There were also explanations of the Saudi FDA regulations on trials, in an attempt to welcome vaccine clinical trials in the KSA.4.2 | Target populations for MERS-CoV vaccine trialsThe question of who to vaccinate is becoming more critical as scientists have conducted vaccine studies in animal models and are now approaching phase I human clinical trials. Two vaccines have begun clinical testing: the DNA-based GLS-5300 vaccine that was codeveloped by Inovio Pharmaceuticals and GeneOne Life ScienceInc. is now being tested in humans by Walter Reed Army Institute of Research.52 The second vaccine, scheduled for a phase I safety trial, is the MVA-based vaccine that showed promising protection results in dromedary camels.38 Phase I trials focus on the safety of a given vaccine and are tested in healthy volunteers. Therefore, it is anticipated that, because of the safety records of MVA and DNA vaccines, the vaccines could move to phase II immunogenicity and safety trials, in bigger number of subjects by the end of 2017/18 and might also move to endemic areas, provided funding is available. However, the target population to receive the vaccine would be an important question.From the epidemiological studies, the MERS-CoV infects mainly middle-aged male, health care workers, and people with comorbidities such as diabetes mellitus and heart diseases.4 Therefore, these factors would set the criteria for selecting participants for phase II trials.Following safety trials, efficacy trials could be considered next, where scientists generally use a curable strain of the pathogen to challenge vaccines and assess if the respective vaccine is efficacious; this is being done in malaria vaccine trials (for an example study, see Hodgson et al53 ). For viral infections such as HIV, scientists need to rely on natural infection as a challenge model. Therefore, for a MERS-CoV vaccine efficacy, vaccinating health care workers, especially those in the ER and waiting for the next outbreak to appear to assess the vaccine efficacy would be 1 way of efficacy trial setting. Alternatively, vaccinating the contacts of infected people during an outbreak would be a way to assess whether these contacts can be protected as compared with unvaccinated contacts of infected people. This approach, called ring vaccination, was used during smallpox eradication campaign by the WHO vaccination program and was recently used for Ebola vaccine in Africa.54 However, this may become difficult for MERS-CoV for 3 reasons. First, it requires a very efficient coordination between scientists, clinicians, and health officials in endemic areas to identify volunteers, to get them to consent to participate, and to vaccinate them within the right time. Second, it requires quick actions, as the peak of the infection may not last for long, 2 weeks after the onset of MERS illness.4 Third, and most importantly, it requires identifying a large number of infected people with a high number of their contacts(n = 200-2000)  who are willing to participate; however, clustered MERS-CoV outbreaks are usually less than 255 cases,50,51,55 making it difficult to conduct a phase III efficacy trial during an outbreak.", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF8": {"text": "Therefore, vaccines could become available in 5 to 10 years if there is sufficient financial and logistical support. Because there is increasing evidence of camels as a source of infection, using 1-health concept to vaccinate camels might decrease the human cases, especially mild or asymptomatic infection, which may be undetectable but important in circulating the virus (Figure 1). Developing vaccines for animals would require less time, less cost, fewer regulations, and no cGMP manufacturing. If governments in the affected Arabian areas are willing to contain the virus, then a mass camel screening program can identify and vaccinate seronegative camels, which should not be a large number because 80% of camels are already seropositive. Camel vaccination can also focus on immune na\u00efve newborn (or pregnant) camels as well as seronegative imported camels.Lastly, a response to a future emerging coronavirus would be to develop a universal vaccine that incorporates a conserved region from most coronaviruses; however, this might be difficult if coronaviruses do not share similarities in neutralizing epitopes or immunodominant epitopes that are able to induce cross-neutralizing immunity. Therefore, the most realistic approach would be to increase the preparedness to respond rapidly to any emerging pathogen, not necessarily coronaviruses. This includes developing technology that can be easilyused for any vaccine development. For example, the cGMP manufacturing of MVA viral vector (used for a MERS-CoV vaccine) is based on chicken embryo fibroblast primary cells, which are not ideal for large scale manufacturing. Developing a cheaper and efficient cGMP cell line instead of primary cells would accelerate MVA-based vaccines. Another example would be to develop a technology that excludes the cold-chain transfer of vaccines that would reduce both", "latex": null, "type": "table"}}, "back_matter": []}
