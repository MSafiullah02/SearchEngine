Sonography confirmed malignant lymph nodes. The patient underwent an ENT examination with the identification of OPSCC involving the left tonsil and the base of tongue. A histological examination confirmed the presence of locally advanced oropharynx carcinoma human papillomavirus (HPV) positive. The patient completed staging assessment with neck computed tomography (CT) and positron emission tomography (PET)-CT scan, and the primary tumor was graded cT4N1 according to the International Union Against Cancer's 8 Th TNM classification system. Imaging showed that primary tumor from left tonsil involved tongue base (axial diameter of 34 x 29 mm and cranio-caudal extension of 30 mm). It was associated with the presence of some enlarged left cervical lymph node formations close to the vascular structures (the largest of the diameter axial maximum of 19 x 11 mm and cranio-caudal extension of 28 mm) The multidisciplinary assessment indicated to treat the patient to concurrent CRT according to RTOG schedule. Treatment started on 24 th February. The second Cis-platinum administration was on 16th March 2020.",
