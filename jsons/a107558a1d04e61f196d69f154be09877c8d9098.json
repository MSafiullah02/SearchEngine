Contact with a patient's nasal secretions before infection control measures were implemented was independently associated with a 22-fold increased risk of infection. Enhanced personal protective measures were progressively instituted in tandem with growing understanding of this novel disease. From March 6, health care workers were employing N95 masks for personal protection when nursing the first index case and her contacts. By the end of week 2, personal protective equipment (PPE) against contact, droplet, and respiratory transmissions had been adopted by health care workers attending to patients in areas involved in SARS screening or treatment (ICU, emergency department, and communicable disease wards).

The Communicable Disease Centre (which is part of Tan Tock Seng Hospital) is a specialist facility with a national role, staffed by experts in clinical infectious diseases, hospital infection control, and public health. By March 22, N95 masks were required when treating any patient in the hospital. On April 6, the wearing of gloves, gowns, and N95 masks was enforced during contact with all patients in the hospital, with visitors additionally advised for procedures with a risk of splashing.

For the prevention and control of SARS within the community in Singapore, the key strategy was to detect persons with suspected or probable SARS as early as possible and isolate them at Tan Tock Seng Hospital. Early identification of SARS cases was achieved in several ways, including active tracing of all contacts within 24 h of notification of a case, mandatory home quarantine enforced through the use of electronic cameras, and intensive education of health care professionals and the public. The effectiveness of these strategies was reflected in the progressive reduction in the time to isolation of cases over the course of the outbreak.

However, only three of the airplanes (carrying four of the passengers with probable SARS) had symptomatic cases of SARS on board; the passengers of the other flights developed symptoms within the first 2 days after arrival in Singapore (Wilder-Smith et al., 2003b) . In-flight transmission occurred in only one of the three airplanes with symptomatic SARS patients on board. This transmission was to only one person, a stewardess who had served and cleaned the tray of the passenger with SARS on the flight from New York to Singapore via Frankfurt (March 14) (Wilder-Smith et al., 2003a) . The passenger was a doctor who had treated the first admitted case of SARS in Singapore at a time when the new disease had not yet been identified and no infection control measures were in place. At disembarkation, the passengers were briefed on the symptoms of SARS and advised to seek prompt health care should they develop symptoms. None of the 82 passengers who disembarked in Frankfurt, or the 28 who disembarked in Singapore developed SARS. Very stringent steps were taken to minimize the possibility of exporting cases to other countries. These measures included rapid containment of outbreaks in Singapore, and mandatory temperature screening of all outgoing travelers from Singapore. In addition, special bilateral arrangements on the exchange of information necessary to conduct contact tracing and quarantine was set up with both Malaysia and Indonesia. Singapore also initiated a similar multilateral agreement among the ten member countries of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations plus China, Japan, and the Republic of Korea (ASEAN + 3) in view of the possible spread of infection by travelers.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 516, "end": 544, "text": "(Wilder-Smith et al., 2003b)", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 783, "end": 811, "text": "(Wilder-Smith et al., 2003b)", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 1106, "end": 1134, "text": "(Wilder-Smith et al., 2003a)", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Containment of SARS at Border Checkpoints"}, {"text": "During the outbreak of SARS in Singapore from 1 March to 11 May 2003, various measures were undertaken at the national level to control and eliminate the transmission of the infection. During the initial period of the epidemic, communication with the public was achieved through press releases and media coverage of the epidemic. About a month into the epidemic, a public education campaign was mounted to educate Singaporeans on SARS and the adoption of appropriate social behavior to prevent the spread of the disease. Rigorous preventive measures were implemented by various ministries. For example, the Ministry of Education issued a personal thermometer to every student, taught students about SARS and how to check their temperatures, and required students and staff to declare their travel history. Standard operating procedures for screening children at child-care centers and kindergartens were implemented. The Ministry of Defense conducted daily screening of all recruits and national servicemen who were undergoing in-camp training, and issued personal thermometers to all personnel, including the Singapore Armed Forces. The Ministry of Environment checked sewerage systems and required environmental workers and market stallholders to take their temperatures twice a day. The government of Singapore disseminated information on SARS and encouraged the general public to adopt good health practices, such as measuring body temperature and restraining \"socially irresponsible habits,\" such as spitting in public. During the SARS outbreak in Singapore, \"fighting SARS\" as a \"shared responsibility\" was a central message. Prime Minister Goh's open letter in the front page of the Singapore main newspaper (Straits Times) urged all Singaporeans to practice social responsibility and civic consciousness in order to be \"good citizens.\" Singaporeans were also urged to give health care workers on the front line battling SARS their utmost support and not ostracize them. Contributions to the SARS Courage Fund, in aid of health care workers and victims of SARS exceeded US$10 million by the end of May 2003. A survey was conducted in late April 2003 to assess Singaporeans' knowledge of SARS and infection control measures, and their concerns and anxiety in relation to the outbreak (Deurenberg-Yap et al., 2005) . The survey also sought to assess their confidence in the ability of various institutions to deal with SARS and their opinion on the seemingly tough measures enforced. The study involved 853 adults selected from a telephone-sampling frame. Stratified sampling was used to ensure adequate representation from major ethnic groups and age groups. The study showed that the overall knowledge of SARS and control measures undertaken was low (mean score of 24.5% \u00b1 8.9%). While 82% of respondents expressed confidence in measures undertaken by Tan Tock Seng Hospital (the hospital designated to manage SARS), only 36% had confidence in nursing homes. However, >80% of the public agreed that the preventive and control measures instituted were appropriate. Despite the low knowledge score, the score for overall mean satisfaction with the government's response to SARS was 4.47 (out of a possible highest score of 5.00), with >93% of adult Singaporeans indicating that they were satisfied or very satisfied with the government's response to SARS. Generally, Singaporeans had a high level of public trust (satisfaction with the government, confidence in institutions, and agreement that government measures were appropriate), scoring 11.4 out of a possible maximum of 14. The disparity between low scores for knowledge and high scores for confidence and trust in the government's actions suggests that Singaporeans do not require high levels of knowledge to be confident in measures undertaken by the government to control the SARS crisis (Deurenberg-Yap et al., 2005) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 2290, "end": 2319, "text": "(Deurenberg-Yap et al., 2005)", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 3852, "end": 3881, "text": "(Deurenberg-Yap et al., 2005)", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "SARS and the Public"}, {"text": "A cross-sectional telephone survey of 1,201 Singaporean adults and 705 adults from Hong Kong compared the public's knowledge and perception of SARS and the extent to which various precautionary measures were adopted (Leung et al., 2004) . The results showed that respondents from Hong Kong had significantly more anxiety about SARS than Singaporean respondents [State Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) score, 2.06 vs. 1.77; p < 0.001]. The former group also reported more frequent headaches, difficulty in breathing, dizziness, rhinorrhea, and sore throat. More than 90% of respondents in both places were willing to be quarantined if they had close contact with a SARS case, and 70% or more would comply with quarantine following a social contact. Most respondents (86.7% in Hong Kong vs. 71.4% in Singapore; p < 0.001) knew that SARS could be transmitted via respiratory droplets, although fewer (75.8% in Hong Kong vs. 62.1% in Singapore; p < 0.001) knew that fomites were also a possible transmission source. Twenty-three percent of respondents in Hong Kong and 11.9% of those in Singapore believed that they were \"very likely\" or \"somewhat likely\" to contract SARS during the outbreak (p < 0.001). There were large differences between respondents in Hong Kong and Singapore in the adoption of personal precautionary measures. Respondents with higher levels of anxiety, better knowledge of SARS, and greater risk perceptions were more likely to take comprehensive precautionary measures against the infection, as were older, female, and more educated individuals (Leung et al., 2004) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 216, "end": 236, "text": "(Leung et al., 2004)", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 1564, "end": 1584, "text": "(Leung et al., 2004)", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "SARS and the Public"}, {"text": "The SARS outbreak in Singapore can be traced to the first imported index case that was imported from Hong Kong before this new disease had been identified and before appropriate measures had been put in place to prevent transmission. Progressive understanding of the clinical manifestations and modes of transmission led to the progressive implementation of infection control and public health measures and the successful containment of the outbreak, even without an early diagnostic test for this novel viral agent. Because of the rapid institution of measures to quickly identify and isolate SARS cases, more than 80% of the cases did not transmit the infection to their contacts. Unrecognized cases of SARS in Singapore were rare, but were the main cause of perpetuation of the national outbreak because they were not isolated early enough. Unrecognized cases were either due to atypical presentations in patients with comorbidities (Fisher et al., 2003b) or to concomitant infection (Wilder-Smith et al., 2004b) . The WHO definition for probable SARS states: \"A case should be excluded if an alternative diagnosis can fully explain their illness\" (definition from 2003 before sensitive and specific diagnostic tests were available). Whilst this definition is reasonable for epidemiological surveillance purposes, our cases show that it should not be the basis on which infection control measures are implemented during an outbreak (Wilder-Smith et al., 2004b) . Discharged patients from a hospital with known SARS cases should be kept under surveillance for at least 14 days after discharge, and readmitted to the original hospital should medical problems arise within this time-frame. All patients with fever, even when there is another known etiology, should be isolated in times of a hospital-related SARS outbreak. In response to the experience of the index cases in Singapore, these policies were implemented and contributed to the successful containment of the outbreak. Nationwide enforcement of infection control measures for the care of any patients (SARS or non-SARS) combined with temperature surveillance of all health care workers are thought to be the other major factors that interrupted the chain of transmission in Singapore. Although there were further imported cases of SARS to Singapore, none of them led to secondary transmission due to early identification and isolation. New imported cases need not lead to major outbreaks if systems are in place to identify and isolate them efficiently (Wilder-Smith and Paton, 2003) . Although screening at entry points may be justified in the light of the severe socioeconomic and public health consequences of a single imported case, strengthening screening and infection control capacities at points of entry into the health care system should be prioritized over investing in airport screening measures to detect a rare infectious disease (St. John et al. 2005) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 936, "end": 958, "text": "(Fisher et al., 2003b)", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 987, "end": 1015, "text": "(Wilder-Smith et al., 2004b)", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 1435, "end": 1463, "text": "(Wilder-Smith et al., 2004b)", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 2515, "end": 2545, "text": "(Wilder-Smith and Paton, 2003)", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 2906, "end": 2928, "text": "(St. John et al. 2005)", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Lessons Learned from the SARS Outbreak in Singapore"}, {"text": "The rapid containment of the outbreak in Singapore was due to a combination of strong political leadership, effective control and coordination at all levels, prompt and coordinated inter-agency responses, good communication with the public (Menon and Goh, 2005) , and collaboration with international agencies such as the WHO and US Centers for Disease Control.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 240, "end": 261, "text": "(Menon and Goh, 2005)", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Lessons Learned from the SARS Outbreak in Singapore"}, {"text": "Based on the lessons learned, Singapore has further strengthened its operational readiness and laboratory safety measures to respond to SARS.

New SARS Information Technology infrastructure has been developed and consolidated to support the surveillance and management of SARS. It provides MOH and other agencies with the ability to access integrated information about all SARS cases in Singapore in a timely fashion. For medical surveillance, there is the Infectious Disease Alert and Clinical Database System, which integrates critical clinical, laboratory, and contact tracing information on SARS. In addition, the Health Check System enables health care professionals in hospitals and clinics to identify patients who may have been exposed to SARS. For contact tracing and quarantine operations, the Contact Tracing System is in place to capture SARS cases, contact history, and HQO status.

At the yellow SARS alert level, the main focus is to prevent imported cases and detect any SARS cases that do occur early. Active surveillance and enhanced protection at high-risk areas in health care settings underpin the prevention strategy. Temperature screening of inbound visitors will be instituted at all border entry points. Within the health care setting, active surveillance for atypical pneumonia as well as fever clusters will be carried out. For prevention, health care workers in high-risk areas such as accident and emergency departments, isolation facilities, ICUs, and triaging areas will be required to don full PPE.
