Twenty-two subjects participated in the viral load test. In this stage, each subject was asked to put on a Type A PPC, then received 2 splashes (ie, 2 strokes) of 3.68 mL of diluted stain, sprayed from the nozzle at the trunk from a distance of 18 inches. Subjects took off the PPC, and fluorescent stains were counted. The mean number of spots of contamination over the face, neck, trunk, dorsum, and palm were 0.6 (SD = 1.12), 0.47 (SD = 1.81), 0.4 (SD = 1.12), 0.4 (SD = 0.74), 0.6 (SD = 1.24), respectively.

Type A PPC took the shortest time for take-off, which may imply ease of use. Type B PPC took longer as compared with Type A. The research team suggests that the light weight and thinness of the materials contribute to this. Because of these physical properties, Type B PPC can be easily lifted in the air, and extra care may be required to avoid contamination. Obviously, Type D PPC took the longest time for take-off, perhaps because its 1-piece construction (ie, from hood to body to trousers) forces users to take off the hood, then unzip the zipper in the front, then remove the trousers. This is a complicated procedure as compared with a conventional gown (ie, tie at the back, without hood and trousers).",

This may be because of the fabrics used (ie, poor water repellency and poor water resistance). Type B PPC offers poor resistance; thus, with a splash of solution, the fluid actually goes from the outer layer of the fabric to the inner layer. As a result, stains were found on the trunk. However, the research team does not exclude the possibility of contamination, though minimal, during take-off. Both the dorsum and the palm were heavily contaminated as compared with the other regions. This can be explained by the fact that participants used their hands to take off the PPC. However, the significantly high contamination in Types B and D PPC may reflect the design and materials used. Undoubtedly, the results of this study also provide good evidence for the need to thoroughly wash hands, especially the palms, to prevent the spread of infection.9., 10., 11., 12.\n",

This may be because of the feeling of weight over the front of the gown (the weight increased from 1.92 g [with 1 stroke] to 3.68 g [with 2 strokes]). Therefore, participants degowned with extra care. However, it is important to highlight that contamination of the trunk increases. Whether or not this is because of the high volume of splash with 2 strokes has yet to be determined.",

All PPC is similar with respect to face and neck contamination, except for Type D (for which there was no contamination at the neck). For the dorsum and palm contamination, Types B and D PPC were worse than Types A and C. Thus, either Type A or Type C would be preferable. However, when we examined contamination over the trunk, results showed that Type C PPC was much worse than Type A (Table 4). Data on air permeability (Table 1) suggest that Type A may be best if the PPC is to be disposable and is used for high-risk procedures. On the other hand, Type C may be the better choice for its cost-effectiveness (it can be disinfected and washed), but it is not recommended for procedures at high risk for splash.",

However, it must be noted that in real work, droplets are not generally as heavy as those produced in the simulation; thus, Type C PPC, surgical gowns, should still be considered. The cost is low, air permeability is fair, and the level of hand contamination is lowest among the 4 groups in the current study.
