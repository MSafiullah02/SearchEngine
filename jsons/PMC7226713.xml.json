Despite continued progress in renal replacement therapy and intensive care in the past years, the short- and long-term mortality still remains high, with a rate ranging from 50% to over 80% in patients undergoing CRRT [8]. However, there is scarce literature on the incidence, risk factors and long-term outcomes for CRRT in patients with TA-AAD repair. Identification of risk factors for CRRT in patients with TA-AAD may lead to timely initiation of CRRT, and improve clinical outcomes. This retrospective study aims to identify the risk factors and 30-day and long-term outcomes for CRRT after surgical repair in patients with TA-AAD.",
