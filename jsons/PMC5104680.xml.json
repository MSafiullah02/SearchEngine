Relationships between the occurrence of 1 or more viral wheezing illnesses in the first 3 years of life and asthma at ages 6, 8, 11, and 13 years were examined using logistic regression models of asthma, both univariate models for each virus, and multivariate models including all viruses.

Results are reported as asthma rates and odds ratios (ORs) with 95% CIs. A 2-sided P value of less than .05 was regarded as statistically significant.",

First, to address missing values for the number of sensitizations, 15 imputed data sets were created, using the aregImpute function in the R package Hmisc24 (http://CRAN.R-project.org/package=Hmisc), under an imputation model that included the number of sensitizations at each year (1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 9, 11, and 13); total IgE level at each year; asthma diagnoses at years 6, 8, 11, and 13; sex; wheezing history with RV and RSV during the first 3 years of life; fraction of exhaled nitric oxide measurements obtained from years 6 through 11; and atopic eczema patterns over the first 8 years of life. Next, classification trees were fit with asthma at year 13 as the response and the number of sensitizations at each year as potential predictors, using the R package rpart (http://CRAN.R-project.org/package=rpart); separate trees were fit using each imputed data set, and also a data set that averaged (median) the imputed number of sensitizations across all imputations. To avoid overfitting, cost-complexity pruning using cross-validation was performed on each tree. The consensus tree model was a 3-node tree formed by first splitting the population by the number of sensitizations by year 5 (0 vs 1+), then splitting the 1+ node according to the number of sensitizations by year 1 (0 vs 1+). Means and 95% CIs for asthma rates in each group were calculated by combining the estimates from each imputed data set using Rubin's method.25\n",

Because these data would suggest that the impact of RSV lower respiratory tract illnesses in early life on future asthma risk is greatest during early school age, we sought to determine whether similar developmental relationships were also true for RV wheezing illnesses in early life. Using a model to adjust for early life viral wheezing illnesses with RV, RSV, parainfluenza virus types 1 to 4, influenza types A and B, coronaviruses, metapneumoviruses, adenovirus, and enteroviruses, we noted a persistent significant association with RV wheezing illnesses in early life and asthma at all ages evaluated out to 13 years. The OR for a diagnosis of asthma at 13 years following a wheezing viral illness with RV in the first 3 years of life was 3.3. In contrast, we confirmed the Tucson findings that the impact of RSV on subsequent asthma risk lessened with time.",

Although the precise mechanisms responsible are still under investigation, laboratory observations have shed some light on possible explanations.27, 28 First, the number of high-affinity receptors for IgE on the surface of antigen-presenting cells is directly proportional to circulating levels of IgE antibody. Second, increased numbers of these receptors is associated with a decreased IFN response following the exposure of these cells to viruses such as influenza and rhinovirus. Third, when these receptors are cross-linked as occurs in vivo following allergen exposure, the release of IFNs is reduced even further. Thus, the development of allergic sensitization could result in a decreased innate immune response to respiratory viruses that could generate greater degrees of airway inflammation and the potential for airway remodeling and loss of lung function over time. Indeed, the number and severity of virus-associated wheezing exacerbations in early childhood has been associated with reduced lung function during childhood.29 These data clearly link early life wheezing illnesses (predominantly with RV) and aeroallergen sensitization and raise the question of whether early life RV wheezing illnesses cause asthma in childhood or do they identify a cohort of children predisposed to asthma. In addition, it could be asked whether allergic sensitization is causing asthma or, as listed above for RV, is identifying a group of children at risk for asthma. Regardless, the current findings extend our previous observations by demonstrating that these events are not only important in early childhood, but increase asthma risk at least until the onset of adolescence. If primary prevention for asthma is possible, treatments aimed at attenuating or abrogating specific IgE antibody production and viral illnesses appear to be prime targets.Clinical ImplicationsOutpatient viral wheezing illnesses with RV and aeroallergen sensitization during the first 3 years of life increase asthma risk not only at school age but during adolescence as well.\n",
