Despite initial delays in recognising the scale of the threat, most resource rich countries have been able to contain exponential epidemic growth by implementing strict social/physical distancing. However, this is far more challenging in poor countries where effective social/physical distancing is near impossible to enforce and sustain for an extended period of time. These countries may be partially protected by their younger age demographic, since young people tend to develop mild disease.",

A targeted strategy of short term lockdown once \u2018near herd immunity\u2019 levels have been reached (infection of around 40-50% of the population) could save many lives, without the excessive socioeconomic disruption caused by prolonged lockdown measures. Other practical interventions to consider include targeted social distancing that focus on the highest risk groups and particular \u2018hot spot\u2019 areas, strict attention to hand hygiene and universal wearing of face masks in an attempt to reduce the effective R0. It should be noted that there is little evidence that cloth masks protect the wearer (Offeddu et al., 2017, MacIntyre et al., 2013), but the aim would be to limit droplet (and possibly aerosol) production \u2018at source\u2019. In settings where social/physical distancing is highly problematic universal mask wearing might reduce overall environmental contamination and epidemic spread, especially from minimally symptomatic COVID-19 cases that unwittingly transmit the infection.",

Sweden provides a case in point, where limited social distancing has been successful in reducing exponential epidemic growth with some accrual of \u2018herd immunity\u2019, but the price has been high with many deaths in vulnerable groups. Given limited intensive care unit (ICU) capacity even in well-resourced settings, the effective R0 needs to be very close to 1 (<1.2) in order to prevent health system overload. An effective R0 of around 1 would draw the epidemic out over 3-5 years or more. This implies that social distancing measures will have to stay in place for a long period of time (being ramped up and down as the situation demands), while international travel will pose an ongoing risk of disease importation and subsequent epidemic spread in the absence of \u2018herd immunity\u2019.",

In fact, a high proportion of those infected report only minimally symptoms and may even be completely asymptomatic.

Potential benefits of facilitating natural infection in a safe and responsible manner include:1)immune individuals will be able to \u2018get on with their life\u2019 without the need for ongoing social restrictions and without putting the safety of vulnerable people at risk2)increasing numbers of immune individuals will build community protection. Given that SARS CoV-2 has an estimated R0 of 2.4 (although this may be variable in different conditions),(2) around 60% of the population will require immunity to limit transmission and protect vulnerable groups in the absence of any other measures. However, as a complementary measure it could support limited social distancing measures and will be additive to the immunity resulting from uncontrolled natural infection and that afforded by any future vaccine, which would prioritise vulnerable populations.\n",

Careful consideration should be given to unrecognised or delayed sequelae of COVID-19 and this should be specifically studied in young people who have developed mild disease. Better characterisation of the sufficiency and durability of immune responses following mild COVID-19 disease is essential, as is careful exploration of potential antibody dependent enhancement (ADE) of disease during re-infection. ADE has not been observed in any of the other beta coronaviruses, but SARS CoV-2 is an unpredictable novel virus. The acceptability and safety of voluntary natural infection of low risk groups requires better data and preferably better treatment before it is even contemplated. If the infection of large numbers of volunteers is not considered safe or feasible, then the infection of smaller numbers of volunteers could still be useful in assisting urgent drug and vaccine development (Eyal et al., 2020) and there is growing support for this concept (Callaway, 2020) \u2013 provisionally also from the World Health Organisation (World Health Organisation (WHO), 2020).",

This can be achieved through early active case finding with widespread testing, linked to strict quarantine of close contacts to prevent secondary cases to ensure rapid termination of transmission chains within the community. This also has ethical issues and privacy concerns, but broad consensus is that it can be done in fashion that still respects the liberties that underpin Western democratic societies (Hart et al., 2020). Alternatively, elimination can be achieved if very stringent lockdown measures terminate all transmission for a sufficient period of time to eliminate any remaining viral reservoirs. Patients who remain potentially infectious need to be kept in strict isolation, given indications that some people may excrete the virus for weeks, although it has not been verified that this is indeed live virus that can be transmitted (Atkinson and Petersen, 2020).",
