Infectious diseases are a major source of mortality, contributing to 26% of global human mortality in 2001 [Becker et al., 2006]. Cancer, allergy, and autoimmune diseases also cause significant mortality and morbidity in human and animal victims. Vaccine immunization induces strong host immune responses to the administrated antigen and provides a long\u2010term protection against a disease. However, an effective and safe vaccine for many deadly diseases, including acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, tuberculosis, and malaria, still does not exist. New approaches toward efficient vaccine target identification and vaccine development are desired.",

With the availability of large amounts of genome sequences, high\u2010throughput\u2010omics technologies\u2014genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, immunomics, and other omics approaches\u2014have been invented. Advance bioinformatics approaches have also been developed to support the analysis of large amounts of omics data at differing levels, ranging from gene annotation, data normalization, significant gene expression detection, function enrichment, to pathway analysis.

            "text": "Reverse vaccinology is an emerging and revolutionary vaccine development approach that starts with the prediction of vaccine targets by bioinformatics analysis of genome sequences. Predicted proteins are selected based on desirable attributes. Reverse vaccinology was first applied to the development of a vaccine against serogroup B Neisseria meningitidis (MenB), the major cause of sepsis and meningitis in children and young adults [Pizza et al., 2000]. The complete MenB genome was screened using bioinformatics algorithms for open reading frames coding for putative surface\u2010exposed or secreted proteins, which are susceptible to antibody recognition and therefore the most suitable vaccine candidates. Out of approximately 600 novel vaccine candidates, 350 were expressed in Escherichia coli, and 28 were found to elicit protective antibody response. It took less than 18 months to identify more vaccine candidates in MenB than had been discovered over the previous 40 years by conventional methods [Pizza et al., 2000]. Derived from the first reverse vaccinology attempt, Bexsero, a multicomponent, broad\u2010coverage MenB vaccine, was developed. Following the generation of comprehensive clinical and epidemiological data on Bexsero, Novartis submitted a Marketing Authorization Application in late 2010 to the European Medicines Agency for the use of Bexsero in humans [Althoff and Gassenbach, 2010]. This milestone occurred approximately 10 years after the first reverse vaccinology publication, representing a huge success in vaccine research and development (R&D).",

For example, when an outer membrane protein contains more than one transmembrane helix, the recombinant protein is often difficult to clone and purify [Pizza et al., 2000]. Therefore, the number of transmembrane domains of a protein can be used as a filtering criterion. Another criterion is the selection of bacterial adhesins that are responsible for adherence, colonization, and invasion of microbes to host cells [Sachdeva et al., 2005]. With the availability of multiple genomes sequenced for pathogens, it is also possible to run comparative genomics analyses to identify vaccine targets shared by many pathogenic organisms. These conserved proteins can be used to induce protection against multiple pathogenic strains. It is also important to compare sequence similarities between vaccine protein candidates and host proteome. A pathogen protein homologous to a host protein may induce an autoimmune disease or immune tolerance. The traditional immunoinformatics approaches for prediction immune epitopes can also be used for screening protective antigens [He et al., 2010b].",

The gold standard in vaccine target validation is a vaccination\u2010challenge experiment, which tests if a vaccine immunization is able to induce protection against challenge of an infection with virulent pathogen in vivo. However, such experiments are often expensive and difficult to perform, especially for deadly pathogens (e.g., human immunodeficiency virus [HIV] and Mycobacterium tuberculosis) that do not have ideal small animal models that mimic human pathogenesis mechanisms. Therefore, it is important to identify an immune response that correlates well with protection. For many diseases, an ideal immune response that correlates with protection has not been found. Omics approaches can be used to identify host gene signatures that correlate and even predict protective immunity. For example, to identify early gene signatures induced in humans vaccinated with the attenuated yellow fever vaccine YF17D, two studies have examined total peripheral\u2010blood mononuclear cells from human volunteers at different time points following vaccination with YF17D [Gaucher et al., 2008; Querec et al., 2009]. Microarrays were used to determine early effects (3 and 7 days postvaccination) of the vaccination on gene expression. A group of transcription factors, including IRF7, STAT2, and ETS2, functions as key regulators of the early immune response to YF17D vaccination [Gaucher et al., 2008]. A list of gene signatures (e.g., EIF2AK4 and TNFRSF17), which correlate with the magnitude of antigen\u2010specific CD8+ T\u2010cell responses and antibody titers, has also been identified and verified [Querec et al., 2009]. These gene signature profiles may serve as correlates of protection and be used in high\u2010throughput screening of vaccine targets.",
