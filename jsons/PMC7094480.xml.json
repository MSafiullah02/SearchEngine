We abstracted demographic, epidemiologic, and clinical data from the medical records of the newborns and their respective mothers by means of a standardized form. Demographic data collected included date of birth, sex, race, weight and gestational age at birth, and birth order, when applicable. Clinical data included Apgar scores at 1 and 5 minutes of life; evidence of severe (<10th percentile of weight for age) intrauterine growth retardation; age at first enteral feeding and type of feedings; administration of antibiotics and duration of antibiotic therapy; administration of total parenteral nutrition, indomethacin, caffeine, surfactant, histamine2 blocking agents, corticosteroid, granulocyte-colony stimulating factor, and cardiovascular pressor agents; diagnosis of patent ductus arteriosus, and respiratory distress syndrome or hyaline membrane disease and patent ductus arteriosus; placement of umbilical catheter; intubation and duration of intubation; exchange transfusion; and death. Epidemiologic data gathered the names of staff members providing care, as documented in the medical record, to the day of NEC diagnosis for cases and to the day of discharge for control subjects. From the mother's medical record, we recorded age at delivery of the newborn; history of prenatal care, cocaine use during pregnancy, and pre-eclampsia; human immunodeficiency virus status, when known; prolonged rupture of membranes and its duration; administration of corticosteroids and antibiotics; and history of gastrointestinal illness in the 2 weeks before delivery.",

Control measures included the cohorting of staff and infants, the mandatory donning of gowns and gloves when providing any care to newborns in the NICU, and the encouraging of hand washing. Hand washing was further facilitated in the NICU by the later replacement of antiquated sinks. Additionally, staff, parents, and visitors were asked to avoid coming to the NICU when they had symptoms of vomiting or diarrhea and to keep out until 72 hours had passed after resolution of symptoms.",

Results of statistical analyses are summarized in Table I. Newborns in whom NEC developed had received antibiotics longer than control subjects, although no specific antibiotic was associated with the occurrence of NEC. Although there was no statistical difference in the frequency of administration of granulocyte colony stimulating factor, pressor agents, or corticosteroids in the period before illness onset in cases and during their entire NICU stay in control subjects, newborns in whom NEC developed were more likely than control subjects to have received histamine2 blocking agents, indomethacin, surfactant, and caffeine. Cases also were more likely to have been diagnosed with hyaline membrane disease and to have required intubation, although the duration of intubation was similar in cases and control subjects. Diagnosis of patent ductus arteriosus was similar in both groups. Cases were more likely to have had catheterization of the umbilical artery and were older at the time of first enteral feeding. Although no newborn in whom NEC developed was breastfed, a protective effect of breastmilk could not be assessed because few control newborns were fed breastmilk (\u2248 20%).

Samples should be submitted for general viral diagnostic testing and for testing for NoV. Institution of barrier precautions, cohorting of patients and staff, and enhanced hygiene are appropriate while waiting for results of virologic testing. In the case of NoV, control measures are hampered by this virus' low infectious dose and stability in the environment, but should include appropriate hand washing techniques, disposal of waste and soiled materials, and disinfection.17\n",
