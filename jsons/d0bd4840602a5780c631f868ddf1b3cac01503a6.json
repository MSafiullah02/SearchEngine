The problem of drinking water is very complex and multifaceted, and, therefore, it is relevant for both high-and low-income countries. This is why access to safe drinking water and sanitation is among the UN's Sustainable Development Goals, i.e., Agenda 2030. [1] In low-income countries, when a centralized water supply is not available or the quantity is limited, poor households have to rely on water obtained from rivers, rain, or shallow wells. [2] The lack of safe water is a part of a vicious cycle, where poverty and poor healthcare feed each other. Water safety is also an important issue in high-income countries with centralized water supply since water-borne outbreaks continue to occur [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] directly by small communities and private homeowners. Several surveys in the USA documented evidence of viruses in ground water, [17] [18] [19] which is often associated with proximity of septic systems to water sources due to landfill leaks, improper wastewater disposal, and septic tank contamination. [11] It is estimated that about half of the water-borne disease outbreaks in the USA is due to untreated groundwater. [19] Also in the European Union (EU), where there are \u224885 000 decentralized small supplies providing drinking water to \u224865 million citizens, almost 40% of them are not properly monitored or do not deliver drinking water complying with microbiological quality standards. [20] In water treatment, virus inactivation, aimed at reducing the infectivity of viruses, can be achieved both by physical (e.g., UV-C and \u03b3-irradiation and boiling) and chemical means (e.g., oxidants and coagulants). [21, 22] Chemical disinfection, e.g., with chlorine, is the most common way of disinfection. However, higher doses are normally required to destroy virus as compared to bacteria, [21] [22] [23] and chlorination may also lead to toxic by-products (e.g., trihalomethanes and haloacetic acids) as well as residual infectivity depending on the water quality. [24] An increased reliance on UV light for water disinfection has raised the concerns for viral resistance, especially related to adenovirus infection, [25, 26] which is especially problematic for immunocompromised population, e.g., in cancer and bone marrow transplant patients. [11] Chemical coagulation using metal ions, e.g., alum (Al 2 (SO 4 ) 3 ), salts of iron, lime (Ca(OH) 2 ), and various polyelectrolytes is the second most common method of inactivating viruses from water after disinfection. [21, 22, [27] [28] [29] However, research suggests that flocculation does not remove all viruses exhaustively, showing varying results between log 10 virus titer reduction of 1 and 2.86. [30] Size-exclusion filtration is a very robust and highly efficient method of clearing viruses, which does not require using chemicals, heat, or radiation. Most common filters, including ceramic-and biosand-based filters, used in water treatment, while effective against bacteria (typically >6log 10 reduction) feature low virus removal capacity (typically, <1log 10 reduction). [31] Therefore, to be able to completely remove viruses from water, only advanced filters can be used featuring pore sizes of around 10-20 nm. In this respect, affordable and efficient ultrafilters, which are preferably produced from sustainable raw materials, i.e., nonplastic, are highly demanded.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 363, "end": 366, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 553, "end": 556, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 802, "end": 805, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 806, "end": 809, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 810, "end": 813, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 814, "end": 817, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 818, "end": 821, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 822, "end": 825, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 826, "end": 829, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 830, "end": 834, "text": "[10]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 964, "end": 968, "text": "[17]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 969, "end": 973, "text": "[18]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 974, "end": 978, "text": "[19]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1139, "end": 1143, "text": "[11]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1257, "end": 1261, "text": "[19]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1527, "end": 1531, "text": "[20]", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 1746, "end": 1750, "text": "[21,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1751, "end": 1754, "text": "22]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1925, "end": 1929, "text": "[21]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1930, "end": 1934, "text": "[22]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1935, "end": 1939, "text": "[23]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2101, "end": 2105, "text": "[24]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2253, "end": 2257, "text": "[25,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2258, "end": 2261, "text": "26]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2381, "end": 2385, "text": "[11]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2605, "end": 2609, "text": "[21,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2610, "end": 2613, "text": "22,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2614, "end": 2618, "text": "[27]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2619, "end": 2623, "text": "[28]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2624, "end": 2628, "text": "[29]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2792, "end": 2796, "text": "[30]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3172, "end": 3176, "text": "[31]", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "In the context of above discussion, cellulose-based filters for water treatment would be useful due to the abundance, sustainability, and cost efficiency of this raw material.

[34, 35] However, because viruses possess highly variable isoelectric points, ranging between 1.9 and 8.4, [36] adsorptive-type virus retentive depth filters show limited robustness and their function can be interfered by other competing charged species.

This is because during drying nanocellulose irreversibly agglomerates into a compact, impermeable film due to a process known as \"cellulose hornification.\" [38] Alternatively, solvent exchange, critical point drying, or freeze-drying can be used to produce cellulose aerogels but these are expensive processes, too, for industrial-scale production. [38] The advances in nanocellulose science allow today for costefficient production of this material. [39] Recently, a highly costefficient virus removal filter paper, aka mille-feuille filter paper, was described for applications in biotechnology. [40, 41] It is produced by traditional paper-making processing, which contrasts starkly from the membrane technology relying on phase inversion. This nonwoven filter paper, made from 100% cellulose nanofibers, features a stratified internal architecture, consisting of numerous cellulose nanofiber sheets-hence, its name is \"mille-feuille\" (or thousand leaves) filter paper. The separation efficiency of the mille-feuille filter was verified for surrogate nanoparticles, e.g., gold nanoparticles or fluorophore-labeled latex nanobeads, [41] [42] [43] and real viruses, e.g., influenza virus, i.e., swine influenza A virus (100 nm); [41] retrovirus, i.e., murine leukemia virus (100 nm); [44] and parvovirus, i.e., minute virus of mice (20 nm).
