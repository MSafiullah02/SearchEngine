Human-to-human transmissions of SARS-CoV-2 have been described with incubation times between 2-10 days, facilitating its spread via droplets, contaminated hands or surfaces (Kampf et al., 2020) .

Who knows at the moment how long such a lock down will last in many countries, and further what effect it will have on changing our mobility patterns forever. Will we get used to virtual meetings being the norm for office workers, will we want to connect to local communities more than those far away, will we notice and enjoy cleaner air from less pollution in reduction in transport movement and want to sustain this afterwards? But, given the benefits of mobility are not distributed equally, the disbenefits of mobility lock-down are likely to be faced differently by different populations. People who rely on medicine being delivered or on accessing health and care services, those not connected to the internet, those in more isolated and rural areas, but also those unable to escape those around them living in high density with others, are going to be disproportionally affected. Those that rely on mobility for their work and business may not be able to make ends meet, with jobs at risk without financial support and help from their government.",

In a recent correspondence van Doremalen et al. (2020) report on findings that suggest that the aerosol and surface stability of SARS-CoV-2 was similar to that of SARS-CoV-1 (which causes SARS), the most closely related human coronavirus (Wu, A. et al., 2020) , under the experimental circumstances tested. Human coronaviruses can, however, be efficiently inactivated by surface disinfection procedures with 62-71% ethanol, 0.5% hydrogen peroxide or 0.1% sodium hypochlorite within 1 minute (Kampf et al., 2020) . A similar effect against the SARS-CoV-2 may be expected, and preliminary research supports this. As no specific therapies are available for SARS-CoV-2, Kampf et al. (2020) suggest that early containment and prevention of further spread will be crucial to stop the ongoing outbreak and to control this novel infectious thread.",

Walking and cycling were highest among well-educated persons, households with low car ownership, and residents of high-density neighbourhoods. They note men were three times more likely to cycle. Similarly, McKay in this issue found boys are more likely to cycle than girls, and early training at around 10 or 11 years of age doesn't impact on later cycling rates. Reilly et al. suggest those taking up shared bike schemes such as New York's CitiBike scheme tend to be young and male and often already physically active being motivated by saving money and getting around quicker, more than physical activity. Could more localised mobility be the norm following enforced isolation or will we go back to normal levels of mobility?",

Cambra and Moura (in this issue) suggest changes in walking levels follow the magnitude of change in walkability of any interventions put in place. Many cyclists might choose low density roads regardless of their speed limits, yet findings from Vanparijs et al. suggest this is dangerous when such roads have high speed limits as they pose a high risk of road traffic collision despite not having high levels of traffic on the roads.

            "text": "This COVID-19 outbreak also highlights the importance of rethinking of the basic design of social and economic resilience, in particular for disadvantaged poorer and rural communities, during such a disruptive event. How do we keep people connected and active when literal or corporeal mobility ceases. Virtual mobility is an obvious solution, using technologies to substitute literal mobility, connecting people through online sharingbut again, this solution is only available to those who either have jobs that can be done from a distance or who are able to afford and use such solution. Further, the reduction impact of such solutions in mobility is not always as apparent as shifting activity online sometimes only moves actors around. In e-shopping, for example, it creates more delivery people than shop workers, changing mobility patterns rather than eliminating them.",

            "text": "Reducing hypermobility of our transport networking and focussing on local connectivity seems a reasonable solution from this. If we are to face increasing threat from viruses we need to have strong social and local economic capital in strong local communities and neighbourhoods to support one another without recourse to hypermobility. Perhaps a move to a more sustainable hypomobile practice is desired, a slow mobility focus, with more localised active mobility. Perhaps we'll all realise being closer to home is desirable, that social contact is vital, and we save our hypermobility for nothing but essential times. The positive advantages for transport and health in an increase in active travel, reduction in pollution, fewer road traffic injuries and reduced community severance and associated isolation would be hugely welcome; whilst of course, the temptations of economic, social, and cultural advantages of globalisation will very difficult, if not impossible, to ignore.",
