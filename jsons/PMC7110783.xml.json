The immunopathogenesis of SARS is not clear, while the transmission route of SARS has been clarified. The treatment of SARS patients with anti-virus therapy or with anti-inflammatory corticosteroids remains highly controversial [2], [3], [4], [5], [6]. Whether there is a direct viral pneumonitis (virus cytotropic tissue damage) or indirect immune-mediated tissue damage in SARS infections remains obscure. Patients with SARS tended to have prolonged fever, rapid course of pulmonary infiltration, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia and lymphopenia, frequently complicated with co-infections [3], [4]. A histology of lung necropsy showed abundant foamy macrophages and multinucleated syncytial cells [4], [7]. This suggests that leukocyte sequestration in interstitial tissue or apoptosis of circulatory leukocytes is implicated in the pathogenesis.",

            "text": "Earlier studies have shown that SARS patients with elevated polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs), but not lower lymphocytes, had worse outcome [4]. It is uncertain how the SARS patients had lower lymphocytes and platelets but normal or higher PMNs. We have recently shown that SARS patients appear to have altered mitogen-activated protein kinase activation patterns in different leukocytes, associated with increment of immunosuppressive mediators [8]. This, however, does not answer why lymphopenia occurs in SARS patients. O\u2019Donnell et al. [9] have proposed that apoptosis may explain lymphopenia of SARS. Leukocyte apoptosis plays a critical role in various immune reactions and infectious diseases [10], [11]. One of the major apoptotic pathways is the Fas ligand (FasL)/Fas pathway [12], [13], in which caspase-3 is a key molecule in executing Fas-mediated apoptosis [14], [15], [16]. Soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (sVCAM-1) has been implicated in many vasculitis disorders [17], [18] and leukocyte adhesion and migration [19]. Patients with SARS had lymphopenia [9] and extensive lung tissue damage [20]. Thus, we proposed that plasma sVCAM-1 levels might be correlated to vascular sequestration, resulting in lymphopenia or tissue damage in SARS infections. An alternative hypothesis is that lymphopenia could be related to an increase in plasma FasL and intracellular caspase-3 cascade. In an age-matched case\u2013control design, we measured plasma sVCAM-1 and sFasL, and intracellular cleaved caspase-3 expression of different leukocytes in 15 SARS patients. We sought to explore the relationship of lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia and clinical manifestations to plasma sFasL and sVCAM-1 levels, as well as intracellular cleaved caspase-3 levels in SARS patients.",

Once we had recruited one to three SARS patients for immune studies, we simultaneously included one to three age-matched healthy adults that had not been exposed to SARS patients as controls.

The progression of SARS can be summarized in three stages: (i) incubation period, (ii) febrile pneumonitis stage, and (iii) recovered stage or fulminant hypoxemia associated with adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). We therefore collected whole blood (4 ml) into an ethylenedinitrilo-tetraacetic acid (EDTA)-containing blood collection tube in the first week of admission (acute phase) as well as in the third week of admission (convalescent phase). The blood samples were separated into plasma and blood cells by centrifugation at 1500 \u00d7 g for 15 min. The upper plasma layer was harvested for cytokine determination after heat inactivation (56 \u00b0C, 30 min) of potential viruses, and the bottom blood cells were separated into red blood cells and white blood cells (WBCs) by dextran sedimentation [21]. The WBCs were then drawn into a 2% formaldehyde-containing Eppendorf tube at 1/1 (v/v) for inactivation of any possibly viable organisms and fixation of leukocytes. During the whole procedure, we did not open the original blood collection tube, operated the procedure in a P2 laboratory, and had the blood collection tubes autoclaved before undertaking standard bio-hazard waste management.",

Normal or elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and creatine phosphokinase (CPK) were also noted. These patients were treated under a protocol with initial institution of ribavirin 400 mg/m2 per day in the first 7 days after a loading dose of 2 g. These patients did not receive steroid (methylprednisolone, 1 mg/kg per day with and without pulse therapy 500 mg every 12 h for 2 days) until progression to pneumonitis or ARDS that usually occurred between 7 and 21 days of the disease.",

In a summary calculated from the results of 15-paired experiments, leukocytes with positive intracellular cleaved caspase-3 staining were significantly higher in SARS patients than in controls (Fig. 3B). In order to identify which subtypes of leukocytes had higher cleaved caspase-3 expression in SARS patients, we used a dual staining of anti-cleaved caspase-3 antibody plus anti-CD14, anti-CD4, or anti-CD8 antibody for this purpose. It was found that SARS patients tended to have higher cleaved caspase-3 expression in CD4 and CD8 cells than healthy controls (Fig. 4\n), although it did not reach a significant difference. The cleaved caspase-3 expression in CD4 and CD8, but not CD14, cells from SARS patients was significantly higher in acute phase than in convalescent phase (Fig. 4).",

This has raised the possibility of immunopathological damage of lung tissues due to exaggerated host response but not uncontrolled virus replication in the lung [3]. As previously reported, apoptosis of lung epithelial cells by Fas ligation may be involved in lung injury and fibrosis [27], [28]. We did find the plasma sFasL levels were significantly higher in SARS patients. Whether the higher plasma sFasL levels were related to apoptosis of circulating leukocytes or lung tissue damage remains to be determined.

Elevation of sVCAM-1 levels may originate in shedding from vascular or tissue inflammation. sVCAM-1 perhaps acts as a competitive ligand to inhibit leukocyte adhesion to inflamed vascular endothelium. Kitani et al. [31] have shown that sVCAM-1 inhibits T cell proliferation possibly because of the suppression of IL-2 production. Rose et al. [19] showed that sVCAM-1 could actively bind T cells but the binding is disrupted in apoptosis. This suggests that sVCAM-1 may be involved in adhesion and chemotaxis toward endothelium of circulating lymphocytes. Patients with SARS had significantly higher sVCAM-1 levels in the first week of illness but returned to normal levels in the third week. The elevated sVCAM-1 might contribute to early vascular insult and suppression of T cell function. Assessment of vascular adhesion molecules to predict sepsis or systemic infections has been recently extensively reviewed [32]. Results showed that sVCAM-1 levels correlated well with the severity of inflammation and diseases, but lacked specificity of certain infection induced endothelial damage. It remains unclear whether vascular insult or immunosuppression associated with overwhelming lung infection or co-infection is the cause of morbidity or mortality.",

Extensive leukocyte apoptosis has been implicated in Ebola virus infections [36]. It has been proposed that lymphopenia in SARS patients is related to cell apoptosis [9]. We did find that SARS patients appeared to have higher plasma FasL levels, associated with higher intracellular cleaved caspase-3 positive CD4 and CD8 lymphocytes in the acute phase of SARS. Although the FasL levels were not significantly correlated to lymphocyte counts in blood, this may be because T cell apoptosis usually requires a two-step mechanism [35]. Inhibition of cell apoptosis has recently been shown to improve survival of septic animals [37]. Taken together, this suggests that inhibition of lymphocyte apoptosis could prevent lymphopenia in SARS. Whether correction of lymphopenia would improve the outcome of SARS may never be known.",
