The emergence of a new infectious agent in the population, the new recognition of a previously undetected circulating agent, or the realization that a noncommunicable disease is actually caused by infection contribute to this group of microbial threats, unrelated to any possible intentional release of biologic agents or bioterrorism (1). As with the scope of the larger body of all infections and infectious diseases, the capacity of emerging infections to affect the cardiovascular system varies from none to limited or increased risk. However, this task force report will focus on the possible cardiovascular implications of emerging infectious diseases and infection with select agents designated to have potential for intentional release.",

With some, the direct clinical impact is limited to 1 organ system, as in the case of Clostridium botulinumtoxin-induced neuroparalytic illness (4). Other agents can affect multiple organ systems, as in the case of Coxiella burnetiiinfection, which affects both pulmonary and hepatic systems (5). Additional factors accentuate the complexity of bioterrorism-related illnesses. The temporal onset of different clinical manifestations following exposure can vary. For example, Q fever endocarditis is an illness of chronic infection; whereas pneumonia is seen acutely following exposure (5). However, naturally occurring infections with most of the designated bioterrorism agents are rarely seen in the U.S. today. Because of this, many clinicians are unfamiliar with the associated clinical syndromes and may not initially recognize when an illness stems from exposure to one of these agents, much less from intentional release in a bioterrorism attack (6).",

In such cases, echocardiography, particularly transesophageal echocardiography in adults, may be used to establish a diagnosis of endocarditis (8, 9). Similarly, serology (detection of antibodies to the infectious agent), immunohistochemistry, and testing for the presence of pathogen deoxyribonucleic acid, may be key to the diagnosis of blood and tissue culture-negative endocarditis (10).

Salmonellaendocarditis usually occurs in patients with pre-existing heart problems and often causes severe valvular destruction, with a case fatality rate of 70% (54). About one-fourth of Salmonellaendocarditic cases are nonvalvular (mural); and one-fourth of Salmonellaendocarditic patients have associated lumbar osteomyelitis; however, their survival rates have not been reported (54). Salmonellapericarditis often presents with cardiac or pulmonary symptoms, but typical signs of pericardial disease (pulsus paradoxus, friction rub) or characteristic electrocardiograph changes (low voltage, elevated ST-segments) are uncommon. Salmonellamay also infect the peripheral or visceral arteries, but the abdominal aorta is the most frequent site of vascular infection (55). Most of these patients are men over the age of 50 years with pre-existing atherosclerosis of the aorta who do not have a previous history of gastroenteritis and no survival with medical therapy alone has been reported. Salmonellaemay also cause rare cases of myocarditis, but the pathogenesis is unclear (56, 57).",

A summary description of the select Category A and B diseases and agents is presented in Table 2.2Be aware of signs and symptoms and the clinical diagnosis and management of the 4 major cardiovascular syndromes\u2014endocarditis, myocarditis, pericarditis, and vasculitis\u2014that certain potential bioterrorism agents might induce.3Consider the possibility of bioterrorism when one of the Category A agents is found to produce disease in a single patient in the absence of obvious risk factors. The likelihood of bioterrorism involvement increases significantly if more than 1 patient presents with illness from 1 of these agents.4Ensure that clinical laboratories save isolates from cases that may represent illness from biologic agents of bioterrorism and contact state health departments for guidance.5Obtain thorough family and environmental histories from patients to ascertain whether other close contacts have had similar illnesses.6Clinicians should be familiar with the public health reporting requirements in their locale. Contact infection control personnel and appropriate public health authorities if a patient is diagnosed with any of these agents or diseases.\n",
