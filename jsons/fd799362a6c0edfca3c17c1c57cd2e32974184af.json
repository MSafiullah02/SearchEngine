On the 21st February 2020, the total of cases identified by the health authorities in Lombardy was 34 (Lombardy Region, 2020) . This prompted the Government to declare the area of the outbreak \"red zone\", progressively limiting travel, social, cultural and economic activities of N50,000 people (DPCM, 2020a; IMH, 2020a) . Due to the rapid rise of infections, on the 23rd February 2020, a new ordinance from the authorities resulted in the closure of all schools and placed restrictions on social and economic activities throughout the Lombardy region (IMH, 2020b).

Country (CPD, 2020; Lombardy Region, 2020) , the Government adopted heavy containment measures in a large part of Northern Italy, including the whole Lombardy Region, declaring a partial lockdown (PL) and prohibiting all transfers if not necessary to reach the workplace or related to essential needs (DPCM, 2020b) . In Lombardy and Milan, some  businesses remained open with severe restrictions until March 11th  while industrial activities remained open until the 23rd March 2020 , when a total lockdown (TL) was imposed and only factories attributable to essential supply chains (e.g. food, pharmaceuticals, etc.) were authorized to remain operative (DPCM, 2020c (DPCM, , 2020d .",

January was not considered suitable for the identification of the reference period due to the high relative humidity, and low average temperatures (Table S3) , different conditions than PL and TL which would have led to an imbalance in the comparison of some polluting agent trends (e.g. PM 10 and SO 2 ) due to the massive use of heating systems (Barrington-Leigh et al., 2019; Pillarisetti et al., 2019) . As shown in Fig. 3 , in February temperature, relative humidity, wind, precipitation and average solar irradiance in the daylight hours were similar to those of March. Therefore, the CTRL period was chosen in the first part of February (from 7 to 20) next to the closing time of schools and universities and exhibiting comparable meteorological conditions with PL and TL (Table S4) . Furthermore, in the CTRL period an almost total absence of rainfall was reported, as in the PL and TL, thus preventing an overestimation of the air quality (Fig. 3) .",

Moreover, the effects of PL and TL were similar in all three MeCiMi sections. In the PL phase, the reduction of PM 10 was between 32.7% (SaA) and 40.5% (SaB). It was likely attributable to the significant reduction in vehicular traffic given by the transfers restrictions imposed by the Authorities considering that transports represent the main source of PM 10 in Milan and in the whole MeCiMi (40.7-45%) (Fig. S1 ). The TL period marked a further overall decrease in PM 10 of 13.1% -18.9% compared to the PL. This result can be partially attributed to the stop of industrial activities that allowed reducing direct emissions and, consequently, decrease workers' transfers. In both periods, the contribution given by the reduction of building heating cannot be neglected. Although the average temperature of CTRL period was comparable with that registered in the PL and TL (Table S4) , it should be considered that in the MeCiMi, as reported by Lombardy emissions inventory (Fig. S1 ), household heating counts for a 22.5-28.8% of the total PM 10 emitted. So even a slight reduction due to the closure of several offices might have influenced the overall value.",

Compared to an average concentration in the CTRL period of around 40 \u03bcg m \u22123 , both in Milan and in the hinterland PM 2.5 concentrations were almost halved in the TL phase (47.1-47.4%). As for PM 10 , these results can be attributed: (i) in the PL phase mainly to the reduction of vehicular traffic (primary PM 2.5 ) and (ii) in the TL phase also to the reduction of emissions from industrial activities. The low reduction from the PL to the TL period can also be caused to the relatively low contribution of the industrial sector in PM 2.5 emissions in Milan and in SaA (15.3% and 25.9%, respectively) (Fig. S1 ). The reduction of PM 2.5 in PL and TL can be also attributed to the simultaneous reduction in the concentration of other pollutants such as NH 3 (Fig. S2) , volatile organic compounds (e.g. benzene) (Section 3.4), and NO x (Section 3.6) which act as precursors to the formation of secondary PM 2.5 (Chen et al., 2017; Han et al., 2018) . As in the case of PM 10 , the influence of the reduction of other combustion processes due to domestic heating cannot be excluded as household heating in MeCiMi determines the 28-34.5% of the total PM 2.5 emission (Fig. S1 ).",

Compared to the CTRL period, the percentage reduction was 57.5% and 71%, in the PL and TL respectively (Fig. 4) . As the major source in Milan is represented by the traffic (as well as other minor BC combustion sources, including household heating and cooking are possible) (Fig. S1 ) (Invernizzi et al., 2011; Mousavi et al., 2019) , these results confirm the identification of the reduction of traffic in PL and TL as the main source of the reduction of PM 10 and PM 2.5 in the city of Milan.

The largest reduction was measured in the city of Milan (57.6%), followed by the SaA (49.1%) and SaB (32%) (Fig. 5) . Indeed, the main sources of CO emissions are incomplete combustion processes (e.g. traffic, household heating) (INEMAR, 2017) and in which differ for the various areas of MeCiMi (Fig. S1 ). While in Milan it is possible to estimate that during the reference period the traffic contributes 78.8% to the emission of CO, in SaA and SaB this percentage drops to 74.6% and 55.5%, respectively. These aspects confirm the greater impact in terms of CO reduction of the reduction of vehicular traffic and transport in the city of Milan than in the other two adjacent areas. The further reduction of CO in the transition from PL to TL is not attributable only to the closure of the industries. In fact, this sector has a minimal percentage impact on CO emissions in MeCiMi (1.4-3.5%) (Fig. S1) . Instead, it is reasonable to attribute this result to a combination of causes: (i) further decrease in vehicular traffic and (ii) a reduction in the use of household heating due to the closure of many workplaces for the TL.",

The emissions of power plants, heating systems, and some industrial processes represent the main sources of SO 2 (INEMAR, 2017).

In Milan, heating systems mainly contribute (51.6%) while in SaA and SaB industries (85.1% and 53.4%, respectively) (Fig. S1 ). The trend of reduction form CTRL to TL in Milan can be partially attributed to a reduction of heating due to the closure of workplaces (e.g. offices) which, instead, had lower influence in the other two areas.

            "text": "Compared to the CTRL period, O 3 exhibited a more marked increase in Milan and SaA and lower in SaB despite the significant decrease in NO 2 (Fig. 6) . The growth of O 3 is usual during spring and summer owing to higher solar radiation (in terms of intensity and daily duration), which promotes the photolysis of NO 2 (Escudero et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2020) . Fig. 7 shows the dependence of the concentration of O 3 in CTRL, PL and TL on solar radiation and daylight hours. The increase in daylight hours (from 9.5 \u00b1 0.2 h in the CTRL period to 12 \u00b1 0.2 h in the TL period) might appear a crucial factor causing higher O 3 concentrations. However, this aspect is not sufficient to explain the data. In fact, in MeCiMi, from 2016 to 2018 the average concentration of O 3 in February and March was 10-20 \u03bcg m \u22123 and 30-40 \u03bcg m \u22123 , respectively. These values are similar with those recorded in the reference period (20.1 \u00b1 2.1 \u03bcg m \u22123 ) and in PL (43.7 \u00b1 2.4 \u03bcg m \u22123 ) but very lower than TL (59.0 \u00b1 2.1 \u03bcg m \u22123 ). The significant lowering of the NO concentration in TL, which, in turns, reacts with O 3 , could lead to obtain the higher O 3 concentrations than the average. Furthermore, in TL, the presence of benzene in major average concentrations in Milan than in SaB (Fig. 5 ) surely yielded to a greater O 3 formation. Since VOCs emissions are mainly ascribable to vehicular traffic and industrial combustion (EEA, 2019; Huang et al., 2011; Man et al., 2020) , strongly minimized in TL, it might be concluded that also the other VOCs acted as benzene.",

The severe limitation of people movements following the PL and the subsequent TL resulted in a significant reduction of pollutants concentration mainly due to vehicular traffic: PM 10 , PM 2.5 , BC, benzene, CO, and NO x . For CO, the reduction was specifically appreciable in the city of Milan where vehicular traffic represents the primary source of these emissions in a marked manner. The lockdown led to an appreciable drop in SO 2 only in the city of Milan while it remained unchanged in the SaA and SaB. This specific reduction in Milan can be partially attributed to the decrease of heating, due to the closure of workplaces, factor playing a minor role in the other two areas. However, further data are required in order to carry out a more accurate evaluation. Despite the significant decrease in NO 2 in TL, ozone exhibited a significant increase, probably, due to the minor NO concentration. The more accentuated increase in Milan and SaA was, probably, due to the higher average concentrations of benzene in Milan than the adjacent areas that may have promoted the formation of O 3 in a more significant way.",
