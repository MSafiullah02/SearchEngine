Early published data showed 25.9% of SARS-CoV-2 related pneumonia required ICU admission and 20.1% developed acute respiratory syndrome [2].",

Surging of cases and unpreparedness of health systems, physicians outside specialties that normally treat Covid-19 patients (intensive care, infectious disease, emergency medicine e.g.), physicians from other specialties need to take part in the diagnosis and treatment of patients. Maria Nicola et. al had written a comprehensive up-to-date evidence-based review of current practice to implement in this pandemic [3]. Although descriptive statistics may change from region to region, this compact review may serve as a general guideline for all disciplines.",

There is one issue we want to add to this well-written review, which is passive immunization using convalescent plasma from recovered patients. Although a meta-analysis conducted for the effectiveness of convalescent plasma and hyperimmune immunoglobulin for previous coronavirus related severe acute respiratory syndromes concluded this therapy reduces mortality, this advice was based on low-quality, uncontrolled studies [4]. With a growing number of recovered Covid-19 patients, they can be a valuable resource for this purpose but randomized controlled trials are needed to reach a conclusion.",
