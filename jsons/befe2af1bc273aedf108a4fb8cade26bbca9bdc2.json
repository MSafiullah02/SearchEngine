This group of drug reactions includes anaphylaxis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), and, depending on the systemic involvement, erythroderma. In this chapter we approach the characteristics and treatment of some adverse reactions to drugs, including anaphylaxis, erythroderma, SJS, and TEN. The prevalence of SCARDs is estimated at 1 in 1,000 hospitalized patients. SJS and TEN are particularly severe [4] . In general, fatal cutaneous drug-induced reactions occur in 0.1% of clinical patients and 0.01% of surgery patients [1] .",

The authors excluded specific forms from the study, such as SJS, TEN, fixed drug eruption (FDE), AGEP, phototoxicity, and vasculitis. This suggests that in cases of drug-induced reactions with extensive cutaneous affection, with or without lymphadenopathy, a laboratory investigation is required with a complete hemogram and hepatic function test.",

Blister formations are possible, though usually not determined by an epidermal detachment of over 10% of the body surface [4, 14, 19] . Mucous involvement occurs in roughly 90% of cases, generally on two distinct mucous surfaces; this may precede or follow cutaneous involvement [4, 14, 19] . Onset begins with enanthema and edema, which give rise to erosions and pseudomembranous formations on the eyes, mouth, genitals, pharynx, and upper airways [19] .

It was administered over a period of 1-5 days, in doses varying from 0.65 to 5.8 g/kg (mean total dose of 2.7 g/kg). An objective positive response to treatment occurred with a break in the progression of TEN, observed in 43 (90%) of the 48 patients. In all there were six deaths. The authors concluded that early use of intravenous gammaglobulin is safe, with a recommended dose of 1 g/kg daily for 3 days in a row. In contrast to the studies of Prins et al.

However, newer anticonvulsant medications also containing aromatic structure (felbamate, oxcarbazepine, zonisamide, and lamotrigine) can also be involved, and the cross-reactivity between the various aromatic anticonvulsant drugs is well documented, varying between 40% and 80%.

In addition, ethnic predisposition to certain HLA types may contribute to the formation of neoantigens from the combination of these intermediary reactive metabolites with tissue macromolecules and formation of haptens (5a), which can be presented via the human histocompatibility complex class I (HLA-DR) or class II (HLA-A, -B or -C), to CD4 or CD8 T cells (6) . It was demonstrated that carbamazepine, valproic acid, and amoxicillin are able to exert immunomodulatory actions by inhibiting histone decarboxylase on B lymphocytes, producing a hypogammaglobulinemia that precedes the clinical onset of DRESS/DIHS. The clonal expansion of T cells requires sequential reactivation of latent herpesvirus, and at the same time CD8 + CLA + T cells are produced, which are directed toward skin, CD8 + CCR4 + T cells addressed to the lungs (7b), and CD4 + IL-4, IL-5 producer and IL-17 CD4 Th17 + producer that cause tissue and peripheral eosinophilia",

This could explain why different herpesviruses are activated and because in another intense immune process, so-called GVHD, a similar reactivation can be observed. (ii) The viral reactivation can occur but is initially clinically unapparent. However, T cells stimulated by virus present significant crossreactivity with certain drugs, and exposure to these drugs leads to an expansion of T cells specific to the drug (and viruses), which persists even after drug withdrawal due to persistence of viral antigens. The simultaneous appearance of multiple concurrent viral reactivation could be explained by the ability of HHV-6 and HHV-7 counterparts to reactivate virus. Thus, if the symptoms of DRESS/ DIHS are mediated by both the various gene products and herpesvirus immune responses to viral replication, the frequent deterioration or the several exacerbations that occur despite withdrawal of the offending drug could derive, at least in part, from the sequential activation of this herpesvirus.",

[48, 49] Exanthematous or maculopapular drug eruptions, sometimes inappropriately designated \"drug rashes\" or \"drug eruptions\" by some generalists, are the most common ADRs in the skin. The eruption usually occurs between 4 and 14 days after the initiation of a new medication or chemical substance, although it can develop sooner, Exanthematous eruptions generally are composed of erythematous macules and/or papules and more rarely by vesicles or pustules, usually with a pattern of symmetric distribution on skin. The eruption often begins on the trunk followed by centrifugal dissemination to the proximal limbs. Skin lesions progressively become confluent and may cover large areas of the body (Fig. 26.20 ). Pruritus and/or low-grade fever are often associated with the exanthema. In some patients the exanthema may progress to erythroderma or more severe reactions such as SJS/TEN or DRESS syndrome after some days or weeks.",

Usually there is only one causative drug (monosensitivity), although sometimes several drugs can induce FDEs in the same patient (multisensitivity). The most common multisensitivity is the cross-reaction between chemically related drugs such as tetracyclines.

The weakening of the hair shaft in this context predisposes the hair to breakage and shedding during the act of combing. They involve the hair, eyebrows, beard, axillary hair, and pubic hair.

Even though hair loss is intense, about 10% of the pilous follicles are usually in a resting phase at the time of the administration of the drug, and this determines incomplete hair loss. With repeated treatment cycles, alopecia totalis may occur. This type of effluvium is generally reversible when treatment is suspended, and occasionally permanent with the use of cyclophosphamide and busulfan. Hair grows around 1 cm per month, possibly showing new texture and color. The chemotherapeutic drugs more often associated with alopecia when used in isolation are: (i) complete alopecia (cyclophosphamide at high dose, doxorubicin, docetaxel, dactinomycin, irinotecan, topotecan, bleomycin, paclitaxel); (ii) incomplete alopecia (etoposide, ifosfamide, mitomycin C, 5-fluorouracil, melphalan, mitoxantrone, gemcitabine, vinca alkaloids).",

About 40% of the patients being treated show some type of oral complication. These complications are often associated with drugs that affect the synthesis of DNA. The main causative agents are antimetabolic drugs and antitumoral antibiotics. The drugs more frequently associated with stomatitis are bleomycin, dactinomycin, methotrexate, topotecan, and 5-fluorouracil. Unusually, the stomatitis caused by 5-fluorouracil is related to its continuous infusional administration or to the use of its oral prodrug, capecitabine, and is less frequently observed when 5-fluorouracil is administrated in bolus. The main mechanism is the direct toxicity of the drug, but it can result secondarily from the indirect effects of the drug on the bone marrow. In patients with head and neck tumors, cisplatin used during radiotherapy acts as a strong radiosensitizer. In these cases there is more tumoral control but also greater severity of stomatitis caused by a boost in the direct effect of radiotherapy.",

Anaphylaxis An immediate systemic reaction that occurs when a previously sensitized individual is re-exposed to an allergen. It is caused by rapid IgE-mediated immune release of vasoactive mediators from tissue mast cells and blood basophils with a potential late component. This is a systemic severe ADR affecting skin, mucous membranes, gastrointestinal tract, respiratory tract, and cardiovascular system. Drug allergy An immunologically mediated response to a pharmaceutical and/or formulation (excipient) agent in a previous sensitized patient. Drug idiosyncrasy An abnormal and unexpected effect that is unrelated to the intended pharmacologic action of a drug and has an unknown mechanism. It is not mediated by a humoral or cellular immune response but is reproducible on readministration. It may be due to underlying abnormalities of metabolism, excretion, or bioavailability. Drug intolerance An undesirable pharmacologic effect that may occur at low or conventional doses of the drug without underlying abnormalities of metabolism, excretion, or bioavailability of the drug. Humoral or cellular immune mechanisms are not thought to be involved, and a definitive mechanism for such exaggerated responses has not been established (e.g., acetylsalicylic acid-induced tinnitus at low doses).",
