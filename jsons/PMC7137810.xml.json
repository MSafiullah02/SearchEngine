In Brazil, the first case of COVID-19 was confirmed on February 26, 2020 and until March 20, 2020 at least 970 cases and seven deaths have been reported. The fear and uncertainty have led people to consume and share mistrust and misinformation on the Internet. Since the first confirmed case in Brazil, fake news about the effectiveness of an ether and chloroform blend known as \u201clan\u00e7a perfume\u201d or \u201clol\u00f3\u201d were spread on social media.",

Google Trends may act as an efficient real time surveillance system by monitoring hit searches of specific health issues leading to reliable and meaningful indicators to track health information demand and supply trends (1). We used Google Trends to assess recent search activity (from February 25 to March 20, 2020) on the novel coronavirus in Brazil and the popularity of related search terms. Related searches for coronavirus revealed a high level of interest (a breakout over 5000%) on the information about the use of an ether and chloroform blend in treating COVID-19, especially in the North and Northeast regions which are recognized as the poorest regions in the country.",

Unfortunately, fake news and misinformation on social media can lead people to make harmful health decisions. It is important to check health information related to COVID-19 from reliable news sources and expert guidance from health authorities and international health organizations, rather than from shared stories in social media. Journalists and health-care professionals should cooperate with an effective communication to enhance healthy attitudes towards the pandemic (2).",

Furthermore, there is no evidence supporting claims that ether and chloroform inhalation is useful in the treatment of COVID-19.
