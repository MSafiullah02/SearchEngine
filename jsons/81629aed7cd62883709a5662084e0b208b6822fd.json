This dichotomy necessitates different perspectives on the aetiology, pathogenesis and management in the two groups. 3 Among non-Indigenous children, the general improvement in socioeconomic conditions and the advent of routine antibiotic therapy for otitis media have led to a decrease in the more serious extracranial and intracranial complications that were seen in the pre-antibiotic era. 4 Despite a recrudescence in the incidence of otitis media in the past three decades, related to the increasing use of daycare centres for infants and children, there has been a general tendency in the past 10 years to reduce immediate antibiotic treatment for AOM for children aged over 2 years, exercising a \"wait and see\" policy. 5,6 Among children aged under 2 years, antibiotic therapy results in more rapid resolution of clinical signs (bulging, erythematous tympanic membrane) and",

This results in educational problems, social isolation, truancy and ultimately early school-leaving and difficulties gaining employment. Although hearing aids and school sound field systems (where an infrared signal transmits the teacher's amplified voice through loudspeakers) are theoretically suitable approaches to this problem, in reality, they are of limited help to infants and young children with draining ears. Indigenous children suffer a mean of 32 months of hearing loss in childhood, compared with 3 months among non-Indigenous children. Among Indigenous children, symptoms of otitis media include otalgia, ear rubbing, fever, excessive crying, restless sleep and poor appetite. Traditionally, management regimens have tended to centre on symptoms and symptom relief. This is compounded by the poor access to health care and socioeconomic standards experienced by many Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander populations, and consequently poses a significant impact and burden of disease, not just for this population but for the Australian population in general.",

Although much of this will be covered in other articles in this supplement, in brief, early invasion of the nasopharynx by encapsulated bacteria overwhelms the immature immune system, leading to a failure to elicit an adequate antibody response. Nasopharyngeal carriage, sustained by biofilm formation and intracellular bacterial colonisation, leads to chronic adenoiditis, rhinitis and middle ear infection via the eustachian tube. [14] [15] [16] Social conditions, such as poverty, overcrowding, poor nutrition, exposure to cigarette smoke and lack of running water, all have a role to play in perpetuating the milieu conducive to ongoing carriage of pathogenic bacteria throughout the upper respiratory tract. 17 These socioeconomic issues must be addressed, but innovative preventive treatments to diminish bacterial carriage also need to be implemented.",

Among Indigenous children, infection occurs as early as 2 months of age. 21 \u2022 Otitis media, in particular middle ear effusion, has a higher incidence among boys; reasons for this are unknown. 1 \u2022 In Australia, Indigenous status significantly increases the risk of middle ear disease in urban, rural and remote locations. This is also the case for other ethnic groups, including Inuit, Native American and Maori children. 22 \u2022 Individual factors such as age, sex and ethnicity may be secondary to eustachian tube size differences. 23 \u2022 Premature birth has been variously reported as either having no effect or increasing the risk of otitis media. 24 \u2022 The influence of allergy as a risk factor for otitis media is contentious. An association is noted, with supportive epidemiological and therapeutic evidence in some studies, whereas other studies show no association. 25, 26 \u2022 Immune deficiencies associated with RAOM may include deficiencies in secretory IgA, which is implicated in bacterial and viral adherence and has been shown to reduce bacterial colonisation of the nasopharynx. RAOM that is non-responsive to conventional medical and surgical therapy may reveal low serum IgG2 levels, poor response to Haemophilus influenzae polysaccharide-protein conjugate vaccination and low levels of specific IgG antibodies against pneumococcal capsular polysaccharides 6A and 19F. 27 \u2022 Genetic factors may play a part in susceptibility to otitis media. A Norwegian study of 2750 twin pairs concluded that heritability of otitis media susceptibility was 74% among girls and 45% among boys. 28 The HLA-A2 gene has been noted to be associated with RAOM but not OME. 29 \u2022 OME is over-represented among children with Down syndrome and unrepaired cleft palate and craniofacial disorders. The high incidence of disease is related to the dysfunction of the eustachian tube together with lack of functional resistance to aspiration of nasopharyngeal content. 30 \u2022 The current weight of expert opinion is that the presence of infected adenoids or tissue, with biofilm and intracellular bacteria identified in the tissue, is a greater contributor to AOM and OME than the physical bulk or size of the adenoids. A large Western Australian study of 50 000 children who underwent ventilation tube insertion showed a 50% reduction in subsequent grommet insertion following adenoidectomy. 31 \u2022 Despite studies showing pepsinogen carried by gastro-oesophageal reflux into the middle ear fluid in OME and grommet otorrhoea, further definitive studies are required. 32, 33 O TIT IS ME DIA 2 00 9 : AN UPDATE",

There is a threefold increased risk of upper respiratory tract infection with daycare attendance. 34 The same factors hold for overcrowding in homes and families with a number of older siblings. 26 Upper respiratory tract infections occur most frequently in the winter months, and respiratory viruses can be isolated from the middle ear fluid in 19% of children with AOM; these may include respiratory syncytial virus, rhinovirus, adenovirus and coronavirus. 35 Passive cigarette smoking increases the risk of otitis media among Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal children. In the Kalgoorlie Otitis Media Research Project, 64% of Aboriginal children and 40% of non-Aboriginal children were exposed to environmental tobacco smoke. 17 A meta-analysis demonstrated a significant increase in risk (66%) of RAOM and chronic OME in the presence of parental smoking (risk ratio [RR], 1.66; 95% CI, 1.33-2.06). 20 Breastfeeding has a protective effect on the development of middle ear disease related to the immunological properties of breast milk; a meta-analysis showed that breastfeeding for at least 3 months reduced the risk of AOM by 13% (RR, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.79-0.95). 20 Low socioeconomic status with limited access to health care may be a factor affecting the association with otitis media. There is great variability, however, in the association between otitis media and low socioeconomic status.",
