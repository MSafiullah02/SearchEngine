Although some case-reports or observational studies have reported a few antiviral drugs being effective in improving the outcome of COVID-19 patients (8), no definitive cure has been discovered so far. Recently, a Chinese research team proposed a treatment protocol for management of COVID-19 patients, which included moxifloxacin, levofloxacin (consider tolerance) and arbidol administration (8). However, the underlying evidence for the mentioned treatment protocol is unclear, as there are no clinical trials performed on this matter. Several antiviral therapies have been considered to be potentially effective in treating COVID-19, including oseltamivir, ganciclovir, arbidol and lopinavir / ritonavir. Many clinical trials are currently underway to evaluate the efficacy of different medications on the outcome of COVID-19 patients (9), but their results have not been published yet. On the other hand, the quality of these studies is rather unclear.",

The most commonly used antivirals were lopinavir / ritonavir, oseltamivir, ribavirin and arbidol, respectively. Route and duration of administration were not reported in most of the studies. The most common route of administration among the studies was oral administration, and the duration of administration varied from two to 14 days. All of the studies used other therapies, such as antibiotics, immunoglobin, interferon, glucocorticoids, methylprednisolone, and antiparasitic and antifungal drugs in addition to the antiviral therapy to manage COVID-19 patients (Table 2).",

In addition to lopinavir-ritonavir (400 mg / 100 mg, twice daily; 14 days), standard treatments such as antibiotics, invasive or non-invasive ventilation and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) and vasopressor were also used. The findings of this study showed that patients receiving lopinavir-ritonavir had a similar recovery process to those receiving standard treatment. 28-day mortality and viral RNA load were not significantly different between the two groups (10).

For instance, Chen et al. reported no deaths among nine patients treated with Lopinavir/Ritonavir. However, the sample size of the mentioned article was quite small (12). According to the existing statistics, the mortality rate of COVID-19 among patients aged 10 to 60 years, varies between 0.2% and 1.3% (3). Hence, for every 100 patients in this age group, only one patient dies. Therefore, the sample size was probably not large enough to observe at least one death. In another study, Hu et al. studied 24 asymptomatic patients and reported no mortality or ICU admission, and no serious complication in 21 patients treated with antiviral agents. Nonetheless, in addition to the small sample size, since the patients were asymptomatic, the severity of COVID-19 was rather mild in them. Therefore, the recovery of the patients might have been due to their mild disease, rather than the efficacy of the antiviral drugs used (15). ",

In other words, oseltamivir administration was ineffective in decreasing ICU admission rate, the need for ventilator and death rate among the patients (13).

Surprisingly, no completed clinical trial on SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV was found, and all of the proposals were based on simulation studies, in vitro studies, pre-clinical studies or at best, observational studies and case-series (33-38). After an epidemic has subsided, researchers are reluctant to perform further investigations on the matter, which is a major pitfall in research and can have several reasons. The first and most important reason is the decline in the number of patients, which severely limits the possibility of performing a clinical trial. Secondly, the previous two epidemics, namely SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, never became a pandemic, and the majority of the cases were in a limited geographic region. Therefore, after the suppression of the epidemics and decline in the number of patients, the two diseases were eliminated from the list of priorities of international organizations. If those international organizations, such as the World Health Organization, had further insisted on the importance of the subject and provided grants for independent researches, maybe a few effective antiviral agents for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV would have existed, which could be helpful in management of COVID-19, decreasing its burden on societies. A lesson should be learned from the COVID-19 pandemic and negligence of health policy makers in setting up clinical trials during SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV epidemics, so that in the current pandemic and future epidemics, researches and well-designed clinical trials are planned-out while the disease is at its peak, the findings of which can be used when necessary.",
