First, ACE2 was identified as being the receptor to the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, via the Spike protein. Inhibition of ACE2-coronavirus binding effectively inhibited virus replication and limited RAS-dependent acute lung injury.85 Then, experimental models of ARDS modulating Ang (1\u20137) and ACE2 activities have demonstrated significant lung protection (Fig. 4\n).74, 86, 87 Ang (1\u20137) infusion in murine experimental ARDS decreased the proinflammatory response, improved lung injury scores and lung function, and decreased cellular infiltrate in piglets with acid aspiration.74, 82 These beneficial effects are mediated by downregulation of the intracellular proinflammatory NF\u03baB cascade and increased NO synthesis.51 A randomized controlled trial of recombinant human ACE2 in humans with ARDS showed it decreased Ang II levels and proinflammatory mediators, and augmented plasmatic surfactant protein D, with no hemodynamic side effects.3, 88 The effects of recombinant human ACE2 (rhACE2) may be principally mediated by its competing effects with ACE in limiting the generation of Ang II, while potentiating Ang (1\u20137) activity. Those findings demonstrate that ACE2-related immunomodulation in the context of ARDS may improve pulmonary outcomes, in congruence with what we know of the downregulating effect of nonclassic RAS on the inflammatory response. Larger randomized controlled trails are necessary to confirm the promising lung protective properties of rhACE2.",

On the one hand, increased Ang II activity is a life-saving response to hypotension and infection, with proven effects on cardiovascular physiology and renal outcomes in the context of vasoplegic shock.2 It also implies that Ang II enhancement of hemodynamic management at the acute phase of septic shock may improve organ failure, including renal failure. Also, Ang II in the acute context may boost the proinflammatory response, with subsequent enhanced bacterial clearance, opposite to the deleterious effects of inflammation in the chronic setting. On the other hand, ACE2 enhancement decreases lung inflammation and improves lung hemodynamics and function in the setting of ARDS.3 The control of pulmonary damage by the nonclassic RAS demonstrates the central role of immunomodulation in this potentially lethal inflammation-mediated disease. Those 2 pivotal trials convey highly encouraging changes in the treatment strategies of septic shock and ARDS. Yet, their individualization at the bedside is far from being achieved, as both targeted conditions may be simultaneously present in a given individual (Fig. 5\n).
