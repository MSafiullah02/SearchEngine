In addition, four new compounds were introduced as promising binders to ZIKV polymerase active site based on the calculated binding affinities. On the other hand, the arm movement that occurred after 200 ns did not affect the binding of all of the small molecules. Future work is suggested to test the arm movement effect on the viral RNA upon polymerase binding.",
