The patient had a five-day business trip in Wuhan (from January 22, 2020, to January 27, 2020). Fever initially occurred on January 28, 2020, with a body temperature of 38.5\u00b0C, with dry cough and muscle ache. On January 30, 2020, the patient went to Xiangyang First People\u2019s Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) for consultation in the respiratory department, and the laboratory test reported that the influenza A virus serology was negative. The results of blood routine examination were normal [white blood cell count (WBC): 5.1\u00d7109/l; neutrophil percentage (neu%): 69.2%; lymphocyte percentage (lym%): 25.6%; lymphocyte absolute value (lym): 1.28\u00d7109/l; C-reactive protein (CRP): 6.1 mg/l] and she was given Tamiflu (75 mg/time, twice per day) orally and was rehydrated. Three days later (on February 2, 2020), the patient still had dry cough, so she went to hospital (TCM) again. It was noted that before the onset of the disease, the patient went to Wuhan on a business trip and a novel coronavirus nucleic acid test was performed and it was negative. At admission, chest X-ray showed increased and thickened right lower lung markings, which suggested bronchitis and possible interstitial pneumonia according to her positive family history of interstitial pneumonia (Figure 1). Levofloxacin was given drip once for intravenous treatment, and Tamiflu was continued to be taken orally. On February 04, 2020, the patient's symptoms were still not improved, and her body temperature continued to rise to 39.2\u00b0C. She was referred to our fever clinic for further evaluation, and a chest computed tomography (CT) was performed. Chest CT showed bilateral multifocal ground glass opacities with consolidation which suggested viral pneumonia as a differential diagnosis (Figure 2a, 2b), and the subsequent 2019-nCoV pneumonia nucleic acid test was positive.",

Five days after the initiation of the treatment (February 10, 2020), the patient has recovered completely, the nucleic acid retest was negative, and chest CT findings resolved (Figure 2c).

According to the epidemiological investigation of these patients, it has been confirmed that the virus has the characteristics of human-to-human transmission and strong infectivity. The transmission through respiratory droplets is the main route of transmission, and it can also be transmitted by close touch. The incubation period is generally three to seven days, and the longest period is not more than 14 days. However, there were two patients who had a 20-day incubation period, but the odds were rare and minimal. People who are generally susceptible are the elderly with existing comorbidities, and additionally children and infants can also be infected (1).",

In some patients, the onset symptoms are mild, and no fever was present. Most patients have a good prognosis, and a few patients are critically ill or die, most of whom are elderly people having comorbidities. In the laboratory examination, in the early stage of the disease, the total number of peripheral blood leukocytes is increased or decreased, and the lymphocyte count is decreased. Some patients may have increased liver enzyme, muscle enzyme, and CRP.

At the beginning, the symptoms of the patients were mild, the total number of leukocytes and neutrophils were increased, and the antiallergic and anti-inflammatory treatments had a certain effect (1,2). Bronchopneumonia is more common in infants and elderly patients with weak bodies. Its clinical manifestations are more severe, including high fever, cough, expectoration, dyspnea, cyanosis, and chest pain. On the images, the lung texture is increased and thickened, and multiple patchy dense shadows were found in the middle and lower lung fields of both lungs, with uneven density and fuzzy margin. Dense lesions could be fused into flakes, and nodules of different sizes could be seen (3). The main manifestations of interstitial pneumonia are thickening and blurring of lung texture and interweaving into a network, accompanied by ground glass shadow, inflammatory infiltration around the hilum, increased density of hilum and a vague outline and unclear structure. In our patient who had pneumonia associated with 2019-nCoV infection, ground glass opacities suggesting inflammation of lung parenchyma was the main imaging feature, and the lesions were mainly located in the peripheral zones of both lungs. There was no abnormality in the lung hilum, but interstitial changes could occur in the later stage (4,5). Recently, chest CT has been documented to be more sensitive in detection of 2019-nCoV infection in a series of 1014 cases (6).",
