            "text": "Coronaviruses are a group of enveloped, positive-strand single stranded RNA viruses with a corona-like morphology. These viruses have genome sizes ranging from 28 to 32 kb, which makes them the biggest among the RNA viruses (1). The genomes contain five major open reading frames (Orfs) that encode the replicase polyproteins (Orf 1a and Orf 1ab), spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N) proteins, in that order. Based on antigenic and genetic analyses, coronaviruses can be subdivided into three groups. Coronaviruses from groups 1 and 2 have been found to infect mammals. By contrast, avian species are known to be the natural hosts for group 3 viruses. Most coronaviruses are pathogenic to their hosts (2,3). Animal coronaviruses are known to cause respiratory, gastrointestinal, neurological, and hepatic diseases. By contrast, with the exception of SARS coronavirus, in the case of healthy individuals all previously known human coronaviruses were generally only associated with mild respiratory and gastrointestinal diseases.",

            "text": "The discovery of a novel coronavirus as the cause of SARS led to a resurgence in interest in these viruses and to the discovery of other novel coronaviruses in humans, namely NL-63 and HKU-1 (4\u20136). The recognition of SARS-like coronaviruses in palm civets and other small mammals in live-game animal markets (7) prompted intensive surveillance for coronaviruses in wild animals. Following upon this interesting discovery, several novel coronaviruses were identified in the mammalian and avian species (6,8\u201317). In particular, our initial studies first revealed that bats are important reservoirs for coronaviruses. By screening respiratory and fecal samples collected from a wide range of animals, we identified the first coronavirus in bats (14). Subsequent studies by ourselves and others also indicated that there are number of group 1 and group 2 viruses circulating in bat species (11,12,15,17). In particular, a SARS-like coronavirus was found in two of these studies independently (11,12). These results suggest that bats might play a key role in the evolution of coronaviruses. Here we describe the procedures that were used in our virus surveillance studies.",

Insert a comb into the tray.Allow the gel to solidify at room temperature.Remove the comb from the tray.Place the tray in the electrophoresis chamber with the wells on the cathode side.Fill the buffer chamber with 1X TAE buffer at a level that can cover the top of the gel.Mix 0.5 \u03bcl of the DNA markers with 1 \u03bcl of 6X gel loading dye and 4.5 \u03bcl of water on a parafilm sheet by repeated pipetting.Mix 5 \u03bcl of the PCR products with 1 \u03bcl of 6X gel loading dye on a parafilm sheet by pipetting up and down several times.Apply the mixture to the corresponding well of the gel.Close the lid of the electrophoresis apparatus and connect the electrical leads, anode to anode (red to red) and cathode to cathode (black to black).Run the gel at 100 V for 30 min.Turn off the power, remove the cover, and retrieve the gel.Soak the gel in 1X TAE with 0.5 \u03bcg/ml ethidium bromide for 15 min. Wash the gel with water (see\nNote 3).Place the gel on top of the transilluminator. Switch on the power of the gel documentation machine (see\nNote 11).Adjust the position of the gel and record the results. The size of the expected product for coronaviruses is 440 bp (Fig.\n2).\n\n",

The precipitates can be dissolved in the buffer by heating the bottle in a water bath. Cool the buffer to room temperature before use.Ethidium bromide is a known mutagen and may be carcinogenic. Handle solutions of ethidium bromide with gloves.For reasons of safety, staffs who are required to handle animals should have the appropriate inoculations (e.g., rabies vaccine for handling bats). Appropriate protective equipment should be worn when handling animals.Bats are protected species in Hong Kong, and a permit from the relevant governmental office is required to perform the work.For some small bat species, the finest swabs used in our studies are still too big to fit into the anal opening. In this situation, we use fecal instead of anal samples. To minimize possible contamination, these bats are kept individually in clean cotton bags for a few minutes. Fecal pellets collected in the cotton bags are sampled for further analysis.In our study, we also tried to isolate viruses from our samples. As some viruses might be sensitive to repeat freeze and thaw cycles, we normally aliquot the original samples into two separate tubes. One tube is kept at \u201380\u00b0C for long-term storage and the other is kept at 4\u00b0C until it is ready for RNA extraction and virus isolation.Contents in fecal samples and calcium alginate in swabs are known to inhibit RT-PCR assays. One should validate the protocols and test the reagents with specimens spiked with positive samples in advance. RNA purified from our recommended RNA extraction kit work well for us.General procedures to prevent PCR cross-contamination should be strictly followed. Aerosol-resistant filtered pipette tips could minimize possible carryover of amplicons. Separate pipettes and areas are used for sample processing, PCR, and post-PCR analysis. It is essential to include multiple positive and negative controls in the PCR reactions when a large number of samples are tested at the same time.Agarose solutions can be superheated in a microwave oven. Do not handle the bottle immediately after microwaving. Always wear heat-resistant gloves when handling melted agarose.UV light can cause severe skin and eye damage. Wear safety glasses and close the photography hood before turning on the UV transilluminator.Purified PCR products from Section 3.7 can be directly subjected to DNA sequencing. As quiescent species were found in our studied bat samples, we observed several single nucleotide polymorphisms in the products. To obtain more accurate sequencing data for our phylogenetic analysis, PCR products from these reactions were cloned into vectors (Section 3.8) and several clones from the same PCR reaction were randomly selected for further analysis.On some occasions, nonspecific PCR products might be observed (lane 8, Fig.\n1) and the desired PCR products have to be recovered by direct excisions from the agarose gel. As UV can damage DNA, it is important to use low-energy UV light to visualize and locate the desired product in this scenario. Try to excise the product as quickly as possible. We normally purify the excised products using a QIAquick gel extraction kit (Qiagen). The purified products can be subjected to cloning or sequencing as noted.The products should be sequenced in both directions.Deduced sequences are normally analyzed on both DNA and amino acid levels. Common sequence databases, such as Genbank (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Genbank/) can be used for the analysis. Common analytic freeware such as BioEdit (http://www.mbio.ncsu.edu/BioEdit/bioedit.html) and MEGA (http://www.megasoftware.net/) are commonly used analytical programs and are available on the Internet.\n",
