The rescue mission under disaster environment is very complicated and dangerous for a rescue team. Search and rescue (SAR) robots can not only improve the efficiency of rescue operations but also reduce the casualty of rescuers. Robots can help rescue teams and even replace rescuers to perform dangerous missions. Search and rescue robots will play a more and more important role in the rescue operations. A survey of the research status of search and rescue robots in Japan, USA, China and other countries has been provided. According to current research, experiences and the lessons learned from applications, the five key performances of a search and rescue robot are survivability, mobility, sensing, communicability and operability. Multi-technique fusion and multi-agent intelligent network are considered to be requirements for the future development of the search and rescue robot. Disaster prevention, disaster reduction and disaster rescue are the important parts of national public safety. They are also crucial for the safety of citizens and their estates. Search and rescue robotic technique is an urgent needed, strategic and core technique for national development. It will be important and strategic for national economy and safety.",

They have attracted extensive concern. Although people have improved their alert and response capabilities to various disasters, there are still fewer adequate prepa rations for devastating disasters. Many people still died because of unprofessional and time pressure rescue operations [1] [2] . A new field and challenge in robotic research is how to effectively fuse the multidisciplinary knowledge such as robotic technology, rescue technology and disaster science, hence develop intelligent robots for the search and rescue operations.",

            "text": "According to the time when a disaster occurs, a disaster rescue operation can be divided into three stages: the predisaster rescue operation, the on-disaster rescue and the postdisaster rescue operation. The pre-disaster rescue operation mainly aims at the disasters known in advance. The rescue operation includes disaster prevention and elimination of catastrophes, evacuation and transfer of materials. The ondisaster rescue operation aims at time-consumed disasters such as fire, flood, gas and radioactive substances. It mainly includes fighting against disasters. The post-disaster rescue refers to taking the search and rescue operation afterwards short-time disasters such as an earthquake and sudden explosions. There is no clear boundary among the above three stages. However, the rescue operation in all stages has two problems: the complexity of the environment and unpredictable dangers. Taking an urban environment as an example, the population of cities and the urban population density have quickly increased, which leads to that high-rise buildings, underground projects, large business establishments and cultural/entertainment facilities have been rapidly built. All these make the rescue operation too complicated to be dealt with. In some extremely dangerous catastrophes including the fire in an explosion, the flammable, explosive and toxic gases and the easily second-collapse building site after an earthquake, the rescue staff are eager to know the inner situation when they can not perform an in-depth reconnaissance. In such a case, search and rescue robots can improve the efficiency of the rescue operation and medical treatment to reduce the casualties. They can not only help the rescue team in rescue operations, but also replace rescue staff in search and rescue missions. Generally, robots can play an increasingly important role in a disaster rescue operation.",

Meanwhile, because a search and rescue robot has lots of potential applications and wide markets, some companies have also been involved in the research and development of search and rescue robots. Additionally, the international robot competition, Robot World Cup (RoboCup), initiates a special rescue competition \"RoboCup Rescue\", which has provided a test platform for the theory and simulation technology in rescue robotics. Currently, the technology of a search and rescue robot is developing from theoretical and experimental research to applications. In 2005, IEEE International Workshop on Safety, Security and Rescue Robotics (IEEE SSRR p05), which held in June 2005 in Kobe, expected that robotics would provide an effective solution for the next-age disaster mitigation and become one of the indispensable components of the social infrastructure. The attendances came from 16 different countries or regions. Their research on rescue robotics is different, comprehensive and diversified because of the difference in the level of skills, geographic and political factors, disaster types, ruins and the robot tasks. In the following sections, a survey of the research status of search and rescue robots in Japan, USA, China and other countries will be introduced separately.",

Considering the most important thing is to locate the lives in debris and the robot must be in a narrow space, they have developed the SOURYU series. In the fire-fighting scene with water tubes, they have developed the water-driven multi-wheel robots named GENBU-I, GENBU-II and GENBU-III that use high-pressure water as their power to move and distribute water.",

As shown in Fig. 2 , the robot is composed of multiple tracks and it can enter into a narrow space. With the active joints or passive joints between adjacent units, it is good at crossing barriers and adapting to the ground. In Kyoto University, Osuka et al. developed a four-section rescue robot \"MOIRA\" with four sides equipped tracks [6] . As shown in Fig. 3 , the robot used each four motor to drive four tracks simultaneously and separately, which made it good at shuttling in the ruins and free of tipping. Figure 4 shows a deformation robot \"CUBIC-R\" developed by Tabata et al. [7] . With tracks around, this robot can be in a contraction model like a cubic and it can be turned into a variety of other models. Figure 5 shows the information collecting robot \"MA-1\" developed by Professor Matsuno et al. from the University of Electro-Communications [8] . Figure 6 is the rescue mobile robot \"RESDOG\" developed by Nagatani et al. in Okayama University (http://usm.sys.okayama-u.ac.jp/~keiji/Research/ Prj-Rescue/rescue.html, 2005-08-25). In the bottom suspension of the robot, several passive triangle type tracks provide excellent terrain adaptability.

In Center for Robotic Assisted Search and Rescue (CRASAR), a non-profit research center based at the University of Florida that is led by Robin Murphy CRASAR, has developed many robotic technologies to assist search and rescue teams [12] . As shown in Fig. 12 (a), the rescue robot Bujold is equipped with medical sensors. The tracked robot has high mobility and excellent detection capabilities. Meanwhile, the robot can collect information such as survivors, physical information and environmental information and then transmit them outside. The SCOUT robot in Fig. 12 (b) is developed by Stoeter et al. from the University of Minnesota [13] . With simple sensor modules, locomotion unit, and specialized operational tool, it can be used for multi-robot's parallel information collection. The robot has flexible protection wheels on outer side. With two inspection/locomotion arms, TerminatorBot, the physical structure of which is very cleverly designed as shown in [15] . With the fast stair climbing ability, it is simple and easy to be controlled. Figure 12 (e) provides a rescue mobile robot with an elephant nose like a manipulator developed by Wolf et al. from Carnegie Mellon University [16] . The mobile robot has a mobile platform, which can greatly increase the mobility and exploration space of the lends Urbie in many different applications. Such robots could investigate urban environments contaminated with radiation, biological warfare, or chemical spills. They could also be used for search and rescue in earthquake-struck buildings and other disaster zones (http://robotics.jpl.nasa.gov/tasks/ tmr/ hybrid.html, 2005-08-25).",

The present version of Sharif University's rescue robot EMDAD1, as shown in Fig. 17(a) , is a tele-operated robot. An operator remotely controls the robot through a TCP/IP wireless local-area network (WLAN) and receives the images and sounds of the scene when the robot is moving on. The software developed for this robot consists of a user-friendly interface, control programs, simple versions of path drawing and planning and stereo vision image processing programs. In the next version, additional software will be used to provide more autonomy for victim detection, collision avoidance and decision making (http://linux.ce.sharif.ac.ir/~mobasser/ RESCUE1.HTM, 2005-08-25). In the Robocup 2003, which held in Padova, Italy, the first three robot winners in sequence are the \"ROBRNO\" shown in Fig. 17(b) from Brno University of Technology, Czech Republic, the \"Cedra\" shown in Fig. 17(c) from Sharif University of Technology, Iran, and the \"IUTMicrobot\" shown in Fig. 17 ",

For instance, in a fire disaster, the robot platform should overcome the extremely high temperature and be paid special attention in materials selection. In a dangerous gas or toxic liquid, the robots must face the threat caused by toxic corrosion; therefore, both material selection and structural sealing are important. In the disaster ruins with acute edges, the safety of the robot's wires and the surface hardness should be considered. Considering the power supply of search and rescue robots, both the wired supply and the wireless way are required to ensure the rescue operation hours.",

On the other hand, the robot should overcome the obstacles as many as possible. The stability and the self-adjusting ability are very important in avoiding dropping into fragments. Being repeated, modularized and fault-tolerance, the link-type snake-like structure is proved to be one of the most efficient mechanisms for the search and rescue operation. In the unstructured environment, it is unavoidable that the robot will be damaged or part of it will fail out, therefore, fault-tolerance and fault-handling are important in such cases.

            "text": "Sensors are the most vulnerable components for a search and rescue robot. They have three applications: robot control, environmental inspection and victims or survivals detection. In robot control, the robot must be aware of its right position, posture, speed and inner status to keep itself work normally. Such equipment includes charge coupled device (CCD) cameras, laser rangefinders, ultrasonic range finder, contact sensors, force sensors, infrared sensors and global position system (GPS) sensors. In environmental inspection, environmental information is very important for robot's working status, operation efficiency, saving energy and preventing accidents. Environmental inspection includes air quality (oxygen, hydrogen sulfide, methane and carbon dioxide) inspection and detection of temperature, humidity and radioactive substances. Environmental information determines the effects on a human body to avoid the rescuer getting into the similar dangerous situation. Environmental inspection includes both environmental geology and topography for the two reasons: 1) to avoid the environments with obvious threat to robots; b) to avoid causing greater damage and a secondary collapse. The static/dynamic ground, as well as its shape and characteristics, is usually different. Therefore, terrain detection is difficult. In victim or survivals detection, objects include the victims or survivals' body, clothing, footprint, voice information, temperature infor mation, apparel information, position information and the unique human-ray findings, are used to judge the existence information and lives of victims. Under some special cases, the same detection system can also be used to search for the victims of animals. In a sensor system, the video information is crucial to a search and rescue robot because in rescue process the video information can be utilized by the operator to get the onsite observation. A video can be used like the vision information collector for the remote operator to find the victims. However, a camera is not the ideal visual navigation or the victim's inspection equipment. A head lamp must be equipped for each camera first. In collapsed buildings, all the ground has a thick layer of dust that leads to all the things being gray. If the victims have slight movements, the dust of the ground will be significantly changed. Therefore, color camera is indispensable. New technology such as digital temperature camera has good recognition ability, but it has too high requirement to an operator. Sonar can not work at such a case, because there are too many edges and corners that are noncontinuous. The ground-penetrating radar, microwave radar and laser detector have good results; therefore, the cost and energy consumption are unbearable. Another solution is to use the artificial intelligence technology, nanotechnology, or bionic technology to develop low cost sensors.",

In fact, there is a lot of software processing and it is difficult for the robot to complete it independently. A human-machine interface is indispensable. Rescuers must predicate what will happen to make good use of existing resources. In many cases, the robot is not only a tool, but also the substitute of operators.
