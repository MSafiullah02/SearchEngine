To elucidate the possible role of NEC in antigen presentation, we examined the expression of HLA-DR, CD80 and CD86 in NEC, their regulation by cytokines and the capacity of NEC to induce antigen-specific proliferation of T cells. Methods We examined the expression of HLA-DR, CD80 and CD86 in nasal epithelial scrapings of patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis (SAR) to Japanese cedar pollen preseason and in-season, by immunohistochemistry. Next, we examined the effect of IL-1b, TNF-a, (IFN-g), IL-4 a, IL-13 and diesel exhaust particles (DEP) on the HLA-DR, CD80 and CD86 expression in cultured nasal epithelial cells (CNEC), by flow cytometry. Further, we analysed the capacity of mite antigen (Der f II)-pulsed mitomycin-C-treated CNEC to induce proliferation of autologous T cells from patients with perennial allergic rhinitis. Results NEC constitutively expressed HLA-DR and CD86, but not CD80. The expression of HLA-DR and CD86 in NEC was significantly increased in-season, in patients with SAR as compared with that of pre-season. While IFN-g up-regulated the expression of HLA-DR, IL-1b and TNF-a up-regulated the expression of CD86 in CNEC. Furthermore, in the presence of mite antigen, CNEC induced the proliferation of autologous peripheral blood T lymphocytes. Anti-CD86 and anti-HLA-DR monoclonal antibody but not anti-CD80 inhibited the epithelial cell-induced T cell proliferation. Stimulation with a combination of DEP and mite antigen significantly up-regulated HLA-DR and CD86 expression in CNEC. Conclusions These studies suggest that NEC in patients with AR may play a role in antigen presentation through the enhanced expression of HLA-DR and CD86. Furthermore, these results suggest the possibility that DEP may enhance the antigen-presenting function of CNEC.",

However, recent studies have shown that epithelial cells have a much wider range of activities including the release of eicosanoids [2, 3] , endopeptidases [4] , cytokines and chemokines [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] . Epithelial cells in allergic individuals (asthmatics and rhinitics) are in an activated state, as shown by the increased expression of adhesion molecule-like intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) [10, 11] , and the increased production of inflammatory mediators like IL-6, IL-8, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), TNF-a [8, 9] thus contributing to the enhancement of the allergic reaction. However, epithelial cells may also play other important roles via direct cell-to-cell interaction. A proportion of NEC has been reported to express the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) Class II molecule (HLA-DR) [9, [12] [13] [14] [15] . We therefore hypothesized that NEC may probably play a role in antigen presentation.",

            "text": "In addition to HLA-DR, CD80 and CD86 (B7-1 and 2) are key co-stimulatory molecules involved in antigen presentation [16] . Optimal activation of T cells requires both costimulation and T cell receptor engagement. Antigen presentation in the absence of co-stimulation may lead to T cell anergy. Co-stimulatory interactions between the B7 family ligands expressed on antigen-presenting cells (APC) and their receptors on T cells play critical roles in the growth, differentiation and death of T cells [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] . Engagement of the T cell co-stimulatory receptor CD28 by its ligands CD80 and CD86 augments the activation of T cells and promotes T cell survival. The question as to whether NEC expresses co-stimulatory molecules is relevant because epithelial cells express MHC Class II molecules. However, little is known about the expression of co-stimulatory molecules on NEC. To elucidate the possible role of NEC in antigen presentation, we examined the expression of HLA-DR, CD80 and CD86 in NEC and its regulation by cytokines. We also examined the potential of cultured nasal epithelial cells (CNEC) in inducing antigen-specific proliferation of autologous T cell.",

            "text": "Airway epithelial cells have been considered to play a simple role as a mucosal barrier while being involved in the secretion of mucous or the removal of foreign agents by their cilia [1] . However, over the recent years, several studies suggest that airway epithelial cells can also act as immune effector cells in response to endogenous or exogenous stimuli and play a key role in the immunologic interaction between the airway and the external environment, being the primary interface for antigenic materials in immune and inflammatory responses. Epithelial cells are known to play an important role in allergic inflammation by the increased expression of adhesion molecules like ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 [10, 11] and the increased production of inflammatory mediators like IL-6, IL-8, GM-CSF and TNF-a [8, 9] . However, epithelial cells may also play other important roles via direct cellto-cell interaction. In this study, we noticed the expression of HLA-DR on NEC in patients with AR. HLA-DR is known to play a significant role in antigen presentation to T cells [16] , and CD80 and CD86 are essential to this function as co-stimulatory molecules. Signals transduced through the T cell receptor after antigen recognition are not sufficient for full T cell activation. Recent studies have demonstrated that at least two signals provided by APC are required to induce effective T cell activation [27] . The first signal is antigen specific and occurs after T cell receptor recognition of the MHC-antigen complex. The second signal, often termed the co-stimulatory signal is produced through a set of receptor and co-receptor interactions between APC and T cells. More specifically, the interaction of CD80 or CD86 on APC with CD28 on T cells is required for full T cell activation and effector function [28, 29] . The importance of these interactions is reflected in the observations that T cell receptor recognition of the MHC-antigen complex in the absence of co-stimulatory signals can lead to the induction of anergy [18, 27] . Recent studies have suggested that structural cells, such as keratinocytes [30] , gastric epithelial cells [31] and colonic epithelial cells, also expressed CD80 and CD86 [32] and could provide co-stimulatory signals through these molecules. Ye et al. [31] demonstrated that the human gastric epithelial cell line and freshly isolated epithelial cells from gastric biopsies expressed CD80 and CD86, and T cell proliferation by gastric epithelial cell was significantly inhibited by anti-CD86 mAb. Nakazawa et al. [32] demonstrated that freshly isolated colonic epithelial cells from patients with ulcerative colitis efficiently co-stimulated the proliferation of CD4 1 T cells, and this response was significantly inhibited by anti-CD86 mAb. In the present study, we demonstrated an increased expression of HLA-DR and CD86 in freshly isolated nasal scrapings of patients with SAR to JCP in-season as compared with that off-season. We also demonstrated an increased expression of HLA-DR and CD86 in NEC of patients with PAR to HDM. The increase in percentage positive NEC expressing CD86 and HLA-DR that is increased in-season in SAR patients, as analysed by immunohistochemistry, is comparable with the increase in percentage-positive NEC expressing HLA-DR or CD86 of PAR patients in response to relevant cytokines or DEP plus antigen as analysed by FACS. Furthermore, we also demonstrated that NEC can function as APC through the expression of HLA-DR and CD86. CD80 expression was not detected in NEC by immunohistochemical staining, and anti-CD80 mAb could not inhibit the epithelial cell-induced T cell proliferation. These findings suggest that CD86 is more important as compared with CD80 in regulating antigen presentation by NEC in patients with AR. Antigen presentation to T cells is an important intital step in the pathophysiology of allergic diseases like AR and atopic asthma. In a previous study using immunohistochemical analysis, dendritic cells (professional APC) were reported in the nasal epithelial layer, but numerically these cells are very few in number [33, 34] . Antigenpresenting function by NEC could be important because of their predominance in number in the nasal epithelial layer. Godthelp et al. [34] reported that the number of HLA-DR-positive NECs did not increase after 2 weeks of antigen provocation out of season in SAR (grass pollen) patients. However, in the present study, HLA-DR was upregulated in-season in NEC as the nasal epithelial scrapings were obtained from patients under natural exposure to allergen and during the peak season in a heavy pollen JCP season. These observations suggest that sufficient natural exposure to allergen is more important to induce a significant up-regulation of HLA-DR in NEC to of SAR patients.",

            "text": "There is increasing evidence that AR or asthma, chronic airway inflammatory diseases characterized by reversible airway obstruction, hyper-reactivity and lymphocyte/ eosinophil recruitment are driven and maintained by chronically activated T cells with a T-helper 2 (Th2) phenotype. These T cells promote the activation and recruitment of B cells and regulate the Ig class switch to the development of antigen-specific IgE responses [35] [36] [37] [38] . We previously reported that a majority of the CD4 1 T cells in the nasal mucosa of allergic rhinitics coexpressed the CD45RO surface molecule, and a predominant proportion of CD4 1 T cells in the nasal epithelium were CD45RO 1 (memory T cells) [39] . These T cells can be activated more easily as compare with the na\u00efve T cells. Epithelial cells are in direct contact with the inhalant allergens and based on the presence of the memory T cells in the epithelial layer and the capacity of epithelial cells to induce antigen-specific proliferation of T cells, epithelial cells may play more important roles in on-going allergic inflammation. While we have shown that mast cellepithelial cell interaction contributes to enhancing allergic inflammation [40] , airway epithelial cell-induced T cell activation may significantly contribute to the development of chronic airway inflammatory diseases such as AR or asthma. Furthermore, in separate studies, we have shown that NEC express the a and g chains of the high-affinity IgE receptor (FceRI), further emphasizing their potential role in the recognition of IgE-complexed allergens. Moreover, we have also shown that IL-4 can upregulate the expression of the FceRI a chain in NEC, suggesting an up-regulation of antigen-presenting function in an enhanced Th2 microenvironment as in the case of allergic inflammation [41] .",

Bachert et al. [42] previously reported the increased levels of IL-1b and TNF-a in nasal secretions from patients with AR. This finding suggests the possibility that the increased levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines like IL-1b and TNF-a in-season in patients with JCP may contribute towards the up-regulation of the CD86 expression in NEC. In contrast, a lower level of IFN-g mRNA was observed in the nasal mucosa of patients with PAR [43] and in the nasal mucosa of patients with SAR after the allergen provocation test [44] . We demonstrated modest levels of IFN-g in the nasal mucosa of PAR patients even though the levels were lower than in those with chronic infective rhinitis [45] . Linden et al. [46] demonstrated high levels of IFN-g in nasal lavage fluid from subjects with acute infectious rhinitis caused by coronavirus inoculation, in contrast, and lower levels of IFN-g in subjects with AR after allergen challenge. These findings suggest the possibility that respiratory viral infections can up-regulate the APC function of NEC through the enhanced expression of HLA-DR induced by IFN-g and this may in part explain the aggravation of allergic symptoms upon viral infection.",

            "text": "Epidemiological studies have shown a significant association between exposure to various pollutants and increase in allergic diseases. DEP has been demonstrated to have an adjuvant activity for IgE synthesis in vivo [26, 47] . Diaz-Sanchez et al. showed that transnasal challenges of the DEP-derived extract in humans enhanced local IgE and cytokine production [25, 48, 49] , and combined DEP and ragweed allergen challenge enhanced local ragweedspecific IgE [50] . We demonstrated that DEP up-regulated the expression of HLA-DR in CNEC and this up-regulation was enhanced by a combined stimulation of DEP and mite antigen (Der f II). Although DEP alone did not up-regulate the expression of CD86, the combined stimulation of DEP and Der f II significantly up-regulated the expression of CD86 in CNEC. In vitro studies have shown that mite allergens induce the production of proinflammatory cytokines from airway epithelial cells through the activation of protease-activated receptor (PAR)-2 [51] . On the other hand, DEP can enhance the cytokine secretion from airway epithelial cells [23] and can up-regulate the expression of adhesion molecules like ICAM-1 on bronchial epithelial cells [52] , and this process is dependent on p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and nuclear factor-kB (NF-kB) activation pathways [52, 53] . In the present study, mite antigen up-regulated the production of IL-6, IL-8 and GM-CSF from NEC but this was not further up-regulated with addition of DEP. Although the precise mechanism by which it up-regulates the expression of HLA-DR or CD86 is not yet known, similar mechanisms may probably regulate the expression of these molecules. One of the possible mechanisms may be via the arylhydrocarbon receptor (AhR) in cytosol [54] . More recently, using TLR-4 point mutant mice, Inoue et al. [55] demonstrated that DEP exposure significantly induced the lung expression of IL-1b, keratinocyte chemoattractant (KC) and macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1a when compared with vehicle challenge. In the presence of DEP, the levels of IL-1b, KC and fibrinogen were up-regulated. These researchers suggest that TLR-4 is one of the recognition receptors against DEP in the airways. In fact, NEC express TLR-4 and its expression is up-regulated in patients with PAR (unpublished observations). Furthermore, recently, DEP has been shown to induce antigen-independent dendritic cell maturation (phenotypic or functional) via epithelial cell-dendritic cell interactions mediated by epithelial cell derived GM-CSF [56] . On the other hand, DEP can enhance peripheral blood T cell activation directly in severe asthmatics [57] . However, the precise immunological mechanisms by which DEP enhance allergic sensitization and inflammation are not yet well defined.",

Furthermore, these molecules are up-regulated by pro-inflammatory cytokines like IFN-g, TNF-a, IL-1b as well as allergen and DEP. These findings also demonstrate a novel role for DEP in enhancing allergic inflammation through the up-regulation of co-stimulatory molecules that regulate antigen presentation in NEC and thus modulation of the airway epithelial cell function.",

IL-4 and IL-13 did not have any effect on the expression of HLA-DR or CD86 in CNEC (data not shown).The increase in the percentage positive NEC expressing CD86 and HLA-DR in-season of SAR patients, as compared with off season and as analysed by immunohistochemistry is in concert with the increased expression of CD86 and HLA-DR in NEC of PAR patients at baseline (unstimulated CNEC) and the increase in percentage positive NEC expressing HLA-DR or CD86 in response to relevant cytokines, as analysed by FACS.Proliferative responses of autologous T cells to Der f IIpulsed CNEC and inhibitory effects of anti-CD80, CD86 and HLA-DR mAbs We next investigated the ability of CNEC to induce the proliferation of autologous T cells.

Purified T cells (1 \u00c210 5 /well) from perennial allergic rhinitis patients with house dust mite allergy were co-cultured for 72 h with mitomycin-C-treated CNEC in the presence or absence of Der f II (10 mg/mL) or phytohaemaglutinin (PHA) (0.1 mg/mL) and the proliferation of T cells was analysed by ( 3 H)-thymidine uptake. (a) Der f II (1, 5, 10 mg/mL) pulsed mitomycin-treated CNEC induced the proliferation of T cells in a dose-dependent manner, (n = 3). (b) PHA (0.1 mg/mL) pulsed mitomycin-treated CNEC induced the proliferation of autologous T cells, (n = 3). (c) Inhibition studies were performed using the anti-HLA-DR monoclonal antibody (mAb) anti-CD80 mAb, and the anti-CD86 mAb or the relevant mouse IgG (as control) (5 mg/mL). Anti-CD86 and anti-HLA-DR mAbs, but not anti-CD80 inhibited the epithelial cell-induced T cell proliferation.
