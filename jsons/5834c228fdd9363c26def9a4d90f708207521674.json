            "text": "Molecular-based diagnostics is critical for prevention, identification, and treatment of disease. Current laboratory analyses support correct diagnosis in over 70 % of all diseases and can be used to aid the continuous monitoring of drug therapy [4]. Traditional diagnosis system in central laboratory is therefore a vital component in the clinic and in local general practice. However, classic diagnostic technologies are not completely well suited to meeting the expanded testing requirement because they rely on complicated sample purification and sophisticated instruments which are labor-intensive, timely, and expensive and require of well-trained operators. One of the main challenges for industry is to develop fast, relatively accurate, easy-to-use, and inexpensive devices. For example, microscopy observation requires less infrastructure and is more widely available based on the simplicity and low cost; however, the accuracy is somehow questionable and underutilized (e.g., smear tests for tuberculosis, malaria, and schistosomiasis) [5] [6] [7] . As a result, it not only increases the cost and inconvenience of health care but also causes patients to leave the medical system before the diagnostic result is obtained [8] . Faster and more accurate diagnostic tests that require minimum laboratory equipment and operation training play an important role in expanding health care in resource-constrained settings [9, 10] .",

            "text": "The chief application driving the early development of solid-phase, rapid-test technology was the human pregnancy test, which was symbolic of continued historical interest in urine testing for medical diagnostic purposes. This particular testing application made great strides in the 1970s, as a result of improvements in antibody generation technologies and significant gains in understanding the biology and detection of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), derived largely from the work performed by Vaitukaitis and colleagues [20] . However, to entirely evolve the lateral-flow test, considerable enabling technologies were still required. Many of these technologies, such as nitrocellulose membrane manufacturing, antibody generation, and processing equipment, were developed throughout the 1990s. The purpose of this article is to introduce readers with basic information regarding the LFIA approach. Figure 1 .1 displays the key elements of a LFIA. This assay consists of several components, often segmented parts made of different materials. When a test is run, appropriately conditioned sample is added to the proximal end of the strip, the absorbent pad. The treated sample then migrates to the conjugate pad, where an appropriate reagent has been immobilized. The labeled reagent on the conjugate pad can be colloidal gold, or a colored, fluorescent, or paramagnetic latex particle. These specific biological components can be either antigen or antibody depending on the assay format. Next, the sample remobilizes the dried reagent, and particle interaction ensues. Sample and reagent then migrate to the next segment of the strip, the reaction matrix. The reaction matrix is a porous membrane, upon which a final specific biological component has been immobilized. These biological components are usually proteins, either antibody or antigen. They have been bound onto the specific lines of the membrane being used. As the sample and reagent reach this line, they are captured by the applied proteins, and excess liquid moves past this point and is taken up by the absorbent pad. The result is the detectable absence or presence of the test line, read by eyes or by other instruments.",

A positive result is indicated by the presence of a test line. The conjugated particles also reach and are captured at the control line. The control line typically comprises a species-specific anti-immunoglobulin antibody, specific for the antibody in the conjugate pad. Competitive assay is usually used when testing for small molecules with single antigenic determinants that cannot bind to antibodies on a test line simultaneously.

If we chose inappropriate antibody, it would not have ability to recognize the target antigen. Much time is spent determining the most suitable antibody for specific assays. Many scientists have spent a great deal of time figuring out the suitable antibodies to fit the assay. The LFIA is particularly demanding in terms of the mass of the reagent used to drive the antibody and antigen interaction. When an antibody is used in a sandwich-type assay, they are applied at a ratio of 1-3 \u00b5g per cm across the width of the nitrocellulose strip, in a line 1 mm wide and with a relatively shallow bed volume of 0.13 mm. This results in an antibody concentration of 10-30 \u00b5g per square cm, which is 25-100 times that used in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), which can typically require a maximum concentration of 300 ng per square cm [21] .",

A condensing atmosphere should be avoided, as liquid in the pores can cause redistribution of mobile components, such as the surfactant. When a membrane is being prepared for application of the capture reagents, it should be allowed to equilibrate to the humidity of the dispensing room.

Semiquantitative results could be determined by comparing urine-treated test strips to a color-coded chart to determine glucose concentration. Today, commercial urinalysis dipsticks have been widely adapted for a number of analyses. In the 1980s, serological lateral-flow tests started to emerge, particularly for human pregnancy tests.

At least 30 previously unknown disease agents have been identified since 1973, including HIV, Ebola, hepatitis C, and SARS. In chronic diseases, there remains significant growth, particularly in the areas of inflammation, cardiac markers, and cancer, with a myriad of new labels in development in the search for improved diagnostic and prognostic indicators.",

There is a growing demand from food companies for quicker testing to facilitate more rapid release of finished goods and thus reduce inventories. A driver in the demand for rapid and LFIA tests in food production is the adoption of hazard analysis and critical control point (HAACP) regulations that prescribe test procedures throughout the manufacturing process.",
