Also, broiler chickens in organic systems showed an increased prevalence of Campylobacter compared with chickens in conventional systems. Cui et al.

Increased disease prevalence and a greater effect of a disease both result in increased health care costs. Health care costs include all economic effects of a disease and are the sum of 2 components: losses and expenditures (McInerney, 1996). Losses can be caused, for example, by mortality, morbidity, reduced production efficiency, and lower meat yield and quality, which results in reduced returns. Extra expenditures are mainly the costs of veterinary prophylactic and therapeutic treatments to prevent or treat a disease (McInerney et al., 1992; Bennett, 2003; Houe, 2003; Bennett and Ijpelaar, 2005).",

Three categories are distinguished within the Better Life hallmark depending on the level of AW: Better Life 1*, Better Life 2*, and Better Life 3*. The number of stars increases as the assumed level of welfare increases. Puur & Eerlijk products fit under the Better Life 1* concept. This concept has the same requirements as in the Volwaard concept, except that a lower stocking density is required (25 kg per m2). The requirements of Better Life 3* concept are the same as the production standards of SKAL (the independent organization that audits organic systems in the Netherlands). The organic standards of SKAL are different from the European Union standards for organic production, but the European Union standards should eventually be implemented in all European Union countries, which means that the European Union standards for organic production are included in the study as well.",

The selection of diseases was mainly based on Bergevoet et al. (2010), who identified the most important diseases and disorders in a broiler farm in the Netherlands by scoring them on several aspects, such as epidemiology and business economics. In this way, infectious bronchitis (IB), coccidiosis, Escherichia coli, and necrotic enteritis (NE) were included in this study, along with infectious bursal disease (IBD), sudden death syndrome (SDS), ascites, and leg problems (European Commission, 2000; De Jong et al., 2012). Enterococcus, which had a relatively high score in terms of epidemiological and business economics aspects, had to be excluded because little is known about its spread and pathogens (Bergevoet et al., 2010). Diseases for which vaccinations are obligatory in the Netherlands, such as Newcastle disease, were excluded from the study (GD, 2012). The selected diseases were considered to be the most prevalent diseases in the broiler farms; they were economically relevant and could be distinguished between systems (Ruff, 1999; European Commission, 2000; Bennett and Ijpelaar, 2005; Rushton, 2009; Bergevoet et al., 2010; De Jong et al., 2012). Because the prevalence and severity of diseases of a particular organ system can differ depending on housing conditions, the 8 selected diseases were categorized into 5 groups according to organ system: diseases concerning the respiratory system (IB), the organs of immune system (IBD), the gastrointestinal tract (coccidiosis, E. coli, and NE), the locomotion system (leg problems), and the heart and vascular system (ascites and SDS; Table 2\n). The final selection was discussed with an expert from the Dutch Animal Health Service who specializes in poultry diseases (J. J. de Wit, Dutch Animal Health Service, Deventer, the Netherlands, personal communication).",

A loss implies a foregone benefit, such as lower revenue or lower productivity as a consequence of slower growth (McInerney et al., 1992; McInerney, 1996). Expenditures mainly originate from disease prevention and treatments (McInerney et al., 1992). Evidently, a trade-off exists between L and E: higher treatment and prevention expenditures result in lower losses, and vice versa; the optimal level of L and E is determined by the prices of inputs and outputs (McInerney, 1996). It is possible that a lower output caused by a disease coincides with a lower input such as feed consumption. In this case, the loss can be calculated in such a way that the input saved is deducted from the loss incurred (McInerney et al., 1992).",

System requirements, such as breed, enrichment, stocking density, and input variables (mortality, feed conversion, and so on) differ by production systems. These differences have an effect on production costs, which means that baseline situations had to be calculated for each production system. Health care costs are determined by the prevalence and effect of a disease, both of which differ by production systems. The change in production costs due to a disease regarding a particular production system, that is, absolute effect, was calculated as the difference between the production costs in the baseline situation (healthy) and the production costs in the situation with a particular endemic disease. Calculation of absolute effect only partly enables a comparison between production systems. For a more detailed comparison, 2 relative measures were calculated: the relative effect on production costs and the proportion of the health care costs in total production costs. The relative effect on production costs was determined as the ratio of the increase in production costs due to a disease to production costs in the healthy baseline situation. To obtain the proportion of health care costs in total production costs, the absolute effect was divided by the total production costs in the situation with a particular disease.",

In the second category (which included Volwaard, Better Life 1*, and Better Life 2*), the relative effect of gastrointestinal diseases was lower (approximately 8%) than in the conventional system. In the third category, however, their relative effect was almost at the same level as that in the conventional system. The effect of leg problems decreased with increasing AW standards. The relative effect of other diseases remained below 1% in all systems, which meant they were less important in that regard.",

In conventional and middle-market systems, the proportion of loss within total health care costs is approximately 3 times greater than the proportion of expenditures. In Better Life 3* and organic systems, the proportion of loss is approximately 90% of the total health care costs. However, in case of coccidiosis, health care costs were solely derived from loss (100%) in these 2 systems, whereas in conventional systems, 73% of health care costs came from loss. This larger loss due to coccidiosis in Better Life 3* and organic systems occurred because the use of anticoccidal drugs was prohibited, which meant that procuring them incurred no expenditures. In general, the proportion of loss in total health care costs is larger than that of expenditures. Because the symptoms of gastrointestinal diseases remain subclinical, these diseases usually remain untreated. For example, a less efficient feed conversion due to a gastrointestinal disease results in a higher feed consumption and, ultimately, in higher feed costs. This implies that it is more difficult to detect the actual effect of these diseases because they are not incurred as direct expenditures. The loss due to leg problems decreased in the middle-market systems due to increasing AW standards. In the organic system, no health care costs occurred due to leg problems.",

            "text": "The approach used in our study involved certain approximations and assumptions. First, own labor cost was assumed to be fixed. A farm was assumed to have as many animal places as can be managed by one FTE. When diseases occur, the activities on the farm may require more time than the farmer has available and extra personnel may have to be hired, potential causing health care costs to increase. The literature on time spent on treatment and hygiene measures as a consequence of a disease occurrence is scarce. The broiler farmer was assumed to have time available to perform these activities. Second, the default values used in this study, such as weight at delivery and feed conversion rate, were averages representing the Netherlands and thus country specific. It is unknown whether and to what extent these values were influenced by diseases. No corrections were made in this respect, which means that these values may differ in practice. However, this assumption is not expected to influence the results considerably because it was valid for all systems. Further, only the direct disease effects were taken into account, in other words the possible immunosuppressive effect of some diseases was not considered. Third, no interactions were assumed between diseases because, for most diseases, it is still unclear whether and to what extent the effect of the diseases changes in case 2 endemic diseases simultaneously occur in the flock (Cavanagh, 2003; Matthijs et al., 2003). Fourth, we assumed that vaccination against IB and IBD would protect the flock 100% and that these diseases would no longer occur on the farm. In case of IBD, however, the hygienic status of the farm is known to influence the effectiveness of the vaccine (M\u00fcller et al., 2012). Moreover, little is known about whether the vaccine offers cross-protection against other serotypes. A farm with an outdoor area for chickens is expected to have a lower level of hygiene, which negatively affects the effectiveness of the vaccine. Moreover, chickens in an organic farm have more antibodies against IBD than chickens in conventional farms (Van Overbeke et al., 2006). Hence, in case of farms with Better Life 2*, Better Life 3*, and organic systems, which have an increased risk of IBD, a more expensive vaccination program was assumed to be implemented. Because a vaccine against IB may not provide 100% protection either (Cavanagh, 2003), chickens were assumed to be vaccinated twice. The study investigates the health care costs of the preventive measures, not the economic feasibility. In other words, if vaccination prevented great losses, it was chosen as a preventive measure. Fifth, the chickens were assumed to be equally susceptible and sensitive to the diseases throughout the entire growth period. The effect of current breeder health programs is implicitly taken into account, because the prevalence and effect of diseases were determined based on the current production systems and the characteristics of breeds currently used in practice. This model does not take potential resistance against preventive drugs and antibiotics into account. However, coccidiosis is known to be more and more resistant against anticoccidial drugs, which mitigates the negative effects of diseases to a lesser extent (Jenkins et al., 2010). Hence, avoidable costs might be lower than those estimated in the model. Resistance to drugs against NE and E. coli has also been increasing. In each system, the same amount of drugs was assumed to be used. The study did not include the potential effect of a particular disease in previous and subsequent production rounds. Sixth, health care costs may have been overestimated to some extent. A disease has an effect on the production function, and therefore on the optimal production level (McInerney, 1996). An economically rational farmer would minimize the effect of a disease by adjusting the level of input use, which would probably result in health care costs lower than those estimated in this study. Finally, figures for prevalence and effect might not entirely reflect the latest developments in broiler production. For example, in recent years the incidence of ascites has reduced due to including ascites in the selection index; however, recent figures cannot be found in literature. As a consequence, the actual values for prevalence may be lower than those we used in our calculation. However, this holds for all systems. Therefore, the differences between systems remain similar. In other words, whereas actual costs due to ascites may be lower, the relative differences between systems remain unchanged. Moreover, due to various assumptions and estimations, production costs may be under- or overestimated. Therefore, it is important that these costs are not used as indicators, but to comprehensively assess the differences between systems. Sensitivity analysis showed that ranking of production systems is robust to changes in feed price, feed conversion, and price of 1-d-old chicks.",

The results of the study show that health care costs represent only a small proportion of total production costs, regardless of the production system. Losses account for the majority of health care costs, which makes the actual effect of diseases on total health care costs difficult to detect. Three categories of production systems were distinguished based on health care costs. The first category includes conventional systems, in which diseases affecting the gastrointestinal tract and leg problems had the highest effect on production costs in both absolute and relative terms. Similarly, in the second category, referred to as middle-market systems, gastrointestinal diseases and leg problems had the highest effect on production costs. However, the effect of these diseases was lower than that of diseases in conventional system. The decrease in effect can be explained by the fact that these AW systems use a more robust breed with a slower growth rate. In the third category, gastrointestinal diseases had the highest effect and the overall effect of gastrointestinal diseases was similar to that in the conventional system. However, the effect of coccidiosis increased compared with the conventional system, most likely due to prohibition on the use of anticoccidial drugs and the provision of an outdoor access. Moreover, leg problems and heart and vascular diseases disappeared completely, which is probably the result of the use of a more robust breed with a slower growth rate. Angel (2007) suggested that chickens with slower early growth rate have less problems with skeletal development. Also, research indicated that there was a direct correlation between high growth rate and ascites (European Commission, 2000).",

Vermeij (2004) and Vermeij and Van Horne (2008) calculated cost-prices for organic broiler farms in 2004 and in 2008. The total health care costs were estimated at \u20ac0.12 per broiler in 2004 and \u20ac0.10 per broiler in 2008. These estimates do not agree with the results of this study, in which the absolute health care costs are often higher than \u20ac0.10 per delivered broiler in an organic farm. Lovland and Kaldhusdal (2001) found that the profit margin decreased by 33% in case of high levels of NE in the flock compared with low levels of the disease. Moreover, the absolute costs due to NE in the United States were estimated at US$0.05 per broiler chicken (McDevitt et al., 2006). In another American study, the loss ranged between $878.19 and $1,480.52 per flock of 20,000 broilers. This works out to an estimated $0.044 to 0.074 per chicken (Skinner et al., 2010), which, based on exchange rates at the time of writing, equates to approximately \u20ac0.03 to 0.06 per broiler. This is in agreement with the results of the conventional system. However, these costs are much higher in Better Life 3* and organic systems. Lund and Algers (2003) supported the findings of this study. Based on a literature study, they concluded that the level of animal health in an organic farm was the same or slightly lower level than in a conventional system, except for (endo-)parasitic infections, which occurred more often in an organic farm. The occurrence of other diseases remained at the same level or decreased compared with a conventional system. This difference can also be found in the results of the present study. In other words, the occurrence of parasitic infections, such as coccidiosis, increases compared with a conventional system, whereas the occurrence of other diseases, such as leg problems, SDS, and ascites, decreases.",
