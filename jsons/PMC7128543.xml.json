            "text": "Although the treatment of cancer using active immunotherapy has had limited success, passive immunotherapy with antibody and cytokine therapies brings new hope. The most widely studied approaches consist of whole-cell vaccines, dendritic cell-based immunotherapy and peptide vaccines. Many clinical studies have demonstrated safety but not necessarily the efficacy of such strategies [3]. Moreover, there is emerging consensus that the most efficacious therapy should activate several components of the immune system [4]. Cytokine therapy in cancer is another attractive approach; however, balancing optimal doses to avoid toxic reactions remains challenging [5]. Several cytotoxic drugs have immunomodulatory effects at relatively low doses and can exert immunity-dependent curative effects in animal models of cancer. Combination therapies involving low-dose anticancer agents and cytokines have demonstrated some benefits. For example, combinations of appropriate regimens of doxorubicin plus interleukin (IL)-2 or tumour necrosis factor (TNF) could be curative and produced a life-long immunological memory in an EL4 lymphoma C57BL/6 mouse model. Many researchers have demonstrated that the induction of T-helper (Th) 1-promoting cytokines, using specific adjuvants, can enhance antitumour immunity and can prevent or reduce tumour growth. These trends substantiate the possibility of establishing combination regimens based on low-dose anticancer drugs, specific cytokines and immunological adjuvants [6].",

Interferons are widely used for the treatment of chronic infections, particularly hepatitis B, D and C viruses [10]. Pegylated interferon is a recently developed pharmaceutical preparation that has proven beneficial in non-responsive patients, particularly in those with cirrhosis or hepatitis C virus genotype 1 [11]. Other cytokines, such as IL-1, IL-2 and IL-17, have shown potential in augmenting immune responses in various infectious conditions and malignancies. The therapeutic effect of cytokine blockers is also reported in septic shock [12]. A recent study on hepatitis C has shown that interferon-\u03b3 (IFN-\u03b3), in combination with ribavirin, induces a higher percentage of lymphocyte activation [13] than for IFN-\u03b3 alone. Such approaches are currently being examined for their potential to boost host immune response to fight infection.",

Cytokine therapy, such as anti-TNF-\u03b1 or IL-1, has been an attractive treatment option; however, an optimal treatment regimen with respect to dosage, interval and particularly long-term safety needs to be explored [17, 18, 19]. The use of the effector functions of Th cells is now considered to be one of the more promising innovative therapeutic strategies. Thus, the idea of switching Th1-dominated responses into Th2-mediated responses appears intriguing. This approach has been studied in various animal models of autoimmune diseases but clinical validation has not been achieved [20, 21, 22]. Newer targets central to innate and adaptive immunity, such as Toll-like receptors (TLR) and the complement system and nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB) activation, are being studied [23, 24, 25]. Combination approaches to the treatment of inflammatory diseases appear promising; in particular, combining methotrexate with TNF-\u03b1 inhibitors has provided some encouraging results [26].",

This classification is based on their functional capabilities and cytokine profiles. Th1 cells drive the cellular immunity to fight intracellular organisms, eliminate cancerous cells and stimulate delayed-type hypersensitivity reactions. By contrast, Th2 cells drive humoural immunity and upregulate antibody productions to fight extracellular organisms. T-cell homeostasis or immunostasis requires a fine balance between Th1-Th2 response and such agents could exhibit stimulatory, suppressive or regulatory activity [31]. Currently, much of the literature supports the view that Th1-Th2 is essential to immunostasis and many of the T-cell-directed therapies have provided modest clinical benefits [32]. Although this view of signal conversion looks relatively simplistic, mediators of signal transduction do not interact in a linear manner but within a biochemical matrix. As a consequence, each cytokine has multiple functions and their modulation would be expected to result in diverse therapeutic functions. Such complex crosstalk between signalling networks imposes challenges for the discovery of optimal therapeutic interventions [33]. In cancer, researchers have arrived at a consensus that reconstitution of function is important, rather than reconstitution of cells or cytokines, and the most efficacious therapy will be one in which multiple responses of the immune system are activated. Trends indicate that future immunotherapy should involve cocktails of drugs that concurrently and/or simultaneously address vital components of the immune matrix [34]. This will require synergistic combinations for homeostatic regulation of the immune system. Historically, botanicals have facilitated and enriched the drug discovery process and, we propose, should be explored as sources for synergistic combinations.",

It is prominent in Ayurveda as Rasayana with cytoprotective and demulcent effects and is a popular home remedy for minor throat infections. Biologically active substances in liquorice roots include glycyrrhizic acid (GL; Figure 1) and its aglycone (GA), phenolic compounds, oligosaccharides and polysaccharides, lipids, sterine, and so on. Recently, GL and GA were shown to exert a hepatoprotective effect via modulation of immune-mediated hepatocyte toxicity, NF-\u03baB and IL-10, which explains how their administration resulted in a downregulation of inflammation in the liver [41]. GL has been reported to increase the resistance to Candida albicans and herpes simplex virus-1 infection in animal models [42, 43]. Many researchers have suggested that effects on the production of IFN and Th2 cytokines might be one of the mechanisms involved in the anti-infective process. Recently, glycyrrhizin was found to be active in inhibiting replication of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-associated virus (FFM-1 and FFM-2). In the study, GA was found more effective compared with ribavirin, 6-azauridine, pyrazofurin or mycophenolic acid [44]. GL is also reported to have modulatory effects on the complement system. Reports indicate that GL blocks C5 or a more distal stage of the complement cascade, suggesting that it might have a role in preventing tissue injury not only in chronic hepatitis but also in autoimmune and inflammatory diseases [45].\n",

TC is also reported to inhibit C3-convertase of the classical complement pathway [77]. In a recent study, a polysaccharide (\u03b1-D-glucan) derived from TC resulted in activation of NK cells, complement system, Th1-pathway cytokines, coupled with low nitric oxide synthesis [78]. Antitumour activity of TC was evaluated in cultured HeLa cells and revealed that the effect of extract was comparable and better than doxorubicin treatment.

            "text": "Analysis of current immunomodulating strategies indicates that monovalent approaches in isolation are unlikely to restore immunostasis or attain status of complete therapy (Box 1). This complements emerging systems biology approaches, which holistically monitor operating biological processes as an integrated system. It is likely that multiple immune-modulating strategies will be necessary to achieve clinical success owing to complex interplay between pathways. We need designer drugs, which involve safer, curative and synergistic combinations. Bioprospecting will have a major role in identifying such combinations. The botanical immunodrugs discussed here have such potential because they offer additional therapeutic benefits to address associated conditions such as infection, inflammation and cancer. Botanical extracts provide cytoprotective, anticancer, anti-inflammatory and anti-infective activities in addition to immunoregulatory activity. For example, crude extract of TC has immunostimulant, anticancer and cytoprotective activities, where cytoprotective activities are attributed to polysaccharides and immunostimulant activity is attributed to diterpenoids [76]. Recently, researchers observed antimicrobial activity coupled with immune modulation [80]. Bryostatins isolated from the marine organism Bugula neritina have antineoplastic activity along with mimicking the effect of recombinant human GM-CSF [81]. Three polysaccharides (krestin, lentinan and scihzophyllum) developed by Japanese scientists from mushrooms are in clinical use as adjuvants in chemotherapy. These polysaccharides have now been developed into multipurpose medicines with cytostatic, anti-inflammatory and antithrombotic activities [82]. Similarly, polysaccharides and oxygenated triterpenoids derived from Ganoderma lucidum (a fungus from traditional Chinese medicine) showed broad spectrum pharmacological functions [83]. These examples underline the importance of bioprospecting for newer synergistic combinations and pharmacological agents. Although many researchers have studied synergism and antagonism in botanicals, systematic scientific investigations on pharmacodynamics, kinetics, dosing and interactions are required. Traditional knowledge, particularly from the great traditions of, for example, Ayurveda and China, will have an important role in bioprospecting. Rasayanas are a selected class of botanicals from Ayurveda with putative capabilities to rejuvenate, promote longevity and health (Box 2). A golden triangle1\n, with the integration of modern medicine, traditional knowledge and the robust use of science and technologies with a systems biology approach, could open up new opportunities for immunodrugs and therapy (Figure 2) [84].\nBOX 1Immunotherapy scenario\n(i)Host immune response can be modulated for clinical benefit.(ii)Monovalent therapeutic approaches might not be effective.(iii)Combination approaches offer synergistic efficacy and safety.(iv)Cytokine therapy remains to be optimized.\nBOX 2Ayurveda and RasayanaAyurveda means science of life in Sanskrit (Ayur means life; veda means science) and aims at the holistic management of health and disease. It remains one of the most ancient medical systems widely practiced in the Indian subcontinent and has a sound philosophical, experiential and experimental basis. Charak samhita and Sushrut Samhita (100-500 BC) are main Ayurvedic classics, which describe over 700 botanicals along with their classification, pharmacological and therapeutic properties.Rasayana therapy is one of the eight branches of Ayurveda and generally means nourishing and rejuvenating drugs with multiple applications for longevity, memory enhancement, immunomodulation and adaptogenic. Many researchers have supposed neuroendocrine immune axis theory to explain Rasayana action.",
