Induction of anaesthesia can be distressing both for the child and their parents. Although children can be given drugs to sedate them when anaesthesia is being induced, those drugs can have unwanted harmful effects such as possible airway obstruction and behaviour changes after the operation. A range of nonpharmacological interventions have been used to reduce peri-operative distress and encourage co-operation in children. These fall into four main groups: psychological (cognitive or behavioural), environmental, equipment modification, and social interventions including communication.",

In children undergoing hypnosis, there was a nonsignificant trend towards reduced anxiety during induction compared with midazolam in one trial. A low sensory environment improved children's co-operation at induction (RR, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.45\u20130.95), again in one trial only, and no effect on children's anxiety was found for music therapy (one trial).",

Only one trial met the inclusion criteria, and found insufficient evidence to recommend garlic supplements as a preventative or treatment option for the common cold. The small trial suggests that garlic might reduce the frequency of symptoms of the common cold if taken continuously as a daily prophylactic, but the results require validation. Anecdotally, adverse events reported include odour and minor skin or respiratory irritation, but the frequency of adverse effects could not be determined from the evidence available.",
