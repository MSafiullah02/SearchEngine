The results give insight into variations in the underlying mechanisms as a function of the substitution pattern. This is of interest for the mechanisms of inhibition of the SARS coronavirus main protease (SARS-CoV M pro ) by etacrynic acid derivatives as well as for the excess toxicity of substituted a,b-unsaturated carbonyl compounds. This study compares possible reaction courses including 1,4-addition followed by a ketonization step, and underscores the importance of a base-catalyzed step for the reactivity of thiol groups in enzymes. Phenyl and methyl substituents at the Mi-chael system decrease the reactivity of the electrophilic compound, but chlorophenyl substituents partly recover the reactivity. Computations also indicate that electron-pushing substituents lead to a change in the reaction mechanism. The conformation of the Michael system is also found to significantly influence reactivity: the s-cis conformation leads to higher reactivity than the s-trans conformation. The computed data explain the trends in measured inhibition potencies of substituted a,b-unsaturated carbonyl compounds and of reaction rates in chemical assays. They also indicate that the reversibility of inhibition does not stand in contrast to the formation of a new covalent bond between inhibitor and protease. is the distinction between effects that influence the reversible versus the irreversible step. The former is influenced by noncovalent interactions between inhibitor and enzyme. The latter may also be influenced by such effects, as they may orient the inhibitor in the right arrangement. However, it also relies on the chemical reactivity of the electrophilic warhead which is influenced by substituent effects. Such information can be provided by chemoassays. To elucidate such effects for the inhibition potency of three-membered heterocycles we employed a thiophenol assay. It proved to be a good model for the active site of cysteine proteases, as it represents a rather acidic thiol (pK a = 7.4-7.8) with half the concentration being deprotonated at the pH used (pH 7.6). [13c,d] In the work reported herein this assay was applied to gain insight into the reactivity of the studied etacrynic acid derivatives. To analyze the inherent reactivity of electrophiles against thiol-containing enzymes Schultz and co-workers [14] and Sch\u00fc\u00fcrmann and co-workers [15] developed assays based on glutathione. They were employed to quantify the electrophilic reactivity of S N 2 electrophiles such as aliphatic, allylic, and benzylic halides as well as a-halogenated carbonyls.

Thus, they predict an irreversible inhibition of thiol-containing enzymes by inhibitors containing such electrophiles as warheads. However, the theoretical model systems used completely neglected solvent effects and did not consider substituent effects. Additionally, they assumed the attack of a negatively charged thiolate moiety, while the catalytic active cysteine residue within the SARS-CoV M pro [18] or other enzymes represents a neutral thiol.

[19] The first step consists of the formation of a noncovalent enzyme-inhibitor complex (EI). Within this complex, the attacking enzyme moiety is oriented in such a way that the covalent bond (E\u00c0I) can be formed, e.g., by attack of a nucleophilic center of the enzyme at the electrophilic center of the inhibitor. The resulting reaction represents the second step of the overall inhibition. Within this step the bond formation is mainly influenced by enthalpic effects, as all entropic contributions which are associated with the formation of the enzyme-inhibitor complex are already included in the first step. [13a] Furthermore, entropy effects are quite uniform for similar reactions and hence do not change the relative trends.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 108, "end": 112, "text": "[19]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 720, "end": 725, "text": "[13a]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Model systems"}, {"text": "The work presented herein focuses on the second step. In the present context it involves the formation of a covalent bond between a thiol residue (e.g., of the cysteine residue of the SARS-CoV M pro ) and the electrophilic building block of the inhibitor. Models that aim to describe this step in all details must account for the influence of the protein and the solvent environment. This can be achieved with quantum mechanical/ molecular modeling (QM/MM) approaches that take enzyme and solvent explicitly into account. They are even able to describe effects such as regio-or stereoselectivity of the inhibition process. [20] However, as shown recently by investigations into the inhibition of papain-like proteases, [13] valuable insights into the influence of the substitution pattern of the warhead are already possible from simpler models. These mimic all important parts of the considered system by truncated model compounds in combination with a continuum model such as COSMO. [21] These models approximate the cysteine residue by a methyl thiolate, while the environment is modeled either by two water molecules (pK s % 15) to mimic a low proton-donating ability of the environment, or by two ammonium ions (pK s % 9.3) to simulate a higher proton-donating ability. These explicit solvent molecules were employed in combination with the continuum model COSMO which accounts for the overall polarizability of the solvent and the protein environment. From the inhibitor, only the electrophilic warhead and its directly attached substituents were taken into account. Informa-Scheme 1.

Because such approaches are considerably less expensive than QM/MM computations they allowed a scan of a large number of substituents to test changes in the inhibition potencies of epoxides and aziridines. Such model calculations are also important to distinguish between influences of the enzyme environment and inherent effects resulting from the electronic structure of the inhibitor itself. That the prediction of the computations could be proven experimentally underscores the reliability of the simple approach. [13] To transfer such models to the situation in thiol-containing enzymes in reaction with etacrynic acid derivatives, the following approximations were adopted (see Figure 2 ). The thiol-containing residue of the enzyme is mimicked by methyl thiol. Possible proton-accepting groups (e.g., the histidine residue of the SARS-CoV M pro ) are assumed to play the role of the proton acceptor in the base-catalyzed process. To evaluate the importance of base catalysis, such groups are modeled by an ammonia molecule, which has been shown to be a good approximation. [13] This is shown by comparison between simpler QM [13a,b] and more elaborate QM/MM [20a] approaches.

For the reactions under physiological conditions, thiols are present in protonated (R-SH) and deprotonated (R-S \u00c0 ) form, but as discussed below, only the reactivity of the thiolate seems to be sufficiently high for an efficient attack at the a,b-unsaturated carbonyl moiety. Hence, the proton must be transferred to a proton acceptor, that is, a base-catalyzed reaction has to take place. For the resulting thiolate the reaction can proceed along two pathways. In the direct addition mechanism the thiolate attacks C3 ( Figure 2 ) and at the same time the proton is transferred from the base to C2 (direct E2-like addition). If the proton is instead transferred to the carbonyl oxygen atom, the enol form of the 1,4-addition is obtained. A comparison between both pathways was computationally performed by Weinstein and co-workers, [22] who studied the addition of ammonia to a,b-unsaturated carbonyl compounds. They computed a direct addition as well as the 1,4-addition. However, they did not consider the base-catalyzed reactions discussed in Figure 2 . In contrast, for the direct addition they assumed an intermolecular proton transfer from the ammonium group to C2. For the 1,4-addition an intramolecular proton transfer from the nitrogen atom to the carbonyl oxygen was considered. They found that in such cases the 1,4-addition is favored over direct addition. Both reactions are catalyzed by a single water molecule, but 1,4-addition remains the favorable reaction course. For acrolein the barrier of the 1,4-addition is 70 kJ mol \u00c01 lower than the corresponding barrier of the direct addition (96 kJ mol \u00c01 vs. 27 kJ mol \u00c01 ). For acrylic acid the difference is only~5 kJmol \u00c01 (59 kJ mol \u00c01 vs. 54 kJ mol \u00c01 ), but the 1,4-addition is still favored.

In the studies mentioned above the influence of possible barriers of this step was not considered. Experimentally, the barrier of the acid-catalyzed ketonization of acetone enol in water was determined to DH 0\u00b0= 40 kJ mol \u00c01 . The energy difference between the enol and the keto form was measured to DH 0 = \u00c043 kJ mol \u00c01 . [24] Comparison with gas-phase data show that DH 0 depends little on the surroundings, but the actual course of the reaction and the kinetics are strongly influenced. [25] Recent computations reveal that the barrier of the ketonization strongly depends on the nature of a water bridge, which facilitates the proton transfer. If the bridge consists of three water molecules the computed barrier height is~73 kJ mol \u00c01 , while a value of > 210 kJ mol \u00c01 is computed for the direct transfer. A similar value was also computed by Lien and co-workers. [26] If more than three water molecules are added, the water bridge is solvated itself and the barrier increases again. Notably, the computations did not consider proton catalysis. Further work also showed that in some cases the energy differences be-tween keto and enol forms depend on the molecular structure of the solvent. [27] Due to the strong dependence on the actual number of water molecules, computation of the activation energy for this complicated process is too involved for the goal of the present work which is to study the influence of various substitution patterns.

In both compounds the s-cis or s-trans conformation of the Michael system is fixed by a bicyclic structure. However, in contrast to compound 10, no reaction with the thiophenol was detected for 11. Even after two days the starting material was still present in almost full amount. The results of all NMR test series are summarized in Table 3 , which also contains data reported by Schultz et al. [14] Discussion The data measured in the present work are collected in Table 3 together with some selected values reported by Schultz and colleagues. [14] Further experimental data are available from the work of Sch\u00fc\u00fcrmann and co-workers [15] and from the studies of Schultz et al. [14] An understanding of the relationships between molecular structure and the reactivity against thiols is important for the comprehension of excess toxicity of a,b-unsaturated carboxylic derivates and the development of inhibitors of cysteine-containing proteases. To achieve such an understanding a comparison of the experimental and computed data ( Table 1) was performed. Furthermore, this comparison provides information about whether the chosen theoretical According to our computations an alkyl substitution at C3 increases the reaction barrier of the addition step to the enol form (+ 15 kJ mol \u00c01 ) and also shifts the enolate intermediate to higher energies (+ 16 kJ mol \u00c01 ). This is reflected in the measured decrease of the turnover found in going from compound 13 to 12 (Table 3) . This trend is also manifested in the work of Sch\u00fc\u00fcrmann and co-workers in two examples. [15] Comparing 2-cyclopentene-1-one and 2-methyl-2-cyclopenten-1one, the RC 50 values increase from 0.58 to 8.40, and in going from methyl acrylate to methyl methacrylate, the value increases from 0.42 to 74.1. Similar trends are also reported by Schultz et al. [14] As a second trend our computations predict that a terminal alkyl substituent (3 vs. 9) will decrease the reactivity of the a,b-unsaturated carbonyl compound again, as both the barrier of the addition (+ 27 kJ mol \u00c01 ) and the relative energy of the enolate (+ 21 kJ mol \u00c01 ) increase. This finding explains the decrease in the RC 50 values going from 1-pentene-3-one to 4hexene-3-one. [15] A similar effect is also described by Schultz et al., [14] who observed that a methyl substitution at the olefin moiety decreases activity.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 475, "end": 479, "text": "[14]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 625, "end": 629, "text": "[14]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 713, "end": 717, "text": "[15]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 757, "end": 761, "text": "[14]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1642, "end": 1646, "text": "[15]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1904, "end": 1908, "text": "[14]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2294, "end": 2298, "text": "[15]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2353, "end": 2357, "text": "[14]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 413, "end": 420, "text": "Table 3", "ref_id": "TABREF2"}, {"start": 546, "end": 553, "text": "Table 3", "ref_id": "TABREF2"}, {"start": 1110, "end": 1118, "text": "Table 1)", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}, {"start": 1542, "end": 1551, "text": "(Table 3)", "ref_id": "TABREF2"}], "section": "Experimental Results"}, {"text": "The well-known experience that aldehydes are more reactive than the corresponding ketones is reflected in the difference computed between compounds 1 and 2. It is also reflected in the investigations of Schultz et al. [14] Another important finding of our computations is the prediction that derivatives of a,bunsaturated carboxylic esters are less reactive, because the ketonization step is so strongly hampered that a direct addition may take place. This is in line with the explanation provided by Miyata et al. [30] for stereospecific nucleophilic additions of thiols to derivatives of a,b-unsaturated carboxylic acids. An experimental proof of the predicted decrease in reactivity is given by Sch\u00fc\u00fcrmann and colleagues.

Compounds 10 and 11 were synthesized to prove this prediction experimentally. Indeed, as expected, 10 is very reactive. However, for 11 no reaction takes place. The computations explain the astonishing stability of 11 through very high energy barriers for the ketonization step. Because the addition leading to the enol is strongly endothermic, no reaction will take place. That our model can explain even this unexpected behavior indicates that it does indeed capture the main aspects that govern the reactivity of a,b-unsaturated carbonyl compounds with respect to thiol-containing enzymes. Experimental inhibition assays for SARS-CoV M pro and related enzymes show that some agents inhibit the thiol-containing enzymes irreversibly, whereas for others only reversible inhibition is observed. This is surprising, as all agents possess a,b-unsaturated carbonyl derivatives as electrophilic warheads. For this unexpected finding our investigations provide two possible explanations. In some cases, for example, compound 5 or 9, the reaction energy is estimated to be only~30 kJ mol \u00c01 . In such cases the reverse reaction is much slower than the forward reaction but may still occur. In other cases the reaction energies are sufficiently high to impede any reverse reaction. But also in such cases a reversible inhibition may occur because complicated multistep inhibition mechanisms must occur to reach the final keto form. For all compounds, base catalysis is necessary since only the thiolate is sufficiently reactive for the addition. In most cases, the second step consists of a 1,4-addition leading to the enol intermediate. The final keto form is then obtained through a ketonization of the enol form. This ketonization, as shown in previous investigations, is only possible if the necessary proton transfer is catalyzed by an efficient water bridge, for example. Because such catalysis cannot take place in the active site of many enzymes, the reaction might get stuck at the enol intermediate. Alternatively, if no proton donor is available the reaction might become stuck in an enolate intermediate, which is strongly stabilized by available oxyanion holes. In such cases our computations predict considerably smaller reaction energies. Hence the reverse reaction can take place easily, and only reversible inhibition is observed. Particularly for derivatives of a,b-unsaturated carboxylic acids the enol form is so high in energy that a direct addition to the olefinic double bond becomes more favorable than 1,4addition. For direct addition an efficient proton donor is necessary because the reaction proceeds in an E2-like manner. However, as shown by various Protein Data Bank (PDB) structures, this role could be played by histidine residues, which would also serve as the base in the first step of the overall reaction. Therefore, providing that a histidine residue can serve as an acceptor and donor and that the electronic structure of the warhead steers the reaction toward direct addition, the keto form can be reached without the ketonization process. Only in such cases is an irreversible inhibition found. In other cases the reaction proceeds only up to the enolate form and only reversible inhibition is observed. According to our computations such a direct addition is more favorable for a,b-unsaturated carboxylic esters as provided in AG7088. [7] For alkyl or phenyl substituents the 1,4-addition is predicted to be more favorable. In line with this finding, AG7088 performs an irreversible inhibition of the picornavirus 3C protease, [7] whereas agents including alkyl or phenyl substituents indeed inhibit the SARS-CoV M pro reversibly.
