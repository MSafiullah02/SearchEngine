            "text": "New infectious diseases continue to emerge and old ones have re-emerged in recent decades. Often these events begin and take root in developing countries. Infectious diseases of the developing world or emerging infections are defined by the Institute of Medicine as an infectious disease that has come to medical attention within the past two decades, or for which there is a potential that its prevalence will increase in the near future. Frequently, these diseases exist in nature as zoonoses and cross over to humans when people come into contact with formerly isolated animal population, such as monkeys in a rain forest that become less isolated with deforestation. Drug resistant organisms may also be considered as emerging infections since they result from human influence. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), Ebola virus, hantavirus pulmonary syndrome, monkey pox and multidrug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MDR-TB), Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) associated coronavirus and avian influenza are examples of emerging infections. Many of these infections have arisen and become major health issues in the developing world, in part due to selection factors as noted above. Additionally, inadequate resource for public health surveillance and treatment of these illnesses plus poor sanitation and nutritional status may contribute to their flourishing. Once established, these illnesses then pose concerns for all mankind as we have truly become a global community. For these same reasons even common infections such as rotavirus gastrointestinal infection or respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) exert a greater toll in the developing world. Thus, even as molecular biology advances approaches to diagnoses, new challenges to prevention and treatment of infectious diseases continue to emerge. Through a discussion of avian influenza and MDR-TB, primarily, we will demonstrate the magnitude of the problems of infectious diseases in the developing world and discuss approaches that can be taken to in an attempt to monitor and contain these new threats as they emerge.",

Moxifloxacin has a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) against M. tuberculosis fourfold lower than levofloxacin, a second-generation fluoroquinolone already in use for MDR-TB. (Older fluoroquinolones like levofloxacin and ofloxacin are only used for MDR-TB treatment because of initial studies showing lack of superiority to existing first-line drugs.) It also has a long half-life and high area under the curve concentration. A murine model study found that substituting moxifloxacin for isoniazid decreased the overall time necessary for TB eradication by two months. Moxifloxacin is currently in four different Phase II trials in eight countries \u2013 Brazil, Canada, South Africa, Spain, Tanzania, Uganda, the United States, and Zambia, with a goal of demonstrating efficacy as a first-line component of a shorter, standardized TB treatment regimen. The hypothesis is that moxifloxacin substitution for isoniazid or ethambutol in the usual four drug standard regimen (isoniazid, rifampin, ethambutol, and pyrazinamide) during the first two months of treatment will significantly increase the proportion of patients with culture-negative sputum at 8 weeks, compared with the standard regimen. Phase II trials, are expected to complete in 2007, with Phase III trials to follow. Moxifloxacin metabolism also does not utilize the hepatic cytochrome P-450 system, and does not lead to adverse reactions when taken alongside ARVs. However, one recent study in Italy found that 12/38 patients treated with long-term moxifloxacin for TB developed adverse reactions. None of the reactions was irreversible or fatal, and moxifloxacin was felt to be safe and result in treatment success in 31/38 patients. The success rate was only 5/14 in MDR-TB patients [14].\n",

It attacks the mycobacteria in both the initial, intensive phase of TB therapy, as well as the later, continuation phase.

PA-824 also has activity against both actively replicating and the static, slow growing mycobacteria. This has the potential for shortening the course of therapy, since many current drugs are only active against actively replicating mycobacteria, and M. tuberculosis spends weeks to months in its static, slow-growing phase. In a murine model, PA-824 was more potent than rifampin when used in combination with moxifloxacin and pyrazinamide, and that when all four drugs were used together, the duration of treatment could be reduced to 3 months or less [20]. PA-824 successfully completed a phase I clinical trial in the U.S. in August 2005, and a phase II trial is planned for later in 2006, ending in 2008.",

BCG is known to stimulate Th1 immune cells, which leads to the development of protective antibody and drives M. tuberculosis into latency in the body. In many areas of the developing world, parasitic helminthic infections are extremely common. Parasites stimulate a Th2 immune cell response, usually associated with an allergic response. This increase in background Th2 response is antagonistic to the Th1 cell response, and, in theory, will blunt or lead to an inadequate immune, as well as cause impaired bactericidal activity [25].",

MVA85A completed a Phase I clinical trial in the United Kingdom in 2004. When given with BCG, Th1 levels were upto 30-fold higher than groups given MVA85A or BCG alone [26]. Further clinical trials in the United Kingdom and Gambia are in progress. Another vaccine, Mtb72F/AS02A consisting of a recombinant fusion protein (Mtb72F) formulated in a proprietary adjuvant system (AS02A) has shown promising results in preclinical studies to induce strong, long lasting cellular and humoral immune responses. In addition, the vaccine has shown a good safety and immunogenicity profile in Phase I trials. Phase II trials are planned to being shortly [27]. Even with concerns with the potential efficacy of a vaccine, there may still be a role for its use. Combining the use of a vaccine with antituberculosis drugs seems to augment the bactericidal activity of the drugs, particularly with regard to the slow-growing mycobacteria [21].",

Currently, it is the developing world which is most affected by both of these infections; yet, the drugs and vaccines are not being optimized for these areas. Drug regimens need to be shorter and simpler, not only to make them affordable to the population at risk but also to prevent the development of drug resistance. Vaccines of more widespread efficacy are also needed to protect as well as prevent these infections from becoming global epidemics. Hopefully, this review has demonstrated the impact for all mankind of emerging infections in the developing world and will stimulate ongoing development of approaches aimed at addressing these issues for the people affected, and for the entire world.",
