For instance, primary prevention in food safety would involve the removal of chemical, physical or biological hazards from food before it is consumed. This includes the establishment of herd health programs for food animals, provision of safe feed, monitoring antibiotic use in animals, physical control mechanisms such as abattoir inspections and milk pasteurization, and the development and enforcement of food safety standards. Secondary prevention may include mechanisms for early health system response to food-borne disease outbreaks, institutional capacity to conduct timely food-borne illness outbreak investigations, food product recalls, destruction of contaminated produce or quarantine of implicated markets, farms, or animals to contain outbreaks. Tertiary prevention includes the appropriate treatment of food-borne illnesses, such as administering the correct medication to treat zoonotic tuberculosis. This prevention framework does not easily accommodate the roles that multiple stakeholders play in disease prevention, particularly those stakeholders that lie outside traditional food safety and health systems, but still impact the social determinants of health.20 Logically, this begs the question; how can multiple stakeholder interests and influences be incorporated in this basic prevention framework?",

In the epidemiological framework for disease control and public health in food safety, a risk based framework considers multiple risk factors along the food supply chain, from farm to fork, and the holistic impact of stakeholders on food safety and food-borne disease management. However, the concept of risk and its understanding is highly contextual, as our case studies will demonstrate. Risk is socially constructed. Therefore, risk identification and assessment are both innately human and dependent upon social activities that generate meaning. In other words, risk perception is contingent upon a shared understanding of reality.21\n",

Paradoxically, one of the reasons for the difficulty to use science to inform policy on risk is scientific limitation to only the objective assessments of risk.23 As Stirling and Scoones24 contend in their 2009 paper on risk assessment and knowledge mapping, scientific assessments of risk often attempt to aggregate complex social and biological phenomena into a set of probabilities and outcomes, thereby often structuring the phenomena to become policy, rather than inform it.

Conceptually, the integration of the socio-political structures of disease risk and risk management should provide a useful framework for understanding food safety, disease prevention and public health in the African region. In other words, to be useful, an epidemiological framework for disease control and public health in food safety needs to be inclusive and open to multiple perspectives of African food safety problems. In order to succeed, it is important to properly frame food safety problems, and identify the different stakeholders involved along the food chain. Additionally, it is crucial to recognize the various stakeholders\u2019 roles and capacity for risk facilitation or management, as influenced by their institutional norms, priorities and ideas. The goal is to develop a consensual view of risk.

In turn, food-borne diseases remain a significant problem for the region, given its high levels of poverty and urgent nutritional needs for its most vulnerable citizens. As highlighted in the introductory section, food-borne diseases are frequently reported in Africa, with high incidence. Most cases of food-borne diseases remain unreported. There are several factors responsible for this. In many countries in the region, there is the existence of poor food safety surveillance systems and weak obligatory reporting mechanisms for food-borne disease outbreaks, outside high profile diseases such as cholera. Reporting is also inaccurate in some cases, with only a handful of countries reporting incidence of food-borne illnesses. These knowledge gaps mean that an accurate picture of incidence is nonexistent, which limits our understanding of the public health impact of food-borne diseases in the region.",

In many developing country settings, policy actors are forced to balance the external desires of funding agencies and international bodies as well as contend with internal power struggles.31 Therefore, a hindrance to the management of risk in food safety in the African region is its dependence on development partners. External partners play a key role in defining national development agendas, by focusing their support on water delivery, primary healthcare, or particular infectious diseases such as tuberculosis, HIV and malaria. The dependence on development partners and the politics of aid has implications for the capacity of African countries to control the focus of funding.32 The assistance provided by donors towards food safety may not foster ownership among local stakeholders, given that the focus is donor driven and not aligned with existing needs and local realities.33 In addition, the WHO states that development partners are not always willing to commit to sustaining the strengthening of food safety management systems.",

Many of the laws governing food safety are outdated, inadequate or fragmented.35 The provisions relating to animal health, for instance, can be found in multiple statutes, codes and standards (both legal and voluntary), which spurs institutional rivalries and blurs the boundaries of responsibility. There is inadequate protection of consumers from contaminated food products, fraudulent practices and the importation of substandard food for domestic markets.36 Furthermore, enforcement of food law remains an important concern.

The study further states that this discord has led to the rejection of food exports from the region.42 Such complex phenomena, however, cannot be treated as mere events, but should be considered institutionally embedded processes with distinct histories that need to be uncovered to help illuminate more general problems,43 especially where many countries in the region face several non-tariff barriers that limit their ability to export their produce. These include Sanitary and Phytosanitary (SPS) requirements, technical barriers to trade, quotas, and market standards, restrictive rules of origin and complex tariff structures and import requirements.44 The enforcement of import controls and inspections is also problematic for most governments, which presents the risk of importing unsafe and substandard food and food products.45 A report46 on Zambia, for example, argues that European Union (EU) and United States of America SPS standards are \u201cdynamic\u201d and have resulted in the rejection of Zambian goods at ports of entry.

In its Terrestrial Animal Health Code, the OIE lists international animal health standards that are the basis for facilitating safe trade in animals and animal products, standards that are recognized under the Sanitary and Phytosanitary (SPS) Agreement of the WTO.56 Countries that are involved in animal and animal product trade are expected to comply with the SPS Agreement in order to reap the full benefits of international trade.57 The SPS Agreement states that public health measures to ensure food safety and to control plant or animal diseases should be based, as far as appropriate, on international standards.58 In addition, the SPS Agreement sets forth that measures to protect public health, animal health and plant health should only minimally interfere with trade. On issues of food safety, however, it must be noted that produce from developing countries, particularly those from the African region, cannot easily enter the more lucrative Western markets.

There is a paucity of data on the prevalence of BTB in cattle, a lack of species differentiation of human TB isolates and the presence of significant wildlife reservoirs.91 The epidemiology of the condition in cattle is as follows: A vast majority of cattle excrete M. bovis almost from the inception of a lesion.92 However, it is still not fully understood to what extent tuberculosis latency exists in cattle and the associated problems of this potential source of infection. BTB will persist in cattle as long as the bovine host lives.93 A single bacillus that becomes aerosolized is sufficient to establish infection, droplet size being more important than number of bacilli.94 With droplet nuclei as a vector, animals do not need to be in close contact with a tuberculosis disseminator to become infected.95 We must cross reference this scientific fact with the social role that cattle play in African rural culture and livelihood i.e. not as a source of food, but a status symbol.

As a result, in December 1997, total and rapid depopulation of all poultry in markets and chicken farms in Hong Kong was carried out to control the outbreak, a move that both policy and virology experts believed had averted a potential human pandemic.158 Arguably, live poultry markets were important in the transmission of the H5N1 virus to other avian species and humans during these outbreaks.159 The control measures instituted, i.e. the total culling of all farmed chickens and all poultry in markets in Hong Kong, appeared effective, as the responsible genotype of H5N1 (A/goose/Guangdong/1/96) has not been reported since the execution of these controls.160 However in February 2003, during the SARS epidemic, and after a 6-year hiatus, three more human H5N1 infections with two fatalities were identified in China.

The perception of policy makers, however, reflected their institutional standpoints. For example, stakeholders from the Ministry of Health viewed it as a pandemic concern and a potential triage strain for the health system should human infections occur. The Agricultural Ministry, represented by the veterinary department, viewed it as an exotic poultry problem with the potential for zoonotic transmission. It was also viewed as likely to emerge from poor poultry producers with no knowledge of biosecurity.

The BTB case study presented a twofold risk to communities living in and around the livestock interface. First, there is a public health risk from the consumption of uninspected meat from lechwe, a wildlife species known to be a maintenance host for BTB, and second, there is the major risk from consumption of unpasteurized milk derived from tuberculosis positive herds. Milk, as previously stated, is known to be the primary means of zoonotic conveyance to humans. Of course there are other risks of acquiring BTB in this area, including aerosols from cattle with active tuberculosis lesions in their lungs, during the evisceration of infected cattle or lechwe carcasses and during the consumption of undercooked meat contaminated with Mycobacterium bovis.

Although meat inspection is not very sensitive and up to 60 % of discrete tuberculosis lesions may go undetected,241 it is still necessary to mitigate the food safety risks to public health in rural livestock keeping communities such as those found in Zambia\u2019s wildlife-livestock interface. The difficulty in controlling the condition in lechwe means that the disease is unlikely to be eliminated in cattle. Food hygiene thus seems to be the primary prevention mechanism available for food governance stakeholders in the area.

In the case of bovine tuberculosis, there is an apparent lack of understanding for the need for its control in rural populations, despite the myriad studies demonstrating the risk to humans living in contact with infected wildlife and livestock. Some of the reasons, presumably, are based on larger health problems (human tuberculosis and HIV/AIDS), an absence of veterinary support, and a wildlife management system that is incognizant of the risks to public health. In the case of H5N1, there was no real local risk, but international interest and finance pushed its importance up the government agenda. Outside Egypt and Nigeria, the African countries that had been most impacted by H5N1, other countries in the region responded to the avian and pandemic influenza more or less because of international finance. In areas where H5N1 was a problem, there were notable food security repercussions. For example, in Nigeria, a ban in poultry and poultry product movement resulted in those regions with low poultry production unable to obtain poultry and poultry meat from the high poultry producing areas. The impact was the reduced availability of the cheapest and commonest source of protein for low-income consumers.245\n",

This knowledge, however, is not a guarantee for the adequate address of food safety on national governmental agendas. It must be understood that food governance policy coherence is not a state, but a process. It is a bargained \u2018collective\u2019 construct, requiring a level of oversight, coordination and consensus among actors for whom coherence is relevant.246 Therefore, considerable advocacy and policy entrepreneurship is required to garner the necessary support for food safety reform both in the African region and with the international donor community. Furthermore, it is difficult to develop a coordinated and sustainable approach to the holistic management of food safety in the African region, especially when the impact of food safety on public health and the general economy have not been adequately assessed. Therefore, while important, getting the various stakeholder institutions to understand the public health benefits of coordinated and improved food safety mechanisms remains a fundamental challenge. This is because, as alluded to earlier, modern polity is fragmented as a matter of necessity.

It is also important to keep in mind what they perceive the risks to be, and how their definitions fit into the broad picture of food safety in general. Certainly, the application and utility of the disease prevention framework presented in the conceptual section of this paper would be greatly advanced. However, because disease control is highly politicized, a more inclusive approach is required to use evidence to support responses to global disease concerns aligned with local priorities and realities.251 As in the case of general disease control, food safety governance requires the right questions to be raised to foster the socio-political and economic change that the international community expects from the African region.252 As one study argues,253 the process of instituting change cannot remain the \u201cpurview of the global North, especially when the questions asked, and the responses advocated, favor a Northern perspective of globalized risk over the \u2018real\u2019 needs of the global South.\u201d Context will always matter and therefore, local ecological, biological and policy considerations should be given primacy.
