However, false negative in nucleic acid detection has been reported, and the clinical symptoms may be atypical that may cause misdiagnosis and make the situation spread. Therefore, the imaging examination becomes particularly important. In this study, the CT images of 130 patients diagnosed as COVID-19 pneumonia were collected and their imaging features were analyzed. The NCP was classified for the first time according to its distribution characteristics and the CT signs were further interpreted from the perspectives of anatomy, pathophysiology, and immunity, in order to improve the radiologists\u2019 familiarity with the disease and help make the early diagnosis and show insights in the development of disease on follow-up CT.",

All the patients underwent thin-slice CT scan. All CT examinations were performed with a 128-section scanner (Siemens, GE, Neusoft) without injecting contrast media. All thin-slice CT images were uploaded through the network and reviewed by three chest radiologists (J.W., J.P., and D.T.) with approximately 5 to 30 years of experience in chest imaging. In cases of discrepant assessment results between the radiologists, images were reviewed independently, and a consensus was established. When radiologists disagreed about a sign, a consensus meeting online was held. The radiation dose for CT scan is 120 kV/30 mA/142 mAs/454.7 mGy\u00b7cm.",

After inhaling the virus into the airway, the large airway is seldom invaded by the virus due to its abundant cilia and strong immune function. The virus mainly invades bronchioles, causing bronchiolitis and peripheral inflammation, and then spreads and invades the lung tissue. On CT image, the early manifestation shows GGO density. The virus mainly invades lung interstitium, conforming to the previous literature [11]. In all cases, we did not see obvious thickening of the bronchovascular bundle and the pleura, so we speculated that the main lung interstitium invaded by the virus was the lobular interstitium. Therefore, the image distribution is mainly classified as follows:Lobular distribution: when the virus causes inflammation in the lobular core, it is easy to form globular GGO, and then quickly diffuses to the surrounding area, forming larger globular GGO or patches of lobular distribution. In follow-up CT images, the lesions expanded to the surrounding area, and the distribution was mostly seen in lung outer zone or in the whole lung; the adjacent lesions can fuse during progression. This is one of the most common distribution patterns of the NCP, that is, nodular or patchy GGO distributed in the lobular core and fused finally.Subpleural distribution: due to the better development of pulmonary lobules in peripheral subpleural region with rich blood flow and lymph, the inflammatory response of lung lobular interstitium is more severe. The NCP mainly invades the bronchioles and distal lung tissue, causing inflammatory lesions mainly in the interstitium; thus, the distribution is mainly in the peripheral subpleural region, which is also one of the most common distribution patterns.Diffuse distribution: the lobular distribution and subpleural distribution can overlap. Meanwhile, they progress and merge into a large high-density shadow, which can affect most areas of the bilateral whole lung, that is, diffuse distribution.",

The lesion will spread to the pleural side and bilateral interlobular septum. Since the distal end is limited by the pleura, the lesion can only cling to the pleura, spread along the reticular structure of the interlobular septum, and diffuse to the periphery. The fusion with subpleural lesions leads to the long axis of the lesions parallel to the pleura.

Bronchiectasis can be found at the later stage, often accompanied by marginal contraction, suggesting that the lesion is at the repair stage caused by fiber traction. Air bronchogram is not specific to COVID-19, but it helps distinguish the virus from other bacterial pneumonia. Bronchiectasis is also very common and not specific to COVID-19, but it helps indicate the progress of the disease.",

This sign has been reported in fungi, vasculitis, and some viruses, the most common one is herpes virus [11], and can also be found in COVID-19. On the contrary, the \u201creversed halo sign\u201d is focal, round, or half-moon shaped, with a GGO area in the center and completely or more than 3/4 surrounded by high-density consolidation, which was first reported in the cryptogenic organizing pneumonia (COP) [16]. This sign can be present in many other diseases such as COP, tuberculosis, vasculitis, lung cancer, and metastasis. The NCP also presented a reversed halo sign. We suggest that the main inflammatory repair is the edge of the lesions, leading to the result that the formation of the edge tends to solid strip shadow while the central repair is relatively delayed.",

We hypothesize that the development of the GGO into consolidation may be due to secondary alveolar pulmonary edema, and tissue organization, and partly combined with bacterial infection. In addition, the absorption of GGO, consolidation, edge contraction and retraction, fiber strips or subpleural line, and bronchiectasis all indicate the organization changes. Both GGO and consolidation exist in the transitional period. In addition, some cases showed dynamic CT signs; that is, some lesions got better while the other lesions became enlarged or new lesions appeared. This may be due to the delayed inflammatory response or organization in part of the lung tissue. Of the 35 patients, 14 patients became aggravated, mainly manifesting in the increased lesion area and number, and the tendency of fusion. In addition, there were 8 cases of \u201cwhite lung\u201d changes in diffuse whole lung, which had a high mortality rate.",

During the follow-up, the distribution of lobular core, the fusion of lesions, and the organization changes at late stage will appear. It has been reported that patients with positive chest CT findings may present with false negative results of nucleic acid examination for COVID-19 [17, 18]. Therefore, patients with negative nucleic acid results but highly suspicious CT signs should also be isolated in time. Furthermore, follow-up X-ray or CT examinations are necessary in a short period of time, and those with highly suspicious clinical and radiological manifestations should have multiple nucleic acid tests.",
