More recent studies have utilised their potential for simultaneous detection of unlimited numbers of pathogens to diagnose infection in a range of sites One such study focused on the rapid diagnosis of bacteraemia by universal amplification of 23S ribosomal DNA (rDNA) followed by hybridisation to an oligonucleotide array (Anthony et al., 2000)). They found that rapid identification and discrimination between bacteria could be achieved, and that adding further oligonucleotides to the panel without increasing significantly the complexity or the cost, could continually extend the accuracy, range and discriminatory power of this assay. A similar conclusion was found in another study which looked at a DNA array to detect bacterial pathogens in environmental samples (Call et al., 2003). Wang et al., 2002, Wang et al., 2004 investigated intestinal bacteria in human faecal samples using 16S rDNA PCR and oligonucleotide microarrays. The sensitivities of the array assay were comparable to classic culture. Chizhikov et al. (2001) developed a microarray targeting sequences from six genes encoding bacterial antigenic determinants and virulence factors to detect enteric pathogens (Salmonella spp, Shigella spp and Escherichia coli). The specificity was superior to culture on the array as identification relied on complementary hybridisation with the oligonucleotide rather than with agarose gel analysis based on the size of the PCR product.",

Extracted sample DNA (5 \u03bcl) was added to each reaction. The hot start PCR cycling conditions were as follows: initial denaturation at 94 \u00b0C for 3 min, followed by 40 cycles of 94 \u00b0C, 30 s; 55 \u00b0C, 30 s; and 72 \u00b0C, 30 s; with a final extension step at 72 \u00b0C for 5 min. A positive and negative control was included in each PCR run. The three PCR reactions for each species were combined and then split equally allowing for duplicate microarrays. PCR products for all species were combined, purified and dried down as described previously. Pellets were reconstituted in 8 \u03bcl 0.1 M Na2CO3 pH 9.0. This was then used to reconstitute a dried pellet of 5 nmol mono-reactive Cy5 N-hydroxysuccinimidyl ester (Amersham Biosciences, Buckinghamshire, UK). This was incubated in the dark for 1 hour at RT and then dried.",

The dried slides were then scanned at 4 \u03bcm resolution with PMT gain of 110 using a LS200 confocal fluorescent scanner (Tecan, Salzburg, Austria) and the images analysed using ArrayPro Analyser version 4.5 (MediaCybernetics) software. Local background signal was subtracted from both the Cy3 reference and Cy5 sample channel, and the net intensity of the fluorescent signal from the sample channel was divided by the net intensity from the control channel for every spot and expressed as a signal ratio value. Ratios of \u2265 0.01 were considered positive. Ratios of \u2265 0.1 were considered strongly positive. These results were then compared to the real-time quantitative PCR results. The specificity of each PCR product probe was assessed by hybridising a 1:1000 dilution of plasmid DNA containing the specific gene for each bacterial species bacterial target to the DNA microarray and checking for cross hybridisation.",

The Cy3 channel signals for each spot, which were generated by hybridisation of reference DNA, standardised the Cy5 channel signals (sample hybridisation) expressed as hybridisation ratios. Regardless of the variations in the amount of DNA spotted on the microarray and spatial variations in the extent of microarray hybridisation, the normalised Cy5 channel signals were then comparable to each other. This standardisation was necessary to avoid errors originating from the probe concentration and spatial variations in hybridisation efficiency. In addition as much replication as possible should be included, not only within a microarray itself, but also in terms of the number of individual slides used per sample.
