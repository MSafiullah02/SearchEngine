Using a sensitive dissociation-enhanced lanthanide fluoroimmunoassay (DELFIA). IFN-a was detected in blood at 8 and 24 h after injection of ADV-infected cells. In parallel, by means of m situ hybridization, IFN-Q//? mRNA containing cells were demonstrated in regional lymph nodes. Occasional IFN-Q//? mRNA positive cells were also seen in injected dermal areas, but not in contralateral lymph nodes, spleen, bone marrow, blood or liver. The ability of leucocytes in whole blood cultures to produce IFN-o upon stimulation by ADV was markedly diminished 3-7 days after intradermal injection of ADV-infected cells. In contrast, cultures of purified peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) had intact IFN-tv responses. Further, serum from ADV-injected pigs inhibited the in vitro ADV-induced IFN-a responses in PBMC from control pigs, most likely due to the demonstrated presence of anti-ADV antibodies. We suggest that the lFN-al0 producing cells in lymph nodes may participate in the development of antiviral immunity and could be equivalent to Natural \\FN-a/0 producing (NIP) cells.",

In humans, these cells lack markers typical of monocytes as well as T and B lymphocytes, but express for instance MHC class II antigens, CD4 and CD36 [4, [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] . They have provisionally been designated natural IFN-a//3 producing cells (NIP cells) [11] . Although the NIP cells have some resemblance to antigen presenting dendritic cells, they have, in one study at least, been separated from such cells [14] . The corresponding cells in pigs, which can be triggered by free or cell-associated transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), a coronavirus. have also been well characterized [15. 16] . The same cell population appears to be stimulated by cells infected by Aujeszky's disease virus (ADV), also termed Pseudorabies virus [17] .",

The IFN mRNA containing cells essentially lined such ADV-PK 15 cell aggregates on the sides facing the cortex, but were also seen deeper in the cortex.

A mean of 109 (range 62-178) IFN-Q mRNA positive cells were detected per whole lymph node section from pigs 11, 12 and 13 ( Table 2 ). The IFN-/J mRNA positive cells were less heavily labelled, fewer in number and had a mean of 28 (range 7-43) positive cells per section. Examination of sections from the contralateral subiliac lymph nodes, sections of spleen and liver or smears of bone marrow or peripheral blood did not reveal any clearly positive IFN-a or IFN-/? mRNA containing cells. Also, similar preparations from the two non-injected control pigs were negative.",

The alterations could refiect IFNinduced effects on PBMC, like distributional changes of leucocytes [19, 35] or priming effects [I]. In contrast, when the leucocytes were tested in whole blood cultures, all animals showed decreased IFN-a responses 7 days p.i. Since it was shown that serum collected from the animals at this time suppressed ADV-induced IFN-a responses of normal PBMC, one or several suppressive serum factors may be involved. Sera from the experimental pigs in the present study had high levels of antibodies to ADV about 1 week after injection of ADV-PK 15 cells. Such antibodies may well be responsible for the suppression, because both polyclonal and certain MoAbs to ADV have been shown to efficiently inhibit the ADV-induced IFN-a response by porcine PBMC in vitro (Artursson et al.., unpublished observations) . Also, antibodies to other viruses can inhibit their interferogenic activity [28. 29. 36 ].",
