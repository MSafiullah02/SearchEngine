As culture-based methods improved and various serologic assays and rapid diagnostics for malaria were made available, researchers began recognizing nonmalarial causes of fever and identified a much wider spectrum of etiologies. Among children, studies of acute febrile illness that used a combination of microbiologic methods identified malaria in 1.3% to 64.4% [\n11\n,\n28\n],\nLeptospira\nspp. in 0.4% to 7.7% [\n11\n,\n29\n],\nRickettsia\nspp. in 0.4% to 7.4% [\n11\n,\n29\n],\nCoxiella\nspp. in 0.1% to 2.6% [\n11\n,\n29\n], and\nBrucella\nspp. in up to 2.0% [\n11\n]. Respiratory viruses, with adenovirus comprising 30%, accounted for >50% of the fevers in an outpatient pediatric study conducted in Tanzania [\n29\n]. Other pathogens identified to be causative agents of acute febrile illness in patients with bloodstream infections include\nMycobacterium avium\ncomplex, which causes 1% of cases [\n30\n],\nSalmonella\nspp. in 0.1% to 19% of cases [\n29\n,\n31\n],\nS pneumoniae\nin 0.1% to 6.5% of cases [\n29\n,\n32\n],\nEscherichia coli\nin 0.1% to 7.2% [\n33\n,\n34\n], and\nStaphylococcus aureus\nin 0.2% to 22.4% [\n35\n,\n36\n]. Among adults, other fungal etiologies of bloodstream infections, such as\nCryptococcus neoformans\n(1.8% to 9% [\n3\n,\n37\n]) and\nHistoplasma capsulatum\n(1.0% [\n38\n]), have been reported.\n",

In Laos, of the 1095 patients with data for hospital antimicrobial use, 56% received an antimicrobial drug, and 12% received more than 1 [\n49\n]. On the basis of final diagnosis, only 7% of these patients were regarded as having been treated appropriately [\n49\n]. Although malaria was the admission diagnosis for 148 adults in Tanzania, 44.8% of them were still prescribed empiric antibacterial agents [\n12\n]. Of those without an admission diagnosis of malaria, 59% were prescribed an antimicrobial agent [\n12\n]. A Rwandan study on malaria hospitalization after implementation of a malaria-control program documented a significant decrease in the risk of high parasitemia after the intervention (80.4% laboratory-confirmed cases in the preintervention period and 48.1% in the postintervention period) [\n95\n]. Antibacterial agents, however, were prescribed to 70.7% of all the children with clinical malaria throughout the study period [\n95\n]. The majority of these studies were conducted in an inpatient setting, which reflects the differing etiologic agents and competing management priorities of outpatient versus inpatient care, where empiric antibacterial treatment for hospitalized patients is justifiable. Rates of multidrug-resistant\nS enterica\nserovar Typhi of up to 80% in southeast Asia [\n101\n] and 70% in east Africa [\n102\n], and substantial antimicrobial resistance of non-Typhi\nSalmonella\n[\n103\n,\n104\n], can be attributed partly to the unnecessary overuse of antimicrobial drugs. This is further complicated by the substandard medicines in circulation in several LMICs, which risks patient safety and may be promote antimicrobial resistance [\n105\u2013107\n], and it may affect the relevance of the WHO's Integrated Management of Childhood Illness guidelines in treating the causes of acute febrile illness.\n",

During a concurrent epidemic of dengue and leptospirosis in an urban center in Brazil in the mid-1990s, patients with leptospirosis who were initially misdiagnosed as having dengue were more likely than other patients to have required admission to the intensive care unit and to have died during hospitalization [\n108\n]. In rural Laos, where dengue accounted for >30% of febrile cases, only 17% of the patients with leptospirosis and 14% with rickettsial infection were treated appropriately with doxycycline [\n76\n]. Dengue was suspected and clinically diagnosed in only 20% of the 81 confirmed dengue cases [\n76\n]. A study that evaluated causes of fever in children in Thailand noted that nonclassical presentations of scrub and murine typhus were often missed or diagnosed as enteric fever [\n51\n], which highlights the importance of recognizing the disease because it affects antimicrobial management. Hence, in resource-limited settings, it is imperative to strike a balance between empirically treating when there are few available diagnostics and noting the need for judicious antibacterial prescribing.\n",

Acute febrile illness is associated with major case fatality ratios; however, the lack of distinguishing clinical features of these infections and obstacles to making the correct diagnoses limit appropriate care. Diagnostic capacity in many LMICs remains limited, and the etiologies in many recent studies were unknown, which impedes our ability to develop effective clinical algorithms or to make informed clinical decisions. In addition, diagnostics remain imperfect tools, as is the case when one cannot obtain both acute and convalescent serologies on a patient and when interpretation is challenging, such as when molecular diagnostics detect pathogens even in asymptomatic controls. In addition, the prevalence of viral etiologies in acute febrile illness is only now being recognized slowly, although it remains poorly documented in many LMICs. As a result of the paucity of data, antimalarial agents are overused (administered in up to 99% of patients with negative smear results in 1 study [\n96\n]), and overtreatment with empiric antibacterial agents also occurs (administered in up to 60% of patients without an admission diagnosis of malaria [\n12\n]).\n",

Similar to research being conducted on pneumonia and diarrhea [\n21\n,\n117\n], comprehensive, standardized, multicenter etiology research is needed to understand the causes of acute febrile illness. An improved understanding of the etiologies of acute febrile illness is critical for developing management algorithms for the appropriate use of antimalarial and antibacterial drugs and essential for monitoring the impact on antimicrobial resistance.\n",
