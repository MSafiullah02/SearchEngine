They are usually small and quadrupedal. Rodents are hindgut fermenters with a predominantly gram-positive gut flora, and most exhibit coprophagic behaviors. They are nocturnal in nature, and certain members of this order, most notably hamsters, may hibernate or aestivate. There are four hypsodontic (open-rooted) incisors in all the species, but the molars are hypsodontic only in the guinea pig. There is a prominent diastoma between the incisors and cheek teeth.",

Gerbils are desert dwellers and have adapted to periods of water deprivation; therefore, they may normally excrete as little as two to three drops of urine per day. Unlike other common pet rodents, guinea pigs have a mandatory need for an extrinsic source of dietary vitamin C. Therefore, although they are similar, the veterinarian should be familiar with a few of the idiosyncratic features of each of these species.",

This structure produces porphyrin secretions that give tears a reddish tinge. If the animal is under duress, the secretions may become evident in the periorbital and perinasal region, causing owners to assume the animal is bleeding. Coagulopathies can exist in rodents (especially if there is any question of exposure to rodenticides); therefore there is good reason to differentiate between blood and porphyrin. Porphyrin pigmentation can be differentiated from blood by exposing it to an ultraviolet light under which conditions the porphyrin exhibits a red fluorescence.",

Because of the prolific nature of these animals, veterinarians are frequently called to provide assistance in population control. Sexing rodents is easily accomplished. Males can be differentiated from females by their increased anogenital distance (\nFigs. 1A and B). It is important to realize that rodents have open inguinal rings and can retract their testes into the abdomen under duress. The rat has a rather pendulous scrotum, and it is not uncommon for owners to assume the testes are abnormal masses. The female rodent has a urethral orifice that is externally distinct from the vaginal opening. This feature allows the clinician to differentiate between a discharge of urinary tract origin and one from the reproductive tract. Rats and mice have extensive mammary tissue that can extend from over the shoulders and caudally to the inguinal region. Pathology of these tissues can occur in either species and in any of these areas.",

First, it is important to ascertain where the pet was obtained. Rodents can be obtained from a variety of sources, including pet stores, professional or nonprofessional breeders, and laboratory animal facilities. It is not unusual to see some of the various immunocompromised animals, including nude mice and rats, infiltrating the pet population. Additionally, ask who the primary owner is and how long he or she has owned the animal. Many educational facilities, including preschools and elementary schools, maintain small rodents in their classrooms, and many children have rodents as their first pets. If a child owns the pet, it may be important to ascertain who is responsible for the care of the animal. Without adult oversight, young people may not be mature enough to ensure proper care of the animal.",

Guinea pigs are incapable of synthesis of vitamin C because of an inability to produce L-gulono-gamma-lactone oxidase, the enzyme that converts glucose to ascorbic acid. Vitamin C must be supplied in the guinea pig\u2019s diet, and deficiencies may be seen in animals fed outdated store-bought food. Therefore, it is not only necessary to identify the diet but also its source. It is unusual for the owner to know the milling date of the diets, and this would be the most useful information. Most conventional guinea pig diets only supply adequate levels of vitamin C when used within 3 months of their milling date. Some formulations are becoming available that may be adequate for 6 months past their milling date. If the owner supplies any dietary supplementation, this should be noted. Owners may be reluctant to divulge this information, yet in many cases they may be actually providing necessary nutrients by unconventional food items.

Although many of these small pets are quite tractable, they may become agitated when restrained. The guinea pig is extremely docile and tends to either freeze or circle when handling is attempted. This animal may be restrained by simply placing it on a table facing the examiner with the owner placing one hand on the rump to prevent the animal from backing up. Hamsters have a reputation for being pugnacious and may require more restraint. They are generally restrained with the scruff technique. It is important to realize that hamsters have extensive cheek pouches and if not adequately scruffed, can turn on the examiner and inflict damage. Many pet rats and mice need only be held on a cloth-covered table while being examined. However, if they are somewhat obstreperous, mice can be scruffed (\nFig. 2). Rats are best restrained with an over-the-back technique. Place your index and middle fingers down along the sides of the rat\u2019s head with your thumb and ring finger under the forelegs. Place your index and middle finger cranial to the front legs for a better grip. Use your thumb and other fingers to support the chest lightly (\nFig. 3). Gerbils tend to be quite docile and usually require little restraint. They are prone to tail slip, so if the tail is grasped to maintain control of the animal, make sure to grasp it near the base. This species is also prone to seizures when stressed. Care should be taken to decrease the amount of stress induced by restraint and examination.",

The dominant animal in the cage will chew off the whiskers and hair around the muzzle and eyes of cage mates (\nFig. 4). Generalized alopecia may be caused by the presence of ectoparasites. Fur mite infestations, which are diagnosed with a hand lens to examine the fur, are a common problem in mice and rats. In addition, various mange mites are known to infest rodents. Demodectic mange has been seen in rats, hamsters, and gerbils. Sarcoptic mange has been diagnosed in guinea pigs. Lice and fleas may also result in damage to the hair coat.",

If the animal is fed an adequate diet, provided with potable water, and kept in a safe, comfortable environment, many of these pets fare well. Probably the most important criterion for maintaining the long-term health of the pet is to obtain a healthy animal at the onset. It is important to stress to the owner that caging is of the utmost importance not only in confining these animals but in preventing other possible predator species in the household from devouring them. It is also imperative that the cage environment be kept as clean as possible. A lack of cleaning results in a buildup of odors, some of which may predispose to disease. Currently, there are no vaccinations recommended for these animals; however, yearly physical examinations are suggested. Some of these pets quickly become geriatric, and client education is as important as the examination of the pet.",
