The present chapter discusses the current internationally implemented pandemic preparedness strategies succeeding/recommended to curb the COVID-19 threat to humankind. The updated phase-wise categorization of a pandemic as recommended by the WHO is described, and associated innovations in surveillance, response, and medical measures/advisory in practice across the globe are elaborated. From a bird's eye view, the COVID-19 pandemic management relies on revolutionizing the disease surveillance by incorporating artificial intelligence and data analytics, boosting the response strategies-extensive testing, case isolation, contact tracing, and social distancing-and promoting awareness and access to pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical interventions, which are discussed in the present chapter. We also preview the economic bearing of the COVID-19 pandemic.",

Pandemic preparation is not a job of single individual or organization. It requires inputs from each person susceptible to the infection agent as well as policy makers at national and international levels, frontline healthcare providers, infrastructure developers and maintenance personnel, pharmaceutical industry and researcher community, and so forth. Moreover, the pandemic preparedness plan needs constant reviewing and improvisation (https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/ en/seasonal-influenza/preparedness/why-pandemic-preparedness). In line with the magnitude of the COVID-19 pandemic, worldwide action plans have been activated on national and international levels. The United Nations' Strategic Preparedness and Response Plan (SPRS) Against COVID-19, in layman terms, is designed to control human-human transmission, preventing outbreaks and delaying spread; provide optimal care for all patients; and minimize the impact on healthcare systems and socioeconomic activities. Under SPRS each nation is assessed for risk and vulnerability, and the resource requirements to support the country to prepare for and respond to COVID-19 are estimated. Several nations are well placed to implement this action plan with minimal support. However, otherwise partners are to be introduced to facilitate implementation of measures where there is a gap in capacity, on either a national or a subnational level, in additional support to national governments. Thus, an extensive analysis and identification of an affected nation's gaps and needs shall be the basis to develop a COVID-19 Country Preparedness and Response Plan (CPRP). These CPRPs will need constant monitoring and reviewing using indicators charted in the SPRP and updated as the situation evolves (https:// www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/covid-19-sprp-unct-guidelines.pdf).",

By mid-January, the first RT-PCR assays for COVID-19 were accessible in Hubei. The viral sequences and PCR primers and probe sequences were open-sourced and uploaded to public platforms by the Centre for Disease Control, China. By February, there were ten kits for the detection of COVID-19 approved in China by the National Medical Products Association-six were RT-PCR kits, one isothermal amplification kit, one virus sequencing product, and two colloidal gold antibody detection kits (https://www.who.int/docs/defaultsource/coronaviruse/who-china-joint-mission-on-covid-19-final-report.pdf). As of today, when the disease has assumed pandemic proportions, the volume of diagnostic tools needs to be multiplied, and hence, the United States Food and Drug Administration (USFDA) has provided regulatory relief to several testing companies like ThermoFisher, Hologic, and LabCorp under the Emergency Use Authorizations, to facilitate ease of diagnosis. Also it is keeping a tight watch on fraudulent companies claiming to sell interventions against COVID-19 (https://www.fda.gov/ emergency-preparedness-and-response/mcm-issues/coronavirus-disease-2019covid-19). Moreover, the world's first CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats)-based diagnostic kit has been developed for COVID-19 by Mammoth Biosciences, USA, and University of California.

However, in pandemic scenarios of new infectious diseases such as COVID-19, vaccine supplies will be limited or nonexistent at the early phase in lieu of the novelty of the disease and the unpredictability of the pandemic occurrence. Thus, vaccines cannot be stockpiled, and production can only start once the novel virus has been recognized. With the current state-of the-art, the first doses of vaccine are not likely to become available in the early months of the pandemic. However, the pandemic action plans have accounted for forward planning to increase the likelihood that the vaccine will progressively become available as the pandemic unfolds. Importantly, national or regional priorities need to be fixed in the action plan for the rational use of the building/limited supply of the novel vaccine. Also, production and use of vaccines during the inter-pandemic period will influence their availability during a pandemic. Thus, improving the infrastructure and logistics for vaccine production, administration, cold-chain, and professional training with the novel vaccines are important to avert/cruise through future outbreak events. The WHO advisory on prioritizing the population groups are as enlisted in descending order.

The relevance of case isolation and contact tracing are highlighted in a study by Hu and coworkers where they have performed a clinical characterization of 24 asymptomatic patientsconfirming infection by a laboratory-confirmed positive for the COVID-19 virus nucleic acid from pharyngeal swab samples. The asymptomatic cases did not present any obvious symptoms while nucleic acid screening. About 20.8% developed classical symptoms of fever, cough, and fatigue, during hospitalization; 50.0% presented CT images of ground-glass chest and 20.8% presented stripe shadowing in the lungs; 29.2% cases presented normal CT image and had no symptoms during hospitalization, comprising the younger subset (median age: 14.0 years). None developed severe COVID-19 pneumonia, and no mortality was observed. However, epidemiological investigation indicated at typical asymptomatic transmission to the cohabiting family members, which even caused severe COVID-19 pneumonia. This study puts a spotlight on close contact tracing and longitudinally surveillance via virus nucleic acid tests. Case isolation and continuous nucleic acid tests are also recommended (Hu et al. 2020) . De-isolating of suspect cases where the first confirmatory test has returned negative is also an emerging issue of concern and needs improvement in testing capacity as well as strict implementation of social distancing during pandemic scenarios (Tay et al. 2020 ).",

For containment of the global spread of CoV-2 and a COVID-19 epidemic, China implemented border control measures-airport screening and travel restrictions, and were later also adopted by several other countries. Wells and coworkers in their study in Proceedings of Natural Academy of Sciences used daily incidence data of COVID-19 outbreak from China from December 8, 2019, to February 15, 2020, as well as airline network data, to predict the number of exported cases with and without measures of travel restriction and screening. The group put forth that the lockdown of Wuhan and 15 more cities in Hubei province on January 23-24, 2020, averted export of 779 more COVID-19 cases by mid-February. However, it is to be highlighted that these travel restrictions and lockdown measures only slowed the rate of infection exportation from China to other countries. The global spread of COVID-19 was based on most cases arriving during the asymptomatic incubation period. The authors recommend rapid contact tracing at the epicenter and at importation sites to limit human-to-human transmission outside of the location of first outbreak (Wells et al. 2020 ).",

It is increasingly becoming evident that no region of the world will remain untouched by CoV-2 invasion. However, pandemic preparedness is the key to tackle the present-day COVID-19 health emergency worldwide. The rapid and effective enforcement of existing international and national action plans, as well as parallel review and improvisation, is facilitating the affected countries to contain transmission and possibly delay the peak of outbreak and mortality and garner recovery. It is notable that in the present pandemic scenario, innovative AI-powered surveillance, quick and strategic response actions-the trinity of testing-isolation-contact tracing, committed social distancing measures-travel restrictions, self-isolation, implementation of personal and public hygiene, and extensive mobilization of medical care facilities are helping the world mitigate through. The most insightful trend emerging from the global clinical and epidemiological data is that the identification of asymptomatic infected individuals is a crucial step to contain community outbreaks. For preventing future outbreaks of CoV-2 infection, high-volume cutting-edge investigations are warranted in understanding the COVID-19 pathology, CoV-2 origin, biology, structural data of potential surface antigens, and precise anti-CoV-2 antiviral therapies.",

For example, the SPRP estimates a funding support of nearly US$675 million for key response efforts against COVID-19 in countries most in need of help through April 2020. A first-of-its-kind COVID-19 Solidarity Response Fund was constituted for arranging for funding support through individual and organizational donations on March 13, 2020. The COVID-19 Solidarity Response Fund is hosted by two foundations, the UN Foundation (registered in the United States) and the Swiss Philanthropy Foundation (registered in Switzerland) in association with the WHO (https://www.who. int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/donate). \u2022 Increased fiscal distress due to decrease in tax revenues and increased expenditures are expected in low middle-income countries, where fiscal framework is weak.
