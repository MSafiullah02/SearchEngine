            "text": "Over the past century, advances in the development of vaccines, antibiotics/antivirals, and infection control measures have resulted in major reductions in the public health burden of infectious diseases. However, despite these advances, infectious agents continue to cause significant morbidity and mortality in human populations, as well as economic disruption in at-risk communities. The challenges associated with infectious diseases are illustrated not only by emerging pathogens, such as HIV or more recent outbreaks of Zika virus (ZIKV) or Ebola virus, but also by continuing threats from pathogens such as seasonal influenza virus, hepatitis C virus (HCV), dengue virus, or malaria. Furthermore, the emergence of antibiotic- or drug-resistant microorganisms and viruses complicates treatment strategies and further enhances the risk posed by infectious diseases. Due to these threats, there is an ongoing need for new strategies to prevent pathogen transmission, as well as the development of new vaccines and/or therapeutic agents. However, the development of new infection control strategies requires an in-depth understanding of the target pathogen's biology and disease pathogenesis, as well as appropriate systems for testing the safety and efficacy of new treatments or vaccines.",

            "text": "For many pathogens, much of our understanding of pathogen biology and disease pathogenesis comes from direct clinical observations in affected patient populations. This is also the case with vaccines and antimicrobial/antiviral treatments, in which clinical trials to assess safety and efficacy data can provide significant insights into correlates of protection or disease pathogenesis in human populations.1, 2, 3 Furthermore, well-controlled challenge studies have provided important insights into the host response to pathogens such as seasonal influenza viruses and rhinoviruses.4 However, several factors can confound or limit our ability to study infectious diseases in humans. Humans can vary greatly in their susceptibility to certain pathogens: some individuals may be highly susceptible, whereas others develop only mild disease or remain asymptomatic. For example, only a small fraction of West Nile virus\u2013infected individuals become symptomatic,5 and individuals vary greatly in their susceptibility to common pathogens such as human norovirus.6 This variation confounds analysis in humans and can be driven by factors such as human or pathogen genetic variation, underlying health issues, or demographic factors such as age or sex. Furthermore, previous pathogen exposure generally results in immune-mediated protection but, in some instances, can also drive immune pathology, as illustrated by dengue hemorrhagic fever/dengue shock syndrome.7 Although it is possible to control for many of these variables, other confounding factors (eg, pathogen dose, previous exposure to related pathogens) can be more difficult to control during natural infection. In addition to the confounding effects of disease variation in human populations, it can be difficult to perform mechanistic analysis or access affected tissues in humans due to ethical limitations. Although these problems can sometimes be overcome by using primary human cells,8, 9, 10 it is difficult to accurately model complex systemic interactions between the pathogen and host by using these simplified cell culture systems.",

These models provide several advantages, including the ability to control many of the factors that can cofound analysis in humans, such as viral dose or underlying disease states, while also allowing for much more invasive studies than would be possible in humans. A wide range of species have been used to experimentally model host/pathogen interactions, including nonvertebrate models (eg, Caenorhabditis elegans), fish (eg, zebrafish), and domesticated livestock (eg, pigs, cattle), and these systems have provided important insights into pathogen biology, zoonotic transmission, and host\u2013pathogen interactions.11, 12, 13, 14, 15 Each of these models offers specific advantages. For example, C elegans has a short and well-defined life cycle, is easily manipulated at the genetic level, the transparent worms are easily visualized, and they can be infected by a wide variety of clinically relevant bacterial and fungal pathogens.16 Zebrafish (Danio rerio) are also experimentally tractable, visually transparent, and mount innate immune responses that are similar to those seen in humans. These traits have made zebrafish models particularly useful for visualizing host inflammatory responses and studying the role of specific pathogen determinants and host factors in regulating infection by several clinically relevant bacterial and viral pathogens, including Mycobacterium leprae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Shigella flexneri, and chikungunya virus.11, 17 However, the bulk of laboratory studies have relied on a more limited number of laboratory species, including mice, rats, guinea pigs, ferrets, and non-human primates (NHPs), to study the host response to specific pathogens.",

However, it is also generally true that no model organism perfectly reproduces the response to infection seen in humans, and in many cases, different animal models can be used in complementary ways to address specific questions related to pathogen-induced disease. For example, NHP species, due to their physiologic similarity and evolutionary conservation with humans, are commonly used for studying viral pathogens such as Ebola virus, Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and influenza viruses.18, 19, 20 However, due to factors such as the expense associated with NHP studies, as well as their limited availability, long reproduction times, and difficulties in manipulating NHPs at the genetic level, other model systems are used to study these same pathogens. This is nicely illustrated by influenza virus, in which NHPs can be used to study viral pathogenesis.20 However, ferrets are highly permissive to a wide variety of human respiratory viruses, including influenza A virus, and the ferret respiratory tract is anatomically very similar to humans.21 Therefore, viral transmission and pathogenesis studies are often performed in ferret models, which in addition to reproducing many aspects of human influenza pathogenesis, are lower cost and more readily accessible than NHPs.20 Furthermore, although mice are generally not useful for studying influenza virus transmission, they have historically been the preferred model system for studying influenza-specific immunity due in part to the availability of well-defined immune reagents and gene-specific knockout mice.20, 22\n",

            "text": "As noted earlier, one of the major advantages provided by inbred mouse strains is their reproducibility. Therefore, inbred strains such as C57BL/6 or BALB/c mice can be used to study pathogen tropism and replication kinetics, or compare the virulence of different pathogen strains in genetically identical sets of mice. This enables investigators to assess experimental reproducibility both within and between laboratories, while controlling for the effect of host genetics on the response to infection. For infectious disease studies, the availability of inbred strains allows investigators to perform replicate studies, compare results between laboratories, or investigate how different pathogens, alterations in pathogen dose, or different treatments affect genetically identical individuals.23 Another advantage provided by inbred mouse strains is the fact that a wide variety of immune reagents exist for quantifying host immune responses. These include pathogen-specific, major histocompatibility complex\u2013restricted T-cell epitopes and tetramer reagents that enable quantification of pathogen-specific T cells after infection or vaccination in specific mouse genetic backgrounds. Therefore, inbred mouse strains have also been an invaluable resource for studying T-cell responses against viruses such as lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus or influenza A virus,30, 31 and these systems have been instrumental in advancing our understanding of the immune system.30 In addition to providing reproducible, well-characterized models for studying the biology of infection and pathogen-specific immunity, the availability of gene-specific knockouts on defined mouse genetic backgrounds (eg, C57BL/6) has been used by the research community for >25 years to study the role of specific host genes in the response to infection.32, 33, 34, 35 By comparing wild-type mice versus mice knocked out for a specific gene on the same genetic background, investigators can test the specific effect of that gene on pathogen-induced disease or immunity while controlling for effects of the remainder of the genome.",

These human tissue xenografted mice take advantage of the fact that mice lacking a functional adaptive immune system (eg, SCID or RAG-1 knockout mice) are permissive for engraftment by human immune cells, while removal of other mouse genes, such as the common gamma chain of the interleukin-2 receptor, results in improved engraftment. These models can be used to study multiple aspects of the host innate and adaptive immune response, and can also be engrafted with solid organ tissues from humans.59, 60 Furthermore, because immune cells and other tissues from the same individual can be used to generate cohorts of humanized mice, it is possible to test responses in sets of individuals carrying tissues from the same genetic background.61 Although a detailed description of the different types of humanized mouse models, and the methods used in their development is beyond the scope of the present review, we refer the reader to several recent reviews that nicely summarize the current state of xenograft mouse development.59, 62\n",

The ability to use sets of genetically identical animals from an individual inbred mouse strain (eg, C57BL/6J) allows for replicate experiments and comparison of responses across different treatments (eg, pathogen dose, strain, therapies). However, the reliance on one or even a few mouse strains means that investigators are evaluating pathogen infection in a limited number of genetic backgrounds, which is unlikely to recapitulate the phenotypic diversity seen within genetically diverse human populations upon pathogen exposure. Therefore, to model how pathogens interact with genetically diverse populations, a number of investigators have used genetically diverse mouse populations such as the Collaborative Cross (CC).",

These mice were then bred to homozygosity to create recombinant inbred CC mouse strains.64 There are currently >60 inbred CC strains that are available to use by the scientific community (https://csbio.unc.edu/CCstatus/index.py). Because the CC strains are inbred, they allow investigators to perform the same types of comparative studies across reproducible sets of animals that are conducted with standard inbred strains (ie, C57BL/6). However, because each CC strain possesses a unique combination of genetic material from the original 8 founder strains, CC strains often exhibit unique phenotypes not observed in the original 8 founder strains,64 resulting in the development of new mouse models that better reproduce specific aspects of human disease (Figure 2\n). Furthermore, by comparing phenotypes between CC strains, investigators can test how host genetic variation affects specific phenotypes, including the response to pathogen challenge,64 and then map the specific genetic loci responsible for this variation.",

During the development of the CC, several groups used incompletely inbred populations of CC mice known as the pre-CC to assess variation in susceptibility to viral, bacterial, and fungal pathogens.64 The first study examining infectious disease susceptibility in the pre-CC was by Durrant et al,67 who analyzed a panel of pre-CC lines for variation in susceptibility to Aspergillus fumigatus. These studies found high levels of variation in survival time across pre-CC lines, and mapped several QTL associated with A fumigatus susceptibility. The pre-CC, as well as fully inbred CC strains, have also been used to study the impact of host genetic variation on bacterial infections. Vered et al68 evaluated pre-CC lines for variation in susceptibility to Klebsiella pneumoniae, and identified 3 QTL associated with variation in K pneumoniae survival. A second study, by Zhang et al,69 evaluated variation in susceptibility to Salmonella enterica challenge in a panel of fully inbred CC strains and identified several genetic loci associated with variation in bacterial load. Several studies have also used either the pre-CC or F1 crosses between fully inbred CC strains to map QTL associated with variation in virus-induced disease. Studies detailed by Maurizio et al,70 Ferris et al,71 and Bottomly et al72 reported high levels of variation in influenza virus susceptibility that was highly heritable. Ferris et al71 went on to identify several QTL associated with variation in influenza-induced disease susceptibility, including the identification of previously unidentified variants in the influenza resistance gene, Mx1. The pre-CC was also used by Gralinski et al73 to identify 4 unique genetic loci associated with variation in susceptibility to the SARS-coronavirus (SARS-CoV). Detailed analysis of one of these loci, a QTL on chromosome 3 associated with variation in vascular cuffing in the lungs of SARS-CoV\u2013infected mice, identified the gene Trim55 as a high-priority candidate gene under the locus. Validation studies using Trim55 knockout mice showed that TRIM55 plays an important role in regulating virus-induced inflammation within the lungs of SARS-CoV\u2013infected mice.73 Follow-up studies by Gralinski et al74 used F2 mapping approaches to identify additional genetic loci regulating SARS-CoV susceptibility in susceptible or resistant CC strains. This analysis identified 5 additional genetic loci associated with variation in SARS-CoV\u2013induced disease, and identified and validated the gene for the TLR4 adaptor Ticam2, as a contributor to variation in SARS-CoV\u2013induced disease susceptibility.",

            "text": "In addition to utilizing the CC for identifying polymorphic host genes that regulate pathogen susceptibility, investigators have taken advantage of the high levels of phenotypic variation in CC strains to develop improved models of pathogen-induced disease. This is perhaps best illustrated by the studies in Rasmussen et al,75 who used the CC to develop new mouse models of Ebola virus\u2013induced hemorrhagic disease. Ebola virus causes a wide range of symptoms in humans, including hemorrhagic disease; however, although the use of mouse-adapted Ebola virus in standard mouse strains has been useful for studying disease pathogenesis and testing vaccines/therapies, these models do not fully reproduce the disease signs seen in infected humans.76 Rasmussen et al evaluated a panel of F1 crosses between fully inbred CC strains for susceptibility to challenge with mouse-adapted Ebola virus. These studies found high levels of variation in disease susceptibility, including the identification of CC strains that developed severe disease with hemorrhagic signs and liver damage.75 Studies by several other groups have identified CC strains that exhibit novel susceptibility profiles to a wide range of pathogens, including M tuberculosis, West Nile virus, SARS-CoV, and influenza virus.71, 73, 77, 78, 79 These results indicate that by taking advantage of the genetic diversity present in the CC, investigators can develop novel models of pathogen-induced disease that more closely represent disease phenotypes observed in human populations. Furthermore, once mouse strains with novel disease phenotypes have been identified, it is possible to identify the genetic loci responsible for these novel disease outcomes71, 73 and gain additional insights into the mechanisms underlying disease pathogenesis.",

Mouse models have been a particularly important resource for studying infection by a wide range of human pathogens and are widely used for preclinical screening of vaccines/therapies due to their reproducibility, low cost, and ease of experimental manipulation. Although mouse models are not appropriate for studying some aspects of pathogen-induced disease, the use of genetically modified animals and humanized mice allows investigators to study pathogens that will not replicate efficiently in species other than humans or chimpanzees (eg, HCV) and perform mechanistic studies that cannot be conducted in humans. Furthermore, the availability of genetically diverse mouse resources such as the CC allows investigators to test how host genetic diversity affects the response to infection, while also taking advantage of the phenotypic diversity in these resources to develop model systems that better reproduce aspects of pathogen-induced diseases seen in humans.",
