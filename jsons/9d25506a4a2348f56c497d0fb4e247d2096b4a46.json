[1] Both the infection rate as well as death from COVID 19 have exhibited an exponential growth. [2] The whole attention now is on prevention and management strategies related to it. However, as the disease evolved, we learned that not all patient population are at equal risk of morbidity and mortality. The elderly and those with additional co-morbidities in the form of diabetes, hypertension and background cardiovascular compromise are at higher risk than those without these co-morbid diseases. [3] India houses the second largest population of patient with diabetes mellitus after China. [4] Although the pandemic of COVID 19 originated in China, unlike diabetes prevalence, India is, as yet, experienced lesser impact of COVID19. [5] In an attempt to stem the spread of the virus from individuals travelling into India from endemic areas to internal community spread, a feature of the stage 3 of the disease process, a temporary 21 days lockdown(complete restriction on all international and domestic travel, social isolation, and suspension of all non-essential services) as announced by Prime Minister of India on 24 th March, 2020. On one hand this could be a vital step in stemming the spread of the virus, however, on the other there are likely to be issues related to the impact of this lockdown on patients with diabetes; the worsening of hyperglycaemia an increase in diabetes-related complications. This could be due to the limitation of free space to exercise, limited resources to implement a healthy lifestyle, restrictions on the availability of antihyperglycaemic agents and difficulty in obtainingof physician's guidance. Further, because of limitations of transport of goods and movement of patients, there is likely to be shortage of drugs, insulin, and glucose testing strps and glucose meters. All these factors have the potential to increase the stress level and its associated impact on the pre-existing disease.",

This background was selected to simulate the proposed 21 days lockdown in India facing the menace of coronavirus outbreak. The disaster period was included to closely simulate the resource challenged atmosphere. A search of PubMed, Google Scholar and Cochrane library was conducted using following search terms; \"disaster\", \"diabetes mellitus\", \"blood glucose targets\" and \"diabetic complications\" as keywords. Subsequently, clubbing \"disaster\" and \"diabetes mellitus\" (yielded 7 citations) and then combined with \"blood glucose targets\" and \"diabetes complications\" (yielded 546 citations). As per pre-planned inclusion criteria, filters were imposed to include trials only, resulting in 7 studies available for analysis. There were six citations related to disaster and diabetes mellitus which were included to analyse the predicted HBA1c at the end of the lockdown. The disasters included for analysis were hurricane Katrina (USA,2005, days considered as lockdown period -8), Kobe earthquake (Japan,1995, days considered as lockdown period -8), Hanshin-Awashi earthquake (Japan, 1995, days considered as lockdown period -14), the Gulf war in Iraq (1991, days considered as lockdown period -60), Murmura earthquake (Turkey, 1999, days considered as lockdown period -21) and the Great Eastern Japan Earthquake and tsunami (Japan, 2011, days considered as lockdown period -14). Data was collected in a comma separated-values (CSV) file and uploaded in Jupyter notebook and analysed with the Python 3.8.2 software (Windows 10 64 bit, USA). As a re-validation process and for simplicity of understanding, the data was also analysed using excel with XL-STAT statistical software (Windows 10 64 bit, USA). Once the post-lockdown HBA1c was available, the plan was to include the seventh citation, which was related to the Indian data on the mean HBA1c value of representative Indian population (2014) and the prevalent diabetes-related micro-& macro-vascular complications. This baseline data (DiabCare study) was collected over one year from 330 centres across the country resulting in surveying 6168 diabetic patients (12) . Mean HBA1c as well as the annual rates of complications was collected in this crosssectional study. The final step planned was to predict the post lockdown complication rates depending on the predicted HBA1c and the duration of lockdown (in days). These data were calculated with the premise that current state of conditions of the patients and constrained resources continue, and that major intervention to control glycemia (introduction of new drugs and insulin, etc) were not carried out.",

This is likely to be the first study to make such a deduction. In the absence of any prior data on the same, a simulation model was created from the natural and unnatural disasters we faced in the past. Based on the simulation, a model was created to predict the adverse impact of COVID19 related lockdown on diabetes and related complications. There was a moderate correlation between the post-disaster HBA1c and the duration of the disaster (r=0.48) and a strong correlation with the baseline HBA1c (r=0.81). Based on this result a multivariate regression analysis was done revealing a very strong model to predict the post-lockdown HBA1c depending on the duration (in days) of the lockdown. Assuming a uniform baseline HBA1c derived from the DiabCare study which is the latest epidemiological database on diabetes and its complications in India, the post-lockdown HBA1c increases from baseline as the duration of lockdown got extended (example-HBA1c of +2.26% with a 30 days lockdown to +3.68% with 90 days lockdown). In addition, this increment in HBA1c permitted us to calculate the annual proportional increase in diabetes-related complications rate, which increased as the duration of lockdown increased.",

This was replicated by bringing in a scenario (natural & non-natural disasters) which is similar to, but not the same to as may occur in a lockdown. Clearly, there are a lot of differences, between a lockdown and a hurricane, earthquake or a tsunami. The disasters that we have taken for analysis have occurred several years before (Gulf war was 29 years ago). Since then information flow and modes of virtual consultations have increased, and may help patients control their diabetes better. Further, information flow, availability of physicians, and drugs and resources varied in different countries, and may be, in general, better now than previously. These factors may lead to overestimation of risk in our model. However, the limited availability of resources needed to manage diabetes, being a bridging factor made us choose disasters as a prior for the analysis. Finally, any modelbased prediction has its problem related to over-estimating the risk profile.",
