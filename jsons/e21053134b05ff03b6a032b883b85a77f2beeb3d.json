Surgical care in general should be well thought of to prevent undue exposure of surgeons and other health care workers (HCWs) to the risk of infection transmission. Increasing load of surgery also usurps the hospital resources and facilities, which remain precious in a pandemic. Therefore, a strategy to help keep essential surgical systems working effectively and to provide the best surgical care for emergency conditions is the need of the hour.",

In furtherance to this concept, Andrea et al. recommend cancellation of all educational activities such as grand rounds and tumour boards to reduce gathering [2] . Easily accessible fever clinics with a dedicated task force increase the availability of more HCWs in other areas of the hospital [1] . Based on their experience in dealing with the outbreak in Wuhan, China, Zhang et al [3] adopted the idea of adult fever clinics. Although they used home care and isolation as a strategy, they do not recommend it as inappropriate home care may be life threatening.",
