Infection with the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus may lead to a wide range of clinical presentations from asymptomatic infection in 1% of laboratory confirmed cases to mild, severe, and critical infections in 81%, 14%, and 5% of symptomatic cases, respectively (Wu and McGoogan, 2020). The estimated symptomatic case-fatality risk (sCFR) among cases in Wuhan was 1.4%, and those aged above 59 were 5.1 times more likely to die from infection than those aged 30\u201359 years (Wu et al., 2020). With an estimated basic reproductive number of 2.2 (95% CI, 1.4\u20133.9) (Li et al., 2020), the virus will continue to spread and infect 55% of the global population over time if no effective vaccine is developed (Fine et al., 2011). There is currently no effective antiviral compound licensed for the treatment against human coronaviruses or SARS-CoV-2.",

            "text": "The SARS-CoV-2 virus shared 79.5% genetic homology to the SARS-CoV and both are descendants of bat coronaviruses within the Betacoronavirus genus (Zhou et al., 2020). Antiviral compounds previously reported to show effect against SARS-CoV or other coronaviruses may be effective against SARS-CoV-2 (Chu et al., 2004; de Wilde et al., 2014; Dyall et al., 2014; Shen et al., 2019; Cao et al., 2015). In addition, remdesivir (GS-5734), a prodrug of adenosine analog with a broad-spectrum antiviral activity against filoviruses, paramyxoviruses, and coronaviruses (Brown et al., 2019; Sheahan et al., 2017; de Wit et al., 2020), was recently confirmed to inhibit 2019-nCoV in vitro (Wang et al., 2020). According to the 7th edition of the novel coronavirus diagnosis and treatment plan issued by the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China, options for antiviral therapy include aerosolized \u03b1-interferon, lopinavir/ritonavir, ribavirin in combination with lopinavir/ritonavir, chloroquine phosphate, or Arbidol (China National Health Commission, 2020). Ongoing clinical trials are evaluating the efficacy of remdesivir, and various HIV-protease inhibitors (lopinavir/ritonavir, ASC09/ritonavir, darunavir), reverse transcriptase inhibitor (Azvudine), anti-influenza compounds, interferon alfa-2b, or monoclonal antibody targeting PD-1 (Camrelizumab) or IL-6 (Tocilizumab) (Chinese Clinical Trial Re). We evaluated the anti-SARS-CoV-2 effect of compounds that have been under development or already approved for other clinical applications; some compounds were previously reported to inhibit coronavirus replication in vitro, and some are evaluated in clinical trials in patients with coronavirus disease (COVID-19).",

Stock virus (107.25 TCID50/mL) was prepared after three serial passages in Vero E6 cells in infection media (DMEM supplemented with 4.5 g/L D-glucose, 100 mg/L sodium pyruvate, 2% FBS, 100,000 U/L Penicillin-Streptomycin, and 25 mM HEPES). Compounds were sourced from MedChemExpress and Sigma-Aldrich and the stocks were prepared with DMSO (50 mM remdesivir, 100 mM favipiravir, 10 mM R-1479, 10 mM tenofovir, 10 mM fludarabine phosphate, 10 mM baloxavir, 10 mM chlorpromazine hydrochloride, 5 mM dalbavancin hydrochloride, 10 mM homoharringtonine, 10 mM lopinavir, 10 mM ritonavir) or with water (5 mM emetine dihydrochloride, 10 mM galidesivir hydrochloride, 50 mM ribavirin, 2.5 mM oritavancin diphosphate). Oseltamivir carboxylate (10 mM in water) was provided by Roche. To evaluate the effect of compounds in vitro, Vero E6 cells were pre-treated with compounds diluted in infection media for 1 h prior to infection by SARS-CoV-2 virus at MOI = 0.02. Antiviral compounds were maintained with the virus inoculum during the 2-h incubation period. The inoculum was removed after incubation, and the cells were overlaid with infection media containing diluted compounds. After 48 h incubation at 37 \u00b0C, supernatants were collected to quantify viral loads by TCID50 assay or quantitative real-time RT-PCR (TaqMan\u2122 Fast Virus 1-Step Master Mix) following the methods described (Chu et al., 2020). Four-parameter logistic regression (GraphPad Prism) was used to fit the dose-response curves and determined the 50% effective concentrations (EC50) of the compounds that inhibit viral replication. Cytotoxicty of selected compounds was evaluated in Vero E6 cells using the CellTiter-Glo\u00ae Luminescent Cell Viability Assay (Promega).",

Importantly, we observed that some of the compounds currently undergoing clinical trials such as ribavirin, favipiravir, oseltamivir, or baloxavir showed no apparent antiviral effect against the SARS-CoV-2 virus in vitro at concentrations under 100 \u03bcM (Table 1). Remdesivir is a 1\u2032-cyano-substituted adenosine analogue that has been shown to inhibit human coronaviruses (hCoV-OC43 and hCoV-229E) SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 (Brown et al., 2019; Sheahan et al., 2017; de Wit et al., 2020). It is currently evaluated in phase 4 clinical trials for SARS-CoV-2. A recent study fitted viral load in linear scale (eg. the percentage of inhibition) under increasing concentrations of remdesivir reported EC50 against SARS-CoV-2 virus at 0.77 \u03bcM (Wang et al., 2020). We fitted viral load in logarithm scale (log10TCID50/mL and log10 viral RNA copies/mL) under increasing concentration of remdesivir and determined EC50 at 23.15 \u03bcM and 26.90 \u03bcM, respectively (Fig. 1\nA and Table 1). Two mutations (F476L and V553L) in the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase nsp12 of a murine hepatitis virus have been previously reported to confer resistance to remdesivir (Agostini et al., 2018). Due to insertions and deletions in nsp12, these two conserved residues are mapped at F480 and V557 in the SARS-CoV-2 isolate (GISAID# EPI_ISL_412028) used for the experiments, which should remain sensitive for remdesivir. Other adenosine analogues (galidesivir, tenofovor, or fludarabine phosphate) or nucleoside analogues (favipiravir, ribavirin, R-1479) did not inhibit viral replication under 100 \u03bcM (Table 1). However, nucleoside analogues require metabolic activation into their triphosphate forms by host cellular nucleoside kinases, which may differ among cell types. Further evaluation of the effect of nucleoside analogues in primary human airway epithelial cells would facilitate the interpretation of the results.",

Lopinavir was more potent in inhibiting HIV-1 than ritonavir in vitro but showed poor bioavailability in vivo. Ritonavir inhibits not only HIV-1 protease but also the host's cytochrome P450 3A4 enzyme that metabolizes lopinavir (Kempf et al., 1997). Lopinavir/ritonavir in combination prolongs bioavailability of lopinavir in vivo (Sham et al., 1998). Lopinavir but not ritonavir showed antiviral effect against SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and hCoV-229E in vitro, with mean EC50 ranged from 6.6 to 17.1 \u03bcM (de Wilde et al., 2014). Lopinavir/ritonavir in combination with ribavirin were used previously to treat SARS-CoV patients under a non-randomized clinical trial. Less SARS patients developed into ARDS or death after receiving the combination of lopinavir/ritonavir with ribavirin than historical controls who received ribavirin and corticosteroids (Chu et al., 2004). Efficacy of lopinavir/ritonavir with or without ribavirin is currently evaluated in SARS-CoV-2 patients under randomized control trials. In agreement with previous reports, we observed antiviral effect of lopinavir (EC50 at 26.1 \u03bcM) but not ritonavir against SARS-CoV-2 in vitro (Fig. 1B and Table 1). HIV-1 patients treated with 400 mg of lopinavir and 100 mg of ritonavir twice daily may reach the minimal lopinavir serum concentration at 9.4 \u03bcM (IQR 7.2\u201312.1 \u03bcM), which is below the EC50 against SARS-CoV-2 virus in vitro (Lopez-Cortes et al., 2013). Currently, lopinavir/ritonavir at 400mg/100 mg twice daily with or without ribavirin are part of the recommended treatment for managing COVID-19 patients in China (China National Health Commission, 2020). A recent randomized control trial reported no significant benefit of lopinavir-ritonavir in hospitalized SARS-CoV-2 patients than standard care, as the time to clinical improvement, mortality at 28 days, and viral loads at various time points were comparable between the two groups (Cao et al., 2020). Combinational therapy of lopinavir with the other effective compounds against SARS-CoV-2 virus may increase synergy and reduce the inhibitory concentration of lopinavir.",

Omacetaxine, a semi-synthetic form of homoharringtonine, is approved by FDA for treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia. Homoharringtonine has also been reported to exhibit potent anti-viral activity against herpesviruses (varicella-zoster virus, herpes simplex virus-1, pseudorabies virus), coronaviruses (porcine epidemic diarrhea virus and murine hepatitis virus), rhabdoviruses (VSV and rabies virus), and other viruses (hepatitis B virus, Newcastle disease virus, and echovirus 1) (Dong et al., 2018; Andersen et al., 2019). Here, we observed homoharringtonine inhibits SARS-CoV-2 with EC50 at 2.10 \u03bcM (Fig. 1C and Table 1).
