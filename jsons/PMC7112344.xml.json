            "text": "Proteolysis represents one of the key processes underlying biological events from fertilization through development to death. In the human genome there are more than 500 proteases and homologues (almost 2% of the genome), many of whose physiological roles are yet to be identified and which may provide potential therapeutic targets in the treatment of human disease. At present there are 70 known human hereditary diseases caused by mutations in protease\u2010coding genes (http://www.uniovi.es/degradome/). Abnormal functioning of these genes are implicated in such pathologies as inflammatory diseases, cancer, cardiovascular diseases, and neurodegeneration. Understanding of the role of these enzymes and their evolutionary conservation is important for design of appropriate drugs and therapeutic strategies. Other eukaryotic species whose genomes have been deciphered to date also possess a very high number of protease and protease\u2010like genes which in the case of Drosophila melanogaster and mouse are even higher than in human (Rawlings et al., 2006). The number of species in which proteases have now been identified is approaching 3000 (http://merops.sanger.ac.uk/). Cysteine\u2010, serine\u2010, and metallopeptidases represent the major classes of peptidases; among these three classes, the metallopeptidase class is more consistently represented with the number of genes varying from 183 in Drosophila to 198 in mice (in human, 186). Two other classes have much higher diversity with the range in the number of genes for cysteine proteases from 76 in Drosophila to 153 in mice (Puente et al., 2003). For the serine peptidases this range is even more pronounced: from 100 in Caenorhabditis elegans to 309 in Drosophila. There are a smaller number of aspartic proteinases, although some are of key therapeutic importance. This more conservative representation of metallopeptidases in the genomes of various species may reflect roles of these enzymes in more generic cellular functions and their unique catalytic properties which required water and metal ions for activation of the proteolytic (hydrolytic) process, which were carefully preserved in the course of evolution.",

This chapter will focus on two distinct zinc metallopeptidase families belonging to one of these clans, namely MA, whose representatives require zinc for their activity and contain one or two histidine residues in the zinc binding motif. The first of these metallopeptidase families is the M13 family represented by neprilysin [or neutral endopeptidase (NEP)] and the second is the M2 family represented by angiotensin\u2010converting enzyme [or peptidyl dipeptidase (ACE)]. Members of each of these families have served as important drug targets, particularly in cardiovascular disease and, more recently, have provided insight into mechanisms involved in neurodegeneration and neuroinflammation, especially from the point of view of processing of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) and its products in Alzheimer's disease (AD).",

            "text": "NEP, or neprilysin as it is now known, is a cell surface membrane\u2010bound glycoprotein and zinc peptidase also known as CD10 or common acute lymphoblastic leukemia antigen (CALLA). It was originally identified as a major antigen of renal membranes over 30 years ago and, at that time, was implicated in the metabolism of insulin. However, as found later, NEP degrades only the insulin B chain in vitro and not the intact insulin dimer, which suggests that NEP does not have any physiological role in degradation of insulin. Moreover, another zinc metallopeptidase, insulin\u2010degrading enzyme (IDE; insulysin), was subsequently discovered which appeared to fulfill the physiologically relevant function of insulin degradation. Whereas the highest concentrations of NEP are in the renal microvillar membrane, the first clues to its physiological roles came from studies on the metabolism of neuropeptides [especially the enkephalins and substance P (SP)] in the central nervous system where NEP is several orders of magnitude less abundant (Malfroy 1978, Matsas 1984, Relton 1983). It is now accepted that NEP functions to turn off neuropeptide signals at the synapse in an analogous fashion to the hydrolysis of acetylcholine by acetylcholinesterase at cholinergic synapses (see Turner and Tanzawa, 1997 for review). Evidence in vitro has clearly demonstrated that synaptic membranes efficiently degrade enkephalins and SP and that NEP was the primary enzyme responsible for these events (Matsas et al., 1983). Combined with the data obtained in vivo in rodents using potent and selective NEP inhibitors, such as phosphoramidon and thiorphan (Roques et al., 1980), key roles were established for NEP in the central nervous system. Subsequently, renal NEP was shown to be the principal enzyme inactivating the vasodilator, atrial natriuretic peptide (Kenny and Stephenson, 1988), which has led to much investment in the development of NEP inhibitors, either alone or in combination with ACE inhibitors (vasopeptidase inhibitors), as drugs in the treatment of hypertension, congestive heart failure, and renal disease (Bralet and Schwartz, 2001), although concerns over their safety have been raised (Quaschning, 2005).",

For example, in human prostate cancer, NEP is dramatically downregulated (Papandreou et al., 1998) allowing mitogenic peptides such as bombesin and endothelin to drive androgen\u2010independent cell division in the prostate. The survey of the expression of NEP and the NEP homologue, endothelin\u2010converting enzyme 1 (ECE\u20101), in a range of prostate cancers demonstrated that there is a certain balance between the levels of expression of NEP and ECE\u20101 which determines the level of malignancy of the cells and that upregulation of ECE\u20101 expression in metastatic cells may be indicative of its role in metastatic progression (Usmani et al., 2002). Later it was shown that NEP and ECE\u20101 act as mediators of prostate cancer invasion via a stromal\u2013epithelial interaction (Dawson et al., 2004). This and related observations have led to suggestions that the dysregulation of the balance of NEP and ECE can lead to the disease and selective reexpression of NEP in prostate cells may provide a novel approach to the treatment of prostate cancer. This is an excellent example where two homologous peptidases counterbalance each other's actions in physiology and pathology.",

SP is released from sensory nerves inducing neurogenic inflammation and NEP, via SP degradation, limits its effects and those of other proinflammatory peptides. There are several studies reporting the role of NEP in peripheral inflammation, for example in the skin (Scholzen 2004, Scholzen 2001). Moreover, NEP but not ACE was shown to be the most important for CGRP degradation in human skin, and NEP inhibitors facilitated neurogenic inflammation in the skin (Kramer et al., 2005). NEP levels were also found to be significantly decreased in the plasma and monocytes of patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (Simonini et al., 2005). In the mouse model of intestinal inflammation caused by nematode infection NEP was demonstrated to downregulate the early onset of inflammation (Barbara et al., 2003). Inhibition of NEP was found to exacerbate both experimental pancreatitis and the associated lung injury (Day et al., 2005), and pretreatment with recombinant human NEP ameliorated this injury in NEP\u2212/\u2212 transgenic mice (Lightner et al., 2002). In this connection, upregulation of NEP is considered as a potential therapeutic approach for pancreatitis\u2010associated lung injury, which can also be true in the case of other inflammatory diseases.",

            "text": "It was demonstrated that NEP might play an important role in the pathogenesis of AD due to its capacity to cleave the neurotoxic and inflammatory amyloid\u2010\u03b2 (A\u03b2) peptide (Iwata et al., 2000) that is a primary trigger for the development of this disease (Hardy and Higgins, 1992). It is now well documented that A\u03b2 is formed from a large precursor molecule called APP via two consecutive cleavages (Fig. 2\n). The first of these cleavages occurs in the extracellular or lumenal domain and is mediated by a membrane\u2010bound aspartic protease termed \u03b2\u2010secretase (BACE) (Vassar and Citron, 2000). It releases a large soluble fragment of sAPP\u03b2 and the residual membrane\u2010bound fragment. The latter is cleaved by a \u03b3\u2010secretase protease complex, at residues 40\u201342 (termed \u03b3\u2010site) or at residues 48\u201352 (termed \u025b\u2010site) within the transmembrane domain. The presenilin\u2010dependent \u03b3\u2010secretase and \u03b3\u2010site proteolytic activities are dependent on a multimeric complex of at least four different membrane proteins, including presenilin\u20101 (PS1) or presenilin\u20102 (PS2), nicastrin, Aph\u20101, and Pen\u20102 (Francis 2002, Yu 2000). In these complexes, the presenilins have been proposed as a novel type of transmembrane aspartic protease bearing the catalytic core of the \u03b3\u2010secretase (Wolfe et al., 1999). Whereas the cleavage at the \u03b3\u2010site generates A\u03b2, the subsequent cleavage at the \u025b\u2010site generates a cytosolic fragment referred to as ICD (Passer et al., 2000) or AICD (\u03b2APP IntraCellular Domain). The exact role of AICD remains unclear but it has been suggested to act as a functional transcriptional regulator (Cao and Sudhof, 2001) in combination with the regulatory proteins Fe65 and the chromatin\u2010associated histone acetyltransferase, Tip60. There were reports that AICD and nicastrin regulate expression of NEP but this is controversial and still has to be proved experimentally in animal models (Hass 2005, Hebert 2006, Pardossi\u2010Piquard 2005, Pardossi\u2010Piquard 2006). An additional component of the \u03b3\u2010secretase complex, termed TMP21, which is a member of the p24 cargo protein family, appears to differentially regulate \u03b3\u2010secretase cleavage without affecting \u025b\u2010secretase activity (Chen et al., 2006). The proteolytic events involved in processing of APP are highly compartmentalized in the cell taking place both within intracellular compartments and in the plasma membrane. The rate limiting reaction of APP cleavage by \u03b2\u2010secretase (BACE) was shown to take place especially in lipid raft domains enriched with cholesterol and glycosphingolipids and targeting BACE to lipid rafts increased production of A\u03b2 (Cordy et al., 2003). Depletion of cell cholesterol by lovastatin resulted in a decrease in both of sAPP\u03b2 and A\u03b2 levels in the cell culture model. This explains the positive effect of statins on the development of AD pathology observed in patients with statin treatment (Sparks et al., 2006).",

Until recently, production of A\u03b2 in the brain and other tissues was thought to be an irreversible process, leading in the case of their disruption, to amyloidogenic diseases. However, in the last few years, neprilysin and several other proteases (IDE, ECE\u20101 and ECE\u20102, plasmin) have been found to be capable of degrading A\u03b2in vitro and in vivo (for review see Carson 2002, Turner 2004). The sites of A\u03b2 cleaved by known proteinases are shown in Fig. 3\n. Pathological downregulation of these enzymes and, in particular of NEP, could predispose to accumulation of A\u03b2 and the development of AD (Apelt 2003, Nalivaeva 2004). In particular, in mice deficient in NEP or ECE\u20101, amyloid deposits are seen to deposit at significant levels in the brain (Eckman 2003, Hersh 2002). Furthermore, injection of amyloid\u2010\u03b2 peptide into the brains of rodents significantly enhances the concentrations of NEP mRNA and protein, suggesting the operation of a regulatory feedback mechanism to protect neurons from toxic damage (Mohajeri et al., 2002). NEP levels appear to be reduced in high\u2010plaque\u2010bearing areas of human brain in AD and in cerebral amyloid angiopathy (Carpentier 2002, Yasojima 2001) but no association has been detected to date between polymorphisms in the NEP gene and AD (Lilius et al., 2003). Clinical data suggest that ischemia and stroke predispose to development of AD (Snowdon et al., 1997), and it was shown that hypoxia and ischemia lead to a decrease of NEP and ECE expression (Fisk 2006, Nalivaeva 2004). Thus, a possible therapeutic approach for treatment of AD might be a chronic upregulation of these proteinases (Fig. 4\n), either pharmacologically or through a gene therapy approach (Marr 2003, Saito 2005, Turner 2004).",

The structural solution of the catalytic domain of human NEP complexed with phosphoramidon (Oefner et al., 2000) reveals both similarities and differences with thermolysin, and the restricted access to the active site highlights why the enzyme acts exclusively as an oligopeptidase rather than a proteinase, unlike thermolysin.",

It is most abundant in endothelial cells but is also expressed by exocrine cells, smooth muscle cells, neurons, and glia in the brain (Barnes 1999, Barnes 1997, Takahashi 1995). To date, four isoforms of human ECE\u20101 differing only in a part of their N\u2010terminal cytoplasmic region but which cleave big ETs with similar efficiencies have been characterized: named ECE\u20101a, ECE\u20101b, ECE\u20101c, and ECE\u20101d (Schweizer 1997, Valdenaire 1999). Although the relative levels of the isoform mRNA species vary between human tissues, ECE\u20101c mRNA is generally the predominant isoform message. There are distinct subcellular localizations for the four isoforms: whereas ECE\u20101a, ECE\u20101c, and ECE\u20101d proteins are localized mainly at the cell surface, ECE\u20101b was found to be intracellular and showed significant colocalization with a marker protein for the trans\u2010Golgi network (Schweizer et al., 1997). There are no significant differences in the catalytic properties between them, so it has been suggested that intracellular ECE\u20101 localized in Golgi and vesicles might be involved in processing of big ET whereas cell surface ECE\u20101 may metabolize other regulatory peptides (Turner et al., 1998).",

In the latter case, an increased release of ET\u20101 was accompanied by increased levels of ECE\u20101 mRNA. Using normal bronchial epithelial cell culture, these authors have demonstrated that proinflammatory cytokines (IL\u20101\u03b1, IL\u20101\u03b2) induced a significant increase in ET\u20101 release and mRNA expression, while TNF\u2010\u03b1 stimulated expression of ECE\u20101 mRNA. In the model of acute gastric infection caused by administration of Helicobacter pylori lipopolysaccharide, it was also shown that the levels of ET\u20101 and expression of ECE\u20101 were significantly increased in the gastric mucosa of infected cells on day 4 but then significantly reduced (down to 60%) by day 10 following reduced gastric inflammation (Slomiany et al., 2000). Developing this work further, the authors have discovered that ET\u20101 has also an effect on leptin production in the gastric mucosa as a consequence of ET(A) receptor activation (Slomiany and Slomiany, 2005).",

However, the levels of ECE\u20101 expression in rat brain cortex hemispheres and hippocampus was found to be decreased after 15\u2010min global ischemia and restored to control levels after reperfusion (Nalivaeva et al., 2004), which might reflect an adaptive reaction of the brain to increased blood supply to the affected areas.",

It was demonstrated that ECE\u20101 can also degrade amyloid peptide A\u03b2, which made it an important player in the arena of AD (Eckman et al., 2001). Overexpression of ECE\u20101 in Chinese hamster ovary cells, lacking endogenous ECE activity, was found to reduce extracellular A\u03b2 concentration by up to 90% and this effect was completely abolished by treatment with a metalloproteinase inhibitor phosphoramidon. Recombinant soluble ECE\u20101 was shown to hydrolyze synthetic A\u03b240 and A\u03b242\nin vitro at multiple sites. Comparing ECE heterozygous and knockout mice, Eckman et al.

            "text": "ACE was originally identified 50 years ago as a \u201chypertensin\u2010converting enzyme\u201d (Skeggs et al., 1956) and its primary substrate was identified as angiotensin I, which it converts into the vasoconstrictor angiotensin II. In parallel, it inactivates the vasodilator and inflammatory peptide bradykinin. Hence, inhibition of ACE has a powerful effect in reduction of blood pressure and the enzyme has therefore been a major cardiovascular target for many years. The catalytic activity of ACE is primarily as a \u201cpeptidyl dipeptidase,\u201d removing dipeptides from the C\u2010terminus of a susceptible peptide substrate. In the hydrolysis of some peptides (e.g., SP, luliberin), ACE can act as an endopeptidase, although with much lower catalytic efficiency (Turner and Hooper, 2002). Mammalian ACE exists as two distinct forms, arising from the use of alternative promoters. The simplest form is germinal or testicular ACE, which is essential for male fertility and which carries a single zinc\u2010binding and catalytic domain. Elsewhere in the body, the somatic form of ACE is duplicated and carries two active sites. The analysis of ACE X\u2010ray structures has revealed that ACE most closely resembles a neurotensin\u2010degrading zinc endopeptidase known as neurolysin rather than NEP, or carboxypeptidase A, on whose structure the design of ACE inhibitors was originally based (Hooper and Turner, 2003).",

            "text": "While seeking novel expressed sequence tags encoding zinc metallopeptidases, we identified and cloned the first human homologue of ACE (ACEH), which is now more commonly referred to as ACE2 (Tipnis et al., 2000). ACE2 is also a type I integral membrane peptidase showing 40% identity and 61% similarity with ACE and conserving the critical active site residues. It contains a single catalytic domain like testicular ACE, and it is most abundantly expressed in kidney, heart, and lung (Donoghue 2000, Tipnis 2000). Physiologically, the principal role of ACE2 is thought to be the conversion of angiotensin 2 to angiotensin (1\u20137), which opposes the actions of ACE2. Hence ACE and ACE2 act as counterbalances in metabolism in the renin\u2013angiotensin system. Clues to the roles of ACE2 have come from the development of mice deficient in the ACE2 gene (Crackower et al., 2002). These mice have severe cardiac contractility defects, increased plasma angiotensin II levels, and an upregulation of cardiac hypoxia\u2010related genes, implicating ACE2 as an essential regulator of heart function. Intriguingly, a double knockout in mice of both the ACE and ACE2 genes is able to rescue the cardiac defect seen with the ACE2\u2010deficient mice (Crackower et al., 2002). ACE2 mRNA and protein levels are substantially reduced in the kidney in diabetic rats, suggesting that the enzyme may have a role in the development of diabetic complications (Tikellis et al., 2004). It has been shown that ACE2 is widely distributed throughout the brain but is mainly localized to the cytoplasm of neuronal cells in the brain and not present in glia. Moreover, ACE2 levels appear to be highly regulated by the renin\u2013angiotensin system, suggesting its involvement in this system in the brain. ACE2 expression in the brain structures involved in the control of cardiovascular function suggests that it may have a role in the central regulation of blood pressure and hypertension (Doobay et al., 2007).",

This process is common to a growing number of membrane proteins of diverse characteristics (see Hooper et al., 1997 for review), an event which is generally receptor\u2010regulated and sensitive to inhibition by a group of hydroxamate metalloproteinase inhibitors such as batimastat. This has led to the identification of members of the ADAMs (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase) family of zinc proteinases, typified by tumor necrosis factor\u2010\u03b1 converting enzyme (\u201cTACE\u201d; ADAM17) as candidate shedding enzymes (Allinson et al., 2004). Our data suggest that NEP might be also shed from the cell surface by a similar mechanism (Fisk, L., Nalivaeva, N. N., and Turner, A. J., unpublished data).

Indeed, the analysis of various autopsy series demonstrates that 60\u201390% of AD cases exhibit variable cerebrovascular pathology. Hypertension has also been suggested as a risk factor in development of AD (for review see Skoog and Gustafson, 2006). Taking into account that NEP and ECE\u20101 are involved in vascular functions and can contribute to amyloid metabolism, we have analyzed levels of expression of ECE\u20101 in the brain cortex of rats after 15\u2010min global ischemia and found a significant decrease of NEP and ECE\u20101 protein levels in brain hemispheres and both hippocampi which returned to normal levels after 2\u2010h reperfusion (Nalivaeva et al., 2004). We have also demonstrated that NEP and ECE\u20101 levels were lower in the cortex and striatum of rats subjected to prenatal hypoxia (7% O2, 3 h, 13th day of gestation) (Nalivaeva et al., 2003). Preconditioning to mild (15% O2) hypoxia before the episodes of acute hypoxia had a protective effect restoring the levels of NEP and ECE\u20101 in rat brain structures analyzed during the first month after birth. Using human neuroblastoma NB7 cells, we have also demonstrated that hypoxia (1.0\u20132.5% O2) resulted in a decrease in expression of ECE\u20101 (Fisk et al., 2006) and also in expression of NEP both at the protein and mRNA levels at and NEP activity (Fisk et al., 2007). Moreover, both hypoxia and ischemia resulted in an increased production of sAPP\u03b2 and reduced amount of sAPP\u03b1. These data allowed us to conclude that hypoxic and ischemic conditions in the brain might lead to a shift of amyloid metabolism toward formation of higher levels of A\u03b2 due to an increased rate of \u03b2\u2010secretase reaction and reduced activity of such amyloid\u2010degrading enzymes as NEP and ECE\u20101 (Fig. 4).",

Previously, Apelt et al.

Decreased levels of another A\u03b2\u2010degrading enzyme, IDE, have also been reported in the brain of aged mice (Caccamo et al., 2005) and in rat brain structures (Nalivaeva\u2010Turner et al., 2006). Moreover, our experiments demonstrated that in the brain of rats with experimental type II diabetes IDE levels were lower than in control animals (Kochkina et al., 2006). These data suggest that age\u2010related deficit of amyloid\u2010degrading enzymes might be one of the factors leading to the development of the sporadic form of AD and upregulation of NEP and other A\u03b2\u2010degrading enzymes become one of the possible therapeutic targets in neurodegeneration and AD.",

(2003), involves NEP substrates as molecules activating expression of the NEP gene via a positive feedback mechanism and as yet unknown signaling pathways (Fig. 4). Analyzing various NEP substrates in this experimental paradigm, these authors (Saito et al., 2005) were able to demonstrate that only somatostatin was capable to stimulate NEP activity in primary cortical neurons. Since somatostatin levels in the brain decrease with age these results indicate that age\u2010related downregulation of somatostatin expression could be one of the triggers for A\u03b2 accumulation leading to late\u2010onset sporadic AD. In our experiments using human neuroblastoma cells expressing NEP and ECE\u20101, we were not able to detect somatostatin\u2010dependent upregulation of NEP mRNA or activity while ECE\u20101 was significantly upregulated by this peptide in a dose\u2010dependent manner (Fisk, L., Nalivaeva, N.

            "text": "In this chapter, several examples have demonstrated the role of metalloproteinases in neurodegeneration, neuroprotection, and neuroinflammation. This was mostly shown for NEP, ECE\u20101, and ACE; however, there are other enzymes whose targeting might be beneficial for prevention of neurological disorders. Among them are the enzymes of amyloidogenic processing of APP by \u03b2\u2010secretase (and subsequently by \u03b3\u2010secretase) and nonamyloidogenic APP processing by \u03b1\u2010secretase (for review see Cordy 2006, Neve 2003). Although both \u03b1\u2010 and \u03b2\u2010secretases produce neurotrophic fragments of APP (sAPP\u03b1 and sAPP\u03b2) and are believed to play a role in normal functioning of neuronal cells (Thornton 2006, Turner 2003), the \u03b1\u2010secretase pathway prevents production of A\u03b2 and thus is regarded as neuroprotective. Downregulation of \u03b1\u2010secretase or upregulation of \u03b2\u2010secretase activity will lead to changes in the balance of production of A\u03b2 toward its accumulation and there are emerging experimental data that this might be the case in ischemic or hypoxic brain (Nalivaeva 2004, Wen 2004). There are also some data that the same compounds can activate both \u03b1\u2010secretase and NEP activity, for example green tea extracts (Levites 2003, Melzig 2003), suggesting that neuroprotective therapies might target several points in pathogenic processes. However, there also might be situations when one compound upregulates one neuroprotective pathway and downregulates another. For example, the phorbol ester PMA was shown to activate the \u03b1\u2010secretase pathway (Zhu et al., 2001) but inhibit expression of ECE\u20101 (Fisk et al., 2006). This observation implies the necessity of differential analysis of the effects of potentially effective neuroprotective drugs on various enzymes participating in amyloid metabolism.",
