            "text": "The filovirus family Filoviradae, including the genera Ebolavirus and Marburgvirus, can cause a rapidly lethal hemorrhagic fever in humans, and at present, no clinically approved antiviral therapeutics are available. Since 1967, Marburg virus has emerged multiple times, with modern strains showing greater mortality (Geisbert et al., 2007, Malherbe and Strickland-Cholmley, 1968, Siegert et al., 1968, Towner et al., 2006). The Ebolavirus consists of five recognized species, including Zaire, Sudan, Reston, Bundibugyo and Tai Forest viruses, four of which (except the Reston virus) can infect humans (Kuhn et al., 2013, Kuhn and Jahrling, 2010). Among these filoviruses, Ebola virus (EBOV) and the Marburgvirus (MARV) Angola variant cause the most severe diseases, with case fatality rates reaching \u223c90% (Feldmann and Geisbert, 2011, Sullivan et al., 2009). Recently, since December 2013, a historically unprecedented EBOV outbreak has occurred in the West Africa, causing more than 25,000 human infections and over 10,000 related deaths as of May 18th, 2015. Under this urgent situation, we are called for great efforts to develop the vaccines and antiviral therapeutics, which needs a comprehensive and decent understanding of the pathogenesis and molecular basis of EBOV infection.",

            "text": "Regarding the infection by filoviruses, including EBOV, the primarily infected cells are macrophages and dendritic cells. But the viruses exhibit a much broader cell tropism and can infect, upon primary infection, most of the cell types, including epithelial and non-epithelial cells, with the exception of lymphocytes and other non-adherent cells (Dube et al., 2010). Host cell attachment factors such as C-type lectins, including DC-SIGN (dendritic-cell-specific ICAM3-grabbing non-integrin; also known as CD209) and L-SIGN (liver and lymph node SIGN; also known as CLEC4M) and several cell-surface proteins such as integrins, T cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain-containing (TIM) proteins, and tyrosine protein kinase receptor 3 (TYRO3) family members have been shown to mediate the entry of filoviruses on the cell surface (Alvarez et al., 2002, Jemielity et al., 2013, Kondratowicz et al., 2011, Shimojima et al., 2007, Simmons et al., 2003, Takada et al., 2000, Takada et al., 2004, Wang et al., 2015). These attachment factors, however, do not function as authentic entry receptors (Brindley et al., 2011, Schornberg et al., 2009). Following binding to the cell surface, filoviruses are internalized by a macropinocytosis-like process and subsequently trafficked through early and late endosomes (Mulherkar et al., 2011, Nanbo et al., 2010, Saeed et al., 2010). The viral genome then penetrates into the cytoplasm after fusion of the viral envelope with the membrane of the late endosome. In the cytoplasm, the viral genome is replicated and transcribed, and new viral proteins are synthesized to assemble progeny virions, which bud from the cell surface (Bharat et al., 2011, Feldmann et al., 2013). Given its place at the initial step of virus infection, the entry process represents an ideal target for antiviral intervention: stopping the virus before it enters the cell.",

            "text": "The trimeric glycoprotein (GP) spike on the envelope of filoviruses mediates all stages of virus entry, including attachment, entry, and fusion (Lee and Saphire, 2009). Like all the other Class I viral fusion proteins, the EBOV GP is synthesized as a single polypeptide that is subsequently cleaved by furin-like proteases into GP1 and GP2 subunits, which remain together through an inter-subunit disulfide bond and non-covalent interactions. In contrast to other Class I viral fusion proteins, however, the simple furin cleavage event is not sufficient to prime EBOV GP (Neumann et al., 2007, Wool-Lewis and Bates, 1999). After entering into the cell, the virus is eventually trafficked to late endosomes, where GP is further primed to remove some \u201ccap\u201d components, thereby triggering the induction of the crucial membrane fusion event, which leads to viral penetration. The functional EBOV GP priming is mediated by the cysteine proteases cathepsin B and cathepsin L (Chandran et al., 2005, Schornberg et al., 2006), which cleave GP1 within the \u03b213-\u03b214 loop (Dube et al., 2009, Hood et al., 2010, Lee et al., 2008). Cathepsin cleavage removes \u223c60% of the amino acids from GP1, including the mucin-like domain, the glycan cap, and the outmost \u03b2 strand of the proposed receptor binding region (Dube et al., 2009, Lee et al., 2008), resulting in a primed form of GP (named GPcl, the 19 kDa GP1 plus GP2) (Figure 1\nA). Unlike the full-length GP, the primed GPcl could bind to an endosomal membrane protein Niemann-Pick C1 (NPC1) (Miller et al., 2012), which is an indispensable host entry factor for EBOV infection (Carette et al., 2011, C\u00f4t\u00e9 et al., 2011). NPC1 is a ubiquitously expressed protein with multiple transmembrane domains and resides primarily in the limiting membranes of late endosomes and lysosomes (Carstea et al., 1997, Davies and Ioannou, 2000). It functions to aid cholesterol egress out of late endosomes for re-distribution to cellular membranes (including endoplasmic reticulum and plasma membrane) in the assistance of a soluble NPC2 protein (Sleat et al., 2004). Further studies have revealed that the second luminal domain (Domain C) of NPC1 (NPC1-C) is responsible for the binding to GPcl (Figure 1A) (Miller et al., 2012). However, how GPcl binds to NPC1 remains elusive, and structural study should be carried out to investigate the molecular features of the binding interface, which will guide further development of small antiviral molecules and antibodies for prevention and/or treatment of EBOV infection.",

The results revealed that NPC1-C displays a helical structure core surrounded by several \u03b2 strands and contains two extended loops protruding outward for ligand interactions. Further GPcl/NPC1-C complex structure indeed shows that NPC1-C utilizes the two protruding loops to engage a hydrophobic cavity on the head of GPcl. Despite a low affinity between NPC1-C and GPcl as revealed by the biophysical analyses, upon enzymatic cleavage and NPC1-C binding, several conformational changes are shown to be induced in GPcl. After conformational changes, the uplift of the short 310 helix in the \u03b23-\u03b11 loop likely helps to release the N-terminal portion of the internal fusion loop (IFL), thereby triggering the membrane fusion. The mutagenesis work in NPC1-C further confirmed that the protruding loop 2 plays a more important role in the binding of NPC1-C to GPcl.",

The crystal structure of the first luminal domain (domain A, also called N-terminal domain, NTD) is previously reported, showing a helical structural fold that contains a deep pocket for binding of sterols (Kwon et al., 2009). The structure information of the second and third luminal domains (domains C and I, respectively) of NPC1, however, are uncharacterized. Here, we used the pET21a expression vector to produce human NPC1-C (residues 374 to 620) in E. coli BL21 (DE3), and the protein exists as insoluble inclusion bodies. Then the inclusion bodies were refolded to obtain soluble NPC1-C, which behaves as a single monomeric peak in gel filtration (Figure S1\nA). Some droplet-like crystals were obtained using the sitting drop vapor diffusion crystallization method, and the best crystal diffracted to a high resolution of 2.0 \u00c5. As there is no homology structural model, the crystal structure of NPC1-C was determined by using single wavelength anomalous dispersion (SAD) phasing method with the help of a gold derivative. After several rounds of refinement, the final Rfree and Rwork reached 21.9 and 18.2, respectively (Table S1).",

NPC1-C contains four cysteine residues, all of which were involved in forming disulfide bonds (C468-C479, C516-C533) (Figure 1C). Through analysis of primary protein sequence, NPC1-C has seven potential N-linked glycosylation sites, six of which locate in the loops, while one locates at the tip of \u03b14 helix (Figure S1B). No glycans are observed in the crystal structure because the NPC1-C protein is expressed in bacterial cells that lack post-translational glycosylation modifications.

NPC1-C mainly uses its two protruding loops to engage a hydrophobic cavity in the head of primed GP1 (Figure 3B). The hydrophobic cavity was formed by residues from the \u03b11 helix, the \u03b24, \u03b27, \u03b29, and \u03b210 strands, and the \u03b29-\u03b210 and \u03b212-\u03b213 loops (Figure 3B). The protruding loop 1 of NPC1-C contacts one side of the cavity, while the protruding loop 2 inserts into the cavity (Figure 3B). In the protruding loop 1, seven residues (Y420, Q421, Y423, P424, S425, G426, and D428) are involved in the interaction (Figure 3C, top), among which residues Y423 and P424 contribute most of the atom-to-atom contacts (Table 1\n). In the protruding loop 2, six residues (D501, D502, F503, F504, V505, and Y506) participate in the binding process (Figure 3C, top), and residues F503, F504, and Y506 play the major role by contributing the majority of the tight hydrophobic interactions with the head cavity of GPcl (Table 1). Moreover, residue D501 of NPC1-C forms a hydrogen bond with residue T83 of GPcl in the cavity (Figure 3C and Table 1). Reciprocally, the hydrophobic cavity of GPcl consists of residues V79, P80, T83, W86, G87, F88, L111, E112, I113, V141, G145, P146, C147, A152, and I170, while the other residues of K114, G118, S142, G143, and T144 form a hydrophilic patch contacting the protruding loop 1 with polar interactions (Figure 3C, bottom). Of these polar contacts, the NPC1-C residue Q421 forms a hydrogen bond with the GPcl residue T144, and the NPC1-C residue D428 could form a potential salt bridge with GPcl residue K114 in the hydrophilic patch (Figure 3C and Table 1).",

The \u03b214 strand forms a hydrogen bond network with the \u03b29 strand, and two aromatic residues F225 and Y232 insert into the hydrophobic cavity in the head of GPcl. By contrast, NPC1-C takes advantage of four aromatic residues (Y423, F503, F504, and Y506) and one hydrophobic residue P424 to interact with the hydrophobic cavity. Of special importance, residue F503 inserts into the cavity at a deeper position (Figure 4B). Thus, the binding of NPC1-C mimics the interaction between the glycan cap and the cavity but likely with a better binding capacity by providing more aromatic residues. Interestingly, a recent study revealed that a similar hydrophobic cavity is found in the primed Marburg virus GP protein, and the cavity can be targeted by a neutralizing antibody MR78 (Hashiguchi et al., 2015). MR78 binds to the cavity mainly through two aromatic residues F111.2 and Y112.2 (Figure 4C), with a similar hydrophobic interaction in the binding of NPC1-C to GPcl.",

Two most dominant changes occur in the binding site of NPC1-C, including the \u03b27-\u03b28 loop and the \u03b11 helix. In reference to that in the unbound GP, the \u03b27-\u03b28 loop moves downward, whereas the \u03b11 helix goes upward upon engagement with NPC1-C (Figure 5\nA). With the movement of the \u03b11 helix, the short 310 helix in the \u03b23-\u03b11 loop raises upward correspondingly (Figure 5A). In the unbound GP, residue N73 in the beta turn forms a hydrogen bond with the main-chain carboxyl oxygen of residue K510, which is in the N-terminal portion of the internal fusion loop (IFL) (Figure 5B). The interaction can compromise the electric repulsion between K510 and R559 (in the HR1 helix of GP2) (Figure 5B). In the bound GPcl, due to the uplift of the short 310 helix, residue N73 does not interact with residue K510, and the side chain of K510 points inward and easily generates an electric repulsion with residue R559 (Figure 5C). The unfavorable interaction likely helps to release the IFL and therefore make ready to trigger the membrane fusion in the late endosomes.",

            "text": "In order to clarify the interactions between the NPC1-C and GPcl, we performed mutagenesis work with NPC1-C and used the SPR experiment to test the binding. The structural analyses in the above section revealed that residues Y423, P424, F503, F504, and Y506 play the major role by contributing most of the interactions. Thus, we substituted these five sites with alanine (A) or glycine (G) residues, including quintuple substitution, double substitution (Y423&P424 or F503&F504), and single substitution. Unfortunately, the quintuple-A mutant (Y423A&P424A&F503A&F504A&Y506A), double mutant (Y423A&P424A), and two of the single mutants (Y423G and Y506G) cannot be refolded (Figures S6\nand S7\n). As expected, the quintuple-G substitution (Y423G&P424G&F503G&F504G&Y506G) in NPC1-C abolishes its binding to GPcl (Figure 6\nA). The double mutant in loop 1 (Y423G&P424G) dramatically reduces the binding affinity, and the double mutants (both F503A&F504A and F503G&F504G) abolish the binding (Figures 6B\u20136D). The single mutants in loop 2 (F503G, F504G, F503A, F504A, and Y506A) similarly abolish the binding to GPcl, as observed for the quintuple mutant (Figures 6E\u20136I). However, the single mutants in loop 1 (P424G, Y423A and P424A) can keep the binding capacity to GPcl but with slightly lower affinities (Figures 6J\u20136L), compared with the wild-type NPC1-C. Taken together, the mutagenesis work points out that the protruding loop 2 contributes more to the GPcl binding.",

            "text": "With major breakthroughs in our understanding of the proteins or protein complexes that mediate membrane fusion between enveloped viruses and their host cells, the fusion trigger can be classified into four major types: (1) interaction of the fusion protein with a cell-surface receptor; (2) sequential interactions with a cell-surface receptor and co-receptor/s; (3) exposure to low pH environment in endosomes after entering the cell by a general \u201cswallow\u201d process (e.g., endocytosis); and (4) sequential interactions with a cell-surface receptor followed by exposure to low pH environment in endosomes (White et al., 2008). After fusion trigger, the fusion protein would undergo a series of marked conformational changes (White et al., 2008). A key early event is the exposure of the fusion loop (or fusion peptide), which is otherwise either buried or fastened in the native fusion protein (Harrison, 2015, White et al., 2008). When the fusion loop or fusion peptide is released, it binds to the target membrane, forming a rod-shaped intermediate, which connects the viral and target membranes. Next, the fusion protein bends approximately in half by conformational changes and draws the viral and target membranes into close proximity, finally resulting in the two membranes to merge (Harrison, 2015, Wang et al., 2005, White et al., 2008).",

There is an EBOV receptor residing in the endosome, and therefore a low pH environment is needed to facilitate conformational changes in the primed GP after its endosomal receptor binding (Brecher et al., 2012, Gregory et al., 2011, Schornberg et al., 2006). It has been identified that the endosome-residing NPC1 is the endosome-receptor to bind to the primed GP (Carette et al., 2011, C\u00f4t\u00e9 et al., 2011). It has been shown that GP is processed by cathepsin L and B to yield a primed GP (GPcl) for its full function to trigger the membrane fusion (Chandran et al., 2005, Schornberg et al., 2006). NPC1-C domain has been proposed to be the binding partner of the primed GP (Miller et al., 2012).",

Since the binding affinity between individual NPC1-C and the primed GP is low, an obvious question raised here would be how the primed GP can efficiently bind to the endosomal receptor NPC. We can see that there are two possibilities: either the confinement in the late endosomes makes the local concentration of NPC1 to be very high, in which case a dissociation constant in the order of 100 \u03bcM would be sufficient, or that additional domains of NPC1 also contribute to the binding affinity. These possibilities or beyond should be pursued in the future.",

Upon enzymatic cleavage and NPC1-C binding, we have observed several conformational changes in the GPcl, of which the upward movement of a short 310 helix in the \u03b23-\u03b11 loop likely helps to release the N-terminal portion of the IFL in the GP2 subunit, which is probably triggering the membrane fusion. As the crystal structure of free GPcl is not resolved yet, we do not know if it is cathepsin cleavage that induces a membrane-fusion-priming conformational change in GPcl or the binding of GPcl by NPC1-C. However, our data support the notion that there should be a fifth fusion triggering type, i.e., exposure to a low pH environment in the late endosome and interaction with an endosomal receptor. The Marburgvirus has a similar hydrophobic cavity in its head of the primed GP (Hashiguchi et al., 2015) and also needs NPC1 for viral fusion (Carette et al., 2011, C\u00f4t\u00e9 et al., 2011).

            "text": "The structural data of the GPcl/NPC1-C complex have immediately pointed toward the development of therapeutic agents that target their binding interface as the strategies to treat infections by EBOV and other filoviruses. Previously, compounds have been found to potentially inhibit EBOV entry by targeting the NPC1 molecule (C\u00f4t\u00e9 et al., 2011). There are two classes of NPC1-interacting compounds that can hamper the filovirus entry and infection, typified by compound 3.47 and compound U18666A (C\u00f4t\u00e9 et al., 2011). The former compound was shown to competitively block the primed GP binding to the membrane (C\u00f4t\u00e9 et al., 2011), and according to our structural information, this compound probably binds to the two protruding loops of NPC1-C, which should be explored in the future. By contrast, the latter compound cannot block the binding of primed GP to the NPC1-C but rather binding to a different site on NPC1 and causing endosomal calcium depletion, similar to other calcium channel inhibitors targeting the two-pore channels (TPCs) (Sakurai et al., 2015). A full-length structure of NPC1 molecule is ideal to illuminate the true nature of the molecular basis of these inhibitors\u2019 effect, which should be pursued in the future, though we solved the NPC1-C domain structure in this study. In addition to designing inhibitors targeting NPC1, our data also provide another important direction for inhibitor design. By targeting the hydrophobic binding cavity in the head of the primed GP, some therapeutic agents, such as peptide inhibitors or small molecules, which can easily penetrate the cell membrane and reach the primed GP in the late endosomes, can be developed. Recently, a cross-reactive human antibody MR78 was identified to target this hydrophobic binding cavity of both MARV and EBOV (Hashiguchi et al., 2015). MR78 can neutralize the MARV but cannot neutralize the EBOV (Flyak et al., 2015), which might result from the fact that the hydrophobic binding cavity of MARV GP is partially exposed, whereas the cavity of EBOV GP is fully shielded by glycan cap before cathepsin cleavage in the endosome. The antibody cannot easily penetrate the cell membrane and reach the primed GP in the late endosomes, whereas the peptide inhibitors and small molecules can execute it. These previous studies, together with our study, provide a map by which therapy with cross-reactive antibodies and small inhibitors of entry could be developed. Otherwise, recent research advances in the nucleoprotein and its chaperoned VP35 protein also provide key targets for therapeutic intervention (Dong et al., 2015, Kirchdoerfer et al., 2015, Leung et al., 2015).",
