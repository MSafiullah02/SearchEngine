One of the recently most remarkable examples of peptide drugs is the HIV fusion inhibitor T\u201020, which is a 36\u2010peptide derived from the structure of gp41 and practically used in clinical treatment for AIDS patients.5 HIV entry inhibitors6 are the first antiretroviral drugs in widespread clinical evaluation to target HIV replication at sites other than reverse transcriptase or protease as focused previously (see, e.g., Refs.7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14). The HIV fusion inhibitors have received the fast\u2010track designation by the United States Food and Drug Administration because of the resistance of HIV to the drugs targeting on reverse transcriptase and protease. The successful implication of diverse peptides with special physiological activity in medicinal treatment has also increased the interest in exploiting peptides, peptide analogues, and peptide mimetics as therapeutic drugs.15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20\n",

For example, for an octapeptide sample, the number of possible sequence arrangements13, 21 are 208 = 2.56 \u00d7 1010; for designing a peptide regent of 36 amino acids, the number of possible amino acid sequence arrangement would be 2036 = 6.87 \u00d7 1046. This is an astronomical number! Therefore, it is vitally important to develop a computational method to guide us for efficiently designing peptide reagents. The present study was initiated in an attempt to develop a rational peptide reagent design method on the basis of the physical and chemical properties of amino acids, particularly their heuristic molecular lipophilicity potential (HMLP) parameters.22, 23, 24 Unlike the purely statistical techniques in drug design that only pursue the statistical results without physical and chemical rationale, the HMLP approach has a solid theoretical foundation. Moreover, the prediction equations not only can indicate the bioactivity of a query peptide reagent but also can reveal the physical and chemical features for each of the subsites along the peptide sequence.",

This is very helpful for designing peptide reagents, peptide analogues, as well as peptide mimetics and modified peptides for drug development. In the traditional QSAR only one set of predictive coefficients {a\nl} is used, that is for the physical parameters in linear free energy equation. However, in the AABPD model two sets of predictive coefficients {a\nl} and {b\n\u03b1} are used for physical parameters and for the position of residues in peptide, respectively. Two least square procedures are performed for {a\nl} and {b\n\u03b1} alternately and iteratively. In this way the predictive residue Q decreases and the correlation coefficient R increases step by step. In the first calculation example the first correlation coefficient R\n(0) = 0.6175 is the results of traditional QSAR method and the converged correlation coefficient R\n(10) = 0.9705 is the improved result with the AABPD method. Usually after 5\u20136 iteration steps, the iterative procedure converged smoothly for two sensitive coefficient sets {a\nl} and {b\n\u03b1}. However, in the case the diversification of peptides is very poor we may get very bad solution, because of the matrix singularity problem. To build a good training set with proper diversification, two criteria have to be satisfied. First, the range of binding affinities in the test set should not exceed the range of affinities in the training set. Second, each amino acid at each position in the test set should also be present at that position in the training set in different peptides.",

So far we have not observed any unconverged example. In the IDLS technique general inverse matrix method is applied for the least square solution of simultaneous linear equation set. This is a very robust method. Only in the case the diversification of peptide training set is very poor, we may get a very bad solution because of the matrix singularity problem.",

The physicochemical parameters used in the linear free energy equation should describe the binding free energy from all aspects and include all factors that affect the interaction and recognition between ligand and receptor. Generally speaking, more physical parameters are used in linear free energy equation, better results may be achieved. However, sometimes additional parameters do not work harmonically and may conflict each other. For rational drug design, chemists developed many good parameters for QSAR study. However, the physicochemical parameters of amino acid residues for peptide design are not so ready. For further improvement of AABPD, better linear free energy equations and more optimized physicochemical parameters are needed.",
