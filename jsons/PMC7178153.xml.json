On January 7, 2020, a China CCTV News Release reported that an expert group had preliminarily identified the \u201cviral pneumonia of unknown cause\u201d as a new type of coronavirus (CoV) [2]. On January 12, 2020, WHO temporarily named the newly discovered CoV \u201c2019-nCoV\u201d. This virus is the seventh identified CoV that can infect humans [3]. On January 25, 2020, the Chinese Communist Party Central Committee designated a group of leaders to manage the response to the epidemic, in order to comprehensively strengthen measures for prevention and control of the virus. On January 31, 2020, WHO announced that 2019-nCoV was a PHEIC [4]. On February 11, 2020, WHO announced that the novel CoV disease was to be named \u201ccoronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19)\u201d, and that the virus that caused the disease was to be named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)\u201d [5]. As of 11 March 2020, the COVID-19 epidemic continues to spread. There are more than 80,000 confirmed cases in 34 provinces (regions) of China, and cases have been confirmed in 106 countries, including South Korea, Iran, Japan, Italy, and the United States [6].",

In response to major public health emergencies, the administrative execution of each department is robust. In the face of the COVID-19 epidemic, China has launched a joint prevention and control mechanism, which has played an important role in defining each department\u2019s response. The Department of Trade needs to increase the supervision of key trading places, especially places involved in the trade of poultry and wild animals, such as farmers\u2019 markets, bazaars, and supermarkets. The Department of Transport needs to implement traffic control measures in key places such as stations, airports, wharfs, and closed public transport, and to ensure that necessary measures, such as ventilation, disinfection, and temperature monitoring, are observed once a suspected case of COVID-19 is identified. The Human Resources and Social Security departments need to strengthen their handling of labor relations during the epidemic period, protect employees\u2019 wages and benefits, and make arrangements for employees to take paid leave. On this leave, according to a type of subsidy standard, each person will be given a subsidy of 29 or 43 U.S. dollars per day [18]. The Education Department requested that schools establish a current ledger for teachers and students, and has postponed the start of the spring semester, which was maybe scheduled to start in April or May 2020. The national government has allocated 4.4 billion yuan to the COVID-19 prevention and control subsidy fund to support various agencies performing epidemic prevention and control related work; an additional 500 million yuan has been allocated to Hubei Province, and the Finance Department and the Medical Insurance Department have identified further costs associated with the investigation and outpatient medical treatment of the COVID-19 epidemic. Policies to cover the medical expenses of patients diagnosed in other places should also be put in place. In the event of a major illness, health insurance covers some medical expenses in accordance with regulations; the personal burden will be subsidized by the finances. The required funds are paid in advance by the medical provider, and the central government reimburses the medical provider at 60% of the actual expenses incurred [19]. The establishment of a national temporary reserve system for the prevention and control of materials should be promoted, guiding e-commerce platforms to control prices, flow, and reasonable placement. In addition, a supply and demand mechanism for e-commerce is necessary, as are radio and television media departments for the general public to obtain epidemic information reports and enrich their home life; free coverage for users to open cable channels for one month should be provided (Figure 5).",

SARS-CoV-2 is a newly emergent CoV from an independent evolutionary branch [23,24]. It belongs to the same beta coronavirus genus as the original SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, but it is genetically distinct from these two related viruses, with a nucleic acid homology of <80%. The virus that is currently known to be the most closely related to SARS-CoV-2 was isolated from a Yunnan chrysanthemum bat and shares a nucleic acid homology of 96% [25]. Therefore, the chrysanthemum bat may be the original source of SARS-CoV-2, although the direct source of the current epidemic has not been found. Chinese researchers have been quick to respond to the epidemic by initiating new research on the epidemiology, clinical characteristics, treatment, clinical outcomes, and laboratory and radiological characteristics of COVID-19, carrying out research and development of diagnostic tests and candidate vaccines for SARS-CoV-2. Multiple studies published in the world\u2019s top journals, including a series of articles that were published in the Lancet less than 2 months after the start of the epidemic [26,27,28,29] to promote identification of the source of infection, the duration and mechanisms of human transmission, and clinical knowledge about the diseases, show the need for more in-depth research on COVID-19.",
