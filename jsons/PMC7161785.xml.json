            "text": "Despite immense technological advances in medicine, pathogenic organisms remain the source of much human morbidity and mortality. HIV/AIDS, acute lower respiratory tract infections, hemorrhagic fever, diarrheal diseases, tuberculosis and malaria are particularly notorious for high mortality rates [1, 2, 3]. The continuous emergence of new diseases and drug\u2010resistant pathogens has heightened the global burden of infectious diseases in the 21st century [1, 4]. To tackle such biological threats, an improved understanding of pathogenic microorganisms and their interactions with host organisms is needed since pathogen\u2010host molecular interactions have crucial roles in initiating, sustaining, or preventing infection. Pathogenic microorganisms communicate with human cells through interactions with human proteins both on the surface of the cell and within the interior of the cell. These interactions allow the microorganisms to enter the host cell and manipulate cellular mechanisms in order to use the host cell's capabilities to their own advantage, resulting in infection in the host organism. Detailed knowledge of pathogen\u2010host protein interactions may enable us to comprehend the mechanisms of infection and to identify better strategies to prevent or cure infection [5, 6]. However, the identification of new drug and vaccine targets for infectious diseases is only possible when the molecular machinery within individual pathogenic and host organisms is understood. For instance, anti\u2010infection therapeutics should target essential genes in the pathogens which have no homology with human genes [7].",

Today, genomic data for most of the pathogen and host organisms are available [11]. These data are used to study individual genes and corresponding proteins as well as to identify intra\u2010 and interspecies connections between proteins. In the light of these advances, the initial steps towards complete understanding of infection mechanisms through protein interactions have been recently published. In this review, the efforts to systematic determination and analysis of protein interaction networks underlying infection pathogenesis are summarized (mainly in a chronological order) to present the current picture of the research on infectious diseases.",

In the work of Uetz et al. [38], 123 PPIs for KSHV and 173 PPIs for VZV were identified, the largest dataset published to date, allowing the construction of the first viral networks. Topological network analyses of these interactome maps indicated that the viral networks appear as a single, highly coupled module (Fig. 1) with relatively many hubs and few peripheral nodes [38] in contrast to scale\u2010free cellular networks with well\u2010separated functional modules [49, 50]. Just after this study was published, Calderwood et al. [39] reported the detection of 43 PPIs among EBV proteins. The construction of a PPI map for EBV by merging these interactions with already published ones resulted in a network of 52 proteins with 60 interactions. This large\u2010scale network allowed the prediction of functions of uncharacterized proteins, further defining viral mechanisms.

For a genome\u2010wide analysis of PPIs of SARS\u2010CoV, interactions between all SARS\u2010CoV proteins were determined [40, 41] by two\u2010hybrid producing 65 and 40 interactions, respectively.

Attempts to analyze incomplete maps of PPIs and PHIs are still able to supply a partial understanding of mechanisms underlying infection. A similar thorough analysis was earlier performed with herpesviral protein networks of KSHV and VZV and their interaction with the human proteome [38]. In that study, protein interactions between herpesviruses and human were predicted using the interacting orthologs of both proteins in other organisms [54]. Combined virus\u2010human networks were constructed by starting with the viral networks, adding their human protein targets, and then adding the cellular interactions among the targeted human proteins. The topological analyses of the combined herpesviruses\u2010human networks revealed distinct properties from both viral and human interactomes providing insights into the impact of the two organisms on each other [38].",

Very similar behavior to EBV [39] was observed for HCV in terms of attacking hub and bottleneck proteins in the human network. To assess the human pathways targeted by HCV, KEGG functional annotation pathways [99] were used. Four pathways were detected to be enriched in HCV\u2010targeted human proteins.

For H1N1 A/PR/8/34 strain of influenza virus, 31 intraviral PPIs among 10 viral proteins and 135 PHIs between 10 viral and 87 human proteins, most of which are expressed in primary human bronchial cells, were detected by two\u2010hybrid [86]. Some of the PHIs constructed had been published previously [100]. The topology of the constructed intraviral network revealed a highly interconnected nature, as observed previously for other viral networks [38, 101]. In the case of the influenza A\u2010human interaction network, important properties about connectivity of proteins were observed. First, viral proteins interact with significant number of human proteins, reflecting the multifunctionality of the small number proteins encoded in RNA viruses. Second, each of 24 human proteins connects with two or more viral proteins forming virus\u2010human multiprotein complexes. Additionally, it was observed that viral proteins generally target human proteins which are highly connected within their own network, as it was the case in herpesviruses\u2010human system [39]. In Shapira et al. [86] another PHI network was identified for strain of influenza virus, H3N2 A/Udorn/72 by the same experimental approach. This PHI network consists of 81 interactions between 10 viral and 66 human proteins, reflecting a similar nature to the network for H1N1 strain\u2010human system. This confirms the conserved functions of influenza virus proteins through strains. Besides direct physical interactions between viral and human proteins, host responses in bronchial cells to influenza infection was identified by expression profiling, generating a regulatory map of interactions between influenza proteins and their human targets. Comprehensive analysis of the physical and regulatory maps of the PHI system elucidated human mechanisms involved in infection. For example, NF\u2010\u03baB, mitogen\u2010activated protein kinase, apoptosis, and Wnt signaling pathways are regulated through transcriptional and/or physical interactions during influenza A infection.",

Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome\u2010causing HIV has been extensively studied since its first observation near the end of the 20th century [102, 103, 104, 105]. Similar to other RNA viruses, HIV has a small genome and depends largely on human cellular machinery to be replicated. Identifying the physical contacts between HIV and human proteins during HIV replication is critically important for a full understanding of HIV infection. Being one of the most studied pathogens, there are many PHI data for HIV\u20101 in VirusMINT and PHISTO. The current PHI data have been produced mainly by small\u2010scale experiments [106, 107, 108]. Very recently, a global PHI network was generated for HIV\u2010human protein complexes by affinity tagging and purification mass spectrometry, producing 497 PHIs between 16 HIV\u20101 proteins and 435 human proteins [97]. It was observed that HIV\u2010targeted human proteins are highly conserved across primates. The novel interactions identified in that study requires further work to detail their biological significance in terms of HIV infection. Besides whole proteins, domains of the interacting proteins were investigated and the enriched domain types in targeted human proteins were indicated for facilitat\u2010ing future structural modeling studies regarding HIV\u2010human system. The first large\u2010scale interaction networks between viruses and humans [39, 85, 86, 97] provide crucial clues about the viral infections, verifying the critical importance of PHI analyses in infection researches.",

Secondly, the roles of human proteins targeted by these bacteria were investigated using their gene ontology annotations [109]. The tendency of all three pathogens to target human proteins involved in immune responses was observed as previously reported [110, 111, 112]. Besides being effectors of immune signaling, the bacteria\u2010targeted human proteins also have crucial roles in apoptosis [87].

Gene ontology [109] functions enriched in the targeted human proteins by different pathogens revealed common infection mechanisms. Attack of human transcription factors and key proteins that control the cell cycle and regulate apoptosis and transport of genetic material across the nuclear membrane were found to be among the common viral strategies. Despite its scarcity (174 interactions in the datset), bacterial PHI data allowed identification of specific human proteins that function in the host immune response (via Toll\u2010like receptors and I\u2010\u03baB kinase/NF\u2010\u03baB signaling cascade) as a target of bacterial infection strategy [6].",

We analyzed 23435 interactions between 3419 proteins of viral, bacterial, protozoan and fungal pathogens (totally 257 strains) and 5210 proteins of human obtained from PHISTO (www.phisto.org). To generate the intraspecies human protein network, 194006 PPIs were integrated from BioGrid, DIP, IntAct, MINT and Reactome. The significant amount of bacterial and viral PHI data allowed us to focus on comparisons between their specific infection mechanisms. Firstly, attacking hub and bottleneck proteins in the human PPI network was verified as a common infection strategy of both bacteria and viruses. Furthermore, viruses were observed to target human proteins of much higher connectivity and centrality values in comparison to bacteria. Secondly, gene ontology enrichment analysis of the targeted human proteins verified the special mechanisms of bacteria and viruses use to manipulate of human immune defense mechanisms and cellular processes, respectively (as reported in Dyer et al. [6] but relying on lower amounts of PHI data). A first attempt at the investigation of the human proteins targeted by both bacteria and viruses revealed that attacking human metabolic processes is a common strategy used by both pathogens during infections [93]. Global analysis of PHI data provides insights into the strategies adapted by bacteria and viruses to subvert human cellular processes and immune system for the infection.
