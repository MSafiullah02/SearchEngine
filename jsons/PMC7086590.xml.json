Of these personnel, about 20 % were new recruits (service period <1 year) and the others were regular soldiers (service period >1 year).

In the early stage of the outbreak, 1\u20132 cases of FRI were admitted to the MTC hospital every day. This situation did not draw the attention of the MTC managers, and the outbreak was mistaken for severe seasonal influenza by the doctors of the MTC hospital. However, after 22 May, the incidence of disease suddenly increased to more than 10 cases per day, and all patients showed similar symptoms. On 29 May, in an effort to prevent an outbreak of the illness, about 798 soldiers were gathered into several crowded classrooms to attend a health lecture. The MTC managers also appealed to the regional Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) for help. On 30 May, an epidemic survey was conducted by the regional CDC. At the same time, disease control and prevention measures were adopted to control the outbreak, including the cessation of training, isolation of affected individuals, environmental disinfection, and morning temperature screening. No new cases were reported after 11 June.",

The mean age of the patients was 20.24 \u00b1 2.16 years (median, 20 years; range, 17\u201332 years). The distribution of daily cases is shown in Figure 1. Patients were reported in all four training camps. The patient distribution among the training units was as follows: camp 1, 67 (19.14 %, 67/350); camp 2, 24 (6.86 %, 24/350); camp 3, 49 (14.00 %, 49/350); camp 4, 16 (4.57 %, 16/350); support team, 8 (4.00 %, 8/200). The incidence rate among the new recruits was 7.81 % (25/320), and the incidence rate among the regular soldiers (service >1 year) was 10.86 % (139/1280). According to the statistical analysis, these rates did not differ significantly (P > 0.05, \u03c72 = 2.583; SPSS 19).

The phylogenetic analyses were based on the complete hexon, penton base, fiber, and E1A gene sequences of strain SD77001 and their counterparts in 23 other HAdV strains representing HAdV species A\u2013G. In these analyses, HAdV isolate SD77001 clustered with the HAdV-55 strains (Fig. 2). In the phylogenetic analysis based on the complete HAdV hexon gene sequence (Fig. 2a), the hexon gene sequence of SD77001 clustered with those of the HAdV-55 strains and HAdV-11 strains. The strains most similar to SD77001 were HAdV-55 strain QS_DLL_China and ak36_Argentina (BLAST score, 5241; identity, 99 %), followed by Singapore HAdV-11a strain SGN1222 and Taiwanese HAdV-11a strain 760 (BLAST score, 5236; identity, 99 %). On the phylogenetic tree based on the entire penton base gene sequence (Fig. 2b), isolate SD77001 clustered with all the HAdV-55 strains and two HAdV-14 strains: de-Wit and GZ01. The penton base sequence of almost every HAdV-55 strain was 100 % identical to that of SD77001, including that of Singapore strain SGN1222, Chinese strains QS-DLL and CQ-814, Egyptian strain AK37, and Argentinian strain ak36 (BLAST score, 3092; identity, 100 %). On the fiber sequence phylogenetic tree (Fig. 2c), SD77001 clustered with the HAdV-55 strains and HAdV-14 strains. According to the BLASTn analysis, the fiber gene sequence of SD77001 was 100 % identical to those of HAdV-B55 strain 760_Taiwan, strain QS-DLL_China, and strain South-Dakota_USA (BLAST score, 1807; identity, 100 %), and 99 % identical to HAdV-B55 strains 273_Spain, ak36_Argentina, SGN1222_Singapore, and ak37_Egypt (BLAST score, 1801; identity, 99 %). In the phylogenetic tree based on E1A (Fig. 2d), the E1A sequence of isolate SD77001 clustered with those of the HAdV-55 and HAdV-14 strains. Most of the HAdV-55 strains were 100 % identical to SD77001 in the E1A gene sequence. To determine the genetic relationships between SD77001 and the other HAdV-B2 strains, a phylogenetic tree was constructed based on the complete hexon gene sequences of isolate SD77001 and reference strains of HAdV subspecies B2 (Fig. 2e). On this tree, isolate SD77001 clustered with the HAdV-55 strains and HAdV-11 strains. Four main clades were formed in the HAdV-55 (11a) cluster. The first clade was composed of Argentinian strain ak36, some Chinese HAdV-55 strains, and SD77001. The second clade contained Taiwanese strains. The third clade included the HAdV-11a strains from Egypt, Singapore, and the USA. The fourth clade contained the strain isolated in Spain in 1969. To summarize this phylogenetic analysis, SD77001 shared greatest identity with the HAdV-55 strains. This isolate has the HAdV-55 hexon gene, HAdV-55 penton base gene, HAdV-55 fiber gene, and HAdV-55 E1A gene. However, in the presenand t study, we did not determine the complete genome seequence of SD77001, thus the designation HAdV-B55 can not be used directly. As a reference, HAdV-55 was designated as HAdV-55 [P14H11F14]. Therefore, in accordance with the taxonomic nomenclature of HAdV (http://HAdVwg.gmu.edu/), isolate SD77001 should be designated \u201cadenovirus B human/CHN/SD77001/2014[P14H11F14]\u201d.\n",

The statistical analysis revealed that in the acute phase (within 4 days of onset), the proportion of IgA-positive samples was significantly higher in the patient group than in the control group, but the proportion of IgG-positive samples did not differ significantly between the patient and control groups (Table 3). In the convalescent phase (>12 days after onset), the proportion of IgA-positive samples was significantly higher in the patient group than in the control group, and the proportion of IgG-positive samples was also significantly higher in the patient group than in the control group. These results confirm that HAdV was associated with this outbreak.

            "text": "The present study has several limitations. First, although 91.84 % (45 of 49) of throat swab specimens were positive when using an RV13 kit and HAdV-specific PCR and the amplicons from the 45 PCR-positive samples were found to have high sequence similarities to the HAdV-B55 strains, the remaining 115 FRI cases were still not detected by the specific PCR and sequencing analysis. Therefore, it was still difficult to ensure this HAdV-B55-like virus was the only pathogenic agent responsible for this outbreak. It is possible that some other pathogens were involved in this outbreak. In some previously published descriptions of outbreaks of HAdV infection among military trainees, the co-circulation of two or more types of HAdV had already been reported. Second, the members of the healthy control group were randomly selected from the asymptomatic soldiers in the same MTC on 30 May. At the same time, the disease prevention and control measures had been implemented. None of the healthy controls showed any respiratory tract disease symptoms during the outbreak period. However, these healthy controls had not been screened by laboratory detection methods such as viral nucleic acid detection. Considering the results of the IgA and IgG detection in the healthy control group, there may have been asymptomatic infection cases hiding in the healthy control group. Many \u201chealthy control group\u201d members had already been infected by this HAdV virus. In a future outbreak study, the healthy controls should be selected from a camp where the virus was not present and be screened using laboratory detection methods to differentiate the asymptomatic infection cases.",
