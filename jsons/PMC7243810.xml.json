            "text": "Coronaviruses (CoVs) are positive-sense RNA enveloped viruses which derive their name from the crown-like spikes on their surface and they belong to Coronaviridae family. They are classified into four main subgroups- alpha, beta, gamma, and delta depending on their genomic structure [1]. Alpha- and beta coronaviruses cause respiratory infections in humans and gastroenteritis in other mammals [2,3]. Until the last year, only six different coronaviruses causing infection in humans were known. Four of this (HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43 and HKU1) cause mild common cold-type symptoms in healthy individuals and the other two which caused epidemics in the last two decades. The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) caused a SARS epidemic in 2002\u20132003 with a 10% mortality rate. Likewise, the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) caused a disastrous pandemic in 2012 leading to 37% mortality [1]. All coronaviruses infecting humans usually known to have intermediate hosts such as bats or rodents [4]. Previous outbreaks of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV involved civet cats and dromedary camels for their direct transmission to humans [1]. A new coronavirus caused an outbreak of the pulmonary disease in Wuhan (the capital of Hubei province in China) in December 2019 and has since spread across different parts of the world [5,6]. Since its RNA genome shows about 82% identity to that of the SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV), the new virus has been termed as SARS-CoV-2 [7]. However, both these viruses belong to the same clade of the genus Betacoronavirus [5,6]. The SARS-CoV-2 caused a disease known as COVID-19. At the initial outbreak, cases were linked to the Huanan seafood and animal market in Wuhan but active human-to-human transmission caused exponential growth in the number of reported cases. The World Health Organization (WHO) confirmed the outbreak a pandemic on March 11, 2020. There have been >170,000 cumulative cases worldwide accounting for approximately 3.7% case-fatality rate as of March 15, 2020 [8].",

            "text": "Due to the close similarity to SARS-CoV, the biochemical interactions and the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 are highly likely to be similar [1]. The virus entry into the host cell is mainly mediated through the binding of the SARS spike (S) protein to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) receptor on the cell surface [9]. Among coronaviruses, the main protease (Mpro, also called 3CLpro) has emerged as the best-described drug target [10]. The polyproteins that are translated from the viral RNA are processed by this enzyme together with the papain-like protease(s) [11]. The Mpro recognizes and acts remarkably on eleven cleavage sites typically Leu-Gln\u2193(Ser,Ala,Gly) on the large polyprotein 1ab (replicase 1ab) of approximately 790 kDa. Blocking the activity of this enzyme would help in inhibiting viral replication. There are no reported human proteases with a similar cleavage specificity and therefore, inhibitors against this enzyme are less probable to be toxic [8]. The three dimensional X-ray crystal structure of this enzyme in complex with \u03b1-ketoamide inhibitor 13b (O6K) was recently solved by Zhang et al. [8] (PDB ID: 6Y2F) which offers an opportunity for structure-based drug design against the enzyme target. Understanding the relevance of the steady rise in the number of infected and death cases in recent time from COVID-19 and lack of effective therapeutic interventions such as drugs and vaccines, computer-aided drug design is an important strategy to be sought after. This rational based drug design will reduce the cost and time incurred in the drug discovery process. Structure-based drug design primarily relies on molecular docking to identify lead molecules against the target proteins from chemical libraries [12,13]. Compared to the synthetic inhibitors plant based-drugs have less toxicity and much safer to use. The natural products such as traditional medicines and plant-derived compounds (phytochemicals) are the rich sources of promising antiviral drugs [14]. Around 44% of the approved antiviral drugs between 1981 and 2006 were derived from natural products [15]. The plant extracts have been extensively used and screened for drug molecules to evaluate theirs in vitro antiviral activities. Few examples of medicinal plants with proven antiviral activities include Phyllanthus amarus Schum. and Thonn which blocks human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) replication both in vitro and in vivo [16]; Azadirachta indica Juss. (Neem) shows in vitro and in vivo inhibition properties against Dengue virus type-2 (DENV-2) [17]; Geranium sanguineum L. significantly inhibits the replication of Herpes simplex virus type-1 and 2 (HSV-1 and HSV-2) in vitro [18]; Acacia nilotica L. possesses activity against Hepatitis C virus (HCV) in vitro etc. [19].",

The MSA results show the conservation of residues in the three domains-I (residues 1\u201399), II (residues 100\u2013182) and III (residues 199\u2013306) of the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro enzyme which includes catalytic dyad residues His41-Cys145 located in a cleft between domains I and II along with canonical oxyanion hole residues Gly143, Ser144 and Cys145 (Fig. 1\n). Domains I and II have a typical chymotrypsin-like two-\u03b2-barrel fold. Domain III possesses a globular structure consisting of five \u03b1-helices which is connected to Domain II by a loop of residues 183\u2013198 [32]. The pairwise structural imposition of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro and SARS-CoV Mpro yields an RMSD value of 0.517 \u00c5 while an RMSD value of 0.817 \u00c5 was obtained when SARS-CoV-2 Mpro was superimposed on MERS-CoV Mpro (Fig. 2\n). This indicates that SARS-CoV-2 Mpro is structurally more close to SARS-CoV Mpro as compared to MERS-CoV Mpro.

The docking scores were bench-marked using the standard inhibitor, \u03b1-ketoamide 13 b (6OK). The \u03b1-ketoamide 13 b is a broad-spectrum inhibitor with an IC50 value of 0.67 \u00b1 0.18 \u03bcM, 0.90 \u00b1 0.29 \u03bcM and 0.58 \u00b1 0.22 \u03bcM respectively against purified recombinant SARS-CoV-2 Mpro, SARS-CoV Mpro and MERS-CoV Mpro [8]. On comparing the binding energies and inhibition constants with that of the standard inhibitor, we have shortlisted three lead molecules viz., Bonducellpin D, 5,7-dimethoxyflavanone-4\u2032-O-\u03b2-d-glucopyranoside and Caesalmin B. Bonducellpin D and Caesalmin B are terpenoids isolated from the seeds of traditional Chinese medicinal plant Caesalpinia minax and exhibit in vitro inhibitory activities against Parainfluenza-3 (PI-3) virus. [34] The flavonoid 5,7-dimethoxyflavanone-4\u2032-O-\u03b2-d-glucopyranoside has previously been reported to have antiviral activity against PI-3 [35]. The molecular interactions of LigPLot results are represented in Table 6\n. The best-ranked lead molecule i.e., Bonducellpin D interacts with the enzyme target with a binding energy of \u22129.28 kcal/mol and inhibition constant of 156.75 nM. Bonducellpin D establishes four hydrogen bonds with residues Glu166 and Thr190 and hydrophobic interactions via eight residues (Met49, His164, Met165, Pro168, Asp187, Arg188, Gln189 and Gln192) (Fig. 3A). The second lead molecule i.e., 5,7-dimethoxyflavanone-4\u2032-O-\u03b2-d-glucopyranoside interacts with the target enzyme with a binding energy of \u22129.23 kcal/mol and inhibition constant of 170.31 nM. This interaction is strengthed by the establishment of five hydrogen bonds with residues Glu166, Thr190 and Gln192 and with the involvement of thirteen residues (Phe140, Leu141, Asn142, Gly143, Ser144, Cys145, His164, Met165, Leu167, Pro168, His172, Arg188 and Gln189) contributing to hydrophobic interactions (Fig. 3B). The third lead molecule- Caesalmin B interacts with SARS-CoV-2 Mpro with a binding energy of \u22128.82 kcal/mol and inhibition constant of 342.79 nM. The molecular interaction is facilitated through four hydrogen bonds with residues Glu166, Thr190 and Gln192 and hydrophobic interactions via ten residues (His41, Met49, Tyr54, Cys145, His164, Met165, Leu167, Asp187, Arg188 and Glu189) (Fig. 3C). The standard inhibitor interacts with SARS-CoV-2 Mpro with a binding energy of \u22128.24 kcal/mol and inhibition constant of 905.88 nM. The binding interaction is mediated through four hydrogen bonds with residues Asn142, Cys145 and Glu166, and hydrophobic interactions via fourteen residues (Thr26, His41, Phe140, Leu141, Gly143, Ser144, His163, His164, Met165, Pro168, Asp187, Gln189, Thr190 and Gln192) (Fig. 3D). Interestingly, the residues His41 and Cys145 which form catalytic dyad residues are also found interacting with the inhibitor. Thus all the three lead molecules have better binding affinity to SARS-CoV-2 Mpro compared to the standard inhibitor.",

            "text": "Due to the close similarity of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro to SARS-CoV Mpro and MERS-CoV Mpro at the structural level, the identified lead molecules may have broad-spectrum inhibitory activity and therefore, the binding affinities of the lead molecules against the other two target enzymes were studied. The binding energies and inhibition constants of the compounds against SARS-CoV Mpro and MERS-CoV Mpro are shown in Table 7\n. The best-ranked lead molecule i.e., Bonducellpin D exhibits binding energies and inhibition constants of \u22128.64 kcal/mol and 467.11 nM; \u22128.93 kcal/mol and 284.86 nM against SARS-CoV Mpro and MERS-CoV Mpro respectively. It binds to SARS-CoV Mpro by establishing two hydrogen bonds with Gln189 and hydrophobic interacting residues include His41, Cys44, Met49, Tyr54, Asn142, Cys145, His164, Met165, Glu166, Asp187 and Arg188 (N = 11) (Fig. 4A). Bonducellpin D also shows good molecular interaction with MERS-CoV Mpro using four hydrogen bonds with residues His41, Ser147, Cys148 and Glu169 and residues such as Met25, Leu49, Phe143, Leu144, Cys145, Gly146, His166, Gln167, Met168 and Gln192 (N = 10) participate in hydrophobic interactions (Fig. 5A). With binding energies and inhibition constants of \u22128.94 kcal/mol and 282.15 nM; \u22128.55 kcal/mol and 539.13 nM against SARS-CoV Mpro and MERS-CoV Mpro respectively, the second lead molecule i.e., 5,7-dimethoxyflavanone-4\u2032-O-\u03b2-d-glucopyranoside also shows broad-spectrum antiviral activities. 5,7-dimethoxyflavanone-4\u2032-O-\u03b2-d-glucopyranoside shows favourable interactions with SARS-CoV Mpro through seven hydrogen bonds with His163, Glu166, Thr190 and Gln192 and hydrophobic interactions via residues Phe140, Leu141, Gly143, Ser144, Cys145, Met165, Leu167, Pro168, His172, Gln189 and Ala191 (N = 11) (Fig. 4B). It also exhibits good binding to MERS-CoV Mpro through four hydrogen bonds via residues Gly146, Gln192 and Gln195 and the interaction is further strengthened through hydrophobic interactions via Met25, His41, Leu49, Cys148, Gln167, Met168, Glu169, Leu170, Ala171, Lys191, Val193 and His194 (N = 12) (Fig. 5B). The third lead compound- Caesalmin B shows binding energies and inhibition constants of \u22128.71 kcal/mol and 412.24 nM; \u22129.49 kcal/mol and 111.50 nM against SARS-CoV Mpro and MERS-CoV Mpro respectively. Caesalmin B shows optimum binding to SARS-CoV Mpro by forming two hydrogen bonds with residues Gly143 and Glu166 and hydrophobic interactions via residues His41, Leu141, Asn142, Ser144, Cys145, His163, His164, Met165 and Gln189 (N = 9) (Fig. 4C). It also exhibits good binding to MERS-CoV Mpro by establishing three hydrogen bonds with residues Cys145, Cys148 and His166 and hydrophobic interactions via residues Met25, Thr26, Leu27, Phe143, Leu144, Gly146, Ser147, Gln167, Met168, Glu169 and Gln192 (N = 11) (Fig. 5C). The control shows binding energies and inhibition constants of \u22128.62 kcal/mol and 482.81 nM; \u221211.36 kcal/mol and 4.75 nM against SARS-CoV Mpro and MERS-CoV Mpro respectively. The interaction between the control and SARS-CoV Mpro is mediated through two hydrogen bonds with Glu166 and Gln189 and hydrophobic interactions through residues-Thr25, His41, Val42, Cys44, Met49, Tyr54, Leu141, Asn142, Gly143, Ser144, Cys145, His163, His164, Met165, Leu167, Asp187 and Thr190 (N = 17) (Fig. 4D). It also shows good binding to MERS-CoV Mpro which involves seven hydrogen bonds with Cys145, Ser147, Cys148, Gln167 and Glu169 and hydrophobic interactions via residues Met25, Thr26, Leu27, His41, Phe143, Leu144, Gly146, His166, Met168, Leu170, Ala171, Gln192, Val193, His194 and Gln195 (N = 15) (Fig. 5D).",

SARS-CoV-2 Mpro is a well-characterized drug target and its recent structural elucidation through X-ray crystallography has opened an avenue for structure-based drug design. Herein, we have explored a small library of phytochemicals with previously reported antiviral properties for the identification of small molecular inhibitors against SARS-CoV-2 Mpro using a computational approach. We identified three lead molecules- Bonducellpin D, 5,7-dimethoxyflavanone-4\u2032-O-\u03b2-d-glucopyranoside and Caesalmin B which exhibit higher binding affinities as compared to the control. These lead molecules also demonstrate broad-spectrum antiviral activities against SARS-CoV Mpro and MERS-CoV Mpro. The current findings need further validations through in vitro and in vivo studies for developing into drug candidate molecules.",
