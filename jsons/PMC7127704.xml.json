            "text": "Host\u2013pathogen interactions are critical to the outcome of disease. The initial cellular recognition of pathogens by the pathogen recognition receptors (PRR) triggers downstream immune-related genes and rapidly sets up an overall immune response against the invading pathogen (Wang et al., 2007). Whilst the resultant mileu of cytokines are paramount in the host protection from viruses such as highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI), the upregulated cytokines also lead to inflammation at the sites of infection (Sladkova and Kostolansky, 2006, Kobasa et al., 2007). The level of cytokine impact on the disease state is unclear. Infections such as dengue fever (Leong et al., 2007), malaria (Clark et al., 2008) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) (Cameron et al., 2008) promote an inflammatory cytokine response during early infection which have been suggested to be responsible for cellular and organ damage. H5N1 infections in humans also leads to an increased inflammatory response and appears to contribute to the severity of disease and associated mortality (Tran et al., 2004, Chan et al., 2005, de Jong et al., 2006). The H5N1-associated response includes the regulation of proinflammatory cytokines, antiviral cytokines and interferons (IFNs) (Sladkova and Kostolansky, 2006) which inhibit viral replication (Szretter et al., 2007, Karpala et al., 2008). However, the induction of some of the associated cytokines, like IFN, TNF\u03b1, IL1\u03b2 and IL6, are thought to be at least partially responsible for influenza-induced pathology (Cheung et al., 2002).",

            "text": "Interestingly, the rapid disease progression observed in influenza infected chickens is not observed in ducks (Alexander et al., 1986). Whilst ducks often maintain a healthy state they enable the continuing spread of influenza by acting as a viral reservoir and then mingling with chicken flocks, and so ducks are critical to the control of the influenza cycle (Webster et al., 1992). Research efforts show that humans and other animals, as well as chickens, suffer from high viral loads, extensive tissue tropism, and elevated immune responses following H5N1 infections (Cheung et al., 2002, Suzuki et al., 2009) whereas ducks often remain in good health, all the while continuing to shed virus (Alexander et al., 1986, Jeong et al., 2009). Recent comparative analyses indicates ducks and chickens respond differently to low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) infection (Mundt et al., 2009, Cornelissen et al., 2012). The lungs of the chicken, in contrast to ducks, endure high viral loads as well as high levels of IL6, type 1 IFNs, and PRR such as TLR3, TLR7 and Mda5 (Cornelissen et al., 2012). Nevertheless, studies with mammals and avians show that viral loads and immune responses associated with HP-influenza infections are quite different when compared with LP-influenza infections (Tumpey et al., 2005).",

In this study 2 H5N1 strains, derived from ducks, were used to infect chickens and ducks. The cytokine and acute phase immune responses were analyzed by observing the levels of IFN\u03b3, SAA and the interleukins, IL1\u03b2, IL6 and IL18. In addition, the levels of Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) were examined as H5N1 viral RNA interacts with TLR7 (Stewart et al., 2012) which further activate innate immune responses (Geeraedts et al., 2008). Vast differences were evident following HP-influenza infections in chickens and ducks. Furthermore, the findings were specific to HP-influenza since LP-influenza H5N3 virus (Vc1462) did not induce similar responses in the chicken. It is hoped that a better understanding of these host\u2013pathogen interactions might be helpful in deriving new immune modulation strategies aimed at reducing HP-influenza induced illness in chickens and humans.",

In lung tissue (Fig. 6B), H5N1 antigen appeared throughout the parenchyma and around the epithelial cells of blood vessels. Serial sections of lung tissue were additionally stained with anti-IL6 antibody (Fig. 6C) and apparent co-localization of IL6 with H5N1 antigen was identified. Liver hepatocytes (Fig. 6D) and sinusoidal cells (presumably endothelial cells) appeared necrotic and were positive for H5N1 antigen, mainly around the lesions observed (Fig. 6E).

Additionally, various H5N1 influenza strains may have different clinical impacts in a specific animal (Perkins and Swayne, 2003). Here we show initially that H5N1 (Vt453) infection is fatal to chickens within 24 h whereas duck fatality occurs in around 120 h. Additionally, whilst the H5N1 (Ind109) is fatal to chickens, ducks overcame the same infection. This indicates that a HP influenza virus in one avian species is not always HP in other avian species and supports previous findings that ducks have a lower fatality incidence following H5N1 infection (Alexander et al., 1986, Bingham et al., 2009). It is unclear how this varying pathogenicity occurs, but differing host\u2013pathogen immune responses during H5N1 influenza infection likely plays a role in disease.",

As expected, the lung tissue of H5N1-infected chickens had the highest viral titers (in excess of 7 log10 TCID50) and had correspondingly high levels of proinflammatory cytokines. Nevertheless, virus titers in the chicken spleen, heart and brain tissue were almost as high as those found in the lung. This intense viral replication and viremia may be promoted by excessive inflammation, which impacts on the permeability of blood vessels allowing greater viral spread. Swayne et al. (2007) have suggested altered vascular permeability to explain edema and hemorrhage, as contributing to systemic viral replication and subsequent multiple organ failure then death. Furthermore, SARS, Hepatitis and Mareks research identified that altered permeability of blood vessels contributed to pathogenesis (Swayne et al., 1988, Liao et al., 2004) although it's less clear if increased permeability was caused by inflammation or viral proteins.",

These increases appeared to be systemic since elevated levels were found in the lung, heart, spleen and brain. Both IL1\u03b2 and IL6 regulate epithelial and vascular endothelial cells and have been implicated in influenza pathogenesis in humans and primates (Skoner et al., 1999). IL6 may be released by influenza-damaged macrophages and epithelial cells (Hierholzer et al., 1998). SARS virus induced disease severity has similarly been linked with IL6 in the lung environment (Cheung et al., 2005).

In H5N1-infected chickens SAA was elevated between 20- and 70-fold and the levels correlated with IL6 levels supporting that IL6 may influence SAA activation as others have shown (Ramadori et al., 1988). Excessive levels of SAA contribute to SARS disease (Huang et al., 2005) and may similarly contribute to H5N1-related disease observed in this study.

RIG-I overexpression in vitro benefits the chicken response to influenza and its natural absence may explain poor in vivo immunity to H5N1 (Barber et al., 2010). Clearly, the immune response is multifaceted and RIG-I alone may not protect an organism from influenza, especially since many organisms succumb to HPAI virus in the presence of RIG-I. What's more, both chickens and ducks overcame the LP H5N3 with only small increases in IFN\u03b3, IL1\u03b2, IL6 and SAA compared to the HP influenza viruses.

In particular, NS1 interacts with the RIG-like helicases further suggesting the importance of RIG-I for protecting influenza-infected organisms (R\u00fcckle et al., 2012). Recently, a species-specific interaction of NS1 and the ubiquitinase trim25, were identified which might explain an organisms differential response to influenza since the NS1-trim25 impacts the RIG-like helicases (Rajsbaum et al., 2012). Further research is required to delineate chicken and duck ubiquitinases as these are likely to have multiple cellular targets (Belgnaoui et al., 2012). Another interesting observation that may explain duck protection from influenza may be rapid cell death of influenza infected cells, which limits virus spread, before the virus can become well established in the race for survival (Kuchipudi et al., 2012).",

Conversely, ducks survive and their cytokine response is relatively low and parallels chickens infected with LP H5N3. With this in mind, protection strategies for chickens could target the virus or the host response. Research with H5N1-infected mice treated with the antiviral zanamivir showed that survival did not improve. However, when H5N1 infected mice were treated with a combination of an antiviral and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitors, inflammatory markers decreased by almost half and survival was improved significantly (Zheng et al., 2008). Similarly, Imai et al. (2009), suggested that the administration of ETR-P1, an anti-inflammatory, could protect 10-day-old chickens from H5N1 influenza infection. With this in mind, future work, directed at modulating the levels of proinflammatory responses, such as IL6, following H5N1 influenza infection may be beneficial for developing potential immunotherapies.",
