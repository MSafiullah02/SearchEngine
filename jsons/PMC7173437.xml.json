Nevertheless, phage can also lyze bacteria and impact relative bacterial counts [9], [10]. The viral load is roughly similar to that of bacteria [11].

Most gut viruses are not cultivable and unbiased metagenomics studies have therefore contributed recently to their better characterization. The eukaryotic virome seems to be acquired progressively with age, in contrast to bacteriophage richness, which seems greatest early in life and then decreases [13]. Acquisition of these resident viruses is associated in healthy infants to no apparent underlying acute or chronic disorders [13]. Enteroviruses, parechoviruses, and sapoviruses were mostly detected. Comparison of the sequences of enterovirus and parechovirus strains from cotwins showed high identity, suggesting that twins harbor similar virome, in part linked to common exposure [13].",

For example, human enterovirus (EV) [14] and parechovirus (HPeV) [15] are excreted by a large fraction of healthy children under the age of five. A 1-year NGS longitudinal study of the stool of two healthy infant siblings in samples taken at 1-week intervals demonstrated that viruses were continuously excreted [16]. The most frequently observed viruses, in decreasing order, were anellovirus (TTV but also TTMV), picobirnavirus, and HPeV types 1 and 6. Bocavirus (HBoV-1), Adenovirus C and F, Aichi virus, astroviruses, and rotaviruses were less frequently detected. Surprisingly, other enteric viruses, such as noroviruses, coronaviruses, cardioviruses, cosaviruses, saliviruses, and sapoviruses, were not detected, although they are frequently detected in stool, indicating that the results of this survey only provide a first indication of the composition of the gut virome, which would benefit from the study of larger samples. Some viruses, including adenoviruses, anelloviruses, picobirnaviruses, parechoviruses, and Human bocavirus, were shed for months. These viruses are more likely to represent a significant portion of the normal human virome, owing to their ability to establish persistent infections. Among these viruses, another study showed that the presence of anelloviruses and circoviruses discriminate twin pairs that include one child with severe acute malnutrition from concordant healthy pairs, but not diseased versus healthy children within a given twin pair. So, it remains unclear if anelloviruses and circoviruses are markers of, or are responsible for, disease pathogenesis [17].",

Detection of corresponding viral nucleic acids within cells through several pattern-recognition sensors for RNA (RIG-I and Toll-like receptors TLR7 and TLR8) and DNA (TLR9, cyclic-GMP-AMP) should lead to expression of type interferon (IFN)-\u03b1 and -\u03b2 with pleiotropic activities, and inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin 1 and 6.

As for foodborne bacterial infections, which may lead to local intestinal infection, or systemic disease, viruses whose portal of entry is the gut may be associated with either local or systemic disease. Their transmissibility depends on the amount of infectious viral particles released in the feces, and the duration of the viral release. Rotavirus and noroviruses, which replicate in intestinal epithelial cells, lead to local replication in the digestive tract, and very high-level fecal shedding, which is favored by the associated diarrhea, which mechanism can result, as for bacteria, from the action of a toxin [24] or a direct enteropathogenicity, and accounts for their high transmissibility. In contrast, enteroviruses, the leading cause of meningitis, translocate at the gut level and disseminate systemically. While their cell tropism is broader, their replication in mucosal tissue and their release in the intestinal lumen lead to fecal shedding, release in the environment and transmission. The infective potential of enteric viruses depends on the species itself, microbiota, and many host factors, such as age, nutritional status, and immune functions, which are themselves dependent on the microbiota. This underlines the complex interplay between the host, and the bacterial and viral parts of the microbiome, which only begins to be deciphered.\n",

It is well known by clinicians in charge of immunodeficient patients that diarrhea is a frequent symptom associated with opportunistic viral infections. Patients under immunosuppressive therapy for organ transplantation may present with chronic diarrhea associated with noroviruses and sapoviruses, leading to chronic fecal shedding, and nosocomial transmission [25]. Patients with congenital agammaglobulinema or profound hypogammaglobulinemia are prone to chronic and recurrent severe enterovirus infection, associated with encephalitis. These patients are frequently persistently colonized with enteroviruses, which can persist for years in the gut, and be associated with multiple episodes of CNS disease. In these patients, the occurrence of encephalitis in the absence of detectable enterovirus by RT-PCR methods in the CSF does not rule out their presence. NGS is indeed able to detect enterovirus genome when RT-PCR is negative, because of its intrinsic sensitivity, and its ability to detect variants that may not be amplifiable by PCR (our unpublished results). Interestingly, astroviruses, which are known to induce enteritis in human have also recently been associated with encephalitis in the context of profound humoral deficiency, underlining the intestine as a reservoir for neurotropic viruses [25a], [25b], [25c]. Another example of virus associated with gastrointestinal infections leading to meningitis and encephalitis are parechoviruses, and in particular human Parechovirus 3\n[26].",

            "text": "The human gut virome is also composed of animal viruses transmitted by the oral route by consumption of contaminated food. Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is typically responsible for acute hepatitis in humans. Genotypes 1 and 2 are human specific but type 3 and type 4 have a reservoir in pigs [27]. The virus can be seen as a typical zoonotic virus in the context of acute infections. Nevertheless, long-term chronic infections have been described in immunocompromised patients, highlighting the importance of the host-immune status on virome composition and its potentially pathogenic properties [28], [29]. Animal genotypes 3 and 4 frequently infect humans from the animal reservoir (up to 50% of the population is antibody positive in some areas [30]), and might be adapting to humans. The situation is puzzling for gyroviruses. The first gyrovirus in humans (HGyV), which is part of the Circoviridae family, was initially found by NGS at the surface of the skin of healthy people [31]. It was later shown that different gyroviruses, including a very similar virus, AGV2, are very prevalent in chickens and in human stools [32], [33]. This owns to cross-species transmission of gyroviruses and their replication in humans, or alternatively to passive transit of animal viruses via food intake, as has been observed for plant viruses [6]. Within the Circoviridae family, the cycloviruses constitute a new genus and are found in the feces of humans and other animal species, pose similar questions as gyroviruses. [34]. It is noteworthy that gyroviruses harbor an apoptin gene, which encodes a protein that has the rare property of being specifically cytotoxic for cancer cells. Indeed, natural infection could be of benefit in controlling the development of tumor cells [35], in particular colon cancer (Table 21.1\n).\n",
