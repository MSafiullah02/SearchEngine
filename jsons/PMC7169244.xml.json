The goal was to examine the efficacy of the photochemically treated product in terms of a corrected count increment (CCI), while also monitoring haemostasis and adverse events.

However, 1\u2010 h CCI and total number of transfused products varied significantly, favouring the control arm. Closer examination revealed that products treated with amotosalen\u2010UVA had a lower concentration of platelets (<3\u00b70 \u00d7 1011). Interestingly, the amotosalen\u2010UVA\u2010treated platelets were found to be associated with a lower number of transfusion reactions than controls [11, 12, 13]. Cerus, manufacturer of INTERCEPT, also performed a radiolabelled PLT study in healthy volunteers comparing its product to a gamma\u2010irradiated control.

Therefore, INTERCEPT requirements are more stringent than those demanded by national guidelines: 30\u201345% for plasma ratio and <4 \u00d7 106 for RBC contamination, 2\u00b75\u20135\u00b70 \u00d7 1011 for platelet dose and 300\u2013390 ml for volume [17].

After 7 days of storage, the PLT count decreased by 7\u201310% in both study arms, a finding confirmed by multiple research teams [17, 18, 19, 20]. The PLT dose in amotosalen\u2010UVA\u2010treated PLTs is lower in part because of repeated transfers into different containers and to CAD filtration. Compared to controls, there was an 11% loss of volume and platelets alike in treated units [21].

It has been shown that these issues may be overcome by increasing initial platelet concentration or transfusing more PLT units. However, on a practical level, it would cause a burden on the limited PLT supply and also increase costs. In addition, with the more stringent requirements of the INTERCEPT system, there would be an additional loss of units that would otherwise have been available to patients. In the aforementioned study, 6 units of 25 (25%) initially fulfilled European quality requirements before but not after INTERCEPT treatment [21].",

Although storage variables clearly showed effects of riboflavin\u2010UVB treatment, apheresis PLTs retained cell quality during 5 days of storage without loss of mitochondria\u2010based oxidative respiration. Riboflavin\u2010UVB treatment increased glycolytic flux as well as respiratory/enzymatic activity but did not alter functional cell or mitochondrial integrity. This is in direct contrast to amotosalen\u2010UVA treatment. Because of increased glycolytic flux, there was evidence for accelerated glucose consumption, thereby increasing PLT acidity because of higher lactate production rates [22, 33]. Furthermore, the riboflavin\u2010UVB\u2010treated platelets remained comparable to untreated controls throughout 7 days of storage for ATP maintenance and in\u2010vitro function (swirl, HSR, aggregation, annexin A5 release, adhesion under flow conditions).",

            "text": "Universal leukoreduction has been introduced in Europe countries around the year 2000. In many other countries and the United States, it has been a topic of debate. Many centres favour removing residual white\u2010blood\u2010cells (WBC) because it reduces the risk of postoperative infection and improves post\u2010transfusion survival through reduction in transfusion\u2010related immunomodulation (TRIM) [34]. Leukoreduction is also beneficial to patients prone to receive multiple transfusions or a transplant as there are lower rates of alloimmunization, decreased episodes of refractoriness to platelet tranfusions and fewer febrile reactions [35, 36]. Multiple studies have proven that leukoreduction prevents CMV transmission [37]. Leukoreduction by filtration is commonly used, reliable, yet time consuming. Some research teams have investigated the possibility of using PI/PR systems as a means of reducing or inactivating leucocytes within the PC. Specifically, the riboflavin\u2010UVB treatment is able to functionally prevent immunological consequences because of WBC presence. Mirasol PRT treatment inhibited activation in response to stimuli or allogeneic stimulator cells. Mirasol PRT treatment also prevented the cells\u2019 ability to act as antigen\u2010presenting cells and the ability to produce cytokines in response to stimuli such as LPS or anti\u2010CD3+ anti\u2010CD28 [38].

In a study on the effects of riboflavin\u2010UVB treatment on CD3+ cells in Rag2\u2212/\u2212gamma c\u2212/\u2212 double knockout mice (xenogeneic), GVHD induction rates in Mirasol\u2010treated and untreated cells were determined. 85\u00b77% of control mice (12/14) developed xenogeneic GVHD, compared to 0% (0/14) of riboflavin\u2010UVB\u2010treated mice [40].

PI/PR technologies are pro\u2010active, rather than the historical reactive strategies. Turning theory into practice is filled with challenges. Laboratory research has shown that platelets counts are lowered by the procedure, most likely because of a combination of apoptosis, platelet storage lesion, as well as loss consequent to processing. This, in turn, has translated into lower corrected count increments (CCI) and higher transfusion rates in some clinical studies. However, PI/PR holds promise of many practical advantages such as immediate protection from emerging pathogens before identification and defence against bacterial contamination, thus leading to an improved safeguard of the blood supply. In addition, there are advantages such as the elimination of gamma\u2010irradiation of platelets, possibly prolonged storage of platelets for up to 7 days and decreased adverse transfusion reactions. Thus, implementation into routine use may confer manifold rewards but will first necessitate further study, both in the laboratory as well as the hospital.",
