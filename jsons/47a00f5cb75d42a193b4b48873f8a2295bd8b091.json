This chapter offers a summary of the epidemiological literature that has linked RV infection with acute exacerbations, and Table 6 .1 refers to the key references establishing the importance of RV infection in exacerbations of chronic respiratory diseases. Through a range of postulated mechanisms, RV infection elicits a complex host response that in part, may actually contribute to disease pathology and perpetuate symptoms rather than prevent virus infection and the associated symptoms. Whether or not RV infection directly triggers these events that add to, synergize with, or change the nature of the host response that drive disease, or whether the underlying disease makes certain individuals susceptible to RV infection is a pertinent question in the field. This chapter includes an in-depth commentary on the reasons why RV is the most common viral pathogen associated with exacerbations of these diseases; including the impact of current and emerging treatments on the outcome of RV infections and disease progression.

Responses to treatments, such as glucocorticosteroids (GCs) and bronchodilators, may also vary, and be categorized as well, partial, or poorly controlled. The most common endophenotype is Th2/type 2 associated or allergic asthma, which is defined by a physician's diagnosis of asthma often associated with high serum Immunoglobulin E (IgE) levels, positive skin prick tests to aeroallergens, and/or confirmed diagnosis of an atopic disorder such as allergic rhinitis. Evidence of interleukin (IL)-5, IL-4, or IL-13 driven inflammation, or increased levels of eosinophils in blood or lower airway samples, or high levels of FeNO may also confirm Th2 or type-2 associated asthma. Other asthma endophenotypes may exist, including adult-onset asthma; steroid resistant, poorly steroid responsive, or neutrophilic asthma; fixed airflow limitation asthma; or more simply termed type 2 low asthma. However, these are not as well defined by genetic analysis or biomarkers as allergic asthma. 11, 12 Currently, the exact nature or existence of these subgroups is vigorously debated. 13, 14 Erroneous diagnosis, effects of treatments, and other confounders have led to a lack of consensus. The identification of correct asthma endophenotypes and implementation of precise medicine approaches represents an important ongoing challenge to the field. Asthma exacerbations (AE) are defined when a stable individual with asthma suddenly becomes uncontrolled, experiences increased symptoms resulting in General practitioner (GP) consultation or hospitalization, and additional treatment including oral GCs. In the United States, there are approximately 1.6 M emergency room visits associated with asthma each year, 15, 16 and approximately 5% of asthmatic individuals have at least one AE per year. 17 AE may have multiple predictors; however recent AE history is the strongest predictor for a future AE event. In children, the number of allergic sensitization triggers and race are other important predictors. 18 AE are more common in individuals with poor lung function, or who are classified as having severe or difficult to treat asthma, which may comprise up to 15% of all asthmatics. 18, 19 AE may be life threatening, and results in significant morbidity worldwide including school/study absenteeism and sick leave. Recent economic studies have shown that individuals suffering from AE have increased both total healthcare and asthma specific healthcare costs, when compared with individuals who do not experience AE. 20 In unadjusted total costs, individuals that experience AE may accrue costs of .$9000 USD per year, compared with approximately $5000 USD per year for individuals who do not. AE are triggered by many factors; however respiratory virus infections are the most common, associated with up to 85% of AE in both adults and children. 21\u00c023 Historically, detection methods for viruses in respiratory clinical samples such as nasal secretions and throat swabs relied on in vitro cell culture based methods. This approach had limitations not least of which was the inability to propagate many clinically important viruses-including a significant number (approximately 40% based on current classification) of RVs we now know to belong to the RV-C species.

However, the recent update of the Global Burden of Disease has led to an agreed number of 328 million people having COPD worldwide, which includes 168 million men and 160 million women. 43 The exact threshold for the duration/intensity of cigarette smoking that will result in COPD varies between individuals. In the absence of a predisposing factor (e.g., genetic, environmental, or occupational), smoking less than 10\u00c015 pack-years of cigarettes is unlikely to result in COPD. Alternatively, the single best predictor for airflow obstruction is a history of more than 40 pack-years of smoking [positive likelihood ratio, 12 (95% CI, 2.7\u00c050)]. 44 As is the case with most chronic lung conditions, the disease course includes chronic respiratory symptoms such as wheeze and breathlessness, punctuated by periods of increased symptomatology, known as acute exacerbations. 45 Acute exacerbations (COPD-E) are significant events in COPD, as they accelerate disease progression, impair quality of life, and are the predominant cause of mortality. Additionally, they often necessitate unscheduled healthcare visits, treatment costs, and hospitalizations, which account for $18 billion in direct costs annually in the United States alone. 46, 47 Preventing COPD-E is a major unmet therapeutic goal.

Certainly the \"commonness\" and ease of transmission of the common cold virus; the fact there are any number of 160 1 antigenically distinct viruses circulating at any one time is important. Furthermore, other factors that contribute to the predominance of RV in exacerbation of chronic respiratory diseases can be broadly described as follows: the ability of RV to (1) induce inflammation, nervous provocation, airway remodeling or repair processes, and airway mucus production; (2) synergize or add to ongoing, established inflammation (e.g., allergic or type-2 mediated immune pathways in asthma); (3) promote or contribute to secondary bacterial infections by degrading antimicrobial defenses (epithelial junctional proteins and airway barrier integrity and antimicrobial peptides); and (4) expose impaired or aberrant host antiviral innate immunity that is either intrinsic or caused by treatment regimes. It is likely that RV meets one or more of these criteria in a manner that makes it qualitatively different from other respiratory viruses. In the case of asthma, RV, or certain subtypes of RV, have been referred to as \"asthmagenic viruses\" 95 due to their ability to be associated with AE more readily than other respiratory viruses. In one recent study, RV was described as exacerbating existing asthma, while the effects of influenza infection, which in terms of symptoms were quite different and more systemic, were described as asthma-augmented influenza infection, 96 supporting the idea that the nature of RV infection may be distinct from other respiratory viruses. In this section, the characteristics of RV infection that may explain its predominance in exacerbations of chronic respiratory diseases will be given due attention. Table 6 .3 offers a summary. 1. Induction of inflammation, nervous provocation, airway remodeling or repair processes, and airway mucus production. A key feature of RV and other respiratory viruses in promoting exacerbations is their ability to induce either lung inflammation, nervous provocation, or in the case of asthma and IPF, lung injury, repair, or remodeling. Many of the innate receptors that recognize RV, including Toll-like receptors (TLRs), RIG-I like helicases, and nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain (NOD)-like receptors, activate the NF-\u03baB family of transcription factors, which induce over 100 proinflammatory and host response genes. 97 RV, RSV, and influenza induce a range of proinflammatory cytokines, chemokines, growth factors, and adhesion molecules and mucins, 98 thus contributing to lung inflammation. The ability to promote lung inflammation is important in diseases where lung inflammation is key, and includes asthma, CF, and COPD. Mucins cause mucous plugging of the airway while cytokines facilitate cellular chemotaxis, activation, and proliferation of immune cells in the infected airway. 36,99,100 RV can increase airway hyperresponsiveness by increasing 5-lipoxygenase and the cyclooxygenase pathway enzyme COX-2. 101 While not as well characterized as asthma, inflammation is relevant in COPD, with a surprisingly low number of in vitro studies comparing the responses of cells from COPD patients to viral infection with those from healthy controls. 64, 102, 103 Similarly the few available studies examining naturally occurring virus-induced COPD exacerbations have demonstrated a role for inflammatory cells such as neutrophils and eosinophils 6 and proinflammatory mediators such as CXCL8/IL-8, CXCL-10/IP-10, and CCL-5/RANTES. 55, 69, 104 Experimental RV infection studies in COPD have indicated that RV induces airway neutrophilic inflammation and innate inflammatory meditators such as IL-1\u03b2, GM-CSF, CXCL8/IL-8, and TNF. 64, 70, 105 These, and other in vitro studies, 102 indicate an enhanced inflammatory response to virus infection in COPD subjects and this may be one mechanism whereby viruses induce exacerbations. The role of neutrophils is incompletely understood. While having the ability to damage tissues and contribute to airway inflammation, they undoubtedly have important roles in antibacterial defense, may produce type I IFNs, 106 and in mouse models, may have antiviral properties. 107 Of interest, a recent Phase 2a clinical trial of AZD5069, an inhibitor of the neutrophil chemokine receptor CXCR2, failed to affect severe AE rate, lung function of asthma control questionnaire (ACQ) score. 108 The mechanisms of viral-induced CF-E and increased clinical illness are not well characterized with inconsistent results from published studies. Whilst some groups have demonstrated increased production of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines by airway epithelial cells obtained from CF patients compared with healthy controls, 81, 109 others have failed to detect any differences. 110, 111 It is unclear what leads to these contrasting observations. RV infection has been shown to damage and compromise the integrity of the airway; through infecting airway epithelial cells and directly causing cell death 112 and/or epithelial cell shedding. 113, 114 They can also affect epithelial permeability leading to increased airway inflammation and creating opportunities for increased secondary infections, 115 allergen uptake, 116 or exposure to environmental pollutants or irritants; all of which may trigger exacerbations of chronic respiratory diseases. In terms of nervous provocation, RV has recently been shown to upregulate the transient receptor potential (TRP) channel family members TRPA1 and TRPV1 in neuroblastoma cells 117 and may be important in the cough response 65 and sensitivity to methacholine 118 observed during infection.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1616, "end": 1618, "text": "96", "ref_id": "BIBREF78"}, {"start": 2544, "end": 2546, "text": "97", "ref_id": "BIBREF79"}, {"start": 3142, "end": 3145, "text": "101", "ref_id": "BIBREF83"}, {"start": 3379, "end": 3382, "text": "64,", "ref_id": "BIBREF46"}, {"start": 3383, "end": 3387, "text": "102,", "ref_id": "BIBREF84"}, {"start": 3388, "end": 3391, "text": "103", "ref_id": "BIBREF85"}, {"start": 3575, "end": 3576, "text": "6", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 3660, "end": 3663, "text": "55,", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}, {"start": 3664, "end": 3667, "text": "69,", "ref_id": "BIBREF51"}, {"start": 3668, "end": 3671, "text": "104", "ref_id": "BIBREF86"}, {"start": 3857, "end": 3860, "text": "64,", "ref_id": "BIBREF46"}, {"start": 3861, "end": 3864, "text": "70,", "ref_id": "BIBREF52"}, {"start": 3865, "end": 3868, "text": "105", "ref_id": "BIBREF87"}, {"start": 3904, "end": 3907, "text": "102", "ref_id": "BIBREF84"}, {"start": 4278, "end": 4281, "text": "106", "ref_id": "BIBREF88"}, {"start": 4334, "end": 4337, "text": "107", "ref_id": "BIBREF89"}, {"start": 4545, "end": 4548, "text": "108", "ref_id": "BIBREF90"}, {"start": 4881, "end": 4884, "text": "81,", "ref_id": "BIBREF63"}, {"start": 4885, "end": 4888, "text": "109", "ref_id": "BIBREF91"}, {"start": 4935, "end": 4939, "text": "110,", "ref_id": "BIBREF92"}, {"start": 4940, "end": 4943, "text": "111", "ref_id": "BIBREF93"}, {"start": 5160, "end": 5163, "text": "112", "ref_id": "BIBREF94"}, {"start": 5197, "end": 5201, "text": "113,", "ref_id": "BIBREF95"}, {"start": 5202, "end": 5205, "text": "114", "ref_id": "BIBREF96"}, {"start": 5355, "end": 5358, "text": "115", "ref_id": "BIBREF97"}, {"start": 5376, "end": 5379, "text": "116", "ref_id": "BIBREF98"}, {"start": 5681, "end": 5684, "text": "117", "ref_id": "BIBREF99"}, {"start": 5728, "end": 5730, "text": "65", "ref_id": "BIBREF47"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1884, "end": 1891, "text": "Table 6", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}], "section": "CHARACTERISTICS OF RHINOVIRUS THAT MAY PROMOTE EXACERBATIONS OF CHRONIC RESPIRATORY DISEASES"}, {"text": "RV can also induce mediators required for airway repair, which results in airway scarring or remodeling. These processes include angiogenesis, increased ASM proliferation and hypertrophy, and thicker basement membranes owing to collagen and fibronectin deposition as well as the generation of new lymphatic vessels that ultimately result in thicker airway walls and reduced lung function; the importance of these process is obvious in asthma. Whether or not RV infection directly initiates this process is unclear; however, RV can induce some of these proangiogenic mediators including fibroblast growth factor and vascular endothelial growth factor, 119\u00c0121 required for fibrosis in IPF, and the structural proteins perlecan and collagen 122 the building blocks of airway remodeling. 2. Viruses synergize or add to ongoing, established inflammation. Evidence for this property is greatest for RV infections in asthma, where a synergy between viral infections and allergen sensitization and exposure was first realized through epidemiological studies 123, 124 and additional evidence for this interaction has been gained in both human challenge 36,37 and mouse models of RV. 39,40,125\u00c0127 In individuals with asthma, RV infection of the bronchial epithelium also likely has additive and synergistic effects on allergen sensitization and challenge as the epithelial derived pro-Th2 factors IL-33, IL-25, and thymic stromal lymphopoietin, which activate Th2 cells, DCs, and type 2 innate lymphoid cells, are induced readily by RV infection. 37, 126, 128 This now allows a direct link to how respiratory virus infection of the airway epithelium can augment existing Th2 pathways in asthma.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1051, "end": 1055, "text": "123,", "ref_id": "BIBREF105"}, {"start": 1056, "end": 1059, "text": "124", "ref_id": "BIBREF106"}, {"start": 1539, "end": 1542, "text": "37,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1543, "end": 1547, "text": "126,", "ref_id": "BIBREF108"}, {"start": 1548, "end": 1551, "text": "128", "ref_id": "BIBREF110"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "CHARACTERISTICS OF RHINOVIRUS THAT MAY PROMOTE EXACERBATIONS OF CHRONIC RESPIRATORY DISEASES"}, {"text": "Whether or not increased RV disease burden in asthma is simply a result of a type 2 skewed environment or whether RV contributes to type 2 inflammation is a wider debate that is often discussed in asthma onset. 23, 129 Concerning AE, RV is perhaps most easily understood as a direct contributor to established type 2 inflammation as discussed above, the results of which tip the fine balance between stable asthma and increased symptoms leading to AE. A study of cohabiting asthma and nonasthmatic pairs in the 1990s found that while the frequency of RV infection was not different between asthmatics and healthy volunteers, asthmatics had a more severe and longer duration of lower airway symptoms, 2 consistent with the concept that individuals with asthma may not be prone to greater number of RV infections, but deal with the infection in a fundamentally different manner from nonasthmatic individuals. Further studies using RV experimental challenge generally show that asthmatics and nonasthmatics have equal rates of successful infection, 36,37 while asthmatics generate greater lower airway symptom scores, which increase with decreased asthma control. 130 How underlying type 2 immunity and allergic inflammation may influence the course of RV infection is another matter, and will be discussed in detail below. 3. To promote or contribute to secondary bacterial infections by degrading antimicrobial defenses. The ability to promote secondary bacterial infection is most relevant for AE, or wheeze in children, COPD-E, and CF-E. As RV can disrupt the integrity of the airway epithelium, and reduce antibacterial cytokine responses 131 and degrade antimicrobial peptides, 132 this may promote secondary bacterial infection including enhanced dispersal, 115 further infiltration and colonization of bacterial species that may already be present at low level. In AE in children, RV can increase Moraxella abundance. 133, 134 In CF, exacerbations associated with a respiratory viral infection are associated with increased bacterial load, 135 although not all studies report this association. 136 Viral and bacterial infections are common in COPD-E but when the role of dual virus\u00c0bacterial was previously considered studies appeared to indicate that it does not play a prominent role in COPD-E with low detection rates ranging from 6.5% 62 up to only 27%. 6, 63, 67 However, Papi et al. did observe that exacerbations with dual infection are more severe. 6 Then, in a study of experimental RV infection, secondary bacterial infections were detected in 60% of COPD patients with confirmed RV infection, 132 and increases in proteobacterial DNA sequences, including the potentially pathogenic Haemophilus influenzae have been reported. 66 Crucially viruses and bacteria were detected at separate time points with a pattern of virus infection occurring first and bacterial infection later. The implications were that studies of naturally occurring exacerbations that collect samples at a single time point are underestimating the true incidence of dual infection, and are likely missing secondary infections. This was confirmed in a more recent study of naturally occurring exacerbations in which patients were sampled at two time points during an exacerbation. When RV was initially detected but bacteria were absent, 73% had a bacteria detected when sampled again at day 14. 49 There is also evidence that dual virus\u00c0bacterial infection contributes to COPD-E severity. In those COPD patients with H. influenzae detected at exacerbation, the presence of a symptomatic cold was associated with higher bacterial loads, 137 and in hospitalized patients with COPD-E, dual virus\u00c0bacterial infection correlated with impaired lung function and longer hospital stay. 6 During experimental RV infection, coinfection was associated with prolonged lower respiratory symptoms. 132 In summary, the role of dual virus\u00c0bacterial infections in COPD exacerbations is likely to have been overlooked and may be an important factor contributing to the severity of COPD exacerbations. 4. To expose impaired or aberrant host antiviral innate immunity that is either intrinsic or caused by treatment regimes. One example is that the above chronic respiratory diseases are associated in some way with impaired antiviral immunity. A striking example is the effects of type 2 mediated allergic inflammation in allergic asthma on the antiviral Interferon (IFN) response. Deficient type I and type III IFNs have been associated with upregulated type 2 pathways 138 that involve the presence of IgE, 139, 140 skin prick test (SPTs), 141 or eosinophilic inflammation, 142 and it is believed this may be the root cause of impaired antiviral immunity, potentially resulting in higher virus loads, 37 and ultimately increased symptoms and worse lung function. Several studies have observed impaired IFN in cells derived from people with asthma. Not all studies have observed this 143, 144 and differences could be accounted for by different culture methods, virus stocks, asthma severity, 145 or unappreciated subtle differences in the asthma endophenotypes of the donors. In support of these ex vivo findings, virus load is higher in individuals with atopic asthma compared with nonasthmatics following experimental RV challenge; 37 and recently, bronchial epithelial IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 staining by immunohistochemistry was impaired in individuals with atopic asthma, and was inversely related to increased clinical symptoms and increased virus load following experimental RV challenge. 106 Mechanisms associated with impaired IFN include the crosslinking of IgE on DCs derived from people with asthma prevents virus-induced IFN-\u03b1 production; 139 BECs derived from people with asthma have been shown to have higher expression levels of suppressor of cytokine signaling-1, which when nuclear, prevents virus-induced IFN-\u03b2 and IFN\u03bb production. 146 Macrophages may recognize respiratory viruses via TLR7, and TLR7 expression is deficient in macrophages, 147 and bronchial tissue 40 from people with asthma and may explain why their cells are also impaired in IFN production during viral infection.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 211, "end": 214, "text": "23,", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 215, "end": 218, "text": "129", "ref_id": "BIBREF111"}, {"start": 1161, "end": 1164, "text": "130", "ref_id": "BIBREF112"}, {"start": 1641, "end": 1644, "text": "131", "ref_id": "BIBREF113"}, {"start": 1762, "end": 1765, "text": "115", "ref_id": "BIBREF97"}, {"start": 1923, "end": 1927, "text": "133,", "ref_id": "BIBREF115"}, {"start": 1928, "end": 1931, "text": "134", "ref_id": "BIBREF116"}, {"start": 2045, "end": 2048, "text": "135", "ref_id": "BIBREF117"}, {"start": 2099, "end": 2102, "text": "136", "ref_id": "BIBREF118"}, {"start": 2363, "end": 2365, "text": "6,", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 2366, "end": 2369, "text": "63,", "ref_id": "BIBREF45"}, {"start": 2370, "end": 2372, "text": "67", "ref_id": "BIBREF49"}, {"start": 2462, "end": 2463, "text": "6", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 2609, "end": 2612, "text": "132", "ref_id": "BIBREF114"}, {"start": 2741, "end": 2743, "text": "66", "ref_id": "BIBREF48"}, {"start": 3381, "end": 3383, "text": "49", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}, {"start": 3622, "end": 3625, "text": "137", "ref_id": "BIBREF119"}, {"start": 3764, "end": 3765, "text": "6", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 3870, "end": 3873, "text": "132", "ref_id": "BIBREF114"}, {"start": 4576, "end": 4580, "text": "139,", "ref_id": "BIBREF121"}, {"start": 4581, "end": 4584, "text": "140", "ref_id": "BIBREF122"}, {"start": 4609, "end": 4612, "text": "141", "ref_id": "BIBREF123"}, {"start": 4643, "end": 4646, "text": "142", "ref_id": "BIBREF124"}, {"start": 4952, "end": 4956, "text": "143,", "ref_id": "BIBREF125"}, {"start": 4957, "end": 4960, "text": "144", "ref_id": "BIBREF126"}, {"start": 5061, "end": 5064, "text": "145", "ref_id": "BIBREF127"}, {"start": 5549, "end": 5552, "text": "106", "ref_id": "BIBREF88"}, {"start": 5705, "end": 5708, "text": "139", "ref_id": "BIBREF121"}, {"start": 5904, "end": 5907, "text": "146", "ref_id": "BIBREF128"}, {"start": 6013, "end": 6016, "text": "147", "ref_id": "BIBREF129"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "CHARACTERISTICS OF RHINOVIRUS THAT MAY PROMOTE EXACERBATIONS OF CHRONIC RESPIRATORY DISEASES"}, {"text": "Other than direct, cell culture based studies where IFN transcripts or protein are measured following ex vivo virus infection, an alternative method of perceiving impaired IFN in individuals with asthma is to use large transcriptomic studies.

Therefore, this idea remains a compelling hypothesis. In support, a recent study of over 300 children from a birth cohort study found that cluster analysis of ex vivo responses in peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMCs) at age 11 to different viruses and TLR ligands were related to asthma at ages through to age 16.

In the experimental RV infection studies in COPD, virus load was higher in the COPD subjects compared with non-COPD subjects. 64, 70 This suggests that the mechanisms controlling viral replication are defective in COPD as all subjects were inoculated with the same intranasal virus dose. Despite this, it remains unclear whether production of IFN is impaired in all COPD patients. Ex vivo RV stimulated macrophages from COPD subjects produce less IFN compared with non-COPD subjects; 64 however, not all studies have supported this observation, with similar 103 and even increased 102 IFN production reported in cells obtained from COPD subjects. A recent study also observed impaired IFN-\u03b2 induction in response to influenza virus infection. The failure to robustly induce IFN-\u03b2 transcription was thought due to a lack of protein kinase R expression and lack of formation of the IFN-\u03b2 enhanceosome at the IFN-\u03b2 promoter. 151 The presence of RV during CF exacerbations may also be attributed to impaired antiviral immunity. One possibility is the CF epithelium is intrinsically proinflammatory or alternatively antiviral innate immune responses in CF cells are inherently deficient. Zheng et al. support the premise that impaired innate host defense causes susceptibility to viral infections in patients with CF highlighting increased replication following PIV infection of cultured airway epithelial cells from CF donors with correction by subsequent administration of IFN-\u03b1. 81 Although IFN responses were not impaired, there was reduced induction of nitric oxide synthase 2 (NOS2) in CF airway epithelial cells. NOS2 is important as it is required for production of nitric oxide (NO), which is a known antiviral mediator. Therefore, impaired NO synthesis may be one mechanism of impaired antiviral host responses in CF. Holtzman et al. hypothesized \"hypersusceptibility\" to virus infection, via defective IFN pathways, is a unifying pathway in asthma, COPD, and now CF. 152 The overriding hypothesis is that chronic airway inflammation, regardless of origin, interferes with innate immunity causing a suboptimal or blunted antiviral response that leads to an imbalanced host response reinforcing the preexisting predominant inflammatory phenotype. Viral exacerbations of IPF may also be a result of impaired antiviral immunity. A study of familial IPF has identified one way in which antiviral immunity can be affected in ILD. Genetic studies in six affected families identified a gene (ELMOD2). 153 Further work has demonstrated that ELMOD2 is involved in type I and III IFN induction in response to TLR3 activation, an important part of the innate immune response to viruses including RV. 154 ", "cite_spans": [{"start": 210, "end": 213, "text": "64,", "ref_id": "BIBREF46"}, {"start": 214, "end": 216, "text": "70", "ref_id": "BIBREF52"}, {"start": 568, "end": 570, "text": "64", "ref_id": "BIBREF46"}, {"start": 1006, "end": 1009, "text": "151", "ref_id": "BIBREF133"}, {"start": 1561, "end": 1563, "text": "81", "ref_id": "BIBREF63"}, {"start": 2057, "end": 2060, "text": "152", "ref_id": "BIBREF134"}, {"start": 2583, "end": 2586, "text": "153", "ref_id": "BIBREF135"}, {"start": 2778, "end": 2781, "text": "154", "ref_id": "BIBREF136"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "CHARACTERISTICS OF RHINOVIRUS THAT MAY PROMOTE EXACERBATIONS OF CHRONIC RESPIRATORY DISEASES"}, {"text": "Medications used to treat patients with chronic respiratory diseases affect immunity and airway function and therefore have the potential to modify the response to RV and affect disease outcomes.
