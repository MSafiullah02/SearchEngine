Most patients reported in the literature were adults, and adult patients commonly presented as pneumonia with abnormal findings on chest CT [3\u20136]. Elderly men with comorbidities were more likely to exacerbate with severe and even fatal respiratory diseases such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) [3\u20135]. The Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention reported 72,314 COVID-19 patients as of February 11, 2020. Among the 44,672 confirmed cases, 416 cases were aged 0\u201310 years [7]. However, literature reports on pediatric patients are limited [8, 9]. Herein, we report two children with confirmed COVID-19 from two family clusters. This paper will help pediatricians early recognize pedaitric cases with COVID-19.",

The two patients had different clinical presentations; however, both tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Case 1 presented as an upper respiratory tract infection, and Case 2 presented with mild diarrhea only. Compared with their parents and to previous reported adults with COVID-19, the two cases in our study showed relatively mild clinical manifestations and recovered soon. Their chest CTs were normal. The clinical features in these two patients are different from previous reports in pediatric cases. A report of a family cluster demonstrated an asymptomatic child (aged 10 years) had radiological ground-glass lung opacities and positive SARS-CoV-2 test [8]. And another report demonstrated an infected case with very severe pneumonia [9]. These reports showed that children infected with SARS-CoV-2 may have variable symptoms, which may be partly related to the previous health status and interval from onset to consultation and comorbidities. Experts recently have formulated a recommendation for the diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19 in children, which is of paramount important for clinical practice [10, 11]. Owing to the limited number of pediatric cases and experiences, these recommendations or guidelines were based mainly on standards and experiences with adult patients [10]. Additional data from pediatric cases need to be collected to further recognize the clinical features of COVID-19 in children.",
