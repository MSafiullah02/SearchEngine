The reference guide also clarified the criteria for starting treatment for ITP, as well as the treatment target and presented a flowchart of treatment, with corticosteroids as first-line treatment, splenectomy as second-line and other treatments as third-line, together with the respective recommendation levels. The basic concepts of management of adult ITP have not changed significantly since that time, and the 2012 reference guide remains adequately effective. However, in the reference guide, thrombopoietin receptor agonists (TPO-RAs) were positioned as third-line treatment, as these products had only recently been approved in Japan. Since then, we have accumulated experience in the use of these drugs, and their long-term efficacy and safety continue to become clear. Furthermore, in 2017, the indications for rituximab, which has been positioned as second-line treatment in Europe and the US, were extended to adult ITP in Japan. Conversely, the number of patients undergoing splenectomy is declining, and there is an increasingly large divergence between decisions made in clinical practice and the reference guide regarding the selection of second-line treatment for patients resistant to corticosteroids. There is also an accumulation of new evidence on ITP treatment, including administration methods for corticosteroids used as first-line treatment, namely high-dose dexamethasone (HD-DEX).",

The most significant revision is the new recommendation of TPO-RAs, rituximab,b and splenectomy as second-line treatment, in addition to recommending that each treatment is selected on a case-by-case basis, in line with the patient's conditions and lifestyle. These revisions were drafted and discussed by the \"Reference Guide for management of adult ITP\" preparatory committee, and were created based on the opinions of the researchers and research collaborators on Blood Coagulation Abnormalities Research Team, Research on Rare and Intractable Disease. The main aim of this reference guide is for it to be effectively used in clinical practice, so we also created some practical questions together with recommendation based on literature searches and opinions of the committee. The recommendation levels for each treatment were determined using the GRADE system (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation), as used in the previous reference guide (Table 1 ) [2] . Please refer to previously published our Consensus Report in the case of management of ITP with pregnancy [3] . We hope that this 2019 revised reference guide will be utilized effectively by physicians who manage ITP patients every day.",

The anti-platelet autoantibodies also induce maturation failure and apoptosis of megakaryocytes, leading to impairment of platelet production. In addition to anti-platelet autoantibodies, immune complexes, complement and cytotoxic T cells may also play a role in thrombocytopenia [4, [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] . Thus, ITP is regarded as a syndrome that involves various immunological abnormalities, and ITP treatment mainly aims to (i) inhibit production of anti-platelet autoantibodies, (ii) inhibit platelet destruction and phagocytosis, and (iii) recover platelet production. However, at present, the inability to accurately ascertain the mechanism of thrombocytopenia of individual patients is an impediment for treatment selection.",

            "text": "Medical interview and examination findings The medical interview should confirm the clinical course of thrombocytopenia and bleeding symptoms, whether the patient had an antecedent infection, the status of complications and concomitant medication, and family history. The medical interview should also take note of the presence/absence of bleeding symptoms and the characteristics of these symptoms. The purpura seen in ITP often ranges from petechiae to ecchymosis. Mucosal bleeding (epistaxis, gastrointestinal bleeding, hematuria, etc.) is often seen in serious cases of thrombocytopenia, where the platelet count has fallen to \u2264 10,000/\u03bcL, and fatal cerebral hemorrhage occurs in around 1% of adult cases and around 0.4% of pediatric cases [12] . Deep bleeding, such as intraarticular bleeding and intramuscular bleeding, is rare. Many adult cases with chronic ITP lack bleeding symptoms. Laboratory tests i. Peripheral blood: it is important to carefully monitor peripheral blood smears together with the blood count. Platelet aggregates are seen in pseudothrombocytopenia. The size of the platelets often increases in ITP, but when there is a notable increase in giant platelets, the condition may be caused by Bernard-Soulier syndrome or MYH9-related disorders (May-Hegglin anomaly, etc.). The presence of schistocytes is suggestive of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) or disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). ii. Bone marrow examination: bone marrow examination is important to rule out leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), as well as thrombocytopenia caused by bone marrow hypoplasia, but there are no findings specific to ITP and it is not considered to be an essential for the diagnosis of ITP [13] . However, the examination of bone marrow should be performed to rule out other diseases when abnormalities are found in erythrocytes or leukocytes, or in patients resistant to ITP treatments. iii. Percentage of reticulated platelets (RP%) and plasma (serum) thrombopoietin (TPO) concentration: The platelet lifespan is shortened in ITP, so the RP%, which shows the percentage of immature young platelets, is often high in ITP patients [14, 15] . The percentage of immature platelet fraction (IPF%), measured with an automated blood cell counter, is equally useful as RP% [16] . The plasma (serum) TPO concentration stays within the normal range to slightly elevated in ITP, but it is markedly high in thrombocytopenia caused by bone marrow hypoplasia. These tests may be useful for differentiating ITP from hypoplastic thrombocytopenia such as aplastic anemia [14, 15, 17] , but they are not covered by Japanese health insurance.",

[19] which demonstrated that platelet count increases after eradication of H. pylori in adult ITP patients, the effect of this treatment for ITP has been demonstrated in a large number of retrospective and prospective observational studies. Meta-analysis has also been implemented, and it has been proven that the platelet count increases with successful eradication in adult ITP cases infected with H. pylori [20] [21] [22] . Studies conducted in Japan have reported that platelet response is obtained in about 50-70% of patients in cases treated with eradication therapy. In cases where the platelet count recovers to \u2265 100,000/\u03bcL, few recurrences occur in the long-term follow-up, not only in mild cases but also in refractory cases not responsive to splenectomy [23] . Patients responsive to H. pylori eradication therapy have reduced production of anti-platelet antibodies, suggesting that their autoimmune pathophysiology is suppressed by eradication [24] . Therefore, within ITP, there is a unique subtype in which H. pylori infection is significantly involved in the pathology. This type is called H. pylori-associated ITP and is classified as secondary ITP in Europe and the US. H. pylori eradication therapy is more effective than corticosteroids, at least in Japan, and has fewer adverse reactions, so the 2012 reference guide recommends testing for H. pylori infection in all patients diagnosed with ITP and, if the patient is confirmed to be a carrier, that eradication therapy should be prioritized irrespective of the platelet count or bleeding symptoms [1] . In Japan, ITP was added to the indications of H. pylori eradication therapy in 2010.",

The efficacy rate is high, but continuous treatment is required except a few cases, and caution is needed regarding adverse drug reactions, such as thrombosis.

Efficacy A number of RCTs have been conducted, including studies conducted in Japan, for both romiplostim and eltrombopag on corticosteroid-resistant refractory ITP cases [53] [54] [55] [56] [57] [58] [59] [60] [61] [62] [63] . Meta-analyses that compiled the results of these RCTs found that both drugs significantly improved overall and continuous platelet response compared to the control group [64, 65] . A comparison of a group treated with splenectomy and a group not treated with splenectomy found that both drugs had slightly reduced reactivity in the splenectomy group, but they were still effective in \u2265 80% of cases (romiplostim: splenectomy group = 82%, non-splenectomy group = 91%, eltrombopag: splenectomy group = 80%, nonsplenectomy group = 89.3%) [53, 66] . The incidence of all bleeding events and critical bleeding events, and events that required emergency treatment were significantly lower in the TPO-RAs group, and there were also significantly more patients in the TPO-RAs group who were able to reduce the dose or stop concomitant medication altogether (mainly corticosteroids) [64, 65] . These results were also confirmed in large-scale observational studies in Europe [67, 68] . It was also reported that long-term remission was achieved even after stopping TPO-RAs for both romiplostim and eltrombopag in around 3-4% of patients in the clinical trials and around 10-20% of patients in subsequent retrospective reports [69] [70] [71] [72] . The mechanism of inducing remission with TPO-RAs is unknown, but possible mechanisms are as follows: (i) immunotolerance to platelet autoantigens may have been induced as a result of the increased platelet number by TPO-RAs or (ii) TPO-RAs may have improved the function of regulatory T cells (CD4+, CD25hi) [73, 74] . Thus, when the platelet count is maintained at \u2265 100,000/\u00b5L, reduction of the TPO-RAs dose may be considered, while monitoring fluctuations in platelet count.",

However, nearly all cases of thrombosis in users of eltrombopag, both arterial and venous thrombosis, occur within 1 year after starting treatment, and reports indicate that there are almost no new cases from 4 years post-treatment onwards [53] , thus, it is essential to be mindful of the onset of thrombosis, particularly in the early stages of TPO-RAs treatment. Use of TPO-RAs should be carefully considered in patients with congenital or acquired thrombophilia, namely, patients with a history of thrombosis, hypertension, smoking, obesity, diabetes, dyslipidemia, antiphospholipid antibodies, and in patients with cancer.",

In five RCTs on adult ITP patients [92] [93] [94] [95] [96] 46.8% of patients in the rituximab treatment group achieved a complete response with a platelet count of \u2265 100,000/\u03bcL, while this figure was 32.5% in the standard treatment group, suggesting that the rituximab group was superior, with a relative risk of 1.42 (95% CI: 1.13-1.77, p = 0.002). However, the percentage of patients who had a partial response with a platelet count of 30,000-50,000/\u03bcL was 57.6% in the rituximab group and 46.7% in the standard treatment group, with a relative risk of 1.26 (95% CI: 0.95-1.67, p = 0.11), indicating that there was no significant difference in the bleeding inhibition effect between the two groups. There was also no difference between the two groups in terms of onset of infection. In three of these five RCTs, rituximab was combined with dexamethasone and was compared with a dexamethasone monotherapy group, so the results reflect the additional effects of rituximab combined with dexamethasone [92, 93, 95] . In the remain-ing two RCTs, rituximab monotherapy was compared with saline infusion in a blinded manner, although both groups were permitted concomitant use of low-dose corticosteroids. These two studies address the clinical question as to whether rituximab is effective in corticosteroid-resistant or -dependent patients [94, 96] . There was no significant difference in any of the aforementioned indicators, including complete response rate, in the two RCTs. However, the time to relapse was significantly longer in the rituximab group compared to the placebo group (36 weeks vs 7 weeks, p = 0.01), so there are benefits for patients who respond to rituximab [96] . An investigator-initiated clinical trial in Japan found that 4 of 26 patients (14.5%) administered rituximab had a complete response, and 30.8% (95% CI: 14.3-51.8%) had a partial response with a platelet count of \u2265 50,000/\u03bcl [97] . This study was conducted in ITP patients resistant to other treatments and found that rituximab had a certain level of clinical efficacy.",

Other complications that require attention include infection and thrombosis (portal vein thrombosis, etc.) [126] . Infection The natural IgM antibodies required to eliminate encapsulated bacteria such as S. pneumoniae, N. meningitidis and H. influenzae are produced by B cells in the spleen. Therefore, the ability to defend against these bacteria is impaired after splenectomy, and there is an increased risk of overwhelming post-splenectomy infection (OPSI); thus, it is essential to prevent infection with appropriate vaccinations [127] . Post-splenectomy infections can become more serious than normal infections, so early treatment is essential. When the infection is suspected due to fever or other symptoms, promptly administer penicillin-based or new quinolone-based antibiotics and carefully monitor the patient for signs of the infection worsening. Many patients who undergo splenectomy are refractory cases who have had long-term treatment with immunosuppressants such as corticosteroids, so it is vital to be aware that some patients may have immunodeficiency associated with their previous treatments.",

Cyclophosphamide has been reported to have a 24-85% efficacy rate with 500-1000 mg/m 2 intravenous infusion repeated every 3-4 weeks, or 1-2 mg/kg/day oral administration [134, 138] . Adverse drug reactions include alopecia, myelosuppression, hemorrhagic cystitis, infertility, and secondary primary cancer. It is preferable to avoid administration in young patients who wish to become pregnant. 4. Diaminodiphenyl sulfone (dapsone, 4,4-diaminodiphenylsulphone, DDS. Recommendation level: 2C, not covered by Japanese health insurance). Diaminodiphenyl sulfone is known as a drug used to treat leprosy. The efficacy of this drug in treating ITP has been reported mainly from Europe since the 1990s, but the mechanism of action is unknown. According to a review published in 2013, which summarized eight small-scale prospective and retrospective studies, the efficacy rate is 40-60% and serious adverse drug reactions are reported to occur in \u2264 15% patients [139] . However, there are also reports that this drug has a lower efficacy rate (10-20%) [140, 141] . Known adverse drug reactions include hemolysis (DDS syndrome), hematopoietic disorders, and mucocutaneous disorders. 5. Danazol (recommendation level: 2C, not covered by Japanese health insurance). Reports on the efficacy of the testosterone derivative danazol for treating ITP appeared in the literature for more than 30 years [142] . The normal dose is 200-400 mg/day, but there are also reports of low-dose treatments (50-100 mg/day). Efficacy varies significantly, from 10 to 70% depending upon the report [134, 143] . A recently reported meta-analysis, which summarized the results of 12 reports and 224 cases, reported the efficacy as 58% (95% CI: 42-72%), and the complete response rate as 29% (19-42%), but many patients were administered 400-800 mg/day [144] . Adverse drug reactions include liver dysfunction, amenorrhea, thrombosis, hoarseness, hirsutism, and androgenization.",

Commentary Since Andersen et al. reported the therapeutic effect of HD-DEX (dexamethasone 40 mg/body 4 days) on refractory cases in 1994, there have been a number of reports investigating its efficacy for refractory cases, but the efficacy differs depending on the report, and no fixed opinion has been established [36-44].

Laparoscopic splenectomy is recommended as it is less invasive, has a shorter postoperative recovery time and fewer complications compared to standard [129]. Winslow et al. conducted a meta-analysis of 2119 LS cases and 821 OS cases [130]. The time required for surgery was significantly longer with LS, but the postoperative hospital stay was significantly shorter with LS (OS 7.2 days vs LS 3.6 days). The incidence of lung and wound complications and infections was also significantly lower with LS. Identification of the accessory spleen was equal in OS and LS. Based on the above findings, LS is recommended, but when bleeding cannot be controlled during LS, it may be necessary to transition to open surgery, so it is preferable to perform splenectomies in institutions with abundant experience in this procedure. Question. What kind of vaccinations should be used? Answer. Vaccinate the patient with a 23valent pneumococcal vaccine up to 4 weeks before splenectomy.",
