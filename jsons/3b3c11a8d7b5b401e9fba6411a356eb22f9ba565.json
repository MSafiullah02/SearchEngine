In addition, general alterations in metabolism can provide key understanding of pathogenesis. However, little is known about the specific metabolic effects of SARS-COV-2 infection. The present study evaluated the serum metabolism of COVID-19 patients (n=33), identified by a positive nucleic acid test of a nasopharyngeal swab, as compared to COVID-19-negative control patients (n=16). Targeted and untargeted metabolomics analyses specifically identified alterations in the metabolism of tryptophan into the kynurenine pathway, which is wellknown to be involved in regulating inflammation and immunity. Indeed, the observed changes in tryptophan metabolism correlated with serum interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels. Metabolomics analysis also confirmed widespread dysregulation of nitrogen metabolism in infected patients, with decreased circulating levels of most amino acids, except for tryptophan metabolites in the kynurenine pathway, and increased markers of oxidant stress (e.g., methionine sulfoxide, cystine), proteolysis, and kidney dysfunction (e.g., creatine, creatinine, polyamines). Increased circulating levels of glucose and free fatty acids were also observed, consistent with altered carbon homeostasis in COVID-19 patients.",

However, some subjects are more susceptible, by unknown mechanisms, to develop severe disease, especially older males with various comorbidities, including obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, or immunosuppression (e.g., cancer patients undergoing chemo-or radio-therapy, or transplant patients). In contrast, children, younger adults, and women tend to be either asymptomatic or present with mild disease, while still being contagious and contributing to viral transmission. As such, widespread testing, even of asymptomatic subjects, has been advocated as a strategy to monitor and prevent disease dissemination. Testing nasopharyngeal swabs with nucleic acid amplification assays was introduced worldwide to diagnose disease and monitor recovery; for example, Italy, one of the countries hit hardest by COVID-19, enforces quarantine of any positive subjects until they no longer show symptoms for at least 14 days and test negative twice within 24h. However, logistical issues have limited generalized testing in most countries, including the United States (<12,000 tests/million people) (4). Nonetheless, recent development of serological testing for antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 proteins suggest that a significantly larger fraction of the total population may have been infected than that identified by testing nasopharyngeal swabs (e.g., up to 85-fold higher than molecularly-confirmed cases) (5).

Large international initiatives (e.g., Solidarity II) propose to tackle this issue through homogeneous serological testing in 12 countries (6). At the center of this debate, serological testing detects antibodies against SARS-COV-2 proteins in patients who have recovered from infection. These patients are now being actively enrolled globally as \"convalescent\" plasma donors to determine whether their antibodies can help stop the spread of the virus and provide therapeutic benefit in severely ill COVID-19 patients (7).",

Disruption of this interaction may provide a therapeutic target (11, 12) ; indeed, it is the strategy of several current vaccine candidates to elicit humoral responses to capsid proteins (2, 13). Still, it is unclear whether and for how long previously-positive recovered patients are immune to the virus and, therefore, the scientific community is invested in defining suitable interventions to treat the most severe symptoms of COVID-19. For example, in early March, 2020, preliminary evidence seemed to suggest a beneficial role for antimalarial drugs (e.g., hydroxycholoroquine), especially in combination with azithromycin, in decreasing viral load and improving the prognosis of COVID-19 patients (14); however, a larger clinical trial showed a deleterious effect (e.g., a ~2-fold increase in mortality) for patients on hydroxycholoroquine (with or without azithromycin) (15) . Other treatments, while totally effective in sanitizing inert surfaces (e.g., UV light or bleach) (16) ; are clearly incompatible with the \"primo non nocere\" principle of medical practice. Although using antiretroviral drugs to treat SARS coronaviruses was previously proposed in vitro (17) , no clinical evidence in vivo has been provided to date; nonetheless, the preliminary release of data from ongoing trials with remdesivir show promise, with ~30% faster recovery and reduction in mortality (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier:",

However, in ~80% of cases, the latter did not prevent mortality, owing to insufficient lung perfusion, which could be explained by the development of thromboembolic complications (20) . In this context, clinical trials are currently underway to determine the impact of anticoagulants (e.g., heparin) or pro-fibrinolytic drugs (e.g., tissue plasminogen activator) in ameliorating severe COVID-19 infection with thromboembolic complications (21) . Interestingly, platelets from older subjects are hypercoagulable in the presence of pro-inflammatory stimuli (22) , which may help explain the increased mortality rates in older COVID-19 patients. Of note, small molecule metabolites are relevant in treating coagulopathies (e.g., tranexamic acid to treat hyperfibrinolysis in actively bleeding patients) (23) .

The results show marked alterations in nitrogen metabolism (especially amino acid homeostasis, catabolism, and transamination) and carbon metabolism (especially affecting levels of glucose and free fatty acids). Metabolites in these pathways significantly correlated with circulating levels of inflammatory markers (i.e., IL-6 and CRP) and renal function (i.e., BUN). Interestingly, the major effects of COVID-19, in addition of IL-6 levels, were tryptophan metabolism and the kynurenine pathway. The rate-limiting step in this pathway is determined by the enzymatic activity of indole 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO1), a pleotropic enzyme with complex effects, including an immunoregulatory role (29) . In general, the kynurenine/tryptophan ratio is a general measure of IDO activity, although the meaning of this measure alters depending upon the dynamics of metabolism and its effects on half-lives of kynurenine and tryptophan. IDO has substantial immunoregulatory effects that typically serve as a negative regulatory pathway of inflammation and immunization (30) . Of particular relevance to the current study, IDO plays a significant role in limiting lung inflammation in the context of IL-6, and deletion of IDO severely exacerbated inflammatory lung pathology in a murine model (31) .

Moreover, IDO activity (inferred from the levels of its metabolites) is inversely correlated with IL-6 levels. Although causes and effects cannot be inferred in the current observational study, based upon known biology, it is reasonable to hypothesize that IDO activity is mechanistically involved in inflammation in COVID-19. Consistent with this hypothesis, IDO is expressed by mucosal surfaces, such as the lung, including antigen presenting cells and the epithelium (32).",

In one such predicted mechanism, interferon induces ACE2 receptor expression, (38) which is also the receptor for the SARS-COV-2 spike protein S that mediates infection of host target cells (10) (11) (12) . Thus, interferon and its downstream signaling partners can have complex and potentially opposing effects in the context of SARS-COV-2 pathology and the ensuing balance of inflammation.

Moreover, dysregulated tryptophan metabolism is seen in inflammation (49) and aging, resulting in decreased NAD synthesis in older animals (50) and humans, an observation that supports an industry providing nicotinamide riboside as a dietary supplement (51); this suggests a potential metabolic explanation for the increased severity of COVID-19 in older subjects. In this context, it is worth noting that pro-inflammatory signaling favors proteolysis and amino acid catabolism (represented herein by increased acetyl-methionine and hydroxyproline, and altered levels of free amino acids), which can be antagonized, in part, by anti-inflammatory cytokines (e.g., IL-37)(52) or inflammasome inhibitors (53) . Notably, these same anti-inflammatory cytokines show promise in regulating glycemia in aging mice (54) , which is relevant in light of finding increased glycemia in our COVID-19 patients; this may also help explain why diabetes is a risk factor for severe COVID-19 illness (55) . Interestingly, similar increases in circulating glucose levels are found in critically ill patients, a phenomenon termed \"traumatic diabetes\". (56) (57) (58) Similarly, in trauma patients, extreme lipolysis is seen minutes to hours after trauma/shock, resulting in increased circulating free fatty acid levels (56) , which was also seen herein in the context of COVID-19, especially in patients with high IL-6 levels. Indeed, a key finding in the current study was elevated long-chain free fatty acids in COVID-19 subjects. Phospholipase A2 (PLA2), which cleaves the fatty acid in the sn-2 position of phospholipids, is required for replication of other related viruses such as MERS-CoV and HCoV-229E (25) . Elevated levels of long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), which are highly enriched in the sn-2 position of phospholipids, suggests that this pathway may be upregulated during SARS-CoV-2 infection. Increased PLA2 activity is associated with increased production of bioactive lipids by metabolism of omega-6 PUFAs and lysophosphatidylcholine. Some of the resulting metabolites (e.g., eicosanoids, oxylipins) may help propagate infection and thrombo-inflammatory complications (59) , by directly supporting synthesis of viral capsid membranes (24) (25) (26) , by targeting All rights reserved.

Notably, polyamine byproducts of nitrogen metabolism (e.g., spermidine, acetyl-spermidine), were among the metabolites that increased the most COVID-19 patient sera. Primary amines, such as tranexamic acid, can prevent hyperfibrinolysis in actively bleeding patients by interacting with the Kringle domain of tissue plasminogen activator and, thereby, blocking the fibrinolytic cascade (61) . It is interesting to speculate that inflammation-induced alterations in nitrogen metabolism may participate in dysregulated coagulation leading to thrombus formation in the most severe cases of COVID-19. In contrast, other metabolites associated with hypercoagulability, such as homocysteine (62) (63)), were decreased in COVID-19 patient sera. The latter may be explained by the apparent increase in oxidant stress in COVID-19 patients, as suggested by increased serum levels of methionine sulfoxide and cystine, along with decreases in antioxidants, such as cysteine and taurine (64) (but, interestingly, not reduced glutathione). Conversely, decreased serum acylcarnitine levels, which may have anticoagulant function (65) , is consistent with a potential hypercoagulable phenotype in these patients.",

In contrast, one would have predicted significant increases in serum levels of lactate and carboxylic acid markers of hypoxia (e.g., succinate) in COVID-19 patients, similar to what is seen in hypoxemic patients following ischemic (68) or hemorrhagic shock (69) . Surprisingly, no significant increases in serum lactate or succinate levels were observed, which may be explained because our patients were either normoxic or receiving intense respiratory therapy (e.g., ventilation) at the time of the blood draw. Although unrelated to IL-6, fumarate and itaconate were positively correlated with BUN and inosine, suggesting potential cross-talk between deaminated purine salvage reactions and carboxylic acid metabolism in renal dysfunction in COVID-19, similar to acute kidney ischemia (70) .

Subjects seen at Columbia University Irving Medical Center/New York-Presbyterian Hospital included 33 COVID-19-positive patients, as determined by SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid testing of nasopharyngeal swabs; in this group, the severity of the disease was inferred from serum IL-6 levels, which were determined by a CLIA-certified ELISA-based assay. The control group included 16 subjects, all of whom were SARS-CoV-2 negative by nasopharyngeal swab at the time of the blood draw. Some patients in this group were \"never positive\" subjects and some were COVID-19 convalescent patients who were previously positive, but currently negative, as determined by testing nasopharyngeal swabs, and at least 14 days postresolution of symptoms. Serum was obtained from freshly drawn blood after an overnight hold at 4\u00baC and all samples were then de-identified. Sera were extracted via a modified Folch method (chloroform/methanol/water 8:4:3), which completely inactivates other coronaviruses, such as MERS-CoV (73) . Briefly, 20 \uf06dL of serum was diluted in 130 \uf06dl of LC-MS grade water, 600 \uf06dl of icecold chloroform/methanol (2:1) was added, and the samples vortexed for 10 seconds. Samples were then incubated at 4\u00baC for 5 minutes, quickly vortexed (5 seconds), and centrifuged at 14,000 x g for 10 minutes at 4\u00baC. The top (i.e., aqueous) phase was transferred to a new tube for metabolomics analysis.",

IL-6 levels were determined during routine clinical care using a clinically-validated ELISA assay (B) and the results were used to divide COVID-19-positive patients into groups with low (<10 pg/ml), medium (10-65 pg/ml) and high (>90 pg/ml) IL-6 levels. Sera were obtained from these subjects for metabolomics analyses. In C, the serum metabolic phenotypes of COVID-19-positive patients significantly differed from controls by PLS-DA.

            "text": "). Targeted metabolomics analyses were performed on sera using UHPLC-MS and the results are reported extensively in Supplementary Table 1. The metabolic phenotypes of sera from COVID-19-positive patients differed significantly from controls, when examined by partial least-square discriminant analysis (PLS-DA; Figure 1.C). Hierarchical clustering analysis (Figure 1.D) highlighted significant associations of COVID-19 and IL-6 levels with amino acid metabolism, purines, acylcarnitines, and fatty acids; a vectorial version of this figure is provided in Supplementary Figure 1. Volcano plots (Figure 1.E) from targeted metabolomics analyses highlighted the top metabolites that increased (blue) or decreased (red) in the sera of COVID-19-positive patients, as compared to controls. To expand on these observations, untargeted metabolomics analyses were performed based on highresolution, accurate intact mass, isotopic patterns and MS2 fragmentation patterns, as described;(28) these results are reported in Supplementary Table 2. In Figure 2.A, volcano plot analyses highlighted 3,034 and 2,484 differential metabolites for negative and positive ion modes between COVID-19-positive and -negative subjects, respectively. PLS-DA analysis based on untargeted metabolomics data confirmed the targeted results and further separated COVID-19-positive and COVID-19-negative subjects(Figure 2.B), the former group separating from the latter across principal component 1 (18.7% of the total variance) as a function of IL-6 levels. Interestingly, volcano plot analyses comparing COVID-19-positive subjects with low, medium, and high serum IL-6 levels, as compared to controls, showed that the low IL-6 group was most comparable to controls (199 and 218 metabolites significantly decreasing and increasing), whereas the medium (218 and 765) and high IL-6 (206 and 789) groups differed the most(Figure 2.C). Pathway analysis of merged targeted and untargeted metabolomics data revealed a significant impact of COVID-19 on amino acid metabolism, especially the pathways involving tryptophan, aspartate, arginine, tyrosine, and lysine(Figure 2.D).",
