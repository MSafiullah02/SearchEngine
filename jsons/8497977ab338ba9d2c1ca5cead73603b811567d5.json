            "text": "The most extensive analysis of blood cytokines comes from Huang et al. 2 Using multiplexed antibody technology, this study reports that compared with non-ICU patients (n=28) ICU patients (n=13) had higher plasma levels of IL-2, IL-7, IL-10, G-SCF, IP-10, MCP1, MIP1A, VEGF, and TNF\u03b1. Notably IL-6 and IL-1 were not upregulated in ICU patients, though an increase compared to healthy donors was observed for IL-1 , albeit at low levels (< 1pg/ml). Increases in TNF and VEGF were observed consistently in all ICU patients and the majority of non-ICU patients, with a mean increase of two-fold above normal levels for TNF (50 to 100 pg/ml, though noted this is high for healthy donors) and greater than 4-fold increase in VEGF above normal (< 50 to 200pg/ml), indicative of effects relating to capillary leakage. Gong et al analysed levels of IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, TNF and IL-1 in the serum from 34 mild, 34 moderate and 32 severe patients. 11 IL-6 levels were significantly increased in moderate and severe cases, whilst IL-8, TNF and IL-10 were elevated in the severe vs mild cases, suggesting a correlation with most severe disease. IL-1\u03b2 was below the detectable limit in all samples analysed. Others suggest that pathology is associated with elevated levels of both IL-6 and IL-1\u03b2 and therapeutic targeting of IL-1 family members may be effective in controlling the hyperinflammation. 12 Qin et al analysed the largest cohort -452 patients, 286 of whom were classified as severe. 10 They also report that a number of inflammatory cytokines in the blood were elevated in severe cases compared to non-severe. These include interleukin IL-2R (757.0 vs 663.5 U/mL; P = 0.001), IL-6 (25.2 vs 13.3 pg/mL; P < 0.001), IL-8 (18.4 vs 13.7 pg/mL; P < 0.001), IL-10 (6.6 vs 5.0 pg/mL; P < 0.001), and TNF-\u03b1 (8.7 vs 8.4 pg/mL; P = 0.037). The authors argue that changes are small, but the larger group size adds power to the data. Liu T et al measured an array of cytokines in 69 severe patients and 11 non -severe patients. Compared with non-severe type, there was no difference in the level of IL-2, IL-4, TNF-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b3, while IL-10 increased slightly and IL-6 increased significantly (2.5 to 35 pg/ml, p=0.016) in patients with severe COVID-19. 13 Zhou et al 14 and Ruan et al 15 only measured IL-6, and reported a mean increase of 6 to 11 pg/ml from moderate (137 patients) to severe cases (54 patients), and 6.8 pg/ml (82 discharged patients) to 11.4 pg/ml (68 deceased), respectively. A longitudinal study of 40 patients was performed by Liu et al. Measuring cytokine levels from early onset (< 3 days), they report a sustained elevation of IL-6, which only falls after 16 days. IL-10 was elevated from onset to day 7-9, and IL-2, IFNg and TNF levels (n.s.) display a transient peak at day 4-6 post onset. 16 The observed hyper-cytokinemia is inversely correlated with lymphopenia, particularly in patients > 60 years of age and in patients with severe forms of the disease. T cell numbers are negatively correlated to serum IL-6, IL-10 and TNF-\u03b1 concentration, with patients who recovered showing reduced IL-6, IL-10 and TNF-\u03b1 concentrations and restored T cell counts. T cells from COVID-19 patients have significantly higher levels of the exhausted marker PD-1 as compared to health controls. 17 The analysis of the immune microenvironment of the bronchoalveolar lavage via single-cell RNA sequence (scRNA-seq) and single-cell TCR-seq of the lung bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) cells from 6 of COVID-19 patients, including 3 severe and 3 mild cases, revealed a perturbation of the lung macrophage compartment. The pro-inflammatory monocytederived FCN1+ macrophages outnumbered the resident FABP4+ alveolar macrophages in the patients with severe lung disease compared to patients with mild disease. Inversely, there was a significant clonal expansion of CD8+ T cells in the lungs of patients with mild disease compared to severe, suggesting a subversion of the balance of the adaptive and innate arm of the immune response is key to raise to the viral challenge. 18 Wen et al provide the first description of the immune signature of patients in early stage recovery. 19 Using single cell sequencing, they studied transcriptional changes in peripheral blood mononuclear cells in ten patients recovered from COVID-19. In agreement with others, they report numbers of CD4+ T were significantly decreased, while classical CD14++ monocytes and NK cells expressing pro-inflammatory genes were increased.",

            "text": "Whilst it is rapidly emerging that uncontrolled dysregulation of the immune system is prevalent in more severe cases, Siddiqi et al suggest clinical professionals take caution when deciding how and when to treat. 20 The authors suggest that a structured approach to clinical phenotyping be undertaken to distinguish the phase where the viral pathogenicity is dominant versus when the host inflammatory response overtakes the pathology. Drugs targeted to the virus hold the greatest promise when applied early in the course of the illness, but their usefulness in advanced stages may be questionable. Similarly, use of antiinflammatory therapy applied too early may not be necessary and could even provoke viral replication, such as in the case of corticosteroids. Clearly, all studies that throw light on the nature of triggered immune responses throughout the course of disease will be highly valuable for guiding selection of the optimal pharmacological strategies. In the absence of thorough testing and early diagnosis, it is unfortunate that early stages may not be adequately detected to prevent hospital admissions, when hyperinflammation may have taken hold, and the time is right for targeted anti-cytokine approaches. A summary of the blood cytokines associated with COVID-19, as described above is provided in the following table. Further reports are frequently emerging, and therefore this summary is not all inclusive.",

Wan, S. et al 9 Mild disease group had a significantly lower proportion of patients with IL-6 higher than normal, larger number of samples are needed to confirm. Zhou, F. et al 14 Elevated levels of blood IL-6 were more commonly seen in severe COVID-19 illness, other cytokines not measured. Liu J. et al 16 The degree of proinflammatory cytokine storm is higher in severe COVID-19 patients, and is associated with disease severity.

Ruan, Q. et al 15 Predictors of a fatal outcome in COVID-19 cases included age, the presence of underlying diseases, the presence of secondary infection and elevated inflammatory indicators in the blood.
