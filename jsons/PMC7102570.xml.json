Acyclovir targets herpes simplex virus and varicella-zoster infection, and individual antiviral agents target one viral infection caused by one virus or two viruses of the same family (Elion, 1982; Shiraki, 2017, Shiraki, 2018). Among antiviral agents, one of the unique features of favipiravir (T-705) is its broad spectrum activity toward RNA viruses, including influenza virus, rhinovirus, and respiratory syncytial virus, but not DNA viruses, as shown in Fig. 1\n(Furuta et al., 2002; Furuta et al., 2005; Furuta et al., 2009). Favipiravir shows better efficacy in treating influenza infections than oseltamivir (Tamiflu) (Takahashi et al., 2003; Tanaka et al., 2017), and its efficacy in treating pathogenic avian influenza A(H5N1) and oseltamivir-resistant viruses has been confirmed in animals (Kiso et al., 2010; Sidwell et al., 2007).",

Novel influenza strains cause more severe diseases, particularly pneumonia, than seasonal influenza, and the mortality rate is 53.5% (483/903) for influenza A(H5N1) (Lai et al., 2016) and 34% (47/137) for influenza A(H7N9) (Li et al., 2014).

Regarding favipiravir (T-705), one compound showed anti-influenza virus activity and was optimized for activity and efficacy in animal experiments to yield favipiravir. Our laboratory conducted drug efficacy and validation tests in infected mice and ferrets and conducted experiments to compare the efficacy of favipiravir with oseltamivir (Tamiflu). Based on its chemical structure, favipiravir should inhibit RNA synthesis, and our laboratory tried to isolate a resistant virus. Then, the lack of generation of resistant viruses was investigated.",

            "text": "A compound that first showed anti-influenza activity was obtained in the screen of antiviral drugs targeting influenza, and favipiravir was optimized in terms of activity and stability in animals. Dr. Shiraki, K. suggested that the chemical structures of the active compound and its derivatives, including favipiravir, resembled a nucleoside analogue, and the presumed mechanism of action was to inhibit RNA synthesis (Fig. 1). Three compounds, 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide-1-\u03b2-D-ribofuranoside (AICAR), which was biosynthesized de novo from amino acids, ribosyl-favipiravir, and ribavirin, have similar chemical structures, suggesting that favipiravir functions as a purine homologue and inhibits viral RNA synthesis. Therefore, Dr. Shiraki, K. suggested the synthesis of the ribosyl form of favipiravir for its better efficacy, but the ribosylation of favipiravir did not improve its antiviral activity. Addition of 10 \u00d7 50% effective concentration for plaque reduction (EC50 = 63.7 \u03bcM) of adenine, guanine, adenosine, guanosine, and inosine in the assay medium abolishes the anti-influenza virus activity of favipiravir (Furuta et al., 2005). Based on these findings, favipiravir is mainly incorporated in the salvage pathways for purine nucleotides through the purine phosphoribosyltransferases (Craig 3rd & Eakin, 2000) and is further phosphorylated to favipiravir-triphosphate as the substrate for viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). The phosphorylation of favipiravir by hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyltransferase was confirmed in a subsequent study (Naesens et al., 2013). Favipiravir showed anti-influenza virus activity toward all subtypes of seasonal influenza virus strains, including types A, B and C of laboratory strains and clinical isolates, as well as an oseltamivir-resistant virus, with an EC50 ranging from 0.014 to 0.55 \u03bcg/mL (Furuta et al., 2002). Although the effectiveness against influenza viruses at the cell culture level was confirmed, the use of favipiravir as an anti-influenza drug was confirmed by analyzing its efficacy in animal models of influenza infection, as described below, which led to drug development.",

Based on the antiviral activity toward four RNA viruses, we expected that favipiravir should be active against a broad range of RNA viruses. Favipiravir has been evaluated and developed as a broad spectrum anti-RNA virus drug, including lethal RNA virus infections. The anti-RNA virus activity of favipiravir was analyzed at the cellular level, and efficacy studies were performed in animal models of human lethal RNA virus infections, as shown in Table 1\n. Patients with an Ebola virus infection in West Africa in 2014 and patients with other RNA virus infections have been treated with favipiravir (Avigan\u00ae) based on the efficacy in human lethal RNA virus infections, clinical experience, efficacy in patients with seasonal influenza, and its licensure for human use.",

Influenza infection and its replication in the epithelium of the upper respiratory tract induce the production of interferon (IFN) and cytokines that induce cyclooxygenase expression and prostaglandin E2 production and cause fever. The effects of interferon and interleukin (IL)-1\u03b1 were determined by neutralizing their actions through the intravenous injection of their respective antibodies in influenza-infected mice (Kurokawa, Imakita, Kumeda, & Shiraki, 1996; Kurokawa, Watanabe, Shimizu, Sawamura, & Shiraki, 2010). The effects of aspirin, NSAIDs, and cinnamyl compounds derived from herbal extracts on influenza-infected mice or mouse macrophage-derived P388D1 cells were determined, and 48 cinnamyl compounds showed compound-specific responses to fever and increased IL-1 levels in influenza-infected mice. Cinnamyl compounds regulate cytokine levels by modulating the amount of NF-\u03baB (Kurokawa et al., 1998; Kurokawa, Brown, Kagawa, & Shiraki, 2003). Cinnamyl compounds and clarithromycin increase the levels of IL-12 on day 2 and IFN-\u03b3 on day 3 in the bronchoalveolar fluids of mice and decrease the area of pneumonia throughout the lungs. The role of IL-12 on day 2 was confirmed through its direct nasal application, and nasal administration of IL-12 reduced the virus yield in the bronchoalveolar fluids from influenza-infected mice (Hama et al., 2009; Kurokawa, Tsurita, Brown, Fukuda, & Shiraki, 2002; Tsurita et al., 2001). Cinnamyl compounds that are mainly derived from medicinal herbs prevent the induction of fever in influenza-infected mice by decreasing the serum IL-1 level. In contrast, aspirin suppresses fever by inhibiting hypothalamic cyclooxygenase activity and prostaglandin E2 production without affecting the high level of IL-1 (Kurokawa, Imakita, Kumeda, & Shiraki, 1996; Kurokawa, Imakita, Kumeda, Yukawa, & Shiraki, 1996; Kurokawa, Kumeda, Yamamura, Kamiyama, & Shiraki, 1998). We have determined two steps of antipyretic action by cinnamyl compounds and NSAIDs in the fever cascade in influenza infection.",

The favipiravir treatment cures lethal infection, and all mice survive.

Influenza infection induces TNF-\u03b1 production in mouse macrophage-derived P388D1 cells, and the suppressive effects of favipiravir and oseltamivir were compared in this P388D1 cell-based system. Favipiravir significantly suppresses the production of TNF-\u03b1 in influenza virus-infected P388D1 cells compared with the active form of oseltamivir (Tanaka et al., 2017). TNF-\u03b1 appears first and disappears first in P338D1 cells among TNF-\u03b1, IL-1, and IL-6 (Kurokawa et al., 2003), and we observed a significant reduction in the levels of TNF-\u03b1 in P388D1 cells and influenza-infected mice treated with favipiravir. The antiviral activity of favipiravir has been attributed to a decrease in the pulmonary viral load and TNF-\u03b1 level in the airways of influenza virus-infected mice compared with oseltamivir, and the reduction in the viral RNA load induced by favipiravir might have resulted in a reduction in TNF-\u03b1 production and alleviation of lung pathogenesis (Damjanovic et al., 2011; Tanaka et al., 2017). Based on these findings, the intracellular viral RNA is less recognized by intracellular Toll-like receptors and results in a decrease in the production of the inflammatory cytokine TNF-\u03b1. This mechanism may also contribute to the enhanced effects of favipiravir treatment on alleviating influenza infection compared with oseltamivir treatment.",

The viral hemagglutinin binds to sialic acid on the cell surface, and the viral particle is incorporated into the endosome. When the endosome is acidified and the pH decreases to a value of 5, which is characteristic of the late endosome, the structure of the hemagglutinin changes through a process mediated by the Matrix-2 (M2) ion channel. Then, the endosomal membrane and the viral envelope fuse, and the viral genome in the viral particle is released into the cytoplasm (uncoating). The viral genome and RdRp complex are transported to the nucleus where the transcription (replication) of viral RNA synthesis begins. The synthesized RNA does not contain the Cap structure required for mRNA, and the Cap structure from the host mRNA is excised and transferred to the viral RNA by the Cap-dependent endonuclease of viral RdRp complex, resulting in the formation of the viral mRNA (Cap-snatching). After the viral mRNA is produced, the viral protein is translated. The viral proteins and RdRp-RNA complex form viral particles that subsequently bud from the cell membrane. Hemagglutinin on viral particles budded from the cell surface binds to the sialic acid on the surface of the infected cell, and the viral particles are released from the infected cell through the cleavage of sialic acid by viral neuraminidase (NA) for the next round of infection.",

Seasonal influenza mainly infects the upper respiratory tract, while novel influenza causes pneumonia, mainly due to an infection of the pulmonary epithelium. Furthermore, unlike the presence of a certain level of immunity to seasonal influenza, immunity does not exist for novel influenza. Therefore, the severity of the infection appears to be caused by a prolonged virus growth period and the affinity for the pulmonary epithelium (Shinya et al., 2006).

Pandemics occur when novel influenza A viruses emerge that are able to infect people easily and spread from person to person in an efficient and sustained manner. Two decades have elapsed since an avian influenza case was reported in Hong Kong in 1997, and a decade has elapsed since the most recent influenza pandemic that occurred in 2009. Sporadic cases of A(H5N1) and A(H7N9) influenza infections have been accumulating, and we must prepare for these strains or other novel influenza strains that might progress to an influenza pandemic and spread globally, such as A(H1N1)pdm09. Influenza pandemics can cause severe pneumonia, generate a drug-resistant virus, and render antiviral drugs ineffective during prolonged viral growth in patients treated with oseltamivir or baloxavir. Although drug-resistant viruses may have a reduced ability to grow, the use of drugs in many patients continues the selection pressure to ensure that resistant viruses become dominant. Drug selection continues, and the resistant strain becomes dominant during pandemics because drug-resistant strains are selected in many patients treated with the same anti-influenza drug. Regarding a resistant virus with good replication capability, oseltamivir-resistant A(H1N1) viruses possessing the NA H275Y substitution spread globally during the 2008 to 2009 season. Thus, we have experience with a global pandemic of an oseltamivir-resistant strain. Favipiravir maintains the same efficacy from the first to the last patient of a pandemic because its resistant strain does not appear or does not replace the original strain.",

This outstanding feature of favipiravir as an anti-influenza drug has been exploited in treating patients with severe influenza in combination with oseltamivir in China (Cao, 2018; Wang et al., 2019). Favipiravir and oseltamivir combination therapy accelerated clinical recovery compared to oseltamivir monotherapy in severe influenza. The dose of favipiravir used in the study mentioned above was 1600 mg twice a day on day 1 followed by 600 mg twice a day for 9 days, and the approved favipiravir dose in Japan is 1600 mg twice a day on day 1 followed by 600 mg twice a day for 4 days. The viral replication period is 6 days or longer for seasonal influenza (Lina et al., 2018; Memoli et al., 2014). When drug administration is stopped during the virus replication period or when resistant strains appear, virus replication and fever relapse. Thus, 10 days of administration may be required for severe influenza or novel influenza.",

Once an avian influenza outbreak occurs, more people are infected than in the pandemic of 2009, with similar or faster global spread. Predictions of whether the next pandemic will occur are difficult to determine, but researchers are currently concerned about the A(H5N1) and A(H7N9) strains with high lethality. When these strains adapt to humans and become pandemic, their pathogenicity may be milder, similar to previous pandemics. If an influenza pandemic causes severe disease, it may cause substantial damage to human health and social dysfunction. The need for pandemic countermeasures is an important consideration.",

Treatment with favipiravir from 6 to 13 days after lethal infection with Ebola virus cured all mice when the treatment was started at the initiation of liver damage (elevation of AST and ALT) and virus detection in blood. However, the administration of favipiravir from 8 to 14 days prolonged survival, but four of five mice died when the liver damage and viremia advanced. Early treatment with favipiravir was effective, but when the disease is advanced, including liver damage, the efficacy in prolonging survival is limited to one of five mice, indicating that treatment should be started before liver damage progresses to irreversible levels. Thus, favipiravir may be able to cure an Ebola virus infection in the early phase of infection, but the curative activity of favipiravir may be limited in patients with an advanced infection.",

Favipiravir functions as a purine analogue, as expected from the chemical structure, and it is incorporated instead of guanosine and adenosine. Favipiravir terminates elongation after the incorporation of a single favipiravir molecule (Sangawa et al., 2013) and after the incorporation of two consecutive favipiravir molecules (Jin et al., 2013), and the synthesis of this complementary viral RNA strand cannot be completed. In contrast, the anti-RNA virus drug ribavirin is incorporated into the replicating strand, which further elongates and accumulates mismatched nucleotides at the incorporated sites. Base pairing with ribavirin in the complementary strand during replication, transcription, and translation of the RNA strand causes mismatched base pairing, the production of nonfunctional proteins, and a loss of viral infectivity. Accumulated mutations (mismatched nucleotides) cause the replicated viruses to lose their replicative capability, which is known as \u201clethal mutagenesis\u201d (Vignuzzi, Stone, & Andino, 2005), as shown in Fig. 5\n.

Favipiravir-RTP and ribavirin TP inhibit the RdRp activity in a dose-dependent manner, with 50% inhibitory concentrations (IC50s) of 0.14 and 2.4 \u03bcM, respectively (Furuta et al., 2005). The RdRp activity was determined by measuring the incorporation of labeled GTP in the elongating RNA strand. Favipiravir-RTP has a higher affinity for RdRp than GTP, and when incorporated, favipiravir-RTP stops the elongation of the RNA strand in which it is incorporated. This termination prevents the incorporation of radioactivity, and thus favipiravir-RTP exhibits high inhibitory activity and a low IC50 (0.14 \u03bcM). On the other hand, ribavirin induces competitive inhibition with GTP, and incorporation results in mismatch mutations; the strand continues to elongate and incorporate labeled GTP without stopping at the incorporation site. Thus, ribavirin has a high IC50 value (2.4 \u03bcM) because its RNA strand is further elongated by incorporating radiolabeled GTP. Therefore, its ability to inhibit enzyme activity becomes weaker, and it displays a higher IC50 value than favipiravir. Furthermore, a marked decrease in the amount of the viral genome has been observed in favipiravir-treated cultures compared with ribavirin-treated cultures (Vanderlinden et al., 2016). Favipiravir is incorporated into the viral genome and terminates elongation, resulting in shorter genome sizes and the marked loss of the viral genome in favipiravir-treated cultures (Rocha-Pereira et al., 2012; Vanderlinden et al., 2016). These observations are consistently explained by the chain termination induced by favipiravir.",

However, the incorporated acyclovir is removed by the proofreading activity of viral DNA polymerase, and viral DNA elongation continues. Therefore, the sequence containing the guanosine homopolymeric string (G-string) in the genome is the target of the incorporation and removal of acyclovir, and the incorporation of guanosine followed by repeated corrections by the proofreading machinery create a hot spot of mutations in G-strings of our laboratory and clinical acyclovir-resistant isolates (Akahoshi et al., 2017; Daikoku et al., 2016; Ida et al., 1999; Shimada et al., 2007; Talarico, Phelps, & Biron, 1993). Penciclovir (famciclovir) and ganciclovir (valganciclovir), which are guanosine analogues, function as an anti-herpes simplex virus and varicella-zoster virus agent and anti-cytomegalovirus agent, respectively, with mechanisms similar to acyclovir, but they do not induce mutations or have hot spots in the G-string. These compounds do not prevent elongation at the incorporation site but are incorporated, and elongation pauses at normal nucleotides after the incorporated site. Therefore, mutations associated with proofreading do not occur in the G-string, and this difference in the mode of chain termination and proofreading activity causes a lower mutation frequency in subjects treated with penciclovir and ganciclovir than in subjects treated with acyclovir.",

Thus, the increased mutation rates observed in response to favipiravir treatment are unlikely to be due to the incorporation of favipiravir into viral RNA followed by elongation, similar to ribavirin or acyclovir (Fig. 5). Favipiravir is unlikely to induce mismatches upon its incorporation into the RNA strand and transitions in the influenza virus genome.

Then, we decided to deny the possibility of replacement with the resistant virus. Spontaneous mutation rates of the influenza virus RdRp complex and poliovirus 3D RdRp are both approximately 1 \u00d7 10\u22124 (Cheung et al., 2014; Drake, 1993; Gubareva & Fry, 2019). Titers of influenza virus and poliovirus in the culture reach approximately 108 infectious viral particles/mL in 5 mL of media in a 25 cm2 flask, and their genomes contain approximately 13,600 and 7500 base pairs, respectively, stochastically indicating 104 alterations per nucleotide in the genome. Therefore, every type of mutant should be generated during replication, and continuous cultivation for a month might increase the favipiravir-resistant virus population. If favipiravir induces mutations more frequently than natural processes, mutants resistant to favipiravir should be isolated easily, and the culture should be replaced by the favipiravir-resistant mutants. We isolated susceptibility variants of influenza virus and poliovirus in the cultures treated with favipiravir for a month and identified nucleotide substitutions (mutations) in their RdRp genes, but these mutations were not related to resistance or mutations common to favipiravir (Daikoku et al., 2014; Daikoku et al., 2017). Therefore, theoretical resistant mutants should be generated but are unable to replicate or replicate with reduced fidelity to replace the entire virus population. The favipiravir-resistant mutant replicates as an artificially generated clone but does not become dominant among the entire virus population that grows in the presence of favipiravir (Abdelnabi et al., 2017; Delang et al., 2014; Goldhill et al., 2019).

Favipiravir has a similar mechanism of action to the antiherpesvirus drug acyclovir and has the property of not producing a resistant virus. Favipiravir is contraindicated in pregnant women due to its teratogenicity and embryotoxicity in animals. Subsequent stockpiling of doses for 2 million people has been performed as a countermeasure against novel influenza in Japan. Favipiravir has been used to treat lethal infections in humans because its efficacy has been confirmed in a wide range of animal models of lethal RNA infections. Severe human RNA infections are sporadic, and the number of cases is limited. In patients with these infections, favipiravir has been used for urgent and life-saving purposes because there is no standard effective treatment, rather than to show efficacy. Clinical trials have been performed to compare historical control patients and patients treated with favipiravir for Ebola virus infection (Bai et al., 2016; Jacobs et al., 2015; Sissoko et al., 2016) and SFTS (Yasukawa, 2016). Subsequently, favipiravir has been submitted for additional indications based on clinical trials for SFTS in Japan. The establishment of a placebo group that does not receive an effective drug in a lethal animal model is a challenging problem to confirm the efficacy of favipiravir by a randomized placebo-controlled trial. As an example of this situation, PEP of human immunodeficiency virus has been performed to protect against needle sticks or occupational exposures without placebo and has become a standard procedure in the guideline due to its prophylactic effect as a result of many years of implementation (Kuhar et al., 2013).",

An influenza pandemic consisting of a global outbreak of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus occurred in 2009, and although the pathogenicity of this virus was milder than A(H5N1) and A(H7N9), it caused a pandemic and health problems. Although there was immunity against influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 among the elderly, it caused health problems for young people and a substantial social impact. As a next candidate for a pandemic influenza, avian influenza, such as A(H5N1) or A(H7N9), causes a severe infection and pneumonia due to the prolonged viral replication caused by the lack of immunity and its tropism to the pulmonary epithelium with a high mortality rate (Lai et al., 2016; Li et al., 2014; Shinya et al., 2006). The ability to predict whether a pandemic will occur remains challenging, but a necessary strategy appears to be to stockpile vaccines and anti-influenza drugs for novel influenza strains to cope with pandemics.",

Cinnamyl compounds from medicinal herbs, anti-IFN antibody, anti-IL-1 antibody, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (aspirin) act at each step of this process. Cinnamyl compounds and NSAIDs inhibit the induction of IFN and cyclooxygenase activity, respectively, in the fever cascade to work as antipyretics in influenza. Regarding pneumonia, IL-12 and IFN-\u03b3 production are induced in the bronchoalveolar fluid (BALF) on the second and third day of infection, respectively, and an increase in IL-12 levels reduces the viral load in the BALF and the area of pneumonia throughout the lungs.",

Influenza virus hemagglutinin (HA) binds to its receptor, sialic acid on the cell surface and is taken up into endosomes by endocytosis. Endosomes are gradually acidified to produce late endosomes, viral matrix-2 (M2) ion channels acidify viral particles, and the structure of trimeric HA molecules changes and shows membrane fusion activity. The endosomal membrane and envelope are then fused, and the genomic RNA and RdRp complex in the virus particle are released into the cytoplasm (uncoating) and transported to the nucleus through the cytoplasm. The transcription (replication) of genomic RNA by the RdRp complex occurs in the nucleus, and the genomic RNA is abundantly produced. Genomic RNA lacks the Cap structure required for mRNA function, and the Cap portion of the host mRNA is removed by a Cap-dependent endonuclease. Then, the Cap portion is coupled to genomic RNA, and viral mRNA synthesis is complete (Cap-snatching). Viral proteins are synthesized from the mRNA, and viral proteins and genomic RNA are transported to the cell surface and bud from the membrane to form viral particles. Since the budding virus is bound to the sialic acid on the infected cell surface via the HA protein of virus particles, it is unable to leave the infected cell and infect new cells. For this reason, the sialic acid-HA bond is cleaved by neuraminidase (NA) on the surface of the virus particle, and the virus particle is released from the surface of the infected cell and proceeds to the next round of infection. Amantadine blocks uncoating by inhibiting acidification mediated by the M2 protein in the virus particle in late endosome, and thus the infection is unable to be completed. Favipiravir inhibits viral RNA synthesis by terminating chain elongation at its incorporated site, and no new RNA is generated in the cell. Baloxavir marboxil prevents Cap-snatching, and the viral mRNA is not produced, resulting in a failure to produce viral proteins and infectious viruses. Genomic RNA is synthesized and remains in the cell. NA inhibitors block the cleavage of the sialic acid-HA bond in the virus on the surface of infected cells and prevent the spread of the viral infection. NA inhibitors allow genomic RNA synthesis. Favipiravir inhibits viral RNA synthesis, while baloxavir and NAIs allow viral RNA synthesis. Although viral spread is inhibited by baloxavir and NAIs, viral RNA is synthesized, and the pool of genomic RNA serves as a rich source of resistant viruses.",

Then, chain elongation stops at the site of favipiravir incorporation, and elongation does not proceed because favipiravir functions as a chain terminator. This RNA-favipiravir(\u2212RdRp) complex will not be repaired by the proofreading enzyme and would be disposed of as unnecessary RNA, resulting in the extinction of the viral genome (Rocha-Pereira et al., 2012; Vanderlinden et al., 2016). B. Lethal mutagenesis Ribavirin is incorporated into the elongating RNA strand, and viral RdRp continues to elongate until completion. Next, the RNA strand with multiple ribavirin incorporation sites further incorporates ribavirin or serves as mRNA for viral protein synthesis. The incorporation of ribavirin in the viral RNA causes the mismatch of base pairs (transition mutation), and translation of this RNA causes mutations in the amino acid sequence of the protein, resulting in impaired function. Viral proteins with impaired function fail to replicate or produce infectious viral particles, and viral infection ceases. Thus, lethal mutagenesis terminates viral infection through a different mechanism than chain termination.",
