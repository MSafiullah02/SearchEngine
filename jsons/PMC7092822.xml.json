After adsorption for 1 h, the cells were washed with PBS and cultured. As controls, Vero E6, CaCo-2, MDCK, and RK13 cells were similarly infected with SARS-CoV. The cell proliferation rates of the infected cells in triplicate experiments revealed that only the Vero E6 cell number declined even in the next day after infection, while all the other cells showed proliferation that were almost similar as those of uninfected parental cells (Fig. 1\nA). In fact, severe cytopathic effects (CPE) appeared only in infected Vero E6 cells on day 2 post-infection, while all of the other cell lines, including CaCo-2 and neural cell lines, representatively showed no apparent CPE (Fig. 1B). To detect the SARS-CoV infection in the neural cell lines, the viral antigen expression in the cells was examined by an IF test on day 2 post-infection (Fig. 1C). Strong IF-staining with anti-SARS-CoV S MAb (3A2) was detected in the cytoplasmic region of infected Vero E6 and CaCo-2 cells. In both infected OL and C6 cells, the number of cells with clear IF-staining was much lower (Fig. 1C). There were no apparent IF-positive cells in MDCK and RK13 cells (Fig. 1C). The culture media from the same Vero E6 and CaCo-2 cells 1 and 2 days post-infection, used in Fig. 1A, were subjected to the infectivity titration. The results showed that the titer was highest in Vero E6 and slightly lower in CaCo-2, that were very contrast to those in OL and C6 neural cells (Fig. 2\n). The titers in the culture media on day 2 post-infection were slightly increased compared to those on day 1 post-infection in all these infected cells. In contrast, the infectivity titers were almost negligible in the culture media from infected MDCK and RK13 cells and there were no apparent differences between the titers on days 1 and 2 post-infection.",

            "text": "To confirm the expression of SARS-CoV in the neural cell lines, we next examined the presence of viral RNA by RT-PCR. First, amplification of the viral genomic RNA by RT-PCR with a primer set located in open reading frame 1ab was examined (Fig. 3\nA). A clear discrete band was detectable by RT-PCR of the RNA extracted from OL and C6 cells, as well as MDCK and RK13 cells, 2 days post-infection, and the mobility of the band corresponded to that of the band detected by RT-PCR with the RNA from Vero E6 and CaCo-2 cells 2 days post-infection. Again, the amounts of the above RT-PCR products were slightly higher in infected Vero E6 and CaCo-2 cells than infected OL, C6, MDCK, and RK13 cells, all of which showed similar levels. Next, we used primers from the S (Fig. 3B) and N (Fig. 3C) regions to amplify viral mRNA species. Using S primers, a clear band was detectable only for Vero E6 and CaCo-2 cells and only a faint band was detected in OL cells, but the other infected cells showed no detectable band. In contrast, by using N primers, a clear difference was found in the patterns of RT-PCR products among individual infected cells. Several mRNA species encompassing the region overlapping the N region could be identified at high levels in Vero E6 and CaCo-2 cells. In addition, similar mRNA species were also detected in OL and C6 cells, but at lower levels. In contrast, there were no bands corresponding to such mRNA species in MDCK or RK13 cells. These results may indicate that SARS-CoV expression and replication occur in OL and C6 cells at significantly lower levels compared with those in Vero E6 and CaCo-2 cells, while there was no apparent evidence to support the expression and replication of this virus in MDCK and RK13 cells. The positive PCR signals in MDCK and RK13 cells for viral genomic RNA (Fig. 3A) might have derived from the adsorbed SARS-CoV particles. Consequently, OL and C6 cells were found to be susceptible to SARS-CoV, although the viral expression levels were greatly lower compared with those in infected Vero E6 and CaCo-2 cells.",

Both bands for the N and S proteins of SARS-CoV were clearly identified in Vero E6 cells, while a clear band of the N and only a faint band of the S were identified in CaCo-2 cells. In contrast, the N, but not the S, protein band was only faintly identified in infected OL and C6 cells. The results were confirmed by independently prepared three sets of infected cell samples (Fig. 4B). In all three experiments, level for \u03b1-tubulin in infected Vero E6 was significantly decreased. Therefore, when we estimate the relative expression levels of SARS-CoV S and N proteins compared with that of \u03b1-tubulin, we might overestimate the S and N protein levels in Vero E6 cells (Fig. 4B).",

This finding leads support to the possibility that the SARS-CoV could be derived from natural virus carriers. In this regard, several reports have shown the susceptibility of various animals to this virus: ferrets and domestic cats [29], various species of monkeys [30], [31], civets [32], [33], pigs and chickens [34], as well as mice [20], [35], [36]. Rodents are of particular interest in the study of SARS as a model animal. It was demonstrated that C57BL/6 mice could be productively infected by SARS-CoV in the bronchial and bronchiolar epithelium of the respiratory tract, and that the virus was rapidly cleared through a mechanism independent of lymphoid cells [20]. Compared to human ACE2, murine ACE2 was shown to less efficiently bind the S1 domain of SARS-CoV, and rat ACE2 was even less efficient [37]. However, it is noteworthy that this virus was able to spread to the brain of mice as well as to multiple other organs at late time points when it had already been cleared by the lung [20]. Interestingly, rats in particular have been proposed to be vectors for SARS-CoV, based on circumstantial evidence from Amoy Gardens, Hong Kong [38]. The evidence showing the susceptibility of rat neural cell line C6 to this virus in this study may support this hypothesis.",
