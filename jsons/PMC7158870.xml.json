The virus rapidly spread all over the world and led to a high rate of mortality and became a great challenge for the healthcare staff. SARS-CoV-2 virus causes a pneumonia that was identified through fever, dyspnea, and acute respiratory symptoms and named COVID-19. (1). This disease exacerbates in a number of patients and causes pulmonary edema, multi-organ failure, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Prevalence of ARDS among COVID-19 patients has been reported to be up to 17% (2).",

Patients remaining in lengthy prone position sessions leads to decrease in mortality of patients (6). However, correct selection of patients and applying the proper treatment protocol for prone positioning are key to its effectiveness. For instance, in a meta-analysis, Munshi et al. expressed that prone position can lead to a drop in the rate of mortality among patients with severe ARDS when applied to patients for least 12 hours a day (7). Additionally, in another meta-analysis it was revealed that prone position can only reduce mortality due to ARDS when patients are ventilated with low tidal volume, the treatment is started within the initial 48 hours of initiation of the disease, and patients have severe hypoxia. In other words, prone position can reduce mortality only when prescribed for patients with severe impaired oxygenation, in the initial hours, and for long durations (8).",

Even in patients with severe ARDS, the rate of using this technique was 32.9%. In the mentioned study, 2 main reasons were given for the physicians\u2019 reluctance to use this treatment method: 1- Based on the judgment of the physicians in most cases, the hypoxia in severe ARDS patients is not severe enough to justify using prone position. 2- Most ARDS patients have hemodynamic instability, which prevents the physicians from deciding to use prone position (9).",

In prone position, the patient should face the ventilator and in patients with tracheostomy, a roll of fabric or pillow should be placed under the shoulders to prevent airway obstruction, these patients should receive muscle and nerve relaxant medications and high-dose sedation as infusion, eye pads should be used for closing the patients\u2019 eyes to prevent corneal ulcers. Considering the condition of these patients and presence of pressure on their stomach, the probability of reflux after gavage is very high, so they must be closely monitored regarding aspiration of gastric contents (10).",
