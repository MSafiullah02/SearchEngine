Uncontrolled generation of a plethora of proinflammatory and potentially autotoxic mediators has been noted both in experimental models of sepsis and in clinical settings [4, 5, 6]. The fact that such a systemic inflammatory reaction may not only be triggered by microbial invasion but is also encountered in response to various kinds of tissue injury is reflected in the term \"systemic inflammatory response syndrome\" (SIRS). Polymorphonuclear granulocytes (PMN) are intimately involved in these events in a dual way as they represent the first line of defense against microbial invasion but can cause most serious tissue destruction [5, 7].",

Moreover, recent evidence suggests that, in parallel to the inflammatory response to the inciting injury, the body mounts an anti-inflammatory reaction termed \"compensatory anti-inflammatory response syndrome\" [8]. Upregulation of anti-inflammatory cytokines, impairment of neutrophil function, and monocyte deactivation have been implicated in this phenomenon, which is linked with impaired host defense and enhanced susceptibility to secondary infections [9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14].",

They are synthesized from arachidonic acid (AA) via multiple metabolic pathways. The family of \u03c9-6 fatty acids, including AA, is the predominant polyunsaturated fatty acids in the common Western diet and current nutritional regimes. In contrast, \u03c9-3 fatty acids [in which the last double bond is located between the third and fourth carbon atoms from the methyl end, such as eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)] make up an appreciable part of the fat in cold-water fish and seal meat. They serve as alternative lipid precursors for both cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase pathways, with the formation of trienoic prostanoids (instead of the 2-series originating from AA) and 5-series leukotrienes (LT), instead of the 4-series LTs derived from AA [16]. Interestingly, many of the \u03c9-3 fatty acid derived metabolites, including 5-series cysteinyl LTs, LTB5 and thromboxane (Tx) A3, possess markedly less inflammatory and vasomotor potency than AA-derived lipid mediators and may even exert antagonistic functions.",

Via the enteral route, however, administration for several days to weeks of \u03c9-3 lipids such as fish oil is required effectively to influence fatty acid composition of membrane (phospho)-lipids and subsequently lipid mediator profile in humans [17, 18]. Notwithstanding these limitations a diet for gastric tube feeding containing \u03c9-3 fatty acids was recently reported to significantly reduce infectious complications and mortality rate in intensive care patients [19, 20, 21]. As this regime for enteral nutrition is additionally enriched with glutamine and arginine, no definite conclusion about the role of the \u03c9-3 lipids can be drawn. Experimental prefeeding animals with \u03c9-3 lipids in place of \u03c9-6 lipids without further additives enhanced survival in subsequently provoked septic events [22, 23]. Injection of EPA, in contrast to AA, reduced organ failure in a model of septic lung injury [24]. We recently administered a fish oil based lipid emulsion intravenously in patients with inflammatory bowel and skin disease and observed rapid changes in cell membrane fatty acid composition and lipid mediator generation [25, 26].",

The magnitude of metabolic changes that we found (from more than twofold to tenfold elevated values for all single fatty acids) may reflect the severity of disease resulting from shock in all patients. Several factors may underlie this metabolic response: (a) Plasma free fatty acid elevation is a component of the general metabolic response syndrome to stress [41]. (b) Lipolysis from adipocytes and hepatic de novo lipogenesis are increased in sepsis [42, 43, 44, 45], and muscle fatty acid oxidation is reduced [46]. (c) Secretory phospholipase A2 is elevated in sepsis [47]. (d) Vasopressors such as epinephrine and norepinephrine, presently administered to all patients, preferentially increase the plasma levels of polyunsaturated free fatty acids by activating lipoprotein lipase and the hormone-sensitive lipoprotein lipase of adipose tissue [48, 49]. (e) Heparin, used in low doses in all patients, is another activator of the lipoprotein lipase [50]. Overall, these metabolic changes resulted in the most impressive appearance of free concentrations of the eicosanoid precursor AA between 25 and more than 100 \u00b5mol/l. In contrast, approximately 11 \u00b5mol/l free AA was detected in healthy controls. Moreover, measurements of free extracellular AA within an inflammatory focus suggested levels range between 20 and 50 \u00b5mol/l [51, 52, 53].",

In consequence the (EPA+DHA)/AA ratio reached nearly 2:1. The immediate appearance of free \u03c9-3 fatty acids indicates rapid hydrolysis of the EPA- and DHA-containing triglycerides in septic patients. This is in line with the notion that synthetic lipid aggregates activate endothelial lipoprotein lipases, including a translocation of this enzyme from its cellular binding sites into the vascular compartment. Resulting from activation, plasma free fatty acids increase due to escape from local cellular uptake mechanisms [54]. Kinetics and extent of plasma \u03c9-3 lipid increase thus exceed corresponding alterations in response to conventional dietary fish oil uptake by orders of magnitude [55, 56]. Interestingly, an increase in AA was also noted in the \u03c9-3 lipid infusion group. However, this rise is much less impressive than the increase in EPA and DHA levels in these patients. It may not yet be decided whether the increase in free AA results from release of the free fatty acids from the \u03c9-3 lipid infusion (which contains AA to 2.6%) or is secondarily cleaved from endogenous AA-containing lipid pools due to substitution by EPA and/or DHA.",

Determined in neutrophils ex vivo after challenge with calcium ionophore, the LTB5/LTB4 ratio was greater than 20% in these experiments. Notably, the PMN stimulation was performed in the absence of plasma. It may therefore concluded that some EPA-containing membrane lipid pool(s), providing precursor fatty acids for the neutrophil 5-lipoxygenase pathway, had rapidly exchanged with plasma EPA. Moreover, in the physiological microenvironment the LT metabolism of neutrophils is strongly influenced by the levels of exogenous free precursor fatty acids [57, 58]. Also, the dramatic impact of free EPA has been demonstrated, representing preferred substrate over free AA for the 5-lipoxygenase pathway [57]. Thus, when considering the very high values of free EPA and free DHA in the plasma of the patients undergoing \u03c9-3 lipid infusion, the appearance of an even higher percentage of LTB5 may well be anticipated for PMN activation in vivo. Such reasoning may also hold true for the platelet thromboxane generation. The TxA3/TxA2 ratio of approx. 18% noted in this study upon in vitro stimulation of washed thrombocytes may even be surpassed in vivo when platelet activation takes part in an environment of free EPA and DHA concentrations supervening those of free AA.",

However, evidence is growing that impairment of neutrophil function, including respiratory burst, becomes increasingly clear the more severe and prolonged the course of sepsis is. In a series of earlier studies in neutrophils isolated from patients with severe sepsis, Solomkin and coworkers [11, 59] demonstrated suppressed fMLP-induced superoxide generation, although fMLP receptor density and internalization were found to be unaffected. In the same line, Vespasiano et al. [60] and Pascual et al. [61] recently reported reduced superoxide release from neutrophils isolated from patients in septic shock, regardless of the stimulus used for provocation of respiratory burst. Consistent with these observations, decreased PMN superoxide generation was noted in all patients at study entry. Suppression of respiratory burst became even more prominent over subsequent days in the group receiving a conventional \u03c9-6 lipid infusion regimen. Moreover, all other features of neutrophil function addressed here were found to be suppressed in PMN originating from septic shock patients: lipid mediator generation including LTB4 and PAF, and the phosphatidylinositol response. The latter, representing an important neutrophil signal transduction pathway, may offer an underlying mechanism causally related to impairment of other neutrophil functions observed. It is in this line that Burke et al. [62] recently noted decreased Ca2+ fluxes in response to fMLP challenge in neutrophils isolated from septic patients. Further detailed studies addressing the signal transduction abnormalities in neutrophils of septic shock patients are required.",

The concept of compensatory anti-inflammatory response syndrome favors the assumption that an initial hyperinflammatory phase of the disease is followed by a counterregulatory period with predominance of anti-inflammatory mediators, with impact on the function of the immunocompetent cells [8]. Alternatively, ongoing involvement of neutrophils in inflammatory processes and microcirculatory disturbances may result in downregulation or even \"exhaustion\" of their responsiveness to further (ex vivo) stimulation. Irrespective of these open questions, the present study strongly suggests that these sequelae are differentially influenced by \u03c9-6 vs. \u03c9-3 lipid emulsions employed for parenteral nutrition. In patients receiving the conventional lipid formulation the PMN hyporesponsiveness either persisted (LTB and PAF generation) or became even more prominent in the further course (phosphoinositide hydrolysis, and superoxide). In contrast, partial restoration of a more \"normal\" responsiveness was noted in the patients infused with \u03c9-3 lipid emulsions. Given the fact that the mechanisms of neutrophil impairment in septic shock are unresolved, as discussed above, speculations as to the kind of intervention upon employment of \u03c9-3 lipids are clearly too early. However, the basic features known for the EPA-derived mediators and the more prominent (although not significant) decrease in CRP in the \u03c9-3 group suggest some dampening of ongoing inflammatory events in the presence of high plasma \u03c9-3 fatty acid levels. A corresponding mechanism was has been proposed for the clinical benefit of intravenous fish oil in severe ulcerative colitis and acute, extended guttat psoriasis [15, 63]. Supporting the idea of suppressed innate immunity due to inflammatory mediators in sepsis, Czermak and coworkers [64] have reported beneficial effects of a C5a blockade in a rat model. Inhibition of C5a-induced activation of PMN in vivo restored suppressed neutrophil respiratory burst in vitro, accompanied by increased survival of septic rats and improved bacterial clearance.",

However, the two alternative regimens for lipid-based parenteral nutrition exerted differential influence on key variables of inflammatory mediator generation and neutrophil function, both intimately involved in pathogenetic sequelae of sepsis. Under \u03c9-6 lipid infusion both the predominance of high plasma free AA levels and impairment of neutrophil functions persisted or became even more prominent. In contrast, the lipid mediator precursor profile in the plasma was rapidly shifted towards predominance of \u03c9-3 fatty acids EPA and DHA in patients receiving a fish oil based lipid emulsion. Concomitantly, partial restoration of ex vivo analyzed neutrophil functions was noted, significantly different from the \u03c9-6 infusion group. Lipid emulsions enriched in \u03c9-3 instead of \u03c9-6 fatty acids may thus offer the possibility to combine parenteral nutrition with differential impact on inflammatory variables and neutrophil function in septic patients.",
