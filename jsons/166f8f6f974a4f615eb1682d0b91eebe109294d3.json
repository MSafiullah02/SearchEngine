As a consequence, we have devel- 43 oped DisCVR, which is a fast, accurate and easy-to-use tool for detecting known human viruses 44 in clinical samples. 45 DisCVR employs an abundance-based method, which is a metagenomic approach for 46 rapidly profiling the organisms present in a sample. It works by creating a database of short nu-47 cleotide sequences (k-mers) from a large set of viral reference sequences, tagging the k-mers 48 taxonomically according to the viruses from which they came, screening each read in the HTS 49 dataset for the presence of virus k-mers, and organising a summary of the viruses present in the 50 sample via the tags. This approach makes data analysis very efficient, thereby minimizing the 51 computing effort required (Orton et al. 2016) . 52 Several existing tools utilize the abundance-based method to classify the reads in an 53 HTS dataset. NBC (Rosen et al. 2011 ) employs a na\u00efve Bayesian classifier to assign a log-likeli-54 hood score to each read. This classifier is trained by using a set of unique profiles of 15 nucleo-55 tide k-mers from microbial genomes, and then allows users to upload the dataset to a web site 56 and obtain a summary of results listing the best taxonomic match for each read. Kraken (Wood & 57 Salzberg 2014) assigns each k-mer in the database to the last common ancestor of species hav-58 ing that k-mer, and then assigns each read to the taxon with the most matching k-mers. CoMeta 59 (Kawulok & Deorowicz 2015) creates a database of all k-mers for each rank in the taxonomic 60 tree, and then uses these databases to classify the reads at each rank. CLARK (Ounit et al. 61 2015) collects target-specific k-mer sets from reference genomes belonging to a certain taxo-62 nomic rank (e.g. genus), and then classifies reads at that rank. This approach reduces the data- the entire dataset and returns the relative proportions of organisms present by using k-mer sizes 70 of 30 and 50, based on the rationale that using two different k-mer sizes allows strain-level varia-71 tion to be captured more accurately. Taxonomer (Flygare et al. 2016 ) compares each read to 72 multiple reference databases, assigning it to a high-level taxonomic category on the basis of the 73 k-mer content of the read, and then uses exact k-mer matching to assign each read to a refer-74 ence by maximizing the total k-mer weight. This weight, which is a function of the k-mer count in 75 the reference and the database, provides a database-specific measure of how likely it is that a k-76 mer originated from a particular reference sequence. Here, we present DisCVR, a k-mer-based classification tool for detecting known human tion of a k-mer, which is lexicographically the smaller of a k-mer and its reverse complement.",

A shared k-mer is defined as a k-116 mer that is common to a virus and the host. By excluding shared k-mers, it is not necessary for 117 the user to remove host reads before using DisCVR, thus speeding up the overall processing 118 time. If k is small, many copies of shared k-mers are generated, and if k is large, many copies of 119 virus k-mers are found. Choosing the optimal k-mer size depends on balancing the advantages 120 of speed (small k) with those of specificity and sensitivity (large k). Furthermore, it is necessary 121 to reduce the number of low-complexity k-mers in the virus k-mer database, as these may be re-122 petitive in sequence and present in otherwise unrelated viruses. The filtering of low-complexity k-123 mers and the selection of the size of k is explained in Supplementary Section S1.",

Unlike other tools for detecting 279 9 viruses from HTS data, DisCVR is easy to use in diagnostic settings through the graphical user 280 interface, requires no bioinformatic expertise, and can be used on the Windows operating sys-281 tems that are commonly used in diagnostic laboratories. The basic output is easy to interpret, 282 and the advanced output provides more detailed statistics and a validation capability.",

Indeed, the paper on the Nigerian patients (Stremlau et al. 2015) reported novel 285 rhabdoviruses in healthy patients using a metagenomic approach, and these were not detected 286 by DisCVR. However, metagenomics requires bioinformatic infrastructure and expertise at levels 287 that are not commonly available in diagnostic laboratories. Nonetheless, DisCVR enables the 288 detection of 148 pathogenic human viruses using one of the three implemented datasets (the 289 pathogenic dataset), and more using the others. This represents a greater than ten-fold increase 290 in target species over multiplex RT-PCR. Moreover, the number of viruses incorporated into the 291 DisCVR databases is flexible, and can also be expanded by building custom databases.",

This threshold may be set by the user and was calculated for the respiratory dataset 295 for which we had paired RT-PCR and HTS data. As more datasets with paired information be-296 come available, it will be possible to tune the threshold more accurately to specific sample types 297 and sizes.

In addition, some of the sequences in these datasets, defined largely by their presence in140    the NCBI RefSeq database, are used as a set of reference genome sequences in the validation 141 module. DisCVR also allows the user to create customised databases and sets of reference se-142 quences. The database build module involves selecting the relevant viral dataset, collecting the 143 k-mers, and removing those that are shared with the host or are of low complexity. Each remain-144 ing k-mer is then identified with a taxonomic tag and an indication of the number of times it oc-145 curs in the sequences. The k-mers are further subdivided into those that exist in a single virus 146 (i.e. specific k-mers) and those that exist in multiple viruses (i.e. non-specific k-mers).

As 154 the number of k-mers in the sample can be enormous, various data structures were considered 155 to optimize the classification on machines with limited RAM. Although searching the trie is fast 156 O(n), where n is the size of the k-mer, it requires O(n 2 ) overall time to build, and the space 157 needed is quadratic. Instead, DisCVR uses a fast searching algorithm that groups similar k-mers 158 together. Briefly, the k-mers in the virus database are divided among smaller sub-files according 159 to the first five nucleotides. The same procedure is used to divide the k-mers derived from the 160 entire HTS dataset. Searching commences by loading the corresponding sub-files from the virus 161 k-mer database and the sample k-mers into memory, and performing a binary search for the 162 presence of each sample k-mer among the database k-mers.

The samples had been tested using a standard real-time 180 PCR (RT-PCR) assay for human rhinovirus (HRV), influenza viruses A and B (IFA/IFB), respira-181 tory syncytial virus (RSV), adenovirus (ADV), human metapneumovirus (hMPV), parainfluenza 182 viruses (PIV) 1-4, and human coronaviruses (HCoV) HKU1, NL63, OC43 and 229E (Thorburn et 183 al. 2015). The top hit for each sample (i.e. the virus having the greatest number of distinct k-184 mers) using DisCVR was compared to the virus detected previously by RT-PCR. The samples 185 were also classified using three independent k-mer-based programs that require command-line 186 usage on a Linux operating system: Kraken (Wood & Salzberg 2014), KrakenHLL (Breitwieser & 187 Salzberg 2018) and CLARK (Ounit et al. 2015). 188 The initial objective was to determine the number of distinct k-mers that would maximize 189 both sensitivity (effectiveness in identifying samples containing viruses) and specificity (effective-190 ness in identifying samples lacking viruses) for DisCVR. The output of DisCVR was categorized 191 on the basis of the number of distinct k-mers for the top hit, and that of the other programs was 192 assessed on the basis of the number of reads assigned to the top hit. For each tool, sensitivity 193 and specificity were defined as TP/(TP+FN) and TN/(TN+FP), respectively, where TP, FN, TN 194 and FP are the number of true positive, false negative, true negative and false positive samples 195 relative to the RT-PCR results.

An important finding was made in two of these samples (1B5 and 1D3), in 252 which the viruses detected by RT-PCR were not the top hits but still had \u2265850 distinct k-mers in 253 the sample(Table 1). This suggests that these patients were infected by multiple viruses. Finally,254 DisCVR did not detect any k-mers for the virus detected by RT-PCR in two samples (1C9 and 255 2D4), but identified HRV-A in 1C9, which was validated by reference assembly. The validation 256 module thus yielded strong evidence for the presence of the viruses detected by DisCVR, at 257 least where the number of k-mers was \u2265850.

In nine cases, the top hit from DisCVR differed from the 263 top BLAST hit, but the second hit matched. In 55 cases, the number of k-mers was below the 264 threshold in DisCVR, and the number of reads with BLAST matches was also low (an average of 265 24 reads per dataset). In the remaining 12 discordant samples, DisCVR detected human immu-266 nodeficiency virus 1 (n = 9), XMRV-related virus (n = 1) and human T-lymphotropic virus 1 (n =1) 267 as the top hit, whereas the BLAST results supported the presence of human adenovirus or Het-268 erosigma akashiwo RNA virus (an algal virus).
