            "text": "The protection level offered by filtering facepiece particulate respirators and face masks is defined by the percentage of ambient particles penetrating inside the protection device. There are two penetration pathways: (1) through the faceseal leakage, and the (2) filter medium. This study aimed at differentiating the contributions of these two pathways for particles in the size range of 0.03-1 \u00b5m under actual breathing conditions. One N95 filtering facepiece respirator and one surgical mask commonly used in health care environments were tested on 25 subjects (matching the latest National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health fit testing panel) as the subjects performed conventional fit test exercises. The respirator and the mask were also tested with breathing manikins that precisely mimicked the prerecorded breathing patterns of the tested subjects. The penetration data obtained in the human subjectand manikin-based tests were compared for different particle sizes and breathing patterns. Overall, 5250 particle sizeand exercise-specific penetration values were determined. For each value, the faceseal leakage-to-filter ratio was calculated to quantify the relative contributions of the two penetration pathways. The number of particles penetrating through the faceseal leakage of the tested respirator/mask far exceeded the number of those penetrating through the filter medium. For the N95 respirator, the excess was (on average) by an order of magnitude and significantly increased with an increase in particle size (p < 0.001): \u223c7-fold greater for 0.04 \u00b5m, \u223c10-fold for 0.1 \u00b5m, and \u223c20-fold for 1 \u00b5m. For the surgical mask, the faceseal leakage-to-filter ratio ranged from 4.8 to 5.8 and was not significantly affected by the particle size for the tested submicrometer fraction. Facial/body movement had a pronounced effect on the relative contribution of the two penetration pathways. Breathing intensity and facial dimensions showed some (although limited) influence. Because most of the penetrated particles entered through the faceseal, the priority in respirator/mask development should be shifted from improving the efficiency of the filter medium to establishing a better fit that would eliminate or minimize faceseal leakage.",

In 2008, the Institute of Medicine reported that during an influenza pandemic, it may be necessary to protect more than 13 million health care workers (HCW) from illness or from infecting their families or patients. (1) The nonoccupational use of various RPD is expected to rise dramatically in the event of a disease outbreak or a bioterrorist attack. Although N95 FFRs are designed to protect a wearer from inhaling ambient aerosol particles, the main function of a surgical mask is to protect others from the aerosol expelled by its wearer. Nonetheless, applications of surgical masks in some health care settings have evolved over time, promoting their widespread use as RPDs (a subject of ongoing debate in the health care industry). (2) Currently, NIOSH certifies respirators in accordance with Title 42 of the Code of Federal Regulations. (3) Their efficiency is evaluated by testing the filter media under constant airflow. However, measuring the particle penetration under constant flow may not accurately predict the filter efficiency under actual cyclic or pulsatile breathing conditions. (4, 5) In addition, the existing filter certification procedure evaluates filter efficiency but not faceseal leaks, which can be an important penetration pathway for aerosol particles. When N95 FFRs are required, the respirator wearer must pass a fit test before being used in the workplace. The fit test measures total aerosol penetration, i.e., occurring through the filter medium and through the faceseal leaks. No method clearly differentiates between the two pathways under actual breathing conditions. Chen and Willeke (6) and Chen et al. (7) investigated faceseal versus filter penetration for particles of 0.5-5 \u00b5m, but their experiments were performed with a breathing manikin under constant-flow conditions and artificially created faceseal leaks.",

Each subject performed a variety of head and breathing exercises (9) that were modified to include a longer, 2-min in-facepiece sampling time. This modified fit testing procedure allowed for determination of exercisespecific penetration values for the tested N95 respirator and surgical mask. Figure 1A schematically presents the experimental setup for testing RPDs donned by a human subject. A similar setup was used previously by Lee et al. (10) for investigating total penetration of 0.03-1 \u00b5m particles into N95 FFRs and surgical masks. The testing was conducted in a room-size chamber (24.3 m 3 ). A solution of NaCl in ultrapure water was aerosolized with a 6jet Collison nebulizer (BGI Inc., Waltham, Mass.). The freshly generated aerosol was diluted and dried with HEPA-filtered air, charge-equilibrated to a Boltzmann charge distribution using a Kr 85 sealed source (model 3054; TSI Inc., Minneapolis, Minn.) and fed to the test chamber.",

The utilization of the actual breathing patterns produced by the subjects wearing RPDs provides a more realistic flow through the filter than a sinusoidal flow pattern employed in earlier studies.

On the other hand, ideally, the sampling flow rate should be kept well below of the total flow when conducting fit testing.

Thus, we believe that the priority in product development should be given to establishing a better fit that would eliminate or minimize the faceseal leakage.

Across the board, the penetration associated with each pathway was significantly affected by particle size (p < 0.001). At the same time, when calculated for the particle size fraction of up to 0.20 \u00b5m, the penetration associated with the faceseal leakage was not significantly influenced by the size of aerosol particles. This finding does not extend to the particle penetration through the mask's filter medium. Obviously, the penetration levels determined for the surgical mask were much higher as compared with those obtained for the N95 respirator. The results agree with the study by Lee et al., (10) that showed 8-12 times higher total penetration for surgical masks compared with N95 FFRs. The overall FLTF ratio is plotted against particle size in Figure 5. By comparing the subject-and manikin-generated penetration values obtained under the same breathing pattern (actual and simulated), we found that the particle flux through the faceseal leakage of the N95 respirator exceeded the flux through the filter medium by approximately an order of magnitude. On average, the difference was \u223c7-fold for 0.04-\u00b5m, \u223c10-fold for 0.1-\u00b5m, and \u223c20-fold for 1-\u00b5m parti-",
