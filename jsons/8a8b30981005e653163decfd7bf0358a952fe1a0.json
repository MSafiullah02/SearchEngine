Dialysis patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection have a higher risk of dying than transplant patients, this circumstance is probably related to older age and comorbidity (a variable not recorded in the Registry). In the last report from the Ministry of Health, April 13th (2) mortality in the age group of 70-79 years was 13.9%, half of what we found in our dialysis patients Registry . The high risk of complications in patients on RRT must be taken into consideration. The analysis of factors independently associated with the risk of death show that age and the development of pneumonia determine a worse prognosis. Furthermore, in the group of patients on dialysis, the use of hydroxychloroquine is associated with a lower rate of deaths; however, the significance of this last finding requires studies in a larger number of patients . Presently there is controversy about the beneficial effect of hydroxychloroquine. In in vitro studies, this drug has shown activity against various viruses, including coronaviruses and influenza (12 ) . A French study, found some benefit from its use but number of patients was limited ( 13 ) ; by contrast , another study from China does not find that patients treated with hydroxychloroquine have better recovery rates (14 ) . In our study, the beneficial effect of hydroxychloroquine is found in dialysis, but not in transplant patients. Nevertheless our registry show that , hydroxychloroquine and other commonly used drugs in the SARS-CoV infection-2 are used more frequently in transplant than in dialysis patients. Ongoing controlled studies will show if the use of these drugs is beneficial .",

Some of the initial publications warned about the possibility that the use of these drugs (indicated in the treatment of hypertension, heart failure, ischemic heart disease, etc. ) may increase the risk of infection by SARS-CoV-2. The rational is that, to infect cells virus binds to Angiotensin II converting enzyme (ACE 2), and this enzyme appears to be overexpressed in subjects on ACE inhibitors or Angiotensin II receptor antagonist ( ARA 2) ( 15 ) . However, experiment in animals models have suggested that the use of ARA2 can mitigate infection by attenuating Angiotensin II-mediated acute lung injury by blocking the Angiotensin II type 1 receptor ( 16 ) . A recent meta-analysis suggests a beneficial effect of ARA 2 on the severity of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia in elderly patients (17) . For all these reasons, the health authorities recommend maintaining the indication of these drugs ( 18 ) .",
