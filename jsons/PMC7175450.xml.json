It has widely and rapidly spread in China and several other countries, causing an outbreak of COVID-19 [2]. Although the population is generally susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, most of the patients who need to be admitted to hospital are elderly or with chronic underlying diseases [3]. Clinical observations have found that many elderly patients with COVID-19 are at risk of malnutrition or co-malnutrition. Moreover, SARS-CoV-2 can attack the mucosal epithelium and cause gastrointestinal symptoms, which further damage the nutritional status of elderly patients [4]. In order to scientifically evaluate the nutritional status of elderly patients with COVID-19, we conducted the cross-sectional study. To our knowledge, this is the first study to evaluate the state of nutrition in elderly patients with COVID-19.",

Currently, there was still lack of effective specific drug treatment in clinical practice, and supportive treatment was still the main treatment [11, 12]. The overall prognosis of elderly patients was worse than that of young and middle-aged patients. One reason may be the poor nutritional status of elderly patients.

            "text": "Malnutrition was a nutritional disorder that caused adverse reactions to normal human functioning and was more common in elderly patient groups [14]. A study that summarized 12 countries or regions found that the overall incidence of malnutrition in the elderly was about 23%, with a 50.5% higher incidence in rehabilitation institutions and a 38.7% incidence in hospitalized patients [15]. The incidence of malnutrition in elderly patients with COVID-19 was higher. The main reasons may be as follows. First, the protein that made up muscles was consumed by the acute inflammatory response of neo-coronavirus infection. Patients\u2019 inflammation indicators increased generally, such as C-reactive protein, ferritin, tumor necrosis factor alpha, interleukin family factors, etc [16]. The synthesis of these acute-phase proteins required the consumption of albumin and even muscle protein [16]. This was consistent with the results of the regression analysis of the study. The patient\u2019s albumin level and calf circumference were significantly lower. Similarly, hypoalbuminemia and low calf circumference were commonly used as important indicators for evaluating malnutrition [17, 18]. Second, among elderly patients with COVID-19, comorbidity in diabetes mellitus was much more than general population. In other words, high rates of comorbid diabetes mellitus led to higher rates of malnutrition in elderly patients with COVID-19. Diabetes patients due to their own internal glandular dysfunction, had disorders in metabolism of the three major nutrients, which was the internal cause of malnutrition [19, 20]. At the same time, diabetic patients\u2019 diet control, improper nutrient ratio and other factors were external causes of malnutrition [21]. Moreover, the inflammatory response caused by SARS-CoV-2 and the application of glucocorticoids resulted in fluctuations in blood glucose, which was related to pathogenesis [22]. Third, gastrointestinal symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-2 exacerbated malnutrition in elderly patients. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 was also highly expressed in the gastrointestinal track [23]. So the gastrointestinal tract was also the main target of SARS-CoV-2 attack [24, 25]. Clinically, in addition to respiratory symptoms, gastrointestinal symptoms were the most in elderly patients with COVID-19. Diarrhea, mild abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, poor appetite, and other symptoms were very common [26]. The involvement of the digestive tract had accelerated the occurrence of malnutrition in elderly patients with COVID-19. Fourth, the poor appetite of the patients was also related to the patient\u2019s anxiety [27]. The Chinese experienced the epidemic of SARS induced by coronavirus in 2003, just like COVID-19. People were so impressed with the SARS epidemic that many patients still had psychological problems after 6 years [28]. Therefore, Chinese were very sensitive to COVID-19, and its epidemic could easily cause anxiety among patients. Patients\u2019 fear of their own illness, worrying about long-term isolation, and desire for normal social communication, led to anxiety, which further reduced the appetite of the patient and further aggravated malnutrition. At the same time, anxiety disrupted homeostasis [29], which was also a contributing factor to malnutrition.",

And admitted patients were also designated by the government. So there must be some selective bias. Second, there must be some other risk factors, such as lifestyle habits, physical activity and social support, may also significantly affect the nutritional conditions of patients, but these factors were not analyzed in the current study. Hence, more future studies need to be carried out to further clarify these issues.",
