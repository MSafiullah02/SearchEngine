In our study, 81.3% of the adenoviral infections occurred in young children between 6 months and 5 years of age. Similar demographic features have been reported in other studies.13, 14 According to Pereira's report, children aged 5 years had higher antibody positivity against adenovirus, and most infections happened in children younger than 5 years.15 Infants less than 6 months of age are known to have a neutralizing antibody by maternal transmission, which appears to be protective during the first 6 months of life. The frequency of infection was low in infants under 6 months of age; however, a severe case, such as encephalitis, as reported in this study, may occur. The male to female ratio was 1.6:1.

Also, many patients appeared to have gastrointestinal symptoms with hepatic involvement, as determined by a mild to high elevation of liver enzymes. Adenovirus was detected in the CSF of one infant who was diagnosed with encephalitis. According to our study, the clinical manifestation of adenovirus infection varied, with multiple organ involvement.

Others have reported that adenoviral infection typically results in elevated ESR and CRP levels, unlike what is seen in other viral diseases.25, 26 Therefore, it is not surprising that many patients were initially treated with antibiotics.
