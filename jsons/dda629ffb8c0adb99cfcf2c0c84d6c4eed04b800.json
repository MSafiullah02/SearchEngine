It shares approximately 94% identity of nucleotide sequence with two recently reported North American strains, 16244B and VR2332, but only 78% with a European strain, Lelystad virus (LV). Its genome is the longest among the four published complete sequences of PRRSV, due to an insertion in the Nsp2-encoding region. Compared to Nsp2 of the North American strains and the European strain, the predicted Nsp2 of strain SP contains 36 and 155 amino acid insertions, respectively, near the C-terminus, in addition to several highly variable regions. The insertion shows no homology with any equivalent arterivirus proteins. This high sequence disparity of Nsp2 among different PRRSV isolates suggested that it could be used as a marker to differentiate PRRSV genotypes. The 5 RACE and primer extension analysis of three North American strains demonstrated that the utmost 5 -end nucleotides are conserved among PRRSV strains isolated from two continents. The predicted polyprotein 1a/b contains conserved proteinase, polymerase and helicase domains responsible for polyprotein processing, RNA transcription and replication.",

PRRSV is a member of the family Arteriviridae in the order Nidovirales [4] , together with equine arteritis virus (EAV), lactate dehydrogenase elevating virus (LDV) and simian hemorrhagic fever virus (SHFV). It is a small, enveloped virus with a positive, single-stranded RNA genome [23] . The genomic RNA is 5 -capped and 3 -polyadenylated and contains two large open reading frames (ORF 1a and 1b) coding for two large polyproteins (1a and 1a/1b). In the case of EAV, these polyproteins are processed to mature, nonstructural proteins (Nsp1 to Nsp12) by three 1a-encoded proteinases [23] . The 1a and 1a/b polyproteins of PRRSV contain similar cleavage sites but only the cleavage of Nsp1\u2423 and Nsp1\u2424 by two papain-like proteinases has been demonstrated [6] . The viral structural proteins are encoded by six subgenomic RNAs [23] .",

            "text": "Sequence comparison between PRRSV isolates reveals that there are two major genotypes represented by North American and European prototypes LV [11] and VR2332 [13] , respectively, and perhaps more minor genotypes among North American strains. This conclusion was drawn largely based on sequence comparison of the structural regions [2, 13, 26] , as data on the nonstructural region of North American strains were not available until recently [1, 13, 14] . The sequence diversity in the structural regions is reflected in antigenic differences between North American and European isolates as well as within the major genotypes [5, 7, 12] . The genetic diversity in terms of gene length and sequence variation may also exist in the 1a region within PRRSV isolates as suggested by insertions and deletions in the 1a genes of EAV, LVD and SHFV [23] . Vaccines against PRRSV infection in pigs have been available through great efforts since the isolation of the virus. However, mechanisms of attenuation are still poorly understood, partly due to the relatively slow accumulation of sequence data in the 5 -NCR and the nonstructural protein-encoding region of the genome. Sequence analysis of these regions of more isolates may be of help to a better understanding of the PRRSV pathogenicity and to the assessment of reverse mutations of live vaccine strains [3] . The aim of this study was therefore to investigate the genetic variation in the 5 -NCR, 1a and 1b regions of the North American strains and to identify the most variable region of the viral genome.",

As shown in Table 2 , SP shares a high degree of homology with strain 16244B at both nucleotide and amino acid sequence levels, while considerable divergence exists between SP and strain LV in both structural and nonstructural regions.

These reports showed significant differences in the 5 -end NCR of the two North American strains. First, the first 12 nucleotides at the 5 -end of strain VR2332 are more similar to the European strain LV than to strain 16244B, despite the fact that strains VR2332 and LV represent two major genotypes of PRRSV emerged from two continents, while VR2332 and 16244B Fig. 4 . Alignment of the predicted Nsp2 sequences of PRRSV strains SP, VR2332 and 16244B. Conserved residues are indicated by dashes. The 36 amino acid insertion in the Nsp2 of strain SP is shown in bold. Putative catalytic residues Cys 1a437 and His 1a506 are indicated by asterisks. Positions of amino acid residues are given to the right of the alignment belong to closely related North American genotype. Second, the utmost 5 -end nucleotide is a C for 16244B [1] , but a T for VR2332 [14] . Finally, seven nucleotides among the first ten of 16244B are different from those of VR2332. We were interested to investigate the genetic variations in the utmost 5 -end sequence of more North American strains. Using both the 5 RACE and the primer extension techniques, the 5 -ends of three viruses (SP, VR2332, and 12068-94p) were shown to be identical: the utmost 5 -end nucleotide is an A for each isolate and conserved with that of strain LV. To confirm these results, the 5 RACE was repeated at least three times for each isolate. We believe that incubation of the TMV reverse transcriptase at high temperature (55 \u2022 C) is critical for the enzyme to overcome the secondary structures and reach the end of its template. The result may be helpful to clarify the controversy on the 5 -end sequence reported recently [1, 12, 14] and may be crucial for making a full-length infectious cDNA originated from North American strains. Sequence comparison revealed that the most variable region of PRRSV located within the 1a gene, especially the Nsp2-encoding region, in which an insertion and several highly variable regions were identified. In addition to the insertion, this protein contains 158 amino acid residue substitutes (Fig. 4) . The variable regions may be associated with cell and tissue tropism for PRRSV and may be involved in species-specific functions for arteriviruses. The finding is the first experiment evidence showing that considerable variations exist within the closely related PRRSV isolates, suggesting that further classification of genotypes within the major North American serotype (genotype) may be required. Since the first report of PRRSV, isolates with different genetic background have been documented [2, 8, 17] . It is suggested that rapid molecular evolution of PRRSV may occur, perhaps adding difficulty to the control of PRRSV infection of swine herds worldwide. The Nsp2 gene may be an ideal marker for monitoring the genetic variation and for developing differential diagnostic means. As this gene seems to be more tolerable to mutations and insertions, it might be capable of harboring foreign genes if an arterivirus vector is to be developed. On the other hand, it would be interesting to investigate if the insertion would affect the biological function(s) of Nsp2, for example, the proteolytic activity at the Nsp2/Nsp3 junction of the 1a and 1a/b polyproteins.",
