Social historians have argued that the reason the 1918\u201319 pandemic left so few traces in public memory is that it was overshadowed by the First World War; hence its historiographical characterization as the \u201dforgotten pandemic\u201d due to the crucial role played by wartime propaganda 1. For context, a public health report on response to that pandemic in the city of Minneapolis showed that critical information about the virus was spread primarily via postal workers, Boy Scouts, and teachers 2.",

The biggest challenge may be to deliver information to the people who are at the battlefront in severely affected areas faster than the dissemination rate of the disease. Many scientific journals have allowed open access for most manuscripts on COVID-19. For health professionals, this may be adequate. However, for the general population, this has no impact on raising awareness. These days, people are overwhelmed by the information they receive on their smartphones through channels such as Facebook, Twitter, WhatsApp, YouTube and Instagram. The biggest problem is in determining which news to trust. Even a pandemic can be used as a political battle, where some will recommend social isolation while others recommend doing nothing that will stop the economy. Who is right, the ones who recommend chloroquine or those who tell you to take your antipyretic medicine and stay home if you have mild symptoms? It is not uncommon to see hundreds of daily texts, videos and even scientific publications in social media groups defending each argument.",

Social media platforms can also provide helpful direction during this crisis. Facebook, for example, redirects users to World Health Organization (WHO) websites where trustworthy information can be obtained 8. Furthermore, social media can be used for education. Physicians are hosting webinars not only to conduct discussions about COVID-19 but also to talk about their specialties, since most conferences have either been canceled or postponed. Another interesting use of social media during this pandemic is to gather data from people who are in lockdown. Information on symptoms, interactions, and travel routes can all be used to fight the virus and better understand how it spreads.",
