These have led to interspecies transmission of numerous emerging pathogens in the past few decades, such as avian influenza viruses, severe acute respiratory syndrome and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronaviruses, Ebola virus, and other viruses causing hemorrhagic fever (Chan et al., 2015; MacNeil and Rollin, 2012; Marsh and Wang, 2012; To et al., 2013; To et al., 2015). The latest emerging viral epidemic that was declared as an international health emergency is the one caused by Zika virus (ZIKV) (Musso and Gubler, 2016). ZIKV is a human-pathogenic flavivirus that has been neglected until recently, when it was found that ZIKV infection may be associated with severe clinical complications, including congenital microcephaly and other anomalies, neurological complications such as Guillain-Barre syndrome and meningoencephalitis, ophthalmological defects, auditory impairment, and rarely, multi-organ involvement and death (Chan et al., 2016b; Musso and Gubler, 2016).",

For example, ZIKV infection may manifest as an acute febrile illness with rash and systemic upset which may be indistinguishable from dengue fever and other viral hemorrhagic fever syndromes (Chan et al., 2016b; Duffy et al., 2009). Moreover, ZIKV may co-circulate with other viruses in the same geographical regions and co-infect the same patient (Musso and Gubler, 2016). As in the case of most other emerging viral infections, there are currently limited treatment options proven to be effective and safe for ZIKV infection. Thus, broad-spectrum agents that can be used as empirical treatment for patients with an acute undifferentiated febrile illness before the diagnosis is confirmed by laboratory tests are urgently needed.",

For example, host cellular kinases have been increasingly implicated in the pathogenesis of viral infections as they may be exploited by viruses to facilitate their own replication (Chu and Yang, 2007; Linero and Scolaro, 2009; Saeed et al., 2008; Urata et al., 2012). For flaviviruses, the phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase/protein kinase B (PI3K/Akt) pathway has been shown to enhance viral replication through counteracting virus-induced cellular apoptosis (Lee et al., 2005; Tsai et al., 2014). AR-12 (OSU-03012), an FDA-approved investigational new drug (IND) compound, is a celecoxib derivative kinase inhibitor that does not inhibit cyclooxygenase activity, but instead downregulates the PI3K/Akt pathway which are involved in multiple cell signaling pathways (Chen et al., 2017; Mohr et al., 2015). AR-12 has been evaluated in phase I clinical trials as an anticancer agent in adult patients with advanced or recurrent solid tumors or lymphoma (Clinical Trials registration no. NCT00978523).",

Importantly, the European Commission has designated AR-12 as an orphan drug that could be used clinically in combination with other anti-infective agents for treatment of cryptococcosis (with fluconazole) and tularemia (with gentamicin) (Booth et al., 2016). These clinical experiences make AR-12 a clinically readily available drug for emerging infectious diseases lacking effective treatment options. Recently, AR-12 was reported to have in vitro and in vivo antiviral activity against dengue virus (DENV), another flavivirus that is closely related to the emerging ZIKV (Chen et al., 2017; Hassandarvish et al., 2017). We therefore hypothesized that this broad-spectrum host-targeting antiviral drug may also exhibit inhibitory activity against ZIKV. In this study, we evaluated the in vitro and in vivo antiviral activity of AR-12 against ZIKV and investigated the mechanism of AR-12's anti-ZIKV activity.",

The antiviral activity of AR-12 against ZIKV was confirmed even at high MOI by both qRT-PCR and plaque assays (Fig. 5\n). We next further evaluated the impact of AR-12 on the antigen expression of ZIKV-PR in neuronal cells with flow cytometry (Fig. 6\n). Remarkably, our result demonstrated that AR-12 significantly inhibited the expression of both the envelope protein (Fig. 6A) and non-structural protein 1 (Fig. 6B) of ZIKV-PR in the infected cells.

Moreover, the mean ZIKV RNA loads in the blood and necropsied tissues of these AR-12-treated mice at necropsy were generally 0.8\u20131.5 logs lower than those of the untreated mice (Fig. 7C). We also evaluated regimens of delayed administration of AR-12 either intraperitoneally or by oral gavage to ZIKV-infected mice at 48 hpi to more closely mimic clinical situations in which viremic patients do not receive treatment immediately after infection. The improved clinical and virological parameters were more obvious in the mice treated with the oral regimen, which consisted of a much higher dose (200 mg/kg) of AR-12 than the intraperitoneal regimen (25 mg/kg) (Fig. 7). These findings illustrated that AR-12 not only inhibited ZIKV in vitro, but also in vivo, especially if given early or at a high dose.",

Surprisingly, in contrast to this previous report, we did not find AR-12 to be downregulating GRP-78 (Fig. 8\nA). Instead, we found that AR-12 substantially downregulated the phosphorylation of the Akt protein (Fig. 8B). In this regard, our data suggested that AR-12 potentially inhibited ZIKV replication by negatively regulating the Akt signaling pathway. To further investigate if the Akt signaling pathway modulated ZIKV replication, we treated ZIKV-infected Huh-7 cells with an Akt inhibitor, Akt inhibitor VIII, which has been previously shown to inhibit Akt activation (Lindsley et al., 2005). Interestingly, our result demonstrated that ZIKV replication was significantly (P < 0.05) inhibited in the presence of Akt inhibitor VIII (Fig. 8C). The involvement of the Akt signaling pathway in ZIKV replication was further validated with siRNA knockdown (Fig. 8D). Akt knockdown resulted in a significant (P < 0.01) decrease in ZIKV replication, which was in agreement with the result of the Akt inhibitor VIII experiment (Fig. 8E). Taken together, these findings suggested that AR-12 inhibits ZIKV replication through downregulation of the Akt signaling pathway.",

            "text": "Host-targeting treatment options for ZIKV remain scarce. We have previously shown the in vitro and in vivo anti-ZIKV activity of recombinant interferons, but their side effect profiles may limit their clinical use, especially in pregnant women (Chan et al., 2017a; Chan et al., 2016d). A recent study reported the in vitro anti-ZIKV activity of a protein kinase A inhibitor (PKI 14\u201322) in endothelial cells and astrocytes. Another recent study reported that the activation of adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase by a small molecule activator (PF-06409577) inhibited ZIKV replication through modulation of host cell lipid metabolism (Jim\u00e9nez de Oya et al., 2018). These findings supported our hypothesis that drugs which target host signaling pathways may be useful for treating ZIKV infection (Cheng et al., 2018). During the preparation of this work, AR-12 and a few other kinase inhibitors were recently identified to exhibit in vitro anti-ZIKV activity in human osteosarcoma (U2OS) cells in a drug screening programme (Rausch et al., 2017). However, no further validation of this preliminary finding in other clinically relevant cell lines or suitable animal model was reported, and the anti-ZIKV mechanism of AR-12 was not investigated. In this study, we demonstrated the anti-ZIKV activity of AR-12 in vitro and in vivo, and provided novel insights into the drug's anti-ZIKV mechanism.",

This was important as both lineages of ZIKV are considered to be pathogenic to human. Moreover, treatment with AR-12 provided cell protection effects against ZIKV-induced damage. The anti-ZIKV activity of AR-12 was then validated in multiple cell types, including neuronal cells which are clinically relevant for the neurotropic ZIKV. Importantly, type I interferon receptor-deficient A129 mice treated with AR-12 (either early or delayed regimen) had significantly higher survival rates and lower viral loads than untreated mice, suggesting that the anti-ZIKV effect of AR-12 was not only present in vitro, but also in a lethal animal model. We further demonstrated that AR-12 inhibited the phosphorylation of Akt, which is a downstream component of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway that promotes flavivirus replication by counteracting virus-induced cellular apoptosis.",

For example, the CC50, IC50, and selectivity index values of AR-12 against other hemorrhagic fever viruses were comparable with our findings for ZIKV (Mohr et al., 2015). For flaviviruses, there was about 1 log reduction of DENV RNA load with 2\u20134 \u03bcM AR-12 and the IC50 values of AR-12 against DENV serotypes 1\u20134 were between 0.60 \u03bcM and 0.80 \u03bcM in Vero cells (Hassandarvish et al., 2017). The CC50 of AR-12 was higher in Vero cells (65.90 \u03bcM) than in our Huh-7 and neuronal cells, suggesting that the selectivity index of AR-12 against flaviviruses may be even higher in other cell types (up to >100) (Hassandarvish et al., 2017). In DENV-infected suckling mice treated with AR-12 intracranially and intraperitoneally, there was about 0.5\u20130.7 log reduction in infectious virus particles (plaque forming units) in their brain tissues (Chen et al., 2017). In comparison, virus-targeting drugs often achieve a higher degree of viral load reduction (>2 logs) in vitro and in vivo. For example, the ZIKV NS2B-NS3 protease inhibitor novobiocin reduces ZIKV RNA load by \u2265 2 logs both in vitro (Vero and Huh-7 cells) and in the blood and tissues of ZIKV-infected mice (Yuan et al., 2017). Our recently described antiviral peptide (Z2 peptide) targeting the stem region of the ZIKV envelope protein to inhibit virus entry into host cells significantly reduced viral RNA load in ZIKV-infected interferon receptor-deficient mice and inhibited vertical transmission of ZIKV in pregnant C57BL/6 mice (Yu et al., 2017). These findings are not unexpected as our mice only received one dose of AR-12 treatment post-infection and because AR-12's antiviral mechanism via downregulation of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway is not as direct as those of virus-targeting drugs.",
