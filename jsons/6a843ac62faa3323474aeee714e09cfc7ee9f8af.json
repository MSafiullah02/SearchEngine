We wish to commend the authors on developing this technique, which has a great benefit of containing and facilitating the disposal of contaminated surfaces surrounding the patient's airway at the end of the surgical case.",

We found that when intubation of the airway was challenging, manipulating the laryngoscope under a sheet proved to be problematic. Although Brown et al 1 proposed the removal of the clear drape during midlaryngoscopy as an option should difficulties with intubation arise, elimination of the barrier sheet defeats its purpose of protecting the operating room staff, and may further aerosolize viral particles on and under the drape when it is removed in an emergent manner.",

Because of its small profile, only a small X is needed to introduce the intubating device and endotracheal tube (Figure, panel C). When using the video stylet, we cover the second cross with a small transparent film dressing, making a small nick in the center of the dressing with a surgical blade. As the stylet and endotracheal tube are introduced, the hole in the film will dilate in size to accommodate the endotracheal tube, while the elasticity of the dressing allows it to adhere around the tube, minimizing the defect in the plastic barrier. If a videolaryngoscope is utilized for intubation, the cross is widened to 3 \u00d7 3 cm to accommodate passage of both the disposable blade and the endotracheal tube. A transparent dressing should not be utilized with videolaryngoscopy as the film's adhesive nature may interfere with the maneuvering of laryngoscope or endotracheal tube, but a dressing can be placed Adaptation to the Plastic Barrier Sheet to Facilitate Intubation During the COVID-19 Pandemic Figure.

The use of a transparent acrylic intubation shield has been proposed and may afford improved visibility but would require construction of the device as well as disinfection of the unit after each use. 3 In addition, patient anatomy may preclude effective manipulation of the airway through the 2 circular openings. A potential negative aspect of our modified drape technique is the theoretical transmission of viral particles into the operating room through the defect in the barrier. However, we feel that the risk of contamination is low, and our modified technique improves the success rate of the initial intubation attempt, especially when a difficult airway is encountered. If additional protection is desired, using 2 plastic drapes as a double layer can further reduce the risk of accidental transmission, as the Xs on both sheets would have to be aligned in order for aerosolization of viral particles to occur.",
