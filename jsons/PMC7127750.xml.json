The virus was first identified in 1975 in infants who developed diarrhea in hospital nurseries in the United Kingdom.1., 2. HAstV is a small, single-stranded, positive-sense RNA virus with an ~ 6.8\u2010kb genome. The 5\u2032-terminal two-thirds of the genome [open reading frame (ORF)-1a and ORF-1b] encodes two major nonstructural proteins, a serine protease whose structure has been solved by X-ray crystallography3 and an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. The 3\u2032-terminal one-third of the genome (ORF-2) encodes the structural protein VP90, which is translated as an 87\u2010 to 90\u2010kDa capsid precursor protein. VP90 has a highly conserved N-terminal domain and a variable C-terminal domain among astrovirus serotypes.",

While their genomes are fairly well conserved,4., 5., 6. the mature virions of different serotypes vary somewhat in the exact size and number of structural proteins that form the capsid (reviewed by Krishna7). The current consensus is that morphogenesis of infectious particles relies on a series of proteolytic cleavages of the capsid precursor protein (Fig. 1\n). VP90 assembles in infected cells and undergoes C-terminal cleavages by caspases to generate VP70 (a 70\u2010 to 79\u2010kDa protein) for release from the cells as immature virus particles.8 Generation of infectious particles is dependent upon further trypsin cleavages usually resulting in three structural proteins, VP34, VP27, and VP25, each of which range in actual size and name depending on the serotype.9., 10., 11. VP34 contains the conserved N-terminal domain and is ascribed to the capsid, while the overlapping VP27 and VP25 subunits contain the variable C-domain and are ascribed to the viral spikes.7., 12. VP25 is generated by additional trimming at the N-terminus of VP27.11\n",

We examined (1) immature HAstV-8 particles composed of the 70\u2010kDa intermediate protein, which has undergone caspase but not trypsin cleavage and is therefore not infectious, and (2) fully cleaved, mature infectious particles of HAstV-1. The sequences of the two strains are extremely similar, with 83% identity in the conserved domain and 60% identity in the variable domain. Therefore, we expect that our three-dimensional (3D) reconstructions are representative of the Astroviridae family. Although the capsid shells of both immature and mature HAstVs are nearly identical, there is a striking difference in the apparent stoichiometry of the surface spikes. Immature, uncleaved particles, which are strikingly similar in appearance to HEV-like particles (HEV-lp),14 have 90 spikes, whereas mature, cleaved particles only display 30 spikes, all located at the icosahedral 2-fold axes. Loss of the 60 peripentonal spikes likely plays an important role in viral infectivity.",

Icosahedral image analysis of electron cryomicrographs (Fig. 2\n) yielded 3D maps at ~ 25 \u00c5 resolution (Fig. 3a and b). Both particles display two concentric layers of density that conform to T\n = 3 icosahedral lattice symmetry. A nearly identical inner layer forms a solid capsid shell ~ 45 \u00c5 thick with an outer diameter of ~ 350 \u00c5. This capsid shell has a chiseled appearance assembled from 180 protein subunits in which trimeric facets form a plateau (Fig. 3a and b, bottom). The trimeric facets are in close contact across the icosahedral 2-fold (2F) symmetry axes, with depressions at the 5-fold (5F) and 3-fold (3F) symmetry axes and a groove across the local 2F axes. Distal from the solid capsid shell is an outer layer of globular spike-like densities. The spikes are ~ 40 \u00c5 in diameter, with a somewhat elliptical shape, yielding an outer particle diameter of ~ 440 \u00c5. The stoichiometry suggests that the spikes are dimers with contributions from adjacent trimer facets (Fig. 3a, color code and labels). Thin linker densities connect the spikes to the capsid shells and are visible in 3D reconstructions of negative-stained particles (Fig. S1) or when the isosurface is lowered significantly in the cryoEM maps. The lack of well-defined linker density may be the result of the narrowness of the linker, minor heterogeneity in maturation cleavage, or wobbling of the spike head, which would obscure the connections during icosahedral symmetry averaging.",

In addition, the 3D reconstruction in Fig. 3b suggests that trypsin cleavage results in release of two-thirds of the spikes in the mature particles. However, we note that the bands of VP27 and VP25 on SDS-PAGE gels display intensities similar to that of VP34,10 suggesting that trypsin cleavage might lead rather to conformational flexibility and that the products of proteolysis, or a significant percentage of them, could remain noncovalently attached to the capsid shell. Limitations in material have precluded careful quantitative analysis to resolve this question. However, we note that the trypsin-treated particles in Fig. 2b have noticably less surface density than the particles in Fig. 2a. If the cleaved proteins remain noncovalently associated with the capsid shell, then one would still expect to see surface density in the images of individual particles, even if the polypeptides do not conform to icosahedral symmetry. Consequently, our working hypothesis is that trypsin cleavage leads to loss of 60 peripentonal spikes, which confers infectivity, possibly by exposing additional receptor binding sites on the capsid surface.",

The similarity reinforces the supposition that VP34 forms the capsid shell and that VP27/VP25 complexes comprise the spikes. The one noticeable difference between the structures is that the astrovirus spikes extend to a radius greater than that of HEV-lp (Fig. 4a, arrow).

For instance, in vitro assembly of expressed HEV capsid protein requires deletion of the 52 C-terminal residues, which may be analogous to caspase cleavage of VP90 and removal of ~ 125 amino acids to generate VP70 (Fig. 1). As there is no cell culture system currently capable of propagating HEV, little is known about its infectivity. Nevertheless, it is reasonable to speculate that a cleavage cascade similar to HAstV may be required for both assembly and activation. Furthermore, by analogy with the HEV-lp model, we may be able to infer that the differences between the AB and CC dimers of immature astrovirus is relevant for assembly, in addition to activation. In the case of HEV-lp, there is a measureable difference in the hinge angles between the AB and CC dimers, which may explain the similar differences observed in HAstV. It was proposed for HEV that the flatter angle of the CC dimers is required to make T\n = 3 rather than T\n = 1 particles and only happens in the presence of RNA.14., 22. The need for RNA as a structural component may account for the inability, to date, to assemble stable astrovirus-like particles from expressed proteins. Both systems may provide insights for the other.",

The uncleaved HAstV-8 particles [(a) top panel] display 90 disconnected spikes compared to 30 on the cleaved HAstV-1 particles [(b) top panel]. Maps truncated at a radius of 180 \u00c5 (lower panels) display a very similar chiseled morphology and diameter of the capsid shells, which are most likely assembled from the conserved N-terminal domain of VP34. The surface spikes are attributed to dimers of the VP25/VP27 variable domain. A possible scheme for the attachment of the surface spikes to the capsid shell is indicated on the HAstV-8 map (a) by the paired colors of the globular spikes (top panel) and presumed attachment sites (bottom panel), with A, B, and C subunits labeled. Symmetry axes are indicated by symbols on the HAstV-1 map [(b) top panel)].
