The utilization of existing and free communication platforms (such as 16 WhatsApp, FaceTime, Zoom, WeChat) allow older adults to remain physically distant 17 but emotionally connected. Systematic reviews have revealed that Internet and 18 mobile-based apps, companion robots, video games (Wii and TV gaming systems), video calls, and general computer usage are effective tools to reduce social isolation 20 and loneliness for older adults in the short-term 2, 3 . ICT can alleviate social isolation 21 through the development of a sense of connection, maintenance of existing 22 relationships, gain social support, engagement in activities of interests, and 23 enhancement of self-confidence 4 . Companion robots, such as Paro, can be used for 24 isolated and agitated residents living in nursing homes or long-term care facilities when 25 they couldn't have any visitors and remain confined in their rooms during the 26 pandemic 5 . 27 Traditional health and social care services, depending on physical proximity and 28 in-person care, are challenged by the pandemic.

The \"digital divide\" still exists for disadvantaged older adults with low 46 education and income 7 .
