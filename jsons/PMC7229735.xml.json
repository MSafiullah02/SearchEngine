There are other alternatives to N95 masks including other classes of respirators, elastomeric half-masks, and full-face respirators as well as powered air-purifying respirators (PAPRs). These devices are at least as effective as the N95 masks, and may be a better option for those who cannot fit into the standard N95 masks. It should be noted that elastomeric half-masks and PARPs should be worn with caution during surgical procedures as not to endanger room sterility by the unfiltered exhalation. Elastomeric half-masks can be disinfected and reused. Each of the alternative respiratory equipment items can be considered at least as effective as the N95 mask, such as the N99, N100, P95, P99, P100, R95, R99, and R100 masks.10\n",
