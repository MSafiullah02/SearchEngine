            "text": "Traditional vaccines, though often effective in inducing antibody responses, frequently fail to generate robust cytotoxic-T-cell (CTL) responses, which are essential to prevent or treat many cancers or infectious diseases. Currently, induction of antigen specific cellular immunity is a point of emphasis in the vaccine field, as evidenced by recent efforts to generate \"universal vaccines\" for mutable infectious agents (e.g., influenza, HIV, and Coronaviruses). These target infected cells expressing functionally essential viral antigens, instead of, or in addition to, more traditional viral surface proteins that are targeted by antibodies but are highly mutable (Herolds et al., 2020) . Successful integration of adenovector vaccines onto coated, or into dissolvable, MNAs has been shown to induce efficacious and durable antigen-specific responses in preclinical studies (DeMuth et al., 2013; Vrdoljak et al., 2012; Bachy et al., 2013) . Despite these promising results, clinical translation of adenovector vaccines has been hampered by limited efficacy, thereby defining an unmet need to enhance the immune responses induced by adenovirus vaccines. Here, we generated a three-dimensional (3D) multicomponent skintargeted vaccine platform, combining an adenovirus-encoded antigen with an adjuvant to induce stronger cellular immune responses. Specifically, we developed dissolving MNAs to simultaneously co-deliver adenovectors encoding the transgene for the model antigen ovalbumin (OVA) together with Poly(I:C), a Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3)-triggering double-stranded RNA molecule, to the cutaneous microenvironment, with the primary goal of enhancing antigenspecific cellular immune responses. Dissolvable MNAs are designed to mechanically penetrate the superficial cutaneous layers, rapidly dissolve upon insertion into the skin, and deliver uniform quantities of biocargo to a defined 3D space within the skin (Korkmaz et al., 2015) .",

            "text": "they have yet to be comprehensively evaluated in the context of recombinant viral vectored vaccines due to significant mechanistic differences, including differences in the kinetics and amount of antigen expression. Among TLR family members, TLR3 signaling imparts unique responses, such as secretion of immunostimulatory IFN-\u03b2 and CXCL10, due to its distinct downstream pathways. While other TLRs signal through adaptor protein MyD88, TLR3 uses the TIR-domain containing adapter-inducing interferon-\u03b2 (TRIF) adapter protein, with subsequent activation of IRF3 and IRF7 (Boehme et al., 2004; Schijns et al., 2006) . Here, using in vivo mouse models, we demonstrate that MNA delivery of the TLR3 agonist Poly(I:C) with antigenencoding adenovectors results in proinflammatory changes in the targeted skin microenvironment that correlate with robust antigen-specific cellular and humoral adaptive immune responses. For these studies, mice were used at 8-10 weeks of age, and all experiments were conducted in accordance with Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee approved protocols and guidelines. Mechanistically, simultaneous co-delivery of Poly(I:C) with adenovector vaccines impacted the pro-inflammatory microenvironment at the immunization site (Figure 2d-g Dissolvable MNAs incorporating Ad.OVA\u00b1Poly(I:C) were fabricated using a spincasting method, applied to mouse skin for 10 min, and then removed. Images of MNAs (a) before and (b) after application were obtained using optical stereomicroscopy. Scale bars = 500 \u03bcm. In vivo multicomponent vaccine delivery performance of MNAs was evaluated by fluorescent live animal imaging following application of MNAs incorporating Alexa488-labeled Poly(I:C) and Alexa555-labeled Ad.OVA to the right ears of mice. Mice were imaged using the IVIS 200 system with filters corresponding to (c) Alexa488 and (d) Alexa555 to demonstrate simultaneous co-delivery of Ad.OVA and Poly (I:C). (e) MNA-treated mouse skin was excised and imaged by epi-fluorescent microscopy and brightfield microscopy to show intercutaneous delivery of multicomponent vaccines in vivo.

We previously demonstrated that the same MNAs can deliver cargos to antigen presenting cell rich skin microenvironments in both mice and humans (Bediz et al., 2014) . Next, PDMS production molds were used to fabricate dissolvable MNAs integrating Ad5.OVA (2x10 9 genome count per MNA) \u00b1 Poly(I:C) (100 \u00b5g per MNA) via a multi-step spincasting technique. Sequential loading of Poly(I:C) and Ad5.OVA was performed via centrifugation at 4 \u00b0C and 3500 rpm for 1 hr for each loading. After loading biocargos, the structural material of MNAs, prepared by dissolving carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC, cat# C5678, Sigma Aldrich, St Louis, MO) and trehalose (cat# T9531, Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO) powders in endotoxin-free water (HyClone Cell Culture Grade Water) at 15 % w/w and 10% w/w, respectively, resulting in 25% w/w final solute concentration, was loaded onto PDMS production molds (75 \u03bcL of CMC/Treh hydrogel per MNA) and centrifuged at 10 \u00b0C and at 3500 rpm for 6 hr. Furthermore, blank MNAs without any biocargo were prepared from the same material composition for control experiments. Fabricated MNAs were imaged with a bright field stereo microscope.",

To label Poly(I:C), its amine modification was performed as previously described (Hermanson et al., 1996) .

Twelve days after immunization, mice were assayed for OVA-specific T-cell lytic activity using well established techniques (Morelli et al., 2015) . Briefly, splenocytes from na\u00efve mice were pulsed with 2 \u03bcg/ml OVA derived SIINFEKL peptide epitope or left unpulsed for 1 h. The unpulsed splenocytes were labeled with low concentration CFSE (1 \u03bcM) for 15 min at 37 \u00b0C, while the antigen pulsed splenocytes were washed and stained with high concentration CFSE (10 \u03bcM). Equal populations of the pulsed and unpulsed target cells (2 \u00d7 10 7 splenocytes per mouse) were injected intravenously (IV) into immunized and na\u00efve mice. Twenty hours after the injection, the spleens were recovered from all the animals, and the killing of target cells was evaluated by comparison of the antigen pulsed and unpulsed populations by flow cytometry to quantify antigen specific killing of the high CFSE labeled SIINFEKL-pulsed targets. Specific lysis was calculated according to the following formula: {1 \u2212 [(ratio of CFSElow / CFSEhigh of na\u00efve mouse) / (ratio of CFSElow / CFSEhigh of vaccinated mouse)]} \u00d7 100 and expressed as % of maximum lysis.",

            "text": "MNAs incorporating adenovirus vaccines (Ad5.OVA) with or without Poly(I:C) were manufactured using a composition of two GRAS water-soluble biomaterials: carboxymethyl cellulose and trehalose. Optical-microscopy images of MNAs before and after in vivo application to skin demonstrated high-quality micron-scale needles after fabrication and effective dissolution upon skin insertion, respectively (Figure 1a and 1b). Importantly, the multicomponent MNAs effectively delivered adenovirus (Figure 1c) and Poly(I:C) (Figure 1d) to the skin microenvironment in vivo (Figure 1e), resulting in transgene (OVA) expression (Figure 1f). Interestingly, compared to MNA delivery of adenovector alone, inclusion of Poly(I:C) was associated with significantly (p <0.0001) increased expression of OVA mRNA that was sustained through 48h.Intercutaneous vaccination with MNAs generated robust antigen-specific cytotoxic and humoral immune responses. Remarkably, multicomponent MNA vaccine platforms incorporating both antigen-encoding adenovector and Poly(I:C) augmented OVA-specific lytic immunity by approximately two-fold compared to MNA-delivery of the same adenovector alone(Figure 2a), In addition to cell-mediated immunity, MNA adenovirus vaccine platforms, with or without the addition of Poly(I:C), elicited strong and robust antigen-specific antibody responses (IgG1 and IgG2c)(Figure 2b-c). Thus, adding Poly(I:C) to this MNA-delivered adenovirus vaccine significantly improved antigen-specific cellular immunity while maintaining strong antibody responses. Notably, multicomponent MNAs integrating both Poly(I:C) and adenovirus retained their immunogenicity after one-month of storage at 4 \u00b0C, as indicated by no statistically significant loss in cell-mediated or antibody responses(Figure 2a-c).",

            "text": "). In particular, statistical analyses showed that the addition of Poly(I:C) significantly increased IFNB1 (Figure 2d) and CXCL10 (Figure 2e) expression at 6 hr, with respect to blank (empty) MNAs or MNA-Ad alone, which suggests that Poly(I:C) plays a distinctive role during early skin immunomodulation. Furthermore, the inclusion of Poly(I:C) continued to significantly enhance the expression of CXCL10 (Figure 2e) at later time points (24 hr and 48 hr) compared to blank MNA and MNA-Ad alone groups, consistent with a sustained chemoattractant effect of Poly(I:C). Importantly, these pro-inflammatory effects of Poly(I:C) correlate with enhanced systemic CTL responses. Expression of the proinflammatory cytokines IL-1\u03b2 and IL-6, which can be induced by a broad range of pathogen associated molecular patterns (PAMPS) and danger associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), was elevated in MNA-immunized skin microenvironments at early time points (6 hr) regardless of vaccine components (Figure 2f, g), likely as a result of the mechanical stress of microneedle application. Interestingly, at later time points (48 hr and 72 hr), after resolution of the transient mechanical stress generated by microneedles, both Adenovirus and/or Poly (I:C) evoked significant increases in IL-1B expression in the skin microenvironment, and the combination of Ad.OVA and Poly(I:C) sustained elevated levels of IL-6 through 48h. Collectively, our results demonstrate improved immunogenicity of skin-targeted adenovector vaccines by simultaneous co-delivery of the TLR3 ligand Poly(I:C), and support further development of PAMP/DAMP ligand integration in MNA-delivered viral vector vaccines. Specifically, our results demonstrate that Poly(I:C) adjuvanted MNA adenovirus vaccines elicit significantly improved CTL responses compared to adenovirus alone, while generating antibody responses at least as good as adenovirus alone. MNA-delivered vaccines have the potential to offer advantages of ease of fabrication, application, and storage compared to other vaccine delivery platforms. Our results suggest that multicomponent MNA vaccine platforms, uniquely enabling delivery of both adjuvant and antigen-encoding viral vectors to the same skin microenvironment, result in improved immunogenicity including cellular immune responses, thereby contributing to efforts to develop universal vaccines and improve global immunization capabilities.DATA AVAILABILITYData related to this article are available upon request.",
