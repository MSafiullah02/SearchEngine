Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) gains access to host cells via angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, which is expressed in the type II surfactantsecreting alveolar cells of the lungs. 2 Severe COVID-19 is associated with a major immune inflammatory response with abundant neutrophils, lymphocytes, macrophages, and immune mediators. Which mediators are most important in driving the immune pathology remains to be elucidated. Deaths from COVID-19 are chiefly due to diffuse alveolar damage with pulmonary oedema, hyaline membrane formation, and interstitial mononuclear inflammatory infiltrate compatible with early-phase adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). 3 Prevention of ARDS and death in patients with COVID-19 is a pressing health emergency.",

            "text": "The potential role of anti-TNF therapy thus warrants consideration. Preclinical studies suggest that the response to severe respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and influenza in mice is ameliorated by anti-TNF therapy, which reduces weight loss, disease duration, and cell and fluid infiltrate. 11 This research suggests a potential rationale for use of anti-TNF therapy in viral pneumonia, especially given the known mechanism of action of TNF and the reversal of TNF-induced immunopathology by TNF blockade in multiple diseases. It is known TNF is produced in most types of inflammation, especially in the acute phase, and is important in the coordination and development of the inflammatory response. However, too much production of TNF for too long becomes immune suppressive. 12 Blockade of TNF alone is clinically effective in many circumstances and diseases, despite the presence of many other pro-inflammatory cytokines and mediators. There is evidence of a \"TNF dependent cytokine cascade\" in rheumatoid arthritis tissue and upon bacterial challenge in baboons. 13, 14 Thus, if TNF is blocked, there is a rapid (ie, <12 h) decrease of IL-6 and IL-1 concentrations in patients with active rheumatoid arthritis 15 and, importantly, a reduction of adhesion molecules and vascular endothelial growth factor, which is also known as vascular permeability factor, denoting its importance in capillary leak. [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] Furthermore, a reduction in leucocyte trafficking occurs in inflamed tissues of joints due to reduction in adhesion molecules and chemokines 20 with reduction in cell content and exudate. Finally, after anti-TNF infusion tissue TNF is reduced as it passes into the blood bound to the anti-TNF antibody. Blood concentrations of immunoreactive, but biologically inactive, TNF increase more than ten times after infusion. 15 For these reasons it is possible that a single infusion of anti-TNF antibody might reduce some of the processes that occur during COVID-19 lung inflammation, reducing TNF and other inflammatory mediators, cellularity, and exudate.",

We postulate that the earlier the better after hospital admission might be the answer because patients will already have initiated anti-viral immunity for several days. There is a balance to be struck between stage of intervention and ensuring patients are at sufficient risk of a poor outcome and can be appropriately monitored. We propose that initial assessment of anti-TNF therapy in clinical trials should be in patients with moderate disease admitted to hospital and who require oxygen support but not intensive care. If this treatment approach proved beneficial with a good safety profile, treatment in the community for people identified as being at high risk of progressing to hospital admission might be considered. The range of available formulations and administration routes of anti-TNF products could facilitate this treatment approach.",

The use of powerful anti-inflammatory drugs in acute viral diseases has to be approached with caution because of the risk of increasing viral replication or bacterial infections. For lung viral infections, the higher the infectious dose, the greater the tissue damage from viral replication and the ensuing immune response. In animal models that resemble lung viral infection in humans, the immune response to the virus is so great that even a moderate reduction in inflammation is beneficial-eg, mice with severe pneumonia from RSV or influenza benefit from anti-TNF treatment without compromising viral clearance 11 because more of the lung architecture is preserved.",

            "text": "However, concerns about safety are important when considering new therapy. Would anti-TNF therapy increase the risk of bacterial or fungal super-infections? After respiratory viral infection, superinfections with other organisms occur at the most severe end of the disease spectrum. Many research groups have elucidated the mechanisms responsible 21 and anecdotal evidence suggests that bacteria might have a role in in COVID- 19, 5, 22 although this remains to be confirmed. Bacteria gain a foothold faster in a lung that is damaged. Experimental studies suggest that if the duration of inflammation is limited, with its associated collateral lung damage, then bacterial superinfection is reduced. 23 There is concern that anti-TNF therapy might increase the risk of bacterial infection. 24 Yet two randomised studies in critically unwell patients with septic shock 25, 26 showed that monoclonal anti-TNF therapy had good safety data with no evidence of increased secondary bacterial infections in the anti-TNF treated group. In an observational trial in rheumatoid arthritis patients with serious infections, the risk of sepsis and death was reduced in patients on TNF inhibitors compared with those on synthetic disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDS). 27 46 (11%) of 399 patients on TNF inhibitors developed sepsis after serious infection, of whom 20 (43%) died, compared with 74 (17%) of 444 patients on DMARDS who developed sepsis, of whom 54 (74%) died. 27 Paradoxically, another class of TNF inhibitor, a TNF-R2 Ig-Fc fusion protein, etanercept, was associated with moderately increased mortality in a randomised trial of this treatment for sepsis, 28 possibly due to its faster offrate for TNF potentially resulting in some redistribution and bioavailability of pathogenic TNF rather than its clearance.",

Synairgen is conducting a clinical trial of inhaled IFN \u03b2 in COVID-19 patients, but this is unrelated to this Comment. STH has played no direct role in the Synairgen trial other than his role as a NED. STH has no direct interests in anti-TNF or any other therapeutics referred to in this Comment. GW receives directors fees that include options to shares as Founder and Director of Bicycle Therapeutics plc unrelated to the topic of this Comment and was a Founder of Cambridge Antibody Technology, which in the 1990s co-developed the anti-TNF antibody adalimumab, and pre-2003 advised Peptech and Domantis on their anti-TNF developments and patents. GW is a Trustee of the Kennedy Trust for Rheumatology Research, for which the financial assets were largely derived from patent royalties on anti-TNF antibodies. DR reports personal fees for consultancy on drug safety from GlaxoSmithKline unrelated to the topic of this Comment. MR and TH declare no competing interests.",
