The European Commission (EC) proposed to reform the green architecture of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) post 2020 in such a way as to increase the level of environmental and climate ambition (European Commission, 2017a , 2017b . As regards the greening, the EC considers the crop diversification is not sufficient to improve the environmental performance and long-term viability of European arable crops systems, and proposes to introduce a sustainable rotation of agricultural crops, in particular with legumes. Furthermore, Member States should define the new rules and standards of the agricultural policy taking into account specific characteristics of their territories, including soil and climatic condition, existing farming systems, land use, crop rotation, farming practices, and farm structures (European Commission, 2018) .",

Economic models can provide these types of evaluation using available agricultural information for the entire EU, such as the data provide by the Farm Accountancy Data Network (FADN). Specifically, the micro-economic approach of mathematical programming models allows the technical aspects of agricultural production to be taken into account (Godard et al., 2008) . Within the current agricultural economics mathematical programming toolkit, two main types of programming models can be distinguished: Normative Mathematical Programming (NMP) and Positive Mathematical Programming (PMP). This latter type calibrates mathematical programming models to observed behaviour during a reference period using the information provided by the dual variables of the calibration constraints (Howitt, 1995; Arfini and Paris, 1995; Paris and Howitt, 1998; de Frahan et al., 2016) . Many analyses of the impact of farm policy reforms have been conducted using mathematical programming models in J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f order to identify the possible solutions of crop-mix and to carry out sustainability analysis (Balezentis et al., 2020) , also in the context of introducing legumes into cropping systems (Preissel et al., 2017) .",

Moreover, the analysis is structured by geographical area and altimetric level in order to capture typical specificities of Italian farms according to their localization. The impacts are evaluated in terms of land use and of economic, environmental and social indicators, such as the gross income, the use of water, chemical inputs, and labour. The results are shown and discussed both nationally and by geographic area and altimetric levels. The analysis also evaluates the lost income resulting from the obligation of legume-supported crop rotation, compared with the average national values of decoupled payments. This allows to analyse the effectiveness of decoupled payments in stimulating the compliance of environmental rules and then virtuous behaviour by farmers.",

Following, additional simulations on legume-supported crop rotation applicable in the CAP post 2020 were carried out, as shown in the Table 2 . The main arable crops (durum wheat, maize, soft wheat, barley, processed tomato) are subjected to different ratios with leguminous crops (forage and grain) in an increasingly stringent and binding manner. The first simulation (c_3y) requires that the main crop must be at most equal to 75% of the arable land (as required by the current diversification rule) and the remaining part (25%) must be composed of legumes crops. The other simulations (c_2y, 3/5_rot and b_rot) require increasingly stringent percentages as regards the main crops (67%, 60%, 50%) and therefore greater surfaces of legumes crops on the remaining part. Therefore, compared to the diversification rules currently in force, the first simulation determine changes on the remaining part of the surface (25%), while the others influence also the surfaces devoted to main crops.

At the current level of technology, legume-supported crop rotations could sustain natural resources and improving environmental quality as the legumes crops demand less inputs than many crops and show a high level of resource use efficiency and support biodiversity (Zander et al., 2016) . In the EU, local production of protein crops could be of primary interest to help farmers depend less on purchased feed, provide agronomic benefits to cropping systems, and increase the EU's protein self-sufficiency (Carof et al., 2019) .

            "text": "and 2019). Bertoni et al. (2018) used a quantitative ex-post approach to evaluate the land use changes caused by greening in northern Italy. Hart et al. (2017) evaluated the impacts of greening observed for the 2015 and 2016 agricultural years at European level. All the studies show that that most farms are already compliant with the greening practices and the impacts are very limited. The impacts of greening were mainly assessed in terms of involved farms, use of chemical inputs, land use changes and income. J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o fOur results show some interesting aspects in terms of relationship between economic and environmental objectives. The legume-supported crop rotations reduce the general environmental pressure of agricultural activities and affect a large part of the arable land, against reduced economic impacts. In the majority of farms the lost income is lower than the decoupled payments and therefore, all things being equal and not considering moral hazard behaviour, most farms should be incentivized to comply with environmental rules. The economic impacts are reduced because the current prices of the main crops are low and also because coupled CAP payments are provided for legumes crops. Therefore, the coupled payments are fundamental to support farms' profitability.In general, the larger impacts in terms of used indicators are observed in the farms with more intensive agricultural systems and based on monoculture or few crops, which is north and south of Italy and in plain and hill areas. The introduction of the crop rotations in these farms determines larger modifications in the cropping systems and consequently changes the use of input and the economic results. The reduction in the use of nitrogen especially is observed in the plain areas and this determines a positive effect for the environment to prevent nitrate pollution of the groundwater.Furthermore, this reduction could be greater considering the lower nitrogen fertilization required by applying rotations with legumes. Negative social impacts could occur in the areas where the agricultural sector is an important source of income and employment, such as the north and south of Italy. As regards the use of water, the reduction occurs above all in northern Italy. In general, considering also the climate change and the reduced availability of water in the Mediterranean area, this result seems to be a positive aspect as the pressure on the water resource is reduced. However, in some areas, especially in northern Italy, where water availability is not scarce and the use of irrigation water is essential to maintain the balance of the ecosystems, the reduction in the water consumption could cause changes of these balances. Furthermore, a significant reduction in water use could have negative repercussions on the management of Water User Associations (WUA) as J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f could result in a reduction in revenue for WUA particularly if the latter apply tariffs based on water consumption.",
