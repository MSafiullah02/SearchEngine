Indeed the very word \u201cdis-ease\u201d implies a state lacking \u201cease\u201d or well-being. We feel it is important to consider disease holistically: that is to consider the animal\u2019s ability to resist stress and the environmental challenges it faces. Whereas the outcome of poor welfare is expressed as disease, the relative contributions of various stressors will vary with each individual. The other chapters consider genetics, nutrition and environment in terms of the welfare of poultry. However, given the same housing, air, feed and water, some birds may become diseased and some remain healthy. Intrinsic biological variation results in a range of nutrient reserves and immune status at hatching, plus differences in genetic make up, social status and behaviour that interact with each other and further factors to provide different outcomes for the individual. In the pragmatic world of farming, flock health status may be frequently chosen as the index of welfare, but it is important not to lose sight of the health and well-being of each individual, even in flocks numbering tens of thousands of birds.",

In terms of the impact on the welfare of the global population of poultry, common conditions such as enteritis, footpad lesions, cellulitis, distended crop and respiratory disease have the greatest significance because they are often considered as routine, and if they do not cause significant economic loss, may be accepted as established hazards about which little can be done. By virtue of the numbers of animals affected, these common irritant, non life threatening conditions become very significant.",

This is not usually a life threatening condition, but will compromise the bird, and be reflected in reduced growth. A shorter bird may find it harder to access resources in the shed. If the bird is significantly smaller, it may be culled on farm (welfare concerns over on farm slaughter) or be too small to be effectively stunned in the electrical stunning bath at the slaughter plant. This condition is a low level \u201csporadic\u201d condition of little economic impact, but may, for the individual bird, seriously reduce the quality of its life. If we assume that crop distension is intermittent, but can be found worldwide, then 0.1% of 40 billion meat chicken (estimate for world production) gives 40 million birds a year may have their broader \u201cwelfare\u201d compromised by this low level condition. For other common, but economically insignificant, conditions such as pododermatitis, the numbers of poultry affected worldwide can be astounding. In the absence of large-scale surveys of the incidence of foot pad dermatitis (pododermatitis) in chicken, taking assumed figures based on small surveys in Europe, of 25% in broilers and 5% in layers, the number of individual birds affected annually could be some 10 billion plus.",

The particular importance of zinc in poultry was reviewed by Kidd et al. (1996). Birds are susceptible to a number of diseases which result in immunosuppression, and these diseases are discussed under the headings Gumboro disease, Chicken Infectious Anaemia, Oncogenic viruses and fungal toxins. The use of intermittent lighting schedules that also reduce daily illumination may improve liveability and reduce mortality in laying hens (Lewis et al., 1996). Immune function was improved in a line of White Leghorn hens that was selected for longevity (Cheng et al., 2001).

Another common cause is right ventricular failure. Mortality in affected flocks is over 1% and may rise to 20%, although incidence averaged 4.7% in a 1996 international survey (Maxwell and Robertson, 1997). Most aspects of the disease are considered by Julian (1993). The condition may be reduced or prevented by slowing metabolism via genetic, dietary or husbandry measures (such as increased periods of darkness, Gordon, 1997). In their review of causal factors, Decuypere et al. (2000) suggest that a fundamental cause is the imbalance between oxygen supply and the oxygen required to sustain rapid growth rates and high food efficiencies. They also provide evidence for the close association of the quantity, form and quality of the diet and the incidence of ascites.",

Apart from ascites (above), flip-over or SDS (sudden death syndrome) is the main condition associated with cardiovascular disease in broilers. Mortality levels in affected flocks are typically 0.5\u20132% with males predominantly affected (Julian, 1996). The absence of clear symptoms on post-mortem, and its occurrence in apparently healthy, fast-growing birds indicates that it is likely to be a metabolic disease, in which an imbalance of electrolytes or metabolites causes ventricular fibrillation. Under research conditions, an imbalance of calcium and phosphorus in the diet can significantly increase SDS (Scheideler et al., 1995). Stress, induced by high stocking density (Imaeda, 2000), bright lights and disturbance by humans may also increase incidence.",

Such diets are commonly used to increase egg production, but lead to excess storage of fats in the liver. The livers of laying hens become putty coloured owing to contents of up to 70% lipid (mostly triglyceride) and they also haemorrhage. Excessive abdominal fat is seen, and the kidneys are often pale and swollen. Mortality is generally low, but morbidity high and egg production may fall. Scheele (1997) noted that the condition was the most important disease of laying hens in the Netherlands. It is more common in caged layers which cannot exercise to use up the excess energy. When formulating diets for birds it is important to realise that their carbohydrate and lipid metabolism differs from mammals. In particular, the liver rather than the adipose tissue is responsible for lipogenesis. Adding lipase to the diets of laying hens may increase the incidence of liver disease whilst improving the PUFA (polyunsaturated fatty acid) content of yolk fat (Lichovnikova et al., 2002).",

A reduced oxygen supply to body tissues is one way in which improved food conversion efficiency can be achieved. If this occurs in conjunction with increased demands on the metabolism for growth and production, then increased free radical production and damage to DNA is likely. This could in part explain the ever-reducing lifespan of farmed species. Many avian species, however, have a relatively high resistance to oxidative stress (Ogburn et al., 1998) and a stronger antioxidant-defence system than mammals of comparable size (Klandorf et al., 1999). This could help to account for the astonishing increase in productivity of fowl during the past half century. Whereas the ability of birds to cope with a relatively hostile biochemical environment may have enabled them to do this, concurrently it appears to have rapidly advanced the ageing process.",

The unfortunate choice of the term \u201cleg weakness\u201d to describe lameness in meat-strain birds led some to assume that bone strength was reduced, which is not usually the case. Reduced bone strength is however, virtually ubiquitous, to some degree, in modern strains of layers that are managed for high egg output. Osteoporosis is a reduced mineralisation of the main structural bones of the skeleton which weakens them, leading to torsion (particularly of the keel bone) and to fractures. The birds are unable to obtain sufficient calcium from the diet or by release from medullary bones (which act as calcium reservoirs) to form the egg shells and so they mobilise skeletal calcium. The skeleton becomes increasingly weak as lay progresses, and older birds are more likely to suffer \u201ccage layer fatigue\u201d in which, as well as widespread bone abnormality, paralysis occurs due to nerve damage from weakened bones in the vertebral column. Caged birds also have insufficient space to exercise, and in particular to perform weight-bearing exercise and therefore are prone to disuse osteoporosis.",

The widespread occurrence of this disease indicates that the laying hen cannot adapt its calcium metabolism sufficiently to cope with the stressful demands of modern production and husbandry. An inability to cope is a welfare issue (Broom, 1986). The main changes that place an unreasonable demand on the physiology of the layer are:Prolonged and continuous egg laying. Hens evolved to lay in clutches with periods in between that enabled their skeletal reserves to be replenished.Advancing the age of sexual maturity. By forcing birds into lay when young, skeletal growth is incomplete even before the demands of egg laying commence. Furthermore, oestrogen activity has a greater effect on skeletal integrity than diet, and thus should not be prematurely stimulated in the immature bird.Insufficient weight-bearing exercise in caged birds (see Baxter, 1994).\n",

            "text": "Lameness is widely assessed using the gait scoring system, devised by Kestin et al. (1992), that assigns a gait score (GS) from 0 (normal, fully mobile and agile) to 5 (incapable of walking) based on visual appraisal by humans of the gait of a broiler that is encouraged to walk. With trained and standardised assessors, and with an appropriate sample of broilers (Kestin and Knowles, 2003), the method can estimate the distribution of gait scores in a commercial flock \u2013 or in other words, the magnitude and severity of lameness. The prevalent opinion is that broilers with a gait score of 3, 4 or 5 have increasingly compromised welfare. On this basis, recent surveys have estimated the proportion of broilers affected (GS>2) to be 2.5% (Knowles et al., 2008), 14.8% (Berg and Sanotra, 2001, a pilot study in Sweden of 400 broilers in 8 flocks at 29\u201333 days of age), 30.1% (Sanotra et al., 2001, a survey in Denmark of 2,800 broilers in 28 flocks at 31\u201342 days of age). There are a number of possible explanations for such widely differing estimates of the prevalence of lameness in broilers. One is inter-observer reliability, and the inevitable inaccuracies associated with a subjective method of evaluation. This can be overcome to a large degree by training, validation and the use of standards (such as a large reference database on videotape of the locomotion of broilers of each different gait score). Several other factors that are known to affect lameness are discussed below. Many of these varied between surveys and could account for some of the differences.",

A simple new method based on latency to lie in very shallow water is being developed and has been used in trials on commercial farms (Weeks, 2001, Weeks et al., 2002, Berg and Sanotra, 2003). Results have initially been compared against gait scoring with highly significant correlations. Once fully refined, the test is expected to be used for auditing, breeder selection and accurate field assessments of lameness. From a welfare perspective, the new test has the advantages of being a bird-based assessment requiring no human interpretation, and of the duration of the test decreasing to a few seconds with increasing lameness.",

Principal among these is increased susceptibility to lameness, although this varies slightly between genotypes (Kestin et al., 1992, 1999). A survey of leg problems in commercial broiler flocks in Sweden found the proportion of lame broilers (gait scores >2) was significantly greater (P<0.001) in Cobb genotypes, at 26.1%, than Ross 208 genotypes, at 14.1% (Sanotra et al., 2003). Several studies have shown that high levels of lameness are significantly associated with high growth rate and precociously heavy body weight, and Kestin et al. (2001) demonstrated this across a particularly wide variety of genotypes (Fig. 8.1). Previous studies (Kestin, 1992, Sorensen et al., 2000) have also shown that both the proportion of broilers affected by lameness, and the severity of lameness, increases with age. As would be expected in growing broilers, weight also generally increases with age, but this only applies to birds that can still walk and have adequate access to feed and water (up to GS 3). Those birds classified as GS 4 or 5 are unable to gain adequate access to feed and water, and in consequence their growth is impaired (Fig. 8.2). Clearly the health and welfare of such very lame broilers is so poor that they should be culled, and good producers will have a thorough culling programme. Leg culls in Northern Ireland were 0.5% of males and 0.4% of females, McNamee et al. (1998).\n\n\n",

            "text": "Research has shown that several variables can affect the expression of lameness in a flock of broilers. It is important to note that many of these affect liveweight and that often any benefits are due primarily to this weight reduction. Thus, to determine whether changes have a value per se, correction must be made for alterations in body weight. Lameness increases in prevalence and severity with increasing stocking density (Hall, 2001; S\u00f8rensen et al., 2000). The free floor space available for exercise decreases with increasing stocking density and could account for some of the increase in lameness. Several studies support the hypothesis that reduced exercise increases leg problems (Reiter and Bessei, 1998; Bizeray et al., 2000). The effects of light on broiler welfare are complex, however certain lighting patterns may reduce the incidence of leg disorders (reviewed by Gordon, 1994; Sorensen et al., 1999). Improvements in leg health may be due both to the stimulation of bouts of activity and also to periods of high quality rest and improved metabolic health (Gordon, 1994). This explanation could equally apply to the reported benefits of providing feed in meals rather than ad libitum (Su et al., 1999). To reduce leg problems effectively, feed restriction generally has to be severe enough to cause long-term growth reduction whether applied for short periods at a young age in broilers (e.g. Su et al., 1999) or throughout life in broiler parent stocks. It then becomes difficult to balance the resultant welfare benefits with the welfare problems. In the case of broilers other methods should preferably be employed to improve leg health. Because use of perches by broiler is so low, particularly after about 4 weeks of age, they have no effect on leg health. Most trials using environmental enrichment to stimulate activity also have negligible effect on health although they may alter behaviour.",

For example, abnormal growth plate development, or wear and tear in distorted joints, may predispose to colonisation of the synovial fluid and membranes by opportunist infectious agents such as staphylococci or reoviruses. Following acute infection, chronic conditions such as tenosynovitis and arthritis may develop. The inflammation and pain associated with infectious causes of lameness generally results in a substantially reduced ability and inclination to walk, that is to a gait score classification of 4 or 5 (Jordan, 1996, Kestin et al., 1994). From post mortem examination, it estimated that staphylococcal tenosynovitis accounts for 3\u20134% of cases of lameness (Pattison, 1992, Reece, 1992) and the incidence in broiler breeders is higher, since the disease has longer to develop.",

More recently, Weeks et al. (2000) observed that, on average, lame broilers (GS 3) lay down for 86% of their time, which was significantly longer than the 76% of sound birds (GS 0). Walking declined with age but occupied an average of 3.3% of the time of broilers approaching slaughter weight. Lameness significantly reduced this to a minimal 1.5% in the worst affected birds. For lame birds, the time spent on their feet idling or preening was significantly less than sound birds, and this could indicate a reduced quality of life. More importantly, there was evidence of frustration of normal feeding behaviour. When the feeders were set lower than usual, lame broilers lay down to eat for almost half their feeding time, whereas sound birds predominantly chose the usual standing posture for eating. Moreover, detailed observations using video records revealed that lameness altered the feeding strategy of broilers. The sound birds visited the feeder an average of more than 50 times in 24 h, but the number of visits to the feeder was reduced with increasing lameness to an average of around 30 visits in the lamest broilers. However, meal duration was adjusted to give no overall differences in time spent feeding per day (Fig. 8.3).\n\n",

In an experimental study of dustbathing behaviour, Vestergaard and Sanotra (1999), found that lame broilers with tibial dischrondroplasia (TD) dustbathed on significantly fewer days and showed reduced dustbathing behaviour. These birds also had longer periods of tonic immobility when tested at six weeks of age than birds without TD, and the authors suggested that an inability to dustbathe might increase the sense of fear. Their study also indicated that it was the pain associated with lameness that reduced dustbathing behaviour. Very severe lameness may result in reduced ability to access food and, more critically, water drinkers \u2013 particularly if nipple and cup drinkers are set at a height which requires that birds have to \u201cstretch\u201d to reach them. Birds with this degree of lameness should always be humanely culled. The consequences of not doing so were revealed in a study carried out in the UK by Butterworth et al. (2002) who associated chronic dehydration with severe lameness (see Fig. 8.4).\n\n",

In reality there are many other tasks to fill the working day and so sick birds get overlooked, especially in systems such as multi-tier cages for layers where it is physically very difficult to actually see into every cage. The potential for poor welfare is built into such systems where the number of human carers is dictated by economic rather than animal welfare considerations.

The number of freshly broken bones found in live birds prior to slaughter and the number of old healed breaks found at slaughter are unacceptably high (Knowles and Wilkins, 1998). The bones of most layers, especially those housed in cages, are weakened by osteoporosis which increases their susceptibility to breaks. Birds from more extensive laying systems often have stronger bones (Gregory et al., 1991; Fleming et al., 1994) and suffer fewer breaks during depopulation, but they can have a greater prevalence of old healed breaks. For example, Gregory and Wilkins (1996) reported a rate of healed bone fractures of 23% at 72 weeks in one study. The old breaks may occur as a result of collisions due to poor design within these housing systems. The number of breaks occurring just prior to slaughter can be reduced by increasing bone strength, and by handling birds with more care. For example, Gregory et al. (1993) found the incidence of broken bones in end-of-lay hens removed by two legs from cages was less than half that in birds removed by one leg. The numbers of breaks occurring during lay can be reduced by better design of housing systems and the physical environment within them.",

Because of the relatively poor circulation of the foot, the condition tends to persist for weeks. If treated individually by lancing and cleaning the foot or antibiotic therapy, bumble foot can be cured. This is seldom done on modern large production units to the detriment of bird welfare. Affected birds find it difficult to walk and they may approach feed and water less and thus have reduced production. Prevention lies in separating the bird from its faeces (as in conventional wire battery cages) or, preferably, in housing on a clean soft substrate. The condition is increasing in prevalence as cages modified by perches and alternative laying systems become more common (Tauson and Abrahamsson, 1994).",

At concentrations above 60\u201370 ppm, ammonia causes irritation of mucous membranes and of the respiratory tissues resulting in keratoconjunctivitis, tracheitis and oedema in the upper airway, and damage to the cilia in the trachea. High levels of ammonia also seem to depress the birds\u2019 appetite (Jones and Roper, 1997).

Species of the protozoan parasites Eimeria and Tyzzeri, which cause coccidiosis are often very host specific, and site specific within each host. The disease is variable in its severity, but may result in frank enteric disease, due to damage to duodenum, caecum or rectum, with diarrhoea, which may result in increased mortality, depression and anaemia. Alternatively, the disease may not present any clinical signs, but show as poor growth. Because coccidia produce resistant oocysts, which can persist in the environment for long periods, coccidiosis is very difficult to eliminate from intensively farmed poultry, and control relies on vaccination, or use of scrolling generations of antiparasitic drugs which become ineffective as the parasite develops resistance. The welfare impact of coccidiosis on poultry is substantial because the potential for enteric disease or poor thrift is universal. The need for vaccination and use of coccidiostats in intensive systems ties animal health to the ability of the pharmaceutical industry to keep one step ahead (or at least keep pace) with the malleable resistance of the parasite.",

Many arthropod parasite lifecycles are stopped by the short production cycles seen in broiler chicken, or by repeated house disinfection and cleaning. However, in systems which take the birds to greater ages, or which cannot easily be cleaned (free range, wooden houses), then arthropod parasites can become a very significant cause of disability in the birds. Intensively farmed poultry are affected by Lice (especially caged layers), Red Mite (broiler breeders and free range units), Northern Fowl Mite (turkeys and broiler breeders) and Scaly Leg Mites (older birds) along with fleas, ticks and flies.

Whereas research may be driven to solve problems of food-borne pathogens for humans, such as Salmonella, feeding probiotics may improve the health and welfare of the birds. The intended mode of action of microrganisms used as probiotics is competitive exclusion of pathogenic and toxicogenic organisms in the intestines of fowl and they must therefore be robust enough to survive the digestive processes of the crop and gizzard. Widespread use of probiotics may be limited in the future because of safety concerns about the large quantities of industrially produced cultures that can also be distributed into the environment (Reuter, 2001).",

Second, it can mask the effects of relatively poor diets, environments and husbandry. Thus many countries, particularly in Europe are banning their use, so that producers will need to promote good bird health via the fundamentally more sound and sustainable approaches of a diet that promotes good digestion and a healthy balance of intestinal flora (Bedford, 2000), and management techniques that include improved biosecurity.",

Before this point and if it is not reached, sick birds suffer from lack of treatment. Beyond it; some healthy birds are treated unnecessarily, which has implications for increasing the antibiotic resistance of bacteria and for environmental pollution. There are therefore sound reasons, not least for the welfare of individual birds, for therapeutic agents to be used on individuals within a husbandry system that promotes good health through other measures.",

            "text": "The welfare impact of Coccidiosis can be very significant (see section on the disease) and, for the individual bird, effective prevention or adequate control can be seen as a valuable contribution to the wellbeing of the animal. Infection with Eimeria spp. results in a strong immune response in the fowl. When numbers of parasites in the environment are low, there is seldom a health and welfare problem for the birds. However modern, intensively stocked floor-rearing systems, especially of breeders, results in such a high challenge that Coccidiosis frequently ensues. Coccidiosis is controllable by three possible artificial mechanisms, vaccination, removal from the body using cocccidiocides, or reduction of the worst effects of Coccidiosis by use of pharmaceutical products called coccidiostats which inhibit the parasite. Vaccination is a comparatively recent method for coccidian control, with live attenuated precocious oocysts from a range of Eimeria lines being given orally. Coccidiocides are used in pigeons, and occasionally in small groups of poultry to attempt elimination of coccidia, but by far the most common method for control of Coccidiosis worldwide at present is the use of coccidiostats. A number of compounds have coccidiostatic properties including, inonophores, quinolone antibiotics, nitrobenzamides, carbanilide, and the sulphonamide antibiotics. Over time, the efficacy of many coccidiostats has reduced as coccidial resistance has developed. The cost of these agents, and the changes in sensitivity of the coccidian to the agents means that control of Coccidiosis relies on a combination of management (hygiene, site depopulation and cleaning), treatment with coccidiostats, selection for birds with reduced susceptibility to Coccidiosis and vaccination.",

Thus more use is being made of live vaccines to the oocyst (infective) stage of the parasite\u2019s life cycle in order to promote immunity before the bird is exposed to a high challenge of parasites. Such vaccines are usually accepted for organic production. While they can replace the use of coccidiostat drugs in feed, many authorities recommend an integrated approach where both are used (Chapman, 2000). It is hoped that this will combat the increasing resistance to coccidiostats of the parasites. Other approaches to improving the efficacy of coccidiostats, such as the use of betaine, which helps to preserve the integrity of the intestines and to reduce lesions, are being explored (Bedford, 2000). Traditional techniques for limiting the build-up of parasite numbers, such as pasture rotation and low stocking densities should not be overlooked.",

Clearly predators, rodents, snakes, pets and wild birds should be physically excluded from even small poultry units. Measures such as electric fencing, and roofs over feeders can reduce faecal contamination or direct contact from other species in outdoor units. It is usually impossible to completely exclude micro-organisms, but an all-in all-out policy for a whole site is often adopted, allowing a period for thorough cleansing and then disinfection of housing with minimal potential for re-infection.

The presence of a hygiene barrier was found to be the most important biosecurity measure for the production of campylobacter-free broilers in a Danish survey of 88 broiler flocks (Hald et al., 2000). Delivery vehicles may be excluded from the farm premises and other essential vehicles can be washed and disinfected on arrival and departure. Records should be kept of all visitors, and the usual requirement is a declaration that they have not been in other poultry units within a week nor be suffering from any infectious disease.
