The 3\u2032 end of the genome contains open reading frames (ORFs) encoding for canonical structural proteins including envelope (E), membrane (M), spike (S), and the nucleocapsid protein (N). Interspersed among the structural genes are novel ORFs that encode additional virus-specific proteins. The novel ORFs have been aptly renamed \u201caccessory genes.\u201d Coronavirus genomes differ greatly in number, location, and size of the accessory genes; as detailed in Fig. 10.1, viruses such as hCoV-NL63 can express as few as one, or in the case of SARS-CoV and the recently identified whale coronavirus (Mihindukulasuriya et al. 2008), as many as eight accessory proteins.\n",

Annotations by Thiel et al. were the least stringent and identified the eight currently accepted accessory genes; additionally, nomenclature consistent with other coronaviruses was given to them which will be used throughout this chapter. Numerous studies have reported on the expression of all eight SARS-CoV accessory genes. Few polymorphisms have been identified in the more than 100 sequenced SARS-CoV isolates, suggesting a selective pressure to maintain their expression. This chapter will review current data regarding the expression, structure, function, and molecular biology of the SARS-CoV accessory genes (Table 10.1).\n",

ORF3a is O-glycosylated (Oostra et al. 2006) and localizes predominantly to the Golgi and plasma membrane (Tan et al. 2004c; Yu et al. 2004; Ito et al. 2005; Yuan et al. 2005a; Lu et al. 2006; von Brunn et al. 2007). Plasma membrane trafficking and endocytosis is mediated by a Yxx\u03a6 motif and a diacidic motif in the cytoplasmic tail that are juxtaposed to one another within a 14 amino acid region (Tan et al. 2004c). This region of the cytoplasmic tail has also been shown to mediate G1 phase cell cycle arrest in HEK-293T cells transfected with ORF3a cDNA (Yuan et al. 2007). No evidence has been presented regarding control of cell cycle progression in SARS-CoV infected cells, so the functional significance of this observation is unknown.",

Potential interactions between ORF3a and the viral proteins S, E, M, and ORF7a have been demonstrated (Tan et al. 2004c; Zeng et al. 2004). Antibodies specific to ORF3a have shown the surprising ability to neutralize virus infection in multiple ways. Because some ORF3a is trafficked to the cell surface, antibodies recognizing the amino-terminal extracellular domain initiate complement-mediated lysis in the presence of functional complement proteins (Zhong et al. 2006). ORF3a N-terminus-specific antibodies are also capable of neutralizing infectious virus in microneutralization assays (Akerstrom et al. 2006). Although the precise mechanism of virus neutralization is unknown, these studies suggest that ORF3a may be a potential vaccine target.",

The authors propose a role for ORF3a in virus release; however, an ORF3a deletion virus is not defective in virus entry, replication, assembly, or budding (Yount et al. 2005). Additional evidence for ORF3a involvement in the virus lifecycle stems from the observation that ORF3a directly binds the 5\u2032 untranslated region (UTR) of the viral genome, mediated by residues 125\u2013200 of the cytoplasmic tail (Sharma et al. 2007). ORF3a is not required for virus replication in vitro or in a small animal model, as a recombinant SARS-CoV strain deleted of ORF3a replicates to wild-type levels in numerous cell lines and in BALB/c mice (Yount et al. 2005). Like many other SARS-CoV viral proteins, transient expression of ORF3a has been shown to induce apoptosis in Vero cells (Law et al. 2005). Expression of ORF3a in 293T cells can also augment NF-\u03baB activity (Kanzawa et al. 2006; Narayanan et al. 2007) and expression in A549 cells upregulates the expression and secretion of fibrinogen (Tan et al. 2005).",

The ORF3b protein is 154 amino acids in length and the translation initiation AUG codon lies 418 nucleotides downstream of the ORF3a AUG. No transcriptional regulatory sequence exists upstream of the ORF3b sequence and there are 11 AUG sequences between the ORF3a and ORF3b initiation codons which likely precludes leaky scanning as the mechanism of ORF3b translation. Although the ORF3b coding sequence lies in a translationally unfavorable context, the protein has been observed in virus-infected Vero cells (Chan et al. 2005) and antibodies recognizing ORF3b have also been found in patient convalescent sera (Guo et al. 2004; Chow et al. 2006).",

ORF3b has been shown to be an interferon antagonist (Kopecky-Bromberg et al. 2007). SARS-CoV has the ability to prevent interferon-\u03b2 (IFN-\u03b2) production in infected cells (Spiegel et al. 2005) and ORF3b may be one of several viral proteins whose function is to prevent IFN-\u03b2 induction.

No signal peptide is predicted within ORF6 and the N-terminal 40 amino acids are predominantly hydrophobic, with the exception of six charged residues spaced approximately seven amino acids apart, suggesting an amphipathic alpha-helical structure (Netland et al. 2007). The C-terminal 23 amino acids are largely composed of hydrophilic, charged residues. The hydrophobic N-terminus of ORF6 mediates membrane association (Pewe et al. 2005); however, the evenly spaced charged residues suggest that the hydrophobic region may not form a genuine transmembrane domain.

In-vitro expression of ORF7a results in apoptosis through a caspase-dependent pathway, inhibition of cellular protein synthesis, blockage of cell cycle progression at G0/G1 phase, activation of NF-\u03baB, increased IL-8 promoter activity, and activation of p38 MAP kinase (Tan et al. 2004a, 2007; Kanzawa et al. 2006; Kopecky-Bromberg et al. 2006; Yuan et al. 2006b; Schaecher et al. 2007b). These varied results all suggest a role for ORF7a in altering the host cellular environment. A recombinant SARS-CoV lacking gene 7 induces early-stage apoptosis and cell death similar to wild-type virus, but latter stages of the apoptotic cascade are altered as oligonucleosomal DNA fragmentation is significantly reduced compared to cells infected with wild-type virus (Schaecher et al. 2007b); however, gene 7 deletion viruses have no discernable defect in virus replication, pathogenesis, or lethality in wild-type or immunodeficient Syrian golden hamsters (Schaecher et al. 2007b; Schaecher et al. 2008b) or in Balb/c mice (Yount et al. 2005).",

This could tilt the balance of pro- and antiapoptotic regulators at the mitochondria resulting in activation of a cell death cascade.

The start codon for ORF7b overlaps but is out of frame with the stop codon for ORF7a and translation occurs via ribosome leaky scanning (Schaecher et al. 2007a). ORF7b localizes to the Golgi region of cDNA transfected and SARS-CoV infected cells (Pekosz et al. 2006; Schaecher et al. 2007a,b). The ORF7b protein is a highly hydrophobic protein of 44 amino acids and a molecular weight of 5.5 kDa. ORF7b has no predicted signal sequence and is an integral membrane protein containing a 22 amino acid transmembrane domain and a cytoplasmic C-terminus (Schaecher et al. 2007b), suggesting it is a type-III integral membrane protein. The Golgi localization motif is present within the ORF7b TMD and can confer Golgi localization to a protein that is normally found on the plasma membrane (Schaecher et al. 2008a).",

The ORF8a/8ab translation initiation codon lies proximal to the strong sgRNA8 TRS, and translation of full length ORF8ab results in a 122 amino acid protein with an N-terminus identical to that of ORF8a, and C-terminus identical to that of ORF8b. Translation of ORF8a and ORF8b, however, results in products of 39 and 84 residues, respectively. It has been suggested that the ORF8ab protein is a functional protein that was lost upon transmission to humans, and the resultant ORF8a and/or ORF8b proteins are likely nonfunctional (Snijder et al. 2003; Oostra et al. 2007).",

            "text": "The large genetic diversity among coronaviruses raises questions regarding the origins of the accessory genes. Have they been acquired through horizontal transfer from host cellular genetic material or heterologous viruses? Have they been acquired through gene duplication and subsequent mutation within the virus\u2019s own genome? Evidence has been presented pointing to both possibilities. For example, the group 2 coronavirus hemagglutinin esterase (HE) genes have approximately 30% amino acid identity with the influenza C virus (ICV) HE-1 subunit of the HEF gene; it has been suggested that an early group 2 coronavirus captured HE from ICV during a mixed infection (Luytjes et al. 1988). For the latter theory, several of the SARS-CoV accessory genes may have originated from internal duplication, fusion, or shifting events (Inberg and Linial 2004). ORF3a may have arisen through gene duplication and mutation of the M ORF (Inberg and Linial 2004; Masters 2006; Oostra et al. 2006). Furthermore, ORF7b and ORF8a have some amino acid sequence similarity to ORF3a, suggesting that the larger ORF3a may have given rise to ORF7b and ORF8 (Inberg and Linial 2004). Regardless of the origins of the SARS-CoV accessory genes, the severe disease caused by the virus highlights the need to study the functions of its eight accessory genes.",

It is striking that a virus lacking each of the accessory proteins, either individually or in combination, replicates efficiently in BALB/c mice. This finding may indicate that other animal models for the in-vivo analysis of accessory gene function are required. It is also possible that some or all of the accessory genes play a more important role during infection of humans, bats or other animal reservoirs of the virus. Identifying the functions of these accessory proteins may prove beneficial not only for further understanding of SARS-CoV pathogenesis, but also for better understanding and preparedness for future viral infectious diseases.",
