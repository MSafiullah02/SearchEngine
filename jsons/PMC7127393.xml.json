A novel coronavirus, called SARS-coronavirus or SARS-CoV, has been proved to be the cause of SARS [1], [2], [3]. Since then, progresses in finding inhibitors against SARA from different angles have been reported (see, e.g. [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9]). It is also important to timely and accurately diagnose SARS-CoV, which can help understand the mechanism of causing the disease and optimize the healing treatment. Unfortunately, it is quite slow to use the routine clinical procedures to diagnose SARS-CoV, as illustrated below.",

Although the existing PCR tests were made available during the outbreak, their sensitivity and specificity were unknown because there were no \u201cgold standard\u201d laboratory or clinical definitions for the diagnosis of SARS [10], [11], [12]. For instance, the SARS-CoV can be detected by inoculating suitable cell cultures (e.g. Vero cells) with patient specimens (such as respiratory secretions) and propagating the virus in vitro, but the problem is: although the positive cell culture results indicate the existence of SARS-CoV in the sample tested; the negative results do not exclude SARS. Again, although the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), immunofluorescence assay (IFA), and neutralization test (NT) have the strongpoint of convenience, reliability and repeatability, they are unsuitable for the acute illness [12]. Therefore, the existing diagnostic tests lack sufficient sensitivity for clinical usage in timely ruling out SARS.",

            "text": "From the emergence of SARS-CoV, many studies have been done on its biological medicine aspects, such as pathogeny characteristics, mechanisms of causing disease, clinic diagnosis and treatment, bacterin development and the spreading rules. At the level of molecule biology, studies have been conducted on its genome sequences\u2019 characteristic, structures and functions of the translated proteins, and the evolution relationships in sequences. SARS-CoV genomes are distinguished by the presence of a single stranded plus-sense RNA genome about 30 kb in length. Eleven open reading frames (ORF) of the viral genome are translated into 23 proteins, including four main structural proteins: Spike (S) protein, Membrane (M) protein, Envelope (E) protein, and Nucleocapsid (N) protein [13], [14], [15]. Research on other known coronaviruses has proved that among the structural proteins of coronaviruses, S protein plays a very important role in virus entry, virus\u2013receptor interactions and their relationship to tropism [16], [17]. The S proteins of coronaviruses are large type-I transmembrane glycoproteins that are responsible for receptor building and membrane fusion. On 26 November 2003, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) was identified as a functional receptor for the SARS-CoV, and S protein associate with cellular receptors to mediate infection of their target cells. Recently, in virtue of giant human antibody libraries, a human monoclonal antibody, which potently neutralizes SARS-CoV and inhibits syncytia formation between cells expressing the S protein and those expressing the SARS-CoV receptor ACE2, was identified [18]. Research on molecular evolution of the SARS-CoV reveals that the highest rate of mutation is seen in the part of the virus genome coding for the S protein. Research data suggests that through the change of S protein, the early SARS-CoV was under significant pressure to mutate in order to become an efficient human virus [19]. In addition, the research on S protein of SARS-CoV will do great favor to clinic diagnosis and bacterin development [20], [21], [22].",

The previous studies on virus gene sequences only concern about the structure or property of the virus gene sequence by itself, seldom relating the investigation to the other objects such as the receptor for the virus. Here we shall take into account the interaction of SARS-CoV and its receptor. It has been observed that that after a certain kind of mathematic transformation, there is an obvious symmetric characteristic shown in gene sequences between SARS-CoV S protein segment and human ACE2; however, no such a characteristic shown in gene sequences between non-SARS-CoV S protein segment and human ACE2. The characteristic can be regarded as a fingerprint map and be applied to SARS virus detection, thus providing a simple and intuitive lab detection method to complement the traditional clinical and epidemiological methods.",

The advantages of graphical approach are in providing an intuitive picture, helping investigators visualize a very complicated or abstract problem and catch its essence or signature (see, e.g. [30], [31], [32], [33], [34], [35], [36], [37], [38]). Here let us use graphical approach to study the interaction of SARS-CoV and its receptor ACE2, and see if there is any special feature in the embodiment of their sequences. The mathematic transformation method presented in this paper is based on the graphic approach developed by the previous investigators [28], [29], [39], [40]. Using the graphic approach, or Z-curve method [41], we can obtain the transformed graph of the sequences and find the visualization characteristic between SARS-CoV and its receptor ACE2.

            "text": "The Z-curve is a novel method for mapping the DNA or RNA sequence into a folding curve in a three-dimensional space. Originally, the DNA (or RNA) sequences are expressed in terms of a series of four letters A, C, G, and T(U) that may be called the letter sequence representation (LSR) of the DNA (or RNA) sequences. Z-curve representation is one-to-one correspondence; it is a geometrical approach to express the LSR of DNA (or RNA) sequences. Such a geometric form of DNA (or RNA) sequence displays the new characters of sequence like symmetry, periodicity and local motif, thus providing a brand-new method for decryption of DNA or RNA sequence. The method is presented briefly as follows. Consider one strand DNA or RNA sequence with N bases. Suppose that the cumulative numbers of bases A, C, G, and T(U) occurring in this subsequence from the 1st base to the nth base in the sequence are denoted by A\nn, C\nn, G\nn, and T\nn, respectively. The Z-curve is composed of a series of nodes P\n0, P\n1, P\n2, \u2026, \nP\nN whose coordinates x\nn, y\nn and z\nn (n\n = 0, 1, 2, \u2026, \nN) are uniquely determined by the so-called Z-transform of DNA (RNA) sequence:(1)xn=2(An+Gn)\u2212n,  yn=2(An+Cn)\u2212n,  zn=2(An+Tn)\u2212n (xn,yn,zn\u2208[\u2212n,n], n=1,2,3,\u2026,N)Let us define A\n0\n = \nC\n0\n = \nG\n0\n = \nT\n0\n = 0. The Z curve is defined as the connection of the nodes P\n0, P\n1, P\n2, \u2026, \nP\nN one by one sequentially with straight lines. Define x\n0\n = \ny\n0\n = \nz\n0\n = 0 so that the Z-curve always starts from the origin of the three-dimensional coordinate system.",

Since the sequence is a one-dimensional, it is not easy to get the genetic information directly from the sequence itself. The transformation from gene sequence to the visualized graph with a unique feature is an effective way to observe and study the characteristics of gene sequences. Taking the interaction of SARS-CoV and its receptor into consideration, we have obtained a unique characteristic of SARS-CoV using the graphic approach. A visualization interactive relationship has been revealed between SARS-CoV and its receptor human ACE2, which does not exist between the non-SARS-CoV and human ACE2. Such a unique feature can be deemed as the fingerprint map of SARS-CoV that can be used to diagnose suspected cases against SARS. The outcome diagnosed by the fingerprint method has been confirmed by a real SARS case in Guangdong province of China. It has not escaped our notice that the proposed fingerprint map method, along with the method based on cellular automata images reported earlier [42], can also be used to the in-depth research for revealing the molecular mechanism of the disease.",
