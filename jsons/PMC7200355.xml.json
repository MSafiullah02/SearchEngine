Several existing medications are being repurposed for potential prophylaxis or treatment of COVID-19, including chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine1\n,\n2 often in combination with azithromycin3 and antivirals4, 5, 6 . The use of these medications has been associated with QT prolongation, and occasional reports of torsade de pointes when used for their original indications7\n,\n8. Their combined use, in the setting of systemic inflammation9 and potential metabolic abnormalities, most specifically hypomagnesemia and hypokalemia10, seen in the context of this severe systemic illness likely magnifies this risk via multiplicative effects on IKr11 as well as other less well defined mechanisms12\n,\n13. Guidance from an AHA/ACC/HRS position statement14 has supported the use of ECG monitoring to identify QT prolongation in COVID-19 patients being treated with these drugs. We describe the process we instituted to facilitate such monitoring and the outcome of our screening.",

This SBAR tried to balance risk and the desire to limit frequent ECGs in patients with COVID-19 and was largely based on experience with QT prolonging antiarrhythmic drugs. It did utilize QT measurements from telemetry when possible, but 12 lead ECGs were used for those not on units with telemetry, a large proportion of the COVID-19 patients at our hospital. We then identified all ECGs from patients with a diagnosis of COVID-19, or originating from floors designated as COVID-19 units Our screening was designed to capture as many COVID-19 patients as possible and thus a small percentage (15.4%) of screened patients, often in intensive care units with other medical emergencies, were COVID-19 negative. These ECGs were placed at the beginning of the reading queue for the electrophysiologist or cardiologist over reading the ECGs on that day. The daily reader identified all ECGs with significant QT prolongation as outlined in the SBAR (QTc > 470 ms for QRS < 120 ms or QTc > 500 ms for QRS > 120 ms) (Figure 1), and notified the electrophysiology consult service, who then reviewed the charts of these patients and provided telephone, and if necessary, formal inpatient support to the primary team caring for the patients. This support consisted most often of recommendations to replete electrolytes to more stringent levels (Potassium >4 mmol/L; Magnesium >2 mg/dL) (standard laboratory normals: Potassium 3.3-5.1 mmol/L, Magnesium: 1.7-2.4 mg/dL), to discontinue potentially nonessential QT prolonging drugs as identified by the electrophysiology team, and to consider the risks and benefits of continuing COVID-19 targeted therapy, most commonly with hydroxychloroquine.",

Overall, 459 (84.6%) patients were confirmed to have a diagnosis of COVID-19. Individual patients had 1-14 ECGs, often over several days. Of these 524 patients, 103 (19.7%), all with a diagnosis of COVID-19, had ECGs with QT prolongation as defined by the SBAR (Figure 2\n) and were referred for electrophysiology review and recommendations. Patient sociodemographic and medical characteristics are outlined in Table I\n. Among the patients that were COVID-19 positive, those with QT prolongation were more likely to spend time in the intensive care unit (ICU) (58.3% vs 36.5%, p = .000), and were more likely to be intubated (31.1% vs 19.7%, p = .014) than those without this finding (Table 2\n). Univariate analysis showed that ICU stay and intubation were both associated with QT prolongation (OR 2.4, 95% CI 1.5 \u2013 3.8, p = .000 and OR 1.8, 95% CI 1.1 \u2013 3.0, p = .015). After controlling for ICU stay, intubation, tocilizumab and hydroxychloroquine use, multivariate analysis showed that ICU stay was still strongly associated with QT prolongation (OR. 2.1, 95% CI 1.2 \u2013 3.7, p = .012) (Supplementary Table 1).",

During this period treatment algorithms were evolving and not all patients were treated with a single protocol. Our results are based on ECG measurements of the QTc, which given the desire to limit the use of personal protective equipment and caregiver and equipment exposure to patients with COVID-19 as well as greater comfort with remote monitoring for this complication17 , may be less widely used at this time. In addition, not all patients were continuously monitored, and therefore some arrhythmias or transient QT prolongation may not have been identified. However, the lack of significant clinical arrhythmic events suggests that our monitoring protocol, as well as other possible interventions, were fairly effective.",
