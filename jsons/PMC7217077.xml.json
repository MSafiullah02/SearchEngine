They are also likely avoiding care due to the new Public Charge rule, which negatively weighs the use of public assistance, such as nutrition assistance, non-emergency Medicaid, and housing benefits, against any applicant for permanent residence and their dependents.16 Though the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services announced suspension of the public charge rule related to COVID-19 care, widespread fear amongst immigrant communities will likely lead to fewer seeking care. Spacing time between dialysis sessions increases risk for fatal arrythmias, hypoxia from volume overload, uremia, and complications when they finally receive dialysis. Whether this will result in even higher relative risk of death for these patients compared to the general kidney failure population remains to be seen.",

Mechanisms must be in place to closely monitor health outcomes, and document improvements in savings, patient reported outcomes, or unintended consequences after transition.
