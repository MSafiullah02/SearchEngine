Therefore, it is recommended that beef cattle confined in houses or open feedlots should be provided with structures and facilities to reduce the effects of factors contributing to thermal stress such as excess air movement, precipitation, relative humidity and solar load.

However, clinical signs of irondeficiency anaemia, including suppression of normal behaviour, may already occur prior to an actual decrease of blood haemoglobin levels. In white veal calves oral supplementation with iron may improve milk intake and digestion in animals exhibiting normal haemoglobin levels.

Addition of an environmentally-enriched post-feeding area to an automatic milk-feeding system can significantly reduce cross-sucking in group-housed calves reared for veal.

The two main sources of calves for beef production are: (i) beef suckler (or cow/calf) herds where the primary function of the adult cows is to produce one beef calf per annum, and (ii) dairy farms where the production of calves destined for beef is secondary to the main enterprise of milk production and the production of replacement heifers. At the time of the SCAHAW Opinion (2001), there were approximately 28 million dairy cows and 13 million suckler beef cows in the EU. In subsequent years, the numbers have decreased to 23.1 million dairy cows (Eurostat, online) and 12.4 million suckler cows (Hocquette and Chatelliert, 2011) , respectively. It is interesting to note that, although they have both decreased, the ratio of dairy:suckler cows has remained relatively constant at about 2:1. In 2010, the total population of calves for slaughter was approximately 5.38 million (Table 1) , and this Scientific Opinion refers mostly to this population. Beef fattening systems may be divided into two main categories: intensive systems, where the calves are reared indoors, and grass-based systems, usually involving winter accommodation. The diversity of beef fattening systems in the EU is influenced by the type of diets (largely related to the climatic environments) and by the different cattle breeds. These breeds may be dairy (primary output milk), dual purpose (producing milk and beef) or beef (primary output beef). The EU dairy herd is dominated by the Friesian/Holstein breed. In contrast, the EU beef herd is very diverse. A wide range of breeds, varying greatly in phenotype from the relatively small, early maturing Hereford to the large, late maturing Charolais, have been selected to meet the different climatic and nutritional circumstances of the pastoral regions of Europe. When there is greater uniformity of environment and nutrition, as in intensive fattening systems, there is less need for this genetic diversity. However, breeding herds of suckler cows are likely to be kept out of doors for much or all of the year and are expected to subsist on pasture and forage with minimal supplements of purchased concentrates. The optimal strategy for a suckler herd is based on divergent selection for relatively small, hardy cows with low maintenance costs (e.g. Hereford x Aberdeen Angus) and large, fast growing sires with excellent beef conformation (e.g. Charolais; Webster, 1989) . The husbandry of suckler cows at pasture generally results in good welfare but there can be problems (e.g. undernutrition, mineral deficiencies, and climatic stress).

Dairy cows, predominantly of the Holstein/Friesian type, may be inseminated with semen from dairytype bulls (e.g. Holstein/Friesian), in order to provide replacement heifers for the dairy herd, or with semen from beef-type bulls (e.g. Charolais, Limousin, Aberdeen, Angus) to provide crossbred male and female calves with suitable conformation for prime beef production. Male calves from dairy cows bred with dairy bulls (e.g. Holstein x Holstein) are inferior in conformation according to such measures as the muscle:bone ratio and killing-out percentage, and they are unsuited to rearing systems based primarily on pasture and forage. Depending on their breeding, conformation (and market value) at birth, most male calves from dairy herds will be reared for beef in intensive (housed) systems. Calves of extreme dairy type, with poor conformation may be reared for veal. Many calves destined for beef are separated from their mothers at 1 to 2 days of age and artificially reared on milk or milk replacer plus solid food for a 6 to 9 week period. They are then weaned off milk or milk replacer and as functional ruminants are thereafter dependent on a diet of solid food (i.e. forages, such as hay, straw, grass, silage) or forages plus concentrates.

Therefore, this review makes reference to key papers published before, as well as after, 2001. Cattle are considered to be in a state of thermal comfort when the climatic conditions are such that they can, without substantial physiological effort, maintain a balance between heat production in metabolism and heat loss to the environment by conduction, convection, radiation and evaporation of moisture from the skin and respiratory tract. In the thermoneutral zone, the metabolic heat production of the animal is independent of ambient temperature. Maintenance of homeothermy within the thermoneutral zone involves behaviour (postural changes, huddling, seeking shade, etc.) accompanied by physiological regulation, at only a small cost, of sensible heat loss to the skin through regulation of peripheral blood flow, and evaporative water loss, largely from the skin. The lower critical temperature defines the point below which homeothermy cannot be maintained through regulation of heat loss and the animal has to elevate heat production (Webster 1974; Senft and Rittenhouse, 1985) . The thermal demand of cold environments is determined by ambient air temperature and air movement, which determine convective heat loss, radiant heat exchanges, both ultraviolet and infrared, and the thermal conductivity of lying surfaces (Webster 1970a (Webster , 1974 .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1272, "end": 1286, "text": "(Webster 1974;", "ref_id": "BIBREF354"}, {"start": 1287, "end": 1315, "text": "Senft and Rittenhouse, 1985)", "ref_id": "BIBREF263"}, {"start": 1557, "end": 1571, "text": "(Webster 1970a", "ref_id": "BIBREF351"}, {"start": 1572, "end": 1587, "text": "(Webster , 1974", "ref_id": "BIBREF354"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Thermoregulation, and cold and heat stress"}, {"text": "Work on the effects of high and low temperatures has focused mainly on the use of measures of body temperature and production.

Conditions of high relative humidity increase heat load by reducing the efficiency of sweating and panting as a means of heat loss.

Table 3 summarises evidence from Webster (1970a) relating to changes in cold tolerance as measured by the lower critical temperature (LCT) resulting from these effects. Acclimatisation to cold winter conditions involving increased coat depth and changes in peripheral circulation associated with increased tolerance of low skin temperatures can, in extreme circumstances, reduce both the lower and upper limits of the thermoneutral zone by as much as 20 \u00b0C (Webster et al., 1970) . The results shown in Table 3 were obtained under experimental conditions and may not cover all real life situations, and they may not apply to all animal categories (for instance, well adapted suckler cows may respond differently). These experiments were carried out in Western Canada during a winter when the mean ambient temperature in January-February was -28 \u00b0C. Table 3 also shows the extent to which heat loss, as assessed from the LCT, is affected by solar radiation (60 \u00b0C more cold tolerance), infra red radiation to the night sky (7 \u00b0C less cold tolerance), wind and wetting of the coat. Studies of how aversive low temperatures are to cattle have not been reported. Precipitation (rain) reduces the insulation capacity of the coat (Young et al., 1989) and cools the insulating air layer within the coat by evaporation (Eckert et al., 2000) . Wind tunnel tests on reindeer fur have indicated the effect of wind and of various degrees of moisture, showing that moisture due to mist or light rain affected the insulating capacity marginally, whereas heavy rain dramatically decreased the insulating capacity of the fur through evaporation and direct reduction in insulation (Hillman et al., 1989; Cuyler and \u00d8ritsland, 2004; Jiang et al., 2005) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 94, "end": 112, "text": "Webster, 1970a, b;", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 113, "end": 125, "text": "Young, 1981;", "ref_id": "BIBREF374"}, {"start": 126, "end": 151, "text": "Clark and McArthur, 1994)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 187, "end": 202, "text": "Webster (1970a)", "ref_id": "BIBREF351"}, {"start": 611, "end": 633, "text": "(Webster et al., 1970)", "ref_id": "BIBREF353"}, {"start": 1378, "end": 1398, "text": "(Young et al., 1989)", "ref_id": "BIBREF375"}, {"start": 1465, "end": 1486, "text": "(Eckert et al., 2000)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1818, "end": 1840, "text": "(Hillman et al., 1989;", "ref_id": "BIBREF109"}, {"start": 1841, "end": 1868, "text": "Cuyler and \u00d8ritsland, 2004;", "ref_id": "BIBREF52"}, {"start": 1869, "end": 1888, "text": "Jiang et al., 2005)", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 154, "end": 161, "text": "Table 3", "ref_id": "TABREF5"}, {"start": 657, "end": 664, "text": "Table 3", "ref_id": "TABREF5"}, {"start": 1003, "end": 1010, "text": "Table 3", "ref_id": "TABREF5"}], "section": "Cold stress and adaptation to cold"}, {"text": "The ability of cattle to adapt to cold depends on how long the exposure to cold has lasted.

Moreover, the evaporation rate of sweat is greater in animals with thinner, sleeker hair coats than thick rough coats.

The optimal coat/skin type best suited to high temperature and high solar radiation load is sleek white hair over a black skin, (e.g. Fulani cattle) because the hair reflects a high proportion of solar radiation, and the black skin effectively radiates outwards much of what actually penetrates the hair coat (Cena and Monteith, 1975) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 157, "end": 172, "text": "(Webster, 1974)", "ref_id": "BIBREF354"}, {"start": 520, "end": 541, "text": "(Beatty et al., 2006)", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 752, "end": 767, "text": "(Webster, 1974)", "ref_id": "BIBREF354"}, {"start": 770, "end": 789, "text": "Olson et al.

Other sources of digestible fibre include conserved forages and fibrous crop residues such as beet pulp. Highly digestible grasses and forages (> 70 %) can provide sufficient ME for maintenance and high levels of production (e.g. > 1 kg weight gain/day in beef cattle). When the digestibility of fibre is low (< 40 %) adult cows and (especially) young beef cattle are unable to obtain enough ME for maintenance and they lose body condition. The capacity of a ruminant to consume fibrous feeds is constrained not only by the rate of fermentation but also by the bottleneck to rumen outflow provided by the reticuloomasal orifice. When digestibility is low, a ruminant may suffer simultaneously from metabolic hunger arising from inadequate ME supply, exacerbated by inappetance resulting from a rumen impacted with indigestible fibre.

Moreover, starch fermentation yields a higher ratio of the glucogenic volatile fatty acid propionate to ketogenic acetate, than cellulose fermentation. This is consistent with increased feed conversion efficiency and reduced methane production. However, excessively rapid fermentation predisposes rumen acidosis, accompanied by destruction of many of the normal rumen bacteria and protozoa, with potentially extreme consequences for welfare, including abdominal pain, metabolic acidosis and, in severe cases, death. The optimal diet for a highly productive ruminant is that which can meet the nutrient requirement for ME, while maintaining a stable pattern of fermentation within the rumen (pH > 6.0). In practice, many diets for beef cattle intensively reared or rapidly finished on feedlots carry the risk of promoting unstable rumen fermentation, leading to acute and recurring problems of acidosis with secondary complications, such as laminitis and rumen parakeratosis.

Ruminal acidosis occurs as a result of excessively rapid fermentation of starchy cereals, which lowers rumen pH and fosters the production of toxic factors. Acute ruminal acidosis, characterised by a ruminal pH of less than 5.0 or 5.2, typically occurs following the accidental consumption of a gross excess of cereals (e.g. when hungry cattle gain sudden access to large quantities of grain). This clearly represents a serious failure in management. Beef cattle fattened on high cereal diets are at risk from subacute, recurring ruminal acidosis (SARA). Rapid fermentation, causing rumen pH to fall below 5.5, causes selective destruction of microorganisms involved in normal fermentation, including Streptococcus bovis and Protozoa, and favours the development of lactobacilli (Nagaraja and Titgemeyer, 2007) . In cases of SARA (as distinct from acute acidosis arising from acute grain overload), buffering of absorbed lactic acid by plasma bicarbonate, for instance, is usually sufficient to prevent a clinically harmful fall in blood pH although changes in blood gases and pH, can be used for diagnostic purposes (Gianesella et al., 2010) . In SCAHAW (2001), this condition was erroneously described as metabolic acidosis, when, in fact, the primary disorder is of ruminal origin. Secondary disorders associated with SARA may be local (e.g. hyper-and parakeratosis of the rumen epithelium) or systemic (e.g. hepatic abscesses and laminitis in hoof horn).

In essence, maintenance of homeothermy involves the dissipation of heat produced in metabolism to the environment by two mechanisms: sensible means (convection, conduction, radiation) across a temperature gradient from the body core to the air and insensible means (i.e. evaporation of moisture from the skin and respiratory tract). The amount of metabolic heat produced by an animal increases with increasing ME intake. The ME requirement for maintenance of beef steers (ME m Heat production (H) at maintenance) is approximately 450kJ/kg 0.75 per 24h. For bulls the value is closer to 500 kJ/kg 0.75 per 24h. The ME intake of rapidly growing beef cattle consuming highly metabolisable feed can approach 2.5 ME m . The net efficiency of utilisation of ME for growth in beef cattle (k m ) ranges from approximately 0.4 to 0.6 in direct proportion to the metabolisability of the feed. For a feed with a k m of 0.6, 40 % of ME consumed above maintenance will be dissipated as heat. Thus, for a growing beef bull consuming 1250 kJME/kg 0.75 per 24 h, the estimated heat production will be 800 kJ/kg 0.75 per 24 h (500 + (0.4 x 750)), which is approximately 1.8 times that of a mature cow at maintenance (800/450; Alderman and Cottrill, 1993) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1358, "end": 1386, "text": "Alderman and Cottrill, 1993)", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Undesirable substances in feedstuffs"}, {"text": "It follows from these core facts of heat exchange that cattle with the highest metabolic rates (i.e. rapidly growing beef cattle with high ME intakes) are potentially most susceptible to heat stress and most resistant to cold stress.

(2008) showed that this was effective in the coldest periods and for younger animals.

This hypothesis was supported by findings that prevalences of abomasal ulcers in weaned bull calves and veal calves fed milk replacer only were 0 % and between 20-25 %, respectively. Moreover, this hypothesis would predict that prevalences of abomasal lesions in pink veal calves (i.e. weaned calves fattened on solid feeds only) would be relatively low. Recent findings, however, have provided seemingly inconsistent results. In one survey examining a total of 247 abomasa (distributed across nine different pink veal farms), less than 20 % contained one or more pyloric ulcers . In a more large-scale survey (as part of a comprehensive veal calf welfare monitoring study, which also involved observations in white veal calves; see Brscic et al., 2011) , looking at approximately 2,000 abomasa from a total of 50 pink veal farms in The Netherlands (on average 40 abomasa per farm), the overall prevalence of pyloric lesions was 56 % (against 74 % in white veal calves; see Brscic et al., 2011) . Although in this latter survey any kind of pyloric lesion was recorded (from erosion to perforating ulcer), the relatively high prevalence of pyloric lesions among a large sample of pink veal calves suggested that the aetiology of abomasal lesions in veal calves also involved other factors than those related to the interaction between milk replacer and solid feed. Factors involved in the pathogenesis of abomasal ulcers in pink veal calves may be similar to those assumed to be implicated in the development of abomasal ulcers of beef cattle (Marshall, 2007 (Marshall, , 2009 Van Immerseel et al., 2010) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1243, "end": 1263, "text": "Brscic et al., 2011)", "ref_id": "BIBREF51"}, {"start": 1484, "end": 1504, "text": "Brscic et al., 2011)", "ref_id": "BIBREF51"}, {"start": 2052, "end": 2067, "text": "(Marshall, 2007", "ref_id": "BIBREF163"}, {"start": 2068, "end": 2085, "text": "(Marshall, , 2009", "ref_id": "BIBREF164"}, {"start": 2086, "end": 2113, "text": "Van Immerseel et al., 2010)", "ref_id": "BIBREF331"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Solid feed: concentrates and roughage"}, {"text": "The composition of solid feed provided to veal calves, in terms of the concentrate to roughage ratio, was found to be critical in the occurrence of ruminal \"plaque\".

Adding roughage to the concentrates (30 % of total dry matter) virtually eliminated this problem (Su\u00e1rez et al., 2007) .

In this latter experiment, an intermediate amount of roughage was associated with more abnormal behaviour than a relatively low amount. This was explained by the assumption that calves provided with intermediate amounts of solid feed experienced a decrease early in the fattening period in the time spent chewing and ruminating (due to an increase in chewing and ruminating efficiency over time), which led to greater frustration and higher levels of abnormal oral behaviours in comparison with the situation in calves fed relatively low amounts of solid feed, which maintained a constant, albeit relatively low, chewing frequency throughout the entire fattening period (Webb et al., 2012) .

Roth et al. (2009c) compared calves reared with an automatic milk dispenser with animals that were reared with unrestricted or restricted contact with their own mother. During the milk feeding period, weight gain was greater in mother-fed calves, which could be explained by a higher milk intake. After weaning, the weight gain of all treatment groups was diminished, but this effect was stronger in mother-fed calves. Rearing with either restricted or unrestricted contact with the dam prevented the development of cross-sucking. However, the health of mother-fed calves, in particular with regard to diarrhoea, was poorer than that in artificially-reared animals. It was concluded that both permanent and restricted contact with the mother during rearing had great behavioural advantages, but that there was an unfavourable effect of rearing with the dam due to higher incidence of diarrhoea, probably because of the large amount of milk ingested by the calves (Roth et al., 2009c) . A similar comparison between calves given milk from an automatic feeder and calves allowed to suckle from the dam was made by Fr\u00f6berg and Lidfors (2009) . In contrast to calves kept in groups with an automatic milk feeder, suckled animals displayed no cross-sucking and tongue rolling. Calves suckled by the mother ate less solid feed than artificially reared animals (Fr\u00f6berg and Lidfors, 2009), which may be related to differences in milk intake.

Below 5.0 mmol l-1, veal calves exhibit a number of adaptations to iron deficiency, including elevated heart rate, elevated urinary noradrenaline and alterered reactivity of the HPA axis. There is a lack of data on the variability in groups of calves. Hence, when haemoblogin levels are found to be below 6.0 mmol l-1 in groups of young veal calves, it is field practice to give supplementary iron.

In humans, the provision of iron to individuals who are infected with pathogens may be associated with serious sideeffects. This may also be the case for farm animals, including veal calves. Recommendations 1. In order to avoid anaemia levels that are associated with poor welfare because normal activity is difficult or not possible and other functions are impaired, it is advisable that diets should be provided that result in blood haemoglobin concentrations of at least 6.0 mmol l-1 throughout the life of the calf. In order to avoid serious impairment of immune system function and hence poor welfare, no individual calf should have a blood haemoglobin concentration lower than 4.5 mmol l-1. In most cases this is achieved by adjusting the concentration of iron in the diet and having an adequate checking system so that the above condition is avoided. Other treatment may be needed for calves with clinical conditions", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF33": {"text": "Other clinical and biochemical parameters, in addition to blood haemoglobin levels, should be included as indicators of anaemia in order to safeguard the welfare of veal calves restricted in their dietary iron supply.

Feeding and housing haemoglobin in the EU population of white veal calves, throughout the fattening period, and on the incidence of diseases. Space and pen design (Section 9.3. of EFSA, 2006) Conclusions NC.5 Especially at the beginning of the fattening period, veal calves housed in large groups (> 15 calves) may be more at risk for respiratory disease than animals kept either individually or in small groups (< 6 calves). per animal for calves with a live weight up to 100 kg and a reduction from 1.50 m 2 to 1.00 m 2 per animal for calves with a live weight up to 150 kg, decreased the occurrence of synchronous resting and reduced the possibility to lie in a relaxed recumbent posture.NC.7 Addition of an environmentally-enriched post-feeding area to an automatic milk feeding system may reduce cross-sucking in group-housed calves reared for white veal.Recommendations1. Space should be enough to allow animals to fulfil their needs for social behaviour, lying and grooming.Supported by further evidence 2. As the pen shape affects the use of space by animals, pens should be rectangular rather than square and pen space should be divided into different usable areas.Supported by further evidence NR.4 More research should be focused on pen design to improve calf comfort and achieve environmental enrichment. Flooring and bedding material (Section 9.4. of EFSA, 2006) Conclusions NC.8 At present, white and pink veal calves are almost exclusively kept on wooden slatted floors and concrete slatted floors, respectively. The available data, however, suggest that other floor types may be more comfortable and may possibly provide health benefits. There is some evidence that floor type may have an effect on the health of artificially reared calves, in particular with regard to the risk of diarrhoea, which was higher on farms with concrete slatted floors relative to farms with other floors. NC.9 The prevalence of bursal swelling in the knee was significantly higher in white veal calves housed on concrete (about 17 %) than that in calves housed either on wooden slats (about 7 %) or on rubber or straw (< 1 %). The difference in average prevalence of swelling of the bursa in the knee was also significantly higher in calves housed on wooden slats than calves housed on rubber or straw.NC.10 Provision of small amounts of straw or rubber mats for veal calves on wooden slats can result in discomfort due to dirty and wet floors, unless these floors are well managed.Recommendations1. As the floor type affects the resting and lying postures of calves it should be comfortable. Wet floors should be avoided due to thermal and resting problems. Welfare-friendly floor types and their alternatives should be researched for intensively kept veal calves, particularly for the relationship between floor type and (veal) calf health, such as diarrhoea.Degree of social contact (Section 9.5. of EFSA, 2006) Conclusions 1. Group housing can help calves to acquire social skills. Some experience of mixing is important as calves that have been reared for a while in groups dominate calves that have always been in individual crates.", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF34": {"text": "No change 4. Odour, bioaerosols, ammonia, nitrogen, phosphorous and heavy metals may either have a local or a regional impact. Gases such as methane and nitrous oxide contribute to global warming.No change 5. Respiratory disorders are the second largest reason for morbidity and mortality in calf rearing. The most important causes are environmental conditions such as hygiene, management and the physical, chemical and biological factors in the environment.Aerial pollutants in confined animal houses are detrimental to respiratory health. Primary and opportunistic microbial pathogens may cause directly infectious and allergic diseases in farm animals, and chronic exposure to some types of aerial pollutants may exacerbate multi-factorial environmental diseases, especially the respiratory disease syndrome. The environmental factors include too low temperatures, high ammonia concentrations, overstocking and poor ventilation resulting in low air quality. Ventilation plays a decisive role in reducing the incidence of respiratory disease. Temperatures below 5 \u00baC can compromise lung function. Ammonia concentrations of more than 6 ppm seem to increase respiratory infections. Relative humidity of more than 80 % bear the risk of increased heat dissipation and can help bacteria to survive in airborne state.-Conclusions from 6 to 8 related to section 9.6. of EFSA, 2006, represent a misinterpretation of a statistical analysis of simple associations without taking account of cofactors.-Low ammonia concentrations reflect increased air movement, which may affect respiratory disease through increased cold stress. Sufficient air space in confined buildings can help to reduce the concentration of airborne bacteria.", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF35": {"text": "Recommendations1. The development of low emission production systems should be encouraged including mitigation techniques, e.g. biofilters, bioscrubbers, covered manure pits and shallow manure application. In particular there is need to reduce ammonia emissions from slatted floor units or to reduce the usage of such systems. Adequate and efficient feeding regimes are required with minimal wastage of nitrogen and phosphorous and limited use of growth promoters and drugs. There is an urgent need for cooperative research to design appropriate ventilation systems to improve health and welfare of calves kept in confined rearing conditions.Ventilation should be regulated to keep ammonia concentrations as low as possible without creating draughts at the calf level. Housing and management should aim a reducing dust, bacteria and endotoxin concentrations in the animal house air.Human-animal relationships (Section 9.7. of EFSA, 2006) Recommendations 1. Stockpersons should be appropriately trained so that they have sufficient skills in rearing calves. They should have a positive attitude towards animals and work with them in order to minimise stress and to maintain a high quality of health control. Rough contact (e.g. use of painful device such as an electric prod, loud noises) should be avoided and gentle contacts (e.g. talking softly, stroking, offering food) should be encouraged. This sort of contact is of particular importance for calves in groups or with their dam that tend not to approach humans readily.Dehorning and castration (Section 9.8. of EFSA, 2006) Conclusions NC.11 Calves reared for white veal are neither disbudded nor castrated. Disbudding is performed in young calves from the dairy herd destined for beef or dairy production, but the methods and pain management protocols are the same as those included in the beef cattle Chapter of this Opinion.Recommendations a) If cattle are to be dehorned, it is recommend to disbud young For recommendations dealing with disbudding in calves, the reader 4.3.8.cattle rather than to dehorn older ones. Disbudding by cautery is recommended over other methods.", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF36": {"text": "NC.12 Identifying sick animals in the early stages of disease is a crucial element for therapeutic success. Environmental factors predisposing to respiratory disease are lack of ventilation, high animal density, extreme temperatures and high relative humidity.NC.13 Calves that do not get good quality colostrum after birth are more susceptible to respiratory disease at the feedlot. NC.14 Non-perforating abomasal lesions affect more than half the population of veal calves. There are less of these lesions in veal calves kept in welfare-friendly installations. NC.15 Infections may occur in the umbilical cord of newborn calves, leading to bacteraemia and infection of the joints, meninges and internal organs. NC.16 The average weight of calves upon arrival at the veal farm may be a risk factor for respiratory disease during the early stages of the fattening period. Light-weight-calves may be more at risk than heavier ones. For the major enteric and respiratory infections, supportive treatments including oral or parenteral rehydration and systemic analgesia (NSAID) should be provided. Calves from dairy farms should get an adequate quantity of colostrum at the most appropriate time. After receiving adequate colostrum and separation from their dams, artificially-reared calves should be housed in group pens that permit social contact when there is a low risk of enteric and respiratory disease. When the disease risk is high it may be necessary to isolate calves from contagion or short-range airborne infection until early weaning at 4-6 weeks or entry into a unit rearing calves for white veal. However, there should be no compensation for bad management of calves, such as the mixing of groups of calves from different sources, by individual housing. calves NR.10 An on-farm humane killing (euthanasia) programme is a requirement for the welfare of severely distressed, injured, or moribund calves. This programme should be created by a veterinarian and include teaching of stockpersons to recognise calves that are candidates for euthanasia and appointment, as well as training of specific personnel to perform it competently.NR.11 Frequent and competent observations of groups and individuals, including faecal scoring and early treatment and isolation of sick animals, are necessary to control diseases in calves. NR.12 Navel disinfection or ligature should be performed in calves born in pens (dairy calves), when needed for hygiene reasons. NR.13 The condition and immunocompetence of calves should be improved upon arrival at intensive fattening units, for example by taking heavier-weight calves. More research is required into effective strategies to enhance the condition, immunocompetence and \"robustness\" of calves in general upon arrival at the fattening unit.Brscic M, Leruste H, Heutinck LFM, Bokkers EAM, Wolthuis-Fillerup M, Stockhofe N, Gottardo F, Duff GC and Galyean ML, 2007.

Rumination may account for a substantial part of cattle activity. Rumination is under voluntary control and when animals are disturbed they cease to ruminate.Additionally: Rumination time is primarily determined by the quantity of long fibre in the diet and, when diets are lacking in long fibres, normal rumination and salivation are greatly reduced and can lead to digestive disorders. Beef cattle can tolerate and adapt to a wide range of air temperatures.-Metabolic heat production increases with increasing feed intake. Thus animals on the highest rations are least sensitive to cold and most sensitive to heat. Cold stress can be reduced by provision of appropriate shelter and a dry lying area. UC.4 Adequate ventilation is crucial for cattle kept indoors especially in hot weather or when density is high.

Spaying is likely to cause severe pain and distress and there is no indication for it.Additionally: Spaying causes pain, may lead to complications, such as peritonitis, and its indications can be replaced by management decisions. Tail docking is likely to cause pain and interfere with the normal behaviour of the animal.Additionally:The tail is essential for insect control.UC.10Dehorning by any amputation method causes severe pain and distress.

The prevalence of feedlot bloat can be greatly reduced by incorporating at least 15 % roughage in the diet. Beef cattle fed intensively on high grain rations (< 15 % physically effective fibre) are at a high risk of digestive disorders, especially sub-acute ruminal acidosis (SARA).-Cattle that experience repeated episodes of SARA are at risk of rumen parakeratosis, liver abscesses and laminitis. Measures for the control of SARA include the feeding of buffers, drugs to stimulate salivation and antibiotics (e.g. tylosin, monensin).UC.18Specific substances in the diet such as mycotoxins can lead to health problems.Additionally: Poorly conserved silage may be a source of mycotoxins, and pathogenic bacteria such as Listeria and Clostridium spp. Mixing and regrouping of cattle increase the incidence of agonistic behaviours and also have disadvantages from a health perspective. Older and more aggressive animals may cause trauma and continuous and severe stress to lower ranking calves (bullers).-Small and young animals are more prone to disease if kept with larger and older animals. -Young heifers may be harassed and become pregnant when kept with sexually mature bulls.

Early weaning demands a more careful management of the calf than late weaning.No change NC.3 It remains unclear whether two-stage weaning methods for calves of approximately 180 days of age, such as fenceline contact or the use of nose flaps, actually provide better welfare for the calves as compared with immediate total separation.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Genetics"}, {"text": "Recommendations 1. Specific care should be given to the newly weaned suckling calves. They should be kept in groups of familiar animals to avoid fighting and cross-contamination. If some mixing is necessary, and in order to minimise disease, the environment should minimise stress and appropriate treatments should be given. Weaning should be carried out so that stress is minimal in both cows and calves.No change 2. Routine early weaning of suckled beef calves (2-3 months) should be avoided, as this can have a negative impact on health of the calves. Weaning at 6 to 9 months is recommended.No change 3. Calves should be encouraged to eat some solid feed at an early age and especially in the four-week period prior to weaning at 6 to 9 months of age. 152Calves that do not get good quality colostrum after birth are more susceptible to respiratory disease at the feedlot.-Contaminated colostrum management of diseases in calves NC.14 Non-perforating abomasal lesions affect more than half the population of veal calves.

Since differential diagnosis is complex it has become common practice to devise treatments and control programmes which deal with several diseases as a group.Bullers: can be defined as steers that will stand to be ridden. Bullers are a significant problem throughout the cattle feeding industry. Late-1990s data indicates that in most feedyards, 1-4 % of all steers are identified as bullers.Castration: is the removal of the gonads. Although the word is more commonly used to designate the removal of the testicles, it can also be applied to females (see Spaying). Three methods are frequent in male cattle castrationring or band; clamp or Burdizzo; and surgical castration.Co-mingling: mixing of animals from different sources.Dehorning: or horn amputation, is the removal of the visible and palpated horns after they have formed. Dehorning can be carried out at any stage from 3-4 months of age. In adult cattle it usually means the opening and exposure of the frontal sinus.Disbudding: involves destroying the horn-producing cells (corium) of the horn bud, and it is undertaken on young calves usually under the age of 2-3 months. The methods used are thermocautery or hot-iron dehorning and chemical cautery with a strong alkali.DNA marker: a specific DNA variation that can be tested for association with phenotypic characteristics (trait).Factor: any aspect of the environment of the animal, in relation to housing and management, genetic selection of animals, transport and slaughter, which may have the potential to improve or impair the welfare of animals.Hazard: a factor with the potential to cause poor welfare.Marker Assisted Management (MAM): the process by which DNA marker information is used to assist in making management decisions, such as sorting cattle entering a feedlot based on their propensity to meet certain criteria as determined by a genetic test.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Bloat (Ruminal tympany):"}, {"text": "the process by which DNA marker information is used to select parents for the next generation.Marker panel: a combination of two or more DNA markers which are associated with a particular trait.Metabolisable Energy (ME) and Protein (MP) Systems: provide the framework for describing the requirements and formulating diets in cattle.Neo-natal diarrhea: undifferentiated diarrhoea of the newborn (under 15 days of age) for which an aetiologic diagnosis is not practical.
