Science strives to be the objective search for truth through empirical proof to verify hypotheses as the foundation for theories, scientific laws, and ultimately paradigms. It simply is unrealistic, however, to presume that those with power will excuse science from political and commercial pressures that drive the rest of society. Organizations understandably view the scientists they employ or fund as resources for their policies and whistle-blowers as individuals who substitute their own personal agendas or policy preferences for those of the employer whom they are supposed to serve. But whistle-blowers view themselves as first serving the scientific method and the integrity of their research. This clash of loyalties is inevitable and timeless, and so is retaliation.",

Despite those classic patterns of suppression, currently whistle-blowing is increasingly common both within public and private sector contexts, with increasing impact. What once was the rare aberration is taking root (Calland and Dehn 2004; Miceli et al. 2008). This chapter primarily surveys scientific whistle-blowers who have overcome those barriers to make a difference and how they did it. It analyzes the strategies and tactics they have used successfully to challenge the status quo. Finally, it illustrates how the rule of law can help make a difference by combining loyalty to the scientific method with legal campaigns to make a difference. It emphasizes scientific whistle-blowers from the United States, which has pioneered these free speech rights generally and specifically for scientists in the Whistleblower Protection Enhancement Act of 2012.",

Dr. Blumsohn was a researcher at Sheffield University in England, which contracted with the multinational US firm Procter and Gamble (P&G) to study therapy responses of its osteoporosis drug Actonel.

To pursue the research, Dr. Blumsohn conducted \u201cblind\u201d tests, not knowing whether subjects received Actonel or a placebo. To learn the results, he had to study the company\u2019s \u201crandomization codes\u201d to sort who had received what. But P&G refused to provide them on grounds that they were proprietary information and told him to accept its own summary (GAP 2006). Although he refused, P&G began ghostwriting and publishing under Blumsohn\u2019s name research findings about Actonel that he had not made. When he was finally permitted to do a limited review, he discovered that up to 40 % of data essential for conclusions on different graphs was missing. Under public pressure, on June 2006, P&G released the missing data to Dr. Blumsohn. The results were unfavorable for Actonel, and he was able to publicly correct the record (Blumsohn 2006).",

In 1993 Dr. Chandler was a clinical researcher at Cook County (Illinois) Hospital\u2019s Hektoen Institute, specializing in addiction treatment, when the hospital received a National Institutes of Health (NIH) grant to test a new model for treatment of pregnant heroin addicts. The experiment, named \u201cNew Start,\u201d was to replace neighborhood clinics that dispensed methadone. Instead, it would provide a \u201cCadillac\u201d treatment \u2013 holistic therapy that included day care, training, and other assistance beyond mere distribution of an alternative drug. Among Dr. Chandler\u2019s duties as project director for the grant was running the accompanying day care center. Unfortunately, she learned that systematic fraud compromised the program. So much money was diverted that the children did not have electricity and hot water, and single cribs had to accommodate multiple infants. She further protested that the institute was sending false progress reports on the study. Instead of careful controls, women were recruited off the streets with enticements of shopping discount certificates. Data was reported for \u201cghost subjects.\u201d The actual humans did not provide informed consent before participating, and inadequate records supported claimed results. The clinic diluted methadone by up to 80 %, which left the pregnant addicts still working the streets as prostitutes to support their heroin addictions. In short, the deluxe program was far less effective than the traditional clinics and actually made matters worse for many who participated (Chandler 1996). Although Dr. Chandler was terminated in 1995 after speaking out, she persisted and prevailed. With help from her attorney Barack Obama in Cook County v. United States ex rel. Chandler, 538 U.S. 119 (2003), she won a precedent-setting Supreme Court decision holding the county liable for treble damages under the US False Claims Act.",

Vehicles carrying troops could not withstand land mines, which had become the primary source of casualties. But adequate Mine Resistant Armored Protective (MRAP) vehicles had been paid for, inspected, and sent to warehouses, where they had been gathering dust for 19 months without delivery. Mr. Gayl\u2019s mission was to free up delivery of the MRAP vehicles. When his Pentagon briefing of General Petraeus was canceled, Gayl began blowing the whistle to Congress and then through congressional referral to the media. After an ensuing public spotlight which included congressional hearings, the MRAP vehicles were delivered (Cantu 2011; Merit Systems Protection Board 2011). The results were dramatic. Land mine casualties before delivery had been 60 %, including 80 % of fatalities. Afterward the casualty rate dropped to 5 %. Subsequent Pentagon research on roadside explosions in Iraq and Afghanistan demonstrated that the MRAP vehicles were 14 times more effective than their predecessor (Vanden Brook 2012; Lamb 2014). Gayl paid a horrible price in retaliation for his disclosures. He was silenced, suspended, ordered to take psychiatric examinations, stripped of his duties, temporarily stripped of his security clearance, placed under repeated criminal investigations, reassigned to his home as a duty station, and fired (Cantu 2011; Soeken 2014). After a 7-year legal battle, the marines settled his case on terms that included a commendation which recognized his whistle-blowing and appointment to a new team established to prepare whistle-blowing policy and training for the marines.",

Vioxx, a potent \u201cCox-2\u201d painkiller, had caused between 30 and 55,000 fatal heart attacks. His testimony attacked inaccurate research claims for the drug\u2019s safety that the FDA improperly had accepted as safety verification (Graham 2004). The manufacturer Merck faced some 27,000 lawsuits for claims that eventually settled at $4.85 billion in damages and pulled the drug from US markets (Wadman 2007). Although defensive FDA officials intensified efforts to silence Dr. Graham, he persisted against a broad array of highly profitable but dangerous Cox-2 drugs with similar qualities to Vioxx. The agency placed unprecedented safety restrictions on all Cox-2 pain relievers, finding that the drugs were dangerous. Treating Vioxx like cigarettes, it banned product advertisements and required large warning labels (Government Accountability Project 2005).",

He also has been the pioneer scientist warning about potentially apocalyptic effects from global warming. On June 23, 1988, he testified before the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee on the causal relationship between human emissions and higher temperatures, warning that \u201cthe greenhouse effect is here.\u201d The New York Times responded, \u201cGlobal Warming Has Begun\u201d (Nation Institute 2013). His alarms principally targeted the use of fossil fuels that emit carbon dioxide, predicting that \u201c[b]urning all fossil fuels could result in the planet being not only ice-free but human-free\u201d (Merchant 2013). Hansen warned that without a social overhaul to reduce carbon emissions, earth will reach a tipping point beyond which it is too late to stop glaciers from melting, with temperatures over the next century increasing 4\u20135 \u00b0F. The last time earth was that hot, some 3 million years ago, sea levels were 80 f. higher than today. Florida was largely underwater, and coastlines were up to 50 miles inland, which would exile most of today\u2019s concentrated populations. Katrina disasters would become the rule rather than the exception, with cities forced to continually rebuild above a transient water line (NASA 2006). His research helped spark international conferences and treaties (United Nations 1992), as well as in-depth, ongoing UN studies substantially confirming his concerns (Climate Science Watch 2014).",

Dr. Morris spoke out in every available forum from the FDA to the Phil Donahue national television program. He warned that the vaccine would be a net public health hazard.

He charged that the $29 billion anti-ballistic missile defense was based on false scientific claims unsupported by credible research. He further documented that the Department of Defense was paying contractors multiple times for the same studies containing different covers and summaries but identical research, with overcharges up to $3 billion (Saucier 1992; Page 1993). His most significant disclosures, however, challenged the planned trillion-dollar next generation of Star Wars, known as Brilliant Pebbles. The vision for that strategy was to shoot shotgun-like blasts of \u201cpebbles,\u201d or small interceptors, from satellites to knock out enemy missiles from above. As Mr. Saucier\u2019s research demonstrated, however, the pebbles would burn up in the earth\u2019s atmosphere far above the highest point of any missile invented. The army proposed Mr. Saucier\u2019s termination for unacceptable performance (Evans 1992). But the US Office of Special Counsel found a \u201csubstantial likelihood\u201d that he was correct and ordered an investigation of his charges (Cushman 1992). Although the Pentagon did not concede error, his disclosures received broad support from the media, independent scientists, and NGOs. Congress conducted its own investigations, and in 1993 the Brilliant Pebbles program was canceled (Giraffe Heroes Project 2014; Marshall and Claremont Institutes 2014).",

His research supported three primary concerns: (1) Some consumers are allergic to drugs in animal feed, and they are vulnerable to severe adverse reactions; (2) Drugs that cause abnormal increases in body weight or maturity in animals can have the same impact on consumers, such as children becoming fully mature before they are teenagers; and (3) Some consumers unwittingly build up a dangerous resistance to antibiotics from steady usage of those drugs in animal feed, preventing them from working when needed.

He began to blow the whistle internally, however, when associated research projects were inadequately supported or canceled altogether, as was the entire research program eventually. He became convinced that, contrary to its official position, the company was trying to kill advances in cigarette safety, in part because saving lives could undermine defenses against lawsuits that existing products were unsafe. In 1993 the company fired him. Dr. Wigand, however, worked closely with the media, Food and Drug Administration Chief Donald Kessler, Congress, and prosecutors for his disclosures to make a difference. They did, after being highlighted by the Wall Street Journal and eventually the CBS 60 Minutes program. His disclosures led to a massive wave of government litigation against the tobacco industry. Despite threats of civil and criminal prosecution, his testimony for state attorneys general was a turning point in litigation that resulted in a $206 billion settlement, one of history\u2019s largest. Eventually Hollywood turned his story into an Oscar-nominated movie, The Insider. He went on to start a new career as a high school science and Japanese teacher, winning an award as Fannie Mae First Class Teacher of the Year.

It must be signed by the agency chief and include a summary of evidence received and how the investigation was conducted, reveal new evidence obtained, make findings of fact and conclusions of law, and commit to any relevant corrective action. The report then goes to the whistle-blower for comments, after which it is evaluated by the OSC for completeness and reasonableness. If the Special Counsel finds the report in noncompliance, it either can send the referral back to the agency to redo in whole or in part or close the case with a finding that the agency has not responded lawfully to the disclosure. The Special Counsel then transmits the entire package, including the whistle-blower\u2019s comments and OSC evaluation, to the president and relevant congressional offices and posts it publicly on the OSC website.\n",

They unanimously concluded that Mr. Saucier\u2019s concerns were well taken. They concluded that the concerns about incompetence applied not to Mr. Saucier but to the army officials who made that charge against him (Devine 1993).

It long has been recognized within the whistle-blower community that support from an effective congressional \u201cangel\u201d can be far more powerful than legal rights. This applies both to making a difference and to surviving professionally. That is particularly the case if the aroused member sits on a committee with relevant budget, legislative, and/or oversight authority. Franz Gayl, for example, did not file a WPA whistle-blowing disclosure. But his briefings for the Chairs of the Senate Armed Services, Foreign Relations, and Intelligence Committees, among others, placed a spotlight on the Marine Corps for failing to timely deliver MRAP vehicles to Iraq and Afghanistan (GAP 2013; POGO 2008). The congressional spotlight led to prominent media coverage. After the Corps\u2019 leaders were unable to defend the delay in Senate hearings, the lifesaving vehicles were finally freed up and sent to the troops (Soeken 2014; Vanden Brook 2014). Aldric Saucier never convinced the Department of Defense to admit error on Star Wars or Brilliant Pebbles, but he made a difference by helping convince the House Appropriations Committee to cut off funding. Stern warnings from House Judiciary Committee Chairman John Conyers helped Saucier professionally to survive long enough to make a difference (Foerstal 2010: 43\u201345; Rothstein 1992). Dr. David Graham sparked an immediate national media scandal by releasing his scientific dissent in 2004 Senate Judiciary Committee hearings. When the FDA tried to remove his duties through reassignment, it reconsidered and withdrew the proposal after sharp protests and warnings from 22 members of Congress, including Senator Charles Grassley (California Healthline 2004). Ned Feder and Walter Stewart took this tactic the next step, after the House Commerce Committee possessing relevant oversight authority brought them onto its staff for temporary assignments with a mandate to continue investigative work from an independent perch (Culliton 1990).\n",
