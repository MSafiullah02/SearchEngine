            "text": "The release of bioactive vesicles by one cell and its interaction with others expands the mechanisms of intercellular communication. Exosomes are one type of bioactive vesicle that has received considerable attention, as they are derived from the release of intraluminal vesicles upon fusion of multivesicular bodies (MVBs) with the plasma membrane and therefore contain constituents present in the endocytic network 1, 2. Moreover, exosomes are functionally diverse and known to be released from numerous cell types including cells of hematopoietic and nonhematopoietic origin. Exosome release was originally observed in maturing reticulocytes and appears to function in eliminating nonessential proteins from the maturing red blood cells. Later studies demonstrated that exosomes derived from B cells and other antigen\u2010presenting cells were enriched for MHC class II, as well as co\u2010stimulatory molecules like CD86 and could present antigens to sensitized T cells 3. More recent studies have shown that exosomes carrying tumor antigens can promote antigen\u2010specific T\u2010cell activation and tumor rejection in vivo\n4.",

These studies have identified common as well as cell\u2010type specific proteins 5. Moreover, the composition of the excreted exosomes can change when the cell of origin is exposed to different environmental conditions or to foreign material 2. We found that exosomes released from Mycobacterium\u2010infected macrophages carry mycobacterial antigens such as the 19 KDa lipoprotein and lipoarabinomannan 6. The exosomes, which were released from mycobacterial\u2010infected macrophages, induced a MyD88\u2010dependent proinflammatory response in na\u00efve macrophages 6.",

However, the mycobacterial proteins present in isolated exosomes which could promote T\u2010cell activation were not defined in this study. Therefore, to address this question, we established the first extensive proteomic analysis of exosomes isolated from M. tuberculosis H37Rv\u2010infected macrophages. Our analysis identified 41 mycobacterial proteins including some well\u2010known antigenic proteins such as ESAT\u20106 (Rv3875), Ag85 complex (Rv3804c, Rv1886c, Rv0129c), MPT64 (1980c) and MPT63 (1926c). We also found that J774 cells incubated with Mycobactrium tuberculosis (M.tb) culture filtrate proteins (CFPs) released exosomes containing a number of the highly antigenic M.tb proteins. Moreover, these exosomes could stimulate macrophage and dendritic cell (DC) activation in vitro and activate na\u00efve CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in vivo, suggesting a possible use for these exosomes as a TB vaccine.",

With the exception of the identification of LpqH and SodA, the Western blot analysis is consistent with the findings observed through our shotgun proteomic approach (Table 1). Due to the complexity of the exosome samples and the inclusion of murine proteins in the MS analysis, it is likely that the LpqH and SodA peptides were either less susceptible to ionization or suppressed by the abundant host peptides. The benefit of this LC\u2010MS/MS analysis was our ability to identify exosomal proteins without the need for additional detection reagents (i.e. antibodies), as well as discovering proteins that were not predicted. In addition, previous studies indicated that CFP\u201010 and ESAT\u20106 are secreted from the M.tb as a complex 16 and suggest that these proteins might also be in exosomes. Although we observed the presence of CFP\u201010 by Western blot, we found that exosomes released from infected J774 cells also contain ESAT\u20106 by LC\u2010MS/MS (Fig. 1, Table 1).",

To test this prediction, mice were administered intranasally with exosomes from uninfected or CFP\u2010treated cells +/\u2212 adjuvant as described in Section 2 and 2 wk after the final vaccination the lungs, MLN and spleens were harvested. Single cell suspensions were stimulated ex vivo with CFP and the T cells were analyzed for proliferation, IFN\u2010\u03b3 production and memory phenotype. As shown in Fig. 5, both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells isolated from mice treated with CFP\u2010exosomes showed increased production of IFN\u2010\u03b3 upon restimulation with CFP and this was evident in all three organs. The adjuvant did not have a significant effect on the number of T cells which were positive for IFN\u2010\u03b3, suggesting that exosomes contain both adjuvant and antigenic properties. This conclusion is supported by the data shown in Fig. 3 which indicate that exosomes from CFP\u2010treated cells can promote DC activation. CD4+ and CD8+ T cells isolated from mice treated with CFP\u2010exosomes but not from mice treated with uninfected exosomes also showed increased proliferation when stimulated ex vivo with CFP (Figs. 5D and E). Previous studies indicated that antigen\u2010specific effector memory cells may play an important role in protection against M.tb in BCG\u2010vaccinated individuals 18, 19. Therefore, we addressed whether effector memory cells were produced in mice vaccinated with CFP\u2010exosome and found CD44hi, CD62Llow CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, which is indicative of effector memory cells, in all three organs (Figs. 5F and G). Together, the data suggest that vaccination of mice with exosomes isolated from CFP\u2010treated J774 cells can induce a profile of T\u2010cell activation often associated with M.tb control (i.e. IFN\u2010\u03b3 production and effector memory cells).",

The exosomes activated both the innate and the acquired immune responses suggesting the presences of multiple mycobacterial components. However, in these previous reports only the antigen 85 complex was identified. In this study, an MS proteomic approach was taken to identify the mycobacterial proteins present in exosomes released from M.tb\u2010infected J774 cells. A surprisingly high number of mycobacterial proteins (i.e. 41) were identified along with a number of expected host proteins. Why the high number and why these particular proteins? Most of the identified proteins are known to be secreted by M.tb and some, including the fibronectin attachment protein have been shown previously to be released outside the phagosome 21. Recent studies have identified two major mechanisms by which proteins are targeted to the intraluminal vesicles of MVBs for subsequent release in exosomes. One involves ubiquitination of proteins which is recognized by the ESCRT (endosomal sorting complex required for transport) machinery for subsequent trafficking and retention of proteins in the intraluminal vesicles 22. A second mechanism appears to involve aggregation of membrane proteins forming microdomains which may stabilize the exosomal membrane domains 22. Although we did not find ubiquitination motifs among the different M.tb exosome proteins, we could not determine from our analysis whether these proteins are aggregating within the phagosome and subsequently trafficked through the endocytic network into MVBs. In addition to these known pathways, there is some evidence to indicate that there may be ESCRT\u2010independent transport mechanisms 23 but whether some or all of the mycobacterial proteins use these alternative targeting pathways must wait until the process is better defined. This is further complicated by the lack of studies addressing the mechanism of phagosomal protein trafficking to MVBs which may differ from how plasma membrane or endosomal proteins are targeted to MVBs and exosomes.",

At the time of this publication, no other study has defined the microbial components present in exosomes following infection with an intracellular pathogen. Some studies with HIV\u2010infected macrophages and DCs suggest that HIV may bud from cells through exosomes or exosome\u2010like vesicles 24, 25. Other studies have shown that the HIV Gag protein, when expressed in cells, shows preferential targeting to MVBs and release in exosomes 26. Studies by Raposo and colleagues have shown that prion protein in both its normal and its scrappie conformation are trafficked to MVBs and released in exosomes 27. Prion diseases are fatal neurodegenerative disorders and the infectious forms involve transmission of the prion protein in its scrappie conformation to a susceptible host. The possibility that exosomes may promote the transfer of prion protein is an intriguing one.",

To what degree exosomes promote or inhibit immunity will likely depend on what mycobacterial components are present on the exosomes at any given time. The proteomic analysis of exosomes released from infected macrophages as described in this study is the first venture into dissecting their protein composition. Future studies will be needed to define how exosome composition may change over time particularly during the course of an in vivo infection and how this correlates with bacterial burden and the stage of infection. The eventual goal is to better understand exosome's role during the course of an M.tb infection. Nevertheless, our previous studies demonstrate that exosomes isolated from M. bovis BCG\u2010infected J774 cells could activate both na\u00efve CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, suggesting that under some conditions exosomes from infected macrophages can promote an acquired immune response. This also suggests that exosomes with the right subset of M.tb components may function as a viable vaccine candidate and the presence of highly antigenic M.tb proteins on the isolated exosomes supports this possibility. Members of the 85 complex which are proteins found in exosomes were originally described as a prominent TB antigens in animal models and within infected humans 30, 31. Subsequent subunit vaccine studies in nonhuman primates showed that this antigen along with another well\u2010known antigen ESAT\u20106 provides protection against M.tb infection 32. Clinical trials are presently ongoing using an Ag85B\u2010ESAT\u20106 fusion protein as a subunit vaccine.",

Interestingly, we found 29 M.tb proteins on these exosomes. There are approximately 205 M.tb proteins in the culture supernatant 15 so our findings that 29 of these including ESAT\u20106 and the 85 complex are trafficked to MVBs and exosomes suggest an efficient transport mechanism. However, why these specific M.tb proteins are targeted is not known. Another interesting observation was that the majority of these exosomal proteins (25 of the 29) were also present in exosomes from M.tb\u2010infected macrophages. This indicates that these proteins are targeted to MVBs and exosomes independent of whether they traffic through the phagosome or through endocytic pathway. It is important to note that the M.tb is washed prior to the macrophage infection and there is no culture supernatant added to the cells at the time of infection. The \u201cfeeding\u201d of proteins to DC, B cells or macrophages to produce exosomes containing the added proteins has been performed in the context of tumor antigens 1, 33 as well as microbial antigens from T. gondii\n34, diphtheria toxin from Streptococcus pneumoniae\n35 and spike S protein from the SARS\u2010associated coronavirus 36, suggesting that this may be a mechanism to \u201cengineer\u201d exosomes to contain specific proteins.

The number of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells which produced IFN\u2010\u03b3 upon ex\u2010vivo stimulation was comparable to our previous studies when exosomes from BCG\u2010infected macrophages were used for vaccination 7. The same held true for the production of effective memory T cells. The similar levels of T\u2010cell activation induced by exosomes from CFP\u2010treated and BCG\u2010infected macrophages suggest that in our mouse model they share the major antigens that are inducing the acquired immune response. However, which of these 25 shared M.tb proteins are the major contributors to the T\u2010cell response is presently unknown. Nevertheless, the exosomes derived from CFP\u2010treated macrophages have distinct advantages over those generated from M.tb\u2010infected macrophages with the major advantage stemming from the removal of a BSL3 pathogen infection from the exosome\u2010generation process. Moreover, like the exosomes from M.tb\u2010infected macrophages, CFP\u2010exosomes did not require adjuvant for activation of na\u00efve T cell in vivo and could promote DC activation and maturation in vitro. In contrast, CFP alone, although capable of inducing T\u2010cell activation when injected into mice, could only do so in the presence of adjuvant 37. This is an important consideration since only Alum has been approved as an adjuvant for use in humans. Future studies will determine whether the CFP\u2010exosomes when used to vaccinate mice protect against an M.tb infection.",
