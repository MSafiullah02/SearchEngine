In the United States, 108 cases were confirmed.1 Coronavirus family members are known to be responsible for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS\u2010CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS\u2010CoV), associated with severe complications, such as acute respiratory distress syndrome, multiorgan failure, and death, especially in individuals with underlying comorbidities and old age.2, 3\n",

Previously, the China National Health Commission reported that death mainly affects older adults, since the median age of the first 17 deaths up to January 22, 2020, was 75 years (range = 48\u201089 years).5 Moreover, people aged 70 years or older had shorter median days (11.5 days) from the first symptom to death than younger adults (20 days), suggesting a faster disease progression in older adults.5\n",

Therefore, it seems essential to limit the risk of spreading the virus in facilities caring for older patients at all costs. This could mean drastic quarantine measures for staff members who have stayed in high\u2010risk areas or have been in close contact with possible cases. If any suspected case of COVID\u201019 infection occurs, transfer to a specialized facility as soon as possible is crucial since long\u2010term care facilities are not adequately equipped to effectively manage case containment. While waiting for the transfer, placing the patient in a single room, wearing a mask (N95 or FFP2 respirators for healthcare practitioners), and careful hand hygiene using alcohol\u2010based hand rub (or soap and water when hands are visibly soiled) are the key prevention measures to limit spread of COVID\u201019. They must also be combined with eye protection and systematic use of disposable blouses and gloves to provide the optimal level of protection.",

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention state that there is no specific antiviral treatment recommended, and patients should receive supportive care to help relieve symptoms. For severe cases, treatment should include care to support vital organ functions.10 Secondary prevention and care of general complications could also be a major issue in older patients. Indeed, in seasonal influenza, for example, a large proportion of deaths are related to decompensation of comorbidities and complications occurring after the infection.7 Particularly, reducing incidence of venous thromboembolism, catheter\u2010related bloodstream infection, pressure ulcers, falls, and delirium is recommended. These measures should be adapted to comorbidities, polypharmacy, and frailty of older patients.9, 10 We assume that they could also be crucial in case of COVID\u201019 in older adults.",
