Cases and deaths will increase as the virus continues its global march outward. In the absence of effective pharmaceutical interventions or a vaccine, wide-spread virological screening is required to inform where restrictive isolation measures should be targeted and when they can be lifted 2-6 . However, limitations on testing capacity have restricted the ability of governments and institutions to identify individual clinical cases, appropriately measure community prevalence, and mitigate transmission. Group testing offers a way to increase efficiency, by combining samples and testing a small number of pools 7-9 . Here, we evaluate the effectiveness of group testing designs for individual identification or prevalence estimation of SARS-CoV-2 infection when testing capacity is limited. To do this, we developed mathematical models for epidemic spread, incorporating empirically measured individual-level viral kinetics to simulate changing viral loads in a large population over the course of an epidemic. We used these to construct representative populations and assess pooling strategies for community screening, accounting for variability in viral load samples, dilution effects, changing prevalence and resource constraints. We confirmed our group testing framework through pooled tests on de-identified human nasopharyngeal specimens with viral loads representative of the larger population. We show that group testing designs can both accurately estimate overall prevalence using a small number of measurements and substantially increase the identification rate of infected individuals in resource-limited settings.",

In the classical version of the identification problem 7 , samples from multiple individuals are combined and tested as a single pool (Fig. 1a) . If the test is negative (which might be likely if the prevalence is low and the pool is not too large), then each of the individuals is assumed to have been negative. If the test is positive, it is assumed that at least one individual in the pool was positive; each of the pooled samples is then tested individually. This strategy leverages the low frequency of cases which would otherwise cause substantial inefficiency, as the majority of pools will test negative when prevalence is low. The simple pooling method can be expanded to combinatorial pooling (each sample represented in multiple pools) for direct sample identification 8,9 (Fig. 1b) and to pooled testing for prevalence estimation 10,11 (Fig.   1c) .",

Accounting for the within-host kinetics is important because during the course of an infection an individual's viral load can vary by at least 6 orders of magnitude 12-14 and this, along with the prevalence of infection will affect sensitivity to detect a positive sample once diluted in a pool. The position along the epidemic curve when the samples are collected (i.e., epidemic growth versus decline) is important because the population distribution of viral titers among those who are positive might (non-intuitively) vary depending on the stage of the epidemic. For example, during early phases, rapid growth of the epidemic implies that positive individuals are more likely to have been infected 4 more recently, such that viral titers likely capture the viral growth phase. The contrast is true on the downside of the epidemic, where an increasing number of individuals will be in the recovery (low virus titer) stage of infection. The importance of this bias depends both on the epidemic growth rate and the relative duration of the within-host viral growth and waning phases.",

For each simulated infection, an incubation period and virus titers over time were drawn at random from representative distributions of incubation periods 15 and virus titer kinetics using the parameter fits for viral load over time described above. From these simulations, we generated a contrived realistic population of individuals, each with time-varying viral loads on each day of the outbreak ( Fig.   2c ,e) and used these to evaluate optimal group testing strategies in a simulated epidemic.",

For example, we find that a population prevalence study that collects 9,216 samples can very accurately capture the true prevalence of infection by performing only 48 PCR tests (b = 48 pools of n = 192 samples each) and that this accuracy holds for a wide range of true prevalences from 0.005% to 30% ( Fig. 3b; Extended Data Fig. 3 ). As expected, the total number (N) of samples collected was important for accurate estimates depending on true prevalence. Specifically, estimates were most accurate when N is greater than one divided by prevalence (Fig. 3a) . When this condition is not met, the estimates perform somewhat better in capturing the prevalence represented within the samples themselves, but we find that error in representative sampling may drive discrepancies away from the true population prevalence (Fig. 3c and Extended Data Fig. 3) . For all values of N, partitioning the samples into more pools improves accuracy when N is greater than one divided by prevalence (see multiple rows with the same values for N in Fig. 3b ,c and Extended Data Fig. 3) . Thus, we find that with a sufficiently large number of total samples collected, very accurate estimates of prevalence can be measured using a small fraction of tests than would be needed in the absence of pooling.",

Because positive samples are diluted in a pool, usually with many negatives, we might intuit that the sensitivity of the assay would be reduced. However, it is worth noting that this is not 6 always the case because a feature of pooled testing is that a sample that becomes diluted below the LOD may nonetheless be identified ('rescued') if the pools containing that sample also include at least one other sample that is sufficiently above the LOD. Based on our models of viral kinetics, we estimate the sensitivity of conventional (non-pooled) PCR testing to be ~70% (i.e., 30% of the time we sample an infected individual who has a viral load greater than 1 but below the LOD; here 100 viral copies per mL, Fig. 4a ). This reflects a combination of either sampling during the incubation period of the virus (i.e., after infection but prior to the onset of symptoms) as well as a relatively long duration of low viral titers during viral clearance (Fig. 2b, Extended Data Fig. 1 ).",

At early times in the epidemic, prevalence is low and sensitivity is decreased relative to individual testing for all pooling designs due to dilution. When prevalence is high (>10%), sensitivity of 7 group testing approaches the sensitivity of individual testing as lower viral load samples are 'rescued' by higher viral load samples (Fig. 4a) . Several aspects of the pooling design contribute to the decrease in sensitivity at earlier times. First, when more samples are tested, the dilution factor has the potential to be bigger. Second, for a given number of samples, the dilution factor will generally be larger when the number of pools is smaller. Third, for a given number of samples and pools, the dilution factor is bigger when each sample is split into more pools. Each of these effects is borne out in our results (Fig. 4a, Extended Data Fig. 4a) , with sensitivity decreasing roughly linearly as the log of the dilution factor (Extended Data Fig. 4a ). Importantly though, these lower sensitivities are due to failure to identify samples with low viral load (Extended Data   Fig. 4b,c,d) . Because viral titers peak early after viral infection while virus clearance is associated with a relatively long duration of low virus counts potentially for weeks afterwards (Extended Data Fig. 4b,d) , the loss in sensitivity stems from a failure to detect low viral load specimens that might be less clinically relevant. The benefits gained, in terms of testing efficiency, must therefore be weighed against the loss in sensitivity, both for surveillance and with an eye towards the clinical importance of missing low viral load specimens.",

Fig. 4b) for individual testing and a wide array of group designs (Extended Data Table 2 ), under a variety of \"budget\" constraints on the number of samples collected daily, and the number of reactions that can be run on a daily basis. Across all constraints considered, effectiveness (total recall relative to individual testing) of the optimal design ranges from 1 (when testing every sample individually is optimal) to 20 (i.e., identifying 20x more positive samples on a daily basis compared with individual testing with the same budget). Examining the effectiveness of the design achieving the greatest total recall under each combination of budget constraints (Fig. 4c) , shows that when sample collection is limiting, samples should always be screened individually (matching our intuitive understanding). When sample collection is in excess of reaction capacity, group testing becomes more effective, with single pool designs being most effective when samples are in slight excess (2-8x), and combinatorial designs being most effective when there is a large excess of samples relative to reaction capacity (see trends within rows as the number of samples increases in Fig. 4c ). When prevalence is higher (e.g., over days 70-120, with prevalence from 0.3% to 10%) the optimal designs shift more towards combinatorial pooling and the overall effectiveness is reduced (up to 5.5x more effective than individual testing; Extended Data Fig. 4e ).",

Our analysis suggests that a few dozen tests can be used to accurately infer prevalence, and we identify an array of designs for sample identification that optimize the rate at which infected individuals are identified under constraints on sample collection and reaction throughput. While our experimental tests suggest it might be possible to translate these results into practice, there are several reasons why theoretically optimized group testing designs might be limited in the practical context of SARS-CoV-2 epidemiology. First and foremost, there is little point in group testing when sample collection is limiting, as it has been during the current outbreak in some regions of the world due to limited availability of nasopharyngeal swabs. Moreover, even when swabs are not limiting and more samples could be collected, substantial logistical challenges in managing and tracking thousands of samples (potentially in multiple pools) must be overcome. In addition, while we assume that individuals are sampled from the population at random in our analysis, in practice samples that are processed together were also typically collected together. Substantial coordination will therefore be necessary to make group testing practical, but investing in these efforts could enable community .

We first partition the simulated population into training and testing sets. Observed viral loads in 20% of individuals (selected at random) are used to train the KDEs above. All remaining analyses are done on the testing population. We simulate viral loads in b pools of samples as e: \u00e9, where Poisson sampling is used to model the sampling of a small volume from each swab. From these we simulate Ct values, Y. At each time point, we randomly select N individuals, partition them into b pools, and simulate the pooled viral loads and Ct values, Y, with X = \u223c 8(38.5,1) sampled randomly in each trial and applying the transformation described previously.

If there are no errors, and at most one sample in the population is positive, then the set of positive tests across the pools uniquely identifies the single positive sample (as in Fig. 1b). Such designs are typically used in non-adaptive group testing, where the goal is to exactly identify the positive samples using only results on a single round of pooled tests. In order to be able to exactly decode up to k positives in a population of N samples, the number of combinatorial pools needs to scale as \u00ed(V [ @AB(8)) 8,9 .

In the process, the probe anneals to a specific target sequence located between the forward and reverse primers. During the extension phase of the PCR cycle, the 5' nuclease activity of Taq polymerase degrades the probe, causing the reporter dye to separate from the quencher dye, generating a fluorescent signal. With each cycle, additional reporter dye molecules are cleaved from their respective probes, increasing the fluorescence intensity. Fluorescence intensity is monitored at each PCR cycle by Applied Biosystems\u00ae ViiA7 Real-Time PCR System with QuantStudio version 1.3 software. The software allows the fluorescence intensity to be monitored at each PCR cycle to allow for the qualitative detection of nucleic acid from SARS-CoV-2.",
