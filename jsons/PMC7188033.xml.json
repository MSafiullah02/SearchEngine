While most cases being admitted to the operating room today fall under the auspices of life-threatening or limb-threatening operations, cancer surgery is arguably life-threatening if not conducted within a \u201creasonable\u201d time-frame. In addition, prioritization of resources away from cancer patients, who themselves are immunocompromised and debilitated, continues to raise major ethical dilemmas that continue to evolve. Finally, for these same reasons, questions arise as to the COVID-19 risk to cancer patients undergoing surgical procedures.",

It is important to note, however, that the situation remains fluid, and continues to rapidly evolve as the pandemic evolves and resources dwindle.

In attendance at the virtual conference are medical oncologists, radiation oncologists, surgeons, gastroenterologists, interventional radiologists, and other providers (eg, residents, nurse practitioners, ward managers, etc.) with a vested interest in presented cases. The conference is open to all hospital affiliates including regional satellite facilities. The individual surgeon leads the clinical discussion with a radiologist providing the review of images, which are projected across the virtual main platform screen. A thorough discussion of alternative therapies, consequences of delay of surgery, and resource utilization ensues. The conversation is moderated by a senior member of the multidisciplinary team. Finally, the chief of the department or section makes the final decision as to approval or denial of each case based on the consensus recommendation from the multidisciplinary panel.",

This strategy increases objectivity, transparency, and consistency across all cases presented. In addition, the approach to cases is current, reflects resources at the hospital during that period of time, and may change on a week-to-week basis (eg, fluctuations in bed capacity and blood product availability). The multidisciplinary committee does not currently involve an ethics expert or subcommittee, although may benefit from inclusion of one in coming weeks as decisions become more difficult and resources become more limited.",
