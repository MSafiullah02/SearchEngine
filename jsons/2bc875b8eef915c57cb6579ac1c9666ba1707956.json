A prospective multicentre study was conducted to evaluate the immunogenicity of the inactivated influenza vaccine in children who have undergone HSCT compared with healthy agematched controls. Participants were vaccinated between 2013 and 2016 according to Australian guidelines. Influenzaspecific hemagglutinin inhibition antibody titres were performed prior to each vaccination and 4 weeks following the final vaccination. A nasopharyngeal aspirate for influenza was performed on participants that developed influenza-like illness. There were 86 children recruited; 43 who had undergone HSCT and 43 controls. For the HSCT group, seroprotection and seroconversion rates were 81.4% and 60.5% for H3N2, 41.9% and 32.6% for H1N1, and 44.2% and 39.5% for B strain respectively. There was a significant geometric mean fold increase to the H3N2 (GMFI 5.80, 95% CI 3.68-9.14, p < 0.001) and B (GMFI 3.44, 95% CI 2.36-5.00, p = 0.048) strains. Serological response was superior in age-matched controls to all vaccine strains. There were no serious adverse events following vaccination. For children who underwent HSCT, incidence of laboratory-proven influenza infection was 2.3%. Overall, this study provides evidence to support annual inactivated influenza vaccine administration to children following HSCT.",

In children, the incidence of influenza following allogeneic HSCT ranges between 0.9 and 9.9% [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] . Administration of one dose of the seasonal inactivated influenza vaccine is recommended for children commencing 6 months following HSCT. Children aged 6 months to 8 years who have never previously been vaccinated should receive two doses, 4 or more weeks apart [9, 10] . However, these recommendations are based on adult studies [10] , with a distinct paucity of paediatricspecific data assessing the immunogenicity of the inactivated influenza vaccine following HSCT [11] . Given the lack of evidence, we undertook a prospective multicentre study to evaluate the immunogenicity of the seasonal inactivated influenza vaccine in children who have undergone allogeneic HSCT compared with healthy matched controls, and to identify risk factors that predict vaccine response in this population.",

Following collection, blood samples were centrifuged and sera stored at \u221220\u00b0C. At the end of each influenza season, the samples were sent to the World Health Organization (WHO) Collaborating Centre for Reference and Research on Influenza, Victorian Infectious Diseases Reference Laboratory where standardised hemagglutinin inhibition (HI) assays were performed to determine specific influenza antibody titres towards each virus in the vaccine [13] . Viruses used for HI analysis were egg propagated; specifically for A(H1N1)pdm NYMC-X-179A Susceptibility to a vaccine-like strain was defined as a prevaccination HI titre of <40. Seroprotection in an individual was defined as a post vaccination HI titre of \u226540. Seroconversion was defined as either a fourfold increase in HI antibody titre if the prevaccination titre was \u226510 or a rise in HI titre from <10 to \u226540 following vaccination [14] . The percentage (95% confidence interval [CI]) of patients who individually met the criteria for seroprotection and seroconversion to each strain of the vaccine was calculated.",

            "text": "Influenza infection can result in significant morbidity and mortality following allogeneic HSCT [1] [2] [3] . Vaccination with inactivated influenza vaccine represents the main strategy to prevent infection. Several studies have been conducted to determine immunogenicity of the inactivated influenza vaccine in adults who have undergone HSCT, however, there is a distinct lack of paediatric-specific data [11] . Our study demonstrates that the inactivated influenza vaccine is safe and elicits a statistically significant serological response to H3N2 and B strains in children who have undergone allogeneic HSCT. However, serological response was limited in comparison with healthy agematched controls. The only study from which meaningful paediatric-specific data can be extrapolated for comparison between children who have undergone allogeneic HSCT is from a mixed paediatric-adult study [17] . In this study, seroconversion rates in 27 of the study participants under the age of 18 years were 59.3% for H3N2, 55.6% for H1N1 and 40.7% for B strain. Our current study shows comparable seroconversion rates to the H3N2 and B strains, but showed an inferior seroconversion rate to H1N1. There were notable differences between the H1N1 viruses tested in both of these studies as the Yalcin et al. [17] study was conducted over the 2007-2008 influenza season, when the previous seasonal influenza H1N1 vaccine was used, in comparison with our study, which used a post-2009 H1N1 pandemic influenza virus. The CPMP have defined criteria to assess whether influenza vaccines are effective within a population. Using these criteria, our study shows that the inactivated influenza vaccine can be considered immunologically effective against the H3N2 and B strains in children following allogeneic HSCT. For the H1N1 strain, statistical significance was not achieved according to GMFI criteria and the numerical thresholds of >70% for seroprotection and >40% for seroconversion were not attained. However, interpretation of these findings should also take into consideration that the CPMP criteria were defined based on applicability to immunocompetent populations, further emphasised by satisfaction of the criteria against all three strains in our agematched healthy control population. This highlights the need for revised definitions according to different populations, such as immunocompromised children.",

Haining et al. identified an increase in influenza A-specific CD4+ T-cell proliferation but no increase in influenza A-specific serum antibody levels in four children following vaccination with trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine 4-22 months following allogeneic HSCT [18] . Guerin-El Khourouj et al. identified a cellular proliferative response to H1N1 strain in 11 of 14 children following vaccination 76-336 days post allogeneic HSCT. H1N1 antibody titres were also measured in eight participants, with seroconversion only occurring in one patient following vaccination [19] . Although small numbers, both studies are important as they demonstrate that despite the absence of an influenza-specific antibody response, there was generation of an influenzaspecific T-cell response. This finding is supported by an adult study, which identified a strong cell-mediated immune response to a single dose of the trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine in 14 patients following allogeneic HSCT, despite a poor influenza-specific antibody response [20] . This further highlights the potential to consider alternative measures to determine vaccine efficacy in immunocompromised populations, in addition to those defined by the CPMP.",

Two studies with combined adult and paediatric populations have identified time from transplantation to vaccination as one of the strongest predictors of response to trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine following HSCT [21, 22] , with one of the studies also identifying absolute CD19 + cell counts as being predictive of response [22] . Although both studies were not able to identify a significant benefit for administration of two doses of the trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine compared with one dose [21, 22] , the benefit of a second vaccine dose has been demonstrated in several studies which have assessed response to the AS03-adjuvanted 2009 H1N1 vaccine in adults post HSCT [23] [24] [25] , while another study identified comparable response to two doses of the AS03-adjuvanted 2009 H1N1 vaccine in adults post allogeneic HSCT to a single dose received by healthy controls [26] . Transplant to vaccination interval [24, 26] , presence of graft versus host disease [26] , donor type [23] and receipt of immunosuppressive therapy [25] have all been shown to be predictive of response to the AS03-adjuvanted 2009 H1N1 vaccine within these studies. Although this is the largest paediatric study to assess immunogenicity of the inactivated influenza vaccine following allogeneic HSCT, greater patient numbers are required to further validate the variables that have been assessed and to identify whether additional variables, such as presence of graft versus host disease, receipt of immunosuppressive therapy, donor type and stem cell source, predict response to vaccination.",

Receipt of two doses of the inactivated influenza vaccine and a normal lymphocyte count at the time of vaccination were both predictive of response to the B strain, however larger global collaborative studies are required to validate these findings and investigate a greater number of predictive variables. A high proportion of children who received two vaccine doses and seroconverted, required the second dose of the vaccine for seroconversion to each strain.

Susceptibility of the healthy age-matched controls was 37% to H3N2, 70% to H1N1 and 79% to the B strain.

For children in the HSCT group who received two doses of the vaccine and seroconverted, the second dose of the vaccine was required for seroconversion to occur in 47% of patients to H3N2, 70% to H1N1 and 81% to B strain.According to CPMP criteria, children who had undergone allogeneic HSCT demonstrated a significant response to the H3N2 (GMFI 5.80, 95% CI 3.68-9.14, p < 0.001 and seroconversion 60.5%, 95% CI 45.9-75.1, p = 0.003) and B (GMFI 3.44, 95% CI 2.36-5.00, p = 0.048) strains (Table 2).
