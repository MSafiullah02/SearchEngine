This fusion protein is extended to a rod-like structure in response to an activating trigger. A hydrophobic \u03b1-helix fusion peptide at the N-terminus of the transmembrane subunit is exposed and able to penetrate into the membrane of the apposing cell. A second conformational change brings together two heptad repeats (HR1 and HR2) located downstream of the fusion peptide, to form a coiled-coil structure resulting in a stable hairpin conformation. Activated proteins of this Class share the common 6-helix bundle, which is the functional unit that causes the folding back of the fusion protein upon itself and leads to the close contacts between the viral and cellular membranes in order to allow lipid mixing [44].",

A second target for viral inhibition has proved to be the region forming coiled-coils through heptad repeat domains. It is generally accepted that fusion progresses by formation of an intermediate, a \u201cprehairpin\u201d conformation, that places the N-terminal fusion peptide near or in the target cell membrane, exposing the HR1 and HR2 regions [8]. In this intermediate, both HR are vulnerable to binding by synthetic peptides, which can thus inhibit viral infection by preventing formation of the fusogenic trimer-of-hairpins. HR2 peptides (Enfuvirtide), are potent inhibitors of HIV-1, active at low nanomolar concentration [32], [56]. A competitive interaction with the HR1 domain and prevention of the 6-helix bundle conformation has been proposed as the mechanism of inhibition [4]. It was recently found that a peptide corresponding to the C-proximal region of \u03b1-1-antitrypsin, designated VIRIP, inhibits a wide variety of HIV-1 strains, by interacting with the gp41 fusion peptide and preventing its insertion into the target cell membrane. These studies indicate that the fusion peptide domain is an attractive drug target [37].",

Titration of peptides (20 \u03bcM) in various percentages of TFE were performed as well as titration as a function of peptide concentration in buffer, TFE20% and lipids. Solutions of peptides (5\u201320\u201350\u2013100\u2013200 \u03bcM) were prepared in buffer, in TFE 20% and in lysophosphatydilcholine (LC) SUVs. Peptide samples in lipids were prepared using the following protocol [20]: all peptides were first dissolved in TFE; immediately after preparation, the peptide solution was added to an equal volume of a chloroform solution containing the appropriate lipid concentration; solutions were dried with a nitrogen gas stream and lyophilized overnight; the dry samples were rehydrated with deionized water to yield a final lipid concentration of 0.9 mM. Small unilamellar vesicles (SUV) of lysophosphatydilcholine (LC) were prepared from MLVs by sonication. The spectra are an average of three consecutive scans from 260 to 195 nm, recorded with a band width of 3 nm, a time constant of 16 s and a scan rate of 10 nm/min. Spectra were recorded and corrected for the blank. Mean residues ellipticities (MRE) were calculated using the equation Obsd/lcn where Obsd is the ellipticities measured in millidegrees, l is the length of the cell in cm, c is the peptide concentration in mol/l, and n is the number of amino acid residues in the peptide.

Six regions of high interfacial hydrophobicity were identified using MpeX [55], [59], four of them proved to be capable of inducing fusion of liposomes in vitro. In particular, peptides gH220\u2013262, gH381\u2013420, and gH626\u2013644 were the most active and play a fundamental role in the fusion process. Peptide gH493\u2013537 although not being very active alone was shown to have a cooperative fusogenic effect when used in combination with the other active peptides [13]. This peptide (gH493\u2013537) corresponds to the region comprised between the two HR domains of gH, and a shorter sequence of its C-terminus, namely gH513\u2013531, showed an increased ability to induce fusion of lipid vesicles [17]. The secondary structure prediction reveals that the region from residue 493 to 537 is composed of two helices separated by a kink at residue Pro513, thus the two helices may have a different function in the fusion mechanism. We thus decided to synthesize the sequence from 493 to 512 (Fig. 1\n), and to test it in fusion and inhibition experiments.",

A population of LUVs labeled with both NBD-PE and Rho-PE was mixed with a population of unlabeled LUVs and increasing amounts of peptides were added. Fusion between the labeled and unlabeled vesicles caused by the peptides results in dilution of the labeled lipids and therefore reduced energy transfer between NBD-PE and Rho-PE, visualized as an increase of NBD fluorescence. The dependence of the extent of lipid mixing on the peptide to lipid molar ratio was analyzed. The fusion experiment has been performed on the gH493\u2013512 peptide in order to determine its ability to induce fusion.

            "text": "The titration of gH626\u2013644 as a function of TFE (Fig. 4A), showed that already in the presence of 20% TFE, the peptide adopts an \u03b1-helical conformation. The ratio of the ellipticities at 222 and 208 nm can be utilized to distinguish between monomeric and oligomeric states of helices [33]; when the ratio \u03b8222/\u03b8208 equals about 0.8, the peptide is in its monomeric state, and when the ratio exceeds the value of 1.0 is in its oligomeric state. The data reveal that in presence of 20% TFE gH626\u2013644 adopts an \u03b1-helical conformation with the monomer/oligomer equilibrium shifted toward the oligomeric state with a ratio \u03b8222/\u03b8208 of approximately 1.05, while at higher percentages of TFE the ratio decreases to 0.76 indicating a monomeric state. Lau et al. [29] have previously shown that TFE 50% disrupts the quaternary structure of \u03b1-helices, i.e. TFE is a denaturant of tertiary and quaternary structure stabilized by hydrophobic interactions. We thus assayed the secondary structure dependence from the concentration in a solution containing 20% TFE, a condition in which gH626\u2013644 showed the presence of oligomeric species (Fig. 4A). In 20% TFE, the peptide gH626\u2013644 revealed a characteristic \u03b1-helix spectrum, with an ellipticity strongly dependent on concentration, suggesting the formation of aggregates (Fig. 5A). We concluded, however, that the aggregates were molecular in size because centrifugation, which removes precipitated hydrophobic peptides from solution, had no effect on the spectra. Furthermore, a strong concentration dependence of the helicity would not be expected for macroscopic aggregates. From the ellipticity at 222 nm, we estimated helicities of about 19% at 5 \u03bcM and of about 36% for 50 \u03bcM, at higher concentration it starts to diminish and at 200 \u03bcM is approximately 31%. The data reveal values of \u03b8222/\u03b8208 always around 1 indicating that the peptide is always in its oligomeric state. The same analysis were performed on gH493\u2013512. The titration of gH493\u2013512 as a function of TFE (Fig. 4B), showed that in 20% TFE, the peptide adopts an \u03b1-helical conformation, with a percentage of helix of 19%; the ratio of the ellipticities at 222 and 208 nm reveals that at this percentage of TFE, the peptide is in its oligomeric state with a ratio \u03b8222/\u03b8208 of approximately 1.00, while at higher percentages of TFE the ratio is approximately 0.80 indicating a monomeric state. In 20% TFE (Fig. 5B), also the peptide gH493\u2013512 revealed a characteristic \u03b1-helix spectrum, with an ellipticity strongly dependent on concentration, suggesting the formation of aggregates. As for gH626\u2013644, we believe that the aggregates were molecular in size because centrifugation had no effect on the spectra. From the ellipticity at 222 nm, we estimated helicities of about 18% at 5 \u03bcM and of about 35% for 100 \u03bcM, at 200 \u03bcM decreases to approximately 25%. A similar behaviour with a sudden fall in molecular ellipticity was previously observed for aggregating peptides [5]. Moreover, the two peptides show a similar tendency to associate and produce molecular aggregates of helices but the critical concentration differs for the two peptides, in particular the maximum ellipticity was observed at 50 \u03bcM for gH626\u2013644 and at 100 \u03bcM for gH493\u2013512, indicating a greater tendency of gH626\u2013644 to aggregate (Fig. 5).",

SDS has been used previously to determine the aggregation state of membrane proteins [46] and fusion peptides [27]. The analysis of the band pattern of each peptide in absence or presence of SDS enabled us to better understand the oligomerization profile. The NATIVE-PAGE without SDS and with 4 mM and 5 mM SDS reveals that both peptides oligomerize but gH626\u2013644 forms higher order oligomers compared to gH493\u2013512 (Fig. 6). In absence of SDS gH626\u2013644 (lane 2) presents one band at very high molecular weight approximately between 49 and 62 kDa and gH493\u2013512 (lane 5) present one main band between 15 and 28 kDa and a small band at higher molecular weight. The presence of SDS 5 mM (lanes 4 and 7) is enough to induce partially the dissociation of oligomers for both peptides.

Its ability to induce membrane fusion parallel recent results reported on HIV gp41 loop domain [39]. The peptide gH493\u2013537 and principally its shorter analog gH493\u2013512 are also able to inhibit the entry of HSV-1. Interestingly, it was recently reported [17] that deletion of the C-terminus of gH493\u2013537, from a 513 to aa 531, and its replacement with heterologous fusion peptides in a sense or antisense direction, decreases infection to less than 10% relative to wt-gH and almost abolished cell\u2013cell fusion. A synthetic peptide corresponding to gH513\u2013531 is able to induce fusion of lipid vesicles more effectively than gH493\u2013512, even though the results of fusion percentages cannot be precisely compared due to different experimental conditions; and is also able to increase virus infection and cell\u2013cell fusion. The present study, which has investigated sequences gH493\u2013537 and gH493\u2013512, indicate that gH493\u2013537 is able to induce liposome fusion only in combination with the other three fusogenic domains, while both gH493\u2013537 and gH493\u2013512 alone are unable to significantly induce liposome fusion. The present results together with available data on gH513\u2013531 [17], seem to support the hypothesis that only the C-terminus of this domain is involved in fusion; on the contrary the sequence gH493\u2013512 is unable to induce liposome fusion but strongly inhibits virus infection. The analysis of the secondary structure prediction of protein gH indicates that the domain gH493\u2013537 may adopt an \u03b1-helical structure with a kink at the proline 513; moreover there are other two proline residues (proline 529 and 535) toward the C-terminus, which are usually present in sequences interacting with membranes, further supporting the hypothesis that the C terminus may be involved in membrane fusion.",

Since the peptides self-associate in aqueous and lipidic solutions, it is possible that they bind to their counterparts in the HSV-1 gH fusion protein, thus suggesting that the inhibition of viral entry may occur via peptides association with their counterpart on wild-type gH. The main difference between the active peptides analyzed, is that gH626\u2013644 may more intimately interact with the host cell membrane, therefore its ability to partially inhibit viral entry, when cells are treated first, is dependent on the possibility that the virus will find a modified cell membrane still exhibiting on its surface the peptide.

(B) Cells were exposed to active peptides at a concentration of 250 \u03bcM either prior to infection (cells pre-exposure), during attachment and entry (co-exposure), after virus penetration (post-exposure), or alternatively, the virus was pre-incubated with peptides for 1 h at 37 \u00b0C before addition to the cells (virus preincubation). (C) Cells were exposed to active peptides (gH493\u2013512 and gH626\u2013644) at a concentration of 250 and 500 \u03bcM and PIV-2 in the co-exposure mode. For all treatments, non-penetrated viruses were inactivated by low-pH citrate buffer after the 45 min incubation with cells at 37 \u00b0C. The cells were then, incubated for 48 h at 37 \u00b0C in DMEM supplemented with CMC and plaque numbers were scored. Experiments were performed in triplicate and the percentage of inhibition was calculated with respect to no-peptide control experiments. Error bars represent standard deviations.",
