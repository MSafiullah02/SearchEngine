As such, it becomes critical to take into consideration several factors for viral diagnosis ranging from the type and quality of specimen collected, time of specimen collection, mode of transport, accuracy, specificity, sensitivity, and the type of diagnostic method used.

Immunofluorescence assay is extensively used for rapid identification of virus infections through detection of virus antigen or virus-specific antibodies in clinical specimens. Viral diagnosis is a crucial revolution and renders more accessible and makes it potential to standardize the recently developed diagnostic methods. Serology essentially comprises bulk of work of any virology laboratory.

Then after, introduction of ELISA then revolutionized viral diagnosis by simplifying detection and shortening the time (Torrance and Jones 1981) . Molecular diagnostic tools for viral diagnosis has trialed speedy advancements in last few years (Hayden and Persing 2001) , and revolutionized diagnosis of infectious diseases, particularly viral diseases. The use of amplification techniques, viz. PCR, RT-PCR, or NASBA (nucleic acid sequence-based amplification) (Van Belkum and Niesters 1995) for detection of virus, genotyping, and quantification have several advantages such as high reproducibility and sensitivity, including broad dynamic range (Ebner et al. 2005 (Ebner et al. , 2006 .

For that reason, in modern years, role of TEM in diagnosis of anonymous infectious agents in specific viral outbreaks or transmission clusters shifted from regular use to an initial screening test. TEM is also considered an important method for assessment of viral safety in biopharmaceutical products. Application of TEM understands the unknown viruses for which there is an imminent risk of contamination, and TEM will undeniably be functional for documenting the subsistence of viruses or virus-like particles in these cells and the products derivative from them (Roingeard et al. 2019 ).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 964, "end": 986, "text": "(Roingeard et al. 2019", "ref_id": "BIBREF40"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Microscopy"}, {"text": "The immunoassays are primarily antibody/antigen dependent assays.

As a part of modern research on immunotechniques, a diagnostic approach for chronic hepatitis C infection (CHC), detects specific antibody to HCV (anti-HCV) (indirect tests) and assays that can detect, quantify, or characterize components of HCV viral particles, viz. HCV RNA and core antigen (direct tests). Quantification of HCV core antigen (cAg) as a one-step procedure has been indispensable. Hence, in order to evaluate the performance of cAg quantification in diagnosing CHC and how it is predisposed by concomitant HIV or HBV infections, cross-sectional validation assays, i.e., HCV Ag quantification as a one-step procedure in diagnosing CHC in Cameroon was designed to abridge the diagnostic process (Duchesne et al. 2017) .

Interestingly this serologic assay needs to be employed in rapid clinical diagnosis of ZIKV and/or dengue virus infections for screening immune responses in vaccine trials (Wong et al. 2017) . It is noteworthy that oral fluid is a noninvasive biospecimen that can harbor pathogen-specific antibodies and reach potential to replace blood-based testing protocols. Therefore, a saliva-based oral fluid immunoassay was developed to assess past and recent hepatitis E virus (HEV) infections from noninvasive sampling methods.

This test might employ for clinical diagnosis, clinical trials, and confirmation and seroprevalence studies of ZIKV infection (Koishi et al. 2018) . In one of the recent studies, detection of serum HEV antigen (Ag) is deemed to be sensitive and promising biomarker for HEV antigen diagnosis with HEV RNA in both acute and chronic genotypes. Strikingly an antigen assay was recently evaluated for diagnosing HEV genotypes with higher sensitivity than commercial anti-HEV IgM and HEV RNA ELISA tests (Zhang et al. 2019) . Nonetheless, recent studies on respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) developed Luciferase Immunoprecipitation Systems (LIPS) assay to detect IgG Antibodies against Human RSV G-Glycoprotein. Moreover, Human RSV G-Glycoprotein also acts as biomarker for natural exposure or immunization. RSV genes encoding native and mutated G (mG) proteins from subgroups A and B strains were cloned, expressed as luciferase-tagged proteins, and experimented separately to spot anti-RSV-G specific IgG antibodies employing a high-throughput luciferase immunoprecipitation system (LIPS-G).

This assay was found useful in patients with high risk of ZIKA complications, viz. pregnant women and monitoring immune responses in vaccine trials (Furuya et al. 2019 ). Consecutively to develop serological diagnosis of ZIKV-IgA and ZIKV-IgG, avidity assays were evaluated to characterize ZIKA infections in want of viremia. These assay facilitated construed low avidity of IgG and IgA results, enhanced the serological diagnosis of ZIKV (Amaro et al. 2019) . In another study, homologous proteins of diverse flaviviruses exhibited high degrees of sequence uniqueness, mainly within subgroups. This led to prevalent immunological cross-reactivity. Therefore, a proportional deconvolution of complex B cell responses against ZIKV and other flavivirus were deliberated by screening with a microarray chip-based high-resolution serological analysis primed from overlapping peptides covering the whole amino acid sequence of ZIKV genomic polyprotein was developed.

This novel antibody demonstrates noteworthy specificity to identify H7N9 virus compared to homemade target-captured ELISA, qRT-PCR, and rapid influenza diagnostic test (RIDT) with high sensitivity (Chang et al. 2018) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 413, "end": 433, "text": "(Kaushik et al. 2018", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 901, "end": 920, "text": "(Afsahi et al. 2018", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 1487, "end": 1506, "text": "(Chang et al. 2018)", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Immunosensors-Based Immunodetection"}, {"text": "In a recent study, sandwich-type electrochemiluminescence (ECL) immunosensor was developed for ultrasensitive determination of HBV surface antigen.

Then, the PAMAM dendrimer with many amine functional groups was employed as carrier for immobilizing CdTe@CdS quantum dots (QDs) and the secondary antibody (Ab 2 ) amplified ECL signal of QDs considerably improved sensitivity. Strikingly, this ECL sensor was designed based on signal amplification with dendrimer-quantum dots structures (Babamiri et al. 2018) . In another study, hemagglutinin (HA), a glycoprotein present on the surface of influenza A subtype virus H1N1, virus binds to human cells with sialic acid on membrane of upper respiratory tract. For early detection of swine flu (H1N1) infection in human, an impedimetric hemagglutinin gene-based biosensor was developed by immobilizing amino-labeled single-stranded DNA probe onto cysteine modified gold surface of the screen printed electrode for early and rapid detection of H1N1 (swine flu) in human (Mohan et al. 2019 ).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 603, "end": 625, "text": "(Babamiri et al. 2018)", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 1131, "end": 1149, "text": "(Mohan et al. 2019", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Immunosensors-Based Immunodetection"}, {"text": "Microfluidic technique permitted research of viral measurement of fusion kinetics, viral infectivity, and screening of viral responses to neutralizing molecules.

A recent study investigating the use of an integrated microfluidic system for diagnostics utilized aptamers against IAV (H1N1) for viral detection (Tsang et al. 2016 ) was studied.

CRISPR/cas9 is the latest and unique RNA targeted gene therapy successfully applied in 2007 and observed in Staphylococcus pneumonia. The CRISPR is RNA sequence repeats which targets the foreign DNA cleavage by binding to the PAM flanking sequences which mediates the endonuclease called Cas through guide RNA (g-RNA) and responsible for the double strand breaks in the host or foreign DNA and silences the gene expression by nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ). There are different kinds which are mediated by different cas proteins. Notably like class 2, type II has cas9 where g-RNA complements cas protein and other system, eventually class II and type V complements with cas12a and the CRISPR codes crRNA acts as guide RNA by complementing the type V cas 12 protein complex. There are other 29 CRISPER/cas systems that were identified (Makarova et al. 2015) . The application of CRISPR/CAS in viral diagnostics makes a breakthrough and it increased specificity. The type V CRISPR-CAS12a is used for the detection of the viral DNA. The CAS12a is designed specific to the viral DNA. The ssDNA is tagged with a Reporter which has fluorophore and quencher on both ends. The cleavage activity of viral DNA by cas12a confers the cleavage of the ssDNA. As a result flourophore reporter, the cleavage of ssDNA emits the fluorescence which is detected by quenchers and further amplified by recombinase polymerase PCR. The technique was characterized by DETECTR. There are other methods like SHERLOCK (Gootenberg et al. 2018 ) which works consiently based on the Cas13 system.

An automated POC system for EBV detection with RNA-guided RNA endonuclease Cas13a, employing its collateral RNA degradation subsequent to its activation was recently developed by Qin and colleagues.
