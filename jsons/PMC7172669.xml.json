However, there is growing evidence that some proteins can couple binding energy to RNA duplex destabilization, formally behaving as helicases without ATP hydrolysis. For example, the eukaryotic exosome threads single-stranded RNA through its central ring, unwinding RNA without ATP hydrolysis [8]. One can imagine that the ring-like Ro autoantigen might have similar properties [9].",

            "text": "However, hexameric rings are one of the most common types of nucleic acid unwinding motors that encircle single-stranded RNA and strip away complementary strands in an ATP-dependent fashion [10, 11]. The best-studied example is the Rho transcription termination factor, which has been visualized crystallographically in complex with ATP analogs and an RNA translocation substrate [12\u2022\u2022] (Figure 1\n). These structures show that the protein subunits wrap around the RNA strand like \u2018spiral staircase\u2019. Each subunit projects a loop into the center of the ring, which captures and engages functional groups on the ribose moiety. The relative RNA engagement of each protein subunit is directly coupled to its ATP hydrolysis state, suggesting that each subunit takes its turn at the leading edge of travel, pulling RNA through the ring and moving the protein in a 5\u2032 \u2192 3\u2032 direction. Remarkably, the papillomavirus E1 ring helicase pulls DNA through its central ring in the opposite direction [13], appearing to tug on the backbone with loops in the opposite orientation.",

Chemogenetic and kinetic methods have shown that some positions along the sugar-phosphate backbone are more important than others. While one might expect that each 2\u2032-hydroxyl group is recognized in the same way by Rho, the functional analysis indicates that every seventh 2\u2032-hydroxyl group plays a particularly important role in the mechanism [14\u2022]. This suggests that future research on Rho may reveal additional events along the translocation pathway or different types of engagement between protein and RNA than has been visualized to date.",

            "text": "It is often thought that nonhexameric RNA helicases lack the processivity of their phylogenetically related counterparts, the SF1 and SF2 DNA helicases. However, a subset of RNA helicases unwinds RNA in a highly processive manner [6]. Phylogenetically, these are often SF2 helicases that contain the DExH signature in conserved Motif II and which lack the \u2018Q\u2019 motif that typifies their DEAD-box cousins [15]. Structurally, all these enzymes contain a fundamental motor unit (Domains 1 and 2) composed of two RecA-like domains that hydrolyze ATP and bind RNA using conserved amino acids at the domain interface (Motifs I\u2013VI) [15]. But they also contain additional domains [16\u2022\u2022], such as Domain 3 in Flaviviral helicases. Accessory domains can rigidify the relative position of Domains 1 and 2, perching atop the RNA-binding cleft and providing an extensive RNA interface [6]. Biologically, these proteins have a range of function, including roles in RNA surveillance and decay, as illustrated by new structural work on the Mtr4 helicase [16\u2022\u2022]. Some of the most well-studied examples derive from viral systems for replication or transcription. For example, the Dengue [17\u2022\u2022, 18] and Hepatitis C NS3 proteins [19\u2022\u2022, 20\u2022\u2022, 21] and the vaccinia NPH-II proteins [22] have been the subject of intensive structural and mechanistic investigation [6, 7]. Processive RNA helicases from other systems, such as coronaviruses [23], provide rich areas for future investigation.",

Upf1 is phylogenetically classified as an SF1 helicase (like UvrD or Rep), but it unwinds RNA in a cofactor-dependent fashion [25]. Its additional allosteric \u2018RNA clasping\u2019 domains (1B and CH, in this case) can open and shut, engaging and disengaging from the RNA-binding cleft and thereby controlling helicase behavior [26\u2022\u2022] (Figure 2\n). The \u2018on\u2013off switch\u2019 [24], that controls dynamics of the cleft is a regulatory protein called Upf2, which binds Upf1 and modulates its function [26\u2022\u2022, 27]. Thus, the accessory domains of Upf1 have multiple conformations that permit control of translocation and helicase activity by cofactor proteins.",

By crystallizing full-length NS3 in the presence of bound RNA and an ATP analog, these studies show that Domains 1 and 2 open and close in response to ATP binding, and that RNA translocates by one nucleotide in the process. Consistent with its role in the formation of the RNA-binding cleft, Domain 3 clamps down in response to RNA binding. Similarly, a series of structures capturing a shortened NS3 helicase construct in the presence of ATP and DNA suggest a single nucleotide step for ATP-dependent translocation [20\u2022\u2022]. Despite these similarities, there are important differences in NS3 conformation when RNA (the natural substrate) is bound [19\u2022\u2022]. For example, conserved residue Thr416, which has long been implicated in translocation of SF2 proteins, is only engaged with the phosphate backbone in the structure containing RNA [19\u2022\u2022]. Both these studies are consistent with single molecule investigations of ATP-dependent translocation by NS3 [28].",

            "text": "While translocation of RNA helicases appears to be largely explained from structural and biochemical experimentation, the actual mechanism of unwinding remains an area of intense investigation. Single molecule experiments on HCV NS3 show that strand separation does not take place in one base-pair steps, but in larger units of at least three base pairs [28, 29]. Kinetic studies indicate that the rate constant for unwinding of each three base-pair step corresponds to the rate constant for phosphate release after ATP hydrolysis, suggesting that phosphate release is the power stroke for duplex unwinding [30\u2022\u2022]. The release of top-strand RNA occurs in even larger steps of at least 10 base pairs [29, 31, 32]. There is not yet a clear physical understanding of these behaviors, which may be linked to the function of other domains appended to the helicase.",

            "text": "The NS3 proteins from Flaviviral and Hepaciviral replication complexes contain a fourth domain that plays a role in helicase function of these enzymes [6]. This domain is a serine protease, and in the case of HCV NS3, it plays a major role in RNA binding and stepping behavior [33\u2022\u2022, 34]. A structural basis for this remained unclear until the crystal structures of the Dengue and West Nile NS3 proteins revealed that the protease domain swings beneath the D1 and D2 ATPase domains [17\u2022\u2022, 18, 35], in a location that can readily influence ATPase and unwinding functions (Figure 3\n). Biophysical studies on the full-length HCV NS3 protein suggest that a similar conformation also occurs in HCV NS3, and that it is required for unwinding of RNA [36\u2022\u2022]. Intriguingly, crystallographic investigations of full-length HCV NS3 depict the protease domain in a different position, packed against the back of D1\u20133 [19\u2022\u2022, 37]. This enclosed structural state is also biologically relevant and it represents the conformation required for autoproteolysis [36\u2022\u2022]. Thus, HCV NS3 has at least two distinct conformational forms, which may allow it to toggle between its dual roles in proteolysis and helicase activity, and potentially regulate viral function.",

These proteins contain a minimal ATPase motor consisting only of Domains 1 and 2, which is mechanically coupled to a diversity of other protein substructures. Domains 1 and 2 are loosely connected until the binding of ligands (RNA, small molecules or other proteins) brings them together and forms an ATP-binding cleft at their interface. Structural studies show that the ATP-binding cleft is deeply buried within DEAD-box proteins [39], suggesting particularly tight coupling of ATP hydrolysis with mechanical work. This effect may be accentuated by the presence of the \u2018Q-motif\u2019, which is an ATP-binding site unique to DEAD-box proteins that allows for total specificity for ATP rather than other nucleotide triphosphates [38].",

In some cases, small molecules or bound proteins also stimulate RNA release [44\u2022\u2022]. Studies of the DbpA protein have provided insights into the coupling between ATP hydrolysis and RNA unwinding [48\u2022\u2022]. DbpA maintains high affinity for RNA in the ATP-bound state and RNA duplex destabilization occurs upon ATP hydrolysis, as the protein enters the ADP.Pi state. Release of Pi causes displacement of the protein from the RNA strand, allowing one round of unwinding a short duplex. It is important to note, however, that single-strand translocation by DEAD-box proteins has not yet been directly investigated. It is entirely possible that there are functions of these proteins (such as translocation) where the protein is not completely released from the lattice during a cycle of ATP hydrolysis and where a cycle of weak and strong binding may instead propel unidirectional motion, as in cytoskeletal motor proteins.",

            "text": "During the process of RNA folding in vivo [42\u2022\u2022], proteins assist in the destabilization of misfolded intermediates and in the stabilization of weak folding intermediates. Many of these proteins are DEAD-box proteins [43], and Mss116 is a well-studied example [42\u2022\u2022]. Mss116 is known to stimulate group II intron self-splicing in vivo [51], and it can enable certain group II introns to self-splice in vitro under physiological ionic conditions [52]. Like many DEAD-box proteins, Mss116 is capable of unwinding short RNA duplexes [46\u2022\u2022, 52, 53], however, studies of Mss116 mutants in vivo and in vitro show that its role in splicing is not necessarily dependent on helicase activity [52, 54\u2022]. Ensemble and single molecule experiments [55\u2022\u2022, 56], along with folding studies conducted in vivo [42\u2022\u2022], show that Mss116 stabilizes an RNA folding intermediate that is required along the pathway to group II intron assembly. ATP hydrolysis is required only during the rapid final stage of intron folding, suggesting that protein release is required for consolidation of the catalytic domains and for turnover of the protein [55\u2022\u2022, 56]. Thus, certain DEAD-box proteins may serve as stabilizing RNA-binding proteins, rather than destabilizing helicases. Unlike many other types of RNA-binding proteins, DEAD-box proteins are readily \u2018removable\u2019 in a controlled fashion, as ATP hydrolysis stimulates their release from RNA.",
