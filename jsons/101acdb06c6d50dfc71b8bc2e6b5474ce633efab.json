It can be quite difficult for a primary care physician to distinguish between simple upper respiratory infections (URI), episodes of acute viral rhinosinusitis (AVRS), and episodes of true bacterial rhinosinusitis (ABRS). Almost 90% of patients with viral URIs have evidence of AVRS [9] . The most common viruses that cause VRS are rhinovirus, influenza virus, and coronavirus; others include parainfluenza virus, adenovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, and metapneumovirus [10] . Patients with AVRS typically develop symptoms 1-4 days after infection. Viruses attach to the nasal epithelium and can spread from the nasal cavity to the paranasal sinuses. Once within the paranasal sinuses, viruses may exert direct toxic effects on mucociliary clearance, and may induce epithelial permeability and hypersecretion from inflammatory cytokines. These alterations lead to the mucosal edema, thickened secretions, and ostial obstruction characteristic of acute rhinosinusitis.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 93, "end": 96, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 382, "end": 385, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 574, "end": 578, "text": "[10]", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Pathophysiology"}, {"text": "Acute bacterial rhinosinusitis most commonly occurs as a complication of viral infection, complicating 0.5-2.0% of cases of the common cold [10] , However, other factors may also predispose to ABRS, such as allergy, immune dysfunction, impaired ciliary function, anatomic narrowing of the sinuses, or poor dentition [11] . The most common bacteria associated with ABRS are Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis. Microaerophilic streptococci and anaerobic bacteria are commonly identified if the ABRS originates from an odontogenic source. When a sinus culture is positive in a patient with ABRS, a single pathogen is usually found in high concentration, although in approximately 25% of the patients, two pathogens can be found in high concentration [12] . The usefulness and validity of sinus cultures have recently been reconsidered as more is understood about the complex commensal bacterial community comprising the sinus microbiome.

These symptoms apply to both AVRS and ABRS. Therefore, it is not possible for patients nor clinicians to discern a viral from bacterial infection based on symptoms alone. Another diagnostic fallacy is that if nasal drainage is colored it must be from a bacterial infection [2] . To discern AVRS from ABRS, the clinician should focus on the duration and course of the symptoms. Acute viral rhinosinusitis will typically have partial or complete resolution of symptoms by 10 days, with a peak at 3-6 days [15] .

The Chandler classification, the most common method of characterizing orbital complications, organizes orbital complications in terms of progressive severity (see Fig. 11 .1) [18] . Infection in preseptal cellulitis involves the eyelid skin in front of the orbital septum and tarsal plates of the eyelids, while infection in orbital cellulitis, subperiosteal abscess, and orbital abscess involves the orbit. In orbital cellulitis, there is diffuse inflammation of the orbital fat and extraocular muscles. In subperiosteal abscess, there is a collection of pus in the space between the orbital bony wall and periorbita, and in orbital abscess, there is a collection of pus in the orbital fat. It is important to distinguish preseptal cellulitis from orbital infection (cellulitis or abscess), because preseptal infections do not threaten vision while orbital infections do. Patients with preseptal cellulitis will present with lid swelling and redness of the periorbital region but will not have involvement of the orbit (postseptal compartment) so will not have any of the three \"orbital signs\": impaired extraocular motility, decrease in vision, or proptosis. Patients with orbital cellulitis or abscess will present with similar lid changes, but in addition will have one or more orbital signs as a result inflammation of the extraocular muscles and fat within the orbit. Patients with orbital cellulitis or abscess may also have chemosis (edema of the conjunctiva), pain with eye movement, and/or diplopia. In general, patients with subperiosteal or orbital abscess have more pronounced orbital signs than those with orbital cellulitis. Because most sinogenic orbital abscesses arise from the ethmoid or medial frontal sinuses, the inflammation in the orbit is often most pronounced medially and/or superomedially, and the eye may be displaced inferolaterally. Patients with chronic sinus obstruction with nasal polyps may develop a frontal sinus mucocele that silently erodes the frontal sinus floor (orbital roof); an acute superinfection may cause orbital cellulitis or abscess ( Fig. 11 .2). Cavernous sinus thrombophlebitis can sometimes be insidious, but advanced cases will be marked by cranial nerve palsies involving III, IV, VI (sometimes also V1 and V2), fever, photophobia, visual loss, and signs of contralateral orbital involvement.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 325, "end": 329, "text": "[18]", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 313, "end": 320, "text": "Fig. 11", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}, {"start": 2236, "end": 2243, "text": "Fig. 11", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}], "section": "Complications"}, {"text": "Acute bacterial rhinosinusitis may also lead to CNS infections, including meningitis, epidural abscess, subdural empyema, or brain abscess.

While preseptal cellulitis alone may respond to oral antibiotics, patients with any other orbital or any CNS complication require intravenous antibiotics, close inpatient monitoring, and may require emergency surgery to drain an abscess if one is present. An ophthalmologist should be consulted for patients with orbital complications, and consultation with a neurologist or neurosurgeon is usually indicated for patients with CNS complications.

In the first 10 days of symptoms, supportive therapy alone is indicated for uncomplicated ABRS in adults regardless of whether a diagnosis of AVRS or ABRS has been made, except for cases of \"double worsening\" or severe symptoms persisting for at least 3 days. Severe symptoms are defined as high fever (temperature 102 \u00b0F or higher) and purulent nasal drainage [19, 22] . \"Double worsening\" refers to worsening of symptoms after initial improvement.

Metaanalyses of randomized controlled trials have found that, compared with placebo, adults with ABRS may benefit from antibiotics at the cost of increased adverse events. Estimates of the number needed to treat to benefit range from 13 to 18 patients, while the number needed to harm is approximately eight patients [24] . The clinician should consider that results of these metaanalyses may be influenced by inclusion and exclusion criteria. The 2014 Cochrane review analyzed ten trials that randomized antibiotics versus placebo to treat adults with clinically diagnosed ABRS [23] , but many of these trials did not meet current criteria for ABRS so probably included AVRS as well as ABRS. For example, some trials included patients with only 5 or even 2 days of symptoms [25] .

There is not good evidence to guide the choice of second-line therapy, but one may consider either increasing the dose or changing class of antibiotics. Options in adults include high dose amoxicillin (2 g twice daily) with clavulanate, doxycycline, levofloxacin, and moxifloxacin.
