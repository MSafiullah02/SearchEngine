The efficiency of FRSMs against inert airborne particles is greatly reduced compared to respirators. 4. Live, infectious virus was extracted in enumerable quantities from the air from behind all the surgical masks tested. This suggests that influenza virus can survive in aerosol particles and bypass/penetrate a surgical mask and that a residual infectious aerosol hazard may exist. 5. Surgical masks provide a 6-fold reduction in exposure to live, infectious Influenza A virus. By contrast, properly fitted respirators provide at least a 100-fold reduction.

The other 15% wore N95.There is no evidence that N95 is superior to FRSM.Case report. 1. All patients were swabbed on the same day, ranging from 1-5 days after last exposure to the patient. 2. Methodology is poorly reported. Retrospective study design. Small study -only 41 participants with exposure to one single COVID-19 patient. No power calculation. 3. Definition of 'exposure' was an AGP of at least 10 minutes, within 2 metres of the patient. 6. Conclusion is not based on the results-no evidence to suggest N95 superior to surgical mask does not infer that a N95 and FRSM have the same efficacy. 2004.28",
