The biggest challenge in these studies, including ours, is the interpretation of multi-pathogen detection, particularly when trying to attribute a specific pathogen as the cause of an episode of ALRI. Many bacterial pathogens detected from respiratory specimens could reflect carriage, being part of the normal microbiome, and not necessarily associated with the disease process. Similarly, viral pathogens detected in respiratory samples could indicate recent past infections. The early C T values from the upper tract could indicate higher pathogen load and be associated with pneumonia 15 , which would suggest that NP/OP swabs could be used when investigating lower ALRI etiology if interpretation is combined with C T values. However, establishing causality can be challenging even when considering organism density (here we used C T values as proxy).
