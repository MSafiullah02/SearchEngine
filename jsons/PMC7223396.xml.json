Only one recent study provided an estimate of the incidence of NV-ICUAP of 4.5 per 1000 patient-ICU-days as compared to an incidence of VAP of 21 per 1000 invasive mechanical ventilation days [4] (Fig. 1). The mechanisms by which the microorganisms may enter into the respiratory tract are multifactorial via a direct colonization from the oropharynx, via aspiration of the gastric flora, or via haematological dissemination from distant septic foci. Depressed consciousness with micro-aspiration, lack of cough reflex with an effective cough and alteration in gastric motility are the most likely mechanisms of colonization of the lower respiratory tract (Fig. 1). Delayed intubation due to prolonged use of non-invasive ventilation and high-flow oxygenation may increase the risk of intubation-related complications and subsequent ICU-HAP in some patients [5].\n",

            "text": "Another important problem is to determine the aetiology in NV-ICUAP patients. Previous studies have shown that distal quantitative samples (collected prior to starting any antibiotic treatment) in patients with suspected VAP improved the accuracy of the results and reduced antibiotic exposure [1]. However, in the vast majority of non-ventilated patients, this approach is often feasible. For them, two diagnostic strategies remain: (1) non-invasive samplings with immediate empirical antibiotic treatment and (2) protected brush sampling of specimens. Both strategies have been compared in a randomized single-centre study in patients with HAP not admitted to an ICU. Whilst both approaches had similar mortality rates and overall management costs, the cost for antibiotic treatment was lower in the brush sampling group [11]. In addition, the invasive approach appeared to carry a lower risk of immunosuppressed patients with acute respiratory failure (ARF) if performed in ICU under appropriate surveillance, oxygenation, and non-invasive ventilation (when required) [12]. Under these conditions, the invasive strategy can lead to a more accurate aetiology and to improving the implementation of targeted therapy in non-ventilated immunocompromised patients with pulmonary infiltrates (not necessarily pneumonia) [12]. However, it remains unclear whether invasive approaches are associated with improvements in patient outcomes in NV-ICUAP. The 2016 Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) and the American Thoracic Society (ATS) guidelines recommended non-invasive respiratory sampling in patient with suspicion of HAP, although the panel agreed that there may be risk factors that prompt clinicians to consider invasive sampling [2]. Ranzani et al. compared different diagnostic approaches used in different ICU-HAP cohorts and highlighted the utility of sputum and distal sampling in HAP [8]. In fact, sputum sampling was responsible for one-third of the final aetiology diagnosed in HAP patients who were not subsequently intubated. It is unclear whether invasive approaches [e.g. bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL)] are associated with an improvement in patients\u2019 outcomes, and further research is needed to ensure their correct indication whilst guaranteeing patient safety. The role of rapid diagnostic methods from sputum and tracheal aspirate of distal respiratory sample for rapid detection of viruses, bacteria, and resistance mechanisms remains to be evaluated, but it seems to be a promising tool. We suggest a diagnostic algorithm in Supplementary Figure E1 balancing non-invasive and invasive procedures.",

Further research is urgently needed in many fields to improve our knowledge, skill, and patients\u2019 outcome. There are several main areas of research: (1) to improve the detection of infection and aetiology of the respiratory infection; (2) to assess the role of lung US to diagnose a new infiltrate; (3) to assess whether the implementation of invasive techniques (fiberoptic bronchoscopy with BAL) will improve diagnostic accuracy and microbiological confirmation that ultimately will provide an early adequate antimicrobial therapy and an improvement in patients\u2019 prognosis; (4) to assess the role of early detection of viruses in NV-ICUAP and the possible impact of passive or active immunization; (5) to evaluate the right timing for intubation when non-invasive ventilation and/or high flow is being used and not improving the patient\u2019s clinical condition; and (6) to evaluate the impact of oral care with chlorhexidine and SOD in NV patients.",
