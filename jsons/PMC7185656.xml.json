Second, the diagnostic procedure used for HRV (real-time RT-PCR) differs from that used for the other respiratory viruses studied (IF). Therefore, due to the lower sensitivity of IF, especially for certain viruses such as AdV or PIV, the frequency of these viruses may be underestimated. Finally, some respiratory viruses such as human coronavirus, bocavirus or PIV-4 were not studied. Therefore, some of the respiratory infections did not get a viral diagnosis.",

Reference sequences of all HRV species and genotypes were downloaded from GenBank. Phylogenetic tree was constructed by maximum likelihood, using the GTR + I + \u0393 model for HRV-A, TIM2 + I+ \u0393 model for HRV-B, and TIM1 + I+ \u0393 model for HRV-C, using HEV-C to root the tree. Branch support was assessed by bootstrap (1000 pseudoreplicates); values higher than 70% are shown. Purple boxes represent HRV-A clusters, blue boxes represent HRV-C clusters.
