Given the anticipated wide array of respiratory bacteria and the paucity of knowledge regarding the significance of low-level viruses and fungi, we aimed to maximize specificity for bacterial pathogens and to maximize sensitivity for viral and fungal pathogens [15, 23, 24]. Therefore, we defined microbial outliers as those with Z-score \u22652 and \u226510 rpm (bacteria) or \u22651 rpm (viruses/fungi).

In addition, studies of the pulmonary microbiome in children necessarily lack healthy matched controls due to the inherent risks of anesthesia and bronchoscopy [27]. In this study, we found that many potentially pathogenic bacteria such as Pseudomonas and Streptococcus are ubiquitous, and hence their abundance needs to be contextualized by cohort-specific norms. For example, 100% of samples had detectable Pseudomonas RNA, but only sample 29 had Pseudomonas RNA detected more than 2 standard deviations above the cohort mean. Normalizing population-dependent measurements is common in pediatrics and appears well suited to describe aspects of the pulmonary microbiome [28\u201330].",

Recently, unbiased mNGS assays have allowed detection of both bacterial and viral nucleic acid but have lacked ideal sensitivity for detecting filamentous mold [11, 12]. Although the European Aspergillus PCR Initiative has described ideal methodology for extracting fungal nucleic acid from blood, the optimal extraction conditions for respiratory specimens remain less well defined [32, 33]. This study confirms the need for aggressive mechanical homogenization in stabilizing media in order to detect molds such as Aspergillus while simultaneously preserving the detection of bacteria and viruses [34\u201336]. As the majority of commercial sequencing assays measure DNA, this study adds to the literature by demonstrating that RNA sequencing is >10 times more sensitive for the detection of such fastidious organisms, which we speculate may be due to high copy numbers of particular RNA templates present in active organisms [37].",

These data are novel in the pediatric population and are congruous with surveillance data from neutropenic and nonneutropenic adults [38, 39]. However, as only 10% of samples originated from patients with suspected IPA, patient-specific factors such as antifungal pretreatment, immune reconstitution, alloreactive inflammation, and impaired mucociliary clearance remain crucial in determining which child might develop IPA [16]. While this study was not powered to assess performance characteristics of this assay for IPA, pan-fungal and Aspergillus-specific PCR have demonstrated 76%\u201379% sensitivity and 93%\u201395% specificity for probable/proven IPA [14, 40\u201347]. Combining nucleic acid tests with galactomannan can hasten diagnosis and improve clinical outcomes in some populations [48\u201351]; further, incorporation of immune function may also improve discrimination of colonization and invasive mycosis [52\u201356]. Importantly, for all nucleic acid\u2013based tests, measurable Aspergillus yield varies among species and according to life stage, cell wall characteristics, and hydrophobicity [57]. Therefore, any future clinical mNGS assay will need to be benchmarked against numerous Aspergillus species as well as other medically relevant fungi in order to have the broadest utility.",

            "text": "By characterizing the distribution of pulmonary microbes within the cohort, we identified statistically outlying potential pathogens in half of clinically negative samples. Most newly detected cultivable organisms were isolated from patients who had been pretreated with antimicrobials, highlighting the importance of culture-independent techniques [15]. In addition, several newly detected viruses were not included in clinical multiplex PCR assays (Human coronavirus, Human Bocavirus, Influenzavirus-C) [63]. While this study suggests that many idiopathic pulmonary complications may be associated with infections, one quarter of samples were concordantly negative for pathogens on clinical and mNGS testing, emphasizing the ongoing significance of noninfectious pulmonary complications in this population. Future clinical validation of mNGS may demonstrate utility in safely excluding infections and allowing amplified immunomodulation in patients with predominantly inflammatory pulmonary syndromes [64].",

First, while the Z-score was useful in deemphasizing commonly abundant organisms (ie, S. pneumoniae), it may have overvalued uncommon organisms with less abundant transcripts (ie, CMV); additional larger studies will naturally strengthen the utility of Z-score analyses. Second, because the relationship between microbe quantity and sequencing reads varies across organisms based on nucleic acid accessibility and the availability of annotated reference genomes, future clinical application of an mNGS assay will require validation on numerous clinically relevant species. Third, samples with abundant nucleic acid from human epithelial cells, leukocytes, viruses, and other sources may have reduced detection of sparse or fastidious microbes. Finally, as with all mNGS assays, the identification of microbial nucleic acid does not directly confirm the presence of viable, live organisms; does not directly implicate that microbe as a contributor to pulmonary disease; and does not exclude less abundant organisms as potential contributors to pulmonary disease. Future studies are needed to determine whether prospective use of mNGS in a clinically relevant time frame might affect patient management and improve outcomes. In order to optimize patient outcomes, we advocate for ongoing multidisciplinary collaboration among clinicians, laboratory scientists, and bioinformaticians.",
