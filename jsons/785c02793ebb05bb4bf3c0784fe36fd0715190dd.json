            "text": "Background: Codon bias is believed to play an important role in the control of gene expression. In Escherichia coli, some rare codons, which can limit the expression level of exogenous protein, have been defined by gene engineering operations. Previous studies have confirmed the existence of codon pair's preference in many genomes, but the underlying cause of this bias has not been well established. Here we focus on the patterns of rarely-used synonymous codons. A novel method was introduced to identify the rare codons merely by codon pair bias in Escherichia coli. Results: In Escherichia coli, we defined the \"rare codon pairs\" by calculating the frequency of occurrence of all codon pairs in coding sequences. Rare codons which are disliked in genes could make great contributions to forming rare codon pairs. Meanwhile our investigation showed that many of these rare codon pairs contain termination codons and the recognized sites of restriction enzymes. Furthermore, a new index (F rare ) was developed. Through comparison with the classical indices we found a significant negative correlation between F rare and the indices which depend on reference datasets. Conclusions: Our approach suggests that we can identify rare codons by studying the context in which a codon lies. Also, the frequency of rare codons (F rare ) could be a useful index of codon bias regardless of the lack of expression abundance information.",

            "text": "Codon usage bias has attracted attention for several decades. Since the 1970s, the unequal use of synonymous codons has been confirmed in many organisms. To date, the codon usage patterns in many organisms have been interpreted for diverse reasons. For instance, there have been some different influence factors proposed by researchers: the abundance of isoacceptor tRNA [1, 2] , amino acid composition [3] , mRNA secondary structure [4] , the efficiency of translation initiation [5] , GC content [6] , gene length [7, 8] , protein structure [9] and so on. Although there is still no final verdict on the formation mechanism, codon bias has been widely used to estimate and compare the expression level of endogenous genes, change the efficiency of expression of exogenous genes [10] [11] [12] , identify horizontal transfer genes from other organism [13] , judge the relationship of evolution [14] , and confirm the coding sequences.",

Since then, extensive studies on codon usage bias have been performed in other organisms such as S. cerevisiae [1, 15, 16] , Drosophila [17] and C. elegans [18] ; and the results of this research have supported the dominant theory above. One long accepted principle of this theory is that highly expressed gene must show high codon usage bias. However, with the development of high throughput technology for gene sequencing and expression level detection, doubts over this theory have increased gradually [1, [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] .",

However, in some eukaryotes, especially for higher eukaryotes, the correlation between codon bias and expression level is extremely weak [1, 29] . Therefore the balance between translational selection and mutational bias has been used to account for the codon bias observed in these organisms. These paradoxical results remind us there must be a more complicated mechanism for forming codon bias in different species beyond what this correlation suggests.",

Some relationship between the rare codon pairs and stability of gene could be found from the references and database (The Restriction Enzyme Database http:// rebase.neb.com/rebase/rebase.html) searching. There are nonsense codons (TAA, TAG, TGA) and recognition sites of restriction enzymes or methylases in some rare codon pairs. For instance, many of the rare codon pairs in the \"rare group\" are involved in affecting the stability of gene (Additional file 1: 94 rare six-nucleotide strings have been found containing recognition sites of restriction enzymes and 202 rare six-nucleotide strings have been found containing nonsense codon. Moreover, the investigation will continue). 2. We noticed that there are also some rare six-nucleotide strings present in the \"normal groups\". The common characteristic of these strings is that they contain \"nonsense codons\" (TAG, TGA, TAA) which is proved to be an important element of mRNA's instability [43] . Additionally, we have found the appearance of \"TAG\" in rare codon list and it can support that \"TAG\" is the most inefficient stop codon in Escherichia coli.",

From the identification consequence, not all seldom used synonymous codons are \"rare codons\" that can limit the expression level of heterologous genes. In recent years, there has been some debate over the significant difference of the codon usage patterns existing in different kinds of genes in the same species [44, 59, 60] . In our study, the codon usage patterns of essential genes were selected to compare with those of the whole genes in Escherichia coli. These essential genes are very important for maintenance of the basal cellular function, so they are likely to be common for all cells and not be horizontal transfer genes from other organism. Therefore, the extreme similarity of codon usage patterns between essential genes and whole genes in Escherichia coli, would suggest the existence of a common rule that can control the pattern.",

From this, we foresee that in order to improve the expression level in the operation of heterologous gene expression, we should modify and replace the identified rare codons to avoid the appearance of rare strings.
