The SARS-CoV-2 causes a clinical syndrome designated coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID19) with a spectrum of manifestations ranging from mild upper respiratory tract infection to severe pneumonitis, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and death. Few cases have been observed in children and adolescents who seem to have a more favorable clinical course than other age groups, and even fewer in newborn babies. This review provides an overview of the knowledge on SARS-CoV-2 epidemiology, transmission, the associated clinical presentation and outcomes in newborns and infants up to 6 months of life.",

In December 2019, a cluster of patients with severe pneumonia of unknown etiology, epidemiologically linked to a seafood wholesale market in Wuhan (Hubei Province, China) led to the discovery of a novel, previously unknown coronavirus, initially designated 2019-nCoV: this agent represents the seventh member of the coronaviridae family that has the potential to infect humans [3] . Since its emergence in Wuhan, despite strong restrictions to limit domestic people circulation, the 2019-nCoV infection has rapidly spread across China and all over the world. This highly contagious and deadly virus was subsequently named Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) [4] and the related disease \"Coronavirus Disease 2019\" (COVID-19) [5] . On March 11th 2020, COVID-19 was pronounced as pandemic by World Health Organization (WHO) [6] . As of April 7, 2020, the number of confirmed cases was 1.250.000 worldwide (more than 180 countries involved), with 69.210 deaths resulting in a crude fatality rate of 5.5% at time of writing [7] .",

However, the proportion of severe and critical cases was 10.6% under 1 year of age, compared to 7.3, 4.2, 4.1 and 3.0% among the 1-5, 6-10, 11-15 and > 15 year subsets, suggesting that infants may be at higher risk of severe respiratory failure than initially thought [9] .

Neither bat-nor pangolin-coronaviruses sampled thus far have the polybasic sites characterizing SARS-CoV-2, and none have enough similarity to qualify as its direct progenitor, but the diversity of coronaviruses in animal species is largely undersampled and scarsely explored [10] ). Thus, SARS-CoV-2 might have acquired its genomic features by evolutionary mutation in an animal reservoir and passed to human from droppings, contaminated food material or other in the market or surrounding regions of Wuhan. Alternatively, a more distant progenitor of SARS-CoV-2 might have passed to human and gradually acquired its pathogenic features through adaptation during successive, undetected human-to-human transmissions.",

ACE2 represents a major gateway to the SARS-CoV-2 infection, although the specific mechanisms are still uncertain. As with other coronaviruses, the N-terminal portion (S1, receptor binding domain) of the viral spike (S) glycoprotein binds with high-affinity to receptor(s) on the surface of susceptible cells. Although ACE2 has been identified as a viral receptor, there might be other receptors or co-receptors for this virus yet to be discovered [19] . It is possible that ACE2 tissue distribution differs between adults and children and the maturity and function (e.g., binding ability) of ACE2 in children may be lower than that in adults [9] .",

[30] speculate the possibility of the maternal fetal transmission of the virus. In a term infant, from mother with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia from the 34th week of pregnancy, they found virus-specific IgG and IgM, high levels of Interleukin 6 and 10, negative nasopharyngeal swab and no symptoms, since 2 h from the delivery to the following 3 weeks. The authors conclude that despite uncertainty, so high IgM levels at 2 h of life would suggest an intrauterine infection. However, as Kimberlin and Stagno [31] commented, maternal-fetal transmission of the virus is possible, as its nucleic acid has been found in blood samples, but the only finding of specific IgM in the newborn is not enough and the probability of a false positivity is high. There is currently no evidence showing vertical transmission and intrauterine SARS-CoV-2 infection in foetuses of women developing COVID-19 pneumonia in late pregnancy. Table 1 summarizes clinical characteristics of the cases described in literature to date [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] [38] , although data are available only on a small sample size.

In the absence of uniform guidelines to date, the risk/benefit ratio should be carefully weighed on an individual basis and take informed parental choices into account.
