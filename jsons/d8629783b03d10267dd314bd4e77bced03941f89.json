As happens with other coronaviruses, the SARS-CoV probably first mutated and then spread to new and susceptible species (e.g., humans). It is likely that spread among humans happened primarily by close contact that probably included droplet spread, direct contact, or fomite transmission. There were also several instances that may have involved small particle airborne or fecal/oral transmission. Usually, 1 case would only result in spread of the virus to a few other individuals, but there were several well-documented cases of \"super transmitters,\" in which 1 person could infect \u044310 other persons [11, 12] .",

The article by Hamelin et al. [2] assesses 2 patient populations: patients with exacerbations of COPD aged \u044340 years (with or without CAP) who sought help at one of the emergency departments at study hospitals, and patients aged \u044318 years without COPD who had CAP that required admission to the hospital. Three hospitals were involved for the periods of 17 January 2002 through 6 May 2002 and 6 January 2003 through 6 May 2003.",

The symptoms of diarrhea and vomiting were seen in 17% and 10% of the children in the Vanderbilt study, respectively, whereas these symptoms were not even mentioned in the Canadian study, and although fever occurred in 5 (83.3%) of the 6 subjects in the Quebec study, it was only found in 52% of children in the Vanderbilt study.",

I would take issue with this claim, unless we interpret the statement literally (i.e., if we consider the etiology to be specifically in the early spring [all 6 cases occurred in April]). Otherwise, it is hard to imagine that 4% is a particularly significant figure. The study, however, is an important one, and it is definitely a step in the right direction. To date, we have few data on hMPV, and anything that sheds light on its role as a pathogen is welcome. What is very important is the fact that the Quebec data show that, in the elderly population-particularly for persons with underlying lung disease-hMPV infection can lead to severe infection that requires hospitalization (mean duration, 10 days). Hamelin and colleagues' finding that \u223c85% of the adult population in their study had preexisting hMPV antibody is consistent with the premise that hMPV infection is almost universal by the age of 5 years.",
