This seems the result of both less fatal bleeding and less recurrent PTE in the 50 mg rt-PA group. The mortality rates in our study (2%\u20136%) are comparable to those in previous clinical trials,5, 26, 27, 34, 35 but significantly lower than those in the International Cooperative Pulmonary Embolism Registry study (23%).38 The high mortality rate in the retrospective registry study was probably the result of the enrollment of more seriously ill patients.",

First, the small sample size, a common limitation for PTE thrombolytic studies, prevented us from achieving more powerful efficacy and safety analyses. This is particularly true for the efficacy analysis in patients with hemodynamic instability and in patients with higher body weight, as well as for the mortality and PTE recurrence evaluations in all patients. Future studies with larger sample sizes are desirable to examine the efficacy and safety of the 50 mg regimen in these patient populations. Second, although physicians evaluating the imaging studies were blinded to the treatment assignments, physicians treating patients were not. This open-label study may potentially introduce bias to a certain degree. Last, a control group using heparin alone was not included for patients with extensive pulmonary artery obstruction and right ventricular dysfunction. Future studies using anticoagulation control will be valuable to determine whether thrombolytic therapy is indeed beneficial in these patients.",

Although the death rates and PTE recurrence rates were similar between the two treatments, the 50 mg/2 h rt-PA regimen had less bleeding tendency, especially in patients with lower body weights. Thus, compared with the rt-PA at 100 mg/2 h regimen, the rt-PA at 50 mg/2 h regimen is as effective and perhaps safer in treating lower-body-weight patients with PTE. These findings support the notion that optimizing rt-PA dosing is valuable when treating patients with acute PTE.",
