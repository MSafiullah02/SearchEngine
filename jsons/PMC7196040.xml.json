The ICER also determined that use of elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor in the subgroup of patients who are heterozygous for the F508del mutation and a residual function mutation is \"likely to be at least as good as\" and \"possibly better\" than treatment with tezacaftor/ivacaftor. New data examined by the ICER on three other CFTR modulators, ivacaftor [Kalydeco; Vertex], lumacaftor/ivacaftor [Orkambi; Vertex] and tezacaftor/ivacaftor, confirmed previous evidence ratings, indicating a high certainty of substantial net health benefit with ivacaftor, small net health benefit with potential for substantial benefit with tezacaftor/ivacaftor, and small net health benefit with lumacaftor/ivacaftor, compared with best supportive care. The updated Evidence Report incorporated changed made following comments received during the 5-week comment period for the draft version.",

It is critical that all eligible patients be able to access CFTR modulators\", said David Rind, ICER's Chief Medical Officer. \"Despite being transformative therapies, the prices set by the manufacturer \u2013 costing many millions of dollars over the lifetime of an average patient \u2013 are out of proportion to their substantial benefits. When a manufacturer has a monopoly on treatments and is aware that insurers will be unable to refuse coverage, the lack of usual counterbalancing forces can lead to excessive prices\".",
