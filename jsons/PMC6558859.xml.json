Bedside ultrasound revealed bilaterally enlarged collecting system, and subsequent CT-KUB confirmed bilateral hydronephrosis and mild hydro-ureters with the presence of dependent debris in pelvicalyceal system and ureters (Fig. 5, right). Rigid cystoscopy showed normal urethra, but bleeding from both ureteric openings and clots in the collecting system. Fluoroscopy confirmed filling defects (Fig. 5, left). Bilateral ureteric stents were deployed intra-operatively. Subsequently, her urine output improved dramatically with immediate improvement in creatinine and resolution to baseline within a few days of stenting.",

Twenty-four hours later, at the end of day 3 of admission, she developed sudden onset severe respiratory distress with desaturation and required intubation and mechanical ventilation. Clinical examination demonstrated extensive subcutaneous emphysema. Chest X-ray confirmed presence of right-sided pneumothorax, small left-sided pneumothorax, and pneumomediastinum (Fig. 6, left). A chest tube was inserted for the right-sided pneumothorax. Pneumomediastinum and contralateral pneumothorax remained stable on several follow-up images throughout the hospital stay, including CT scan for characterisation (Fig. 6, right).

A subsequent case report described a case of SJS with ureteropelvic mucosal involvement resulting in gross haematuria [16]. Further examination of the urinary sediment with the phase-contrast microscope indicated a urological cause for the observed haematuria, and a plain and enhanced CT of the whole abdomen confirmed thickening and enhancement of the walls of the renal pelvis and ureter, although ureteroscopy was not performed. The aforementioned post-mortem study in a 9-year-old girl who died of respiratory and renal complications demonstrated haemorrhagic ureteric submucosa with normal glomeruli, tubules, and interstitium [6].",

Literature search yielded only seven reported cases of air-leak; the majority are paediatric cases [20\u201325], with only one case described in a young adult [26]. Air leak presented as pneumomediastinum in all of these cases, with subcutaneous emphysema documented in six of the seven cases.

Pneumomediastinum is then the consequence of released alveolar air dissecting through the pulmonary interstitium along the broncho-vascular sheaths toward the pulmonary hila, into the mediastinum [27]. This hypothesis may also explain the predominance of paediatric cases due to smaller calibre airways. Forceful coughing due to hypersecretion and irritation from bronchial denudement may also contribute to alveolar rupture. Our patient had thick bronchorrhea and difficulty managing her secretions prior to respiratory deterioration. Bronchorrhea in the setting of SJS is described as clear yellow fluid, without the presence of any bronchial casts and may represent part of the exudative process of SJS rather than secondary to denudement [17]. Mechanical ventilation could be a contributing factor in our patient, although previously published case reports had air leak at presentation to hospital and therefore unrelated to the onset of mechanical ventilation. In the only other published adult case report of pneumomediastinum/pneumothorax in SJS, air leak occurred prior to the onset of mechanical ventilation [26].",
