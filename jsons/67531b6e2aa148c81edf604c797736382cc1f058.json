APN, a monomeric or homodimeric type II membrane-bound zinc exopeptidase, is widely distributed in mammalian tissues including the central nervous system and is particularly abundant at the level of the kidney, the intestine and the lung ~. In vivo, this enzyme is involved in the metabolism of angiotensin III in the brain and peripheral organs 2, in the degradation of nociceptin 3 and in the inactivation of enkephalins, in association with neutral endopeptidase NEP 4. Furthermore, APN has been proved to be identical to a human lymphocyte surface cluster differentiation antigen CDI3 5, and to behave as a receptor for coronaviruses TGEV and 229E in pigs and humans 6.7. APN has been also reported to play an important role in the invasion of metastatic tumors in vitro 8.9.

The Ki values of these compounds (3.7 and 1.9x10 -7 M) were only slightly increased as compared to those of the corresponding o~-aminophosphinic acids (l.2x10 -6 M and 9.6x10 -7 M). However, according for the presence of two unresolved asymmetric centers in these compounds, it could be assumed that the occupancy of the S~' subsite led to a gain in affinity of about one order of magnitude. These data confirms the efficiency of the phosphinic group as zinc ligand for APN inhibition, but also demonstrate the necessity of interacting with the S 2' subsite of APN for an optimal inhibition of this enzyme. In a third step, compounds 7 to 12 containing a C terminal phenylalanine in P2' position were tested and in each case the mixture of two stereoisomers (A+B) showed nanomolar inhibitory potencies. A direct comparaison between 5 and 8 or 6 and 11 indicated that the 100 fold increased activities observed with 8 and 11 was due to the S 2' subsite occupancy. Two other results could also be underlined : i) there is no direct relationship between the inhibitory potency of the ct-aminophosphinic acids reported in table 1 and those of the phosphinic peptides reported in Table 2 . For instance, compound 7, which contain a methyl group in position R~, is one of the most active inhibitor, while the corresponding ct-aminophosphinic acid is the less efficient of the series with a Ki value of 8x10 -6 M. The inverse situation occurs with the methionine side chain ; ii) For all the compounds tested, the mixture of isomers (A+B) is significantly more active than (C+D), showing a very large importance of the absolute configuration of the asymmetric carbons.",

Unexpectedly the less active compound contains a methyl side chain mimicking the alanine residue considered as the \"model-substrate\" of APN. For the corresponding Baminothiols, the inhibitory potencies are almost the same whatever the nature of Rz, with Ki values from 1.1 to 3x10 s, in agreement with previous results 19, giving compounds which are 30 to 400 fold most active than the a-aminophosphinic acids. However, this ratio is certainly overestimated since the stereodependance of APN towards its inhibitors is very important ~9 and the B-aminothiols were tested as pure stereoisomers while the ct-aminophosphinic acids were under racemic forms.Table 1.
