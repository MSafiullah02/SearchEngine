Single clinic studies of telemedicine visits for headache care have demonstrated that patients perceive telemedicine as cost\u2010effective and convenient.\n7\n Compared to traditional in\u2010person headache visits, telemedicine achieves similar satisfaction rates\n8\n and outcomes,\n9\n and recent investigations demonstrated non\u2010inferiority in multiple neurological diseases.\n10\n However, many factors have precluded its widespread use, including large scale verification of clinical efficacy and safety in comparison to live visits,\n11\n technological capabilities, patient confidentiality/privacy, licensing restrictions and malpractice, reimbursement, and frank inertia. Federal and state governments have not championed this modality, despite ongoing need to care for patients otherwise unable to reach providers\u2019 offices.\n12\n\n",

Qualified providers may now bill fee for service Medicare patients using traditional evaluation and management codes for telemedicine visits, regardless if they are in a Health Professional Shortage Area. However, Medicaid and Medicare Advantage patients are excluded from recent emergency declarations. Parity laws also vary per state, which impacts commercial insurance reimbursements.\n14\n Furthermore, while federal restraints have been waived to allow qualified providers to practice in any state, state laws may nonetheless continue to prohibit aspects of interstate practice, such as restrictions on new patient consultations or prescribing controlled substances. In some circumstances when telemedicine visits are not permitted or feasible, telephone visits can be performed and billed. As these rules are changing rapidly, the American Academy of Neurology has launched a website which assists with practical details for conducting telehealth visits, coding, and state\u2010by\u2010state coverage (https://www.aan.com/telehealth).",

We believe that other migraine preventive treatments should be utilized first when possible. Some patients on onabotulinumtoxinA may have been started on it and stable before newer preventive medication results have been published/approved. Thus, we urge providers to first consult the American Academy of Neurology/American Headache Society Guidelines (last published in 2012\n45\n; new ones are currently being produced) and to re\u2010evaluate patients' responses to the medications listed in those guidelines. In addition, therapies which have been demonstrated to be beneficial since the development of that guideline include:\n\nCGRP and CGRP receptor antagonist monoclonal antibodies (mAbs): In the past 2 years, mAbs against CGRP or the CGRP receptor have been FDA approved for preventive treatment of both episodic and chronic migraine \u2013 erenumab\u2010aooe,\n46\n, \n47\n, \n48\n galcanezumab\u2010gnlm,\n49\n, \n50\n, \n51\n fremanezumab\u2010vfrm,\n52\n, \n53\n and eptinezumab\u2010jjmr.\n54\n, \n55\n The first 3 are intended for self\u2010injection at home, with detailed instructions available for each product on its website.\nAngiotensin\u2010converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs): Candesartan\n56\n, \n57\n now has evidence of efficacy and good tolerability in migraine prevention,\n58\n, \n59\n and lisinopril\n56\n, \n60\n was considered \u201cpossibly effective\u201d in the 2015 guideline. There has been recent concern in the media about the possibility of these medications interfering with the body's response to COVID\u201019. However, the Heart Failure Society of America (HFSA)/ American Cardiology Association (ACA)/American Heart Association (AHA) issued a statement, \u201cAngiotensin\nconverting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors have been shown to be the entry point into human cells for SARS\u2010CoV\u20102, the virus that causes COVID\u201019 \u2026 Currently there are no experimental or clinical data demonstrating beneficial or adverse outcomes with background use of ACE inhibitors, ARBs or other Renin\u2010angiotensin\u2010aldosterone system (RAAS) antagonists in COVID\u201019 or among COVID\u201019 patients with a history of cardiovascular disease treated with such agents. The HFSA, ACC, and AHA recommend continuation of RAAS antagonists for those patients who are currently prescribed such agents for indications for which these agents are known to be beneficial, such as heart failure, hypertension, or ischemic heart disease. In the event patients with cardiovascular disease are diagnosed with COVID\u201019, individualized treatment decisions should be made according to each patient's hemodynamic status and clinical presentation.\n61\n\u201d For patients in need of a new preventive therapy, the potential for benefit with an ACE/ARB must be weighed against the theoretical increased risk of infection.\nMelatonin: There are also studies indicating melatonin is useful for migraine prevention with few side effects.\n62\n, \n63\n\n\nZonisamide: Has been found to be effective in cases where people have not had as positive a response to topiramate and/or had side effects to topiramate.\n64\n, \n65\n, \n66\n\n\n",

Migraine can worsen during times of stress, so having available options that bypass insurance hurdles and can be administered at home without patient training is imperative. Telehealth provides an important opportunity to continue to care for our vulnerable population and help avoid emergency room and urgent care visits that put patients at risk and burden the overwhelmed healthcare system. The largest at\u2010risk group of established migraine patients are those that depend on procedures to allow them to remain functional and out of the emergency room. The shortage of personal protective equipment has caused an unfortunate break in care for many of these patients. During the current pandemic we, headache specialists, make a plea to insurers to lift cumbersome restrictions to allow patients greater availability of evidence\u2010based treatment options to reduce the burden of their disease. One example would be to allow patients who were being treated with onabotulinumtoxinA to bridge with an anti\u2010CGRP/CGRP\u2010receptor mAb while their procedures may be postponed. Our common goal as health care providers is to maintain the health of our patients while continuing to keep ourselves, our staff, and our families safe. Successful management of migraine with avoidance of in\u2010person patient clinic visits further benefits the current urgent overall societal goal of maintaining social distance to contain the pandemic.",
