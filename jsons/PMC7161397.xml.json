Furthermore, Benseler et al. found that in a consecutive series of children diagnosed with KD, up to one third had concurrent, identifiable infections,12 including Group A streptococcal tonsillitis, viral illnesses, pneumonia, and gastroenteritis.",

Furthermore, the KD cases that did not meet the criteria for diagnosis had a significantly higher proportion of coronary artery abnormalities as compared to those cases that did meet criteria (20% vs. 7%, P < 0.05).13 Sudo et al. utilized epidemiological data from the twentieth nationwide survey of KD in Japan and found that the prevalence of coronary artery lesions 1 month after disease onset tended to be higher in the cases with one or two principal criteria as compared with those cases that had five to six criteria (7.4% vs. 2.5% P < 0.05).14 Consistent with this, a recent meta-analysis of over 20 studies of patients with KD found that incomplete KD is a risk factor for coronary artery abnormalities.15\n",

Conversely, in older children, treating KD is seldom an emergency, especially when patients present symptoms after only 5 or 6 days of fever. Observation of children older than 6 months who do not fulfill criteria may be the best course of action. The mean duration of fever in children with untreated KD is 12 days,18 much longer than typical viral illnesses, so the persistence of fever or development of additional signs of KD can be an indicator for treatment.",

Overrepresentation of T cells bearing V\u03b22 among lymphocytes in coronary artery aneurysms, intestinal mucosa,53, 54 and peripheral blood55 from patients with KD supports the hypothesized role of superantigens in the pathogenesis. A variety of additional circumstantial evidence52, 56, 57, 58 and a murine model of Lactobacillus casei\u2013induced vasculitis lend credence to this theory.59 Further, children with KD have unique reactions to mycobacterial antigens,60, 61, 62 which may also function as superantigens, including recall reactions at the site of a previous bacillus Calmette\u2013Gu\u00e9rin immunization.61 Nonetheless, the only human illness definitively ascribed to superantigens is toxic shock syndrome, and different groups have published conflicting evidence regarding the isolation of superantigen-producing organisms, the detection of superantigen proteins, and the presence of an immunological signature of superantigen activity in patients with KD.55, 63, 64\n",

A separate report implicated polymorphisms of the mannose-binding lectin (MBL) in the pathogenesis of KD.88 MBL binds to n-acetyl glucosamine and mannose present on the surface of many microbes. This interaction results in activation of complement (C3) independent of antibody. Levels of MBL are determined by polymorphisms of the MBL 2 gene and its promoters. Higher expression of MBL is associated with lower incidence of coronary artery lesions in patients under 1 year old, but it has the opposite effect in older patients.

In addition, 19% reported weakness, and 15% reported arthralgia or arthritis. Perineal desquamation may be another early sign of KD.96 Over the next 3 to 4 days, cervical adenitis, conjunctivitis, changes in the buccal and oral mucosa, a pleomorphic rash, and erythema and edema in the hands and feet develop. The manifestations occur in no particular order and can fluctuate in the first 7 to 10 days of illness. Accordingly, a thorough medical history is important for identifying subtle or transient manifestations of KD. Untreated, the clinical signs of KD subside after an average of 12 days. If myocarditis occurs, it often does so early and may be manifested by tachycardia, an S3 gallop, and perhaps signs of congestive heart failure.97 Pericarditis, abdominal pain, ascites, and hydrops of the gallbladder also may occur at this time.",

Tachycardia out of proportion to the fever is also found in children with significant myocarditis. Such children may be misdiagnosed with viral myocarditis. In more severe cases, myocardial involvement may progress to dysrhythmias and signs of congestive heart failure.116 Children with prominent KD-associated myocarditis tend to respond briskly to treatment with IVIG, and long-term abnormalities of cardiac contractility are very uncommon in children treated appropriately during the acute phase of KD.117 Tacke et al. performed cardiac magnetic resonance (MR) imaging in patients and controls at a median of 11.6 years following diagnosis of KD and found that only those with severe coronary artery pathology had evidence of cardiac dysfunction.118\n",

Renal ultrasonography was abnormal in five patients, and dimercaptosuccinic acid single photon emission computed tomography (DMSA SPECT) revealed inflammatory lesions in 26 children. Although renal function remained normal, scarring was demonstrated in 46% on repeated DMSA SPECT. Sterile pyuria is one of the supplemental laboratory criteria in the algorithm for suspected incomplete KD. Burns et al. compared pyuria in KD cases versus febrile controls without urinary tract infections. They found that pyuria was neither sensitive nor specific for KD, but that the magnitude of pyuria in KD was significantly higher than in febrile controls (42 WBC/\u00b5L vs. 12 WBC/\u00b5L).142\n",

After the fever resolves, the dose is usually reduced to an antiplatelet range of 3 to 5 mg/kg/day. These doses, well below the antiinflammatory level, have the effect of inhibiting platelet adhesion to endothelium by curtailing platelet release of thromboxane A2 without suppressing prostacyclin production by endothelial cells.171 This effect is thought to be beneficial in preventing thrombosis when platelet counts are elevated, although no studies have demonstrated such a benefit clinically. In the event of aspirin sensitivity, another antiplatelet agent, such as dipyridamole, should be considered in patients at particular risk of developing thromboses. Unless coronary artery abnormalities are detected by echocardiogram, aspirin is discontinued after results of laboratory studies return to normal, usually within 2 months of disease onset.",

The ASA-treated group had shorter duration of fever as compared to the no-ASA group, but there was no difference in IVIG resistance (17.1% vs. 15.7%, P = 1.000) or the development of coronary artery lesions (7.8% vs. 3.9%, P = 0.514).173 A retrospective study by Hsieh et al. had similar findings, although the duration of fever was not different in the no-ASA group.174 Although the necessity of using high-dose aspirin might be questioned because of the rapid response to IVIG, all of the trials showing the benefit of IVIG were conducted with children who also were receiving antiinflammatory doses of aspirin. There have been no published comparisons of aspirin with other antiinflammatory agents, and it is unclear whether salicylates are uniquely efficacious for this condition.

Such children may require low-dose opiates for relief.186\n",

This is not to say that treatment after 10 days of illness is ineffective or contraindicated; it is merely inadequately studied. In a report of 16 children with coronary artery aneurysms treated a mean of 17 days after the onset of fever, echocardiogram showed there was a trend toward resolution of abnormalities.187 The American Academy of Pediatrics cautiously recommends IVIG for children beyond the tenth day of illness with \u201cmanifestations of continuing inflammation,\u201d and such an approach appears prudent.165 Questions have arisen concerning very early treatment of KD.188 Tse and colleagues,189 on the other hand, reported that IVIG given on or before the fifth day of illness resulted in fewer coronary artery abnormalities at the 1-year follow-up assessment. Thus, decisions about the optimal date for treating with IVIG are best made based on a patient's clinical status and the certainty of the diagnosis of KD rather than anticipated advantages of administration on a particular day of disease.",

In a retrospective series from Japan, Fukunishi and colleagues190 found higher serum levels of CRP, lactate dehydrogenase, and bilirubin to be predictive of failure to respond to IVIG. More recently, Kobayashi and colleagues reported on several factors that were associated with decreased responsiveness to IVIG, and therefore increased risk of coronary artery abnormalities: hyponatremia; elevated hepatic transaminase and CRP; a high percentage of bands on the WBC count differential; a platelet count of 300,000 or less; short duration between fever onset and diagnosis (4 days or less); and being younger than 12 months of age at onset.191 Egami et al.192 and Sano et al.193 have also constructed risk scores for IVIG resistance utilizing similar parameters. Unfortunately, application of these risk scores did not accurately identify all children at risk for IVIG resistance and coronary artery abnormalities in a North American cohort.194 In a Canadian study, Han and colleagues188 could not identify any difference in laboratory parameters between responders and nonresponders. Confirming the importance of controlling inflammation in KD, Mori and co-workers195 reported that a rise in the WBC count and CRP level after IVIG infusion are independent predictors of coronary artery abnormalities.",

Patients treated with infliximab had fewer days of fever and reduced inflammatory markers. The z score of the left anterior descending artery was significantly decreased in the infliximab group as compared with the placebo group at week 2 (P = 0.45). However, coronary outcomes at week 5 did not differ between treatment groups. There were no serious adverse events attributed to infliximab during the trial.
