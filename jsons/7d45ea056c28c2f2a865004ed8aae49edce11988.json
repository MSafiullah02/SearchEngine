            "text": "At the early stages of the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic first detected in Wuhan, China data on virus transmissibility and pathogenesis was uncertain, as would be the case for a novel influenza virus. 1 Given this uncertainty, Chinese authorities adopted strict measures to contain COVID-19 spread, by continuing closure of schools and workplaces, which were already closed for the Chinese Lunar New Year, activating measures to enforce significant community contact reduction, and closing transport links between population centres. This response was in contrast to the situation which occurred in 2002/3 with the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome epidemic, where the SARS coronavirus had spread widely before measures were effected to contain it. 2 We used early transmission data from the unmitigated COVID-19 outbreak in China, 3 to adjust parameters in an established, individual-based simulation model of an Australian city to reflect these COVID-19 characteristics, and applied the model to evaluate the effectiveness of a range of social distancing interventions. The results provide guidance to public health authorites as to the mitigating effect of individual social distancing measures, such as school and workplace closure and reductions in community-wide contact, and under alternative levels of \"robustness\". 4 Similar modelling studies have also evaluated social distancing in mitigating COVID-19 virus spread. [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] Public Health authorities also require guidance as to how best to relax social distancing measures to allow an economy to restart while preventing a \"bounce back\" second peak in case numbers. We thus evaluated how social distancing measures may be relaxed in an optimal manner that achieves the following two goals: to allow the economy to grow again, from a low activity base affected by workplace closures; and to do this in a way that prevents a rebound in case numbers and deaths. To determining the impact of relaxing social distancing we conducted analyses under two distinct settings: New York City, a high transmission setting where an exponential growth in cases occurred prior to social distancing activation on 22 nd March 2020, with a strengthening of measures occurringon 12 th April 2020; 10 and a low transmission setting of Perth, Australia where strict border closure and social distancing interventions were activated prior to significant within country COVID- 19 virus transmission. 11 In Australia robust social distancing measures were adopted country-wide starting on 20 th March 2020 and further strengthened on 23 rd and 26 th March 2020, 11-13 resulting in significant reductions in workplace and community-wide contact. These measures resulted in very low levels of COVID-19 virus transmission, with almost all diagnosed cases being returing Australians infected outside the country, or those who had been in direct contact with such individuals. In Western Australia, closure of State borders coupled with rigorous contact tracing and testing prevented any significant outbreak occurring in metropolitan Perth, a conurbation with a population of approximately 2\u00b72 million.",

The model is individual-based (c.f. agent-based) and represent each individual in a specific community, matching recent census and other government data. 14,15 Related individual-based simulation models for multiple population centres in Australia, and in South Africa, Thailand, Vietnam and Papua New Guinea, have been previously developed using the same underlying automata-theoretic modelling methodology to capture the dynamics of both pathogen transmission and population mobility. [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] This approach to disease modelling has allowed us to explicitly simulate person-to-person virus transmission, the probability of such transmission, the location of transmission (e.g. school, workplace, home, community) and determines each individual's infection status through time. [17] [18] [19] 21 Such simulation models create a \"virtual world\" of individuals whose daily movement, changing contact patterns and disease biology dynamics aim to replicate that of the real-world system in as much detail as data sources permit, such as data from the POLYMOD contact pattern study. 22 As with the SARS outbreak in 2003 no vaccine is available, 23 and the population has no immunity at the outset. Reliance must be made on robust social distancing interventions, contact tracing and early isolation of diagnosed cases. The aim of social distancing interventions in the current COVID-19 situation is to slow down transmission and reduce the growth rate in case numbers. This approach aims to lessen the daily pressure on health care personnel and hospital facilities, such as intensive care beds, and to lower mortality rates.",

These data are contained in Table 1 . At the early stage of the COVID-19 epidemic reliable age-specific symptomatic attack rates were unavailable and we thus assumed transmission between different ages of individuals occurs similarly. The model explicitly represents each household, workplace and school in a community and the movement of individuals between, as they move from households to schools and workplaces in a daytime cycle, then return to their household in an evening cycle, with each day split into a day and night period. This mobility mechanism allowed us to model changing contact patterns, with virus transmission occurring in these contact locations, and also in the wider community, including at weekends. The model represents the individual-to-individual contact patterns in as much detail as data sources provide, to accurately describe how the movement of individuals allows virus transmission to spread over a geographic region. This level of detail is critical for modelling social distancing interventions, whose aim is to minimize person-to-person contact patterns and consequential virus transmission.",

Figure 1 presents daily infection data, which may be transformed into a lower diagnosed case rate and subsequent case fatality rate. The infection rate is seen to be immediately impacted by activation of social distancing measures, as transmission rates are quickly reduced by the reduction in person-to-person contact. The impact of social distancing measures activated in NYC in March and April would have been detected by reductions in diagnosed cases approximately seven to ten days later, due to the incubation period delay followed by delays in diagnosis. There would be a similar delay in the reduction in deaths due to the introduction and further strengthening of the social distancing measures. Initial unmitigated epidemic coloured blue. School closure and estimated 35% reduction in workplace and community-wide contact activated 22nd March 2020 given by orange curve. Social distancing strengthened 12th April 2020 by increased reduction in workplace and community contact to 50%, schools remained closed, grey curve. Schools reopen 21st June 2020 with social distancing interventions maintained, illustrated by green curve. School reopening together with workforce and community-contact increased to 65% given by orange curve. All social distancing strategies assume case isolation of 90% children and 50% adults. Figure 1 illustrates two scenarios where social distancing interventions are relaxed in a manner which permits an economic \"restart\" while keeping the infection rate at a level that may be managed by available health care reources. Here we assume schools reopen on 21 st June 2020, allowing parents providing childcare of young children to return to the workplace. We evaluated school reopening with social distancing interventions maintained, as illustrated by the green curve in Figure 1 . An alternative scenario is when schools restart simultaneously with workplace attendance increasing from 50% to 70% (workplace non-attendance WN reduced to 30%) and community-contact increasing from 50% to 65% (community-contact reduction reduced to 35%). .

This study evaluated the easing of strong social distancing measures under two distinct settings: 1) for countries with high transmission rates arising from delays in activating response measures, as occurred in a number of European countries (i.e. Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom) and in New York State, USA and, 2) for countries which were able to rapidly respond to the initial ourbreak in China, by closing borders, activating robust social distancing measures, had capacity to rapidly diagnose cases, trace contacts and quarantine them. Countries such as Australia were thus able to contain the initial growth in case numbers and in some states, such as Western Australia, be close to virus elimination. 29 Deciding on the timing and reduction in strength of social distancing measures as they are relaxed, to ensure that case numbers have declined to levels where health system resources are sustainable, is a challenge for governments. There is a need to balance what may be necessary to reduce the daily infection rate and take pressure off health care resources, with what a population can sustain, such as a long duration of highly restrictive measures, and the consequential negative impact this has on economic activity.",

For example, the very flat epidemic curves which result from relaxing social distancing between eight and ten weeks after introduction (pink and green curves of Figure 2 ) have estimated diagnosed case peaks of approximately 2,500 per day. City-specific data relating diagnosed case numbers to hospitalization rates may then be used to estimate ventilator and ICU bed demand. While this will be higher than if the robust social distancing measures were not relaxed, if such estimated health care resource needs are within the capacity of the health care system then the decision to relax interventions becomes a tradeoff between managing infection numbers and increasing economic activity. When transmission has significantly reduced, relaxation of social distancing the allows schools and workplaces to safely reopen and community-wide activity to partly resume, with a resulting increase in economic activity.",

Our analyses show how robust Australian social distancing measures have prevented arrival of introduced cases developing into a rapidly growing outbreak. Furthermore, a previous modelling analysis by the authors demonstrated how a significant rebound in daily cases may be mitigated by use of a robust, combined social distancing response. 4 The COVID-19 transmission characteristics assumed in our model produced an unmitigated infection rate of 66%, which includes both symptomatic and asymptomatic cases, and a basic reproduction number of 2\u00b72. Higher or lower R0 settings will affect case numbers under all the social distancing intervention considered. In the absence of definitive data on the proportion of infections which are asymptomatice we assumed a 35% asymptomatic proportion. Similarly, if the infectious period is longer than the three days assumed, the same caveat applies. However, sensitivity analyses indicate that changing the underlying model parameters to reflect these modifications does not affect the relative effectiveness of the social distancing measures.",
