However, because anyone can post, information shared on social platforms, such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and YouTube, is unverified. Such unverified information is the primary source of false or malicious rumors. Users often cannot judge the authenticity of information; this is primary problem of social platforms. Therefore, a service to provide credible information to verify this information may be advantageous.",

Open data is a kind of credible information provided by the government or well-known enterprises to promote the development of information systems. In this study, we used Open Government Data (OGD) as credible information to assist users in evaluating the authenticity of unverified information. Recently, Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) (Wikiquote 2020) has spread worldwide rapidly and caused panic. Some rumors about the Wuhan coronavirus circulating on Taiwan\u2019s social platforms have had a negative impact on epidemic prevention. For example, one such rumor is that using an alcohol bath can reduce fever and prevent the Wuhan coronavirus. This study aims to provide a credible OGD to interactively verify the information on social platforms.",

Numerous articles regarding food safety issues are spread via Facebook. Additionally, Facebook provides an Application Programming Interface (API) for Messenger that allows developers to easily create chatbots to facilitate interaction with users. We used Facebook to develop a food safety information platform (FSIP) to verify the feasibility of our proposed architecture that employs machine learning and open data with a chatbot and is based on cloud computing (MLODCCC).

There are two requirements must be met in the development of the FSIP. The first is the performance evaluation of machine learning combined with open data through Spark cluster cloud computing. It can present open data to combine with Facebook posts to form big data application. The second is the correctness assessment of the information provided by the open source combined with machine learning. It can facilitate to develop machine learning technologies and integrate into open data to promote intelligent capabilities for various Spark cluster cloud computing applications. This study makes three main contributions. First, the MLODCCC is proposed to integrate machine learning and open data with chatbot into Hadoop Spark cloud computing environment. Second, the MLODCCC is used to develop the FSIP that assists users to judge the authenticity of food safety related posts in Facebook. The FSIP carries out to integrate four emerging research areas: machine learning, open data, social chatbot, and cloud computing. Third, the performance evaluation of FSIP is analyzed and compared with various Hadoop Spark cluster cloud computing environment.",

The advantage of this fast information dissemination approach is that it can be easily and inexpensively obtained. In contrast, social platforms also promotes the rapid dissemination of fake information or rumor. Some studies (Gottifredi et al. 2018; Han et al. 2018; Shelke and Attar 2019; Zannettou et al. 2019) have focused on how fake information, malicious information, and rumors affect user behavior in social platforms. In Zannettou et al. (2019), authors presented an overview of the fake information ecosystem, including various categories of fake information, various different actors, and motivations. In Shelke and Attar (2019), authors analyze the rumor detection approaches and present the classification of current rumor detection approaches.",

            "text": "In recent years, rumor detection is an important research topic in social networks. The existing methods used to detect rumors can be divided into three approaches: networking, machine learning and deep learning (Sarah et al. 2020). Networking approach (Alrubaian et al. 2018; Kotteti et al. 2018) adopts social networking features, including the number of fans, posts, the reply content, timestamp, to evaluate information credibility. Machine learning approach (Habib et al. 2018; Li and Li 2019; Xuan and Xia 2019) uses statistical analysis techniques to automatically process content classification to detect rumors. In contrast, deep learning approach (Bhuvaneswari and Selvakumar 2019; Asghar et al. 2019; Srinivasan and Dhinesh Babu 2020; Xing and Guo 2019) focuses on employing neural network technologies for training and creating simulations to facilitate detection of rumors. In this study, we integrated machine learning approach and open data with social chatbot to assist users evaluating the information authenticity in social platforms. Machine learning technologies, binary classification, and Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI) are adopted to identify potential information and to determine similar information, respectively. Therefore, our study is the first one to integrate machine learning and OD technologies for rumor detection.",

Their study compared the accuracy of different classifications with an example of detecting damp-heat syndrome. With regard to the application of chatbot, UP et al. (Narendra et al. 2017) used a chatbot carrying with natural language to resolve the drawbacks of using keywords for searching in traditional knowledge management systems. Their ideas mainly focused on analyzing the strings entered by users to obtain the meanings to be expressed, with which to query the knowledge management system. The said drawbacks in traditional management system were resolved. In the field of food safety information related research, Geng et al. (2017) used web crawler tools based on the Text Density and Multi-factor Similarity Calculation to obtain the food safety related information from the Internet. The obtained information was further analyzed through text data analysis, allowing the government organizations to understand the recent hot events on food safety.

There are four algorithms used in Jieba, namely DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph), Trie Tree, Dynamic Programming, and HMM Model (Hidden Markov Model). Term Frequency\u2013Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) is an algorithm used to calculate how important a word is to a document or Corpus. TF-IDF is a numerical statistic that is often used in text mining and data search (Yahav et al. 2019). Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI) is a method of information search (Phadnis and Gadge 2014). Generally, when searching for keywords would ignore the correlation among single words. However in practical applications, single words might actually one another be correlated. LSI can consider these correlations. Singular value decomposition (SVD) is used to decompose a matrix into three matrices (Onuki and Tanaka 2018). SVD is highly useful in machine learning to gather intelligence for various applications (Wang and Zhu 2017). The association between an article and a word is used in SVD to determine the category of an article.",

We employed the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) to evaluate the binary classification model (Atapattu et al. 2010). The possible binary classification parameter combinations were listed before model training began. After model training with one parameter combination was complete, the verification data were used to calculate the model\u2019s AUC; this AUC was added to an AUC list. These steps were repeated until all parameter combinations had been executed. Subsequently, the AUC list was sorted to identify the model with the highest AUC for use in the next stage. The test data were also used to calculate the model\u2019s AUC. If the AUCs calculated using test and verification data were the same, the model was considered not to be over trained and therefore the optimal binary classification model. The possibility of over training exists because the criterion used for selecting the test data is not the same as the verification data. If over training occurs during the testing phase, the model shall modify the parameter combination and re-execute the training phase.",
