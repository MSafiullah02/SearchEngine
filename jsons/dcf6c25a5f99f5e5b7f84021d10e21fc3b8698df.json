Restrictions on freedom of movement, imposed to contain COVID-19, can also harm populations on the move, hampering their access to safety and protective mechanisms.",

Women also often perform caregiving roles outside of the home; they comprise 70% of the health and social care workforce in many countries. 5 This again increases the likelihood that they will be exposed to communicable diseases. In addition, social norms prevalent in many humanitarian settings dictate that women and girls are the last to receive medical attention when they become ill. 6 These norms could prevent women and girls-particularly those who are already stigmatised, such as IDPs and refugees, members of certain ethnic or racial groups or those of different sexual orientationsfrom accessing testing and timely treatment for COVID-19. Furthermore, testing may not be available for some displaced populations, as illustrated in Bangladesh, where testing facilities are limited to the capital, Dhaka, which is 400 km away from the world's largest refugee camp in Cox's Bazar. 7 During past public health emergencies, resources were reallocated from routine healthcare services towards containing and responding to outbreaks, 4 constraining access to essential healthcare, including mental health and psychosocial support and sexual, reproductive and maternal health services. Many of these services are already limited in humanitarian settings, particularly for some groups. For example, adolescent girls have unique sexual and reproductive needs that often go unmet, 8 while non-citizens-including IDPs, migrants and refugees-may be unable to access government health systems. Others already suffering from diseases such as HIV, malaria and tuberculosis may find their treatment interrupted by these resource diversions at the same time that their pre-existing illnesses make them more susceptible to serious forms of COVID-19. 9 It is likely that COVID-19 will exacerbate existing gaps and result in new ones, increasing women's and girls' vulnerability to COVID-19 as well as to other health conditions.",

Consequently, their ability to conduct household-level disease prevention efforts or to meet their own hygienic needs could be compromised. They may have to travel further to collect water and procure essential hygiene goods, making them more vulnerable to gender-based violence or sexual exploitation and abuse. 11 ProTeCTIon As illustrated above, health and humanitarian crises exacerbate gender inequalities and place women and girls at increased risk of gender-based violence and sexual exploitation and abuse. 12 13 For example, movement restrictions or quarantine measures to mitigate the COVID-19 pandemic in humanitarian settings may increase the incidence of intimate partner violence. 14 Women and girls who are already stigmatised in their communities may be unjustly blamed for the spread of the disease. 15 As the pandemic spreads, their access to medical and psychosocial services for survivors of harassment and violence could decrease as resources are reprioritised to fight COVID-19.",

School closures can also have negative effects on displaced or refugee children for whom school can provide a reliable source of food and psychosocial support. For example, during the 2014-2016 West Africa Ebola outbreak, girls whose mothers were infected had to take on additional caregiving responsibilities. 19 Even if their school was open, girls found it difficult to balance caregiving burdens with education. This led to increased absenteeism or to the girls leaving school completely, which had long-term effects on the girls' educational, economic and health outcomes. 19 Food SeCurITy and nuTrITIon Public health emergencies can have tremendous impacts on food systems, including supply chains, which communities in humanitarian settings often rely on. In addition, movement restrictions and quarantine measures may result in less access to food, increasing prices at the same time that populations are less able to conduct economic activities and food production. Some households may resort to negative coping mechanisms, such as reducing food consumption, engaging in transactional sex, borrowing money or going into debt to pay for food. Surviving the declared end of an outbreak may not automatically ease food insecurity or malnutrition in affected communities, as it will likely take months to restart agricultural activities and trade.",

During the 2014-2016 West Africa Ebola outbreak, restrictions on the movement of goods and people hampered women's trading activities and their ability to engage in agricultural activities, decreasing their earning potential. 23 Concerns over spreading the infection, travel restrictions and xenophobia may limit the work opportunities of internally displaced or refugee women. 24 Moreover, women's and girls' unpaid caregiving burdens will increase rapidly as governments close schools and care services to prevent the spread of COVID-19 and household members contract the disease. With already limited time-and likely employed at a lower wage, due to the global pay gap-women and girls will have even less self-directed time, including to spend on their own paid work. 25 These factors, along with the potential loss of income due to the death of other household income earners, mean that the economic impact of COVID-19 on women and girls could be long-term and widespread.",
