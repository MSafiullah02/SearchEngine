PEDV also induced intestinal mucosa and systemic proinflammatory cytokine responses in pigs [4,5]. Currently, vaccination is the main means for preventing PEDV infection.

On the first day of the trial, all pigs were allotted on the basis of BW to six groups and each fed diets supplemented with either 5.5, 5.5, 43.0, 80.5, 118.0, or 155.5 \u03bcg 25(OH)D3/kg. Each treatment consisted of four gilts and three barrows. At day 22 of this study, all the treatments were orally administrated with 35 mL of PEDV (5.6 \u00d7 103 TCID50/mL) except for one of the 5.5 \u03bcg 25(OH)D3/kg (220 IU vitamin D/kg equivalent) treatment, which was served as control (CON) and administrated with the same volume of sterile saline. Another 5.5 \u03bcg 25(OH)D3/kg treatment for PEDV challenge was named by CON-PEDV. In order to prevent infection, the CON groups were housed in the next room of challenge groups. The settings for the two rooms were the same. Pigs in the CON group were negative for PEDV throughout the trial period. As shown in Table 1, the basal diet was formulated to meet or exceed nutrient requirement for weaned piglets [14], except for vitamin D3, which was not prepared in the vitamin premix. Each treatment was formed by supplementing with indicated 25(OH)D3 levels in the basal diet. All pigs had ad libitum access to water and experimental diets throughout the trial. 25(OH)D3 (Hy-D) was kindly provided by DSM Nutritional Products Ltd. Shanghai, China. The PEDV was kindly presented by professor Zhiwen Xu, College of Veterinary Medicine, Sichuan Agricultural University. Average daily gain (ADG) and average daily feed intake (ADFI) were determined via weighing to determine body weight and recording of feed intake.",

In this study, we also found that villus height and VCR were decreased, and crypt depth was increased with PEDV challenge. In addition, serum DAO activity was also increased by PEDV challenge. Serum DAO activity is a marker of mucosal integrity [28]. These results indicated that PEDV induced morphological changes of jejunum and an increase in intestinal permeability. The 155.5 \u03bcg 25(OH)D3/kg 25(OH)D3 treatment was shown to be optimal in alleviating intestinal injury induced by PEDV. Therefore, this may be the reason why the 155.5 \u03bcg 25(OH)D3/kg treatment showed the minimum diarrhea scores and diarrhea rate among the treatments. Moreover, we found that claudin2 gene expression showed a linear response with increasing dietary 25(OH)D3 concentration, and 25(OH)D3 tended to increase MUC2 expression under the conditions of PEDV challenge. It suggested that high dose 25(OH)D3 supplementation could improve tight junction protein expression to maintain intestinal barrier integrity. Interestingly, levels of SI, an intestinal absorptive cell marker, were significantly increased by PEDV challenge. A previous study has shown that PEDV infection decreased goblet cells in intestinal villous [29]. Hence, we infer that PEDV infection could cause disorder differentiation of intestinal cells, which promotes the differentiation of intestinal stem cells to intestinal absorption cells, while decreasing differentiation to intestinal secretion cells. However, high dose 25(OH)D3 supplementation significantly reduced the SI expression induced by PEDV, which might be beneficial for maintaining normal intestinal function. We also found occludin expression was increased with PEDV challenge compared with CON, but 118.0 and 155.5 \u03bcg 25(OH)D3/kg groups inhibited this increase. Luo et al. [30] demonstrated that overexpression of occludin in target cells makes them more susceptible to PEDV infection, which indicated that occludin plays an essential role in PEDV infection. In the present study, we speculated that 155.5 \u03bcg 25(OH)D3/kg supplementation might ease PEDV infection through decreasing occludin expression.",

            "text": "Innate immune response plays an important role in defense against viral infections in mammalian cells. During viral infection, the virus is recognized by pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs) including toll-like receptors (TLRs) and retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIGI) or melanoma differentiation gene 5 (MDA5), then INFs and proinflammatory cytokines are produced for initiation of the inherent antiviral immune response [31,32]. Different types of IFNs bind to different receptors. Type I IFNs (IFN-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b2) signal through IFNAR1 and IFNAR2 to activate the JAK-STAT signaling pathway. And type III IFNs (IFN-\u03bbs) signal through IFNLR1 and IL10R2 to activate JAK-STAT signaling pathway to induce the expression of hundreds of interferon stimulating genes [31]. Unlike type I interferon receptors, which are seemingly ubiquitous, type III IFN receptors are confined to the mucosal epithelium [33]. Thus, IFN-\u03bbs mainly play an antiviral role in mucosal epithelial cells. In the current study, PEDV increased the PRR, inflammatory cytokine, and IFN\u03bb expression in the jejunum mucosa. This indicates that the IFNs signaling pathway was activated by PEDV in the intestine of piglets. Since the high dose of 25(OH)D3 supplementation showed a better protective effect than the low dose groups, we investigated whether high dose supplementation could alleviate PEDV infection by regulating immunity. We found that a high dose of 25(OH)D3 inhibited the PRR, IFN\u03bb, STAT1, and MxA expression. It was suggested that dietary 25(OH)D3 supplementation inhibited the activation of intestinal immunity induced by PEDV. Previous studies have shown that vitamin D attenuated rotavirus infection and reduced the viability of Mycobacterium tuberculosis through regulating autophagy and cathelicidin [9,34]. Therefore, we speculated that the suppression of the IFN signaling pathway from high dose supplementation of 25(OH)D3 might be due to decreased PEDV replication. In addition, we also found that high doses of 25(OH)D3 inhibited jejunal mucosa IL6 and IL8 mRNA expression compared with CON-PEDV. This suggested that high dose 25(OH)D3 supplementation might inhibit intestinal inflammation induced by PEDV. Reducing the expression of intestinal inflammatory cytokines is also beneficial in maintaining normal intestinal function.",
