Past EBOV outbreaks have been sporadic in nature and confined to central Africa, in which the aggregate number of infections up to early 2014 have caused 1093 deaths from 1393 total cases, for a 78.5% case fatality rate [1]. The EBOV outbreak in the West African countries of Guinea and Liberia in 2014, as well as confirmed imported cases in Sierra Leone and several suspected cases in the surrounding countries, indicates that EBOV is geographically more widespread than previously thought. The identity of the EBOV reservoir remains elusive despite efforts, although it has been suggested that fruit bats are one of the potential reservoir species [2]. This complicates the strategy of eradicating EBOV and preventing its transmission to humans by targeting the reservoir for vaccination. As a result, there is a need for a preventive vaccination program tailored for humans at high risk of exposure to EBOV, such as residents of areas considered endemic for EBOV, primary health care providers in these endemic areas, as well as biosafety level (BSL)-4 laboratory researchers.",

Mucosal vaccination with VSV\u0394G/EBOVGP via the intranasal (IN) or oral (OR) routes still protects NHPs [10], easing the difficulty of administration by eliminating the use of needles. VSV-based vaccines expressing GP from either Marburg virus (MARV) or Sudan virus (SUDV) (known as VSV\u0394G/MARVGP or VSV\u0394/SUDVGP, respectively) are able to protect against a homologous virus challenge [11], [12]. A blended vaccine consisting of equal parts VSV\u0394G/EBOVGP, VSV\u0394G/MARVGP and VSV\u0394G/SUDVGP conferred complete protection against EBOV, MARV or SUDV challenge [13]. Complete protection was also achieved in these NHPs after challenge with Tai Forest virus (TAFV), suggesting evidence of cross-protection [13]. VSV\u0394G/EBOVGP has been previously administered as an emergency treatment to a researcher on compassionate grounds after a suspected EBOV exposure in the laboratory. Aside from a fever detected 12 h after vaccination, the recipient remained healthy [14]. While clinical trials will be needed, this is a positive sign for the safety of VSV-based vaccines. Pre-existing immunity to VSV is not prevalent in humans [15], [16], [17], and therefore it is not expected to be a significant factor in a potential vaccination campaign with VSV-based vaccines.",

Protection from Andes virus challenge was still observed in Syrian hamsters 1 year after VSV immunization; however, it was not possible to distinguish vaccine efficacy from an increased resistance to infection with age in the control animals [20].

After the initial immunization, groups of five animals for each treatment were challenged IP with 1000 \u00d7 LD50 of mouse-adapted EBOV (MA-EBOV) at 6.5 or 9 months after vaccination. Weight change and clinical symptoms were monitored daily for 15 days, and survival was monitored until 28 days post-infection (dpi). Of note, a larger number of animals (10 for DMEM and 15 for VSV\u0394G/EBOVGP) were challenged at 12 months post-vaccination, because some previously vaccinated and unchallenged mice housed in BSL-2 containment unexpectedly died due to old age [24]. A decision was made to challenge the remaining mice, as longer intervals between immunization and challenge could not be reliably assessed beyond 12 months in this animal model. Mock-treated animals rapidly lost weight after MA-EBOV challenge and succumbed to disease by 7 dpi. The mean time to death (MTD) of all control mice was 5.4 \u00b1 1.0 days. In contrast, mice immunized with VSV\u0394G/EBOVGP were completely protected against MA-EBOV when challenged at 6.5 and 9 months after vaccination, and did not display observable weight loss (Fig. 1A\u2013D). When challenge was performed 12 months after vaccination, 12 of 15 (80%) animals were protected from MA-EBOV. The survivors did not display weight loss, whereas the three non-surviving mice lost weight and succumbed to disease with a MTD of 8.0 \u00b1 1.0 days (Fig. 1E and F).",

Serum samples were obtained from animals that were bled at 3, 6.5 and 12 months after vaccination. The humoral immune response was evaluated for levels of EBOV-specific neutralizing antibody (nAb) and GP-specific IgG antibody. EBOV-specific nAbs were only detected in 7 of 25 VSV\u0394G/EBOVGP vaccinated mice when measured 3 months after vaccination. The titers ranged from 13 to 53 (Fig. 2A, supplementary data). In contrast, high titers of GP-specific IgG were detected in all immunized mice at all times post-vaccination. The IgG titer reached between \u223c104 and \u223c105 at 3 months post-vaccination in all but two mice. In these two animals, the IgG titer only reached \u223c103, which was 4- to 32-fold less than the other mice. Twelve months after vaccination, GP-specific IgG titers decreased in some mice. One previously strong responder had its IgG titer decline to the level of the 3 month low responders (Fig. 2B, supplementary data). The three mice with lower IgG titers as measured at 12 months after vaccination ultimately did not survive MA-EBOV challenge.",

Space limitations in high bio-containment laboratories and the prohibitive costs of maintaining NHPs over a longer period of time are also reasons behind why there are very few studies investigating the long-term protection of EBOV vaccines. The data presented in this study show that a single injection of VSV\u0394G/EBOVGP provides durable protection in rodents. Similar to a previous study [25], VSV\u0394G/EBOVGP viremia was not detected in the immunized animals when RT-qPCR was performed on sera at 3 months after vaccination (data not shown), and there were no clinical signs after immunization. As highlighted by the 100% survival in guinea pigs challenged 18 months after immunization, the VSV-based vaccine is a promising long-term vaccine candidate. However, it was unknown whether sterile immunity was observed in these animals, as EBOV viremia was not measured after challenge. Specific IgG responses decreased at 12 months after vaccination in mice. This could be due to the old age of the animals, and may indicate the need for booster vaccinations later in life. Additionally, a prime-boost regimen may also be necessary to elicit a protective immune response in older animals.",

A standard ELISA and several microliters of sera were, in hindsight, sufficient to predict survival outcome in each rodent. Decreased levels of circulating specific IgG may be indicative of declining immunity, as observed in the non-surviving mice, or a poor vaccine response, as observed in the non-surviving guinea pig. Follow-up studies will be necessary to confirm these trends. It should be noted that since IgG antibody levels did not decrease in guinea pigs at the time of latest challenge, the antibody data suggest that protection may be possible beyond 18 months after immunization. Furthermore, these studies warrant further investigation in NHPs, which allows for full characterization of the immune response. This was not possible in the current experiments either due to small blood volumes from individual mice or the lack of available reagents to more thoroughly study the immune responses in guinea pigs.",

Neutralizing antibodies were detected in only 4 of the 6 survivors [30]. The prevalence of SUDV-specific IgG antibodies amongst the survivors was also found to decline over time, as 61% of survivors (33 individuals/54 total) initially tested positive for SUDV-specific antibodies during the original outbreak, but this changed to 73% (29/40), 66% (32/48), and 41% (13/32) when re-tested after 6 months, 2 and 10 years [31]. In summary, a specific IgG response can be detected in human survivors of Ebola infections. However, conclusions and trends cannot be drawn based on these results, as samples from non-survivors would not be available for direct comparison. A laboratory-based approach using animals will be required to determine whether these sustained immune responses are sufficient for protection from disease in case of potential re-exposure.

Sera diluted in PBS 2% skim milk (30 \u03bcl) was added, in triplicate and incubated for 1 h, 37 \u00b0C. After washing, horseradish peroxidise (HRP)-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (KPL) diluted 1:2000 in PBS 2% skim milk was added for 1 h at 37 \u00b0C. After washing, the substrate (ABTS + H2O2, KPL) was added for 30 min at 37 \u00b0C, before reading on a Versamax Microplate reader (Molecular Devices) at 405 nm. The data were analyzed with the SoftMaxPro 6.1 software. The resulting data are expressed as endpoint dilutions and a sample was deemed positive when the absorbance was greater than five standard deviations from the pre-vaccination control sample for each animal. The titers were plotted using GraphPad Prism 5 and the limit of detection for this assay was 100 reciprocal dilutions. Samples were assayed in triplicate and the average titer was reported.",

The highest serum dilution with cells scoring for greater than 50% reduction in quantity of eGFP expression, when observed under the iSpot FluoroSpot Reader System (AID), was considered positive for neutralizing antibodies.
