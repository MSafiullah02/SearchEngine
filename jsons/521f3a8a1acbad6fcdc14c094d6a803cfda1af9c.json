While Covid-19 most commonly causes a mild respiratory illness, there are wide ranges of presenting symptoms and disease severity. Due to the immunosuppression required to prevent allograft rejection, patients with orthotopic heart transplant (OHT) represent a population who may have an atypical presentation or be at higher risk for adverse outcomes from Covid-19. Currently, Covid-19 in patients with OHT remains poorly characterized (1) . We describe the presentation, course, and outcomes of patients with OHT hospitalized for Covid-19.",

In Michigan, 14% of the population is black, though 33% of Covid-19 cases and 41% of deaths occurred in the black community (3) . While this imbalance is potentially due to the prevalence of comorbid conditions or healthcare disparities, genetic polymorphisms in the renin angiotensin system (RAS) may also contribute to risk.

This occurred despite these patients requiring immunosuppression to preserve allograft function. It appears that, similar to the general population (8), these laboratory findings denote a higher illness severity in patients with OHT with Covid-19 and may be used to risk stratify patients. Of note, while elevated high-sensitivity troponin levels are seen in approximately 20% of Covid-19 cases (9), levels were elevated in more than half of our cohort, though these levels were also elevated prior to admission among the 10 patients for which this data was available. Lymphopenia and thrombocytopenia rates were higher in this study compared to previous reports in the non-transplant and kidney transplant populations (7, 10) . This may be explained by a lower baseline lymphocyte and thrombocyte count, yet median values of these cell counts were lower on admission. While myocardial injury has been associated with worse outcomes (11), no signal of an association was evident in this small series and no patients experienced cardiac complications.",
