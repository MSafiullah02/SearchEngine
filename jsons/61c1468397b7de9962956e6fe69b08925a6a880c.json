Nowadays, they are developing monitoring technologies for bioterrorism agents with fast analysis, low limit of detection, and high accuracy to prevent false negatives and positives and maintain confi dence in the monitoring system [ 30 ] . Among the highest-risk threat agents in bioterrorism can be considered: (1) Bacteria, they are prokaryotes, and their distribution is ubiquitous (humans, animals, and environment). They are the oldest living organisms in the history of this planet and play an important role in maintaining the ecosystem [ 11 ] . Escherichia coli ( E. coli ) is a family of naturally occurring bacteria. Some of these cause sickness and even death. Most E. coli infections come from eating undercooked (i.e. contaminated ground beef). Terrorists could use E. coli 0157:H7 bacteria as a weapon to strike many people at one time, also the Bacillus anthracis ( B. anthracis ) is considered a high pathogenic agent that could deliberate contamination events causing anthrax [ 31 ] ; (2) Neurotoxins produced by Clostridium botulinum are among the most known poisonous substances [ 32 ] . For example, botulinum toxin is the most toxic substance known and is extremely poisonous by the oral route (estimated lethal oral dose, 10-70 m g for a 70 kg human) and potentially toxic by inhalation [ 33 ] , for this reason it is used as bioterrorism agent (3) Infl uenza A (H1N1) virus also could be considered a bioterrorist agent, it belongs to the Orthomyxoviridae family and corresponds to the specifi c combination of glycol-protein hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) variants, which are present on the surface of the enveloped RNA virus [ 24 ] . (4) Malaria is the most prevalent parasitic disease in the worldcaused by the apicomplex protozoan of the Plasmodium genus . Malaria is present over the tropics, where four species, Plasmodium falciparum, Plasmodium vivax, Plasmodium malariae and Plasmodium ovale are transmitted to humans by the bites of the female mosquito vector of the Anopheles genus [ 34 ] and although the use of parasites as bioterrorism agents has not received so much attention.

In the last years, several researchers have used luminescence methods instead of colorimetric methods for (bio)sensing applications.
