            "text": "In dynamic combinatorial chemistry (DCC), molecular building blocks are reversibly formed via covalent or noncovalent bonds. With only a few building blocks, a relatively large number of reversible products can be generated, forming a dynamic combinatorial library (DCL). Given that the reaction between the building blocks is reversible, the members of the DCL continuously exchange to eventually reach a thermodynamic equilibrium. When an external stimulus, such as a protein target, is introduced, the dynamic system re-equilibrates upon selection and non-covalent binding of the library members with the strongest affinity for the target. The specific affinity of each library member is determined by the number, type, and strength of interactions (favorable and nonfavorable) it establishes with the protein target. Examples of these intermolecular interactions are van der Waals forces, \u03c0\u2013\u03c0- stacking, cation\u2013\u03c0, dipole\u2013dipole, hydrogen-bonding, and ion\u2013dipole interactions, as well as ion pairing. Ultimately, the best binders of the library are amplified at the expense of library members displaying a lower affinity for the target (Fig. 1\n). Identification of the best binders circumvents the need for synthesis, purification, and characterization of every individual library member. However, up to date, it remains very difficult to analyze DCLs of large size, preventing DCC from becoming a more widely used tool in drug development.1\n,\n2 In this article, analytical methods used in protein-templated DCC will be described. Apart from the general theory, examples of recent developments and reports will be briefly discussed.2\n",

DCL formation can be performed in the presence (adaptive) or in the absence (pre-equilibrated) of the protein target. However, the reversible reaction used for DCL formation should equilibrate fast enough to allow re-equilibration by the target on a timescale during which the target remains stable. The conditions applied should also match the criteria required by the protein, such as a certain pH and temperature and a given concentration of cosolvent(s). In order to speed up equilibration, a catalyst such as aniline3 or the enzyme lipase4 for reversible acylhydrazone or ester formation, respectively, might be added. To ensure formation of an unbiased DCL, the building blocks should be of comparable reactivity and energy. Furthermore, all building blocks and products need to be soluble, to prevent shifts in equilibria due to precipitation. Usually, a cosolvent such as dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) is used to maintain products and building blocks in solution. Additionally, it is important that reactions are chemoselective to avoid cross reactivity with functional groups of the building blocks or the protein (e.g., lysine residues at the surface of the protein).",

            "text": "Given that the reactions in the DCL are reversible, it should be noted that the analytical method can influence the composition of the library (e.g., trace of acid in liquid chromatography (LC)). To avoid changes in equilibrium composition, libraries should first be \u201cfrozen\u201d in the presence of the target protein, whereupon analysis can take place. The method of choice to \u201cfreeze\u201d a DCL depends on the type of reaction that is used. Highly reversible imines, for example, can be reduced to the corresponding amines, rendering them irreversible. Acylhydrazones are easily formed and highly reversible under acidic conditions; as a result, the reversible reaction can be slowed down or stopped using an increase in pH. When a reaction is catalyzed, removal or deactivation of the catalyst will convert the DCL into a static mixture. In each case, carefully designed control experiments need to be carried out, to ensure an unbiased result. In case a reduction step is used to \u201cfreeze\u201d the library, it should be studied in how far the binding pose and affinity are affected by this chemical modification. An amine-based inhibitor, for instance, has a lot more flexibility than its imine-based parent compound and an inverted hydrogen-bonding profile. Besides \u201cfreezing\u201d the library, the parameters used for DCL generation will affect the equilibrium composition and amplification factors. Examples include the choice of building block and protein concentration, concentration and type of cosolvent (typically 1\u201310% DMSO), and temperature (typically room temperature).",

Owing to the large variety of columns available and a built-in diode array detector, mixtures of compounds can be separated and characterized. Subsequently, the retention time and UV profile of the HPLC chromatogram are analyzed and compared with experiments performed under different conditions. In the case of a DCL, comparison of the library in presence and absence of the target protein can lead to the identification of amplified and/or depleted species. In 1997, DCC was first applied to a protein target by the group of Lehn using imine formation/exchange.5 A DCL of three aromatic aldehydes 1a\u2013c and four different amines 2a\u2013d in ten-fold excess was synthesized with and without carbonic anhydrase (CA) II as a model enzyme (0.4 mM) (Scheme 2\n). In order to reduce the imines 1-2 to amines 3, NaBH3CN (1.2 mM) was added to the reaction mixture, and the mixture was incubated at 25\u00b0C for 14 days. The reaction without enzyme was completed within 24 h. Before analysis of the DCL, thermal denaturation of the enzyme (2 min. at 80\u00b0C) ensured release from the active site of possibly tightly bound ligands. Using a cellulose membrane, the reaction products were separated from CA by microcentrifuge filtration. Analysis of this first example of protein-templated DCC was performed by comparison of HPLC traces of the DCL in the presence and absence of CA. It was shown that the presence of the enzyme favored the formation of those condensation products that were expected to display the strongest affinity for the enzyme\u2019s active site. The strongest binders were identified by comparison with retention times of separately synthesized reference compounds.",

            "text": "A more recent example of analysis by LC was reported by Greaney and coworkers,6 who had demonstrated in 2010 the use of aniline as a nucleophilic catalyst for the reversible formation of acylhydrazones.3 Prior to this report, acylhydrazone chemistry required acidic pH, which is not compatible with most protein targets. Besides a pre-equilibrated system, in which the DCL is formed first, followed by a \u201cfreezing\u201d step and addition of the protein, acylhydrazone chemistry was considered to be of limited use for protein-templated DCC. With the introduction of aniline as a nucleophilic catalyst, acylhydrazones can be formed reversibly at pH 6.2 and reach a steady-state composition in 6 h instead of 7 days without aniline. By controlling the pH, the equilibrium of the DCLs can be easily switched on and off. In the proof-of-principle study, two isozymes of glutathione S-transferase (GST) were used, which play an important role in cell detoxification7 and are emerging targets for the treatment of drug resistance in chemotherapy (human (h) GST P1-1)8\n,\n9 and tropical diseases (Schistosoma japonicum (Sj) GST).10 DCLs were generated with aldehyde 4, related to the known GST substrate chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (CDNB), and a 2.5-fold excess of each of the ten hydrazides 5a\u2013j in the presence of 10 mM aniline at pH 6.2 (Scheme 3\n). The hydrazides were added in large excess with respect to the aldehyde to ensure pseudofirst-order behavior and to achieve faster equilibration rates. The DCLs containing 4, 5a\u2013j, and one of the isozymes were allowed to stand at room temperature, with occasional shaking, for 12 h. Then, the pH was adjusted to 8.0 to \u201cfreeze\u201d the DCL, and the protein was removed by ultrafiltration using a molecular weight cutoff filter of 10,000 Da. Subsequently, the library was analyzed by HPLC and compared with the DCL in the absence of protein. Both DCLs showed a very clear amplification of acylhydrazones: t-butylphenyl and thiophenyl acylhydrazones 4-5c and 4-5g were amplified in presence of hGST P1-1 and SjGST, respectively. Accurate IC50 values of the resynthesized acylhydrazones could not be determined due to poor solubility. To solve this problem and at the same time increase the potency of the acylhydrazones, glutathione (GSH)-conjugated aldehyde 6 was synthesized and employed in a DCL with hydrazides 5a\u2013j (Scheme 3). The highly soluble GSH tripeptide motif was expected to function as an \u201canchor\u201d at the GSH-binding site, enabling exploration of the adjacent hydrophobic site with a range of hydrazide fragments. Again, the same hydrazide fragment was selected by the enzymes as the best binder: t-butylphenyl and thiophenyl acylhydrazones 6-5c and 6-5g for hGST P1-1 and SjGST, respectively. Acylhydrazone 6-5j was also slightly amplified in the DCL with hGST P1-1. The most significant reductions in equilibrium concentration occurred for 6-5b, f, and i (SjGST) and 6-5f, g, and i (hGST P1-1). To confirm that the observed amplification was not caused by target-accelerated synthesis, SjGST was added to a preformed DCL. The same equilibrium distribution was obtained, indicating that the amplification is a result of genuine thermodynamic selection. To fully explore the isozyme-specific amplification of the two DCLs, the IC50 values of the separately synthesized acylhydrazone conjugates 6-5a\u2013j were determined. The most amplified acylhydrazones were found to be the most potent in the biochemical assay. Thiophenyl acylhydrazone 6-5g displayed the lowest IC50 value against SjGST (22 \u03bcM), and t-butylphenyl acylhydrazone 6-5c had the lowest IC50 value among the four conjugates (6-5c, g, h, and i) against hGST P1-1 (57 \u03bcM).",

The majority of GSTs exist as homodimers, containing a conserved GSH-binding site and a hydrophobic substrate-binding site at the dimer interface. Inhibitors featuring a long \u201carm\u201d at either end of the central scaffold could be able to span the dimer interface and address both GSH-binding sites. An acylhydrazone-based DCL was generated comprising three nitro-substituted benzaldehydes 4, 6, and 7, which are derivatives of known binder CDNB, and four bivalent hydrazide linkers 8a\u2013d in the presence of aniline as a nucleophilic catalyst (Scheme 4A\n), resulting in 24 homo- and hetero-bis-acylhydrazones (plus additional mono-acylhydrazones), excluding E/Z isomers. In order to have the opportunity to discriminate between the H-sites of different GST homodimers, the linkers were designed to have differing lengths and lipophilicity. Four GST isozymes (murine (m) GSTM1-1, hGSTP 1-1, SjGST, and mGSTA4-4) were used as template for the reversible formation of acylhydrazone binders. After incubation at room temperature for 48 h, HPLC analysis of the adaptive DCLs using two HPLC columns in series was performed and compared with DCLs generated in the absence of protein. Each peak was identified by deconvolution in combination with LC\u2013MS analysis. The highest amplifications were obtained for the m and Sj isozymes, with an impressive amplification of over 600% by mGSTM1-1 for hydrazone 6-8c-6 (Scheme 4B).",

In contrast, hGSTP1-1 appeared to interfere with the DCL equilibrium for certain compounds. For example, bis-acylhydrazones containing two units of 6 were degraded to mono-acylhydrazones by the enzyme. Therefore, hGSTP1-1 was not used further in the templating studies.",

For mGSTM1-1, the IC50 data correlate well with the amplifications observed in the DCL: inhibitor 6-8c-6 (IC50\n = 50 nM), which showed the greatest amplification, is nearly ten-fold more potent than the other bis-acylhydrazone products. The inhibition data for SjGST correlate less well with the amplification observed, presumably due to competition among the amplified library members for shared building block 8b, which reduces the extent of amplification. Due to a lack of clear equilibration, the amplification factors observed could not be correlated with the IC50 values for hGSTP1-1. To elucidate the role of linker 8c, an overlay model was constructed based on the crystal structure of hGST M1A-1A, containing ligand S-2,4-dinitrobenzene. The model shows that the linker 8c can span the dimer interface of hGST M1A-1A, without introducing any unfavorable interactions or distorting the dimer structure, demonstrating that DCC with bivalent linkers is particularly suited for protein targets that are challenging to address by structure-based design (SBD).",

LC is often combined with MS, in which case peaks can immediately be assigned to the corresponding library member. Otherwise, first, the retention times and UV profiles have to be confirmed using separate building blocks and (side) products. New potential inhibitors that do not contain a strong absorbing chromophore can be overlooked when only UV detection is used. Evaporative light scattering detectors (ELSD) might solve this problem. However, the use of ELSD requires different equipment and is therefore less commonly used. One of the major bottlenecks associated with HPLC and LC\u2013MS is the limited library size. Although the analytical method possesses adequate sensitivity to detect subtle changes in concentration of compounds of interest, a mixture of many compounds can often not be fully resolved. This limits the size of the DCL to tens of compounds rather than thousands of possible ligands. In the future, it is expected that methods using ultra performance LC (UPLC) will increase the potential library sizes, but even then, there will be a size limit. An additional downside of HPLC analysis is the requirement for relatively large amounts of protein.",

Two adaptive DCLs (DCL1 and DCL2, Scheme 6\n) were prepared using different catalysts consisting of 20 carboxylic acids (408 \u03bcM each) and 12 alcohols (500 \u03bcM) and 28 carboxylic acids (480 \u03bcM each) and 22 alcohols (550 \u03bcM).

After denaturing the protein by the addition of MeOH and centrifugation, the supernatant was analyzed by ESI-HRMS. Interestingly, the library was not \u201cfrozen\u201d before denaturation. From both DCLs, ethyl palmitate was identified as a new binder of BSA. The binding and affinity of the protein for ethyl palmitate were further examined via fluorescence spectroscopy. The thermodynamic parameters and association constants K\na were determined using the Van\u2019t Hoff and Stern\u2013Volmer equations, respectively.

This spectrum is also known as the off-resonance spectrum. In a second experiment, a spectrum is recorded while selectively irradiating the protein, without influencing the ligand(s). Usually, this saturation step is performed between 0.0 and \u2212 1.0 ppm, a region characteristic of aliphatic residues of the protein. The selective saturation is now transferred from the aliphatic side chains to the whole protein via spin diffusion through cross relaxation (intramolecular nuclear Overhauser effect).

Retrosynthetic analysis of the acylhydrazones resulted in five hydrazides 11a\u2013e and five aldehydes 12a\u2013e (Scheme 7\n). To facilitate analysis by 1H-STD-NMR spectroscopy, the full library was divided into five sublibraries, each consisting of one aldehyde and five hydrazides. After the addition of endothiapepsin to the preformed sublibraries, the acylhydrazones were identified by analyzing the imine-type (12a, 12b, 12d, and 12e) or \u03b1-carbon (12c) proton signals in the 1H-STD-NMR spectra. From the five sublibraries, featuring a total of 25 potential acylhydrazones 13 (50 isomers including E/Z isomers), eight binders were identified (Scheme 7, 13a\u2013h). In order to confirm the binding mode, the competitive, potent inhibitor saquinavir (inhibition constant (K\ni) = 48 nM) was added to the 11a\u2013e\n + \n12d sublibrary. The appearance of saquinavir signals and decrease of acylhydrazone signals in the 1H-STD-NMR spectrum confirmed specific binding of the acylhydrazones 13e and 13g. Subsequently, the biochemical activity of the eight binders was determined using a fluorescence-based assay. Seven of the eight acylhydrazones inhibit endothiapepsin with IC50 values between 13 and 365 \u03bcM (Scheme 7), confirming the outcome of the 1H-STD-NMR experiments (one acylhydrazone was insoluble under the biochemical assay conditions). The most potent inhibitors 13g and 13f display IC50 values of 12.8 and 14.5 \u03bcM, respectively. In order to determine the predicted binding mode, endothiapepsin crystals were soaked with inhibitors 13g and 13f.

STD-NMR spectroscopy only works if the ligand is used in excess, therefore requiring significantly less protein than LC\u2013MS.

Claridge and Schofield reported the use of two NMR methods to analyze DCLs with proteins as template for the first time, namely, 11B-NMR spectroscopy and 1H-waterLOGSY.19 Using these NMR techniques, ternary complexes of enzyme, boronic acids, and sugars in the DCLs were monitored to identify binders of \u03b1-chymotrypsin. The 11B nucleus is quadrupolar (I\n = 3/2), which can be exploited to determine the hybridization state of the boron atom: an 11B nucleus in an sp2-hybridized trigonal planar environment exhibits relatively broad peaks compared with an 11B nucleus in a highly symmetrical sp3-hybridized tetrahedral environment, which gives much sharper peaks.20 Although 11B-NMR spectroscopy enables the direct observation of the boronate\u2013enzyme complexes and is free from protein background signals, it is far from optimal for the analysis of DCLs. The 11B-NMR signals are broad, causing boronic acids with similar structures to overlap. Additionally, 11B-NMR spectroscopy suffers from low intrinsic sensitivity, which necessitates the use of high concentrations of boronic acids and protein to compensate for the loss in signal. 1H-waterLOGSY21 features better sensitivity than 11B-NMR spectroscopy. First, magnetization of the bulk H2O in the sample takes place, and after a variety of different transfer mechanisms, small molecules that interact with the target protein are detected. The protein concentration can be very low, but 1H-waterLOGSY21 can be limited by the exchange kinetics of the reversibly formed protein\u2013ligand complexes and might still suffer from overlapping signals, especially for large DCLs.",

The natural cosubstrate 2OG was used as a reporter ligand, and in order to block enzyme-catalyzed 2OG turnover and to avoid oxidation of diamagnetic Fe(II), the native Fe(II) was substituted by paramagnetic and catalytically inactive Zn(II). When a competitive binder displaces bound 2OG from the binding site into the bulk solution, the unbound 2OG is observed via 1H-NMR spectroscopy. By monitoring the intensity of the reporter signal as a function of inhibitor concentration, it is also possible to obtain dissociation constants (K\nd). As a proof-of-principle study, the boronic acid scaffold and some diol hits from a previous study23 using dynamic combinatorial MS (DCMS; see section \u201cDynamic combinatorial MS\u201d) were subjected to the competitive NMR analysis. The results obtained are in agreement with the nondenaturing DCMS results. The competition-based 1H-NMR technique only uses substoichiometric amounts of unlabeled protein and has additional advantages over other ligand-based NMR techniques: site-specific binding information and K\nd values for ligands with both high and low affinity can be obtained.",

Subsequently, nondenaturing ESI-MS and MS\u2013MS are used for the direct analysis of protein\u2013ligand complexes. A recent example of DCMS was reported in 2012 by the group of Schofield enabling the identification of new inhibitors based on acids/boronate esters for PHD2 (see section \u201cOther NMR-based methods\u201d).23 PHD2 is an Fe(II) and 2OG oxygenase that regulates human hypoxic response. Involvement in treatment of anemia and ischemia-related diseases makes this human hydroxylase an important drug target.25 First, based on modeling studies, \u201csupport ligands\u201d 14 and 15 were designed to participate in both Fe(II) chelation in the active site and boronate ester exchange (Scheme 8A\n). It was predicted that \u201csupport ligand\u201d 14 fits well in a side pocket of the active site and 15 would function as a control, since it should not bind at the active site due to steric clash. Four sublibraries of ten diols each were prepared based on molecular weight, and PHD2\u2013Fe(II) and \u201csupport ligands\u201d 14 or 15 were added to each DCL (pH 7.5). Subsequently, the eight DCLs (four containing 14 and four containing 15) were analyzed with ESI-MS in order to determine which boronate esters bind preferentially to PHD2\u2013Fe(II). Of the 40 possible boronates with \u201csupport ligand\u201d 14, seven boronate esters derived from seven diols 16a\u2013g were found to bind (Scheme 8B). ESI-MS analysis of mixtures of 14 with the individual diols validated the DCMS results. In the absence of 14, some of the individual diols (e.g., 16e and 16g) were also observed to bind to the enzyme, presumably through chelation with Fe(II). When 15 was employed as a control, no binding of boronate esters was found, and again, binding of some diols to the enzyme was observed. These results indicate that the mass shifts observed with 14 represent the boronate ester\u2013PHD2 complexes, instead of simultaneous binding of 14 and the diols. In order to validate the DCMS results and to ensure that the results obtained were not biased by the MS technique, NMR-based water relaxation experiments (see section \u201cOther NMR-based methods\u201d) were performed, confirming that the DCMS method (gas phase) is in agreement with the NMR studies (solution).",

The technique is very fast and enables direct analysis of the protein\u2013ligand complexes. Synthesis of all individual library members to validate spectral assignments is not required, and individual building blocks could be directly used in determining binding constants. Despite the high sensitivity of MS, however, the library of 40 compounds had to be divided into sublibraries of ten possible compounds. Schofield and coworkers also described some fragmentation of boronic acids, which is a limitation of the DCMS approach. Also not all proteins can be used for nondenaturing MS analysis, and during analysis, care should be taken, since not all of the noncovalent interactions might be translated during the transition from solution to gas phase in the same manner.26 Lastly, due to the soft conditions that have to be used, DCMS methods are not that straightforward, and a lot of time and effort can be required to establish a method for analyzing a DCL with a novel protein target.",

In 2012, the group of Wanner demonstrated an efficient way to screen hydrazone inhibitors using pseudostatic libraries and determined the binding affinity by competitive MS binding assays.27 \u03b3-Aminobutyric acid (GABA) transporter 1 (GAT1) was chosen as a target, which is the most important subtype of the GABA transporters. Decreased GABAergic neurotransmission is assumed to be a major cause of neurological disorders like epilepsy, Parkinson\u2019s disease, and sleeping disorders.28\n,\n29 Inspired by the work of Andersen et al.,30 hydrazone derivatives 19 were designed that resemble mGAT1 inhibitors 20a\u2013c (Scheme 9\n). Nipecotic acid derivative 21 was used as the hydrazine building block, and 36 aldehydes 22 were divided over nine equal libraries (four possible hydrazones per DCL). In order to get a rough estimate of the equilibration time, five different aromatic aldehydes (40 \u03bcM to resemble four aldehydes at 10 \u03bcM) were reacted separately with hydrazine 21 (100 \u03bcM) in the absence of target, and the reaction was monitored by UV. In each case, almost complete equilibrium was reached within 4 h, and therefore, a 4 h incubation period was chosen for the DCC experiments in the presence of the target (adaptive DCC). To ensure nearly full conversion of the aldehydes toward the products, hydrazine 21 (100 \u03bcM) was used in a 2.5-fold excess with respect to the total aldehyde concentration (four aldehydes, 10 \u03bcM each). In case equal amounts of the structurally diverse aldehydes are added to the hydrazine, a library should be obtained with all constituents being present in similar amounts. Although the building blocks are continuously exchanging, the overall composition of the library is almost constant. Such a library is also known as a pseudostatic DCL. After addition of only 10\u201320 \u03bcg of protein per sample and incubation at 37\u00b0C for 4 h, the DCLs were analyzed by competitive MS. For hit detection, native marker 23 (K\nd 26.5 \u00b1 4.6 nM at pH 7.1) was added to each sample (final concentration 23 20 nM) and allowed to equilibrate for 40 min. After termination of the reaction by vacuum filtration and denaturation of the isolated protein\u2013ligand complexes, the amount of MS marker was quantified by LC\u2013ESI-MS/MS. Control libraries containing no hydrazine 21 and hydrazine 21 without aldehydes were shown to have minor effects on 23 binding, decreasing it to a maximum of 70% and 92 \u00b1 3%, respectively.",

In 2008, the group of Rademann reported dynamic ligation screening (DLS), in which reversibly formed ligation products from the DCL compete in a dynamic equilibrium with a fluorogenic reporter substrate for a target enzyme.33 By using an enzymatic reaction to detect the fragments, only small amounts of protein are required, enabling high-throughput screening (HTS) in microtiter plates. To demonstrate the DLS method, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus SARS-CoV Mpro was used as a protein target, which is a cysteine protease that is essential for replication of the virus inside the host cell and responsible for SARS. First, a fluorescence-based assay for SARS-CoV Mpro was developed using substrate Ac-TSASVLQ-AMCA 28 (Table 4\n). Enzymatic cleavage of 28 releases fluorophore 2-(7-amino-4-methyl-3-coumarinyl)acetamide (AMCA). Next, peptide aldehyde inhibitor 29, which mimics the native protease substrate and acts as a directing probe, was synthesized on an oxazolidine resin. Given that aliphatic aldehydes are less reactive toward imine formation in aqueous media than aromatic aldehydes, it was hypothesized that the imine products of the reaction between a nucleophile and aliphatic peptide aldehyde 29 could only be formed when stabilized by the protein surface defining the active site, enabling substrate competition. In each well on a 384-well microtiter plate, aldehyde 29 was mixed with the enzyme and an eightfold excess of one of 234 chosen nucleophiles 39 (a selection containing amines, thiols, and hydrazines). Substrate 28 was added, leading to the release of fluorophore AMCA as a measure of enzymatic turnover which can be monitored by fluorescence spectroscopy. None of the individual nucleophiles showed inhibition of SARS-CoV Mpro. For seven nucleophiles from the library, a stronger inhibition than with aldehyde 29 alone was observed (Table 5\n).",

Comparing the inhibitory activity of 31 with truncated amide 32 and those of the inactive peptides Ac-DSFDQ-OH, DSFDQ-OH, and Ac-DSFDQ-NH2 supported the directing effect of aldehyde 29 and the binding of fragment 30 to the S1\u2032 pocket. Further evidence was provided by modeling studies and the inhibition results of aldehydes and 2-ketoaldehydes 33\u201336. These aldehyde derivatives of 30 were designed to interact with the active site of the protease using their electrophilic ends. DLS showed that aldehydes 33\u201336 are active inhibitors of the protease and thus support the hypothesis that the fragments bind specifically to the S1\u2032 pocket of SARS-CoV Mpro.",

            "text": "Schmuck and coworkers showed in 2015 the use of a pre-equilibrated acylhydrazone-based DCL for the identification of \u03b2-tryptase inhibitors with low nanomolar affinities.34 A pre-equilibrated approach was chosen, given that acylhydrazone formation requires acidic conditions that are not tolerated by the protein target. \u03b2-Tryptase is the predominant serine protease in human mast cells and responsible for several allergic and inflammatory disorders.35, 36, 37 The protease consists of four identical monomers and is stabilized by heparin. It features four active sites with a central access pore. It was proposed that when this pore is blocked, the substrate cannot access the active site. Therefore, DCLs were designed based on reversible acylhydrazone formation between tetrapeptide hydrazides and di-/trialdehydes. In this case, the two- and three-armed peptide acylhydrazones are large enough to (partially) block access to the four active sites, and the amino acids in the arms of the acylhydrazones can have multiple interactions with the protein surface. First of all, a DCL was generated with five di- and trialdehydes (40a\u2013e) and five peptide-derived hydrazides (41a\u2013e) (Scheme 11\n). Hydrazides 41a and 41b were based on earlier work,38\n,\n39\n41c and 41d were derived from 41b, and negatively charged hydrazide 41e was chosen as a negative control, since the negative charge would be unfavorable for the inhibition of \u03b2-tryptase. The full DCL was generated by mixing the hydrazides with the aldehydes in acetate buffer (pH 4.0) and analyzed by a deconvolution strategy, which was first established by Lehn and coworkers.40, 41, 42 For the analysis, ten sublibraries, in which one building block is missing, were generated in the same way. The composition of the sublibraries can be compared with the full library. In case a building block is missing, which is normally part of a very active inhibitor, the corresponding sublibrary will be less active than the full library. Equimolar concentrations of both building blocks were used, and the libraries were equilibrated at room temperature for three days. Formation of the corresponding acylhydrazones was confirmed by analytical HPLC and MS. When it is assumed that all of the aldehyde groups in the DCL have fully reacted to form an acylhydrazone, the DCL from five hydrazides, four di-aldehydes, and one tri-aldehyde can contain a total of 225 possible constituents. When the identical acylhydrazones are removed (all of the di- and trialdehydes are symmetrical), the library size is reduced to 95 different members. As for the sublibraries, the library size changes depending on the number of functional groups featured by the building block, which is removed. It could not be confirmed if all of the compounds were present in the libraries and in which relative amounts. Therefore, it is possible that the inhibitors identified are not the best possible inhibitors. This limitation always applies to the use of pre-equilibrated libraries.",

First, the DCLs were \u201cfrozen\u201d by changing the pH to 7.4, which stops the reversible acylhydrazone formation. Then, analysis was carried out with a high-throughput enzyme\u2013activity assay using the substrate Toc-Gly-Pro-Arg-AMC, which generates fluorophore 7-amino-4-methylcoumarin (AMC) upon cleavage by the enzyme and enables monitoring of the rate of enzymatic hydrolysis. The hydrazides alone showed activity in the low micromolar range (Scheme 11). Hydrazide 41e (negative control) and the aldehydes were found to be weak inhibitors of \u03b2-tryptase (IC50 > 1000 and > 10,000 \u03bcM, respectively). Using the same assay, the activity of the enzyme in the pre-equilibrated sublibraries was determined and compared with the full library (building block concentration of 1.25 \u03bcM each) (Fig. 4A\n). The inhibition assay showed that hydrazides 41a\u2013d are required for efficient enzyme inhibition. Hydrazide 41c was shown to be the most active building block. When it was removed, 47% of the enzyme activity was restored compared with the full library. Hydrazides 41a and 41b are of similar activity but less active than 41c. Hydrazide 41d is the least active with approximately 13% of recovery. Hydrazide 41e (negative control) shows a negative normalized activity, showing that inhibitory activity is increased when 41e is not included in the DCL. This was expected, since the relative concentration of active inhibitors increased. Regarding the aldehyde building blocks, trialdehyde 40e emerged as the most active one. Dialdehydes 40a\u2013d show much smaller inhibitory effects (0\u201310% recovery when removed from the DCL). To further study the role of the aldehydes, a second library containing all five aldehydes and the most active hydrazide 41c and the corresponding sublibraries without one of the aldehydes were generated (Fig. 4B). The results confirmed that aldehydes 40c and 40e are the most active building blocks for hydrazide 41c. Removal of hydrazide 41c completely restores the activity of the enzyme, confirming that the aldehydes alone do not inhibit \u03b2-tryptase.",

All individually synthesized acylhydrazones are inhibitors of \u03b2-tryptase with K\ni values in the low nanomolar range, which is three orders of magnitude more potent than the individual hydrazides. The two most active inhibitors 40e-41a and 40e-41c display K\ni values of 12 and 22 nM, respectively. Using a Dixon plot, it was verified that the compounds act as noncompetitive inhibitors, in which case K\ni is the same as the IC50 value. Negative control 40e-41e showed no inhibition of the protein at all. Interestingly, individual hydrazides 41c and 41d, with a slightly different peptide structure, showed similar activity (Table 6), while acylhydrazones 40e-41c and 40e-41d showed different K\ni values and different inhibition profiles (single mode for 40e-41c vs biphasic behavior for 40e-41d). These differences are likely caused by differences in binding mode, caused by the change in position of the guanidiniocarbonyl pyrrole group. Molecular-mechanics calculations indicated that the inhibitors bind to two different types of binding sites on the protein surface. Inhibitor 40e-41c blocks the pore completely, while 40e-41d does so only partially, resulting in weaker inhibition of the enzyme. Additionally, to the pore-blocking ability, 40e-41d is \u223c 36 kJ mol\u2212 1 lower in energy in its unbound state than constitutional isomer 40e-41c, presumably due to more favorable stabilizing intramolecular interactions. The complex of \u03b2-tryptase and 40e-41c is predicted to be 33 kJ mol\u2212 1 more stable than the complex with 40e-41d. This might suggest that the improved inhibitory activity of 40e-41c originates from a combination of stronger binding to the protein in a slightly different binding mode and the less stable ground-state conformation of the inhibitor itself.",

As a starting point, fragment 42 was chosen based on its favorable H-bond interactions between its amidine group and the catalytic dyad, promising physicochemical properties and the fact that it only contains 13 heavy atoms.44 Fragment 42 occupies the S2 and part of the S1 and S1\u2032 pockets of endothiapepsin and makes interactions with the catalytic dyad through charged H-bonding interactions. As shown in one of our previous studies, an acylhydrazone moiety is a suitable scaffold to address the catalytic dyad of endothiapepsin.15 Therefore, in order to grow into the S1 and S3 pockets, an acylhydrazone linker was proposed. Based on molecular-modeling and docking studies, a series of nine potential acylhydrazone-based inhibitors were selected, corresponding to hydrazide 43 and aldehydes 44a\u2013i (Scheme 12A\n). Nine DCLs, each containing hydrazide 43 and one of the nine aldehydes 44a\u2013i, were generated to form the corresponding acylhydrazones 45a\u2013i. A fluorescence-based enzymatic assay was used with a fluorogenic substrate (2-aminobenzoyl-Thr-Ile-Nle-Phe(p-NO2)-Gln-Arg-NH2, 46). Hydrolysis by endothiapepsin of the fluorogenic peptide, affording fragments 47 and 48, leads to an increase in fluorescence (Scheme 12B), allowing monitoring of enzyme inhibition by fluorescence spectroscopy (Fig. 5\n). Analysis revealed two DCLs displaying considerably higher inhibition of endothiapepsin than 42 (45% inhibition at 1 mM), namely, 43\n + \n44a (75% inhibition and IC50\n = 407 \u03bcM) and 43\n + \n44g (79% inhibition and IC50\n = 252 \u03bcM). Since full conversion to the corresponding acylhydrazone is not ensured and hydrazide 43 is used in excess, the IC50 values are expected to be lower for individually synthesized, isolated, and purified compounds. Therefore, both identified acylhydrazone hits were synthesized and purified. After analysis by the same fluorescence assay, IC50 values of 210 \u00b1 32 \u03bcM and 85 \u00b1 8 \u03bcM were obtained for 45a and 45g, respectively. Overall, it was shown that the combination of fragment growing and DCC is a powerful technique to generate novel hits for the aspartic protease endothiapepsin. The fluorescence-based assay enables direct screening of the DCLs for active inhibitors.",

After a control experiment with LC\u2013MS, which confirmed that all 30 possible products were formed in the DCL, individual crystals of CDK2 were soaked in reaction solutions containing monomer 49e and one of the isatin monomers 50a\u2013e. In all cases, except for one (49e\n + \n50d), the resulting electron density in the ATP pocket indicated that the corresponding ligand had bound. After synthesis and purification of each ligand, a CDK2 activity assay showed that each of the ligands binding to CDK2 was a potent enzyme inhibitor (IC50\n = 30 nM for each binding ligand). Then, in order to explore the potential of the X-ray crystallography method, soaking experiments of two DCLs containing 50b\n + \n49a\u2013d, 50b\n + \n49a\u2013f, and CDK2 crystals led to the observation of electron density only in the latter case corresponding to hydrazone 49e-50b. Subsequently, the complete DCL consisting of hydrazines 49a\u2013f and isatins 50a\u2013e was analyzed in the presence of CDK2. Electron density in the ATP-binding pocket confirmed 49e-50b as a potent inhibitor, clearly demonstrating that X-ray crystallography is an efficient and powerful method for the direct identification of binders from DCLs while also providing details on the binding mode.",

This cysteine can be a naturally occurring one or it can be selectively installed using site-directed mutagenesis. If a compound has (weak) affinity for the protein, the disulfide bond will be entropically stabilized, and the equilibrium will shift toward the modified protein. A DCL can be formed from disulfide ligands and the protein target in the presence of a reducing agent, such as \u03b2-mercaptoethanol. The reducing conditions in the DCL promote rapid thiol exchange. After equilibration, the DCL can be analyzed by MS, as long as the potential binders have unique molecular weights. More recently, fluorescence-polarization assays were used to detect displacement of a peptide ligand from the protein target as indirect readout of disulfide formation.52 Tethering was first reported in 2000 by Wells and coworkers.49 As model system, the anticancer and anti-infective drug target thymidylate synthase (TS) was chosen. Libraries containing 8\u201315 disulfide-containing compounds were added to protein-containing buffer in the presence of \u03b2-mercaptoethanol. After equilibration, analysis was performed by LC\u2013MS, and the multiply charged ions arising from the protein were deconvoluted to afford the mass of the modified protein. After screening a total of 1200 compounds, some highly significant structure\u2013activity relationships were observed. Disulfide-linked N-tosyl-d-proline (51, Scheme 13\n) was found to bind strongly to TS, and the tosyl group was found to bind approximately in the same position and orientation as methylenetetrahydrofolate, the natural cofactor for TS. Therefore, the glutamate residue from the cofactor was grafted onto the methyl group of N-tosyl-d-proline, affording 52. The modified N-tosyl-d-proline (K\ni\n = 24 \u00b1 7 \u03bcM) showed an almost 50-fold higher activity than N-tosyl-d-proline alone (K\ni\n = 1.1 \u00b1 0.25 mM). The introduction of an ethylene linker (53) increased the activity even more, obtaining a K\ni value of 330 \u00b1 40 nM.",

Wang et al. succeeded in obtaining the X-ray crystal structure of the co-activator GACKIX domain by taking advantage of this strategy.53 The GACKIX domain of the co-activator CBP/p300 consists of 90 amino acids and is known to interact with > 10 distinct amphipathic sequences at two distinct binding sites. When activated, it stimulates transcription of hundreds of genes, including those regulating hematopoiesis, memory formation, and the inflammatory response. The flexibility of this class of proteins makes characterization by crystallography impossible, either in complex with a binding partner or alone. Mapp and coworkers applied the tethering strategy to screen for small ligands that interact with the GACKIX domain. A leucine residue at the rim of the binding surface was mutated to a cysteine, affording GACKIX L664C. A fragment library comprising 480 disulfides was screened in a high-throughput format using a MS assay. Fragments 54 and 55 emerged from the screen with high tethering efficiency to GACKIX L664C (Scheme 14\n). After characterizing the binding properties of the ligands, a selenomethionine-incorporated GACKIX L664C tethered to 54 was crystallized, and the structure of this conformationally dynamic protein was solved by X-ray crystallography.",

It allows the in situ synthesis and amplification of new binders by the protein target. Combined with efficient screening methods, protein-templated DCC holds the potential to accelerate the drug-discovery process significantly. Nowadays, a whole range of analytical methods has been developed, such as HPLC, LC\u2013MS, and SEC to separate the different members of a DCL and X-ray spectroscopy, NMR, and MS to characterize binders of the protein target (Table 8\n). A major bottleneck of DCC, however, is the analysis of the DCLs, and so far, most reported examples use libraries of only small to moderate size. These limitations have to be addressed in order to allow the use of larger and more complex libraries, which will transform DCC into an even more efficient and widely used tool in medicinal chemistry. Furthermore, expanding the list of biocompatible, reversible reactions will give access to new potential binders and more structural diversity. It will also facilitate the development of doubly dynamic systems, in which fragments for two different pockets of the active site of an enzyme are screened simultaneously.54 For these types of systems, comparable reactivity at a certain pH is required, which should also be in line with the stability of the protein target.",
