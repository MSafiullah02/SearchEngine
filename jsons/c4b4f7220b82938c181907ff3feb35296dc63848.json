The viral RNA-dependent-RNA-polymerase (RdRp) is a promising target with polymerase inhibitors successfully used for the treatment of several viral diseases. Here we show that Favipiravir exerts an antiviral effect as a nucleotide analogue through a combination of chain termination, slowed RNA synthesis and lethal mutagenesis. The SARS-CoV RdRp 25 complex is at least 10-fold more active than any other viral RdRp known. It possesses both unusually high nucleotide incorporation rates and high-error rates allowing facile insertion of Favipiravir into viral RNA, provoking C-to-U and G-to-A transitions in the already low cytosine content SARS-CoV-2 genome. The coronavirus RdRp complex represents an Achilles heel for SARS-CoV, supporting nucleoside analogues as promising candidates for the treatment of 30 COVID-19.",

            "text": "2 Coronaviruses (CoV) are large genome, positive-strand RNA viruses of the order 35 Nidovirales that have recently attracted global attention due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Despite significant efforts to control its spread, SARS-CoV-2 has caused substantial health and economic burden, emphasizing the immediate need for antiviral treatments. As with all positive strand RNA viruses, an RdRp lies at the core of the viral replication machinery and for CoVs this is the nsp12 protein. The pivotal role of nsp12 in the viral life-cycle, lack of host 40 homologues and high level of sequence and structural conservation makes it an optimal target for therapeutics. However, there has been remarkably little biochemical characterization of nsp12 and a lack of fundamental data to guide the design of antiviral therapeutics and study their mechanism of action (MoA). A promising class of RdRp inhibitors are nucleoside analogues (NAs), small molecule drugs that are metabolized intracellularly into their active ribonucleoside 45 5'-triphosphate (RTP) forms and incorporated into the nascent viral RNA by error-prone viral RdRps. This can disrupt RNA synthesis directly via chain termination, or can lead to the accumulation of deleterious mutations in the viral genome. For CoVs, the situation is complicated by the post-replicative repair capacity provided by the nsp14 exonuclease (ExoN) that is essential for maintaining the integrity of their large ~30 kb genomes 1-3 . Nsp14 has been 50 shown to remove certain NAs after insertion by the RdRp into the nascent RNA, thus reducing their antiviral effects 4-6 . Despite this, several NAs currently being used for the treatment of other viral infections have been identified as potential anti-CoV candidates 7-9 . Among these is the purine base analogue T-705 (Favipiravir, Avigan, Extended data Fig. 1a,b) that has broadspectrum activity against a number of RNA viruses and is currently licensed in Japan for use in 55",

Associated with this increase in mutation frequency, T-705 has an antiviral effect on SARS-CoV-2, as illustrated by a reduction in virus-induced cytopathic effect, viral RNA copy number, and infectious particle yield. Altogether these observations show that the mutagenic effect 70 induced by T-705 is, at least in part, responsible for the inhibition of the replication.",

            "text": "To determine the efficacy and MoA of T-705 against SARS-CoV we first characterized nsp12 primer-dependent activity using traditional annealed primer-template (PT) and selfpriming hairpin (HP) RNAs that may confer additional stability on the elongation complex (Extended data Fig. 1c ). Consistent with prior findings, nsp12 alone is essentially inactive 13,14 75 and RNA synthesis requires the presence nsp7 and 8 cofactors whose stimulatory effect is enhanced by linking them as a nsp7L8 fusion protein 6, 15 . Structures of nsp12 show a fourcomponent complex with a nsp7/nsp8 heterodimer and an additional nsp8 monomer 16, 17 and accordingly we found that addition of supplementary nsp8 to the nsp12:nsp7L8 complex further increases activity (Extended data Fig. 2 ). The resulting nsp12:7L8:8 complex is highly active on 80 both PT and HP RNAs, with reactions containing 0.2 \u00b5M of each substrate and 1 \u00b5M nsp12 showing comparable initiation rates, with a rapid burst phase resulting in >50% primer consumption followed by remaining primer use over a period of a few minutes (Fig. 2a , Extended data Fig. 3 ). Interestingly however, the apparent processivity for the two substrates differs substantially. When provided with an annealed PT pair, intermediate products account for 85 ~60% of the total lane intensity across all timepoints suggesting distributive polymerase activity ( Fig. 2a , Extended data Fig. 4 ). In contrast, extension of a HP substrate has few intermediate products, indicating a processive elongation mode. This pattern is consistently observed across RNA substrates of different lengths, showing that the distributive PT mode does not convert into a processive state within a 30-nucleotide long template. Notably, the Nidovirales RNA 90 replication/transcription scheme involves precise recombination-like events to generate subgenomic RNAs through a discontinuous mechanism along the ~30,000 nt genome 18 . The different processivities and complex stabilities we observe may be connected to these peculiar RNA synthesis events.",

In 105 reactions with 10 \u00b5M T-1105-RTP, multiple incorporation events are seen within 10 seconds, while T-705-RTP is less efficient. Neither compound is incorporated in the place of cytosine or uracil, clearly showing they function as purine analogues (Extended data Fig. 5 ). For the processive HP complex, efficient incorporation and elongation occurs opposite both uracil and cytosine, resulting in rapid accumulation of full-length products, advocating for lethal 110 mutagenesis as the MoA for these compounds (Fig. 2c) . Interestingly, the PT substrate reveals a striking difference in the MoA depending on whether the analogues are incorporated in place of guanine or adenine. Opposite uracil, both are rapidly incorporated but further extension is slow and inefficient, leading to an accumulation of RNA products consistent with a non-obligate chain termination mechanism. The presence of a non-natural 3' nucleotide analogue may destabilize 115 the complex and promote template dissociation. In contrast, opposite cytosine there is a stall before each analogue incorporation step, but elongation past the analogue is rapid, even at consecutive sites. More full-length product is observed in these no-GTP experiments, suggesting both compounds are more efficient as guanosine analogues. A similar observation has been made for the poliovirus RdRp that efficiently incorporated and bypassed T-1105 opposite cytosine but 120 was prone to pausing opposite uridine. These pause events were attributed to RdRp backtracking, which was therefore assigned the primary cause of the inhibitory activity 28 . We conclude that for nsp12 the T-705/T-1105 MoA is a combination of chain termination, slowed RNA synthesis and lethal mutagenesis, dictated by the structural and functional properties of both the polymerase and the RNA. 125 The reactions performed without ATP also showed detectable amounts of GTP:U mismatch products, allowing us to make a direct comparison of the T-1105 incorporation rate with that of a natural GTP:U mismatch (Extended data Fig. 6 ). Reactions using 50 \u00b5M GTP and 1 \u00b5M T-1105-RTP show ~5-fold more T-1105:U produced relative to GTP:U. Considering the concentration difference, T-1105 incorporation is calculated to be ~250-fold more efficient than 130 the native GTP mismatch, the most common naturally occurring transition mutation. These high incorporation rates likely overwhelm the CoV error-correcting mechanisms, consistent with our infectious virus data, although it remains to be determined if nsp14 can excise T-705/T-1105, as is the case for ribavirin and 5-fluorouracil 4,6,29 .",

Viral RdRps use an electrostatic interaction with an arginine residue in motif F to position the NTP during catalysis 31 . For most positive strand RNA virus polymerases, this arginine is stabilized by a salt bridge to a glutamic acid residue, also from motif F. Notably, the CoV nsp12 has an alanine in place of this glutamate (A547) and as a result, the arginine (R555) is not rigidly anchored above the active site ( Fig. 4a ) 31, 39 . This flexibility could allow catalysis to 175 occur with a relaxed triphosphate positioning, decreasing fidelity by lowering the requirement for strict Watson-Crick base pairing in the active site. Interestingly, the CoV and other largegenome nidoviral polymerases also have an SDD rather than a more typical GDD sequence in the palm domain of motif C (Fig. 4b ). This serine residue can hydrogen bond with the 2' hydroxyl of the priming nucleotide, theoretically stabilizing the position of the primer in the 180 active site and compensating for the less rigid interactions with the bound NTP. These unique features have likely played a central role in genome expansion and stability by providing a fast RNA synthesis machinery whose inaccuracy is mitigated by the presence of an RNA repair exonuclease.

This is presumably due to a UTP:G 375 mismatch to yield the +8 product in the absence of CTP, followed by a cognate ATP:U addition that is slow because it is priming on a mismatched base pair. For the HP substrate, we were unable to definitively identify the gel migration bands for the +6 and +7 species and therefore did not model individual rates for these incorporation events. Data from the HP RNAs are can be challenging to analyze because the high thermodynamic stability of the folded RNA structure 380 can make it difficult to fully denature the helix during electrophoresis.

For the infectivity test cells and compound were prepared as described above (EC50 determination) with only three 2-fold serial dilutions of T-705 (125\u00b5M to 500\u00b5M, in 435 triplicate). Three virus control wells were supplemented with 25 \u00b5L of assay medium. The experiment was conducted as previously described for the EC50 determination. At day 3 the supernatant was collected and each triplicate was titrated by measuring the 50 % tissue culture infectivity dose (TCID 50 ); briefly, 3 replicates were infected with 100 \u00b5L of tenfold serial dilutions of the previous supernatant, and incubated for 3 days. CPE was measured by CellTiter- 440 Blue\u00ae reagent (Promega) and TCID50 was calculated and expressed as TCID 50 /mL based on the Reed and Muench (43) . Antiviral experiments data were analyzed using GraphPad Prism 7 software (Graph pad software). Graphical representations were also performed on GraphPad Prism 7 software.",

PCR products were pooled at equimolar proportions. After Qubit quantification using Qubit\u00ae dsDNA HS Assay Kit and Qubit 2.0 fluorometer (ThermoFisher 450 Scientific) amplicons were fragmented by sonication in ~200bp long fragments. Libraries were built adding barcodes for sample identification to the fragmented DNA using AB Library Builder System (ThermoFisher Scientific). To pool the barcoded samples at equimolar ratio a quantification step by real time PCR using Ion Library TaqMan\u2122 Quantitation Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific) was realised. An emulsion PCR of the pools and loading on 530 chip was 455 realised using the automated Ion Chef instrument (ThermoFisher). Sequencing was performed using the S5 Ion torrent technology v5.12 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) following manufacturer's instructions. Consensus sequence was obtained after trimming of reads (reads with quality score <0.99, and length <100pb were removed and the 30 first and 30 last nucleotides were removed from the reads) mapping of the reads on a reference (determined following Blast of De Novo 460 contigs) using CLC genomics workbench software v.20 (Qiagen). A de novo contig was also produced to ensure that the consensus sequence was not affected by the reference sequence. Quasi species with frequency over 0.1% were studied.",
