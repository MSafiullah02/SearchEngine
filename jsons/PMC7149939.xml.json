Disease-causing microorganisms are called pathogens. Infection is the process in which the microorganism multiplies or grows in or on the host. Infection does not necessarily result in disease, since it is possible for the organism to grow in or on the host without producing an illness (see Chapter 23). In the case of enteric infections (i.e., diarrhea) caused by Salmonella, only half of the individuals infected develop clinical signs of illness. A frank pathogen is a microorganism capable of producing disease in both normal healthy and immunocompromised persons. Opportunistic pathogens are usually capable of causing infections only in immunocompromised individuals such as burn patients, patients taking antibiotics, those with impaired immune systems or elderly patients with diabetes. Opportunistic pathogens are common in the environment, and may be present in the human gut or skin without causing disease.",

The time between infection and the appearance of clinical signs and symptoms (diarrhea, fever, rash, etc.) is the incubation time (Table 22.1\n). This may range from as short as 6 to 12 hours in the case of norovirus diarrhea, or up to 30 to 60 days for hepatitis A virus, which causes liver disease. At any time during infection the pathogen may be released into the environment by the host in feces, urine or respiratory secretions. Although the maximum release may occur at the height of the disease, it can also precede the first signs of clinical illness. In the case of hepatitis A virus, the maximum excretion in the feces occurs before the onset of signs of clinical illness. The concentration of organisms released into the environment varies with the type of organism and the route of transmission (Table 22.2\n). The concentration of enteric viruses during gastroenteritis may be as high as 1010\u20131012 per gram of feces.",

Many human pathogens can only be transmitted by direct or close contact with an infected person or animal. Examples include the herpes virus, Neisseria gonorrhoeae (gonorrhea) and Treponema pallidum\n(syphilis). This is because their survival time outside the host is very brief. Pathogens transmitted through the environment may survive from hours to years outside the host, depending on the organism and the environment. Pathogens may exit a host in respiratory secretions from the nose and mouth, or be shed on dead skin or in feces, urine, saliva or tears. Thus, they may contaminate the air, water, food, or inanimate objects (fomites) (see Chapter 30). When contaminated air is inhaled or food consumed, the organisms are effectively transmitted to another host, where the infection process begins again. Airborne transmission can occur via release from the host in droplets (i.e., coughing) or through natural (surf at a beach) or human activities (cooling towers, showers) (see Chapter 5). Some organisms may be carried great distances, hundreds of meters or miles (e.g., Legionnaires\u2019 disease and foot-and-mouth disease). Virus transmission by the airborne route may be both direct and indirect. Infection of a host may be by direct inhalation of infectious droplets, or through contact with fomites on which the airborne droplets have settled. Hand or mouth contact with the organism on the surface of a fomite results in the transfer of the organism to the portal of entry, i.e., nose, mouth or eye.",

In fact, the control of these classic diseases illustrates the importance of water supply treatment which played an important role in the reduction of infectious diseases. Other diseases caused by bacteria, viruses, protozoa and helminths may also be transmitted by contaminated drinking water.

During the Civil War (1861\u20131865), encamped soldiers often disposed of the waste upriver, but drew drinking water from downriver. This practice resulted in widespread dysentery. In fact, dysentery, together with its sister disease, typhoid fever (Salmonella typhi), was the leading cause of death among soldiers of all armies until the 20th century. It was not until the end of the 19th century that this state of affairs began to change. At that time, the germ theory was generally accepted, and steps were taken to treat wastes properly, and protect drinking water and food supplies.",

Because of these new practices, the national typhoid death rate in the United States between 1900 and 1928 dropped from 36 to five cases per 100,000 people. The lower death toll was largely the result of a reduced number of outbreaks of waterborne diseases. In Cincinnati, for instance, the yearly typhoid rate of 379 per 100,000 people in the years 1905\u20131907 decreased to 60 per 100,000 people between 1908 and 1910, following the inception of sedimentation and filtration treatment of drinking water.

Following an incubation period of 10\u201372 hours, symptoms including cramping, vomiting, diarrhea (may be profuse), prostration and dehydration occur. The illness usually lasts less than 3 to 5 days. Disease is caused by two toxins, one the heat-labile toxin and the other the heat-stable toxin. The ETEC E. coli are usually species specific; that is, humans are the reservoir for the strains causing diarrhea in humans. Only a few outbreaks have been documented in the United States. Conservative estimates suggest that each year, approximately 210 million cases and 380,000 deaths occur (Wenneras and Erling, 2004). EPEC is the oldest recognized category of diarrhea-causing E. coli. Diarrheal disease caused by this group of E. coli is virtually confined to infants less than 1 year of age. It is associated with infant summer diarrhea, outbreaks of diarrhea in nurseries and community epidemics of infant diarrhea. Symptoms include watery diarrhea with mucus, fever and dehydration. The diarrhea can be severe and prolonged with a high fatality rate (as high as 50%). Since the 1960s, EPEC has largely disappeared as an important cause of infant diarrhea in North America and Europe. However, it remains a major agent of infant diarrhea in South America, Africa and Asia. Humans, cattle and pigs can be infected by this organism.

Shigella very rarely occurs in animals. It is principally a disease of humans and occasionally of other primates such as monkeys and chimpanzees. The organism is often found in water polluted with human sewage, and is transmitted by the fecal\u2013oral route. Shigella has been a common cause of waterborne recreational outbreaks in the United States. However, most cases of shigellosis are the result of person-to-erson transmission through the fecal\u2013oral route. Secondary attack rates are 20\u201340% of household contacts. An estimated 440,000 cases of shigellosis occur annually in the United States (Gupta et al., 2004). Shigella is associated with certain foods such as salads, raw vegetables, milk and dairy products, and poultry. After an onset time of 12 hours to 1 week, symptoms of abdominal pain, cramps, diarrhea and vomiting may occur. The organisms multiply in the cells of the gastrointestinal tract and spread to neighboring cells, resulting in tissue destruction. Some infections are associated with ulceration, rectal bleeding and drastic dehydration, with fatality rates as high as 10\u201315%. Infants, the elderly and the infirm are most susceptible.",

At least 40 species of Legionella have been shown to cause disease, but the most prominent pathogenic species is L. pneumophila, which first received extensive attention after an outbreak in 1976 in Philadelphia. The disease is found worldwide, with most sporadic cases occurring during the summer and fall months. The reservoir is primarily aquatic. Hot water systems, air-conditioning cooling towers and evaporative condensers have all been implicated in outbreaks, as have decorative fountain and retail store misters (Figure 22.5\n). The organism has also been found in creeks and ponds, and the soil from their banks. The bacterium survives for months in tap and distilled water. The primary route of transmission is thought to be through the inhalation of aerosols. Exposure is not uncommon, as reflected in serologic assays that show that 1\u201320% of the general population have antibodies to L. pneumophila.\n",

These bacteria can multiply in water that is oligotrophic (Falcao et al., 1993) or essentially free of nutrients, including dialysis water, and they are relatively resistant to disinfection by chlorination and chloramines (Collins et al., 1984). Atypical mycobacteria are widespread in water environments. Mycobacteria have been isolated from 11 to 38% of raw water samples at concentrations of <0.1\u201348 CFU/ml.

Once ingested, it passes through the stomach and into the upper intestine. The increase in acidity via passage through the stomach stimulates the cyst to excyst, which releases two trophozoites into the upper intestine. The trophozoites (Figure 22.10\n) attach to the epithelial cells of the small intestine. It is believed that the trophozoites use their sucking disks to adhere to epithelial cells. The adherence to the cells flattens the villi, causing malabsorption and diarrhea by not allowing adsorption of water and nutrients across the intestine. This can cause both acute and chronic diarrhea within 1\u20134 weeks of ingestion of cysts resulting in foul-smelling, loose and greasy stools. Once the trophozoites detach from the epithelial cells and travel down the intestine, cholesterol starvation is believed to stimulate the trophozoites to encyst and pass back into the environment as a cyst. Giardiasis can be treated with metronidazole (Flagyl) or nitazoxanide. Although in some cases the symptoms will spontaneously disappear without treatment, in most cases without treatment the symptoms will wax and wane for many months. In symptomatic patients, more trophozoites than cysts are excreted into the feces and cannot withstand the harshness outside the human body. In asymptomatic humans, mostly cysts are passed in stools; therefore Giardia carriers can serve as a source of cysts in the environment.",

Various other animals found to be infected are cattle, goats, sheep, pigs, cats and dogs (Erlandsen, 1995). To date, no infections with G. lamblia in humans have been directly linked to an animal host, but there is evidence that suggests that animal-source Giardia could potentially infect humans.

It was not identified as a human pathogen until 1976, when it was described in the stools of immunocompromised hosts. Since that time, there have been several waterborne outbreaks, the most notable being the Milwaukee outbreak in April 1993, which infected over 400,000 people (MacKenzie et al., 1994) and killed more than 50 (Case Study 22.1\n).Case Study 22.1Cryptosporidiosis in MilwaukeeEarly in the spring of 1993, heavy rains flooded the rich agricultural plains of Wisconsin. These rains produced an abnormal runoff into a river that drains into Lake Michigan, from which the city of Milwaukee obtains its drinking water. The city\u2019s water treatment plant seemed able to handle the extra load: it had never failed before, and all existing water quality standards for drinking water were properly met. Nevertheless, by April 1, thousands of Milwaukee residents came down with acute watery diarrhea, often accompanied by abdominal cramping, nausea, vomiting, and fever. In a short period of time, more than 400,000 people developed gastroenteritis, and more than 100\u2014mostly elderly and infirm individuals\u2014ultimately died, despite the best efforts of modern medical care. Finally, after much testing, it was discovered that Cryptosporidium oocysts were present in the finished drinking water after treatment. These findings pointed to the water supply as the likely source of infection; and on the evening of April 7, the city put out an urgent advisory for residents to boil their water. This measure effectively ended the outbreak. All told, direct costs and costs associated with loss of life are believed to have exceeded $150 million.The Milwaukee episode was the largest waterborne outbreak of disease ever documented in the United States. But what happened? How could such a massive outbreak occur in a modern U.S. city in the 1990s? And how could so many people die? Apparently, high concentrations of suspended matter and oocysts in the raw water resulted in failure of the water treatment process\u2014a failure in which Cryptosporidium oocysts passed right through the filtration system in one of the city\u2019s water treatment plants, thereby affecting a large segment of the population. And among this general population were some whose systems could not withstand the resulting illness. In immunocompetent people, Cryptosporidiosis is a self-limiting illness; it is very uncomfortable, but it goes away of its own accord. However, in the immunocompromised, Cryptosporidiosis can be unrelenting and fatal.",

The most common species infecting humans is C. hominis, which infects only humans, and C. parvum, which primarily infects cattle, but also humans. Cryptosporidium hominis has a complex life cycle involving both sexual and asexual stages (Figure 22.11\n). The host ingests sporulated oocysts (ranging from 3 to 6 \u03bcm in diameter) from contaminated water, food or direct contact (Figure 22.12\n). In the small intestine, the oocyst excysts, releasing four sporozoites, which attach to the epithelial cells of the mucosa. The sporozoite becomes enveloped by the microvilli, which fuse and elongate to cover the sporozoite. The sporozoite then\nmatures into a trophozoite and into a schizont. The schizont, an asexual reproductive form in which multiple mitosis occurs followed by cytokinesis, results in eight first-generation merozoites. The cell ruptures, releasing the merozoites, which then infect neighboring epithelial cells, and schizogony occurs again, but forming only four second-generation merozoites. When the cell ruptures, the merozoites attach to uninfected epithelial cells and form either macrogametocytes or microgametocytes. The macrogametocytes and microgametocytes further divide, and form macrogametes and microgametes, respectively. They join, forming a zygote, which differentiates to form the unsporulated oocyst, which is then expelled from the cell surface, sporulates, and is shed in the host\u2019s feces.",

The world prevalence exceeds 500 million infections with more than 40,000 deaths each year. The protozoan only infects humans. There are two sizes of cysts, small (5\u20139 \u03bcm) and large (10\u201320 \u03bcm), with each cyst producing eight trophozoites in the host. Only the larger cyst has been associated with disease; the smaller cyst tends to be associated with a commensal lifestyle (the organism benefits from the host, while the host is unaffected). About 2\u20138% of people infected develop invasive amoebic dysentery in which the trophozoites actively invade the intestinal wall, bloodstream and liver. It is unknown why this occurs. This organism is generally a problem in developing countries where sanitation is substandard, and is transmitted via contaminated food and water. Humans are the main reservoir, although pigs, monkeys and dogs have also been found to serve as reservoirs. No waterborne outbreaks have occurred in the United States since 1984. Entamoeba is not as resistant to disinfectants as Giardia and Cryptosporidium, and is easily removed during water treatment.",

Infections are usually associated with children swimming in natural springs or warm waters, although they are rare in the United States. There have been four cases associated with drinking water in the United States: in Arizona and Louisiana. The flagellate swims into the nose of a host and sheds its flagella (or it may be forced into the nose via diving). The amoeba then follows the nerves to the brain, producing a toxin that liquefies the brain. The organisms do not form cysts in the host. Primary amoebic meningoencephalitis (PAM) develops, causing severe, massive headaches. Death usually follows 4\u20136 days later. Diagnosis is most frequently postmortem upon brain examination.

E. intestinalis spores have been identified in sewage, surface and ground waters, supporting the notion of environmental transmission. The spores are highly resistant to heat inactivation and drying.

E. bieneusi causes diarrhea and wasting disease. It is the most important cause of microsporidiosis in AIDS patients. Several surveys have determined that 7 to 30% of AIDS patients who have unexplained chronic diarrhea are infected with E. bieneusi (Weber et al., 1994). E. intestinalis is similar to E. bieneusi in that it infects the intestines and causes diarrhea, but it can also infect kidneys and bronchial and nasal cells. It can infect macrophages, which allows it to disseminate throughout the body. It is secreted in feces and urine, which supports the notion of water transmission. E. cuniculi is not an intestinal parasite but it can be shed in urine (Zeman and Baskin, 1985), and therefore environmental transmission is a possibility. It has also been described infecting many different mammals, which means that there could be many animal reservoirs that can contaminate the environment. E. hellem has been recognized and shown to cause eye infections (keratoconjunctivitis) and disseminated infections such as ureteritis and pneumonia. It does not invade the intestine, but it can be shed in the urine (Schwartz et al., 1994). Both water- and foodborne outbreaks have been documented (Cotte et al., 1999, Decraene et al., 2012).",

            "text": "\nToxoplasma gondii, the causative agent of toxoplasmosis, is an intestinal coccidium of felines with a very wide range of intermediate hosts. T. gondii causes a wide range of clinical conditions including brain damage in children, lymphadenopathy, ocular disease and encephalitis. In the immunocompetent adult it causes symptoms that could be mistaken for influenza. It is estimated that 13% of the world\u2019s population is infected with T. gondii (Hughes, 1985). Acquisition of the organism can be through contact with infected undercooked meat containing a bradyzoite (tissue cyst), and through contact with the environmental stage, the oocysts. The oocyst is excreted only in cat feces (domestic and wild) (Figure 22.15\n). Congenital infection occurs when a pregnant woman becomes infected for the first time. Once infected, tachyzoites can cross the placenta and infect the fetus. Of the fetuses that become infected, 15% have severe complications. The oocysts can persist in soil and water, which can serve as a route of transmission. One study in England found that 100% of wild cats had antibodies to T. gondii (McOrist et al., 1991). Various studies of cats in the United States have found a seropositive prevalence of approximately 40% (Dubey and Beattie, 1988). The high prevalence of T. gondii in the cat population demonstrates that felines can be a significant source of oocysts in the environment. The oocyst can survive 18 months in the soil (\u221220 to 33\u00b0C) in Kansas (Frenkel et al., 1975) and over 410 days in water (Yilmaz and Hopkins, 1972).",

They travel via pulmonary circulation to the liver and heart, where the larvae develop into third-stage organisms that can lodge in the alveolar space (Figure 22.18\n). This migration through the lungs can cause pneumonitis (Loeffler\u2019s syndrome). The immature worms leave the lungs and travel through the bronchi, trachea and epiglottis. They are then swallowed and arrive in the small intestine. There they undergo two molts, mate and produce eggs. There is medical treatment against the adult intestinal worm: mebendazole or pyrantel pamoate. Symptoms usually correspond to the worm load, and a heavy worm load can lead to intestinal blockage. The adult worm can reach more than 30 cm in size. Although most infections are mild, more than 20,000 people die annually with complications caused by intestinal blockage (Freedman, 1992).",

It is present in every country where beef is consumed (Figure 22.21\n). Cattle become infected from eating grass or soil contaminated with human waste containing gravid proglottids. This occurs in areas where night soil (human waste) is used as fertilizer. The proglottids can survive in the environment for weeks. One study found that they could survive 71 days in liquid manure, 16 days in untreated sewage and up to 159 days on grass (Jepsen and Roth, 1952). The eggs hatch in the duodenum, and hexacanths (tapeworm embryos containing six pairs of hooklets) are released. The hexacanths penetrate the mucosa, enter the intestine and travel throughout the body. They then enter muscle and form a cysticercus (larval tapeworm enclosed in a cyst), which becomes infective in a few months. Humans become infected when they eat undercooked beef containing such cysticerci. The cysticerci can be inactivated at 56\u00b0C or by freezing at \u22125\u00b0C for 1 week (Schmidt and Roberts, 1989). Within 2\u201312 weeks the worm begins shedding gravid proglottids. The average worm length is 10\u201315 feet. Symptoms of infection are abdominal pain, headache, nausea, diarrhea, intestinal blockage and loss of appetite (contrary to the belief that tape worms infections cause an increase in appetite). The infection can be diagnosed by examining a gravid proglottid or scolex. The best methods for prevention are sanitation (proper disposal of human wastes) and thorough cooking of beef.\n",

In addition, each parasitic stage involves different organs and thus different medical symptoms. The cercariae from infected snails are found in freshwater bodies. Once the cercariae penetrate the skin, they transform into the schistosomula, the first parasitic stage. This causes the disease cercarial dermatitis, which consists in immediate or delayed hypersensitivity to the penetration. After 1\u20132 days of living in the subcutaneous tissues, the schistomsomula migrate through the lungs to the liver. The organisms mature through this migration, developing into male or female adult worms. The adult worms then migrate to the circulatory system and to other organs. Each pair of adult worms live an average of 3\u201310 years and potentially up to 30 years (Lucey and Maguire, 1993). They also produce 300 eggs a day, only a percentage of which reach the lumen to be passed in the feces. Many of the eggs become trapped in the small blood vessels and tissues, causing granulomas and intestinal, visceral, liver and fibroobstructive diseases. The acute form of disease, Katayama fever, can occur in previously uninfected persons 2\u20136 weeks after exposure to cercariae-contaminated water.

There are currently more than 100 human enterovirus types known (Piralla et al., 2013). Enteroviruses replicate primarily in the gastrointestinal tract, and may be shed in large numbers (approximately 1010/g feces). The most common forms of transmission include the fecal\u2013oral and respiratory routes (Figure 22.23\n). Waterborne transmission may be considered a form of fecal\u2013oral transmission in which the responsible vehicle is water instead of hands or fomites. Although enteroviruses are readily found in fecally contaminated drinking or recreational waters, waterborne enterovirus infection has been only occasionally documented. Waterborne outbreaks related to enteroviruses are difficult to document because many infections by these agents are subclinical. Therefore, an individual with waterborne infection without overt disease may infect others, who in turn may become ill, spreading the infection further. Attack rates of enteroviruses vary depending on the virus and the host age. Asymptomatic infections by poliovirus outnumber symptomatic disease (10:1), whereas symptomatic infection by echovirus 9 is relatively high (10:7) (Morens and Pallansch, 1995).",

Fecal\u2013oral transmission may predominate in areas with poor sanitary conditions, whereas respiratory transmission may occur more often with better sanitation. In temperate climates, enteroviruses are more common during the summer season. In the United States, most enterovirus isolations (82%) occur from June to October. However, vaccine strains of poliovirus are isolated year-round because of routine vaccination of children. In contrast, in tropical and semitropical areas, enteroviruses do not show seasonality. Transmission of enteroviruses within a household is usually started by young children; then the infection spreads quickly to other family members, especially in larger families living under crowded conditions with poor hygiene. Paralytic poliomyelitis and perhaps some nonpolio enteroviral diseases are more often observed in developing countries, where sanitary conditions are improving. With poor hygiene, most individuals are infected at a very early age, when infection rarely results in overt disease and maternal immunity limits infection. This early exposure to the virus elicits a protective immune response on reexposure to these viruses later in life. In contrast, when early exposure is prevented or delayed as a result of better sanitation, an initial poliovirus infection is likely to occur at an older age, when maternal immunity has waned and the possibility of developing a more severe clinical condition is greater.",

The introduction of a vaccine for HAV has resulted in a steady decline in cases in the United States (see Case Study 22.2\n).Case Study 22.2A Massive Waterborne Outbreak of Infectious HepatitisApproximately 35,000 young adults in New Delhi, India came down with hepatitis in the fall of 1955. There were 73 deaths recorded among those affected, one of the largest viral water-borne outbreaks ever documented. New Delhi obtains its drinking water from the Jamuna River. Because of flooding following the monsoon season, water drawn from the river for treatment and distribution became heavily contaminated with sewage from a nearby creek. From November 11 to November 16, raw wastewater freely entered the drinking water treatment plant. The staff at the plant, aware of the contamination, increased the dose of alum coagulant and chlorine in an effort to eliminate contaminating pathogens. About three weeks later, the first hepatitis cases were identified. The observed incubation period ranged from 22 to 60 days, with an average of 40 days. Surprisingly, no increase in other types of viral, bacterial, or parasitic infections was observed during the hepatitis epidemic, possibly because of the partial success of emergency disinfection using high levels of chlorine.In an attempt to isolate the epidemic\u2019s causative agent, researchers at the Virus Research Center in Poona inoculated eight different cell lines with a variety of clinical specimens obtained from hepatitis patients. Unfortunately, no viruses were isolated from any of the samples tested. Although the etiologic agent was not identified, it was believed that the epidemic was caused by the hepatitis A virus (HAV). A retrospective study conducted in 1980 showed that the outbreak in New Delhi was not caused by HAV or hepatitis B virus (HBV) but by the so-called enterically transmitted non-A, non-B (ENANB) hepatitis virus. This agent was later renamed hepatitis E virus (HEV). Although waterborne outbreaks of hepatitis E have occurred in many regions of the world, outbreaks have almost exclusively been in developing countries. HEV waterborne outbreaks primarily affect young adults, and fatalities among pregnant women are not uncommon.The raw sewage contamination of drinking water that led to the large HEV outbreak in New Delhi was thought to be controlled by the use of high doses of alum coagulant and chlorine. Although this measure prevented an outbreak of bacterial, parasitic, and other enteric viral diseases, it failed to eliminate HEV. Therefore, prevention of contamination, rather than extensive treatment, offers the best alternative for safe drinking water.",

It has been suggested that the higher prevalence of HEV in adults may be due to a silent infection early in life, with subsequent waning of immunity after 10 to 20 years, when they again become susceptible to infection by HEV (Bradley, 1992). Important epidemiological features of HEV infection are the frequent occurrence of outbreaks associated with consumption of sewage-polluted water and its severity, particularly among pregnant women, in whom the case-fatality rate may be as high as 25% (Balayan, 1993).

Premature infants, children 6 months to 2 years of age, the elderly and the immunocompromised are particularly prone to develop more severe symptoms. In adults, rotaviral infection is usually subclinical. Each year rotavirus causes millions of cases of diarrhea in developing countries, almost 2 million resulting in hospitalization, and an estimated 453,000 resulting in the death of a child younger than 5 years, 85% of whom live in developing countries (Tate et al., 2012). The introduction of a vaccine for children has been reducing the number of serious cases of rotavirus in the United States. Rotavirus infection does not result in an efficient or long-lasting immunity. Therefore, rotavirus infection in the same child often occurs up to six times during childhood.",

Among these, viruses such as adenoviruses and rotaviruses are larger and well defined; thus, they are relatively easy to identify by EM. However, many smaller (20\u201340 nm) viruses without a distinctive morphology are often present in fecal samples of patients suffering from gastroenteritis (Figure 22.25\n). Norwalk virus was the first to be described (Kapikian et al., 1972). Subsequently, other small round viruses were observed in diarrheal stools, namely Montgomery County, Hawaii, Wollan, Ditchling, the Parramatta, the Cockle agents and minirotavirus. Norwalk-like viruses are in the calicivirus family, and are now divided into two genera which infect humans; Norovirus and Sapovirus. There are also several genera of caliciviruses that only infect animals. Norovirus are major causes of both food- and waterborne disease. It is estimated that 67% of the foodborne illness in the United States are caused by noroviruses (Gerba and Kayed, 2003). Caliciviruses are nonenveloped viruses with a diameter of approximately 26 to 35 nm and a positive-sense ssRNA genome.",

Two important characteristics differentiate rhinoviruses from enteroviruses: stability at low pH values and temperature. Whereas the rhinoviruses are inactivated at pH values below 6, the enteroviruses are stable at low pH values. In contrast, rhinoviruses are stable at temperatures (50\u00b0C) that would inactivate most enteroviruses (Couch, 1996). Human rhinoviruses have an icosahedral morphology, containing a single-stranded RNA genome. The diameter of these viruses is approximately 25 to 30 nm. Although no etiologic agent is identified in half of the acute upper respiratory illnesses, it has been estimated that 30 to 50% are caused by rhinoviruses. In fact, rhinovirus infection is probably the most common type of human acute infection (Gwaltney, 1997). The optimal temperature for rhinovirus growth is 33 to 35\u00b0C, which corresponds to the normal temperature of the nasal mucosa. This may explain why these viruses propagate most efficiently in the upper respiratory tract. These viruses can be propagated in monkey and human cell lines. There are more than 100 different human rhinovirus serotypes. Although these viruses are species specific, an equine rhinovirus can infect other species, including humans. Experimentally, chimpanzees and gibbons have been infected with human rhinoviruses, but these animals do not develop disease. Volunteer studies have shown that infection can be started with less than one tissue culture median infectious dose (TCID50).",

It is believed that contamination of objects in the environment may play a significant role in the transmission of rhinoviruses. This, and the ability of rhinoviruses to survive on human skin and on inanimate objects, may explain the more prevalent self-inoculation form of transmission. Both finger-to-eye and finger-to-nose contact are part of normal human behavior. Therefore, experimental rhinovirus transmission has been effectively interrupted by hand disinfection. Rhinoviruses are relatively stable on inanimate surfaces. They can survive at least 3 hours on human skin, nonporous materials such as plastic surfaces, Formica, stainless steel and hard synthetic fabrics such as nylon and dacron. In porous materials such as paper tissue and cotton fabric, rhinoviruses can survive for 1 hour (Hendley et al., 1973).",

Approximately 90,000 hospital admissions and 4500 deaths are associated each year with RSV in the United States in both infants and young children. In approximately half of infants younger than 8 months, the infection spreads to the lower respiratory tract, resulting in life-threatening bronchitis, bronchiolitis, bronchopneumonia and croup (Ginsberg, 1990). Asymptomatic first infection with RSV is rare; almost 100% of infected children develop disease. Because of poor protective immunity, reinfection is very common, but the disease is not as severe. Inoculation of adult volunteers with RSV has shown that the nose and eye mucosae are the most important portals of entry of this virus.

Immunity to influenza is long lived; however, it is virus subtype specific. Epidemiological studies have shown that individuals previously infected with influenza A subtype H1N1 during the 1957 pandemic were resistant to infection when the same subtype reappeared in the 1977 pandemic, but they were fully susceptible when exposed to other influenza A subtypes.",

It is caused by a coronavirus believed to have originated from bats in Southeast Asia, and later transmitted to other animals. It causes a fever with chills and coughing, with 10 to 20% of persons infected developing diarrhea. It is believed to be spread by contact droplets or from fomite contact. The airborne route does not appear to be the major route of spread as close contact appears necessary for effective spread under most conditions. It is present in both the respiratory droplets and feces. It appears capable of surviving for a few days in liquids and for 24 hours on fomites (Rabenau et al., 2005). Current evidence suggests that the SARS coronavirus originated in bats, and spread to humans either directly or through animals held in Chinese markets.",

How long a pathogen survives in a particular environment depends on a number of complex factors, which are listed in Table 22.13\n. Of all of the factors, temperature is probably the most important. Temperature is a well-defined factor with a consistently predictable effect on enteric pathogen survival in the environment. Usually, the lower the temperature, the longer the survival time. However, freezing temperatures generally result in the death of enteric bacteria and protozoan parasites. Enteric viruses, however, can remain infectious for months or years at freezing temperatures. Moisture\u2014or lack thereof\u2014can cause decreased survival, and UV light from the sun is a major factor in the inactivation of indicator bacteria in surface waters; thus, die-off in marine waters can be predicted by amount of exposure to daylight.
