That is because current environmental factors do not provide a powerful explanation of such seasonality, especially given climate differences between countries with moderate climates. It is hypothesized that one major factor is overlooked: pollen count. Pollen are documented to invoke strong immune responses and might create an environmental factor that makes it more difficult for flu-like viruses to survive outside a host. This Dutch study confirms that there is a (highly) significant inverse correlation between pollen count and weekly changes in medical flu consults, and that there is a highly significant inverse correlation between hay fever incidence, as measured by prescribed medication revenues, and weekly flu consults. This supports the idea that pollen are a direct or indirect factor in the seasonality of flu-like epidemics. If seasonality will be observed during the covid-19 spread as well, it is not unlikely that pollen play a role.",

Further, it is observed that these strains of viruses have a lower reproduction factor in tropical countries, outside the rain season. It is observed that possible inhibiting environmental factors in these epidemics are UV light (Schuit et al., 2020) , temperature and humidity (Chong et al., 2020) and behavioral changes during the seasons (Gozzi et al., 2020) . None of these environmental factors seems to be completely satisfactory to Journal Pre-proof J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 2 explain the seasonality of flu-like epidemics, which is very important to understand in the light of ongoing modelling efforts for the current Covid-19 pandemic.",

It is very interesting to understand whether also in other countries and years a PITV of around 66 pollen/m3 (+/-8) is found for moderate flu-like epidemics, and if this threshold value can be further understood in the light of the more aggressive Covid-19 pandemic. Further, it is good to understand better the interaction between aerosol pollen and flu-like viruses, and whether general immune responses are indeed a causal factor in reducing the spread of flu-like viruses. Finally, it still needs to be observed whether the covid-19 (SARS-CoV-2 virus) spread will be seasonal -\"going away in May\" -whereby the pollen factor could be studied as a directly or indirectly inhibiting factor, potentially.",
